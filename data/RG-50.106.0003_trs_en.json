        "Question: The following is an interview of Suzanne Foldes [ph]. It is taking place on\nJanuary 25th, 1996 in Silver Spring, Maryland and is being conducted by Gayle Schwartz\n[ph]. Could you tell us your full name?",
        "Answer: Suzanne Foldes [ph], with the middle initial M. for Martha.",
        "Q: And your maiden name\u2019?",
        "A: Was Morway [ph].",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: In Miskole [ph], Hungary.",
        "Q: And when were you born?",
        "A: June 23rd, 1921.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your family, who made up your family?",
        "A: It was a very small family. I was a only child. My father then already came back\nfrom two years of World War I in Russia, and after that two years as POW. My mother\nwas from the other part of Hungary and they got married right after World War I where\nthe country was split between two parts, Communist part and a non-Communist part.\nAnd they had to start all over after that again. But they had been very successful. My\nfather as a businessman was very, very well off.",
        "Q: What kind of business was he in?",
        "A: They had men clothing which entailed tailoring which entailed upper coats and suits\nof every fashion. Not [haphhazard ?] like here. That was the line of my first husband'sfamily. But they were strictly men clothing and they were three partners to it, three\nyoung men who learned the trade together and at the same place and became very good in\nthe trade.",
        "Q: Would you describe your family as upper class or middle class?",
        "A: Middle class, and my father was really a self-made man. He was the son of a [sem?]\nreligious teacher who had a lot of children and constantly moving on from one place to\nthe other where there were enough Jewish boys to teach and prepare. So while my father\nwas the oldest boy, he went out and had no chance of education, formal education, but he\nwas working only that his younger brothers all should have and he was able to give that\nto them and was always [shortening?] the whole family. Not that it meant too much of a\n-- how should I say -- really not miss anything because of that. It was different in my\nmother's parents' case. My mother's parents were the richest wholesalers in Watz [ph]\nwhere they lived, which changed drastically in the 1930s when my mother's sister\nmarried a man who ruined the families, so much so that they left the town and moved up\nto Budapest and didn't want to be seen and known by nobody that they are having\nfinancial problems they didn't have because their sons and daughters made sure that they\nshould not miss anything, but, of course, they were not in the way they used to be and\nthey were suffering -- they were ashamed not to live the life what originally was meant to\nbe lived by them.",
        "Q: Can you describe the town that you lived in? How big was the town?\nA: Miskolec [ph] is the capital of Northern Hungary. It's a big well, well run place which\nhad a lot of factories around it. So business was always a capital place where people\ncame from the whole surrounding. And it had over 10,000 Jews.",
        "Q: Out of -- do you know what the overall population --",
        "A: It was 60,000 population, which came -- became later 100,000 with the outer parts\ngrowing into it. The -- the Jewish community had different synagogues, from orthodox\nto where the rabbi only spoke Yiddish, to another one which had a rabbi who had the\ndoctorate and spoke Hungarian, and the third one which was so religious a small-town\nreligious like Southmar [ph] is and they lived separately in their own little ghetto within\nit. Within the --",
        "Q: Did you have a large extended family in the town?",
        "A: My father's family lived there. He had sisters and brothers and, of course, the sisters'\nand brothers\u2019 children.",
        "Q: Did you get together with the family on holidays and --",
        "A: Not really. Not really. But yes, of course, we went to visit them in the synagogue.\nYes, we met them time to time. Of course we went to visit at their house. But it was not a\nclose relationship. My mother and her in-laws were just fine but in a cool way. It never\nwarmed up to a level where they were really fine with their family, and so, of course, I\nwas not part of the family there.",
        "Q: How religious was your family? What kind of religious background did you have?",
        "A: We had strictly orthodox kosher house, but it was mainly to in respect of the parents\nwho wouldn't have eaten otherwise at our house. And then I was 17 and both of my setof grandparents died within a year. After that it was still kosher because they were used\nto having their ways, but it was no such thing anymore that I couldn't bring into the house\nsomething what before couldn't be brought in.",
        "Q: Did you celebrate holidays, --",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "Q: -- religious holidays and --",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "Q: -- observe Shabbat?",
        "A: Yes. Well, observe Shabbat, yes, but my father's store was open. It wasn't open only\non [shoppershu] and the three days of the high holidays. Yes, my --",
        "Q: Did you go to Hebrew school? Did you have any religious training?",
        "A: There was -- there was in -- not Hebrew school, but in the regular school where we\nwent we had a teacher come in and give us twice-a-week religious lessons which was not\ntaken too seriously, neither by the congregation to send a proper teacher, nor the children\nwho, of course, went as much for it as the families went for it. But it was more than the\nAmerican children had.",
        "Q: What kind of school did you go to? Was this a public school?",
        "A: No, none was public school. I first -- elementary school I went to the Jewish\nelementary, which was huge. It was for 1,000 children, which meant up to six grades\nthey had. I went there four grades and from there I went to the Protestant gimnazium\nbecause that was the school to go to. The Jewish children had to pay double of thequarter. The Catholics one-and-a-half times only. But we were different, definitely\ndifferent, but we were allowed to go at least.",
        "Q: What -- what part of the school was Jewish, do you remember, approximately?",
        "A: Well, it depended on classes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: My class, out of the 50 we had 18 Jewish girls and we were fighting because by the\ntime we grew -- we were growing into first [Jewish low Hitler] and some girls in the\nsummer went to Germany to camp, others had the Nazis of Hungary with rings on their\nhand and we were fighting fistfights with them. [They have -- with their debt].",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Um, what about your friends? Did you have --",
        "A: The friends were Jewish.",
        "Q: Were Jewish?",
        "A: Not true, because I did have one or two non-Jewish friends, but they were not that\nclose because the children could have been very close and we went to school together and\neverything was fine, but the parents of that group did not really want their daughters to\nmix so much with the Jews, so we were not kept very close with them.",
        "Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So it was a mixed neighborhood?",
        "A: It's a very mixed neighborhood.",
        "Q: Was there any problem in the early -- obviously we'll get to the '30s later on, but in the\nbeginning was there -- do you recall any problem?\nA: No, there was not.",
        "Q: (Inaudible) -- child?",
        "A: Actually there was no problem where we lived until 1944 when they pushed us in the\nghettoes.",
        "Q: Okay. And did you have any hobbies?",
        "A: Oh, God knows. I wouldn't have called it hobbies.",
        "Q: Other interests besides school?",
        "A: I believe that my life is depending on that we go to the Olympics. I was a sports\nperson and yes, I was prepared for the 1936 Olympics and Hitler didn't want me.",
        "Q: In what sport?",
        "A: Gymnastics.",
        "Q: Gymnastics. So you took that very seriously?",
        "A: Very, very seriously, and I was very talented too.",
        "Q: And you had -- did you have private instruction?",
        "A: No, but I belonged to a sport club of which teacher was my teacher at school, too, so\nwe were just going into that and get all the meets what sportsmen have right there. We\nhad sports clubs there. We had training grounds there.",
        "Q: And you thought -- and it was thought that you were good enough to possibly qualify\nfor the --",
        "A: I was.",
        "Q: That high?\nA: Was expected that I will qualify for the high school, the academic that I would be\ngoing there, but, of course, Jew couldn't go there by the time.",
        "Q: But you were of the caliber to be able to compete. Yeah. Um, what -- did you belong\nto any youth groups?",
        "A: Yes, but it was unorthodox way because the Girl Scouts were not supposed to have\nJews, but the Girl Scout leader, the teacher leader, wanted me to go along with them\nbecause I was so good and I was ready to pull the kids up if they had difficulty going up\non a mountainside, so I was with them.",
        "Q: So you were a member of the non -- the Girl Scouts?",
        "A: An unofficial member, because officially I couldn't be. A Jew couldn't be.",
        "Q: And how did you -- you were a young girl. How did you feel about that? Did that\nbother you --",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: -- that unofficially --",
        "A: Probably didn't even realize that that's holding me back from anything, because it\ndidn't hold me back. It was probably more showing that my friends are in Jewish\ncommunities and not there, but I was really comfortable until I -- I was part of it.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you belong to any Zionist youth groups?",
        "A: No. No. There was one, and I don't know why, but they were only boys, men, and\nthere was a tennis club which was Zionist. We went sometimes to play on their courts,\nbut that was a (inaudible). We belonged to them as friends but we never part of the -- as\na organization. Pardon me.\nQ: Okay. It's 1933 and Hitler has come into power. You were only 12, so you were\nyoung. Did you -- were you or your parents aware of situations changing?",
        "A: I have in my memory a picture what I will never forget. My father sitting on the side\nof his bed going to sleep and on eleven o'clock the evening when the radio came through\nthat Hitler became --",
        "Q: Chancellor?",
        "A: -- the chancellor, and I can hear his voice clearly: \"That's the end for us.\" And that\nmemory is so clear in my mind. I can see him in his underwear. This is the nightshirt.\nClearly, clearly see him.",
        "Q: Did he talk to you about this?",
        "A: He made this as a statement to my mother and me as we were listening to the radio.\nCame through and --",
        "Q: No, but I meant after that, did he talk to you about Hitler? Did you talk it over with\nhim?",
        "A: I am sure we were talking a lot about him and everything.",
        "Q: Do you -- do you remember as a young girl being frightened about this man Hitler?",
        "A: Not then. Not --",
        "Q: Not at that point?",
        "A: Not at that early age, but later when I was listening to his tirades.",
        "Q: On the radio?",
        "A: On the radio.",
        "Q: How did that make you feel?\nA: Sick. Sick in the stomach. And we kept wondering, how can these people believe in\nthat? How can they go with him so blindly? But -- the only thing was, you know, that\nwe thought that we are so embedded Hungarians that nothing can come to us and nothing\ncan hurt us, and awful for all these people who are bothered by it. But it cannot happen\nto us.",
        "Q: What languages did you speak?",
        "A: I started to speak German before I spoke Hungarian because my father felt that a\nperson is as many persons as languages he speaks. So they spoke to me in German only\nuntil I was five. Of course I understood in the meantime Hungarian because we had a\nmaid. We had this coming to the house, that coming to the house, but they weren't\ntalking to me in Hungarian until I was five, so by the time I go to school I should be\nreally good by children and I should speak that language too.",
        "Q: And your school was taught in Hungarian\u2019?",
        "A: Yes. Although the second grade we speak -- picked up German and then, of course, in\ngimnazium we picked up right away German as first grade, and the third grade French,\nand I had also private instruction by then in French, and at 16 I started to learn English,\nBritish English, and in the meantime I had Latin, too, under -- in everything from fifth\ngrade to eighth and we had [???] all three languages -- or four languages: Hungarian,\nGerman, French and Latin.",
        "Q: Anything that you specifically remember in the middle '30s that you want to talk\nabout, any specific incidents, or did life just go on --",
        "A: Our life went on --\nQ: -- in a normal sense?",
        "A: -- except that around us there were already ugly happenings.",
        "Q: Such -- that you were aware of?",
        "A: Where we were very aware of.",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: A good friend of our son, who right now lives in Syracuse and he is now 85, 86, was\nable yet to get to the University in Debrecen and he may have said something, I don't\nknow anymore how it started, but a boy who -- whose family turned much earlier, so he\nfelt that he is not a Jew, said something of humor, [???] and he gave the guy a slap in his\nface. They threw him off from the university. And his father, who was so proud that his\nson was able to make it, got a heart attack on that account and died. So, yes, that was\nquite close. And yes, the -- by the time we were 15, 16, and started to go with boys who\nwere older than us and they couldn't go to the university or they were in law school, and\nthat was a lesser degree school than the other universities were. They already had\nproblems and the first Jewish laws started to come in effect in 1938. It was already time\nwhen a lot of this was -- had to let go from companies because it had to be just a\npercentage of Jews. And from there on it was coming closer and closer.",
        "Q: How was your father's business affected in 1938?",
        "A: In '38, not yet.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: But by 1940, '41 it was affected. They did not get all the merchandise they wanted to\nbuy. Not everybody was allowed to sell, and once the war broke out, it was a goodexcuse why they are excluding some but why is less merchandise available, so the Jews\nshould be getting less. The real problems came in 1942 when -- in 1940, first my father\nwas to go to work camp, but that was a very minor and --",
        "Q: We'll talk about that. I just want to go a little bit chronologically.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Were you aware of Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Most probably, yes, but I cannot now tell you when I --",
        "Q: Heard about it?",
        "A: When and how.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: But it was with me. I knew about it later. But again, it was something awful\nhappening somewhere very far. The closer the more vivid, tragic effects came when\nHitler came into Vienna and the Viennese Jews, who were original from Hungary, tried\nto come back and came back in droves and were telling us what's happening there and --\nor so they couldn't go back.",
        "Q: And you were 17 years old, so what were your -- do you remember what your -- some\nof your thoughts were then?",
        "A: By then we were very involved and we tried to help these people and we made --\ninstead of the winter balls and the musicals and big entertainments, we started to get\nmonies together, help them to get the people who did not have a trade to learn a trade so\nthey should be able to make it, and we tried to help them. From there on we were\nactively trying to help them.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And there were always more and more to be helped. Plus more and more people were\ntaken out to work camps. First inside Hungary to work, which is -- entailed road building\nand you name everything what was not meant for a Jew to do, and later they took them\nout to go out to Poland and Russia with the armies and, of course, many, many stayed\nthere forever.",
        "Q: Um, so then the war broke out. Do you remember that, hearing --",
        "A: In 1938, September Ist --",
        "Q: 1939.",
        "A: '39. Excuse me. Sure. '39. I was glued to the radio and listened to Italian news\nbecause that -- I could get Milano on my radio and I was translating from the Italian,\nwhich was so close to my Latin, which I knew then very well, to the family what the rest\nis talking about. Yes, we were very aware of it, and few days later the Polish people\nstarted to come through. We had taken in people from the street.",
        "Q: Into your house?",
        "A: Into the house.",
        "Q: Did you live in a private house or an apartment?",
        "A: It was a big apartment house, but it was a low -- 'cause the wall side was always a\nhuge apartment and the side was smaller apartments.",
        "Q: Right in the center of town or on the outskirts?",
        "A: No, it was not outskirt, but it was not center center. It was rather a nice area where\nparks were around us.\nQ: So you took people --",
        "A: I like it.",
        "Q: You took people into your --",
        "A: We found a family, a (inaudible) who came with a young boy whom they didn't know\nwhose child he was, only he was a private child on the road. And they picked him up and\nit was -- they were -- the woman wanted to give us some gold items of what she was\ncarrying in gratefulness that we let her have a bath and the child and change and wash\ntheir things. They had nothing but what they had on them. They were running. Most of\nthem didn't want to stop before Paris. They wanted to go at least that far, that smartly,\nbut they were coming in droves. There were thousands and thousands of people. And\nthe stories what they had to tell was just plain unbelievable. And there were a few earlier\nwho came over from that area, which is outside of the Hungarian border towards the east,\nwhich was [routine?] land, halfway belonging sometimes to Romania, sometimes to\nPoland, and this was very orthodox Jews, so it was a pocket of very orthodox Jews lived\nthere, and they slowly started to come over into safer place as Hungary was. At this point\nnow they started to get them together who wasn'ta citizen and were tossing them out\nof the border. And the stories what we heard that they are putting them right to death.\nAnd some girl, she was around 19, saw her family being killed and she was -- she --\nshe fled because she was so afraid of what -- and realized later that she's [laying down? |\nunder the bodies and she was able to come back to tell all this. But again, if you asked\nmy father or anybody in our [?], that cannot happen to us because we are Hungarians. Wehad put together the citizenship papers, this kind of paper, that kind of paper. We were\nalmost as proud of being Hungarian than the Mayflower Americans.",
        "Q: So at that point your father didn't consider it time to leave?",
        "A: No. He never did. Never consider leaving. I wish they did. My mother wanted once\nand not because of that. He had -- she had absolutely no such bad feelings about it, but\nthen the American [?vertswere?] was in 1938, '36? I wouldn't know now.",
        "Q: '36.",
        "A: Probably '36.",
        "Q: '36.",
        "A: She wanted to come over. She wanted to see that because she really liked the idea\n(inaudible) and my father said, my wife will be there working there for others.\n[?quona?], what kind of -- never anything happened to it.",
        "Q: So you were -- while this was happening and these refugees are coming in and telling\nthe stories, you're still at school. Were you still a student?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And now let's --",
        "A: But I was not in school anymore, then I also had to learn a trade because it became --",
        "Q: When did you finish school?",
        "A: In 1939.",
        "Q: 1939. Okay. And you had to learn a trade you said?",
        "A: Because it became clear that even if they -- my parents could find -- and my mother\nhad found -- somebody who was in big job and could bring me into the academy, theywould kill me in a year because they would just not let me live there. They would just\nmake me overdo it and my life was in danger if I went there. So I just had to give up.\nAnd then --",
        "Q: Can we go back to --",
        "A: Okay. Sorry.",
        "Q: Just interested in 1936 when you realized you couldn't be in the Olympics. What were\nyour thoughts?",
        "A: Oh, it was a pain. It was a --",
        "Q: Here you were trained?",
        "A: I was trained at that same year that -- not the same year. The year before there was a --\nthat club which I belonged to became 150 years old and one of the arch princes came\nfrom -- from -- (inaudible) came for whom we had to make a big show. Everybody was\nto get a golden --",
        "Q: Medal?",
        "A: -- medal. And they were saying there loud that everybody who participated got a gold\nmedal and then -- that was early summer and we already went back to school and there\nwas nothing of it. It turned out that for the Jews they didn't give the medal. Jews couldn't\nget it. So, no, it was a pain. And yes, it brought the action, of course, and I didn't want to\nparticipate anymore in any of the game, but because I was a good friend with this teacher\nwho was our coach, I still did and I still did everything mature, but the feeling wasn't in\nthere anymore.",
        "Q: Um, okay. Let's jump ahead back to 1940, I guess we were.\nA: Well, just to finish that thought. For 40 years I didn't do any sports. I just couldn't\nbring myself to, so I became a couch potato in that sense. It was a reaction.",
        "Q: You were talking about 1939, 1940, and hearing these stories and the refugees coming\nin, and then you started to learn a trade. What did you -- what trade was that?",
        "A: It was -- the trade was fitting into our future. The \u2014 my first husband's family, as I\nmentioned, he was in (inaudible) shirt business, so I learned how to make custom-made\nshirts, pajamas, elegant underwear for men, and I went through that so if --",
        "Q: Did you go to a training school?",
        "A: No. There was a school, but beside the school you had to go for one year into a shop\nto learn the trade and you had to --",
        "Q: Had you gone to the school first?",
        "A: No. During the year when you went to the shop, every second afternoon I had to go\nfor two hours to the school too, but that was it.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Not even serious thing. It was just telling you what a worker is expected to do.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And you're still living at home at this point?",
        "A: Oh, yes. And my first husband, we were in love. I think I was 16-and-a-half when I\nmet him.",
        "Q: How did you meet him?",
        "A: In the first ball that I was introduced, after midnight, the midnight dance, five young\nmen came over, were introduced by one of them who knew me, and out of the five, two\nbecame my husband.",
        "Q: Oh, my. Oh, my. Um, so you were working and living at home?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then what was the next change or --",
        "A: I got married.",
        "Q: Oh, when was that?",
        "A: First of all, the first change that might interest you was 1940 when my father was\ntaken to this work camp I mentioned to you.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Which was only for a summer long, and the C.O. was my Latin and history teacher,\nwho was really very nice gentleman and was suffering from this idea that he has to be\nnow bossing this all Jews. These men were already in the late fifties. What they were\nthere for, 1t was not for work. They were just there to be killed and the put-down, the\nshame on them. Nothing else. (Pause.)\n(Tape one, side two.)",
        "Q: Tape one, side two. And you were talking about how your father had to go off in the\nsummertime to a labor camp. What was your thoughts about seeing your father having to\ngo away, to be taken away?",
        "A: We kept going with him. It was some 60 miles from where we lived.",
        "Q: You went with him?",
        "A: And every day we taxied out there to be with him. We didn't let them go. We didn't\nlet them be alone. But you have to live as then we were still very much in charge of what\nwe wanted to do.\nQ: This is summer of 1940?",
        "A: 1940. Yes.",
        "Q: Did you have contact with him when you got there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You could talk to him?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: What kind of work did he do?",
        "A: Practically nothing. It was just to sit around in a dusty place, to stand up and stay at\nthe (inaudible) -- and sit --they were really just annoying the people and didn't let them\ndo what they wanted to do, they supposed to do in their own businesses. Just pulled out.",
        "Q: What happened to your father's business while he was away?",
        "A: Well, we tried to keep it according to their orders moving on. They have plenty of\ngood and dependable employees to run it, and it didn't last long. It was some six weeks I\n(inaudible) told you about, but it was something what you don't forget 'cause the little\npeasant man who's now -- God knows what kind of rank he has. He is so old. He doesn't\nknow what to -- who these people are. He only knows that I am now in charge to tell\nthem that now it's time to go to sleep and now to wake up and now make your bed and\nthings what they haven't done already for last 30 years or so.",
        "Q: What was the name of the location of the labor camp?",
        "A: Hatvan, H-A-T-V-A-N.",
        "Q: And did you bring him anything when you would go visit? Did you bring food or --\nA: Most of the time we still went there to restaurants, we were able to get here. We could\norder people to bring when we come next day this kind of food, fruit, whatever they\nneeded. It was rather easy to take care of them there.",
        "Q: And then he came back\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And resumed his work?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: And you were, um, still living, you said, at home?",
        "A: Yes. I lived home until I got married, then actually even after that because --",
        "Q: When did you get married?",

        "A: March of 1942.",
        "Q: Anything else in 1940? Any more restrictions that you felt? Were you restricted?",
        "A: We were already restricted. If -- I couldn't go to the university. If I had to work now\nas -- near what the sewing machine, that was not what I was made up for, made for.",
        "Q: Yeah. Any restrictions on hours, being outside?",
        "A: No, not --",
        "Q: Not at that point?",
        "A: No, not that yet. You see, the war did not start seriously while the Germans went\nahead. The problems --",
        "Q: Hungary was an ally of the Germans?\nA: Yes. But then they were coming back after Stalingrad. That's where the war came\n(inaudible) us.",
        "Q: So now 1940 went on after your father came back and you were working 19 --",
        "A: I think another Jewish law came which made things a little bit more insecure, but\nagain, this -- all these was not affecting me, the girl, in that comfy home. And having my\nhusband then, we were very optimist. Very, very optimist.",
        "Q: And your husband's name?",
        "A: Paul Barkovich (sp).",
        "Q: Paul Barkovich. Okay. And now it's 1941. Things are going on as they were. In\n1942 you said you got married?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did your life change? You said you stayed living at home?",
        "A: Well, we stayed living at home because -- because of the war. There were no more\nbuildings going on, so there was no apartment available. And my in-laws gave us a lot\non which the two boys -- they had two sons -- should build for themself modern homes as\nthe war comes to an end, and again it's a possibility which we could comfortably wait out\nin my parents' house. And we lived there together with them.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: But six weeks after my wedding they took my father out now, and now they took all\nthese -- all the men -- not only all the men, all the professional people and the business \u2014\nthe better business people. The ranked business, because we are ranking everything.\nThere's a layer up there and another layer and a third layer. So not the -- not to(inaudible) to camp. (Inaudible) state. The bosses went to camp, but now they were\ntaking them out to [?] and they did not come back for another 16 months. After 16\nmonths, we were able to pull enough strings to bring the older ones together. My father\nwas the 58 and close to 60. What do they want to do to these men? And then --",
        "Q: Did you have any, um, communication with your father while he was away during\nthose 16 months?",
        "A: Yes. These -- these Hungarian peasants who were now over them, who were giving\nrank and they were -- how should I put it -- put in charge over them kept coming back\nhome for a visit to the officer's house. The officers should -- and each time we were able\nto bribe them to bring letters and to bring them letters and also some food and some\nclothing when winter came. I mean, when they went away it was June. They called them\nin in May, and I think by June 10th they were not in the country. And some of them, the\nyounger professionals in one group, were sent straight to -- oh, God. Now you better stop\nthat machine because -- so these young professionals were [state?] sent on minefields\ninstead of [dogsaur].",
        "Q: Do you remember where your father -- do you know where your father was taken\nspecifically?",
        "A: Yes, he was in barmitzva (inaudible) in the Ukraine.",
        "Q: And, um, that was for 16 months you said? So what did you and your mother do, and\nyour husband?",
        "A: We tried to run the business and, of course, these ladies never had any word in the\nbusiness, so whatever they did and whatever -- the way they had seen life, because youcould not -- and these -- our three old men would never have thought of holding back\nmerchandise, not to sell it, to keep the money's value, and, of course, the ladies were\nhappily selling out everything and then when they couldn't get merchandise for it, then\nmy mother's brother came down, who was the lawyer, anyway lived in Budapest, and\nthey made a deal with him that he's buying a condominium apartment in Budapest on that\nmoney so the value. When the old men came home and heard about that, they were, how\ncan you do such a thing? They ruin the business. They were running four stores. My\nparents' business was such that they were the first chain store in this line. They had\nstores in three different cities in the -- in Hungary too. So they just couldn't believe that\nwhat the -- what these women are thinking, and, of course, they -- they were not how --\nthey were too honest, too straight to know how -- how to live during war time.",
        "Q: You -- you had enough food and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- your health was good --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- at this time?",
        "A: We were able to do everything.",
        "Q: And your husband was still with you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then the next change?\nA: 1944,",
        "Q: Well, okay. Then your father came back?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Right. And he --",
        "A: They took over and they just lived their life the way that they meant to supposed to do.",
        "Q: And you stayed with your husband with your parents?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And your husband worked in his father's business?",
        "A: Yes, and I was there with him.",
        "Q: Right. And were you also now getting reports from what was happening in other parts\nof Europe, 1942, '43?",
        "A: Sure. Sure. Except that, you know, but you're talking about getting news or what's\nhappening somewhere. Yes, you hear about everything, but history is being painted\ndifferently by different people. If you pick up two history books, they will not see the\nsame thing. And so we did not get only what the Germans allowed to get and the\nHungarians allowed to get, except when I was -- as told you, when you listen to Free\nEurope, you practically play with your freedom because if they catch you on it, then they\njail you, but that was the only way to try to get some information, and that information\nwas not true information either. That was propagandA: So we -- we pedaled through\nthat.",
        "Q: How was your father's health when he came back from 16 months?\nA: Well, he was a sick man since 1920. When he came back from Russian POW camp,\nhe was not a healthy man anymore and he didn't become healthier during that time,\nexcept it helped him that he lost a lot of weight. He was a overweight man before and\ndefinitely in that sense it was a good way of losing weight. Well, he was not a healthy\nman and he did not act healthier. But he was able to work.",
        "Q: Now comes 1944.",
        "A: Now comes 1944, and 1944 was quite a year. What I didn't tell you, that very soon\nafter I got married I became pregnant, and my husband, rest in peace, was so smart. He\nsaid, we have plenty of time. We are so young. I don't want you to have a child and\nleave it here and I being taken out. I don't want to leave a war widow and this child goes.\nSo my father's peasant soldier who was coming back from the front was asked by my\nfather to see us all, that he wants him to bring picture of all of us, not picture picture, but\nthat he spoke to us, each and every one of us. So because I was in bed, they had to bring\nhim up to my house, and my father kept asking enough questions from that man that what\nthe man didn't know why I'm in that bed. He figured out and wrote us back awful letter,\nwhat did I dare to do. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that we went through that, too.\nMy husband has a sixth sense that this is not the time. Then while my father was still out\nthere, the Italians had stepped out of the war, and that brought to us hope that now they're\nfalling apart and now we don't have to hold out too much longer. Still nobody, so -- and\nnobody could imagine that the Germans coming, and even if they coming that they can\ndo anything to us. So when they came in on March 19th and they arrived, we were very\norganized. They organized the Jewish leaders of the city to give them names. Theyorganized the Jewish (inaudible) to tell them that there's nothing to worry about and they\nare having guarantees that we just give the Germans every half and nobody will bother\nus. And then they needed apartments and we were put into the ghetto, and in the ghetto a\nofficer of the army who was in charge of this work camps came into the ghetto and pulled\nall these men out hoping that if he puts them in the camp that we're safe then. And he\nknew that the best will be taken out from the country and he hoped that with these he\nsaves them they can stay in the country, and he did. He did it quite wrong from May to\nDecember when [sourshit] took over, and then when in Budapest they found the last ones\nand pulled them altogether, he helped them to safe places.",
        "Q: When was the ghetto formed in your city?",
        "A: In May.",
        "Q: In May. And, um, what -- what was your first impressions when you saw the\nGermans? Do you remember that?",
        "A: Tragedy, tragedy, tragedy. We were very, very scared. But again, the scariness of it\nwas that they are there. The scariness of it was that they can do harm to people, that they\ncan -- there. (Inaudible) there. But that they can't take out somebody from the country\nbut still did not.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Just did not come to possibilities. Not the very latest from the city ghetto, from where\nmy mother, my father, and my husband was taken out now. Mostly women stayed\nbehind were taken out now to a outside-of-the-city ghetto, which was a brick factory, and\nin that brick factory they not only made us wait, but they pulled altogether from thewhole area. So some 60,000 Jews were taken out from Miskolc from that brick factory to\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: Um, yeah. So how long were you in the -- the first ghetto in the beginning?",
        "A: Almost two months.",
        "Q: Two months?",
        "A: No, no, no, that was less. Probably just about five weeks, but during that time the\ngendarmerie was beating all of the Jews, the secrets where they had put their monies and\nthe --",
        "Q: Valuables?",
        "A: And that was everyday affair that they did not come out alive from there, and some\nwho knew that they could not handle that killed themself before going in there.",
        "Q: Was your family questioned at all?",
        "A: No, and that was strange, because somebody from that office, which was right across,\nas we kept hearing the screaming from there, came over and my father became so scared\nthat he got the diarrhea and was sitting in an outhouse, and they went by and pulled the\npeople from the next two buildings. Nice memories.",
        "Q: What was the condition like in the ghetto? Was it near --was the ghetto near where\nyou had lived?",
        "A: The first ghetto in the city was that very, very just Jewish area, so my father had a\nfriend who had a house nearby that some eight families went to live with that family.",
        "Q: What did you take with you? You were a young, young woman.",
        "A: I don't know. Lot of things from grits to coats to summer wear to -- it was spring, so\nyou needed sweaters, summer wear. You name it, we were taking it. Then somebody\ncame in there and said that you cannot use that here. There's no room here. Give it to me.\nI -- trust me, I keep it for you. Which, of course, they didn't, but they took it from our\nhand not to have our hand over strength used. The -- these people who had to live there\ntogether, that means that two, three family in one room of the apartment, one corner, this\nfamily live on this mattress. That family live -- it was not fun.",
        "Q: There were four of you, your parents and you and your husband?",
        "A: Yes, at the beginning, but that was very short time because I said the two men had\nbeen taken out but the other families' men went too then, and probably another week or\nso we lived there with less people, but again, with jittery nerves because the one\nbathroom really couldn't take care of all of us comfortably.",
        "Q: Did you go out on the street?",
        "A: Yes, inside there, in the ghetto, but outside of the ghetto you didn't go there and\n(inaudible). I went with my husband from this first ghetto to agricultural work. The city\nhad a gardening establishment and we were given them to garden there and --",
        "Q: What kind of work? You did gardening work?",
        "A: Yeah. Sometimes we were -- sometimes we were to pick flowers in the flower area,\nand during the time when I was in one of the parks where we were supposed to work but\nwe hever got to it, the American came with a (inaudible) from one end of the city to the\nother and we were the one which they bombed. They missed the -- the train station and\nthey missed the -- what establishment was that? It was something what was for the army.\nSome big building. So they missed that, too, but they --",
        "Q: Headquarters or something?",
        "A: -- but they had gotten us, and one of the young girls from our group was pulled\ndifferent little pieces. But again, there I (inaudible) my husband wasn't there. Then I was\nout of the alarm and we were turning the dirt, he was still with us. That wasn't near to the\nstation, the train station.",
        "Q: So then the men left your ghetto and you and your mother were there and then you --\nthe two of you were taken?",
        "A: And then we went to that brick factory.",
        "Q: The brick factory?",
        "A: They took us on the morning on June 6th when the Normandy --",
        "Q: Oh, the D-Day. Yes, the Normandy invasion.",
        "A: And so the people yelled in that you don't have to hold out too much longer. The\nAmericans are staying. But we didn't have the time. Now, many people were able to\nescape from there, and earlier from that --",
        "Q: From the --",
        "A: -- city ghetto, even from brick factory, and when I first mentioned it to my father,\nactually we were 1n our apartment yet because the first question came up. People were\nturning Catholic in big numbers.",
        "Q: Jews were turning Catholic?\nA: Because they hoped that if they are changing them they will be saved from worst to a\nlesser bad. And then my father, my mother turned to us and said that we don't mind if\nyou do it, if you feel like doing it, and my husband and I said no. We don't do this. But\nmy father's partner, himself and his daughter and son-in-law, all changed with no help.\nOf course none came back. But that was the first step. Then we were asking my father if\nwe should not try to go up to Budapest, and he said, how can I? Who is here on the train\nwho doesn't know me? Who is there who doesn't know your mother? How would a \u2014\nidea. This idea came back just before they took us to the brick factory. We got a note\nfrom my uncle from Budapest that he can send somebody for us who could take us to\nthem and we shall consider going, and my mother said, I'm not going to go nowhere. If\nyour father cannot come, then how can I go? No, we don't go. So we stayed. That's how\nwe wound up in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: How far was the brick factory from the ghetto?",
        "A: Oh, about eight, ten miles.",
        "Q: And how did you get there?",
        "A: Walked.",
        "Q: You walked?",
        "A: Walked through the city. Walked through the city.",
        "Q: And did the Hungarians look at you, or were the citizens looking --",
        "A: Some very happily, some less happily. As I said, some yelled in that it won't take too\nlong and don't worry, but others, well, quite happy.",
        "Q: And what --\nA: The Hungarians hate Jews, you know. Just about as bad as the Poles who haven't seen\na Jew, but they hate them.",
        "Q: Um, and what did you take with you onto the brick factory now? What did you have\nwith you?",
        "A: Only as much as you were able to carry, so there is already some pasta, some dried\npasta, because what are we going to eat? Potato we find somewhere and we put a little\npasta in it and we make soup and we live on it. Very little else.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you have any valuables with you?",
        "A: The valuables were taken off us before we went. In that city ghetto they took the last\nones off us.",
        "Q: Did you take anything very personal with you, sentimental value?",
        "A: I don't know. I really don't know.",
        "Q: Photographs or anything?",
        "A: I don't know. I don't think so.",
        "Q: So how did your mother manage walking to the ghetto?",
        "A: Well, she was a young woman. She was healthier and better looking than I was ever\nand -- but when we arrived to Auschwitz where we unpacked, she said, we don't survive\nthis one. I said oh, yes, mom, we will. She said that well.",
        "Q: So now you're in the brick factory. What were the conditions like there?",
        "A: It was plain awful. It was just you sit in the dust. The brick stands there to dry. That\nmakes you have walls, and above it it's empty and the air flies through and the flies fly\nthrough and God knows what smells fly through. Here you are already in big, biggroups, and my second husband's first wife and child was there. The baby was then\nabout 16 months old and heavy. So he survived sometimes with caring (inaudible) and\nthe mother-in-law picked him up, then the other sister-in-law helped, we went over to\nhelp. And it was no life anymore. But I still had cigarettes in there.",
        "Q: Were people -- what was the feeling about of the people then, the Jews in the brick\nfactory?",
        "A: Scared. And the ones who had more -- more smell -- smell than they gave somebody\nsomething what they still had with value and left. And left us there. It was awful stupid -\n- how should I put it to you? It 1s possible thing not to try to escape because what worse\ncan happen to you? They grab you and put you on other end.",
        "Q: Did you know that?",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: Did you consider trying to escape?",
        "A: I asked my mother. I found a [shawndar?] who would have helped and she said, what\nwill your mother -- your father say? Your father said that we cannot go, and so we stay --\nwe Stay together.",
        "Q: So you were there with your mother for how long in the brick factory?",
        "A: About six to eight days only.",
        "Q: Six to eight days. Yeah.",
        "A: June 6th we went, and on June 12th they packed us, so exactly six days.",
        "Q: What was June 12th like? How did you know that you would be moving?",
        "A: They were coming in [shawndars?] and pushing us into one direction and we were at\nthe train.",
        "Q: To a train station?",
        "A: It was not a train station. It was the train which could come in into the brick factory.",
        "Q: Into the brick factory. I see.",
        "A: It was nothing serious. We went then together in it, then they pushed it out to the\nregular station.",
        "Q: Yeah. And what kind of a train was it?",
        "A: There was only one kind of train there.",
        "Q: It was the cattle car train?",
        "A: Yes, (inaudible). Yes.",
        "Q: And, um --",
        "A: By the time we got to the railroad station we were already thirsty and were begging\nfor water, and the friends of ours sister and her family were in that same (inaudible) who\nwas -- who had diabetes and we had seen her without food there going through all the\nworst way you can see somebody slowly dying.",
        "Q: Did you know many other people in the \u2014",
        "A: (No audible response. )",
        "Q: Was this mostly -- this was women, mostly women\u2019?",
        "A: Mostly women, because a lot of men were taken, but really it was not a special train\nfor women only and men only were separated.",
        "Q: Right.\nEnd of File One\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: This is tape two side A. And you were talking about how you and your mother were\nleaving the brick factory and had gotten on the train with other people that you knew.\nHow long did the train trip take?",
        "A: Over two days. It was a very long trip.",
        "Q: Did you know where you were going?",
        "A: No. We were sure we are probably going to the other side, western side of Hungary.\nThat's where we are going to work. Then when they took us through the border, it must\nbe here somewhere in Germany they will need us on the west. Again thought went west,\nnever thought of going toward east now. And there was the train stopped and we were at\nZakopane. Did you hear that name? That was the Czech Alps most beautiful ski area\nwhere you only wanted to go in style. That was a luxury to go to Zakopane. I looked up\nat my mother and I said we come back here once on our own.",
        "Q: What were the conditions like in the train?",
        "A: That was something that you cannot ___. _It was just plain awful. 120 people in that\ntrain in the summer. With the one -- what do they call that ==? What was for\neverybody to --",

        "A: Bucket.",
        "Q: Were you able to sit down and rest or?\nA: We were constantly sitting in a corner at the very end of the train against the wall\npulling our legs in because there was no room for that. You couldn't take somebody else's\nroom up.",
        "Q: Were people helping each other? What was the --",
        "A: I don't think so. I think that probably you could only say that they were trying to suffer\nas quietly as possible not to bother the next one. I don't think that there was anything we\ncould really help each other with. The most was that if somebody still probably had some\nwater from somewhere and somebody was so sick that they were yelling and screaming\nfor something then probably they were able to wash his face probably. More than that\nthere was not a chance to do for anybody anything.",
        "Q: Were there any children in the car?",

All the Jewish\ngynecologists were already out in Russia or Poland, or they didn't live anymore.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But as I said, my mother fell on the right side behind -- now again I can't remember\nthe most easiest word. They were people who looked like they were crazy. We thought\nthat probably these are moved over to that side, they are wearing this uniform --",
        "Q: This is right after you got off the train?",
        "A: Yeah. Right across us as we were on this --",
        "Q: The platform --",
        "A: On the other side of the rail. These people were yelling and screaming that to my\nmother that you should put a scarf on your head. I don't understand that they tell you to\nput -- I wouldn't be crazy enough -- it's hot enough in this coat because she was wearing a\nheavy coat. Her hair here up front started to gray. She had that little gray on there. And\nthey knew what they were telling us. We just didn't understand. And then they made us\nstanding in line of five. So we stood in line of five. We saw that the men were put\nseparately. We had no men in our group. None of us. It was my mothers two -- my\nfather's partners' wives. The two women and the young married daughter of one of the\npartners. The one who turned Christian earlier. We were the five in that row. This mother\nwho I mentioned to you that she was with them in that row she was a petite person, very\ntiny. Very elegant little lady. But she was so small that they looked upon her as a child so\nshe went with the grown ups right away to the left side. I was the only one who was\nthrown to the living side.",
        "Q: And then where did you go after that?\nA: They took us into a building which and into a large area inside which had very\ninteresting furnishing. It was justlow ___ nothing else. And we were told to put down\ndecently our clothing to the place so we can find it and everything is to come off. And\nthen we were taken to the next room and they were getting into our hair and the hair\nunder our underarms --",
        "Q: Your body --",
        "A: And the body hair from everywhere. And they did not do too luxurious job on it and\nsometimes your body went with the skin and all. But they said --",
        "Q: Who did that to you, men or women\u2019?",
        "A: These were women. These were the Slovak girls who were still survived. See by then\nthere were very few of them who survived still. They were there for three years. And\nthese were practically all animals already because they were ready to kill each other, their\nown mother for surviving. And they were telling you why they were cutting your hair,\nwhere your mother went, what's happening just right now on the other side.",
        "Q: Did you believe her?",
        "A: Not only I believed her, I started to cry and I didn't stop crying for three days. I didn't\nhave anymore moist to it and I didn't have anymore tears running. It was a dry, hoarse cry\nwhich I could not stop for three days. It was at that point when we all realized how stupid\nwe were. Where we came. And they were telling us that we are the lucky ones which we\ncame so late that we will survive that. Not like their families. And how good that they\nhad taken our body hair off because now they are going to use a powder on it and so we\nwill not get lice. Which is very important. Let me assure you, yes it's very important notto get lice. Because the ones who got lice got___ and they were gone. They were the\ngoners first because there was no way there to keep clean.",
        "Q: Were you able to say anything to your mother when she went in the other direction?",
        "A: Not a thing. And this is what kills me to this day, back 50 years. Not that I didn't tell\nher anything, that I did not get in argument to Mengele. I spoke German. Why didn't I\nstart telling him that she's as young as I am and let her come with me. What would\nhappen to me? But I didn't give it a try. And I'm living with that for over 50 years and\ncannot forgive myself. I came home, my father's first word was what did you do to your\nmother. And I was telling him just like I told you now. And I was telling this a few times\nlater and everybody was telling me stop saying that because -- and no I can't stop this\nbecause nobody can feel what I feel and nobody knows how I can see the situation that\nyes I could have given it a try. I have to live with that. And it's not easy to live with that.\nAnd whatever life had for me what was bad I deserved because of that, I think. She was\nnot just a mother, she was somebody wonderful. And not even to try to save her. It's more\nthan one can survive. And so we came out from that area and they took us for a shower.\nAnd on the other end we were coming out and they were throwing toward us little\npackages. Instead of our clothing this was now become our clothing. So what I received\nwas probably for a ten-year-old girl. It was that long. My private body was showing and\nthere was no panties given. That was that. I was given a shirt and this dress and that was\nthat. Luckily for me I was carrying my shoe because I am very sensitive, I cannot step\ndown with -- so I was carrying my shoes.",
        "Q: Your own shoes?\nA: My own shoes. And that survived with me all the way until we left Auschwitz. I\ncarried it everywhere.",
        "Q: Just to get back, how did you know it was Mengele that was at the station?",
        "A: I didn't know he was the one. But there was that man in that uniform and he was\nshowing this way and that way. And the people were carrying the people out. Then later\nwhen he was coming to our camp then we knew names and --",
        "Q: But at that point --",
        "A: It became very elegant. Oh, we knew everything.",
        "Q: So then you got your short dress and you had your own shoes and where did they take\nyou? Where did you go then?",
        "A: That's when we went to our camp. It was B-3, barrack five. Which was the outer shell\nof a barrack really, nothing more. It had two big doors on the two ends and on the side it\nhad windows without glass. And there was nothing in it. We did not get the elegance like\nshifts on which you sleep five in an area and you are above _. No we didn't have\nanything. We just wrap them --",
        "Q: On the ground?",
        "A: On the ground. They took us in rows of five and they said these __ to the right these\n_____ to the left. So when you lay down you will be like forks. One body this way, one\nbody that way. So my legs went in between the legs of the other person and that kept me\nwarm. And my arm became my pillow together with my shoe and when you wanted to go\nout to the latrine then you try to go through these bodies who were completely next to\neach other. And in the dark when you wanted to make it to the window so you can gothrough it, step through it in the shortest way out then you stepped on somebody's face,\non somebody's arm, on somebody's legs. Somebody was screaming here and either you\nhad time to get out in time or you didn't. And you gave them all the beauties of what your\nbody was relieving. If there ever was something what take to cure humanity away from\nyou where you felt so bad that you thought any animal is living a much more -- I can't\neven think of -- but every life, every animal can have more decency and more respect,\nself-respect than you can. What are you? What kind of animal are you who you would do\nthat to your neighbor? These were the nights there. If 1t rained outside, it rained inside. It\nonly had not ceiling, nothing above us just it kept coming in. And for hours after it\nstopped raining outside it was still coming down and you were sitting in it laying in it in\nthat wetness. There was nothing. Nothing, no chance, no one to turn to. At the other hand,\nat the one end of the barrack there was a little room in which the blockalteste where the\ntwo stubendiest lived. And they had all the quilts there dry. I don't know how dry but\ndefinitely they always found something dry for themselves. We didn't have that kind of\nchances to own something what would keep us warm or dry or whatever. And that's\nwhere we lived for six weeks.",
        "Q: What did you do during the day?",
        "A: Standing in Appell or laying on the floor, on the ground. A ground which was\ncompletely naked, not even a speck of grass or anything on that. And on one end there\nwas some water coming up standing there together. Ugly, dirty water. That's what you\ndrunk if you wanted to drink, no matter they told you not to drink it. That's what you\nwashed your clothing in or yourself in. And some people just refused to. So they becamesick fast. Not well fast. I tell you honestly I wouldn't have cared and did anything for\nmyself either. When we got to Auschwitz I met a girl who was working in my mother-in-\nlaw's house for the last year and a half. She was an escapee from that area from\nwhere I mentioned to you. Three daughters the parents threw into Hungary that they\nshould save themselves. And they worked as maids in Jewish houses where somebody\nwas ready and willing to give a Jewish girl the dirty work. My mother couldn't do it. She\nwould not. She would not have a Jewish woman working for her. No way. But my\nmother-in-law had such a girl and she I met there in this camp and she started to look\nafter me. She pushed me to go to wash. She took my clothes off to wash it because I was\njust sitting there completely letting go. And she didn't. And she was there for about four,\nfive weeks. And during this time --",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Monsi Margaret Jacobowich(ph). She offered, volunteered to go for the food. You had\nto go over to another camp for that. They were such wonderful chaps taking out the sick\npeople from the barracks, throw them on the carriage which was taking them tothe ___.\nSo she offered herself that she goes for food and carries the food cans back to ours. And\nduring this time she was looking around and yelling to people if they knew somebody\nfrom her family. She was looking for them. And sure enough in the C Camp she found\ntwo of her younger sisters. And then she told me that she wants to go over to them if I\ntake care of myself, and there was some woman who wanted to come over to this camp\nshe will be changing place with her and then the number will be all right and that willcome back. So until then I was with her and I think that saved my life because I would\nnot have done anything for myself during these weeks.",
        "Q: What were the Appells like?",
        "A: Appells were -- it was dark when we went out and stood there for three, four, five\nhours until they counted and counted and recounted. And if they missed somebody at one\nblock then the whole 14 or 17 blocks would be held there in this camp and all standing\nthere. So three, four hours minimum after which they gave the breakfast. And then you\nwere told to go and either you were back to the barrack which usually they threw you out\nfrom and so you had to go some place around. And then they called you again to Appell\nto have the dinner -- the lunch and then the same time they were handing out bread which\nwas the dinner. So for that you were again for three or four hours and then they counted.\nThey counted.",
        "Q: Do you know how many people they were counting?",
        "A: How many people were they counting where?",
        "Q: In the Appell.",
        "A: All of them. All of them. See, in one barrack was about 500 people. If somebody was\nso sick they went over to the revere, which was the hospital, and they didn't find her or\nGod knows where they stood in line in the other part then you were standing until they\nfound her.",
        "Q: Did you have to do any work\u2019?",
        "A: No. There was no work --",
        "Q: No work there --\nA: This was a Vernichtungslager. You know that much German? No? Vernichtungslager\nis where they want you to disappear. You were going to be killed slowly with not eating,\nwith not having drinking water. You will die out. This camp was when they needed\nworkers somewhere this is where they came to get them together from and this is how\none escaped from there. And during the times where while we were there there were\nother people who worked and mostly men who were crossing our camp going from work\nto camp or the other way around. And during that time of course you kept yelling and\ncalling out names so I was calling my husband's name out, his brother's name out, my\nfather-in-law's, my father's name. And then a little paper came sometimes was thrown\nover to me by somebody who said no they are not here but Andrew Freed is here, who\nbecame my second husband. And he was looking for of course all of his family. And then\nmy father-in-law's store manager was there. Sent me a message that he's there. But our\nfolks were not there. They were gone straight -- my father-in-law, mother-in-law. The\nmen were not there. They did not get there yet. Rather didn't get there period because\nthey did not go to Auschwitz. So I was there until August 2nd and the last week of that\nwas when they killed the gypsy camp. We were standing outside on Appell and the sky\nwas yellow and red and the screaming was just unbelievable. They were throwing them\nas people tell us living into the fire. And then came the morning when Mengele and some\nthree other officers came to and stopped at every block, barrack and pulled out certain\npeople to work and the other one was left behind. So I was very light body all my life. I\nwas very thin. So sure enough the first thing was that I was left behind. Everybody from\nmy line, my first cousin and my aunt and my first cousin's two sister-in-laws, a youngerone and a grown up, were in my line. They all went to work and I was staying behind. So\nI got back into my dress ran over to another barrack --",
        "Q: They had made you take off your clothes?",
        "A: Yeah. You walked completely naked. You hold your clothing up there somewhere and\nyou walk with your arms up so they can take a good look at you breast and all.",
        "Q: How did you feel by that point?",
        "A: Like animals. Not humans. That's so dehumanizing. You know, by the time you got\nthere it doesn't even hurt anymore. But what hurts, the knowledge that you're left here\nbehind and you know what that means. So if you still have some energy to live that life\nthen you go on and try to get into the next barrack and stand in the line there with that\npeople. So while they were in the middle barrack I got to the next barrack and I got\nundressed with the rest of them and stood in the line and again they put me out. So it\nwasn't funny. No, I didn't bother even dressing too much. I ran over to the next barrack.\nAnd when they pick my arm that it's not enough and then I put my muscle that I have this\nside. By then my barrack was way outside, outside of the gates. How do I go to them? So\nthere was only one way. The big avenue of the camp which had the --",
        "Q: Gate?",
        "A: No. The soldier with the --",
        "Q: The guard?",
        "A: Yeah, but this guard had something with -- I'm looking this way but I cannot\nremember. Stop it please. So on the main avenue of the camp there was this soldier with\nthe machine gun and I figured there's only two ways. Either I stay here or he shoots me. I\nhaven't got many choices. If I manage to go and I'm fast enough by him then I probably\nget out there. And sure enough I was still very fast at running. And I got to the gate and\nthey were yelling and screaming to me to come from the other side they saw me coming.\nAnd the officer of the German women and the Slovak blockalteste were coming in and\none grabbed me and gave me flap in the face and said what barrack are you from. She\nwanted to know the numbers. She was only interested in the numbers. Where in which\none somebody went missing. How many to count. So I got out there and we went to the\nBirkenau and we got into place where we got to shower. And we were instead of 1,000,\nthat later turned out to be they wanted 1,000 workers. We were 1,070. Oh, so 70 had to\nstay there. So here was guard who was working for Mengele pulling out another 70 now.\nThere were now women there in this group who were pregnant who already could show\nthat they were pregnant. You see, some people came to Auschwitz without knowing that\nthey are pregnant and some who knew that they were having starting pregnancy but didn't\nshow so they got there. And now they were picked out who already showed and some\nwere. The woman who was sleeping across me during these weeks there she was\npregnant. And I had such a nice warm body to my feet to warm it while we were\nsleeping. But I lost her there.\n[Interview interrupted by turning over tape. |]",
        "A: You think it didn't work?",
        "Q: It's tape two side two and you were talking about being in Birkenau and they took the\npregnant women.\nA: Yeah. We now had 1,070 and out of all of us got a shower. But 70 was not allowed to\ncome out from there. They stayed there in that room and right there they were gassed.\nYou know that this is the same place you can either throw in gas or you give shower.\nMost comes from the same. So then we were given uniform --",
        "Q: Did you know about gassing at that -- then?",
        "A: Oh yes, by then we knew it. When they were cutting our hairs the Slovak girls were\ntelling us about the gassing. They were telling us what's happening to our mothers and to\nour sisters. They couldn't be happier to see us going ___ sick from what they were\ntelling us. As I told you these people were animals already. They were absolutely happy\nto see us suffer. And they many times pointed out that you are lucky because you came so\nlate that you will still survive the end. We came here four years ago when you went to\nballs and you had 5 o'clock tea said you just didn't know what to do in your very comfort\nand warm houses and you were looking for the luxuries of life. Yes, we were. True. That\nwas our fault we were because we had no idea what they are going through. But even if\nthey would we couldn't have believed it anyway. It was unbelievable for human beings\nthat this is happening to the other human being. Like when we went arriving at\nAuschwitz what we saw there on the other side, we thought that these people were crazy.\nThey are mentally sick and they were thrown into this camp because they had to be kept\naway from -- otherwise why would they be behind that -- behind what? Again I cannot\nthink of the word.",
        "Q: Fence or wires or --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So now there were 1,000 of you. They had taken the 70 away\u2019?",
        "A: Yes. Then we were taken into a train which was taking us across Germany to\n?Thuringen? and then from there this was Buchenwald's outer-commando where we went\nto work.",
        "Q: And this is August 1944?",
        "A: Right. And there everything was just beautiful and luxurious compared to whatever\nwe had seen before. Here there was a barrack which had rooms. And in each room there\nwere eight times double beds. One about each other. There was nothing else there but\nthey gave blankets, one underneath and one above you like military. And there was a\nlong table in that room and two -- on two sides there were two -- what's what you sit on?",
        "Q: A chair?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Benches?",
        "A: Benches. And that was that. And there was even a little stove in it. We didn't know\nwhat the stove will do for us, but in the winter it was really wonderful to have it. In the\nsummer also we were sometimes trying to steal some coal and make a little hot water to\nwash ourself. But they were giving half number of food compared to Auschwitz.\nProbably luxury food compared to Auschwitz. And there was a campsite and there were\nnot hours and hours standing outside in Appell. It was probably just an hour, hour and a\nhalf was in Appell. And then there was a factory about four miles away where we went to\nwork. That was ?IG Farbenindustrie?.",
        "Q: How'd you get there?\nA: Walked.",
        "Q: So you walked four miles to the factory and four miles back?",
        "A: Yeah. It was about an hour walk each way. I guess it may have been about four miles.\nAnd we had dogs to walk with the SS people with us and it was a decent big set up where\nthe prior people who were there working died out because the factory has been working\nwith saltpeter salt and that ruined the livers. So when this group died out they wanted\nanother 1,000 people and that's it. They had to have the workers.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do?",
        "A:Itwasa__. We were filling the bomb bodies with that -- should I try to find\nEnglish?",
        "Q: That's okay. And so you went -- what was a typical day like there?",
        "A: Well, it depends what you were doing. Most of the time I was working in the mill\nwhere this saltpeter came in as big bags and solid and it had to be worked up to powder it\nup. So you were to bake it up, somebody broke it, the other one was throwing it into the\nmill, and then others had to shovel the powder away into other bags in which they were\ntaking it to the part of the factory where they are mixing that with other things to make\nthat filling. And some people sometimes were working to put away the filled bombs. Or\nit was more of from this size on to big ones you were to carry from one place to the other\nwhere they would put the filling into it so what makes it --",
        "Q: Hold together?",
        "A: The other way around. To break up --",
        "Q: To explode?",
        "A: To explode, okay. Explosive, it has to be put at the end. Then they were put into the\npackaging of it of which we were very diligently taking, stealing the two sides what was\nto hold it because we knitted that into stockings. And if not knitting then we were\ncrocheting something. You needed something, you were cold. It was fall coming and it\nwas _ and we were standing out there it was not funny. But we managed. We stole as\nmuch as we could and we were some of us was quite good at it. I was really good at\nstealing coal. My hand fit into between the wooden planks and some people were quite\ngood at stealing some potatoes. I was good at going for seconds in the way that I was\nready and willing to pack off extra trunks which came in and if you worked too fast to\nremove the merchandise from it they gave you another soup. Very important thing\nbecause out of the 14 there was somebody who wasn't able to go out, or 16 of us, who\nwasn't able to go out to get his meal. We're hungry, I mean we're always hungry.",
        "Q: So you found that the women were supporting each other and --",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "Q: Helping each other --",
        "A: Yeah, we were a good group together, the 16. But we were not all 16 but there were\nmother with two daughters there in our room. And the five of us, that's eight. There was\nanother mother with her daughter who she didn't know that she was pregnant and who\nwas taken out several months later from us. And her the mother's daughter younger sister\nwas there with her two younger sisters. So there were four of them. Okay. Four, and we\nwere five, and there were three. And there was a Rebbetzin from _. What's Slovakia's\ncapital now? Anyway, originally we went to work the same place in this mill. Then my\naunt complained that she cannot do it. Although I was working in a lot of her work and\nalso my cousin --",
        "Q: You say, so you were with other relatives?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Had you been with these relatives all along?",
        "A: Yes. We were together in -- these were the five in Auschwitz who out of that four\nstayed together and I was taken back. This is my father's youngest sister, another sister's\ndaughter, and that daughter's two sister-in-laws. Quite young one, the one was 12 years\nold the smaller one. And the other one was already at my age. So there we worked. And\nthen my cousin and my aunt both wanted to get out of that factory work. And they\nsomehow got into the sewing room. Which probably was better suited for somebody who\nis soft and they didn't have to march out and back. That happened right on campus. And\nslowly we managed to get through this time. Less and less food. More and more deep air\nraids. So there was no steam coming from Marburg then we couldn't work. We were just\nsitting out there and do nothing, but we had to be brought out and brought back. You\nhave to go, you know. And so slowly winter came and we were stealing left and right\npieces of material so we sewed together something what should be stocking to cover our\nbare legs. Then from this bags of which the saltpeter was thrown out we made raincoat\nthat was five times deep paper. So we cut out something where you put your head in and\ntwo arms room and you were covered with that at least on the way out and back. Not all\nthe water was in your coat only the half of it. Well, we were working this way through\nnext spring. But by next spring it was very little work. Very little material coming into\nthe factory.",
        "Q: What was your health like?",
        "A: Well we started to become yellow, our skin and also our eyes from this material what\nwas catching us. Because that was coming out not only inside where you worked with it\nbut they were horse made -- well I should have started better. The factory was on the\nground. It was covered with roads and was covered with forests, and forest was made\nfrom that was all fake. Just --",
        "Q: Artificial trees?",
        "A: Yeah. Just so that from the airplane it should look like it's a --",
        "Q: Like a camouflage?",
        "A: Sure. And so you walked through that and all over little horse brought up that bitter\nalmond kind of poisonous gases which you inhaled. You inhaled inside and you inhaled\noutside. This is the reason these factories were never bombed. We were praying that\nwhen the planes went by. We were praying, we didn't expect to get out alive from there.\nWhy shouldn't we then finish it now? No, we were never bombed. They didn't know we\nwere there. So in March by then we were cleaning all the places where used to be\nmerchandise. We had to saubermachen, to make it clean. To wipe it, swipe it, do\nsomething with it. It's a real German thing to make you do nothing with cleaning and\ncleaning and cleaning. They don't give you anything to clean with, but you're cleaning.",
        "Q: How did you clean?\nA: With your hand, with your leg. You got something together from under the trees they\nhad some leaves on it and with the leaves you were, you tried. You tried to do like you're\nworking. Then when there was no work whatsoever inside then they made me and a few\nothers build roads. So we were having this little carriages taking the stones, throwing it\nout, other ones started to put them down. The third one had to go through with that\nmusher, which mushed the roads. But that was no work either because there was no need\nfor that road. There was no need to do anything there, but they made you do something.",
        "Q: Did anybody try to escape?",
        "A: From there there was no escape.",
        "Q: No escape\u2019?",
        "A: It was all completely covered. Completely covered. We did see human beings outside\nwalking when we were standing on the Appell, on the Appellplatz on the other side there\nwas a road on which sometimes peasants with horse carriages went by. They knew we are\nthere. Don't tell me they didn't, we knew that they were there. But there was no way of\ngetting out. Then one day in March it was a nice morning like that very bright and we\nwere out there doing practically nothing. At around 11 o'clock-ish they came that we\nhave to go back fast into the camp. Fast we going, going, going because of leaving. And\nthat evening we left the camp. We started to walk. And it was a big long walk.",
        "Q: This is everybody?",
        "A: The whole camp. And then they stopped us one place where we -- what I didn't tell\nyou that we had one lady with us in the kitchen who was a Rebbetzin who was counting\nthe Jewish calendar. And was telling us when it was Rosh Hashanah, when it was YomKippur. Nobody eat on Yom Kippur. It didn't matter. What we had was staying there,\nnobody will take it from us. And so the last day -- last night when we were in the camp\nshe said that it was first night of Pesach. And we went to her room and she made from\nsome flour what she stole in the kitchen some flat bread and she was giving us all a little\nbit of it. And we were reminding ourself that it is holiday. It turns out that she was only\nwrong with one day. The next night when we were out on the road that was really the\nfirst night of Pesach. That was very important.",
        "Q: What did you feel like when you were eating that flour and water?",
        "A: I don't know. We just thought that -- we thought back to that tradition how it looked at\nhome. It was something to help a little. Of course you realize that by then very few of us\nwas friendly enough with the One above us to believe that we are having this holiday\nbecause of Him. But there were two little girls also on the kitchen, the small kitchen\nwhich was peeling potatoes. They werea____ two beautiful little daughters. Some 12\nand 13-year-old redheads with lots of locks in their hair as their new hair grew out. And\nthese two girls have not eaten anything what look like meat piece or bone piece in that\nfood what they had all year long. They kept tried to be kosher. They were very kosher\nafter liberation I heard of them. They lived a very kosher life. But very few stayed with\nthat belief. I didn't. Anyway, as I said these holidays they were really something in that\nsurrounding. Anyway, we decided after that second night when we were again together\noutside there and we were holiday that next night we are going to try to get together. We\nwill try to find each other and we will get together. And that night when we started to\nwake we saw that a lot of the SS people were in civilian clothing. Or one was still withthe big _ cape but had been on a bicycle. So from their carriage all these things got\noff and they started to go in every direction. At that point I said to my cousin that I go\ntoo. If they go, I go.\n[Interview interrupted by phone ringing. |",
        "A: Sorry. So on that point my aunt and my cousin said that I'm crazy and they both left\nme. I said you cannot keep me. So I started out from that little road where we were from\nwhich there was a little forest on this side, quite a few trees, I shouldn't call it a forest.\nBut it was still very early spring you could see too that on the other side of that there's a\nroad on which I could see military going. So I said this is not the place I want to be at. I\nwant to go from here. And I, I just went.",
        "Q: By yourself?",
        "A: By myself. After which point they started to run after me. And by the time we first\nstopped we were nine of us. Of the nine of us only my cousin and I spoke German. And\nwe were walking across a field and we pulled out some sugar carrot kind of what still 1s\nthere. This is animal feed for the winter. So with that we put some and we ate some. By\nthen we didn't see bread the last ten days. So it was good to have something and we had a\nknife. I could slice it up and everybody got a slice of that. We weren't that hungry\nanymore. And we walked with it into the next village and on the edge of the village at the\nlast house we stopped and went into a peasant court.",
        "Q: What was the name of the village, do you know\u201d?",
        "A: No. I certainly know it's Frielendorfand _. And we stopped there and the German\npeasant came out and they didn't know what to make of us. They knew what we are\nexcept they didn't know if they want to throw us out or not. And we said we will not\nbother you just let us have rest here where your animals are, and he did. And actually he\nmade us go up so we can be up where it's dry and warm and nice. And we laid down\nthere and we rested ourself and evening came. And all of a sudden we heard speaking.\nAnd the speaking went on and it was clear that the German guy who also escaped from\nthe military wants to hide there and wanted to come up. And the guy from there was just\ntelling him that this is not a good spot here, he takes him to another spot. And we were\nvery comforted. We were very ready to jump and go, but they ran away. And the next\nmorning the peasant's wife came out and said you will have to leave. We said oh we will\nwe just needed this rest and we are very thankful and we go. And then we brought back\nthe group backwards where we knew now where the fields were, made them sit there and\nwait. And my cousin and I started to go from house to house and tell them that we are\nhungry and we would ask for some bread if they can spare. And everybody was able to\nspare some. Some had some cold cut to add to it. Some didn't. But everywhere they were\ncooking. We had no idea, but it was Good Friday. And that afternoon, of course when we\ncame back we told them all that we cannot eat it all here because our sisters are waiting\noutside for us and we want to share it with them. And they accepted. Some gave us an\nextra piece of bread because of it. Some just let us go. So we went back and we again got\nsome of this carrot kind of things. And with that the bread was very good. And that\nafternoon we heard a lot of noises, motors and big machinery noises. And as we looked\ntoward the west they were stopping in front of this peasant's house. So we looked out,\nsaw the main street over the guy's house where we spent the night before. And we saw\nthat he has a white underpants on a --",
        "Q: Pole --",
        "A: Stock outside hanging out on the street. And they are also hanging out there. And\nthere are a lot of other stores have something white hanging out there. And we looked\nback and we saw there's a kind of star on this machinery. Yes. They stopped there that the\nrest should come up to them. And we ran out to them. These were the first American\nG.I.'s who arrived there. And it was a magnificent, magnificent afternoon. When they\nheard who we are, they started to look for something to give us, food. And whatever they\nhad it was only from the breakfast ration what they had left over. So we asked for a\ncigarette. And eight of us smoked one Camel and all eight of us had seen stars at broad\ndaylight. Oh it was strong. It was very, very strong. But it was wonderful. And they kept\njumping to find some chocolate and there was some God knows what what was still left\nover from the breakfast. And then they got each other soap came our way. They saw that\nwe need some. And by the time we turned around the peasant's wife was coming that we\nshould come into her kitchen. She had a huge dish of hot potatoes, fresh potatoes in its\nskin. It was just I didn't understand how it went away so fast. You should have seen this\ngroup taking care of that potatoes. And then we went again out to the street and from\neverywhere around seeing how was in our little valley. And not big mountains but the\nmountains had all people come out from there. Russian girls who were in P.O. W. camp,\nblack African, French guys who were working as -- they were not P.O.W.'s and they were\nnot in concentration camp but they were something in between. They were able to getRed Cross packages once a month. They were handled quite different from us. They were\nhalf human. And they were not very nice. They were kissing our hands saying hello to us\nlike we are human being now again. And it was a gorgeous, gorgeous afternoon. I don't\nhave to tell you that Good Friday will always remind me of that. That was a beautiful\nGood Friday. Next day though we started to be very scared because the American troops\nstarted to go backward and we begged them take us along. We thought that --",
        "Q: You were speaking English? You could speak English?",
        "A: Well, it was not really English. I haven't used them for six, seven years. And now I\nwas full with my German so it was a mixture. But yes, I was the one who was telling\nthem who we are and what we are. For all of us I was the only one who spoke some\nEnglish. It wasn't English and many times I heard a G.I. say your English isn't.\nWell, I tell you why, what I didn't know how to say, but I knew how to say it a French\nway. I was using the French way. I mixed it with a lot of German. Luckily they were\ncoming from France so what was French was not so strange to them, but my English\naltogether was. But they had fun with it and they were so good to us. They were so\nwonderful. If you imagine what it is to feel human again. That people count you into the\nhuman race, not more, just that much. Then the mayor of the city was ordering a\nkindergarten to be emptied for us. It didn't matter that every furniture was this small and\nthe toilets were also half of a normal outhouse size and that low, but we had it. And the\nAmerican G.I.'s started to come to look us up. And we had one of the two people with us\nin this group was also a young mother with her daughter. The daughter was 12 and we\ngot into camp. Now she was big 13-year-old. A gorgeous girl, but of course you couldn'tsee that then, just something. And she was just laying there onthe _ and they were\nasking what she would like to have and she said chocolate and salami. So this young 18,\n19-year-old G.I. ran away to the PX and brought chocolate and salami and put it into her\nmouth and held her head to eat it though together that way. You can imagine how sick\nshe was, okay? It was close to putting us away with all the goodness, but they were\nwonderful. Then they heard who we are, what we were, it was stories to tell, right? And\nwhen they heard that we haven't seen meat.\nEnd of File Two\nBeginning File Three",
        "Q: You were talking about liberation and the GI\u2019s, the American GI\u2019s trying to get you\nsome meat.",
        "A: They went out to shoot deer. They found in the kitchen some of their comrades who\nwas able to skin it and clean it and prepare it. And they brought it like here is dinner. The\npeople of the city were ordered to everybody bring some cooked food to a certain place\nwhere we were fed. So everybody brought a huge ___ with that. They threw it together,\nmixed it together. It was wonderful. It was all the veggies in it and somewhere probably\nwere some, some meat or bone or whatever will give it some smells. And of course now\nthey came with the questions of what we now needs are. I know they cannot do more but\nwe had to get normal rooms and the post office was cleared away for us. And across the\npost office was a hotel and that was cleaned up for us. And the Germans made us clean.\nSo they were to clean for us and cook for us which they didn't like to do. And we didn't\nlike their food but now we started to be strong enough to have opinion about food. Andwe lived there until August. The American soldiers were not allowed to mix with\nGermans, with German girls. They couldn't see any. They were not allowed to meet the\nRussian P.O.W.\u2019s so only the Jewish Hungarian refugees were partners for them. So they\nwere allowed to make dances and invite us to go to dances. And of course that meant that\nwe made friends. And they brought the cigarette and brought some food. And they had\nresting groups close to the outskirt of Frielendorf where they could go to the beach too.\nAnd on the beach there was no one allowed to go with them but us. Not the Germans, not\nwho lived there, not nobody but we. So there I will have to tell you first a story because\nthis is a good one. There was a man on the pool side sitting all completely dressed up to\nhis everything on him and was sitting there alone and looking ahead of him and doing\nnothing. And all the rest was enjoying the rest and the sun. So it didn't take too long that\nmy friends were pushing me to go and talk to him. It turned out that he was Ralph Kutz\nfrom Cleveland. He had gas stations. When he had to leave his wife home they had their\nson the day before. He was allowed to go to the hospital to see them once and right after\nthat they got on the ship and went over, shipped out. So he didn't have another chance to\nsee his wife and child but that one, that little son of his. And he was crying on our\nshoulder and we were crying on his shoulder which he felt wonderful about. He never\nhad sisters. His mother always wanted to have daughters and never had. And as we\nbecame more and more friends during the summer he kept coming practically daily to us.\nHe came to ask first of all to try to make a Friday night for him. So he brought everything\nfrom the PX. He brought from the candles fromthe _ everything you name it,\neverything. The soup in the big can. And we had holiday and we were crying into hishandkerchief so he had to buy handkerchiefs and handkerchiefs and handkerchiefs\nbecause we needed lots of handkerchiefs. And we became so close friends that he was\nasking me and my camp sister who was in the same room with me that we should go to\nbe his sisters. Go to live with his mother and he will guarantee he will marry us off. It\nwas awful hard for him to understand that we still hope to see our husbands so we will go\nback to Hungary and not straight to America. And then from Hungary I wrote him and I\ngot married to Andy. Probably not even then but right after that when I was already\npregnant and yes and I asked him if they had any of the baby things left over after that\nfirst baby. I will very appreciate because there's practically nothing available here. Then I\ndidn't hear of them. I knew that in November he went back, he gave address and what not\nand that's where we wrote. And we also sent a picture my girlfriend and me two of us a\npicture. But that was later. Because that ended everything. The package what came in\nwas this large. I was seven months pregnant when that arrived one morning. It was some\n80 pounds, huge. There was one piece on the top of it what was a huge piece which was\nkind of christening outfit. All the rest was packed in a department store. And the\ndepartment store's paper was put on the top of it and they wished well. They sent me a\nrobe, they sent me slippers. And we sent this picture to him. And by then he wrote of\nanother baby. They have the second one. So Andy and I where we started to physically be\nin better shape we bought something but we thought it's a nice gift item and we had\nmailed two of it. One to his mother, and one to his wife. Not ever since then I got a word\nfrom them. Either they got hurt that I want to pay back what they did or God knows what\nnow I don\u2019t know. Or the wife became jealous because seeing our pictures. Now weturned around from what Ralph had seen and I can very well imagine that she did not like\nthat friendship. And since we are not going to become his sisters, I got married and my\ngirlfriend got married the same time, same day under the same __ and we did not go to\nthem. But the man there on that pool side fully dressed because he's an Orthodox Jew he\nwouldn't get undressed.",
        "Q: So you stayed, until -- how long did you stay?",
        "A: Well, it was almost beginning of August when we came home not because we wanted\nto stay --",
        "Q: Right --",
        "A: But because Hungary didn\u2019t ask for us. Now some in our group were from\nYugoslavia. The Yugoslavs had asked for the Jews. And for them buses were given by\nthe army. And somebody, a young officer who wanted to find his relative in\nTheresienstadt, came down to be the head of the group and there was enough room for us\na few from Hungary that wanted to go with them and we could come with them. So we\ncame back home.",
        "Q: So you went back to your town, to your city. What did you find when you got there?",
        "A: First I went to Budapest. And we arrived to Budapest I looked up my cousins and my\naunt\u2019s and uncle\u2019s place. And I saw that my aunt's apartment had a hole on the edge on\nthe corner. But I went up anyway and I found my aunt there and she was screaming your\nfather's home. Now this I did not expect. I had mentioned to you my father was a sick\nman from World War I time. I certainly did not expect him be the survivor. But he was\nthe only survivor. And so next day I got on a train and made it down to my hometown.My father knew of me alive since the spring. They listened to the Red Cross radio and\nsomebody in the city picked up my name and came to tell him. But of course he didn't\nknow that I am coming now. And didn't know if I'm coming at all. He just knew that I'm\nalive. And he was mighty happy that his only daughter was alive.",
        "Q: You just came home and he was there, is that when you --",
        "A: I went to the store. And the store was open. The three old men were there. I stepped\ninto the store and his first question was where did you leave your mother? And the\nsecond was that I'm ashamed to show them that I had arms like that. It was ___ but it\nlooked so good, so healthy like I was full with life. And he was ashamed to tell that I'm\npulled from concentration camp I look so good. He was very happy that I am looking so\ngood.",
        "Q: And then what happened?",
        "A: Then we -- he had already by then invited a lot of people who didn't have home where\nto go home to. And here was his big house and there was nobody in there. Except he\nbrought my aunt down, my mother's sister, to cook for them and clean for them. Because\nin Budapest there was nothing to be eaten. They were hungry. And he thought that he\nalways will be able to make enough in the store that we should have food and all these\npeople put moneys together for my aunt to go to the market and whatever she can buy to\nbuy. And so they were living with her.",
        "Q: What about your husband, your first husband?",
        "A: There was not even a word then about him. Much later --",
        "Q: You still didn't know?\nA: It was in the fall first when somebody came home who told me that he was with him\nbetween Gunskirchen and Mauthausen as they were marching them over Gunskirchen\nand that he looked good and he was in good shape but then next morning the Germans\nmade them get up from that stop where they were resting fast and go. And who did not\nmove fast enough they shot. Nobody could tell me what happened to him. But that was\nthe most probably way that we never heard of him again. And according to all the records\nthat's what happened.",
        "Q: So you stayed 1n your village -- in your town?",
        "A: Yes, with my father. And they wanted me to take over the house, which I couldn\u2019t do.\nI couldn\u2019t. I wouldn't move with him in my mother\u2019s house what was natural for her to\ndo. But then my aunt went home. And one morning when there was market day our old\nmaid came to visit the city to see if somebody is home and when she found me there she\nbegged herself that she doesn't want to get paid just food with us and live with us and she\nwants to come back. And she came back to work for me. We had plenty to work there.\nThe Germans were in that house. First Hungarian officers, then Germans. Then the _.\nThe __ were the underground Hungarian left. And after that the Russians. And the\nRussians were dancing on the top of the table. They pulled out the wood for cooking.\nYou name it, they did quite a job on it. So we had quite a time to clean the house.",
        "Q: You stayed how long?",
        "A: I stayed there until 1950 when all of us then my father's store was nationalized by the\ncommoners. My husband's business was in danger.",
        "Q: So at what point did you remarry?\nA: Oh, '47.",
        "Q: And how did that come about?",
        "A: Andy came home and out of Rosh Hashanah of 1945 the egg farm was about 20 miles\nout of my city. And his brother was already home much earlier. He came home from the\nRussian front with the army and he was it was still wintertime and he was already free\nman there. And then Andy came into the city and went into my father\u2019s store and was\ntelling that he doesn't want to spend the time out there. This is a little room and farming\nleft for them. That it's too little for him alone and not just speaking about his brother. The\nbrother was married by then. He was leave it for his brother out there. He doesn't want to\nstay there. He's looking for a place to stay at so my husband invited him to stay at our\nhouse --",
        "Q: Your father --",
        "A: Has a room there --",
        "Q: Your father?",
        "A: Yeah. And we have a room there and he brought him furniture and it got furnished.\nHis first thing was that he went out and exchanged farm products for glass and they put\nglass into our windows because it was kind of cold in wintertime without windows. And\nthe next thing was that he exchanged something else. It was all exchange there was\nnothing in that part of the world but exchange items. And then my father one nice day\nstood in front of me and said my daughter I want to tell you something. You were not\nsupposed to know about that because the two friends would have been forever enemies if\nthey knew but Andy loved you and he told so to your mother and your mother told himnot to ever mention a word to you because you don't see anybody but poor Andy. It\nwould be just hurting everybody. But I can see my father said to David he will stop and\ntalk to you about it. His wife didn't come home with his child. You're here alone I can see\nthat soon he will talk to you about it. And I tell you I would be very, very happy to know\nthat if I died I have a man like him with you. It didn't matter where I stand. There were\ntwo men who would be happy, my father and Andy, and I cannot be happy anymore in\nthis life. I lost my happiness. So why not? And when soon Andy talked to me I agreed.\nAnd so May of \u201846 we got married and he had only one request to have again a child as\nsoon as possible tells him that he'd like the one already had. That is what he missed. And\nyes quite soon I became pregnant. In April of \u201847 I had my son.",
        "Q: And your son's name?",
        "A: Paul, after my first husband.",
        "Q: And then you stayed in Hungary for --",
        "A: Yes we stayed in Hungary. First we stayed in Hungary, Miskolc until 1950. Then as I\nmentioned to you, my father's business was nationalized. Half of our apartment was taken\naway. And Andy felt that this is the time we escape, we go. So he gave me money that I\nshall buy an apartment no matter what it costs and where it is in Budapest and it is away\nfrom here. That was enough for me. And then we went up to Budapest in October of\n1950 and that was the time when they were putting the people out of their apartments of\ntheir homes. All around us they were stopping during the night, a truck came and just\neverybody went. So we tried that too. We had to fight not only the Nazis, we had to fight\nthe commoners too. My father died in 1955. For our tenth wedding anniversary wedecided we give each other that we are making his stone having the names of everybody\nfrom the two families. And we did. And we had the stones.",
        "Q: This is gravestones?",
        "A: And six weeks later the revolution broke out. And we took advantage of it. We left\nHungary then, \u201856.",
        "Q: And you came to the United States?",
        "A: Yes. We waited a long time in Austria before we could come because we didn't have\nclose relatives here. But then we came here.",
        "Q: The three of you, your husband and your son. And where did you settle first?",
        "A: New York. We had a friend there. And because of that because they tried to make us\nas comfortable as possible and as Jewish ways as possible they didn't let us go out to\nArkansas where the ___ wanted us to go because my husband's diploma was to be\nuseable there much better. He was a Doctorate in Animal Husbandry. On Park Avenue,\non Fifth Avenue there's no animal husbandry, you know. But by the time we settled\nourselves my son became a little American boy and we stayed in New York. And then I\nretired and my husband retired and Paul was already down here since 1969.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do?",
        "A: I did office work always because of that little English what I had it had me not to start\nas a physical worker. And then in \u201868 I got to the Ford Foundation and I was with them\nfor 16 and a half years before I retired.",
        "Q: And then you moved to Washington?\nA: Not then because my husband still worked. He was working until 1986 for the\nDeutsche Bank and then he retired too. Then my son says oh what are you doing still\nthere? Let's go down. And that's when we came down.",
        "Q: Was it hard to adjust to life in the United States?",
        "A: Well, let me put it this way. Not for me because I loved Americans. I mean I had\nmanic everything what was American was okay with me. My husband had a very, very\nhard time and never could go back to his profession, I think of a profession. But he who\nhad a doctorate who could not do anything. Friends here didn't know what to do with it\neither. Should he have known the Ford Foundation would have given him a nice job. And\nhe would have had a gorgeous future being in charge of third world countries\nagricultures. There was lots to do here in New York except nobody knew what to do with\nthis. Yes, we were refugees. We were very proud that nobody gave us anything. We were\na perfect welfare case but we didn't know about it and we didn't want to know about it.\nAnd what I have what you see we the two of us worked together and I don't owe\nanybody, okay? That was very good.",
        "Q: If we can now talk a little bit about the effect of all this. How is this, your experiences\neffected your feelings of being Jewish?",
        "A: I never would have changed out from Judaism. But I did not have anything to do with\nthe religion and a God which let that happen as it was. And I completely lost all interest\nin it. Until my baby first moved in me. That brought me back to it and accepting that\nthere's somebody above us who knows more than we do. No I never really became a\nreligious Jew in that sense. But I know a lot probably more than most of the girls hadknown of religion. My father was very proud of that. He always hoped for a boy and he\ndidn't have a son so he taught me. And he felt good about me knowing some. And I felt\ngood about myself that my grandparents were so happy with me.",
        "Q: You had talked about how your thoughts, you still have thoughts 50 years later about\nyour mother. In any other way has your experience stayed with you in other ways?",
        "A: That experience stays with you forever. You try to forget it. You try to push it out of\nyour mind because you cannot live constantly with this. My husband whenever he had\nheard or seen something. He could not watch on a television a show which started with a\ntrain and that was that for three weeks he had the nightmares. He was yelling and\nscreaming each time he had a cold and he had a real temperature. He was fighting, he was\nseeing himself going through what he went through. He went from Auschwitz to Dachau\nandthe _ people had hurt his back. He went through his own hell. So we had tried to\nnot to talk about it. And definitely did not want to talk about it in front of our child. We\ndid not even know that our child knew where we were before. Until in 1969 the first time\nhe went back to Europe after he finished, graduated from engineering school \u2014",
        "Q: This is your son?",
        "A: The first place he went was Dachau. He stopped in ?Meiningen? and asked our friends\nwho lived there how to go out to Dachau and he went to Dachau next morning. I still to\nthis day I don't know how he knew, who mentioned that in front of him, or who else told\nhim because we certainly did not. I couldn't imagine that I can hurt my child with pain\nlike that I shall be telling all these what I was telling you or even more to him. I wanted\nto save him from that forever. I just couldn't bring myself to talk about that. The first timeI was talking about all that was in 1990 we were sitting in front of the operating room and\nhis father was operated on at Georgetown University Hospital where I first talked to him\nabout where I'd been. He came home once earlier and said I belong to the second\ngeneration and they are encouraging us to ask you to give us oral history. And I jumped\nup from the chair where I was sitting I run out to the kitchen and he knew that he cannot\nask me again about it. It's been much later in the \u201870s sometimes when I first was able to\ntalk to non-Jewish people mentioning where I was. I kind of it just came out of me. It was\nI don't know what I wanted to do with them if I wanted to scare them or what I wanted.\nBut I couldn't say that to anybody who was Jewish. I just didn't want to talk about it at all\nto Jewish people for years and years and years. And when they were talking about the\nHolocaust Museum my husband and I were both dead set against it. I couldn\u2019t see it. I\nstill cannot understand it. I still feel to a certain degree that this is guilt money from the\nAmerican government and from the American Jews. They all feel much easier to put the\nmoneys into something than their hearts. And we will be always different. We cannot be\nunderstood by the Americans, and the Americans cannot be understood by us totally. I\nstill have that bitterness. My -- I had a boss in the end of the \u201850s whose family also\nperished there. And says to me Suzanne you will have to tell me how my relatives\nperished. So at lunchtime when he was sitting on the switchboard and I was brown-\nbagging my lunch and was eating at the desk he said tell me. And so I started to tell him\nthat ?Mr. Rosengarden? I don't know I didn't know your relatives so I don't know how\nthey, I only can tell you what was the average. And I started to tell him and in three or\nfour minutes he stopped me he said Suzanne don't say that it hurts too much. And I thinkthis is what any American Jew feels. I spoke to quite a few just lately who said they don't\nwant to go down to the museum. They don't want to see it. And they don't know nothing\nabout it. There is a lady here who I appreciate very much as an intelligent, deep feeling,\ngood person. A few months ago in somehow it came to me that she was asking about how\nAndy lost his wife. And I said well how, she had ?Steve? on her arm. She looked at me\nand I said don't you know that everyone who went there with child perished? No, I didn't\nknow that. And I became so very, very angry on that that I wanted to organize a seminar\nhere that a few people who I know were survivors should talk to these people. I don't\nwant them to hear all the most awful things. I'm ready to tell them some story which\nprobably makes them even smile sometime. But they should know some of the feelings\nwe went through. They don't want to know it. So that's all I can tell you. Iam not a good\nperson. I am still angry.",
        "Q: Thank you so much for speaking of your experiences. This concludes the interview of\nSuzanne Foldes. It took place on January 25, 1996 in Silver Spring, Maryland. It was\nconducted by Gail Schwartz.",
        "Q: This is tape three side two and we were talking about your feelings and your\nreflections about your experience. You said you're still angry?",
        "A: Yes. I think that's depression which won't leave me until I'm alive. I cannot find\nsolace. Nothing can give me solace. Not Yad Vashem, not this museum, not. __\u2014. None\nof them. None of them is enough. But the one in Yad Vashem would be just the right\nthing to be at. I don't think that these small little things are not breaking it up, making itless a whole tragedy. Make it small tragedy. Make it something what where justice\nappear.",
        "Q: You had talked earlier about how devastated you were about what happened to your\nmother and this other person helped you, looked out for you. After that what kept you\ngoing? What do you think kept you going through this terrible, terrible time?",
        "A: There's only one thing I can tell you, what I told the people around me. I was trying to\nkeep them alive. I kept telling them that think about it as a badly administered |\nexcursion. We were through with it, we will get through with it. It's just ugly and we have\nto be in it now. But we will get out of it. And I did believe that if you let yourself go, you\ncannot live. And the only way to do it is if you keep yourself clean and clean and clean.\nWash as much as you can. Clean as much as you can. That's the only thing. It's not\neating, it's cleanliness. Because once you get lice you go. In our room in the camp which\nwas the outskirts I mean the outer-lager of Buchenwald we had this little lady, the rabbi's\nwife, she kept on her head a turban constantly. Never removed it, never washed. It was\nfull with lice. And we just decided that we won\u2019t get in danger because of her. And we\ndecided she was never out working. She never came out. Somehow, I don't know how,\nshe managed that she never had to come out. And we decided in the factory that we are\ngoing to take home some what\u2019s the, it\u2019s a fluid what you clean with, petrol. Petrol from\nthe factory and we will wash her head with it. And we did. And we threw away her\nturban and she was screaming. And she thought about it and we got another turban for\nher and we washed her. Now that's the only, only, only way you could stay alive. And\nwhat kept you alive. And of course I had my aunt there. Not that I loved her so dearly,but she was still the sister of my father. So you wanted to take care of her. You wanted to\nbring her home. And I did.",
        "Q: Did you form any close friendships with people, not your relatives, but new --",
        "A: Oh yes. There were two ladies, who I became very close friend of. The one I mention\nto you as a lager-sister who got married the same day I did. And she lived in our house\nuntil she got married. And another one who was a her husband and family had a bakery in\nMiskolc and she was -- she was a strange lady. She was not well educated but she had\nsuch a smooth way of being friend. Probably she was too feminine to that I would today\nthink about her that I want her for friend, and I would have rather second thought that\nprobably she was lesbian. She was that kind of lady. But then she was very good to be a\nfriend there. We were carrying the bombs together and we were remembering old songs,\nold poems. We had to use our praise, you know. That was also very important. We were\ntrying the \u2014_s~ whatever we needed to remember things. And she was good for that.",
        "Q: Are there any sounds or smells that bring thoughts back to you?",
        "A: That bitter almond. There\u2019s a drink which 1s made of an almond flavor. I can't take it.\nAnd of course I never learned how to wash something clean white. Everything becomes\ngray in my hand. And I was washing there and all my fingers were bleeding but I couldn't\nmake it white. There are two things my mother never made me learn around the\nhousehold to wash an item. She said for that you always will have somebody do it for\nyou. How wrong she was. But everything else she wanted me to know how to give\norders. She said you cannot give orders unless you knew how to do it. And she always\nexpected me to just to be ready to give orders.\nQ: Do you get reparations?",
        "A: No. I got a very little in the late 50's or early 60's. A minimal amount was given and\nsince then whenever I asked I was negated fast. There was no words of something\nsomebody was telling us that there is something being now given. But I didn't even go to\nmake a telephone call to ask about it. I'm not interested anyway. It hurts too much when\nthey say oh you don't. Why? Because again still the Germans are deciding. And then\nthere's always a group of Jews who are serving them very well, you know. Just like they\nwere in Hungary when the Germans came in and the Jews were congregations giving out\nnames, giving out who is the rich out of them, you name it, everything. They gave the\nsynagogue buildings for them to horde all the goods, the silvers, and the golds. There\nalways will be Jews who are serving the Germans. They usually will be Germans Jews\nthough.",
        "Q: Is there any message you want to leave your family with, your grandchild? Anything\nspecial?",
        "A: My grandchild is a wonderful child. The child of a non-Jewish mother who two years\nago was his father and I were talking about something and his father was saying that only\nthe two of us will be there who were born Jewish. Well, he meant me. And my grandson\nchimed in and me. He feels Jewish when he's with us. He's always spending the holidays\nwith us. And then he spends the other holidays with his mother at her house and the\ngrandparent's house. He's a sweetheart, he loves us dearly. I never talked to him about all\nthis. I didn't dare and I was not encouraged later. However he was here a few months ago.\nAnd God knows how, he said something where I said did you go to see Schindler's List?And he said yes. And then he was completely wiped out by it. And I dared to ask which I\nhad asked his father sometimes ago and he does not have the nerve to face the holocaust\nmuseum either. And I asked Michael and he said no he would like to go and want to go\nwith his father. So I said if he wants to go would you tell me about it. And I asked if his\nschool shouldn't go and he said it's a good idea probably it should. But then since then I\nhaven't spoken to him about that. It felt good that now I know that he was. When his\nfriends were bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs and we kept going to them. His father was\nasking me if he doesn't want to become this, then his grandfather was still alive. And he\nsaid to his father that he would have nothing against it except going up there. I just have\nto accept it this way. It hurts. He got the bigger birthday present on his 13th. We had\ngiven to him with telling him that if he was now Jewish he would have a mark on his\nbirthday but without that a Jewish boy is bar mitzvah at 13 no matter what.",
        "Q: Is there anything you'd like to add before we finish? Any thought, final thought?",
        "A: No, I don't melt away. I don't want to melt away now. Thank you very much.",

But\nmy father's partner, himself and his daughter and son-in-law, all changed with no help.\nOf course none came back. But that was the first step.

How would a \u2014\nidea. This idea came back just before they took us to the brick factory. We got a note\nfrom my uncle from Budapest that he can send somebody for us who could take us to\nthem and we shall consider going, and my mother said, I'm not going to go nowhere.

You were going to be killed slowly with not eating,\nwith not having drinking water. You will die out. This camp was when they needed\nworkers somewhere this is where they came to get them together from and this is how\none escaped from there. And during the times where while we were there there were\nother people who worked and mostly men who were crossing our camp going from work\nto camp or the other way around. And during that time of course you kept yelling and\ncalling out names so I was calling my husband's name out, his brother's name out, my\nfather-in-law's, my father's name. And then a little paper came sometimes was thrown\nover to me by somebody who said no they are not here but Andrew Freed is here, who\nbecame my second husband. And he was looking for of course all of his family. And then\nmy father-in-law's store manager was there. Sent me a message that he's there. But our\nfolks were not there. They were gone straight -- my father-in-law, mother-in-law. The\nmen were not there. They did not get there yet. Rather didn't get there period because\nthey did not go to Auschwitz. So I was there until August 2nd and the last week of that\nwas when they killed the gypsy camp. We were standing outside on Appell and the sky\nwas yellow and red and the screaming was just unbelievable. They were throwing them\nas people tell us living into the fire. And then came the morning when Mengele and some\nthree other officers came to and stopped at every block, barrack and pulled out certain\npeople to work and the other one was left behind. So I was very light body all my life. I\nwas very thin. So sure enough the first thing was that I was left behind. Everybody from\nmy line, my first cousin and my aunt and my first cousin's two sister-in-laws, a youngerone and a grown up, were in my line. They all went to work and I was staying behind. So\nI got back into my dress ran over to another barrack --",

But 70 was not allowed to\ncome out from there. They stayed there in that room and right there they were gassed.\nYou know that this is the same place you can either throw in gas or you give shower.\nMost comes from the same. So then we were given uniform --",

You tried to do like you're\nworking. Then when there was no work whatsoever inside then they made me and a few\nothers build roads. So we were having this little carriages taking the stones, throwing it\nout, other ones started to put them down. The third one had to go through with that\nmusher, which mushed the roads. But that was no work either because there was no need\nfor that road. There was no need to do anything there, but they made you do something.",

And who did not\nmove fast enough they shot. Nobody could tell me what happened to him. But that was\nthe most probably way that we never heard of him again. And according to all the records\nthat's what happened.",
        "Q: So you stayed 1n your village -- in your town?",

There are two things my mother never made me learn around the\nhousehold to wash an item. She said for that you always will have somebody do it for\nyou. How wrong she was.

        "A: Was Morway [ph].",
        "A: In Miskole [ph], Hungary.",
        "A: June 23rd, 1921.",
        "A: It was a very small family. I was a only child. My father then already came back\nfrom two years of World War I in Russia, and after that two years as POW. My mother\nwas from the other part of Hungary and they got married right after World War I where\nthe country was split between two parts, Communist part and a non-Communist part.\nAnd they had to start all over after that again. But they had been very successful. My\nfather as a businessman was very, very well off.",
        "A: They had men clothing which entailed tailoring which entailed upper coats and suits\nof every fashion. Not [haphhazard ?] like here. That was the line of my first husband'sfamily. But they were strictly men clothing and they were three partners to it, three\nyoung men who learned the trade together and at the same place and became very good in\nthe trade.",
        "A: Middle class, and my father was really a self-made man. He was the son of a [sem?]\nreligious teacher who had a lot of children and constantly moving on from one place to\nthe other where there were enough Jewish boys to teach and prepare. So while my father\nwas the oldest boy, he went out and had no chance of education, formal education, but he\nwas working only that his younger brothers all should have and he was able to give that\nto them and was always [shortening?] the whole family. Not that it meant too much of a\n-- how should I say -- really not miss anything because of that. It was different in my\nmother's parents' case. My mother's parents were the richest wholesalers in Watz [ph]\nwhere they lived, which changed drastically in the 1930s when my mother's sister\nmarried a man who ruined the families, so much so that they left the town and moved up\nto Budapest and didn't want to be seen and known by nobody that they are having\nfinancial problems they didn't have because their sons and daughters made sure that they\nshould not miss anything, but, of course, they were not in the way they used to be and\nthey were suffering -- they were ashamed not to live the life what originally was meant to\nbe lived by them.",
        "A: It was 60,000 population, which came -- became later 100,000 with the outer parts\ngrowing into it. The -- the Jewish community had different synagogues, from orthodox\nto where the rabbi only spoke Yiddish, to another one which had a rabbi who had the\ndoctorate and spoke Hungarian, and the third one which was so religious a small-town\nreligious like Southmar [ph] is and they lived separately in their own little ghetto within\nit. Within the --",
        "A: My father's family lived there. He had sisters and brothers and, of course, the sisters'\nand brothers\u2019 children.",
        "A: Not really. Not really. But yes, of course, we went to visit them in the synagogue.\nYes, we met them time to time. Of course we went to visit at their house. But it was not a\nclose relationship. My mother and her in-laws were just fine but in a cool way. It never\nwarmed up to a level where they were really fine with their family, and so, of course, I\nwas not part of the family there.",
        "A: We had strictly orthodox kosher house, but it was mainly to in respect of the parents\nwho wouldn't have eaten otherwise at our house. And then I was 17 and both of my setof grandparents died within a year. After that it was still kosher because they were used\nto having their ways, but it was no such thing anymore that I couldn't bring into the house\nsomething what before couldn't be brought in.",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "A: Yes. Well, observe Shabbat, yes, but my father's store was open. It wasn't open only\non [shoppershu] and the three days of the high holidays. Yes, my --",
        "A: There was -- there was in -- not Hebrew school, but in the regular school where we\nwent we had a teacher come in and give us twice-a-week religious lessons which was not\ntaken too seriously, neither by the congregation to send a proper teacher, nor the children\nwho, of course, went as much for it as the families went for it. But it was more than the\nAmerican children had.",
        "A: No, none was public school. I first -- elementary school I went to the Jewish\nelementary, which was huge. It was for 1,000 children, which meant up to six grades\nthey had. I went there four grades and from there I went to the Protestant gimnazium\nbecause that was the school to go to. The Jewish children had to pay double of thequarter. The Catholics one-and-a-half times only. But we were different, definitely\ndifferent, but we were allowed to go at least.",
        "A: Well, it depended on classes.",
        "A: My class, out of the 50 we had 18 Jewish girls and we were fighting because by the\ntime we grew -- we were growing into first [Jewish low Hitler] and some girls in the\nsummer went to Germany to camp, others had the Nazis of Hungary with rings on their\nhand and we were fighting fistfights with them. [They have -- with their debt].",
        "A: The friends were Jewish.",
        "A: Not true, because I did have one or two non-Jewish friends, but they were not that\nclose because the children could have been very close and we went to school together and\neverything was fine, but the parents of that group did not really want their daughters to\nmix so much with the Jews, so we were not kept very close with them.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It's a very mixed neighborhood.",
        "A: Actually there was no problem where we lived until 1944 when they pushed us in the\nghettoes.",
        "A: Oh, God knows. I wouldn't have called it hobbies.",
        "A: I believe that my life is depending on that we go to the Olympics. I was a sports\nperson and yes, I was prepared for the 1936 Olympics and Hitler didn't want me.",
        "A: Gymnastics.",
        "A: Very, very seriously, and I was very talented too.",
        "A: No, but I belonged to a sport club of which teacher was my teacher at school, too, so\nwe were just going into that and get all the meets what sportsmen have right there. We\nhad sports clubs there. We had training grounds there.",
        "A: I was.",
        "A: Yes, but it was unorthodox way because the Girl Scouts were not supposed to have\nJews, but the Girl Scout leader, the teacher leader, wanted me to go along with them\nbecause I was so good and I was ready to pull the kids up if they had difficulty going up\non a mountainside, so I was with them.",
        "A: An unofficial member, because officially I couldn't be. A Jew couldn't be.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "A: Probably didn't even realize that that's holding me back from anything, because it\ndidn't hold me back. It was probably more showing that my friends are in Jewish\ncommunities and not there, but I was really comfortable until I -- I was part of it.",
        "A: I have in my memory a picture what I will never forget. My father sitting on the side\nof his bed going to sleep and on eleven o'clock the evening when the radio came through\nthat Hitler became --",
        "A: -- the chancellor, and I can hear his voice clearly: \"That's the end for us.\" And that\nmemory is so clear in my mind. I can see him in his underwear. This is the nightshirt.\nClearly, clearly see him.",
        "A: He made this as a statement to my mother and me as we were listening to the radio.\nCame through and --",
        "A: I am sure we were talking a lot about him and everything.",
        "A: Not then. Not --",
        "A: Not at that early age, but later when I was listening to his tirades.",
        "A: On the radio.",
        "A: I started to speak German before I spoke Hungarian because my father felt that a\nperson is as many persons as languages he speaks. So they spoke to me in German only\nuntil I was five. Of course I understood in the meantime Hungarian because we had a\nmaid. We had this coming to the house, that coming to the house, but they weren't\ntalking to me in Hungarian until I was five, so by the time I go to school I should be\nreally good by children and I should speak that language too.",
        "A: Yes. Although the second grade we speak -- picked up German and then, of course, in\ngimnazium we picked up right away German as first grade, and the third grade French,\nand I had also private instruction by then in French, and at 16 I started to learn English,\nBritish English, and in the meantime I had Latin, too, under -- in everything from fifth\ngrade to eighth and we had [???] all three languages -- or four languages: Hungarian,\nGerman, French and Latin.",
        "A: -- except that around us there were already ugly happenings.",
        "A: Where we were very aware of.",
        "A: A good friend of our son, who right now lives in Syracuse and he is now 85, 86, was\nable yet to get to the University in Debrecen and he may have said something, I don't\nknow anymore how it started, but a boy who -- whose family turned much earlier, so he\nfelt that he is not a Jew, said something of humor, [???] and he gave the guy a slap in his\nface. They threw him off from the university. And his father, who was so proud that his\nson was able to make it, got a heart attack on that account and died. So, yes, that was\nquite close. And yes, the -- by the time we were 15, 16, and started to go with boys who\nwere older than us and they couldn't go to the university or they were in law school, and\nthat was a lesser degree school than the other universities were. They already had\nproblems and the first Jewish laws started to come in effect in 1938. It was already time\nwhen a lot of this was -- had to let go from companies because it had to be just a\npercentage of Jews. And from there on it was coming closer and closer.",
        "A: In '38, not yet.",
        "A: But by 1940, '41 it was affected. They did not get all the merchandise they wanted to\nbuy. Not everybody was allowed to sell, and once the war broke out, it was a goodexcuse why they are excluding some but why is less merchandise available, so the Jews\nshould be getting less. The real problems came in 1942 when -- in 1940, first my father\nwas to go to work camp, but that was a very minor and --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Most probably, yes, but I cannot now tell you when I --",
        "A: When and how.",
        "A: But it was with me. I knew about it later. But again, it was something awful\nhappening somewhere very far. The closer the more vivid, tragic effects came when\nHitler came into Vienna and the Viennese Jews, who were original from Hungary, tried\nto come back and came back in droves and were telling us what's happening there and --\nor so they couldn't go back.",
        "A: By then we were very involved and we tried to help these people and we made --\ninstead of the winter balls and the musicals and big entertainments, we started to get\nmonies together, help them to get the people who did not have a trade to learn a trade so\nthey should be able to make it, and we tried to help them. From there on we were\nactively trying to help them.",
        "A: And there were always more and more to be helped. Plus more and more people were\ntaken out to work camps. First inside Hungary to work, which is -- entailed road building\nand you name everything what was not meant for a Jew to do, and later they took them\nout to go out to Poland and Russia with the armies and, of course, many, many stayed\nthere forever.",
        "A: In 1938, September Ist --",
        "A: '39. Excuse me. Sure. '39. I was glued to the radio and listened to Italian news\nbecause that -- I could get Milano on my radio and I was translating from the Italian,\nwhich was so close to my Latin, which I knew then very well, to the family what the rest\nis talking about. Yes, we were very aware of it, and few days later the Polish people\nstarted to come through. We had taken in people from the street.",
        "A: Into the house.",
        "A: It was a big apartment house, but it was a low -- 'cause the wall side was always a\nhuge apartment and the side was smaller apartments.",
        "A: I like it.",
        "A: We found a family, a (inaudible) who came with a young boy whom they didn't know\nwhose child he was, only he was a private child on the road. And they picked him up and\nit was -- they were -- the woman wanted to give us some gold items of what she was\ncarrying in gratefulness that we let her have a bath and the child and change and wash\ntheir things. They had nothing but what they had on them. They were running. Most of\nthem didn't want to stop before Paris. They wanted to go at least that far, that smartly,\nbut they were coming in droves. There were thousands and thousands of people. And\nthe stories what they had to tell was just plain unbelievable. And there were a few earlier\nwho came over from that area, which is outside of the Hungarian border towards the east,\nwhich was [routine?] land, halfway belonging sometimes to Romania, sometimes to\nPoland, and this was very orthodox Jews, so it was a pocket of very orthodox Jews lived\nthere, and they slowly started to come over into safer place as Hungary was. At this point\nnow they started to get them together who wasn'ta citizen and were tossing them out\nof the border. And the stories what we heard that they are putting them right to death.\nAnd some girl, she was around 19, saw her family being killed and she was -- she --\nshe fled because she was so afraid of what -- and realized later that she's [laying down? |\nunder the bodies and she was able to come back to tell all this. But again, if you asked\nmy father or anybody in our [?], that cannot happen to us because we are Hungarians. Wehad put together the citizenship papers, this kind of paper, that kind of paper. We were\nalmost as proud of being Hungarian than the Mayflower Americans.",
        "A: No. He never did. Never consider leaving. I wish they did. My mother wanted once\nand not because of that. He had -- she had absolutely no such bad feelings about it, but\nthen the American [?vertswere?] was in 1938, '36? I wouldn't know now.",
        "A: Probably '36.",
        "A: She wanted to come over. She wanted to see that because she really liked the idea\n(inaudible) and my father said, my wife will be there working there for others.\n[?quona?], what kind of -- never anything happened to it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But I was not in school anymore, then I also had to learn a trade because it became --",
        "A: In 1939.",
        "A: Because it became clear that even if they -- my parents could find -- and my mother\nhad found -- somebody who was in big job and could bring me into the academy, theywould kill me in a year because they would just not let me live there. They would just\nmake me overdo it and my life was in danger if I went there. So I just had to give up.\nAnd then --",
        "A: Okay. Sorry.",
        "A: Oh, it was a pain. It was a --",
        "A: I was trained at that same year that -- not the same year. The year before there was a --\nthat club which I belonged to became 150 years old and one of the arch princes came\nfrom -- from -- (inaudible) came for whom we had to make a big show. Everybody was\nto get a golden --",
        "A: -- medal. And they were saying there loud that everybody who participated got a gold\nmedal and then -- that was early summer and we already went back to school and there\nwas nothing of it. It turned out that for the Jews they didn't give the medal. Jews couldn't\nget it. So, no, it was a pain. And yes, it brought the action, of course, and I didn't want to\nparticipate anymore in any of the game, but because I was a good friend with this teacher\nwho was our coach, I still did and I still did everything mature, but the feeling wasn't in\nthere anymore.",
        "A: It was -- the trade was fitting into our future. The \u2014 my first husband's family, as I\nmentioned, he was in (inaudible) shirt business, so I learned how to make custom-made\nshirts, pajamas, elegant underwear for men, and I went through that so if --",
        "A: No. There was a school, but beside the school you had to go for one year into a shop\nto learn the trade and you had to --",
        "A: No. During the year when you went to the shop, every second afternoon I had to go\nfor two hours to the school too, but that was it.",
        "A: Not even serious thing. It was just telling you what a worker is expected to do.",
        "A: Oh, yes. And my first husband, we were in love. I think I was 16-and-a-half when I\nmet him.",
        "A: In the first ball that I was introduced, after midnight, the midnight dance, five young\nmen came over, were introduced by one of them who knew me, and out of the five, two\nbecame my husband.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I got married.",
        "A: First of all, the first change that might interest you was 1940 when my father was\ntaken to this work camp I mentioned to you.",
        "A: Which was only for a summer long, and the C.O. was my Latin and history teacher,\nwho was really very nice gentleman and was suffering from this idea that he has to be\nnow bossing this all Jews. These men were already in the late fifties. What they were\nthere for, 1t was not for work. They were just there to be killed and the put-down, the\nshame on them. Nothing else. (Pause.)\n(Tape one, side two.)",
        "A: We kept going with him. It was some 60 miles from where we lived.",
        "A: 1940. Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Practically nothing. It was just to sit around in a dusty place, to stand up and stay at\nthe (inaudible) -- and sit --they were really just annoying the people and didn't let them\ndo what they wanted to do, they supposed to do in their own businesses. Just pulled out.",
        "A: Well, we tried to keep it according to their orders moving on. They have plenty of\ngood and dependable employees to run it, and it didn't last long. It was some six weeks I\n(inaudible) told you about, but it was something what you don't forget 'cause the little\npeasant man who's now -- God knows what kind of rank he has. He is so old. He doesn't\nknow what to -- who these people are. He only knows that I am now in charge to tell\nthem that now it's time to go to sleep and now to wake up and now make your bed and\nthings what they haven't done already for last 30 years or so.",
        "A: Hatvan, H-A-T-V-A-N.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yes. I lived home until I got married, then actually even after that because --",
        "A: 1942.",
        "A: March of 1942.",
        "A: We were already restricted. If -- I couldn't go to the university. If I had to work now\nas -- near what the sewing machine, that was not what I was made up for, made for.",
        "A: No, not --",
        "A: No, not that yet. You see, the war did not start seriously while the Germans went\nahead. The problems --",
        "A: I think another Jewish law came which made things a little bit more insecure, but\nagain, this -- all these was not affecting me, the girl, in that comfy home. And having my\nhusband then, we were very optimist. Very, very optimist.",
        "A: Paul Barkovich (sp).",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we stayed living at home because -- because of the war. There were no more\nbuildings going on, so there was no apartment available. And my in-laws gave us a lot\non which the two boys -- they had two sons -- should build for themself modern homes as\nthe war comes to an end, and again it's a possibility which we could comfortably wait out\nin my parents' house. And we lived there together with them.",
        "A: But six weeks after my wedding they took my father out now, and now they took all\nthese -- all the men -- not only all the men, all the professional people and the business \u2014\nthe better business people. The ranked business, because we are ranking everything.\nThere's a layer up there and another layer and a third layer. So not the -- not to(inaudible) to camp. (Inaudible) state. The bosses went to camp, but now they were\ntaking them out to [?] and they did not come back for another 16 months. After 16\nmonths, we were able to pull enough strings to bring the older ones together. My father\nwas the 58 and close to 60. What do they want to do to these men? And then --",
        "A: Yes. These -- these Hungarian peasants who were now over them, who were giving\nrank and they were -- how should I put it -- put in charge over them kept coming back\nhome for a visit to the officer's house. The officers should -- and each time we were able\nto bribe them to bring letters and to bring them letters and also some food and some\nclothing when winter came. I mean, when they went away it was June. They called them\nin in May, and I think by June 10th they were not in the country. And some of them, the\nyounger professionals in one group, were sent straight to -- oh, God. Now you better stop\nthat machine because -- so these young professionals were [state?] sent on minefields\ninstead of [dogsaur].",
        "A: Yes, he was in barmitzva (inaudible) in the Ukraine.",
        "A: We tried to run the business and, of course, these ladies never had any word in the\nbusiness, so whatever they did and whatever -- the way they had seen life, because youcould not -- and these -- our three old men would never have thought of holding back\nmerchandise, not to sell it, to keep the money's value, and, of course, the ladies were\nhappily selling out everything and then when they couldn't get merchandise for it, then\nmy mother's brother came down, who was the lawyer, anyway lived in Budapest, and\nthey made a deal with him that he's buying a condominium apartment in Budapest on that\nmoney so the value. When the old men came home and heard about that, they were, how\ncan you do such a thing? They ruin the business. They were running four stores. My\nparents' business was such that they were the first chain store in this line. They had\nstores in three different cities in the -- in Hungary too. So they just couldn't believe that\nwhat the -- what these women are thinking, and, of course, they -- they were not how --\nthey were too honest, too straight to know how -- how to live during war time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We were able to do everything.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: They took over and they just lived their life the way that they meant to supposed to do.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, and I was there with him.",
        "A: Sure. Sure. Except that, you know, but you're talking about getting news or what's\nhappening somewhere. Yes, you hear about everything, but history is being painted\ndifferently by different people. If you pick up two history books, they will not see the\nsame thing. And so we did not get only what the Germans allowed to get and the\nHungarians allowed to get, except when I was -- as told you, when you listen to Free\nEurope, you practically play with your freedom because if they catch you on it, then they\njail you, but that was the only way to try to get some information, and that information\nwas not true information either. That was propagandA: So we -- we pedaled through\nthat.",
        "A: Now comes 1944, and 1944 was quite a year. What I didn't tell you, that very soon\nafter I got married I became pregnant, and my husband, rest in peace, was so smart. He\nsaid, we have plenty of time. We are so young. I don't want you to have a child and\nleave it here and I being taken out. I don't want to leave a war widow and this child goes.\nSo my father's peasant soldier who was coming back from the front was asked by my\nfather to see us all, that he wants him to bring picture of all of us, not picture picture, but\nthat he spoke to us, each and every one of us. So because I was in bed, they had to bring\nhim up to my house, and my father kept asking enough questions from that man that what\nthe man didn't know why I'm in that bed. He figured out and wrote us back awful letter,\nwhat did I dare to do. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that we went through that, too.\nMy husband has a sixth sense that this is not the time. Then while my father was still out\nthere, the Italians had stepped out of the war, and that brought to us hope that now they're\nfalling apart and now we don't have to hold out too much longer. Still nobody, so -- and\nnobody could imagine that the Germans coming, and even if they coming that they can\ndo anything to us. So when they came in on March 19th and they arrived, we were very\norganized. They organized the Jewish leaders of the city to give them names. Theyorganized the Jewish (inaudible) to tell them that there's nothing to worry about and they\nare having guarantees that we just give the Germans every half and nobody will bother\nus. And then they needed apartments and we were put into the ghetto, and in the ghetto a\nofficer of the army who was in charge of this work camps came into the ghetto and pulled\nall these men out hoping that if he puts them in the camp that we're safe then. And he\nknew that the best will be taken out from the country and he hoped that with these he\nsaves them they can stay in the country, and he did. He did it quite wrong from May to\nDecember when [sourshit] took over, and then when in Budapest they found the last ones\nand pulled them altogether, he helped them to safe places.",
        "A: In May.",
        "A: Tragedy, tragedy, tragedy. We were very, very scared. But again, the scariness of it\nwas that they are there. The scariness of it was that they can do harm to people, that they\ncan -- there. (Inaudible) there. But that they can't take out somebody from the country\nbut still did not.",
        "A: Just did not come to possibilities. Not the very latest from the city ghetto, from where\nmy mother, my father, and my husband was taken out now. Mostly women stayed\nbehind were taken out now to a outside-of-the-city ghetto, which was a brick factory, and\nin that brick factory they not only made us wait, but they pulled altogether from thewhole area. So some 60,000 Jews were taken out from Miskolc from that brick factory to\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: Almost two months.",
        "A: No, no, no, that was less. Probably just about five weeks, but during that time the\ngendarmerie was beating all of the Jews, the secrets where they had put their monies and\nthe --",
        "A: And that was everyday affair that they did not come out alive from there, and some\nwho knew that they could not handle that killed themself before going in there.",
        "A: No, and that was strange, because somebody from that office, which was right across,\nas we kept hearing the screaming from there, came over and my father became so scared\nthat he got the diarrhea and was sitting in an outhouse, and they went by and pulled the\npeople from the next two buildings. Nice memories.",
        "A: The first ghetto in the city was that very, very just Jewish area, so my father had a\nfriend who had a house nearby that some eight families went to live with that family.",
        "A: I don't know. Lot of things from grits to coats to summer wear to -- it was spring, so\nyou needed sweaters, summer wear. You name it, we were taking it. Then somebody\ncame in there and said that you cannot use that here. There's no room here. Give it to me.\nI -- trust me, I keep it for you. Which, of course, they didn't, but they took it from our\nhand not to have our hand over strength used. The -- these people who had to live there\ntogether, that means that two, three family in one room of the apartment, one corner, this\nfamily live on this mattress. That family live -- it was not fun.",
        "A: Yes, at the beginning, but that was very short time because I said the two men had\nbeen taken out but the other families' men went too then, and probably another week or\nso we lived there with less people, but again, with jittery nerves because the one\nbathroom really couldn't take care of all of us comfortably.",
        "A: Yes, inside there, in the ghetto, but outside of the ghetto you didn't go there and\n(inaudible). I went with my husband from this first ghetto to agricultural work. The city\nhad a gardening establishment and we were given them to garden there and --",
        "A: Yeah. Sometimes we were -- sometimes we were to pick flowers in the flower area,\nand during the time when I was in one of the parks where we were supposed to work but\nwe hever got to it, the American came with a (inaudible) from one end of the city to the\nother and we were the one which they bombed. They missed the -- the train station and\nthey missed the -- what establishment was that? It was something what was for the army.\nSome big building. So they missed that, too, but they --",
        "A: -- but they had gotten us, and one of the young girls from our group was pulled\ndifferent little pieces. But again, there I (inaudible) my husband wasn't there. Then I was\nout of the alarm and we were turning the dirt, he was still with us. That wasn't near to the\nstation, the train station.",
        "A: And then we went to that brick factory.",
        "A: They took us on the morning on June 6th when the Normandy --",
        "A: And so the people yelled in that you don't have to hold out too much longer. The\nAmericans are staying. But we didn't have the time. Now, many people were able to\nescape from there, and earlier from that --",
        "A: -- city ghetto, even from brick factory, and when I first mentioned it to my father,\nactually we were 1n our apartment yet because the first question came up. People were\nturning Catholic in big numbers.",
        "A: Oh, about eight, ten miles.",
        "A: Walked.",
        "A: Walked through the city. Walked through the city.",
        "A: Some very happily, some less happily. As I said, some yelled in that it won't take too\nlong and don't worry, but others, well, quite happy.",
        "A: Only as much as you were able to carry, so there is already some pasta, some dried\npasta, because what are we going to eat? Potato we find somewhere and we put a little\npasta in it and we make soup and we live on it. Very little else.",
        "A: The valuables were taken off us before we went. In that city ghetto they took the last\nones off us.",
        "A: I don't know. I really don't know.",
        "A: I don't know. I don't think so.",
        "A: Well, she was a young woman. She was healthier and better looking than I was ever\nand -- but when we arrived to Auschwitz where we unpacked, she said, we don't survive\nthis one. I said oh, yes, mom, we will. She said that well.",
        "A: It was plain awful. It was just you sit in the dust. The brick stands there to dry. That\nmakes you have walls, and above it it's empty and the air flies through and the flies fly\nthrough and God knows what smells fly through. Here you are already in big, biggroups, and my second husband's first wife and child was there. The baby was then\nabout 16 months old and heavy. So he survived sometimes with caring (inaudible) and\nthe mother-in-law picked him up, then the other sister-in-law helped, we went over to\nhelp. And it was no life anymore. But I still had cigarettes in there.",
        "A: Scared. And the ones who had more -- more smell -- smell than they gave somebody\nsomething what they still had with value and left. And left us there. It was awful stupid -\n- how should I put it to you? It 1s possible thing not to try to escape because what worse\ncan happen to you? They grab you and put you on other end.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: I asked my mother. I found a [shawndar?] who would have helped and she said, what\nwill your mother -- your father say? Your father said that we cannot go, and so we stay --\nwe Stay together.",
        "A: About six to eight days only.",
        "A: June 6th we went, and on June 12th they packed us, so exactly six days.",
        "A: They were coming in [shawndars?] and pushing us into one direction and we were at\nthe train.",
        "A: It was not a train station. It was the train which could come in into the brick factory.",
        "A: It was nothing serious. We went then together in it, then they pushed it out to the\nregular station.",
        "A: There was only one kind of train there.",
        "A: Yes, (inaudible). Yes.",
        "A: By the time we got to the railroad station we were already thirsty and were begging\nfor water, and the friends of ours sister and her family were in that same (inaudible) who\nwas -- who had diabetes and we had seen her without food there going through all the\nworst way you can see somebody slowly dying.",
        "A: (No audible response. )",
        "A: Mostly women, because a lot of men were taken, but really it was not a special train\nfor women only and men only were separated.\nEnd of File One\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: Over two days. It was a very long trip.",
        "A: No. We were sure we are probably going to the other side, western side of Hungary.\nThat's where we are going to work. Then when they took us through the border, it must\nbe here somewhere in Germany they will need us on the west. Again thought went west,\nnever thought of going toward east now. And there was the train stopped and we were at\nZakopane. Did you hear that name? That was the Czech Alps most beautiful ski area\nwhere you only wanted to go in style. That was a luxury to go to Zakopane. I looked up\nat my mother and I said we come back here once on our own.",
        "A: That was something that you cannot ___. _It was just plain awful. 120 people in that\ntrain in the summer. With the one -- what do they call that ==? What was for\neverybody to --",
        "A: Bucket.",
        "A: I don't think so. I think that probably you could only say that they were trying to suffer\nas quietly as possible not to bother the next one. I don't think that there was anything we\ncould really help each other with. The most was that if somebody still probably had some\nwater from somewhere and somebody was so sick that they were yelling and screaming\nfor something then probably they were able to wash his face probably. More than that\nthere was not a chance to do for anybody anything.",
        "A: Plenty. Plenty. From tiny little ones to teenagers or every kind. Every age group what\nyou can imagine just haphazardly thrown together.",
        "A: Yes. We were next to each other all our lives. She was my best friend. I didn't need\ngirlfriends or such because she was everything for me. She was young and beautiful and\nunderstanding and full with interest.",
        "A: Oh yes. Very much --",
        "A: Oh yes. She was with me all the way, every step of it. Oh yes.",
        "A: Decision --",
        "A: Well, yes. There was only one non-Jewish doctor anymore in town who was ready and\nwilling to have Jewish women to get rid of their pregnancies. All the Jewish\ngynecologists were already out in Russia or Poland, or they didn't live anymore. And so\none friend of mine who needed this kind of help was giving me the word that this was the\nman to turn to. And yes he was very decent and willing. That it did not work out so well\nthat that was my private --",
        "A: Yeah, that was bad luck.",
        "A: Yes. My mother was taking care of everything. She was there and she was with me.",
        "A: Nothing on the train. I only remember clearly when we arrived to Auschwitz and they\nwere unpacking us that she said we won't survive that one.",
        "A: They were throwing you out. First you the person and then the packages came after.\nThat would stay to the Canada. But we didn't know that and --",
        "A: No. We had no idea what that is. We just read the --",
        "A: We knew that this is going to be a work camp because it said \"arbeit macht frei\".",
        "A: But as I said, my mother fell on the right side behind -- now again I can't remember\nthe most easiest word. They were people who looked like they were crazy. We thought\nthat probably these are moved over to that side, they are wearing this uniform --",
        "A: Yeah. Right across us as we were on this --",
        "A: On the other side of the rail. These people were yelling and screaming that to my\nmother that you should put a scarf on your head. I don't understand that they tell you to\nput -- I wouldn't be crazy enough -- it's hot enough in this coat because she was wearing a\nheavy coat. Her hair here up front started to gray. She had that little gray on there. And\nthey knew what they were telling us. We just didn't understand. And then they made us\nstanding in line of five. So we stood in line of five. We saw that the men were put\nseparately. We had no men in our group. None of us. It was my mothers two -- my\nfather's partners' wives. The two women and the young married daughter of one of the\npartners. The one who turned Christian earlier. We were the five in that row. This mother\nwho I mentioned to you that she was with them in that row she was a petite person, very\ntiny. Very elegant little lady. But she was so small that they looked upon her as a child so\nshe went with the grown ups right away to the left side. I was the only one who was\nthrown to the living side.",
        "A: And the body hair from everywhere. And they did not do too luxurious job on it and\nsometimes your body went with the skin and all. But they said --",
        "A: These were women. These were the Slovak girls who were still survived. See by then\nthere were very few of them who survived still. They were there for three years. And\nthese were practically all animals already because they were ready to kill each other, their\nown mother for surviving. And they were telling you why they were cutting your hair,\nwhere your mother went, what's happening just right now on the other side.",
        "A: Not only I believed her, I started to cry and I didn't stop crying for three days. I didn't\nhave anymore moist to it and I didn't have anymore tears running. It was a dry, hoarse cry\nwhich I could not stop for three days. It was at that point when we all realized how stupid\nwe were. Where we came. And they were telling us that we are the lucky ones which we\ncame so late that we will survive that. Not like their families. And how good that they\nhad taken our body hair off because now they are going to use a powder on it and so we\nwill not get lice. Which is very important. Let me assure you, yes it's very important notto get lice. Because the ones who got lice got___ and they were gone. They were the\ngoners first because there was no way there to keep clean.",
        "A: Not a thing. And this is what kills me to this day, back 50 years. Not that I didn't tell\nher anything, that I did not get in argument to Mengele. I spoke German. Why didn't I\nstart telling him that she's as young as I am and let her come with me. What would\nhappen to me? But I didn't give it a try. And I'm living with that for over 50 years and\ncannot forgive myself. I came home, my father's first word was what did you do to your\nmother. And I was telling him just like I told you now. And I was telling this a few times\nlater and everybody was telling me stop saying that because -- and no I can't stop this\nbecause nobody can feel what I feel and nobody knows how I can see the situation that\nyes I could have given it a try. I have to live with that. And it's not easy to live with that.\nAnd whatever life had for me what was bad I deserved because of that, I think. She was\nnot just a mother, she was somebody wonderful. And not even to try to save her. It's more\nthan one can survive. And so we came out from that area and they took us for a shower.\nAnd on the other end we were coming out and they were throwing toward us little\npackages. Instead of our clothing this was now become our clothing. So what I received\nwas probably for a ten-year-old girl. It was that long. My private body was showing and\nthere was no panties given. That was that. I was given a shirt and this dress and that was\nthat. Luckily for me I was carrying my shoe because I am very sensitive, I cannot step\ndown with -- so I was carrying my shoes.",
        "A: I didn't know he was the one. But there was that man in that uniform and he was\nshowing this way and that way. And the people were carrying the people out. Then later\nwhen he was coming to our camp then we knew names and --",
        "A: It became very elegant. Oh, we knew everything.",
        "A: That's when we went to our camp. It was B-3, barrack five. Which was the outer shell\nof a barrack really, nothing more. It had two big doors on the two ends and on the side it\nhad windows without glass. And there was nothing in it. We did not get the elegance like\nshifts on which you sleep five in an area and you are above _. No we didn't have\nanything. We just wrap them --",
        "A: On the ground. They took us in rows of five and they said these __ to the right these\n_____ to the left. So when you lay down you will be like forks. One body this way, one\nbody that way. So my legs went in between the legs of the other person and that kept me\nwarm. And my arm became my pillow together with my shoe and when you wanted to go\nout to the latrine then you try to go through these bodies who were completely next to\neach other. And in the dark when you wanted to make it to the window so you can gothrough it, step through it in the shortest way out then you stepped on somebody's face,\non somebody's arm, on somebody's legs. Somebody was screaming here and either you\nhad time to get out in time or you didn't. And you gave them all the beauties of what your\nbody was relieving. If there ever was something what take to cure humanity away from\nyou where you felt so bad that you thought any animal is living a much more -- I can't\neven think of -- but every life, every animal can have more decency and more respect,\nself-respect than you can. What are you? What kind of animal are you who you would do\nthat to your neighbor? These were the nights there. If 1t rained outside, it rained inside. It\nonly had not ceiling, nothing above us just it kept coming in. And for hours after it\nstopped raining outside it was still coming down and you were sitting in it laying in it in\nthat wetness. There was nothing. Nothing, no chance, no one to turn to. At the other hand,\nat the one end of the barrack there was a little room in which the blockalteste where the\ntwo stubendiest lived. And they had all the quilts there dry. I don't know how dry but\ndefinitely they always found something dry for themselves. We didn't have that kind of\nchances to own something what would keep us warm or dry or whatever. And that's\nwhere we lived for six weeks.",
        "A: Standing in Appell or laying on the floor, on the ground. A ground which was\ncompletely naked, not even a speck of grass or anything on that. And on one end there\nwas some water coming up standing there together. Ugly, dirty water. That's what you\ndrunk if you wanted to drink, no matter they told you not to drink it. That's what you\nwashed your clothing in or yourself in. And some people just refused to. So they becamesick fast. Not well fast. I tell you honestly I wouldn't have cared and did anything for\nmyself either. When we got to Auschwitz I met a girl who was working in my mother-in-\nlaw's house for the last year and a half. She was an escapee from that area from\nwhere I mentioned to you. Three daughters the parents threw into Hungary that they\nshould save themselves. And they worked as maids in Jewish houses where somebody\nwas ready and willing to give a Jewish girl the dirty work. My mother couldn't do it. She\nwould not. She would not have a Jewish woman working for her. No way. But my\nmother-in-law had such a girl and she I met there in this camp and she started to look\nafter me. She pushed me to go to wash. She took my clothes off to wash it because I was\njust sitting there completely letting go. And she didn't. And she was there for about four,\nfive weeks. And during this time --",
        "A: Monsi Margaret Jacobowich(ph). She offered, volunteered to go for the food. You had\nto go over to another camp for that. They were such wonderful chaps taking out the sick\npeople from the barracks, throw them on the carriage which was taking them tothe ___.\nSo she offered herself that she goes for food and carries the food cans back to ours. And\nduring this time she was looking around and yelling to people if they knew somebody\nfrom her family. She was looking for them. And sure enough in the C Camp she found\ntwo of her younger sisters. And then she told me that she wants to go over to them if I\ntake care of myself, and there was some woman who wanted to come over to this camp\nshe will be changing place with her and then the number will be all right and that willcome back. So until then I was with her and I think that saved my life because I would\nnot have done anything for myself during these weeks.",
        "A: Appells were -- it was dark when we went out and stood there for three, four, five\nhours until they counted and counted and recounted. And if they missed somebody at one\nblock then the whole 14 or 17 blocks would be held there in this camp and all standing\nthere. So three, four hours minimum after which they gave the breakfast. And then you\nwere told to go and either you were back to the barrack which usually they threw you out\nfrom and so you had to go some place around. And then they called you again to Appell\nto have the dinner -- the lunch and then the same time they were handing out bread which\nwas the dinner. So for that you were again for three or four hours and then they counted.\nThey counted.",
        "A: How many people were they counting where?",
        "A: All of them. All of them. See, in one barrack was about 500 people. If somebody was\nso sick they went over to the revere, which was the hospital, and they didn't find her or\nGod knows where they stood in line in the other part then you were standing until they\nfound her.",
        "A: No. There was no work --",
        "A: Yeah. You walked completely naked. You hold your clothing up there somewhere and\nyou walk with your arms up so they can take a good look at you breast and all.",
        "A: Like animals. Not humans. That's so dehumanizing. You know, by the time you got\nthere it doesn't even hurt anymore. But what hurts, the knowledge that you're left here\nbehind and you know what that means. So if you still have some energy to live that life\nthen you go on and try to get into the next barrack and stand in the line there with that\npeople. So while they were in the middle barrack I got to the next barrack and I got\nundressed with the rest of them and stood in the line and again they put me out. So it\nwasn't funny. No, I didn't bother even dressing too much. I ran over to the next barrack.\nAnd when they pick my arm that it's not enough and then I put my muscle that I have this\nside. By then my barrack was way outside, outside of the gates. How do I go to them? So\nthere was only one way. The big avenue of the camp which had the --",
        "A: No. The soldier with the --",
        "A: Yeah, but this guard had something with -- I'm looking this way but I cannot\nremember. Stop it please. So on the main avenue of the camp there was this soldier with\nthe machine gun and I figured there's only two ways. Either I stay here or he shoots me. I\nhaven't got many choices. If I manage to go and I'm fast enough by him then I probably\nget out there. And sure enough I was still very fast at running. And I got to the gate and\nthey were yelling and screaming to me to come from the other side they saw me coming.\nAnd the officer of the German women and the Slovak blockalteste were coming in and\none grabbed me and gave me flap in the face and said what barrack are you from. She\nwanted to know the numbers. She was only interested in the numbers. Where in which\none somebody went missing. How many to count. So I got out there and we went to the\nBirkenau and we got into place where we got to shower. And we were instead of 1,000,\nthat later turned out to be they wanted 1,000 workers. We were 1,070. Oh, so 70 had to\nstay there. So here was guard who was working for Mengele pulling out another 70 now.\nThere were now women there in this group who were pregnant who already could show\nthat they were pregnant. You see, some people came to Auschwitz without knowing that\nthey are pregnant and some who knew that they were having starting pregnancy but didn't\nshow so they got there. And now they were picked out who already showed and some\nwere. The woman who was sleeping across me during these weeks there she was\npregnant. And I had such a nice warm body to my feet to warm it while we were\nsleeping. But I lost her there.\n[Interview interrupted by turning over tape. |]",
        "A: You think it didn't work?",
        "A: Oh yes, by then we knew it. When they were cutting our hairs the Slovak girls were\ntelling us about the gassing. They were telling us what's happening to our mothers and to\nour sisters. They couldn't be happier to see us going ___ sick from what they were\ntelling us. As I told you these people were animals already. They were absolutely happy\nto see us suffer. And they many times pointed out that you are lucky because you came so\nlate that you will still survive the end. We came here four years ago when you went to\nballs and you had 5 o'clock tea said you just didn't know what to do in your very comfort\nand warm houses and you were looking for the luxuries of life. Yes, we were. True. That\nwas our fault we were because we had no idea what they are going through. But even if\nthey would we couldn't have believed it anyway. It was unbelievable for human beings\nthat this is happening to the other human being. Like when we went arriving at\nAuschwitz what we saw there on the other side, we thought that these people were crazy.\nThey are mentally sick and they were thrown into this camp because they had to be kept\naway from -- otherwise why would they be behind that -- behind what? Again I cannot\nthink of the word.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. Then we were taken into a train which was taking us across Germany to\n?Thuringen? and then from there this was Buchenwald's outer-commando where we went\nto work.",
        "A: Right. And there everything was just beautiful and luxurious compared to whatever\nwe had seen before. Here there was a barrack which had rooms. And in each room there\nwere eight times double beds. One about each other. There was nothing else there but\nthey gave blankets, one underneath and one above you like military. And there was a\nlong table in that room and two -- on two sides there were two -- what's what you sit on?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Benches. And that was that. And there was even a little stove in it. We didn't know\nwhat the stove will do for us, but in the winter it was really wonderful to have it. In the\nsummer also we were sometimes trying to steal some coal and make a little hot water to\nwash ourself. But they were giving half number of food compared to Auschwitz.\nProbably luxury food compared to Auschwitz. And there was a campsite and there were\nnot hours and hours standing outside in Appell. It was probably just an hour, hour and a\nhalf was in Appell. And then there was a factory about four miles away where we went to\nwork. That was ?IG Farbenindustrie?.",
        "A: Yeah. It was about an hour walk each way. I guess it may have been about four miles.\nAnd we had dogs to walk with the SS people with us and it was a decent big set up where\nthe prior people who were there working died out because the factory has been working\nwith saltpeter salt and that ruined the livers. So when this group died out they wanted\nanother 1,000 people and that's it. They had to have the workers.",
        "A:Itwasa__. We were filling the bomb bodies with that -- should I try to find\nEnglish?",
        "A: Well, it depends what you were doing. Most of the time I was working in the mill\nwhere this saltpeter came in as big bags and solid and it had to be worked up to powder it\nup. So you were to bake it up, somebody broke it, the other one was throwing it into the\nmill, and then others had to shovel the powder away into other bags in which they were\ntaking it to the part of the factory where they are mixing that with other things to make\nthat filling. And some people sometimes were working to put away the filled bombs. Or\nit was more of from this size on to big ones you were to carry from one place to the other\nwhere they would put the filling into it so what makes it --",
        "A: The other way around. To break up --",
        "A: To explode, okay. Explosive, it has to be put at the end. Then they were put into the\npackaging of it of which we were very diligently taking, stealing the two sides what was\nto hold it because we knitted that into stockings. And if not knitting then we were\ncrocheting something. You needed something, you were cold. It was fall coming and it\nwas _ and we were standing out there it was not funny. But we managed. We stole as\nmuch as we could and we were some of us was quite good at it. I was really good at\nstealing coal. My hand fit into between the wooden planks and some people were quite\ngood at stealing some potatoes. I was good at going for seconds in the way that I was\nready and willing to pack off extra trunks which came in and if you worked too fast to\nremove the merchandise from it they gave you another soup. Very important thing\nbecause out of the 14 there was somebody who wasn't able to go out, or 16 of us, who\nwasn't able to go out to get his meal. We're hungry, I mean we're always hungry.",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "A: Yeah, we were a good group together, the 16. But we were not all 16 but there were\nmother with two daughters there in our room. And the five of us, that's eight. There was\nanother mother with her daughter who she didn't know that she was pregnant and who\nwas taken out several months later from us. And her the mother's daughter younger sister\nwas there with her two younger sisters. So there were four of them. Okay. Four, and we\nwere five, and there were three. And there was a Rebbetzin from _. What's Slovakia's\ncapital now? Anyway, originally we went to work the same place in this mill. Then my\naunt complained that she cannot do it. Although I was working in a lot of her work and\nalso my cousin --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. We were together in -- these were the five in Auschwitz who out of that four\nstayed together and I was taken back. This is my father's youngest sister, another sister's\ndaughter, and that daughter's two sister-in-laws. Quite young one, the one was 12 years\nold the smaller one. And the other one was already at my age. So there we worked. And\nthen my cousin and my aunt both wanted to get out of that factory work. And they\nsomehow got into the sewing room. Which probably was better suited for somebody who\nis soft and they didn't have to march out and back. That happened right on campus. And\nslowly we managed to get through this time. Less and less food. More and more deep air\nraids. So there was no steam coming from Marburg then we couldn't work. We were just\nsitting out there and do nothing, but we had to be brought out and brought back. You\nhave to go, you know. And so slowly winter came and we were stealing left and right\npieces of material so we sewed together something what should be stocking to cover our\nbare legs. Then from this bags of which the saltpeter was thrown out we made raincoat\nthat was five times deep paper. So we cut out something where you put your head in and\ntwo arms room and you were covered with that at least on the way out and back. Not all\nthe water was in your coat only the half of it. Well, we were working this way through\nnext spring. But by next spring it was very little work. Very little material coming into\nthe factory.",
        "A: Well we started to become yellow, our skin and also our eyes from this material what\nwas catching us. Because that was coming out not only inside where you worked with it\nbut they were horse made -- well I should have started better. The factory was on the\nground. It was covered with roads and was covered with forests, and forest was made\nfrom that was all fake. Just --",
        "A: Yeah. Just so that from the airplane it should look like it's a --",
        "A: Sure. And so you walked through that and all over little horse brought up that bitter\nalmond kind of poisonous gases which you inhaled. You inhaled inside and you inhaled\noutside. This is the reason these factories were never bombed. We were praying that\nwhen the planes went by. We were praying, we didn't expect to get out alive from there.\nWhy shouldn't we then finish it now? No, we were never bombed. They didn't know we\nwere there. So in March by then we were cleaning all the places where used to be\nmerchandise. We had to saubermachen, to make it clean. To wipe it, swipe it, do\nsomething with it. It's a real German thing to make you do nothing with cleaning and\ncleaning and cleaning. They don't give you anything to clean with, but you're cleaning.",
        "A: From there there was no escape.",
        "A: It was all completely covered. Completely covered. We did see human beings outside\nwalking when we were standing on the Appell, on the Appellplatz on the other side there\nwas a road on which sometimes peasants with horse carriages went by. They knew we are\nthere. Don't tell me they didn't, we knew that they were there. But there was no way of\ngetting out. Then one day in March it was a nice morning like that very bright and we\nwere out there doing practically nothing. At around 11 o'clock-ish they came that we\nhave to go back fast into the camp. Fast we going, going, going because of leaving. And\nthat evening we left the camp. We started to walk. And it was a big long walk.",
        "A: The whole camp. And then they stopped us one place where we -- what I didn't tell\nyou that we had one lady with us in the kitchen who was a Rebbetzin who was counting\nthe Jewish calendar. And was telling us when it was Rosh Hashanah, when it was YomKippur. Nobody eat on Yom Kippur. It didn't matter. What we had was staying there,\nnobody will take it from us. And so the last day -- last night when we were in the camp\nshe said that it was first night of Pesach. And we went to her room and she made from\nsome flour what she stole in the kitchen some flat bread and she was giving us all a little\nbit of it. And we were reminding ourself that it is holiday. It turns out that she was only\nwrong with one day. The next night when we were out on the road that was really the\nfirst night of Pesach. That was very important.",
        "A: I don't know. We just thought that -- we thought back to that tradition how it looked at\nhome. It was something to help a little. Of course you realize that by then very few of us\nwas friendly enough with the One above us to believe that we are having this holiday\nbecause of Him. But there were two little girls also on the kitchen, the small kitchen\nwhich was peeling potatoes. They werea____ two beautiful little daughters. Some 12\nand 13-year-old redheads with lots of locks in their hair as their new hair grew out. And\nthese two girls have not eaten anything what look like meat piece or bone piece in that\nfood what they had all year long. They kept tried to be kosher. They were very kosher\nafter liberation I heard of them. They lived a very kosher life. But very few stayed with\nthat belief. I didn't. Anyway, as I said these holidays they were really something in that\nsurrounding. Anyway, we decided after that second night when we were again together\noutside there and we were holiday that next night we are going to try to get together. We\nwill try to find each other and we will get together. And that night when we started to\nwake we saw that a lot of the SS people were in civilian clothing. Or one was still withthe big _ cape but had been on a bicycle. So from their carriage all these things got\noff and they started to go in every direction. At that point I said to my cousin that I go\ntoo. If they go, I go.\n[Interview interrupted by phone ringing. |",
        "A: Sorry. So on that point my aunt and my cousin said that I'm crazy and they both left\nme. I said you cannot keep me. So I started out from that little road where we were from\nwhich there was a little forest on this side, quite a few trees, I shouldn't call it a forest.\nBut it was still very early spring you could see too that on the other side of that there's a\nroad on which I could see military going. So I said this is not the place I want to be at. I\nwant to go from here. And I, I just went.",
        "A: By myself. After which point they started to run after me. And by the time we first\nstopped we were nine of us. Of the nine of us only my cousin and I spoke German. And\nwe were walking across a field and we pulled out some sugar carrot kind of what still 1s\nthere. This is animal feed for the winter. So with that we put some and we ate some. By\nthen we didn't see bread the last ten days. So it was good to have something and we had a\nknife. I could slice it up and everybody got a slice of that. We weren't that hungry\nanymore. And we walked with it into the next village and on the edge of the village at the\nlast house we stopped and went into a peasant court.",
        "A: No. I certainly know it's Frielendorfand _. And we stopped there and the German\npeasant came out and they didn't know what to make of us. They knew what we are\nexcept they didn't know if they want to throw us out or not. And we said we will not\nbother you just let us have rest here where your animals are, and he did. And actually he\nmade us go up so we can be up where it's dry and warm and nice. And we laid down\nthere and we rested ourself and evening came. And all of a sudden we heard speaking.\nAnd the speaking went on and it was clear that the German guy who also escaped from\nthe military wants to hide there and wanted to come up. And the guy from there was just\ntelling him that this is not a good spot here, he takes him to another spot. And we were\nvery comforted. We were very ready to jump and go, but they ran away. And the next\nmorning the peasant's wife came out and said you will have to leave. We said oh we will\nwe just needed this rest and we are very thankful and we go. And then we brought back\nthe group backwards where we knew now where the fields were, made them sit there and\nwait. And my cousin and I started to go from house to house and tell them that we are\nhungry and we would ask for some bread if they can spare. And everybody was able to\nspare some. Some had some cold cut to add to it. Some didn't. But everywhere they were\ncooking. We had no idea, but it was Good Friday. And that afternoon, of course when we\ncame back we told them all that we cannot eat it all here because our sisters are waiting\noutside for us and we want to share it with them. And they accepted. Some gave us an\nextra piece of bread because of it. Some just let us go. So we went back and we again got\nsome of this carrot kind of things. And with that the bread was very good. And that\nafternoon we heard a lot of noises, motors and big machinery noises. And as we looked\ntoward the west they were stopping in front of this peasant's house. So we looked out,\nsaw the main street over the guy's house where we spent the night before. And we saw\nthat he has a white underpants on a --",
        "A: Stock outside hanging out on the street. And they are also hanging out there. And\nthere are a lot of other stores have something white hanging out there. And we looked\nback and we saw there's a kind of star on this machinery. Yes. They stopped there that the\nrest should come up to them. And we ran out to them. These were the first American\nG.I.'s who arrived there. And it was a magnificent, magnificent afternoon. When they\nheard who we are, they started to look for something to give us, food. And whatever they\nhad it was only from the breakfast ration what they had left over. So we asked for a\ncigarette. And eight of us smoked one Camel and all eight of us had seen stars at broad\ndaylight. Oh it was strong. It was very, very strong. But it was wonderful. And they kept\njumping to find some chocolate and there was some God knows what what was still left\nover from the breakfast. And then they got each other soap came our way. They saw that\nwe need some. And by the time we turned around the peasant's wife was coming that we\nshould come into her kitchen. She had a huge dish of hot potatoes, fresh potatoes in its\nskin. It was just I didn't understand how it went away so fast. You should have seen this\ngroup taking care of that potatoes. And then we went again out to the street and from\neverywhere around seeing how was in our little valley. And not big mountains but the\nmountains had all people come out from there. Russian girls who were in P.O. W. camp,\nblack African, French guys who were working as -- they were not P.O.W.'s and they were\nnot in concentration camp but they were something in between. They were able to getRed Cross packages once a month. They were handled quite different from us. They were\nhalf human. And they were not very nice. They were kissing our hands saying hello to us\nlike we are human being now again. And it was a gorgeous, gorgeous afternoon. I don't\nhave to tell you that Good Friday will always remind me of that. That was a beautiful\nGood Friday. Next day though we started to be very scared because the American troops\nstarted to go backward and we begged them take us along. We thought that --",
        "A: Well, it was not really English. I haven't used them for six, seven years. And now I\nwas full with my German so it was a mixture. But yes, I was the one who was telling\nthem who we are and what we are. For all of us I was the only one who spoke some\nEnglish. It wasn't English and many times I heard a G.I. say your English isn't.\nWell, I tell you why, what I didn't know how to say, but I knew how to say it a French\nway. I was using the French way. I mixed it with a lot of German. Luckily they were\ncoming from France so what was French was not so strange to them, but my English\naltogether was. But they had fun with it and they were so good to us. They were so\nwonderful. If you imagine what it is to feel human again. That people count you into the\nhuman race, not more, just that much. Then the mayor of the city was ordering a\nkindergarten to be emptied for us. It didn't matter that every furniture was this small and\nthe toilets were also half of a normal outhouse size and that low, but we had it. And the\nAmerican G.I.'s started to come to look us up. And we had one of the two people with us\nin this group was also a young mother with her daughter. The daughter was 12 and we\ngot into camp. Now she was big 13-year-old. A gorgeous girl, but of course you couldn'tsee that then, just something. And she was just laying there onthe _ and they were\nasking what she would like to have and she said chocolate and salami. So this young 18,\n19-year-old G.I. ran away to the PX and brought chocolate and salami and put it into her\nmouth and held her head to eat it though together that way. You can imagine how sick\nshe was, okay? It was close to putting us away with all the goodness, but they were\nwonderful. Then they heard who we are, what we were, it was stories to tell, right? And\nwhen they heard that we haven't seen meat.\nEnd of File Two\nBeginning File Three",
        "A: They went out to shoot deer. They found in the kitchen some of their comrades who\nwas able to skin it and clean it and prepare it. And they brought it like here is dinner. The\npeople of the city were ordered to everybody bring some cooked food to a certain place\nwhere we were fed. So everybody brought a huge ___ with that. They threw it together,\nmixed it together. It was wonderful. It was all the veggies in it and somewhere probably\nwere some, some meat or bone or whatever will give it some smells. And of course now\nthey came with the questions of what we now needs are. I know they cannot do more but\nwe had to get normal rooms and the post office was cleared away for us. And across the\npost office was a hotel and that was cleaned up for us. And the Germans made us clean.\nSo they were to clean for us and cook for us which they didn't like to do. And we didn't\nlike their food but now we started to be strong enough to have opinion about food. Andwe lived there until August. The American soldiers were not allowed to mix with\nGermans, with German girls. They couldn't see any. They were not allowed to meet the\nRussian P.O.W.\u2019s so only the Jewish Hungarian refugees were partners for them. So they\nwere allowed to make dances and invite us to go to dances. And of course that meant that\nwe made friends. And they brought the cigarette and brought some food. And they had\nresting groups close to the outskirt of Frielendorf where they could go to the beach too.\nAnd on the beach there was no one allowed to go with them but us. Not the Germans, not\nwho lived there, not nobody but we. So there I will have to tell you first a story because\nthis is a good one. There was a man on the pool side sitting all completely dressed up to\nhis everything on him and was sitting there alone and looking ahead of him and doing\nnothing. And all the rest was enjoying the rest and the sun. So it didn't take too long that\nmy friends were pushing me to go and talk to him. It turned out that he was Ralph Kutz\nfrom Cleveland. He had gas stations. When he had to leave his wife home they had their\nson the day before. He was allowed to go to the hospital to see them once and right after\nthat they got on the ship and went over, shipped out. So he didn't have another chance to\nsee his wife and child but that one, that little son of his. And he was crying on our\nshoulder and we were crying on his shoulder which he felt wonderful about. He never\nhad sisters. His mother always wanted to have daughters and never had. And as we\nbecame more and more friends during the summer he kept coming practically daily to us.\nHe came to ask first of all to try to make a Friday night for him. So he brought everything\nfrom the PX. He brought from the candles fromthe _ everything you name it,\neverything. The soup in the big can. And we had holiday and we were crying into hishandkerchief so he had to buy handkerchiefs and handkerchiefs and handkerchiefs\nbecause we needed lots of handkerchiefs. And we became so close friends that he was\nasking me and my camp sister who was in the same room with me that we should go to\nbe his sisters. Go to live with his mother and he will guarantee he will marry us off. It\nwas awful hard for him to understand that we still hope to see our husbands so we will go\nback to Hungary and not straight to America. And then from Hungary I wrote him and I\ngot married to Andy. Probably not even then but right after that when I was already\npregnant and yes and I asked him if they had any of the baby things left over after that\nfirst baby. I will very appreciate because there's practically nothing available here. Then I\ndidn't hear of them. I knew that in November he went back, he gave address and what not\nand that's where we wrote. And we also sent a picture my girlfriend and me two of us a\npicture. But that was later. Because that ended everything. The package what came in\nwas this large. I was seven months pregnant when that arrived one morning. It was some\n80 pounds, huge. There was one piece on the top of it what was a huge piece which was\nkind of christening outfit. All the rest was packed in a department store. And the\ndepartment store's paper was put on the top of it and they wished well. They sent me a\nrobe, they sent me slippers. And we sent this picture to him. And by then he wrote of\nanother baby. They have the second one. So Andy and I where we started to physically be\nin better shape we bought something but we thought it's a nice gift item and we had\nmailed two of it. One to his mother, and one to his wife. Not ever since then I got a word\nfrom them. Either they got hurt that I want to pay back what they did or God knows what\nnow I don\u2019t know. Or the wife became jealous because seeing our pictures. Now weturned around from what Ralph had seen and I can very well imagine that she did not like\nthat friendship. And since we are not going to become his sisters, I got married and my\ngirlfriend got married the same time, same day under the same __ and we did not go to\nthem. But the man there on that pool side fully dressed because he's an Orthodox Jew he\nwouldn't get undressed.",

        "A: But because Hungary didn\u2019t ask for us. Now some in our group were from\nYugoslavia. The Yugoslavs had asked for the Jews. And for them buses were given by\nthe army. And somebody, a young officer who wanted to find his relative in\nTheresienstadt, came down to be the head of the group and there was enough room for us\na few from Hungary that wanted to go with them and we could come with them. So we\ncame back home.",
        "A: First I went to Budapest. And we arrived to Budapest I looked up my cousins and my\naunt\u2019s and uncle\u2019s place. And I saw that my aunt's apartment had a hole on the edge on\nthe corner. But I went up anyway and I found my aunt there and she was screaming your\nfather's home. Now this I did not expect. I had mentioned to you my father was a sick\nman from World War I time. I certainly did not expect him be the survivor. But he was\nthe only survivor. And so next day I got on a train and made it down to my hometown.My father knew of me alive since the spring. They listened to the Red Cross radio and\nsomebody in the city picked up my name and came to tell him. But of course he didn't\nknow that I am coming now. And didn't know if I'm coming at all. He just knew that I'm\nalive. And he was mighty happy that his only daughter was alive.",
        "A: I went to the store. And the store was open. The three old men were there. I stepped\ninto the store and his first question was where did you leave your mother? And the\nsecond was that I'm ashamed to show them that I had arms like that. It was ___ but it\nlooked so good, so healthy like I was full with life. And he was ashamed to tell that I'm\npulled from concentration camp I look so good. He was very happy that I am looking so\ngood.",
        "A: Then we -- he had already by then invited a lot of people who didn't have home where\nto go home to. And here was his big house and there was nobody in there. Except he\nbrought my aunt down, my mother's sister, to cook for them and clean for them. Because\nin Budapest there was nothing to be eaten. They were hungry. And he thought that he\nalways will be able to make enough in the store that we should have food and all these\npeople put moneys together for my aunt to go to the market and whatever she can buy to\nbuy. And so they were living with her.",
        "A: There was not even a word then about him. Much later --",
        "A: Yes, with my father. And they wanted me to take over the house, which I couldn\u2019t do.\nI couldn\u2019t. I wouldn't move with him in my mother\u2019s house what was natural for her to\ndo. But then my aunt went home. And one morning when there was market day our old\nmaid came to visit the city to see if somebody is home and when she found me there she\nbegged herself that she doesn't want to get paid just food with us and live with us and she\nwants to come back. And she came back to work for me. We had plenty to work there.\nThe Germans were in that house. First Hungarian officers, then Germans. Then the _.\nThe __ were the underground Hungarian left. And after that the Russians. And the\nRussians were dancing on the top of the table. They pulled out the wood for cooking.\nYou name it, they did quite a job on it. So we had quite a time to clean the house.",
        "A: I stayed there until 1950 when all of us then my father's store was nationalized by the\ncommoners. My husband's business was in danger.",
        "A: Andy came home and out of Rosh Hashanah of 1945 the egg farm was about 20 miles\nout of my city. And his brother was already home much earlier. He came home from the\nRussian front with the army and he was it was still wintertime and he was already free\nman there. And then Andy came into the city and went into my father\u2019s store and was\ntelling that he doesn't want to spend the time out there. This is a little room and farming\nleft for them. That it's too little for him alone and not just speaking about his brother. The\nbrother was married by then. He was leave it for his brother out there. He doesn't want to\nstay there. He's looking for a place to stay at so my husband invited him to stay at our\nhouse --",
        "A: Has a room there --",
        "A: Yeah. And we have a room there and he brought him furniture and it got furnished.\nHis first thing was that he went out and exchanged farm products for glass and they put\nglass into our windows because it was kind of cold in wintertime without windows. And\nthe next thing was that he exchanged something else. It was all exchange there was\nnothing in that part of the world but exchange items. And then my father one nice day\nstood in front of me and said my daughter I want to tell you something. You were not\nsupposed to know about that because the two friends would have been forever enemies if\nthey knew but Andy loved you and he told so to your mother and your mother told himnot to ever mention a word to you because you don't see anybody but poor Andy. It\nwould be just hurting everybody. But I can see my father said to David he will stop and\ntalk to you about it. His wife didn't come home with his child. You're here alone I can see\nthat soon he will talk to you about it. And I tell you I would be very, very happy to know\nthat if I died I have a man like him with you. It didn't matter where I stand. There were\ntwo men who would be happy, my father and Andy, and I cannot be happy anymore in\nthis life. I lost my happiness. So why not? And when soon Andy talked to me I agreed.\nAnd so May of \u201846 we got married and he had only one request to have again a child as\nsoon as possible tells him that he'd like the one already had. That is what he missed. And\nyes quite soon I became pregnant. In April of \u201847 I had my son.",
        "A: Paul, after my first husband.",
        "A: Yes we stayed in Hungary. First we stayed in Hungary, Miskolc until 1950. Then as I\nmentioned to you, my father's business was nationalized. Half of our apartment was taken\naway. And Andy felt that this is the time we escape, we go. So he gave me money that I\nshall buy an apartment no matter what it costs and where it is in Budapest and it is away\nfrom here. That was enough for me. And then we went up to Budapest in October of\n1950 and that was the time when they were putting the people out of their apartments of\ntheir homes. All around us they were stopping during the night, a truck came and just\neverybody went. So we tried that too. We had to fight not only the Nazis, we had to fight\nthe commoners too. My father died in 1955. For our tenth wedding anniversary wedecided we give each other that we are making his stone having the names of everybody\nfrom the two families. And we did. And we had the stones.",
        "A: And six weeks later the revolution broke out. And we took advantage of it. We left\nHungary then, \u201856.",
        "A: Yes. We waited a long time in Austria before we could come because we didn't have\nclose relatives here. But then we came here.",
        "A: New York. We had a friend there. And because of that because they tried to make us\nas comfortable as possible and as Jewish ways as possible they didn't let us go out to\nArkansas where the ___ wanted us to go because my husband's diploma was to be\nuseable there much better. He was a Doctorate in Animal Husbandry. On Park Avenue,\non Fifth Avenue there's no animal husbandry, you know. But by the time we settled\nourselves my son became a little American boy and we stayed in New York. And then I\nretired and my husband retired and Paul was already down here since 1969.",
        "A: I did office work always because of that little English what I had it had me not to start\nas a physical worker. And then in \u201868 I got to the Ford Foundation and I was with them\nfor 16 and a half years before I retired.",
        "A: Well, let me put it this way. Not for me because I loved Americans. I mean I had\nmanic everything what was American was okay with me. My husband had a very, very\nhard time and never could go back to his profession, I think of a profession. But he who\nhad a doctorate who could not do anything. Friends here didn't know what to do with it\neither. Should he have known the Ford Foundation would have given him a nice job. And\nhe would have had a gorgeous future being in charge of third world countries\nagricultures. There was lots to do here in New York except nobody knew what to do with\nthis. Yes, we were refugees. We were very proud that nobody gave us anything. We were\na perfect welfare case but we didn't know about it and we didn't want to know about it.\nAnd what I have what you see we the two of us worked together and I don't owe\nanybody, okay? That was very good.",
        "A: I never would have changed out from Judaism. But I did not have anything to do with\nthe religion and a God which let that happen as it was. And I completely lost all interest\nin it. Until my baby first moved in me. That brought me back to it and accepting that\nthere's somebody above us who knows more than we do. No I never really became a\nreligious Jew in that sense. But I know a lot probably more than most of the girls hadknown of religion. My father was very proud of that. He always hoped for a boy and he\ndidn't have a son so he taught me. And he felt good about me knowing some. And I felt\ngood about myself that my grandparents were so happy with me.",
        "A: That experience stays with you forever. You try to forget it. You try to push it out of\nyour mind because you cannot live constantly with this. My husband whenever he had\nheard or seen something. He could not watch on a television a show which started with a\ntrain and that was that for three weeks he had the nightmares. He was yelling and\nscreaming each time he had a cold and he had a real temperature. He was fighting, he was\nseeing himself going through what he went through. He went from Auschwitz to Dachau\nandthe _ people had hurt his back. He went through his own hell. So we had tried to\nnot to talk about it. And definitely did not want to talk about it in front of our child. We\ndid not even know that our child knew where we were before. Until in 1969 the first time\nhe went back to Europe after he finished, graduated from engineering school \u2014",
        "A: The first place he went was Dachau. He stopped in ?Meiningen? and asked our friends\nwho lived there how to go out to Dachau and he went to Dachau next morning. I still to\nthis day I don't know how he knew, who mentioned that in front of him, or who else told\nhim because we certainly did not. I couldn't imagine that I can hurt my child with pain\nlike that I shall be telling all these what I was telling you or even more to him. I wanted\nto save him from that forever. I just couldn't bring myself to talk about that. The first timeI was talking about all that was in 1990 we were sitting in front of the operating room and\nhis father was operated on at Georgetown University Hospital where I first talked to him\nabout where I'd been. He came home once earlier and said I belong to the second\ngeneration and they are encouraging us to ask you to give us oral history. And I jumped\nup from the chair where I was sitting I run out to the kitchen and he knew that he cannot\nask me again about it. It's been much later in the \u201870s sometimes when I first was able to\ntalk to non-Jewish people mentioning where I was. I kind of it just came out of me. It was\nI don't know what I wanted to do with them if I wanted to scare them or what I wanted.\nBut I couldn't say that to anybody who was Jewish. I just didn't want to talk about it at all\nto Jewish people for years and years and years. And when they were talking about the\nHolocaust Museum my husband and I were both dead set against it. I couldn\u2019t see it. I\nstill cannot understand it. I still feel to a certain degree that this is guilt money from the\nAmerican government and from the American Jews. They all feel much easier to put the\nmoneys into something than their hearts. And we will be always different. We cannot be\nunderstood by the Americans, and the Americans cannot be understood by us totally. I\nstill have that bitterness. My -- I had a boss in the end of the \u201850s whose family also\nperished there. And says to me Suzanne you will have to tell me how my relatives\nperished. So at lunchtime when he was sitting on the switchboard and I was brown-\nbagging my lunch and was eating at the desk he said tell me. And so I started to tell him\nthat ?Mr. Rosengarden? I don't know I didn't know your relatives so I don't know how\nthey, I only can tell you what was the average. And I started to tell him and in three or\nfour minutes he stopped me he said Suzanne don't say that it hurts too much. And I thinkthis is what any American Jew feels. I spoke to quite a few just lately who said they don't\nwant to go down to the museum. They don't want to see it. And they don't know nothing\nabout it. There is a lady here who I appreciate very much as an intelligent, deep feeling,\ngood person. A few months ago in somehow it came to me that she was asking about how\nAndy lost his wife. And I said well how, she had ?Steve? on her arm. She looked at me\nand I said don't you know that everyone who went there with child perished? No, I didn't\nknow that. And I became so very, very angry on that that I wanted to organize a seminar\nhere that a few people who I know were survivors should talk to these people. I don't\nwant them to hear all the most awful things. I'm ready to tell them some story which\nprobably makes them even smile sometime. But they should know some of the feelings\nwe went through. They don't want to know it. So that's all I can tell you. Iam not a good\nperson. I am still angry.",
        "A: Yes. I think that's depression which won't leave me until I'm alive. I cannot find\nsolace. Nothing can give me solace. Not Yad Vashem, not this museum, not. __\u2014. None\nof them. None of them is enough. But the one in Yad Vashem would be just the right\nthing to be at. I don't think that these small little things are not breaking it up, making itless a whole tragedy. Make it small tragedy. Make it something what where justice\nappear.",
        "A: There's only one thing I can tell you, what I told the people around me. I was trying to\nkeep them alive. I kept telling them that think about it as a badly administered |\nexcursion. We were through with it, we will get through with it. It's just ugly and we have\nto be in it now. But we will get out of it. And I did believe that if you let yourself go, you\ncannot live. And the only way to do it is if you keep yourself clean and clean and clean.\nWash as much as you can. Clean as much as you can. That's the only thing. It's not\neating, it's cleanliness. Because once you get lice you go. In our room in the camp which\nwas the outskirts I mean the outer-lager of Buchenwald we had this little lady, the rabbi's\nwife, she kept on her head a turban constantly. Never removed it, never washed. It was\nfull with lice. And we just decided that we won\u2019t get in danger because of her. And we\ndecided she was never out working. She never came out. Somehow, I don't know how,\nshe managed that she never had to come out. And we decided in the factory that we are\ngoing to take home some what\u2019s the, it\u2019s a fluid what you clean with, petrol. Petrol from\nthe factory and we will wash her head with it. And we did. And we threw away her\nturban and she was screaming. And she thought about it and we got another turban for\nher and we washed her. Now that's the only, only, only way you could stay alive. And\nwhat kept you alive. And of course I had my aunt there. Not that I loved her so dearly,but she was still the sister of my father. So you wanted to take care of her. You wanted to\nbring her home. And I did.",
        "A: Oh yes. There were two ladies, who I became very close friend of. The one I mention\nto you as a lager-sister who got married the same day I did. And she lived in our house\nuntil she got married. And another one who was a her husband and family had a bakery in\nMiskolc and she was -- she was a strange lady. She was not well educated but she had\nsuch a smooth way of being friend. Probably she was too feminine to that I would today\nthink about her that I want her for friend, and I would have rather second thought that\nprobably she was lesbian. She was that kind of lady. But then she was very good to be a\nfriend there. We were carrying the bombs together and we were remembering old songs,\nold poems. We had to use our praise, you know. That was also very important. We were\ntrying the \u2014_s~ whatever we needed to remember things. And she was good for that.",
        "A: No. I got a very little in the late 50's or early 60's. A minimal amount was given and\nsince then whenever I asked I was negated fast. There was no words of something\nsomebody was telling us that there is something being now given. But I didn't even go to\nmake a telephone call to ask about it. I'm not interested anyway. It hurts too much when\nthey say oh you don't. Why? Because again still the Germans are deciding. And then\nthere's always a group of Jews who are serving them very well, you know. Just like they\nwere in Hungary when the Germans came in and the Jews were congregations giving out\nnames, giving out who is the rich out of them, you name it, everything. They gave the\nsynagogue buildings for them to horde all the goods, the silvers, and the golds. There\nalways will be Jews who are serving the Germans. They usually will be Germans Jews\nthough.",
        "A: My grandchild is a wonderful child. The child of a non-Jewish mother who two years\nago was his father and I were talking about something and his father was saying that only\nthe two of us will be there who were born Jewish. Well, he meant me. And my grandson\nchimed in and me. He feels Jewish when he's with us. He's always spending the holidays\nwith us. And then he spends the other holidays with his mother at her house and the\ngrandparent's house. He's a sweetheart, he loves us dearly. I never talked to him about all\nthis. I didn't dare and I was not encouraged later. However he was here a few months ago.\nAnd God knows how, he said something where I said did you go to see Schindler's List?And he said yes. And then he was completely wiped out by it. And I dared to ask which I\nhad asked his father sometimes ago and he does not have the nerve to face the holocaust\nmuseum either. And I asked Michael and he said no he would like to go and want to go\nwith his father. So I said if he wants to go would you tell me about it. And I asked if his\nschool shouldn't go and he said it's a good idea probably it should. But then since then I\nhaven't spoken to him about that. It felt good that now I know that he was. When his\nfriends were bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs and we kept going to them. His father was\nasking me if he doesn't want to become this, then his grandfather was still alive. And he\nsaid to his father that he would have nothing against it except going up there. I just have\nto accept it this way. It hurts. He got the bigger birthday present on his 13th. We had\ngiven to him with telling him that if he was now Jewish he would have a mark on his\nbirthday but without that a Jewish boy is bar mitzvah at 13 no matter what.",
        "A: No, I don't melt away. I don't want to melt away now. Thank you very much.\n"
