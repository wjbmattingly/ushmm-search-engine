        "Question: -- Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This is an\ninterview with Adam Starkopf, conducted by Gary Covino, on June 14\", 1999, in\nDeerfield, Illinois. This is a follow up interview to a United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum videotaped interview conducted with Adam Starkopf, on May 24\", 1990. The\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr\nfor making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Could you just start\nby saying your name and where we are today?",
        "Answer: Yeah, yes, okay. It\u2019s -- My name is Adam Starkopf. I was born, raised, and\neducated in Warsaw, Poland, also the capital of Poland. And my parents -- I had one\nbrother, four years older. I was born in 1914, he was born in 1910. My parent were -- not\nbecause I am their s -- their son, but th-the most wonderful people, but my mother was\nnot very well in the last years before the war, didn\u2019t feel good in general, had high blood\npressure, you know. We used to think that she\u2019s a very old women, in those days she was\nonly 54, or 53, you know, at the -- in the war. Anyway, I was married after graduating\nWarsaw University. I was 22 years old when I was married, in 1936. My wife was\n[indecipherable] Warsaw University [indecipherable] she wa -- she was my age. And so,\nyou can imagine we were married in 1936. Actually now, May 31\u2018 would be 63 years.\nMy wife died March eight. Now, when the war broke out, September first, 1939, and the\nGermans, you know, Nazi Germany attacked Poland, they were bombing Poland day and\nnight. I was that time 25 years old already, and my wife, because we were married three\nyears before the war, in 1936. And actually, it was such a sudden war, you know, they\ncalled it a blitzkrieg, you know, that\u2019s [indecipherable] nobody expected it. And there I\nwas expected, you know, I was expecting to be recruited into the army. Now,\nunfortunately, the Polish government, the army, they didn\u2019t have not only enough\nuniforms to -- for recruiting young people with military age, but they also didn\u2019t have\neven -- they didn\u2019t have any arms, and few days after the war started, in the beginning of\nSeptember, the Polish government, including the president, escaped to Romania, was\nneighboring -- neighboring with Polan-Poland. But, on September -- September the\nfourth, over the radios, there were announcements that all military age men should leave\nWarsaw, and recruit in a certain city near the Russian border, in the eastern par -- eastern\npart of Poland. And it was about 120 miles away from Warsaw, and we should walk, you\nknow, and report there [indecipherable]. Now, we were day and na -- na -- two nights\nwere discussing this with, you know, my -- my in-laws, and my parents, and my -- now\nwa -- a-and we decided, you know, with my nayb -- our neighbors Warsaw, and we\ndecided that I -- I said, \u201cI have to fight them. Wi -- I have to leave.\u201d And I -- September\nthe sixth, 1939, six day after the war started, I left at five o\u2019clock in the morning, my\nwife, my mother prepared me few things to take with me only, you know, to carry. And I\nleft ate -- they walk with me to the -- to the end of, you know, the near -- actually walk\nover with me, you know, all the way up to the -- we have a river [indecipherable] divided\nat -- suburb of Warsaw. So they walk with me up to that suburb, you see? And then --\nAnd then I just embraced them, and sa -- my wife was crying, my -- my wife was crying,\nmy mother tried to feel -- make her feel better, tried to smile, you know, he will be okay.\nAnd they walk away. And when I looked back after them, I saw how my wife, you know,\ngently taking [indecipherable] bracing my wife, and walking away. Now, what can I tell\nyou? The walking was undescribable, the marching to the highways. They were bombing\n-- the planes were over our heads, almost. And so far the not -- even from machine guns,\nthey were, you know, sh-shooting to the -- there was a lot of people, you know, thou --\nhundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people, and -- and some vans with ho-horses.\nAnyway, we were running away from the highways into the field houses, you know,\ntrying to escape from it. It took us over nine days to walk this 115 - 117 miles, can you\nimagine? Now I, not far already from theles city, I was wounded. A piece of shrapnel\nfrom one of the bombs hit my f -- right foot. And in the field, you know, there was some,\nyou know pe -- pe -- not ambulances, but there was some still f -- y-you know, army pl --\nda -- vents, and so on. Anyway, they cut off in the -- without anesthetic, my toe had to be\nchopped off in my right foot, and I had only four toes, and that hole, like, you know, in\nmy foot -- in the right foot.",
        "Q: Wh-Which toe did they cut off?",
        "A: The -- The se -- The second toe, like this. The second from the -- the right toe from the\n-- from the large toe, the second toe. But it didn\u2019t mean a thing to me, you know, and I\njust -- I was pretty strong to -- to take it, and we walked farther, and we came to a city of\nKleck, K-l-e-c-k-, and this city was very close to the Russian border. And the first night,\nwe were sleeping in a very clean barn. It was the -- really the first night that we\npeacefully could sleep, of course, in our clothes, you know, torn clothes, whatever it was.\nWell, you know they -- when they cut off my toe, you know, they took a piece of my\nshirt, you know, cut off for band -- to bandage it. And then we -- So -- But when we sleep\nin there, we woke up at five o\u2019clock in the morning. We heard some noises outside, you\nknow, tanks coming, trucks, and so on. We ran out, the Russian army was coming in.\nNow, I want you also to mention that some of the boys that left from our building, my\nage, Some were much younger even, together with me, some of them went back. They\ncouldn\u2019t -- you know, they just said -- decided no, we will not make it. And because a lot\nof the -- were killed people too, you know, on the highways. So they said we -- they --\nwe'll go back, and they left us. And the -- I went with just few that I knew. Anyway --\nAnd this was the Russian army. You -- You know about the problems that in -- in that\ntime actually. I thought it [indecipherable] when I saw the Russian, you know, th-the --\nthe Russian trucks and tanks, I was happy, first I thought they come as our allies. But\nthen I found out that they are allies of Germany, and they divided to this -- to this -- to --\nthey decided with -- you know Stalin and Hitler signed a non-aggression pact, you see.\nAnd what they did, they divided Poland into two zones. The western part of Poland\noccupied by Germany, and the eastern part of Poland was occupied by -- by Russia,\nSoviet Russia.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know about the pact between Hitler and Stalin before this, huh?",
        "A: Before I didn\u2019t know nothing, but I found out there. Yeah -- No, before I nothing --\nit\u2019s never [indecipherable] to the country, I thought that it will be now close to the\nRussian border, even if we\u2019ll not be recruited, at least we\u2019ll be safer there. Anyway, I, as\na young boy I remember it even that once you are under Russian occupation, or\nsomething, it\u2019s not easy to get away from this country. So, I was scared that I will not be\nable to see my family again, so I decided to escape from there. And I perf -- I met a\nPolish peasant, you know, who had the rowboat, because the divided -- now, the division\nbetween -- th-the border between the eastern and -- and the -- and the western part of\nPoland, was the river Bug, B-u-g. Bouk, we pronounce it in Polish, and -- you see. So\nanyway, I decided to escape, I -- I didn\u2019t have money enough, I gave him my watch -- to\nthe peasant, and for this he took me in a rowboat over the river, and we somehow were\nable to omit, you know, the border patrols, the Russian and German border patrol, and I\ntook a train back to Warsaw. And when I arrive in Warsaw, I can tell you one thing, I was\njust amazed, because I -- I hardly could -- could recognize it, you know, some building,\nthey\u2019re so completely you know already, you know [indecipherable] and in German, cars\nand trucks and Germans, all over, all over everywhere. I was running towards our\nbuilding and it -- it\u2019s a miracle how our building was not destroyed, in one piece, and I\nmet the janitor of our building. It was a four story building. In those days, you know, in\nPoland, not like here, you know sky -- you know sky rise buildings, this -- the -- the tall\nrise building was seven story building. And anyway, I met the janitor, ask him how -- in\nthe -- right at the gate, \u201cTell me, how -- how is my family, how\u201d-- \u201cOh, everybody ex-\nexcept your mother, your mother is dead.\u201d I was shocked, and I run upstairs, you know,\nwe had no elevator, you know run upstairs to the third floor, open the door, you could see\nmy wife, my parents, and my in-laws, were very happy to -- to see me, and crying, told\nme what happened. You see, during the bombing of Warsaw, everyone was instructed to\nrun into -- you know, the buildings had cellars, you see? So everybody was running down\ninto the cellars to avoid the bombs, you see?, and she was there, my mother, one night\nwhen they were bombing Warsaw. And some of the boys that left with us, and came\nback, they were say -- telling people that oh, we\u2019re so glad that we came back because\nnone of the others, probably, is alive. And my mother turned in to my wife, and my\nfather, and said, \u201cOh my God, if Adam is not alive, I will not live.\u201d And she got a stroke,\nright there. She got high -- very high blood pressure, you know, yungbe -- even before\nthe war. And she got right there, in the -- and that\u2019s how I found out that she died. Now, I\nalso didn\u2019t mention my -- to you -- my wife had parents, father and mother, and a brother.\nThe brother was only 19 years old, graduated Warsaw. He graduated Hebrew high\nschool, you know, and just was going the first year to the university. Very bright, very\nnice, handsome boy. Now, what my wife did, you see --",
        "Q: Let me just -- Let me just stop for a second, ask you a couple of questions, if that\u2019s\nokay.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah.",
        "Q: Because we\u2019re interested in getting a little more of your family backgrounds.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, we\u2019ll pick up the story, but let\u2019s go back to before the war.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah. Could you tell me -- you mentioned your brother?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Could you tell me his name? Was he --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: W -- Did you have any other brothers or sisters, or that was --",
        "A: Never, just one brother. Now, you see, my family was -- let me put it this way, my\nwife\u2019s family was very religious. Not Orthodox, but they were religious, observing, you\nknow, and so far that my mother-in-law wouldn\u2019t ride a streetcar on Saturdays even, you\nknow what I mean. They were religious. They were not fanatics, but you know, they were\nvery relig -- my family was on the Conservative side, but they were very Zionistic,\nalways thinking about Palestine, you know, and so on, and my brother, too. Now, my\nbrother wanted very badly to go to Palestine, and in 1933, the British -- you know, when\nthe British occupied Palestine, they wouldn\u2019t [indecipherable] and that was\n[indecipherable] to get the entry visa. He organized, in 1933, a -- in Warsaw was a Zion -\n- Jewish support organization, they call it Maccabi, M-a-c-c-a-b-1, Maccabi. And this\norganization -- you know, he organized a motorcycle trip in 1933, Warsaw, Tel-Aviv,\nWarsaw, that they will go there, you know, for sporting goods -- events, and they got\nvisas. There was 12 men on motorcycles, you see? Some of them in double, you know?\nAnd they left in 1933 from Warsaw, took them almost three months to travel, and they\nwere there -- arrived there -- I have pictures that I can later give you, and to show you,\nyou know, of th -- then -- [indecipherable] from a newspaper that I got, that I took it over.\nNow, anyway, he remained in -- of course he was in Palestine, he was -- all the time, and\nthen he joined the underground for -- you know, organization they call the Hagannah, and\nall -- was fighting there. And they why he -- until -- he was there all the time, and when\nIsrael was established in 1948, of course, he was there already, you know, and he got\nmarried there, he got children, and so on. He had two -- two daughters, and had\ngrandchildren, too.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: His name was Henry Starkopf.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The same name.",
        "Q: When he went on this trip -- on this motorcycle trip --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- did he know in advance that the whole point of this was for him not to come back?\nWas this his gimmick?",
        "A: Onl-Only for this reason, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s why he organized it.",
        "Q: Did all the other people on the trip stay?",
        "A: Yeah, everyone, yeah. This was a group of all the people, -- you know, all his friends\nthat were all Zionists, you see, and they -- they -- that\u2019s -- they decided this way they\nwould remain there. And of course, he was hoping that in the future, maybe there will be\nthe thing -- you know changing like [indecipherable] Zionist, and then maybe the family\nwill come there, and so on, you know? But he didn\u2019t na -- come over -- he didn\u2019t -- that\nwas only the purpose, to go -- but they -- be -- you know, for the British, you know,\nbecause of the visas to receive, they mark it down that this is only Warsaw, Tel-Aviv,\nWarsaw, go back. But none of -- they went underground. None of them -- all -- not\nofficially, you know, they couldn\u2019t remain there. They were underground, all of them.",
        "Q: What -- Before he went on the trip --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- so he has this planned, to do this?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Did he ask you parents permission? Did you talk about it in the family?",
        "A: N-No. We discuss it, of course, but you know, my parent didn\u2019t oppose it. You know,\nhe was that time, in 1933, he was -- he bor -- he was born in 1910, I in 1914. He was 23\nyears old, you know, and also very educated boy, and -- but that\u2019s was his dream, you\nknow, he was a very Zion -- you know, Zionistic, you know, and so on. So that\u2019s who I --\nhe decided, you know, to -- to do it. Now, my -- my wife\u2019s br-brother, who was 19 years\nold already, you know, was Zio-Zionist -- always was dreaming also about Palestine. So\nwhat my wife did, you see, when I left that -- that night, the sixth of September, she went\n-- next day she went to her parents, and she said, \u201cLook, A-Adam went in because he\nwant to be recruited and fight, you know, th-the Germans. I think you,\u201d -- his na -- my\nbro -- her ga -- her brother\u2019s name was Ben -- Benjamin, you -- Ben. She said, \u201cI think\nBen, maybe you should do the same thing. Go with Adam, maybe you'll be recruited.\u201d\nAnd he left with another man -- with another young friend, whose family was also living\nin our building, happened to be, and they relatives in that particular town, in eastern part\nof Poland, also. The town Rowne, R-o-w-n-e, but the o was the -- like a comma above it,\ntas -- in Polish, you know, they call it u, like u, Rowne. Now, anyway, now I will tell you\n, because it was [indecipherable] very unusual thing, you see. So anyway, we -- when I\ncame back, and her parent -- my -- I found out about my mother, and her parents were,\nyou know, sh-shocked, and what happened to Ben, you know, where is Ben? How --\nMaybe you can --. So I told them, \u201cLook, I know the people, the family of this boy that\nwent with them together. So don\u2019t worry. We will go there, we will tr -- go through the --\nyou know [indecipherable] and we\u2019|l see what we can -- you know, to -- to the border\nwe'd smuggle through, and see we can find him.\u201d And my wife with me together, we left\nWarsaw, and we found some peasants, you know, that also took us, you know, through\nthe -- all kinds of places where, you know, wasn\u2019t so easy to get through. It\u2019s a very long\nstory, you know, I -- I wrote about it in the book. Anyway, and -- but I -- yeah, I have to\nmention to you that together with us, also, my wife has a girlfriend that was in school\nwith her together, and she married a young man who was with us in school, too, but he\nstudied medicine, he was a young doctor. And we escaped together -- I mean, not escape,\nwent together, you know, and they decided to go all together, to -- not to be, you know,\nthey wanted to escape from Warsaw. So they joined us, and we left together, pola --\nWarsaw. And when we went -- were going to that particular city that I told you that the\nrelatives of this boyfriend that went together with my brother-in-law, I found out that --\nyou know, I had the address, and in order to go to Rowne, I had to go through certain\ntown, you know, where with -- it has there -- my friend said, \u201cI would like to s -- as long\nas we\u2019re passing by this town, I want to take,\u201d -- you know, it wasn\u2019t a taxi they took,\nyou know, how you call it, you know, with a horse, you know?",
        "Q: Like a carriage?",
        "A: A carriage. [indecipherable] A carriage with a -- you know? And we went to the\nhospital to find out how -- you know, how he can get a, let\u2019s say, position in the hospital.\nHe wanted to get some information. So after he got the information, I said, \u201cNow let\u2019s go\ntake the train, and we\u2019ll go to the -- to the boyfriend\u2019s family, find out where they are.\u201d\nAnd we took the train from there, and went to the city where they supposed to, you know,\nmeet the fa -- the family\u2019s supposed to be there, of this boyfriend. And over there, when\nhe saw the boyfriend was there, oh, he\u2019s -- good to see you, now what happened? I said,\n\u201cWhere is Ben?\u201d He said, \u201cI tell you where is Ben.\u201d Ben, on the way, he got -- he got\nsick, and he -- and he got sick and he develop typhus fever, and he\u2019s in the hospital in\nKoval, in -- in the town that we were in the hospital. We were there, can you imagine? I\nsaid, \u201cOh my God, what -- what a coincidence. And I was there with my friend, and he\nwas in that hospital.\u201d I said, \u201cWe going there -- back right now.\u201d So I left my wife, you\nknow, we were in the other town there, and I and he took a train and went back to the\nhospital. And we -- when we came to the hospital, went right away to the office, and I\nask, I am so and so -- you know, my name, \u201cI am looking for Ben Miller.\u201d The whole --\nmaiden name was Miller, Ben Miller. And said, \u201cOh, my God, how fortunate. He died\nhalf an hour ago.\u201d They told me. His heart failed, and he couldn\u2019t make it. You can\nimagine how I -- but, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s make it sure. I want to see the body.\u201d So they took me\nto the morgue downstairs. I look at him like a -- like a skeleton [indecipherable]\nrecognize him, and they brought me his little belongings, I mean nothing, what -- he had\nthere nothing [indecipherable], but they ha -- he had a ring that my mother-in-law gave\nhim, her wedding ring. She said, \u201cLook, this is a gold wedding ring, in case if you need to\nexchange it for bread, you know, give it.\u201d This of -- That\u2019s the reason she gave him the\nring, for -- you know, if you need it, it\u2019s to pay for bread or something, give it this.\nAnyway, and they gave me this thing, can you imagine? Now, what I did, because he was\na Zionist, I told his fr -- the friend that -- that was alive, I said, \u201cListen, you write a letter\nto us.\u201d I told him where it would be there, in that part of let -- another town with my\nwife. Write a letter and tell that all -- that he is so sorry that he -- we missed Ben, but Ben\nsmuggled himself through the border to Romania, from there he intends to go to\nPalestine. And he wrote the letter to us, you know? I set up the letter, you know, not to\ntell my wife about it.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Now, but, in Polish language, when you wrote the letter -- when you wrote about\nsomeone that he died, you write always capit -- let\u2019s say if you write he -- he died, you\nwrite capital he, you see?",
        "Q: Hm. Both letters --",
        "A: Just --",
        "Q: -- capital, or just the first letter?",
        "A: No, just the first letter, you know, just the first 1 --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So if someone is dead --",
        "A: -- yeah, | -- in other words, a -- it\u2019s a -- you have to wri -- you know, if a -- it\u2019s a --\nafter the whole -- the whole -- not the sentence, but the word d -- d -- in capitals, you\nknow. And he -- he did it, he didn\u2019t realize it, probably. And my wife --",
        "Q: He -- He did what, he --",
        "A: He write -- He wrote the letter --",
        "Q: And so he made it with the capital on it?",
        "A: -- and -- and -- and _ well something about he wa-was in -- in capital letters. And in the\nbeginning my wife didn\u2019t pay attention, but later on, she said, \u201cOh, you know what? Tell\nme the truth.\u201d And that\u2019s how I had to tell her. So we decided to bring back -- to come --\nto go back. We went back again to -- to -- again through the borders, you know? And I\nwas describing in my book how the weather was in January, 1940. It was -- I\u2019m sorry, it\nwas December, and you know -- 1939, and th-the snow was up to our knees. But anyway,\nwe walked all the time through, and we came back to Warsaw. And then, of course, we\ntold my in-laws and my father, that he is probably on the way to Palestine. And even --\nThey never, until the day that they went to the concentration camp, they never knew that\nhe is -- you know, that he is dead. Now -- And then, we\u2019re supposed to settle, you know,\nwhatever it was, you know, to settle down, you know, under the conditions there were in\nWarsaw. But, in 1940 -- this was -- I -- s -- I told you there was [indecipherable] 1939. In\n1940, Hitler decided in order to lift -- li -- see, they used to have the conferences in\nGermany, I understood -- I found out, and they decided to annihilate all the Jews from the\nwer -- western Europe. Now, you know that to have a very easy access to those people,\nhe had to concentrate it, you see, in certain spots. So, he established ghettos, and in s -- in\nWarsaw, which was the capital of Poland, was the largest ghetto. Now, what he did, you\nsee, he took wat section of Warsaw, and any person -- and ki -- family that was not\nJewish, they were forced to move out from there, but they were allowed to take all their\nbelongings, everything. Now, Jewish people that lived out of that section, were forced to\nget into that ghetto section, but they were not allowed to carry nothing with them, just the\nway they were standing. And we were forced, those people that happened to live in that\nar-area, like -- like we, and my in-laws, everyone was forced to take several people into\nthe apartments. Like, let\u2019s say 1 -- on the average apartment was two bedroom apartment,\none bedroom apartment, they had to have at least six more people, seven people, to take\neverybody. There were rations, one and a kilogra -- one and a half kilogram of bread\nevery [indecipherable] day, and so on, for a family, and it was terrible. Now, what\nhappened, they built a wall between 10 - 11 feet high w -- brick walls around the ghetto,\nand on top of the wall there were barb wires, you know, cemented into the top of the\nwall, of the brick wall, so people couldn\u2019t jump over it, you know. And there were\nghettos, there were several ghettos -- several gates in the ghetto, and they were guarded\nby the Gestapo, which is the -- the Nazi military police. Now, we -- what I was doing, try\njust to help my father, my in-laws, and my wife, I looked like a typical Polish guy when I\nwas young. I was blonde, you know, blue eye. I looked like a very good Polish boy.\nYeah, there was an ordinance that time, in -- in Warsaw, that every Jewish person has to\nwear a white arm band, on his right arm, with a Jewish star of David, from material, you\nknow, piece of material. Anyone that caught without it, would be shot right away, or\nimprisoned. Now, what I was doing, I had some connections with the 1 -- with some\nPolish friends on the other side of Warsaw ghetto, so I was -- I got a spot in one of the --\nspot far away from the -- from the gates. You see, I was pulling out -- I broke some few\nbricks, taking off my arm band, I smuggled out myself into the other side, where I could\nbring a little bit some better nourishment for my family. Then, in 1940, in May, my wife\nwalk over to me, crying. \u201cAdam, you will not believe me, I am pregnant.\u201d Now, I have to\nmention to you -- you -- you know -- you know, I\u2019m told you before, we\u2019re married three\nyears before the war, and like more parents, you know, her parents, my parents were\ndreaming about a grandchild, but we were told that my wife can never have children.\nSome -- You know, some woman that -- she can never have children. The doctors were --\nto-told us, many doctors. Because for three year -- three years before the war -- it was\nalready almost three and a half years, you know, and there I would never bring a child,\nwith my wife, into a world like this. But, knowing that she never can have children, you\nknow, that is different story. So, anyway, we decided we wanted to have abortion. We\nwant to do something not to bring the child, but in those days you listened to your\nparents, you know, even if you were married. And my in-laws, and my father said oh no,\nyou have to have a child, and you -- every child has -- anyway, in 1941 in January, my --\nthe child was born on a table like this table, a wooden table, you know? And without a\ndoctor\u2019s help, just a neighbor helped to deliver her. And my wife was very sick also that\ntime, had all kind of other sicknesses, you know. But anyway, she delivered a little baby\ngirl. And I somehow -- what I saw what they were doing to chil --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",

        "A: -- you listened to your parents, you know, even if you were married. And my in-laws,\nand my father said oh no, you have to have a child, and you -- every child has -- anyway,\nin 1941 in January, my -- the child was born on a table like this table, a wooden table,\nyou know? And without a doctor\u2019s help, just a neighbor helped to deliver her. And my\nwife was very sick also that time, had all kind of other sicknesses, you know. But\nanyway, she delivered a little baby girl. And I somehow -- what I saw what they were\ndoing to children in ghetto, I p-p-pledged that I would see to it that they wouldn\u2019t put a\nfinger on this child. You know, just I -- Pll do everything. And then, what started, you\nknow, I was going back and out, you know, for the child also bring a little milk, or\nsomething, to feed her, you know, and -- and in -- I was caught by [indecipherable] on the\nway back, I was caught by the Gestapo, and I was imprisoned, and you know, the\nconditions in those prisons that time were terrible, of course. You had to -- Now, not a\nsingle criminal in Warsaw ghetto was in prison. Doctors, lawyers, accountants, you\nknow, business people, but all Jewish people were in prison. Now, my father met a Polish\npoliceman, of German descent. You see, there were just like in United States, somebody\nmay be American citizen that has grandfather or great-grandfather was German. So, they\ncall it [indecipherable] of German descent. We had this man of German descent, and he\nfound out that he had some connection. He all -- called up to him, he said, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t\nhave any cash, but we have a beautiful bedroom set in hiding by Polish friends, that we\ngave the set to our children when they were married. We will give you the bedroom set if\nyou to -- see to it to release me from prison. And he did. But he work out, you know. It\nwas a deal that he -- he -- he -- he knew probably somebody there. Anyway, they release\nme from the prison, and we -- when I came back, of course how happy they were, but\nlater again, at night, they came and they took me back. Now, what he did, undoubted --\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s the way we -- we assumed they -- I\u2019m sure, he probably told them, \u201cLook,\nI can get my bedroom set if you let him out. Later, you ca -- any time you want to, you\ncan get him back.\u201d They came at night, at -- at -- at our apartment, knock at the door, and\ntook me back to prison. I was in prison that time, let me tell you this way, 26 men in one\ncell. You can\u2019t imagine the conditions. In the morning, at five o\u2019clock, the door would\nopen, the two German Gestapo men, with the German Shepherd. When they were\npointing a finger at one of the prisoners, s -- and say Juda, which means in German\nlanguage Jew, the German Shepherd was trained to jump at this Juda, you know, and to\ntear him apart. Every second cell they were like this, every second, they open, you know,\nand they were killing, like murdering three or four ki -- men, and then later replacing\nthem, so always 26. But then, this was already 1942, and I found a -- 1-1 -- 1n -- in -- in\nJune, I found out that they liquidate -- liquidating the Warsaw ghetto. Liquidating it\nmeans they are going to take the people into concentration camp. Now, in order to have\nagain access to all those people, they surrounded first old age homes, nursing homes,\nhospitals, some orphanages, or whatever, you know, they got children in, and also\nprisoners. Anyone in relatively good health was taken -- loaded into trucks, taken to the\ncattle cars, -- you know, trains, and taken to the concentration camp, Treblinka\nconcentration camp was -- I call the destruction camp, was about 80 or 90 miles away\nfrom Warsaw. 1,000,000 Jews were ki -- destroyed there. Now, anyone that was -- let\u2019s\nsay children, or teenagers, or people older that were not, you know, in -- in the best\nhealth, they were taking to Jewish cemetery, which was outside of the Warsaw ghetto,\nwas too big to be in ghetto, and they were executed there, and thrown into mass graves.\nThe mass graves that time, had approximately 300 - 350 bodies, each grave. And the --\nSome of the children were half -- not yet dead after they shoot, you know, or a little\nbreathing, or so, they still were thrown into the graves. Now, when they surrounded the\nprison, we\u2019re all -- open the doors, wi -- every one of us had to go down to the courtyard,\nyou know, out and loaded -- tol -- they would load us into the trucks. And there was\ntremendous chaos als-also that time, there was just hundreds and hundreds, you know, of\nthe -- anyway, I was able to escape from the prison, together with few other men. We had\nno prison uniforms, just to -- you know, just old clothes to -- I ran home, you can imagine\nhow my wife, and my parents, and in-laws, how they saw me. My father,\n[indecipherable] my in-laws, how they saw me, how happy they were. And I told them,\nlook, what they were doing to children, what I saw, and so on, I -- you are not go -- I -- I\nam going to do -- work out something. I had connections with some people from the\nPolish underground. I work out forged documents that were Polish people. My wife, the\nbaby and I are Roman Catholics. She also was blonde, looks like Polish. And the -- the --\nthe ka -- you know, the documents that we had, the forged documents, the stamp,\nswastika, I took a potato, a regular potato, cut out the potato, made a stamp out of it, you\nknow? To make the first -- the swastika pi -- stamp. And that\u2019s was our document. If they\nwould look closely, that -- at it, they probably would realize, but you know, ju-just to\nhave it. Anyway, and I arrange an escape, how I arrange the escape. Our child was that\ntime -- this was -- we planned everything, after everything was organized, I planned, you\nknow, the place, far -- to far -- about seven -- 80 miles away from Warsaws, everything.\nIt took us, you know, close, you know, all t-the June and July. And I plan, on July 31\u201c,\n1942, I plan the escape. Now, a friend of mine, a young doctor that was there also wun,\nhe injected her, put her to sleep, the baby. She was about one and a half years old at the\ntime.",
        "Q: Do you know what he gave her?",
        "A: Injection, to put to sleep.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t know what it was?",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t know, and I didn\u2019t care. He said, \u201cI will put her to sleep.\u201d So he\ninjected her, put her to sleep. We put her in a casket. My wife -- Men couldn\u2019t do it, men\ncouldn\u2019t be -- wouldn\u2019t be allowed to follow. My wife followed the funeral -- I mean,\nfuneral, it was just a van with the horse, you know, and the horseman, and the -- and --\nand the casket on top. She put on a piece of black material, she put on [indecipherable] on\nher head, and she walk aw -- and she went through. When she went -- came to the gate,\nthe Gestapo gate, they wanted she -- they sh -- that they -- the horseman should open the\nga -- the casket, to see, maybe some smuggling going on, or something. But my wife said\nto -- to the man, that she died from typhus fever. You see, in -- in ghetto, because of the\nconditions, very bad con -- the -- thousands and thousands of people died from typhus\nfever. So my wife said -- and so here -- wu -- th-those -- those be -- they were like, you\nknow, th-they were very brave with harmless people, with children, with it, but they were\nscared of -- to death of contagious diseases, so he moved away from it, from the casket,\nand she went through to the cemetery. The gravediggers wanted to pick up the baby,\nthrow in the mass grave. My wife screamed out, \u201cShe\u2019s alive, don\u2019t touch her.\u201d They\ncan\u2019t believe their eyes, they couldn\u2019t believe it. But you see, here again, I thought\neverything in advance. On Jewish cemeteries, in Poland, on Jewi -- only Jewish\ngravediggers were working. Not others, like here, let\u2019s say or so, you see? So, like here,\nwhen my wife was buried, in Shalom Memorial Park, here in Chicago, you know, in the\nsuburb of Chicago, three months ago, you know, there were not -- not Jewish\ngravediggers. Now, we got [indecipherable] they -- I wasn\u2019t afraid of any betrayal. So\nthey -- anyway, they took out the baby, with my wife, and they too -- put them in a room,\nwhere before the war they used to wash the bodies, prepare for regular, you know,\nburials, you know, normal funerals, and they were waiting for me over there. In the\nevening, I again, like always, slipped out to the other side, and I went to the cemetery,\nmet her at close to 10 o\u2019clock in the evening, with the baby. Now, with -- you see, the\nJewish cemetery had -- they were -- adjoining Polish cemetery, and Tartar cemetery,\nthere were brick walls in between. I made -- work out with the Tartar cemetery -- Tartar\ncemeter -- cemetery, the caretaker that I will knock at the wall with a stone, and he will\ndrop a stepladder, and we will go on the other side, and we gave him something for it,\nyou know. And would go out, and we\u2019ll be on the other -- and then we\u2019ll escape. And I\nknock at the wall with a stone, he let out the stepladder, went on the other side, and took a\nstreetcar to a place where we slept the first night -- nobody would suspect that we are\nsuch, you know, idiots. We slept in a building where -- si -- there was -- the building was,\nI think, six or seven story, I don\u2019t remember, but up to the third floor, there was Gestapo\npo -- railroad police, above the regular apartments. And we slept there one night. The\nman that wa -- he was a member of Polish underground, but he didn\u2019t know that we are\nJewish, and we slept the first night there. In the morning we took a train, at seven\no\u2019clock, six o\u2019clock in the morning, a train, and this was -- I prepared a place, about 75 -\n80 miles away from Warsaw, where I would -- there was a lumber yard. I would work in\nthe lumber yard as a laborer there, and then, my wife with the baby would be there, I\nwould took a room, and --from a peasant -- p -- the pe -- the Polish peasants, the tiny little\nroom, you know, with the w -- iron stove -- stove with the pipe, and it -- one bed. Three\nof us would sleep in the one bed. Now, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a -- a wooden -- you know, s-story --\nit\u2019s a one story house, small. Now, I prepared there a very ground -- very deep cellar for\nmy father and my in-laws, they could not be in the open, you know, as Gentile people. So\nI prepared a -- a spot, a very low do -- very deep cellar. They would be, during the day, in\nthe cellar there, in hiding. At night, we\u2019d take them out, feed them, and they would go\nback to the cellar. And after three days, I went to get my father and my in-laws. After\nthree days, when I came there, unfortunately, was fire, and most of the buildings were on\nthe fire, I couldn\u2019t get even to our building. And my father and my in-laws were taken\naway into a concentration camp. So actually, none from our families, both families,\nnobody alive.",
        "Q: Let me -- Let me just stop you here for a second --",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- to go back and, actually I want to check one thing. If I can ask, I just wanted to go\nback and make sure we got --",
        "A: Yes, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- on the record, the names of your parents, and what type of work did they do, and\ntheir background --",
        "A: Before? Before the war you mean?",
        "Q: -- that all be -- all before the war, yeah.",
        "A: My father was a businessman. My wife [indecipherable] in those days, wives didn\u2019t\nwork.",

        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Max Starkopf. And my wife -- my mother was Mary, but you know, in Polish Mary\nparts -- you know, that\u2019s -- in Jewish Miriam, but you know, it\u2019s still Mary Starkopf. And\nmy in-laws, mil -- their last name was Miller, and my father-in-law was Aaron, A-a-r-o-n.\nAnd my wi -- my -- his wife was the same as my wife -- as my mother, the same names,\nthe first name.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And what -- what kind of business did your father have?",
        "A: My father?",
        "Q: Yeah, what kind of business?",
        "A: He was in business, he was, you know, have leather -- leather goods place, and he was\nrepresenting some companies, also, you know. He was traveling a lot, this kind of\n[indecipherable]. We were not -- let\u2019s put it this way, we were not poor people, not very\nrich people, average families, but nice families, we got nice comfortable life and so on.",
        "Q: Did you have much when you were young?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You know, way before the war? Did you have much contact with Polish people who\nwere not Jews, or did the Jews pretty much stay with each other?",
        "A: I had contact, I had, because when I was s -- in high school, there were Polish boys\ntogether with me too, we got a lot of friends, and you know, so -- and we were, you\nknow, there was always a little anti-Semitism there too, you probably heard about it, but\nwe -- we were never, you know, affected by it, you know, in general. But I would -- if\nyou want to know, there were look tha -- like all over the world, there all kind of people,\nyou see of the same na -- the same nationality even, you know. And [indecipherable]\nreligion, [indecipherable] look, there were some Polish people, there\u2019s -- you see, there\nwas an ordinance, that anyone that is hiding a Jew, if the Ge-Germans will find it, they\nwould be executed together with the Jews, the whole family. There were some, they were\nrisking their lives. There was a pro -- a Dr. Chizevitch in Warsaw. He, in his apartment,\nbroke a wall to other room, and put an artificial wall, they build special artificial wall that\nwouldn\u2019t recognize it\u2019s another room, you know? And had a special way he made it. And\nhe was hiding the dean of the medical school, Jewish Dr. Beck, B-e-c-k, and his wife and\ntwo children. And he saved their lives. Now, you can imagine he was in that room in his\napartment. If they would -- he risking -- he was risking his life, and he was risking you\nknow, th-the -- the whole family\u2019s life. And yet, he did it. And there were many like this.\nThere was one Polish -- a younger man with a wife, they got no children, he was hiding,\nthere was a somew -- not far from Warsaw, in a little town, they was hiding 1n the attic\nsix people, family, grandmother and so on, six people. But there wa -- th-there was -- it\ncame to a point that already, you know, they run out of money, also, p-pay them to, the\nwife of this man said, \u201cLook, no use to risk any more our life, let\u2019s give them up.\u201d He\ntook out a gun, he said, \u201cIf you give them up, I kill you, then myself, but I will never give\nthem up.\u201d And he saved them. Later I -- after the war, I saw to it that he got a big job in\nthe government. But, you see, there was some like this, many, many like this. But yet,\nthere were -- yo -- I told you about this doctor, the Jewish doctor, my friend that we\nescaped together with th -- when -- that he went to the hospital to get the job? You\nremember I told you that he was in the -- what my brother-in-law died. Now they settled\nhere with his wife in a town in -- in eastern part of Poland, and there was a Polish boy, 17\nor 16 years old, the son of a Polish peasant, who was very sick and needed an operation.\nHe operated on, and he saved his life. And the father of this boy called the Gestapo, here\nis a Jewish doctor, pretends to be Polish. You -- You -- But this -- those are not human\nbeings, you can\u2019t b -- you can\u2019t blame all the Polish people for it, because there are all\nkind of people in this world, you see what I mean? But th -- so I am not this kind of a\nperson that I would sc -- you know, blame a fr -- it was just individua -- individual thing,\nthere were all kind. I would say the intelligent people, and not only I mean educated, but\nth -- illiterate intelligent people, Polish people, they couldn\u2019t help maybe, but they would\nnever do a thing like this. But those who were illiterate peasants, you know, illiterate\npeople, th-they were -- they were dangerous. But otherwise, not. But anyway, now you\nhad more question, or --",
        "Q: Well, yeah, I -- I\u2019m also wondering, you -- you talked earlier about -- also I should\njust say here in passing, that a lot of what we\u2019re talking about, and the stories, and you\nsaving your daughter, and all that --",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When the war started, and then when you made that walk, you were going to go enlist\nto fight.",
        "A: Yeah, y-yeah.",
        "Q: I'm wondering, did you think much, what were you fighting as? Were you -- Did you\ngo because you considered yourself a Pole, and you wanted to defend Poland? Or you\nwanted to fight the Germans beca -- did you know what the Germans were doing with\nthe Jews? How did you --",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. I heard about it, already, but I was -- no, I was going there -- there\nto -- to defend Poland, yeah. That was my normal idea, to defend Poland, of course. This\nwas the idea. But, you know -- any other question, and then III tell you -- shall I go on?",
        "Q: Well, so you con -- you considered yourself a Pole, then?",
        "A: Yeah, actually, I -- yeah, I was, but you know, even -- we -- as I told you, we were\nZionists, we were [indecipherable] but we\u2019re not fanatics, you know, and -- normal\npeople. And, later on, when we were on Polish papers, you see, and we live -- I work in a\nlumber yard. I work in a lumber yard -- you want me to go on?",
        "Q: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: So, you know, anyway, when I came t -- first of all, when I came back, I found out\nthat my in-laws, and my father, you know, were taken to concentration camp. I told you I\nwent there to get them, I came back, told my -- I had to tell my wife about it. You can fi -\n- riz -- realize how she felt about it, but we decided one thing, we\u2019re going to live for no\nother reason, to save the child. Do everything in our power to save the child, both of us.\nAnd we did it, we worked. My wife was going every week to church on Sundays. At\nnight, in the evening, before we\u2019re going to sleep you know, she used to, very loud at the\nwall, pray for the night, so the neighbor, you know, the one that we ri -- renting the room\nfrom, she would hear it, you see? And that\u2019s -- nobody would suspect us, you see, that we\nare Jewish. And, of course, we were raising the child, and we were very, very poor that --\nI mean, I was working, I was getting rations in the lumber yard, as a laborer, nothing. But\nthat was -- we were going through all kind of different times, and I also had to watch, you\nsee, very carefully, you know, that shouldn\u2019t sometime recognize, or something like this.\nThere was one -- one boy that was a clerk there, not a laborer like I, was v -- 18 years old.\nVery delicate, very gentle, good looking, and a blonde boy, and he always\n[indecipherable] he saw me to -- picking up a big piece of lumber, let\u2019s say, you know, to\nput away, he said, \u201cMr. Podalski,\u201d -- I was already in comparison old man, I was in my --\nyou know, 20\u2019s, he said, \u201cLet me help you.\u201d And I said to my wife many times when I\nwas coming to the -- where I -- walking distance from the lumber yard, I said, \u201cYou\nknow, there is working one boy, I am very suspicious about him, he is too delicate, he is\ntoo gentle. He\u2019s ats -- I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s not an average,\u201d you know. And I want -- I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to find out.\u201d And I walk over one day to him, I said, \u201cLook, Wally, how about\nto go with me Sunday to the church?\u201d I didn\u2019t go like my wife was going, I didn\u2019t, but\nyou know, I said Sunday to the church. He says, \u201cOkay, why not?\u201d And the church was\nabout three kilometers away from the lumberyard, you have to walk on the highways, and\non bo -- on the highway, on both sides of the highway were forests -- woods were. I\nwalked with him, I said to him, \u201cYou know, Wally,\u201d -- in Polish, of course, \u201cwhat would\n-- wis t -- what should we do if some Jewish people were hiding in the woods, would run\nout and attack us?\u201d He said, \u201cMr. Podalski, I don\u2019t think there are any, but if they are,\nthey are happy they will li -- that they are left alone. They\u2019re trying to be in hiding. They\nwouldn\u2019t torture, they wouldn\u2019t hurt us.\u201d I said, \u201cWally, I am Jewish, how about are\nyou?\u201d And he embraced me, he started to cry, the boy. He was Jewish, too. He was\n[indecipherable]. I wri -- I wrote about him, and that whole story, in my book, you know.\nSo, you know, he was Jewish, too, he was killed later. Anyway, we -- so we had all kind\nour tol -- our dow -- our daughter while we were there. One day, she devel -- she got sick,\nshe got very high fever, and my wife went with her by train to Warsaw, to the children\u2019s\nhospital, to check with the doctors. They check her, they said, \u201cOh my God, she has\ntuberculosis.\u201d And the only way we could save her would have -- she has a hole in her\nlung, the left lung. The only way we could help, if you could have gold injections, so we\ncould, you know, cover the -- with the gold injections, the -- the hole in the lung, and she\nwould be saved -- you know, got rid of the bi -- tuberculosis. We didn\u2019t -- We couldn\u2019t --\nWe wouldn\u2019t have a penny, we couldn\u2019t dream about gold injections. But then we had an\nidea. We had a very close friend, a Greek, Stamatos Kokinikis. He used to have in\nWarsaw, a factory of Halivah, you know, making. It was business, very good. And I used\nto -- I was an accountant. My wife graduated law school. I -- You know, and I, like a --\nyou know, like here, you know, accountant si -- let\u2019s say, you know, public, or a peer -- a\nregular accountant. Anyway, and I was taking care of his books, so my wife went to him.\nAnd I -- Later I found out that he was arrested few times even, because he was helping\nJewish people. But he had connections with the Italian embassy in Warsaw, because Italy\n-- Hitler and Mussolini were allies. So he said -- My wife told him about the gold\ninjections. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I get it for you.\u201d And he got it through the Italian\nconsulate. He got injections and he gave it, he save our child. And when she was in the\nhospital, his -- he had a maid, a Polish woman, who knew about it. She used to come to\nthe hospital to bring her goo -- you know, some good food and things, you know, to -- to\ngive the child, you know, the -- well, you know, she a Polish woman, you see, she was\ndoing it for her. So, anyway, and then sh -- when she was later okay, our daughter, and\nthere were times when we -- you know, were s -- were scared all the time, because we\nstill had to watch ourselves and so on, but somehow, you know, we\u2019re through -- the\nwhole t-time, or like this, and nobody could recognize us, you know. But one day, when\nthe -- the Jewish boy was killed, you see, 1 -- had -- I write a -- 1-1-1n the book about his\nfamily, and how they were -- why they were killed, and so on, but you know, we were\nscared that they may [indecipherable] because they knew that I was close already, you\nknow, always with the boy -- go nice with the boy, and that I was -- his parents were\nthere, living not far. So anyway, I put our daughter in a sanitortum, because you know, to\n-- altogether that she should be, you know, well taken care of, and so on. And we were\nwatching, and so on, and one day -- and I f -- the -- the Germans trucks surrounded the --\nthe lumber yard, looking -- I di -- that time I found out, looking for his fa -- the boy\u2019s\nparents. Now, what I found out -- not for his, but they looking for the more Jews there.\nWhat I found out anyway, that his father -- you see, they were from a different city, not\nfrom Warsaw, and he -- they were very well-to-do people, very well off, he had a big\nfactory, and so on. But his father in the -- they all pretend, three of them also, that they\nare, you know, Polish. But his father, in order to operate with the peasants, that they --\ntogether he was making -- they were making whiskey, you know, in many -- the some --\nin the villages some, you know, home made whiskey, and he was with them. And -- And\nI understood that -- that something came out that he probably was in there drunk, or\nsomething, that they suspe -- you know, that they called the Gestapo, that we think that\nthey are Jewish people. And they came one night there, and they killed him, and th -- th --\nthe -- the parents. But after this, you know, we were already shaken, we were very scared.\nSo one day, there was a man working in the -- a laborer, but he was working in the room\nwhere they had all kind of things there, you know, in the lumberyard, but anyway, a\nPolish man, and he came over there to our little room that we lived there, and he said,\n\u201cYou know, I had to get drunk to tell you, because I didn\u2019t have never spoke to you.\nSomebody here asked whether you are also Jewish. And I wouldn\u2019t like this should\nhappen to you, what happened to the [indecipherable] -- to the other one.\u201d Listen to this.\nAnd he said, \u201cBut my wife said to me, \u201cYou see, it\u2019s all your fault, especially that there\nwas that.\u2019\u201d\u2019 She says, \u201cY-You trying to, as a Polish officer, you\u2019re trying to do everything,\nyou know, for the [indecipherable] and th-th-then they call you here, they think that you\nare Jewish.\u201d You know what I mean? She just made it so that -- and he said, \u201cOh my\nGod, I am so -- I love you,\u201d he said, \u201cI,\u201d -- you know, changed completely. And\n[indecipherable] but we already scared. And then there was occasion I wrote about in\nthe book, I left the [indecipherable] and got the job in another place on the railroad, you\nknow, and somehow we survived like this, that in 1944, in August, were liberated by the\nRussian army. And you know that 1-1-1n \u201941, they started -- they became enemies, you\nknow, Russia and Germany, in 1941. So, for two years they were allies, and later they\nwere enemies. So that\u2019s what it was, and they were liberated that time. And so you go on\nfarther, what you want more?",

But one thing was\ncertain, that the child meant so much to us -- everything, not so much, that we decided,\nand you know, sometime -- was time we were hungry, but she was first. If we got a big\napple, I peeled the apple, I cut it up, I gave the pieces of apple to the baby, and my wife\nand I were just eating the -- the skin, or so, you know what I mean.

But, you know, it was impossible, so anyway, one day we decided to\nleave the -- Poland. You know, I didn\u2019t want to be the Communistic government. And I\ndecided with my wife and the baby that we escape. And we escape from Warsaw to\nanother city. You know, left Warsaw to ano -- not to escape to, you know, like -- like we\n-- before, but you know, we just decided to leave it. I didn\u2019t tell anybody wi -- the -- the\ngovernment about it, you know. We went to another city, where we had friends there, and\n-- that survived, and we stayed there for awhile, fi -- not too long, and from there, we\nwent to -- we escaped to Czechoslovakia, and to Germany, to the American zone. And\nthere we -- in those days they established DP camps, Displaced Person camps, for\nrefugees, you know, that -- [indecipherable] had any hopes any more. So we went to a DP\ncamp, not far from Munich in Germany. And in the DP camp we had a little -- little place\n-- room in the basement, up a -- like, you know?

I was, when I was in the government, I was smuggling out [indecipherable] you\nmentioned the one Bricha, so I say I can tell you. You see, I was smuggling out the most\nprominent Zionist in sucha -- in Warsaw. I was smuggling out -- they were in Russian\nambulances, they were -- tho -- they\u2019re going to Czechoslovakia. From there, the boys on\nBricha were picking them up. My superior officer was a Jewish man, Kratko his name\nwas. A za -- Communist.

        "A: Not only that I -- It was, I think once I heard the one town [indecipherable] was there,\nbut nothing, n-nothing pa -- Warsaw, no, absolutely not. I only escaped for this reason.\nAnd this Jewish man, Zigmund Kratko, you see, and he was the one. So I -- And we were\nin the DP camp, and they wanted to take my wife and the baby, but I saved them from the\nwar, I didn\u2019t want to let them go away from me, you know, because during the -- you\nknow, when we were -- you know, on the Polish paper it\u2019s on, I didn\u2019t -- once it -- it --\nthere was someth -- sometime in -- there were times when you [indecipherable] a little bit\nwere scared, you know?

It\u2019s a -- you know, in the DP camp,\nwe were with the -- we met a man, became very friendly with a man that lost his wife and\nthree children -- from a different city, not from Warsaw. He lost his wife, and he survived\nfrom Auschwitz concentration camp. He was alone. So we told him that when we come,\nyou know, later, when we were leaving, I said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch with you.\u201d When I\ncame here, we met there, through my -- through my uncle back here, because he had a\nlittle store -- this was a man who doesn\u2019t know -- Jewish man, who hardly knew how to\nsign his name, very plain guy. But he was pretty well off. He was in some kind of\nconstruction business, and so on. Very nice person. He was hel -- He was always gi-\ngiving to -- try to help us through a little bit. And I ask him, \u201cCould you make an\naffidavit for a man that I befriended?\u201d And told him about the man there, and he made an\naffidavit for him. He\u2019s the one, Martin Fox, F-o-x. He made it -- He arrived here, and he\nstayed with us, and my wife with me. And we got one r -- little room, you know, but\nanyway, we were together, manage with him. And then we had -- we\u2019re here, we met\nWarsaw friend who was at the university with us, very fine guy. He was here with his\nwife. Both were from ou -- survived Auschwitz concentration camp. And here, she\nbecame pregnant, his wife, when they were already here. And while she was delivering\nthe baby, she died. Can you imagine, going through an -- everything, then she died? So, I\nwas working that time, in the stockyard here, in the office. I couldn\u2019t go to the funeral,\nbut my wife, with this -- our friend, went to the chapel, to the funeral, of our friend\u2019s\nwife. And as they were sitting in the chapel, and then passing by and this Martin is our\nfriend, jumps out, \u201cRalph, I didn\u2019t know that you alive.\u201d They were both in -- in -- in\nAuschwitz. This one was alive, and this one was alive. And this one was single -- single -\n- one man.

And he came, and he said, \u201cListen, I work for the leather company, how about\nto start business, to make leather footballs, and basketballs?\u201d And that\u2019s how we started\nthe business. We didn\u2019t have a penny, we didn\u2019t have any money. I went to the American\nNational Bank with my friend, with this one that we met here, and ask for a loan for\n3,000 dollars. So he said, \u201cWhat do you have for a collateral?\u201d We didn\u2019t know what it\nmeans, collateral, even -- anyway, he said to -- \u201cPll let you know.\u201d And he let us know,\nand he ga -- they gave us, and we started a business.

Now, when the war broke out, September first, 1939, and the\nGermans, you know, Nazi Germany attacked Poland, they were bombing Poland day and\nnight. I was that time 25 years old already, and my wife, because we were married three\nyears before the war, in 1936. And actually, it was such a sudden war, you know, they\ncalled it a blitzkrieg, you know, that\u2019s [indecipherable] nobody expected it. And there I\nwas expected, you know, I was expecting to be recruited into the army. Now,\nunfortunately, the Polish government, the army, they didn\u2019t have not only enough\nuniforms to -- for recruiting young people with military age, but they also didn\u2019t have\neven -- they didn\u2019t have any arms, and few days after the war started, in the beginning of\nSeptember, the Polish government, including the president, escaped to Romania, was\nneighboring -- neighboring with Polan-Poland. But, on September -- September the\nfourth, over the radios, there were announcements that all military age men should leave\nWarsaw, and recruit in a certain city near the Russian border, in the eastern par -- eastern\npart of Poland. And it was about 120 miles away from Warsaw, and we should walk, you\nknow, and report there [indecipherable]. Now, we were day and na -- na -- two nights\nwere discussing this with, you know, my -- my in-laws, and my parents, and my -- now\nwa -- a-and we decided, you know, with my nayb -- our neighbors Warsaw, and we\ndecided that I -- I said, \u201cI have to fight them. Wi -- I have to leave.\u201d And I -- September\nthe sixth, 1939, six day after the war started, I left at five o\u2019clock in the morning, my\nwife, my mother prepared me few things to take with me only, you know, to carry. And I\nleft ate -- they walk with me to the -- to the end of, you know, the near -- actually walk\nover with me, you know, all the way up to the -- we have a river [indecipherable] divided\nat -- suburb of Warsaw. So they walk with me up to that suburb, you see? And then --\nAnd then I just embraced them, and sa -- my wife was crying, my -- my wife was crying,\nmy mother tried to feel -- make her feel better, tried to smile, you know, he will be okay.\nAnd they walk away. And when I looked back after them, I saw how my wife, you know,\ngently taking [indecipherable] bracing my wife, and walking away. Now, what can I tell\nyou? The walking was undescribable, the marching to the highways. They were bombing\n-- the planes were over our heads, almost. And so far the not -- even from machine guns,\nthey were, you know, sh-shooting to the -- there was a lot of people, you know, thou --\nhundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people, and -- and some vans with ho-horses.\nAnyway, we were running away from the highways into the field houses, you know,\ntrying to escape from it. It took us over nine days to walk this 115 - 117 miles, can you\nimagine? Now I, not far already from theles city, I was wounded. A piece of shrapnel\nfrom one of the bombs hit my f -- right foot. And in the field, you know, there was some,\nyou know pe -- pe -- not ambulances, but there was some still f -- y-you know, army pl --\nda -- vents, and so on. Anyway, they cut off in the -- without anesthetic, my toe had to be\nchopped off in my right foot, and I had only four toes, and that hole, like, you know, in\nmy foot -- in the right foot.",
        "A: The -- The se -- The second toe, like this. The second from the -- the right toe from the\n-- from the large toe, the second toe. But it didn\u2019t mean a thing to me, you know, and I\njust -- I was pretty strong to -- to take it, and we walked farther, and we came to a city of\nKleck, K-l-e-c-k-, and this city was very close to the Russian border. And the first night,\nwe were sleeping in a very clean barn. It was the -- really the first night that we\npeacefully could sleep, of course, in our clothes, you know, torn clothes, whatever it was.\nWell, you know they -- when they cut off my toe, you know, they took a piece of my\nshirt, you know, cut off for band -- to bandage it. And then we -- So -- But when we sleep\nin there, we woke up at five o\u2019clock in the morning. We heard some noises outside, you\nknow, tanks coming, trucks, and so on. We ran out, the Russian army was coming in.\nNow, I want you also to mention that some of the boys that left from our building, my\nage, Some were much younger even, together with me, some of them went back. They\ncouldn\u2019t -- you know, they just said -- decided no, we will not make it. And because a lot\nof the -- were killed people too, you know, on the highways. So they said we -- they --\nwe'll go back, and they left us. And the -- I went with just few that I knew. Anyway --\nAnd this was the Russian army. You -- You know about the problems that in -- in that\ntime actually. I thought it [indecipherable] when I saw the Russian, you know, th-the --\nthe Russian trucks and tanks, I was happy, first I thought they come as our allies. But\nthen I found out that they are allies of Germany, and they divided to this -- to this -- to --\nthey decided with -- you know Stalin and Hitler signed a non-aggression pact, you see.\nAnd what they did, they divided Poland into two zones. The western part of Poland\noccupied by Germany, and the eastern part of Poland was occupied by -- by Russia,\nSoviet Russia.",
        "A: Before I didn\u2019t know nothing, but I found out there. Yeah -- No, before I nothing --\nit\u2019s never [indecipherable] to the country, I thought that it will be now close to the\nRussian border, even if we\u2019ll not be recruited, at least we\u2019ll be safer there. Anyway, I, as\na young boy I remember it even that once you are under Russian occupation, or\nsomething, it\u2019s not easy to get away from this country. So, I was scared that I will not be\nable to see my family again, so I decided to escape from there. And I perf -- I met a\nPolish peasant, you know, who had the rowboat, because the divided -- now, the division\nbetween -- th-the border between the eastern and -- and the -- and the western part of\nPoland, was the river Bug, B-u-g. Bouk, we pronounce it in Polish, and -- you see. So\nanyway, I decided to escape, I -- I didn\u2019t have money enough, I gave him my watch -- to\nthe peasant, and for this he took me in a rowboat over the river, and we somehow were\nable to omit, you know, the border patrols, the Russian and German border patrol, and I\ntook a train back to Warsaw. And when I arrive in Warsaw, I can tell you one thing, I was\njust amazed, because I -- I hardly could -- could recognize it, you know, some building,\nthey\u2019re so completely you know already, you know [indecipherable] and in German, cars\nand trucks and Germans, all over, all over everywhere. I was running towards our\nbuilding and it -- it\u2019s a miracle how our building was not destroyed, in one piece, and I\nmet the janitor of our building. It was a four story building. In those days, you know, in\nPoland, not like here, you know sky -- you know sky rise buildings, this -- the -- the tall\nrise building was seven story building. And anyway, I met the janitor, ask him how -- in\nthe -- right at the gate, \u201cTell me, how -- how is my family, how\u201d-- \u201cOh, everybody ex-\nexcept your mother, your mother is dead.\u201d I was shocked, and I run upstairs, you know,\nwe had no elevator, you know run upstairs to the third floor, open the door, you could see\nmy wife, my parents, and my in-laws, were very happy to -- to see me, and crying, told\nme what happened. You see, during the bombing of Warsaw, everyone was instructed to\nrun into -- you know, the buildings had cellars, you see? So everybody was running down\ninto the cellars to avoid the bombs, you see?, and she was there, my mother, one night\nwhen they were bombing Warsaw. And some of the boys that left with us, and came\nback, they were say -- telling people that oh, we\u2019re so glad that we came back because\nnone of the others, probably, is alive. And my mother turned in to my wife, and my\nfather, and said, \u201cOh my God, if Adam is not alive, I will not live.\u201d And she got a stroke,\nright there. She got high -- very high blood pressure, you know, yungbe -- even before\nthe war. And she got right there, in the -- and that\u2019s how I found out that she died. Now, I\nalso didn\u2019t mention my -- to you -- my wife had parents, father and mother, and a brother.\nThe brother was only 19 years old, graduated Warsaw. He graduated Hebrew high\nschool, you know, and just was going the first year to the university. Very bright, very\nnice, handsome boy. Now, what my wife did, you see --",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Never, just one brother. Now, you see, my family was -- let me put it this way, my\nwife\u2019s family was very religious. Not Orthodox, but they were religious, observing, you\nknow, and so far that my mother-in-law wouldn\u2019t ride a streetcar on Saturdays even, you\nknow what I mean. They were religious. They were not fanatics, but you know, they were\nvery relig -- my family was on the Conservative side, but they were very Zionistic,\nalways thinking about Palestine, you know, and so on, and my brother, too. Now, my\nbrother wanted very badly to go to Palestine, and in 1933, the British -- you know, when\nthe British occupied Palestine, they wouldn\u2019t [indecipherable] and that was\n[indecipherable] to get the entry visa. He organized, in 1933, a -- in Warsaw was a Zion -\n- Jewish support organization, they call it Maccabi, M-a-c-c-a-b-1, Maccabi. And this\norganization -- you know, he organized a motorcycle trip in 1933, Warsaw, Tel-Aviv,\nWarsaw, that they will go there, you know, for sporting goods -- events, and they got\nvisas. There was 12 men on motorcycles, you see? Some of them in double, you know?\nAnd they left in 1933 from Warsaw, took them almost three months to travel, and they\nwere there -- arrived there -- I have pictures that I can later give you, and to show you,\nyou know, of th -- then -- [indecipherable] from a newspaper that I got, that I took it over.\nNow, anyway, he remained in -- of course he was in Palestine, he was -- all the time, and\nthen he joined the underground for -- you know, organization they call the Hagannah, and\nall -- was fighting there. And they why he -- until -- he was there all the time, and when\nIsrael was established in 1948, of course, he was there already, you know, and he got\nmarried there, he got children, and so on. He had two -- two daughters, and had\ngrandchildren, too.",
        "A: His name was Henry Starkopf.",
        "A: The same name.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Onl-Only for this reason, yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s why he organized it.",
        "A: Yeah, everyone, yeah. This was a group of all the people, -- you know, all his friends\nthat were all Zionists, you see, and they -- they -- that\u2019s -- they decided this way they\nwould remain there. And of course, he was hoping that in the future, maybe there will be\nthe thing -- you know changing like [indecipherable] Zionist, and then maybe the family\nwill come there, and so on, you know? But he didn\u2019t na -- come over -- he didn\u2019t -- that\nwas only the purpose, to go -- but they -- be -- you know, for the British, you know,\nbecause of the visas to receive, they mark it down that this is only Warsaw, Tel-Aviv,\nWarsaw, go back. But none of -- they went underground. None of them -- all -- not\nofficially, you know, they couldn\u2019t remain there. They were underground, all of them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: N-No. We discuss it, of course, but you know, my parent didn\u2019t oppose it. You know,\nhe was that time, in 1933, he was -- he bor -- he was born in 1910, I in 1914. He was 23\nyears old, you know, and also very educated boy, and -- but that\u2019s was his dream, you\nknow, he was a very Zion -- you know, Zionistic, you know, and so on. So that\u2019s who I --\nhe decided, you know, to -- to do it. Now, my -- my wife\u2019s br-brother, who was 19 years\nold already, you know, was Zio-Zionist -- always was dreaming also about Palestine. So\nwhat my wife did, you see, when I left that -- that night, the sixth of September, she went\n-- next day she went to her parents, and she said, \u201cLook, A-Adam went in because he\nwant to be recruited and fight, you know, th-the Germans. I think you,\u201d -- his na -- my\nbro -- her ga -- her brother\u2019s name was Ben -- Benjamin, you -- Ben. She said, \u201cI think\nBen, maybe you should do the same thing. Go with Adam, maybe you'll be recruited.\u201d\nAnd he left with another man -- with another young friend, whose family was also living\nin our building, happened to be, and they relatives in that particular town, in eastern part\nof Poland, also. The town Rowne, R-o-w-n-e, but the o was the -- like a comma above it,\ntas -- in Polish, you know, they call it u, like u, Rowne. Now, anyway, now I will tell you\n, because it was [indecipherable] very unusual thing, you see. So anyway, we -- when I\ncame back, and her parent -- my -- I found out about my mother, and her parents were,\nyou know, sh-shocked, and what happened to Ben, you know, where is Ben? How --\nMaybe you can --. So I told them, \u201cLook, I know the people, the family of this boy that\nwent with them together. So don\u2019t worry. We will go there, we will tr -- go through the --\nyou know [indecipherable] and we\u2019|l see what we can -- you know, to -- to the border\nwe'd smuggle through, and see we can find him.\u201d And my wife with me together, we left\nWarsaw, and we found some peasants, you know, that also took us, you know, through\nthe -- all kinds of places where, you know, wasn\u2019t so easy to get through. It\u2019s a very long\nstory, you know, I -- I wrote about it in the book. Anyway, and -- but I -- yeah, I have to\nmention to you that together with us, also, my wife has a girlfriend that was in school\nwith her together, and she married a young man who was with us in school, too, but he\nstudied medicine, he was a young doctor. And we escaped together -- I mean, not escape,\nwent together, you know, and they decided to go all together, to -- not to be, you know,\nthey wanted to escape from Warsaw. So they joined us, and we left together, pola --\nWarsaw. And when we went -- were going to that particular city that I told you that the\nrelatives of this boyfriend that went together with my brother-in-law, I found out that --\nyou know, I had the address, and in order to go to Rowne, I had to go through certain\ntown, you know, where with -- it has there -- my friend said, \u201cI would like to s -- as long\nas we\u2019re passing by this town, I want to take,\u201d -- you know, it wasn\u2019t a taxi they took,\nyou know, how you call it, you know, with a horse, you know?",
        "A: A carriage. [indecipherable] A carriage with a -- you know? And we went to the\nhospital to find out how -- you know, how he can get a, let\u2019s say, position in the hospital.\nHe wanted to get some information. So after he got the information, I said, \u201cNow let\u2019s go\ntake the train, and we\u2019ll go to the -- to the boyfriend\u2019s family, find out where they are.\u201d\nAnd we took the train from there, and went to the city where they supposed to, you know,\nmeet the fa -- the family\u2019s supposed to be there, of this boyfriend. And over there, when\nhe saw the boyfriend was there, oh, he\u2019s -- good to see you, now what happened? I said,\n\u201cWhere is Ben?\u201d He said, \u201cI tell you where is Ben.\u201d Ben, on the way, he got -- he got\nsick, and he -- and he got sick and he develop typhus fever, and he\u2019s in the hospital in\nKoval, in -- in the town that we were in the hospital. We were there, can you imagine? I\nsaid, \u201cOh my God, what -- what a coincidence. And I was there with my friend, and he\nwas in that hospital.\u201d I said, \u201cWe going there -- back right now.\u201d So I left my wife, you\nknow, we were in the other town there, and I and he took a train and went back to the\nhospital. And we -- when we came to the hospital, went right away to the office, and I\nask, I am so and so -- you know, my name, \u201cI am looking for Ben Miller.\u201d The whole --\nmaiden name was Miller, Ben Miller. And said, \u201cOh, my God, how fortunate. He died\nhalf an hour ago.\u201d They told me. His heart failed, and he couldn\u2019t make it. You can\nimagine how I -- but, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s make it sure. I want to see the body.\u201d So they took me\nto the morgue downstairs. I look at him like a -- like a skeleton [indecipherable]\nrecognize him, and they brought me his little belongings, I mean nothing, what -- he had\nthere nothing [indecipherable], but they ha -- he had a ring that my mother-in-law gave\nhim, her wedding ring. She said, \u201cLook, this is a gold wedding ring, in case if you need to\nexchange it for bread, you know, give it.\u201d This of -- That\u2019s the reason she gave him the\nring, for -- you know, if you need it, it\u2019s to pay for bread or something, give it this.\nAnyway, and they gave me this thing, can you imagine? Now, what I did, because he was\na Zionist, I told his fr -- the friend that -- that was alive, I said, \u201cListen, you write a letter\nto us.\u201d I told him where it would be there, in that part of let -- another town with my\nwife. Write a letter and tell that all -- that he is so sorry that he -- we missed Ben, but Ben\nsmuggled himself through the border to Romania, from there he intends to go to\nPalestine. And he wrote the letter to us, you know? I set up the letter, you know, not to\ntell my wife about it.",
        "A: Now, but, in Polish language, when you wrote the letter -- when you wrote about\nsomeone that he died, you write always capit -- let\u2019s say if you write he -- he died, you\nwrite capital he, you see?",
        "A: Just --",
        "A: No, just the first letter, you know, just the first 1 --",
        "A: -- yeah, | -- in other words, a -- it\u2019s a -- you have to wri -- you know, if a -- it\u2019s a --\nafter the whole -- the whole -- not the sentence, but the word d -- d -- in capitals, you\nknow. And he -- he did it, he didn\u2019t realize it, probably. And my wife --",
        "A: He write -- He wrote the letter --",
        "A: -- and -- and -- and _ well something about he wa-was in -- in capital letters. And in the\nbeginning my wife didn\u2019t pay attention, but later on, she said, \u201cOh, you know what? Tell\nme the truth.\u201d And that\u2019s how I had to tell her. So we decided to bring back -- to come --\nto go back. We went back again to -- to -- again through the borders, you know? And I\nwas describing in my book how the weather was in January, 1940. It was -- I\u2019m sorry, it\nwas December, and you know -- 1939, and th-the snow was up to our knees. But anyway,\nwe walked all the time through, and we came back to Warsaw. And then, of course, we\ntold my in-laws and my father, that he is probably on the way to Palestine. And even --\nThey never, until the day that they went to the concentration camp, they never knew that\nhe is -- you know, that he is dead. Now -- And then, we\u2019re supposed to settle, you know,\nwhatever it was, you know, to settle down, you know, under the conditions there were in\nWarsaw. But, in 1940 -- this was -- I -- s -- I told you there was [indecipherable] 1939. In\n1940, Hitler decided in order to lift -- li -- see, they used to have the conferences in\nGermany, I understood -- I found out, and they decided to annihilate all the Jews from the\nwer -- western Europe. Now, you know that to have a very easy access to those people,\nhe had to concentrate it, you see, in certain spots. So, he established ghettos, and in s -- in\nWarsaw, which was the capital of Poland, was the largest ghetto. Now, what he did, you\nsee, he took wat section of Warsaw, and any person -- and ki -- family that was not\nJewish, they were forced to move out from there, but they were allowed to take all their\nbelongings, everything. Now, Jewish people that lived out of that section, were forced to\nget into that ghetto section, but they were not allowed to carry nothing with them, just the\nway they were standing. And we were forced, those people that happened to live in that\nar-area, like -- like we, and my in-laws, everyone was forced to take several people into\nthe apartments. Like, let\u2019s say 1 -- on the average apartment was two bedroom apartment,\none bedroom apartment, they had to have at least six more people, seven people, to take\neverybody. There were rations, one and a kilogra -- one and a half kilogram of bread\nevery [indecipherable] day, and so on, for a family, and it was terrible. Now, what\nhappened, they built a wall between 10 - 11 feet high w -- brick walls around the ghetto,\nand on top of the wall there were barb wires, you know, cemented into the top of the\nwall, of the brick wall, so people couldn\u2019t jump over it, you know. And there were\nghettos, there were several ghettos -- several gates in the ghetto, and they were guarded\nby the Gestapo, which is the -- the Nazi military police. Now, we -- what I was doing, try\njust to help my father, my in-laws, and my wife, I looked like a typical Polish guy when I\nwas young. I was blonde, you know, blue eye. I looked like a very good Polish boy.\nYeah, there was an ordinance that time, in -- in Warsaw, that every Jewish person has to\nwear a white arm band, on his right arm, with a Jewish star of David, from material, you\nknow, piece of material. Anyone that caught without it, would be shot right away, or\nimprisoned. Now, what I was doing, I had some connections with the 1 -- with some\nPolish friends on the other side of Warsaw ghetto, so I was -- I got a spot in one of the --\nspot far away from the -- from the gates. You see, I was pulling out -- I broke some few\nbricks, taking off my arm band, I smuggled out myself into the other side, where I could\nbring a little bit some better nourishment for my family. Then, in 1940, in May, my wife\nwalk over to me, crying. \u201cAdam, you will not believe me, I am pregnant.\u201d Now, I have to\nmention to you -- you -- you know -- you know, I\u2019m told you before, we\u2019re married three\nyears before the war, and like more parents, you know, her parents, my parents were\ndreaming about a grandchild, but we were told that my wife can never have children.\nSome -- You know, some woman that -- she can never have children. The doctors were --\nto-told us, many doctors. Because for three year -- three years before the war -- it was\nalready almost three and a half years, you know, and there I would never bring a child,\nwith my wife, into a world like this. But, knowing that she never can have children, you\nknow, that is different story. So, anyway, we decided we wanted to have abortion. We\nwant to do something not to bring the child, but in those days you listened to your\nparents, you know, even if you were married. And my in-laws, and my father said oh no,\nyou have to have a child, and you -- every child has -- anyway, in 1941 in January, my --\nthe child was born on a table like this table, a wooden table, you know? And without a\ndoctor\u2019s help, just a neighbor helped to deliver her. And my wife was very sick also that\ntime, had all kind of other sicknesses, you know. But anyway, she delivered a little baby\ngirl. And I somehow -- what I saw what they were doing to chil --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: -- you listened to your parents, you know, even if you were married. And my in-laws,\nand my father said oh no, you have to have a child, and you -- every child has -- anyway,\nin 1941 in January, my -- the child was born on a table like this table, a wooden table,\nyou know? And without a doctor\u2019s help, just a neighbor helped to deliver her. And my\nwife was very sick also that time, had all kind of other sicknesses, you know. But\nanyway, she delivered a little baby girl. And I somehow -- what I saw what they were\ndoing to children in ghetto, I p-p-pledged that I would see to it that they wouldn\u2019t put a\nfinger on this child. You know, just I -- Pll do everything. And then, what started, you\nknow, I was going back and out, you know, for the child also bring a little milk, or\nsomething, to feed her, you know, and -- and in -- I was caught by [indecipherable] on the\nway back, I was caught by the Gestapo, and I was imprisoned, and you know, the\nconditions in those prisons that time were terrible, of course. You had to -- Now, not a\nsingle criminal in Warsaw ghetto was in prison. Doctors, lawyers, accountants, you\nknow, business people, but all Jewish people were in prison. Now, my father met a Polish\npoliceman, of German descent. You see, there were just like in United States, somebody\nmay be American citizen that has grandfather or great-grandfather was German. So, they\ncall it [indecipherable] of German descent. We had this man of German descent, and he\nfound out that he had some connection. He all -- called up to him, he said, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t\nhave any cash, but we have a beautiful bedroom set in hiding by Polish friends, that we\ngave the set to our children when they were married. We will give you the bedroom set if\nyou to -- see to it to release me from prison. And he did. But he work out, you know. It\nwas a deal that he -- he -- he -- he knew probably somebody there. Anyway, they release\nme from the prison, and we -- when I came back, of course how happy they were, but\nlater again, at night, they came and they took me back. Now, what he did, undoubted --\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s the way we -- we assumed they -- I\u2019m sure, he probably told them, \u201cLook,\nI can get my bedroom set if you let him out. Later, you ca -- any time you want to, you\ncan get him back.\u201d They came at night, at -- at -- at our apartment, knock at the door, and\ntook me back to prison. I was in prison that time, let me tell you this way, 26 men in one\ncell. You can\u2019t imagine the conditions. In the morning, at five o\u2019clock, the door would\nopen, the two German Gestapo men, with the German Shepherd. When they were\npointing a finger at one of the prisoners, s -- and say Juda, which means in German\nlanguage Jew, the German Shepherd was trained to jump at this Juda, you know, and to\ntear him apart. Every second cell they were like this, every second, they open, you know,\nand they were killing, like murdering three or four ki -- men, and then later replacing\nthem, so always 26. But then, this was already 1942, and I found a -- 1-1 -- 1n -- in -- in\nJune, I found out that they liquidate -- liquidating the Warsaw ghetto. Liquidating it\nmeans they are going to take the people into concentration camp. Now, in order to have\nagain access to all those people, they surrounded first old age homes, nursing homes,\nhospitals, some orphanages, or whatever, you know, they got children in, and also\nprisoners. Anyone in relatively good health was taken -- loaded into trucks, taken to the\ncattle cars, -- you know, trains, and taken to the concentration camp, Treblinka\nconcentration camp was -- I call the destruction camp, was about 80 or 90 miles away\nfrom Warsaw. 1,000,000 Jews were ki -- destroyed there. Now, anyone that was -- let\u2019s\nsay children, or teenagers, or people older that were not, you know, in -- in the best\nhealth, they were taking to Jewish cemetery, which was outside of the Warsaw ghetto,\nwas too big to be in ghetto, and they were executed there, and thrown into mass graves.\nThe mass graves that time, had approximately 300 - 350 bodies, each grave. And the --\nSome of the children were half -- not yet dead after they shoot, you know, or a little\nbreathing, or so, they still were thrown into the graves. Now, when they surrounded the\nprison, we\u2019re all -- open the doors, wi -- every one of us had to go down to the courtyard,\nyou know, out and loaded -- tol -- they would load us into the trucks. And there was\ntremendous chaos als-also that time, there was just hundreds and hundreds, you know, of\nthe -- anyway, I was able to escape from the prison, together with few other men. We had\nno prison uniforms, just to -- you know, just old clothes to -- I ran home, you can imagine\nhow my wife, and my parents, and in-laws, how they saw me. My father,\n[indecipherable] my in-laws, how they saw me, how happy they were. And I told them,\nlook, what they were doing to children, what I saw, and so on, I -- you are not go -- I -- I\nam going to do -- work out something. I had connections with some people from the\nPolish underground. I work out forged documents that were Polish people. My wife, the\nbaby and I are Roman Catholics. She also was blonde, looks like Polish. And the -- the --\nthe ka -- you know, the documents that we had, the forged documents, the stamp,\nswastika, I took a potato, a regular potato, cut out the potato, made a stamp out of it, you\nknow? To make the first -- the swastika pi -- stamp. And that\u2019s was our document. If they\nwould look closely, that -- at it, they probably would realize, but you know, ju-just to\nhave it. Anyway, and I arrange an escape, how I arrange the escape. Our child was that\ntime -- this was -- we planned everything, after everything was organized, I planned, you\nknow, the place, far -- to far -- about seven -- 80 miles away from Warsaws, everything.\nIt took us, you know, close, you know, all t-the June and July. And I plan, on July 31\u201c,\n1942, I plan the escape. Now, a friend of mine, a young doctor that was there also wun,\nhe injected her, put her to sleep, the baby. She was about one and a half years old at the\ntime.",
        "A: Injection, to put to sleep.",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t know, and I didn\u2019t care. He said, \u201cI will put her to sleep.\u201d So he\ninjected her, put her to sleep. We put her in a casket. My wife -- Men couldn\u2019t do it, men\ncouldn\u2019t be -- wouldn\u2019t be allowed to follow. My wife followed the funeral -- I mean,\nfuneral, it was just a van with the horse, you know, and the horseman, and the -- and --\nand the casket on top. She put on a piece of black material, she put on [indecipherable] on\nher head, and she walk aw -- and she went through. When she went -- came to the gate,\nthe Gestapo gate, they wanted she -- they sh -- that they -- the horseman should open the\nga -- the casket, to see, maybe some smuggling going on, or something. But my wife said\nto -- to the man, that she died from typhus fever. You see, in -- in ghetto, because of the\nconditions, very bad con -- the -- thousands and thousands of people died from typhus\nfever. So my wife said -- and so here -- wu -- th-those -- those be -- they were like, you\nknow, th-they were very brave with harmless people, with children, with it, but they were\nscared of -- to death of contagious diseases, so he moved away from it, from the casket,\nand she went through to the cemetery. The gravediggers wanted to pick up the baby,\nthrow in the mass grave. My wife screamed out, \u201cShe\u2019s alive, don\u2019t touch her.\u201d They\ncan\u2019t believe their eyes, they couldn\u2019t believe it. But you see, here again, I thought\neverything in advance. On Jewish cemeteries, in Poland, on Jewi -- only Jewish\ngravediggers were working. Not others, like here, let\u2019s say or so, you see? So, like here,\nwhen my wife was buried, in Shalom Memorial Park, here in Chicago, you know, in the\nsuburb of Chicago, three months ago, you know, there were not -- not Jewish\ngravediggers. Now, we got [indecipherable] they -- I wasn\u2019t afraid of any betrayal. So\nthey -- anyway, they took out the baby, with my wife, and they too -- put them in a room,\nwhere before the war they used to wash the bodies, prepare for regular, you know,\nburials, you know, normal funerals, and they were waiting for me over there. In the\nevening, I again, like always, slipped out to the other side, and I went to the cemetery,\nmet her at close to 10 o\u2019clock in the evening, with the baby. Now, with -- you see, the\nJewish cemetery had -- they were -- adjoining Polish cemetery, and Tartar cemetery,\nthere were brick walls in between. I made -- work out with the Tartar cemetery -- Tartar\ncemeter -- cemetery, the caretaker that I will knock at the wall with a stone, and he will\ndrop a stepladder, and we will go on the other side, and we gave him something for it,\nyou know. And would go out, and we\u2019ll be on the other -- and then we\u2019ll escape. And I\nknock at the wall with a stone, he let out the stepladder, went on the other side, and took a\nstreetcar to a place where we slept the first night -- nobody would suspect that we are\nsuch, you know, idiots. We slept in a building where -- si -- there was -- the building was,\nI think, six or seven story, I don\u2019t remember, but up to the third floor, there was Gestapo\npo -- railroad police, above the regular apartments. And we slept there one night. The\nman that wa -- he was a member of Polish underground, but he didn\u2019t know that we are\nJewish, and we slept the first night there. In the morning we took a train, at seven\no\u2019clock, six o\u2019clock in the morning, a train, and this was -- I prepared a place, about 75 -\n80 miles away from Warsaw, where I would -- there was a lumber yard. I would work in\nthe lumber yard as a laborer there, and then, my wife with the baby would be there, I\nwould took a room, and --from a peasant -- p -- the pe -- the Polish peasants, the tiny little\nroom, you know, with the w -- iron stove -- stove with the pipe, and it -- one bed. Three\nof us would sleep in the one bed. Now, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a -- a wooden -- you know, s-story --\nit\u2019s a one story house, small. Now, I prepared there a very ground -- very deep cellar for\nmy father and my in-laws, they could not be in the open, you know, as Gentile people. So\nI prepared a -- a spot, a very low do -- very deep cellar. They would be, during the day, in\nthe cellar there, in hiding. At night, we\u2019d take them out, feed them, and they would go\nback to the cellar. And after three days, I went to get my father and my in-laws. After\nthree days, when I came there, unfortunately, was fire, and most of the buildings were on\nthe fire, I couldn\u2019t get even to our building. And my father and my in-laws were taken\naway into a concentration camp. So actually, none from our families, both families,\nnobody alive.",

We were not -- let\u2019s put it this way, we were not poor people, not very\nrich people, average families, but nice families, we got nice comfortable life and so on.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I had contact, I had, because when I was s -- in high school, there were Polish boys\ntogether with me too, we got a lot of friends, and you know, so -- and we were, you\nknow, there was always a little anti-Semitism there too, you probably heard about it, but\nwe -- we were never, you know, affected by it, you know, in general. But I would -- if\nyou want to know, there were look tha -- like all over the world, there all kind of people,\nyou see of the same na -- the same nationality even, you know. And [indecipherable]\nreligion, [indecipherable] look, there were some Polish people, there\u2019s -- you see, there\nwas an ordinance, that anyone that is hiding a Jew, if the Ge-Germans will find it, they\nwould be executed together with the Jews, the whole family. There were some, they were\nrisking their lives. There was a pro -- a Dr. Chizevitch in Warsaw. He, in his apartment,\nbroke a wall to other room, and put an artificial wall, they build special artificial wall that\nwouldn\u2019t recognize it\u2019s another room, you know? And had a special way he made it. And\nhe was hiding the dean of the medical school, Jewish Dr. Beck, B-e-c-k, and his wife and\ntwo children. And he saved their lives. Now, you can imagine he was in that room in his\napartment. If they would -- he risking -- he was risking his life, and he was risking you\nknow, th-the -- the whole family\u2019s life. And yet, he did it. And there were many like this.\nThere was one Polish -- a younger man with a wife, they got no children, he was hiding,\nthere was a somew -- not far from Warsaw, in a little town, they was hiding 1n the attic\nsix people, family, grandmother and so on, six people. But there wa -- th-there was -- it\ncame to a point that already, you know, they run out of money, also, p-pay them to, the\nwife of this man said, \u201cLook, no use to risk any more our life, let\u2019s give them up.\u201d He\ntook out a gun, he said, \u201cIf you give them up, I kill you, then myself, but I will never give\nthem up.\u201d And he saved them. Later I -- after the war, I saw to it that he got a big job in\nthe government. But, you see, there was some like this, many, many like this. But yet,\nthere were -- yo -- I told you about this doctor, the Jewish doctor, my friend that we\nescaped together with th -- when -- that he went to the hospital to get the job? You\nremember I told you that he was in the -- what my brother-in-law died. Now they settled\nhere with his wife in a town in -- in eastern part of Poland, and there was a Polish boy, 17\nor 16 years old, the son of a Polish peasant, who was very sick and needed an operation.\nHe operated on, and he saved his life. And the father of this boy called the Gestapo, here\nis a Jewish doctor, pretends to be Polish. You -- You -- But this -- those are not human\nbeings, you can\u2019t b -- you can\u2019t blame all the Polish people for it, because there are all\nkind of people in this world, you see what I mean? But th -- so I am not this kind of a\nperson that I would sc -- you know, blame a fr -- it was just individua -- individual thing,\nthere were all kind. I would say the intelligent people, and not only I mean educated, but\nth -- illiterate intelligent people, Polish people, they couldn\u2019t help maybe, but they would\nnever do a thing like this. But those who were illiterate peasants, you know, illiterate\npeople, th-they were -- they were dangerous. But otherwise, not. But anyway, now you\nhad more question, or --",

        "A: Yeah, actually, I -- yeah, I was, but you know, even -- we -- as I told you, we were\nZionists, we were [indecipherable] but we\u2019re not fanatics, you know, and -- normal\npeople. And, later on, when we were on Polish papers, you see, and we live -- I work in a\nlumber yard. I work in a lumber yard -- you want me to go on?",
        "A: So, you know, anyway, when I came t -- first of all, when I came back, I found out\nthat my in-laws, and my father, you know, were taken to concentration camp. I told you I\nwent there to get them, I came back, told my -- I had to tell my wife about it. You can fi -\n- riz -- realize how she felt about it, but we decided one thing, we\u2019re going to live for no\nother reason, to save the child. Do everything in our power to save the child, both of us.\nAnd we did it, we worked. My wife was going every week to church on Sundays. At\nnight, in the evening, before we\u2019re going to sleep you know, she used to, very loud at the\nwall, pray for the night, so the neighbor, you know, the one that we ri -- renting the room\nfrom, she would hear it, you see? And that\u2019s -- nobody would suspect us, you see, that we\nare Jewish. And, of course, we were raising the child, and we were very, very poor that --\nI mean, I was working, I was getting rations in the lumber yard, as a laborer, nothing. But\nthat was -- we were going through all kind of different times, and I also had to watch, you\nsee, very carefully, you know, that shouldn\u2019t sometime recognize, or something like this.\nThere was one -- one boy that was a clerk there, not a laborer like I, was v -- 18 years old.\nVery delicate, very gentle, good looking, and a blonde boy, and he always\n[indecipherable] he saw me to -- picking up a big piece of lumber, let\u2019s say, you know, to\nput away, he said, \u201cMr. Podalski,\u201d -- I was already in comparison old man, I was in my --\nyou know, 20\u2019s, he said, \u201cLet me help you.\u201d And I said to my wife many times when I\nwas coming to the -- where I -- walking distance from the lumber yard, I said, \u201cYou\nknow, there is working one boy, I am very suspicious about him, he is too delicate, he is\ntoo gentle. He\u2019s ats -- I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s not an average,\u201d you know. And I want -- I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to find out.\u201d And I walk over one day to him, I said, \u201cLook, Wally, how about\nto go with me Sunday to the church?\u201d I didn\u2019t go like my wife was going, I didn\u2019t, but\nyou know, I said Sunday to the church. He says, \u201cOkay, why not?\u201d And the church was\nabout three kilometers away from the lumberyard, you have to walk on the highways, and\non bo -- on the highway, on both sides of the highway were forests -- woods were. I\nwalked with him, I said to him, \u201cYou know, Wally,\u201d -- in Polish, of course, \u201cwhat would\n-- wis t -- what should we do if some Jewish people were hiding in the woods, would run\nout and attack us?\u201d He said, \u201cMr. Podalski, I don\u2019t think there are any, but if they are,\nthey are happy they will li -- that they are left alone. They\u2019re trying to be in hiding. They\nwouldn\u2019t torture, they wouldn\u2019t hurt us.\u201d I said, \u201cWally, I am Jewish, how about are\nyou?\u201d And he embraced me, he started to cry, the boy. He was Jewish, too. He was\n[indecipherable]. I wri -- I wrote about him, and that whole story, in my book, you know.\nSo, you know, he was Jewish, too, he was killed later. Anyway, we -- so we had all kind\nour tol -- our dow -- our daughter while we were there. One day, she devel -- she got sick,\nshe got very high fever, and my wife went with her by train to Warsaw, to the children\u2019s\nhospital, to check with the doctors. They check her, they said, \u201cOh my God, she has\ntuberculosis.\u201d And the only way we could save her would have -- she has a hole in her\nlung, the left lung. The only way we could help, if you could have gold injections, so we\ncould, you know, cover the -- with the gold injections, the -- the hole in the lung, and she\nwould be saved -- you know, got rid of the bi -- tuberculosis. We didn\u2019t -- We couldn\u2019t --\nWe wouldn\u2019t have a penny, we couldn\u2019t dream about gold injections. But then we had an\nidea. We had a very close friend, a Greek, Stamatos Kokinikis. He used to have in\nWarsaw, a factory of Halivah, you know, making. It was business, very good. And I used\nto -- I was an accountant. My wife graduated law school. I -- You know, and I, like a --\nyou know, like here, you know, accountant si -- let\u2019s say, you know, public, or a peer -- a\nregular accountant. Anyway, and I was taking care of his books, so my wife went to him.\nAnd I -- Later I found out that he was arrested few times even, because he was helping\nJewish people. But he had connections with the Italian embassy in Warsaw, because Italy\n-- Hitler and Mussolini were allies. So he said -- My wife told him about the gold\ninjections. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I get it for you.\u201d And he got it through the Italian\nconsulate. He got injections and he gave it, he save our child. And when she was in the\nhospital, his -- he had a maid, a Polish woman, who knew about it. She used to come to\nthe hospital to bring her goo -- you know, some good food and things, you know, to -- to\ngive the child, you know, the -- well, you know, she a Polish woman, you see, she was\ndoing it for her. So, anyway, and then sh -- when she was later okay, our daughter, and\nthere were times when we -- you know, were s -- were scared all the time, because we\nstill had to watch ourselves and so on, but somehow, you know, we\u2019re through -- the\nwhole t-time, or like this, and nobody could recognize us, you know. But one day, when\nthe -- the Jewish boy was killed, you see, 1 -- had -- I write a -- 1-1-1n the book about his\nfamily, and how they were -- why they were killed, and so on, but you know, we were\nscared that they may [indecipherable] because they knew that I was close already, you\nknow, always with the boy -- go nice with the boy, and that I was -- his parents were\nthere, living not far. So anyway, I put our daughter in a sanitortum, because you know, to\n-- altogether that she should be, you know, well taken care of, and so on. And we were\nwatching, and so on, and one day -- and I f -- the -- the Germans trucks surrounded the --\nthe lumber yard, looking -- I di -- that time I found out, looking for his fa -- the boy\u2019s\nparents. Now, what I found out -- not for his, but they looking for the more Jews there.\nWhat I found out anyway, that his father -- you see, they were from a different city, not\nfrom Warsaw, and he -- they were very well-to-do people, very well off, he had a big\nfactory, and so on. But his father in the -- they all pretend, three of them also, that they\nare, you know, Polish. But his father, in order to operate with the peasants, that they --\ntogether he was making -- they were making whiskey, you know, in many -- the some --\nin the villages some, you know, home made whiskey, and he was with them. And -- And\nI understood that -- that something came out that he probably was in there drunk, or\nsomething, that they suspe -- you know, that they called the Gestapo, that we think that\nthey are Jewish people. And they came one night there, and they killed him, and th -- th --\nthe -- the parents. But after this, you know, we were already shaken, we were very scared.\nSo one day, there was a man working in the -- a laborer, but he was working in the room\nwhere they had all kind of things there, you know, in the lumberyard, but anyway, a\nPolish man, and he came over there to our little room that we lived there, and he said,\n\u201cYou know, I had to get drunk to tell you, because I didn\u2019t have never spoke to you.\nSomebody here asked whether you are also Jewish. And I wouldn\u2019t like this should\nhappen to you, what happened to the [indecipherable] -- to the other one.\u201d Listen to this.\nAnd he said, \u201cBut my wife said to me, \u201cYou see, it\u2019s all your fault, especially that there\nwas that.\u2019\u201d\u2019 She says, \u201cY-You trying to, as a Polish officer, you\u2019re trying to do everything,\nyou know, for the [indecipherable] and th-th-then they call you here, they think that you\nare Jewish.\u201d You know what I mean? She just made it so that -- and he said, \u201cOh my\nGod, I am so -- I love you,\u201d he said, \u201cI,\u201d -- you know, changed completely. And\n[indecipherable] but we already scared. And then there was occasion I wrote about in\nthe book, I left the [indecipherable] and got the job in another place on the railroad, you\nknow, and somehow we survived like this, that in 1944, in August, were liberated by the\nRussian army. And you know that 1-1-1n \u201941, they started -- they became enemies, you\nknow, Russia and Germany, in 1941. So, for two years they were allies, and later they\nwere enemies. So that\u2019s what it was, and they were liberated that time. And so you go on\nfarther, what you want more?",

But one thing was\ncertain, that the child meant so much to us -- everything, not so much, that we decided,\nand you know, sometime -- was time we were hungry, but she was first. If we got a big\napple, I peeled the apple, I cut it up, I gave the pieces of apple to the baby, and my wife\nand I were just eating the -- the skin, or so, you know what I mean. And also, I very, very\n-- we\u2019re very -- th-that\u2019s -- we lived only -- we said we are going to live for one reason, to\nsave the child. And that\u2019s how we did it.",

And I\ndecided with my wife and the baby that we escape. And we escape from Warsaw to\nanother city. You know, left Warsaw to ano -- not to escape to, you know, like -- like we\n-- before, but you know, we just decided to leave it. I didn\u2019t tell anybody wi -- the -- the\ngovernment about it, you know. We went to another city, where we had friends there, and\n-- that survived, and we stayed there for awhile, fi -- not too long, and from there, we\nwent to -- we escaped to Czechoslovakia, and to Germany, to the American zone.

I was, when I was in the government, I was smuggling out [indecipherable] you\nmentioned the one Bricha, so I say I can tell you.
