        "A: So you asked me, July the eighth. No, wait, wait, the month. In poem you wrote first the\nmonth. {Female voice: The date.} The date, yes. All right, it was March 7, 1930.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: {Female voice continues: This is machine? }",
        "Q: Oh, it\u2019s okay. This is just for some of --.",
        "A: All right, March the seventh 1930.",
        "Q: And we\u2019re using Shulim not Shalom? Right?",
        "A: His name was Shulim actually, not Shalom. What do you have?",
        "Q: S-H-U-L-E-M?",
        "A: No, L-I-M, Shulim.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because with the \u201ce\u201d 1t would have been Shulem. No, Shulim. This is how you would read\nShulim?",
        "Q: Yes, this is right. He was born in Kolbuszowa?",
        "A: Kolbuszowa.",
        "Q: Someday Ill pronounce that right. And, okay so this was Leibush\u2019s son?",
        "A: This was Leibush\u2019s, Leibush\u2019s oldest son.",
        "Q: How many children were there in Leibush\u2019s family?",
        "A: He had, well the first one was born and he died after a week. So, three children, Shulim was the\noldest, you want the children\u2019s names?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: All right, the second one\u2019s name was Shlomo, he was born September the twentieth, \u201931. And\nthen was the daughter Raisa, how do you say? {Rose.} Well, Rosa; she was born February 15,\n1933. See, because I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll use this, but I have pictures, so I will give you the\npictures. So this was from the next batch.",
        "Q: And Leibush, he at this time owned his own sales general store?",
        "A: Leibush, he owned the same store as my father, I mean the same kind, wholesale general store.",
        "Q: I remember you saying Leibush was a big fellow?",
        "A: Well, he was not so big. In Kolbuszowa he was considered big, but he was known -- everybody\nis known for something and he was known for his strength. He was the strongest man, if\nsomebody wanted to give an example he strong, so they said he\u2019s as strong as Leibush. So he\nwas very well known, not that he used his strength for some fight or something, but he was\nknown as the strongest man in our town.",
        "Q: Is this something Shulim would have been proud of?",
        "A: Yes, I was very proud of it, because nobody would start up with me but he never got involved,\nbut he was, I was always be proud. And also when Jews never stood up against anything what\nwas done to them, Leibush was one, he wouldn\u2019t take abuse. And there was one I write in the\nother book, once there was a draft commission, you know a draft commission came to our town\nto take the boys who had to go to draft, so they came a few high Polish officers and a military\ndoctor, and they conducted the draft. So once when Jews had to go to to the bigger\ntown, they went by wagon, they went by autobus. The autobus went once a day, eight in the\nmorning to so when the Jewish people, some Jewish people wanted to go on the\nautobus, so those officers were standing by the door, they didn\u2019t let in Jews and Leibush --. I\ncan, stop it......where were we?",
        "Q: We were talking a little bit about Leibush.",
        "A: Okay, he had the store. I started to tell you about-----so those two officers, the three officers\nwere standing in the doorway they didn\u2019t let in nobody, no Jews because they wanted to go to\nthe big town. And there came also was standing a young woman and she had a sheitl a wig,\nbecause they were very religious, so when she wanted to go in they grabbed her by the hair and\nthey pulled down the wig, she was very embarrassed because they were shamed. When my\nbrother saw that they don\u2019t let her in, they pulled off the wig, and he was this time, I would say\nabout twenty years old, or twenty-one years old. But he went and he wanted to go and he\npushed the officer, and it was a high officer, he pushed him so fast, he was standing there, that\nhe fell on the other one and the other one, they all, three or four, they all fell down. And\nnaturally he was afraid, so he run away, then the police came and they arrested my brother and\nthere was a big case and they took about four, five years. This was taken to J toa\nsuperior court and they made a big issue because who would touch a Polish officer? The main\nthing, after he knocked them down all the Jews went in that car, but they had my brother\narrested. But the main thing was that they asked the woman to be a witness who was pulled\ndown the wig, and she didn\u2019t want to be a witness, she was afraid. But then later we had to hire\nbig lawyers and it cost money and this was, but he was known about his strength. When he was\nyounger, I was a very poor eater so my mother used to say \u201cI never had trouble with Leibush,\nbecause Leibush, when put down for breakfast a bread, he finished the whole bread. He\nfinished the whole loaf.\u201d So they ask Leibush, they ask him, \u201cWhen do you know that you have\nenough?\u201d He was not fat, when do you know it\u2019s enough?\u201d So he said, he never said when he\u2019s\nfull or something, {when the muscles} not the muscles, how you call this?",
        "Q: Jaw?",
        "A: The jaw. When the jaw starts to hurt you, then he knows he has enough. And there were other\ncases that, the peasant people they always wanted to show off their strength and there was one,\nhe was known as strong. So he came over once and said \u201cLet\u2019s wrestle.\u201d My brother said I\ndon\u2019t want to wrestle, I\u2019m not a wrestler. He said \u201cLet\u2019s wrestle.\u2019 He wanted to show he is\nstronger, so my brother didn\u2019t want to bother, and later he bothered him and he said \u201cOkay, let\u2019s\nwrestle.\u201d So they took off their jacket, the other guy took off his jacket. It took a second, the\nother one was stretched out. So then he said that he approved he\u2019s the strongest. And then he\nwas with me in the woods after a year and we escaped from the camp. But in the end he died of\na heart attack, actually he had cancer in his mouth and then they gave him so much cortisone\nthat, awful big dose, that he went for a visit to Israel and while he was on the visit to Israel he\ndied and the dead was a heart attack, but this was caused by the cortisone. So this is about\nLeibush. Now, about Shulim, now you have written down here, I don\u2019t know, you have the\nrecord.....",
        "Q: I have the copy back in my office.",
        "A: Shulim, here is not pronounced right, it\u2019s not the A is not important. All right, so\nthis you have corrected. Now, you want me to read this over and correct it what is here?",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s see.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see what is important, what\u2019s not important. Now this was written on the ID, let\u2019s see what\nwe can correct. He\u2019s a very beautiful boy, my nephew, I don\u2019t see that this uh.....",
        "Q: Yeah, I think we\u2019re not going to use that voice. You know, it\u2019s going to be written.",
        "A: Him. Right, so he cannot say I\u2019m a very beautiful boy. He is three years old, his parents\ndressed him in a player\u2019s show, cut his hair for the first time and brought him to the teacher at\nthe religious school, at the cheder. His father can hardly wait for the day when Shulim will\nbegin his public school education. I think this is very.....1t\u2019s not the right language.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So they can get better language, \u201939 the Germans have taken over our town, Shulim nine years\nold, knows that he no longer goes to school because all the Jewish schools have been shut\ndown. He didn\u2019t have no Jewish schools, this was public schools and Jews couldn\u2019t attend\npublic schools anymore, not that the Jewish schools were shut down. And he cannot walk on\nthe sidewalks, this was not right in the beginning, Jews could walk on the sidewalks, but this\nwas not the main thing because he is a Jew. But he doesn\u2019t understand what lies behind these\nrules because I think the whole thing is, he couldn\u2019t go to school because Jewish schools were\nshut down; all schools were shut down. In 1944 Shulim turned twelve in 1942 the Germans\nwere, we can say we were at this time in the ghetto in Kolbuszowa.",
        "Q: In \u00b042?",
        "A: In 42, because the ghetto was established in July \u201941. The Germans law was that all Jews\ntwelve years and up had to wear the yellow armband. We didn\u2019t have a yellow armband. The\nwhite with the blue Star of David. Had to wear the white and blue armband, there was nothing,\nand register for work. This 1s okay, we had to register from 12 to 60. Getting the band was\nsuch a proud moment for Shulim, to him it meant he was now a man, that he was growing up to\nbe like his father. He never realized that it was part of the Nazi, I don\u2019t use the word Nazi, as the\nGermans plan to kill the Jews. I don\u2019t who the Nazis, Shulim and German, maybe we can say\nthe picture, because we\u2019ll take out , the picture that he asked me, or he can say I asked\nmy uncle to make a picture and I have a picture the day he put on the armband.",
        "Q: I know that picture.",
        "A: The picture, and when he shows off the band, because he was so proud of it so maybe this can\nbe incorporated.",
        "Q: So he asked you?",
        "A: Yes, he bothered me.",
        "Q: Uncle Naftali, can you make a picture of me with the....?",
        "A: Yeah. Then I made the picture and I took the other children also and he showed the band.\nQ\nHe put it on the other arm?",
        "A: Well, no he had it on the right arm. He had it on the right arm, but he pulls out the arm to show\nthe picture; he was so proud of it. Shulim was transported with his mother, brother and sister to\nBelges death camp where he was killed in July 1942. Now, should we.....",
        "Q: July 19?",
        "A: No, July, I don\u2019t know the date.",
        "Q: Just July, 1942.",
        "A: July, 1942 because I don\u2019t know because they were kept in the trains, but in July he was killed.\nNow I don\u2019t know if we should write anymore about his father, that his father survived, or just\nto let it go.",
        "Q: Probably just let it go.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: What else do you remember about Shulim as a child?",
        "A: Well I remembert....",
        "Q: Did he like certain things?",
        "A: He was a very good- looking boy, he was really very -- and he was a very good student, when\nhe started to go to school. Because after all he went already three years in public school was\nfrom six to nine, and he was a very, very good student.",
        "Q: So he went to public school and also to.....?",
        "A: Yes, he went to public school and after public school he went to cheder, to a Jewish school, like\neverybody else. From eight to twelve or one, we went to public school. Then in the afternoon,\nfrom two on, I think we went to cheder. And when the war broke out there was nothing left\nanymore, what else, there is nothing.",
        "Q: Did he ever help on the work detail?",
        "A: Well, when he started, when he was twelve years old, he was sent out like everybody else, work\ndetails. It was arranged by the Judenrat, by the Jewish Council for the Germans to come and\ngrab people from the streets, their houses, so it was arranged how many was in the work force\nfrom the ghetto, so everybody got a card that this and this day he has to report to work. They\nworked, they sent them out, since he became 12, he worked, came out two or three times a week\nto go to work, in the winter mostly by snow and the summer on the roads and other things. And\nwe lived together because in the ghetto we moved in the apartment where Leibush lived; so\nhappens that this apartment was in the place where the part of the ghetto was at. And we got the\nroom and we worked together, we lived together. He wasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t so bad because my\nbrother he was a member of the Judenrat, the first Judenrat and he was selected by the\nabout which we will talk later and then later he was arrested but, in the book it\u2019s\nwritten how he was released because only three Jews were released from jail, the rest were\nkilled, the whole Judenrat. Leibush\u2019s father is still in the ghetto, he had his store because this\nwas the place that he was not thrown out. So, how much he could buy and market things and\nthis way he was not bad off in the ghetto. They had enough, everything. Until it was the\ntransport to J and J to Belges and then they were killed.",
        "Q: So they lived in an apartment, that\u2019s what they had?",
        "A: Well, they had an apartment, the apartment was of two large rooms and a large kitchen, so when\nwe moved into the ghetto we took over the large kitchen, I say we, I mean my father, my\nmother, and I and two sisters. So we had the kitchen, and he with his three children had the\nbedroom, so we lived together what we used the same kitchen and they had this one room. But\nhe also had, in the basement, he had the store still, there was not too much merchandise, but\nhow much he could buy from black marketeeers, so he had, and he was busy in the store.",
        "Q: So he lived above the store?",
        "A: He lived above the basement, yeah, and we lived in the same.....and he was lucky in this time\nthat his apartment, his store was in the ghetto. Like for us, they threw us out from our house and\nto go into the ghetto, but he was there, so we came to live with him. Now, if we wouldn\u2019t live\nfrom him there would be other people, but this way when we took it over, so nobody else came\nin the house. But the main thing is from Shulim, also here you have written down 1945, Shulim\nwas born the same year as Richard, my older brother\u2019s son, but Richard was born in America.\nMy brother had moved there after a pogrom in our town in 1919. I always think of these two,\nRichard now a doctor in America, Shulim killed in Poland at 13, not 13 but 12. See the people\nare so stupid, they know by he was born in 1930 and he was killed in 1942, but here they mark\ndown 13. So he was born when he was 12 years old. So this, I think, this is a very nice\nsentence, that to compare those two, Richard now a doctor in America and Shulim killed in\nPoland at the age of twelve. So, what you can write too much, but I think what you have is\nenough material.",
        "Q: Anything distinguishing about his mother that you remember?",
        "A: Well, his mother was a housewife and she took care of -- nothing distinguished. She took care\non the house and Leibush took care on the store, but nothing special. But maybe to mark down\nthat Leibush survived the war. That Leibush survived the war with me in the woods and died in\nAmerica in 1960. Okay, now we have this, we have this and they will be the same kind of\npassports, the new ones?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well that is a very nice format, it looks very good. The only thing it should be correct.",
        "Q: Exactly.",
        "A: No who do we go now? To",
        "Q: Yeah, that would be very interesting to do.",
        "A: Passports come out, send the corrected passports this way. I want to keep it, I have always\ncollections I would like. Now Naftali you went over mine, so we don\u2019t have to add anything on\nmine.",
        "Q: No, no.",
        "A: Now, what you want Dr. Anderman. His name was Leon Anderman.",
        "Q: A-N-D-E-R-M-A-N?",
        "A: A-N-D-E-R-M-A-N, yeah. Leon Anderman, he came to Kolbuszowa from uh, it came out the\nbook, All Physicians in Poland and he was a mention to that I dated back to my nephew but that\nwas written the year when he was born, the date. Anyway, he came to Kolbuszowa in the early\n20\u2019s and he -- well not in the 20\u2019s mark down in the 20\u2019s, I don\u2019t know if the early twenties. So\ncross off the early twenties. He became the physician of Kolbuszowa. There were in this time,\nthere were two doctors in Kolbuszowa; it was the county doctor, the official doctor which we\ncalled the physic, and then there it was this private doctor. Mostly Jews used him, he was\nvery.....",
        "Q: Used Dr. Anderman?",
        "A: Dr. Anderman, yeah. He was a very assimilated Jew, he didn\u2019t have anything to do with the\nJewish causes, he never stepped in the synagogue, and so was his wife. They had one son, he\nwas about two years younger than I was; his name was Jurek, J-U-R-E-K. He was -- he never\nattended a cheder, or to a Jewish school. His wife had never any contact with Jewish women.\nHe was very respected by the Polish community as he was an officer in the Polish army, in the\nreserve army, he was also an officer yet in the Austrian army.",
        "Q: Where was he from originally?",
        "A: He was originally from a town near Tarnople, this is near Stanislovov this is near the Russian\nborder, there was a few brothers he was originally from there. He started medicine in Vienna,\nbecause this belonged to ---. Too bad I don\u2019t have the book because in the book it\u2019s written\nexactly the date when he was born, when he graduated.",
        "Q: Is it a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of ---?",
        "A: Only doctors, a book about physicians in Poland.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: Who died, who were killed. It\u2019s a thick book, if you want to know I can find out exactly, you\nwant to know about this, is it important?",
        "Q: Yeah, I\u2019d like to try to get his birth date.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I may even be able to find this book at the Library of Congress.",
        "A: It\u2019s book, he has it, so I\u2019ll give it to you. Give Kevin the information, [ll tell him to make a\ncopy.....information of Dr. Anderman. It\u2019s also, certain things is not correct also. Somebody\nwho wrote it didn\u2019t know. Well, anyway he, said he never bothered with Jewish causes when\nthe first time when they threw out the Jews from Germany in this was the first time\nthat he came. They organized a committee in every little town to help the German Jews who\nwere thrown out and we organized in Kolbuszowa also and this is the first time he took part for\nit. And I remember the first time that he attended shul when he spoke about giving money to\nthis organization to help. The second time I remember he came to shul to speak that when\nbefore the war started and the Polish government saw that there have to be a war, so they\nwanted the citizens should donate money to buy airplanes because the Polish air force didn\u2019t\nhave too many airplanes; they had a few. So, they collected money so I remember he, this is the\nsecond time he came to shul, he spoke to the Jews, naturally he spoke Polish. Spoke to the Jews\nwilling to give money, and I remember his words, he said, \u201cToday we beg you to give the\nmoney, but in a few months, I am afraid they will take it without.\u201d He meant the Germans, they\nwould take it without begging you, without asking you. He asked the people for money, and\nthen this was the first two times, when the war started he was drafted as a reservist, as a doctor\nto the army. He was taken to a prisoners\u2019 camp in an officers\u2019 prisoner of war camp. And then\nlater he was released, short after he was released and see, in this book was written exactly\nwhere he was interned.",
        "Q: This was after the German invasion?",
        "A: After the German invasion, he was in the army, they drafted him, they drafted all the doctors\nand he was a reserve officer, being a doctor so they drafted him. And then he was taken as a\nprisoner of war, and he came back to Kolbuszowa he started to run his office. When the\nGermans ordered the Jews should make a Judenrat, that means a Jewish council, and there was\none Jew who right away volunteered. As the Germans came in he started to be an important\nman by the Germans, he started to come to the commandant and he started to tell them all kinds\nof stories. He was not a very person, this..... he started to tell them which Jews have hidden\nmerchandise, as a matter of fact my father suffered very much from this Jew. Like he came to\nmy -- the Germans liked coffee, coffee beans. He came to my -- and we had coffee\nbeans hidden so he came every day for coffee beans. Today he wanted two kilo, the next day\nthree kilo and then four kilo....and then my father told him how much can I give you, I mean\nwe don\u2019t have new shipments. He said to him a well, if you take so much water out it will be\ndry. So he said well if you don\u2019t want to give more I will take it, so he went to the Germans and\nhe squealed that my father has hidden merchandise. They came over and they took away\neverything we had. I remember it was three days that they went and loaded everything we had\nbecause he squealed.",
        "Q: Not just coffee, everything?",
        "A: Everything, they took everything, they took even personal things, everything because they said\nthat he ---. They took away everything, we had a lot of merchandise because this merchandise\ncould be sold and we could have money, but they took away everything. My father ran away,\nand then because he was afraid that they will arrest him, I run away and this time I run away to\nRussia, which later I came back. And he, and this man wanted to become the president because\nthe Germans said you have to organize a Jewish council, but the Jews knew if he would become\ncouncil, it would be very bad for the Jews because he was, like I said. Before the war\neverybody knew somebody wanted to have a witness in court, if there was a court case and they\nneeded a witness, he would always be a witness for money, naturally. So even there was here in\nAmerica there are sayings if I speak to some people from Kolbuszowa and I ask them\nsomething and they don\u2019t want to tell me a lie, so they said, what do you think, I am this and\nthis? I don\u2019t want to mention his name because he has his family. So they say, what do you\nthink I am him? He was known that he is \u2014 for money he can be a witness. So then we Jews\nknew that if he would become the president it would be bad for Jews because he would\ncollaborate with the Germans. So the Jews started to speak to prominent Polish Catholics,\nespecially to the mayor, who we told him that we are very concerned that he would become the\npresident, not only this, because if he will be president he will pick out members, his friends,\nhis like, and then it will be bad. We the Jews, I say we, I say the Jews themselves, say the only\none who could actually be stronger than him is Dr. Anderman, he didn\u2019t look Jewish, I mean he\ndidn\u2019t have a beard, most of the Jews had beards and he spoke beautiful German because he\nstarted in Vienna and he was a proud man and he would never -- he would be able to protect the\nJews. A group of Jewish people went to him and they said to him he should\nbecome so he said, I was never involved with Jewish things, I am a doctor. I don\u2019t\nwant to be a politician, and I don\u2019t want to have a job like this. The Jews begged him, they told\nhim, look if you don\u2019t do it, you are the only one, can protect us from this man and he knew that\nthis man is no good for the Jews. Well, anyway, after a few times. I remember my father went\nto him and others, he said all right, I will do it against my judgment, I will do it, only on one\ncondition. If I will -- he had to pick out ten or twelve members of the council, -- only if I can\npick out the people I want. So, he made the list and he picked out mostly younger people,\nmostly people without beards, and that shouldn\u2019t be, again, the Germans shouldn\u2019t dislike them\nand also, people who were in the Jewish community leaders before the war. They were people,\nrespected citizens, and people who were quite well off and he picked out this Jewish council\nwhich included my brother Leibush, and my brother-in-law Sh , well younger people. He\norganized the Jewish council which was a blessing for Kolbuszowa because before the Germans\nused to grab people from the streets from their houses for work. He organized and made lists,\nand everything that had to be done was done through the organization. If you want more\ndetails, in the book I have more details about Anderman.",
        "Q: So around July 41 he became the head of the Judenrat?",
        "A: No, no. He became head of the Judenrat in, before the ghetto, he became head of the Judenrat\nin the middle of \u201940. In the middle of \u201940, even earlier, I would say in spring of \u201940, spring\n1940, yeah. And then he ran the Judenrat and it was run very -- he was very just, and if they\nhad to take money because they needed for certain things, he always took it from people that\nhad money. If you want a few details you read the book about this chapter, you\u2019Il see he was a\nvery fair man, and I liked him very much. Later he opened an ambulatorium, a free clinic\nbecause he was a doctor and he knew a lot of people don\u2019t have money, so my sister and the\nbrother-in-law who was also a member of the Judenrat, had the empty store because he was in\nthe flower business, and in the war they didn\u2019t have flower, so he opened in his store the\nambulatori1um. He was there two or three times a week in the afternoon, and everybody who\nwas sick, especially the poorer people came there and he treated them without fee. He needed\nhelp so he asked me with other friend of mine, and he became -- we worked and he started to\nteach me how to dress wounds and how to clean boils and all these things and I was very good\nas I always wanted to be a doctor, I was very good at it. I went there and for this, because I was\nwith him, this work released me from going to work on the roads or something and I worked\nwith him for over a year in this ambulatorium.",
        "Q: When did that open? That ambulatorium?",
        "A: This ambulatorium opened in the middle of \u201940, yeah, I would say in the summer of 1940. And\nI worked with him with my friend, we........Then later more and more, I was more skilled, so a\nlot of things I could do, special with wounds and dressings and all those things.",
        "Q: You saw Poles and Jews there?",
        "A: No, no only Jews. No Poles, they had their doctors there, he wasn\u2019t allowed to treat Poles; the\nGermans forbid a Jewish doctor to treat Poles. Then also he gave me a job, before the war I\nwas the buyer for my father\u2019s store and I used to go to different towns. They needed somebody\nto bring in the flour and other food what Germans gave on carts to the Jews, and this had to be,\nwe had to bring it from Jeshup, from other towns. Also we had to buy a lot of stuff from the\nblack market, like potatoes, they didn\u2019t give us enough, other things that we needed we opened\na public kitchen, a soup kitchen in -- he organized a soup kitchen. The kitchen needed certain\nthings that the Germans didn\u2019t give us, so I -- they picked me up and I went out twice a week to\ndifferent towns. I got a pass and I could go out and I could travel, and I brought in all those\nthings that the Jewish community got officially from the Germans. By going out and having this\npass, I also could buy a lot of black market for the Jewish -- for the soup kitchen we needed,\nand also I bought on the black market for myself, for my family. I brought in stuff and they\nsold it so they could make something out of it, my father. So this was how we worked with\nAnderman and I became very, very friendly with Anderman and I admired him because he was\nvery fair. There was something, a question about having privileges, the people who were in the\nJewish council, they wanted to take advantage, he always was against it. Again in his book, you\nhave the stories about it. Then they organized the ghetto, they organized the ghetto so he was\nresponsible for the Jewish should have where to live. He built a house a year before the war,\nand this was the most exclusive, the most beautiful house in Kolbuszowa very ---. It was a\nmodern house, this was the only house what had electricity and was the only house who had\nindoor plumbing. You see, he had a, not compressor, what you call it, to make electricity.",
        "Q: A generator?",
        "A: He had a generator and the generator produced enough electricity to take care on the toilets,\nwith the water. It was a beautiful house, it had nice furniture, so this the head of\nthe county, the German who was very vicious, his name was Twardon. And Twardon wanted to\ntake over his house for himself because it was 1n a nice section. So he urged Anderman to take\nover an apartment in the ghetto, in the place where the ghetto is. He said to him, you take,\nbecause you are the head of the Judenrat, pick out the best apartment for yourself. Anderman\nsaid I will not pick out an apartment until the last Jew has a roof over his head. And if the Jews\nwill be settled, then I will take it. See, he wanted to move in his apartment, then later said to\nhim, I want to move in the apartment but he wanted a Jews should give him 10,000 zloty to\nrenovate the apartment. He said renovate it, it\u2019s just a new house, it\u2019s just a year old. And\nbesides, why do you have to renovate, you wouldn\u2019t live long in this house, the war will end\nand I will go back to the house. See, he didn\u2019t like these answers.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a very bold thing to say.",
        "A: Yes, yes, well he didn\u2019t like these answers, so on a certain day this was about, I would say about\ntwo weeks after the ghetto was established, Twardon came and he arrested the whole Judenrat,\neverybody in the Judenrat. Besides the Judenrat he also arrested about ten more people, and\nnaturally for the town it was a very big shock they arrested, but Anderman was free. Everybody\nsaid Anderman he\u2019s the father of us and he will try to go out and try to see that they should be\nreleased. He went and spoke to this Twardon so two days later, or a day later he was arrested.\nOnce he was arrested we felt that the situation was very grave because he was the only one who\ncould --. They were in jail in Kolbuszowa about two weeks.",
        "Q: So the whole Judenrat except him was arrested first?",
        "A: First, yes, and then later he was arrested, two days later. So, he -- now my brother was arrested,\nmy brother-in-law wasn\u2019t arrested, because my brother-in-law, I\u2019m writing also in the book,\nthere was before the ghetto was established they took a certain amount of Jews from the market\nplace and they sent them away to have less Jews by us. He wasn\u2019t there, so they didn\u2019t arrest\nhim. Later though he came back, we paid money, he came back, so there was no Judenrat. Now\nwe were alone so naturally the police started to come in and the police started to make orders\nbut then he said he\u2019s looking for a new head of the Judenrat. While they were sitting in jail,\nthey were also sitting two brothers, their name was Rappaport, Yanchi Rappaport and Pashi\nRappaport and they were Jews without beards, they were young, they were educated Jews.\nThey had their business before the war that they used to send pigs to Katervitz it\u2019s a big town\nnear the German border, this was their business, so Anderman said....",
        "Q: Pigs they sent?",
        "A: Yeah, this was their business. They bought pigs, they sent them out, they slaughtered them, they\nsent the meat to this town and they had this business. It was a very unusual business for Jews\nbut they were not observant Jews, so this is what they did. Anderman knew -- we knew that\nTwardon\u2019s looking for a new but he wants to have someone with authority, so even in\njail, because in jail they lived in one big basement, it was not like a regular jail, but they kept\nthem in the basement from the magistrate building. So Anderman said that if he would ask\nsomebody to become the president of Judenrat everybody should refuse. This way if\neveryone would refuse and to say that they cannot take care on this only Anderman can. This\nmaybe will force them to let out Anderman. Meanwhile this Rappaport who was there he didn\u2019t\nlisten to him and he told his wife to go to Twardon and tell him that her husband, this Pashik\nRappaport is willing to become Judenrat. That he\u2019s young, he\u2019s energetic, he\u2019s good looking\nand the German would like him, and he speaks good German and they have a business in\nK . He looked at her, she was a good looking woman and one day the police came and\nthey took out this Pashik and they saw that he --. They take him away to the office where the\n___ so right away Jews started to suspect but he said oh nobody will become the ald __.\nAnyway he spoke to Twardon and he told Twardon he would be a good Judenrat man and he\nwill serve the Germans and all these things and he released him and his brother from jail, and he\nmade the president and his brother the assistant. Once this happened, Anderman said now we\nhave lost everything. We didn\u2019t believe that a Jew would do it but he did and this man started to\npick out members of the Judenrat. Naturally he picked out different kinds of people that\nAnderman wanted. Anderman wanted the best quality and he picked out from the people that\nthey were servant. He was in the cattle business so he took a few people who were in the cattle\nbusiness and a few black marketers. He made a new Judenrat. Now the new Judenrat started to\nwork and then the Polish population wanted to take away Anderman. Anderman could go out\nbecause, as a matter of fact, practically every night he went out to sleep in some Polish house.\nThis was watched, this jail was watched by the municipal police. They knew him so they let\nhim out and the next day before dawn he came back. The Polish people begged him not to go\nback. Eventually they would do something with those people, they will not keep them forever.\nHe didn\u2019t listen; he said that the Jews cannot take care. I am the one who can speak to the\nGermans for them; they listen to me. He didn\u2019t run away and then one day they came and they\ntook all of them away to J . They let out only three Jews, they let out, my brother\nincluded. If you read the book you will know the reason why. My brother-in-law came back\nfrom J. so Twardon said that there are some members of the first Judenrat, they should take\nthem in. They became in the second Judenrat. They were in J about two weeks. After two\nweeks they took all of them to Auschwitz and this time Auschwitz was not so prominent as\nlater. They took them to Auschwitz and as they took them to Auschwitz, the families start to\nreceive telegrams. They said this one died from cancer, this one died on pneumonia, this one\ndied trying to escape.\nLet me flip the tape.\nEND OF SIDE A, TAPE 1",
        "Q: Very good, yeah.",
        "A: Must be -- because I bought one, it\u2019s not very good. All right so there came the telegrams and\nalways the telegrams had something to say. They had to sign, somebody died, let\u2019s say on lung\ncancer. Why they had to sign that he suffered from lung cancer a long time. Why they did it,\nwhy they make so evident a ------; somebody died on some other sickness, that he suffered from\nit. Then a week after they received the telegrams and you could see the postman came in went\ninto a house, that right away you could hear the crying and the screaming so we knew that he\ncomes with a telegram. About two weeks later, the same people received bills from Auschwitz\nwith bills to pay for the cremation with some ashes. They had to pay for the cremation. This is\nhow Anderman was gone. Meanwhile when he was arrested, his wife and son were left in\nKolbuszowa with non-Jewish friends. They went to Warsaw and they lived this Aryan as\nCatholics in Warsaw. His wife survived but the son was an officer in the Polish underground\nwhen it was the Warsaw uprising. Not the Warsaw uprising but the Jews of the general Warsaw\nuprising, he was killed in the uprising. His wife survived and after a while she came over here\nan old broken woman. She died here in America. For Anderman, when he was arrested so the\nPolish people, even the mayor who was in went to V and told them he should be\nreleased if he says the Polish patriot and he is such an honest man. He says this is why we\narrested him, he was too honest. I think that this Anderman that what he did for the Jews that he\nnever, never associated with the Jews, that he was an exceptional man. I always say if the Jews\nwould ever have saints like the Catholics have saints, Anderman should have been a saint.\nBecause he could have survived, he had a possibility; he had help from the Polish people, he\nwas considered to be a Polish Catholic. He said ,No, I cannot do it, I have to stay with the Jews\nbecause the Germans listen to me and they respect me.",
        "Q: Do you think he just went a little too far with the Germans?",
        "A: He went a little too far.",
        "Q: He was a little too resistant?",
        "A: Well, he tried because he saw that they respected him so certain times he went a little too far.\nHe was not a person that we call it like a Jew-boy. He always had his pride and for the\nGermans, he was not good. If you read the book, you will see a lot of things that I gave\nexamples of what he did. It was a little too much so he died.",
        "Q: When you were part of the Polish army you were able to go to Auschwitz and you found those\nphotos of Anderman?",
        "A: Yeah, well I didn\u2019t found it in this time. Later, a few years later, usually --. No, the photos of\nAnderman I had because I save them. This is one photo, I think from the thirties and one what I\nhad when he built the new house was few years, a year before the war.",
        "Q: Sitting outside the house?",
        "A: Sitting outside the house, I have it. Then I got a photo of his son. His wife gave me the photo\nwhen she was here. Now his photos from Auschwitz, now usually the Germans didn\u2019t make\nmug shots from prisoners. They had millions and millions, I don\u2019t know what they did, ;\nNow the people who were selected to be, to go the gas chambers. As you know, about 85%\nright away went to the gas chambers; about 15% they went to the camp. So the people who\nwent to the gas chambers didn\u2019t get the tattoos. Only the people who went to the right or to the\nleft like they had the selection. But very few, Anderman naturally was not -- all the\nKolbuszowa were not gassed right away. This time, there were no transports to Auschwitz.\nThis was a camp where they took mostly Polish people were in the underground or were in the\nblack market. Jews who were called for one reason or another, like the Judenrat. So they didn\u2019t\nhave selections; they were in the camp, some a week, some, some were two weeks. Because he\nwas doctor, and because he was an important person, they made him mug shots. This is the first\ntime I saw that somebody got out. The mug shots that I got out about ten years later, about ten\nyears from Anderman. They kept Anderman, for this I have the number and the triangles\nbecause they have two kinds of triangles. Jews have always had triangles, if he was a criminal\nor political, the Jews usually had two. They had political and Jews so the triangle made like a\nmyogen David. So one was a red one which was a certain other transgressions and the other one\nwas the yellow, the yellow was for Jews. So I got later from Auschwitz.",
        "Q: What was his, do you know? What triangles did he have? Do you know the colors?",
        "A: Usually Jews had red and blue. One was political and one was Jewish. On this, it\u2019s black and\none, so I don\u2019t know. But this is probably what Jews had.",
        "Q: Once he was deported, you never heard from him again?",
        "A: Once he was taken to Czechowice. He was in Czechowice about two weeks. When he was in\nCzechowice together with the other people from Kolbuszowa; this time they arrested not only in\nKolbuszowa they arrested in other towns from the section where Czechowice was the head\ntown. We used to come to one place every week with packages for them because there was one\nof the guards that he could be bribed. We gave him money and he took the packages with\nletters for them. If they arrived, I don\u2019t know. Because I had a pass to go out from the ghetto, I\ntold you I went two, three times to buy, to bring the stuff, so I was the one who brought over the\npackages. We met in one place and there I met people from all other towns from around us.\nEverybody did the same thing. They brought the packages and later this German, somebody\ncame. They took the packages, they got paid and he supposedly gave them the food. But we\nnever found out because he never brought back letters. We send them letters. He could take the\nmoney, take the food -- but so long as there was hope, everybody sent them. I think once they\ncame in, that they brought back letters. He was there about ten days or two weeks. After two\nweeks they send both to Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, after a few weeks, I think after two weeks,\nthe telegrams started to come.",
        "Q: Did you know what his said, his telegram?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know because his telegram didn\u2019t arrive because there was nobody to send a telegram.",
        "Q: Because his wife and son had left?",
        "A: His wife disappeared. They disappeared the day he was arrested. But the other people, the\ntelegrams came and I saw the telegrams. Mostly the telegram says that we want to let you\nknow that your husband, this and this day, he died of cancer or he died on lung failure, TB. She\nhad to sign that he suffered from TB. Then some they were killed while trying to escape. But\nthis was not --.",
        "Q: You suspect he was gassed at Auschwitz versus being executed?",
        "A: No, they were all gassed, they were all gassed. But in the beginning, we don\u2019t know because\nthis was in 1941. This was towards --.",
        "Q: They were still building the crematorium?",
        "A: They were still building it, so I don\u2019t know if this were gas or executed, we don\u2019t know. I\nwould suspect that there was one --. The crematorium was already there. But the gas chambers\nI don\u2019t think were there. I never looked into it but I should have because after the war I was on\nthe commission. There was a commission that studied the crimes for the Germans. I was a\nmember of this commission which was headed by Hewlett Johnson (?). He was the Dean of\nCanterbury. {You have photos of him, don\u2019t you Norman?} Yes, I have photos of him. The\nArchbishop of Canterbury and he was the head. The members of this commission were\nprofessors of universities from all over the world. There was an American, a Russian and I was\nsent from the Polish government. There were two delegates from the Polish government. I was\none and the other one was, his name was Meega. But his name was not Meega, he was a lawyer\nfrom Cracow, his name was Dissenfeld. Later he lived in England. He was a lawyer before the\nwar.",
        "Q: A Jew?",
        "A: A Jew, yeah, distant. But then he masqueraded as a non-Jew. His name, he changed it to\nMeega. We were both sent but we were sent as members to this commissions, from the secret\npolice. Because they wanted to know what contacts they had, this delegation. They didn\u2019t trust\nnobody. So this Hewlett Johnson who was quote a \u201cRed Dean\u201d because he was very pro-\ncommunism. He was archbishop. They wanted to know what connections he had with the\nPolish underground, with all those things. We were sent and officially we were members of the\nPolish delegation but our mission was completely different. This Hewlett Johnson, the reason\nthey called him the \u201cRed Dean\u201d was because when it was the Korean War, he went to Korea and\nhe wrote how the Americans behaved and what the Americans are doing, very pro-communist.\nThen later I wanted to go and I went over to one commentator and wanted to tell him how he\nwas misled. How we arranged his meetings with the Polish peasants, with the Polish patriots so\nthat everything was such officially done and everything was lies. That the government did it\njust to show him. Then later, he said to me, listen they won\u2019t bother you, don\u2019t start because\nyou came over here. They will ask you how you know those things and --. So [I let it go. I\nwent, his last name, his name Barry Gray. He was a very outspoken commentator, I went to\nhim. He said to me, you come over here, you had so much trouble. Don\u2019t go into more trouble.\nI could find out from Auschwitz in the beginning everything because I was the authority but\nthere were so many things. The war was still going on that this was secondary to --. But I\nmade pictures in Auschwitz, I have the pictures still today. You don\u2019t have all because we\ndidn\u2019t come yet to those pictures. This is -- I made a list, the pictures that I gave you. Is\nsupposed to be 150 but actually 1t was 153 because some were made A.B.C.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: So this is Anderman. Taken in --. I have the date but I don\u2019t know if you want to have the date\nfor the picture, no?",
        "Q: No. Just need their birth dated, approximately.",
        "Q: Birth dates I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s see, if they were three and a half years old and it was \u00b038, \u201939,\n\"40, \u00b041. They were born in the second half of \u201938, both of them. I don\u2019t remember the dates.",
        "Q: They\u2019re the same age?",
        "A: They\u2019re the same age, yeah. The difference was in about a month, I think. Now she was older,\nher name was Blimcha.",
        "Q: B-]-1-m-i-c-a?",
        "A: B-l-1-m-c-i-a.. You got it? Blimcia. Lische, L-1-s-c-h-e.",
        "Q: Her father was Moshe?",
        "A: The father? No. The father was Shayadovid; the mother was my second sister, Malcia, M-a-l-c-\ni-a, Malcia. This was Blimcia. The other\u2019s names was Henoch, H-e-n-o-c-h, Kornfeld. You\nknow how to spell Kornfeld. His father\u2019s name was Moses, Moshe, we called him Moshe. His\nmother\u2019s name was my third sister Lieba. How you spell Lieba?",
        "Q: L-1-e-b-a? L-e-1. I guess for Lieba.",
        "A: L-1-e-b-a. {Just L-i, some people could read it Lyba. So it\u2019s better L-1-e that\u2019s Leeba.} So\nLieba and my second sister, born the same. Oh, you have the machine going? good.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Now, there were, what I can tell you. They are beautiful, they were beautiful children. Will you\nmark down to send me the map?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Copy of map. Now you can make two, three, maybe I will need it. They were beautiful\nchildren, happy children, playing around like children did. What the question? You want to ask\nif --?",
        "Q: Were they religious families?",
        "A: Very religious, very religious.",
        "Q: Hasidic?",
        "A: Hasidic, yeah. Like Lische who was a grandson from a very famous dynastic rabbi which is not\nimportant which one it is. Kornfeld was a graduate of the Yeshiva Hach Lublim. We\nspoke about it before, the Yeshiva Hach Lublim. We changed there but I think --. How\ndid you mark down?",
        "Q: H Yeshiva.",
        "A: Is wrong, should be Yeshiva Hach Lublim. You will remember,\nYeshiva Lublim. It means the Yeshiva of the Smart ones of Lublim {The wise\nmen}. The wise men of Lublim. Mark down that this is the correct for Kalman.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You have it there? If you mark down, it doesn\u2019t get lost?",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m very good about this.",
        "A: Good, so you correct it because now it\u2019s wrong there Hach Yeshiva Lublim, it\u2019s wrong.\nYeshiva Hach __Lublim. So he was a graduate of this yeshiva and he was religious.\nQ; What did they do for work?",
        "A: Okay. Lische Shadovid had a wholesale flour business. This was my father gave him over part\nof our store. When he came in, he was never a businessman so he took a part of the store, flour,\nand he used to sell to stores and to bakeries, the flour. Moshe had a wholesale of textiles, mostly\ncrude textile for underwear.",
        "Q: Was this also set up by your father?",
        "A: Yes. All through my father, yes. He was always -- my father bought them houses and he set\nthem up in business. Now what else would you like to know?",
        "Q: Did they have brothers and sisters?",
        "A: Yes. Blimcia had one sister, a year and a half younger and her name was Dobcher, D-o-b-c-i-a.",
        "Q: One and a half years younger?",
        "A: One and a half years younger, she was killed when she was two. I think two years younger.\nHenoch had a brother the same age, one and a half years younger, his name was Yussel. Moshe,\nyou know the business. They were with us together in ghetto. They lived together in one\napartment, consisting of two rooms. In the ghetto, Shadovid was a member of the Judenrat and\nthen later he was sent away.",
        "Q: After being arrested, he was sent away with Anderman?",
        "A: No, he was not arrested because he was away.",
        "Q: He was away? that\u2019s right.",
        "A: He was away; for this reason he was not arrested to be sent away. Then later when he came\nback, Fathering said to accept him. Moshe worked like everyday jobs what they sent out people\nto work. Nothing --. {Slave work}. The children played in the ghetto, they had games like\nchildren games. But one, an exceptional game , which I want you should put it in, which this 1s\nvery important. The Henoch, he was like the ringleader, was very smart for his age. When he\nlived before we went to the ghetto, we lived not far from the German police. We knew the\nGerman commandants of the police. Everybody knew them. One was good, one was bad, one\nwas worse. There was one man, his names was Harenbeer. Habier is H-a-b-i-e-r. He had a face\nlike very, very like a bulldog. His face was not really a human face and he was very vicious.\nHe killed a lot of people. The children knew about it and their game in ghetto was that this\nHenoch and Blimcia took together a few other children. Henoch stood in front of them and he\nspoke to them German because he heard about it. He used to ask them, he had in his hand a\npiece of wood pretending this is a rifle.",
        "Q: The German he spoke was just what he heard?",
        "A: What he heard, how could he speak real German. He said Bist Du Juden? That means are you\na Jew? To the children. Now this was a game and children answered Yavol, yes that we are\nJews. He said, . Because you are a Jew, you are dead. He took the rifle and started to\npretend, poof, poof, one after the other. After he pointed the rifle, he said poof, they fell down,\npretending they are dead. This was their game. It shows you that the time the children of three\nand three and a half years had those games. Every time. the same game, got together, he was\nthe policeman. Yeah, also when he said, first introduced himself when he got the job. He said,\nIch ben Habier, he didn\u2019t know the Habier. He said he heard it so he said I am Habier. Bist Du\nJuden and this was the game. I think because they had such beautiful children, I think a picture\nlike this with this story --. They were sent in July, 1942, they were sent with their families to\nBelzec death camps.",
        "Q: Right from --?",
        "A: No, from Kolbuszowa, everybody was sent to Czechowice. But in Czechowice they were there\nabout a week or two weeks. Because what they did, the gathered the people from all the small\ntowns in one place. They wanted to have in one place.",
        "Q: They liquidated your ghetto?",
        "A: They liquidated mine. Then once they had them in Czechowice, then they made big transports.\nThey made five transports. With the first transport, I have the date, they were sent to Belzec,\nthis was July 7. They were sent to Belzec, together, in this day they send out 12,000 Jews. Six\nwere killed in a nearby forest by Glowkoff G-l-o-w------ Well, I described this in the book.\nThey sent 6,000 elderly were killed in prepared ditches and the rest were sent to Belzec.",
        "Q: So, 6,000 were killed at Glowkoff and another 6,000 deported?",
        "A: Deported to Belzec, yes. But at this time --.",
        "Q: And they were deported, these children?",
        "A: Together with -- yeah. Because only elderly and crippled were killed in Glowkoff. In this time,\nthey were so busy with the transport in July that they had to wait sometimes three, four days in\nthe cattle cars till it was processed this arrival. Sometimes they waited two, three days.",
        "Q: Once at Belzec, they would sit?",
        "A: They would sit there on the railroad tracks. A lot of times this was in the summer, there were\nten carloads. There were French cars, cattle cars and they were made out of heavy tin. The heat\nwithout water; sometimes they opened the doors, half of them were dead. They had to wait\nsometimes two, three days till there was place to process them in, to take them down to undress\nand to gas them and then later to cremate them. Well, actually in the beginning, they were not\ncremated. There were ditches which they filled the ditches, this was near the Russian border, so\nthere were ditches made, anti-tank ditches. I have a complete description because when I went\nthere, I arrested one of the engineers.",
        "Q: Do you remember like what color hair and eyes they had?",
        "A: Oh, yes, sure. Blimcia, she looked like an angel. She had light blonde curly hair, all curls. Her\neyes were watery blue. You know sometimes somebody has blue and they are like watered\ndown, very, very bright, light blue. And always had a face, she was chubby, had a face always\nsmiled. Like she smiles in this picture. Now Henoch, his hair was darker. It was a dark blond\nhair and dark eyes. He had a more olive complexion and he was always more serious than\nBlimcia. She was always happier than -- so this was --. {How about some chocolate to stick in\nyour mouth? }",
        "Q: Just --.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I should describe Henoch\u2019s brother. {You\u2019re not writing about him. Just the\nname is enough. }",
        "Q: What do you remember about how your sisters were with these two children?",
        "A: What do you mean?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know, anything special about the way they treated them.",
        "A: They treated them like a mother treats a child. They were crazy about them. Not only for them.\nYou see, those children, they didn\u2019t have one mother. They had five, six mothers because my\ngrandmother was --. They were more in my house than they were in their house because we\nlived not far. Blimcia\u2019s girls, their house was next to our house so a whole day she was by us.\nShe ate by us, she went home to eat, to sleep. The other one also, they were more home. All\nmy sisters, the other sisters considered them our children. Special with me, I was the closest\nwith them.",
        "Q: Because you were the youngest?",
        "A: No, not only the youngest. I was the one, especially in the war, that I used to go around in\ndifferent towns for merchandise. Every time I came, there was not a time that I shouldn\u2019t bring\nsomething special for them. If it was candy, fruit about the first cherries, the first apples, the\nfirst pears -- every time if I could only buy a few, it was for them. It was also, that we always\nlaughed, that they knew that I am away in another town and I have to come back. Usually I\ncame back on a bicycle; they always used to wait. By Jews there is a saying when you mention\nSabbath, you always say Shabot Kordish. It means the Holy Sabbath. She heard the Shabot\nKordish, there was another expression that when children came to their grandparents or to their\naunt, every Saturday they came for Sabbath fruit. They gave them a treat. They used to come in\nand they used to say Shabbos Optz. Optz means in Jewish, fruit. They used to give to ess\nShabbos Optz to get something. When they waited for me to bring something, somebody\nmentioned oh you waiting for him because he\u2019s going to bring you Shabbos Optz. This girl she\nremembered something but she didn\u2019t remember exactly so when I came in, so she came to me\nand she said if I brought her Shabbos Kordish. It means the Holy Sabbath because she didn\u2019t\nremember the expression. Since then she knew every time I came so both of them wait and\nthey say give me the Shabbos Kordish, it means the Sabbath fruit, the Holy Sabbath. But\neverything for us, we had something. Naturally they were the first one because we were a very\nclose family and the children from my sisters, were our children, were the same thing. It didn\u2019t\nmake a difference who the mother was, her mother, his mother loved us as much as her, and her\nmother loved her --so it\u2019s always the same. If my mother in the ghetto, if she had something, if\nI brought her something special or something, they were the first one to have it. I remember we\nonce received a package from Turkey. In the package was a salami, a Swiss cheese and a\npackage of chocolate. All kinds of goodies that we didn\u2019t have it in ghetto. My mother,\nnaturally took it, 1t was something, she divided it in small pieces and they were the first ones to\nget it. Later when I came to America so I asked my brother, we got once in ghetto a package\nfrom Turkey, did you send it? He said I didn\u2019t send it but there was once an ad in the paper that\nsaid when you pay in fifteen dollars, a Turkey company will send to any place in German-\noccupied Europe, a package. So he went, he sent in $15.",
        "Q: This was your brother in Palestine?",
        "A: No, my brother in America. He sent in the $15 and we got it. It was the highlight in the ghetto\nto get a package for those things. A box of margarine, a box of crackers, a box of tea, coffee.\nThen I asked him how many packages did you send in? He said once. I asked why once, we\ngot it. He said why didn\u2019t you send it every day. Yes, he could afford it. Every day, send in\n$15. He said well I didn\u2019t get a receipt that you received it. I said, how could you get a receipt?\nWe were in the ghetto. But to take a chance, maybe 99% it will get lost but 1% it will come in,\nwhy not? So -- it was late. I remember when we got those goodies, my mother divided and\nevery day they came and they got the piece of cheese, they got a piece of salami. We were very,\nvery, very close and naturally the children were everything. For this reason, now I have\ngrandchildren their age. I look at the grandchildren and I see those children and how those\nchildren were undressed. The mother had to take them in to a gas chamber. They had to be\nkilled being two and three and a half years old. The mind cannot absorb it. We cannot talk\nabout it because there are no words to talk about it a million and a half children.\nThose were such beautiful, beautiful children. They didn\u2019t ask nothing from the world, they\nonly wanted to be alive. Naturally they didn\u2019t realize what\u2019s going on. This is how they went.\nI think that f you will write about them, you\u2019ll put them both together not separate because they\nwere -- they lived together -- they were the same age, they lived in the same house. Everything\nI remember when they came to our house in the ghetto, they always came together. They were\nbeautiful, they were nice dressed and --.",
        "Q: They lived apart from you in the ghetto, otherwise?",
        "A: They lived, before the war, this Blimcia lived next door to us because my father bought them a\nhouse next door to us. He lived away, I would say about 200 meters. During the day, he came\nover. During the ghetto we lived on this street, we lived far away, maybe 100 meters. Only\nthey had to go all the way to us. So they were by us practically every day, all day.",
        "Q: When they were deported to Belzec, they were with their mothers?",
        "A: Yeah, with the mothers.",
        "Q: And who else?",
        "A: They were with their mothers and fathers.",
        "Q: And fathers?",
        "A: And fathers, the whole family was deported together. You see, when you get a transport like\nthis with children like this and special to tell the story, their game. They didn\u2019t play ring-a-\nround-the-roses or something picking up flowers. In their mind this was something important.\nThis Habier went out and he killed Jews. They turned around in a game. I witnessed a few\ntimes, I was standing there, I couldn\u2019t grasp it. He tells and he imitates this German, he said\nwhen you are Jewish you are dead. Everybody knows that when he makes poof, they fall down.",
        "Q: Do you think they ever saw that?",
        "A: No, no, they just heard talking about. They heard talkings that Habier killed today a Jew. They\ndidn\u2019t see it no, but they heard talking about it.",
        "Q: This was the German police?",
        "A: This was the German police. He was like a meister, like a sergeant with the German police.\nEspecially he was in this time, a very vicious man. He always walked around with his face, he\nalways had a big German shepherd on the leash. Because mostly German police had German\nshepherds.",
        "Q: Did he work with Tarnoff?",
        "A: What? Tradon. Tradon, no. Because when Tradon --, well he worked, he was the police. But\nthen later he was transferred. When the ghetto was there, he wasn\u2019t there anymore. This was\nbefore the ghetto. They were transferred, you know. There was a other guy who worked with\nTradon, I describe it in the book, his name was Smicher. This is the one who came to beat up\nmy brother and then later he took him out from jail. Then later -- so he was also there. It was\nspecial certain German policemen that they were exceptional vicious. They were known for\ntheir viciousness. There were some who were nice. Nice, it doesn\u2019t mean that if they would\ncatch you without a band on the street, that they wouldn\u2019t arrest you or shoot you. But they\ndidn\u2019t go out of their way to do more harm than they were supposed to do. There were a few.\nThere was even one I also described in the book, that one who was also a sergeant, a meister.\nHe used to go for vacation home and he always used to bring stuff that my brother asked him to\nbring like saccharin and other things which was illegal but he brought it and my brother bought\nit by him. He made money and my brother made money. Now this is the one, he told us to go\nwith the transport the first day. Because he said, we don\u2019t control, the Gestapo controls it and\nyou never know when the Gestapo changes from one day to another. We went with the first day\nwith the transportation. So we had Blimcia, who else did we have to have there?",
        "Q: When was his birthday, approximately?",
        "A: My father was born 1882 in a village called Dubas, D-u-b-a-s.",
        "Q: In Poland?",
        "A: Poland, this was five kilometers from Kolbuszowa. His father whose name was Naftali, I am\nnamed after him, was the manager of a very big estate of the whole village because the village\nbelonged to our men. It so happened that the owner was Jewish too. Want his name?",
        "Q: No, no.",
        "A: Now my father when he was a teenager, my grandfather sent him to Kolbuszowa to study in the\nyeshiva. He remained there and married my mother when he was 18 years old.",
        "Q: Was it an arranged marriage, do you know?",
        "A: Yes. Every marriage was an arranged marriage. He remained in that town. His own brothers\nand sisters, seven brothers and sisters came to America before the turn of the century. We even\nmade now a gathering of the 100\" anniversary of the family coming over. He was the only one\nwho didn\u2019t go because he was so religious.",
        "Q: Where was he within the brothers and sisters? Was he one of the older --?",
        "A: He was the second from the youngest.",
        "Q: Were they well off?",
        "A: No, no. He was a manager in a village so he had enough to eat and everything. In the second\nbook, I\u2019m writing everything about this family, the whole life. Now he married my mother and\nhe started a business in Kolbuszowa. The First War ruined, he went away. Then he came back,\nthey started again and in 1919 was a pogrom.",
        "Q: He fought in the Austrian-Hungarian army?",
        "A: He went but the Jews didn\u2019t fight. They had a regiment that the Jews with beards that usually\nthey had guards, guarded trains. He wasn\u2019t long, he came out because he had a lot of children so\nafter a short while he came back. He was, I think, in the army only six months.",
        "Q: Was it called the Austrian-Hungarian army or --?",
        "A: Austrian army, Austrian-Hungarian army. Then later was the pogrom, then later --.",
        "Q: That was in 192 ?",
        "A: May 6, 1919. I cannot forget May 6 because I was born May 6, about a year later.",
        "Q: They managed to get out before the pogrom?",
        "A: So.",
        "Q: They managed to leave the town before the pogrom?",
        "A: No, no, he was in the pogrom.",
        "Q: He was?",
        "A: They were hiding. They went to a Polish acquaintance that she board by us so that when the\npogrom started, they ran away with the children. They were there three days hiding in the attic\nuntil the pogrom finished and then they came back. But later he started again the business and\nhe started to become successful. Little by little he enlarged and he became a wholesaler. Then\nin \u00b020, I was born so he had nine children. When I was born, my oldest brother left for\nAmerica.",
        "Q: It\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: He was devoted, he was a Hasidic. He was a follower of the Rabbi and he was\ninvolved in everything what went down, in Jewish and non-Jewish organizations. He always\nwas in the middle of everything. He was very active, for a while he was a member of the\nJewish Council and he was also deputy mayor of the town which a Jew could never be the\nmayor.",
        "Q: Why wasn\u2019t he part of the Judenrat?",
        "A: My father?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, he wasn\u2019t part of -- first thing he was a Jew with a long beard.",
        "Q: And Anderman didn\u2019t want him then?",
        "A: And Anderman didn\u2019t want him. They took my brother didn\u2019t have a beard. You see a Jew with\na long beard was like a red cloth towards a bull. So he didn\u2019t take those people. Now before\nthe war, older people like my father were the leaders but Anderman wouldn\u2019t accept him. He\ndidn\u2019t have in his Judenrat one man with a beard. He was successful in business, every time\nbetter and better. More details about the business, about conditions I\u2019m writing this out of the\nbook. When the war started, we lived in our house then later we went to the ghetto. In the\nghetto, in the 18\" of April, the Gestapo came in and they had a list of 20 Jews because there\nwere 2,000 and they said they going to kill one percent. But the end was they killed 22 Jews.\nOne of them, my father was on the list. They killed him while we were in our house and the\ndetails are in the book.",
        "Q: Yeah, I know this.",
        "A: Yeah but the significance of him being killed is that before they shot him five times, the last\ntime, his last words were\n(END OF SIDE B, TAPE 1) (ON THIS TAPE 2 WIFE IS PRIMARY ONE BEING\nINTERVIEWED. HUSBAND\u2019S WORDS ARE IN BRACES.)",
        "A: My father was born in Delatyne. D-e-l-a-t-y-n-e in P , eastern Poland. {This is the same\nsection where this other guy from __.} Almost, but this is eastern Poland. In November, in\n1895. He attended agricultural school and also yeshivoth so he was very knowledgeable in\nJudaic studies and secular studies. His hobby was a painter. As a matter of fact this saved him\nwhen he was in the Austrian army. When they drafted him, he used to caligraph to write, to\nmake all the posters. {Not a painter of rooms but --}.",
        "Q: Calligrapher or artist?",
        "A: Artist, this even saved him when he was drafted to the Austrian army that he was assigned to\nprepare posters or to paint posters and what else they had, proclamations, whatever. {I have\nbeautiful pictures from the three brothers what they were taken to the army. I think I showed\nyou.}. Then we went into the lumber business.",
        "Q: After he got back from the army?",
        "A: Did I tell you that he was Dovid Mendel? Or I didn\u2019t say it, just my father, how did I start?",
        "Q: I just have David Petranker.",
        "A: Yeah, he was actually named David Mendel Petranker.",
        "Q: M-e-n-d-e-l?",
        "A: Yes. But he was known as David Petranker. But when he signed he had to use it. In the lumber\nbusiness and when he married Freida Ginga Petranker, he settled in S and worked in\nlumber business.",
        "Q: Did he work for a private --?",
        "A: With my grandfather, now they have their private business until I think, \u2019\u00b037 or \u201936 when he\nbecame the vice-director of --. {In 1937, all the forests in this section were nationalized}. By\nthe government. {By the government. So when they were nationalized and they created a\nMinistry of the Forestry.!. My father was a Jew, so he couldn\u2019t become the director. { Because\nhe was a Jew, he couldn\u2019t be head of the Ministry of the Forestry so he became the assistant.\nThey picked out some figurehead, so he should be --}. This that they write in the book\nwho helped me in the war very much. He was the director, my father was the vice-director. {He\nwas his assistant of the Ministry of Forestry because he was a Jew but this was a very high\nposition. Besides this he had his own business too.}. He was an ardent Zionist, Hash __, likea\nmovement you know, that they believed in Hebrew and they studied Hebrew and wanted to\nmake sure that his daughters, you can see that he adored us. He was a very devoted father --\nthat we got the proper Jewish as well as secular education. When the Russians occupied our\ntown in 1939, I think it was the end of September, something, end of September, he was\ndemoted from his job. He had to work as a laborer, physical worker in scrap iron. Then thanks\nto an acquaintance, he got a job in a chemical laboratory, analyzing __; you know they used to\nuse it for heat. Peat, yes. The Russians so this is how he worked. When the Germans came in --\nI don\u2019t want what we went through, it was very hard because the is not very important\nwhat we went through. When the Germans came, he was assigned as slave laborer to work on\nthe railroad and in 1942, in October, they took -- gathered or took all the laborers who worked\noutside the ghetto, also in the railroad authority and they shipped them all to Belzec. On the\nway, on the way to Belzec, he jumped. You can even describe how he pried the boards of the\nfloor of the cattle car with his hands, no tool nothing and he jumped out of the running cattle\ncar. Only one girl, age 17 from Kolamia joined him. The rest I guess, they didn\u2019t want to\nseparate. They jumped and successfully reached a peasant house on the outskirts of Halech.\nAgain I was sitting there, this terrible, I was one hour walking distance and my father knew I\nam alive and then he went for me in ghetto. Reached a Ukrainian peasant\u2019s house who gladly\nemployed them as field hands because her husband was in the army in Russia and she needed.\nBut my father didn\u2019t see me at the transport, didn\u2019t see his daughter Amaria, who\u2019s still -- you\nmust put those people in, his daughter Amaria who was the last survivor of the whole family in\nthe transport.",
        "Q: Which transport?",
        "A: To Belzec.",
        "Q: The one he was on?",
        "A: Yeah, because they took fresh from the ghetto. Then they brought from the working places\nwherever there are slave workers, they gathered together and they loaded on the cattle car. He\ndidn\u2019t see me. I don\u2019t want to go there because we had an agreement in case we are separated,\nit\u2019s all in the book.",
        "Q: Right, I remember.",
        "Q: But what I -- what you write. Although he found safe haven, he decided to go to the train and to\ngo back to the ghetto to look for his daughter which meant death sentence if he would be\ncaught. On the train, an Ukrainian architect who bought lumber from him and befriended him -\n- I\u2019m sorry this was an Ukrainian. I can\u2019t help if people write what they want. Who befriended\nhim, pointed him out to the Gestapo because in each train was a German police and Gestapo,\npointed out.",
        "Q: He knew this man before, dealt with him in business?",
        "A: He used to come, dealt business, used to come for tea to our house. We were very friendly. I\nknow the name too, I don\u2019t want to use because it was told to me later. Pointed out to me later.\n{Why don\u2019t you use the name?! Isuzan Wizy.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know how to spell that.",
        "A: L-y-s-y-].",
        "Q: L-y-s-y-]? Okay.",
        "A: Pointed him out and he was taken back to Steinswadoff to the Rudolph\u2019s Mill, this is flour mill,\nRudolph\u2019s which was a gathering place for the Jews who were supposed to be sent to Belzec.\nYou know the gathering place?",
        "Q: Yes. And so they waited in a warehouse there?",
        "A: And then they were shot, yes. Without food, without nothing.",
        "Q: He was shot at the mill?",
        "A: Yes, he was shot at the mill. So you see this is supposed to be told because first of all, the\ndevotion of the parent, to show even if you\u2019re safe, the irony of fate 1s that I was just one hour\nwalking distance from where he was.",
        "Q: Mundich had found you?",
        "A: Mundich told me. Everybody told me that something they caught a Jew, like here somebody\nwould catch a killer or G-d knows what. You caught a Jew and what happen. My father was\njust one hour walking distance. I don\u2019t know that he is there and he didn\u2019t know where I am.\nHe thought I am in the ghetto and I thought that he was sent to Belzec, I didn\u2019t know. He told\nme that he would get in touch with me, within three weeks if he managed to get off the train. I\ndidn\u2019t hear from him so I assumed that he is dead. Therefore I let myself be persuaded by the\ncar ride to go to his house. So when this happened he heard about it, Mundich, but he didn\u2019t\nwant to tell me until after months later, what happened to my father. By the way, the girl who\njumped with him, survived. Mundich told me. She was by the peasant\u2019s house and then she let\nherself be caught as non-Jew to a slave labor and she survived in Austria because she got in\ntouch with this Mundich. Told Mundich the whole story. Also she needed somebody like I\nneeded somebody, when you are masquerading as a gentile After all you have to have family, to\nget some mail. So Mundich used to write to her. He just doesn\u2019t know when the war ended,\nwhat happened to her. But he told me he used to get letters from her from Vienna. This is the\nstory. I think it is very important, devotion, courage, no nothing to be packed like sardines; to be\nable to pry the boards; to jump out of a running -- any train to jump. The point is that you only\nhave slightly bruised knees. The girl was not harmed at all.",
        "Q: Did he break through the bottom of the train, do you know?",
        "A: {They didn\u2019t jump, they didn\u2019t jump. What they did, the train has a floor. The floor are\ngrooved boards so he pulled out two boards. While the train was running, what they did, they\nlet themselves down, through and between the wheels and the train went and they were not\ntouched.! I mean he had only the height, the bruised knees I was told and the girl not at all. I\nthink a story like this again, it\u2019s unusual, hair-raising, courage and devotion should be told. It\u2019s\nnot only because he\u2019s my father but this should be told the same thing about my sister.",
        "Q: What was his father\u2019s business? He was in the lumber business?",
        "A: No, no. Before the First World War, my father was from a very wealthy family. He used to\nhave forests and they used to have mills. During the First World War --.",
        "Q: Lumber mills?",
        "A: Yes. During the First World War, it burnt down. They remained only with an inn and a grocery\nstore. This what remained and they were not anymore so rich. The point is also that his mother\nused to say always you see, material things you have, you can lose. She believe very much in\ngiving education to her children and all her children got education. This is why my father too,\nhe say, I prepare dowry for you, he had hard realty but I don\u2019t know if he would if he would\nalso foresee if I would be able to take advantage. So let me give my daughters the best\neducation that I can because with this they will be able always to make a living. This why, do\ndon\u2019t forget, this 1s from kindergarten, he paid --.",
        "Q: How many Jews, did you go to private school? to primary? to kindergarten?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. Then secondary school gymnasium was very expensive and he had three daughters\nonly one year apart. He sent us all to all this and don\u2019t forget that the earning possibilities in\nPoland were not the same like in the United States. To be able to afford it, means that he had to\ndeny himself certain things to be able to do it. After all, he was not a millionaire, he was not the\nrichest man, he was comfortable but not the richest, but you always have priorities. With him,\npriorities was education.",
        "Q: Do you remember, did he ever paint in the house?",
        "A: Oh, yes, this is good you told me. He make murals, he liked also to make enlarged portraits. I\nremember Hertzel and others and also he always liked to study. He learned French by himself.\nHe was an avid reader; he liked the history of in German. Actually he could quote you\nfrom the big German poets, Heine, the same way like from Talmud. Because of it, you know the\nJews did not like to go to courts when they had a dispute. They rather settle among themselves.\nMy late father was chosen to be the judge because of his knowledge. Actually, I wrote it in the\nbook but they took it out. I don\u2019t know why. They didn\u2019t allow me too much space in this book\nbut he read. But this is very important. So he was chosen to be arbitrator because of his\nknowledge. Between the merchants, business people and the people in the lumber business.",
        "Q: Just among Jewish merchants or --?",
        "A: Yes, Jewish merchants. They didn\u2019t like to go to courts, also the expenses and also they didn\u2019t\nlike to run always to the rabbi and the rabbi had like a judge. They rather settle in their own\nline of business, they thought they would be better understood than the other party. The two\nparties used to nominate, choose like a judge, it\u2019s called b \u2014_. My late father was chosen many\ntimes.",
        "Q: He wanted to emigrate to Palestine himself?",
        "A: He saw that there\u2019s no future for us in Poland.",
        "Q: This was after everything was nationalized? Is that when he became --?",
        "A: No, even before because of the anti-Semitism. He saw that {Nationalize was nothing against\nhim because he wasn\u2019t --}. But he saw that there\u2019s no future. Therefore he planned to emigrate\nto Palestine at that time.. He felt that he wants to give us education and save enough money.\nBecause in order to go to Palestine, you needed at that time, I think, 10,000 zlotys, not per\nfamily, per person. {5,000}. Families, 10,000 and this was a lot.",
        "Q: For a family?",
        "A: At that time it was a lot of money. So he wants to give us education, therefore he taught us.\nMade sure that we knew Hebrew and as our foreign language in gymnasium, we had a choice\nbetween French, German and English. We have chosen English so we have to prepare it, to\nprepare us for studies in Palestine and to emigration to Palestine. What is if you want to know ,\nit\u2019s very unusual also about him. He didn\u2019t have any sons so you know we took from the family\n--. You saw the family picture, maybe you remember.",
        "Q: Yes, he had that adopted son?",
        "A: A boy from that family, yes. He raised us like boys. The bad part is which later turned out to be\nthe good one, is that every Friday evening, he made us study with him after dinner. We had to\nstudy with him wintertime so called bocherash this is tracked from our sages and the\n, that means the sa . You know in the Bible each week is different. Imagine three\ngirls to keep us and to study and G-d forbid if we didn\u2019t know it. In summertime when my\nfriends used to go to the park for a walk or to the movies, we had to study with . This is\nalso the things of the sages and the wise men. If one of us didn\u2019t know, he deprived us of\nallowance to go to movie. You know there was a carrot and stick; a lot of laugh, a lot of\ndevotion, attention, strict like boys. He raised us like a Prussian officer. You know girls like it\nmore easy. Thank G-d my mother was a very sweet, easy- going woman. With my mother we\nwere like friends, she was also very young mother. With him, also he laughed and he bossed\naround four women in his house.",
        "Q: When did you adopt this boy?",
        "A: My parents took him in, I think, in 1935.",
        "Q: Who was he?",
        "A: He was my mother\u2019s kid, first cousin. His father died.",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s first cousin\u2019s child?",
        "A: Yes. He died. At that time he was, I think, five years old when they took him. My father\nhim over. His name was Manasha. The same thing, my father sent him to the\nHebrew school, extra expense. extra clothing and everything. He still wanted very much a boy.\nActually this is why he had three daughters because he tried twice. Then he said the third time\nmust be boy and it wasn\u2019t. Now between you and me, it was in his family. All the\nsons, all the brothers had daughters, all the sisters had sons. It\u2019s unusual but this is how it was.\nMy father was the second eldest or the third eldest child in his family, the second or the third.",
        "Q: The second eldest of three?",
        "A: No, wait a moment. How many there were. Five sons and three daughters. So he was the --.",
        "Q: So eight children altogether?",
        "A: Yes, I think so. At least alive, because they had some children when they died in infancy. But to\nmy knowledge, eight and he was the second oldest.",
        "Q: Were they a religious family, do you know?",
        "A: My grandparents were religious, not as religious as Norman\u2019s family. As a matter of fact,\nsurprisingly my paternal grandmother was very well educated in Judaic studies. She had done\nwith her children the same thing what my father with us. They lived like in a summer resort. I\nremember when we used to come there and his brother from Germany used to come, she used to\nask them questions. If somebody didn\u2019t know, she didn\u2019t hesitate to punish them by slapping\ntheir face. I remember this as a child when we went there. But the sisters went to school, the\nsisters used to all play mandolin, progressive. So the brothers nod their heads, progressive.\nThey were progressive, Jewish, traditional. I think about my father, what to think but the most\nimportant is really the episode --.",
        "Q: How he escaped to come back to find you?",
        "A: Devotion and also the courage. Again he didn\u2019t go like sheep to slaughter, it\u2019s very important.\n{To pull out boards --} Unfortunately he gambled, he should really not gone for me. But he\ncouldn\u2019t live with the thought.",
        "Q: Without knowing?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t -- how will I manage to shelter a child. He was saved by this woman, this peasant.\nShe didn\u2019t ask any questions. By the way, he didn\u2019t look Jewish. He was blond, green eyes.",
        "Q: That benefited you later in a way?",
        "A: But my father was young.",
        "Q: In terms of having a look that didn\u2019t look Jewish, that helped you too?",
        "A: No, my father looked less like Jewish. I had Semitic eyes don\u2019t forget. With me, really was\nluck that the Germans thought I\u2019m Polish and the Poles thought I\u2019m German but no one took\nme for their own, you know. My boss questioned my eyes, Semitic eyes. In college, I was\nalways on the offensive instead of being on the defensive. You know the book when the\npoliceman followed me and I wanted to know if he\u2019s just a womanizer or really --. He followed\nme to the ladies\u2019 room. Instead to shiver and to feel defeated, I jump on him, what right do you\nhave to follow me? This is -- after all I knew who he is. This put him off! He was a police and\nlike nothing he would have given me away. In all instances like my boss, I start to say no and\nto deny and to be caught and to blush, I said most probably my grandmother was Jewish. He\nthought it\u2019s the best joke. You know this is how I was able. We saw now a movie and I told\nNorman, it was very similar I acted. Which was it, Norman, the last one that we saw? Oh, you\ndidn\u2019t the movie \u2018Shining Through\u2019?",
        "Q: No, no.",
        "A: When she acts like a spy.",
        "Q: Right, I saw the coming attractions.",
        "A: The same. Don\u2019t forget I didn\u2019t have any experience and I was 17, 18 but somehow my logic in\nthis dictated me to act like itis. My father had a good chance. He had a very good command of\nPolish and because we didn\u2019t speak Yiddish, he didn\u2019t have the singsong like I don\u2019t have. I\ndon\u2019t have in my Polish and I don\u2019t have in my English. This helped a lot because if you have\nthe singsong, immediately they recognize it. Many looked not Jewish but they couldn\u2019t do it.\nSo please put",

        "A: Well, he was not so big. In Kolbuszowa he was considered big, but he was known -- everybody\nis known for something and he was known for his strength. He was the strongest man, if\nsomebody wanted to give an example he strong, so they said he\u2019s as strong as Leibush. So he\nwas very well known, not that he used his strength for some fight or something, but he was\nknown as the strongest man in our town.",
        "A: Yes, I was very proud of it, because nobody would start up with me but he never got involved,\nbut he was, I was always be proud. And also when Jews never stood up against anything what\nwas done to them, Leibush was one, he wouldn\u2019t take abuse. And there was one I write in the\nother book, once there was a draft commission, you know a draft commission came to our town\nto take the boys who had to go to draft, so they came a few high Polish officers and a military\ndoctor, and they conducted the draft. So once when Jews had to go to to the bigger\ntown, they went by wagon, they went by autobus. The autobus went once a day, eight in the\nmorning to so when the Jewish people, some Jewish people wanted to go on the\nautobus, so those officers were standing by the door, they didn\u2019t let in Jews and Leibush --. I\ncan, stop it......where were we?",
        "A: Okay, he had the store. I started to tell you about-----so those two officers, the three officers\nwere standing in the doorway they didn\u2019t let in nobody, no Jews because they wanted to go to\nthe big town. And there came also was standing a young woman and she had a sheitl a wig,\nbecause they were very religious, so when she wanted to go in they grabbed her by the hair and\nthey pulled down the wig, she was very embarrassed because they were shamed. When my\nbrother saw that they don\u2019t let her in, they pulled off the wig, and he was this time, I would say\nabout twenty years old, or twenty-one years old. But he went and he wanted to go and he\npushed the officer, and it was a high officer, he pushed him so fast, he was standing there, that\nhe fell on the other one and the other one, they all, three or four, they all fell down. And\nnaturally he was afraid, so he run away, then the police came and they arrested my brother and\nthere was a big case and they took about four, five years. This was taken to J toa\nsuperior court and they made a big issue because who would touch a Polish officer? The main\nthing, after he knocked them down all the Jews went in that car, but they had my brother\narrested. But the main thing was that they asked the woman to be a witness who was pulled\ndown the wig, and she didn\u2019t want to be a witness, she was afraid. But then later we had to hire\nbig lawyers and it cost money and this was, but he was known about his strength. When he was\nyounger, I was a very poor eater so my mother used to say \u201cI never had trouble with Leibush,\nbecause Leibush, when put down for breakfast a bread, he finished the whole bread. He\nfinished the whole loaf.\u201d So they ask Leibush, they ask him, \u201cWhen do you know that you have\nenough?\u201d He was not fat, when do you know it\u2019s enough?\u201d So he said, he never said when he\u2019s\nfull or something, {when the muscles} not the muscles, how you call this?",
        "A: The jaw. When the jaw starts to hurt you, then he knows he has enough. And there were other\ncases that, the peasant people they always wanted to show off their strength and there was one,\nhe was known as strong. So he came over once and said \u201cLet\u2019s wrestle.\u201d My brother said I\ndon\u2019t want to wrestle, I\u2019m not a wrestler. He said \u201cLet\u2019s wrestle.\u2019 He wanted to show he is\nstronger, so my brother didn\u2019t want to bother, and later he bothered him and he said \u201cOkay, let\u2019s\nwrestle.\u201d So they took off their jacket, the other guy took off his jacket. It took a second, the\nother one was stretched out. So then he said that he approved he\u2019s the strongest. And then he\nwas with me in the woods after a year and we escaped from the camp. But in the end he died of\na heart attack, actually he had cancer in his mouth and then they gave him so much cortisone\nthat, awful big dose, that he went for a visit to Israel and while he was on the visit to Israel he\ndied and the dead was a heart attack, but this was caused by the cortisone. So this is about\nLeibush. Now, about Shulim, now you have written down here, I don\u2019t know, you have the\nrecord.....",

He is three years old, his parents\ndressed him in a player\u2019s show, cut his hair for the first time and brought him to the teacher at\nthe religious school, at the cheder. His father can hardly wait for the day when Shulim will\nbegin his public school education. I think this is very.....1t\u2019s not the right language.",
        "A: So they can get better language, \u201939 the Germans have taken over our town, Shulim nine years\nold, knows that he no longer goes to school because all the Jewish schools have been shut\ndown. He didn\u2019t have no Jewish schools, this was public schools and Jews couldn\u2019t attend\npublic schools anymore, not that the Jewish schools were shut down. And he cannot walk on\nthe sidewalks, this was not right in the beginning, Jews could walk on the sidewalks, but this\nwas not the main thing because he is a Jew. But he doesn\u2019t understand what lies behind these\nrules because I think the whole thing is, he couldn\u2019t go to school because Jewish schools were\nshut down; all schools were shut down. In 1944 Shulim turned twelve in 1942 the Germans\nwere, we can say we were at this time in the ghetto in Kolbuszowa.",
        "A: In 42, because the ghetto was established in July \u201941. The Germans law was that all Jews\ntwelve years and up had to wear the yellow armband. We didn\u2019t have a yellow armband. The\nwhite with the blue Star of David. Had to wear the white and blue armband, there was nothing,\nand register for work. This 1s okay, we had to register from 12 to 60. Getting the band was\nsuch a proud moment for Shulim, to him it meant he was now a man, that he was growing up to\nbe like his father. He never realized that it was part of the Nazi, I don\u2019t use the word Nazi, as the\nGermans plan to kill the Jews. I don\u2019t who the Nazis, Shulim and German, maybe we can say\nthe picture, because we\u2019ll take out , the picture that he asked me, or he can say I asked\nmy uncle to make a picture and I have a picture the day he put on the armband.",
        "A: The picture, and when he shows off the band, because he was so proud of it so maybe this can\nbe incorporated.",
        "A: Yes, he bothered me.",
        "A: Yeah. Then I made the picture and I took the other children also and he showed the band.\nQ\nHe put it on the other arm?",
        "A: Well, no he had it on the right arm. He had it on the right arm, but he pulls out the arm to show\nthe picture; he was so proud of it. Shulim was transported with his mother, brother and sister to\nBelges death camp where he was killed in July 1942. Now, should we.....",
        "A: No, July, I don\u2019t know the date.",
        "A: July, 1942 because I don\u2019t know because they were kept in the trains, but in July he was killed.\nNow I don\u2019t know if we should write anymore about his father, that his father survived, or just\nto let it go.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well I remembert....",
        "A: He was a very good- looking boy, he was really very -- and he was a very good student, when\nhe started to go to school. Because after all he went already three years in public school was\nfrom six to nine, and he was a very, very good student.",
        "A: Yes, he went to public school and after public school he went to cheder, to a Jewish school, like\neverybody else. From eight to twelve or one, we went to public school. Then in the afternoon,\nfrom two on, I think we went to cheder. And when the war broke out there was nothing left\nanymore, what else, there is nothing.",
        "A: Well, when he started, when he was twelve years old, he was sent out like everybody else, work\ndetails. It was arranged by the Judenrat, by the Jewish Council for the Germans to come and\ngrab people from the streets, their houses, so it was arranged how many was in the work force\nfrom the ghetto, so everybody got a card that this and this day he has to report to work. They\nworked, they sent them out, since he became 12, he worked, came out two or three times a week\nto go to work, in the winter mostly by snow and the summer on the roads and other things. And\nwe lived together because in the ghetto we moved in the apartment where Leibush lived; so\nhappens that this apartment was in the place where the part of the ghetto was at. And we got the\nroom and we worked together, we lived together. He wasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t so bad because my\nbrother he was a member of the Judenrat, the first Judenrat and he was selected by the\nabout which we will talk later and then later he was arrested but, in the book it\u2019s\nwritten how he was released because only three Jews were released from jail, the rest were\nkilled, the whole Judenrat. Leibush\u2019s father is still in the ghetto, he had his store because this\nwas the place that he was not thrown out. So, how much he could buy and market things and\nthis way he was not bad off in the ghetto. They had enough, everything. Until it was the\ntransport to J and J to Belges and then they were killed.",
        "A: Well, they had an apartment, the apartment was of two large rooms and a large kitchen, so when\nwe moved into the ghetto we took over the large kitchen, I say we, I mean my father, my\nmother, and I and two sisters. So we had the kitchen, and he with his three children had the\nbedroom, so we lived together what we used the same kitchen and they had this one room. But\nhe also had, in the basement, he had the store still, there was not too much merchandise, but\nhow much he could buy from black marketeeers, so he had, and he was busy in the store.",
        "A: He lived above the basement, yeah, and we lived in the same.....and he was lucky in this time\nthat his apartment, his store was in the ghetto. Like for us, they threw us out from our house and\nto go into the ghetto, but he was there, so we came to live with him. Now, if we wouldn\u2019t live\nfrom him there would be other people, but this way when we took it over, so nobody else came\nin the house. But the main thing is from Shulim, also here you have written down 1945, Shulim\nwas born the same year as Richard, my older brother\u2019s son, but Richard was born in America.\nMy brother had moved there after a pogrom in our town in 1919. I always think of these two,\nRichard now a doctor in America, Shulim killed in Poland at 13, not 13 but 12. See the people\nare so stupid, they know by he was born in 1930 and he was killed in 1942, but here they mark\ndown 13. So he was born when he was 12 years old. So this, I think, this is a very nice\nsentence, that to compare those two, Richard now a doctor in America and Shulim killed in\nPoland at the age of twelve. So, what you can write too much, but I think what you have is\nenough material.",
        "A: Well, his mother was a housewife and she took care of -- nothing distinguished. She took care\non the house and Leibush took care on the store, but nothing special. But maybe to mark down\nthat Leibush survived the war. That Leibush survived the war with me in the woods and died in\nAmerica in 1960. Okay, now we have this, we have this and they will be the same kind of\npassports, the new ones?",
        "A: Well that is a very nice format, it looks very good. The only thing it should be correct.",
        "A: No who do we go now? To",
        "A: Passports come out, send the corrected passports this way. I want to keep it, I have always\ncollections I would like. Now Naftali you went over mine, so we don\u2019t have to add anything on\nmine.",
        "A: Now, what you want Dr. Anderman. His name was Leon Anderman.",
        "A: A-N-D-E-R-M-A-N, yeah. Leon Anderman, he came to Kolbuszowa from uh, it came out the\nbook, All Physicians in Poland and he was a mention to that I dated back to my nephew but that\nwas written the year when he was born, the date. Anyway, he came to Kolbuszowa in the early\n20\u2019s and he -- well not in the 20\u2019s mark down in the 20\u2019s, I don\u2019t know if the early twenties. So\ncross off the early twenties. He became the physician of Kolbuszowa. There were in this time,\nthere were two doctors in Kolbuszowa; it was the county doctor, the official doctor which we\ncalled the physic, and then there it was this private doctor. Mostly Jews used him, he was\nvery.....",
        "A: Dr. Anderman, yeah. He was a very assimilated Jew, he didn\u2019t have anything to do with the\nJewish causes, he never stepped in the synagogue, and so was his wife. They had one son, he\nwas about two years younger than I was; his name was Jurek, J-U-R-E-K. He was -- he never\nattended a cheder, or to a Jewish school. His wife had never any contact with Jewish women.\nHe was very respected by the Polish community as he was an officer in the Polish army, in the\nreserve army, he was also an officer yet in the Austrian army.",
        "A: He was originally from a town near Tarnople, this is near Stanislovov this is near the Russian\nborder, there was a few brothers he was originally from there. He started medicine in Vienna,\nbecause this belonged to ---. Too bad I don\u2019t have the book because in the book it\u2019s written\nexactly the date when he was born, when he graduated.",
        "A: Only doctors, a book about physicians in Poland.",
        "A: Who died, who were killed. It\u2019s a thick book, if you want to know I can find out exactly, you\nwant to know about this, is it important?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s book, he has it, so I\u2019ll give it to you. Give Kevin the information, [ll tell him to make a\ncopy.....information of Dr. Anderman. It\u2019s also, certain things is not correct also. Somebody\nwho wrote it didn\u2019t know. Well, anyway he, said he never bothered with Jewish causes when\nthe first time when they threw out the Jews from Germany in this was the first time\nthat he came. They organized a committee in every little town to help the German Jews who\nwere thrown out and we organized in Kolbuszowa also and this is the first time he took part for\nit. And I remember the first time that he attended shul when he spoke about giving money to\nthis organization to help. The second time I remember he came to shul to speak that when\nbefore the war started and the Polish government saw that there have to be a war, so they\nwanted the citizens should donate money to buy airplanes because the Polish air force didn\u2019t\nhave too many airplanes; they had a few. So, they collected money so I remember he, this is the\nsecond time he came to shul, he spoke to the Jews, naturally he spoke Polish. Spoke to the Jews\nwilling to give money, and I remember his words, he said, \u201cToday we beg you to give the\nmoney, but in a few months, I am afraid they will take it without.\u201d He meant the Germans, they\nwould take it without begging you, without asking you. He asked the people for money, and\nthen this was the first two times, when the war started he was drafted as a reservist, as a doctor\nto the army. He was taken to a prisoners\u2019 camp in an officers\u2019 prisoner of war camp. And then\nlater he was released, short after he was released and see, in this book was written exactly\nwhere he was interned.",
        "A: After the German invasion, he was in the army, they drafted him, they drafted all the doctors\nand he was a reserve officer, being a doctor so they drafted him. And then he was taken as a\nprisoner of war, and he came back to Kolbuszowa he started to run his office. When the\nGermans ordered the Jews should make a Judenrat, that means a Jewish council, and there was\none Jew who right away volunteered. As the Germans came in he started to be an important\nman by the Germans, he started to come to the commandant and he started to tell them all kinds\nof stories. He was not a very person, this..... he started to tell them which Jews have hidden\nmerchandise, as a matter of fact my father suffered very much from this Jew. Like he came to\nmy -- the Germans liked coffee, coffee beans. He came to my -- and we had coffee\nbeans hidden so he came every day for coffee beans. Today he wanted two kilo, the next day\nthree kilo and then four kilo....and then my father told him how much can I give you, I mean\nwe don\u2019t have new shipments. He said to him a well, if you take so much water out it will be\ndry. So he said well if you don\u2019t want to give more I will take it, so he went to the Germans and\nhe squealed that my father has hidden merchandise. They came over and they took away\neverything we had. I remember it was three days that they went and loaded everything we had\nbecause he squealed.",
        "A: Everything, they took everything, they took even personal things, everything because they said\nthat he ---. They took away everything, we had a lot of merchandise because this merchandise\ncould be sold and we could have money, but they took away everything. My father ran away,\nand then because he was afraid that they will arrest him, I run away and this time I run away to\nRussia, which later I came back. And he, and this man wanted to become the president because\nthe Germans said you have to organize a Jewish council, but the Jews knew if he would become\ncouncil, it would be very bad for the Jews because he was, like I said. Before the war\neverybody knew somebody wanted to have a witness in court, if there was a court case and they\nneeded a witness, he would always be a witness for money, naturally. So even there was here in\nAmerica there are sayings if I speak to some people from Kolbuszowa and I ask them\nsomething and they don\u2019t want to tell me a lie, so they said, what do you think, I am this and\nthis? I don\u2019t want to mention his name because he has his family. So they say, what do you\nthink I am him? He was known that he is \u2014 for money he can be a witness. So then we Jews\nknew that if he would become the president it would be bad for Jews because he would\ncollaborate with the Germans. So the Jews started to speak to prominent Polish Catholics,\nespecially to the mayor, who we told him that we are very concerned that he would become the\npresident, not only this, because if he will be president he will pick out members, his friends,\nhis like, and then it will be bad. We the Jews, I say we, I say the Jews themselves, say the only\none who could actually be stronger than him is Dr. Anderman, he didn\u2019t look Jewish, I mean he\ndidn\u2019t have a beard, most of the Jews had beards and he spoke beautiful German because he\nstarted in Vienna and he was a proud man and he would never -- he would be able to protect the\nJews. A group of Jewish people went to him and they said to him he should\nbecome so he said, I was never involved with Jewish things, I am a doctor. I don\u2019t\nwant to be a politician, and I don\u2019t want to have a job like this. The Jews begged him, they told\nhim, look if you don\u2019t do it, you are the only one, can protect us from this man and he knew that\nthis man is no good for the Jews. Well, anyway, after a few times. I remember my father went\nto him and others, he said all right, I will do it against my judgment, I will do it, only on one\ncondition. If I will -- he had to pick out ten or twelve members of the council, -- only if I can\npick out the people I want. So, he made the list and he picked out mostly younger people,\nmostly people without beards, and that shouldn\u2019t be, again, the Germans shouldn\u2019t dislike them\nand also, people who were in the Jewish community leaders before the war. They were people,\nrespected citizens, and people who were quite well off and he picked out this Jewish council\nwhich included my brother Leibush, and my brother-in-law Sh , well younger people. He\norganized the Jewish council which was a blessing for Kolbuszowa because before the Germans\nused to grab people from the streets from their houses for work. He organized and made lists,\nand everything that had to be done was done through the organization. If you want more\ndetails, in the book I have more details about Anderman.",
        "A: No, no. He became head of the Judenrat in, before the ghetto, he became head of the Judenrat\nin the middle of \u201940. In the middle of \u201940, even earlier, I would say in spring of \u201940, spring\n1940, yeah. And then he ran the Judenrat and it was run very -- he was very just, and if they\nhad to take money because they needed for certain things, he always took it from people that\nhad money. If you want a few details you read the book about this chapter, you\u2019Il see he was a\nvery fair man, and I liked him very much. Later he opened an ambulatorium, a free clinic\nbecause he was a doctor and he knew a lot of people don\u2019t have money, so my sister and the\nbrother-in-law who was also a member of the Judenrat, had the empty store because he was in\nthe flower business, and in the war they didn\u2019t have flower, so he opened in his store the\nambulatori1um. He was there two or three times a week in the afternoon, and everybody who\nwas sick, especially the poorer people came there and he treated them without fee. He needed\nhelp so he asked me with other friend of mine, and he became -- we worked and he started to\nteach me how to dress wounds and how to clean boils and all these things and I was very good\nas I always wanted to be a doctor, I was very good at it. I went there and for this, because I was\nwith him, this work released me from going to work on the roads or something and I worked\nwith him for over a year in this ambulatorium.",
        "A: This ambulatorium opened in the middle of \u201940, yeah, I would say in the summer of 1940. And\nI worked with him with my friend, we........Then later more and more, I was more skilled, so a\nlot of things I could do, special with wounds and dressings and all those things.",
        "A: No, no only Jews. No Poles, they had their doctors there, he wasn\u2019t allowed to treat Poles; the\nGermans forbid a Jewish doctor to treat Poles. Then also he gave me a job, before the war I\nwas the buyer for my father\u2019s store and I used to go to different towns. They needed somebody\nto bring in the flour and other food what Germans gave on carts to the Jews, and this had to be,\nwe had to bring it from Jeshup, from other towns. Also we had to buy a lot of stuff from the\nblack market, like potatoes, they didn\u2019t give us enough, other things that we needed we opened\na public kitchen, a soup kitchen in -- he organized a soup kitchen. The kitchen needed certain\nthings that the Germans didn\u2019t give us, so I -- they picked me up and I went out twice a week to\ndifferent towns. I got a pass and I could go out and I could travel, and I brought in all those\nthings that the Jewish community got officially from the Germans. By going out and having this\npass, I also could buy a lot of black market for the Jewish -- for the soup kitchen we needed,\nand also I bought on the black market for myself, for my family. I brought in stuff and they\nsold it so they could make something out of it, my father. So this was how we worked with\nAnderman and I became very, very friendly with Anderman and I admired him because he was\nvery fair. There was something, a question about having privileges, the people who were in the\nJewish council, they wanted to take advantage, he always was against it. Again in his book, you\nhave the stories about it. Then they organized the ghetto, they organized the ghetto so he was\nresponsible for the Jewish should have where to live. He built a house a year before the war,\nand this was the most exclusive, the most beautiful house in Kolbuszowa very ---. It was a\nmodern house, this was the only house what had electricity and was the only house who had\nindoor plumbing. You see, he had a, not compressor, what you call it, to make electricity.",
        "A: He had a generator and the generator produced enough electricity to take care on the toilets,\nwith the water. It was a beautiful house, it had nice furniture, so this the head of\nthe county, the German who was very vicious, his name was Twardon. And Twardon wanted to\ntake over his house for himself because it was 1n a nice section. So he urged Anderman to take\nover an apartment in the ghetto, in the place where the ghetto is. He said to him, you take,\nbecause you are the head of the Judenrat, pick out the best apartment for yourself. Anderman\nsaid I will not pick out an apartment until the last Jew has a roof over his head. And if the Jews\nwill be settled, then I will take it. See, he wanted to move in his apartment, then later said to\nhim, I want to move in the apartment but he wanted a Jews should give him 10,000 zloty to\nrenovate the apartment. He said renovate it, it\u2019s just a new house, it\u2019s just a year old. And\nbesides, why do you have to renovate, you wouldn\u2019t live long in this house, the war will end\nand I will go back to the house. See, he didn\u2019t like these answers.",
        "A: Yes, yes, well he didn\u2019t like these answers, so on a certain day this was about, I would say about\ntwo weeks after the ghetto was established, Twardon came and he arrested the whole Judenrat,\neverybody in the Judenrat. Besides the Judenrat he also arrested about ten more people, and\nnaturally for the town it was a very big shock they arrested, but Anderman was free. Everybody\nsaid Anderman he\u2019s the father of us and he will try to go out and try to see that they should be\nreleased. He went and spoke to this Twardon so two days later, or a day later he was arrested.\nOnce he was arrested we felt that the situation was very grave because he was the only one who\ncould --. They were in jail in Kolbuszowa about two weeks.",
        "A: First, yes, and then later he was arrested, two days later. So, he -- now my brother was arrested,\nmy brother-in-law wasn\u2019t arrested, because my brother-in-law, I\u2019m writing also in the book,\nthere was before the ghetto was established they took a certain amount of Jews from the market\nplace and they sent them away to have less Jews by us. He wasn\u2019t there, so they didn\u2019t arrest\nhim. Later though he came back, we paid money, he came back, so there was no Judenrat. Now\nwe were alone so naturally the police started to come in and the police started to make orders\nbut then he said he\u2019s looking for a new head of the Judenrat. While they were sitting in jail,\nthey were also sitting two brothers, their name was Rappaport, Yanchi Rappaport and Pashi\nRappaport and they were Jews without beards, they were young, they were educated Jews.\nThey had their business before the war that they used to send pigs to Katervitz it\u2019s a big town\nnear the German border, this was their business, so Anderman said....",
        "A: Yeah, this was their business. They bought pigs, they sent them out, they slaughtered them, they\nsent the meat to this town and they had this business. It was a very unusual business for Jews\nbut they were not observant Jews, so this is what they did. Anderman knew -- we knew that\nTwardon\u2019s looking for a new but he wants to have someone with authority, so even in\njail, because in jail they lived in one big basement, it was not like a regular jail, but they kept\nthem in the basement from the magistrate building. So Anderman said that if he would ask\nsomebody to become the president of Judenrat everybody should refuse. This way if\neveryone would refuse and to say that they cannot take care on this only Anderman can. This\nmaybe will force them to let out Anderman. Meanwhile this Rappaport who was there he didn\u2019t\nlisten to him and he told his wife to go to Twardon and tell him that her husband, this Pashik\nRappaport is willing to become Judenrat. That he\u2019s young, he\u2019s energetic, he\u2019s good looking\nand the German would like him, and he speaks good German and they have a business in\nK . He looked at her, she was a good looking woman and one day the police came and\nthey took out this Pashik and they saw that he --. They take him away to the office where the\n___ so right away Jews started to suspect but he said oh nobody will become the ald __.\nAnyway he spoke to Twardon and he told Twardon he would be a good Judenrat man and he\nwill serve the Germans and all these things and he released him and his brother from jail, and he\nmade the president and his brother the assistant. Once this happened, Anderman said now we\nhave lost everything. We didn\u2019t believe that a Jew would do it but he did and this man started to\npick out members of the Judenrat. Naturally he picked out different kinds of people that\nAnderman wanted. Anderman wanted the best quality and he picked out from the people that\nthey were servant. He was in the cattle business so he took a few people who were in the cattle\nbusiness and a few black marketers. He made a new Judenrat. Now the new Judenrat started to\nwork and then the Polish population wanted to take away Anderman. Anderman could go out\nbecause, as a matter of fact, practically every night he went out to sleep in some Polish house.\nThis was watched, this jail was watched by the municipal police. They knew him so they let\nhim out and the next day before dawn he came back. The Polish people begged him not to go\nback. Eventually they would do something with those people, they will not keep them forever.\nHe didn\u2019t listen; he said that the Jews cannot take care. I am the one who can speak to the\nGermans for them; they listen to me. He didn\u2019t run away and then one day they came and they\ntook all of them away to J . They let out only three Jews, they let out, my brother\nincluded. If you read the book you will know the reason why. My brother-in-law came back\nfrom J. so Twardon said that there are some members of the first Judenrat, they should take\nthem in. They became in the second Judenrat. They were in J about two weeks. After two\nweeks they took all of them to Auschwitz and this time Auschwitz was not so prominent as\nlater. They took them to Auschwitz and as they took them to Auschwitz, the families start to\nreceive telegrams. They said this one died from cancer, this one died on pneumonia, this one\ndied trying to escape.\nLet me flip the tape.\nEND OF SIDE A, TAPE 1",
        "A: Must be -- because I bought one, it\u2019s not very good. All right so there came the telegrams and\nalways the telegrams had something to say. They had to sign, somebody died, let\u2019s say on lung\ncancer. Why they had to sign that he suffered from lung cancer a long time. Why they did it,\nwhy they make so evident a ------; somebody died on some other sickness, that he suffered from\nit. Then a week after they received the telegrams and you could see the postman came in went\ninto a house, that right away you could hear the crying and the screaming so we knew that he\ncomes with a telegram. About two weeks later, the same people received bills from Auschwitz\nwith bills to pay for the cremation with some ashes. They had to pay for the cremation. This is\nhow Anderman was gone. Meanwhile when he was arrested, his wife and son were left in\nKolbuszowa with non-Jewish friends. They went to Warsaw and they lived this Aryan as\nCatholics in Warsaw. His wife survived but the son was an officer in the Polish underground\nwhen it was the Warsaw uprising. Not the Warsaw uprising but the Jews of the general Warsaw\nuprising, he was killed in the uprising. His wife survived and after a while she came over here\nan old broken woman. She died here in America. For Anderman, when he was arrested so the\nPolish people, even the mayor who was in went to V and told them he should be\nreleased if he says the Polish patriot and he is such an honest man. He says this is why we\narrested him, he was too honest. I think that this Anderman that what he did for the Jews that he\nnever, never associated with the Jews, that he was an exceptional man. I always say if the Jews\nwould ever have saints like the Catholics have saints, Anderman should have been a saint.\nBecause he could have survived, he had a possibility; he had help from the Polish people, he\nwas considered to be a Polish Catholic. He said ,No, I cannot do it, I have to stay with the Jews\nbecause the Germans listen to me and they respect me.",
        "A: He went a little too far.",
        "A: Well, he tried because he saw that they respected him so certain times he went a little too far.\nHe was not a person that we call it like a Jew-boy. He always had his pride and for the\nGermans, he was not good. If you read the book, you will see a lot of things that I gave\nexamples of what he did. It was a little too much so he died.",
        "A: Yeah, well I didn\u2019t found it in this time. Later, a few years later, usually --. No, the photos of\nAnderman I had because I save them. This is one photo, I think from the thirties and one what I\nhad when he built the new house was few years, a year before the war.",
        "A: Sitting outside the house, I have it. Then I got a photo of his son. His wife gave me the photo\nwhen she was here. Now his photos from Auschwitz, now usually the Germans didn\u2019t make\nmug shots from prisoners. They had millions and millions, I don\u2019t know what they did, ;\nNow the people who were selected to be, to go the gas chambers. As you know, about 85%\nright away went to the gas chambers; about 15% they went to the camp. So the people who\nwent to the gas chambers didn\u2019t get the tattoos. Only the people who went to the right or to the\nleft like they had the selection. But very few, Anderman naturally was not -- all the\nKolbuszowa were not gassed right away. This time, there were no transports to Auschwitz.\nThis was a camp where they took mostly Polish people were in the underground or were in the\nblack market. Jews who were called for one reason or another, like the Judenrat. So they didn\u2019t\nhave selections; they were in the camp, some a week, some, some were two weeks. Because he\nwas doctor, and because he was an important person, they made him mug shots. This is the first\ntime I saw that somebody got out. The mug shots that I got out about ten years later, about ten\nyears from Anderman. They kept Anderman, for this I have the number and the triangles\nbecause they have two kinds of triangles. Jews have always had triangles, if he was a criminal\nor political, the Jews usually had two. They had political and Jews so the triangle made like a\nmyogen David. So one was a red one which was a certain other transgressions and the other one\nwas the yellow, the yellow was for Jews. So I got later from Auschwitz.",
        "A: Usually Jews had red and blue. One was political and one was Jewish. On this, it\u2019s black and\none, so I don\u2019t know. But this is probably what Jews had.",
        "A: Once he was taken to Czechowice. He was in Czechowice about two weeks. When he was in\nCzechowice together with the other people from Kolbuszowa; this time they arrested not only in\nKolbuszowa they arrested in other towns from the section where Czechowice was the head\ntown. We used to come to one place every week with packages for them because there was one\nof the guards that he could be bribed. We gave him money and he took the packages with\nletters for them. If they arrived, I don\u2019t know. Because I had a pass to go out from the ghetto, I\ntold you I went two, three times to buy, to bring the stuff, so I was the one who brought over the\npackages. We met in one place and there I met people from all other towns from around us.\nEverybody did the same thing. They brought the packages and later this German, somebody\ncame. They took the packages, they got paid and he supposedly gave them the food. But we\nnever found out because he never brought back letters. We send them letters. He could take the\nmoney, take the food -- but so long as there was hope, everybody sent them. I think once they\ncame in, that they brought back letters. He was there about ten days or two weeks. After two\nweeks they send both to Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, after a few weeks, I think after two weeks,\nthe telegrams started to come.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know because his telegram didn\u2019t arrive because there was nobody to send a telegram.",
        "A: His wife disappeared. They disappeared the day he was arrested. But the other people, the\ntelegrams came and I saw the telegrams. Mostly the telegram says that we want to let you\nknow that your husband, this and this day, he died of cancer or he died on lung failure, TB. She\nhad to sign that he suffered from TB. Then some they were killed while trying to escape. But\nthis was not --.",
        "A: No, they were all gassed, they were all gassed. But in the beginning, we don\u2019t know because\nthis was in 1941. This was towards --.",
        "A: They were still building it, so I don\u2019t know if this were gas or executed, we don\u2019t know. I\nwould suspect that there was one --. The crematorium was already there. But the gas chambers\nI don\u2019t think were there. I never looked into it but I should have because after the war I was on\nthe commission. There was a commission that studied the crimes for the Germans. I was a\nmember of this commission which was headed by Hewlett Johnson (?). He was the Dean of\nCanterbury. {You have photos of him, don\u2019t you Norman?} Yes, I have photos of him. The\nArchbishop of Canterbury and he was the head. The members of this commission were\nprofessors of universities from all over the world. There was an American, a Russian and I was\nsent from the Polish government. There were two delegates from the Polish government. I was\none and the other one was, his name was Meega. But his name was not Meega, he was a lawyer\nfrom Cracow, his name was Dissenfeld. Later he lived in England. He was a lawyer before the\nwar.",
        "A: A Jew, yeah, distant. But then he masqueraded as a non-Jew. His name, he changed it to\nMeega. We were both sent but we were sent as members to this commissions, from the secret\npolice. Because they wanted to know what contacts they had, this delegation. They didn\u2019t trust\nnobody. So this Hewlett Johnson who was quote a \u201cRed Dean\u201d because he was very pro-\ncommunism. He was archbishop. They wanted to know what connections he had with the\nPolish underground, with all those things. We were sent and officially we were members of the\nPolish delegation but our mission was completely different. This Hewlett Johnson, the reason\nthey called him the \u201cRed Dean\u201d was because when it was the Korean War, he went to Korea and\nhe wrote how the Americans behaved and what the Americans are doing, very pro-communist.\nThen later I wanted to go and I went over to one commentator and wanted to tell him how he\nwas misled. How we arranged his meetings with the Polish peasants, with the Polish patriots so\nthat everything was such officially done and everything was lies. That the government did it\njust to show him. Then later, he said to me, listen they won\u2019t bother you, don\u2019t start because\nyou came over here. They will ask you how you know those things and --. So [I let it go. I\nwent, his last name, his name Barry Gray. He was a very outspoken commentator, I went to\nhim. He said to me, you come over here, you had so much trouble. Don\u2019t go into more trouble.\nI could find out from Auschwitz in the beginning everything because I was the authority but\nthere were so many things. The war was still going on that this was secondary to --. But I\nmade pictures in Auschwitz, I have the pictures still today. You don\u2019t have all because we\ndidn\u2019t come yet to those pictures. This is -- I made a list, the pictures that I gave you. Is\nsupposed to be 150 but actually 1t was 153 because some were made A.B.C.",
        "A: They\u2019re the same age, yeah. The difference was in about a month, I think. Now she was older,\nher name was Blimcha.",
        "A: B-l-1-m-c-i-a.. You got it? Blimcia. Lische, L-1-s-c-h-e.",
        "A: The father? No. The father was Shayadovid; the mother was my second sister, Malcia, M-a-l-c-\ni-a, Malcia. This was Blimcia. The other\u2019s names was Henoch, H-e-n-o-c-h, Kornfeld. You\nknow how to spell Kornfeld. His father\u2019s name was Moses, Moshe, we called him Moshe. His\nmother\u2019s name was my third sister Lieba. How you spell Lieba?",
        "A: L-1-e-b-a. {Just L-i, some people could read it Lyba. So it\u2019s better L-1-e that\u2019s Leeba.} So\nLieba and my second sister, born the same. Oh, you have the machine going? good.",
        "A: Now, there were, what I can tell you. They are beautiful, they were beautiful children. Will you\nmark down to send me the map?",
        "A: Copy of map. Now you can make two, three, maybe I will need it. They were beautiful\nchildren, happy children, playing around like children did. What the question? You want to ask\nif --?",
        "A: Very religious, very religious.",
        "A: Hasidic, yeah. Like Lische who was a grandson from a very famous dynastic rabbi which is not\nimportant which one it is. Kornfeld was a graduate of the Yeshiva Hach Lublim. We\nspoke about it before, the Yeshiva Hach Lublim. We changed there but I think --. How\ndid you mark down?",
        "A: Is wrong, should be Yeshiva Hach Lublim. You will remember,\nYeshiva Lublim. It means the Yeshiva of the Smart ones of Lublim {The wise\nmen}. The wise men of Lublim. Mark down that this is the correct for Kalman.",
        "A: You have it there? If you mark down, it doesn\u2019t get lost?",
        "A: Good, so you correct it because now it\u2019s wrong there Hach Yeshiva Lublim, it\u2019s wrong.\nYeshiva Hach __Lublim. So he was a graduate of this yeshiva and he was religious.\nQ; What did they do for work?",
        "A: Okay. Lische Shadovid had a wholesale flour business. This was my father gave him over part\nof our store. When he came in, he was never a businessman so he took a part of the store, flour,\nand he used to sell to stores and to bakeries, the flour. Moshe had a wholesale of textiles, mostly\ncrude textile for underwear.",
        "A: Yes. All through my father, yes. He was always -- my father bought them houses and he set\nthem up in business. Now what else would you like to know?",
        "A: Yes. Blimcia had one sister, a year and a half younger and her name was Dobcher, D-o-b-c-i-a.",
        "A: One and a half years younger, she was killed when she was two. I think two years younger.\nHenoch had a brother the same age, one and a half years younger, his name was Yussel. Moshe,\nyou know the business. They were with us together in ghetto. They lived together in one\napartment, consisting of two rooms. In the ghetto, Shadovid was a member of the Judenrat and\nthen later he was sent away.",
        "A: No, he was not arrested because he was away.",
        "A: He was away; for this reason he was not arrested to be sent away. Then later when he came\nback, Fathering said to accept him. Moshe worked like everyday jobs what they sent out people\nto work. Nothing --. {Slave work}. The children played in the ghetto, they had games like\nchildren games. But one, an exceptional game , which I want you should put it in, which this 1s\nvery important. The Henoch, he was like the ringleader, was very smart for his age. When he\nlived before we went to the ghetto, we lived not far from the German police. We knew the\nGerman commandants of the police. Everybody knew them. One was good, one was bad, one\nwas worse. There was one man, his names was Harenbeer. Habier is H-a-b-i-e-r. He had a face\nlike very, very like a bulldog. His face was not really a human face and he was very vicious.\nHe killed a lot of people. The children knew about it and their game in ghetto was that this\nHenoch and Blimcia took together a few other children. Henoch stood in front of them and he\nspoke to them German because he heard about it. He used to ask them, he had in his hand a\npiece of wood pretending this is a rifle.",
        "A: What he heard, how could he speak real German. He said Bist Du Juden? That means are you\na Jew? To the children. Now this was a game and children answered Yavol, yes that we are\nJews. He said, . Because you are a Jew, you are dead. He took the rifle and started to\npretend, poof, poof, one after the other. After he pointed the rifle, he said poof, they fell down,\npretending they are dead. This was their game. It shows you that the time the children of three\nand three and a half years had those games. Every time. the same game, got together, he was\nthe policeman. Yeah, also when he said, first introduced himself when he got the job. He said,\nIch ben Habier, he didn\u2019t know the Habier. He said he heard it so he said I am Habier. Bist Du\nJuden and this was the game. I think because they had such beautiful children, I think a picture\nlike this with this story --. They were sent in July, 1942, they were sent with their families to\nBelzec death camps.",
        "A: No, from Kolbuszowa, everybody was sent to Czechowice. But in Czechowice they were there\nabout a week or two weeks. Because what they did, the gathered the people from all the small\ntowns in one place. They wanted to have in one place.",
        "A: They liquidated mine. Then once they had them in Czechowice, then they made big transports.\nThey made five transports. With the first transport, I have the date, they were sent to Belzec,\nthis was July 7. They were sent to Belzec, together, in this day they send out 12,000 Jews. Six\nwere killed in a nearby forest by Glowkoff G-l-o-w------ Well, I described this in the book.\nThey sent 6,000 elderly were killed in prepared ditches and the rest were sent to Belzec.",
        "A: Deported to Belzec, yes. But at this time --.",
        "A: Together with -- yeah. Because only elderly and crippled were killed in Glowkoff. In this time,\nthey were so busy with the transport in July that they had to wait sometimes three, four days in\nthe cattle cars till it was processed this arrival. Sometimes they waited two, three days.",
        "A: They would sit there on the railroad tracks. A lot of times this was in the summer, there were\nten carloads. There were French cars, cattle cars and they were made out of heavy tin. The heat\nwithout water; sometimes they opened the doors, half of them were dead. They had to wait\nsometimes two, three days till there was place to process them in, to take them down to undress\nand to gas them and then later to cremate them. Well, actually in the beginning, they were not\ncremated. There were ditches which they filled the ditches, this was near the Russian border, so\nthere were ditches made, anti-tank ditches. I have a complete description because when I went\nthere, I arrested one of the engineers.",
        "A: Oh, yes, sure. Blimcia, she looked like an angel. She had light blonde curly hair, all curls. Her\neyes were watery blue. You know sometimes somebody has blue and they are like watered\ndown, very, very bright, light blue. And always had a face, she was chubby, had a face always\nsmiled. Like she smiles in this picture. Now Henoch, his hair was darker. It was a dark blond\nhair and dark eyes. He had a more olive complexion and he was always more serious than\nBlimcia. She was always happier than -- so this was --. {How about some chocolate to stick in\nyour mouth? }",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I should describe Henoch\u2019s brother. {You\u2019re not writing about him. Just the\nname is enough. }",
        "A: What do you mean?",
        "A: They treated them like a mother treats a child. They were crazy about them. Not only for them.\nYou see, those children, they didn\u2019t have one mother. They had five, six mothers because my\ngrandmother was --. They were more in my house than they were in their house because we\nlived not far. Blimcia\u2019s girls, their house was next to our house so a whole day she was by us.\nShe ate by us, she went home to eat, to sleep. The other one also, they were more home. All\nmy sisters, the other sisters considered them our children. Special with me, I was the closest\nwith them.",
        "A: No, not only the youngest. I was the one, especially in the war, that I used to go around in\ndifferent towns for merchandise. Every time I came, there was not a time that I shouldn\u2019t bring\nsomething special for them. If it was candy, fruit about the first cherries, the first apples, the\nfirst pears -- every time if I could only buy a few, it was for them. It was also, that we always\nlaughed, that they knew that I am away in another town and I have to come back. Usually I\ncame back on a bicycle; they always used to wait. By Jews there is a saying when you mention\nSabbath, you always say Shabot Kordish. It means the Holy Sabbath. She heard the Shabot\nKordish, there was another expression that when children came to their grandparents or to their\naunt, every Saturday they came for Sabbath fruit. They gave them a treat. They used to come in\nand they used to say Shabbos Optz. Optz means in Jewish, fruit. They used to give to ess\nShabbos Optz to get something. When they waited for me to bring something, somebody\nmentioned oh you waiting for him because he\u2019s going to bring you Shabbos Optz. This girl she\nremembered something but she didn\u2019t remember exactly so when I came in, so she came to me\nand she said if I brought her Shabbos Kordish. It means the Holy Sabbath because she didn\u2019t\nremember the expression. Since then she knew every time I came so both of them wait and\nthey say give me the Shabbos Kordish, it means the Sabbath fruit, the Holy Sabbath. But\neverything for us, we had something. Naturally they were the first one because we were a very\nclose family and the children from my sisters, were our children, were the same thing. It didn\u2019t\nmake a difference who the mother was, her mother, his mother loved us as much as her, and her\nmother loved her --so it\u2019s always the same. If my mother in the ghetto, if she had something, if\nI brought her something special or something, they were the first one to have it. I remember we\nonce received a package from Turkey. In the package was a salami, a Swiss cheese and a\npackage of chocolate. All kinds of goodies that we didn\u2019t have it in ghetto. My mother,\nnaturally took it, 1t was something, she divided it in small pieces and they were the first ones to\nget it. Later when I came to America so I asked my brother, we got once in ghetto a package\nfrom Turkey, did you send it? He said I didn\u2019t send it but there was once an ad in the paper that\nsaid when you pay in fifteen dollars, a Turkey company will send to any place in German-\noccupied Europe, a package. So he went, he sent in $15.",
        "A: No, my brother in America. He sent in the $15 and we got it. It was the highlight in the ghetto\nto get a package for those things. A box of margarine, a box of crackers, a box of tea, coffee.\nThen I asked him how many packages did you send in? He said once. I asked why once, we\ngot it. He said why didn\u2019t you send it every day. Yes, he could afford it. Every day, send in\n$15. He said well I didn\u2019t get a receipt that you received it. I said, how could you get a receipt?\nWe were in the ghetto. But to take a chance, maybe 99% it will get lost but 1% it will come in,\nwhy not? So -- it was late. I remember when we got those goodies, my mother divided and\nevery day they came and they got the piece of cheese, they got a piece of salami. We were very,\nvery, very close and naturally the children were everything. For this reason, now I have\ngrandchildren their age. I look at the grandchildren and I see those children and how those\nchildren were undressed. The mother had to take them in to a gas chamber. They had to be\nkilled being two and three and a half years old. The mind cannot absorb it. We cannot talk\nabout it because there are no words to talk about it a million and a half children.\nThose were such beautiful, beautiful children. They didn\u2019t ask nothing from the world, they\nonly wanted to be alive. Naturally they didn\u2019t realize what\u2019s going on. This is how they went.\nI think that f you will write about them, you\u2019ll put them both together not separate because they\nwere -- they lived together -- they were the same age, they lived in the same house. Everything\nI remember when they came to our house in the ghetto, they always came together. They were\nbeautiful, they were nice dressed and --.",
        "A: They lived, before the war, this Blimcia lived next door to us because my father bought them a\nhouse next door to us. He lived away, I would say about 200 meters. During the day, he came\nover. During the ghetto we lived on this street, we lived far away, maybe 100 meters. Only\nthey had to go all the way to us. So they were by us practically every day, all day.",
        "A: Yeah, with the mothers.",
        "A: They were with their mothers and fathers.",
        "A: And fathers, the whole family was deported together. You see, when you get a transport like\nthis with children like this and special to tell the story, their game. They didn\u2019t play ring-a-\nround-the-roses or something picking up flowers. In their mind this was something important.\nThis Habier went out and he killed Jews. They turned around in a game. I witnessed a few\ntimes, I was standing there, I couldn\u2019t grasp it. He tells and he imitates this German, he said\nwhen you are Jewish you are dead. Everybody knows that when he makes poof, they fall down.",
        "A: No, no, they just heard talking about. They heard talkings that Habier killed today a Jew. They\ndidn\u2019t see it no, but they heard talking about it.",
        "A: This was the German police. He was like a meister, like a sergeant with the German police.\nEspecially he was in this time, a very vicious man. He always walked around with his face, he\nalways had a big German shepherd on the leash. Because mostly German police had German\nshepherds.",
        "A: What? Tradon. Tradon, no. Because when Tradon --, well he worked, he was the police. But\nthen later he was transferred. When the ghetto was there, he wasn\u2019t there anymore. This was\nbefore the ghetto. They were transferred, you know. There was a other guy who worked with\nTradon, I describe it in the book, his name was Smicher. This is the one who came to beat up\nmy brother and then later he took him out from jail. Then later -- so he was also there. It was\nspecial certain German policemen that they were exceptional vicious. They were known for\ntheir viciousness. There were some who were nice. Nice, it doesn\u2019t mean that if they would\ncatch you without a band on the street, that they wouldn\u2019t arrest you or shoot you. But they\ndidn\u2019t go out of their way to do more harm than they were supposed to do. There were a few.\nThere was even one I also described in the book, that one who was also a sergeant, a meister.\nHe used to go for vacation home and he always used to bring stuff that my brother asked him to\nbring like saccharin and other things which was illegal but he brought it and my brother bought\nit by him. He made money and my brother made money. Now this is the one, he told us to go\nwith the transport the first day. Because he said, we don\u2019t control, the Gestapo controls it and\nyou never know when the Gestapo changes from one day to another. We went with the first day\nwith the transportation. So we had Blimcia, who else did we have to have there?",
        "A: My father was born 1882 in a village called Dubas, D-u-b-a-s.",
        "A: Poland, this was five kilometers from Kolbuszowa. His father whose name was Naftali, I am\nnamed after him, was the manager of a very big estate of the whole village because the village\nbelonged to our men. It so happened that the owner was Jewish too. Want his name?",
        "A: Now my father when he was a teenager, my grandfather sent him to Kolbuszowa to study in the\nyeshiva. He remained there and married my mother when he was 18 years old.",
        "A: Yes. Every marriage was an arranged marriage. He remained in that town. His own brothers\nand sisters, seven brothers and sisters came to America before the turn of the century. We even\nmade now a gathering of the 100\" anniversary of the family coming over. He was the only one\nwho didn\u2019t go because he was so religious.",
        "A: He was the second from the youngest.",
        "A: No, no. He was a manager in a village so he had enough to eat and everything. In the second\nbook, I\u2019m writing everything about this family, the whole life. Now he married my mother and\nhe started a business in Kolbuszowa. The First War ruined, he went away. Then he came back,\nthey started again and in 1919 was a pogrom.",
        "A: He went but the Jews didn\u2019t fight. They had a regiment that the Jews with beards that usually\nthey had guards, guarded trains. He wasn\u2019t long, he came out because he had a lot of children so\nafter a short while he came back. He was, I think, in the army only six months.",
        "A: Austrian army, Austrian-Hungarian army. Then later was the pogrom, then later --.",
        "A: May 6, 1919. I cannot forget May 6 because I was born May 6, about a year later.",
        "A: So.",
        "A: No, no, he was in the pogrom.",
        "A: They were hiding. They went to a Polish acquaintance that she board by us so that when the\npogrom started, they ran away with the children. They were there three days hiding in the attic\nuntil the pogrom finished and then they came back. But later he started again the business and\nhe started to become successful. Little by little he enlarged and he became a wholesaler. Then\nin \u00b020, I was born so he had nine children. When I was born, my oldest brother left for\nAmerica.",
        "A: He was devoted, he was a Hasidic. He was a follower of the Rabbi and he was\ninvolved in everything what went down, in Jewish and non-Jewish organizations. He always\nwas in the middle of everything. He was very active, for a while he was a member of the\nJewish Council and he was also deputy mayor of the town which a Jew could never be the\nmayor.",
        "A: My father?",
        "A: Well, he wasn\u2019t part of -- first thing he was a Jew with a long beard.",
        "A: And Anderman didn\u2019t want him. They took my brother didn\u2019t have a beard. You see a Jew with\na long beard was like a red cloth towards a bull. So he didn\u2019t take those people. Now before\nthe war, older people like my father were the leaders but Anderman wouldn\u2019t accept him. He\ndidn\u2019t have in his Judenrat one man with a beard. He was successful in business, every time\nbetter and better. More details about the business, about conditions I\u2019m writing this out of the\nbook. When the war started, we lived in our house then later we went to the ghetto. In the\nghetto, in the 18\" of April, the Gestapo came in and they had a list of 20 Jews because there\nwere 2,000 and they said they going to kill one percent. But the end was they killed 22 Jews.\nOne of them, my father was on the list. They killed him while we were in our house and the\ndetails are in the book.",
        "A: Yeah but the significance of him being killed is that before they shot him five times, the last\ntime, his last words were\n(END OF SIDE B, TAPE 1) (ON THIS TAPE 2 WIFE IS PRIMARY ONE BEING\nINTERVIEWED. HUSBAND\u2019S WORDS ARE IN BRACES.)",
        "A: My father was born in Delatyne. D-e-l-a-t-y-n-e in P , eastern Poland. {This is the same\nsection where this other guy from __.} Almost, but this is eastern Poland. In November, in\n1895. He attended agricultural school and also yeshivoth so he was very knowledgeable in\nJudaic studies and secular studies. His hobby was a painter. As a matter of fact this saved him\nwhen he was in the Austrian army. When they drafted him, he used to caligraph to write, to\nmake all the posters. {Not a painter of rooms but --}.",
        "A: Artist, this even saved him when he was drafted to the Austrian army that he was assigned to\nprepare posters or to paint posters and what else they had, proclamations, whatever. {I have\nbeautiful pictures from the three brothers what they were taken to the army. I think I showed\nyou.}. Then we went into the lumber business.",
        "A: Did I tell you that he was Dovid Mendel? Or I didn\u2019t say it, just my father, how did I start?",
        "A: Yeah, he was actually named David Mendel Petranker.",
        "A: Yes. But he was known as David Petranker. But when he signed he had to use it. In the lumber\nbusiness and when he married Freida Ginga Petranker, he settled in S and worked in\nlumber business.",
        "A: With my grandfather, now they have their private business until I think, \u2019\u00b037 or \u201936 when he\nbecame the vice-director of --. {In 1937, all the forests in this section were nationalized}. By\nthe government. {By the government. So when they were nationalized and they created a\nMinistry of the Forestry.!. My father was a Jew, so he couldn\u2019t become the director. { Because\nhe was a Jew, he couldn\u2019t be head of the Ministry of the Forestry so he became the assistant.\nThey picked out some figurehead, so he should be --}. This that they write in the book\nwho helped me in the war very much. He was the director, my father was the vice-director. {He\nwas his assistant of the Ministry of Forestry because he was a Jew but this was a very high\nposition. Besides this he had his own business too.}. He was an ardent Zionist, Hash __, likea\nmovement you know, that they believed in Hebrew and they studied Hebrew and wanted to\nmake sure that his daughters, you can see that he adored us. He was a very devoted father --\nthat we got the proper Jewish as well as secular education. When the Russians occupied our\ntown in 1939, I think it was the end of September, something, end of September, he was\ndemoted from his job. He had to work as a laborer, physical worker in scrap iron. Then thanks\nto an acquaintance, he got a job in a chemical laboratory, analyzing __; you know they used to\nuse it for heat. Peat, yes. The Russians so this is how he worked. When the Germans came in --\nI don\u2019t want what we went through, it was very hard because the is not very important\nwhat we went through. When the Germans came, he was assigned as slave laborer to work on\nthe railroad and in 1942, in October, they took -- gathered or took all the laborers who worked\noutside the ghetto, also in the railroad authority and they shipped them all to Belzec. On the\nway, on the way to Belzec, he jumped. You can even describe how he pried the boards of the\nfloor of the cattle car with his hands, no tool nothing and he jumped out of the running cattle\ncar. Only one girl, age 17 from Kolamia joined him. The rest I guess, they didn\u2019t want to\nseparate. They jumped and successfully reached a peasant house on the outskirts of Halech.\nAgain I was sitting there, this terrible, I was one hour walking distance and my father knew I\nam alive and then he went for me in ghetto. Reached a Ukrainian peasant\u2019s house who gladly\nemployed them as field hands because her husband was in the army in Russia and she needed.\nBut my father didn\u2019t see me at the transport, didn\u2019t see his daughter Amaria, who\u2019s still -- you\nmust put those people in, his daughter Amaria who was the last survivor of the whole family in\nthe transport.",
        "A: To Belzec.",
        "A: Yeah, because they took fresh from the ghetto. Then they brought from the working places\nwherever there are slave workers, they gathered together and they loaded on the cattle car. He\ndidn\u2019t see me. I don\u2019t want to go there because we had an agreement in case we are separated,\nit\u2019s all in the book.",
        "A: He used to come, dealt business, used to come for tea to our house. We were very friendly. I\nknow the name too, I don\u2019t want to use because it was told to me later. Pointed out to me later.\n{Why don\u2019t you use the name?! Isuzan Wizy.",
        "A: L-y-s-y-].",
        "A: Pointed him out and he was taken back to Steinswadoff to the Rudolph\u2019s Mill, this is flour mill,\nRudolph\u2019s which was a gathering place for the Jews who were supposed to be sent to Belzec.\nYou know the gathering place?",
        "A: And then they were shot, yes. Without food, without nothing.",
        "A: Yes, he was shot at the mill. So you see this is supposed to be told because first of all, the\ndevotion of the parent, to show even if you\u2019re safe, the irony of fate 1s that I was just one hour\nwalking distance from where he was.",
        "A: Mundich told me. Everybody told me that something they caught a Jew, like here somebody\nwould catch a killer or G-d knows what. You caught a Jew and what happen. My father was\njust one hour walking distance. I don\u2019t know that he is there and he didn\u2019t know where I am.\nHe thought I am in the ghetto and I thought that he was sent to Belzec, I didn\u2019t know. He told\nme that he would get in touch with me, within three weeks if he managed to get off the train. I\ndidn\u2019t hear from him so I assumed that he is dead. Therefore I let myself be persuaded by the\ncar ride to go to his house. So when this happened he heard about it, Mundich, but he didn\u2019t\nwant to tell me until after months later, what happened to my father. By the way, the girl who\njumped with him, survived. Mundich told me. She was by the peasant\u2019s house and then she let\nherself be caught as non-Jew to a slave labor and she survived in Austria because she got in\ntouch with this Mundich. Told Mundich the whole story. Also she needed somebody like I\nneeded somebody, when you are masquerading as a gentile After all you have to have family, to\nget some mail. So Mundich used to write to her. He just doesn\u2019t know when the war ended,\nwhat happened to her. But he told me he used to get letters from her from Vienna. This is the\nstory. I think it is very important, devotion, courage, no nothing to be packed like sardines; to be\nable to pry the boards; to jump out of a running -- any train to jump. The point is that you only\nhave slightly bruised knees. The girl was not harmed at all.",
        "A: {They didn\u2019t jump, they didn\u2019t jump. What they did, the train has a floor. The floor are\ngrooved boards so he pulled out two boards. While the train was running, what they did, they\nlet themselves down, through and between the wheels and the train went and they were not\ntouched.! I mean he had only the height, the bruised knees I was told and the girl not at all. I\nthink a story like this again, it\u2019s unusual, hair-raising, courage and devotion should be told. It\u2019s\nnot only because he\u2019s my father but this should be told the same thing about my sister.",
        "A: No, no. Before the First World War, my father was from a very wealthy family. He used to\nhave forests and they used to have mills. During the First World War --.",
        "A: Yes. During the First World War, it burnt down. They remained only with an inn and a grocery\nstore. This what remained and they were not anymore so rich. The point is also that his mother\nused to say always you see, material things you have, you can lose. She believe very much in\ngiving education to her children and all her children got education. This is why my father too,\nhe say, I prepare dowry for you, he had hard realty but I don\u2019t know if he would if he would\nalso foresee if I would be able to take advantage. So let me give my daughters the best\neducation that I can because with this they will be able always to make a living. This why, do\ndon\u2019t forget, this 1s from kindergarten, he paid --.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. Then secondary school gymnasium was very expensive and he had three daughters\nonly one year apart. He sent us all to all this and don\u2019t forget that the earning possibilities in\nPoland were not the same like in the United States. To be able to afford it, means that he had to\ndeny himself certain things to be able to do it. After all, he was not a millionaire, he was not the\nrichest man, he was comfortable but not the richest, but you always have priorities. With him,\npriorities was education.",
        "A: Oh, yes, this is good you told me. He make murals, he liked also to make enlarged portraits. I\nremember Hertzel and others and also he always liked to study. He learned French by himself.\nHe was an avid reader; he liked the history of in German. Actually he could quote you\nfrom the big German poets, Heine, the same way like from Talmud. Because of it, you know the\nJews did not like to go to courts when they had a dispute. They rather settle among themselves.\nMy late father was chosen to be the judge because of his knowledge. Actually, I wrote it in the\nbook but they took it out. I don\u2019t know why. They didn\u2019t allow me too much space in this book\nbut he read. But this is very important. So he was chosen to be arbitrator because of his\nknowledge. Between the merchants, business people and the people in the lumber business.",
        "A: Yes, Jewish merchants. They didn\u2019t like to go to courts, also the expenses and also they didn\u2019t\nlike to run always to the rabbi and the rabbi had like a judge. They rather settle in their own\nline of business, they thought they would be better understood than the other party. The two\nparties used to nominate, choose like a judge, it\u2019s called b \u2014_. My late father was chosen many\ntimes.",
        "A: He saw that there\u2019s no future for us in Poland.",
        "A: No, even before because of the anti-Semitism. He saw that {Nationalize was nothing against\nhim because he wasn\u2019t --}. But he saw that there\u2019s no future. Therefore he planned to emigrate\nto Palestine at that time.. He felt that he wants to give us education and save enough money.\nBecause in order to go to Palestine, you needed at that time, I think, 10,000 zlotys, not per\nfamily, per person. {5,000}. Families, 10,000 and this was a lot.",
        "A: At that time it was a lot of money. So he wants to give us education, therefore he taught us.\nMade sure that we knew Hebrew and as our foreign language in gymnasium, we had a choice\nbetween French, German and English. We have chosen English so we have to prepare it, to\nprepare us for studies in Palestine and to emigration to Palestine. What is if you want to know ,\nit\u2019s very unusual also about him. He didn\u2019t have any sons so you know we took from the family\n--. You saw the family picture, maybe you remember.",
        "A: A boy from that family, yes. He raised us like boys. The bad part is which later turned out to be\nthe good one, is that every Friday evening, he made us study with him after dinner. We had to\nstudy with him wintertime so called bocherash this is tracked from our sages and the\n, that means the sa . You know in the Bible each week is different. Imagine three\ngirls to keep us and to study and G-d forbid if we didn\u2019t know it. In summertime when my\nfriends used to go to the park for a walk or to the movies, we had to study with . This is\nalso the things of the sages and the wise men. If one of us didn\u2019t know, he deprived us of\nallowance to go to movie. You know there was a carrot and stick; a lot of laugh, a lot of\ndevotion, attention, strict like boys. He raised us like a Prussian officer. You know girls like it\nmore easy. Thank G-d my mother was a very sweet, easy- going woman. With my mother we\nwere like friends, she was also very young mother. With him, also he laughed and he bossed\naround four women in his house.",
        "A: My parents took him in, I think, in 1935.",
        "A: He was my mother\u2019s kid, first cousin. His father died.",
        "A: Yes. He died. At that time he was, I think, five years old when they took him. My father\nhim over. His name was Manasha. The same thing, my father sent him to the\nHebrew school, extra expense. extra clothing and everything. He still wanted very much a boy.\nActually this is why he had three daughters because he tried twice. Then he said the third time\nmust be boy and it wasn\u2019t. Now between you and me, it was in his family. All the\nsons, all the brothers had daughters, all the sisters had sons. It\u2019s unusual but this is how it was.\nMy father was the second eldest or the third eldest child in his family, the second or the third.",
        "A: No, wait a moment. How many there were. Five sons and three daughters. So he was the --.",
        "A: Yes, I think so. At least alive, because they had some children when they died in infancy. But to\nmy knowledge, eight and he was the second oldest.",
        "A: My grandparents were religious, not as religious as Norman\u2019s family. As a matter of fact,\nsurprisingly my paternal grandmother was very well educated in Judaic studies. She had done\nwith her children the same thing what my father with us. They lived like in a summer resort. I\nremember when we used to come there and his brother from Germany used to come, she used to\nask them questions. If somebody didn\u2019t know, she didn\u2019t hesitate to punish them by slapping\ntheir face. I remember this as a child when we went there. But the sisters went to school, the\nsisters used to all play mandolin, progressive. So the brothers nod their heads, progressive.\nThey were progressive, Jewish, traditional. I think about my father, what to think but the most\nimportant is really the episode --.",
        "A: Devotion and also the courage. Again he didn\u2019t go like sheep to slaughter, it\u2019s very important.\n{To pull out boards --} Unfortunately he gambled, he should really not gone for me. But he\ncouldn\u2019t live with the thought.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t -- how will I manage to shelter a child. He was saved by this woman, this peasant.\nShe didn\u2019t ask any questions. By the way, he didn\u2019t look Jewish. He was blond, green eyes.",
        "A: But my father was young.",
        "A: No, my father looked less like Jewish. I had Semitic eyes don\u2019t forget. With me, really was\nluck that the Germans thought I\u2019m Polish and the Poles thought I\u2019m German but no one took\nme for their own, you know. My boss questioned my eyes, Semitic eyes. In college, I was\nalways on the offensive instead of being on the defensive. You know the book when the\npoliceman followed me and I wanted to know if he\u2019s just a womanizer or really --. He followed\nme to the ladies\u2019 room. Instead to shiver and to feel defeated, I jump on him, what right do you\nhave to follow me? This is -- after all I knew who he is. This put him off! He was a police and\nlike nothing he would have given me away. In all instances like my boss, I start to say no and\nto deny and to be caught and to blush, I said most probably my grandmother was Jewish. He\nthought it\u2019s the best joke. You know this is how I was able. We saw now a movie and I told\nNorman, it was very similar I acted. Which was it, Norman, the last one that we saw? Oh, you\ndidn\u2019t the movie \u2018Shining Through\u2019?",
        "A: When she acts like a spy.",
        "A: The same. Don\u2019t forget I didn\u2019t have any experience and I was 17, 18 but somehow my logic in\nthis dictated me to act like itis. My father had a good chance. He had a very good command of\nPolish and because we didn\u2019t speak Yiddish, he didn\u2019t have the singsong like I don\u2019t have. I\ndon\u2019t have in my Polish and I don\u2019t have in my English. This helped a lot because if you have\nthe singsong, immediately they recognize it. Many looked not Jewish but they couldn\u2019t do it.\nSo please put\n"
