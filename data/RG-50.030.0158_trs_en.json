        "Q: Could you tell me your name please?",
        "A: Frank Meissner, M-E-I-S-S-N-E-R.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: In uh a little town of Trest, T- R-E -S - T. In Germany, it's called Trich. And it was a uh\nJewish community that has been around for something like two or three hundred years.",
        "Q: In what country?",
        "A: In Czechoslovakia. And uh the town is exactly half way between Prague and Vienna. And it\nused to be a very important Jewish community. The way it was in uh Central Europe that uh\nJews were mostly in the rural areas, and as the industrialization of Czechoslovakia, of\nBohemia and Moravia, took place uh more and more opportunities uh started uh (cough)\nbringing about uh opportunities outside the rural areas and so gradually uh the real people\nwith the guts would, leaved the little town and go to bigger cities in uh Prague or Vienna or\nBerlin. Some of them even would go abroad or to the United States.",
        "Q: Let's talk about Frank Meissner though, and Frank Meissner's town.",
        "A: Well, this was my town.",
        "Q: Tell us about uh Trest? Tell us about your family first.",
        "A: Well, in the first place uh the city was, has had a population of five thousand for years and\nyears and years and it still does. And uh the community from its highest uh the Jewish\ncommunity has dwindled gradually from something like four hundred to about uh seventy\nhundred (ph) in 1938. And our family has always been one of the important families in town\nand has almost looked like uh generation after generation; and the Meissners would be uh\npresidents of the congregation. Three or four generations that I know of - it's almost as 1f uh\nsome couldn't avoid this opportunity and uh my dad was a uh industrialist that uh had a\nfactory for making uh shoes, wooden shoes. And then when uh leather shoes became uh the\nthing to do he had to close down the factory and became in uh furniture. So uh my mother\nand father worked full time in the factory and I had a whatever you called it, German\nuh lady that would take care of me, and my brother-in-law. I had a brother-in-law that was\nthree years older by the name of Leo. So uh this lady uh took care of me till uh 1929.",
        "Q: How old were you in 1929?",
        "A: Well, I was born in 1923. I was six. I was just about ready to go to grade, uh to grade school\nand uh the furniture factory went bust during the financial troubles. So uh we could no\nlonger have uh anybody take care of me, and both my father and mother worked together.\nMy mother worked as a uh secretary, working for my, for her brother that had a machine\nfactory, and Dad couldn't uh get himself a new job, and so he became what is now-a-days\ncalled a uh househusband, I presume. Which was at that time very unusual. And uh because\nof the town was uh small we didn't have a high school, so when I was uh ten or eleven I had\nto go to the next town which had a high school. I would uh stay with a family during the\nweekend and come home, uh during the week, and come home during the weekend. And I\nwasn't a very good student. I was in fact a lousy student. I had problems all time and\nuh...with teachers and low grades and my father had to go to talk to the teachers to see what\nthey could do and I never flunked completely...and just barely going from grade to grade.\nAnd at one point in 1930 ... '37, the decision was to be made whether I was going to go on to\nsenior high school and the decision was that I would said Dad. And I said and I wouldn't. So\nhe said you have to. So I said uh, I'll show you. Czechoslovakia at that time uh if one went or\nflunked one subject in the curriculum, you had to go a whole year around and so I said I'll\nshow you and within two or three months I flunked out of Latin. And that was in 1937. And\nat that time I uh, it has already has become fashionable to uh let smart kids, teenagers to\nlearn something with their hands because chances were that one would leave the country. So\nI went to work as an apprentice in my uncle's uh machine factory and uh then this uh\npossibility came about.",
        "Q: Can we hold it for a minute? Because this is a good place, I think, to ask about what it was\nlike as a Jew in Trest. What was it like growing up as a Jew, particularly since your family\nwas as prominent as it was?",
        "A: Obviously in a little town like this uh you uh couldn't uh get away from being Jew, because\neverybody knew everybody else, whereas in bigger cities you could uh go pass by. So\nobviously in uh grade school I got beaten up and had all sorts of problems because I was\nJewish. And uh we uh lived across the street from the temple and by that time uh the\ncongregation was so small that we had to have uh mobilized everybody forthe _ group\nevery morning. So uh I was mobilized and of course getting up at six o'clock in the morning\nwas not exactly what particularly I was interested in. But my grandfather, my mother's\nfather, used to live with us. He was a widower, a guy with lots of uh sense of humor and so\nhe made it easier for me to make it easier to go to the synagogue in the morning. But five\ncrowns (ph) a week kind of on the side - that was at that time quite a bit of money. Uh...",
        "Q: Was your family very religious?",
        "A: Well, I mean at that time Czechoslovakia had mostly religious. There was nothing in these\nuh little villages. There was nothing except uh highly kosher and things like that. Uh and\nobviously being a kid of my father who was the congregation president, we had to at least\nshow that we behaved properly. And uh the congregation was very small and very together.\nAnd uh since most of the people from our town already had been the first generation that\nhave left the town and for instance in Vienna, there was a it is called, of Trest\nwhich had at that time more Jews, two hundred, than the city of the origin. Just like uh the\nU.S. has more Irish than Irish has in its uh state. And so people were always very loyal to the\nplace where they came from and in my, since my dad was president of the congregation, all\nof them would come and visit. And he also would be uh paying out uh I don't know what it is\ncalled - uh there was a great deal of loyalty to the uh young and old poor people that came\nfrom the eastern provinces and my dad had to help them, so we uh had quite a bit of both the\nwestern and eastern uh Jewish. By uh by our standards we were already the western Jews\nand there was always quite a bit of looking down on the eastern - the same thing that\nhappened between the German in this country and the Russian - I mean every major\ncongregation in the U.S. had these frictions. So that's uh basically the town.",
        "Q: OK. So as a young man then, you decided that high school was not for you. You flunked\nLatin. Uh and you became an apprentice. Tell us about being an apprentice with and\nwhat was it like?",
        "A: Well, in - I was an apprentice in the lathe, uh metal lathe uh proposition and ...",
        "Q: I don't understand.",
        "A: Lathe.",
        "Q: Oh, a lathe.",
        "A: And uh at that time the apprentices of course were taking care of everybody else and with\ncoffee and what have you and cleaning the uh shop on Saturday afternoons. So one didn't\nlearn a hell of a lot. But there was one week in uh uh when one went to a uh school that by\nlaw one has to go and he taught all sorts of uh drafting and kind of a uh vocational\nproposition so that was nice. On Thursdays one could be away from the factory and uh learn\nsomething. Uh the factory had uh produced manufacture of equipment for uh bakeries and\nuh meat proposition - that was a very specialized factory. And the factory still exists. No\nlonger in this machinery but now they make agriculture machinery. And last time we were\nthere in Christmas it was a terrible mess. But, one at least saw that it existed.",
        "Q: OK. So you were an apprentice, and what did you do next? What did you decide to do at this\npoint?",
        "A: Well, then this uh opportunity came up with the so I went off to Prague for a little . .",
        "Q: Back up. Tell us what a HaSharah (ph) was in your town and how it worked.",
        "A: There was no, there was no HaSharah in our town but uh we were put together in Prague to\nuh uh be uh prepared for going abroad. So we went for three or four months a school, a little\nschool in Prague.",
        "Q: How did you become interested in this?",
        "A: Because I was always a uh Youth Aliyah, a Zionist, youth Zionist. Uh that was the only\nthing that I was interested in high school.",
        "Q: Was there a large group of young Zionists in this school?",
        "A: Well there were maybe thirty or forty of them in the town where I went to school and to high\nschool.",
        "Q: Can you describe what you did as a group, ..... Zionists ...?",
        "A: Well it was just like uh like uh a youth group would. And uh would go out on Saturdays and\nSundays, and going out in to nature. And uh I learned uh Hebrew and knew about Palestine.\nMy dad was a very uh important Zionist, so it came natural. Except uh I was the only one\nthat did something about it. My uh uh mother had uh, we had several opportunities to go to\nPalestine but my mother just couldn't to get away uh from the the whole family and in uh -\nwell, it was this way. I mean it was a major decision just like any other decision that uh\nAmerican Jews that came from Poland or from Russia - some of them took and some of\nthem didn't take an opportunity. And my mother has uh always going to the uh going to the\ncemetery. Very important. And when it came down to the uh major decision it was always\nshe couldn't get away from the cemetery. And my brother-in-law (ph) was a electric engineer\nand in 1938 he was a real good boy, always a good boy. That was one of my problems that I,\nmy dad always said why can't you be uh like your brother-in-law. I told him very simple,\nbecause I am not my brother. But he was, uh he got a job in Anssuan_ in electricity in Egypt\nunder the English and uh he could have gotten a good job and good uh salary and mother\nwould never had anything with it. I mean they just said impossible to be that way,\nthat long away from us. And my brother-in-law was the good boy so he stayed.",
        "Q: This is your brother-in-law?",
        "A: My brother, my brother, right. He was three years older. And so he didn't take the\nopportunity uh opportunity and uh eventually went to Auschwitz with the whole family. So\nthere were always opportunities to get away 1n time which was not taken, opportunity was\nnot utilized. I was the only one because I was the bad boy and uh I couldn't care less what\nmy parents said.",
        "Q: So you went to Prague?",
        "A: I went to Prague for three or four months and then they uh uh helped us to develop a little bit\nuh kind of a uh farm proposition, learn some Hebrew and the basic idea was to go eventually\nto Denmark for several months, learn agriculture on uh farms, on individual farms, and then\nuh whenever the opportunity came to go to Palestine. So I lived on uh several agricultural\nfarms in Denmark .. .",
        "Q: OK. Before we get to Denmark, uh can you describe what it was like for you in in Prague?\nWhat was the city like and what year are we talking about?",
        "A: Well, I was staying with my uncle for six months, and we were just, there was sort of a uh\nvocational school basically and uh there were about uh fifty, sixty of us and all of them were\nthen became part of the possible uh Alyah because there were always some people that had\nto be made uh prepared. In my case it was relatively easy because I used to work on my\ngrandfather's farm but uh for most other kids that came from cities uh it was a little difficult\nbecause during the summer we were we were put out on the farms in Czechoslovakia. Just\nuh the same thing that we did in Denmark.",
        "Q: OK. Let's talk about that. Uh you're in Prague. When did you decide, when did you go to\nDenmark and what was ...?",
        "A: It's wasn't my decision. (OK. Tell me what happened?) By the time I was in this uh in this\nuh group of uh kids, it was just a question of when we could uh be uh exported to Denmark.\nBy that time it was not uh my decision any more. I could of course have said in the last\nminute that I don't want to go but uh in October 1939, you just uh obviously you would\nimmediately grab the opportunity.",
        "Q: What was October 1939 like in Prague?",
        "A: Nothing. By that time the World War II just started about two weeks I think it was, in\nSeptember something. And things were, on the surface things were relatively normal. Of\ncourse uh the Jews were running around wondering how they could get out of the place. By\nthat time of course uh for many of them it was too late. So the opportunity when grabbed. I\nmean it has never even occurred to me that I uh, that there was any alternative because that\nwas uh areal opportunity to get away from my family. And since they were Zionists but\ndidn't do much about it, I was the only one that did. As it turned out, I never eventually went\nto visit them (ph).",
        "Q: OK. So it's October 1939. What did your group do?",
        "A: Well they just put us together on the on, put us together, about thirty of us and uh we went by\ntrain from uh Prague to Berlin to Weinemunde on the on the German coast and went up to\nDenmark. It took about twenty-four hours. And of course we didn't have a clue where we\nwould end up. We were taken care of for two days of this group of uh the International\nLeague for whatever you know. And uh then they distributed us to different farms, both in\nun Zealand (ph) and the main island and on other parts of Denmark.",
        "Q: Who was in the group? You talk about distributing ...",
        "A: Just people like me.",
        "Q: From all over Europe?",
        "A: No, this was in Prague. I mean uh actually ours was basically of young people from Austria,\nCzechoslovakia and Germany and this happened to be a group that on October 10 or\nsomething like this went from Prague to Copenhagen. And then there were other groups\nfrom Austria, from Germany, for all together about six hundred of these kids what uh over\nseveral years - we were the last ones. They were uh the Hehalutz people, that the older ones\nthat already started ...to come to Denmark in about middle 1930\". And we were basicaly the\nlast one and the kids were very young kids. I was 16, I was the oldest, they were kids like\nfrom 14 to 16.",
        "Q: So you landed in Denmark where did you go, where you have take...",
        "A: I went to a little place then on the island south of Copenhagen in a uh very small uh Danish\nfarm, very uh very uh missionaries...",
        "Q: I'm sorry?",
        "A: Missionaries. And it was a small farm, and I didn't understand anything. They didn't\nunderstand anything. It was cold and I had to uh go into the fields in October and uh harvest\nsugar beets and things like that and for the first week it was pretty tough because still Sunday\nuh when they took me to the uh see the Danish minister, a Lutheran minister which spoke uh\nGerman, I really didn't have any way of uh communicate with them. But there were about uh\nten or fifteen people that were in that region, with a bicycle get together, and we had a uh, a\nteacher who would go around and keep us together, so we had about one day a week to get\ntogether. So...",
        "Q: Did the people on the farm, uh the owners of the farm, uh did they know you were Jewish?",
        "A: Of course. I mean that was the whole proposition. And uh I on the second farm that I went to\nI really became part of the family and uh and the boy and the girl really became my brothers\nand sisters.",
        "Q: Tell me about that farm? What were the people's names? What was the family like?",
        "A: Well, of course uh being Danes their name was Nielsen (ph) though you couldn't tell from\nanybody else. And it was uh, for me it was a uh small farm, with very diversified agriculture\n- mostly uh dairy farming and pigs. This used to be uh the Danish export of cheese and uh\nbutter and bacon. And uh in the good old days before World War II, they were bringing in\nfeed from abroad, mostly from the United States, and by that time it was cut off, so then the\nquestion was how to survive during World War II because most of the Danes were not very\nenthusiastic about about switching exports from England which was now impossible, to feed\nthe Germans. So was difficult.",
        "Q: The family's were, was named Nielsen (ph) and you said you were very close to them. What\nkind of things did you do with them?",
        "A: Well, everything that they did. I mean uh working, whatever needed to be done on the farm,\nand of course they had small uh groups at that time uh - ten miles was a long ways and so\nthere would be a community get-together around the church and they would have uh invite\nuh neighbors for dinner, things like that. And I was always part of it. As any kid, part of the\nfamily.",
        "Q: Were you, can you - were you on this farm when the Germans invaded Denmark?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you describe the invasion?",
        "A: Very easy. They had a uh, one had uh very primitive uh toilet actually above uh the manure\nbehind the, in the cows and I was sitting there in the morning and, and all of a sudden I hear\nall those, all those airplanes wondering what the hell was that. That's how the Germans\ninvaded Denmark. And the question was what do we do, and the answer from our group in\nCopenhagen that took care of us said uh just uh leave alone. Just uh don't uh...",
        "Q: Let's hold and stop the tape please. (Technical conversation. )\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Can you describe the effect of the invasion on a Denmark farm?",
        "A: I even never saw a German soldier. In '41, I went to a vocational school in Denmark. They\nhad uh four or five months uh during the off-season when they would put, they would put\ntogether teach young kids about vocational agriculture during uh when the snow was on the\nground and they could uh utilize their time in going to school. And the schools were very\nsmall, about sixty, seventy sch... uh seventy youngsters and I got scholarship and uh then\nhad to uh work after the six months working on the uh agriculture school. They had that\nagriculture school, they had that agriculture school they had a farm and so I became the guy\nto take care of uh the hogs and the cows. It was of the few jobs in my life which I hated\nbecause uh IJ had to do it because I had to pay off for my uh school and there was no way of\ngetting away from it. It was lots of work so in Demmark at that time one had to have a\nvocational school of this sort as a uh resident for turning up for the agriculture school. It was\npart of the uh requirement so I had to have this vocational school and uh the director of the\nschool had to give me a uh a uh a good uh (pause) well, he had to certify that I was at the\nschool, that I made OK and he just had me because I just had this uh, had to have this\ncertificate. So that was in uh '42, late '42, early '43 and in uh the middle of 1943 I finally\nended up starting in Agriculture College at the University of Copenhagen. I three years B.S.\nin Agronomy and uh it was in October, September, October '43 when uh I uh was a uh\nfreshman and one day I got a call, not I but the President of the University got a call in the\nmorning telling me that he should tell me that the Gestapo was uh on my tail and uh my\nlandlady said I should never come back home again. That was at the time when uh the\nGermans have gotten after the Jews. Uh the Germans did it differently from what they have\ndone in Central Europe and Germany where they uh got the Jews together in the center, in\nthe center and then they would put the Jews together before they were to export them to\nconcentration camps. Uh in Denmark, they couldn't get away with it because the Danes\nwould object to it so the trick that the Germans did is uh picked the people at home so that\none wouldn't see anything in front of the rest of the uh population. It just so happened that uh\nthere was a German naval attache at the uh German uh ambassador, embassy in Copenhagen\nand he was friendly, knowing what uh was happening and let the Danish uh Prime Minister\nknow what the Germans had in mind and that was on uh Yom Kippur and uh the Prime\nMinister let the Danish chief rabbi tell the people at Yom Kippur that go and tell them then\nto disappear because if they will be at home, the Germans will pick them up. So most of the\npeople, the seven million, seven thousand people, the Danish uh Jews, were disappeared and\nthe underground got them to Sweden. I think only about five hundred or so got uh went to\nTheresienstadt, most of them from our group because our group, uh we went, they distribute\n____ the Danish congregation so we really didn't know what was happening. And uh so then I\ngot this uh this uh uh the uh my lady where I used to stay called Copenhagen agriculture\nschool and asked the President to let me know that I shouldn't get back home again because\nthe Gestapo pick me up. So that was a chemistry class of a uh ... and the big plays where all\nthe first-year students were taking Chemistry I, in this big theatre and all of a sudden the\njanitor comes to the President of the University who happened to be a teacher of chemistry\nand tell him something and the President called me by name and I came from this theater,\ntook about a half a minute uh wondering what the hell did I do now. And so he said your\nlandlady called, and don't come ever back again. So I happened to, about two or three blocks\nfrom the university where a uh Danish uh uh Lutheran reverend whose uh whose uh young\nboy was a very close friend of mine, and so I went to the church and said what do I do now.\nSo he uh made a couple phone calls and said uh everything is fine. Take your bicycle, drive\nuh south of uh a little fishing village south of the international headquarters of Copenhagen\nand a lady will take care of you. And uh by that evening I was in uh Sweden.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: In Sweden. That's how easy it was.",
        "Q: Describe that trip. You were on your bike. Where did you go?",
        "A: Well, I left the bike with the lady and she took me uh at night uh to the little fishing uh port\nand there was a tiny little boat for thirteen, there were thirteen people of us and they just took\nus over to uh to uh Malmo and took about an hour and a half and it was October - very\nrought seas. It was lots of people left there outside out, because the sea was very rough, and\nthat was it. So by that time the Swedes already had uh uh prepared uh the need for putting\nthe people together to uh take care of them.",
        "Q: What, as you were on your bike going to to meet this lady, what were you thinking? What\nwere you ...?",
        "A: Not very much. All I did is took my chemistry books - that's the only thing that I had and I\ndidn't have a clue what was happening. And on the several days and months and years after I\nhave found out what really was happening, that the Danes have taken care of their Jews. And\nthat I was one of them. And uh I still don't understand many of the things that happened.\nEverybody has his own stories, uh explanations, interpretation, and so uh by that time the\nSwedes already had their organization for uh taking care of the Danes and uh taking uh\nunderground has taken about two or three months to get all the Jews across to Sweden and I\nwas one of the earlier ones.",
        "Q: What happened to you? What did you do when you landed in Sweden?",
        "A: Nothing. There was a old grade school where they put the people up and uh I went to see, the\nsame evening I went to see uh uh \"Gone With The Wind.\u201d And then I have read that book\nand was fantastic. And then a couple days after (cough) came some recruiter from some uh\nsugar factories that needed people to harvest uh sugar beets and seemed like uh the work was\npretty tough but they paid well so with a buddy of mine we went and signed or signed up and\nuh worked for about three weeks and then my buddy had a brillant idea. Said look, since we,\nsince we are uh students from the Agriculture College in Copenhagen why don't we offer our\nservices to the Agriculture College in Upsala (ph) in Sweden where the agri... agi school was\nuh located. I thought it was a idiotic idea. Who needed us? But I thought OK, it was worth\nten cents and low and behold they said come on over. So that's how we looked or came\neventually back to the University of Upsala and that I thought was really a good luck.",
        "Q: What did you do there? What was your job?",
        "A: Oh, I was uh working in a uh in a uh lab. (Pause - technical conversation.) So I was uh\nworking in a uh feed (ph) lab. But that's OK. Was and at that time 1t was much easier to send\nuh uh food packages to my family. By that time they already were in Theresienstadt.",
        "Q: OK. Let's pause here. You're talking about your family. Had you been hearing from them all\nthese years?",
        "A: Yes, every week I had a letter about what they were doing.",
        "Q: Tell us what was happening to them.",
        "A: Well, obviously uh the seven uh Jewish people in the in Trest gradually uh had their jobs uh\n- they couldn't continue them. Finally they uh took them and concentrated them from fifteen\nor so houses into little groups where the family would be able only to have uh two or three\nuh hou... places to get together. And every week or month there would be additional\nsqueezing and uh people would have to give their houses away and uh uh gradually would\nuh have to go to uh Theresienstadt and take a couple of thirty (ph) uh kilos (ph) that they\ncould take along with them, and then they would be in Theresienstadt for uh about a year and\nthat in October or September 1944 I would, I found out that they went to Auschwitz and\nthat's the last I ever heard from my entire family. My uh grandfather and my uh mother's\nbrother, my brother and his uh new uh he got married - the whole family just disappeared.\nThat was about uh October '44. So after (cough) from England, uh from uh Sweden I\neventually ended up in the Czech exile government uh Army.",
        "Q: How did that ? How did that happen? This is October '44. You're...",
        "A: It was uh, I was uh, the exile government said uh look, if you want a Czech uh passport, you\nhave to volunteer for the government uh exile army in England. So I thought, well, how will\nthey ever get me there, and it just so happened that they tried out at that time a possibility of\nuh getting some of the volunteers from Sweden to England, with some uh BOAC, uh British\nOverseas Airline, and so uh they tried and tried and tried, thirteen times after a uh getting to\nthe un airport in Stockholm and never, never, never was there an opportunity to try this uh\ntrick, and so I used to leave my luggage in Copen... uh in Stockholm because I never\nbelieved they would take us over. The thirteenth time they finally did. That's how I got to\nEngland in 19 uh September I guess 1944.",
        "Q: What did you do when you landed in England?",
        "A: Oh they uh went into some castle in Scotland. I didn't ever know where it was. So they\ndebriefed us and then I went to the Czech Army and...",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Where did they have the Czech army training?",
        "A: They had it uh near London. South end on the sea. And then after a little while they wanted\nuh uh the Royal Air Force needed some people that could speak English and Czech so I\nvolunteered for that and for about uh over a year or year and a half I was in the Royal Air\nForce, in the Czech uh part of the Royal Air Force and I since I didn't, already at that time I\nhad problems with my eyes. The only thing I was good enough for was weather forecasting\nand they put someplace up in northern Scotland, about thirty or forty miles north of\nInverness, and at that time by sheer chance and uh a captain that uh was in charge of uh\neducation on the (cough) on the base made it possible for me to finish my my uh high school\nby writing or doing it by uh writing...",
        "Q: I'm sorry. I don't understand.",
        "A: The Czech uh school would uh, or the Czech exile government had a uh high school for the\nkids uh that uh belonged to the uh Czech uh ministers of the government, and uh so the\ncaptain arranged for me to uh do uh my communication long-distance and uh so eventually I\ngot my high school degree. So uh that made it possible for me after World War II to to go\nback to the university. So then uh when the war was over in Central Europe in May 1945 I\nuh went back to Prague looking for my parents. By that time I thought maybe it would have\nbeen long enough time to, for them to come back, but they were not and uh a lady that was\nin uh in uh the mail room in the little city was a friend of our family's and she wrote to me\nand says, your folks have not come back and we have very small chances that they might be.\nSo that was in uh May or June 1945. So that's the end of the story.",
        "Q: What did you do at that point?",
        "A: Well, I was uh, at that time I was 1n the Air Force, and uh decided there was no purpose for\nme to go back to Czechslovakia. So I required to get to be uh taken (technical conversation),\nso I was demobilized in Copenhagen instead of in Prague, and so I was through in January\n'46 and immediately started going back to the University of uh agriculture, the University of\nCopenhagen and then the Danes of course took care of me just as if I were a Dane, and I got\nuh scholarship and all sorts of things. And then uh in part uh during the undergraduate work\nI uh worked as a uh uh a foreign correspondent to some Czech newspapers and did some\nwork for the Ministry of Agriculture in Prague. Enough to make a little extra. And so I went\nback in 1948 when I graduated from Copenhagen and the Communists came in.\u2019 I went back\nto Copenhagen and then eventually came to the United States.",

        "A: In uh a little town of Trest, T- R-E -S - T. In Germany, it's called Trich. And it was a uh\nJewish community that has been around for something like two or three hundred years.",
        "A: In Czechoslovakia. And uh the town is exactly half way between Prague and Vienna. And it\nused to be a very important Jewish community. The way it was in uh Central Europe that uh\nJews were mostly in the rural areas, and as the industrialization of Czechoslovakia, of\nBohemia and Moravia, took place uh more and more opportunities uh started uh (cough)\nbringing about uh opportunities outside the rural areas and so gradually uh the real people\nwith the guts would, leaved the little town and go to bigger cities in uh Prague or Vienna or\nBerlin. Some of them even would go abroad or to the United States.",
        "A: Well, this was my town.",
        "A: Well, in the first place uh the city was, has had a population of five thousand for years and\nyears and years and it still does. And uh the community from its highest uh the Jewish\ncommunity has dwindled gradually from something like four hundred to about uh seventy\nhundred (ph) in 1938. And our family has always been one of the important families in town\nand has almost looked like uh generation after generation; and the Meissners would be uh\npresidents of the congregation. Three or four generations that I know of - it's almost as 1f uh\nsome couldn't avoid this opportunity and uh my dad was a uh industrialist that uh had a\nfactory for making uh shoes, wooden shoes. And then when uh leather shoes became uh the\nthing to do he had to close down the factory and became in uh furniture. So uh my mother\nand father worked full time in the factory and I had a whatever you called it, German\nuh lady that would take care of me, and my brother-in-law. I had a brother-in-law that was\nthree years older by the name of Leo. So uh this lady uh took care of me till uh 1929.",
        "A: Well, I was born in 1923. I was six. I was just about ready to go to grade, uh to grade school\nand uh the furniture factory went bust during the financial troubles. So uh we could no\nlonger have uh anybody take care of me, and both my father and mother worked together.\nMy mother worked as a uh secretary, working for my, for her brother that had a machine\nfactory, and Dad couldn't uh get himself a new job, and so he became what is now-a-days\ncalled a uh househusband, I presume. Which was at that time very unusual. And uh because\nof the town was uh small we didn't have a high school, so when I was uh ten or eleven I had\nto go to the next town which had a high school. I would uh stay with a family during the\nweekend and come home, uh during the week, and come home during the weekend. And I\nwasn't a very good student. I was in fact a lousy student. I had problems all time and\nuh...with teachers and low grades and my father had to go to talk to the teachers to see what\nthey could do and I never flunked completely...and just barely going from grade to grade.\nAnd at one point in 1930 ... '37, the decision was to be made whether I was going to go on to\nsenior high school and the decision was that I would said Dad. And I said and I wouldn't. So\nhe said you have to. So I said uh, I'll show you. Czechoslovakia at that time uh if one went or\nflunked one subject in the curriculum, you had to go a whole year around and so I said I'll\nshow you and within two or three months I flunked out of Latin. And that was in 1937. And\nat that time I uh, it has already has become fashionable to uh let smart kids, teenagers to\nlearn something with their hands because chances were that one would leave the country. So\nI went to work as an apprentice in my uncle's uh machine factory and uh then this uh\npossibility came about.",
        "A: Obviously in a little town like this uh you uh couldn't uh get away from being Jew, because\neverybody knew everybody else, whereas in bigger cities you could uh go pass by. So\nobviously in uh grade school I got beaten up and had all sorts of problems because I was\nJewish. And uh we uh lived across the street from the temple and by that time uh the\ncongregation was so small that we had to have uh mobilized everybody forthe _ group\nevery morning. So uh I was mobilized and of course getting up at six o'clock in the morning\nwas not exactly what particularly I was interested in. But my grandfather, my mother's\nfather, used to live with us. He was a widower, a guy with lots of uh sense of humor and so\nhe made it easier for me to make it easier to go to the synagogue in the morning. But five\ncrowns (ph) a week kind of on the side - that was at that time quite a bit of money. Uh...",
        "A: Well, I mean at that time Czechoslovakia had mostly religious. There was nothing in these\nuh little villages. There was nothing except uh highly kosher and things like that. Uh and\nobviously being a kid of my father who was the congregation president, we had to at least\nshow that we behaved properly. And uh the congregation was very small and very together.\nAnd uh since most of the people from our town already had been the first generation that\nhave left the town and for instance in Vienna, there was a it is called, of Trest\nwhich had at that time more Jews, two hundred, than the city of the origin. Just like uh the\nU.S. has more Irish than Irish has in its uh state. And so people were always very loyal to the\nplace where they came from and in my, since my dad was president of the congregation, all\nof them would come and visit. And he also would be uh paying out uh I don't know what it is\ncalled - uh there was a great deal of loyalty to the uh young and old poor people that came\nfrom the eastern provinces and my dad had to help them, so we uh had quite a bit of both the\nwestern and eastern uh Jewish. By uh by our standards we were already the western Jews\nand there was always quite a bit of looking down on the eastern - the same thing that\nhappened between the German in this country and the Russian - I mean every major\ncongregation in the U.S. had these frictions. So that's uh basically the town.",
        "A: Well, in - I was an apprentice in the lathe, uh metal lathe uh proposition and ...",
        "A: Lathe.",
        "A: And uh at that time the apprentices of course were taking care of everybody else and with\ncoffee and what have you and cleaning the uh shop on Saturday afternoons. So one didn't\nlearn a hell of a lot. But there was one week in uh uh when one went to a uh school that by\nlaw one has to go and he taught all sorts of uh drafting and kind of a uh vocational\nproposition so that was nice. On Thursdays one could be away from the factory and uh learn\nsomething. Uh the factory had uh produced manufacture of equipment for uh bakeries and\nuh meat proposition - that was a very specialized factory. And the factory still exists. No\nlonger in this machinery but now they make agriculture machinery. And last time we were\nthere in Christmas it was a terrible mess. But, one at least saw that it existed.",
        "A: Well, then this uh opportunity came up with the so I went off to Prague for a little . .",
        "A: There was no, there was no HaSharah in our town but uh we were put together in Prague to\nuh uh be uh prepared for going abroad. So we went for three or four months a school, a little\nschool in Prague.",
        "A: Because I was always a uh Youth Aliyah, a Zionist, youth Zionist. Uh that was the only\nthing that I was interested in high school.",
        "A: Well there were maybe thirty or forty of them in the town where I went to school and to high\nschool.",
        "A: Well it was just like uh like uh a youth group would. And uh would go out on Saturdays and\nSundays, and going out in to nature. And uh I learned uh Hebrew and knew about Palestine.\nMy dad was a very uh important Zionist, so it came natural. Except uh I was the only one\nthat did something about it. My uh uh mother had uh, we had several opportunities to go to\nPalestine but my mother just couldn't to get away uh from the the whole family and in uh -\nwell, it was this way. I mean it was a major decision just like any other decision that uh\nAmerican Jews that came from Poland or from Russia - some of them took and some of\nthem didn't take an opportunity. And my mother has uh always going to the uh going to the\ncemetery. Very important. And when it came down to the uh major decision it was always\nshe couldn't get away from the cemetery. And my brother-in-law (ph) was a electric engineer\nand in 1938 he was a real good boy, always a good boy. That was one of my problems that I,\nmy dad always said why can't you be uh like your brother-in-law. I told him very simple,\nbecause I am not my brother. But he was, uh he got a job in Anssuan_ in electricity in Egypt\nunder the English and uh he could have gotten a good job and good uh salary and mother\nwould never had anything with it. I mean they just said impossible to be that way,\nthat long away from us. And my brother-in-law was the good boy so he stayed.",
        "A: My brother, my brother, right. He was three years older. And so he didn't take the\nopportunity uh opportunity and uh eventually went to Auschwitz with the whole family. So\nthere were always opportunities to get away 1n time which was not taken, opportunity was\nnot utilized. I was the only one because I was the bad boy and uh I couldn't care less what\nmy parents said.",
        "A: I went to Prague for three or four months and then they uh uh helped us to develop a little bit\nuh kind of a uh farm proposition, learn some Hebrew and the basic idea was to go eventually\nto Denmark for several months, learn agriculture on uh farms, on individual farms, and then\nuh whenever the opportunity came to go to Palestine. So I lived on uh several agricultural\nfarms in Denmark .. .",
        "A: Well, I was staying with my uncle for six months, and we were just, there was sort of a uh\nvocational school basically and uh there were about uh fifty, sixty of us and all of them were\nthen became part of the possible uh Alyah because there were always some people that had\nto be made uh prepared. In my case it was relatively easy because I used to work on my\ngrandfather's farm but uh for most other kids that came from cities uh it was a little difficult\nbecause during the summer we were we were put out on the farms in Czechoslovakia. Just\nuh the same thing that we did in Denmark.",
        "A: It's wasn't my decision. (OK. Tell me what happened?) By the time I was in this uh in this\nuh group of uh kids, it was just a question of when we could uh be uh exported to Denmark.\nBy that time it was not uh my decision any more. I could of course have said in the last\nminute that I don't want to go but uh in October 1939, you just uh obviously you would\nimmediately grab the opportunity.",
        "A: Nothing. By that time the World War II just started about two weeks I think it was, in\nSeptember something. And things were, on the surface things were relatively normal. Of\ncourse uh the Jews were running around wondering how they could get out of the place. By\nthat time of course uh for many of them it was too late. So the opportunity when grabbed. I\nmean it has never even occurred to me that I uh, that there was any alternative because that\nwas uh areal opportunity to get away from my family. And since they were Zionists but\ndidn't do much about it, I was the only one that did. As it turned out, I never eventually went\nto visit them (ph).",
        "A: Well they just put us together on the on, put us together, about thirty of us and uh we went by\ntrain from uh Prague to Berlin to Weinemunde on the on the German coast and went up to\nDenmark. It took about twenty-four hours. And of course we didn't have a clue where we\nwould end up. We were taken care of for two days of this group of uh the International\nLeague for whatever you know. And uh then they distributed us to different farms, both in\nun Zealand (ph) and the main island and on other parts of Denmark.",
        "A: Just people like me.",
        "A: No, this was in Prague. I mean uh actually ours was basically of young people from Austria,\nCzechoslovakia and Germany and this happened to be a group that on October 10 or\nsomething like this went from Prague to Copenhagen. And then there were other groups\nfrom Austria, from Germany, for all together about six hundred of these kids what uh over\nseveral years - we were the last ones. They were uh the Hehalutz people, that the older ones\nthat already started ...to come to Denmark in about middle 1930\". And we were basicaly the\nlast one and the kids were very young kids. I was 16, I was the oldest, they were kids like\nfrom 14 to 16.",
        "A: I went to a little place then on the island south of Copenhagen in a uh very small uh Danish\nfarm, very uh very uh missionaries...",
        "A: Missionaries. And it was a small farm, and I didn't understand anything. They didn't\nunderstand anything. It was cold and I had to uh go into the fields in October and uh harvest\nsugar beets and things like that and for the first week it was pretty tough because still Sunday\nuh when they took me to the uh see the Danish minister, a Lutheran minister which spoke uh\nGerman, I really didn't have any way of uh communicate with them. But there were about uh\nten or fifteen people that were in that region, with a bicycle get together, and we had a uh, a\nteacher who would go around and keep us together, so we had about one day a week to get\ntogether. So...",
        "A: Of course. I mean that was the whole proposition. And uh I on the second farm that I went to\nI really became part of the family and uh and the boy and the girl really became my brothers\nand sisters.",
        "A: Well, of course uh being Danes their name was Nielsen (ph) though you couldn't tell from\nanybody else. And it was uh, for me it was a uh small farm, with very diversified agriculture\n- mostly uh dairy farming and pigs. This used to be uh the Danish export of cheese and uh\nbutter and bacon. And uh in the good old days before World War II, they were bringing in\nfeed from abroad, mostly from the United States, and by that time it was cut off, so then the\nquestion was how to survive during World War II because most of the Danes were not very\nenthusiastic about about switching exports from England which was now impossible, to feed\nthe Germans. So was difficult.",
        "A: Well, everything that they did. I mean uh working, whatever needed to be done on the farm,\nand of course they had small uh groups at that time uh - ten miles was a long ways and so\nthere would be a community get-together around the church and they would have uh invite\nuh neighbors for dinner, things like that. And I was always part of it. As any kid, part of the\nfamily.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Very easy. They had a uh, one had uh very primitive uh toilet actually above uh the manure\nbehind the, in the cows and I was sitting there in the morning and, and all of a sudden I hear\nall those, all those airplanes wondering what the hell was that. That's how the Germans\ninvaded Denmark. And the question was what do we do, and the answer from our group in\nCopenhagen that took care of us said uh just uh leave alone. Just uh don't uh...\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: I even never saw a German soldier. In '41, I went to a vocational school in Denmark. They\nhad uh four or five months uh during the off-season when they would put, they would put\ntogether teach young kids about vocational agriculture during uh when the snow was on the\nground and they could uh utilize their time in going to school. And the schools were very\nsmall, about sixty, seventy sch... uh seventy youngsters and I got scholarship and uh then\nhad to uh work after the six months working on the uh agriculture school. They had that\nagriculture school, they had that agriculture school they had a farm and so I became the guy\nto take care of uh the hogs and the cows. It was of the few jobs in my life which I hated\nbecause uh IJ had to do it because I had to pay off for my uh school and there was no way of\ngetting away from it. It was lots of work so in Demmark at that time one had to have a\nvocational school of this sort as a uh resident for turning up for the agriculture school. It was\npart of the uh requirement so I had to have this vocational school and uh the director of the\nschool had to give me a uh a uh a good uh (pause) well, he had to certify that I was at the\nschool, that I made OK and he just had me because I just had this uh, had to have this\ncertificate. So that was in uh '42, late '42, early '43 and in uh the middle of 1943 I finally\nended up starting in Agriculture College at the University of Copenhagen. I three years B.S.\nin Agronomy and uh it was in October, September, October '43 when uh I uh was a uh\nfreshman and one day I got a call, not I but the President of the University got a call in the\nmorning telling me that he should tell me that the Gestapo was uh on my tail and uh my\nlandlady said I should never come back home again. That was at the time when uh the\nGermans have gotten after the Jews. Uh the Germans did it differently from what they have\ndone in Central Europe and Germany where they uh got the Jews together in the center, in\nthe center and then they would put the Jews together before they were to export them to\nconcentration camps. Uh in Denmark, they couldn't get away with it because the Danes\nwould object to it so the trick that the Germans did is uh picked the people at home so that\none wouldn't see anything in front of the rest of the uh population. It just so happened that uh\nthere was a German naval attache at the uh German uh ambassador, embassy in Copenhagen\nand he was friendly, knowing what uh was happening and let the Danish uh Prime Minister\nknow what the Germans had in mind and that was on uh Yom Kippur and uh the Prime\nMinister let the Danish chief rabbi tell the people at Yom Kippur that go and tell them then\nto disappear because if they will be at home, the Germans will pick them up. So most of the\npeople, the seven million, seven thousand people, the Danish uh Jews, were disappeared and\nthe underground got them to Sweden. I think only about five hundred or so got uh went to\nTheresienstadt, most of them from our group because our group, uh we went, they distribute\n____ the Danish congregation so we really didn't know what was happening. And uh so then I\ngot this uh this uh uh the uh my lady where I used to stay called Copenhagen agriculture\nschool and asked the President to let me know that I shouldn't get back home again because\nthe Gestapo pick me up. So that was a chemistry class of a uh ... and the big plays where all\nthe first-year students were taking Chemistry I, in this big theatre and all of a sudden the\njanitor comes to the President of the University who happened to be a teacher of chemistry\nand tell him something and the President called me by name and I came from this theater,\ntook about a half a minute uh wondering what the hell did I do now. And so he said your\nlandlady called, and don't come ever back again. So I happened to, about two or three blocks\nfrom the university where a uh Danish uh uh Lutheran reverend whose uh whose uh young\nboy was a very close friend of mine, and so I went to the church and said what do I do now.\nSo he uh made a couple phone calls and said uh everything is fine. Take your bicycle, drive\nuh south of uh a little fishing village south of the international headquarters of Copenhagen\nand a lady will take care of you. And uh by that evening I was in uh Sweden.",
        "A: In Sweden. That's how easy it was.",
        "A: Well, I left the bike with the lady and she took me uh at night uh to the little fishing uh port\nand there was a tiny little boat for thirteen, there were thirteen people of us and they just took\nus over to uh to uh Malmo and took about an hour and a half and it was October - very\nrought seas. It was lots of people left there outside out, because the sea was very rough, and\nthat was it. So by that time the Swedes already had uh uh prepared uh the need for putting\nthe people together to uh take care of them.",
        "A: Not very much. All I did is took my chemistry books - that's the only thing that I had and I\ndidn't have a clue what was happening. And on the several days and months and years after I\nhave found out what really was happening, that the Danes have taken care of their Jews. And\nthat I was one of them. And uh I still don't understand many of the things that happened.\nEverybody has his own stories, uh explanations, interpretation, and so uh by that time the\nSwedes already had their organization for uh taking care of the Danes and uh taking uh\nunderground has taken about two or three months to get all the Jews across to Sweden and I\nwas one of the earlier ones.",
        "A: Nothing. There was a old grade school where they put the people up and uh I went to see, the\nsame evening I went to see uh uh \"Gone With The Wind.\u201d And then I have read that book\nand was fantastic. And then a couple days after (cough) came some recruiter from some uh\nsugar factories that needed people to harvest uh sugar beets and seemed like uh the work was\npretty tough but they paid well so with a buddy of mine we went and signed or signed up and\nuh worked for about three weeks and then my buddy had a brillant idea. Said look, since we,\nsince we are uh students from the Agriculture College in Copenhagen why don't we offer our\nservices to the Agriculture College in Upsala (ph) in Sweden where the agri... agi school was\nuh located. I thought it was a idiotic idea. Who needed us? But I thought OK, it was worth\nten cents and low and behold they said come on over. So that's how we looked or came\neventually back to the University of Upsala and that I thought was really a good luck.",
        "A: Oh, I was uh working in a uh in a uh lab. (Pause - technical conversation.) So I was uh\nworking in a uh feed (ph) lab. But that's OK. Was and at that time 1t was much easier to send\nuh uh food packages to my family. By that time they already were in Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Yes, every week I had a letter about what they were doing.",
        "A: Well, obviously uh the seven uh Jewish people in the in Trest gradually uh had their jobs uh\n- they couldn't continue them. Finally they uh took them and concentrated them from fifteen\nor so houses into little groups where the family would be able only to have uh two or three\nuh hou... places to get together. And every week or month there would be additional\nsqueezing and uh people would have to give their houses away and uh uh gradually would\nuh have to go to uh Theresienstadt and take a couple of thirty (ph) uh kilos (ph) that they\ncould take along with them, and then they would be in Theresienstadt for uh about a year and\nthat in October or September 1944 I would, I found out that they went to Auschwitz and\nthat's the last I ever heard from my entire family. My uh grandfather and my uh mother's\nbrother, my brother and his uh new uh he got married - the whole family just disappeared.\nThat was about uh October '44. So after (cough) from England, uh from uh Sweden I\neventually ended up in the Czech exile government uh Army.",
        "A: It was uh, I was uh, the exile government said uh look, if you want a Czech uh passport, you\nhave to volunteer for the government uh exile army in England. So I thought, well, how will\nthey ever get me there, and it just so happened that they tried out at that time a possibility of\nuh getting some of the volunteers from Sweden to England, with some uh BOAC, uh British\nOverseas Airline, and so uh they tried and tried and tried, thirteen times after a uh getting to\nthe un airport in Stockholm and never, never, never was there an opportunity to try this uh\ntrick, and so I used to leave my luggage in Copen... uh in Stockholm because I never\nbelieved they would take us over. The thirteenth time they finally did. That's how I got to\nEngland in 19 uh September I guess 1944.",
        "A: Oh they uh went into some castle in Scotland. I didn't ever know where it was. So they\ndebriefed us and then I went to the Czech Army and...",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: They had it uh near London. South end on the sea. And then after a little while they wanted\nuh uh the Royal Air Force needed some people that could speak English and Czech so I\nvolunteered for that and for about uh over a year or year and a half I was in the Royal Air\nForce, in the Czech uh part of the Royal Air Force and I since I didn't, already at that time I\nhad problems with my eyes. The only thing I was good enough for was weather forecasting\nand they put someplace up in northern Scotland, about thirty or forty miles north of\nInverness, and at that time by sheer chance and uh a captain that uh was in charge of uh\neducation on the (cough) on the base made it possible for me to finish my my uh high school\nby writing or doing it by uh writing...",
        "A: The Czech uh school would uh, or the Czech exile government had a uh high school for the\nkids uh that uh belonged to the uh Czech uh ministers of the government, and uh so the\ncaptain arranged for me to uh do uh my communication long-distance and uh so eventually I\ngot my high school degree. So uh that made it possible for me after World War II to to go\nback to the university. So then uh when the war was over in Central Europe in May 1945 I\nuh went back to Prague looking for my parents. By that time I thought maybe it would have\nbeen long enough time to, for them to come back, but they were not and uh a lady that was\nin uh in uh the mail room in the little city was a friend of our family's and she wrote to me\nand says, your folks have not come back and we have very small chances that they might be.\nSo that was in uh May or June 1945. So that's the end of the story.",
        "A: Well, I was uh, at that time I was 1n the Air Force, and uh decided there was no purpose for\nme to go back to Czechslovakia. So I required to get to be uh taken (technical conversation),\nso I was demobilized in Copenhagen instead of in Prague, and so I was through in January\n'46 and immediately started going back to the University of uh agriculture, the University of\nCopenhagen and then the Danes of course took care of me just as if I were a Dane, and I got\nuh scholarship and all sorts of things. And then uh in part uh during the undergraduate work\nI uh worked as a uh uh a foreign correspondent to some Czech newspapers and did some\nwork for the Ministry of Agriculture in Prague. Enough to make a little extra. And so I went\nback in 1948 when I graduated from Copenhagen and the Communists came in.\u2019 I went back\nto Copenhagen and then eventually came to the United States.",
