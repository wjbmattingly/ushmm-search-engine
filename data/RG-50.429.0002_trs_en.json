        "Q: I would like you to begin be telling me your name, date of birth, and where you\nwere born.",
        "A: My name is John Woodruff. My date of birth is July the 5\u201c, 1915. And I was\nborn in a small town about 50 miles south of Pittsburgh. The name of this town is\nConnellsville. , Pennsylvania. It\u2019s spelled c-o-n-n-e-]-l-s-v-i-l-l-e. It\u2019s just a\nsmall town right, right in the mountains, about 30, about 32 miles from, from\nMorgantown, West Virginia. That\u2019s where I was born.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about what it was like growing up, your family.",
        "A: Well, I grew up in a uh well it was a poor family. We didn\u2019t have too much you\nsee. And of course there was a lot of members of my family. My, my mother\nbirthed twelve children. I was the eleventh child. Well the, it was eight girls and\nthere was four boys. Now all the girls grew up to be adults except one that which\nwas the twelfth child and she, and she died in infancy. Two of my brothers died\nin infa, two of my older brothers. And one brother got killed hunting when he was\nsixteen years of age. And that\u2019s how, that\u2019s, that\u2019s how my family, family was set\nup. Cause my mother married when she was nineteen and my father was twenty-\ntwo. They had this large family which was too many children, too many children.\nBut they made it.",
        "Q: What do you remember about your family life and how you lived and what you\ndid and in general?",
        "A: Well uh of course my father was a laborer. He dug coal. He carried hod on, on\nconstruction work. He worked in the coke ovens there in, in uh, in my home\ntown. And that\u2019s how he made his living. Cause my mother she did days work\nfor some of the families there in, in the area in which we, where we were living.\nAnd that\u2019s how, that\u2019s how we survived. As I said before, we didn\u2019t have too\nmuch, but we managed to make it under the circumstances.",
        "Q: Do you have good memories of your childhood, of some of the values that were\ninstalled in you?",
        "A: Well you see my, both of my parents they weren\u2019t, they weren\u2019t very well\neducated you see. In fact my father went, I think he went to about the eighth\ngrade and my mother went to about fourth grade. And uh they didn\u2019t put too\nmuch stress. There was no, was never at any time that my parents would sit down\n1\n2\nand discuss education. Because they didn\u2019t have much education themselves.\nAnd the only thing that they were concerned about was me going to school uh\nkeeping up my attendance in school to keep the truant officer from bothering\nthem. That was, that, that was, that was their extent as, as far as my education\nwas concerned.",
        "Q: But you went forward with it. You were interested.",
        "A: Yes, well, of course, coming along, coming along in the early grades and well, of\ncourse, I, I used to play truant ever, once in a while, to, to go to the movies with a\nfriend of mine. And uh but we never, you know, we never got into any real, real\ntrouble, you know, uh per se. and, of course, I continued to um, not to get ahead\nof my story, I quit school when I was sixteen. See back there, you know, the kids\nwhen they reached the age of sixteen, they wanted to quit school and, and go to\nwork in the factory. There was a couple of factories. There was a box factory\nand there was a glass factory. Well I quit when I was sixteen, but I couldn\u2019t get a\njob because they discriminated against blacks in the, in the, in those industries.\nSo I, I, I sat around for a while. I guess about a year. And I decided well I better\ngo on back to school. So I went back to school, starting in, in my freshman year.\nAnd then I tried to join the Navy. Well the Navy had a quota for, for, for blacks.\nAnd the quota was filled. And, of course I wasn\u2019t interested in the Army at that\nparticular time because I had a couple brother-in-laws who, who was, who had\ngone into the Army and, of course, they\u2019d told me some stories that was, wasn\u2019t\ntoo pleasant. So I didn\u2019t have any interest in the Army. So I continued on,\ncontinued on in school. I completed my freshman year and my sophomore year,\nand then I went into the city school, cause my freshman and sophomore year, they\ndidn\u2019t have any athletics in the school at all, which I could participate in. So I\nwent into the city school in my junior year, and I went out for football. Well I\nstayed out for football up until a week before the first game, and my mother made\nme quit because I was getting home too late to after pract uh football practice to\ntake care of my chores around the house. So the, the line coach of the football\nwas, was a track coach of the school and he noticed that I, I had uh quite a bit of\nspeed when he had us running wind sprints up and down the field in our football\nuniform. So he asked me to come out for track. So that\u2019s how I got started in\ntrack. And, of course, I, I started progressing quite well in, in uh my track\nactivities and he told me don\u2019t, don\u2019t go back, go out for football anymore,\nbecause he was afraid I might get hurt. So that\u2019s how I started my track career.",
        "Q: Prior to that had you been real active in sports in your other schools or at home?",
        "A: Well, when you, I was active like on, on like we played a little sandlot, sandlot\nbaseball uh and uh softball, those type of sports. I nev, I was never interested in\nbasketball. I tried, tried it but I never, never could uh never become real\ninterested in basketball at all see. But softball and uh baseball was the thing, was\nthe two sports that I was quite interested in.\n2\n3",
        "Q: You mentioned a little bit about certain doors that were closed to you as a black\nperson. Did you face a lot of racism in Pennsylvania? Were you aware of it?",
        "A: Well there was some, it was some, there was some around that area see cause I\ngrew up in a, in, 1n a, in an, in an environment where there\u2019s all whites. There\nwas only two black families, my family and another family. All my playmates,\nall my schoolmates were white kids. So I didn\u2019t, well of course there was, there\nwas, it was times when uh we\u2019d, we\u2019d get into fights with some of maybe one of\nthe kids maybe called me nigger. And, of course, naturally, that, that was, that\nwas a fighting word see. So we\u2019d fight. Next day we\u2019re friends again. That\u2019s the\nway it was.",
        "Q: So you were used to that banter. Were there other experiences, personal\nexperiences that were difficult for you as a black person? At that time.",
        "A: Well there was, there was, there was some, there was some, there was some\ndifficulty in terms like in trying to get little jobs around that area see. They\ndiscriminated against, against the blacks. But that was, that was about all, you\nsee. That was about all.",
        "Q: Now you got active in sports and track. Did you experience racism in sports?",
        "A: No. No. Not at all. Not at all. My high school coach who, who uh who uh\ncoached me in track was a very fine man. His name is Joseph Lourou. He was a\nwonderful man and he was a wonderful coach. And he taught me a number of\nthings that I did, that I wasn\u2019t taught at home, you know, about how to conduct\nmyself. Of course I was doing a little smoking at the time. He told me to give\nthat up, which I did. And he said if I, if I continued doing well in my track\nactivities I had a chance to go to college. Well that was just unheard of in my\nfamily of going to college, you see. Because no, no, no member of my family\nfinished high school. So I dropped all my little habits that I had that was, that\nwould, would be detrimental to me achieving my goal or my goals. And I ended\nup getting a scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh after I was graduated in\n1935.",
        "Q: How important were sports to you? And why?",
        "A: Well it was, well, of course, at that particular time, it was very important to me\nbecause it enabled me.",
        "Q: I need you to say that again, at that time sports were important to me.",
        "A: Well at that time sports were important to me and particularly the, the track\nactivity type of sports, because that enabled me to get a scholarship to college.\nAnd that was the only way that I could go to college was through athletics. My\nparents didn\u2019t have the money to send me to school. I fact I didn\u2019t even have\n3\n4\nwhen I, when I received the scholarship at the University of Pittsburgh. I didn\u2019t\neven have transportation to get to school. And the sheriff of my home town had\nhis chauffeur to drive me to school. That\u2019s how I got to school in the, in the fall\nof \u00b035. And money, I had exactly twenty-five cents in my pockets when I entered\nthe University of Pittsburgh. That\u2019s all the money I had. Cause as I said earlier I\ncame from a poor family.",
        "Q: So you saw sports not just for the joy of being an athlete but as a, a way to help\nyou further yourself.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Correct. And of course when I got the scholarship, and I, when I\nwent to the University of Pittsburgh, cause I told all, all my friends at home, I said\nif I don\u2019t make it, I\u2019m not coming back to Connellsville. But I made it. I made it.\nI worked hard and I made it.",
        "Q: How good were you as a track?",
        "A: Well course I was the best, I was the best in high school. And of course when I\nwent to Pitt I was able to beat all the athletes, all the athletes that was on the track\nteam on my that ran in my race at Pitt in my freshman year. I came along very,\nvery fast. My junior year in, in high school, of course my races were quite slow,\nbut they showed progress. But then my senior year, I, I just bloomed. I just came\ninto my own. Uh I, my uh main event was the mile. That was, that was the one\nthe event that my coach had me concentrate on see. Well the first mile that I ran\nin high school, my junior year in high school was four minutes and forty-four\nseconds. In my senior year I ran four twenty-three four. I came along that fast.\nAnd of course when I ran that race I, I ran the second fastest school boy, school\nboy mile in the country, four twenty-three four. Al, Al Zamperine who was on\nthe Olympic team with me, he ran four twenty-one something. But when I won\nmy race in my round, my mile, when I won my mile race, I won it about a\nhundred and twenty yards ahead of the man who was uh ran second to me.\nCourse if I had somebody to push me, it would have been faster.",
        "Q: So you were pretty good. Were you thinking in terms of Olympics?",
        "A: No. No. When I completed my freshman year at Pitt, that summer I had intended\nto go on home and take it easy for the summer. But my coach asked me to try out\nfor the Olympic team. Course I had no idea that he wanted me to do that, you see.\nSo I said okay, we\u2019ll try out for it. So I tried out for it. I qualified in the\npreliminaries which they ran at the University of Pittsburgh. I qualified in the\nsemi-finals which they ran at Harvard Stadium winning the event in the, in the, in\nthe half a mile. And then at Randall\u2019s Island where they ran the finals, I, I, I won\nmy event there and I went to Berlin, Germany, and won my event.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll get to that in a minute. But that\u2019s. So you had no thoughts about being an\nOlympic star?\n4\n5",
        "A: None whatsoever. In fact I never even thought in terms of, of, of going to the\nOlympics. Never thought in terms of that at all. And it was the coach that uh\napproached me on that and said he wanted me to try out for the team.",
        "Q: So this was necessarily a dream of yours or anything",
        "A: No. Not at all.",
        "Q: When you were at the University of Pittsburgh, did racism enter into your school\nlife at all there?",
        "A: At the University of Pittsburgh? Yes there was, there was a, an incident where\nrace uh entered. I, when I came back from the Olympic games, the professor of\nmy English Department didn\u2019t want to let, didn\u2019t want to let me enter it, enter the\nprogram cause I was a month late. However, I think the chancellor must have\ninterceded and made it, made arrangements for me to get into the, get into the\nEnglish program. And, of course, another thing that hurt me quite badly when I\nwas grad, when I was being graduated from the University. They had what was\nknown as the U, the University of Pittsburgh Hall of Fame. Well, I was the only\nathlete to bring the school international recognition, but they did not, they did not\nuh select me for the Hall of Fame.",
        "Q: And you think that\u2019s because you were black?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what it was. But I, I, I, I can only, I can only assume that. Because\nnow they had, they had all American football players that brought the school\nnational prestige, national recognition. I brought the school international\nrecognition. They made the Hall of Fame, but I didn\u2019t. They were white and, of\ncourse, I, I was black. So what, the only, only, I can only assume it was because\nof race.",
        "Q: What about in your socializing and the friends you made in college? Was race an\nissue?",
        "A: No. But of course I socialized only with my own kind, you know, my own race of\npeople see. I didn\u2019t socialize with anybody else other than my own race of people\nduring the, the four years that I uh was going to the Uni, going to the University\nof Pittsburgh.",
        "Q: And on the, and in athletics it was a non-issue?",
        "A: I had no problem as, as, as a, as a, as a athlete at all because we were all, we were\nall on the same team. We were all very, very close. In fact the athletes\nparticipated with me even after we left the University, we, we were very, very\nclose. I know it, it uh in athletics you know you become, it\u2019s, you become, it, it\u2019s\n5\n6\nstronger than a fraternity when you\u2019re working with, when you\u2019re running\ntogether, training together, trying, trying to reach certain goals in, in your, in your\nsport, you become very, very close. And I still, and I still have contact with some\nof the, some of the fellows that ran on the team with me even today.",
        "Q: So in sports the racial lines just fade away.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: But in everyday life you were still confronting some of it.",
        "A: Oh yes. You were always reminded of the fact that, you know, you were, you\nwere, you\u2019re colored, you know, and that you there was certain, certain things you\ncouldn\u2019t do and certain things you could do as a result of your race.",
        "Q: Sports was an equalizer I guess.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And I think sports has done so much in order to make uh the country\na better country in terms of, of, of social relationships between peoples. And\nthat\u2019s what the Olympics does, you know. You be, you become very, you become\nacquainted with a lot of people in particularly people on your team and, and you\nbecome very close with, to them. And you don\u2019t think in terms of race when\nyou\u2019re dealing with them see. And they don\u2019t think in terms of race uh with you.\nI know, I know in 1950 uh I went to Georgia, to Athens, Georgia, and I made\ncontact with uh an athlete that won, that won, that won the uh high hurdles on the\n1936 Olympic team. Uh Speck Towns. Well now he was, he was a, he was a\ncoach at the University of Georgia. And of course back in that time you know the\nSouth was running rampant with, with uh racism and discrimination. So I\u2019m\nwhen I got into Athens, I call him up. And he took and he told me, asked me\nwhere I was, where I was stopping. And I told him. He said no you stay right\nthere and I\u2019Il come down and get you and bring you out to the school. And that\u2019s\nwhat he did. That was in 1950, 19 when, when the racism and discrimination was\nrunning rampant in (words missing in original transcript). But that shows you the,\nthe closeness you have with, with your fellow athletes you see.",
        "Q: Let me ask you before we sort of talk more about the Olympics, that of course as\nyou know is our focus. When you were at the University of Pittsburgh, were you\nuh aware of anti-Semitism?",
        "A: No. No. I wasn\u2019t aware of any, of any anti-Semitism while I was at the\nUniversity.",
        "Q: How much did you know about what was happening in Germany?",
        "A: No more than what was adver, no more than what was advertised in the, in the\npapers, you know. Uh we heard a lot about what Hitler, what Hitler was doing as\n6\n7\nfar as the, the Jewish people were concerned. And you know just before the\nOlympics, you know he\u2019s written a book Mein Kampf. I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t read it.\nUh the book that I did read was the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I read, I\nread that some years later. But when we went, cause when we went to the\nOlympics, we weren\u2019t interested, we weren\u2019t interested in politics. We were only\ninterested in going to Germany, participating in our events, and trying to win as\nmany gold medals or medal as we could win, see, and come home. That was the,\nthat was our interest. Cause see I was, I made the team when I was twenty. Uh\nand before I got to Berlin, Germany, I, I had a birthday and I was twenty-one\nwhen I actually won my gold medal. So we were young. All of us were young.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t know too terribly much about the situation in Germany or that\nHitler wasn\u2019t particularly fond of blacks either.",
        "A: No. No. Not at all. I know uh there was, there was one in, there was one\ninstance when we had a young German athlete come visit with us. And we were\nasking him, we were asking this young athlete, he spoke English fluently. And\nwe asked him uh what did the peep, what did the German people think of Hitler.\nWell they thought he was, they thought he was a great man. First of all his reason\nfor making that statement was the fact that the economic situation had improved\ntremendously under his regime, you see. Because what he did, he withdrew from\nthe League of Nations, as you know, started building up all this war armament,\nopened up all these factories to build all these weapons, and it made it possible for\na lot of Germans people to go to work. And that\u2019s why they thought that he, he\nwas, he was great for the country. But they didn\u2019t realize that they had a\nFrankenstein on their hands, you see. Because you know they attempted to\nassassinate him.",
        "Q: When you learned that you qualified to go to the Olympics, do you remember\nhow you felt?",
        "A: Well I was very, I was very happy and very elated I was able to make the team\nyou see. Course not realizing what the Olympic program was all about at that\ntime because everything came very fast to me, see. But when I, when I, when I\ncame, when my, when I came down to earth and realized what I had accomplished\nby making the team, then I was most elated.",
        "Q: You were representing the United States in a major international.",
        "A: United States. That\u2019s right. Um mmm.",
        "Q: That must have made you very proud.",
        "A: It did. It made all my family very proud. And all my friends.",
        "Q: Had you ever traveled so far before?\n7\n8",
        "A: No. the furtherest I ever, I, I never even traveled as far as Pittsburgh when I went\nto, went to the University and we, I stayed right, right there in that small town of\nConnellsville. And the furtherest I was away from home was when I went to\nPittsburgh to the University, which was 50, 51 miles away.",
        "Q: So tell me a little bit about your trip over. What it you know what it was like.",
        "A: It was very interesting.",
        "Q: And actually I need you to being by saying the trip over was very nice.",
        "A: The trip over was very, very interesting. Of course we sailed on the S.S.\nManhattan which was one of the better liners at that particular time. And, of\ncourse, they had wonderful facilities for us while we traveled by boat. It took us\neight days before we landed in Hamburg, Germany. Now some of us were pretty\ngood sailors and some of us weren\u2019t. Because with many, quite a, quite a, quite a\nnumber of the athletes got sick, seasick, cause the sea was pretty rough. But\nfortunately for me I was a pretty good sailor. I didn\u2019t get sick. So I was able to\nmake the trip and enjoy the food. Because once you get seasick you don\u2019t want\nno parts of food. But I was able to eat the food and enjoy it and enjoy the trip as a\nwhole.",
        "Q: Were there training facilities on board?",
        "A: Oh yes. They made it possible, they, they equipped that ship whereby all the\nathletes that were participating in the various activities to be able to train while\nthe ship was sailing. And of course with the, with the runners, you know, we did\na lot of jogging on the port, port side of the ship, you see. To keep, you know, try\nto keep in shape that way, see.",
        "Q: Now did you stick together with the runners primarily or did everybody get\nalong?",
        "A: Yes, well most of the runners pretty much stayed, stuck together. Now like the\nweight men, those who threw the discus and the shot put and the hammer, we\ndidn\u2019t socialize too much with them. But, of course, but the runners we all had,\nwe had more in common with them.",
        "Q: Did you have a room mate?",
        "A: I had a room mate, and my, my room mate uh in going over uh was uh, uh Mac\nRobinson, that was Jackie Robinson\u2019s brother. And of course he also roomed\nwith me in, in the Olympic village.",
        "Q: Was there any separation of black and while athletes on the ship?\n8\n9",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: So all of a sudden you\u2019ve left port and there\u2019s no segregation anymore.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Can you say something to that effect?",
        "A: Well that\u2019s, that was the way it was, that was the way everything was set up for us\nyou see. And it was. It was very good. It shouldn\u2019t have been any segregation\nbecause we were all a member of one team, the American team. We all had one\nobjective and there was, there should not have any segregation and there wasn\u2019t\nany segregation.",
        "Q: But wasn\u2019t this, this was a slightly different experience.",
        "A: Yes. That\u2019s true. It was a slightly different experience. But they, they, they had,\nthere was no segregation.",
        "Q: So you were on this boat for eight days?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And I assume this was a pretty exciting time for you.",
        "A: It was exciting. It was the first, first time I\u2019d ever taken, taken a boat anywhere.\nAnd, and a, and a, and above all, a luxury liner like that you see that was set up.\nCause that was the S.S. Manhattan was one of the, one of our big liners. It was\nthe S.S. Manhattan and S.S. Washington. The S.S. Washington brought the team,\nbrought the team members back. But the S.S. Manhattan took us, took us abroad\nyou see to Germany.",
        "Q: Were you pretty excited about competing at that point?",
        "A: Oh yes. Very excited. And of course I wanted to win. And that, that\u2019s all, that\nwas always my philosophy when I toed, when I toed the line on any race. My one\nobjective was to win. In fact throughout my collegiate career I think I won about\n90, 90 percent of every race I ever ran.",
        "Q: That\u2019s impressive. So the mood on the boat. What was the mood like?",
        "A: Friendly. Everybody was friendly. Everybody had a good time. Everybody\nenjoyed themselves. Even those who got seasick.\n9\n10",
        "Q: I want to hear about your arrival and everything, but I think we\u2019re going to change\ntapes first.\n(end Tape | Of 3)\n(Tape 2 of 3)\n(beep)",
        "Q: I want to backtrack for a minute. There was to my understanding at the time of,\nright prior to the \u00b036 Olympics, some effort to boycott the Olympics. How aware\nwere you of this?",
        "A: Not, no, I wasn\u2019t aware of too much about it. I heard a little bit about it. The boy\nuh the boycott, there was some, there was some talk about the Olympics being\nboycotted because of what Hitler was doing to the Jewish people in Germany.\nBut uh there was noth, nothing made, made too much of as far as the team\nmembers were concerned cause it was never discussed amongst, amongst the\nteam members. But we heard it and we heard something about it, but we never,\nwe never discussed it. As I said earlier, we weren\u2019t interested in politics you see\nat all. We were only interested in going to Germany and winning.",
        "Q: I want to ask you to say that again. The reason I\u2019m asking you is because I want\nyou to do the whole thing again without as I said earlier.",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "Q: And tell me a little bit was there talk of boycotting the Olympics?",
        "A: There was some talk. There was some talk about boycotting the Olympics, but it\nwasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t something that was a, a, a matter of conversation amongst the\nteam members you see. We didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t uh go into any detail on it. So uh\nwe didn\u2019t bother, we didn\u2019t concern ourselves too much about it. All we knew\nthat we were we\u2019d made the team, we were, we were on the boat, and we were\ngoing to Germany. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s all we were interested in.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t interested in the political situation?",
        "A: No. Not at all.",
        "Q: But prior to your going over, were there articles in the newspapers, was there any\nconversation in the black community or in the black press about going or not\ngoing to the Olympics?\n10\n11",
        "A: No. Not that I know of. In fact I, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t recall of ever reading anything\nuh in the, in the newspapers, the black press or the white press concerning going\nas, as far as the matter of going to the Olympics was concerned.",
        "Q: So there wasn\u2019t much of a movement in the States before you went?",
        "A: Not at all. Not to my knowledge anyhow.",
        "Q: Now. Back to the boat. You arrived in Hamburg, yes?",
        "A: Hamburg, Germany. That\u2019s where the ship uh docked. And then we took a train\nfrom there to Berlin.",
        "Q: What was the arrival in Hamburg like?",
        "A: It was, it was very, it was pretty exciting. You know, the, the, the,",
        "Q: Can you start by saying, when we arrived?",
        "A: When we, when we arrived in Hamburg, it was, it was pretty, pretty exciting\nevent for us, you know. It was a lot of people out there to, to welcome us to\nGermany at that particular time. And then and of course we appreciated, we\nappreciated the welcome that they were, they\u2019re showing us at that time you see.",
        "Q: Who were those people?",
        "A: German people. German people. They were out to welcome us, welcome the\nAmerican team to uh, to uh, to Germany. They knew, they knew where we were\ngoing to go. And they, and they, they knew the reason why we were there.",
        "Q: Were they average citizens? Was it organized?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether it was organized or not. We just saw, we just saw a lot, lot\nof people you know, cheering us and what have you, when we, when we docked\nin, in Hamburg.",
        "Q: Did they have flags, was there music?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall really. I don\u2019t recall. All, all I saw was a lot of people and a lot of\nwaving of the hands and what have you, see.",
        "Q: You felt pretty good? And then how did you get to Berlin?",
        "A: By train. By train. We went to Berlin by train. After we docked in Hamburg uh\nthey put us all on a train, all the American team members on a train, and we went\nto Berlin to the Olympic village.\n11\n12",
        "Q: Were you welcomed there?",
        "A: We were welcomed at the Olympic village and, of course, they assigned, they\nassigned us, assigned quarters for all of the team members. They had little huts\nthat we, that we lived in, see. And, of course, there was uh two, two men or two\nathletes per, per hut. And, of course, I roomed with uh Mac Robinson while we\nwere, while we were in, in the Olympic village. That was Jackie Robinson\u2019s\nbrother.",
        "Q: What was life like in the Olympic village?",
        "A: It was very pleasant. Very, in, in the Olympic village it was very, very pleasant.\nThe accommodations were very good. The food was very good. And uh the, the\ncooks from the S.S. Brahman, that was the German\u2019s uh luxury liner, those cooks\nwere the cooked the food for the American team, and they did a fine job.",
        "Q: Were there activities, were, was there a lot of camaraderie amongst the athletes?\nTell me a little bit about what it was like spending time there.",
        "A: Well, there was a lot of camaraderie amongst the American team members you\nsee. We do, we, of course, we socialize, you know, visiting one another, visiting\neach, each hut you know. Talking about what we hoped to do at the, at the\ngames. That sort of conversation. But that was about it you see. Cause you\nknow there was nothing else you know that we could do you know under the\ncircumstances because there was a certain amount of discipline that was exercised\nto make sure that uh that the team members did what they were supposed to do in\npreparation for their activities, their athletic ac, athletic activities.",
        "Q: A lot of training?",
        "A: Yes we trained. They had training facilities there whereby we, we trained in\npreparation for, for our race you see. And, and they had a track there that we\ncould that, that we could run on in, in order to keep us, keep us in shape, cause\nyou know I guess a, a lot of us got out of shape you know based on particularly\nthose who got sick, you see, and they had to work pretty hard, had to get through\ntheir land legs back again see. So it, it was, they had, they had to do quite a bit of\ntraining to kind of get themself together you know for their races you know.",
        "Q: Were the training facilities separated by nationality?",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: So on the track there were.\n12\n13",
        "A: There were all, all, all nationalities who participated on the same track. Cause\nthey only had one, one facility for us, you see.",
        "Q: And you\u2019d mentioned that it was important to maintain a discipline. Were there\nrules that you remember? Certain things that you were told?",
        "A: Well uh they, they weren\u2019t spelled out, you know, rule one, rule two, rule three,\nand rule four. It was nothing like that. We as athletes knew that we had a certain,\ncertain responsibility to maintain ourselves to the best of our abilities so that we\nwould be prepared for our, for our races, you see. And we took that, we took that\nresponsibility on our own, you see. And uh but we, we knew that was it was\nunderstood that that was how we had to react or conduct ourselves.",
        "Q: Now I understand this Olympic village they created was really very, very pretty.\nCan you tell me a little bit more about what it looked like there?",
        "A: Looked like a, like a beautiful college campus. Beautiful grass, laid out very,\nvery well. I, I took some very nice pictures of that Olympic village which I have\nat home. Uh because I had, I owned, I had a little old box camera and I took some\npictures of the village. But it was very, very nice. A beautiful place. It was a\nbeautiful place.",
        "Q: Did you notice any discrimination once you arrived in Germany?",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t notice any. After I. No, I did not no, I did not notice any\ndiscrimination when I arrived in Germany. After \u2019'd won my race, won my gold\nmedal, I went downtown Berlin doing a little sightseeing of the city, and the\npeople, the German people were very, very cordial. They just crowded around\nyou for autographs. Very friendly. There was nothing, I, I didn\u2019t notice anything\nnegative at all the whole time that I participated in those 1936 Olympic games as\nfar as we were concerned. Now you\u2019ve probably heard some stories about Hitler\nuh refusing to shake, shake Jesse Owen\u2019s hand. Well that\u2019s, those stories were\nwrong. They were wrong. One time Hitler invited some of the athletes up in his,\nup in, up in his uh the sections that they had established for him and his\nlieutenants. Uh Helen Stevens who won the hundred meters for the women, the\nAmerica for the, she was on the women\u2019s team. She and her coach were invited\nup that one particular time. And of course the, the American coaches spoke to\nHitler about that. And informed him that if he wasn\u2019t going to invite all the\nathletes up there then he, then they wanted him not to do that uh with any, any\nother athletes. And at the time that he invited these athletes up there, Jesse Owens\nwas still competing on the track. So therefore he could not have gone up there at\nthat particular time.",
        "Q: So it was decided that he wasn\u2019t going to shake anyone\u2019s hand.\n13\n14",
        "A: That\u2019s right. The American, the American coaches told him not to do that\nbecause he was see if he was going to discriminate, and only have, only have\ncertain athletes come up there, then uh they, they, they, they uh they, they said\nthey didn\u2019t want him to do that.",
        "Q: So what was Hitler\u2019s decision on this?",
        "A: Well he, he, he, he didn\u2019t have no athletes come up there for the rest of the games.",
        "Q: Were you aware while you were over there, you said you personally didn\u2019t face\nany discrimination, but were you aware of anti-Semitism?",
        "A: No. Not at all. As I said he must have, he opened up, he must have declared the\nmoratorium for the games because the things that perhaps he had been doing prior\nto the games, nothing like that took place during the games, you see. And of\ncourse after the games you know what happened, you see.",
        "Q: There were no traces? Now did you and you spent time leaving the Olympic\nvillage and the stadium and you just saw nothing?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s, we didn\u2019t see anything that was, that was out of line or that\nwas negative.",
        "Q: Do you remember much about this Glickman-Stoller controversy?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we heard the story. You see Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller were the\ntwo Jewish boys, extra boys that was, that was selected or qualified to run on the\nrelay team. That was the four by one hundred relay team. When we, I don\u2019t\nknow, none of us knew who made the decision as to keep those fellows off that\nteam. Jesse Owens wanted to give up his position on the team. And I\u2019m sure that\nRalph Metcalfe probably would have given his position up, to give Sam Stoller\nand Marty Glickman a chance to run, but the coaches of the American team\ndecided they wanted Jesse and, and Ralph Metcalfe to run on that team. And so\nthey, so they didn\u2019t select Sam Stoller or Marty Glickman to run. And they still\nwould have won the, they still would have won the race cause they were both very\nfine, very fine runners, very fine sprinters. But who made the, who made the final\ndecision? Whether it was Lawrence Robertson, whether Hitler had something,\nsomething to say about it, we don\u2019t know. We discussed it many, many times, but\nwe never did know who made that decision to keep those two fellows from\nrunning on that team. And to this day, Marty Glickman is very, very bitter about\nit, you see, cause I knew Marty Glickman very well see.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you and some of the other athletes felt when this took\nplace?\n14\n15",
        "A: We felt, we felt that they, we felt that they should have been given the opportunity\nto participate, an opportunity to win a gold medal and which they would have\nwon a gold medal. They still would have won that relay team, regardless whether\nJesse Owens or Ralph Metcalfe was on it or not. They still would have won. But\nthey didn\u2019t give those boys a chance. And that\u2019s why Marty today, to this day, is\nvery bitter about that, about that decision.",
        "Q: Describe what it was like being at the games when you weren\u2019t running. Uh the\nmood, the pageantry, did you see Hitler regularly?",
        "A: Well everything, we saw Hitler every day when he came out to the games, but\nyou see, he was so far away just like myself, uh sitting in the, in the stand, he was\ntoo far away for us to even see, see the image of him, see. We knew he was there.\nWe knew each time he came into the game because you know the German people\nyou know, you know, naturally would create a commotion when he, when he\nentered the stadium, when he entered the stadium. But me personally, he was too\nfar away from me to make out just, just what he looked like other than from, from\nthose pictures that I\u2019ve seen some, seen of him see.",
        "Q: Try to paint for me a picture of what it was like at the games, what it felt like,\nwhat it looked like, because I didn\u2019t have that option?",
        "A: Well at the games, at those particular games in 1936, they were a very fine set of\ngames. That was my first experience you see. That was my first experience of,\nof, of being in the Olympic games. It was very, very exciting. The events were\nrun off with precision, the athletes didn\u2019t have to wait around when their event\nwas called, the starter started, started your event. You knew the Germans, you\nknew they\u2019re, they\u2019re a stick, they\u2019re a stickler for things being done just right.\nAnd that\u2019s the way they, that\u2019s the way they ran the games. Because in talking\nwith some of the old timers who had followed the Olympic games prior to the\n1936 games that, that I participated in, they said they that the Berlin games were\nthe finest Olympic games that they\u2019d ever witnessed. That was the, that was the\nstatement they made.",
        "Q: Was there a lot of fanfare?",
        "A: There was a lot, there was a lot of fanfare. There was a lot of fanfare. A lot of\nexcitement. Lot of excitement.",
        "Q: Were there flags, parades, music. I mean, I\u2019m trying to get, I\u2019m trying to imagine\nwhat it was like being there.",
        "A: Well, the flags, the only flags that, that was, that took place was when after the\nathlete\u2019s completed their event. Now, when the American, when the Americans\nwon, the American flags went up. And of course, it was, if it was a foreign\ncountry that was part of, part of the race, took third or second, whichever the case\n15\n16\nmay be, or even first, their, the flags representing their nations went up. Those\nare the only flags that were waving. And of course in the, in the uh bleachers,\nsome of the, some of the uh spectators were waving flags. Some of the\nAmericans were waving little flags you see, showing their, their enthusiasm for,\nfor their, for their countrymen winning or the country women winning. That was\nthe type of fanfare that you saw during the games.",
        "Q: A lot of cheering.",
        "A: A lot of cheering. That\u2019s, that\u2019s always the case you see. They do a lot of\ncheering. Although from my experience, you know, the athletes never hear it\nthough. They never hear what\u2019s going on. Cause they\u2019re concentrating on what\nthey\u2019re doing. They\u2019re concentrating on that race. So they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t hear\nthe cheering. They don\u2019t even hear what people say.",
        "Q: Swastikas?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see any of that. Didn\u2019t see any of that at all. Didn\u2019t see any of that at all.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your race and how you were feeling.",
        "A: Well I had to run three races. I had to run the preliminaries and the semi-finals\nand the finals. The preliminary race, the preliminaries and the, and the semi-final\nrace. When the race was, when the race was started I got right out in front and I\nstayed out there and won the race on, on both of those two races. On the final\nrace, I decided well I\u2019m going to try to exercise a little strategy to make sure that I\nwould win the race uh by laying back in second position, and then, of course, in\nthe waiting until I hit the last three hundred meters and then starting my kick to\ntry to win the race. But the fellow, Phil Edwards, from Canada, he set a very, very\nslow pace. And, of course, he set that pace and, and we, we ran that way for four\nhundred meters, that\u2019s half the race. When we hit the first turn of the last, the last\nhalf of the race or the last four hundred meters, the contestants or my opponents\ncrowded right around me. I got boxed in. And the only way I could get out of\nthat box was to stop. Now if I attempted to breakthrough, I would have fouled\nsomebody and I\u2019d have been disqualified. But I had enough sense to know that I\ncouldn\u2019t do that. So I stopped. So I let the, let, let my opponents proceed in front,\nahead of me. I ran out into the third lane and I then I ran around the field and won\nthe race. In fact I ran more than eight hundred meters when I won that race\nbecause I was running way out in the third lane see. But I won it. That was the\nmost important thing. And of course the old timers just said they never in the\nhistory of the, of the, of the Olympics had ever seen a race won the way I ran\nmine. And you see, first of all, whenever you uh stop and you break your stride,\nyou break your rhythm, that u, that usually finishes you. But I was able to pick up\neven though I started the race twice and, and, and still won.",
        "Q: What drove you? What drove you?\n16\n17",
        "A: Determine, determination. My only objective at any time I got into a race was to\nwin. And that\u2019s what I did.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what it takes?",
        "A: That\u2019s what it takes. Determination. Lot of fire in the stomach as they say.",
        "Q: Were you winning for you, for your country, for",
        "A: I was winning for me and I was winning for the country. Me first, then the\ncountry.",
        "Q: When you said you won, you were very casual about this. This is a pretty\nmomentous occasion. I don\u2019t think you probably felt that casually.",
        "A: Well, it, it was a momentous occasion. But I didn\u2019t realize how important it was\nuntil it was all over with because everything happened so fast, just like I made the\nOlympic team very fast. Didn\u2019t know that I was going to be on the Olympic\nteam, didn\u2019t know I was going to be even try out for the Olympic team. Then\ngoing to Germany and winning it. But I didn\u2019t realize just what achievement that\nI had accomplished until it was all over to receive my medal. Uh we weren\u2019t, we\nweren\u2019t instructed as to how we were to salute you see. So at one, one point I, I, I\nsaid well should I give a Nazi salute, should I give a, or should I give an\nAmerican salute. But I was very real confused, but nevertheless I finally ended\nup giving the American salute. Cause I was nervous, very nervous and very\nconfused. I was a young, young man, and of course we weren\u2019t given any\ninstructions on that you see.",
        "Q: When you win a medal, what\u2019s the process here. What happens? You win the\nrace, everyone\u2019s cheering.",
        "A: All right. When you\u2019re up on the stand and they\u2019re playing the Star Spangled\nBanner for all the Americans and of course they played the Star Spangled Banner\nfor me winning my race, you see. Then they had young girls that came over. And\nthe girls presented the medal. They presented the medal. And somewhere,\nsomewhere, somewhere later they presented an oak, a little oak tree, which I\nbrought back home and that oak tree it was about 18, about 18 inches uh in height.\nI brought it back and then I had to send it to the Department of Agriculture here in\nWashington cause they had to check the dirt around it for any kind of bugs that\nwas being brought in. So when they, when it was sent back to Connellsville, my\nhome town, the tree was almost dead. So I turned the tree over to the Botany\nteacher of my high school and he worked with the tree and brought it back, and\nthey planted it on the library at, at, at the Carnegie Library in the home town.\nAnd then of course, they, they replanted 1t when they built the stadium, the Falcon\nStadium is the name of it. And that tree is now six feet tall. And a lot of the\n17\n18\nacorns from that tree is being planted around different places around the United\nStates, from, from my tree.",
        "Q: So you went to the stands, somebody escorted you to the stands.",
        "A: Yes. Well, you know, you know, they showed you where, where you had to go in\norder to uh receive your, receive your, your medal see. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s what,\nthat\u2019s what they did you see. See, I, I, I, I, I won first. Uh Maria Lansey from\nItaly was second. I forget the third man who, who, who uh, no Phil Edwards, Phil\nEdwards from Canada, he was third. He was third. Now the two runners, two,\ntwo other, two other American runners, Charles Hornsbarsel from University of\nIndiana or Indiana University and Harry Williamson from North Carolina\nUniversity, they came in, they came in fourth and, and fifth. They didn\u2019t, they\ndidn\u2019t uh they didn\u2019t get a medal see. Cause they only give medals for the first\nthree places.",
        "Q: So what was it like standing in front of a hundred thousand people accepting this\nhonor?",
        "A: Very, it was, it was a very, very exciting experience. As I said, I was, I was very\nnervous. I was very nervous. Everybody clapping their hands and cheering etc.\nIt was nervous for a young man twenty-one years old, had never been so far away\nfrom home.",
        "Q: The Americans really cleaned up in these events didn\u2019t they?",
        "A: Yes. We did very well. We did very well.",
        "Q: Was there any irony or satisfaction to having won this, won this race as a black\nAmerican, gotten all of this prestige and honor for your country that didn\u2019t always\ntreat you so well?",
        "A: Well, of course we were a victim, being, myself personally, we were a victim of\ndiscrimination in, in, in, in the country of America for all those many years cause\nI'd only lived in the world for twenty-one years at that particular time. And we\nunderstood that. We didn\u2019t like it. We never do. We never did like it and we\nnever will like it. We still have racism in this country. This country is still full of\nracism as far as, as the black man is concerned. Things are better than they used\nto be. Much better. Economically speaking, blacks are getting better jobs than\nthey got back in those days. They\u2019re able to go to any, any, any, any university in\nthe country. Cause back in those days you couldn\u2019t go, you couldn\u2019t go, you\ncouldn\u2019t go to University of Georgia or University of Mississippi and what you\nhave back in those, back in those times. You couldn\u2019t go to the Naval Academy\nback in those times. Well, get to tell you a little experience in that, in that regard.\nWe had a track meet to run at Annapolis, at the Naval Academy. Now here I am\nan Olympic champion and they told my coach that I couldn\u2019t run. I couldn\u2019t\n18\n19\ncome. So I had to stay home because of discrimination. Now that wasn\u2019t hap,\nthat wasn\u2019t the situation at West Point. I ran at West point when I was going to\nthe University of Pittsburgh, but I couldn\u2019t run at, at Annapolis. But things are\nbetter now.",
        "Q: I just want to get back to being in Germany, having lived through this and\nwinning this medal for your country.",
        "A: Now what was the question?",
        "A: Well actually we\u2019ve only got a minute left on the tape. So maybe I\u2019m going to\nstop and start again.\n(end Tape 2 of 30\n(Tape 3 of 3)",
        "Q: You\u2019re going to be of hundreds of athletes and that made no difference. That\nmust have been a good feeling. That sort of inclusiveness.\n(get a little mark)\n(We need to hear your voice again)",
        "A: You want to hear my voice again.\n(Beep)",
        "Q: I was asking you if there was any sort of special feeling or pride in being a black\nAmerican winning the gold medal in Berlin?",
        "A: There was definitely a special feeling in winning the gold medal and being a, a\nblack man because here I, here I was doing something and particularly, this\nparticular event had not been won by an American in 24 years. So and it, that was\nwon by a white man, not a black man. So I was very proud of that, of that fact,\nvery proud of that achievement, and I was very happy for myself as an individual,\nfor my race, and for my country.",
        "Q: You had started to mention something about auxiliaries. What\u2019s that about?",
        "A: Well after the Olympics were over, I think it came at, I think it was published, it\nmust have been published in the Ger, in, in, in the German publication, the\nGerman newspapers, that Hitler made the remark that if 1t wasn\u2019t for the black\nauxiliary the American would not have won the Olympics. That\u2019s what I, that\u2019s\nwhat I hear. I didn\u2019t read it, but I heard, heard that that was the remark that he\nmade, you see.\n19\n20",
        "Q: How did that make you feel?",
        "A: Well it, it made me, it made me feel good because what we did, we destroyed his\nmaster race theory. That\u2019s what, it made me feel very good. Cause you know he\nuh he had that master race theory that you know the, the superior race, that only,\nonly, only the pure Germans could do certain things in this world. That was what\nhe was advocating. But we destroyed his theory whenever we started winning\nthose gold medals.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your return home as an Olympic hero. How were you\nreceived and where did you come first?",
        "A: We came to New York and they had a big parade for us. After the Olympics we\ncame home, we came home on the S.S. Washington. Now, of course, Jesse\nOwens came home ahead of us because he, he didn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t do any running\nafter the Olympics outside of Dresden, Germany. One week after the Olympic\ngames, Jesse ran in Dresden, Germany, and of course he was defeated by Ralph\nMetcalfe who took second to him in the Olympic games in Berlin. But he had\nsome offers that was made, some professional offers, and of course he came back\non the, on the, on the, on the Queen Mary to take advantage of those offers cause\nJesse came from a poor family too. Most of the blacks came from poor families\nyou see. None of, none of us came from any wealthy homes, or middle class\nhomes. Most all from poor families. But many of those offers didn\u2019t pan out for\nhim at all. And of course they, due to the fact, you see he was scheduled to run\nin, in, In various countries. He didn\u2019t run so they declared him, they declared him\nas a professional. So Jesse, his amateur days were over with after that see. But I\nran after the Olympic games. I ran in White City Stadium in London. Then from\nthere I ran up in Oslo, Norway, before coming home. But we all, we all ended up\nin, in New York and they had a big ticker tape parade for us in, in uh Manhattan\nup, up Fifth Avenue. And there was a lot of cheering and if course Mayor\nLaGuardia who was the Mayor of the city at the time uh gave us, gave us a, a\nmedal uh from the City of New York. And then from there we all departed New\nYork City and we went to our various homes. And, of course, when I got back to\nConnellsville, Pennsylvania, they had a big parade for me in my, in my home\ntown. And which, which was the biggest parade that ev, that ever turned out for\nanybody in that small town.",
        "Q: That must have felt fabulous.",
        "A: It was, it was, it was. I was, it was, it was a fabulous time, a fabulous occasion,\nand a happy time for me and for my family and for all my friends back there in\nConnellsville.",
        "Q: How long did the euphoria last?\n20\n21",
        "A: Well it lasted for quite a, quite a long time, you know, because you know I used to\ngo out and, and do a lot of speaking to the young uh run uh kids after the Olympic\ngames and, of course, I was still in school and I was still, still making records as\nan athlete because I won every major med, won every major er uh track meet in\nthe country at that particular time. Right up until, right up until I stopped running\nin 1940.",
        "Q: Did winning the Olympics open doors for you that wouldn\u2019t have been opened\notherwise?",
        "A: Some, some doors. Some doors, cause I, I never, you know, I, I was never made,\nI never made any uh never uh received any fabulous offers in terms of uh making\nany money because see first of all I was still in school and I had three years. I had\nthree years to go to get my degree. And when I was graduated. Right after I was\ngraduated from the University of Pittsburgh, then I went to New York University\nand uh while I was in graduate school, I got a job at John Wannamaker\u2019s running\nthe elevator. And of course you know there was quite a lot of publicity came out\nabout an Olympic champion getting a job running an elevator. And the only thing\nthat John Wannamaker wanted to do was give me a permanent job running an\nelevator. That was all. Then I got a job as a social investigator for the city of\nNew York, working with disadvantaged people who were on welfare. Then I,\nthen I got a job working, working for the uh police Athletic League, director of\none of their centers up in, up in Harlem, New York, working with disadvantaged\nkids. And while I was working in that job, I took examination for State Parole\nOfficer for the State of New York and I became a parole officer, supervising\nparolees who were released from the New York State Reformatory, reformatories\nor state prisons. Then from that I worked for a short period of time with Shefland\nand Company uh advertising alcoholic beverages. I didn\u2019t particularly care for\nthat cause I couldn\u2019t see myself making, making a permanent job pushing booze.\nSo I got out of that. Then I got a job as special inves, uh, uh insurance agent for\nthe Prudential Insurance Company. I worked a while in that job. Then I ended up\nmy career with the Job Corps Program. You know about the Job Corps program.\nAgain working with disadvantaged kids. I never made a lot of money, but I made\na living. But my, but my, the compensation that I got from the work that I did\nwas helping people. And I helped a lot of people, a lot of people.",
        "Q: Did the, being an Olympic winner open doors in other ways?",
        "A: Well not uh not, not, not to my experience, not from my experience.",
        "Q: ...get you access to places that you weren\u2019t able to go into before?",
        "A: I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t recall just looking back on, on, on my early, early career after\nwinning the Olympics that 1t opened any particular doors, being a gold medal\nwinner.\n21\n22",
        "Q: Did you expect it to?",
        "A: Well I expected that I had hope. Nut noth, nothing materialized in, in that regard.\nNow I\u2019m sure many of the white Olympians were made offers, very fine offers,\nbut I can\u2019t recall any of the black Olympians making any, any, making any great\noffers. Now Jesse did pretty well. He got in public relations work, but when he\nfirst came back from the Olympic games, he, he, he, he, he found it very difficult\nto get any decent, any decent work. He came back. He ran against race horses.\nYou may have heard of, heard of him running against race horse. He did a\nnumber of things in order to track, try to make a living for his family. But only in\nlater years he, he uh he started a public relation organization there in Chicago, and\nhe did a lot of uh did a lot of he was on a lot of speaking engagements. And he\npicked up quite a bit of money doing that. But uh he didn\u2019t have any, any, any\nbig jobs. He never had any real, any real big jobs, you know.",
        "Q: What I was trying to get at here is it seems that after all of the excitement of\nwinning this medal, winning this race, coming back to all kinds of parades, how\nlong did it kind of take to come back to earth and realize that things hadn\u2019t\nchanged much? Were there any moments that kind of showed you that clearly?",
        "A: Yes. When I came back, when I came back to the University of Pittsburgh, they\ndidn\u2019t want, they didn\u2019t want to let me into the English class because I was a\nmonth late. And of course I guess the chancellor straightened that matter out.\nThen when I, one, one day I went downtown Pittsburgh, and one evening, to\nChild\u2019s restaurant. They refused to serve me. That was, that was one instance.\nThen when I was graduated and they had the uh University Hall of Fame, here I\u2019d\nbrought international, international recognition to the school. The All American\nfootball players like Marshall Goldberg, they brought national recognition to the\nschool. They made the Hall of Fame, but I didn\u2019t make it. In spite of the gold\nmedal that I\u2019d won and bringing the school international recognition. So that, that\nlet me know just what the situation was. Things hadn\u2019t changed. But I was\nyoung and, of course, as years went on, things got better. And uh and to date\nthings have gotten much better for the blacks. But we still have a long way to go.",
        "Q: Ask you a little bit about what was going on, what was unfolding in Germany and\nin Europe. When after the Olympics did you become more aware of what was\ngoing on and you know how did you find out?",
        "A: Well, I personally became a, aware of what was going on based on, based on the,\non the publications on, on what was, what was uh printed in, in the various\nnewspapers and, and, and, and magazines of, of what was happening in Germany.\nOf course right after the Olympics, in 1039, Hitler started World War II when he\nmarched on Czechoslovakia, that was the beginning of World War II. And of\ncourse we all knew what happened after that.\n22\n23",
        "Q: How did you get that information. How did you start learning more. Is that the\npoint at which you became more aware of the atrocities and",
        "A: Yes, my, become aware of those atrocities and things from what, from what was\nprinted in the, in the, in the, in the newspaper. Newspapers through, you know,\nthroughout, throughout the United States.",
        "Q: After having this glorious week in Berlin was this hard to believe?",
        "A: Yes it was very hard to believe. It was very hard to believe. But we knew what\nwas going on based on the publicity prior to the Olympic games, what Hitler was\ndoing. And as I said he declared a moratorium, opened up everything, made\neverything very pleasant, very accommodating for, for the visiting uh, uh\nOlympic team nations. But after the Olympics they went right back to the, to the\nthings he had planned. And, of course, all these things he had planned was laid\nout in his book, Mein Kampf.",
        "Q: So the Olympics were really a propaganda coup.",
        "A: It was. He made it so. He made it a propaganda coup to further, to further his\ncause, to further his program that he had set up.",
        "Q: When you started learning more about all the horrible things that were happening,\ndid you think about the Olympics in context of politics at all or were you just still\nfeeling the same way you did at age 21?",
        "A: Well, I would think it was pretty much the latter, pretty much the latter. Cause\nwe\u2019d had some background on what was going on prior to the games, and of\ncourse it was brought out more pointedly after the games. See when after the\ngames were over then Hitler continued with his program, you see. Marching on\nCzechoslovakia and starting, starting the war. And of course it was something\nthat uh we more or less expected. We more or less expected. You know uh the\nworld didn\u2019t think Hitler was doing what he was doing. You see they should have\nknown what he was doing. You know, Germany was part of the League of\nNations, like all the nations were, were part of that League. And the, the reason\nthat they set that league up as you know from history was to more or less keep a\ntab on each nation in terms of them building up war armaments to start a war.\nNow Hitler withdrew from the League of Nations. They should have known then\nwhat he was going to do. But they didn\u2019t believe him. They didn\u2019t believe him.\nThey didn\u2019t believe what he had printed in that book, Mein Kampf. Winston\nChurchill, the Prime Minister of England, called him the little Corporal. They\ndown played Hitler. They didn\u2019t believe, believe what he was about to do. So\ntherefore they, they didn\u2019t put a curb on him see. They probably could have\nstopped World War II if they had done so at that time. When he withdrew from\nthe League of Nations, if they\u2019d of put a clamp, put a clamp on him at that\n23\n24\nparticular time, there probably would have been no World War hh. But they didn\u2019t\ndo it.",
        "Q: Do you think if we had believed what was going to happen and had exercised a\nboycott, it would have made any difference?",
        "A: Exercised a boycott of the Olympics?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether it would have made any difference or not. I really don\u2019t. I,\nI can\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t , I can\u2019t answer that question.",
        "Q: In retrospect, cause I know how you felt at the time, learning how bad things\nbecame, do you think we should have participated in the Olympics?",
        "A: Well in retrospect, based, based on all the training that the athletes had gone\nthrough in preparing for the Olympic games, I feel, I felt that they should have\nhad, they should have gone on with the Olympics as they did. Because I think\nthat would, that would have been a very bad thing to have taken place. Uh but it\nwould been, it would have been very hurting for the athletes who had made so\nmuch preparation, who had trained so long over the years. Fortunately for me I\ndidn\u2019t train like that. I was more or less a gifted athlete. I came up very fast. But\nthere was other athletes who had trained for the Olympics who had trained for\nyears to prepare for the games, and that would have been very, very bad if they\ncould not have gone. That\u2019s my, that\u2019s my feeling, personal feeling. Now there\nmight, there might be others who felt who would feel differently about it based on\nthe question you just posed to me, but that\u2019s my feeling.",
        "Q: That the Olympics and politics should stay separate.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s take a break.",
        "Q: There are a couple of specific questions I want to ask you. You had mentioned\none incident where you had contact with a German athlete at the Olympic village.\nDid you have other contact with German athletes?",
        "A: That was the only one. I remember this young man that came in. He was young\nlike we were and uh he came and visited with us, you see. And of course when\nwe heard all this uh this information about Hitler and naturally we posed a\nquestion. What did they think, what did the German people think of Hitler. And\nhe said they, he said they thought he was a, a very good man because of what he\u2019d\ndone for the country economically speaking, made it possible for all of them to\nwork and of course you know all of them were working in the, in the, in these\n24\n25\nfactories where they were making weapons. And that\u2019s why they felt, cause right\nafter World War I, you know, the Germans they really were beat down. They\nwere, they were in a bad way. And I guess they, they were, they were, they were\nlooking, they were looking for a savior. And that\u2019s when Hitler came into, came\ninto play. They were looking for somebody to pull them out of those doldrums\nthat they were in, you see. And of course when he withdrew from the League of\nNations, started building all, all this, all this war armament, putting all these\nGerman people to work, he was a great guy as far as they were concerned. But\nthey didn\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t know the whole story.",
        "Q: Did you have contact with other international athletes?",
        "A: No. No. No.",
        "Q: Was there much of a bond, camaraderie that should have lasted with the other\nathletes after the Olympics?",
        "A: With other athletes from, from other teams.",
        "Q: From here.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yeah there was quite a, quite a, quite a bond, you know. We be, we\nbecame very, very close friends and we (words missing in original transcript).\nThe other athletes on the team were very close. I was very close to them. I\u2019m\nstill very close to some of them that are, that are still around. I still make contact\nwith them, you see. And uh, but of course, many of them are gone, many of them\nhave passed. And as I said I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s left now see. Archie Williams\nwho won the 400 meters, he died about three years ago. And he was the last of\nthe gold medal winners, other than myself, that were still living.",
        "Q: So there was really a special bond?",
        "A: Oh yes. Stronger than a fraternity. Stronger, much stronger than a fraternity\nbecause of what we go through in training and what have you, the pain, feeling of\npain when we\u2019re training, the feeling of pain when we, when we race. That, that,\nthat gives us a lot of strength and a lot of. It\u2019s something that we have in common\nwith each other. And something that we understand. You see one athlete\nunderstands another athlete and what he has to go through. If he\u2019s a football\nplayer, a football player understands what another football player has to go\nthrough. And that\u2019s the same way with in track and field.",
        "Q: When did you become friendly with Marty Glickman?",
        "A: We lived in the same neighborhood up in New Rochelle, New York. His family\nand my family live in the same neighborhood.\n25\n26",
        "Q: But you met at the Olympics?",
        "A: We met at the Olympics. Marty Glickman and I met in the Olympics as part of\nthe team. I didn\u2019t know him before that, but I knew him after that, after the\nOlympics where he resided in New Rochelle and where I resided with my family\nin New Rochelle, New York.",
        "Q: Do you remember him at the Olympics?",
        "A: I used to see him on occasion, because he was a sprinter. And I used to see Sam\nStoller also. Incidentally Sam Stoller, is Sam Stoller dead?",
        "Q: From your memory of 1936, what kind of guy was Marty Glickman?",
        "A: A nice fellow. Very nice fellow. Very friendly, as all the athletes that were on\nthe team were all very friendly, all very cordial, all very accommodating. Which\nis like one big happy family.\nQ; Was there anything that set him apart in your mind/",
        "A: No. No. He was just another, he was just another athlete like all the rest of them\nthat were over there to win, win a gold medal and I was very, very sorry that he\ndidn\u2019t get that opportunity to do so.",
        "Q: Did you go to the closing ceremonies?\nA; The closing ceremonies at the, at the, the closing ceremonies at Berlin? Yes.\nYes.",
        "Q: Tell me.",
        "A: It was very, very exciting. The closing ceremonies were very, very exciting\nbecause I, because I witnessed the closing ceremonies on the, on the other, other\nOlympic games that I attended. But, but this one was, was much more important\nbecause I was part of it. And they put on quite a show. Quite a show.",
        "Q: Tell me about it.",
        "A: Well the closing, well they uh had the, had the, had the, had the athletes. Of\ncourse one thing about the closing ceremonies. The closing ceremonies are not as\nexciting as the opening ceremonies because a lot of the athletes after competing\ngo home. So not the whole team, the whole team is never there at the closing\nceremonies. So therefore uh it, it\u2019s not quite as exciting as the opening\nceremonies when they march in, each country with their flag and of course with\nthe Olympic flag preceding all, preceding everything, you see. The five ring\n26\n27\nOlympic flag. But uh it\u2019s not, as I said, it\u2019s not as exciting, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s still\nexciting for those who participated in the closing ceremonies.",
        "Q: What did it look like?",
        "A: Well it looked like uh a closing ceremony. That\u2019s all I can say. I don\u2019t know\nwhat you\u2019re",
        "Q: I\u2019ve never been to one. I don\u2019t even know what the opening ceremonies look like.",
        "A: Well the opening ceremony\u2019s when all these various nations, all these, all these uh\nOlympic athletes representing all these var, various nations march in. The host,\nthe host, the host country athletes march in last. It\u2019s all set up you know, it\u2019s all\nset, it\u2019s all organized. And, of course, all these countries, it\u2019s, it\u2019s preceded by the\nOlympic flag, the five ring flag. And of course right after they march in and the\ngames are, are declared open, they have pigeons. And they release all these\npigeons and they all fly, and that\u2019s the opening of the games. It\u2019s beautiful.",
        "Q: You were on the field at that time?",
        "A: On the field. As part of the American team. We came in with our white trousers,\nblue jackets and straw hats, with a red, red, white and blue band. White shirt and,\nand I forget what our tie, I think our tie was, I think our tie was, I think our tie\nwas white if I recall. We just, it\u2019s been a little while. But I remember, I\nremember, I remember the hat. I remember the jacket and I remember the\ntrousers. And of course white shoes.",
        "Q: How were you feeling marching across there?",
        "A: Oh, felt good, felt good. You know you always, always felt good marching in a\nparade. Always did. It, it, it, it kind of does something to you.",
        "Q: It must have been great.\nQ; It was. It was.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you remember about sort of what the stadium looked\nlike, what the track was like? Was it similar to other tracks that you had\ncompeted on?\nA; It was a very beautiful track, very fine track. It was made with some kind of red\nuh red dirt, red cinders or something. It was different. It was very different than,\nthan, than the tracks here in America at that particular time. And when I was over\nthere for the 50\" anniversary and I got a chance to, to visit the track again, that\ntrack was still in excellent condition. All the facilities that the Germans built for\n27\n28\nthe 1936 Olympic games, they did a marvelous job. A marvelous job and\neverything was still intact, even today, even today.",
        "Q: Did the weather cooperate?\nA; Cooperated very well. We had no, we had no inclement weather at all.\n(end of Tape 3 of 3)\n28\n29\n29\n30\n30\n"

The name of this town is\nConnellsville. , Pennsylvania. It\u2019s spelled c-o-n-n-e-]-l-s-v-i-l-l-e. It\u2019s just a\nsmall town right, right in the mountains, about 30, about 32 miles from, from\nMorgantown, West Virginia. That\u2019s where I was born.",
        "A: Well, I grew up in a uh well it was a poor family. We didn\u2019t have too much you\nsee. And of course there was a lot of members of my family. My, my mother\nbirthed twelve children. I was the eleventh child. Well the, it was eight girls and\nthere was four boys. Now all the girls grew up to be adults except one that which\nwas the twelfth child and she, and she died in infancy. Two of my brothers died\nin infa, two of my older brothers. And one brother got killed hunting when he was\nsixteen years of age. And that\u2019s how, that\u2019s, that\u2019s how my family, family was set\nup. Cause my mother married when she was nineteen and my father was twenty-\ntwo. They had this large family which was too many children, too many children.\nBut they made it.",
        "A: Well uh of course my father was a laborer. He dug coal. He carried hod on, on\nconstruction work. He worked in the coke ovens there in, in uh, in my home\ntown. And that\u2019s how he made his living. Cause my mother she did days work\nfor some of the families there in, in the area in which we, where we were living.\nAnd that\u2019s how, that\u2019s how we survived. As I said before, we didn\u2019t have too\nmuch, but we managed to make it under the circumstances.",
        "A: Well you see my, both of my parents they weren\u2019t, they weren\u2019t very well\neducated you see. In fact my father went, I think he went to about the eighth\ngrade and my mother went to about fourth grade. And uh they didn\u2019t put too\nmuch stress. There was no, was never at any time that my parents would sit down\n1\n2\nand discuss education. Because they didn\u2019t have much education themselves.\nAnd the only thing that they were concerned about was me going to school uh\nkeeping up my attendance in school to keep the truant officer from bothering\nthem. That was, that, that was, that was their extent as, as far as my education\nwas concerned.",
        "A: Yes, well, of course, coming along, coming along in the early grades and well, of\ncourse, I, I used to play truant ever, once in a while, to, to go to the movies with a\nfriend of mine. And uh but we never, you know, we never got into any real, real\ntrouble, you know, uh per se. and, of course, I continued to um, not to get ahead\nof my story, I quit school when I was sixteen. See back there, you know, the kids\nwhen they reached the age of sixteen, they wanted to quit school and, and go to\nwork in the factory. There was a couple of factories. There was a box factory\nand there was a glass factory. Well I quit when I was sixteen, but I couldn\u2019t get a\njob because they discriminated against blacks in the, in the, in those industries.\nSo I, I, I sat around for a while. I guess about a year. And I decided well I better\ngo on back to school. So I went back to school, starting in, in my freshman year.\nAnd then I tried to join the Navy. Well the Navy had a quota for, for, for blacks.\nAnd the quota was filled. And, of course I wasn\u2019t interested in the Army at that\nparticular time because I had a couple brother-in-laws who, who was, who had\ngone into the Army and, of course, they\u2019d told me some stories that was, wasn\u2019t\ntoo pleasant. So I didn\u2019t have any interest in the Army. So I continued on,\ncontinued on in school. I completed my freshman year and my sophomore year,\nand then I went into the city school, cause my freshman and sophomore year, they\ndidn\u2019t have any athletics in the school at all, which I could participate in. So I\nwent into the city school in my junior year, and I went out for football. Well I\nstayed out for football up until a week before the first game, and my mother made\nme quit because I was getting home too late to after pract uh football practice to\ntake care of my chores around the house. So the, the line coach of the football\nwas, was a track coach of the school and he noticed that I, I had uh quite a bit of\nspeed when he had us running wind sprints up and down the field in our football\nuniform. So he asked me to come out for track. So that\u2019s how I got started in\ntrack. And, of course, I, I started progressing quite well in, in uh my track\nactivities and he told me don\u2019t, don\u2019t go back, go out for football anymore,\nbecause he was afraid I might get hurt. So that\u2019s how I started my track career.",
        "A: Well, when you, I was active like on, on like we played a little sandlot, sandlot\nbaseball uh and uh softball, those type of sports. I nev, I was never interested in\nbasketball. I tried, tried it but I never, never could uh never become real\ninterested in basketball at all see. But softball and uh baseball was the thing, was\nthe two sports that I was quite interested in.\n2\n3",
        "A: Well there was some, it was some, there was some around that area see cause I\ngrew up in a, in, 1n a, in an, in an environment where there\u2019s all whites. There\nwas only two black families, my family and another family. All my playmates,\nall my schoolmates were white kids. So I didn\u2019t, well of course there was, there\nwas, it was times when uh we\u2019d, we\u2019d get into fights with some of maybe one of\nthe kids maybe called me nigger. And, of course, naturally, that, that was, that\nwas a fighting word see. So we\u2019d fight. Next day we\u2019re friends again. That\u2019s the\nway it was.",
        "A: Well there was, there was, there was some, there was some, there was some\ndifficulty in terms like in trying to get little jobs around that area see. They\ndiscriminated against, against the blacks. But that was, that was about all, you\nsee. That was about all.",
        "A: No. No. Not at all. Not at all. My high school coach who, who uh who uh\ncoached me in track was a very fine man. His name is Joseph Lourou. He was a\nwonderful man and he was a wonderful coach. And he taught me a number of\nthings that I did, that I wasn\u2019t taught at home, you know, about how to conduct\nmyself. Of course I was doing a little smoking at the time. He told me to give\nthat up, which I did. And he said if I, if I continued doing well in my track\nactivities I had a chance to go to college. Well that was just unheard of in my\nfamily of going to college, you see. Because no, no, no member of my family\nfinished high school. So I dropped all my little habits that I had that was, that\nwould, would be detrimental to me achieving my goal or my goals. And I ended\nup getting a scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh after I was graduated in\n1935.",
        "A: Well it was, well, of course, at that particular time, it was very important to me\nbecause it enabled me.",
        "A: Well at that time sports were important to me and particularly the, the track\nactivity type of sports, because that enabled me to get a scholarship to college.\nAnd that was the only way that I could go to college was through athletics. My\nparents didn\u2019t have the money to send me to school. I fact I didn\u2019t even have\n3\n4\nwhen I, when I received the scholarship at the University of Pittsburgh. I didn\u2019t\neven have transportation to get to school. And the sheriff of my home town had\nhis chauffeur to drive me to school. That\u2019s how I got to school in the, in the fall\nof \u00b035. And money, I had exactly twenty-five cents in my pockets when I entered\nthe University of Pittsburgh. That\u2019s all the money I had. Cause as I said earlier I\ncame from a poor family.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Correct. And of course when I got the scholarship, and I, when I\nwent to the University of Pittsburgh, cause I told all, all my friends at home, I said\nif I don\u2019t make it, I\u2019m not coming back to Connellsville. But I made it. I made it.\nI worked hard and I made it.",
        "A: Well course I was the best, I was the best in high school. And of course when I\nwent to Pitt I was able to beat all the athletes, all the athletes that was on the track\nteam on my that ran in my race at Pitt in my freshman year. I came along very,\nvery fast. My junior year in, in high school, of course my races were quite slow,\nbut they showed progress. But then my senior year, I, I just bloomed. I just came\ninto my own. Uh I, my uh main event was the mile. That was, that was the one\nthe event that my coach had me concentrate on see. Well the first mile that I ran\nin high school, my junior year in high school was four minutes and forty-four\nseconds. In my senior year I ran four twenty-three four. I came along that fast.\nAnd of course when I ran that race I, I ran the second fastest school boy, school\nboy mile in the country, four twenty-three four. Al, Al Zamperine who was on\nthe Olympic team with me, he ran four twenty-one something. But when I won\nmy race in my round, my mile, when I won my mile race, I won it about a\nhundred and twenty yards ahead of the man who was uh ran second to me.\nCourse if I had somebody to push me, it would have been faster.",
        "A: No. No. When I completed my freshman year at Pitt, that summer I had intended\nto go on home and take it easy for the summer. But my coach asked me to try out\nfor the Olympic team. Course I had no idea that he wanted me to do that, you see.\nSo I said okay, we\u2019ll try out for it. So I tried out for it. I qualified in the\npreliminaries which they ran at the University of Pittsburgh. I qualified in the\nsemi-finals which they ran at Harvard Stadium winning the event in the, in the, in\nthe half a mile. And then at Randall\u2019s Island where they ran the finals, I, I, I won\nmy event there and I went to Berlin, Germany, and won my event.\n4\n5",
        "A: None whatsoever. In fact I never even thought in terms of, of, of going to the\nOlympics. Never thought in terms of that at all. And it was the coach that uh\napproached me on that and said he wanted me to try out for the team.",
        "A: No. Not at all.",
        "A: At the University of Pittsburgh? Yes there was, there was a, an incident where\nrace uh entered. I, when I came back from the Olympic games, the professor of\nmy English Department didn\u2019t want to let, didn\u2019t want to let me enter it, enter the\nprogram cause I was a month late. However, I think the chancellor must have\ninterceded and made it, made arrangements for me to get into the, get into the\nEnglish program. And, of course, another thing that hurt me quite badly when I\nwas grad, when I was being graduated from the University. They had what was\nknown as the U, the University of Pittsburgh Hall of Fame. Well, I was the only\nathlete to bring the school international recognition, but they did not, they did not\nuh select me for the Hall of Fame.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what it was. But I, I, I, I can only, I can only assume that. Because\nnow they had, they had all American football players that brought the school\nnational prestige, national recognition. I brought the school international\nrecognition. They made the Hall of Fame, but I didn\u2019t. They were white and, of\ncourse, I, I was black. So what, the only, only, I can only assume it was because\nof race.",
        "A: No. But of course I socialized only with my own kind, you know, my own race of\npeople see. I didn\u2019t socialize with anybody else other than my own race of people\nduring the, the four years that I uh was going to the Uni, going to the University\nof Pittsburgh.",
        "A: I had no problem as, as, as a, as a, as a athlete at all because we were all, we were\nall on the same team. We were all very, very close. In fact the athletes\nparticipated with me even after we left the University, we, we were very, very\nclose. I know it, it uh in athletics you know you become, it\u2019s, you become, it, it\u2019s\n5\n6\nstronger than a fraternity when you\u2019re working with, when you\u2019re running\ntogether, training together, trying, trying to reach certain goals in, in your, in your\nsport, you become very, very close. And I still, and I still have contact with some\nof the, some of the fellows that ran on the team with me even today.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Oh yes. You were always reminded of the fact that, you know, you were, you\nwere, you\u2019re colored, you know, and that you there was certain, certain things you\ncouldn\u2019t do and certain things you could do as a result of your race.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And I think sports has done so much in order to make uh the country\na better country in terms of, of, of social relationships between peoples. And\nthat\u2019s what the Olympics does, you know. You be, you become very, you become\nacquainted with a lot of people in particularly people on your team and, and you\nbecome very close with, to them. And you don\u2019t think in terms of race when\nyou\u2019re dealing with them see. And they don\u2019t think in terms of race uh with you.\nI know, I know in 1950 uh I went to Georgia, to Athens, Georgia, and I made\ncontact with uh an athlete that won, that won, that won the uh high hurdles on the\n1936 Olympic team. Uh Speck Towns. Well now he was, he was a, he was a\ncoach at the University of Georgia. And of course back in that time you know the\nSouth was running rampant with, with uh racism and discrimination. So I\u2019m\nwhen I got into Athens, I call him up. And he took and he told me, asked me\nwhere I was, where I was stopping. And I told him. He said no you stay right\nthere and I\u2019Il come down and get you and bring you out to the school. And that\u2019s\nwhat he did. That was in 1950, 19 when, when the racism and discrimination was\nrunning rampant in (words missing in original transcript). But that shows you the,\nthe closeness you have with, with your fellow athletes you see.",
        "A: No. No. I wasn\u2019t aware of any, of any anti-Semitism while I was at the\nUniversity.",
        "A: No more than what was adver, no more than what was advertised in the, in the\npapers, you know. Uh we heard a lot about what Hitler, what Hitler was doing as\n6\n7\nfar as the, the Jewish people were concerned. And you know just before the\nOlympics, you know he\u2019s written a book Mein Kampf. I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t read it.\nUh the book that I did read was the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I read, I\nread that some years later. But when we went, cause when we went to the\nOlympics, we weren\u2019t interested, we weren\u2019t interested in politics. We were only\ninterested in going to Germany, participating in our events, and trying to win as\nmany gold medals or medal as we could win, see, and come home. That was the,\nthat was our interest. Cause see I was, I made the team when I was twenty. Uh\nand before I got to Berlin, Germany, I, I had a birthday and I was twenty-one\nwhen I actually won my gold medal. So we were young. All of us were young.",
        "A: No. No. Not at all. I know uh there was, there was one in, there was one\ninstance when we had a young German athlete come visit with us. And we were\nasking him, we were asking this young athlete, he spoke English fluently. And\nwe asked him uh what did the peep, what did the German people think of Hitler.\nWell they thought he was, they thought he was a great man. First of all his reason\nfor making that statement was the fact that the economic situation had improved\ntremendously under his regime, you see. Because what he did, he withdrew from\nthe League of Nations, as you know, started building up all this war armament,\nopened up all these factories to build all these weapons, and it made it possible for\na lot of Germans people to go to work. And that\u2019s why they thought that he, he\nwas, he was great for the country. But they didn\u2019t realize that they had a\nFrankenstein on their hands, you see. Because you know they attempted to\nassassinate him.",
        "A: Well I was very, I was very happy and very elated I was able to make the team\nyou see. Course not realizing what the Olympic program was all about at that\ntime because everything came very fast to me, see. But when I, when I, when I\ncame, when my, when I came down to earth and realized what I had accomplished\nby making the team, then I was most elated.",
        "A: United States. That\u2019s right. Um mmm.",
        "A: It did. It made all my family very proud. And all my friends.\n7\n8",
        "A: No. the furtherest I ever, I, I never even traveled as far as Pittsburgh when I went\nto, went to the University and we, I stayed right, right there in that small town of\nConnellsville. And the furtherest I was away from home was when I went to\nPittsburgh to the University, which was 50, 51 miles away.",
        "A: It was very interesting.",
        "A: The trip over was very, very interesting. Of course we sailed on the S.S.\nManhattan which was one of the better liners at that particular time. And, of\ncourse, they had wonderful facilities for us while we traveled by boat. It took us\neight days before we landed in Hamburg, Germany. Now some of us were pretty\ngood sailors and some of us weren\u2019t. Because with many, quite a, quite a, quite a\nnumber of the athletes got sick, seasick, cause the sea was pretty rough. But\nfortunately for me I was a pretty good sailor. I didn\u2019t get sick. So I was able to\nmake the trip and enjoy the food. Because once you get seasick you don\u2019t want\nno parts of food. But I was able to eat the food and enjoy it and enjoy the trip as a\nwhole.",
        "A: Oh yes. They made it possible, they, they equipped that ship whereby all the\nathletes that were participating in the various activities to be able to train while\nthe ship was sailing. And of course with the, with the runners, you know, we did\na lot of jogging on the port, port side of the ship, you see. To keep, you know, try\nto keep in shape that way, see.",
        "A: Yes, well most of the runners pretty much stayed, stuck together. Now like the\nweight men, those who threw the discus and the shot put and the hammer, we\ndidn\u2019t socialize too much with them. But, of course, but the runners we all had,\nwe had more in common with them.",
        "A: I had a room mate, and my, my room mate uh in going over uh was uh, uh Mac\nRobinson, that was Jackie Robinson\u2019s brother. And of course he also roomed\nwith me in, in the Olympic village.\n8\n9",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s, that was the way it was, that was the way everything was set up for us\nyou see. And it was. It was very good. It shouldn\u2019t have been any segregation\nbecause we were all a member of one team, the American team. We all had one\nobjective and there was, there should not have any segregation and there wasn\u2019t\nany segregation.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: It was exciting. It was the first, first time I\u2019d ever taken, taken a boat anywhere.\nAnd, and a, and a, and above all, a luxury liner like that you see that was set up.\nCause that was the S.S. Manhattan was one of the, one of our big liners. It was\nthe S.S. Manhattan and S.S. Washington. The S.S. Washington brought the team,\nbrought the team members back. But the S.S. Manhattan took us, took us abroad\nyou see to Germany.",
        "A: Oh yes. Very excited. And of course I wanted to win. And that, that\u2019s all, that\nwas always my philosophy when I toed, when I toed the line on any race. My one\nobjective was to win. In fact throughout my collegiate career I think I won about\n90, 90 percent of every race I ever ran.",
        "A: Friendly. Everybody was friendly. Everybody had a good time. Everybody\nenjoyed themselves. Even those who got seasick.\n9\n10\n(end Tape | Of 3)\n(Tape 2 of 3)\n(beep)",
        "A: Not, no, I wasn\u2019t aware of too much about it. I heard a little bit about it. The boy\nuh the boycott, there was some, there was some talk about the Olympics being\nboycotted because of what Hitler was doing to the Jewish people in Germany.\nBut uh there was noth, nothing made, made too much of as far as the team\nmembers were concerned cause it was never discussed amongst, amongst the\nteam members. But we heard it and we heard something about it, but we never,\nwe never discussed it. As I said earlier, we weren\u2019t interested in politics you see\nat all. We were only interested in going to Germany and winning.",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "A: There was some talk. There was some talk about boycotting the Olympics, but it\nwasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t something that was a, a, a matter of conversation amongst the\nteam members you see. We didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t uh go into any detail on it. So uh\nwe didn\u2019t bother, we didn\u2019t concern ourselves too much about it. All we knew\nthat we were we\u2019d made the team, we were, we were on the boat, and we were\ngoing to Germany. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s all we were interested in.",
        "A: No. Not at all.\n10\n11",
        "A: No. Not that I know of. In fact I, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t recall of ever reading anything\nuh in the, in the newspapers, the black press or the white press concerning going\nas, as far as the matter of going to the Olympics was concerned.",
        "A: Not at all. Not to my knowledge anyhow.",
        "A: Hamburg, Germany. That\u2019s where the ship uh docked. And then we took a train\nfrom there to Berlin.",
        "A: It was, it was very, it was pretty exciting. You know, the, the, the,",
        "A: When we, when we arrived in Hamburg, it was, it was pretty, pretty exciting\nevent for us, you know. It was a lot of people out there to, to welcome us to\nGermany at that particular time. And then and of course we appreciated, we\nappreciated the welcome that they were, they\u2019re showing us at that time you see.",
        "A: German people. German people. They were out to welcome us, welcome the\nAmerican team to uh, to uh, to Germany. They knew, they knew where we were\ngoing to go. And they, and they, they knew the reason why we were there.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether it was organized or not. We just saw, we just saw a lot, lot\nof people you know, cheering us and what have you, when we, when we docked\nin, in Hamburg.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall really. I don\u2019t recall. All, all I saw was a lot of people and a lot of\nwaving of the hands and what have you, see.",
        "A: By train. By train. We went to Berlin by train. After we docked in Hamburg uh\nthey put us all on a train, all the American team members on a train, and we went\nto Berlin to the Olympic village.\n11\n12",
        "A: We were welcomed at the Olympic village and, of course, they assigned, they\nassigned us, assigned quarters for all of the team members. They had little huts\nthat we, that we lived in, see. And, of course, there was uh two, two men or two\nathletes per, per hut. And, of course, I roomed with uh Mac Robinson while we\nwere, while we were in, in the Olympic village. That was Jackie Robinson\u2019s\nbrother.",
        "A: It was very pleasant. Very, in, in the Olympic village it was very, very pleasant.\nThe accommodations were very good. The food was very good. And uh the, the\ncooks from the S.S. Brahman, that was the German\u2019s uh luxury liner, those cooks\nwere the cooked the food for the American team, and they did a fine job.",
        "A: Well, there was a lot of camaraderie amongst the American team members you\nsee. We do, we, of course, we socialize, you know, visiting one another, visiting\neach, each hut you know. Talking about what we hoped to do at the, at the\ngames. That sort of conversation. But that was about it you see. Cause you\nknow there was nothing else you know that we could do you know under the\ncircumstances because there was a certain amount of discipline that was exercised\nto make sure that uh that the team members did what they were supposed to do in\npreparation for their activities, their athletic ac, athletic activities.",
        "A: Yes we trained. They had training facilities there whereby we, we trained in\npreparation for, for our race you see. And, and they had a track there that we\ncould that, that we could run on in, in order to keep us, keep us in shape, cause\nyou know I guess a, a lot of us got out of shape you know based on particularly\nthose who got sick, you see, and they had to work pretty hard, had to get through\ntheir land legs back again see. So it, it was, they had, they had to do quite a bit of\ntraining to kind of get themself together you know for their races you know.",
        "A: No. No.\n12\n13",
        "A: There were all, all, all nationalities who participated on the same track. Cause\nthey only had one, one facility for us, you see.",
        "A: Well uh they, they weren\u2019t spelled out, you know, rule one, rule two, rule three,\nand rule four. It was nothing like that. We as athletes knew that we had a certain,\ncertain responsibility to maintain ourselves to the best of our abilities so that we\nwould be prepared for our, for our races, you see. And we took that, we took that\nresponsibility on our own, you see. And uh but we, we knew that was it was\nunderstood that that was how we had to react or conduct ourselves.",
        "A: Looked like a, like a beautiful college campus. Beautiful grass, laid out very,\nvery well. I, I took some very nice pictures of that Olympic village which I have\nat home. Uh because I had, I owned, I had a little old box camera and I took some\npictures of the village. But it was very, very nice. A beautiful place. It was a\nbeautiful place.",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t notice any. After I. No, I did not no, I did not notice any\ndiscrimination when I arrived in Germany. After \u2019'd won my race, won my gold\nmedal, I went downtown Berlin doing a little sightseeing of the city, and the\npeople, the German people were very, very cordial. They just crowded around\nyou for autographs. Very friendly. There was nothing, I, I didn\u2019t notice anything\nnegative at all the whole time that I participated in those 1936 Olympic games as\nfar as we were concerned. Now you\u2019ve probably heard some stories about Hitler\nuh refusing to shake, shake Jesse Owen\u2019s hand. Well that\u2019s, those stories were\nwrong. They were wrong. One time Hitler invited some of the athletes up in his,\nup in, up in his uh the sections that they had established for him and his\nlieutenants. Uh Helen Stevens who won the hundred meters for the women, the\nAmerica for the, she was on the women\u2019s team. She and her coach were invited\nup that one particular time. And of course the, the American coaches spoke to\nHitler about that. And informed him that if he wasn\u2019t going to invite all the\nathletes up there then he, then they wanted him not to do that uh with any, any\nother athletes. And at the time that he invited these athletes up there, Jesse Owens\nwas still competing on the track. So therefore he could not have gone up there at\nthat particular time.\n13\n14",
        "A: That\u2019s right. The American, the American coaches told him not to do that\nbecause he was see if he was going to discriminate, and only have, only have\ncertain athletes come up there, then uh they, they, they, they uh they, they said\nthey didn\u2019t want him to do that.",
        "A: Well he, he, he, he didn\u2019t have no athletes come up there for the rest of the games.",
        "A: No. Not at all. As I said he must have, he opened up, he must have declared the\nmoratorium for the games because the things that perhaps he had been doing prior\nto the games, nothing like that took place during the games, you see. And of\ncourse after the games you know what happened, you see.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s, we didn\u2019t see anything that was, that was out of line or that\nwas negative.",
        "A: Yes, yes, we heard the story. You see Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller were the\ntwo Jewish boys, extra boys that was, that was selected or qualified to run on the\nrelay team. That was the four by one hundred relay team. When we, I don\u2019t\nknow, none of us knew who made the decision as to keep those fellows off that\nteam. Jesse Owens wanted to give up his position on the team. And I\u2019m sure that\nRalph Metcalfe probably would have given his position up, to give Sam Stoller\nand Marty Glickman a chance to run, but the coaches of the American team\ndecided they wanted Jesse and, and Ralph Metcalfe to run on that team. And so\nthey, so they didn\u2019t select Sam Stoller or Marty Glickman to run. And they still\nwould have won the, they still would have won the race cause they were both very\nfine, very fine runners, very fine sprinters. But who made the, who made the final\ndecision? Whether it was Lawrence Robertson, whether Hitler had something,\nsomething to say about it, we don\u2019t know. We discussed it many, many times, but\nwe never did know who made that decision to keep those two fellows from\nrunning on that team. And to this day, Marty Glickman is very, very bitter about\nit, you see, cause I knew Marty Glickman very well see.\n14\n15",
        "A: We felt, we felt that they, we felt that they should have been given the opportunity\nto participate, an opportunity to win a gold medal and which they would have\nwon a gold medal. They still would have won that relay team, regardless whether\nJesse Owens or Ralph Metcalfe was on it or not. They still would have won. But\nthey didn\u2019t give those boys a chance. And that\u2019s why Marty today, to this day, is\nvery bitter about that, about that decision.",
        "A: Well everything, we saw Hitler every day when he came out to the games, but\nyou see, he was so far away just like myself, uh sitting in the, in the stand, he was\ntoo far away for us to even see, see the image of him, see. We knew he was there.\nWe knew each time he came into the game because you know the German people\nyou know, you know, naturally would create a commotion when he, when he\nentered the stadium, when he entered the stadium. But me personally, he was too\nfar away from me to make out just, just what he looked like other than from, from\nthose pictures that I\u2019ve seen some, seen of him see.",
        "A: Well at the games, at those particular games in 1936, they were a very fine set of\ngames. That was my first experience you see. That was my first experience of,\nof, of being in the Olympic games. It was very, very exciting. The events were\nrun off with precision, the athletes didn\u2019t have to wait around when their event\nwas called, the starter started, started your event. You knew the Germans, you\nknew they\u2019re, they\u2019re a stick, they\u2019re a stickler for things being done just right.\nAnd that\u2019s the way they, that\u2019s the way they ran the games. Because in talking\nwith some of the old timers who had followed the Olympic games prior to the\n1936 games that, that I participated in, they said they that the Berlin games were\nthe finest Olympic games that they\u2019d ever witnessed. That was the, that was the\nstatement they made.",
        "A: There was a lot, there was a lot of fanfare. There was a lot of fanfare. A lot of\nexcitement. Lot of excitement.",
        "A: Well, the flags, the only flags that, that was, that took place was when after the\nathlete\u2019s completed their event. Now, when the American, when the Americans\nwon, the American flags went up. And of course, it was, if it was a foreign\ncountry that was part of, part of the race, took third or second, whichever the case\n15\n16\nmay be, or even first, their, the flags representing their nations went up. Those\nare the only flags that were waving. And of course in the, in the uh bleachers,\nsome of the, some of the uh spectators were waving flags. Some of the\nAmericans were waving little flags you see, showing their, their enthusiasm for,\nfor their, for their countrymen winning or the country women winning. That was\nthe type of fanfare that you saw during the games.",
        "A: A lot of cheering. That\u2019s, that\u2019s always the case you see. They do a lot of\ncheering. Although from my experience, you know, the athletes never hear it\nthough. They never hear what\u2019s going on. Cause they\u2019re concentrating on what\nthey\u2019re doing. They\u2019re concentrating on that race. So they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t hear\nthe cheering. They don\u2019t even hear what people say.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see any of that. Didn\u2019t see any of that at all. Didn\u2019t see any of that at all.",
        "A: Well I had to run three races. I had to run the preliminaries and the semi-finals\nand the finals. The preliminary race, the preliminaries and the, and the semi-final\nrace. When the race was, when the race was started I got right out in front and I\nstayed out there and won the race on, on both of those two races. On the final\nrace, I decided well I\u2019m going to try to exercise a little strategy to make sure that I\nwould win the race uh by laying back in second position, and then, of course, in\nthe waiting until I hit the last three hundred meters and then starting my kick to\ntry to win the race. But the fellow, Phil Edwards, from Canada, he set a very, very\nslow pace. And, of course, he set that pace and, and we, we ran that way for four\nhundred meters, that\u2019s half the race. When we hit the first turn of the last, the last\nhalf of the race or the last four hundred meters, the contestants or my opponents\ncrowded right around me. I got boxed in. And the only way I could get out of\nthat box was to stop. Now if I attempted to breakthrough, I would have fouled\nsomebody and I\u2019d have been disqualified. But I had enough sense to know that I\ncouldn\u2019t do that. So I stopped. So I let the, let, let my opponents proceed in front,\nahead of me. I ran out into the third lane and I then I ran around the field and won\nthe race. In fact I ran more than eight hundred meters when I won that race\nbecause I was running way out in the third lane see. But I won it. That was the\nmost important thing. And of course the old timers just said they never in the\nhistory of the, of the, of the Olympics had ever seen a race won the way I ran\nmine. And you see, first of all, whenever you uh stop and you break your stride,\nyou break your rhythm, that u, that usually finishes you. But I was able to pick up\neven though I started the race twice and, and, and still won.\n16\n17",
        "A: Determine, determination. My only objective at any time I got into a race was to\nwin. And that\u2019s what I did.",
        "A: That\u2019s what it takes. Determination. Lot of fire in the stomach as they say.",
        "A: I was winning for me and I was winning for the country. Me first, then the\ncountry.",
        "A: Well, it, it was a momentous occasion. But I didn\u2019t realize how important it was\nuntil it was all over with because everything happened so fast, just like I made the\nOlympic team very fast. Didn\u2019t know that I was going to be on the Olympic\nteam, didn\u2019t know I was going to be even try out for the Olympic team. Then\ngoing to Germany and winning it. But I didn\u2019t realize just what achievement that\nI had accomplished until it was all over to receive my medal. Uh we weren\u2019t, we\nweren\u2019t instructed as to how we were to salute you see. So at one, one point I, I, I\nsaid well should I give a Nazi salute, should I give a, or should I give an\nAmerican salute. But I was very real confused, but nevertheless I finally ended\nup giving the American salute. Cause I was nervous, very nervous and very\nconfused. I was a young, young man, and of course we weren\u2019t given any\ninstructions on that you see.",
        "A: All right. When you\u2019re up on the stand and they\u2019re playing the Star Spangled\nBanner for all the Americans and of course they played the Star Spangled Banner\nfor me winning my race, you see. Then they had young girls that came over. And\nthe girls presented the medal. They presented the medal. And somewhere,\nsomewhere, somewhere later they presented an oak, a little oak tree, which I\nbrought back home and that oak tree it was about 18, about 18 inches uh in height.\nI brought it back and then I had to send it to the Department of Agriculture here in\nWashington cause they had to check the dirt around it for any kind of bugs that\nwas being brought in. So when they, when it was sent back to Connellsville, my\nhome town, the tree was almost dead. So I turned the tree over to the Botany\nteacher of my high school and he worked with the tree and brought it back, and\nthey planted it on the library at, at, at the Carnegie Library in the home town.\nAnd then of course, they, they replanted 1t when they built the stadium, the Falcon\nStadium is the name of it. And that tree is now six feet tall. And a lot of the\n17\n18\nacorns from that tree is being planted around different places around the United\nStates, from, from my tree.",
        "A: Yes. Well, you know, you know, they showed you where, where you had to go in\norder to uh receive your, receive your, your medal see. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s what,\nthat\u2019s what they did you see. See, I, I, I, I, I won first. Uh Maria Lansey from\nItaly was second. I forget the third man who, who, who uh, no Phil Edwards, Phil\nEdwards from Canada, he was third. He was third. Now the two runners, two,\ntwo other, two other American runners, Charles Hornsbarsel from University of\nIndiana or Indiana University and Harry Williamson from North Carolina\nUniversity, they came in, they came in fourth and, and fifth. They didn\u2019t, they\ndidn\u2019t uh they didn\u2019t get a medal see. Cause they only give medals for the first\nthree places.",
        "A: Very, it was, it was a very, very exciting experience. As I said, I was, I was very\nnervous. I was very nervous. Everybody clapping their hands and cheering etc.\nIt was nervous for a young man twenty-one years old, had never been so far away\nfrom home.",
        "A: Yes. We did very well. We did very well.",
        "A: Well, of course we were a victim, being, myself personally, we were a victim of\ndiscrimination in, in, in, in the country of America for all those many years cause\nI'd only lived in the world for twenty-one years at that particular time. And we\nunderstood that. We didn\u2019t like it. We never do. We never did like it and we\nnever will like it. We still have racism in this country. This country is still full of\nracism as far as, as the black man is concerned. Things are better than they used\nto be. Much better. Economically speaking, blacks are getting better jobs than\nthey got back in those days. They\u2019re able to go to any, any, any, any university in\nthe country. Cause back in those days you couldn\u2019t go, you couldn\u2019t go, you\ncouldn\u2019t go to University of Georgia or University of Mississippi and what you\nhave back in those, back in those times. You couldn\u2019t go to the Naval Academy\nback in those times. Well, get to tell you a little experience in that, in that regard.\nWe had a track meet to run at Annapolis, at the Naval Academy. Now here I am\nan Olympic champion and they told my coach that I couldn\u2019t run. I couldn\u2019t\n18\n19\ncome. So I had to stay home because of discrimination. Now that wasn\u2019t hap,\nthat wasn\u2019t the situation at West Point. I ran at West point when I was going to\nthe University of Pittsburgh, but I couldn\u2019t run at, at Annapolis. But things are\nbetter now.",
        "A: Now what was the question?",
        "A: Well actually we\u2019ve only got a minute left on the tape. So maybe I\u2019m going to\nstop and start again.\n(end Tape 2 of 30\n(Tape 3 of 3)\n(get a little mark)\n(We need to hear your voice again)",
        "A: You want to hear my voice again.\n(Beep)",
        "A: There was definitely a special feeling in winning the gold medal and being a, a\nblack man because here I, here I was doing something and particularly, this\nparticular event had not been won by an American in 24 years. So and it, that was\nwon by a white man, not a black man. So I was very proud of that, of that fact,\nvery proud of that achievement, and I was very happy for myself as an individual,\nfor my race, and for my country.",
        "A: Well after the Olympics were over, I think it came at, I think it was published, it\nmust have been published in the Ger, in, in, in the German publication, the\nGerman newspapers, that Hitler made the remark that if 1t wasn\u2019t for the black\nauxiliary the American would not have won the Olympics. That\u2019s what I, that\u2019s\nwhat I hear. I didn\u2019t read it, but I heard, heard that that was the remark that he\nmade, you see.\n19\n20",
        "A: Well it, it made me, it made me feel good because what we did, we destroyed his\nmaster race theory. That\u2019s what, it made me feel very good. Cause you know he\nuh he had that master race theory that you know the, the superior race, that only,\nonly, only the pure Germans could do certain things in this world. That was what\nhe was advocating. But we destroyed his theory whenever we started winning\nthose gold medals.",
        "A: We came to New York and they had a big parade for us. After the Olympics we\ncame home, we came home on the S.S. Washington. Now, of course, Jesse\nOwens came home ahead of us because he, he didn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t do any running\nafter the Olympics outside of Dresden, Germany. One week after the Olympic\ngames, Jesse ran in Dresden, Germany, and of course he was defeated by Ralph\nMetcalfe who took second to him in the Olympic games in Berlin. But he had\nsome offers that was made, some professional offers, and of course he came back\non the, on the, on the, on the Queen Mary to take advantage of those offers cause\nJesse came from a poor family too. Most of the blacks came from poor families\nyou see. None of, none of us came from any wealthy homes, or middle class\nhomes. Most all from poor families. But many of those offers didn\u2019t pan out for\nhim at all. And of course they, due to the fact, you see he was scheduled to run\nin, in, In various countries. He didn\u2019t run so they declared him, they declared him\nas a professional. So Jesse, his amateur days were over with after that see. But I\nran after the Olympic games. I ran in White City Stadium in London. Then from\nthere I ran up in Oslo, Norway, before coming home. But we all, we all ended up\nin, in New York and they had a big ticker tape parade for us in, in uh Manhattan\nup, up Fifth Avenue. And there was a lot of cheering and if course Mayor\nLaGuardia who was the Mayor of the city at the time uh gave us, gave us a, a\nmedal uh from the City of New York. And then from there we all departed New\nYork City and we went to our various homes. And, of course, when I got back to\nConnellsville, Pennsylvania, they had a big parade for me in my, in my home\ntown. And which, which was the biggest parade that ev, that ever turned out for\nanybody in that small town.",
        "A: It was, it was, it was. I was, it was, it was a fabulous time, a fabulous occasion,\nand a happy time for me and for my family and for all my friends back there in\nConnellsville.\n20\n21",
        "A: Well it lasted for quite a, quite a long time, you know, because you know I used to\ngo out and, and do a lot of speaking to the young uh run uh kids after the Olympic\ngames and, of course, I was still in school and I was still, still making records as\nan athlete because I won every major med, won every major er uh track meet in\nthe country at that particular time. Right up until, right up until I stopped running\nin 1940.",
        "A: Some, some doors. Some doors, cause I, I never, you know, I, I was never made,\nI never made any uh never uh received any fabulous offers in terms of uh making\nany money because see first of all I was still in school and I had three years. I had\nthree years to go to get my degree. And when I was graduated. Right after I was\ngraduated from the University of Pittsburgh, then I went to New York University\nand uh while I was in graduate school, I got a job at John Wannamaker\u2019s running\nthe elevator. And of course you know there was quite a lot of publicity came out\nabout an Olympic champion getting a job running an elevator. And the only thing\nthat John Wannamaker wanted to do was give me a permanent job running an\nelevator. That was all. Then I got a job as a social investigator for the city of\nNew York, working with disadvantaged people who were on welfare. Then I,\nthen I got a job working, working for the uh police Athletic League, director of\none of their centers up in, up in Harlem, New York, working with disadvantaged\nkids. And while I was working in that job, I took examination for State Parole\nOfficer for the State of New York and I became a parole officer, supervising\nparolees who were released from the New York State Reformatory, reformatories\nor state prisons. Then from that I worked for a short period of time with Shefland\nand Company uh advertising alcoholic beverages. I didn\u2019t particularly care for\nthat cause I couldn\u2019t see myself making, making a permanent job pushing booze.\nSo I got out of that. Then I got a job as special inves, uh, uh insurance agent for\nthe Prudential Insurance Company. I worked a while in that job. Then I ended up\nmy career with the Job Corps Program. You know about the Job Corps program.\nAgain working with disadvantaged kids. I never made a lot of money, but I made\na living. But my, but my, the compensation that I got from the work that I did\nwas helping people. And I helped a lot of people, a lot of people.",
        "A: Well not uh not, not, not to my experience, not from my experience.",
        "A: I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t recall just looking back on, on, on my early, early career after\nwinning the Olympics that 1t opened any particular doors, being a gold medal\nwinner.\n21\n22",
        "A: Well I expected that I had hope. Nut noth, nothing materialized in, in that regard.\nNow I\u2019m sure many of the white Olympians were made offers, very fine offers,\nbut I can\u2019t recall any of the black Olympians making any, any, making any great\noffers. Now Jesse did pretty well. He got in public relations work, but when he\nfirst came back from the Olympic games, he, he, he, he, he found it very difficult\nto get any decent, any decent work. He came back. He ran against race horses.\nYou may have heard of, heard of him running against race horse. He did a\nnumber of things in order to track, try to make a living for his family. But only in\nlater years he, he uh he started a public relation organization there in Chicago, and\nhe did a lot of uh did a lot of he was on a lot of speaking engagements. And he\npicked up quite a bit of money doing that. But uh he didn\u2019t have any, any, any\nbig jobs. He never had any real, any real big jobs, you know.",
        "A: Yes. When I came back, when I came back to the University of Pittsburgh, they\ndidn\u2019t want, they didn\u2019t want to let me into the English class because I was a\nmonth late. And of course I guess the chancellor straightened that matter out.\nThen when I, one, one day I went downtown Pittsburgh, and one evening, to\nChild\u2019s restaurant. They refused to serve me. That was, that was one instance.\nThen when I was graduated and they had the uh University Hall of Fame, here I\u2019d\nbrought international, international recognition to the school. The All American\nfootball players like Marshall Goldberg, they brought national recognition to the\nschool. They made the Hall of Fame, but I didn\u2019t make it. In spite of the gold\nmedal that I\u2019d won and bringing the school international recognition. So that, that\nlet me know just what the situation was. Things hadn\u2019t changed. But I was\nyoung and, of course, as years went on, things got better. And uh and to date\nthings have gotten much better for the blacks. But we still have a long way to go.",
        "A: Well, I personally became a, aware of what was going on based on, based on the,\non the publications on, on what was, what was uh printed in, in the various\nnewspapers and, and, and, and magazines of, of what was happening in Germany.\nOf course right after the Olympics, in 1039, Hitler started World War II when he\nmarched on Czechoslovakia, that was the beginning of World War II. And of\ncourse we all knew what happened after that.\n22\n23",
        "A: Yes, my, become aware of those atrocities and things from what, from what was\nprinted in the, in the, in the, in the newspaper. Newspapers through, you know,\nthroughout, throughout the United States.",
        "A: Yes it was very hard to believe. It was very hard to believe. But we knew what\nwas going on based on the publicity prior to the Olympic games, what Hitler was\ndoing. And as I said he declared a moratorium, opened up everything, made\neverything very pleasant, very accommodating for, for the visiting uh, uh\nOlympic team nations. But after the Olympics they went right back to the, to the\nthings he had planned. And, of course, all these things he had planned was laid\nout in his book, Mein Kampf.",
        "A: It was. He made it so. He made it a propaganda coup to further, to further his\ncause, to further his program that he had set up.",
        "A: Well, I would think it was pretty much the latter, pretty much the latter. Cause\nwe\u2019d had some background on what was going on prior to the games, and of\ncourse it was brought out more pointedly after the games. See when after the\ngames were over then Hitler continued with his program, you see. Marching on\nCzechoslovakia and starting, starting the war. And of course it was something\nthat uh we more or less expected. We more or less expected. You know uh the\nworld didn\u2019t think Hitler was doing what he was doing. You see they should have\nknown what he was doing. You know, Germany was part of the League of\nNations, like all the nations were, were part of that League. And the, the reason\nthat they set that league up as you know from history was to more or less keep a\ntab on each nation in terms of them building up war armaments to start a war.\nNow Hitler withdrew from the League of Nations. They should have known then\nwhat he was going to do. But they didn\u2019t believe him. They didn\u2019t believe him.\nThey didn\u2019t believe what he had printed in that book, Mein Kampf. Winston\nChurchill, the Prime Minister of England, called him the little Corporal. They\ndown played Hitler. They didn\u2019t believe, believe what he was about to do. So\ntherefore they, they didn\u2019t put a curb on him see. They probably could have\nstopped World War II if they had done so at that time. When he withdrew from\nthe League of Nations, if they\u2019d of put a clamp, put a clamp on him at that\n23\n24\nparticular time, there probably would have been no World War hh. But they didn\u2019t\ndo it.",
        "A: Exercised a boycott of the Olympics?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether it would have made any difference or not. I really don\u2019t. I,\nI can\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t , I can\u2019t answer that question.",
        "A: Well in retrospect, based, based on all the training that the athletes had gone\nthrough in preparing for the Olympic games, I feel, I felt that they should have\nhad, they should have gone on with the Olympics as they did. Because I think\nthat would, that would have been a very bad thing to have taken place. Uh but it\nwould been, it would have been very hurting for the athletes who had made so\nmuch preparation, who had trained so long over the years. Fortunately for me I\ndidn\u2019t train like that. I was more or less a gifted athlete. I came up very fast. But\nthere was other athletes who had trained for the Olympics who had trained for\nyears to prepare for the games, and that would have been very, very bad if they\ncould not have gone. That\u2019s my, that\u2019s my feeling, personal feeling. Now there\nmight, there might be others who felt who would feel differently about it based on\nthe question you just posed to me, but that\u2019s my feeling.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That was the only one. I remember this young man that came in. He was young\nlike we were and uh he came and visited with us, you see. And of course when\nwe heard all this uh this information about Hitler and naturally we posed a\nquestion. What did they think, what did the German people think of Hitler. And\nhe said they, he said they thought he was a, a very good man because of what he\u2019d\ndone for the country economically speaking, made it possible for all of them to\nwork and of course you know all of them were working in the, in the, in these\n24\n25\nfactories where they were making weapons. And that\u2019s why they felt, cause right\nafter World War I, you know, the Germans they really were beat down. They\nwere, they were in a bad way. And I guess they, they were, they were, they were\nlooking, they were looking for a savior. And that\u2019s when Hitler came into, came\ninto play. They were looking for somebody to pull them out of those doldrums\nthat they were in, you see. And of course when he withdrew from the League of\nNations, started building all, all this, all this war armament, putting all these\nGerman people to work, he was a great guy as far as they were concerned. But\nthey didn\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t know the whole story.",
        "A: No. No. No.",
        "A: With other athletes from, from other teams.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yeah there was quite a, quite a, quite a bond, you know. We be, we\nbecame very, very close friends and we (words missing in original transcript).\nThe other athletes on the team were very close. I was very close to them. I\u2019m\nstill very close to some of them that are, that are still around. I still make contact\nwith them, you see. And uh, but of course, many of them are gone, many of them\nhave passed. And as I said I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s left now see. Archie Williams\nwho won the 400 meters, he died about three years ago. And he was the last of\nthe gold medal winners, other than myself, that were still living.",
        "A: Oh yes. Stronger than a fraternity. Stronger, much stronger than a fraternity\nbecause of what we go through in training and what have you, the pain, feeling of\npain when we\u2019re training, the feeling of pain when we, when we race. That, that,\nthat gives us a lot of strength and a lot of. It\u2019s something that we have in common\nwith each other. And something that we understand. You see one athlete\nunderstands another athlete and what he has to go through. If he\u2019s a football\nplayer, a football player understands what another football player has to go\nthrough. And that\u2019s the same way with in track and field.",
        "A: We lived in the same neighborhood up in New Rochelle, New York. His family\nand my family live in the same neighborhood.\n25\n26",
        "A: We met at the Olympics. Marty Glickman and I met in the Olympics as part of\nthe team. I didn\u2019t know him before that, but I knew him after that, after the\nOlympics where he resided in New Rochelle and where I resided with my family\nin New Rochelle, New York.",
        "A: I used to see him on occasion, because he was a sprinter. And I used to see Sam\nStoller also. Incidentally Sam Stoller, is Sam Stoller dead?",
        "A: A nice fellow. Very nice fellow. Very friendly, as all the athletes that were on\nthe team were all very friendly, all very cordial, all very accommodating. Which\nis like one big happy family.\nQ; Was there anything that set him apart in your mind/",
        "A: No. No. He was just another, he was just another athlete like all the rest of them\nthat were over there to win, win a gold medal and I was very, very sorry that he\ndidn\u2019t get that opportunity to do so.\nA; The closing ceremonies at the, at the, the closing ceremonies at Berlin? Yes.\nYes.",
        "A: It was very, very exciting. The closing ceremonies were very, very exciting\nbecause I, because I witnessed the closing ceremonies on the, on the other, other\nOlympic games that I attended. But, but this one was, was much more important\nbecause I was part of it. And they put on quite a show. Quite a show.",
        "A: Well the closing, well they uh had the, had the, had the, had the athletes. Of\ncourse one thing about the closing ceremonies. The closing ceremonies are not as\nexciting as the opening ceremonies because a lot of the athletes after competing\ngo home. So not the whole team, the whole team is never there at the closing\nceremonies. So therefore uh it, it\u2019s not quite as exciting as the opening\nceremonies when they march in, each country with their flag and of course with\nthe Olympic flag preceding all, preceding everything, you see. The five ring\n26\n27\nOlympic flag. But uh it\u2019s not, as I said, it\u2019s not as exciting, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s still\nexciting for those who participated in the closing ceremonies.",
        "A: Well it looked like uh a closing ceremony. That\u2019s all I can say. I don\u2019t know\nwhat you\u2019re",
        "A: Well the opening ceremony\u2019s when all these various nations, all these, all these uh\nOlympic athletes representing all these var, various nations march in. The host,\nthe host, the host country athletes march in last. It\u2019s all set up you know, it\u2019s all\nset, it\u2019s all organized. And, of course, all these countries, it\u2019s, it\u2019s preceded by the\nOlympic flag, the five ring flag. And of course right after they march in and the\ngames are, are declared open, they have pigeons. And they release all these\npigeons and they all fly, and that\u2019s the opening of the games. It\u2019s beautiful.",
        "A: On the field. As part of the American team. We came in with our white trousers,\nblue jackets and straw hats, with a red, red, white and blue band. White shirt and,\nand I forget what our tie, I think our tie was, I think our tie was, I think our tie\nwas white if I recall. We just, it\u2019s been a little while. But I remember, I\nremember, I remember the hat. I remember the jacket and I remember the\ntrousers. And of course white shoes.",
        "A: Oh, felt good, felt good. You know you always, always felt good marching in a\nparade. Always did. It, it, it, it kind of does something to you.\nQ; It was. It was.\nA; It was a very beautiful track, very fine track. It was made with some kind of red\nuh red dirt, red cinders or something. It was different. It was very different than,\nthan, than the tracks here in America at that particular time. And when I was over\nthere for the 50\" anniversary and I got a chance to, to visit the track again, that\ntrack was still in excellent condition. All the facilities that the Germans built for\n27\n28\nthe 1936 Olympic games, they did a marvelous job. A marvelous job and\neverything was still intact, even today, even today.\n29\n29\n30\n30\n"
