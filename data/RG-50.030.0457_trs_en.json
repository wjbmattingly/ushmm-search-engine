        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Anita Sockol,\nconducted by Amy Reuben, on August 13, 1999, in Washington, D.C.. This is tape number one,\nside A. Would you begin by telling me your name, now and at birth, as well as where you were\nborn, and when you were born?",
        "Answer: My name now is Anita Sockol, and I was born in Berlin, September 17\", 1927. My\nname at birth, is that what you asked -- was Plachte, P-l-a-c-h-t-e, Anita Plachte.",
        "Q: Can you tell me something about your family? Did you have any siblings, and can you tell me\nabout your parents?",
        "A: My parents -- no, I didn\u2019t have any siblings. My parents were Margaret and Ludwig Plachte.\nMy mother\u2019s maiden name is Schindler. And 1s -- they were both born in Berlin, which I think\nthey were quite proud of, which tells you something. And --",
        "Q: What about their personalities can you -- can you tell me?",
        "A: My father was sort of a -- a bachelor when he got married. He was a -- I don\u2019t -- He was a\ngood man, a decent man, but not full of humor. And bu -- quite set in his ways. He got married\nwhen he was 40, and he was 42 when they had me. And my mother was 27 when she got\nmarried, and was anxious to get out of Kemnets. She told me many, many times, that she got\nmarried to him very quickly, you know, he asked her to marry him, and she wanted to marry to\nget to Berlin, that\u2019s what she wanted. So, but she was fun loving. She had a sense of humor, and\nI think my father sort of kept her down, or at least it wa -- it -- that\u2019s how it seemed to me. He\nwas a, as we Say today, a ca -- mut -- a bit of a control freak. Or maybe more than a bit.",
        "Q: Can you tell me something about the neighborhood where you were growing up in Berlin?",
        "A: I can see the house in my mind\u2019s eye. It was, you know, I -- I would say like upper middle\nclass, and it had a -- there was a park nearby, by Rushaplatz, or was it just a real -- a playground\nwith a par -- I\u2019m not quite sure. Not a big park, because Berlin has very big parks, that\u2019s not one\n-- one of them. But it was like a comfortable neighborhood, and I know that Albert Einstein lived\nnearby somewhere. My mother used to tell me that, not that I knew who he was at the time, but I\nknew he was somebody important. And I guess that was a different neighborhood, but where my\n-- when my parents got married, not that same building that -- that I grew up in, when they got\nmarried, before they had me, they lived in a noybow, as they called it, you know, a new building,\nand Marlena Dietrich lived in that building. These are things that were told to me, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you describe the -- the home where you were growing up, in more detail?",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s -- 1-1t was a very nice, spacious apartment, with long hallways, you know, and 1-it\nseemed to me like it was quite large, and I know there were -- there was a -- what do you call\nthat? Like bells that you could ring, you know, and it would ring in the back, in the -- near the\nkitchen, like which room the maid was supposed to come and s -- I was very impressed with this,\nI think, cause I still remember it. But it was, you know, middle class, nothing ultra fancy. I don\u2019t\neven remember -- I guess it did have an elevator, the building. Yeah, it must have. I can see\nmyself walking into the building, and yet it -- it\u2019s murky.",
        "Q: Are there any sounds, or any smells that remind you of that home after -- after leaving there?\nAnything that\u2019s come up in the years after?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I -- Sounds perhaps, but I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know. I -- I remember feeling fear\nwhen they\u2019d leave me alone at night, that I remember. Too early for a young child, at least for\nme it was. But I don\u2019t -- because you said sounds, that\u2019s what made me think of it, because I\u2019d\nhear things that probably weren\u2019t even happening, but in my mind they were. Creaking sounds or\nsomething, and I was frightened to be alone, five or six, or something.",
        "Q: Had your parents gone out for the evening, and left you with a guardian of some sort?",
        "A: No, I -- I think I was alone, at least that\u2019s what I remember. It must have been later on, when\nyou couldn\u2019t -- you know, weren\u2019t allowed to have a maid any more.",
        "Q: And what do you know about the neighborhood? Who else lived in the immediate area? Was\nthis a Jewish area of Berlin? A Jewish quarter of sorts?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but somehow I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think it was -- no, they were well\nintegrated. I\u2019m sure there were Jews living around, but it was -- a-as far as I ca -- I remember,\nwhen I\u2019d visit a friend, it was pretty far away, it was -- because this -- the school that I went to\nwas a Jewish school. But, I don\u2019t think so, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like saying, you know, where I live now in\nManhattan, do I live in a Jewish neighborhood? No, I don\u2019t. A lot of Jews live there, but it\u2019s not\na Jewish neighborhood. I think that\u2019s how it was in Berlin, because I didn\u2019t really think that\nanything was going to happen. Thank you very much.",
        "Q: Can you tell me where your school was located, and also in relation to where you were,\ngrowing up?",
        "A: No, I -- I can\u2019t tell you. I-It was called -- I -- I can tell you what it was called, Prinsagetten\nTemple, which was a synagogue, and they had a school. But where it was in relation to my\nhouse, I can\u2019t remember. How did I get there every day? I can\u2019t remember. I -- Doesn\u2019t --\nnothing comes to mind.",
        "Q: Do you have many memories of being in your home? Being with your parents, eating meals,\nobserving any holidays? I realize that you were young, at the time, but do you have any\nmemories like that?",
        "A: Iremember -- I remember meals in our dining room, I can see the dining room in my -- in my\nmind, but holidays, I think we were -- we were not very religious. My mother was, she always\nwent to -- always went to synagogue on the high holidays, and she always fasted on Yom\nKippur, that was very important to her, and she -- somehow she carried that through to, you\nknow, very late in life, in New York. And I don\u2019t remember her making holiday meals. We must\nhave been invited, or something. I know we were invited here. It wasn\u2019t like, you know, she\ninvited people over. She was not that much of a housewife, or cook, you know, to -- to cook for\nmany people was not her thing. And my father didn\u2019t care, you know, as far as holidays were\nconcerned.",
        "Q: Did the three of you go to synagogue as a family?",
        "A: Someti -- I remember them being there, being at that synagogue, for -- but it must have been\nfor me, cause it was Purim or something, and probably something that parents should attend, so\nit was more for parents attending than for the holidays, and yet that isn\u2019t quite true. She had a\nBible, and sh -- I think I have it at home still -- that she used, but I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a little confused\nwhether that was in the United States, or there.",
        "Q: Did you have other relatives in Berlin, and were they living close by?",
        "A: I had my father\u2019s brother, and his wife. That\u2019s my Uncle Martin and Tanta Trudy. I never\ncalled her aunt, cause I never saw her again, Tanta Trude, and my cousin, Ilsa. They had one\ndaughter, and I was very fond of her, very close to her, or wanted to be, because I was an only\nchild, and I was not very happy about that, so I wanted to think of her as a sister, was happy\nwhen once in awhile we\u2019d get some dresses that were the same dress, you know, in -- 1n our\nrespective sizes. But they lived -- I know they lived a subway ride away, and I -- I think I once\nwent there. It was sort of as if we lived in Manhattan, and they lived in Brooklyn kind of thing.\nThat\u2019s what I s -- remember, and they were more modest -- had a more modest income, and I\ndon\u2019t know what he did for a living, but -- but we didn\u2019t -- I -- I didn\u2019t see her as often as I would\nhave liked. She went to a different school, and she was a little older than I was, and -- but I -- I\nwanted to se -- to -- to -- wanted more of a connection. Why we didn\u2019t, I -- I\u2019m not quite sure. I\nwas really a lonely child.",
        "Q: What other friendships do you remember from Berlin?",
        "A: I remember Hi-Hilda Lerbenthal, Lowenthal. She was at one -- somebody in my class, who I\nwas good friends with, and she had a large family, so that must have been fairly -- she had a\nyounger brother and two older brothers, and it was like a happy household, and I loved going\nthere, because it was a lot going on, and you know, played with her brothers, and attention was\npaid, and meals of mi-milk and cookies, or whatever. And then I had a friend named Levia\nAronfeld, who I\u2019ve seen in New York, I\u2019ve run into her, and she had -- I -- I recognized her,\nwhich was really quite something. And another person, Marion Faulk. There were quite a few.\nEva Simon. I re -- just remember these names, and I did have birthday parties, yes, that I\nremember, had birthday parties, my mother made me birthday parties, and she had these lovely\nlittle cups and saucers, each one was different from another. I have just a couple of them left, I\nhave them in my den, cause they -- eventually they chipped and broke, and this and that, but I li -\n- I loved them, and it\u2019s serving -- served us cocoa in those cups, you know, each one, they were\nvery pretty, china, you know, each one was totally different from the other. We called them\nZameltussen. And maybe something will come to mind about holidays, but -- I remember a\nChristmas tree that she sa -- bre -- she got for when we had a maid, because she wanted it, you\nknow, and she did it for her, we had a Christmas tree. Of course, no Christ-like ornaments on it,\nbut it had something on it, jelly rings, or something, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Was the maid living with you full time at your home?",
        "A: Yes, yes, she was, because there was a room off the kitchen, a small room, and that was\nEmma\u2019s room, that was the first one that I remember.",
        "Q: While you were living in Berlin, were there more than -- was there more than one maid that\nyou recall?",
        "A: Yes, there was another one after that, named Lotte, and she was also there for quite a few\nyears. I think she was there until it was prohibited to have maids. Then they said they could have\nJewish maids, but I think that never came off, that I can remember.",
        "Q: And what do you remember about your interaction with the maids that you knew in Berlin?",
        "A: They were my friends, I mean I -- I sa -- I use the word maids, you know, I -- I shouldn\u2019t\nreally, it\u2019s -- they were like my -- what\u2019s the word -- like my companions, not really a -- they\nwere like my babysitters, you know, my nursemaids 1s a better -- even though they did do the\ncleaning, I think, dishes, I don\u2019t remember having any other -- anyone else in help. But my\nmother was very nervous when I was born, I know that, she\u2019s told me that, and she gave me\naway, sh -- and I always thought, f-for years, until I -- til my late years, you know, that my\nfriends who are psycho -- psychologists and -- and social workers said, \u201cYou know, that wasn\u2019t\nreally such a terrific thing.\u201d She thought she did a wonderful thing, she didn\u2019t have enough milk,\nand she gave me away to a clinic. Clinic is not what a clinic 1s here. Clinic is like a private thing\nwhere they -- Dr. Lungstein, she told me, out in -- it was a good distance, and she said she went\nthere several times a week to see me, and they had a -- what do you call them, wet -- wet nurses,\nbecause she thought that I wasn\u2019t going to -- going to make it, or something. I -- I don\u2019t know if\nany of this really was necessary or true, but that\u2019s what she did, and that\u2019s what she told me. But\nit\u2019s sort of interesting, you know, as a mother and grandmother when I look back on this, and\nwhat did that really mean, to give away a newborn, and I said, \u201cHow long was that?\u201d And she --\nIt was like a half a year, which is sort of mind-boggling.",
        "Q: Do you remember as a child being close to both your mother and father, or more so to one?",
        "A: I remember being closer to my mother, yes, definitely to my mother.",
        "Q: What kind of work did your father do?",
        "A: He was a manufacturer of dresses and blouses, that was a -- I guess a common combination in\n-- in the garment area, in Berlin in those days, dresses and blouses, yes.",
        "Q: And did your mom stay at home with you?",
        "A: Yes, she stayed at home. She -- She didn\u2019t work, no.",
        "Q: And, do you have any specific memories of -- of any -- any interactions with the maids that\nyou knew well during those times, or -- I know that you seem to have fond memories of them,\nbut anything in -- specific that you recall?",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Can you actually tell me what you remember, as far as the layout of your home, when you\nentered? I think you were mentioning this.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, 1-it -- it -- it -- to m -- to me, 1t seemed as if -- to me it seems now, like it was\nquite a large apartment. When you came in t -- 1-it was a long -- there was a corridor to the first\nroom, was my room, which was a -- as you -- as you came into the apartment, and then there was\na living room, and a hamsimmer, as my mother called it, with a schockladenshun, which she had\na key to, it means it was -- that\u2019s where she kept the chocolates, and they were like a treat when\nyou got some. And then the dining room, and then a long hallway, which led to the room that the\nhousekeeper had, and then the kitchen. And I think that was it, but it seemed very large. Maybe\nthey were very spacious rooms. It was sort of an elegant apartment, the way I remember it.",
        "Q: Did you have friends in the neighborhood? It sounds like you mostly have friends at school.\nAny friends in the neighborhood that you recall?",
        "A: Not that I recall -- I don\u2019t recall going, you know, upstairs or downstairs, or next building or\nsomething, to play with anyone. I\u2019m sure I must have, I -- I don\u2019t know, I must have blocked it or\nsomething, but I don\u2019t remember doing it.",
        "Q: Do you remember having non-Jewish friends in Berlin, or even knowing if a friend 1s not\nJewish at the time?",
        "A: Hm, it\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t really know the answer. I guess maybe I was --\nmaybe I was subliminally aware of it, or even if you didn\u2019t speak about it, because right from the\nbeginning, I went to a -- I was sent to a Jewish school, and I knew why.",
        "Q: You were told why you were being sent there?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yes.",
        "Q: What did your -- What did your parents tell you?",
        "A: They wanted me to escape the anti-Semitism. They were afraid for the an-anti-Semitism, so\nthat was -- I\u2019m trying to think, 1933 or something, six years old. I don\u2019t know when you begin\nschool, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember already having an awareness of anti-Semitism, besides what your parents\nwere telling you about sending you to this school?",
        "A: I was aware of it. Now, I don\u2019t know if it was before, or after entering school, or it was\nsimultaneous, but I do remember, I remember parades, and marches, and -- and you know, those\nbanners, and flags, and -- and Hitler going -- I f -- remember seeing Hitler going through the\nstreets with a -- you know, and that\u2019s -- I -- I -- maybe I\u2019ve heard it on -- on the radio, cause I\nprobably didn\u2019t wi -- makes sense that I didn\u2019t read the paper, but we did have a radio, and you\u2019d\nhear that screeching voice that we all know. Yes, I had strange feel -- I -- you certainly did feel\nit, but at the same time, we went to the movies, and I remember -- what was that place -- and it\nwas a -- where there was a big movie theater, in the center. It must have been near -- what was\nthat [indecipherable] main street there. Kudam.",
        "Q: Kuf -- Kuffus.",
        "A: Yeah, Kuffus and dam, yeah, that\u2019s what the Berliners call it, Kudam, Krufust and dam, and\nthere was a movie that I was -- aside from Shirley Temple, I was fascinated by the Dionne\nquintuplets, and I can still see like a big advertisement, you know, above -- the marquis above\nthe mo-movie theater, like a painting or -- or a photograph, or whatever, huge, about those five\nquintuplets, and Gene Herschels, was an actor or something, who played the doctor -- or was he\nthe doctor -- I -- I --who -- who delivered them. Anyway, the whole thing fascinated me. You\u2019re\nbringing out very strange things in me, Amy.",
        "Q: Did you have any experience of somebody in Berlin being anti-Semitic toward you,\npersonally? Any recollection of anything like that?",
        "A: I was always -- I was -- it -- 1t was like a -- like a feeling, like a -- I ca -- I can\u2019t e -- with -- I --\nI don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember. I -- I -- I don\u2019t remember anybody calling me names, or I\nmight have blocked it -- or hitting me, or sa -- or anything like that, but it was a feeling of\ncaution, and always being told not to make waves, be careful, don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that, and --\nand that kind of thing, 1t was more that. But I guess I felt comfortable as far as anti-Semitism was\nconcerned, in the school. Not that I was happy in the school.",
        "Q: Tell me more about your experiences at school. Why weren\u2019t you happy?",
        "A: I was just not happy in the school. I -- I did not -- I was not a good student, I felt very\nisolated, I felt lonely, I felt like an unhappy child, and -- I -- also I did not like Hebrew -- Hebrew\nlessons. I wasn\u2019t good in it, I didn\u2019t like it, I didn\u2019t want to take it. I -- I was -- I did -- I didn\u2019t\nenjoy school, I didn\u2019t feel popular, you know how youngsters have to feel popular. All that came\nmuch later in America.",
        "Q: Did you talk to your mom or your dad about these feelings, do you remember? Express\nanything to them?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I -- They were not that -- those kind of parents as they are today, or maybe then\nas well, but that\u2019s, I guess, where their age came in. They were very -- not psychologically\noriented. I don\u2019t think if -- if I did, that it didn\u2019t get me anywhere. They were the kind of parents\nthat my mother used to tell me, you know, as -- as, I have a headache -- children don\u2019t get\nheadaches, and that was the end of that, and that her mother said to her, translating it into\nEnglish, if she had a -- a sore throat, her mother would give her a scarf, put 1t around your neck\nand go to school, kind of thing. And -- What else did her mother say? She\u2019d always tell me that\n[indecipherable] in a -- pestering her the way kids do, I\u2019m thirsty, I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m hungry. She\nsays, \u201cWell then, lick a little salt, and you\u2019ll be thirsty, too.\u201d You know, it\u2019s sort of in fun, but\nnot -- not paying all that much attention to children\u2019s emotions.",
        "Q: Do you have recollection of the first time that you learned about Hitler?",
        "A: No, not really. Her -- I -- I remember something about -- again, it must be the radio, or my\nparents talking, or people talking, about these elections, and that it\u2019s -- it\u2019I] blow over, or they\nwere upset about the election, and I don\u2019t even know what year that was, \u201932 was it, that he came\ninto power? But like most people said, and like you he -- see in movies now, you know, on that\nsubject, like it\u2019ll blow over, and that crazy guy, and it\u2019s -- and that\u2019s just exactly how it was,\nthat\u2019s how I remember it, that this was like an aberration.",
        "Q: But you do actually, at some point, have more memories of hearing him on the radio, or\nseeing him in these parades.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: What other -- What other memory is related to Hitler, and maybe some of the either SS\ntroopers, or people in the street that you saw?",
        "A: Well, I -- I remember going out to -- my father was very fond of going out to gunavagdet, was\none of those big parks, park and woods combination, cause Berlin is very large, and we\u2019d do that\nvery often, every Sunday. Not that -- I didn\u2019t like it, but that\u2019s what we did. And then had to\nhave a caf\u00e9 in there, and you could sit down and have cake, and something to drink. And at a\ntable very nearby, was Herman Goering, with his wife and kids. I think he had two. And when\nmy father saw that -- and I knew that that was like a very bad thing, I -- I f -- without having\nexplained too much to me, I don\u2019t know wh-what I knew, or what he was going to be doing, but\nhe paid the check, and we left there very quickly, I do remember that. And I remember another\nincident that -- with my Uncle Heinrich, my mother\u2019s brother, th -- who had the nerve, or maybe\nit was foolishness, to -- when they came around with a collection box, when the parade was\ngoing by, the Nazi parade, that he too -- he had a button in his pocket, and he put a button into\nthis box instead of money, which was a very dangerous thing to do. He told that -- you know,\nseemed like adventuresome, as long as he got away with it.",
        "Q: Did people, either your parents, or other family members, start talking much about Hitler and\nNazis in your presence?",
        "A: I think they tried to shield me. Th-They did try to shield me from all this. It may not have\nbeen, you know, the most demonstrative, and affectionate -- although my mother was\naffectionate -- parents, but I think they were -- they did want to shield me from this, and things\nare murky because they didn\u2019t really explain things, didn\u2019t really talk to me about these things,\neven as I got older, because after all, I was -- by the time we were leaving, it -- I was 10. And\nthey also spoke -- and this was laughable, they spoke in English, in fr -- it\u2019s laughable because I -\n- when I learned English, I realized how little English they knew, but they talked in some kind of\nlanguage which I think was English, that I shouldn\u2019t understand. That was one of their, you\nknow, ways of -- that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s politics, money, children don\u2019t have to know these things, you\nknow. And I di -- It wasn\u2019t somebody that I -- I don\u2019t think I found it easy to confide in my\nparents. I -- Actually, I never really did, not to the day they died.",
        "Q: Did they speak Yiddish at home as well?",
        "A: No, no Yiddish, no, cause they were both born in Berlin, and they -- no Yiddish.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea how they had learned English, whatever English they\u2019d learned by that\npoint?",
        "A: Well, I know that th -- a-actually they sent me for -- 1t wasn\u2019t very long, nor successful, but\nthey send me for some English lessons, in Berlin, while I was still there, and maybe they had\ntaken some lessons, but I know they had these books, which I have to this day, I took it from my\nmother\u2019s house, she took it with her when we left, and it\u2019s called towsenwater English, and it\u2019s\ngot like little pamphlets in a holder, and it\u2019s like, you know, when you go to another country,\nthose simple phrases, and maybe they -- but I can\u2019t imagine that they just bought them, and were\nself taught, they probably took some lessons, I don\u2019t know why.",
        "Q: Would you say that your parents, either one or both, were very politically interested, or\ninvolved?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Certainly not my mother. And I don\u2019t think my father was either. I think my\nfather was interested, you know, as far as the newspaper and radio is concerned, but not\npolitically involved, but interested in what was going on, had to be. [inaudible]\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an interview with Anita Sockol. I was wondering if you\nwould tell me more about your vacations with your family, also perhaps your visits to camp, as a\nyoung child.",
        "A: Those were nice memories. I remember going to a resort called Shpindlermueller, which is in\nCzechoslovakia, with my parents, and I -- and I liked that very much, and I think I had kids to\nplay with there, and beautiful scenery, and they also sent me to some camp, I don\u2019t reme --\nmaybe it was in -- in the Hartz, A -- H-a-r-t-z, or z, I\u2019m not even su -- it\u2019s some kind of mountain\nrange, I\u2019m not sure where it was, but it was a children\u2019s camp. And I remember one time, this\nwas a fond memory of my father and myself, which was that one winter afternoon or something,\nI came into my parent\u2019s bedroom, and they had a surprise for me, and what was the surprise?\nThat my fa-father was taking me to -- with th -- just he and I were going away in the winter, to a\n-- he was going to go skiing or something, and he was leaving me at a camp. They had winter\ncamps, because in Germany, vacations are different than here. We didn\u2019t have a summer\nvacation from, you know, all of June, July and August. They were shorter, but the winter\nvacations were longer, so you had a winter camp. I don\u2019t know how much I enjoyed that camp,\nwhile learning how to ski, not so much, but I was thrilled to go away with him, and I remember\nan incident, we were very cold, we got off a train or something, on the way to this camp, and we\nwere on a -- like a toboggan with some guy, you know, going through the snow, and it was -- it\nwas great, and I was freezing, and he got some brandy or something, and he gave me a little sip\nof this to warm me up, and it was just like -- it was thrilling, that\u2019s how I remem -- remember tt.\nAnd then, I guess, eventually he came and picked me up, and maybe it was a week or something,\nit\u2019s -- I -- I don\u2019t know how long. A week, 10 days, in this children\u2019s camp, in the snow, in the\nwinter. But it was -- I just felt very privileged to be alone with my father.",
        "Q: Do you have an idea of how old you were at that point?",
        "A: I would say about eight, I imagine. Didn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with Nazis, or with\nsomething that you could do, and all these things were -- were possible, you know, a -- it\u2019s -- I --\nI -- | imagine I\u2019m -- would have been that age, I don\u2019t think they would have sent me away much\nyounger than that, though it couldn\u2019t have been too much older, because by 10 -- by 10 years old,\nwe were leaving.",
        "Q: Did you know of any of the economic hard times in the early 30\u2019s, taking place in Berlin and\nGermany?",
        "A: Yes. You mean the -- just the economic hard time -- my father -- they were -- in the 20\u2019s if --\nfrom what I remember my father saying, of course, I didn\u2019t really know it was -- but he used to\ntalk about them all the time. He\u2019d always tell -- he said, you don\u2019t know, he said, what in -- oh,\nmaybe he told it to us -- told it to me here, when I was a youngster, that you have no idea what\nreal inflation 1s like. He said, \u201cWe had baskets full of money,\u201d and I would picture this. And he\nreally meant it literally, like a large basket full of money, that was like toilet paper, it was like\ndevalued maybe, you know, monthly, or whatever. And it took like a -- a shopping bag full to\nbuy a loaf of bread, he says, \u201cThat\u2019s what real inflation was like,\u201d that the money was worth --\nand he s -- and when I say that some sandwich or something was a little skimpy, he said -- he\nwould always say, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it was like. When I was a boy, we would get a slice of\nbread, with butter on it, and there would be a like a smoked piece of salami, or something, and\none thin slice, and we\u2019d move it around for the flavor, from one end to the other.\u2019 Those were\nthe little things, I remember he\u2019d tell me these things. But this was like in general, I\u2019d -- I did not\nexperience any poverty, and that was really, I guess, before. But of course, that -- that period of\ntime really led to Hitler, we all know that.",
        "Q: So it seems that while your father was still working, your family\u2019s financial situation was\nstable?",
        "A: Seems that way to me. It seems to me that in that respect, that my father definitely was -- not\nonly seems, but you know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m here to tell the story. We\u2019ll always be grateful to him that\nhe was very farsighted. As I\u2019ve said before, he was sort of secretive about money and this and\nthat, but 1t seems to me that he must have been kind of sophisticated about money and -- and\nmaybe had some money in -- in Holland, or maybe in America, or -- I don\u2019t know ho-how that\nwas done, it was never told to me, even later on, when I used to ask, but in some way, that we\ncould manage to be self sufficient, and get out without another person really vouching for us. It\u2019s\n-- You know, it was no such thing as welfare, nor would we have dreamt of such a thing, but -- to\nget into the country, but we were very, very, very lucky, because as I read and see things at Ellis\nIsland, reading history and how a few, you know, percentage-wise, how few Jews really were\nable to get out and come here, and be accepted in the United States the way we were, and I read\nthat it was -- I don\u2019t want to minimize the number, I forget, was it total 200,000 or something? It\nwas a very small number. Or maybe less, I don\u2019t know what that fi -- correct figure was, but I\nfeel very, very, very fortunate and that [indecipherable] in to this history in words that I can\u2019t\neven express. As I get older, I think about it more and more.",
        "Q: Were you aware, as a growing child, of the changes once the Nazis came to power? So there\u2019s\n1933, of course, as a pivotal point in time, when Hitler comes to power, and then, just to go\nforward for a moment, I know that you remained with your family in Berlin, until 1938. So,\nduring that five year period, approximately, what would you say you noticed, if anything, as\nchanging, either for your own freedoms, your parents freedoms, for other Jews. What other\nchanges -- you know, did you notice?",
        "A: Well, I guess I noticed I -- as I said that, it was almost you know, that when you see in a\nmovie, nowadays with that green smoke, you know, when they tried to make something like the\ncreeping crud, you know, it\u2019s something that you just felt, not to make waves, to -- don\u2019t draw\nattention to yourself. You see the Nazis walking around. The -- Then there was the issue about --\nthat I knew that my favorite, Lotte, had to leave, and no more maids. But as I said, my parents\nwere secretive, trying to keep that from me, I th -- and my mother became very, very nervous\nand depressed, and I think she had what we would really call, in layman\u2019s terms, a nervous\nbreakdown, before -- she did not want to leave Berlin. She really didn\u2019t want to leave, and then\nshe -- there was a period there when my father left -- he left for Holland, because that was -- I\nguess it was beginning of \u201938. I don\u2019t know how long he was gone, when he had to leave his\nbusiness. I don\u2019t think he sold it, he split up with his partner, he had a partner. Plachte and\nSolomon was the name of the firm, and could no longer do business, and he left for Holland.\nAnd my mother sent me to some -- I was on the outskirts of Berlin, at some friends of her\u2019s\nhome, with other girls in some room, and I -- I lived there for awhile. Oh, and right before that, I\nhad my appendix taken out, and to this day, I don\u2019t know if it was really necessary, or if I -- it\nwas one of those hysterical things, that I drew attention to myself, that I said I needed it, I -- that\nI had pain. I -- I don\u2019t know. But I did have it taken out, and I had to -- in those days you stayed\nin the hospital for a week, you know, with the sandbags on the -- on the incision. And then I\nwent to those -- this house, somebody else\u2019s apartment, it was sort of out in the suburbs of\nBerlin, while my mother, I guess, did something or other with the apartment, but I had to be\naway, and -- and then eventually, she and I left to go to join my father, hopefully, but --",
        "Q: Did you hear anything about things like the boycott in 1933, maybe later, since you were so\nyoung in 1933. Did you hear anything about the boycott against Jewish businesses in 1933, while\nyou were in Germany\u201d?",
        "A: In 1933, I was only six years old. I\u2019m just thinking back. I -- Not per se, and of course they\ndidn\u2019t -- in -- in Berlin, I -- I have the impression, maybe incorrectly, but I think that things in a\nquote unquote, sophisticated urban center like Berlin, that things came more slowly to Berlin, as\nfar as, you know, real trouble and prejudice, it -- it came more slowly than in the little towns in --\nin Bavaria, and other little places, where people emigrated much sooner, those that did, and felt it\nmore. I think so. So, I -- I\u2019m not sure, but at the same time, my -- I would hear my father talking\nwith my -- it -- it -- 1t\u2019s -- it\u2019s a ch -- a child -- from a child\u2019s impression of -- that he was\nworking on something, trying -- you know, leaving. This was not done overnight, I\u2019m sure. One\nda -- you know, I -- I -- we left just like that, but I\u2019m sure this was planned in some way, and\nsecretively. And the children in the school, in the classes, they would just sort of disappear. One\nwould -- You know, this -- it wasn\u2019t something that was talked about. They were just, those that\ncould, left, and I think it was understood in the school, you know, one day would be one, one\nway would be another, and then you found out they went to Argentina, or this one went to\nShanghai or wherever, Australia. Or maybe I found that out afterwards, I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not sure\nmyself.",
        "Q: Did you ever encounter any Hitler youth?",
        "A: Yes, I do remember them, and I wanted -- funny little things that come to your mind, I wanted\nlong hair. I wanted my hair in braids, just like all those ger -- little German girls, and my mother\nwouldn\u2019t let me, because the Hitler youth girls had their hair in -- in braids, and what they called\nuffenshawkern, which means monkey swings, which is if you take a braid, long braid, and then\nyou make it -- you double it and make a loop, and then they had bows, you know, and kind of\ncute, and I admired it, but she would never let me have my hair long, which bothered me, and I\ndid see a lot of Hitler youth, young boys and girls. I remember their outfits with the -- with the\nkerchief and a leather knot, sort of like boy scouts, and yet not like boy scouts, oh yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember asking about the Hitler youth, and -- and who were they, and what they\ndid? Did you remember any discussions with friends or family?",
        "A: Now that you mention it -- you have such interesting questions, but I -- I think I did. But, I\nthink I was told again, in -- in that secret way, like -- like you know, somebody say, it\u2019s not for\nyou, don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t -- li -- it was something bad, but I don\u2019t think they went into detail, I don\u2019t\nthink. Don\u2019t remember any specific answers.",
        "Q: Although, what you were just describing about the braids, and that you wanted braids --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- like that, do you think that you -- do you think that your mother actually told you, you can\u2019t\nhave these braids because they are Hitler you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- I mean, did she connect the braids with Hitler youth?",
        "A: Yes, I think she did, I think she did, and she had my hair shingled in the back, just the way I\nalways hated it.",
        "Q: So as you were growing a little bit older as a child, were you aware of any official growing\nrestrictions on Jew\u2019s freedoms? The Nuremberg laws in \u201935, and any other restrictions? I realize\nthat you were at a Jewish school, but of course some -- some people were not allowed to go to\nswimming pools, you know, certain things that may have affected you if you were not, perhaps,\nin a Jewish school.",
        "A: I think they ch -- my parents must have tried to circumvent that, you know, that if you\ncouldn\u2019t go to a pool, then we went out to Vunzi, or -- or for some -- there were a lot of lakes and\n-- and things, outside of Berlin. It\u2019s a huge city, you know, and it\u2019s surroundings. Remember all\nthese outings, and going to rowboats and stuff with my father, and I have pictures of myself in --\nname comes to mind, and that -- one of the pictures that I just gave you, 1n a place called Pinz,\nbut that was a resort, yeah, you know in bay -- I don\u2019t have the f -- I -- except for those, what\nhappened later on with the yellow benches, in -- in that -- by Rushanplatz, and it was not safe to\nplay there any more, and that you had to pay to sit down, or something, that somehow was, for\nmy mother, you know, 1-it was like the end, like something was really happening, but they did\nshield me from it.",
        "Q: Can you describe more what you remember from that time period, with respect to the\nbenches?",
        "A: Ah, it\u2019s -- this is before you had to wear a star, that happened later, but the benches -- and\nthere were benches in the park that were painted yellow, for Jews to sit on, and it was like, you\nknow, when, from out of nowhere, you know, now in retrospect it may not seem so terrible, but\nif you imagine it, you know, it was like a noose tightening, it just seemed incredible, you know,\nand -- and who is going to sit on those benches? And I -- I do remember that, and that must have\nbeen shortly -- I\u2019m sure there were other things happening at the time, oth-other restrictions, but I\ndon\u2019t remember what they were. I ju -- I just can\u2019t think of it, but it -- it ust felt very\nuncomfortable, you know, every day. And my cousins, I didn\u2019t see them -- my cousin, rather,\njust one, because my other cousins lived elsewhere, lived in different cities, Kreenesbergen. But\nthe one that I mentioned, my father\u2019s brother\u2019s -- the Plachtes, she had problems in her school,\ntoo, but I don\u2019t remember what they really were.",
        "Q: Do you remember sitting on one of those benches yourself?",
        "A: No. I think that m-my -- my mother didn\u2019t allow it, we wouldn\u2019t do it.",
        "Q: And was there a fee associated with those who would sit on those benches?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no.",
        "Q: You told me a little bit about friends that you remember, and I\u2019m wondering, as you were\ngetting a little bit older now, and before you left Berlin, if you remember any other friendships\nfrom that time period, or maybe you\u2019 ve already told me of the friends you remember the most,\nbut from your sort of seven year old, eight year old, nine year old period.",
        "A: The people that I remember were mainly in that class, they were all girls, because it was -- I\nguess it was all girl\u2019s classes, boys must have been in a different class, and if I had that picture\nthat I have of -- several picture -- I\u2019d -- I don\u2019t think they\u2019re here, I think I have them at home, I\ncan name those girls quite well. And what -- what did you ask me, about --",
        "Q: Just wondering if there were any other friend-friendships that you remember from this time\nframe, of being around seven year old, you know, seven, eight, nine years old in Berlin, or\nmaybe you already covered that before, when I asked about friends before.",
        "A: Well, you know, I gave the Holocaust Museum my autograph album, and in there you can see\nwhat they wrote, you know, and in those days it was not done like here, it was really something.\nWhen you gave somebody an autograph album, they took it home, they wrote very carefully,\nthey drew little pictures, or -- or put on decals, and as you can see, it\u2019s really quite interesting,\nand they didn\u2019t take it lightly, not scribbled in, as you can see the contrast, you\u2019 ll see fa -- I have\nsome from junior high school in New York, and you just scribbled whatever. I wish you -- I wish\nyou luck, I wish you that, da-da da-da, and one 15, and just went on, you know, from public\nschool to junior high school. No gus -- A-And you could -- Some of them sort of wished me\nwell, and when you read the poems in German, you realize that they were -- it was sort of like\nthe end of something, like they were -- we were going to part, you say, well, we\u2019re just little\ngirls, it wasn\u2019t like we were going on to high school, or something. It was like as if we were\ngoing to part.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the first time you remember your parents talking to you about the possibility of\nleaving your home, leaving Berlin?",
        "A: Again, an interesting question. I really don\u2019t remember, yi -- they were, again, not the kind of\nparents that would discuss anything with me, and I just -- and I never really questioned it, even in\nmy -- until my young adulthood. You know, they were what they were, and I had to do what they\nsaid, and I was not -- my opinion was not considered, or -- it was like a fait accompli. And, but I\nthink by the time I went where my mother send me, to that home that seems so blurry in my\nmind, with these other girls who lived there, I know somebody a -- I guess she was unraveling\nher apartment situation, or selling furniture, or -- I don\u2019t know what she was doing while I was\naway in the suburbs. That\u2019s when I realized -- and also at -- at the same time, I was recovering\nfrom that appendix surgery, which was quite something the way they -- old-fashioned way that\nthey did it in those days. That\u2019s when I realized that things were really changing, that\u2019s what I\nseem to remember. And then she came and got me, but I don\u2019t remember any real discussions\nthat we were -- nor did -- let me say at this point, that they never expected to go anywhere but to\nHolland. That was the end of the journey, hopefully that we were going to get there, cause that\u2019s\nwhere my father was, they had no intention of going to America, or anywhere else. That seemed\nfar away enough, which sounds crazy today, but not then.",
        "Q: I\u2019m wondering as you grew up in Berlin, did you ever get in trouble with your parents?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure that I did. I\u2019m sure that I did, yeah. It didn\u2019t take much, my father had quite a temper,\nand my mother would often say, \u201cLudwich dus kins,\u201d [indecipherable], cause he had quite a\ntemper and he would smack me and whatnot, yeah, and my mother would try to shield -- shield\nme from him, you know, cause he was -- didn\u2019t -- he had a short fuse. He was a good man, but\nnot cut out for raising a very young child. He was already very set in his ways, you know, and\nvery German. I had a parak -- I was very lonely that I -- I w -- I said that before, but I wanted a\nsister, or a brother, or a dog, or a cat, in that order. And I used to have recurring -- recurrent\ndreams about that, very, very often, and I felt very -- I really wanted that desperately, one --\nwhen I never got it -- didn\u2019t get any of them. I never got a pet either, except for a parakeet, which\nthrilled me, and then one day he -- we let him out of the cage, and I don\u2019t know what was wrong\nwith this bird, I thought he flew around the room, but he s -- flew into the walls until he dropped\ndead, and I -- it was very traumatic for me, it really was, cause that little parakeet -- and that was\nthe end of my pets.",
        "Q: Did you ever ask your mother or father for a sibling?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I did. But my mother always told me, I don\u2019t know if she told me this then -- no,\nprobably not, I was too young, but later, that, she said, \u201cWell, in Hitler time this is -- it was\nfashionable, everybody -- everybody just had one child, cause you never knew what was going to\nhappen.\u201d That\u2019s wh -- I guess she told me that later on. And then I found out much later on,\nwhich made me very angry, that she\u2019d had an abortion after me, and she knew it was a -- a male\nchild, and -- but by that time, I didn\u2019t care, you know, any more. Maybe I was married by then, I\ndon\u2019t know. But she always used to tell me -- and indeed, a lot of the kids that I knew, they were\nsingle ch-children. Not all, but a lot.",
        "Q: Do you have recollection of the 1936 Olympics?",
        "A: Yes, I do. I do remember that. I remember the hoopla, and I am tempted to say I saw it on\ntelevision, but of course that wasn\u2019t true. But I do remember it, now how do I remember it? I\ndon\u2019t know, but I do remember it, and I remember getting one of those Olympic pins. I was very\nproud of that, you know, with the Olympic circles, and -- and I -- I remember it, maybe it was in\nthe newspaper or magazines. Surely it was, it must have been a very big thing in Berlin. And I\neven seem to remember some -- I don\u2019t know, was it then or was it later, it\u2019s hard -- something\nabout, you know, what turned out to be Jesse Owens and Hitler\u2019s disappointment that he won,\nyou know, a bl -- a Black man, cause I remember that you rarely saw one, I -- there were, once in\na blue moon, on the street in Berlin, you would see a -- a Black person, and you\u2019d say, \u201cAh, a\nnigger.\u201d It was like seeing somebody with two heads, it was just -- you just didn\u2019t see that. But I\ndo remember the Olympics and the -- everything that -- the excitement that it was -- you know,\nthat involved in it, probably banners, and who knows what. I can\u2019t say I went there, but I do\nremember it.",
        "Q: So most of your recollections would be positive, if you --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- for instance, didn\u2019t know about what may have been happening with Jewish athletes, with\nAfrican-American athletes, you had mostly positive associations of the Olympics at that time,\nright?",
        "A: I think so, yeah, I think so.",
        "Q: Did you know anything about the anschluss in March of \u201938, which I realize is very soon to\nwhen you would up leaving Berlin, correct? Did you leave in April of \u201938?",
        "A: Yes.",

And her\nspeaking to her brother, something about her brother [indecipherable] and his wife. I didn\u2019t see\nthem very much.

My cousin in Israel, one child,\nMaryAnn from my mother\u2019s sister Ann -- Anna. There were -- In other words, there were three\ngirls and one boy. Heinrich, my mother Margaret, her sister Kate, who went to Theresienstadt.\nHer sister Anna, who managed to go to Palestine. And each one of them had one child, so maybe\nthat\u2019s -- I accepted this one child situation maybe because of them, but where did Margit live? I\nknow that -- that they didn\u2019t make it, and I am going to look it up, either today, or soon, what\nhappened to them. But my mother was concerned about him, was he ill, he had a nervous\nbreakdown or something, all at that time when we were leaving. But you know, I was 10, and\nthey didn\u2019t talk to me, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult, besides the memory, of course. But they really\ndidn\u2019t discuss these things with me.",

        "A: Well, I loved going to the movies, which of course wasn\u2019t very often, but love it, I love it to\nthis day. And I was absolutely crazy about Shirley Temple. She seemed to personify everything\nglamorous, and -- you know, the way people felt about America and Hollywood, and I had, not a\nShirley Temple doll, but I got those -- I guess they were all made for -- for export, like a paper\ndolls, and then you cut them out, and put the clothes on -- on the -- and I played with it for hours.\nAnd then of course, what I had, the way ba -- the way kids here have baseball cards, this was my\nprize possession, they were actual black and white photographs of Shirley Temple in these\ndifferent movies that she was in, which came in sets like baseball cards, and I bought them, and I\nhave a -- and I had a photograph album of her, and also I collected another -- it was a young\nAustrian movie star, her name was Trowdel Stark. And I have this album, I took it with me, I\nhave it to this day, and I probably -- probably nobody else would have it. I should write Shirley\nTemple Black and tell her about her album. And once in awhile, when I see these movies on TV,\nfor instance when she\u2019s wearing a -- when she was seven or eight, whatever, and wearing a satin\npajama with appliqued bunnies on it, and I\u2019ll look at her in this scene, I say, \u201cOh, my God, I\u2019ve\nseen this picture, this photograph of her in that particular outfit so many times, leafing through\nmy album.

        "Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Anita Sockol. Would you continue\ntelling me about your family identifying as Germans?",
        "A: Well, I -- I really, you know, it\u2019s -- I\u2019m sort of embarrassed to talk about it, because it isn\u2019t\nvery nice, but it\u2019s the truth, it\u2019s the way mo -- many Germans felt. I know I have this feeling,\nfrom my father especially, that he -- you could almost say it\u2019s almost like an anti-Semitic feeling\nabout Jews from eastern Europe, you know, with payess, and with, you know, that kind of\nclothing, and all the other accoutrements, I had that feeling, carrying it over to America, that he\nfelt like he was a different kind of Jew, very secular. And didn\u2019t really -- And s-spoke no\nYiddish, I don\u2019t think they were brought up with that. We ate -- my mother\u2019s cooking was not\nparticularly wonderful, not everybody\u2019s mother is a good cook, or a great housekeeper. But when\nwe came here, and I learned, you know, about all these Jewish dishes, I was not used to them\nbecause I never grew -- I never grew up with them -- with these things from eastern Europe like\nlatkas and chopped liver and kasha varnishkas, and -- and -- or anything that was -- you know,\nthat people make, that when they\u2019re kosher, it was very strange to me. And so I would say that\nthat -- maybe that\u2019s also why I don\u2019t remember any -- I don\u2019t remember any seders, per se, in my\nhouse. When we went to seders, they were in New York, in the early days, people that they met.\nNow, we were refugees, and we were at other people\u2019s houses, but it\u2019s not something that we\nhad. And yet, we did go to synagogue somewhere. I -- It\u2019s not clear. I think that\u2019s something I\nwould remember.",
        "Q: Did your family observe Shabbat?",
        "A: No, definitely not.",
        "Q: Will you tell me when you learned that your father had to stop working, and what you learned\nabout that at the time?",
        "A: He -- He could no longer run his business, you know, it -- he was self-employed, and I\nremember something about his breaking up with his partner, maybe the partner was leaving, or\nmaybe he s -- was still able to buy him out, or sell it, or leave it. It\u2019s not clear, but I know that he\nhad to leave that business, and I don\u2019t know if, in 1938, he c -- he could sell the business for any\nkind of -- you know, that had any value, or he just had to walk away from it. This, again, was not\nsomething that they told me. And same with the apartment, you know, I don\u2019t remember. No one\never came to look at it, or to rent it, or you know, and that we would leave the way you would\nnormally do now, if -- it wasn\u2019t that kind of leaving. I think we just left it, that\u2019s what people did.\nAnd my mother had a nervous breakdown over her new dining room set, I remember that she did\nnot want to leave her dining room set behind. We just took some things, you know, that were --\nthat seemed -- that\u2019s how I ended up with these pictures that I have in my autograph album, and\nmy Shirley Temple album, cause those little things were important to me. But, we did not move\nwith -- with furniture, no.",
        "Q: Do you remember the process of packing?",
        "A: No. I think that\u2019s when I was in this other home, don\u2019t remember the process of packing, and\nI was just thinking about it before you asked me, but you know, they\u2019re perfectly logical\nquestions, but for some reason, I don\u2019t remember any of that.",
        "Q: I read from your telephone interview summary, something about you seeing an image of\nHitler in, I believe your superintendent, the building superintendent\u2019s home. Can you tell me\nabout that incident?",
        "A: Yes, I do remember that, cause that was very scary to me. For some reason, I used to go to -- I\nwas friendly with the superintendent of the building -- with the wife of the superintendent, I\ndon\u2019t remember him at all, but I do remember her, and I remember her name. She was a -- I\nguess a middle aged woman, with grown sons. I think she had three children. She must have had\na younger one that I played with, and for some reason, often after school, my mother wasn\u2019t\nhome, I would ring her bell, and I would have some cookies and milk, or some refreshment, and\nshe was very nice to me. And one day, everything changed. I walked into her living room, and I\nse -- now I saw a huge picture of Hitler over her couch in her living room, and her older boys\nwere in SS uniforms, and I knew what that meant, they were in black uniforms, and they were\nvery tall. Course I was just a little kid, I mean they seemed like, you know, really men, scary\nyoung men in that dreaded SS uniform. And then my mother told me I can\u2019t go there any more,\nand it impressed me somehow. I was really frightened.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Mrs. Tetslaff. Yeah, strange how you remember that.",
        "Q: Do you remember her being mean to you?",
        "A: No, but -- not mean, but her attitude changed. Colder.",
        "Q: Do you remember saying goodbye to any of your friends before you left Berlin? Did you have\nthat opportunity to do so?",
        "A: Only those girls in that home. Was there any of my f -- any of my close friends there? I don\u2019t\nknow who those girls were, sleeping in a room with three or four girls, I don\u2019t -- I just -- it\u2019s all\nso weird. And I felt very strange, I knew that something was very wrong, and -- and about to\nchange, but really I -- I do remember saying goodbye to the Lerventhals, Hilda Lerventhal in\nsome way, or maybe they left first, I don\u2019t know. I-It\u2019s a feeling that 1s hard to explain, because\nyou don\u2019t -- it\u2019s all in retrospect, and you -- just things were changing, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not like in\nthe movies, you know, that you say goodbye, and you hug each other, and -- because nobody\nreally knew what was going to happen next, or where they were really going, or for how long,\ncause you didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.",
        "Q: So, when did you leave Berlin for the outskirts, where you were staying in this home? When\nwas that, and how long do you think you were there? What -- What are the memories that you\nhave of being there?",
        "A: I remember being there, I would say about a month, something like that. And also I remember\nthat that appendix surgery was -- it was not a good time, it was er -- already dangerous for me to\nha -- you know, have a doctor operate on me. My mother was not happy with this whole thing,\nand I would say it all must have been at the beginning of 1938, somewhere between the\nbeginning of 1938, and then April, I think we left in April of 1938. Can really tell -- I have given\nyou -- I just thought of it, pictures I -- I -- actually, you have the actual passports, and you could\ncheck in the passport when that really was, if my memory 1s incorrect by the dates that they put\nin there. And of course that was the other thing about the passports, that we had a s -- a statenloss\npassports, stateless, no more German. So there was another thing, I do remember my mother\ntelling me, and I also have my own passport. One day I will find it in my apartment, and when I\ndo, I will give it to the Holocaust Museum, but I\u2019ve looked high and low, I can\u2019t find it. But you\nhave several, you have my father\u2019s and one with a German passport, and one with the stateless.\nAnd I think my mother\u2019s as well, if I\u2019m not mistaken.",
        "Q: So, by the time you left your home in Berlin, your father had already left for Holland. And\nwhat did you know about your father at this -- at this point in time?",
        "A: Nothing really, that we were going on this -- we\u2019re going to meet him in Holland, and I have a\nfeeling like it was going to be, once we got there, like it was going to be pleasant. We were going\nto a resort that was ou -- on the outskirts of The Hague, called Tre-Treverningen. That\u2019s how the\nDutch pronounce it, I believe. And it was a -- a beach resort that was sort of -- Treverningen to\nThe Hague, is like Atlantic City is to Philadelphia. You know, nearby. And it had a pier, like an\namusement pier, and a big beach, and we were living in a boarding -- we\u2019re going to -- well,\nthat\u2019s when I got there, but the trip going, was -- was dangerous, that I do remember. Do you\nwant me to tell you about that?",
        "Q: Sure, and when -- when was that? So you met up with your mother for that?",
        "A: That was -- wi -- yeah. I met up with my mother for that. I guess I -- she took me back to\nBerlin, or you know, we left, you know, by train, and I guess we didn\u2019t have very much with us.\nWhat could it have been? I mean, suitcases, can\u2019t carry more. And we\u2019re in the train, and she was\nvery nervous about the border, and she told me not to talk, not to say anything, bec -- cause you\nknow how they come in at a border, first you -- the Germans come in, and then the other country,\nin this case it was Dutch. And we were in a town called Bedtime first, and these people sort of\nhid us. We were there one or two nights. And it was a border town, and we stayed 1n -- in an\nattic, and we did not come down for meals or anything. They were very nice, I guess it was in\nGermany, and they -- they hid us, even in those days. And then -- I don\u2019t know quite why -- why\nwe couldn\u2019t go directly to Berlin -- to Holland, but we didn\u2019t. And then we made a connecting\ntrain on another day, and that\u2019s when these -- these German Nazis came in. There was a\nconductor, German, you know, regular conductor, but then the Nazis came in, looking at your\npassport, or officers of some sort, and my mother said, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d And I, of course --\nshe se -- he said, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m 10, but my mother said I\nshould say I\u2019m nine,\u201d or something like that. And my mother thought she would die, she was\nready to kill me, cause any discrepancy could, you know, if -- I don\u2019t know why I did that, or --\nit was one way or the other, but it -- they let it slide, but I remember that, and I remember how I\nfelt inside, that I knew I made a big mistake, but that\u2019s kids. And then we did get there, and then\nmy father met us. Where we were, I don\u2019t know. Maybe went directly to that town, to -- or\nmaybe it was in The Hague, and then got to it -- but we stayed in a boarding house until --\nthrough the summer -- spring and summer of 1938, til we left for New York, and --",
        "Q: The boarding house was in this resort?",
        "A: Yes. It was like 1-in a house, you know in a -- a boarding house. The reason I say boarding\nhouse is what I remember is that we had these communal meals, and as a matter o -- there was an\nactor at -- there, at that boarding house, at -- I didn\u2019t know it then, but I since then saw him the --\nhe was in many, many American musicals. His name was S.Z. Sakall, S-a-k-a-l-l, or something,\nand he was called Cuddles in a lot of movies. He was in movies, you know, in musicals with\nBetty Grable, and Don Ameche and played a -- the roly-poly, good-natured funny role in lots of\nmovies, but he was emigrating, and we had these communal meals, you know, like in a boarding\nhouse, which I\u2019ve never had before.",
        "Q: Did you get the impression that other people there besides him were also planning to leave,\nplanning to emigrate from there? Was this a place for people to gather who were trying to\nemigrate?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t really know what we were doing, again the secretiveness, the secrecy, I\nshould say, until -- oh, I must say an asi -- a footnote, I saw -- everybody has bicycles in Holland,\nyou know, and we saw the queen, Queen Wilhelmina and her daughter, riding around on her\nbicycle, and -- very, very casual, not like England. One day, my father said that he was going to\nRotterdam, to see if he\u2019d get tickets to come to -- to go to New York, that he -- and the reason, I\nguess by that time they told me that much, that he could not -- he was under the impression that\nhe could work there, or start a business, or something, but he could not. It wasn\u2019t permitted. So,\nit would have been just a question of time until his money would run out, so he went to\nRotterdam, he said he was going to Rotterdam to see if we get tickets to go to New York, that\u2019s\nhow it seemed. And if we could, we would, and if not, not. It seemed so casual, like if we can get\ntheater tickets we\u2019d go, and if we can\u2019t, we can\u2019t. And he came back a day or two later, and he\nhad tickets to -- on -- on a ship called the Startendam, and we went. And when I\u2019d ask him about\nthis, you know, years later my daughters would always urge me, \u201cTalk to Papa, talk to Papa. Ask\nhim how this happened.\u201d But he never wanted to talk about it, you know, he\u2019d always say,\n\u201cAch,\u201d you know, \u201cstop, I don\u2019t want to,\u201d -- you know, he\u2019d gesture with his hand, and he al --\nhe\u2019d say, \u201cAch, you think it was easy? Ah, it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d So I presume what he meant by that\nwas bribes. What else could it have been, you know? But he must have had the foresight to have\nmoney or whatever, cause that\u2019s the only way you got anywhere in those days.",
        "Q: Was there any problem with you having the stateless passports, you and your parents, at this\npoint?",
        "A: No, I guess they were good for something, in -- at that time, y-you have to remember, it\nchanged like monthly, or less. You know, there were always new -- I\u2019m sure they would have\nbeen worthless. I -- I mean in -- that was September. We arrived here in New York, in September\n-- on September 18\", 1938, and the Crystal Night was not even two months later. So, the timing\nwas very, very fortuitous. And we were hearing things, we were hearing things, you know,\nreading things about, I guess the -- I -- I -- I -- well, not the anschluss, but Hitler going into the\nother countries, or maybe it was right after, because my father, very soon after we got here, the\nfirst thing that he did was to get -- send tickets to my Uncle Martin, and his wife and my cousin\nIlsa, the ones in Berlin, for him to ge -- to -- to emigrate to Shanghai. For some reason or other,\nthat was easier. Couldn\u2019t get her to the United States, but that was possible, but they didn\u2019t use\nthem, they didn\u2019t use them. And I have found out since, here at the museum, that unfortunately\nthey were all killed in Auschwitz, the three of them. I sa -- I looked it up, and it was very -- it\nwas very sad, and to -- to actually see it, you know, on paper. I never knew.",
        "Q: What was the trip like to the United States?",
        "A: The trip, the way I remember it, was quite pleasant. I mean, it was a -- I guess a Dutch ship,\nand it was, you know, just on the cusp of something, they were -- it was a real -- it was a -- it -- it\nwas like going on shi -- on a ship. It was not a refugee ship, we were going second class, which I\nrealized not long a -- not long ago, when I went to Ellis Island, and I was listening with the\nheadset to Tom Brokaw, I found out why I never went to Ellis Island, because we were -- I never\nknew, we just got off the ship when we got here, and cousins, you know, second cousins,\nwhatever, were waiting for us here. But the reason was, if you weren\u2019t in third class, you didn\u2019t\nhave to go to Ellis Island. That\u2019s what he said, and -- but it was quite pleasant. I remember\nmeeting this American family, with their children, who had gone to Europe on vacation, cause it\nwas, you know, early September, summer vacation with their children, and they befriended me\nbecause the mother, the father, they wanted their children to meet a little -- a real little German\ngirl. And I remember they took me into the lounge of the ship, for a -- in-into the cocktail lounge\nin the afternoon, for a drink. And this drink turned out to be som -- it was horrible, and it turned\nout to be Coca-Cola, which was something that I had never -- 1-it\u2019s a very, very strange flavor, if\nyou \u2019ve never ever had it, and I don\u2019t like it to this day. But -- And then I -- My mother bought\nme -- [ had it til not so long ago, a little sailor doll from that ship, with a -- with a little sailor hat,\nthe way they had them, you know, a little white, like a little brechen 1s it? And the little black\nribbon around it, with the name of the ship, and it was like a little stuffed doll, with velvet, and I\nlu -- I wanted it desperately, I wanted this doll, and they did get it for me, and I had it for years\nand years and years, you know, little sailor from -- as a souvenir. I do not ha -- remember this as\nan unpleasant sh -- sh -- it wa -- it was like going -- sort of like on some kind of vacation. I mean,\nI didn\u2019t know the difference, I\u2019d never been on a ship before, maybe it was pretty -- I wouldn\u2019t\nsay primitive, but maybe Spartan, but it -- 1t seemed fine to me.",
        "Q: Did you know that you were moving to another country at that point?",
        "A: I must have, but I -- it\u2019s -- for some reason, it has like no -- no memory, or no great meaning.\n[ -- | -- ] -- I just -- of course I must have known, I mean, we were going to -- but it had no -- I\ndidn\u2019t know what -- what to expect.",
        "Q: What do you remember first seeing?",
        "A: What I -- First seeing, I remember getting -- I don\u2019t really recall s -- being o -- seeing the\nStatue of Liberty, like in the movies, I guess it\u2019s all mixed up with a million documentaries that\nI\u2019ve seen. But I do remember the pier, getting off the ship, and I guess they did have people\ncoming onto the ship, you know, it wasn\u2019t such -- you didn\u2019t just get off. People who -- you\nknow, health examiners, or whatever, you know, and -- were looking at your papers, it\u2019s a whole\nprocess, and then eventually getting off on this huge pier in New York, and then getting into\nthese relatives\u2019 car. These relatives were my mother\u2019s relatives, and -- who were -- the -- the\nwoman was the sister of Arthur Fiedler, the conductor of the Boston Pops, which didn\u2019t mean\nanything to me at the time. And I remember get -- driving from the pier to this -- wherever we\nstayed in that first apartment that they rented for us -- probably did, and I said something ab --\nyou know, I said, \u201cOh, these skyscrapers, they\u2019re not so tall,\u201d or something like that, I said,\nhaving expected -- \u201cThey don\u2019t seem like anything so big.\u201d I remember saying something like\nthat.",
        "Q: In German?",
        "A: In German, of course, I didn\u2019t speak a word of English, not a word. It was always just done.",
        "Q: Can you tell me the date on which you arrived to the United States?",
        "A: Yes, that was a day after my birthday, it was September 18\", 1938, I do remember that very\nwell.",
        "Q: How old did you turn that year?",
        "A: 11 on that day.",
        "Q: Do you remember your birthday on the ship?",
        "A: That must be when I got the sailor doll, I think, as a present. Yeah, my birthday was always\nyou know, to me, a big deal. After all, I was an only child, and children like their birthdays, so I\nthink that probably celebrated it in some manner on the ship.",
        "Q: What do you remember about starting school in the United States, in New York City?\nCorrect?",
        "A: Mm, yes, I do remember -- I remember the s -- the school very well. Eventually, after a few\nyears, we moved across the street from that school, but at -- the first apartment was, I remember\nthe address, 650 West 172\" Street. That was off between Broadway and Fort Washington\nAvenue, and the public school, PS 173 was on the corner of Fort Washington Avenue and 173\"\nStreet, so I just had to walk dow -- you know, two blocks, one down and one across. I remember\nan interview, vaguely. My father taking me to school, and they telling me, whoever, maybe it\nwas the principal, that -- what grade they were putting me into. They put me into four A. In those\ndays the semesters were split up, A and B, ha-half a year, you know, not like fourth grade, A and\nB. So it was the beginning of the f-fourth year, four A, which was five sem -- five semesters less\nthan what I should have been in, two and a half years. And they said that when I would learn\nEnglish, that it would be sort of automatic that I would catch up with myself, which was not true.\nAnd I remember feeling very -- feeling very bad about that, you know, w-with -- with these\nyoung kids. Again, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a filmy kind of dreamy memory, seeing myself in that class, but I\nwas not happy to be with children that were that much younger, and I didn\u2019t speak any English,\nand also, I don\u2019t remember other children that I was -- could be friends with, or drawn to,\nbecause there were other little German girls or boys in the class. It was just me. So I guess they\ncame later, or at other times. And eventually I did become a very good student, and it was only\nbecause of that that I skipped a lot of grades, and I wen -- went to summer school somewhere in -\n- you know, before finishing public school, that I made up at least a year or two, and then I --\nthen in junior high school, I was put in what they called RA, it was called rapid advance classes,\nyou know, for kids who were doing well, and made it two years out of three, or something like\nthat. But in the end, after high school, graduating high school, I just a pi -- I came out just about\nright, so if I hadn\u2019t been, I\u2019d be going to school til I was -- the end of my 18\" year, I think. But\nschool, I remember my f -- early on, I had to -- I came home with a poem, which I had to learn\nby heart. And my father, as I told you, was -- didn\u2019t have much patience, and I just couldn\u2019t get it\ninto my head, I couldn\u2019t seem to grasp it, the engli -- an-and he smacked me, you know, for\nagain not getting it right, and it turned out to be \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner,\u201d that\u2019s what that\npoem was. I didn\u2019t enjoy school ats -- at first, but the kids were -- I -- I guess they were all -- all\nright. I -- I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember them being particularly -- I felt isolated, but I\ndon\u2019t remember being, you know, taunted, or -- particularly one way or another, particularly\ncruel, or -- but isolated. And early on, going to the -- as a school outing, going to the 1939\nWorld\u2019s Fair, that was very thrilling. I re -- I remember doing that, and enjoyable. And I think I\nonly did it once after that, on my own with family or somebody else. But once I got the language,\nthen -- and also I was becoming a teenager, I became a much happier child, and really sort of\nfound myself, which wasn't easy with my parents and these circumstances, you know, little\napartment and I was -- I felt -- I never had a room of my own, I slept in the living room. My\nparents never had a bedroom again, ever. The other room was -- was had always two rooms, and\nit was sort of like a -- with two couches in it, each -- they slept separately, sort of like a studio,\nlike you sometimes get in a motel, L-shaped, one couch here, one couch there. In that apartment\nas well as the next apartment, as well as their last apartment, long after I was married. And I slept\nin the living room, I was -- this is sort of personal, has -- I don\u2019t know, much to do with anything\non this subject, but I was always -- well, I guess sort of ashamed of the way we lived, and also,\nyou know, I didn\u2019t -- the friends that I eventually made, their apartments seemed much nicer, and\nthey had sisters and brothers. It was not all that happy at home, and my mother was working\nright from the beginning here. My father, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t. He -- I guess he came with a\nlittle too much money, that he didn\u2019t need to be forced into taking a job, or -- or getting -- or\nstarting all over, or like most of their friends -- friend\u2019s husbands did. Some of them were\ndoctors, and they started off, you know, the way they do, doing I don\u2019t know, working as -- I\ndon\u2019t know, in -- in -- learning how to s -- you know, their English, and taking medical exam --\nand much more difficult things they -- but my father never really did, and my mother -- my\nmother worked in the -- no, that came later. She worked in people\u2019s apartments, cleaning or\nsomething, it -- it -- I -- it\u2019s not such a happy childhood. And she was not happy with my father\u2019s\nbeing home, so she got up and did something, and eventually she worked in the garment center\nin New York, which she liked. She liked being out on her own, and working.",
        "Q: Did your father ever go back to work, eventually?",
        "A: Not in the way that I presume you mean. Never at a job where he had to be there nine to five,\nor answer to somebody. He did something with -- with fluorescent light bulbs, he sold them to --\nto businesses or something, for their fixtures. It was never quite clear to me what he did. I think\nhe mainly played with his stocks, and -- with his stocks.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side B, of an interview with Anita Sockol. If you\u2019d like to continue\ntelling me about your father, and his work in the New York area?",
        "A: I think -- now that, often I think did come up, that he thought that he had enough money, and -\n- invested in stocks, that he could live on that, indefinitely, for the rest of his life. I don\u2019t think he\n-- he counted on -- what did we have, depression, inflation, whatever it was, that it turned out not\nto be so. I thought he -- He thought he could live better, or maybe they were just ve-very frugal\npeople, but they always lived very simply, I think, sort of below their means. And my mother\nwas really never -- never really adjusted to America. She always dreamt of her life in Berlin, and\nhow it was. She was never really, really happy here. Never really perfected her English, neither\ndid my father, even though my father read the paper, and -- with a dictionary next to him,\nlooking up every word that he didn\u2019t know, he did that. But -- But n-neither one of them really\nbecame all that Americanized. They lived up in Washington Heights, we lived there all their\nlives, with the other so -- you know, so-called refugees. And they enjoyed that life, and\neverybody spoke German, and they had caf\u00e9 and kuckin in each other\u2019s house, and -- and other --\nyou know, and that was the -- but the other people, who came with less, most of them lived a\nmuch better life. They went to Florida, and they went here, and did this and does that. I always\nhad the feeling that my parents never really -- never really became Americanized, and allowed\nthemselves to live a really full life. Always like -- it\u2019s something from that change of coming\nhere in the way they did, I think.",
        "Q: Was it a real change from how you lived in Berlin?",
        "A: I would say so, yeah. That\u2019s 1-1t seems to me, even though I was a little kid, that it was a much\n-- | mean, my mother never had a cleaning lady. I mean, nor was the apartment all that f -- was\nshe that fastidious. Didn\u2019t care about those things. No, it was always very modest, and the way\nwe ate, and -- and what she bought, and -- and the dinn -- it was always sort of cheap, which 1s\nsomething I had to learn to get over.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home with your parents?",
        "A: I guess German and English both, sort of mixed together. And then, of course, when I got\nolder, o-other than the American friends that I had from the different schools, I also had f-\nfriends, you know, at ca -- from wa -- one way or another, friends who also were emigr-emigra --\nimmigrants? And I knew that they spoke German, and we would -- used to -- we u -- whatever\ncame to mind first, we\u2019d sort of mix it up, because we knew that we understood each other. But\nnow, I\u2019ve sort of lost it, because I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: Do yo -- Do you speak fluent -- fluently still?",
        "A: I th -- I th -- Yo -- I could say I do, but I really don\u2019t, because when I\u2019m -- been, on occasion\nwith people who speak perfect German, and -- intellectually, there are lots of words that I don\u2019t\nknow, and I guess never knew, because I left too young. Like when you read documents, you\nknow, that you get, or from the [indecipherable] stuff, my prunci -- pronunciation 1s good, but a\nlot of words that I don\u2019t know, and the sentences are so endless, you know, when you read that\nstuff, I forgot what the beginning was when you get to the end.",
        "Q: Was it particularly challenging for you to learn English at that age, when you arrived to the\nUnited States? Do you remember special challenges, and how you went about it?",
        "A: Another good question. Yeah, I was a little older than some, so it -- it was -- 1t was\nchallenging, and I remember the penmanship, and the -- the script was something different,\nbecause -- never thought of that til just now, that the script in Germany that I learned, which was\nquite difficult, was different than the -- the way we write here. And -- But then they had\npenmanship classes, we all had to take penmanship. And it -- it took awhile. I think it -- it -- it\nwasn\u2019t all that easy, and how I learned it, I don\u2019t know. But my parents were not for education. It\nwas a difficult -- they were difficult. I wanted to learn how to play the piano, for instance,\ndesperately. There was a period in my life, you know, like a window of time, and finally I mean,\nI nagged so -- so much that my mother did give me piano lessons, but I had to practice, and I\npracticed for awhile in the -- in the piano teacher\u2019s house, which is ridiculous, I mean, how long\ncan you keep that up? And I didn\u2019t, and then after awhile -- but I loved doing it, and I lu -- but\nthen I -- I lost interest because they wouldn\u2019t let me. They were not, in that respect, not like\nEuropeans, who are so much for education -- Jew -- I mean, European Jews. No, they fought me\nin college, and I just needed to learn a trade, something to -- to -- that I could make a living, or\ncould support myself, if necessary, yeah.",
        "Q: Were you helped at all by a refugee organization when you arrived?",
        "A: We must have been. I remember the word HIAS, in what respect, I don\u2019t know. I know they\nexist today. We must have been, but -- and there was somebody who -- that my father knew here,\nsome man who was not really a rela -- a f -- a relation, I -- but he -- who had to vouch for us, but\ndidn\u2019t have to put up any money, or however that was in those days. You know, you had to be\nsure in those days, that you would not become a burden to the U. S. government, and that was\nnever an issue, but we lived very simply, frugal, and it was really -- was still the -- toward the\nend of the depression. Wasn\u2019t really until World War Two that we got out of the depression. I\nremember penny candy, and eggs were a nickel a dozen, and you know, I ga -- I -- we -- we\nmanaged.",
        "Q: As you were adjusting, do you remember noticing many cultural differences being in the\nUnited States, being in the schools, meeting friends?",
        "A: I -- I -- I liked it, I know I liked it. I liked going to these other wa -- once I got acquainted\nenough with the cl-classmates to become friendly and be invited to their house, suf -- I liked\ndoing that, and it somehow -- it was different. I liked the American way of doing things, it -- it\nseemed more casual, more lighthearted, more spur of the moment. People seemed generous with\ntheir milk and cookies, or candy, or whatever. I -- I -- It\u2019s just a feeling that I ha -- that I have,\nyou know, not specifics. And I do remember going -- [indecipherable] certain people that were\nfriends of mine. Carol Shiff, and somebody named Edith Pearlmudder, something. This is early\non, you know, it must have been 1938 - \u201939 -- 1940. And some kids, you know, that -- but it -- it\n-- | began to really like it, that\u2019s what I remember. My parents, I don\u2019t know, but I liked it.",
        "Q: Were most of the students in your school Jewish?",
        "A: Good question. No, mixed. No, mixed. I mean, there were a lot of Jews living in Washington\nHeights, but they were mixed. I think there were a lot of Irish and Italian. No Blacks or Hispanic,\nthat wasn\u2019t -- that wa -- they -- you know, that was not an -- they weren\u2019t there. But I -- I think it\nwere -- they weren\u2019t just Jewish.",
        "Q: And do you remember having friends who are not Jewish then, as you progress through your\nyears in school?",
        "A: Yes, I do. I remember somebody named Barbara Krunendonk, and her father was a -- was a\nmusician, and he played in that orchestra, was it Lawrence Welk, or some famous orchestra, that\nwas famous at the time. I\u2019m not sure it was Lawrence Welk. But somebody that -- that at the\ntime was a very well known orchestra, and we were friends, and yeah, there were others. But\nthere was a Y, a YMHA, where now 1s a Port Authority building, right at the George Washington\nBridge, on the New York side of the George Washington Bridge, that became like my haunt.\nThat\u2019s where we hung out, so to speak, you know. Cause after all, I was already almost a\nteenager, you know, after I learned the language, and met a lot of -- so tha -- there were -- that\nwas definitely Jewish.",
        "Q: Did you ever, yourself think, or did your parents ever think that you would return to\nGermany, or to Europe?",
        "A: Hm. I never -- I never thought of it, you know. My mother, I don\u2019t know. I think she would\nhave if she could have, but my father, no, he wouldn\u2019t -- wouldn\u2019t hear of it. He was perfectly\nhappy here. And -- But she just never -- never got -- my mother was like a dreamer, you know,\nand she\u2019d love opera, and she would buy herself records, and she loved, you know, travel, and\nshe\u2019d see a movie, and I'd say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on a trip, instead of seeing a movie? Why\ndon\u2019t you buy yourself a ticket to go to the opera, instead of listening to Mario Lanza,\u201d or\nwhatever, on the record. But she didn\u2019t, as we say, fagin herself. Not that they couldn\u2019t have, but\nthat\u2019s how they lived. She was like a [indecipherable] happy with her -- her record, scratchy\nrecord. You know, and -- and the furniture that she bought early on, I think she had it for the rest\nof her life, that when my mother died, I just liquidated that apartment with my daughters, in a\nday. I told the day care person, \u201cTake what you want.\u201d There was just nothing. But she never --\nnever really settled in, or bought herself things, or buy herself a fur coat, or like her friends did,\ngo a lot to have her nails done, or something. You know, it just wasn\u2019t -- not that she was an\nintellectual who -- su -- for some -- she felt like she wasn\u2019t worthy, I think, of doing these things\nfor herself. Talk about it, but didn\u2019t do it.",
        "Q: Did you feel safe in the United States?",
        "A: Yes, I think I felt safe in the United States.",
        "Q: And how long do you think it took for you to no longer feel so isolated after first arriving, and\nperhaps even to feel as if you were an American?",
        "A: I think -- I think it took -- took a few years. I think it took until I began to go to junior high\nschool. Now, I -- I said they put me into four A, but it didn\u2019t take until the end of six B, it wasn\u2019t\ntwo years, I skipped somewhere. I told you I skipped five times, but I don\u2019t know when all those\nfive times were. One of them was in high school. So I would say it took -- I\u2019d say at least a year\nand a half.",
        "Q: And when did you receive your U.S. citizenship?",
        "A: Ha -- I have those papers at home. I\u2019m not sure, because first -- 1t -- it was twice. Once I\nbecame a citizen through my parents, cause I was too young to be a citizen on my own, and I\nforgot how many years it took, do you remember?",
        "Q: I\u2019m not sure, no.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure. Was it five years, was it seven years? No, probably wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how\nold I had to be, did I have to 21, or was it 18? But I had like two certi -- but I do have a\ncertificate which I have at home. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t really remember, but I know it was a -- it was\na thrill. I\u2019m very proud of the certificate, and studied for the questions, and all that stuff, which\nwere not difficult at the time, or maybe not for a kid who was learning history, wasn\u2019t difficult. I\nthink they\u2019re much harder now.",
        "Q: So, as far as hearing news from abroad, from Germany, and from elsewhere.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How much do you remember hearing during those years, especially as you became a\nteenager, the beginning of course, too, and then as you got older, and became a teenager, perhaps\nmore aware of events anywhere, but how much did you really hear?",
        "A: I think we -- like everybody else, we weren\u2019t really aware about the concentration camps,\nuntil much later. I don\u2019t really know it -- but we did know about, like you said earlier, about the\naschluss, and then very soon after we came here, you know, what happened in Holland, and\nCzechoslovakia, and Poland, and you know, as -- and France, and what was happening, and then\nthe concern about my -- the relatives, and where they were. And somehow then, my mother did\nfind out -- and of course she was in touch with her sister in Palestine, and she knew -- she found\nout, I as -- surely that she must have been involved with those organizations, because how did\nshe find out that my Aunt Kate was in Theresienstadt, survived Theresienstadt, and somehow\ncame to the United States, and she was just thrilled to have her sister here, because she was very\nclose to that sister, as a child. They were closer in age than anybody else, and they were just\ncloser. But it wasn\u2019t to be for very long, because she died before I got married, and I got married\nin 1947, my first marriage, and she wasn\u2019t there. But I do remember her coming, and she was a\ntough bird, and I would -- used to be very angry at her, because she was another one of those,\nlike my father would, in Germany, go back to Germany, always afraid I\u2019d have too much -- too\nmuch pleasure, like a birthday party, and go to the movies all in one, and no, no, no, no, and she\nwas of that same -- she was tough, she was very smart, and was, I think, quite a figure, an\nimportant person in Theresienstadt, you know, like a -- a leader within the circles, whatever they\ndid there, and a Bridge player, and so on and so forth, and I think she even had a romance there,\nwhich I wrote in the -- one of those guest books that they have, when I was there last year. It was\n-- | -- | met that man, they both survived, even though she was married to somebody that -- you\nknow, not a happy marriage, she managed to fall in love there, which 1s sort -- sort of, you know,\nas an adult, life goes on, even those things happen there. But anyway, when she came, she -- I\nwould be angry with her for not -- for being str-strict, you know, and -- and sort of siding with\nmy father on issues, whatever they were, things that I wanted to do. It was not -- not easy for me\nas a -- the upbringing of my parents. I think that was one of the reasons I got married very early.\nThe other was that my mother pushed me into it.",
        "Q: How did -- What did you hear specifically of Kristallnacht?",
        "A: What did I hear? Well, we must have heard about it, I mean, I -- I -- I really -- I don\u2019t\nremember d -- I -- I really don\u2019t remember, probably you know, I don\u2019t want say something\nthat\u2019s incorrect, and say, oh we heard this and that, only to find out -- I mean this is something\nthat\u2019s easily checked through American newspapers. Did we hear about it at that time? Did we?\nYes, we did? Well, if -- if it was so, then we -- then we did, and we were very upset. I just don\u2019t\nknow whether it was as it happened in the newspapers, or 1t came later. Well, maybe we did.",
        "Q: And, did you get the sense --",
        "A: Oh, I -- Yeah, you\u2019re right, we did, because of my Uncle Martin who did not take my father\u2019s\n-- he did not use those tickets that he sent him for Shanghai because he felt like he was going to\nbe -- I used to say that, like he was -- sent him a ticket to go to the moon. I mean, he was a very\nprovincial guy who, I don\u2019t know, worked for the mu-municipality or had some kind of civil\nservice type job or -- and if he lived in something that\u2019s comparable to Brooklyn, and just go to\nShanghai, when he\u2019s never been out of Berlin, and you know, in a -- it was just -- he c -- he\ncouldn\u2019t seem -- you know, couldn\u2019t get himself to do it, and he didn\u2019t have much time to just\nget up and leave, and he didn\u2019t, so --",

        "A: I --",
        "Q: -- about Kristallnacht, or other incidents?",
        "A: I think that was -- that was soon at -- I -- I don\u2019t know. I have no letters or anything among\nmy memoirs, you know, and things that my parents have, or that they saved, that they were\nactual letters.",
        "Q: Did you have the impression, over the years of the -- of the war, that things were getting\nworse for Jews?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, definitely.",
        "Q: And as you were growing -- growing up, and of course by the end of the war, I -- I believe\nyou\u2019re about 18 years old at -- at that stage perhaps. Is that ga --",
        "A: Well, you know what I really rememb -- as -- as a -- I became very Americanized, and I -- as I\nthink about the war, I remember th -- I think about the war from an American girl\u2019s point of\nview. I went out with -- my friend had a brother who was in the army, and he took me this -- my\nfirst date, my first play. Because he was in the army, he got tickets to see \u201cOklahoma!\u201d\u2019, which\nwas a play, and nobody could get tickets for anything, except G.I.\u2019s, you know, and I was thrilled\nto go to the theater. But I thought through -- and -- and then you -- you got some -- the soldiers\ngave you their -- their -- whatever they are, insignias, the bar from a lieutenant, or -- and these\nwere the -- and working for the -- what was it, AWVS, something, and do-doing things for the\nwar effort. I remember, as a kid in the -- as a -- in junior high school, doing things after work,\nsaving silver foil, the ration stamps. I -- I see it, myself, as like a little American girl, an-and\nseeing it through the eyes of American soldiers, and sailors, and Marines, and Air Force, and the\nsongs and the tremendous patriotism that we all had. That\u2019s what I think this generation doesn\u2019t\nquite have that, it\u2019s a -- and of course, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, I mean, he was like a god to\nme at the time. Didn\u2019t want to read the things that I read, you know, on Ellis Island and -- and\nnot knowing about the -- the SS Saint Louis. Didn\u2019t even know there was a German ship til I\nread your things from the Holocaust Mu -- cause Saint Louis, you know, you think it\u2019s an\nAmerican ship.",
        "Q: When did you -- When did you learn of concentration camps, and the mass murder of Jews?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know when I learned it. I don\u2019t know. Again I have to -- I mean, I know that my aunt\nis like, you know, by that time I knew, because she came here, but I -- I -- I guess I knew it when\neverybody else knew it, whenever that was. I -- Certainly my parents were very interested to s --\nan-and worried about their relatives not knowing what happened to my -- her brother, and th --\nand the -- and the family, and I -- I -- if I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to look it up when we conclude this\ninterview, but -- so they -- whatever wa-was news on the radio, and in the paper, they kept up\nwith, but when exactly -- I mean, I guess I learned it as everybody else learned it.",
        "Q: Did you meet many Holocaust survivors then, coming to America after the war?",
        "A: Yes, yes I did. People came, I did meet people. I met -- meet people who were eventually\nfriends, you know, through, because I have these -- s-some American friends, others that weren\u2019t\nAmerican, and I met people who had been in Auschwitz, I -- I was friends with Holocaust\nsurvivors who had been in concentration camps, cause I remember their tattoos, you know, on\ntheir arm. But I me -- I had a lot of fr -- I had a lot of friends who were from -- early on in my\nfirst marriage, met a lot of people who were -- they were really mixed friends, friends who were\nborn in Germany, and others who were American.",
        "Q: Did you ever experience anti-Semitism in America?",
        "A: Irememb -- Yes, I think I did. I -- When I finished junior high school -- was just telling this to\na friend of mine the other day, cause my father was such a disciplinarian, that he insisted that I\ngo to -- everybody was leaving for George Washington High School from this -- almost\neverybody, all my Jewish friends, yes, they were mostly Jewish. Somehow you just -- naturally\nyou gravitate to them, you know? He insisted that I go to Washington Irving High School, which\nis a sort of high school that -- with an emphasis on needle trades, because he -- being that\u2019s the\nbusiness he was in, he wanted me to become a designer, or learn how to sew. He pushed it so\nthat to this day I hate sewing. And then, at any rate, I -- under duress, I went to George Washing\n-- to Washington Irving High School. Had to take the train downtown, all my friends went to the\nother school. And one of the -- on the first days in the school, I saw that everybody was Italian,\nand I sort of felt I had to -- sort of -- I felt out of place, and one girl said to me, she says, \u201cYou\nwant to hear a joke?\u201d Said, \u201cSure.\u201d And she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the fastest thing on two legs?\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t know, what?\u201d And she said, \u201cA Jew passing a draft board.\u201d When I heard that, I\nreally put my foot down, I went home to my father, I didn\u2019t want to be there in the first place. I\nsaid, \u201cI am not staying in that school, I am not going to stay there.\u201d And I insisted on being\ntransferred to George Washington High School, which they did do, and then I was much happier,\nand I was a very -- was a good student, I was an arrister, and I sort of found myself. Actually in\njunior high school, I -- I did well, but then I, you know, found myself in my teenage years, but\nthey were turbulent, I was never -- I had a lot, I think, to contend with as a teenager, more than,\nyou know, had I been born here with parents who were, but that\u2019s obvious.",
        "Q: When did you and your parents get contacted by the German government as part of\nreconciliation efforts? I believe that\u2019s called vidogutmachen.",
        "A: I cannot remember when that was, but I know f -- I know it was uf -- early on, when they\nbegan to do that, it wasn\u2019t really I think the German government so much, as the Berlin\ngovernment, because they were getting these checks, you know, so -- from the German\ngovernment, for lost property, or -- my mother got something that was sort of like the equivalent\nof -- loosely speaking, like Social Security, because she could prove her -- she had her\nemployment records or something, and taxes that were taken out, sounds strange, but it was\nbased on that. And she di --",

        "A: -- aS a-- aS a young woman. Remember, she was 27 when she got married, and she worked,\nas a matter of fact, for my uncle. She worked in -- he manufactured hats in Kemnets, and when\nshe lived it -- she worked there and somewhere else. Not a profession, but something, you know,\nsales. And so there was a connection between her and -- and the government, and they were\ncontact -- I know they didn\u2019t contact -- my parents didn\u2019t contact them, because when they got\nthis information -- also, it was around Washington Heights, everybody was -- knew about it, or\npeople here and there were getting these invitations. But they did not want to go. And then we\njust sort of let that -- and I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you,\u201d you know, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d\nmy father said, \u201cDon\u2019t want to ever go back to Germany, no, not interested.\u201d So we just dropped\nit. And then there were years in between, I presume it was like in the early 70\u2019s or something?",

        "A: She -- I -- I don\u2019t know. I guess she just -- he absolutely didn\u2019t want to, and they never really\nwent anywhere, or did anything. You know, going to Florida for a couple of weeks was -- that he\nwanted to do, and she hated it, because they did it year after year after year, again\n[indecipherable]. But if she did want to go, it was sort of crushed, you know, that desire.",
        "Q: How did you become more involved in either receiving things from Germany --",
        "A: Let me just add, yes, she did really want to go places, because she finally went to -- to\nEurope, I forgot about that, my mother, by herself. She went to Israel to visit her sister, she said\nshe wanted to go. Her sister Anna. Kate had died in 1946, I guess, because I got married in \u201947,\nand she was no longer alive, died of cancer here, recurrence. But, she went by herself, my father\ndid not want to go anywhere, and she picked herself up, she went to Rome by herself, and she\nwent to Israel by herself, and that was pretty cons -- for her, quite a feat, and she loved it, but that\nwas, you know, the biggest trip. And she always used to talk about when her sister Anna, and her\nbrother-in-law, who lived very well, very comfortably, took her and her mother, Frieda to Nice\non the Riviera. Must have been in the early 30\u2019s or something. No, I don\u2019t know when it was.\nWas it after she was married?

        "A: From Berlin, yes I started to receive a lot of things. Some things were annual, some things\nwere quarterly. Annual were calendars, very beautiful calendars, I -- I think I get those to this\nday, they\u2019re still doing that. But they sent books, you know, Berlin 1979 - \u201970 - \u201980 - \u201981, every\nyear, and always relating to Jews, they were like soft cover books, very interesting, in German,\nwith pictures, and I\u2019d get something about a famous cartoonist, who had -- her name was Zille,\nZ-1-|-l-e, and -- who died at -- in the late 1920\u2019s, and was very famous and it was very funny, to -\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Anita Sockol. Would you like to\ncontinue talking about the items that you received from Berlin, through the years?",
        "A: And among these books, you know, that had -- we receive every year, they we -- in 1988, I\nbelieve it was, I got a book about the Jews of Berlin, and it went back from the 19\" century, into\nthe 20\" century, up until 1939 or \u201940, whenever, you know, something like that. And I leaf\nthrough this book, and I couldn\u2019t believe it, there was a picture of me and my cla -- in my\nclassroom, with me in it, my -- all the -- all my classmates from, I think, 1935. And when I saw\nthat, I said, I\u2019ve got to -- I said, \u201cHow did they got ahold of this picture?\u201d Well, obviously,\nsomebody else had the same class picture, I found that out subsequently, somebody who lived in\nEngland, and submitted it to them. At any rate, I -- I -- it -- it piqued my interest, and I now -- I\nthought I wanted to go to Berlin, and get this trip that my parents never took advantage of. So I\ngot in touch, it\u2019s a lengthy involvement, I won\u2019t go into it. And we had a lot of corens --\ncorrespondence back and forth. I told him about the picture, they were very interested in the\npicture, and I traced it, and said I could identify the g -- most of the girls to this day, which I did\ndo, and then they published it in yet another publication that they had, a g -- like a newsletter,\nthat went to all former Berliners, and I started receiving mail from all these people because they -\n-  -- it said something about Anita Sockol in New York, blah, blah, blah, and I started receiving\nthem. And because of this -- so I had two things going on at the same time, it was very exciting\nreally, receiving these letters, and also questions. Did I know somebody named Ilsa Plachte, and\n-- because that was a very good friend of mine, and where does she live? And I would call that\nperson back, they lived in Columbus, Ohio. I said, \u201cThat was my cousin, I heard that, you know,\nshe died in Auschwitz.\u201d Other people wrote to me, they were -- th -- this woman just knew the\nname, and as I was busy writing and corresponding with these other people, I was also talking to\nthis woman in Berlin, and sort of pushing it to get the trip. She said I was too young, if I wanted\nto come with my mother. And I said, \u201cAt this point, my mother couldn\u2019t possibly travel.\u201d And --\nBut because of it, I think they gave it to me. And I did go on the trip to Berlin, in 1989, in the\nspring. March, I believe it was, before the wall came down. And it was a very interesting trip,\nwith many -- with wonderful things that they did for us, and yet you had such -- such strange\nfeelings, everybody did, you know. And I have a cousin who lives -- second cousin who lived in\nBerlin at the time, and the free time that we had, he showed me the railroad tracks, you know,\nover a bridge, that\u2019s where the Jews were shipped to Auschwitz from, and a little doorway that\nlooked like a closet, you know, you\u2019d walk right by. And he said, \u201cIn there is an Orthodox shul,\u201d\nwhich you\u2019d -- you\u2019d never think there was anything in there. And told me -- So, I had very\nmixed feelings. At night I couldn\u2019t sleep from all the things that were -- that my -- my feelings\nwere, you know, accosted with. And we met the mayor of Berlin, he talked to us, and there were\ncocktail parties. We met a senator, a woman senator, and they made these speeches, dear former\ncitizens, and it was very strange. Very difficult to explain the -- can\u2019t say love, but the -- some\nkind -- some kind of memories, and yet the -- the anti-German feeling that you -- that sort of\nrides over everything. It -- It was very strange, and we went to see -- everybody ran to s -- to\nwherever they lived. And there was a man who was [indecipherable] from this area, I think he\nwas from Maryland, and he lived near where I lived, and we went to -- by train through eastern\nBerlin, to where I lived, and the address existed, but not the building, so they must have kept the\naddress, but -- you know, but it was some modern, ugly building, cause of -- obviously that\nwhole area was bombed out, and like rebuilt.",
        "Q: What is the address?",
        "A: Tw -- Bamburger Street, 26, number 26, in Vilmasdorf, is the section, cause Berlin is very\nbig, very big.",
        "Q: How were your interactions with other Germans, non-Jewish Germans living in Berlin?",
        "A: Well, they were, of course, all hand picked people for this thing. They were younger, and very\nsensitive to the issues, you know, but I -- I realized that. And one -- I had a very interesting\nconversation on one of the days with one of the tour guides, when we went to the -- not the\nReichstag, but the -- that stadium, the Olympic stadium where Hitler spoke and he showed us,\nyou know, and I -- then I remembered it from, I guess newsreels. I forgot to mention newsreels,\nwas 1 -- cause there was no TV, but how did I hear the voice? Of course, it wasn\u2019t just the radio,\nnewsreels in the movies. And he said that h-he -- something I never thought of, he said, \u201cOh\nyes,\u201d he said, \u201cit still exists very much.\u201d He said every Sunday when he goes to his grandparents\nhouse for Sunday dinner with his -- he -- they talk about the old -- good old days, you know,\nthey\u2019re died in the wool -- I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re still Nazis, but they long for those Hitler days,\nand they talk about it. And he said there was a lot of neo-Nazi stuff going on that he knew of,\nand he felt -- he and his fianc\u00e9e, that if it got any worse -- this was in 1989, that he was going to\nmove to Canada, he just didn\u2019t like what was going on. It was interesting to hear it from a young\nGerman fellow. And I really didn\u2019t think about that two generations back, that the young ones\nare exposed to all that, and they\u2019re still alive and -- and not ashamed, or anything. They are what\nthey are.",
        "Q: Did you feel unsafe, yourself?",
        "A: No. No, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t. It was so stra -- you know, I -- I felt sort of pleased with myself that\nI could speak German in Germany, you know, it made it easy to get around, and it gave you like\na -- it\u2019s very strange feeling, it\u2019s hard to put into words. That this was once your home, and yet\nit\u2019s not recognizable, it\u2019s -- I -- I -- I can\u2019t put it into words, the -- the feeling. Like a real love-\nhate relationship.",
        "Q: Did you feel any anti-Semitism while you were there?",
        "A: No, but I\u2019m sure I could have. I was in a control group, really -- controlled group. We went --\nThey -- We saw what they wanted us to see, you know? Took lovely boat ride on the river, and\noh, the whole thing was conducted in German, though, and had wonderful -- we went to the\ntheater, everything was brand new, the acoustics, the sou -- everything was better than -- I -- I\nnever ex -- I never expected to have such a trip, you know, I thought it was -- I didn\u2019t know what\nto expect. Didn\u2019t know everything would be so deluxe. The hotel, the -- even, you go -- show\nyour passport at a certain bank, and they gave you money, spending money. It\u2019s all part of it, I\nmean, they do a very, very good job, so that you go home and say it was wonderful, which I\ncan\u2019t really say it wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: How did you feel about divided Berlin at that time, and -- you were both in east and west?",
        "A: Yeah. They -- A tremendous difference, tremendous difference, it -- 1t was like night and day.\nEast Berlin was very d -- you know, just like you would expect a Communist place to look like,\nvery old and stodgy and -- and neglected, and even the food. We had coffee and cake or\nsomething there in the afternoon, was awful. And when you went -- when we came back to East\nBerlin, it was -- dusk was falling, and you see the neon, and the lights, and the -- and the music,\nit was like night and day, was really amazing dichotomy between the two places.",
        "Q: You mean when you came back to West Berlin, in the evening?",
        "A: Yes, when I came back to West Berlin in the evening, jus -- as you cross the border, it\u2019s like\nyou're in a different world. It was very interesting. But as far as what I felt was concerned, I have\nno -- I -- you know, I had no fear for anybody who seemed -- they seemed poor, and a lot of\npeople seemed unemployed or whatever, but I didn\u2019t -- I certainly didn\u2019t have any great feeling\nfor them, nor the other way -- and -- and still don\u2019t. And if it costs Germany a fortune to com --\nyou know, to integrate it, I couldn\u2019t care less. They took it on.",
        "Q: How about memorials regarding the Holocaust? What memorials did you see?",
        "A: Oh, something else that just came to mind. I was in Germany in 1949, not in Berlin, but when\nI went back to Europe for the first time with my husband, my first husband, we went to\nFrankfort. He wa-was on business, and first time I ever went back to Europe, and we\u2019re in\nFrankfort, and the city was absolutely decimated. You could see for miles and miles and miles, it\nwas just rubble. And way in the distance you saw the famous Kerner Dome, which 1s a cathedral.\nAnd they did this precision bombing, and I remember seeing all these Germans, this is \u201949 now,\nrolling around on makeshift -- like torsos rolling around, lots of them, on a wooden crate, with\nlike the wheels of a -- of a -- from roller skates, you know, one on each corner, so that they could\n-- you know, their legs blown off, and -- and I remember -- and they wer -- the food was terri --\nno, the food was good, it was bad in England, and in -- in London, and in Paris, you couldn\u2019t, but\nin Germany, through the PX\u2019s, you could get almost anything, and it just bothered me, and I -- it\njust -- seeing these people rolling around, I just couldn\u2019t have cared less, is -- it\u2019s -- you know, I\nhad no sympathy whatsoever on how difficult the war was for them. It was very strange being\nthere, I had forgotten that I was in Germany.",
        "Q: How do you feel about Germans, and Germany today\u201d?",
        "A: To be honest with you, almost the same. I am sure that I will die with that feeling. Don\u2019t\nknow quite why I feel that way, being that I -- you know, didn\u2019t have to go through a\nconcentration camp, but I\u2019m very -- just so grateful, you know, that -- and feel so fortunate that I\n-- like, I missed it by a hair, and I just feel a -- a tremendous -- a tremendous feeling of\nsomething to all the people that died there. I -- I just -- To me, that\u2019s sort of like my religion. I\njust feel compelled to read, you know, almost anything on that, or see every film, or every\ndocumentary. I just feel very drawn to it, and I\u2019m always very annoyed with people -- most of\nthem are Jewish, who say -- and there are many, I -- I can\u2019t deal with that, I -- I can\u2019t watch it, I\ncan\u2019t look at it, I can\u2019t read it, and I always feel like, I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t look at it?\u201d I said, \u201cYou\ndi -- it -- it\u2019s like you -- you ought -- you know, you didn\u2019t have to go through it, why can\u2019t you\nlook at it? I feel like that\u2019s your duty to look at it.\u201d Or, I couldn\u2019t go to a Holocaust Museum, and\nit -- I find that very annoying, and many people say that to me.",
        "Q: What are your impressions of how Germans are dealing with, or not dealing with the history\nof the Holocaust?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m certainly no expert on it. I -- I see -- you know, I read these -- the answer -- you\nknow, that Daniel Goldhagen\u2019s book is such a hit in -- in Germany, and that they like klesma\nmusic, which is sort of weird to me, like it -- I\u2019m sure there are some -- I -- I really don\u2019t know,\nmaybe it is a generational thing, but I -- I think that many Germans -- and I\u2019ve learned that\nthey\u2019re -- heard this from really very well known, and very knowledgeable professors, I take\ncourses in international politics in New York. They -- They don\u2019t really know what to do with\ndemocracy. It\u2019s sort of inbred. I\u2019m not generalizing, but they feel comfortable under -- you\nknow, being told what to do, and as long as it\u2019s orderly, and clean, and neat, and no crime, you\nknow, at least, you know, the ordinary kind of crime, that they feel comfortable with that.",
        "Q: What are your impressions of the memorials that you saw in Germany? And I think you were\nin Germany in recent years twice, in 1989, as well as 1998?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Correct?",
        "A: I was, yeah. \u201989 was that trip, and 19 -- October 1998 was a -- a couple of days in Berlin, a\ntrip of eastern Europe. I was in Budapest, Prague -- Budapest, Prague, where else was I? Vienna.\nVienna and Berlin. And I have that same feeling, by the way, for the Viennese. I mean, Austria\nand Germany, as far as I\u2019m concerned, I lump them together. If anything, I dislike them more,\nbecause they\u2019re so -- you know, so like our southern people or something, you know, with that\nsmaltzy Viennese, but that\u2019s just me. What was your question, how?",
        "Q: About the memorials that you\u2019ve seen.",
        "A: Oh, the memorials. I th -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t see anybody looking at them, or noticing them. I\u2019ve\nseen some, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re very subtle, you don\u2019t even know what they are. And I\u2019ve seen chil\n-- they\u2019re like in a children\u2019s playground, and kids climb on them, or play around them. They\u2019re\nnot revered. They\u2019re just up here and there, again, only the ones I\u2019ve seen, maybe there are some,\nbut -- but there was one ri-right on the Krufensadum, and very -- right by the main -- the main\nsubway station, right near the Kaufasdesvestens, this famous department store. And it\u2019s -- that\none referred to different -- it just mentioned different concentration camps, like on a -- on a post,\nbut it\u2019s -- it\u2019s well done, and I think that people just go about their business, nobody looks at it.\nAnd that\u2019s a spot sort of like Times Square. What they do look at, and it is interesting, 1s that\nchurch. You must have seen that church, we bombed out that famous cathedral, and they left that\nstanding there in the middle of modern Berlin, which is quite interesting, but that\u2019s just a\nreminder of the war, not -- nothing to do with Germans -- nothing to do with Jews. It\u2019s very\ndramatic.",
        "Q: Did you notice many differences after the wall had come down, on your second trip to Berlin,\nin 1998?",
        "A: Yes, I did, I did. I -- They are building there like crazy. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. And\nour tour guide, who was excellent, a guy from Munich, told us, among many other things, that 90\npercent of building cranes in Germany were all in Berlin, and this really wasn\u2019t a good time to\nvisit Berlin, 1f you wait a year or so, it\u2019Il be like a whole new city. It was just amazing. All the --\nyou know, the Fortune 500 companies, or whatever, of the world, were building there, and they\nweren\u2019t just building buildings, they were building like whole plazas, and it\u2019s ju -- tremendous,\nun-unbelievable the building going on, which was -- there was nothing going on in -- in 1989.",
        "Q: Did you have much communication with Jews living in Berlin today, or in the modern day?",
        "A: No, none. We were at a very nice hotel, and then we went and did things, you know, on our\nown, really. And of course, a famous muse -- you know, went to a museum, the thing that\ntourists do, including the zoo, which is spectacular, and the -- you went to that museum, I know\nyou did, the Pergamon Museum. And -- And went to -- to try that Berliner food, which -- which\nwas very interesting.",
        "Q: Was the Jewish museum constructed when you were there in 1998? Did you visit the -- the\nnew Jewish museum in Berlin?",
        "A: I did not go, no, I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t -- no, I did not.",
        "Q: How would you say -- Oh, one more question about visiting Germany, have you -- did you\nhave a chance, in Germany, or elsewhere in Europe to visit concentration camp sites?",
        "A: Yes, for the first time. I know that -- that -- that other time I was -- yeah I\u2019m -- as I realize it\nnow, I was also in Munich once, forgot about that. But I did not go to -- to Dachau. I was near it,\nbut I didn\u2019t go. That was years ago with -- I don\u2019t know. But this time, in 1998, I did visit\nTheresienstadt, because it was part of the tour. We were on our way from Prague to Vienna, I\nbelieve. It\u2019s that right? Think so. Whatever, and via Dresden, and we -- we went to -- yeah,\nbecause Theresienstadt, I think, was near, or in Czechoslovakia, and it was quite an experience. I\n-- And I knew that that was not the worst ones. I remember hearing that from my aunt, and she\ndid survive, and -- and they had, you know, some kind -- some sort of a life there, but I don\u2019t\nthink I could bear visiting Auschwitz. I don\u2019t ever want to go to Poland.",
        "Q: What would you say, if you can identify this, is the long term impact that your experiences, of\nhaving to flee Germany, and be a refugee, and then, in general, the Holocaust has had on your\nlife.",
        "A: It\u2019s a hard question to answer, but I am sure that it has had a profound affect on me. You\nknow, you think it hasn\u2019t, but it has. It has -- I probably would have be -- been a different person.\nI mean, it\u2019s hard to speculate, but I mean, I\u2019m happy that -- that I came to America, but coming\nas a refugee, I think if I -- if I had been born here, I would be a different person today. Maybe not\neverything for the better, but I think most of if, yes, s -- educa -- and it\u2019s hard -- hard to say.",
        "Q: Do you think that the Holocaust has had an impact on either your politics or your religious\nfaith, or any sort of, career decisions?",
        "A: I think on my career decisions, because my parents -- well then, of course, that was my\nparents. Had I been -- Had it -- had not happened, I probably would not have gone on to much\nhigher education. In Berlin, I guess nobody did it, or almost nobody. Here, you have more\nopportunity, and still my par -- it was maybe more my parents doing than -- and their feeling -- I\nthink they always felt like refugees, all their lives, and therefore, you know, passed that on to me,\nto get married, and you know, get -- I -- I don\u2019t know why I had to, you know, get married, so I -\n- I just had turned 19 -- no, just had turned 20. My birthday\u2019s in September, I got married in\nOctober, but I -- in those days, chronologically, you know, I was just 20, but otherwise, I,\nemotionally, I was like 16. And I was, you know, something that really should not have had -- I\nshould have gone, you know, and furthered, you know, gone for more of a career, and so it -- it\ndid affect me. But what did you ask me?",
        "Q: And also whether you think the Holocaust has had any effect on your political interests and\ninclinations, and also your religious faith.",
        "A: I think it -- on my political inclinations, yes, I think most people are pretty democratic, and\nliberal, and I think it has something to do with that, of course, because you can see yourself in\nthat same position, in relation to Blacks, or whatever, minorities. As far as religion is concerned,\nwell, I wasn\u2019t brought up on a religious home. My first husband was very religious. I was not,\nthat was a bad combination. And it sort of, if anything turned me against it, I found it very\ncumbersome, and cumbering and -- and I just have a tremendous feeling about the Holocaust,\nand still more as I get older, as I said earlier. I still do. I -- I -- I have more -- more and more so.\nAnd that, somehow, is like my religion, you know. I -- I don\u2019t really -- \u2019'm not a religious -- I\nlike tradition, a little bit of it, you know, with the family, and we spend the holidays together, but\nit means more to my children than it does to me, to be honest.",
        "Q: How do you feel about the ways in which the Holocaust has been portrayed, especially in this\ncountry, in the United States, especially in popular culture, movies. Also, even portrayed in this\nmuseum.",
        "A: Oh, I think the museum is fantastic, I really do. I think it\u2019s a fabulous museum, it\u2019s portrayed\nvery, very well, and all the high tech things, and all the little films you can see. I haven\u2019t really\nbegin -- begun to scratch the surface, if I really wanted to see everything, cause I\u2019m never here\nlong enough. If I lived in the area, I probably would have done it, but I -- it\u2019s not the end, I\u2019m\ngoing to continue to do it. And in films, I ge -- I mean, I think much more -- I think s -- it\u2019s --\nmuch more is still being said, and I think as we get more sophisticated, and as the generation 1s\nready to die out, that there are scholars and people still writing from -- and pursuing it from, then\n-- and researching it from different angles, and different points of view. Especially, I\u2019m\ninterested -- I am interested a lot in -- well, like that Daniel Goldhagen book, sort of to prove to\nmyself that -- about the basic German, how could this really happen, that it isn\u2019t just the\nhierarchy and everything that we know, that it could not really have happened without the\ncooperation of the ordinary German. I feel like it\u2019s in their blood, I really do feel that. There are\nexceptions of course, but -- I mean, how -- all the little things that happened day to day, how c --\nhow could anybody take just stones, and smash windows, and take an old man in -- into the\nstreet, you know on an individual basis, when you look at it that way. Nevermind the\nconcentration camps, before the concentration camps, people that you knew, and were your\nneighbors, and you knew them all your life, and all of a sudden you turned your back on -- what\ndoes it take in a person to do that? You know, one to one. I -- I have to wonder about that. What\nkind of people are those? And other countries, you know, you take a country like Denmark, was\nit? And they\u2019re just like good people. They just didn\u2019t, and they wouldn\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s -- I\ndon\u2019t know what that is, when you lump it together as one country. Or the people of -- I -- I --\nbut I -- and I feel that way, yes, to this day, and I feel that about Polish people, Austrian people,\nthe whole Ukraine, all those people that, you know, when you see modern day movies that were\nmade in this -- last year or this year, and you see these old ladies, with the babushkas, and a\ncouple of teeth, it -- 1t -- you could transpose them into a movie of 1938, and if I understood their\nlanguage, they\u2019re still -- they -- they\u2019re born with that anti-Semitism, that\u2019s -- I feel that, I really\ndo. That\u2019s why I never want to go to any of those other countries. I only went to Berlin, because\nafter all, well, it was offered to me, and it was -- there is a fascination, it\u2019s a morbid fascination\nto see the city. And it\u2019s also an interesting city.",
        "Q: Would you say that you feel hate toward Germans, Germany, and perhaps other countries that\ncollaborated?",
        "A: Yeah, I do. Yes, I do. Yeah, I don\u2019t forgive. I -- I\u2019m not -- I don\u2019t have -- I\u2019m a very -- like a\nvery practical person, and I don\u2019t really have religion to fall back on. I\u2019m -- I -- \u2019'm not forgiving\nin that sense, or can turn to God. I -- I just see it -- what -- what\u2019s the right word, I\u2019m a very\nliteral person. Is that the right word? I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I see it, you know, the way it was, or\nread the way it was, and no, I cannot forgive it.",
        "Q: Do you have any particular impressions of movies such as \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d and more\nrecently, \u201cLife is Beautiful\u201d?",
        "A: Oh, don\u2019t get me started. We\u2019ll be -- We\u2019ll -- You\u2019ll need another tape. I hated that movie,\nthat shi -- that -- that \u201cLife 1s Beautiful.\u201d \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d was an interesting movie, it\u2019s a story\nabout one person, I mean. But it was well done, I like Steven Spielberg, and what he\u2019s doing,\nThe Shoah Foundation and all that. But I hated that -- that \u201cLife is Beautiful,\u201d and I\u2019ve had\nendless discussions with people about that movie. You had to ask me that at the end. I just -- I --\nIt\u2019s a fable, and I also take a film course, and we discuss it in the film course. An-And people\nloved it, and I -- I just -- and when that -- that guy climbed over those chairs at the Oscars, I ju --\nI just -- I -- I said, \u201cLet it end already.\u201d But there is no end. Do you know that they\u2019re making\nanother movie? Yup. S -- Th -- Oh, no, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re putting 1t with eng -- in the --\nmaking it in English, without titles. I knew I read something. And I just feel that -- like, it\u2019s like a\nsacred thing, that you can\u2019t write a fable about -- a movie about a -- an experience like that. And\nI feel that anybody who went through the experience, that it was like an insult to people, that\nnothing in that movie could have possibly have happened. That they -- he took the little boy with\nhim into -- I felt such an affront, I -- I don\u2019t know why, but I just hated it. And I hate that little\nguy, and his annoying interviews, so don\u2019t ask me any more on that.",
        "Q: Did you -- Well, can I ask you at least, did you talk about it --",

        "Q: Did you talk about the movie with several other Holocaust survivors?",
        "A: Yes, and the ones that I know, which are limited, because they were in my class, I take a -- a\nfilm course at the new school in New York, and almost everybody there, for some reason or\nother is -- well, they\u2019re retired people, and most of them are Jewish, and some of them are\nsurvivors. And the survivors felt as I did, but I don\u2019t know if they were as vehement. I -- I just --\nI just found that movie very annoying. I just -- I didn\u2019t like the humor, and I didn\u2019t like any of\nthose things, and I don\u2019t agree with people who say that well, at least then they -- more people\nwould be exposed to it, you know, who wouldn\u2019t see it, because they\u2019re exposed to something\nthat never could have happened, it was so much more horrible.

        "Q: Tape number three, side B, of in interview with Anita Sockol. I\u2019d like to ask you how you\ntalked with your children as they grew up, about your experiences in Germany, leaving\nGermany, and about the Holocaust.",
        "A: Well, through the years, I -- I guess the -- we talked, you know, it came up naturally, but they\n-- well, one of my daughters is quite interested in it, my older daughter. She wanted to come with\nme today, you know, but that was not appropriate. But she is interested, she reads books on it.\nShe is interested through her synagogue, she\u2019s very involved at the Washington congregation, I\nforget where Hebrew -- Washington Hebrew, yeah. My other daughter is not all that interested,\nand also I tried, you know, even though it\u2019s German, but it is a language, when they were young,\nI tried to speak German to them. My mother always said it doesn\u2019t hurt to know another\nlanguage, which we all know. But they really fought me on it, and I just gave up after awhile.\nMy grandchildren are sort of interested, but I think they\u2019re interested because it\u2019s a school\nproject, you know. I\u2019m suppose -- because they in turn are learning about the Holocaust, or in\nHebrew school, or they have to do something in history, and sometimes they question me the\nway you\u2019re questioning me now, but not that -- not that closely, especially my youngest one,\nMichael. But how did -- did I speak to them about it? I -- I guess it was maybe -- they would --\nthey did become interested, but I think they spoke more to my parents, probably, than to me. And\nthey became interested when they were adults, but then they didn\u2019t really say much. My father\ndidn\u2019t want to talk about it, and -- how he came here, and this and that. I -- I -- We lived in -- in\nForest Hills, and I\u2019m trying to think back, I -- I don\u2019t know how much it really came up, except\nthat the friends that I had, as I said earlier, they were from Germany as well, or German\nspeaking, at any rate, and they would grow up hearing mixed things, but they knew a little, but\nnothing much has really remained, they are really just very American, Americanized.",
        "Q: Did you try to talk to your own parents about Germany, about the Holocaust very much?",
        "A: Boy, I have to really think about these things. I -- No, not so much, just about this, as they call\nit Ausvanderon, you know that leaving, that process of leaving. And the immediate, the relatives\nand what happened to them, and where they are, but then, after years, you know, when the war\nwas over, and we knew that there wasn\u2019t going to be any -- you know, weren\u2019t going to hear\nfrom anyone, except their -- her sister, Kate, and the other one, who lives in Israel, we -- we\ndidn\u2019t talk about it very much any more. I -- I don\u2019t know how. I guess I sort of just accepted it\nor something. My father -- I don\u2019t remember my father talking much about his brother, you\nknow, as the years went by. He was a very self-involved man, not really a family man.",
        "Q: Did you feel a close connection to the creation of Israel, and thereafter feel a connection --\nstrong connection to Israel?",
        "A: Myself, I was happy, we were proud, you know, when watched those proceedings at the UN,\nand -- but as a -- as an American Jew, no I don\u2019t have a very strong connection to Israel. I -- I\nnever felt that I wanted to move there, or live there. As a matter of fact, when I was there the first\ntime, which is -- was in 1963, after a very wonderful trip to Europe. Europe was very luxurious\nin 1963, and then hitting Israel, it was big disappointment. I was not very happy there. No, I --\nit\u2019s -- I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t have a -- I\u2019m happy that it exists, but I don\u2019t, personally no, I don\u2019t have --\nand I have relatives there, and I care about them, and we are in constant touch through the years,\nletters and sometimes phone calls. And they just were very hospitable this last month to my\ngrandson David, who lives in Bethesda. He was in Israel, as was my la -- grandson Lawrence. He\nwent two years ago, and they were lovely to them. And they stayed with them when they had\ntime to visit people on their team tour, each one. And they were saying that I should come, we\ntalked on the phone a couple of weeks ago, that I should come, they have a new house, I should\nstay with them. And I\u2019m considering it, maybe, to go back to Israel. But otherwise -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nreally because of them, and to see Isra -- and then my other experience was in 1993. I\u2019d had the\nbad luck to go on a poor tour -- poorly organized tour, it really wasn\u2019t a tour at all, and I -- if it\nweren\u2019t for my cousins there, it would have been a pretty disastrous trip, cause I was really on\nmy own. It was sold as a tour, but it was -- when you got there, it was really like a day tour. I\ncould have booked that myself, to see, always with different people, and different places, you\nknow, and put -- it was like a day tour in Tel Aviv, or Jerusalem. And at the end of the day you\nwere plunked down at your hotel, and you had nobody. But as I said, I had my family there and\nthey really saved the trip for me. So I don\u2019t have such a gra -- it wasn\u2019t -- I -- I -- I think I\u2019d want\nto try Israel again, and I might consider going there in the near future.",
        "Q: Well, I think I\u2019m just about done. Is there anything else you would like to say or mention in\nclosing our interview today?",
        "A: No, I -- It was a very enjoyable experience to c -- trip down memory lane, which is kind of\nbig hyphens there, spaces missing, but it was very interesting, and I\u2019m glad to have done it, and\nif it\u2019s -- if it is of any value to future researchers, or whatever you do with it, then I\u2019m very glad\nto have done my small share.

He got married\nwhen he was 40, and he was 42 when they had me. And my mother was 27 when she got\nmarried, and was anxious to get out of Kemnets. She told me many, many times, that she got\nmarried to him very quickly, you know, he asked her to marry him, and she wanted to marry to\nget to Berlin, that\u2019s what she wanted. So, but she was fun loving. She had a sense of humor, and\nI think my father sort of kept her down, or at least it wa -- it -- that\u2019s how it seemed to me.

        "A: I can see the house in my mind\u2019s eye. It was, you know, I -- I would say like upper middle\nclass, and it had a -- there was a park nearby, by Rushaplatz, or was it just a real -- a playground\nwith a par -- I\u2019m not quite sure. Not a big park, because Berlin has very big parks, that\u2019s not one\n-- one of them. But it was like a comfortable neighborhood, and I know that Albert Einstein lived\nnearby somewhere. My mother used to tell me that, not that I knew who he was at the time, but I\nknew he was somebody important. And I guess that was a different neighborhood, but where my\n-- when my parents got married, not that same building that -- that I grew up in, when they got\nmarried, before they had me, they lived in a noybow, as they called it, you know, a new building,\nand Marlena Dietrich lived in that building.

        "A: Yes, it\u2019s -- 1-1t was a very nice, spacious apartment, with long hallways, you know, and 1-it\nseemed to me like it was quite large, and I know there were -- there was a -- what do you call\nthat? Like bells that you could ring, you know, and it would ring in the back, in the -- near the\nkitchen, like which room the maid was supposed to come and s -- I was very impressed with this,\nI think, cause I still remember it. But it was, you know, middle class, nothing ultra fancy. I don\u2019t\neven remember -- I guess it did have an elevator, the building. Yeah, it must have. I can see\nmyself walking into the building, and yet it -- it\u2019s murky.",

Too early for a young child, at least for\nme it was. But I don\u2019t -- because you said sounds, that\u2019s what made me think of it, because I\u2019d\nhear things that probably weren\u2019t even happening, but in my mind they were. Creaking sounds or\nsomething, and I was frightened to be alone, five or six, or something.",
        "A: No, I -- I think I was alone, at least that\u2019s what I remember. It must have been later on, when\nyou couldn\u2019t -- you know, weren\u2019t allowed to have a maid any more.",

I\u2019m sure there were Jews living around, but it was -- a-as far as I ca -- I remember,\nwhen I\u2019d visit a friend, it was pretty far away, it was -- because this -- the school that I went to\nwas a Jewish school. But, I don\u2019t think so, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like saying, you know, where I live now in\nManhattan, do I live in a Jewish neighborhood? No, I don\u2019t. A lot of Jews live there, but it\u2019s not\na Jewish neighborhood. I think that\u2019s how it was in Berlin, because I didn\u2019t really think that\nanything was going to happen. Thank you very much.",

        "A: Iremember -- I remember meals in our dining room, I can see the dining room in my -- in my\nmind, but holidays, I think we were -- we were not very religious. My mother was, she always\nwent to -- always went to synagogue on the high holidays, and she always fasted on Yom\nKippur, that was very important to her, and she -- somehow she carried that through to, you\nknow, very late in life, in New York. And I don\u2019t remember her making holiday meals. We must\nhave been invited, or something. I know we were invited here. It wasn\u2019t like, you know, she\ninvited people over. She was not that much of a housewife, or cook, you know, to -- to cook for\nmany people was not her thing. And my father didn\u2019t care, you know, as far as holidays were\nconcerned.",
        "A: Someti -- I remember them being there, being at that synagogue, for -- but it must have been\nfor me, cause it was Purim or something, and probably something that parents should attend, so\nit was more for parents attending than for the holidays, and yet that isn\u2019t quite true. She had a\nBible, and sh -- I think I have it at home still -- that she used, but I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a little confused\nwhether that was in the United States, or there.",
        "A: I had my father\u2019s brother, and his wife. That\u2019s my Uncle Martin and Tanta Trudy. I never\ncalled her aunt, cause I never saw her again, Tanta Trude, and my cousin, Ilsa. They had one\ndaughter, and I was very fond of her, very close to her, or wanted to be, because I was an only\nchild, and I was not very happy about that, so I wanted to think of her as a sister, was happy\nwhen once in awhile we\u2019d get some dresses that were the same dress, you know, in -- 1n our\nrespective sizes. But they lived -- I know they lived a subway ride away, and I -- I think I once\nwent there.

She went to a different school, and she was a little older than I was, and -- but I -- I\nwanted to se -- to -- to -- wanted more of a connection. Why we didn\u2019t, I -- I\u2019m not quite sure. I\nwas really a lonely child.",
        "A: I remember Hi-Hilda Lerbenthal, Lowenthal. She was at one -- somebody in my class, who I\nwas good friends with, and she had a large family, so that must have been fairly -- she had a\nyounger brother and two older brothers, and it was like a happy household, and I loved going\nthere, because it was a lot going on, and you know, played with her brothers, and attention was\npaid, and meals of mi-milk and cookies, or whatever. And then I had a friend named Levia\nAronfeld, who I\u2019ve seen in New York, I\u2019ve run into her, and she had -- I -- I recognized her,\nwhich was really quite something. And another person, Marion Faulk. There were quite a few.\nEva Simon. I re -- just remember these names, and I did have birthday parties, yes, that I\nremember, had birthday parties, my mother made me birthday parties, and she had these lovely\nlittle cups and saucers, each one was different from another. I have just a couple of them left, I\nhave them in my den, cause they -- eventually they chipped and broke, and this and that, but I li -\n- I loved them, and it\u2019s serving -- served us cocoa in those cups, you know, each one, they were\nvery pretty, china, you know, each one was totally different from the other. We called them\nZameltussen. And maybe something will come to mind about holidays, but -- I remember a\nChristmas tree that she sa -- bre -- she got for when we had a maid, because she wanted it, you\nknow, and she did it for her, we had a Christmas tree. Of course, no Christ-like ornaments on it,\nbut it had something on it, jelly rings, or something, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, yes, she was, because there was a room off the kitchen, a small room, and that was\nEmma\u2019s room, that was the first one that I remember.",
        "A: Yes, there was another one after that, named Lotte, and she was also there for quite a few\nyears. I think she was there until it was prohibited to have maids. Then they said they could have\nJewish maids, but I think that never came off, that I can remember.",
        "A: They were my friends, I mean I -- I sa -- I use the word maids, you know, I -- I shouldn\u2019t\nreally, it\u2019s -- they were like my -- what\u2019s the word -- like my companions, not really a -- they\nwere like my babysitters, you know, my nursemaids 1s a better -- even though they did do the\ncleaning, I think, dishes, I don\u2019t remember having any other -- anyone else in help. But my\nmother was very nervous when I was born, I know that, she\u2019s told me that, and she gave me\naway, sh -- and I always thought, f-for years, until I -- til my late years, you know, that my\nfriends who are psycho -- psychologists and -- and social workers said, \u201cYou know, that wasn\u2019t\nreally such a terrific thing.\u201d She thought she did a wonderful thing, she didn\u2019t have enough milk,\nand she gave me away to a clinic. Clinic is not what a clinic 1s here. Clinic is like a private thing\nwhere they -- Dr. Lungstein, she told me, out in -- it was a good distance, and she said she went\nthere several times a week to see me, and they had a -- what do you call them, wet -- wet nurses,\nbecause she thought that I wasn\u2019t going to -- going to make it, or something. I -- I don\u2019t know if\nany of this really was necessary or true, but that\u2019s what she did, and that\u2019s what she told me. But\nit\u2019s sort of interesting, you know, as a mother and grandmother when I look back on this, and\nwhat did that really mean, to give away a newborn, and I said, \u201cHow long was that?\u201d And she --\nIt was like a half a year, which is sort of mind-boggling.",
        "A: I remember being closer to my mother, yes, definitely to my mother.",

        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah. Well, 1-it -- it -- it -- to m -- to me, 1t seemed as if -- to me it seems now, like it was\nquite a large apartment. When you came in t -- 1-it was a long -- there was a corridor to the first\nroom, was my room, which was a -- as you -- as you came into the apartment, and then there was\na living room, and a hamsimmer, as my mother called it, with a schockladenshun, which she had\na key to, it means it was -- that\u2019s where she kept the chocolates, and they were like a treat when\nyou got some. And then the dining room, and then a long hallway, which led to the room that the\nhousekeeper had, and then the kitchen. And I think that was it, but it seemed very large. Maybe\nthey were very spacious rooms. It was sort of an elegant apartment, the way I remember it.",
        "A: Not that I recall -- I don\u2019t recall going, you know, upstairs or downstairs, or next building or\nsomething, to play with anyone. I\u2019m sure I must have, I -- I don\u2019t know, I must have blocked it or\nsomething, but I don\u2019t remember doing it.",
        "A: Hm, it\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t really know the answer. I guess maybe I was --\nmaybe I was subliminally aware of it, or even if you didn\u2019t speak about it, because right from the\nbeginning, I went to a -- I was sent to a Jewish school, and I knew why.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yes.",
        "A: They wanted me to escape the anti-Semitism. They were afraid for the an-anti-Semitism, so\nthat was -- I\u2019m trying to think, 1933 or something, six years old. I don\u2019t know when you begin\nschool, yeah.",
        "A: I was aware of it. Now, I don\u2019t know if it was before, or after entering school, or it was\nsimultaneous, but I do remember, I remember parades, and marches, and -- and you know, those\nbanners, and flags, and -- and Hitler going -- I f -- remember seeing Hitler going through the\nstreets with a -- you know, and that\u2019s -- I -- I -- maybe I\u2019ve heard it on -- on the radio, cause I\nprobably didn\u2019t wi -- makes sense that I didn\u2019t read the paper, but we did have a radio, and you\u2019d\nhear that screeching voice that we all know. Yes, I had strange feel -- I -- you certainly did feel\nit, but at the same time, we went to the movies, and I remember -- what was that place -- and it\nwas a -- where there was a big movie theater, in the center. It must have been near -- what was\nthat [indecipherable] main street there. Kudam.",
        "A: Yeah, Kuffus and dam, yeah, that\u2019s what the Berliners call it, Kudam, Krufust and dam, and\nthere was a movie that I was -- aside from Shirley Temple, I was fascinated by the Dionne\nquintuplets, and I can still see like a big advertisement, you know, above -- the marquis above\nthe mo-movie theater, like a painting or -- or a photograph, or whatever, huge, about those five\nquintuplets, and Gene Herschels, was an actor or something, who played the doctor -- or was he\nthe doctor -- I -- I --who -- who delivered them. Anyway, the whole thing fascinated me. You\u2019re\nbringing out very strange things in me, Amy.",
        "A: I was always -- I was -- it -- 1t was like a -- like a feeling, like a -- I ca -- I can\u2019t e -- with -- I --\nI don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember. I -- I -- I don\u2019t remember anybody calling me names, or I\nmight have blocked it -- or hitting me, or sa -- or anything like that, but it was a feeling of\ncaution, and always being told not to make waves, be careful, don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that, and --\nand that kind of thing, 1t was more that. But I guess I felt comfortable as far as anti-Semitism was\nconcerned, in the school. Not that I was happy in the school.",
        "A: I was just not happy in the school. I -- I did not -- I was not a good student, I felt very\nisolated, I felt lonely, I felt like an unhappy child, and -- I -- also I did not like Hebrew -- Hebrew\nlessons. I wasn\u2019t good in it, I didn\u2019t like it, I didn\u2019t want to take it. I -- I was -- I did -- I didn\u2019t\nenjoy school, I didn\u2019t feel popular, you know how youngsters have to feel popular. All that came\nmuch later in America.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I -- They were not that -- those kind of parents as they are today, or maybe then\nas well, but that\u2019s, I guess, where their age came in. They were very -- not psychologically\noriented. I don\u2019t think if -- if I did, that it didn\u2019t get me anywhere. They were the kind of parents\nthat my mother used to tell me, you know, as -- as, I have a headache -- children don\u2019t get\nheadaches, and that was the end of that, and that her mother said to her, translating it into\nEnglish, if she had a -- a sore throat, her mother would give her a scarf, put 1t around your neck\nand go to school, kind of thing. And -- What else did her mother say? She\u2019d always tell me that\n[indecipherable] in a -- pestering her the way kids do, I\u2019m thirsty, I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m hungry. She\nsays, \u201cWell then, lick a little salt, and you\u2019ll be thirsty, too.\u201d You know, it\u2019s sort of in fun, but\nnot -- not paying all that much attention to children\u2019s emotions.",
        "A: No, not really. Her -- I -- I remember something about -- again, it must be the radio, or my\nparents talking, or people talking, about these elections, and that it\u2019s -- it\u2019I] blow over, or they\nwere upset about the election, and I don\u2019t even know what year that was, \u201932 was it, that he came\ninto power? But like most people said, and like you he -- see in movies now, you know, on that\nsubject, like it\u2019ll blow over, and that crazy guy, and it\u2019s -- and that\u2019s just exactly how it was,\nthat\u2019s how I remember it, that this was like an aberration.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Well, I -- I remember going out to -- my father was very fond of going out to gunavagdet, was\none of those big parks, park and woods combination, cause Berlin is very large, and we\u2019d do that\nvery often, every Sunday. Not that -- I didn\u2019t like it, but that\u2019s what we did. And then had to\nhave a caf\u00e9 in there, and you could sit down and have cake, and something to drink. And at a\ntable very nearby, was Herman Goering, with his wife and kids. I think he had two. And when\nmy father saw that -- and I knew that that was like a very bad thing, I -- I f -- without having\nexplained too much to me, I don\u2019t know wh-what I knew, or what he was going to be doing, but\nhe paid the check, and we left there very quickly, I do remember that. And I remember another\nincident that -- with my Uncle Heinrich, my mother\u2019s brother, th -- who had the nerve, or maybe\nit was foolishness, to -- when they came around with a collection box, when the parade was\ngoing by, the Nazi parade, that he too -- he had a button in his pocket, and he put a button into\nthis box instead of money, which was a very dangerous thing to do. He told that -- you know,\nseemed like adventuresome, as long as he got away with it.",
        "A: I think they tried to shield me. Th-They did try to shield me from all this. It may not have\nbeen, you know, the most demonstrative, and affectionate -- although my mother was\naffectionate -- parents, but I think they were -- they did want to shield me from this, and things\nare murky because they didn\u2019t really explain things, didn\u2019t really talk to me about these things,\neven as I got older, because after all, I was -- by the time we were leaving, it -- I was 10. And\nthey also spoke -- and this was laughable, they spoke in English, in fr -- it\u2019s laughable because I -\n- when I learned English, I realized how little English they knew, but they talked in some kind of\nlanguage which I think was English, that I shouldn\u2019t understand. That was one of their, you\nknow, ways of -- that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s politics, money, children don\u2019t have to know these things, you\nknow. And I di -- It wasn\u2019t somebody that I -- I don\u2019t think I found it easy to confide in my\nparents. I -- Actually, I never really did, not to the day they died.",
        "A: No, no Yiddish, no, cause they were both born in Berlin, and they -- no Yiddish.",
        "A: Well, I know that th -- a-actually they sent me for -- 1t wasn\u2019t very long, nor successful, but\nthey send me for some English lessons, in Berlin, while I was still there, and maybe they had\ntaken some lessons, but I know they had these books, which I have to this day, I took it from my\nmother\u2019s house, she took it with her when we left, and it\u2019s called towsenwater English, and it\u2019s\ngot like little pamphlets in a holder, and it\u2019s like, you know, when you go to another country,\nthose simple phrases, and maybe they -- but I can\u2019t imagine that they just bought them, and were\nself taught, they probably took some lessons, I don\u2019t know why.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Certainly not my mother. And I don\u2019t think my father was either. I think my\nfather was interested, you know, as far as the newspaper and radio is concerned, but not\npolitically involved, but interested in what was going on, had to be.

        "A: Those were nice memories. I remember going to a resort called Shpindlermueller, which is in\nCzechoslovakia, with my parents, and I -- and I liked that very much, and I think I had kids to\nplay with there, and beautiful scenery, and they also sent me to some camp, I don\u2019t reme --\nmaybe it was in -- in the Hartz, A -- H-a-r-t-z, or z, I\u2019m not even su -- it\u2019s some kind of mountain\nrange, I\u2019m not sure where it was, but it was a children\u2019s camp. And I remember one time, this\nwas a fond memory of my father and myself, which was that one winter afternoon or something,\nI came into my parent\u2019s bedroom, and they had a surprise for me, and what was the surprise?\nThat my fa-father was taking me to -- with th -- just he and I were going away in the winter, to a\n-- he was going to go skiing or something, and he was leaving me at a camp. They had winter\ncamps, because in Germany, vacations are different than here. We didn\u2019t have a summer\nvacation from, you know, all of June, July and August. They were shorter, but the winter\nvacations were longer, so you had a winter camp. I don\u2019t know how much I enjoyed that camp,\nwhile learning how to ski, not so much, but I was thrilled to go away with him, and I remember\nan incident, we were very cold, we got off a train or something, on the way to this camp, and we\nwere on a -- like a toboggan with some guy, you know, going through the snow, and it was -- it\nwas great, and I was freezing, and he got some brandy or something, and he gave me a little sip\nof this to warm me up, and it was just like -- it was thrilling, that\u2019s how I remem -- remember tt.\nAnd then, I guess, eventually he came and picked me up, and maybe it was a week or something,\nit\u2019s -- I -- I don\u2019t know how long. A week, 10 days, in this children\u2019s camp, in the snow, in the\nwinter. But it was -- I just felt very privileged to be alone with my father.",
        "A: I would say about eight, I imagine. Didn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with Nazis, or with\nsomething that you could do, and all these things were -- were possible, you know, a -- it\u2019s -- I --\nI -- | imagine I\u2019m -- would have been that age, I don\u2019t think they would have sent me away much\nyounger than that, though it couldn\u2019t have been too much older, because by 10 -- by 10 years old,\nwe were leaving.",
        "A: Yes. You mean the -- just the economic hard time -- my father -- they were -- in the 20\u2019s if --\nfrom what I remember my father saying, of course, I didn\u2019t really know it was -- but he used to\ntalk about them all the time. He\u2019d always tell -- he said, you don\u2019t know, he said, what in -- oh,\nmaybe he told it to us -- told it to me here, when I was a youngster, that you have no idea what\nreal inflation 1s like. He said, \u201cWe had baskets full of money,\u201d and I would picture this. And he\nreally meant it literally, like a large basket full of money, that was like toilet paper, it was like\ndevalued maybe, you know, monthly, or whatever. And it took like a -- a shopping bag full to\nbuy a loaf of bread, he says, \u201cThat\u2019s what real inflation was like,\u201d that the money was worth --\nand he s -- and when I say that some sandwich or something was a little skimpy, he said -- he\nwould always say, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it was like. When I was a boy, we would get a slice of\nbread, with butter on it, and there would be a like a smoked piece of salami, or something, and\none thin slice, and we\u2019d move it around for the flavor, from one end to the other.\u2019 Those were\nthe little things, I remember he\u2019d tell me these things. But this was like in general, I\u2019d -- I did not\nexperience any poverty, and that was really, I guess, before. But of course, that -- that period of\ntime really led to Hitler, we all know that.",
        "A: Seems that way to me. It seems to me that in that respect, that my father definitely was -- not\nonly seems, but you know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m here to tell the story. We\u2019ll always be grateful to him that\nhe was very farsighted. As I\u2019ve said before, he was sort of secretive about money and this and\nthat, but 1t seems to me that he must have been kind of sophisticated about money and -- and\nmaybe had some money in -- in Holland, or maybe in America, or -- I don\u2019t know ho-how that\nwas done, it was never told to me, even later on, when I used to ask, but in some way, that we\ncould manage to be self sufficient, and get out without another person really vouching for us. It\u2019s\n-- You know, it was no such thing as welfare, nor would we have dreamt of such a thing, but -- to\nget into the country, but we were very, very, very lucky, because as I read and see things at Ellis\nIsland, reading history and how a few, you know, percentage-wise, how few Jews really were\nable to get out and come here, and be accepted in the United States the way we were, and I read\nthat it was -- I don\u2019t want to minimize the number, I forget, was it total 200,000 or something? It\nwas a very small number. Or maybe less, I don\u2019t know what that fi -- correct figure was, but I\nfeel very, very, very fortunate and that [indecipherable] in to this history in words that I can\u2019t\neven express. As I get older, I think about it more and more.",
        "A: Well, I guess I noticed I -- as I said that, it was almost you know, that when you see in a\nmovie, nowadays with that green smoke, you know, when they tried to make something like the\ncreeping crud, you know, it\u2019s something that you just felt, not to make waves, to -- don\u2019t draw\nattention to yourself. You see the Nazis walking around. The -- Then there was the issue about --\nthat I knew that my favorite, Lotte, had to leave, and no more maids. But as I said, my parents\nwere secretive, trying to keep that from me, I th -- and my mother became very, very nervous\nand depressed, and I think she had what we would really call, in layman\u2019s terms, a nervous\nbreakdown, before -- she did not want to leave Berlin. She really didn\u2019t want to leave, and then\nshe -- there was a period there when my father left -- he left for Holland, because that was -- I\nguess it was beginning of \u201938. I don\u2019t know how long he was gone, when he had to leave his\nbusiness. I don\u2019t think he sold it, he split up with his partner, he had a partner. Plachte and\nSolomon was the name of the firm, and could no longer do business, and he left for Holland.\nAnd my mother sent me to some -- I was on the outskirts of Berlin, at some friends of her\u2019s\nhome, with other girls in some room, and I -- I lived there for awhile. Oh, and right before that, I\nhad my appendix taken out, and to this day, I don\u2019t know if it was really necessary, or if I -- it\nwas one of those hysterical things, that I drew attention to myself, that I said I needed it, I -- that\nI had pain. I -- I don\u2019t know. But I did have it taken out, and I had to -- in those days you stayed\nin the hospital for a week, you know, with the sandbags on the -- on the incision. And then I\nwent to those -- this house, somebody else\u2019s apartment, it was sort of out in the suburbs of\nBerlin, while my mother, I guess, did something or other with the apartment, but I had to be\naway, and -- and then eventually, she and I left to go to join my father, hopefully, but --",
        "A: In 1933, I was only six years old. I\u2019m just thinking back. I -- Not per se, and of course they\ndidn\u2019t -- in -- in Berlin, I -- I have the impression, maybe incorrectly, but I think that things in a\nquote unquote, sophisticated urban center like Berlin, that things came more slowly to Berlin, as\nfar as, you know, real trouble and prejudice, it -- it came more slowly than in the little towns in --\nin Bavaria, and other little places, where people emigrated much sooner, those that did, and felt it\nmore. I think so. So, I -- I\u2019m not sure, but at the same time, my -- I would hear my father talking\nwith my -- it -- it -- 1t\u2019s -- it\u2019s a ch -- a child -- from a child\u2019s impression of -- that he was\nworking on something, trying -- you know, leaving. This was not done overnight, I\u2019m sure. One\nda -- you know, I -- I -- we left just like that, but I\u2019m sure this was planned in some way, and\nsecretively. And the children in the school, in the classes, they would just sort of disappear. One\nwould -- You know, this -- it wasn\u2019t something that was talked about. They were just, those that\ncould, left, and I think it was understood in the school, you know, one day would be one, one\nway would be another, and then you found out they went to Argentina, or this one went to\nShanghai or wherever, Australia. Or maybe I found that out afterwards, I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not sure\nmyself.",
        "A: Yes, I do remember them, and I wanted -- funny little things that come to your mind, I wanted\nlong hair. I wanted my hair in braids, just like all those ger -- little German girls, and my mother\nwouldn\u2019t let me, because the Hitler youth girls had their hair in -- in braids, and what they called\nuffenshawkern, which means monkey swings, which is if you take a braid, long braid, and then\nyou make it -- you double it and make a loop, and then they had bows, you know, and kind of\ncute, and I admired it, but she would never let me have my hair long, which bothered me, and I\ndid see a lot of Hitler youth, young boys and girls. I remember their outfits with the -- with the\nkerchief and a leather knot, sort of like boy scouts, and yet not like boy scouts, oh yes.",

        "A: Ah, it\u2019s -- this is before you had to wear a star, that happened later, but the benches -- and\nthere were benches in the park that were painted yellow, for Jews to sit on, and it was like, you\nknow, when, from out of nowhere, you know, now in retrospect it may not seem so terrible, but\nif you imagine it, you know, it was like a noose tightening, it just seemed incredible, you know,\nand -- and who is going to sit on those benches? And I -- I do remember that, and that must have\nbeen shortly -- I\u2019m sure there were other things happening at the time, oth-other restrictions, but I\ndon\u2019t remember what they were.

        "A: Well, you know, I gave the Holocaust Museum my autograph album, and in there you can see\nwhat they wrote, you know, and in those days it was not done like here, it was really something.\nWhen you gave somebody an autograph album, they took it home, they wrote very carefully,\nthey drew little pictures, or -- or put on decals, and as you can see, it\u2019s really quite interesting,\nand they didn\u2019t take it lightly, not scribbled in, as you can see the contrast, you\u2019 ll see fa -- I have\nsome from junior high school in New York, and you just scribbled whatever. I wish you -- I wish\nyou luck, I wish you that, da-da da-da, and one 15, and just went on, you know, from public\nschool to junior high school. No gus -- A-And you could -- Some of them sort of wished me\nwell, and when you read the poems in German, you realize that they were -- it was sort of like\nthe end of something, like they were -- we were going to part, you say, well, we\u2019re just little\ngirls, it wasn\u2019t like we were going on to high school, or something. It was like as if we were\ngoing to part.",
        "A: Again, an interesting question. I really don\u2019t remember, yi -- they were, again, not the kind of\nparents that would discuss anything with me, and I just -- and I never really questioned it, even in\nmy -- until my young adulthood. You know, they were what they were, and I had to do what they\nsaid, and I was not -- my opinion was not considered, or -- it was like a fait accompli. And, but I\nthink by the time I went where my mother send me, to that home that seems so blurry in my\nmind, with these other girls who lived there, I know somebody a -- I guess she was unraveling\nher apartment situation, or selling furniture, or -- I don\u2019t know what she was doing while I was\naway in the suburbs. That\u2019s when I realized -- and also at -- at the same time, I was recovering\nfrom that appendix surgery, which was quite something the way they -- old-fashioned way that\nthey did it in those days. That\u2019s when I realized that things were really changing, that\u2019s what I\nseem to remember. And then she came and got me, but I don\u2019t remember any real discussions\nthat we were -- nor did -- let me say at this point, that they never expected to go anywhere but to\nHolland. That was the end of the journey, hopefully that we were going to get there, cause that\u2019s\nwhere my father was, they had no intention of going to America, or anywhere else. That seemed\nfar away enough, which sounds crazy today, but not then.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure that I did. I\u2019m sure that I did, yeah.

He was a good man, but\nnot cut out for raising a very young child. He was already very set in his ways, you know, and\nvery German. I had a parak -- I was very lonely that I -- I w -- I said that before, but I wanted a\nsister, or a brother, or a dog, or a cat, in that order. And I used to have recurring -- recurrent\ndreams about that, very, very often, and I felt very -- I really wanted that desperately, one --\nwhen I never got it -- didn\u2019t get any of them.

        "A: Yes, yes, I did.

I was very\nproud of that, you know, with the Olympic circles, and -- and I -- I remember it, maybe it was in\nthe newspaper or magazines. Surely it was, it must have been a very big thing in Berlin.

But you know, I was 10, and\nthey didn\u2019t talk to me, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult, besides the memory, of course. But they really\ndidn\u2019t discuss these things with me.",
        "A: Well, I loved going to the movies, which of course wasn\u2019t very often, but love it, I love it to\nthis day. And I was absolutely crazy about Shirley Temple. She seemed to personify everything\nglamorous, and -- you know, the way people felt about America and Hollywood, and I had, not a\nShirley Temple doll, but I got those -- I guess they were all made for -- for export, like a paper\ndolls, and then you cut them out, and put the clothes on -- on the -- and I played with it for hours.\nAnd then of course, what I had, the way ba -- the way kids here have baseball cards, this was my\nprize possession, they were actual black and white photographs of Shirley Temple in these\ndifferent movies that she was in, which came in sets like baseball cards, and I bought them, and I\nhave a -- and I had a photograph album of her, and also I collected another -- it was a young\nAustrian movie star, her name was Trowdel Stark. And I have this album, I took it with me, I\nhave it to this day, and I probably -- probably nobody else would have it. I should write Shirley\nTemple Black and tell her about her album. And once in awhile, when I see these movies on TV,\nfor instance when she\u2019s wearing a -- when she was seven or eight, whatever, and wearing a satin\npajama with appliqued bunnies on it, and I\u2019ll look at her in this scene, I say, \u201cOh, my God, I\u2019ve\nseen this picture, this photograph of her in that particular outfit so many times, leafing through\nmy album.

I know I have this feeling,\nfrom my father especially, that he -- you could almost say it\u2019s almost like an anti-Semitic feeling\nabout Jews from eastern Europe, you know, with payess, and with, you know, that kind of\nclothing, and all the other accoutrements, I had that feeling, carrying it over to America, that he\nfelt like he was a different kind of Jew, very secular. And didn\u2019t really -- And s-spoke no\nYiddish, I don\u2019t think they were brought up with that. We ate -- my mother\u2019s cooking was not\nparticularly wonderful, not everybody\u2019s mother is a good cook, or a great housekeeper.

When we went to seders, they were in New York, in the early days, people that they met.\nNow, we were refugees, and we were at other people\u2019s houses, but it\u2019s not something that we\nhad.

And one day, everything changed. I walked into her living room, and I\nse -- now I saw a huge picture of Hitler over her couch in her living room, and her older boys\nwere in SS uniforms, and I knew what that meant, they were in black uniforms, and they were\nvery tall. Course I was just a little kid, I mean they seemed like, you know, really men, scary\nyoung men in that dreaded SS uniform.

And we were in a town called Bedtime first, and these people sort of\nhid us. We were there one or two nights. And it was a border town, and we stayed 1n -- in an\nattic, and we did not come down for meals or anything. They were very nice, I guess it was in\nGermany, and they -- they hid us, even in those days. And then -- I don\u2019t know quite why -- why\nwe couldn\u2019t go directly to Berlin -- to Holland, but we didn\u2019t. And then we made a connecting\ntrain on another day, and that\u2019s when these -- these German Nazis came in. There was a\nconductor, German, you know, regular conductor, but then the Nazis came in, looking at your\npassport, or officers of some sort, and my mother said, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d And I, of course --\nshe se -- he said, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m 10, but my mother said I\nshould say I\u2019m nine,\u201d or something like that. And my mother thought she would die, she was\nready to kill me, cause any discrepancy could, you know, if -- I don\u2019t know why I did that, or --\nit was one way or the other, but it -- they let it slide, but I remember that, and I remember how I\nfelt inside, that I knew I made a big mistake, but that\u2019s kids. And then we did get there, and then\nmy father met us. Where we were, I don\u2019t know. Maybe went directly to that town, to -- or\nmaybe it was in The Hague, and then got to it -- but we stayed in a boarding house until --\nthrough the summer -- spring and summer of 1938, til we left for New York, and --",
        "A: Yes. It was like 1-in a house, you know in a -- a boarding house. The reason I say boarding\nhouse is what I remember is that we had these communal meals, and as a matter o -- there was an\nactor at -- there, at that boarding house, at -- I didn\u2019t know it then, but I since then saw him the --\nhe was in many, many American musicals. His name was S.Z. Sakall, S-a-k-a-l-l, or something,\nand he was called Cuddles in a lot of movies. He was in movies, you know, in musicals with\nBetty Grable, and Don Ameche and played a -- the roly-poly, good-natured funny role in lots of\nmovies, but he was emigrating, and we had these communal meals, you know, like in a boarding\nhouse, which I\u2019ve never had before.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t really know what we were doing, again the secretiveness, the secrecy, I\nshould say, until -- oh, I must say an asi -- a footnote, I saw -- everybody has bicycles in Holland,\nyou know, and we saw the queen, Queen Wilhelmina and her daughter, riding around on her\nbicycle, and -- very, very casual, not like England. One day, my father said that he was going to\nRotterdam, to see if he\u2019d get tickets to come to -- to go to New York, that he -- and the reason, I\nguess by that time they told me that much, that he could not -- he was under the impression that\nhe could work there, or start a business, or something, but he could not. It wasn\u2019t permitted. So,\nit would have been just a question of time until his money would run out, so he went to\nRotterdam, he said he was going to Rotterdam to see if we get tickets to go to New York, that\u2019s\nhow it seemed. And if we could, we would, and if not, not. It seemed so casual, like if we can get\ntheater tickets we\u2019d go, and if we can\u2019t, we can\u2019t. And he came back a day or two later, and he\nhad tickets to -- on -- on a ship called the Startendam, and we went. And when I\u2019d ask him about\nthis, you know, years later my daughters would always urge me, \u201cTalk to Papa, talk to Papa. Ask\nhim how this happened.\u201d But he never wanted to talk about it, you know, he\u2019d always say,\n\u201cAch,\u201d you know, \u201cstop, I don\u2019t want to,\u201d -- you know, he\u2019d gesture with his hand, and he al --\nhe\u2019d say, \u201cAch, you think it was easy? Ah, it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d So I presume what he meant by that\nwas bribes. What else could it have been, you know? But he must have had the foresight to have\nmoney or whatever, cause that\u2019s the only way you got anywhere in those days.",
        "A: No, I guess they were good for something, in -- at that time, y-you have to remember, it\nchanged like monthly, or less. You know, there were always new -- I\u2019m sure they would have\nbeen worthless. I -- I mean in -- that was September. We arrived here in New York, in September\n-- on September 18\", 1938, and the Crystal Night was not even two months later. So, the timing\nwas very, very fortuitous. And we were hearing things, we were hearing things, you know,\nreading things about, I guess the -- I -- I -- I -- well, not the anschluss, but Hitler going into the\nother countries, or maybe it was right after, because my father, very soon after we got here, the\nfirst thing that he did was to get -- send tickets to my Uncle Martin, and his wife and my cousin\nIlsa, the ones in Berlin, for him to ge -- to -- to emigrate to Shanghai. For some reason or other,\nthat was easier. Couldn\u2019t get her to the United States, but that was possible, but they didn\u2019t use\nthem, they didn\u2019t use them. And I have found out since, here at the museum, that unfortunately\nthey were all killed in Auschwitz, the three of them. I sa -- I looked it up, and it was very -- it\nwas very sad, and to -- to actually see it, you know, on paper. I never knew.",
        "A: The trip, the way I remember it, was quite pleasant. I mean, it was a -- I guess a Dutch ship,\nand it was, you know, just on the cusp of something, they were -- it was a real -- it was a -- it -- it\nwas like going on shi -- on a ship. It was not a refugee ship, we were going second class, which I\nrealized not long a -- not long ago, when I went to Ellis Island, and I was listening with the\nheadset to Tom Brokaw, I found out why I never went to Ellis Island, because we were -- I never\nknew, we just got off the ship when we got here, and cousins, you know, second cousins,\nwhatever, were waiting for us here. But the reason was, if you weren\u2019t in third class, you didn\u2019t\nhave to go to Ellis Island. That\u2019s what he said, and -- but it was quite pleasant. I remember\nmeeting this American family, with their children, who had gone to Europe on vacation, cause it\nwas, you know, early September, summer vacation with their children, and they befriended me\nbecause the mother, the father, they wanted their children to meet a little -- a real little German\ngirl. And I remember they took me into the lounge of the ship, for a -- in-into the cocktail lounge\nin the afternoon, for a drink. And this drink turned out to be som -- it was horrible, and it turned\nout to be Coca-Cola, which was something that I had never -- 1-it\u2019s a very, very strange flavor, if\nyou \u2019ve never ever had it, and I don\u2019t like it to this day. But -- And then I -- My mother bought\nme -- [ had it til not so long ago, a little sailor doll from that ship, with a -- with a little sailor hat,\nthe way they had them, you know, a little white, like a little brechen 1s it? And the little black\nribbon around it, with the name of the ship, and it was like a little stuffed doll, with velvet, and I\nlu -- I wanted it desperately, I wanted this doll, and they did get it for me, and I had it for years\nand years and years, you know, little sailor from -- as a souvenir. I do not ha -- remember this as\nan unpleasant sh -- sh -- it wa -- it was like going -- sort of like on some kind of vacation. I mean,\nI didn\u2019t know the difference, I\u2019d never been on a ship before, maybe it was pretty -- I wouldn\u2019t\nsay primitive, but maybe Spartan, but it -- 1t seemed fine to me.",
        "A: I must have, but I -- it\u2019s -- for some reason, it has like no -- no memory, or no great meaning.\n[ -- | -- ] -- I just -- of course I must have known, I mean, we were going to -- but it had no -- I\ndidn\u2019t know what -- what to expect.",
        "A: What I -- First seeing, I remember getting -- I don\u2019t really recall s -- being o -- seeing the\nStatue of Liberty, like in the movies, I guess it\u2019s all mixed up with a million documentaries that\nI\u2019ve seen. But I do remember the pier, getting off the ship, and I guess they did have people\ncoming onto the ship, you know, it wasn\u2019t such -- you didn\u2019t just get off. People who -- you\nknow, health examiners, or whatever, you know, and -- were looking at your papers, it\u2019s a whole\nprocess, and then eventually getting off on this huge pier in New York, and then getting into\nthese relatives\u2019 car. These relatives were my mother\u2019s relatives, and -- who were -- the -- the\nwoman was the sister of Arthur Fiedler, the conductor of the Boston Pops, which didn\u2019t mean\nanything to me at the time. And I remember get -- driving from the pier to this -- wherever we\nstayed in that first apartment that they rented for us -- probably did, and I said something ab --\nyou know, I said, \u201cOh, these skyscrapers, they\u2019re not so tall,\u201d or something like that, I said,\nhaving expected -- \u201cThey don\u2019t seem like anything so big.\u201d I remember saying something like\nthat.",
        "A: In German, of course, I didn\u2019t speak a word of English, not a word. It was always just done.",
        "A: Yes, that was a day after my birthday, it was September 18\", 1938, I do remember that very\nwell.",
        "A: 11 on that day.",
        "A: That must be when I got the sailor doll, I think, as a present. Yeah, my birthday was always\nyou know, to me, a big deal. After all, I was an only child, and children like their birthdays, so I\nthink that probably celebrated it in some manner on the ship.",
        "A: Mm, yes, I do remember -- I remember the s -- the school very well. Eventually, after a few\nyears, we moved across the street from that school, but at -- the first apartment was, I remember\nthe address, 650 West 172\" Street. That was off between Broadway and Fort Washington\nAvenue, and the public school, PS 173 was on the corner of Fort Washington Avenue and 173\"\nStreet, so I just had to walk dow -- you know, two blocks, one down and one across. I remember\nan interview, vaguely. My father taking me to school, and they telling me, whoever, maybe it\nwas the principal, that -- what grade they were putting me into. They put me into four A. In those\ndays the semesters were split up, A and B, ha-half a year, you know, not like fourth grade, A and\nB. So it was the beginning of the f-fourth year, four A, which was five sem -- five semesters less\nthan what I should have been in, two and a half years. And they said that when I would learn\nEnglish, that it would be sort of automatic that I would catch up with myself, which was not true.\nAnd I remember feeling very -- feeling very bad about that, you know, w-with -- with these\nyoung kids. Again, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a filmy kind of dreamy memory, seeing myself in that class, but I\nwas not happy to be with children that were that much younger, and I didn\u2019t speak any English,\nand also, I don\u2019t remember other children that I was -- could be friends with, or drawn to,\nbecause there were other little German girls or boys in the class. It was just me. So I guess they\ncame later, or at other times. And eventually I did become a very good student, and it was only\nbecause of that that I skipped a lot of grades, and I wen -- went to summer school somewhere in -\n- you know, before finishing public school, that I made up at least a year or two, and then I --\nthen in junior high school, I was put in what they called RA, it was called rapid advance classes,\nyou know, for kids who were doing well, and made it two years out of three, or something like\nthat. But in the end, after high school, graduating high school, I just a pi -- I came out just about\nright, so if I hadn\u2019t been, I\u2019d be going to school til I was -- the end of my 18\" year, I think. But\nschool, I remember my f -- early on, I had to -- I came home with a poem, which I had to learn\nby heart. And my father, as I told you, was -- didn\u2019t have much patience, and I just couldn\u2019t get it\ninto my head, I couldn\u2019t seem to grasp it, the engli -- an-and he smacked me, you know, for\nagain not getting it right, and it turned out to be \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner,\u201d that\u2019s what that\npoem was. I didn\u2019t enjoy school ats -- at first, but the kids were -- I -- I guess they were all -- all\nright. I -- I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember them being particularly -- I felt isolated, but I\ndon\u2019t remember being, you know, taunted, or -- particularly one way or another, particularly\ncruel, or -- but isolated. And early on, going to the -- as a school outing, going to the 1939\nWorld\u2019s Fair, that was very thrilling. I re -- I remember doing that, and enjoyable. And I think I\nonly did it once after that, on my own with family or somebody else. But once I got the language,\nthen -- and also I was becoming a teenager, I became a much happier child, and really sort of\nfound myself, which wasn't easy with my parents and these circumstances, you know, little\napartment and I was -- I felt -- I never had a room of my own, I slept in the living room. My\nparents never had a bedroom again, ever. The other room was -- was had always two rooms, and\nit was sort of like a -- with two couches in it, each -- they slept separately, sort of like a studio,\nlike you sometimes get in a motel, L-shaped, one couch here, one couch there. In that apartment\nas well as the next apartment, as well as their last apartment, long after I was married. And I slept\nin the living room, I was -- this is sort of personal, has -- I don\u2019t know, much to do with anything\non this subject, but I was always -- well, I guess sort of ashamed of the way we lived, and also,\nyou know, I didn\u2019t -- the friends that I eventually made, their apartments seemed much nicer, and\nthey had sisters and brothers. It was not all that happy at home, and my mother was working\nright from the beginning here. My father, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t. He -- I guess he came with a\nlittle too much money, that he didn\u2019t need to be forced into taking a job, or -- or getting -- or\nstarting all over, or like most of their friends -- friend\u2019s husbands did. Some of them were\ndoctors, and they started off, you know, the way they do, doing I don\u2019t know, working as -- I\ndon\u2019t know, in -- in -- learning how to s -- you know, their English, and taking medical exam --\nand much more difficult things they -- but my father never really did, and my mother -- my\nmother worked in the -- no, that came later. She worked in people\u2019s apartments, cleaning or\nsomething, it -- it -- I -- it\u2019s not such a happy childhood. And she was not happy with my father\u2019s\nbeing home, so she got up and did something, and eventually she worked in the garment center\nin New York, which she liked. She liked being out on her own, and working.",
        "A: Not in the way that I presume you mean. Never at a job where he had to be there nine to five,\nor answer to somebody. He did something with -- with fluorescent light bulbs, he sold them to --\nto businesses or something, for their fixtures. It was never quite clear to me what he did. I think\nhe mainly played with his stocks, and -- with his stocks.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: I think -- now that, often I think did come up, that he thought that he had enough money, and -\n- invested in stocks, that he could live on that, indefinitely, for the rest of his life. I don\u2019t think he\n-- he counted on -- what did we have, depression, inflation, whatever it was, that it turned out not\nto be so. I thought he -- He thought he could live better, or maybe they were just ve-very frugal\npeople, but they always lived very simply, I think, sort of below their means. And my mother\nwas really never -- never really adjusted to America. She always dreamt of her life in Berlin, and\nhow it was. She was never really, really happy here. Never really perfected her English, neither\ndid my father, even though my father read the paper, and -- with a dictionary next to him,\nlooking up every word that he didn\u2019t know, he did that. But -- But n-neither one of them really\nbecame all that Americanized. They lived up in Washington Heights, we lived there all their\nlives, with the other so -- you know, so-called refugees. And they enjoyed that life, and\neverybody spoke German, and they had caf\u00e9 and kuckin in each other\u2019s house, and -- and other --\nyou know, and that was the -- but the other people, who came with less, most of them lived a\nmuch better life. They went to Florida, and they went here, and did this and does that. I always\nhad the feeling that my parents never really -- never really became Americanized, and allowed\nthemselves to live a really full life. Always like -- it\u2019s something from that change of coming\nhere in the way they did, I think.",
        "A: I would say so, yeah. That\u2019s 1-1t seems to me, even though I was a little kid, that it was a much\n-- | mean, my mother never had a cleaning lady. I mean, nor was the apartment all that f -- was\nshe that fastidious. Didn\u2019t care about those things. No, it was always very modest, and the way\nwe ate, and -- and what she bought, and -- and the dinn -- it was always sort of cheap, which 1s\nsomething I had to learn to get over.",
        "A: I guess German and English both, sort of mixed together. And then, of course, when I got\nolder, o-other than the American friends that I had from the different schools, I also had f-\nfriends, you know, at ca -- from wa -- one way or another, friends who also were emigr-emigra --\nimmigrants? And I knew that they spoke German, and we would -- used to -- we u -- whatever\ncame to mind first, we\u2019d sort of mix it up, because we knew that we understood each other.

Like when you read documents, you\nknow, that you get, or from the [indecipherable] stuff, my prunci -- pronunciation 1s good, but a\nlot of words that I don\u2019t know, and the sentences are so endless, you know, when you read that\nstuff, I forgot what the beginning was when you get to the end.",
        "A: Another good question. Yeah, I was a little older than some, so it -- it was -- 1t was\nchallenging, and I remember the penmanship, and the -- the script was something different,\nbecause -- never thought of that til just now, that the script in Germany that I learned, which was\nquite difficult, was different than the -- the way we write here. And -- But then they had\npenmanship classes, we all had to take penmanship. And it -- it took awhile. I think it -- it -- it\nwasn\u2019t all that easy, and how I learned it, I don\u2019t know. But my parents were not for education. It\nwas a difficult -- they were difficult. I wanted to learn how to play the piano, for instance,\ndesperately. There was a period in my life, you know, like a window of time, and finally I mean,\nI nagged so -- so much that my mother did give me piano lessons, but I had to practice, and I\npracticed for awhile in the -- in the piano teacher\u2019s house, which is ridiculous, I mean, how long\ncan you keep that up? And I didn\u2019t, and then after awhile -- but I loved doing it, and I lu -- but\nthen I -- I lost interest because they wouldn\u2019t let me. They were not, in that respect, not like\nEuropeans, who are so much for education -- Jew -- I mean, European Jews. No, they fought me\nin college, and I just needed to learn a trade, something to -- to -- that I could make a living, or\ncould support myself, if necessary, yeah.",

And somehow then, my mother did\nfind out -- and of course she was in touch with her sister in Palestine, and she knew -- she found\nout, I as -- surely that she must have been involved with those organizations, because how did\nshe find out that my Aunt Kate was in Theresienstadt, survived Theresienstadt, and somehow\ncame to the United States, and she was just thrilled to have her sister here, because she was very\nclose to that sister, as a child. They were closer in age than anybody else, and they were just\ncloser. But it wasn\u2019t to be for very long, because she died before I got married, and I got married\nin 1947, my first marriage, and she wasn\u2019t there. But I do remember her coming, and she was a\ntough bird, and I would -- used to be very angry at her, because she was another one of those,\nlike my father would, in Germany, go back to Germany, always afraid I\u2019d have too much -- too\nmuch pleasure, like a birthday party, and go to the movies all in one, and no, no, no, no, and she\nwas of that same -- she was tough, she was very smart, and was, I think, quite a figure, an\nimportant person in Theresienstadt, you know, like a -- a leader within the circles, whatever they\ndid there, and a Bridge player, and so on and so forth, and I think she even had a romance there,\nwhich I wrote in the -- one of those guest books that they have, when I was there last year. It was\n-- | -- | met that man, they both survived, even though she was married to somebody that -- you\nknow, not a happy marriage, she managed to fall in love there, which 1s sort -- sort of, you know,\nas an adult, life goes on, even those things happen there. But anyway, when she came, she -- I\nwould be angry with her for not -- for being str-strict, you know, and -- and sort of siding with\nmy father on issues, whatever they were, things that I wanted to do. It was not -- not easy for me\nas a -- the upbringing of my parents. I think that was one of the reasons I got married very early.\nThe other was that my mother pushed me into it.",

Did we hear about it at that time? Did we?\nYes, we did? Well, if -- if it was so, then we -- then we did, and we were very upset.

I went out with -- my friend had a brother who was in the army, and he took me this -- my\nfirst date, my first play. Because he was in the army, he got tickets to see \u201cOklahoma!\u201d\u2019, which\nwas a play, and nobody could get tickets for anything, except G.I.\u2019s, you know, and I was thrilled\nto go to the theater. But I thought through -- and -- and then you -- you got some -- the soldiers\ngave you their -- their -- whatever they are, insignias, the bar from a lieutenant, or -- and these\nwere the -- and working for the -- what was it, AWVS, something, and do-doing things for the\nwar effort. I remember, as a kid in the -- as a -- in junior high school, doing things after work,\nsaving silver foil, the ration stamps. I -- I see it, myself, as like a little American girl, an-and\nseeing it through the eyes of American soldiers, and sailors, and Marines, and Air Force, and the\nsongs and the tremendous patriotism that we all had. That\u2019s what I think this generation doesn\u2019t\nquite have that, it\u2019s a -- and of course, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, I mean, he was like a god to\nme at the time.

        "A: Irememb -- Yes, I think I did. I -- When I finished junior high school -- was just telling this to\na friend of mine the other day, cause my father was such a disciplinarian, that he insisted that I\ngo to -- everybody was leaving for George Washington High School from this -- almost\neverybody, all my Jewish friends, yes, they were mostly Jewish. Somehow you just -- naturally\nyou gravitate to them, you know? He insisted that I go to Washington Irving High School, which\nis a sort of high school that -- with an emphasis on needle trades, because he -- being that\u2019s the\nbusiness he was in, he wanted me to become a designer, or learn how to sew. He pushed it so\nthat to this day I hate sewing. And then, at any rate, I -- under duress, I went to George Washing\n-- to Washington Irving High School. Had to take the train downtown, all my friends went to the\nother school. And one of the -- on the first days in the school, I saw that everybody was Italian,\nand I sort of felt I had to -- sort of -- I felt out of place, and one girl said to me, she says, \u201cYou\nwant to hear a joke?\u201d Said, \u201cSure.\u201d And she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the fastest thing on two legs?\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t know, what?\u201d And she said, \u201cA Jew passing a draft board.\u201d When I heard that, I\nreally put my foot down, I went home to my father, I didn\u2019t want to be there in the first place. I\nsaid, \u201cI am not staying in that school, I am not going to stay there.\u201d And I insisted on being\ntransferred to George Washington High School, which they did do, and then I was much happier,\nand I was a very -- was a good student, I was an arrister, and I sort of found myself. Actually in\njunior high school, I -- I did well, but then I, you know, found myself in my teenage years, but\nthey were turbulent, I was never -- I had a lot, I think, to contend with as a teenager, more than,\nyou know, had I been born here with parents who were, but that\u2019s obvious.",
        "A: I cannot remember when that was, but I know f -- I know it was uf -- early on, when they\nbegan to do that, it wasn\u2019t really I think the German government so much, as the Berlin\ngovernment, because they were getting these checks, you know, so -- from the German\ngovernment, for lost property, or -- my mother got something that was sort of like the equivalent\nof -- loosely speaking, like Social Security, because she could prove her -- she had her\nemployment records or something, and taxes that were taken out, sounds strange, but it was\nbased on that.

She worked in -- he manufactured hats in Kemnets, and when\nshe lived it -- she worked there and somewhere else. Not a profession, but something, you know,\nsales. And so there was a connection between her and -- and the government, and they were\ncontact -- I know they didn\u2019t contact -- my parents didn\u2019t contact them, because when they got\nthis information -- also, it was around Washington Heights, everybody was -- knew about it, or\npeople here and there were getting these invitations.

        "A: Let me just add, yes, she did really want to go places, because she finally went to -- to\nEurope, I forgot about that, my mother, by herself. She went to Israel to visit her sister, she said\nshe wanted to go. Her sister Anna. Kate had died in 1946, I guess, because I got married in \u201947,\nand she was no longer alive, died of cancer here, recurrence. But, she went by herself, my father\ndid not want to go anywhere, and she picked herself up, she went to Rome by herself, and she\nwent to Israel by herself, and that was pretty cons -- for her, quite a feat, and she loved it, but that\nwas, you know, the biggest trip. And she always used to talk about when her sister Anna, and her\nbrother-in-law, who lived very well, very comfortably, took her and her mother, Frieda to Nice\non the Riviera. Must have been in the early 30\u2019s or something. No, I don\u2019t know when it was.\nWas it after she was married? I don\u2019t know, but how she loved that trip, and how glamorous and\nhow wonderful it was, you know. So, she might -- she might have wanted to go, but never did.",
        "A: From Berlin, yes I started to receive a lot of things. Some things were annual, some things\nwere quarterly. Annual were calendars, very beautiful calendars, I -- I think I get those to this\nday, they\u2019re still doing that. But they sent books, you know, Berlin 1979 - \u201970 - \u201980 - \u201981, every\nyear, and always relating to Jews, they were like soft cover books, very interesting, in German,\nwith pictures, and I\u2019d get something about a famous cartoonist, who had -- her name was Zille,\nZ-1-|-l-e, and -- who died at -- in the late 1920\u2019s, and was very famous and it was very funny, to -\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: And among these books, you know, that had -- we receive every year, they we -- in 1988, I\nbelieve it was, I got a book about the Jews of Berlin, and it went back from the 19\" century, into\nthe 20\" century, up until 1939 or \u201940, whenever, you know, something like that. And I leaf\nthrough this book, and I couldn\u2019t believe it, there was a picture of me and my cla -- in my\nclassroom, with me in it, my -- all the -- all my classmates from, I think, 1935. And when I saw\nthat, I said, I\u2019ve got to -- I said, \u201cHow did they got ahold of this picture?\u201d Well, obviously,\nsomebody else had the same class picture, I found that out subsequently, somebody who lived in\nEngland, and submitted it to them. At any rate, I -- I -- it -- it piqued my interest, and I now -- I\nthought I wanted to go to Berlin, and get this trip that my parents never took advantage of. So I\ngot in touch, it\u2019s a lengthy involvement, I won\u2019t go into it. And we had a lot of corens --\ncorrespondence back and forth. I told him about the picture, they were very interested in the\npicture, and I traced it, and said I could identify the g -- most of the girls to this day, which I did\ndo, and then they published it in yet another publication that they had, a g -- like a newsletter,\nthat went to all former Berliners, and I started receiving mail from all these people because they -\n-  -- it said something about Anita Sockol in New York, blah, blah, blah, and I started receiving\nthem. And because of this -- so I had two things going on at the same time, it was very exciting\nreally, receiving these letters, and also questions. Did I know somebody named Ilsa Plachte, and\n-- because that was a very good friend of mine, and where does she live? And I would call that\nperson back, they lived in Columbus, Ohio. I said, \u201cThat was my cousin, I heard that, you know,\nshe died in Auschwitz.\u201d Other people wrote to me, they were -- th -- this woman just knew the\nname, and as I was busy writing and corresponding with these other people, I was also talking to\nthis woman in Berlin, and sort of pushing it to get the trip. She said I was too young, if I wanted\nto come with my mother. And I said, \u201cAt this point, my mother couldn\u2019t possibly travel.\u201d And --\nBut because of it, I think they gave it to me. And I did go on the trip to Berlin, in 1989, in the\nspring. March, I believe it was, before the wall came down. And it was a very interesting trip,\nwith many -- with wonderful things that they did for us, and yet you had such -- such strange\nfeelings, everybody did, you know. And I have a cousin who lives -- second cousin who lived in\nBerlin at the time, and the free time that we had, he showed me the railroad tracks, you know,\nover a bridge, that\u2019s where the Jews were shipped to Auschwitz from, and a little doorway that\nlooked like a closet, you know, you\u2019d walk right by. And he said, \u201cIn there is an Orthodox shul,\u201d\nwhich you\u2019d -- you\u2019d never think there was anything in there. And told me -- So, I had very\nmixed feelings. At night I couldn\u2019t sleep from all the things that were -- that my -- my feelings\nwere, you know, accosted with. And we met the mayor of Berlin, he talked to us, and there were\ncocktail parties. We met a senator, a woman senator, and they made these speeches, dear former\ncitizens, and it was very strange. Very difficult to explain the -- can\u2019t say love, but the -- some\nkind -- some kind of memories, and yet the -- the anti-German feeling that you -- that sort of\nrides over everything. It -- It was very strange, and we went to see -- everybody ran to s -- to\nwherever they lived. And there was a man who was [indecipherable] from this area, I think he\nwas from Maryland, and he lived near where I lived, and we went to -- by train through eastern\nBerlin, to where I lived, and the address existed, but not the building, so they must have kept the\naddress, but -- you know, but it was some modern, ugly building, cause of -- obviously that\nwhole area was bombed out, and like rebuilt.",

        "A: Well, they were, of course, all hand picked people for this thing. They were younger, and very\nsensitive to the issues, you know, but I -- I realized that. And one -- I had a very interesting\nconversation on one of the days with one of the tour guides, when we went to the -- not the\nReichstag, but the -- that stadium, the Olympic stadium where Hitler spoke and he showed us,\nyou know, and I -- then I remembered it from, I guess newsreels. I forgot to mention newsreels,\nwas 1 -- cause there was no TV, but how did I hear the voice? Of course, it wasn\u2019t just the radio,\nnewsreels in the movies. And he said that h-he -- something I never thought of, he said, \u201cOh\nyes,\u201d he said, \u201cit still exists very much.\u201d He said every Sunday when he goes to his grandparents\nhouse for Sunday dinner with his -- he -- they talk about the old -- good old days, you know,\nthey\u2019re died in the wool -- I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re still Nazis, but they long for those Hitler days,\nand they talk about it. And he said there was a lot of neo-Nazi stuff going on that he knew of,\nand he felt -- he and his fianc\u00e9e, that if it got any worse -- this was in 1989, that he was going to\nmove to Canada, he just didn\u2019t like what was going on. It was interesting to hear it from a young\nGerman fellow. And I really didn\u2019t think about that two generations back, that the young ones\nare exposed to all that, and they\u2019re still alive and -- and not ashamed, or anything. They are what\nthey are.",
        "A: No. No, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t.

That this was once your home, and yet\nit\u2019s not recognizable, it\u2019s -- I -- I -- I can\u2019t put it into words, the -- the feeling. Like a real love-\nhate relationship.",
        "A: No, but I\u2019m sure I could have. I was in a control group, really -- controlled group. We went --\nThey -- We saw what they wanted us to see, you know? Took lovely boat ride on the river, and\noh, the whole thing was conducted in German, though, and had wonderful -- we went to the\ntheater, everything was brand new, the acoustics, the sou -- everything was better than -- I -- I\nnever ex -- I never expected to have such a trip, you know, I thought it was -- I didn\u2019t know what\nto expect. Didn\u2019t know everything would be so deluxe. The hotel, the -- even, you go -- show\nyour passport at a certain bank, and they gave you money, spending money. It\u2019s all part of it, I\nmean, they do a very, very good job, so that you go home and say it was wonderful, which I\ncan\u2019t really say it wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yeah. They -- A tremendous difference, tremendous difference, it -- 1t was like night and day.\nEast Berlin was very d -- you know, just like you would expect a Communist place to look like,\nvery old and stodgy and -- and neglected, and even the food. We had coffee and cake or\nsomething there in the afternoon, was awful. And when you went -- when we came back to East\nBerlin, it was -- dusk was falling, and you see the neon, and the lights, and the -- and the music,\nit was like night and day, was really amazing dichotomy between the two places.",
        "A: Yes, when I came back to West Berlin in the evening, jus -- as you cross the border, it\u2019s like\nyou're in a different world. It was very interesting. But as far as what I felt was concerned, I have\nno -- I -- you know, I had no fear for anybody who seemed -- they seemed poor, and a lot of\npeople seemed unemployed or whatever, but I didn\u2019t -- I certainly didn\u2019t have any great feeling\nfor them, nor the other way -- and -- and still don\u2019t. And if it costs Germany a fortune to com --\nyou know, to integrate it, I couldn\u2019t care less. They took it on.",
        "A: Oh, something else that just came to mind. I was in Germany in 1949, not in Berlin, but when\nI went back to Europe for the first time with my husband, my first husband, we went to\nFrankfort. He wa-was on business, and first time I ever went back to Europe, and we\u2019re in\nFrankfort, and the city was absolutely decimated. You could see for miles and miles and miles, it\nwas just rubble. And way in the distance you saw the famous Kerner Dome, which 1s a cathedral.\nAnd they did this precision bombing, and I remember seeing all these Germans, this is \u201949 now,\nrolling around on makeshift -- like torsos rolling around, lots of them, on a wooden crate, with\nlike the wheels of a -- of a -- from roller skates, you know, one on each corner, so that they could\n-- you know, their legs blown off, and -- and I remember -- and they wer -- the food was terri --\nno, the food was good, it was bad in England, and in -- in London, and in Paris, you couldn\u2019t, but\nin Germany, through the PX\u2019s, you could get almost anything, and it just bothered me, and I -- it\njust -- seeing these people rolling around, I just couldn\u2019t have cared less, is -- it\u2019s -- you know, I\nhad no sympathy whatsoever on how difficult the war was for them. It was very strange being\nthere, I had forgotten that I was in Germany.",
        "A: To be honest with you, almost the same. I am sure that I will die with that feeling. Don\u2019t\nknow quite why I feel that way, being that I -- you know, didn\u2019t have to go through a\nconcentration camp, but I\u2019m very -- just so grateful, you know, that -- and feel so fortunate that I\n-- like, I missed it by a hair, and I just feel a -- a tremendous -- a tremendous feeling of\nsomething to all the people that died there. I -- I just -- To me, that\u2019s sort of like my religion. I\njust feel compelled to read, you know, almost anything on that, or see every film, or every\ndocumentary. I just feel very drawn to it, and I\u2019m always very annoyed with people -- most of\nthem are Jewish, who say -- and there are many, I -- I can\u2019t deal with that, I -- I can\u2019t watch it, I\ncan\u2019t look at it, I can\u2019t read it, and I always feel like, I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t look at it?\u201d I said, \u201cYou\ndi -- it -- it\u2019s like you -- you ought -- you know, you didn\u2019t have to go through it, why can\u2019t you\nlook at it? I feel like that\u2019s your duty to look at it.\u201d Or, I couldn\u2019t go to a Holocaust Museum, and\nit -- I find that very annoying, and many people say that to me.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m certainly no expert on it. I -- I see -- you know, I read these -- the answer -- you\nknow, that Daniel Goldhagen\u2019s book is such a hit in -- in Germany, and that they like klesma\nmusic, which is sort of weird to me, like it -- I\u2019m sure there are some -- I -- I really don\u2019t know,\nmaybe it is a generational thing, but I -- I think that many Germans -- and I\u2019ve learned that\nthey\u2019re -- heard this from really very well known, and very knowledgeable professors, I take\ncourses in international politics in New York. They -- They don\u2019t really know what to do with\ndemocracy. It\u2019s sort of inbred. I\u2019m not generalizing, but they feel comfortable under -- you\nknow, being told what to do, and as long as it\u2019s orderly, and clean, and neat, and no crime, you\nknow, at least, you know, the ordinary kind of crime, that they feel comfortable with that.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: I was, yeah. \u201989 was that trip, and 19 -- October 1998 was a -- a couple of days in Berlin, a\ntrip of eastern Europe. I was in Budapest, Prague -- Budapest, Prague, where else was I? Vienna.\nVienna and Berlin. And I have that same feeling, by the way, for the Viennese. I mean, Austria\nand Germany, as far as I\u2019m concerned, I lump them together. If anything, I dislike them more,\nbecause they\u2019re so -- you know, so like our southern people or something, you know, with that\nsmaltzy Viennese, but that\u2019s just me. What was your question, how?",
        "A: Oh, the memorials. I th -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t see anybody looking at them, or noticing them. I\u2019ve\nseen some, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re very subtle, you don\u2019t even know what they are. And I\u2019ve seen chil\n-- they\u2019re like in a children\u2019s playground, and kids climb on them, or play around them. They\u2019re\nnot revered. They\u2019re just up here and there, again, only the ones I\u2019ve seen, maybe there are some,\nbut -- but there was one ri-right on the Krufensadum, and very -- right by the main -- the main\nsubway station, right near the Kaufasdesvestens, this famous department store. And it\u2019s -- that\none referred to different -- it just mentioned different concentration camps, like on a -- on a post,\nbut it\u2019s -- it\u2019s well done, and I think that people just go about their business, nobody looks at it.\nAnd that\u2019s a spot sort of like Times Square. What they do look at, and it is interesting, 1s that\nchurch. You must have seen that church, we bombed out that famous cathedral, and they left that\nstanding there in the middle of modern Berlin, which is quite interesting, but that\u2019s just a\nreminder of the war, not -- nothing to do with Germans -- nothing to do with Jews. It\u2019s very\ndramatic.",
        "A: Yes, I did, I did. I -- They are building there like crazy. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. And\nour tour guide, who was excellent, a guy from Munich, told us, among many other things, that 90\npercent of building cranes in Germany were all in Berlin, and this really wasn\u2019t a good time to\nvisit Berlin, 1f you wait a year or so, it\u2019Il be like a whole new city. It was just amazing. All the --\nyou know, the Fortune 500 companies, or whatever, of the world, were building there, and they\nweren\u2019t just building buildings, they were building like whole plazas, and it\u2019s ju -- tremendous,\nun-unbelievable the building going on, which was -- there was nothing going on in -- in 1989.",
        "A: No, none. We were at a very nice hotel, and then we went and did things, you know, on our\nown, really. And of course, a famous muse -- you know, went to a museum, the thing that\ntourists do, including the zoo, which is spectacular, and the -- you went to that museum, I know\nyou did, the Pergamon Museum. And -- And went to -- to try that Berliner food, which -- which\nwas very interesting.",
        "A: I did not go, no, I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t -- no, I did not.",
        "A: Yes, for the first time. I know that -- that -- that other time I was -- yeah I\u2019m -- as I realize it\nnow, I was also in Munich once, forgot about that. But I did not go to -- to Dachau. I was near it,\nbut I didn\u2019t go. That was years ago with -- I don\u2019t know. But this time, in 1998, I did visit\nTheresienstadt, because it was part of the tour. We were on our way from Prague to Vienna, I\nbelieve. It\u2019s that right? Think so. Whatever, and via Dresden, and we -- we went to -- yeah,\nbecause Theresienstadt, I think, was near, or in Czechoslovakia, and it was quite an experience. I\n-- And I knew that that was not the worst ones. I remember hearing that from my aunt, and she\ndid survive, and -- and they had, you know, some kind -- some sort of a life there, but I don\u2019t\nthink I could bear visiting Auschwitz. I don\u2019t ever want to go to Poland.",
        "A: It\u2019s a hard question to answer, but I am sure that it has had a profound affect on me. You\nknow, you think it hasn\u2019t, but it has. It has -- I probably would have be -- been a different person.\nI mean, it\u2019s hard to speculate, but I mean, I\u2019m happy that -- that I came to America, but coming\nas a refugee, I think if I -- if I had been born here, I would be a different person today. Maybe not\neverything for the better, but I think most of if, yes, s -- educa -- and it\u2019s hard -- hard to say.",
        "A: I think on my career decisions, because my parents -- well then, of course, that was my\nparents. Had I been -- Had it -- had not happened, I probably would not have gone on to much\nhigher education. In Berlin, I guess nobody did it, or almost nobody. Here, you have more\nopportunity, and still my par -- it was maybe more my parents doing than -- and their feeling -- I\nthink they always felt like refugees, all their lives, and therefore, you know, passed that on to me,\nto get married, and you know, get -- I -- I don\u2019t know why I had to, you know, get married, so I -\n- I just had turned 19 -- no, just had turned 20. My birthday\u2019s in September, I got married in\nOctober, but I -- in those days, chronologically, you know, I was just 20, but otherwise, I,\nemotionally, I was like 16. And I was, you know, something that really should not have had -- I\nshould have gone, you know, and furthered, you know, gone for more of a career, and so it -- it\ndid affect me. But what did you ask me?",
        "A: I think it -- on my political inclinations, yes, I think most people are pretty democratic, and\nliberal, and I think it has something to do with that, of course, because you can see yourself in\nthat same position, in relation to Blacks, or whatever, minorities. As far as religion is concerned,\nwell, I wasn\u2019t brought up on a religious home. My first husband was very religious. I was not,\nthat was a bad combination. And it sort of, if anything turned me against it, I found it very\ncumbersome, and cumbering and -- and I just have a tremendous feeling about the Holocaust,\nand still more as I get older, as I said earlier. I still do. I -- I -- I have more -- more and more so.\nAnd that, somehow, is like my religion, you know. I -- I don\u2019t really -- \u2019'm not a religious -- I\nlike tradition, a little bit of it, you know, with the family, and we spend the holidays together, but\nit means more to my children than it does to me, to be honest.",
        "A: Oh, I think the museum is fantastic, I really do. I think it\u2019s a fabulous museum, it\u2019s portrayed\nvery, very well, and all the high tech things, and all the little films you can see. I haven\u2019t really\nbegin -- begun to scratch the surface, if I really wanted to see everything, cause I\u2019m never here\nlong enough. If I lived in the area, I probably would have done it, but I -- it\u2019s not the end, I\u2019m\ngoing to continue to do it. And in films, I ge -- I mean, I think much more -- I think s -- it\u2019s --\nmuch more is still being said, and I think as we get more sophisticated, and as the generation 1s\nready to die out, that there are scholars and people still writing from -- and pursuing it from, then\n-- and researching it from different angles, and different points of view. Especially, I\u2019m\ninterested -- I am interested a lot in -- well, like that Daniel Goldhagen book, sort of to prove to\nmyself that -- about the basic German, how could this really happen, that it isn\u2019t just the\nhierarchy and everything that we know, that it could not really have happened without the\ncooperation of the ordinary German. I feel like it\u2019s in their blood, I really do feel that. There are\nexceptions of course, but -- I mean, how -- all the little things that happened day to day, how c --\nhow could anybody take just stones, and smash windows, and take an old man in -- into the\nstreet, you know on an individual basis, when you look at it that way. Nevermind the\nconcentration camps, before the concentration camps, people that you knew, and were your\nneighbors, and you knew them all your life, and all of a sudden you turned your back on -- what\ndoes it take in a person to do that? You know, one to one. I -- I have to wonder about that. What\nkind of people are those? And other countries, you know, you take a country like Denmark, was\nit? And they\u2019re just like good people. They just didn\u2019t, and they wouldn\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s -- I\ndon\u2019t know what that is, when you lump it together as one country. Or the people of -- I -- I --\nbut I -- and I feel that way, yes, to this day, and I feel that about Polish people, Austrian people,\nthe whole Ukraine, all those people that, you know, when you see modern day movies that were\nmade in this -- last year or this year, and you see these old ladies, with the babushkas, and a\ncouple of teeth, it -- 1t -- you could transpose them into a movie of 1938, and if I understood their\nlanguage, they\u2019re still -- they -- they\u2019re born with that anti-Semitism, that\u2019s -- I feel that, I really\ndo. That\u2019s why I never want to go to any of those other countries. I only went to Berlin, because\nafter all, well, it was offered to me, and it was -- there is a fascination, it\u2019s a morbid fascination\nto see the city. And it\u2019s also an interesting city.",
        "A: Yeah, I do. Yes, I do. Yeah, I don\u2019t forgive. I -- I\u2019m not -- I don\u2019t have -- I\u2019m a very -- like a\nvery practical person, and I don\u2019t really have religion to fall back on. I\u2019m -- I -- \u2019'm not forgiving\nin that sense, or can turn to God. I -- I just see it -- what -- what\u2019s the right word, I\u2019m a very\nliteral person. Is that the right word? I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I see it, you know, the way it was, or\nread the way it was, and no, I cannot forgive it.",
        "A: Oh, don\u2019t get me started. We\u2019ll be -- We\u2019ll -- You\u2019ll need another tape. I hated that movie,\nthat shi -- that -- that \u201cLife 1s Beautiful.\u201d \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d was an interesting movie, it\u2019s a story\nabout one person, I mean. But it was well done, I like Steven Spielberg, and what he\u2019s doing,\nThe Shoah Foundation and all that. But I hated that -- that \u201cLife is Beautiful,\u201d and I\u2019ve had\nendless discussions with people about that movie. You had to ask me that at the end. I just -- I --\nIt\u2019s a fable, and I also take a film course, and we discuss it in the film course. An-And people\nloved it, and I -- I just -- and when that -- that guy climbed over those chairs at the Oscars, I ju --\nI just -- I -- I said, \u201cLet it end already.\u201d But there is no end. Do you know that they\u2019re making\nanother movie? Yup. S -- Th -- Oh, no, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re putting 1t with eng -- in the --\nmaking it in English, without titles. I knew I read something. And I just feel that -- like, it\u2019s like a\nsacred thing, that you can\u2019t write a fable about -- a movie about a -- an experience like that. And\nI feel that anybody who went through the experience, that it was like an insult to people, that\nnothing in that movie could have possibly have happened. That they -- he took the little boy with\nhim into -- I felt such an affront, I -- I don\u2019t know why, but I just hated it. And I hate that little\nguy, and his annoying interviews, so don\u2019t ask me any more on that.",
        "A: Of course you can, of course. I\u2019m just being, you know, cause I\u2019ve discussed it a million\ntimes.",
        "A: Yes, and the ones that I know, which are limited, because they were in my class, I take a -- a\nfilm course at the new school in New York, and almost everybody there, for some reason or\nother is -- well, they\u2019re retired people, and most of them are Jewish, and some of them are\nsurvivors. And the survivors felt as I did, but I don\u2019t know if they were as vehement. I -- I just --\nI just found that movie very annoying. I just -- I didn\u2019t like the humor, and I didn\u2019t like any of\nthose things, and I don\u2019t agree with people who say that well, at least then they -- more people\nwould be exposed to it, you know, who wouldn\u2019t see it, because they\u2019re exposed to something\nthat never could have happened, it was so much more horrible. And how can you make a fable\nabout anything, but not --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Well, through the years, I -- I guess the -- we talked, you know, it came up naturally, but they\n-- well, one of my daughters is quite interested in it, my older daughter. She wanted to come with\nme today, you know, but that was not appropriate. But she is interested, she reads books on it.\nShe is interested through her synagogue, she\u2019s very involved at the Washington congregation, I\nforget where Hebrew -- Washington Hebrew, yeah. My other daughter is not all that interested,\nand also I tried, you know, even though it\u2019s German, but it is a language, when they were young,\nI tried to speak German to them. My mother always said it doesn\u2019t hurt to know another\nlanguage, which we all know. But they really fought me on it, and I just gave up after awhile.\nMy grandchildren are sort of interested, but I think they\u2019re interested because it\u2019s a school\nproject, you know. I\u2019m suppose -- because they in turn are learning about the Holocaust, or in\nHebrew school, or they have to do something in history, and sometimes they question me the\nway you\u2019re questioning me now, but not that -- not that closely, especially my youngest one,\nMichael. But how did -- did I speak to them about it? I -- I guess it was maybe -- they would --\nthey did become interested, but I think they spoke more to my parents, probably, than to me. And\nthey became interested when they were adults, but then they didn\u2019t really say much. My father\ndidn\u2019t want to talk about it, and -- how he came here, and this and that. I -- I -- We lived in -- in\nForest Hills, and I\u2019m trying to think back, I -- I don\u2019t know how much it really came up, except\nthat the friends that I had, as I said earlier, they were from Germany as well, or German\nspeaking, at any rate, and they would grow up hearing mixed things, but they knew a little, but\nnothing much has really remained, they are really just very American, Americanized.",
        "A: Boy, I have to really think about these things. I -- No, not so much, just about this, as they call\nit Ausvanderon, you know that leaving, that process of leaving. And the immediate, the relatives\nand what happened to them, and where they are, but then, after years, you know, when the war\nwas over, and we knew that there wasn\u2019t going to be any -- you know, weren\u2019t going to hear\nfrom anyone, except their -- her sister, Kate, and the other one, who lives in Israel, we -- we\ndidn\u2019t talk about it very much any more. I -- I don\u2019t know how. I guess I sort of just accepted it\nor something. My father -- I don\u2019t remember my father talking much about his brother, you\nknow, as the years went by. He was a very self-involved man, not really a family man.",
        "A: Myself, I was happy, we were proud, you know, when watched those proceedings at the UN,\nand -- but as a -- as an American Jew, no I don\u2019t have a very strong connection to Israel. I -- I\nnever felt that I wanted to move there, or live there. As a matter of fact, when I was there the first\ntime, which is -- was in 1963, after a very wonderful trip to Europe. Europe was very luxurious\nin 1963, and then hitting Israel, it was big disappointment. I was not very happy there. No, I --\nit\u2019s -- I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t have a -- I\u2019m happy that it exists, but I don\u2019t, personally no, I don\u2019t have --\nand I have relatives there, and I care about them, and we are in constant touch through the years,\nletters and sometimes phone calls. And they just were very hospitable this last month to my\ngrandson David, who lives in Bethesda. He was in Israel, as was my la -- grandson Lawrence. He\nwent two years ago, and they were lovely to them. And they stayed with them when they had\ntime to visit people on their team tour, each one. And they were saying that I should come, we\ntalked on the phone a couple of weeks ago, that I should come, they have a new house, I should\nstay with them. And I\u2019m considering it, maybe, to go back to Israel. But otherwise -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nreally because of them, and to see Isra -- and then my other experience was in 1993. I\u2019d had the\nbad luck to go on a poor tour -- poorly organized tour, it really wasn\u2019t a tour at all, and I -- if it\nweren\u2019t for my cousins there, it would have been a pretty disastrous trip, cause I was really on\nmy own. It was sold as a tour, but it was -- when you got there, it was really like a day tour. I\ncould have booked that myself, to see, always with different people, and different places, you\nknow, and put -- it was like a day tour in Tel Aviv, or Jerusalem. And at the end of the day you\nwere plunked down at your hotel, and you had nobody. But as I said, I had my family there and\nthey really saved the trip for me. So I don\u2019t have such a gra -- it wasn\u2019t -- I -- I -- I think I\u2019d want\nto try Israel again, and I might consider going there in the near future.",
        "A: No, I -- It was a very enjoyable experience to c -- trip down memory lane, which is kind of\nbig hyphens there, spaces missing, but it was very interesting, and I\u2019m glad to have done it, and\nif it\u2019s -- if it is of any value to future researchers, or whatever you do with it, then I\u2019m very glad\nto have done my small share. Thank you very much.\n"
