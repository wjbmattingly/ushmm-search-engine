        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Renate Chernoff, conducted by Gail Schwartz on June 23\", 2005 in\nPotomac, Maryland. This is tape number one, side A. Could you give me your full\nname please?",
        "Answer: My name is Renate Rosemarie Fischer Chernoff.",
        "Q: And where were your born and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born on June 25\", 1929, in Breslau, Germany. Germ -- Breslau is now\nPolish, but it was German at that point 1n time.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family background. How far back did your family\ngo in Breslau?",
        "A: My family actually went very far back, I would say. I have records to -- 0-of\ngraves having been erected in -- just right after the Napoleonic war, the Franco-\nPrussian War. And of all strange things, one of the graves that may have survived\nall the fighting in that area 1s still standing today. I managed to get a picture of it just\nvery recently on the web. And we were very excited to see that gravestone.",
        "Q: What -- what was your father\u2019s name?",
        "A: My father was Walter James Fischer. He was a psychiatrist. He went to school\nin his native town of Breslau where most of my forebears were born. He was -- is\nJune 23, 2005\nthe professional person in his family. His parents were merchants, they had a\nwonderful -- probably the largest toyshop in all of Silesia, and he chose not to go\ninto that kind of work, perhaps because he was in the army in -- in the first World\nWar, and fought in France, fought in Verdun, came back and -- and at that point he\nwas only 16 or 18 years old. And came back totally paralyzed by what he had seen;\nhe was a litter bearer in the field, and decided that medicine would be his calling. S -\n- my grandmother and grandfather had the shop, both of them worked. My\ngrandmother worked alongside her husband and so did her sister and his brother.\nThey were two brothers married to two sisters, and so it was definitely a family\naffair. And their parents, my great-grandparents were also in Breslau. What they did\nI\u2019m really not sure, but in -- in business of some sort. The business, interestingly\nenough -- the house where the business was housed 1s standing today in the very\nsame place, it was one of the few buildings that survived the second World War. It\nwas on the rink, the main square of the city of Breslau, right opposite the court\nbuildings. It\u2019s number 26 on -- number 36, excuse me, on the rink. And I have seen\nreproductions of that area, or photographs of that area and sure enough, it\u2019s still\nthere. The Poles have really taken a great deal of trouble to try to rebuild that area as\nit was, and I think s -- handled it very successfully. My forbearers on my mother\u2019s\nside were from Birnbaum, which is really on the Polish side. What -- my\nJune 23, 2005\ngrandfather on my mother\u2019s side was in the canning business, and was the first\ncanner who did diabetic fruits in Germany, canned diabetic fruits. And had the\nfactory just outside of Breslau and so my mother grew up really in the country, in\nthis -- 1t\u2019s suburban now, but it was really country when she grew up, and that she\nloved. And she did go to school in Breslau, but the rest of the time she was a\ncountry girl.",
        "Q: And was she a housewife?",
        "A: Actually, she was, although she went to high school and upon graduating from\nhigh school went to a sort of a finishing school for girls and studied music. She had a\nmagnificent voice, and was very nicely trained, and sang eventually professionally,\nin part, but always sang for the high holidays at synagogue. And in fact, I came\nacross a letter just the other day, the head of the synagogue in Ratibor, which was\none of the places where we lived, thanked her for making the service so beautiful.",
        "Q: In talking about the synagogue, can you tell a little bit about how religious your\nfamily was?",
        "A: My grandparents on both sides were fairly religious. My father was pretty much\nof a free thinker. My mother was more religious than he, but I think both of them\nbecame very, very much more religious when we crossed over to this side of the\nocean.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you, as a small child, remember celebrating any holidays?",
        "A: Oh yes, we always celebrated holidays and I particularly remember Sukkot in the\nsynagogue in Ratibor, which is the little town that I really remember best of all. It\nwas in the -- in Upper Silesia, which was a number of hours by train from Breslau\ngoing towards the Czech border and the Polish border, we were sort of in a -- very\nclose, within walking distance of the Polish border, because I remember walking\nwith my mother to have buttermilk on the Polish side of the border because the\nfarmer -- that farmer\u2019s buttermilk was by all means the very best, and so we walked\nacross wheat fields and over the border to get our buttermilk. Very nice memory.",
        "Q: So did you celebrate Shabbat, did you go to synagogue?",
        "A: We celebrated Shabbat, my mother kindled candles. We celebrated Passover, but\nmostly we celebrated our Passovers, and I have very vivid memories with very dear\nfriends who were Orthodox, I believe. And we s -- I went to services on Saturday\nmornings, not with my parents, but with a friend of theirs who took me not only to\nsynagogue on Saturday mornings, but took me out for a krimmelhelmchen which\nwas a poppy seed roll o-on our way home. And that made a great impression on me.\nBut my grandpar -- my grandmother -- I think all of them were really liberal Jews\nrather than Orthodox Jews. I think tha-that it was not named Conservative, I think\nJune 23, 2005\nthat branch of Jewry in Germany was called the liberal branch and we went to\nsynagogue there rather than the Orthodox synagogue.",
        "Q: Were your parents very politically active?",
        "A: They had very strong opinions. Active, I wouldn\u2019t say, no. Ma -- I think my\nfather\u2019s days were so full with his -- with his work, and with work for the courts. He\nwas very often asked to be the s -- the psychiatrist who gave opinions in court cases.\nAnd they were very active at their lodge, the B\u2019nai Brith lodge. That I do\nremember.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s just get a sense of a structure here with how long you lived where. Y-You\nsaid you were born in Breslau, and how long did you live there?",
        "A: All right. We were born -- I was born in Breslau. When my father w -- a-already\nwas working in a suburban area -- area called Obernigk. O-b-e-r-n-i-g-k, | think. It\nwas a suburb of Breslau and had a large psychiatric hospital in it. And there he had\nhis job and there we lived. Now, I was very little and really have no memories other\nthan picture memories of that place. It was the same town that my grandparents had\nthe canning factory in, so this all worked out very nicely in that respect. We moved,\nI believe it was 1934 to Ratibor, R-a-t-i-b-o-r, it 1s now also in Polish hands and\nhas changed its name just a little. And I think when we moved we -- I was 1 -- going\ninto nursery kindergarten, and I went to the school of the Ursuline sisters and I\nJune 23, 2005\nloved my time there. They were so good to us, and they -- I learned so many little\nskills, and I even still have the little needle book that I embroidered for my mother,\nmy first timid effort at working with fibers, and it was very precious to my mother,\nand a little moth-eaten but I still have it. And we moved into our first house and we\nrented an apartment on Svingerstrasser 17 and within a month or two we were\nasked to leave because we were unwanted. The owner of the house didn\u2019t realize\nthat somebody with the name of Fischer could be Jewish. And so we moved and\nfound a very nice apartment on number 23 Svingerstrasser, and I have very vivid\nmemories of it, I could draw the plan of the apartment. It was a first floor walk-up,\nvery large apartment and my father was able to have his practice right in our\napartment. The first room was very large, with -- I can\u2019t think of the English word\nfor the moment. It\u2019s a-a-an [indecipherable] a a no -- a no -- a knockout, a glass\nknockout so that one could really watch the street up and down and see what\u2019s going\non and it was an up -- first floor, upstairs, and large. And then the room next to us\nwas the waiting room. And during the day it was the waiting room for the patients\nand in the evening it was the gentlemen\u2019s room to have cigarettes. And as we walked\ndown the corridor, there was a kitchen to the left in which Maria, our very dear\ndomestic help who lived with us, did her thing. And then further down, of course,\nwas the dining room and the living room and my bedroom and my parent\u2019s room.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: So you were an only child?",
        "A: I -- yes, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My mother always said Mr. Hitler saw to it that I was an only child. They would\n-- they were ready to have a rather lar -- and had hoped for a rather large family.\nHowever, I did acquire a brother a little later on, but that\u2019s another story.",
        "Q: Were either of your parents artistic?",
        "A: My mother sang very beautifully and my father always thought that he might\nhave, if he had not become a physician he might have become an architect. So I\nthink yes, I would say so. They both had extremely fine taste in things that they\nchose to buy, and yeah, I would s -- and my mother\u2019s singing, of course, was quite --\nquite remarkable.",
        "Q: What languages did you speak at home?",
        "A: German only. My mother knew some French and my father studied Greek and\nLatin in school, and -- but of course it was the reading language of Greek and Latin,\nI don\u2019t know that he spoke it, other than memorized poetry.",
        "Q: Was it a mixed neighborhood -- we\u2019re now talking about Ratibor because you\nsaid you didn\u2019t really remember before that, is that correct?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yeah.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: Yeah, so can you -- was it a mixed neighborhood of Jews and non-Jews?",
        "A: Yes, it was definitely a mixed -- a mixed neighborhood. I don\u2019t think that\nRatibor had a specifically Jewish area, I think we were all very well here and there.\nI-I cannot think of -- of a Jewish neighborhood, per se. The neighborhood where we\nlived was -- was a nicely treed neighborhood. It was a main street, and yet it had\ntrees on it and in the back of our house was a -- every apartment had its own little\ngarden, and so we raised strawberries. It was a small garden, but we raised\nstrawberries and flowers and there was a little house on the garden, in the back of\nthe garden, big enough to have a table and maybe six or eight chairs and I know my\nmother\u2019s book club met there in the summertime. And of course, I loved playing in\nthe garden. And I had a nanny who made sure that I learned how to grow things and\nto weed, and to take care of flowers and who was really my steady companion after I\ncame home from school each day.",
        "Q: So did you play with any of the other chil-children in the neighborhood or just\nwith your nanny after school?",
        "A: You know, it was easy, it was -- well, not -- perhaps not the children in my\nneighborhood because across from our house were the courts, the courts of that part\nof the province. So there were not that many houses that had children in them.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about judicial courts, not --\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Judicial courts.",
        "Q: -- not courtyards.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, judicial courts. But one usually made appointments with one\u2019s\nfriends and after school they could come to my house and it was always -- I always\nhad a lot of little friends who came over and whose company I enjoyed and whose\nhomes I went to as well. Not for very long, but for awhile.",
        "Q: Right. Were these Jewish and non-Jewish children?",
        "A: We had -- I had very close Jewish and non-Jewish friends, and I was very\nfortunate enough to have the non-Jewish friends because some of them were really\nlovely children with whom I enjoyed being together. And we were together really,\nuntil the time when it was no longer allowed that these little girls, particularly, could\ncome and visit me. My very dearest friend was a young girl by the name of Ushi\nBlaut, whose father was an architect for the city, and who was threatened to lose his\njob if his little girl came and played with me. And I think maybe that was the first\nawakening that things were very strange.",
        "Q: That was your first awakening.",
        "A: My first awakening.",
        "Q: And -- and what was -- do you remember -- granted, you were very young, but do\nyou remember any thoughts you had at that time, or what that meant to you?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: It meant a great deal to me because we saw very much eye to eye and we loved\nbeing naughty together. I couldn\u2019t understand why. I couldn\u2019t -- I could see her at\nschool, but yet she couldn\u2019t come to my house after school, and I couldn\u2019t visit her\nany more. And that -- that started -- I mean, that kind of began and then it was like\nsomething rolling on and on and on and it -- and it was -- I tell you, the one thing\nthat I do remember is by going through some old photographs, I did find out that she\nwas allowed to come to my birthday party and I think that must have meant a lot to\nme, and it was very special, but on a day to day basis, she couldn\u2019t visit.",
        "Q: Do you remember which birthday party it was?",
        "A: I think it was my fifth -- fifth and sixth birthday parties. Now, I -- as I say, I could\nnot visit her, she could not visit me, but birthday parties seemed to be kosher.",
        "Q: So this would be 1934 - 35?",
        "A: Mm-hm, yes.",
        "Q: Hitler came into power in 1933.",
        "A: \u00b033.",
        "Q: What was your very first memory of him?",
        "A: I think one of the most frightening things were the parades through our streets.\nAnd I mentioned the bay window earlier on, which gave wonderful visibility to\neverything that was going up and down the street. And the night that the brownshirts\nJune 23, 2005\nwere having their parades, I remember my nanny holding me in her arms and we\nwere watching it. It was nighttime, it was with candles lit and loud singing and --\nand boisterous goings on on the street. And I wish I could tell you what year that\nwas, that I don\u2019t remember. But I remember the fact -- oh, I remember the fact, I\nremember the shirts, I remember the glistening on the black boots. And we were one\nstory up. But it seemed like endless numbers of people were marching and marching\nand marching. And yet, that part of Germany, I think was not as badly off as other\nparts of Germany. Somehow we were late, I think, in receiving the blows, so to\nspeak. I think things were worse in other places, but I do recall this vividly and even\ntoday when I talk about it, I get a little chilly.",
        "Q: What did your nanny say to you? Do you remember if she tried to comfort you or\nsaid anything special?",
        "A: I think she held me. She hugged me. She herself was so appalled at what was\ngoing on, I think, and understandable for her. And for Maria, our -- our help in that\n-- our live-in help in the house. Maria was a very simple Polish woman, who did all\nthe housework for us, and was -- and lived with us, and when she would go to\nchurch and come home, she would always tell us what the father\u2019s sermon was, each\nweek. She would share that with us. She was totally against the regime, although her\nbrother was a member of the Nazi party, and I remember having him come and visit\nJune 23, 2005\nand he sat out in the kitchen with her while she was preparing coffee or something.\nAnd he proudly showed off the lap -- other side of his lapel, with a swastika attached\nto it. When he came into the house he had the good sense of putting it on the reverse\nside. Most of the time I think he had it on the real side, he was a Nazi of the first\norder. But not his sister. Maria was a gentle, wonderful soul, with whom we kept in\ntouch through the war -- not during the war, but after the war. She wrote to my\nparents and she wrote as long as they allowed mail to go through and I have le -- her\nletters t-to this day. And she actually, after my grandmother was deported, she\nactually walked out of the house and walked til she came across to the Czech side of\nthe border. She couldn\u2019t stand being in Germany. And she say -- she went into the\nservice of a priest in Czechoslovakia and survived the war.",
        "Q: What does it mean to a little girl to see a swastika?",
        "A: Then, or now?",
        "Q: Then.",
        "A: I think frightening. Terrifying to -- to say the least. I of course didn\u2019t understand\nthe ins and outs behind it all, but there was something frightening about the image.",
        "Q: Did your parents ever explain anything on their own, or did you go up and ask\nthem? Granted, you were very young.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that I was old enough to ask the right questions. They, of course,\ntried to shield me. Things got very difficult in Ratibor. My father, who was in\nprivate practice, when the decree came out that only Jewish patients could go to\nJewish doctors, his patients, of course had to hold off coming. Although strangely\nenough in the middle of the night, very often the back door knocked, it was a patient\nwho didn\u2019t want to be seen entering the doctor\u2019s house, would come. And of course,\nmy father saw him. And patients asked him to come and see them. And he did not\nhave a car, and in the early days he went to see his patients by bicycle. But later on,\nhe got a motorcycle, yeah, a big do -- it was my father and his pale green motorcycle\nand his one piece suit, which covered him all the way from over his head, to his\nshoes, with a zip in front. Went to see his patients in Poland, and he would take his\nmotorcycle and go over. And there was the standing joke, he stopped at the -- at the\ncustoms bureau -- at the customs office to get his papers signed that he was going\nacross the border and about an hour later he would come back and the border guard\nsniffed -- he would sniff, oh Dr. Fischer, you have just seen a patient? Yes, and the\npayment was two wonderful Polish sausages that were hanging on the inside of his\nsuit. They knew it, they looked the other way. It was just -- 1t was an -- an accepted\nnorm. And so people did come and he did still help people who needed help, 1-1f\nthey could just get to his hou -- to our house and not be seen. But one morning -- and\nJune 23, 2005\nI don\u2019t remember what year it was, there was a big yellow sign plastered all over the\nentryway. And Maria went outside as always to pick up the milk and the fresh rolls\nthat were left at the doorstep and she removed the sign. And the sign said, De Jude\nlugt. The Jew lies. And she tore it off very quickly and tore it up.",
        "Q: How did you know about this?",
        "A: My father told me. Yeah. And I think maybe that was sort of the beginning of\nwhen he thought probably it would be better to move to a larger city, and so -- and\nmany people did move from the smaller towns, hoping to find their place and a\nbetter way of life in the larger city. So in 1936, I think it was 1936, he decided to go\nto Breslau. And so there was movement afoot to move the family, mother and me,\nup to Breslau. But the move was going to be a difficult one, he already saw the\nhandwriting on the wall. And so I was sent to Berlin to stay with my other granny,\nmy mother\u2019s mother, who lived in [indecipherable] in Berlin, and also, I was not\nallowed to go to school any more. Jewish children were not allo -- were not accepted\nat school any more, so it -- there was a duel reason for moving. I had to go to Jewish\nschool. And there was no Jewish school. There were too few people in Ratibor for a\nJewish school to be there, so I was sent to live with my grandmother in Berlin and to\ncontinue my education at a Jewish school, which I did, while my parent\n[indecipherable] while my parents were moving.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: Do you remember what some of your thoughts were and your feelings were when\nyou had to leave to go to Berlin?",
        "A: I disliked it with a vengeance. I did not want to go to Berlin and I have letters\nthat I wrote home, I have them in my keep. Please take me home, I don\u2019t want to\nstay here, I don\u2019t like Berlin. It was all very strange to me, and living with my\ngrandmother was sort of an unknown, I didn\u2019t know her really that well. And she\nwas a darling, kind, wonderful person, but it wasn\u2019t my mother and it wasn\u2019t my\nfather and I didn\u2019t know my surroundings. Not a soul did I know other than her, and\nI was deeply, deeply unhappy in Berlin and I had to stay there through maybe one or\ntwo semesters. And by that time, Mother and Father had moved to Breslau, but this\nwas a sort of an interesting thing, they were not allowed to live with my\ngrandmother. My grandmother had an enormous house, really. Beautiful house with\nspectacular gardens, a flower garden and a vegetable garden and a fruit garden and a\n-- it was really -- it was a semi-attached -- semi-detached? Semi-attached. Well, they\nwere two houses together, but they were both enormous, and wi-with lots of help.\nThere was a gardener, and there was a lady who came in and did the laundry and\nthere were two people who just cleaned and cooked and washed and did things in the\nhouse. And she had some borders because she was at this point by herself, my -- her\nhusband had passed away. Her husband, my Omi Hadel Fischer\u2019s husband passed\nJune 23, 2005\naway of natural causes in 1936, I think it was and so there was plenty of room for us\nto have a very comfortable existence in the main house, but the Nazi wouldn\u2019t have\nthat. We weren\u2019t allowed to live in the same house unless it was in servant\u2019s\nquarters. And so we did, we lived in the servant\u2019s quarters of the house. We were\nvery, you know, it -- it was just another form of breaking the spirit. But we made the\nbest of it, my folks did really very, very well in -- in adjusting to the new life. My\nfather opened an office in Breslau and immediately had a fairly sizable practice --\npractice. And things were moving along. Not well, but they were moving along.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Renate Chernoff. This is tape number one, side B. Before\nwe go into talking more about Berlin, let\u2019s finish up with some of your memories of\nRatibor. Can you tell me a little bit about your friends there?",
        "A: I was very fortunate to have friends both Jewish and non-Jewish and we did a lot\nof visiting back and forth to each other\u2019s homes, although always with an\nappointment, it wasn\u2019t a natural going back and forth the way we have, or at least\nour children had it when they were growing up. It was an appointment made and the\nnanny was on hand and it was supervised play. For example, every Sunday my\nJune 23, 2005\nfriend Maya Furlish and I had a date, it was every Sunday, it was at the home\nwhere the nanny wasn\u2019t on duty for the weekend. And we always had the same\nmeal, it was always hot dogs with potato salad, and either vanilla pudding with\nchocolate sauce, or chocolate pudding with vanilla sauce. That was the given menu\nand we had wonderful times together. Maya had an older brother. Maya and her\nfamily moved to Israel early on. Her father was a veterinarian and he went to Israel\nand was in charge of the chicken farms all over the country. And they were very\nhappy to have him there. Her brother joined the army and stayed 1-in the permanent\narmy of the Israel force. Changed his name from Evian Furlish to Ari Rohn. Maya\ns -- kept her name, she married some a -- a -- an attorney by the name of Kolhana,\nwho unfortunately passed away, and then she remarried a man from her own\nsettlement, which was [indecipherable] and they both live in Haifa with all their\nchildren and grandchildren and I still am in touch with Maya, we write often, more\nso now that we have email. And we have visited back and forth a number of times,\nshe coming here and we fortunate enough to be able to travel to Israel. At the birth -",
        "Q: Wh-When did they leave to go to Israel?",
        "A: They left in 1937, and it was a -- a good time because they were able to take\nthings with them and they were 1-immediately very well accepted, built a home and\nJune 23, 2005\nhave lived there very well since. And my parents also went to visit them and the old\nties are very strong in our chil -- in -- in ourselves. Our children don\u2019t know each\nother too well, although two of my three kids have visited in Israel and stayed with\nher, so in a way it goes on. The -- there were many other young people who -- with\nwhom I grew up. Many -- several of them went to Israel, one was Epstein, Rutal\nEpstein who went to Israel and has made a good life for herself, 1-is still living\nthere now, I have not kept up with -- with her, but hear about her, occasionally. Vera\nMarcus came to the United States with her family and lived in New York. Laura\nMamlock, daughter of the ear, nose and throat Dr. Mamlock also came to the\nUnited States and my parents were in touch with the Mamlocks for many -- for\nmany years.",
        "Q: Wh-When you say these people left, do you remember specifically when -- all\nthis time --",
        "A: I think that they left in 1937 -- \u201938. \u201937 or \u201938, and they were very fortunate,\nthose two families, of being able to get into the United States. I don\u2019t think anybody\nelse was. No one of my -- that -- whom I know, I don\u2019t think anyone made it into\nCanada. Canada had a very tight immigration policy and only allowed physicians\nand farmers in and once they got here, they gave them a pretty hard time. The\nfarmers were settled immediately, the doctors were kept from working, so -- but\nJune 23, 2005\nmay-maybe more of this later. Other friends were the Baums, Dr. Baum went to\nIsrael, he was a pediatrician and his children and grandchildren are in Israel now.\nHis son, unfortunately lost an arm in the 1948 war. And the whereabouts of several\nother people, I really don\u2019t know. I know that my dear friend Ilse Meyer -- Mayer --\nMeyer didn\u2019t make it, nor did Yurachem -- forgotten his name at the moment, his\nfirst name was Yurachem, but he di -- he also -- Yurachem Vaber did not make it.\nAnd I have seen the fact that they did not make it in the files of the -- of the Yad\nVashem database. And many of the teachers that I had also, unfortunately were\nunable to -- to escape. But Ratibor was a nice little city to grow up 1n, it was a\ncharming town, winter was wonderful, we had snow and skating. We had a pond in\nthe middle of the town and it froze in the winter, and the entire li-little town was\nthere skating. In the summer my father took a boat and rode us all around in the\nboat. It was -- 1t was a good time, it was a nice time for -- for only a short period of\ntime though, unfortunately.",
        "Q: What was the first day of school like?",
        "A: Oh, first day of school was very exciting because every child who started school\nwas given a cornucopia filled with candy. It\u2019s called the Osted Tuete. It -- the\nEaster cornucopia because school started in spring. And I remember my friend\nMaya be -- who is a year older than I am, bringing me my cornucopia, I was still in\nJune 23, 2005\nbed and she brought it to me and it was such an exciting occasion. In fact, I have\nsome pictures to verify the fact that it was really an occasion to be remembered. And\nof course, we went to school. School was an extremely formal affair. We did not\nwear uniforms, but we were very regimented. We had 42 children in a class of --\nwith one teacher. And school was from eight in the morning until one o\u2019clock and\nthen we were through. We all brought our little lunch in lunchboxes that were hung\naround our necks, sort of second breakfasts, my mother called them. And then we\nhad -- when we got home after one o\u2019clock it was dinner, dinnertime. And the\ncurriculum when we started included of course, the usual reading, writing and\narithmetic. But it also included art and music and gym, and religious studies. And to\nthat end Halpy Befelt was my religious teacher, and I st-still have the Bible books\nthat I used, written in German, of course. And once or twice a week he came, not to\nthe school itself, but to a building close to the school, and we all walked over and\ntook our studies while the catechism was being taught to the Catholic children in the\nsi -- in the class. I think boys and girls were separate in school, I\u2019m pri -- I\u2019m sure\nthey were, but to religious school we all went together.",
        "Q: Did you experience ana -- any anti-Semitism from any of the other children at the\nschool, or any of the non-Jewish teachers?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Yes. I think one of the eye opening experiences to me was when an in -- an\ninkwell was thrown at me. And I think I was terrified. It was by one of the other\nchildren. That frightened me. The other thing that really upset me was the fact that\nwe had row monitors who were supposed to take care of people not speaking or\nmisbehaving, and if they did talk to anybody or in any way misbehave, the name\nwas given to the teacher. And I remember getting more sh -- of my shares of -- of --\nof censure to talking or misbehaving than I really should have gotten. And of course\nthe result was that there was a stick that was used and was really -- we rece -- I\nreceived a whipping on both my hands every time I was unget zeigt, which meant,\npointed out. And that I think kind of really ma -- discouraged me. And somehow the\nteachers, I don\u2019t know, they turned their backs on these things. For what reason, I\ndon\u2019t know. For example, when we walked down the street, we -- and we had to wa\n-- we saw a teacher, the -- the way to acknowledge it was to raise one\u2019s hand and to\nsay, heil Hitler. I couldn\u2019t do it and my parents absolutely forbade me to do it, and\nso I just curtsied. And the teacher, instead of acknowledging the curtsy, would look\nthe other way. But of course, she didn\u2019t do anything to -- to upset me, but it was that\n-- but in itself was upsetting to be looked over and not acknowledged. And so it was\nwith most of the teachers. I think that they were being threatened and -- and we were\nbeing threatened in a way, too. That was a hard time.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: Were there pictures of Hitler in the classroom?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember, but picture or not, he was there in --\nyou know, in -- just in so many little, small details. For example, there was every\nweek or so, the pot was po -- passed around for money for Wintahilfe. Winter help\nfor meals for -- for indigent people or money being raised for unusual causes, and\nyou realized, of course, that the causes were the party, but you had to give. So that\nwas another somewhat humiliating experience. But the fact that the teacher believed\nthe children who -- whose hate was really being taught at home, and who took it out\non -- on us, that was -- that was unpardonable.",
        "Q: Wa-Was this something you talked about with the other -- your other Jewish\nfriends? Did you ever talk about such things?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t remember that. I remember talking to my parents about it, but\nI don\u2019t remember talking to other children about it.",
        "Q: And what would your parents say?",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I real -- I just don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember. All I know is I have\nsome pictures in my picture album in which I\u2019ve got hanky in hand, and I remember\nthe incidents, telling my mother and she was deeply, deeply unhappy. And you\nknow, I think what I\u2019ve learned, and I\u2019ve -- it\u2019s been with me all my life is, I don\u2019t\nJune 23, 2005\nwant to make my parents unhappy. And so rather than make them unhappy, I\nwouldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Would you describe yourself as a very independent child?",
        "A: Yes, I think so. I think so. I was fairly independent. I wasn\u2019t a very good student,\nI was a very average student. And according to my report cards, all of which I have\nfrom Germany, I was not very artistic either. Music was better than art, I think.",
        "Q: We-Were you athletic?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t think so, but I did exercise well. I mean, I -- I was not athletic, but I\nwas flexible and -- and I enjoyed games. But athletic per se, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t\nthink I was ever very athletic, although I did play basketball on my high school\nteam, and in college. But that was only because I\u2019m very tall for a woman.",
        "Q: Did you as -- during that young childhood have any hobbies, or things that you\nliked to do, like reading? Anything outside of school?",
        "A: I loved to draw, and I liked to do handwork and my grandmother taught me how\nto crochet. And -- and I liked -- y-yes, I -- I -- I did like that very much. I liked to\nsing and my mother and I sang a lot together. And to this day I -- I recall with much\npleasure the children\u2019s folk songs that we -- we sang together.",
        "Q: Can you sing a little bit of any one of the songs?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: I probably can, let me think of one. [sings in German]. I should bring my book\nup from downstairs where I have all of the songs. Just off the top of my head? Let\nme think a little bit.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Pll go into song later.",
        "Q: Okay. And so you said you had the Jewish instruction once a week and so forth,\nyeah, yeah. Well, se -- speaking about singing and music --",
        "A: The Jewish instruction did not at this point in time, include Hebrew. It was\nBiblical stories mostly and the Hebrew came later, unfortunately. I wish it had come\nat -- at much earlier age because I was at a tremendous disadvantage when I changed\nschools, not having had early Hebrew training.",
        "Q: When you changed schools to Berlin, is that what you mean?",
        "A: Yes, when I changed schools to Berlin and particularly to Breslau, everyone was\nable to read Hebrew quite fluently, and I was struggling terribly with it. And I really\nthink to this day, I really struggle with Hebrew. I have learned French easily, of\ncourse the German and the English no problem, but with Hebrew, to this day I\nstruggle. And I wonder how much this 1s a little resistance on my part. Not willing,\nmind you, but sort of subconscious.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Is -- yo-you had started to sing a song and I was saying something about\nmusic, and did you have any experience with the Jewish orchestra, the Kulturbund?",
        "A: Of course I didn\u2019t, I was too young, but in -- in Ratibor, for a -- a -- quite a while\nwe were allowed to go to theater -- to the theater and to the movies, and to musical\nevents. But the last one that -- the last cinema that I saw was in 1936 at the time of\nthe Olympics. And after that we were not allowed to go to the movie theater any\nmore. And I think it was after that ti -- point in time that the Kubu -- the\nKulturbund came and did its outreach program to the smaller cities and towns and\nbrought wonderful people to sing and to play and so on. One was, for example,\nAlexander Kipnis, who came. And I remember my father, who was very active in\nthese circles, getting all dressed up, I think it was tails. And my mother in her very\nfinest. And it was an evening of Alexander Kipnis. I remember this very well. And\nthere must have been other occasions when the Kubu came down, but this -- this 1s\nthe one that stands out in my mind. Also my father, who was a cigar smoker and a\npipe smoker -- apparently before the performance there was a dinner and I think he\npulled out his cigar and Alexander Kipnis made some very unpleasant remarks\nabout people who smoke. It sticks out in my mind.",
        "Q: Where did this concert take place?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: The concert was actually in the social hall of the synagogue and the synagogue\nmust have been an old church that was taken over by the Jewish community. I\nremember it very lovingly, my father sat downstairs. My mother, who sang in the\nchoir sat upstairs and I was allowed to sit with my mother. Mother was not only a\nmember of the choir, but did the solo work for Yizker service and sang just very,\nvery beautifully. On the side of the synagogue was a little courtyard and nice things\nwent on including, in my memory, wonderful Sukkoth that was built each year with\ntables laden with fruits and vegetables and goodies to eat. And lovely decorations\nfrom a roof that was made of greens, and it was just such a delightful time for the\nchildren. We also had -- I guess it was like a club, but I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t be a hundred\npercent sure, but I know that I -- one Sunday I guess it was, we made lead\ncandlesticks for ourselves. Very tiny lead candlesticks, we were allowed -- they had\nsome forms and I guess they poured the lead and each child went home with two\ncandlesticks. They were big enough to take maybe a birthday candle, but it was so\nspecial and I still have them, and my granddaughter now has them. So they\u2019ve come\na long way and they were very dear. But a lot went on in the synagogue because of\nthe social hall. In fact, plays were given and there were readings and lectures came.\nAnd all this happened 1n the social hall of the synagogue, which was pretty much in\nthe downtown area of Ratibor, and Ratibor was a pretty little town, not far from the\nJune 23, 2005\nsynagogue for example, was the marketplace. And I know that my mother went\nmarketing many times during the week because of course we didn\u2019t have a\nrefrigerator, we only had an icebox. And so she went marketing. But besides getting\nfish and vegetables and things like that, they also had pottery, and it was called\n[speaks German]. And they were wonderful pottery shapes and today, when you go\ninto Pier One, sometimes you can see pottery made in Poland. It\u2019s blue and white\nusually, and a very nice, repetitive, simple design, a repeat design on the pottery.\nAnd very charming, very attractive. It hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot since then. I kind\nof -- I think it\u2019s very lovely and I recall going to potter\u2019s market with -- with my\nmother.",
        "Q: What was the name of the synagogue and do you know the -- where it was\nlocated?",
        "A: I do not know the name. I could draw it on a map, where it was located. I don\u2019t\nknow the name of the street, but I do know it was on the corner of the place where\nthe Marcus Furniture store was and the st-story about the Marcus\u2019s -- and that was\nmy friend Vera Marcus\u2019s family, story I remember very best was a party at their\nhouse. A most unusual party. It was a party that celebrated the safe arrival of an\nelectric refrigerator from the United States of America that had a light in it. I\nremember the children going to the refrigerator, trying the doors, trying to sneak in\nJune 23, 2005\nto see who it was who was opening and closing the lights. And so much joy and so\nmuch merriment. It was just a -- an unforgettable evening. And --",
        "Q: What -- what did you know about the United States as a young child? Did you\nhave any idea of what it represented to you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether it was at this point in time or whether it was a little bit later\nbecause at this point I was what, seven or eight years old, but my greatest fear of\nperhaps coming to the United States or Canada was I was so afraid of the wolves.\nFour legged ones. I was petrified to think that I was going to have to live in log\ncabin with ice and snow all around and the wolves in the neighborhood. It was kind\nof frightening, but I think the nicest, nicest story that my father told me, and I'll\nremember to this day is, dear, he said, we\u2019re going to a land where even a Jew can\nbecome a person in the government. And of course he was talking about Bernard\nBaruch. And I\u2019m still a -- you can see, I\u2019m still emotionally very touched by that. It\nmust have been a little bit later than living in Breslau, but it was -- it was certainly --\nyou asked me about what I knew about America? Not a whole lot.",
        "Q: Did you ever hear any of the speeches on the r -- di -- on the radio that Hitler\nmade, and if so, as a child, what did that do to you?",
        "A: I do remember hearing the speeches on the radio, on -- on -- and the yelling, and\nnot really ever being able -- to this day I can\u2019t follow the words, they were so\nJune 23, 2005\ngarbled and mispronounced. But the tone of voice was so grating and the sheer\nshouts of adulation and adoration were frightening in themselves. And I recall my\nfather saying that he had heard, and I\u2019m sure this is so, everybody in the audience\nfelt the fuehrer was looking into his eyes. One was a -- a person was standing there,\none in 10,000 but each one felt that he had been individually touched by this, you\nmust say, charismatic character. It was frightening and the music was frightening\ntoo. The -- the -- the marching music and the boots, the boots, the boots. The beat of\nthe boots, oh, very frightening.",
        "Q: You had spoken about one parade. Were there many parades in Ratibor while\nyou were there?",
        "A: There were a number, I wouldn\u2019t say many, because we left before there were\nmany, but there were quite a number that I recall. I even recall the night that there\nwas a fire in a building not too far away from us and it was always a question as to\nwhy the fire. Was it a set fire because there were Jews living in that building, or was\nit a Christmas three that -- it was on Christmas -- whether it was a Christmas tree\nthat was responsible for it. I don\u2019t think anybody ever knew, but I associate that\npicture along also with the marching, the marching, the beat. It may not have\nhappened at the same time, but in my memory was very -- it must have been very\nclose together. And of course the -- the birthdays that were always celebrated,\nJune 23, 2005\nHitler\u2019s birthday and other notable occasions. And then there were always special\nparades.",
        "Q: What -- what would you do on Hitler\u2019s birthday?",
        "A: We would stay at home. We would not go out. It was not worthwhile\njeopardizing oneself. And still we -- there in -- in Silesia were so much better off, I\nthink, than people in the other parts of Germany. It was a little bit later in coming to\nus. It was as severe, but it was a little later.",
        "Q: Were there banners, Nazi banners hanging from buildings in your town?",
        "A: Yes. I believe that the -- the official building was -- had banners on them -- flags.\nAnd of course you couldn\u2019t miss them, the bright red just was like blood hanging.\nThat I recall. I don\u2019t -- you ask me about pictures of Hitler in the classroom. I don\u2019t\nknow. There may have been the flag, but I\u2019m not su -- I\u2019m really not sure. That I\ndon\u2019t recall.",
        "Q: Did you have to ha -- ever have to say heil Hitler in the classroom, to the\nteacher?",
        "A: In the classroom, I don\u2019t remember. Oh, it must have been. It must have, but I\ndon\u2019t think that -- I don\u2019t think that I raised my arm, but I couldn't swear to that.\nThat I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a little unsure of, but I do know very well walking along the streets\nand seeing my teachers, my various teachers and feeling totally hum -- not -- totally\nJune 23, 2005\nupset by the experience of not being recognized. Although, they tried to be fair with\n-- | think with grades. I don\u2019t think that I was graded down in my -- in my studies.\nI\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t. And I think in some respects these teachers were going through so\nmuch themselves, because usually, people who did become teachers in Germany\nwere very dedicated, true teachers with high ideals and high principles, but when\nyour life depends on it, sometimes those principles change.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nJune 23, 2005\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Renate Chernoff. This is tape number two, side\nA. And can you tell me about celebrating Passover in Ratibor?",
        "A: Well, my most vivid memory of si -- Passover Seders were celebrated with my\nparent\u2019s very dear friends. The Passover with the Weisbarts are really in my\nmemory very frequently because they were absolutely wonderful Seders together.\nThe Weisbarts had a store on the -- downtown in the rink area, the rink area of the\ndowntown part of Ratibor. And it had all sorts of wonderful things like kitchen\nequipment and things for the house and they lived above the shop in a comfortable\napartment. And just above them was a family by the name of Rechnitz. And so on\nSeder evening, first night of Seder, Frau Weisbart, whose husband used to take me\nto synagogue on Saturday mornings and buy me those delicious little rolls, had us\nover -- I think they had no children of their own. I don\u2019t believe -- or perhaps they\ndid, but at any rate, they were not there. He would conduct the service. We were all\ninterspersed, sitting in -- at a long table and I also remember having f -- my four\ncups of wine and being a little bit out of it one year. But they had the most delicious\nsidoram. The food was unbelievable and a particularly good thing was a fish\nshodoe. And I cannot spell it, I don\u2019t know how to tell you about it, but it was fluffy\nJune 23, 2005\nand it was lemony and it had fish in it and it was wonderful. And there were children\naround the table, and -- and a family by the name of Rechnitz, and it was a long\nevening, but always one that was a very, very happy one. I think I remember two\nyears that we were there, and I\u2019m sure there were more years than that. What I think\nis particularly interesting, my husband is very interested in Jewish genealogy and I\nbring this in because it really does relate. There was a request about people who\nknew people in Ratibor and in that general area of Upper Silesia and I answered it\nand I said yes, I do know the area, and immediately a response came, would you\nhappen to know a -- I\u2019m looking for the name Rechnitz. And it came from\nsomebody who was originally in Shanghai. This was a Jewish family who went,\ninstead of going west went east and found refuge in Shanghai, lived out the war\nyears in Shanghai and then came to the United States. And the name of the lady\nwho made the request was Yvonne Adler. And I said, this is very, very strange. I\nsaid, I saw a Mrs. Adler present almost every day when O.J. Simpson trials were\ncarried on. And they sometimes interviewed her, would you be the same one? She\nsaid yes, that was me. So she wanted to know about Rechnitz, and I said yes. And\nshe said, I have no knowledge of their whereabouts. I said, I can tell you nothing\nperhaps of the mother and father, but the two daughters survived and are living in\nIsrael. She was delighted, needless to say. So then a little later a letter came. She\nJune 23, 2005\nsaid, you know, I have a relative who lives in Rockville. Is that close to Potomac? I\nsaid yes, I think within, sort of, walking distance. And so we met in the relatives,\nand had them over for a cup of coffee and enjoyed meeting them. And in between,\nevery now and again, we still get on the genealogy line and a -- express a word of\ngreeting at Passover time, and just to stay little bit in touch. But it all revolved\naround the pass -- that Passover table. And I was able to fill a -- in a little bit on her\nfamily tree, and likewise she was able to fill in a little bit of my family tree, because\na distant cousin of my father\u2019s was an editor of the Jewish newspaper in Shanghai\nduring the years of the second World War. He was an editor in Breslau, made a trip\nand stayed in Shanghai, lived out the years in Shanghai and apparently moved to\nIsrael and unfortunately died there before we could make contact. But she was able\nto help us out in that part of our family tree, so the internet\u2019s a great thing.",
        "Q: And what was his name, the gentleman who was the editor?",
        "A: Let me think. I have it, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not coming through [indecipherable].",
        "Q: All right. W-We can come back to it later, it\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did your family take vacations?",
        "A: Yes. And I\u2019ve -- I have several memorable vacations. My father and mother were\ngreat hikers and they loved to hike in the mountains and so very frequently we went\nJune 23, 2005\nup to the Tetras, and the Riesengebirge and walked and enjoyed the fresh air. I\nhave happy memories of being put into a sled driven by horses and being pulled\nthrough deep snow, and staying at a lodge, and enjoying the -- the winter activities.\nMostly -- it mostly was walking. But -- and this was all very well and good, we\ncould go and do our vacations, go on our vacations and stay at the lodges, or at the\nhotels, but a time came when they were taking no more Jewish visitors and so the\nvacation places were somewhat rationed and we had to go to places that were Jewish\n-- run by Jewish families for Jewish families and that\u2019s where we went on vacation.\nAnd I remember going up to Swinemitinde, which is on the Baltic, where there was\na very lovely vacation spot that catered to the Jewish trade. Was called the Move.\nAnd the M\u00e9ve is a seagull and it was on -- on the water, and we went. I stayed one\nyear with my grandmother and one year I think I went with my mother. Yes, I\nremember going with my mother, because I had to do homework, so not to fall\nbehind. And the German school year was a little bit different, but I was allowed to --\nto miss a little time, as long as my mother kept up with the assignments with me. But\nit was interesting to think that we were really isolated even in where we could spend\nvacation time. Swinemunde was rather fri -- to me was a little bit of a frightening\nplace to be because the lodge where I stayed with my grandmother sat opposite of\nPeenemiunde. And that\u2019s where the Germans were building their U-boats and we\nJune 23, 2005\ncould see the white boats in the harbor, across the water. And we were well aware of\nthe fact that in 1937, there were definite attempts at getting ready for a war. And I --\nI still see in my mind\u2019s eye the white -- the very white painted ships against very\ngray waters. And rather frightening looking, they looked like sharks.",
        "Q: Wow, mm-hm. Anything else in Ratibor that you wanted to talk about?",
        "A: There was a very -- in Ratibor was a very nice municipal swimming pool, and I\nwas given my first instructions to swimming at that pool, I was five years old and it\nwas a funny way of learning how to swim. There were ro -- there were L-shaped\nrods -- well, actually probably fairly stable pipes that had ropes on them, that were\nsuspended over the water, and we were hooked onto these ropes, and were 1n a very\nsafe place to study our strokes. And I -- I learned how to swim that way, I became a\nvery good swimmer, very fast. And I remember it was a miserable day and I was\nabout to take my test to pass to get my first card, and it required 15 minutes of\nuninterrupted swimming around the pool, the edge of the pool. And as I say, it was a\ndreary day, but my grandmother was visiting and she took me to the pool. And I\npassed, I even did 20 minutes, but in order to get your card you had to jump in at the\nfar end, into the deep water. This I could not do. I was a totally petrified creature.\nBut they said well, if you will jump, if we put you on the harness and the rope, we\nwill let you pass. And of course I did, and I got my certificate and I was the happiest\nJune 23, 2005\nperson in the world. But then that was closed to Jews after we left. It was no longer\nallowed for Jewish people to -- to swim there. But at least I learned how to swim.",
        "Q: So then you went off to Berlin while your parents settled -- were getting settled,\nand you were with your grandmother. And how long did you stay in Berlin?",
        "A: Actually, I think I probably was there less time than in my imagination. I was\nthere a matter of maybe six months. But I was so lonely, and my grandmother tried\nto make it so pleasant and comfortable for me, but I was away from my parents and I\nwas very unhappy. I went to a school where I didn\u2019t know anybody. It was a Jewish\nschool and I didn\u2019t know Hebrew and all the children knew Hebrew. I was\ndevastated. However, the period came to an end and I saw a little bit of Berlin. I\ndon\u2019t remember very much of it, I remember where my grandmother lived, I\nremember where the beautiful synagogue was at which Dr. Joachim Prince was the\n-- the m -- the rabbi. I remember going to a service there. I re -- I remember going to\nthe zoo and to -- doing things that little children like to do, but in general I have a\nvery, very limited memory of what went on there, as opposed to the very accurate\nmemory I have of Ratibor, where I c -- I can draw a map and I drew a map for my\nfather some years back when -- and asked him whether he could go over this map\nwith me to see whether my memory was accurate, and he said absolutely. The\nmemory of the street where the dentist was, and where the knit shop was and where\nJune 23, 2005\nthe market was and so on and so forth. But my memory of Berlin is not at all that\ngood. However, when I moved back to be with my family in Breslau, when I came\nback to Breslau, I have a much better memory of that place.",
        "Q: When you were in Berlin, did you see lots of evidence of Nazi party symbols?",
        "A: Actually, I don\u2019t even remember that. I think there must have been -- there must\nhave been, but I cannot visually pinpoint it as to where I might have seen it. My\ngrandmother, I am sure took me only to places that were permitted. It was\ninteresting, my uncle, my mother\u2019s younger brother went to Israel. He wanted very\nmuch to emigrate to Israel and in 1935 or th -- \u201936, he went to Israel and had a\nmarvelous experience and wanted very, very much to go and settle there. He saw the\nhandwriting on the wall and he wanted -- he had a chance to buy into Egged, the bus\ncompany. And my grandmother did not want to leave Berlin and she would not give\nhim the money, although it was there in spades. The consequence was that Ludz did\nnot go to Israel, had a terrible time leaving Germany, and my grandmother didn\u2019t\nmake it at all. There was a wonderful opportunity where the wrong turn was taken.\nYou ask did I see much evidence? I just really honestly cannot recall. Mm, I can\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did your parents come visit you in Berlin while you were there?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have memories of my parents visiting me at all because they were in the\nthroes of moving and setting up a practice and trying to start getting things ready for\nJune 23, 2005\na possible chance to -- to emigrate. My mother was very reluctant to emigrate. She\nwanted more than -- she was sure this was all going to blow over. My father knew\nbetter, or he -- he did indeed know better. He was sure that it wouldn\u2019t and so at that\npoint they were putting feelers out to see what might happen and what ha -- in effect\nhappened was my father, being a physician was contacted by a number of countries\nin South America who were opening their doors to physicians particularly. And it\nwas either Uruguay or Paraguay, and I\u2019m sh -- not sure that I remember, but one of\nthe -- one of those two countries that made a most attractive offer, but my father, not\nSpanish speaking, not having had too much contact with the Spanish speaking\npopulation decided that might not be for him. He also did not want to go to Israel, I\nmight add. He was not at all set on going to Israel. But in the meantime, this\nwonderful telegram showed up, the one that really saved us when we were able to\nestablish a family -- a blood connection to someone who lived in Canada. The\nquestion 1s, could we get into Canada, because Canada had a very tight quota. You\nmight know the -- the book, 6,000 is too many and indeed I don\u2019t even think that\nthey got 6,000, or allowed 6,000 in. But an -- at any rate, perhaps this is not what I --\nwhat I should be -- yeah. So my father turned down Uruguay or Paraguay, turned\ndown Israel, but was absolutely positive that we had to leave. And so my mother\ndecided she better learn how to do something. And so my mother, who was a singer\nJune 23, 2005\nand a lady who entertained beautifully and who was a -- a homemaker at heart\ndecided that she would study and did study under ORT auspices, and studied\nphysiotherapy. She had always loved a -- gym and exercise and physical culture and\nso on. Right up her alley, and she, in Breslau went to school and studied\nphysiotherapy. And really, in effect, this step did keep body and soul together once\nwe did come to Canada. And she loved what she was doing, and she did it for many\n-- well, for a number of years. So that was while I was in Berlin, she also started on\nthat and got -- got into class and worked.",
        "Q: And this is the Jewish Organization for Rehabilitation and Training. You said\nyour father did not want to go to Israel. Were your parents Zionists in any way?",
        "A: My parents were not Zionists. You know, in Germany there was the big schism,\nthe blue and white and the black and white. He did not belong to the blue and white,\nalthough that changed too. I mean, he was the strongest supporter of Israel that\nanybody could wish for, but at the time of our move he thought he could not take the\nweather in Israel. That was why.",
        "Q: Y-You said he was a psychiatrist. He obvious -- he had an adult clientele. Did he\nhave any kind of more of a specialty or just general psychiatry?",
        "A: Actually, when he went to school, and he went to school at the university in\nBreslau after he came back from the war, he studied neu-neurology and psychiatry,\nJune 23, 2005\nthat was a -- a study that always went hand in hand. And then he went for\nspecialized work to Munich and studied in Munich for awhile before he actually\nwent into practice. He dealt mostly with adult patients and he did some very early\nwork on mescaline, which became a drug a -- that was used for, I believe\nrecreational, but it was a -- a very potent drug and he wrote one of the first papers on\nmescaline. And he also dealt with bromism, which I\u2019m not sure I really understand.\nAnd then he got very interested and very involved with electric shock therapy, and\nwas exceedingly successful with electroshock until it was sort of downplayed, and\nwas not used any more. And now things have come back and they are using electric\nshock therapy, under perhaps better circumstances because of the muscle relaxants\nand things that go with it. But my father was exceedingly successful. I always felt he\nwas out of favor with the establishment because his basis, from the earliest of all\ntimes he said, we will find biochemical and biologic basis for mental problems and\ndiseases of the mind. And of course when Freud became so popular, he was not at\nall in the swing. And he stuck to his guns and I think the world has changed. He was\nmore of a Jungian. He was extremely interested in what Jung had to tell us. And he\nreally felt, and I think he was -- h-he -- it -- it came to pass that his way of thinking\nwas quite right, quite on the ball. And he worked until he was -- worked 1n his\nprofession until he was 80 years old. And at that point in time he felt he couldn\u2019t\nJune 23, 2005\nkeep up with all the new medications and then decided that this was -- this was not,\nyou know, good for the patient. But he was quite successful in his -- in his work and\nhe loved every minute of it. He was the sort of person who, if somebody in the\nprovince, in New Brunswick when we came to Canada, was ill and needed his\nhelp, he got into his car and drove 300 miles without batting an eye. If the patient\nneeded him, he was there. He made housecalls.",
        "Q: That is some kind of a housecall.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Oh my gosh, yes.",
        "Q: All right, now you\u2019re finished being in Berlin, you\u2019re back with your family in\nBreslau, and how long did you stay there?",
        "A: I would say probably only a year. It was a very full year though, because I had to\nget used to a new school and new surroundings. I lived fairly far away from the\nschool, the na -- [tape break]",
        "Q: We were talking about your full year in Berlin.",
        "A: I --",
        "Q: I mean in Breslau [indecipherable]",
        "A: Ah yes, I moved back to Breslau and I was started in the Jewish school in\nBreslau, Raydia ar -- school and all children there were Jewish. All, or most\neveryone was trying to leave and -- and I think everybody\u2019s mind was such that --\nJune 23, 2005\nthat we were il -- we were losing people every day in school. I went to Raydia\nshula, it was a Jewish school. It was a sizeable Jewish school, much bigger than my\nschool in Ratibor, certainly ba -- much bigger than the one in Berlin, which was a\nsmall, little independent school. This was a large school, and almost all the children\nthere were being prepared, really, to leave the country. Hebrew was very big in the\ncurriculum and I was painfully inadequate. I did not like the school. I only made two\nfriends while I was in school and it was -- 1t was a very unhappy time of my life. My\nfather started his new practice and my grandmother -- my grandmother was having\nto rent out more rooms so that things would go reasonably well. She was made to\ngive up the store at the point of a gun. This beautiful store, this beautiful toy shop,\nthe biggest one in the entire province of Siles -- of Silesia, where people came from\nall over to buy. In fact, the people who had the guta, the large farms, these enormous\nfarms would bring their families in at Christmastime to do their shopping at Garson\nFrankel. That was the name of the store, was the name actually of my great-\ngrandfather. The store had been in the family since 1826 and my grandmother was\nrunning it with her sister because both had lost their husbands, and they were made\nto sell it, as I say, because it was taken over. And I even have a clipping to the effect\nthat it\u2019s now Aryan, a big clipping from the newspaper. So she took in borders into\nher big, beautiful home and everybody got along very well. But it was not as it was\nJune 23, 2005\nbefore. Still, she was able to have help in the house because help was still allowed to\nwork. It was later that the help was not allowed to work for Jewish people any more,\nbut at that time, in that place, there was help.",
        "Q: Were the borders Jewish?",
        "A: I believe they were. I do believe they were. The house was one, two -- four\nstories high and the lowest part had the servant quarters of the gardener, which\nbecame our apartment. It was on the lowest level, the entry level and there were\nlovely shrubs around it. I remember there were lilacs that smelled so beautifully, and\nLilies of the Valley. Had a large iron gate that opened up to allow cars to move in.\nWe di -- she did not -- we did not have a car. My father had his motorcycle, never\ndrove a car until he came to Canada. And then there was the rote deala. That was a\nred foyer where when people came to visit, left their coats before being shown\nupstairs. And that was, of course, my favorite place to play because everything was\nso beautiful. Red satin or velvet or plush, very beautiful, with a bay window looking\nout into the shrubs. And then the back or side part of it had a huge kitchen. It was\nnot a kitchen for cooking though, it was an area to do the laundry. And every week\nthe laundresses came in and that was always great fun for me because they would\nhand wash everything on boards and then they would rinse it and then dry them, and\nthen at the end of the day the two of them would take the sheets, one standing at one\nJune 23, 2005\nend, one at the other and they would pull them in order to dry them completely and\nmy greatest joy was to stand underneath in the middle and have my hair fly up into\nthe sheets. It was such a joy and it was so much fun. That was so much fun. We had\na lovely gardener who took care of the garden, which had a walk all around it so that\none could stroll around a central green area. And then the borders were all peonies\nand roses and lovely shade flowers and tall trees. And then there was a small garden\narch that led into the fruits and vegetable gardens. And we had gooseberries. Never\nsee gooseberries any more. And red and white currants and raspberries and apple\ntrees and peach trees. It was -- it was a paradise, it was absolutely lovely, and the\ngardener worked hard to do -- to keep it so. And the back of the house had an\nenormous balcony so that one could sit in the balcony and then look down on this\nlovely green area and then into the distance where the fruit trees were.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Renate Chernoff. This is tape number two, side\nB. Cou -- let\u2019s start talking about the actions that your father took to try to get the\nfamily ou-out of Germany.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Once my grandmother was found and was able to establish contact with a distant\nrelative who had emigrated to Canada much earlier, and I wish I could tell you\nexactly when, I don\u2019t ec -- but, at any rate, he was a blood relative and action was\ntaken to try to contact him and see whether he could, in any way help out. His\nresponse was immediate and he said he could, of course try to help out but not\nmonetarily because it was in the late 30\u2019s and Canada was still reeling, as the\nStates, I know must have been after the depression, and really no one had much of\nanything. He -- Uncle Charlie, his name was Charlie Redlish, had established a\nsmall institute where he treated alcoholics. And it was very small and he ran it by\nhimself with one nurse. But he apparently was successful enough, but I don\u2019t think\nwas getting paid exceedingly well because he and his wife and his married daughter\nand unmarried daughter, all -- an-and son and his wife all had to live together in one\nflat just to be able to make it. But he was instrumental in getting things going and\nvery fortunately, his daughter Fay Redlish had a friend who was extremely well-to-\ndo. He was in the manufacturing business of men\u2019s suits, and at the time just before\nthe war, was starting to get contracts for army uniforms, and apparently had an in\npolitically speaking. And Jack took it upon himself, and I think I\u2019m right in saying\nthis, that he went up to Ottawa to see whether there was some way of expediting\nbringing us into Canada. Well, Canada had the law, of course, that only farmers\nJune 23, 2005\nand physicians could come in, and the other law, the law stated that they, if after a\nyear\u2019s time, the person could not make it on their own in Canada, they would be\nsent back. So it was a trial run, so to speak. In addition to fulfilling that, the person\nalso had to bring 3200 dollars with them, which at that point in time I guess must\nhave been a fair amount of money. And it took many months to actually get the\npermission to come, and once the permission was granted there was an awful lot to\ngo through as far as the Canadian authorities were concerned, but as far as the\nGerman authorities were concerned. Because they were on our tails constantly about\nsigning this paper and that paper. And during that period of time, many people were\ncalled to the police stations and never returned. This was a time in \u00b036 - \u00b037, when\npeople were called on unbelievably small details to their leaving and to their lives,\nthey were called, and they were made to jump off buildings. And this happened\nindeed, to friends of ours. Well, I think I can tell you, one day my father was called.\nWe were trembling, I think all day long, but he was one of the lucky ones. He signed\nwhatever he needed to sign and pay whatever he needed to pay and he came back. In\nthe meantime we were granted permission and a van was ordered to pack up our\nthings. And I think it\u2019s interesting to mention that we were allowed to bring things\nwith us that had been -- that were old things. So my grandmother suggested that we\ntake her furniture because that could be certified as being old. I don\u2019t know how -- I\nJune 23, 2005\n-- | know it was 10 years on suits because my father had to go to his tailor and tell\nhim to put labels into his suits which indicated when they were made, and he did.\nBut the van was -- as I say, was ordered and some of the old pieces were packed and\n-- and put in, but nothing of their modern furniture could come with them, it -- it was\nonly the old things, which -- which was fine. But when we were packing -- and my\nfather ha-had a terrific library, and a wonderful stamp collection, and when the\nactual packing took place, the Nazi, with their guns came, and they stood over us as\nwe were doing the packing. And I remember very, very well, we were in our little\ndownstairs gardener\u2019s apartment with lots and lots of boxes on the floor, these two\nmen with guns watching as my father packed all the books. And whenever they liked\na book -- an they particularly liked my children\u2019s books, they just helped\nthemselves. And they helped themselves to some of my father\u2019s stamps too, and\nthere wasn\u2019t a thing we could do about it. And I remember my father putting his\nhand to his mouth and saying shh. It was just, that\u2019s the way it was done. Well, he\nstill came over with a lot of books and I did come over with some children\u2019s books,\nbut I think my best ones didn\u2019t come with me. That\u2019s all right. But it was just, you\nknow, the situation. Also, for example, it\u2019s interesting; in that same apartment where\nwe were packing the books, we were also taking our food, because we were not\nallowed to eat with our grandmother upstairs. We had to eat separately. I mean, the\nJune 23, 2005\nlittle downstairs apartment was like an independently organized apartment. They\nwere allowed to bring the food down to us, but we couldn\u2019t eat it together with them\nupstairs. All the boarders could eat upstairs and my grandmother could eat upstairs,\nbut we couldn\u2019t, and we had to eat downstairs.",
        "Q: How would your family know this rule, this regulation that you couldn\u2019t eat\nupstairs? How were you told?",
        "A: Oh, you know, that I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t recall, but there would be -- day\nafter day there would be leaflets left on th-the doorstep and people were checking\nup. So, I assume it must have been through those leaflets. Otherwise I -- I can\u2019t\nimagine. But there were people always coming by and always checking up.",
        "Q: What about your going outside to play with friends?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go out to play at all. I went to school, but I rode my bicycle on the side of\nthe street. I took a streetcar to school and I remember having to actually change\nplaces on Victoriastrassen and -- into another streetcar and that seemed to be safe\nenough. I don\u2019t remember having friends when I was in Breslau at all, because I\nwas hardly there long enough and people -- there wasn\u2019t that nice easy going back\nand forth to houses as there is in America, it just wasn\u2019t there. And surely not at that\npoint in time. I only had -- I only made two friends while I was in Breslau. I wasn\u2019t\nthere that long, I guess, and the times were just not conducive.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: When you would see a Nazi officer in uniform, do you d -- do you remember any\nvisceral effects it had on you?",
        "A: You know, I must say I don\u2019t. Again, I don\u2019t remember, other than seeing them in\ngroups. And yes, I was scared, terribly scared because of what I remembered from\nRatibor. But I -- either I was held away from being put into that situation or it\nperhaps just didn\u2019t register. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I remember in Breslau it\nwas not a time to go to the movie theater, because we couldn\u2019t. It was not a time to\ngo to a concert because we couldn\u2019t. And I think everything was in the home. There\nwasn\u2019t much of that either. I think the times were so desperate. My mother went to\nclass and came home. But I have to add this, because this I think is very important.\nMy parents both decided it was -- would be good if they took English lessons. And\nso they found out that there was a man, an Englishman who was settled in Breslau,\nwho was giving lessons to people who were leaving the country. My parents decided\nto also study English, as many of their friends were, a-and they went to the home of\nsomebody who had come from England and who was doing something other than\ngiving English lessons. But he gave English lessons on the side, and he gave them in\nthe evening, and my parents decided to take them. And first they walked into his\nhome, and he\u2019s -- they were sitting at his desk, he with his back to a huge picture of\nMr. Moseby. And who is Mr. Moseby? He was the Nazi of England. He was the\nJune 23, 2005\nemissary there. Well, my mother and father said, we\u2019ve got to learn English, we\u2019ve\ngot to face Moseby, and they went ahead and did and just disliked the occasion\nterribly but liked their teacher. Their teacher was a very good teacher and a very nice\nperson. So they never could understand why Moseby was there, but he was there.",
        "Q: So th-th -- you said they continued with their English lessons.",
        "A: Yes, they took their English lessons and they did rather well and at least got a\nlittle bit of a foundation and developed their hearing skills and along with taking the\n-- along with taking the ORT group, my father also learned how to concoct beauty\npreparations. He learned how to make cold creams and vanishing creams and\nmoisturizing creams and all sorts of things practical. And this stood us in very good\nstead, actually. And he bought jars, beautifully designed jars and labels for the jars,\nso -- in English -- so that they could be at -- affixed to the jars that perhaps might be\nof -- of use on immi -- on immigration. So that was a time when you asked what did\npeople do, my parents were very busy, taking classes and doing very practical\nthings.",
        "Q: Did you know they were preparing to leave?",
        "A: I knew, yes. I knew that we were going to leave. When my mother -- when my\nfather finally persuaded my mother that we had no alternative, she came around to it\nand of course I knew, because of the papers that needed signing and the\nJune 23, 2005\ndocumentation that needed to be gotten and the visits to ready ourselves, yes. And of\ncourse, when the furniture was being packed, I think it was very clear. It was very --\na very difficult time for my grandmother, because unfortunately we could not bring\nher with us. The Canadian government put an age limit on those whom they would\npermit. And of course, she was not a trained person, either a farmer or a physician,\nso she -- on her own she would not be able to go. And she could not come as a\nmember of the family, much to the everlasting sadness that my father went through.\nHe was an only child and he was very close to his mother, and I think he suffered\nterribly, just the fact that she had to stay behind.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Her name was Hedwig, Frankel was her maiden name, Fischer. And the store\u2019s\nname was Garson Frankel, it was her father\u2019s and that family\u2019s store. She was a\ngood business lady, she was very interested in genealogy. In fact, I\u2019ve just put\ntogether lots and lots of genealogic data, much of which she wrote down in German\nscript. And since there are not too many of us left who can still re-read German\nscript, I thought I\u2019d best do that, and I\u2019ve done it and I am so glad because it has\nopened up all sorts of interesting new avenues to investigate. And unfortunately she\n-- she was taken to Belzec. And you know Belzec, of course is a -- was a killing\ncamp. So that was her demise. I -- I [indecipherable]\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: How old was she when she died?",
        "A: Well, we\u2019re not really quite sure, but I know that I\u2019m older than she was when\nshe died. In fact, I think she must have been 60. Probably something like that. I can\nlook that up, I -- that I don\u2019t know exactly. But she was the -- it -- it was so much\nfun visiting her when I was a little girl because she read stories to me and she\nintroduced me to handwork. She did beautiful tatting and beautiful crocheting and I\nstill have collars that she made me, which I have put into tissue paper, and have kept\na tablecloth that she made for my mother, and just lovely handiwork.",
        "Q: So your family was preparing to leave. Were you kind of thinking of what to take\nwith you, cause you know you\u2019d be leaving your home?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that I had any choice, because they could not buy things new for me,\nso I had to take what I had. And for themselves they couldn\u2019t either, so we went with\nwhat we had, we couldn\u2019t really prepare in that sense, at all.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Nope.",
        "Q: So what was it like when you had to leave, for you emotionally?",
        "A: Well, I remember taking leave from my grandmother -- my grandmother in\nBerlin, we said goodbye to earlier on. When we moved to -- I think she came to visit\nus and we said goodbye then. My grandmother in Breslau, with whom we stayed,\nJune 23, 2005\nwe said goodbye and -- and it was a very -- it was a very quiet time. And I remember\nthat one of the people who rented rooms from my grandmother was a pianist, and he\nplayed one of Chopin\u2019s etudes. And to this day, when I hear that etude, the tears\ncome -- welled up in -- welled up in my eyes. This -- there was not much to say. I\nthink we all knew that this would be the last time and we were taking leave. It was --\nit was tough, very tough. I don\u2019t remember how we got to where we went, I mean to\nthe station, but I know we went by train. I don\u2019t know how we got there. We went\nby train from Breslau to Hamburg and in Hamburg we had to undergo medical\nchecks with a Canadian doctor. And that was not a nice experience, but 1t was done.\nMy mother, who very early in her life developed glaucoma, she was in her 40\u2019s, she\nthinks that the doctor who examined her, Canadian doctor who examined her, might\nhave had a suspicion that there was something there, but he didn\u2019t let on. All she\nremembers is that she was forever getting her eyes examined. Now, she was an\nundiagnosed glaucoma [indecipherable], so imagine if she had had the glaucoma 10\nyears before and they would have told her about it, she might never have gone blind.\nBecause she did eventually become blind. But yes, we passed our exams, our\nphysicals.",
        "Q: Did they check you?",
        "A: Yes.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: How did they do that?",
        "A: All over. All over and then some, a little bit more than they really needed to, I\nthink, but I passed. And --",
        "Q: Was your mother able to stay with you during the time?",
        "A: Yes, yes, she was. But it was -- you know, I was a little girl, nine years old. It was\nnot -- it wasn\u2019t my doctor, the one that I was used to, and being patted all over by a\nstrange person who was not -- whose language I didn\u2019t understand, was not a happy\nsituation.",
        "Q: What month in 1938 was this?",
        "A: Well, I figure it must have been June, or July. June or July. My mother\u2019s brother\ncame to see us off -- I mean, came to Hamburg to see us before we took our leave,\nand oh well, we were hoping that we would see each other again. And we did.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But it was very iffy, because he hadn\u2019t gotten permission to leave Germany, and\nit was late 30\u2019s -- mid-30\u2019s.",
        "Q: The anschluss had taken place in March of \u201938, when Hitler marched into\nAustria. Did you -- were you aware of that, or did your parents tell you about that?",
        "A: Yes, they did, and they -- I could -- you know, interestingly enough, they didn\u2019t\nhave to tell me. There was so much electricity 1n the air, just our every day routine.\nJune 23, 2005\nAnd hearing particularly what was happening, through the maids, who went out and\ndid their shopping and who went and -- to church. We always were aware of what\npeople were thinking and what they were talking about. I think it came -- it came as\na bit of a shock, I think. But then my father -- by that time my father had already\nmade up his mind to go, and I think that reinforced his judgment. It was just such a\nnerve-wracking time to be there. One had to watch ones P\u2019s and Q\u2019s so carefully.\nDidn\u2019t say anything in public, didn\u2019t have an -- you know, even -- even when --\nwhen you went for little walks, you\u2019d look around and sort of make sure that nobody\nwas hearing your conversation. It was fraught with -- with all sorts of intangible,\nunpleasant things.",
        "Q: Did you see any violence on the street?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I wasn\u2019t on the street long enough, really. I -- I was fairly well\nsheltered. I don\u2019t -- that I don\u2019t recall. But I recall the dinner conversations when so\nand so was asked to come up to the Gestapo and so and so lost his business and such\nand such a person was asked for extra documentation, which of course they didn\u2019t\nhave. And it was -- it was just an unsure and uncertain and nerve-wracking time.\nAnd I think my mother, who was a bit of an insomniac must have suffered terribly.\nBut you know, life continued and it\u2019s amazing that it does, but it did. And bi -- after\nHamburg and having the medical exam and seeing our -- my Uncle Ludz, we were\nJune 23, 2005\nput on the train and we left for -- for Holland first, on our way to England. And I\ndon\u2019t remember the day that it was, but it must have been -- 1t was in the summer of\n1938, and we were on the train from Hamburg to Hoek van Holland, which was\nthe port, the seaport in Holland, before getting on the little peanut boat to\nGreenwich. And I remember we had second class tickets. My father had gotten\nthose and we were to get on the train and we were entering the second class carriage\nwhen somebody came waving a paper. Dr. Fischer, Dr. Fischer, would you kindly\nmove over into the first class carriage? My father said he had second class tickets.\nYes, but 1t would -- it would be better if we went into the first class carriage. I\nremember it so vividly, but the second class carriage had red leather seats, and first\nclass carriage had green velvet seats. I was dressed -- what is it, to the sevens? To\nthe fours?",
        "Q: To the nines.",
        "A: To the nines, well okay, I was very nicely dressed with while gloves. I remember\nmy mother slipping several rings on my fingers and telling me to keep my gloves on,\nwhich I did. But we were ushered into this very nice carriage and sat with not too\nmany people, whereas the other carriage was very, very full, and we came to the\nborder and I know we came to the border because there was my father, knowing\nexactly at what time that train was leaving Germany and getting into Holland,\nJune 23, 2005\nbecause he was waiting to be out of the clutches. Just before the border, the stop\nbefore the border, the train stopped. Second class carriage people left the train. We\nwent on without many of second class carriage people. Pll never forget it. I will\nnever forget it. And my father to this day said, we were that lucky because of the\nEnglish teacher with Moseby\u2019s picture in back. He was trying to help people out of\nGermany in whatever way they could. My father said he was very interested in\nknowing what trains we were taking. And really, my mother and father both, many,\nmany times had said, if it hadn\u2019t been for the English teacher, we might not have\ngotten out of second class carriage. So we crossed the border. I remember\neverybody, we three, just hugging each other, crying and making our way over to\nHoek van Holland and getting on our little boat. My father and I got very sick\ncrossing the English channel. My mother, the good rider -- or sailor I should say, had\nno problems whatsoever, as she did on the voyage across the Atlantic as well. And\nwe landed in Greenwich -- or Harwich -- Harwich. S-Sorry, Harwich [| think it\nwas. H-a-r-w-i-c-h. Yeah, Harwich. And from there we took the train to London.\nAnd in London my father had made arrangements for us to stay 1n a very nice hotel,\nwhich we have since visited. And we stayed there and h-he had fraternity brothers in\nLondon and his cousin was in -- no, his cousin wasn\u2019t there yet. But the fraternity\nbrothers were in London and we had a few very nice days in London until about\nJune 23, 2005\nthree days before we were to sail to Canada, I came down with appendicitis. Had to\ngo to the hospital emergency. Where did they take me? To the German hospital. Had\nto have my appendix removed, and fate again, fate unbelievable. I was on the\noperating table, about ready to have my appendix removed when the young surgeon\nwho came and was about to do the job said, oh, and what\u2019s your name and where are\nyou from, and said, is your father a physician? Yes. And we -- we established the\nfact that my father was a physician, and he said, he helped me out in my final exam.\nI told this story to my father. He said, you know, he was trying to keep calm, but\nsure enough, my father slipped him some answers when he was taking his final\nexam. And this was the doctor who took out my appendix. But I had to stay in\nhospital for a week, I guess it is. I was very well looked after, but 1t was a German\nhospital. And I suppose it was good that I was there because I understood what was\ngoing on, and they understood what I -- and af -- we had to miss our boat to\nCanada, and that was the difficult part.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nJune 23, 2005\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",

        "A: I had a lovely doll, a Katie [indecipherable] doll and something happened to her\nbetween the -- in the last 20 years. I cannot locate her and I am desolate. Yes, mine\n[indecipherable]. I certainly brought a doll with me and I don\u2019t think I brought too\nmuch else in way of toys. That was -- not even a Teddy bear, I don\u2019t think so. Just a\ndoll.",
        "Q: You were nine years old at the time. Also, did you -- a-and you also said the\nGermans who were watching you while you were packing took some of your\nchildren\u2019s books. Did you have any favorite children\u2019s books that you didn\u2019t bring\nwith you?",
        "A: I brought some fairy tales and a few stories about animals and I still have them\nand look at them every now and again. There was one lovely one about an aquarium.\nBut I loved fairy tales. My mother always used to say [speaks German here]. I am\ntoo much involved in play. I was always imagining, playing imaginary games of -- I\nJune 23, 2005\nthink my joy 1n life was to be a princess, to have a crown on my head and to eat\nnoodle soup. I -- I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t think of other toys. I did bring card games. Some\ngames and some puzzles. And I have the card games, they were quartets and they\nwere quartets dealing with authors and with flowers and with comics. Very funny\ncomics from the newspaper, but they were in sets of fours. And also cards with\nletters so that one could make Scrabble words, but all as cards. Small, small things.\nBut I think that\u2019s all. Maybe a chessboard.",
        "Q: And -- all right, you\u2019ve now recuperated from your appendix operation? And then\nwhat happened?",
        "A: I recuperated, and my father of course, had to scout around to find a new -- a\nvoyage for us across the ocean and it was close to September and the visitors were\nreturning back to Canada after vacationing in Europe. It was a particularly busy\ntime of the year because the teachers were coming home on their trips and it was -- it\nwas a bit of a -- of -- of a difficulty. However, the Canadian embassy could not have\nbeen nicer. They found my folks a place to stay because staying at a hotel was too\nexpensive, and they settled them in somebody\u2019s home in Golders Green, which is a\nf -- well-known Jewish community, and perhaps not so far away from the hospital\neither. And they arranged, through the Jewi -- with the help of the Jewish Aid\nSociety in London to get us a later boat over and we came over on the Montrose,\nJune 23, 2005\nwhich was a slightly smaller ship than we were supposed to come on, but they had\nroom for the three of us and we had a good voyage across the sea. At least my\nmother had a good voyage. My father and I took it downstairs. We were -- he and I\nwere quite seasick. Not that it was such a hazardous journey at -- according to the\ninformation that I got from pier 21, it was a rather smooth journey, but our stomachs\ndid not know that. My mother played ping pong onboard and we were downstairs.",
        "Q: Were there many refugees on the bor -- on the boat?",
        "A: No, there were not. There were -- I don\u2019t think there were -- I -- as far as I know\nthere were none, and I have the -- I have the entire list of the people in our class,\ntourist class, and we did not see Jewish names at all. Most of them, as I say, were\nreturning visitors to Europe. Did not at all. We did have iceberg practice and we all\ngot into our assigned jackets and had to parade out. And we were very close to an\niceberg. I think it\u2019s as close as I'd like to get to an iceberg. But it was a drill, and of\ncourse everybody took part. There was a very nice party, I\u2019m told, at the end of the\nride. I don\u2019t think my parents were in -- in a partying mood, but there was a party.\nAnd I should mention to you that the last day, the day that we were supposed to --\nthat we did in fact land in Montreal, I woke up and could not move. I had total\nparalysis of both my legs and my father had to carry me off the boat. This happened\ntwice in my life. This was the first time, and the second time it happened when, as a\nJune 23, 2005\nstudent in 1948, I had the -- and I was on an international student service seminar, I\nhad the opportunity to go back to Germany and the same thing happened. I woke up\nparalyzed from my waist down. The paralysis did not last very long. My father\ncarried me off the boat. The relatives were there to meet us. And in a day the\nparalysis was gone. I think they call this a hysterical paralysis, which it undoubtedly\nwas. Terribly frightened.",
        "Q: What were you frightened of?",
        "A: This new life in a new country where we didn\u2019t know the language, where we\ndidn\u2019t know anybody really, not even our relatives. I think just terrible fright. But\nyou know, it happened that time, the first time and we ascribed it to that. But it was\ninteresting that it should happen -- what was it, 10 years later? Again, and th-the\nreturn visit. And I\u2019ve never been back to Germany, you know.",
        "Q: Did you know any English at all?",
        "A: I didn't. Not at all. And I learned it very quickly. But for the first couple of\nmonths I was very silent, but after that I could grapple with it quite nicely. I sat. My\nschoolteacher did not allow me to have a dictionary in school. She wanted me to\nabsorb it totally by ear, which I guess perhaps was the right thing to do. I was\nhorrified that I couldn\u2019t have my dictionary, but she didn\u2019t allow it, and I learned it\nvery well.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: So you settled in Montreal?",
        "A: We came to Montreal and met Uncle Charlie and Aunt Bertha, the people who\nsent the telegram, and their children and it was decided that all of us, Uncle Char-\nCharlie, and his wife and the daughter, married Wilfred and their son, and my\nmother and father and I would all take a flat together in Montreal. And we did, and\nwe all lived together for a number of years in one flat, where --",
        "Q: When you mentioned telegram what were you referring to?",
        "A: Well, I think the telegram was sort of the lynchpin, if you will. This was a\ntelegram that arrived at the wedding, for the wedding of my grandparents, sent by a\ndistant relative in Canada by the name of Charlie -- Charles Redlish. It was a\ntelegram that was sent to send congratulations to the wedding of and the mishpoka\nof the grandparent, my grandparents. And my grandmother kept that telegram, as she\nkept many, many things, and remembered in the 30\u2019s that there was somebody in\nCanada who was distantly related. And this telegram really started the\ncorrespondence between my parents and that distant relative that lived in Montreal.\nAnd I have many copies of this telegram because I feel it was the thing that saved\nour lives. The one item that established a relationship with family abroad.",
        "Q: When you started school, were you placed in your chronological grade, or a\nyounger grade?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: No, actually I started in grade four and was in my -- with my own peer group, so\nthat I had to learn English, but I think I could do most everything else. Math I\ncertainly could do, and I learned English soon enough. By the end of the year I won\nthe prize for the best student. So I didn\u2019t do too badly. I worked hard at my studies\nbecause I had so much to catch up on. My distant relative played all kinds of tricks\non me and made me say horrible things because I didn't know what I was saying.\nAnd I got into a lot of trouble, but it sorted itself out.",
        "Q: Did you miss Germany? Did you consider Germany your home at that point?",
        "A: I missed my friends, I missed my grandmothers. I don\u2019t know that I missed the\nphysical part of Germany. I think at that age perhaps that\u2019s not so important, but I\ncertainly missed my friends. It was so much -- there was so much to learn and so\nmuch new, and so much to catch up with. It -- the impressions came so hard and so\nfast and they were so different. Coming from -- coming from a home, for example,\nas we were lucky enough to have, with servants and whatnot to a one room that we\nstayed in. We had one room and that -- that was it. It was a -- a new lifestyle, but\nyou know, my -- my mother particularly was quite adventuresome. My father\nbecame very depressed. My father, who was unable to find work because they\nwouldn\u2019t let him work, was in a -- sort of a desperate situation and as the war years\ncame along, it became even more so. Because remember, in Canada, the war started\nJune 23, 2005\nSeptember the third, 1939. We were at war exactly a year from the date we arrived\nin Canada. My father tried to join the army, they wouldn\u2019t have him because he\nwasn\u2019t a citizen. He wanted to join the medical corps, they wouldn\u2019t have him\nbecause he wasn\u2019t registered as a medic in Canada and you couldn\u2019t become a\nmedic in Canada until you took up citizenship. And so all -- everything was closed,\nand his main concern was trying to get the grandmothers over. And he had\nabsolutely no luck in that department. I know he traveled back and forth to Ottawa\ntrying to persuade the powers that be, the natio -- the commissioner of refugees, a\nwonderful woman by the name of Senator Karen Wilson, to see if there was some\nway of getting the grandparents out, even if it would be over at the Dominican\nRepublics, or Cuba, but even that door seemed to be closed because of their ages.\nAnd my father was making creams at that point and my mother, fortunately got a job\nand worked very hard. She fortunately met a physician through friends, I guess, or\nfamily, Canadian family, in Montreal, who was very interested in the fact that she\nwas able to do physiotherapy, which was not done a whole lot on this side of the\nocean. And she was very well trained and it was a period of the polio epidemic\nstarting. And also, she did post-operative -- broken legs and things like that, she\nworked with patients and so on. And she really had a lot of work. She -- she e --\nwell, in time she even -- we even got an apartment that had a basement in it, a\nJune 23, 2005\nfinished basement in which she gave classes, gym classes, and then the rest of the\napartment was rented out to different people -- different rooms. And she -- she did\nvery well and -- because my father couldn\u2019t work. But he was invited by Dr. Wilder\nPennfield and Dr. Cohen at the Neurological Institute in Montreal, which 1s a very\nwell known place, to come on rounds and to hone his skills and to get the English\nlingo. And he did that, and in time he met someone who asked him to become an\nintern in a hospital in the Maritime provinces of Canada, where the medical people\nleft in order to join the army. So a place became available where they really needed\nhis skills, and he -- he worked there until -- until someone said, why do you have\nthis enemy alien working for the Ca-Canadian government? And he went through a\nhorrible period of time in which his life was made miserable by the powers that be\nbecause he was -- they considered him as an enemy alien who -- whom they\nsuspected of being a farmer and a spy. He -- the Mounties came to visit him one day\nand he said, take the cameras, because they were afraid that he was photographing\ninstallations on the shore -- 0-0 -- the seacoast of New Brunswick, which was where\nhis job was. He went to New Brunswick to take on the job, my mother and I stayed\nin Montreal so that she could continue working. And as an intern, you know, it\u2019s\nhardly enough to support a family, so they -- we lived in separate places for awhile,\nfor a number of years. But he even weathered that, and I came across some of the\nJune 23, 2005\nclippings in the newspaper in getting ready to talk to you just the other day and I\ndidn\u2019t realize the splash that all this made in the newspapers across Canada, that,\nyou know, the government was employing enemy aliens to -- who were taking\nadvantage and taking the money from our people. So you come from Germany, you\ncome to Canada -- and of course, I was called a dirty Jew from Germany in school\nin Canada, where you know, the blinders were close to the head. And it was not an\neasy time in Canada. It was not.",
        "Q: So how did you handle this? Coming from Germany and hearing this in\nCanada?",
        "A: With great difficulty. With very, very great difficulty. But I did have Jewish\nfriends in class, and I must say, I found -- I found my friends among Jewish kids. All\n-- practically only Jewish children in Montreal. And we did not live in a Jewish\nsection of Montreal at all.",
        "Q: Were -- were these other refugee children, or these were Canadians?",
        "A: In -- they were can -- my friends were Canadian friends, but my mother\ncirculated with a group o-of refugees because in Montreal they were quite a number\nand yes, she had -- well, she also had non -- she also had Canadian friends, but many\nnot -- many Jewish friends who, like ourselves came over at one time or another.",
        "Q: What about the teachers in the school?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: The teachers in general were absolutely wonderful. I had never of -- I -- been so\nwell received, and the principal of the school was really -- they were trying so hard\nto make me comfortable, and they did. And I had a very -- I had a happy time in\nMontreal in school -- well, you know, you always have one teacher that\u2019s maybe\nnot so great. But I would say, generally speaking, they were wonderful. And in the\nMaritimes they could not have been nicer. They were very accepting. Na -- but\nnobody ever asked me about where I\u2019m from or why I\u2019m here. Nobody, even when I\nwent to college, nobody ever brought up the subject. And with a name like Fischer,\ny-ye -- and I had no accent, nobody even suspected. And it\u2019s interesting in these last\nfew years was the first time that my college friends and my high school friends, with\nwhom I\u2019m still in touch, some of whom I\u2019m still in touch, posed questions to me. I-I\nthink they were afraid. They didn\u2019t want to rub salt into wounds. I would have been\nvery happy to talk. I think I would have. In -- in college I would have, but nobody\never asked, and I wouldn\u2019t -- you know, I wouldn\u2019t speak on my own. In fact, ve\nnot spoken too much, although I have with my children, I\u2019ve told them a fair\namount. Not everything.",
        "Q: Your -- your father was in the Maritime provinces, you were in Montreal.",
        "A: Montreal.",
        "Q: Did you go back and forth to visit?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Well, no. In the summer, I was sent to camp and my mother went to visit my\nfather. It was just too expensive. I -- I went to Y camp, and one summer I stayed\nwith friends who invited me to stay with them while Mother visited my father. And\nthen other -- then I went to summer camp. One summer, the first summer, I think it\nwas the summer of \u201939 -- the summer of \u201939, my mother and father were engaged to\nbe camp doctor and nurse and I was allowed to go along as addition. And I was a\ncamper, and they were in charge of things and that gave us all a little vacation in the\nmountains.",
        "Q: Wa-Was this a Jewish camp?",
        "A: Yes, Camp Hiawatha. Yes, it was a Jewish camp and my mother met and was\nvery, very friendly with one of the counselors there, and it was a lifelong friendship\nthat continued til both of them really passed away. In fact, Sophie came and visited\nmy mother here when my mother was in the nine -- in her 90\u2019s. Sophie was a bit\nyounger. The Sophie that I mention is interesting because she\u2019s a poet -- was a poet,\nSophie Yellen, and was one of Canada\u2019s outstanding poets. And si -- the friendship\ncontinued and a wonderful one it was. All happened in Hiawatha.",
        "Q: Did you have, or did your parents have any correspondence or connection with\nthe people back in -- ya -- the family back in Germany\u201d\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a very interesting question, because yes, they tried to have and they\nhave letters to their mothers until the war broke out, which was only a year. And\nafter that, there was no more correspondence. But when my father knew that\nsomebody was going -- traveling from Montreal to the Maritime provinces, or from\nthe Maritime provinces back to Montreal, depending on where he was, he would\nalways ask them would they mail a letter in the one stop that the train made in the\nUnited States. And so yes, they got mail over to them, a-at least to let them know\nthat things were going well for us, even though the only -- they could only write to\nthe States, and then States would send us the mail. So that -- that was very di -- that\nwas traumatic.",
        "Q: Did you write to your grandparents?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know that I did. I don\u2019t know that I did. I don\u2019t think so. I think those little\nblue letters were very, very closely written upon and I think maybe I signed my\nname, but I don\u2019t re -- I don\u2019t recall writing to them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then as the war proceeded in the early, you know, early 40\u2019s, did\nyou as a child know what was happening? What was your world like during the war\nin Canada?",
        "A: My world was totally consumed with the war. My father used to keep a map on\nthe wall and punch pins into where the Germans were, and especially once the war\nJune 23, 2005\nstarted, how the movements of the Germans were taking place, how the forces were\nprogressing, both into the east zone towards Russia, as well as out to -- through\nFrance and into Holland. And we would listen to news every night, of course, and\nas many times during the day as, you know, as there were news on, which wasn\u2019t\nalways our time. I mean, the news came on at seven o\u2019clock and everybody was\nsitting around. And I think it was the most trying of times because my father was\ntrying to tell people in Canada what was happening and nobody listened. My father\nbrought out clippings from newspapers, German newspapers that he hid in slatted\nareas of his suitcases. He hid them in the linings of the suitcases, to show the powers\nthat be on this side of the ocean what was happening because nobody was listening\nand nobody wanted to believe what was going on. Fortunately, he did not get caught,\nbecause when he was called one time to the police station -- and he was called many\ntimes -- he was very afraid that they might have found something because he was\nclipping, he was clipping newspaper articles right and left.",
        "Q: Clipping from which papers?",
        "A: Newspa -- the German newspapers. He was taking sections out of newspapers to\nbring here to this side of the ocean --",
        "Q: I see.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: -- in order to tell people who were so unbelieving, of s -- things that were\nhappening that didn\u2019t make papers here, and people weren\u2019t willing to listen. You\nknow, when you read what Steven Wise couldn\u2019t even get through. Nobody\nlistened, nobody. And nobody wanted to. They didn\u2019t want to believe. So you asked\n-- | was -- I was totally consumed with the war. I would come in from school and\nlisten. I listened. It was almost a way of life, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "Q: Were -- were your fam -- was your family aware of what was happening to the\nJews specifically during the war?",
        "A: Oh, oh absolutely. Not -- well, they saw the beginnings of it all when people\ndisappeared and people just didn\u2019t make it back from the police stations or they were\nsnatched out of their beds. I mean, that was happening all around. And it was 1938.\nThings were not at all tranquil, even -- even in Silesia. I think there was much fear,\nthere was much fear and there was the constant hope that we could bring the mothers\nout.",

        "A: Well, I think we probably learned about it through the radio, a-and of course\nknew at once that if synagogues were the targets, ours, both in Ratibor and in\nBreslau were undoubtedly part of the picture, and indeed they were. I don\u2019t know\nthat we knew the particulars, but I do know that my father said, and they didn\u2019t burn\npart of that synagogue because there were stores around the synagogue that were in\nhands of Germans, close to the wall around or near the synagogue. So part of the\nbuilding was destroyed, and part of 1t was not. But the [indecipherable] synagogue,\nwhich 1s the one that my parents and grandparent went 1n -- we-were in -- were\nmembers of and where my grandparents had pews, strangely enough next to each\nother, we know that that -- we knew that that synagogue was badly damaged in part.\nAnd the pictures have borne that out. They\u2019re in the process of restoring that\nsynagogue at this point in time, but what I learned -- what we learned, and of course\nto the horror of everyone, oh we -- we learned through the radio and then also I\nJune 23, 2005\nbelieve there must have been notification by mail as to what -- what was damaged.\nInterestingly enough, I think that my father and his mother probably had sort of an\nunderstanding of what was going to be said in a -- in a code sort of way, as to the\nsituation.",
        "Q: This was a code between the two of them so you wouldn\u2019t understand?",
        "A: No, so that -- so -- all the letters were censored at that point and they did not want\nthe censors to be aware. And I know that certain people\u2019s names were mentioned,\nand never with a surname, and maybe with Uncle John did such and such, and you\nkind of knew what was going on and I do remember the last letter that my\ngrandmother wrote. She wrote that she needed some tea, would we be able to send\nher some tea, and that was the last -- that was the last letter that we ever received\nfrom her. And in all the letters, 1t was a little bit upbeat, in I am very well, but -- or --\nor Iam very well, and then period, and then could you possibly send me some tea.\nAnd we knew that that was a very bad sign. About Kristallnacht itself, other than\nhearing it, and of course my parents just speechless with the news that was coming\nin, I still see us sitting around the radio, the whole family and really despairing.",
        "Q: You must have been a very old nine year old by that time.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: My mother always said -- she said -- of herself, she said, I had a childhood, you\nnever had a childhood. And I think it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think I ever did. And what can I\nsay? I didn\u2019t have a childhood.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Any other experiences you can remember about during the wartime\nwhile you were in Canada? I mean, you said your father followed the progress of\nthe war with the pins.",
        "A: Well, in our Canadian schools, a lot of English guest children came over and so\nwe had many guest children in our classes. People who opted to send their kids\noverseas until the end of the war. And I had a very, very dear friend, Monya\nWilliams was her name and we stayed in touch for awhile after she went back home.\nAnd life in Canada, as life was here was -- had rationing, we had a lot of rationing. I\nthink you probably had more rationing than we did, but it was as my mother always\nused to say, this isn\u2019t rationing. She went through the first World War, and she said\nthis was just equalizing things out. It was, you know, very, very little rationing per\nse. Nobody ever went hungry. And during the war -- a-as a child during the war I\nrolled bandages. I went down to Red Cross headquarters on Saturdays and I helped\nserved coffee. My mother also w-worked for the Red Cross at the -- at the blood\ndonating centers. I work -- I -- I helped when we had service personnel come to the\nJewish u -- like a USO. We went and we washed dishes and we served sandwiches\nJune 23, 2005\nto the young soldiers who were coming through. And this was a little bit later on,\nthis was when the soldiers were coming through the Maritime provinces to get on\nthe ships to send them overseas. The Jewish lads had a place to come to to dance and\nto write letters and just to have a good time, and we teenagers were allowed to help\nand that was always -- that was very nice. I had a job very early on. I tried to get a\njob in Montreal painting signs, but they thought maybe 11 was too young to get a jo\n-- to give anybody a job. But I used to sometimes walk to Sunday school -- to\nHebrew school. I did go to Hebrew school in Montreal, we went to Shaar\nHashomayim, which is a very beautiful, large synagogue and I had Hebrew twice a\nweek and I had Sunday school, but most of the time I either walked, or more than\nlikely I took the tram, 1f I wasn\u2019t lucky enough to get a ride in the Bronsman car.\nNow, the Bronsman kids, Charlie and Edgar were classmates of mine at Shaar\nHashomayim, and they had a -- a driver who drove them back and forth from class\nto Hebrew school, and once in awhile we got rides with them, and that was very nice\nbecause they had chocolate milk on the cars and the rest of us usually just got white\nmilk. And my mother, as a matter of fact, in her -- in her physiotherapy capacity\nmassaged -- gave massages to Mrs. Bronsman. And I remember very well in\nMontreal my mother did the Bronsman job, I guess once a week and she would\nhave to walk, because of course she didn\u2019t have a car and the streetcar or the bus\nJune 23, 2005\nwould only carry her so far, and she would have to walk up Westmount. Now mind\nyou, the Bronsmans lived up on the very top of the hill and there certainly wasn\u2019t a\n-- a bus going up there. And so she marched in the cold of winter. And Montreal\ncan be very icy in wintertime and she got such chilblains, and I remember she came\nhome, her legs were just so cold. I remember weeping and thinking how she was\nsuffering. And I asked her about it a number of years back and I said, Mother, I used\nto cry so, because I was so unhappy that you had such hard work. And she said oh,\nshe said, you know, I look back on this and she said it was such a good time. It was\nthe only time in my life, when we lived in Montreal, where I was an independent\nwoman and where I carried the family on my shoulders, and she said that was very\nsatisfying. I go -- I -- I\u2019ve mulled that over many, many times, and indeed it was.\nShe did wonderful work in -- in her capacity as therapist.",
        "Q: So, did you experience any anti-Semitism during the war years in Canada?",
        "A: I would say, other than being called names in school every now and again, dirty\nJew from Germany --",
        "Q: Oh, right.",
        "A: -- I would say those were really very few times.",
        "Q: Ho-How would you respond when that happened?",
        "A: I think I just walked away from it. I don\u2019t think that I could respond to it. I would\nJune 23, 2005\nthink I could not. I still recall exactly where these encounters took place, and they\nwere not in sight of the teachers, they were when we were having recess, either\nplaying marbles, or downstairs. On very cold days we were -- we were just mulling\naround and sitting on the benches and so on for -- for a little time out. And it wasn\u2019t\nthe boys as much as the girls that were nasty. But maybe girls are nastier to each\nother anyway.",
        "Q: Did you tell your parents about these incidents?",
        "A: Probably not. I don\u2019t know. Probably not, I think -- I think I just did not want\nthem to worry about things more than they did. They had -- they had so many\nworries on their shoulders. My father, who couldn\u2019t work and who wanted so much\nto work. And y -- no -- you know, no money coming in. My mother, who worked so\nhard, and nothing in the offing for my father and that must have been, to the kind of\nperson that he was, a tremendous blow. And -- however, he had a fantastic sense of\nhumor all -- all his life, and I think maybe it even helped him then when things\nlooked so bleak. And I think the frustration that he carried within him, having so\nmuch information, wanting to tell people -- he even was in touch with a writer from\nthe newspaper who was the son of somebody who knew somebody, you know,\ncloser, and not just the man on the street. And nobody wanting to believe. I think\nthat must have been so frustrating.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you feel German at that point? Canadian, Jewish? How would you\ndescribe yourself during the war years in Canada?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t feel Canadian, certainly not. Everything was very strange to me. I\ndidn\u2019t feel German. I guess I felt Jewish. And maybe not by choice, but I was made\nto feel Jewish. Not that, you know, not that I wouldn\u2019t say I was Jewish, but I think\nyes, I think I was made to feel Jewish. I remember a sad thing. I was walking in\nfront of a shop one day, looking at some baked goods in the bakery store, Id --\nwould feast my eyes on all these good, good things. And there was my father, I\ndidn\u2019t realize that he was in back of me, looking at me -- so he tells me, and I\u2019m sure\nit\u2019s true -- with not enough change in his pocket to buy me the little roll that I\nwanted, that I would have liked to have had. It -- I think, you know, these are such\nsmall things in the scheme of things, but such humiliating and -- and depressing\nreactions. I mean, I think of it often. I\u2019m sure he never thought of it that much any\nmore after the fact. He was a realist, 1t couldn\u2019t happen at that point. I, on the other\nhand, internalized the whole thing. And -- yeah.",
        "Q: And so you made -- you continued to make friends though, when -- y-you were\ntalking about during those times?",
        "A: Yes, I had -- I made friends, I had no trouble making friends. Made good friends.\nAnd then, of course, I was in Montreal only fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh -- four years\nJune 23, 2005\nin Montreal and then we moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where my father\ngot the job as an intern, but we were not able to join him until the four years were\nover and h-he was able to get an apartment and get enough money to support us,\nbecause my mother did not work after we came to Saint John.",
        "Q: And then how long did you stay there?",
        "A: And we stayed in Saint John -- well, I was married in Saint John. So I think my\nparents moved in 1955. My father got his citizenship in 1945 or \u201946, and then took\nhis Dominion Council exams and passed his exams so that he could go into practice,\nwhich he did, and then he be -- he became a diabetic and had some physical\nproblems and so it was thought that he should give up private practice and go into a\nhospital situation, which he did in Halifax, Nova Scotia. And it was a psychiatric\nhospital there, and he was in charge of all the woman patients, I think, at that\nhospital. And he stayed there until he retired and he was -- that was \u201978, I guess. So\nhe was there quite a number of years and they made a very happy life in Halifax.\nSaint John was a very small town, little in-bred. I mean, it was very small in every\nway. And moving to Halifax was really a nice thing for them to do because first of\nall it was a beautiful city and then it had the stimulation of having a university there.\nTwo, as a matter -- three -- three universities, with a lot of cultural things going in,\nwhich they loved. And they got a house on the Dartmouth side of the -- of the city\nJune 23, 2005\nand then they joined us. When my father -- when my father retired, he wanted to\nmove Mom and himself down to Knoxville, which they did. They came and they\njoined us in Knoxville and were there a couple of years when my husband was\ncalled by the NIH to come and work here and to head the department of blood\ndiseases. And so my parents said, well we\u2019d like to go back to Halifax. With heavy\nheart. They -- they did not want to come to the Washington area. So they moved\nback to Halifax and had many more good years in Halifax until my father died and\nthen my mother did indeed come to visit -- I mean, come to stay with us, and that\nwas good.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back a little bit in time, to the end of the war. What was it like for you\nwhen the war was over?",
        "A: Oh, it was the most freeing, wonderful experience. I remember being in camp,\nand my father sending me information about the victory, and all hell broke loose in\ncamp. This was Canadian camp, you know? And it was such a freeing -- it was like\ntearing away ropes that bound one\u2019s chest, really. And of course, with it came the\nrealization that even though the war was over, there were so many gone. I\nremember, for example, in the middle of one night when my mother woke us all up\nscreaming. And this was in the 40\u2019s, the early 40\u2019s. And to this day she thinks that\nwas the day that her mother was killed. And -- and probably it was. Probably it was.\nJune 23, 2005\nBut the fact that the war was over was -- at least the European part of the war was\nover. This was not yet the end because -- but Canadian forces were not in the\nPacific. So in a way, for us that war was over.",
        "Q: During the war, during the latter parts of the war, did your family know anything\nabout the camps, or did that come out only later for them?",
        "A: You know, I had the feeling that they did know about the camps because there\nwere some camps that were already in existence when we were in Germany.\nMauthausen for one, and Dachau. So, I think they were very well aware of what\nwas going on, and I don\u2019t know, but they kept in very close touch with friends who\nhad also emigrated, and when one got, you know, word about anything, that they\nwould share with the adults, not the -- not the children. And as I say, for many years\nmy father tried so desperately to get the grandmothers out, and would go to the\nStates in order to do some of his work. I mean, up to Ottawa, down here to this\narea. But there was -- there was no way.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So the war is over, did the camp celebrate at all, or did you celebrate in\nany specific way? Was it a Jewish camp?",
        "A: No. No, I don\u2019t think there was a celebration. I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: And you were 16 then?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Yeah. Ah --",
        "Q: In 1945.",
        "A: Yeah, I w -- yeah, right.",
        "Q: And then what happened, just generally with your life, from 16 on?",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you a wonderful thing that happened. After all -- after the war was\nover, my parents wanted to adopt a child from a DP camp. And indeed they did. Our\ndarling Saul came to us -- my father had wanted to have a son, a boy come. He\ndidn\u2019t have a boy of his own, I think, and he probably thought it was best not to have\nanother girl. So arrangements were made through the Canadian -- mm, I can\u2019t think\nof the organization, but it was a refugee organization, and in time Saul arrived with\na number of other children who were brought to Canada, for whom homes were\nfound, and he came to live with us. And he came, I was away in college already and\nwhen I came home from college, here was this new addition to the family. Well, as it\nturned out, he was with us for awhile, and when he gain -- when he realized the kind\nof person Mom and Dad were, he said, you know, I really have a mother, but I was\nafraid -- a -- a blood mother who survived -- and -- but I want -- I needed to get -- I\nwanted to get out and the only way to get out was to declare myself as an orphan,\nwhich 1s how he got into Canada, and --",
        "Q: How old was he and where was he from?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: He was from Poland, I re -- I don\u2019t know the name of the town. I think I can look\nit up, but I don\u2019t know the name of the town. And his mother and one sister\nsurvived. The rest of his family, his father and his other brothers and sisters did not,\nbut these two survived. And of course as soon as my father heard that there was\nblood kin, he did his level best to get them out and -- and did. And, as a matter of\nfact, next week I am going to Los Angeles to be present at the Bar Mitzvah of his\ngrandson. And we have kept in close touch. Saul stayed with my family for a\nnumber of years, went to high school in Saint John, stayed with Mom and Dad and\nthen decided he would like to go to Montreal where there were more Jewish kids.\nAnd he became a typesetter and type -- was able to do typesetting in English and\nFren-French and in Yiddish. And then got a job in Los Angeles and took his mother\nand sister to Los Angeles, and that\u2019s where he is today. He married a girl from\nPoland, from his village, and as I say, we\u2019re going to see them next week. They\nhave come to all our simchas, we have tried to be at theirs. And it\u2019s a very happy\nand wonderful relationship. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a different sort 0 -- probably not like a kin --\nan -- a blood kin relationship, but it\u2019s a wonderful relationship. And there isn\u2019t a\nweek that goes by that we don\u2019t talk. And he\u2019s a lot of health issues with his wife\nover the last six months and I think I talked to him every other day. And --",
        "Q: HoHo-w old was he when he came to your family?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: 16. He was a little younger than -- no, he was 14, he was 14, yeah. And it -- it\nwas something that I know my mom and dad wanted to do it and you know, you\nnever know how things work out, but I think this worked out very well.",
        "Q: What was his last name -- what is his last name?",
        "A: Saul S-Silvershein -- Silvershein, but he changed it to Saul Silver.",
        "Q: Yeah. So you finished high school, you went on to college, where did you go to\ncollege?",
        "A: I went to college in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Dalhousie University and I studied\nchemistry. Not by choice, I wanted to go to art school, but my parents wouldn\u2019t let\nme go to art school, I had to do something practical with which I could earn my keep\nand preferably not something that required a change of language. And being the\ngood daughter that I was, I did not fight the thing, this was ordained, my father had\nsaid so, and I did it. I went to college, I did well in school, and ended up going to\ngraduate school at the University of Chicago in microbiology, for which the\nprovince paid. Then I -- but then I met my husband and that\u2019s the tale. I met my\nhusband while I was at the University of Chicago, at international house. I w -- I, as\nan international student and he as a good representative of American-hood. He was\nin a residency at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago. And it was love at first sight\nand we got married in 1953 in Saint John, New Brunswick, my parents were still\nJune 23, 2005\nliving in Saint John, and we moved to Saint Louis, where he finished his residency\nand our first child was born in Saint Louis, David. And then we moved to Durham,\nNorth Carolina where he was at Duke and Susan was born. And then we moved to\nKnoxville, Tennessee, where he headed a research unit of the University of\nTennessee and Judy was born, and then we didn\u2019t move any more, until we moved\nhere. It was too late then.",
        "Q: Whe-When did you move to the Washington area?",
        "A: About 20 years ago, which would have been -- well, 25 almost, 1980.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: 1980. And our kids went on to make good lives for themselves. David 1s at\nCornell, he\u2019s a professor at Cornell. Our daughter Susan is an attorney in Chicago\nwith two children, and Judy, who is a physician, lives in Laurel and she has two\nchildren. So we are so blessed with four grandchildren, and good kids all the way\naround.",
        "Q: Di-Did you say earlier that you had gone back to Germany? Can you tell me\nabout that?",
        "A: Last year, plans were made to take the children, our three children to Germany.\nWe had plans ready in action, and unfortunately I got sick. Now, whether this was a\nreturn of the paralysis, I don\u2019t know, but I really did get ill, and it was advised that I\nJune 23, 2005\nnot go. It was a cardiac thing and it was deemed not -- not good to take any long\ntrips, so --",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: -- we did not go. I have not been back, not ever been back. I shouldn\u2019t say that. I\nwent -- that\u2019s to my hometown -- hometowns. I did go back. Amos had to deliver a\nlecture in Berlin and I had an old aunt who survived the war. A non-Jewish wife of a\nbrother of my grandfather\u2019s who survived the war in Berlin, and we -- since Amos\nwent to gi -- talk there, I wanted to see her because she really was a favorite of the\nfamily. And she did survive and we did see her and we had a wonderful visit. So yes,\nI\u2019ve been back to Berlin, but only to see her and I saw nothing of Berlin, I just saw\nher.",
        "Q: That was purposeful, not to see anything of Berlin?",
        "A: I think so. I think so. I really -- I wa -- I don\u2019t think I was up to it, really, but I did\nwant to see her because she was a very --",
        "Q: What year was this? How long ago?",
        "A: It must have been in the 70\u2019s.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nJune 23, 2005\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection with Renate Chernoff. This is tape number four, side A. Let\u2019s\nnow talk about some of your thoughts and feelings about what you went through.\nYou said before that your mother had said you really didn\u2019t have a childhood. Do\nyou agree with her?",
        "A: I do. And I'll tell you, to this day, though I have a large circle of friends, I am still\nan outsider. I still feel myself as removed from others. Not that there -- not that I\ndon\u2019t have friends, I have plenty of friends, but I\u2019m still the one who\u2019s looking in.\nAnd some days I find this rather discouraging. I think -- I think that in my artwork, a\nlot of it has dealt with Holocaust and Holocaust issues, and even there I feel as\nthough there is a layer between me, my work -- me and my -- and friends, and I\ndon\u2019t know how else to explain it.",
        "Q: Do you feel in a sense that you are like -- you are two people, one person on the\ninside and one person on the outside?",
        "A: I guess so, because most people think I\u2019m rather a jolly person, that I am full of\nfun and games and beans. And I can be that person, but I -- I\u2019m not that person. I\u2019m\nreally reserved and I am withdrawn at times. I get very easily depressed, and I have\nkept a journal of some of my thoughts, not -- not often, but there are times. I have\nJune 23, 2005\ninsomnia. And I have the dreadful need -- and I say dreadful because I dread it, I\nguess, I have to read every scrap of Holocaust literature I can put my hands on.\nWhether I can find an adequate answer to something, or when I look at broadcasts\non the television, I\u2019m looking for those people that are no longer in my life. I look\nfor my grandmothers everywhere and I keep saying sometime I\u2019m going to see them\nagain. And I busy myself in -- in a quiet way, with many of the questions of the\nHolocaust. And I\u2019ve tried to read not only people who -- work of people who have\ngone through it, but of authorities who have written about it, and studies that have\nbeen -- psychological studies that have been done. I guess I\u2019m trying to answer, who\nam I. And -- and it all has made me what I am today, I guess, but I\u2019d like to know,\nyou know, why. I often say oh, if life had been different and if I had -- if this had\nhappened and if that had happened. But everybody says that. You don\u2019t have to be in\n-- in ma -- in my shoes or anybody else\u2019s shoes, everybody asks that. But I\nsometimes think my life would have been so different if times had been -- in th --\nhad run in a normal way and I had grown up in Germany and gone to school in\nGermany. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been as interesting at this point in time, but it\nwould have been very different.",
        "Q: You had said that you went back to Germany and visited your aunt, but that\u2019s all\nyou did. Why did you not see more of Germany?\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Well, for one thing we only had a few days in Berlin, being practical about this.\nAmos was asked to give a lecture and we went and we came back. I think I wasn\u2019t\nready to go back and I don\u2019t believe it was easy to get to Breslau at that point in\ntime. Berlin was open, Breslau o -- I don\u2019t think was a tourist place -- tourist -- not\nthat 1t needed to be a tourist place, but I don\u2019t think it was a place that wa -- I -- I --\nwe di -- we didn\u2019t do it. I -- I -- I wish I -- I wish I could tell you more, but we\ndidn\u2019t, and it was a ma -- it was really a factor of time, and of fear, and of fear. You\nknow, you want to go back and you don\u2019t want to go back. We\u2019ve gone back to\nplaces where we had visited. We lived in Thailand for awhile and went back 30\nyears later and were so sorry as to what had happened to the country. I like to\nremember it the way it was 30 years ago. Now, everything that I remember -- not\neverything, but things that I remember in the -- in Germany at the countryside, and\nmeadows and -- and the beautiful winters and so on, they\u2019re still there. The h -- th-\nthe houses and the buildings in my mind are still the ones that are there, they\u2019re not\nthere any more. That area was terribly shot up, particularly the Russians took their\nguns to that area. And I don\u2019t -- perhaps didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t want to know what\nhad really happened. Although some of my friends have gone back. My friend in\nIsrael has gone back several times. But, interestingly enough, she 1s a year older\nthan I am and couldn\u2019t remember a thing. And yet, I\u2019m the visually one -- visually\nJune 23, 2005\nactive one, and I can remember it and I -- no. But I -- I think I\u2019m ready to go back\nnow. I would like to be well and go next year, and we\u2019re talking about it.",
        "Q: What was it like though, when you put your foot down on German soil again,\nwhen you went back?",
        "A: I did not like it and I did not tell anybody that I could understand what they were\nsaying, because I could. I did not speak German, I spoke only in English. And it\u2019s\nvery interesting when a German talks German to me, I question in my mind, where\nwere you and where was your family? Take an example. My next door neighbor a\nfew years ago was a couple. He was from Germany, he was a writer for the\nFrankfurter Allgemeine, wonderful German, conservative German newspaper, a\ngood newspaper, though. He was married to a Spanish gal and they lived next door\nand it took me at least half a year before I could be comfortable with him. They had\nsince become perhaps our closest friends and neighbors. They -- you know, if\nanybody could make me feel that maybe the younger generation today 1s different,\nhe was the one. I am still in touch with them, they have moved back to -- well, at this\npoint to Spain. He still is writing for the Frankfurter Allgemeine. I watched their\ndaughter grow up, I babysat with the daughter. I have a little plant here that\u2019s my\nlittle Laura plant because she gave it to me. They are -- he is such a dear person and\nhe has -- the one who has sent me books on Ratibor and Breslau and tried to make\nJune 23, 2005\ncontacts for me to make it easy for me to go back if I wanted to go back. The dearest\npeople in this world. And I hope -- I hope that the young people today are like him\nbecause he\u2019s an incredible person, maybe one of our best friends. So --",
        "Q: Did you tell him about your experiences?",
        "A: Oh yes. He asked and I told him, and he was also -- he was the first writer who\nwrote anything about the memorial -- the memorials, the Holocaust memorials in\nFlorida. He was -- and he had an interview, one of the very few interviews that were\ngiven by the chap who headed the memorial -- the Holocaust Memorial Center.\nNow, he was the one from Israel -- was there one --",
        "Q: Weinberg, Shaika Weinberg\u2019?",
        "A: Yes. He had one of the few interviews and had a two hour interview with him and\nwas amazed and thrilled to have it. He was often a visitor over there. He was an un --\nhe\u2019s an unusual person, to say the least.",
        "Q: Are there any sights or sounds, smells, or anything that bring back the experience\nthat you had?",
        "A: Mm. Well, the sight of boots, leather boots, black leather boots. Not suede boots,\nbut black -- shiny, black leather boots, and the rhythm of the -- of this -- 0 -- th-the\nmarching rhythm really, really bothers me very much. Now, on the other hand, I can\nlisten to Wagner music and be absolutely thrilled by it and where\u2019s the logic there?\nJune 23, 2005\nThere is no such thing as logic. Smells, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at all aware of. And did --\ndid you say sights?",

        "A: I count in German, I do my sums in German. I\u2019m not very good at using a little\nmachine, so I -- I do all my math in German. I read German, I -- I would say I\u2019m\nfluent in every day German. I read slowly, stuff that\u2019s a little bit more complicated,\nbecause after all, I kind of stopped talking German when I came to Canada and my\nparents wanted to improve their English, so of course I had spoke English to my\nparents. But -- but I did speak German, and -- when I went home, Mother and I\nalways did try to keep it up at least a little. But I feel comfortable speaking German\nma -- if I know who I\u2019m talking to. Otherwise I don\u2019t open my mouth and let on.",

        "A: I don\u2019t like to think -- I don\u2019t li -- th-there is a sound in the German language\nwhen I sometime hear people speak, that rarely there is a brashness about the\nlanguage that bothers me. If I know that they are German Germans, I-I just -- I don\u2019t\nreact. I can listen and know exactly what they\u2019re talking about. But there 1s a\nmanner, there is a brusqueness ab -- the German tongue in some -- some people that\nI find a little difficult to take.",
        "Q: When your -- when your children were the ages -- the age that you were, seven,\neight, nine, when you were going through those difficult times in Europe, did that\nbring back th -- your childhood experiences even more vividly?",
        "A: I guess I was -- I was a tougher mother probably, than I needed to be. I was\nprobably a more careful mother, in many respects a stricter mother. My children tells\n-- tell me that I was fairly strict. But I guess the -- the inclination is to -- to now let\nanything happen, to be careful, to not see them hurt, as I was. They had very good\nrapport with each other and with their cohorts and I think they had very happy\nchildhood and very often I was just peeking in. I\u2019m not sure I answered your\nquestion very well. Pose it to me again, please.",
        "Q: I -- I was just thinking, when your children were the same age, when they were\nseven, eight and nine, when you were going through these difficult times in Europe,\nJune 23, 2005\ndid you look at them and did it make you think of your age -- what you went through\nat that time? When --",
        "A: Yes, I think particularly with the -- with the two girls. Not so much with my son.\nI could identify less with him, of course. But yes, I -- I guess I -- I did, I -- I did think\n-- | did think so often how fortunate, how fortunate they were to be born in this\ncountry and to live in this wonderful, wonderful country, of which I became a\ncitizen, not too long ago. I did not -- I was a Canadian citizen for a long period of\ntime and then when I started to critique the government, I was told I better take out\ncitizenship. You cannot criticize -- well, the story was ma -- my husband needed Q\nclearance for his work, and so ah -- I -- I did take out my citizenship and it was a\nvery formal thing in Knoxville, Tennessee in the old-fashioned way and it was\nwonderful. It was a day to remember. And my children were there and they were just\nsorry I couldn\u2019t become the president of the United States, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Did you tell your children as they were growing up, about your background?",
        "A: You know, it -- it\u2019s interesting, I did and I didn\u2019t. I think I -- I was hesitant until\nthey asked questions and then when they asked questions I tried to answer as\ntruthfully as I could. On the other hand they, like I, did not want to rub, you know,\nsalt into any wounds. They did not want to put me into a situation that would make it\nhard on me, as I did to my mother, because I did not want to hurt her. I -- I did share\nJune 23, 2005\nwith them, especially the school experiences. I di -- I shielded them, I think, a great\ndeal as to what happened to the grandmothers. I just -- I couldn\u2019t talk about it and\nobviously they couldn\u2019t either. But we watched together many offerings on\ntelevision which prompted questioning, and I was tra -- I tried to answer as best I\ncould, what I thought was appropriate for their ages. So in a way I did share. But I\nthink -- I think now -- I think now that more is being written and more is known.\nThe children today -- I mean, my -- my grown children today feel freer to ask me\nand I am able to answer them, perhaps a little bit better than before. And even my\ngrandchildren have asked me questions and I\u2019m very willing to answer. And my\ngrandchildren range in age from 13 to 17. So I have a good range there, and they --\nthe thi -- the youngest one, who has just turned 13, is the only one who has not yet\nbeen really exposed to things. But were he to ask, I would certainly be able to -- to\nanswer, I think.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through and your family had to go through and\npay the price that it did and people living in this country didn\u2019t have to?",
        "A: Sometimes. But you know, on the other hand, I am so grateful that things turned\nout relatively well for our family. And they did. I sometimes am very angry that the\nworld didn\u2019t respond. On the other hand, we were so lucky and I feel so blessed that\nI have come -- I\u2019m much less angry now than I was at one time, and I think that in\nJune 23, 2005\nmy early adult years, I was very angry. But I think, as I\u2019m getting older I\u2019m -- \u2019'm\nseeing it perhaps more in perspective. And I think the -- who in the world would\nhave known, or would have believed what was happening? I mean, the whole thing\nis So in-inconceivable. That\u2019s why I think I -- I-I -- Iam much more aware and --\nand worried about places like Darfur, because again the world is silent. But not\nquite as silent as they were then because we were inoculated at that point with a --\nwith a virus, if you will. So I cannot -- you know, I -- I\u2019m far less angry now than I\nwas.",
        "Q: Were you involved in any way in the civil rights movement because you came\nfrom a country that deprived many people of their civil rights, did you respond to\nthat?",
        "A: I was very involved in the civil rights movement. We lived in Knoxville,\nTennessee and we lived there during the marches, and we lived there during the sit-\nins and we lived there during the non-mixing of the races, and I was very involved. I\ntook part in sit-ins in the south when it wasn\u2019t exactly a picnic to do that. And I was\none of the very, very few white people who became a counselor at a black -- a mixed\n-- well, it was not mixed, it was a black camp, and I was maybe one of the few white\npeople who, during those times went and taught at a camp when I was thr -- we were\nthreatened. The camp was threatened because it had some black and whites together.\nJune 23, 2005\nBut I felt strongly enough -- in fact, I felt so strongly about going to that camp, my\nlittle Judy was 18 months old and I took her in her stroller to that camp. I felt that if\n-- you know, maybe we didn\u2019t have the money with which to -- to -- to give large\ndonations, I felt my place was to do the right thing, and so I -- it was very close to\nthat movement and we always had friends who were -- black friends who came to\nour house and with whom we, you know, worked together. My husband was the first\none who gave a black person a job at the University of Tennessee Memorial\nResearch Center. Yes, we were very involved, always have been.",
        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s because of your history?",
        "A: I think so. It\u2019s also because we\u2019re Jewish. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s our religion, and we\nhave to live it. And that was one way of doing it.",
        "Q: Which was going to be my next question about what your thoughts are about\nbeing Jewish, after all your family suffered because -- and you did too, because you\nwere Jewish, I was just wondering what your thoughts on that subject was.",
        "A: More Jewish than ever. Not necessarily in the religious sense, but in the way of\nlife sense of doing the right thing and supporting the right causes. And helping\nwhere help is needed and living the exemplary life that our religion teaches us to\nlive. And you know, whether I go to sh -- s -- Shabbat services every Saturday,\nthat\u2019s not my thing. I go, I do gis -- I -- I go to Yizker services and I go to the high\n101\nJune 23, 2005\nholiday services, and I do go to Sabbath services. But to me it\u2019s the -- it\u2019s the every\nday life. And I -- I hope I have instilled that in my children, because one of my\nchildren worked for the brown lung situation, has worked in the mountains of\nAppalachia, doing good work. And they\u2019ve taken synagogue activities very\nseriously, but not the -- maybe not the little things, but in helping the homeless and\nthat sort of a thing, so I think they\u2019re instilled hopefully with -- with that -- those\nthoughts in mind. Am I more religious? Well, it depends what you call religious. I li\n-- I live my life in the best way I know how to. I serve on the Hevre Kadisha at my\nsynagogue. I did a lot of volunteer work when I was younger. I taught Sunday\nschool, all that good stuff. Going to synagogue, depends. I like to think that\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: So being discriminated because you were Jewish, and losing relatives who were\nclose to you because you were Jewish has not negated any of your feelings about it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. I would say it may have\nreinforced the doing of the right thing at all times and be it in very simple and easy\nways of doing the right thing or -- or making more difficult decisions. It has not\nnegated it. I know many people left their religions on the other side of the ocean\nwhen they came over. I was not one of those.",

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Renate Chernoff. Tell me a little bit about your\nartwork. What media do you work in, and what subjects? You had mentioned the\nHolocaust before, and so if you could expand on that?",
        "A: Well, I -- I was a frustrated art student when I was studying microbiology and\nreally all my life wanted to go to art school. Wasn\u2019t allowed to because of other\nJune 23, 2005\nmatters. However, finally, after my children stayed in school til 3:30 in the\nafternoon, my husband urged me to do what I\u2019ve always wanted to do and that was\nto go to art school, which I did. I went to school at the University of Tennessee in\nKnoxville. And first I -- he had had a -- a second heart attack at that point in our\nstory and I again thought well, I should go back to school and learn to do something\nthat would prepare me to earn a living, God forbid, and thought I would study art\neducation. However, after the second class of art education I decided that was not for\nme under any circumstances. Perhaps I should try the art school. And he wanted\nvery much to have me do that and so I did go to art school and I studied\nmetalworking. And I -- I learned how to s -- do metalsmithing, metalcasting and all\naspects of the metal as an a -- as a tool, and taking a Master\u2019s degree in Fine Arts at\nthe university. And worked in metals and also had to choose a second part and that\nwas fibers, and so I took metals and fibers both, and then interesting situation arrived\nin the sense that after two years I was told -- and I was working part time because I\nstill had the carpools and the kids and 18 puppies and all that sort of thing -- I was\ntold I had to choose a thesis project. And so I decided I would write a thesis on the\nhistory of the ceremonial objects pertaining to the Torah and make contemporary\npieces based on the research of the history of each of these as implements on their\nown. And that\u2019s what I did. So I made breastplates and I made [indecipherable]\n105\nJune 23, 2005\npointers, and I proposed the [indecipherable] and I made the covering for the\nTorahs and I made mezuzahs and all sorts of other things along the side, learning\nthe technique. But I wanted to do something that was a bit cerebral as well as doing -\n- creating something new, and so that I did. And I wrote a thesis, a thick book, which\n-- the work of which I enjoyed tremendously, both doing the library re-research,\nwhich was a little difficult from Knoxville, Tennessee, but the university got me all\nkinds of books that I needed to and I was able to do that and in my graduate show I\nshowed my pieces, and it was accepted and I was a happy camper. I graduated in\n1973 with all my dear ones around me. Cap and gown and the whole thing, and\nDavid graduated from high school. So we had a gala celebration together. And then\nwe left Knoxville and I had -- I had the use of the university lab to do my work in\nand then we came to Knoxville and I no longer had a lab to work in and so I decided\nperhaps it was time to switch from doing metalwork, which required gas, which I\nfind very hard to -- to keep in my house, which psychologically was very difficult\nfor me to have a gas tank in my house.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Because of -- because of memories or thoughts about gas. I decided I would go\nahead and carry on with weaving, which I loved, and I did tapestry weaving on -- I\nhave a loom and I used the loom for various tapestry projects. But all along I still\nJune 23, 2005\nloved my metal. And so, in the I-last number of years I\u2019ve combined the two and I\nweave metal on my loom. And it\u2019s wire that I use, and I use stainless steel wire and\ncopper wire and brass wire and I weave it on my loom and I do sculptural pieces.\nMany of them are Judaic. I take really my inspiration from the jew -- things Judaic.\nAnd of course, I have concentrated both on the liturgy -- I\u2019ve done a series on the\nHigh Holy Day prayers, but I\u2019ve also done Holocaust series and I did one particular\nsix piece Holocaust -- progression of thoughts on the Holocaust from the earliest\ndays to the final days. And so -- and also my metal, my woven metal -- metal pieces\nare [indecipherable] boxes and things that could -- that could be used 1n worship or\nin home worship at least. I made mis -- mizrahs and the -- various other implements\nwhere I can use the wos -- woven fi -- the woven fabric made out of metal. And the\ncombination of the technique of the loom plus the material of the metalsmith has\ngiven me a great deal of satisfaction, and I still continue working, very much\ninfluenced by my Judaic background, and very happy doing what I\u2019m doing.",
        "Q: Can you describe your -- your six panel work that you did relating to the\nHolocaust in a little more detail?",
        "A: Okay. I called it \u201cNever Again\u201d and it is really a -- a group. It\u2019s made up of six\nindividual pieces and you\u2019ll see a lot of symbolism in this, o-of course. It -- it\u2019s a\nprogression of the events that occurred from the beginnings, relating increasingly to\nJune 23, 2005\nthe restrictive things, of the ims -- restrictive laws of the Nazi regime in the 30\u2019s.\nThe second panel details Kristallnacht using my synagogue as a -- part of the\nsynagogue as my emphasis. The third is badges, reminding us of the oppressive acts\nof the Nazis when they tried to cleanse the country of undesirables. Incarceration, a\nprogression for the confinement, enclosure and last journeys. The rapid escalation to\n-- to convey to and remove prisoners from the camps. I think one of the ideas that I\nused o-on the side, there\u2019s a progression from one to six, I used the stripes of the\ntallid, progressing from one to six. I chose six because of the reference to six\nmillion. My last piece is a very dark one, but it has a little glimmer of gold, and that\nis our hope for the future, that these things never happen again. They\u2019re small\ntapestries. I wanted them small so that one has to lean into them in order to really\nstudy them, more like putting one\u2019s nose into a book, if you will, by coming thr --\ninto very close contact. I used cotton material because it was a non-precious\nmaterial. I felt that I wanted to use something rather universal and simple and there\nare -- there are many references to numbers and to colors and to the stripes on the\nprisoners garb. And the colors of the -- the badges, which represented different\nfactions, not only Jews, but people in general who were incarcerated. It\u2019s a series\nthat I did not start with piece number one, strangely enough, piece number five was\nthe first one I did, and then kind of wove. I knew I wanted to do six pieces, but\nJune 23, 2005\nstarted with number five and then went backwards and started to number one. The\nfirst one has a few let -- letters in it, and it says Jude Raus, but if you\u2019ll see the d-e\nand the u-s is Deus, and my question is where was Deus, where was God then? It\nwas a mammoth undertaking psychologically for me to do this piece, but I hope that\nthe children will look on it sometime and remember what happened to all of us.",

        "A: I have been to Yad Vashem and I\u2019ve been to the Holocaust Museum in\nWashington many, many times. I go frequently. I feel privileged in the fact that I\ncan go and read names on Yom HaShoah. I take every visitor that comes to visit me\nhere in Washington to the museum. I find it an e-extremely uplifting as well as the\nother extreme. I feel both buoyed by the experience and I feel very sad and -- and --\nand live it again and again but I feel sometimes it\u2019s important to go and just be there\nand see maybe just one or two of the exhibits, or go to the library and do a little\nresearch on subject matter that\u2019s very dear to your heart. And I -- as I say, I go very\nfrequently. I go to the bookshop, I find very wonderful books there to -- to take\nhome. And I find it an -- perhaps the most unusual place to visit in Washington and\nI tell every one of my visitors they mustn\u2019t leave Washington without going and\nthey will be well rewarded in different ways by going. I think that the teaching\nJune 23, 2005\nprograms there are just remarkable. I love the fact that so many of the teaching is\ndone, not only teaching children, but teaching the police force that comes through\nthe gates, the teachers. I like the spirit of the workers there, who are just remarkable\npeople who -- I can\u2019t say enough for it. I think we are just so blessed to have the\nmuseum here. And have I been to others?

        "Answer: My name is Renate Rosemarie Fischer Chernoff.",
        "A: I was born on June 25\", 1929, in Breslau, Germany. Germ -- Breslau is now\nPolish, but it was German at that point 1n time.",
        "A: My family actually went very far back, I would say. I have records to -- 0-of\ngraves having been erected in -- just right after the Napoleonic war, the Franco-\nPrussian War. And of all strange things, one of the graves that may have survived\nall the fighting in that area 1s still standing today. I managed to get a picture of it just\nvery recently on the web. And we were very excited to see that gravestone.",
        "A: My father was Walter James Fischer. He was a psychiatrist. He went to school\nin his native town of Breslau where most of my forebears were born. He was -- is\nJune 23, 2005\nthe professional person in his family. His parents were merchants, they had a\nwonderful -- probably the largest toyshop in all of Silesia, and he chose not to go\ninto that kind of work, perhaps because he was in the army in -- in the first World\nWar, and fought in France, fought in Verdun, came back and -- and at that point he\nwas only 16 or 18 years old. And came back totally paralyzed by what he had seen;\nhe was a litter bearer in the field, and decided that medicine would be his calling. S -\n- my grandmother and grandfather had the shop, both of them worked. My\ngrandmother worked alongside her husband and so did her sister and his brother.\nThey were two brothers married to two sisters, and so it was definitely a family\naffair. And their parents, my great-grandparents were also in Breslau. What they did\nI\u2019m really not sure, but in -- in business of some sort. The business, interestingly\nenough -- the house where the business was housed 1s standing today in the very\nsame place, it was one of the few buildings that survived the second World War. It\nwas on the rink, the main square of the city of Breslau, right opposite the court\nbuildings. It\u2019s number 26 on -- number 36, excuse me, on the rink. And I have seen\nreproductions of that area, or photographs of that area and sure enough, it\u2019s still\nthere. The Poles have really taken a great deal of trouble to try to rebuild that area as\nit was, and I think s -- handled it very successfully. My forbearers on my mother\u2019s\nside were from Birnbaum, which is really on the Polish side. What -- my\nJune 23, 2005\ngrandfather on my mother\u2019s side was in the canning business, and was the first\ncanner who did diabetic fruits in Germany, canned diabetic fruits. And had the\nfactory just outside of Breslau and so my mother grew up really in the country, in\nthis -- 1t\u2019s suburban now, but it was really country when she grew up, and that she\nloved. And she did go to school in Breslau, but the rest of the time she was a\ncountry girl.",
        "A: Actually, she was, although she went to high school and upon graduating from\nhigh school went to a sort of a finishing school for girls and studied music. She had a\nmagnificent voice, and was very nicely trained, and sang eventually professionally,\nin part, but always sang for the high holidays at synagogue. And in fact, I came\nacross a letter just the other day, the head of the synagogue in Ratibor, which was\none of the places where we lived, thanked her for making the service so beautiful.",
        "A: My grandparents on both sides were fairly religious. My father was pretty much\nof a free thinker. My mother was more religious than he, but I think both of them\nbecame very, very much more religious when we crossed over to this side of the\nocean.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Oh yes, we always celebrated holidays and I particularly remember Sukkot in the\nsynagogue in Ratibor, which is the little town that I really remember best of all. It\nwas in the -- in Upper Silesia, which was a number of hours by train from Breslau\ngoing towards the Czech border and the Polish border, we were sort of in a -- very\nclose, within walking distance of the Polish border, because I remember walking\nwith my mother to have buttermilk on the Polish side of the border because the\nfarmer -- that farmer\u2019s buttermilk was by all means the very best, and so we walked\nacross wheat fields and over the border to get our buttermilk. Very nice memory.",
        "A: We celebrated Shabbat, my mother kindled candles. We celebrated Passover, but\nmostly we celebrated our Passovers, and I have very vivid memories with very dear\nfriends who were Orthodox, I believe. And we s -- I went to services on Saturday\nmornings, not with my parents, but with a friend of theirs who took me not only to\nsynagogue on Saturday mornings, but took me out for a krimmelhelmchen which\nwas a poppy seed roll o-on our way home. And that made a great impression on me.\nBut my grandpar -- my grandmother -- I think all of them were really liberal Jews\nrather than Orthodox Jews. I think tha-that it was not named Conservative, I think\nJune 23, 2005\nthat branch of Jewry in Germany was called the liberal branch and we went to\nsynagogue there rather than the Orthodox synagogue.",
        "A: They had very strong opinions. Active, I wouldn\u2019t say, no. Ma -- I think my\nfather\u2019s days were so full with his -- with his work, and with work for the courts. He\nwas very often asked to be the s -- the psychiatrist who gave opinions in court cases.\nAnd they were very active at their lodge, the B\u2019nai Brith lodge. That I do\nremember.",
        "A: All right. We were born -- I was born in Breslau. When my father w -- a-already\nwas working in a suburban area -- area called Obernigk. O-b-e-r-n-i-g-k, | think. It\nwas a suburb of Breslau and had a large psychiatric hospital in it. And there he had\nhis job and there we lived. Now, I was very little and really have no memories other\nthan picture memories of that place. It was the same town that my grandparents had\nthe canning factory in, so this all worked out very nicely in that respect. We moved,\nI believe it was 1934 to Ratibor, R-a-t-i-b-o-r, it 1s now also in Polish hands and\nhas changed its name just a little. And I think when we moved we -- I was 1 -- going\ninto nursery kindergarten, and I went to the school of the Ursuline sisters and I\nJune 23, 2005\nloved my time there. They were so good to us, and they -- I learned so many little\nskills, and I even still have the little needle book that I embroidered for my mother,\nmy first timid effort at working with fibers, and it was very precious to my mother,\nand a little moth-eaten but I still have it. And we moved into our first house and we\nrented an apartment on Svingerstrasser 17 and within a month or two we were\nasked to leave because we were unwanted. The owner of the house didn\u2019t realize\nthat somebody with the name of Fischer could be Jewish. And so we moved and\nfound a very nice apartment on number 23 Svingerstrasser, and I have very vivid\nmemories of it, I could draw the plan of the apartment. It was a first floor walk-up,\nvery large apartment and my father was able to have his practice right in our\napartment. The first room was very large, with -- I can\u2019t think of the English word\nfor the moment. It\u2019s a-a-an [indecipherable] a a no -- a no -- a knockout, a glass\nknockout so that one could really watch the street up and down and see what\u2019s going\non and it was an up -- first floor, upstairs, and large. And then the room next to us\nwas the waiting room. And during the day it was the waiting room for the patients\nand in the evening it was the gentlemen\u2019s room to have cigarettes. And as we walked\ndown the corridor, there was a kitchen to the left in which Maria, our very dear\ndomestic help who lived with us, did her thing. And then further down, of course,\nwas the dining room and the living room and my bedroom and my parent\u2019s room.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: I -- yes, yes.",
        "A: My mother always said Mr. Hitler saw to it that I was an only child. They would\n-- they were ready to have a rather lar -- and had hoped for a rather large family.\nHowever, I did acquire a brother a little later on, but that\u2019s another story.",
        "A: My mother sang very beautifully and my father always thought that he might\nhave, if he had not become a physician he might have become an architect. So I\nthink yes, I would say so. They both had extremely fine taste in things that they\nchose to buy, and yeah, I would s -- and my mother\u2019s singing, of course, was quite --\nquite remarkable.",
        "A: German only. My mother knew some French and my father studied Greek and\nLatin in school, and -- but of course it was the reading language of Greek and Latin,\nI don\u2019t know that he spoke it, other than memorized poetry.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yeah.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Yes, it was definitely a mixed -- a mixed neighborhood. I don\u2019t think that\nRatibor had a specifically Jewish area, I think we were all very well here and there.\nI-I cannot think of -- of a Jewish neighborhood, per se. The neighborhood where we\nlived was -- was a nicely treed neighborhood. It was a main street, and yet it had\ntrees on it and in the back of our house was a -- every apartment had its own little\ngarden, and so we raised strawberries. It was a small garden, but we raised\nstrawberries and flowers and there was a little house on the garden, in the back of\nthe garden, big enough to have a table and maybe six or eight chairs and I know my\nmother\u2019s book club met there in the summertime. And of course, I loved playing in\nthe garden. And I had a nanny who made sure that I learned how to grow things and\nto weed, and to take care of flowers and who was really my steady companion after I\ncame home from school each day.",
        "A: You know, it was easy, it was -- well, not -- perhaps not the children in my\nneighborhood because across from our house were the courts, the courts of that part\nof the province. So there were not that many houses that had children in them.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Judicial courts.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, judicial courts. But one usually made appointments with one\u2019s\nfriends and after school they could come to my house and it was always -- I always\nhad a lot of little friends who came over and whose company I enjoyed and whose\nhomes I went to as well. Not for very long, but for awhile.",
        "A: We had -- I had very close Jewish and non-Jewish friends, and I was very\nfortunate enough to have the non-Jewish friends because some of them were really\nlovely children with whom I enjoyed being together. And we were together really,\nuntil the time when it was no longer allowed that these little girls, particularly, could\ncome and visit me. My very dearest friend was a young girl by the name of Ushi\nBlaut, whose father was an architect for the city, and who was threatened to lose his\njob if his little girl came and played with me. And I think maybe that was the first\nawakening that things were very strange.",
        "A: My first awakening.",
        "A: It meant a great deal to me because we saw very much eye to eye and we loved\nbeing naughty together. I couldn\u2019t understand why. I couldn\u2019t -- I could see her at\nschool, but yet she couldn\u2019t come to my house after school, and I couldn\u2019t visit her\nany more. And that -- that started -- I mean, that kind of began and then it was like\nsomething rolling on and on and on and it -- and it was -- I tell you, the one thing\nthat I do remember is by going through some old photographs, I did find out that she\nwas allowed to come to my birthday party and I think that must have meant a lot to\nme, and it was very special, but on a day to day basis, she couldn\u2019t visit.",
        "A: I think it was my fifth -- fifth and sixth birthday parties. Now, I -- as I say, I could\nnot visit her, she could not visit me, but birthday parties seemed to be kosher.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yes.",
        "A: \u00b033.",
        "A: I think one of the most frightening things were the parades through our streets.\nAnd I mentioned the bay window earlier on, which gave wonderful visibility to\neverything that was going up and down the street. And the night that the brownshirts\nJune 23, 2005\nwere having their parades, I remember my nanny holding me in her arms and we\nwere watching it. It was nighttime, it was with candles lit and loud singing and --\nand boisterous goings on on the street. And I wish I could tell you what year that\nwas, that I don\u2019t remember. But I remember the fact -- oh, I remember the fact, I\nremember the shirts, I remember the glistening on the black boots. And we were one\nstory up. But it seemed like endless numbers of people were marching and marching\nand marching. And yet, that part of Germany, I think was not as badly off as other\nparts of Germany. Somehow we were late, I think, in receiving the blows, so to\nspeak. I think things were worse in other places, but I do recall this vividly and even\ntoday when I talk about it, I get a little chilly.",
        "A: I think she held me. She hugged me. She herself was so appalled at what was\ngoing on, I think, and understandable for her. And for Maria, our -- our help in that\n-- our live-in help in the house. Maria was a very simple Polish woman, who did all\nthe housework for us, and was -- and lived with us, and when she would go to\nchurch and come home, she would always tell us what the father\u2019s sermon was, each\nweek. She would share that with us. She was totally against the regime, although her\nbrother was a member of the Nazi party, and I remember having him come and visit\nJune 23, 2005\nand he sat out in the kitchen with her while she was preparing coffee or something.\nAnd he proudly showed off the lap -- other side of his lapel, with a swastika attached\nto it. When he came into the house he had the good sense of putting it on the reverse\nside. Most of the time I think he had it on the real side, he was a Nazi of the first\norder. But not his sister. Maria was a gentle, wonderful soul, with whom we kept in\ntouch through the war -- not during the war, but after the war. She wrote to my\nparents and she wrote as long as they allowed mail to go through and I have le -- her\nletters t-to this day. And she actually, after my grandmother was deported, she\nactually walked out of the house and walked til she came across to the Czech side of\nthe border. She couldn\u2019t stand being in Germany. And she say -- she went into the\nservice of a priest in Czechoslovakia and survived the war.",
        "A: Then, or now?",
        "A: I think frightening. Terrifying to -- to say the least. I of course didn\u2019t understand\nthe ins and outs behind it all, but there was something frightening about the image.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that I was old enough to ask the right questions. They, of course,\ntried to shield me. Things got very difficult in Ratibor. My father, who was in\nprivate practice, when the decree came out that only Jewish patients could go to\nJewish doctors, his patients, of course had to hold off coming. Although strangely\nenough in the middle of the night, very often the back door knocked, it was a patient\nwho didn\u2019t want to be seen entering the doctor\u2019s house, would come. And of course,\nmy father saw him. And patients asked him to come and see them. And he did not\nhave a car, and in the early days he went to see his patients by bicycle. But later on,\nhe got a motorcycle, yeah, a big do -- it was my father and his pale green motorcycle\nand his one piece suit, which covered him all the way from over his head, to his\nshoes, with a zip in front. Went to see his patients in Poland, and he would take his\nmotorcycle and go over. And there was the standing joke, he stopped at the -- at the\ncustoms bureau -- at the customs office to get his papers signed that he was going\nacross the border and about an hour later he would come back and the border guard\nsniffed -- he would sniff, oh Dr. Fischer, you have just seen a patient? Yes, and the\npayment was two wonderful Polish sausages that were hanging on the inside of his\nsuit. They knew it, they looked the other way. It was just -- 1t was an -- an accepted\nnorm. And so people did come and he did still help people who needed help, 1-1f\nthey could just get to his hou -- to our house and not be seen. But one morning -- and\nJune 23, 2005\nI don\u2019t remember what year it was, there was a big yellow sign plastered all over the\nentryway. And Maria went outside as always to pick up the milk and the fresh rolls\nthat were left at the doorstep and she removed the sign. And the sign said, De Jude\nlugt. The Jew lies. And she tore it off very quickly and tore it up.",
        "A: My father told me. Yeah. And I think maybe that was sort of the beginning of\nwhen he thought probably it would be better to move to a larger city, and so -- and\nmany people did move from the smaller towns, hoping to find their place and a\nbetter way of life in the larger city. So in 1936, I think it was 1936, he decided to go\nto Breslau. And so there was movement afoot to move the family, mother and me,\nup to Breslau. But the move was going to be a difficult one, he already saw the\nhandwriting on the wall. And so I was sent to Berlin to stay with my other granny,\nmy mother\u2019s mother, who lived in [indecipherable] in Berlin, and also, I was not\nallowed to go to school any more. Jewish children were not allo -- were not accepted\nat school any more, so it -- there was a duel reason for moving. I had to go to Jewish\nschool. And there was no Jewish school. There were too few people in Ratibor for a\nJewish school to be there, so I was sent to live with my grandmother in Berlin and to\ncontinue my education at a Jewish school, which I did, while my parent\n[indecipherable] while my parents were moving.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: I disliked it with a vengeance. I did not want to go to Berlin and I have letters\nthat I wrote home, I have them in my keep. Please take me home, I don\u2019t want to\nstay here, I don\u2019t like Berlin. It was all very strange to me, and living with my\ngrandmother was sort of an unknown, I didn\u2019t know her really that well. And she\nwas a darling, kind, wonderful person, but it wasn\u2019t my mother and it wasn\u2019t my\nfather and I didn\u2019t know my surroundings. Not a soul did I know other than her, and\nI was deeply, deeply unhappy in Berlin and I had to stay there through maybe one or\ntwo semesters. And by that time, Mother and Father had moved to Breslau, but this\nwas a sort of an interesting thing, they were not allowed to live with my\ngrandmother. My grandmother had an enormous house, really. Beautiful house with\nspectacular gardens, a flower garden and a vegetable garden and a fruit garden and a\n-- it was really -- it was a semi-attached -- semi-detached? Semi-attached. Well, they\nwere two houses together, but they were both enormous, and wi-with lots of help.\nThere was a gardener, and there was a lady who came in and did the laundry and\nthere were two people who just cleaned and cooked and washed and did things in the\nhouse. And she had some borders because she was at this point by herself, my -- her\nhusband had passed away. Her husband, my Omi Hadel Fischer\u2019s husband passed\nJune 23, 2005\naway of natural causes in 1936, I think it was and so there was plenty of room for us\nto have a very comfortable existence in the main house, but the Nazi wouldn\u2019t have\nthat. We weren\u2019t allowed to live in the same house unless it was in servant\u2019s\nquarters. And so we did, we lived in the servant\u2019s quarters of the house. We were\nvery, you know, it -- it was just another form of breaking the spirit. But we made the\nbest of it, my folks did really very, very well in -- in adjusting to the new life. My\nfather opened an office in Breslau and immediately had a fairly sizable practice --\npractice. And things were moving along. Not well, but they were moving along.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: I was very fortunate to have friends both Jewish and non-Jewish and we did a lot\nof visiting back and forth to each other\u2019s homes, although always with an\nappointment, it wasn\u2019t a natural going back and forth the way we have, or at least\nour children had it when they were growing up. It was an appointment made and the\nnanny was on hand and it was supervised play. For example, every Sunday my\nJune 23, 2005\nfriend Maya Furlish and I had a date, it was every Sunday, it was at the home\nwhere the nanny wasn\u2019t on duty for the weekend. And we always had the same\nmeal, it was always hot dogs with potato salad, and either vanilla pudding with\nchocolate sauce, or chocolate pudding with vanilla sauce. That was the given menu\nand we had wonderful times together. Maya had an older brother. Maya and her\nfamily moved to Israel early on. Her father was a veterinarian and he went to Israel\nand was in charge of the chicken farms all over the country. And they were very\nhappy to have him there. Her brother joined the army and stayed 1-in the permanent\narmy of the Israel force. Changed his name from Evian Furlish to Ari Rohn. Maya\ns -- kept her name, she married some a -- a -- an attorney by the name of Kolhana,\nwho unfortunately passed away, and then she remarried a man from her own\nsettlement, which was [indecipherable] and they both live in Haifa with all their\nchildren and grandchildren and I still am in touch with Maya, we write often, more\nso now that we have email. And we have visited back and forth a number of times,\nshe coming here and we fortunate enough to be able to travel to Israel. At the birth -",
        "A: They left in 1937, and it was a -- a good time because they were able to take\nthings with them and they were 1-immediately very well accepted, built a home and\nJune 23, 2005\nhave lived there very well since. And my parents also went to visit them and the old\nties are very strong in our chil -- in -- in ourselves. Our children don\u2019t know each\nother too well, although two of my three kids have visited in Israel and stayed with\nher, so in a way it goes on. The -- there were many other young people who -- with\nwhom I grew up. Many -- several of them went to Israel, one was Epstein, Rutal\nEpstein who went to Israel and has made a good life for herself, 1-is still living\nthere now, I have not kept up with -- with her, but hear about her, occasionally. Vera\nMarcus came to the United States with her family and lived in New York. Laura\nMamlock, daughter of the ear, nose and throat Dr. Mamlock also came to the\nUnited States and my parents were in touch with the Mamlocks for many -- for\nmany years.",
        "A: I think that they left in 1937 -- \u201938. \u201937 or \u201938, and they were very fortunate,\nthose two families, of being able to get into the United States. I don\u2019t think anybody\nelse was. No one of my -- that -- whom I know, I don\u2019t think anyone made it into\nCanada. Canada had a very tight immigration policy and only allowed physicians\nand farmers in and once they got here, they gave them a pretty hard time. The\nfarmers were settled immediately, the doctors were kept from working, so -- but\nJune 23, 2005\nmay-maybe more of this later. Other friends were the Baums, Dr. Baum went to\nIsrael, he was a pediatrician and his children and grandchildren are in Israel now.\nHis son, unfortunately lost an arm in the 1948 war. And the whereabouts of several\nother people, I really don\u2019t know. I know that my dear friend Ilse Meyer -- Mayer --\nMeyer didn\u2019t make it, nor did Yurachem -- forgotten his name at the moment, his\nfirst name was Yurachem, but he di -- he also -- Yurachem Vaber did not make it.\nAnd I have seen the fact that they did not make it in the files of the -- of the Yad\nVashem database. And many of the teachers that I had also, unfortunately were\nunable to -- to escape. But Ratibor was a nice little city to grow up 1n, it was a\ncharming town, winter was wonderful, we had snow and skating. We had a pond in\nthe middle of the town and it froze in the winter, and the entire li-little town was\nthere skating. In the summer my father took a boat and rode us all around in the\nboat. It was -- 1t was a good time, it was a nice time for -- for only a short period of\ntime though, unfortunately.",
        "A: Oh, first day of school was very exciting because every child who started school\nwas given a cornucopia filled with candy. It\u2019s called the Osted Tuete. It -- the\nEaster cornucopia because school started in spring. And I remember my friend\nMaya be -- who is a year older than I am, bringing me my cornucopia, I was still in\nJune 23, 2005\nbed and she brought it to me and it was such an exciting occasion. In fact, I have\nsome pictures to verify the fact that it was really an occasion to be remembered. And\nof course, we went to school. School was an extremely formal affair. We did not\nwear uniforms, but we were very regimented. We had 42 children in a class of --\nwith one teacher. And school was from eight in the morning until one o\u2019clock and\nthen we were through. We all brought our little lunch in lunchboxes that were hung\naround our necks, sort of second breakfasts, my mother called them. And then we\nhad -- when we got home after one o\u2019clock it was dinner, dinnertime. And the\ncurriculum when we started included of course, the usual reading, writing and\narithmetic. But it also included art and music and gym, and religious studies. And to\nthat end Halpy Befelt was my religious teacher, and I st-still have the Bible books\nthat I used, written in German, of course. And once or twice a week he came, not to\nthe school itself, but to a building close to the school, and we all walked over and\ntook our studies while the catechism was being taught to the Catholic children in the\nsi -- in the class. I think boys and girls were separate in school, I\u2019m pri -- I\u2019m sure\nthey were, but to religious school we all went together.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Yes. I think one of the eye opening experiences to me was when an in -- an\ninkwell was thrown at me. And I think I was terrified. It was by one of the other\nchildren. That frightened me. The other thing that really upset me was the fact that\nwe had row monitors who were supposed to take care of people not speaking or\nmisbehaving, and if they did talk to anybody or in any way misbehave, the name\nwas given to the teacher. And I remember getting more sh -- of my shares of -- of --\nof censure to talking or misbehaving than I really should have gotten. And of course\nthe result was that there was a stick that was used and was really -- we rece -- I\nreceived a whipping on both my hands every time I was unget zeigt, which meant,\npointed out. And that I think kind of really ma -- discouraged me. And somehow the\nteachers, I don\u2019t know, they turned their backs on these things. For what reason, I\ndon\u2019t know. For example, when we walked down the street, we -- and we had to wa\n-- we saw a teacher, the -- the way to acknowledge it was to raise one\u2019s hand and to\nsay, heil Hitler. I couldn\u2019t do it and my parents absolutely forbade me to do it, and\nso I just curtsied. And the teacher, instead of acknowledging the curtsy, would look\nthe other way. But of course, she didn\u2019t do anything to -- to upset me, but it was that\n-- but in itself was upsetting to be looked over and not acknowledged. And so it was\nwith most of the teachers. I think that they were being threatened and -- and we were\nbeing threatened in a way, too. That was a hard time.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember, but picture or not, he was there in --\nyou know, in -- just in so many little, small details. For example, there was every\nweek or so, the pot was po -- passed around for money for Wintahilfe. Winter help\nfor meals for -- for indigent people or money being raised for unusual causes, and\nyou realized, of course, that the causes were the party, but you had to give. So that\nwas another somewhat humiliating experience. But the fact that the teacher believed\nthe children who -- whose hate was really being taught at home, and who took it out\non -- on us, that was -- that was unpardonable.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t remember that. I remember talking to my parents about it, but\nI don\u2019t remember talking to other children about it.",

All I know is I have\nsome pictures in my picture album in which I\u2019ve got hanky in hand, and I remember\nthe incidents, telling my mother and she was deeply, deeply unhappy. And you\nknow, I think what I\u2019ve learned, and I\u2019ve -- it\u2019s been with me all my life is, I don\u2019t\nJune 23, 2005\nwant to make my parents unhappy. And so rather than make them unhappy, I\nwouldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yes, I think so. I think so. I was fairly independent. I wasn\u2019t a very good student,\nI was a very average student. And according to my report cards, all of which I have\nfrom Germany, I was not very artistic either. Music was better than art, I think.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t think so, but I did exercise well. I mean, I -- I was not athletic, but I\nwas flexible and -- and I enjoyed games. But athletic per se, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t\nthink I was ever very athletic, although I did play basketball on my high school\nteam, and in college. But that was only because I\u2019m very tall for a woman.",
        "A: I loved to draw, and I liked to do handwork and my grandmother taught me how\nto crochet. And -- and I liked -- y-yes, I -- I -- I did like that very much.

        "A: Yes, when I changed schools to Berlin and particularly to Breslau, everyone was\nable to read Hebrew quite fluently, and I was struggling terribly with it. And I really\nthink to this day, I really struggle with Hebrew. I have learned French easily, of\ncourse the German and the English no problem, but with Hebrew, to this day I\nstruggle. And I wonder how much this 1s a little resistance on my part. Not willing,\nmind you, but sort of subconscious.\nJune 23, 2005",
        "A: Of course I didn\u2019t, I was too young, but in -- in Ratibor, for a -- a -- quite a while\nwe were allowed to go to theater -- to the theater and to the movies, and to musical\nevents. But the last one that -- the last cinema that I saw was in 1936 at the time of\nthe Olympics. And after that we were not allowed to go to the movie theater any\nmore. And I think it was after that ti -- point in time that the Kubu -- the\nKulturbund came and did its outreach program to the smaller cities and towns and\nbrought wonderful people to sing and to play and so on. One was, for example,\nAlexander Kipnis, who came. And I remember my father, who was very active in\nthese circles, getting all dressed up, I think it was tails. And my mother in her very\nfinest. And it was an evening of Alexander Kipnis. I remember this very well. And\nthere must have been other occasions when the Kubu came down, but this -- this 1s\nthe one that stands out in my mind. Also my father, who was a cigar smoker and a\npipe smoker -- apparently before the performance there was a dinner and I think he\npulled out his cigar and Alexander Kipnis made some very unpleasant remarks\nabout people who smoke. It sticks out in my mind.",
        "A: The concert was actually in the social hall of the synagogue and the synagogue\nmust have been an old church that was taken over by the Jewish community. I\nremember it very lovingly, my father sat downstairs. My mother, who sang in the\nchoir sat upstairs and I was allowed to sit with my mother. Mother was not only a\nmember of the choir, but did the solo work for Yizker service and sang just very,\nvery beautifully. On the side of the synagogue was a little courtyard and nice things\nwent on including, in my memory, wonderful Sukkoth that was built each year with\ntables laden with fruits and vegetables and goodies to eat. And lovely decorations\nfrom a roof that was made of greens, and it was just such a delightful time for the\nchildren. We also had -- I guess it was like a club, but I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t be a hundred\npercent sure, but I know that I -- one Sunday I guess it was, we made lead\ncandlesticks for ourselves. Very tiny lead candlesticks, we were allowed -- they had\nsome forms and I guess they poured the lead and each child went home with two\ncandlesticks. They were big enough to take maybe a birthday candle, but it was so\nspecial and I still have them, and my granddaughter now has them. So they\u2019ve come\na long way and they were very dear. But a lot went on in the synagogue because of\nthe social hall. In fact, plays were given and there were readings and lectures came.\nAnd all this happened 1n the social hall of the synagogue, which was pretty much in\nthe downtown area of Ratibor, and Ratibor was a pretty little town, not far from the\nJune 23, 2005\nsynagogue for example, was the marketplace. And I know that my mother went\nmarketing many times during the week because of course we didn\u2019t have a\nrefrigerator, we only had an icebox. And so she went marketing. But besides getting\nfish and vegetables and things like that, they also had pottery, and it was called\n[speaks German]. And they were wonderful pottery shapes and today, when you go\ninto Pier One, sometimes you can see pottery made in Poland. It\u2019s blue and white\nusually, and a very nice, repetitive, simple design, a repeat design on the pottery.\nAnd very charming, very attractive. It hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot since then.

A most unusual party. It was a party that celebrated the safe arrival of an\nelectric refrigerator from the United States of America that had a light in it.

I was petrified to think that I was going to have to live in log\ncabin with ice and snow all around and the wolves in the neighborhood. It was kind\nof frightening, but I think the nicest, nicest story that my father told me, and I'll\nremember to this day is, dear, he said, we\u2019re going to a land where even a Jew can\nbecome a person in the government. And of course he was talking about Bernard\nBaruch. And I\u2019m still a -- you can see, I\u2019m still emotionally very touched by that.

But the tone of voice was so grating and the sheer\nshouts of adulation and adoration were frightening in themselves. And I recall my\nfather saying that he had heard, and I\u2019m sure this is so, everybody in the audience\nfelt the fuehrer was looking into his eyes. One was a -- a person was standing there,\none in 10,000 but each one felt that he had been individually touched by this, you\nmust say, charismatic character.

I even recall the night that there\nwas a fire in a building not too far away from us and it was always a question as to\nwhy the fire. Was it a set fire because there were Jews living in that building, or was\nit a Christmas three that -- it was on Christmas -- whether it was a Christmas tree\nthat was responsible for it. I don\u2019t think anybody ever knew, but I associate that\npicture along also with the marching, the marching, the beat. It may not have\nhappened at the same time, but in my memory was very -- it must have been very\nclose together. And of course the -- the birthdays that were always celebrated,\nJune 23, 2005\nHitler\u2019s birthday and other notable occasions. And then there were always special\nparades.",

        "A: Well, my most vivid memory of si -- Passover Seders were celebrated with my\nparent\u2019s very dear friends. The Passover with the Weisbarts are really in my\nmemory very frequently because they were absolutely wonderful Seders together.\nThe Weisbarts had a store on the -- downtown in the rink area, the rink area of the\ndowntown part of Ratibor. And it had all sorts of wonderful things like kitchen\nequipment and things for the house and they lived above the shop in a comfortable\napartment. And just above them was a family by the name of Rechnitz. And so on\nSeder evening, first night of Seder, Frau Weisbart, whose husband used to take me\nto synagogue on Saturday mornings and buy me those delicious little rolls, had us\nover -- I think they had no children of their own. I don\u2019t believe -- or perhaps they\ndid, but at any rate, they were not there. He would conduct the service. We were all\ninterspersed, sitting in -- at a long table and I also remember having f -- my four\ncups of wine and being a little bit out of it one year. But they had the most delicious\nsidoram. The food was unbelievable and a particularly good thing was a fish\nshodoe. And I cannot spell it, I don\u2019t know how to tell you about it, but it was fluffy\nJune 23, 2005\nand it was lemony and it had fish in it and it was wonderful. And there were children\naround the table, and -- and a family by the name of Rechnitz, and it was a long\nevening, but always one that was a very, very happy one. I think I remember two\nyears that we were there, and I\u2019m sure there were more years than that. What I think\nis particularly interesting, my husband is very interested in Jewish genealogy and I\nbring this in because it really does relate. There was a request about people who\nknew people in Ratibor and in that general area of Upper Silesia and I answered it\nand I said yes, I do know the area, and immediately a response came, would you\nhappen to know a -- I\u2019m looking for the name Rechnitz. And it came from\nsomebody who was originally in Shanghai. This was a Jewish family who went,\ninstead of going west went east and found refuge in Shanghai, lived out the war\nyears in Shanghai and then came to the United States. And the name of the lady\nwho made the request was Yvonne Adler. And I said, this is very, very strange. I\nsaid, I saw a Mrs. Adler present almost every day when O.J. Simpson trials were\ncarried on. And they sometimes interviewed her, would you be the same one? She\nsaid yes, that was me. So she wanted to know about Rechnitz, and I said yes. And\nshe said, I have no knowledge of their whereabouts. I said, I can tell you nothing\nperhaps of the mother and father, but the two daughters survived and are living in\nIsrael. She was delighted, needless to say. So then a little later a letter came. She\nJune 23, 2005\nsaid, you know, I have a relative who lives in Rockville. Is that close to Potomac? I\nsaid yes, I think within, sort of, walking distance. And so we met in the relatives,\nand had them over for a cup of coffee and enjoyed meeting them. And in between,\nevery now and again, we still get on the genealogy line and a -- express a word of\ngreeting at Passover time, and just to stay little bit in touch. But it all revolved\naround the pass -- that Passover table. And I was able to fill a -- in a little bit on her\nfamily tree, and likewise she was able to fill in a little bit of my family tree, because\na distant cousin of my father\u2019s was an editor of the Jewish newspaper in Shanghai\nduring the years of the second World War. He was an editor in Breslau, made a trip\nand stayed in Shanghai, lived out the years in Shanghai and apparently moved to\nIsrael and unfortunately died there before we could make contact. But she was able\nto help us out in that part of our family tree, so the internet\u2019s a great thing.",

        "A: Mm-hm. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes. And I\u2019ve -- I have several memorable vacations. My father and mother were\ngreat hikers and they loved to hike in the mountains and so very frequently we went\nJune 23, 2005\nup to the Tetras, and the Riesengebirge and walked and enjoyed the fresh air. I\nhave happy memories of being put into a sled driven by horses and being pulled\nthrough deep snow, and staying at a lodge, and enjoying the -- the winter activities.\nMostly -- it mostly was walking. But -- and this was all very well and good, we\ncould go and do our vacations, go on our vacations and stay at the lodges, or at the\nhotels, but a time came when they were taking no more Jewish visitors and so the\nvacation places were somewhat rationed and we had to go to places that were Jewish\n-- run by Jewish families for Jewish families and that\u2019s where we went on vacation.\nAnd I remember going up to Swinemitinde, which is on the Baltic, where there was\na very lovely vacation spot that catered to the Jewish trade. Was called the Move.\nAnd the M\u00e9ve is a seagull and it was on -- on the water, and we went. I stayed one\nyear with my grandmother and one year I think I went with my mother. Yes, I\nremember going with my mother, because I had to do homework, so not to fall\nbehind. And the German school year was a little bit different, but I was allowed to --\nto miss a little time, as long as my mother kept up with the assignments with me. But\nit was interesting to think that we were really isolated even in where we could spend\nvacation time. Swinemunde was rather fri -- to me was a little bit of a frightening\nplace to be because the lodge where I stayed with my grandmother sat opposite of\nPeenemiunde. And that\u2019s where the Germans were building their U-boats and we\nJune 23, 2005\ncould see the white boats in the harbor, across the water. And we were well aware of\nthe fact that in 1937, there were definite attempts at getting ready for a war. And I --\nI still see in my mind\u2019s eye the white -- the very white painted ships against very\ngray waters. And rather frightening looking, they looked like sharks.",
        "A: There was a very -- in Ratibor was a very nice municipal swimming pool, and I\nwas given my first instructions to swimming at that pool, I was five years old and it\nwas a funny way of learning how to swim. There were ro -- there were L-shaped\nrods -- well, actually probably fairly stable pipes that had ropes on them, that were\nsuspended over the water, and we were hooked onto these ropes, and were 1n a very\nsafe place to study our strokes. And I -- I learned how to swim that way, I became a\nvery good swimmer, very fast. And I remember it was a miserable day and I was\nabout to take my test to pass to get my first card, and it required 15 minutes of\nuninterrupted swimming around the pool, the edge of the pool. And as I say, it was a\ndreary day, but my grandmother was visiting and she took me to the pool. And I\npassed, I even did 20 minutes, but in order to get your card you had to jump in at the\nfar end, into the deep water. This I could not do. I was a totally petrified creature.\nBut they said well, if you will jump, if we put you on the harness and the rope, we\nwill let you pass. And of course I did, and I got my certificate and I was the happiest\nJune 23, 2005\nperson in the world. But then that was closed to Jews after we left. It was no longer\nallowed for Jewish people to -- to swim there. But at least I learned how to swim.",
        "A: Actually, I think I probably was there less time than in my imagination. I was\nthere a matter of maybe six months. But I was so lonely, and my grandmother tried\nto make it so pleasant and comfortable for me, but I was away from my parents and I\nwas very unhappy. I went to a school where I didn\u2019t know anybody. It was a Jewish\nschool and I didn\u2019t know Hebrew and all the children knew Hebrew. I was\ndevastated. However, the period came to an end and I saw a little bit of Berlin. I\ndon\u2019t remember very much of it, I remember where my grandmother lived, I\nremember where the beautiful synagogue was at which Dr. Joachim Prince was the\n-- the m -- the rabbi. I remember going to a service there. I re -- I remember going to\nthe zoo and to -- doing things that little children like to do, but in general I have a\nvery, very limited memory of what went on there, as opposed to the very accurate\nmemory I have of Ratibor, where I c -- I can draw a map and I drew a map for my\nfather some years back when -- and asked him whether he could go over this map\nwith me to see whether my memory was accurate, and he said absolutely. The\nmemory of the street where the dentist was, and where the knit shop was and where\nJune 23, 2005\nthe market was and so on and so forth. But my memory of Berlin is not at all that\ngood. However, when I moved back to be with my family in Breslau, when I came\nback to Breslau, I have a much better memory of that place.",
        "A: Actually, I don\u2019t even remember that. I think there must have been -- there must\nhave been, but I cannot visually pinpoint it as to where I might have seen it. My\ngrandmother, I am sure took me only to places that were permitted. It was\ninteresting, my uncle, my mother\u2019s younger brother went to Israel. He wanted very\nmuch to emigrate to Israel and in 1935 or th -- \u201936, he went to Israel and had a\nmarvelous experience and wanted very, very much to go and settle there. He saw the\nhandwriting on the wall and he wanted -- he had a chance to buy into Egged, the bus\ncompany. And my grandmother did not want to leave Berlin and she would not give\nhim the money, although it was there in spades. The consequence was that Ludz did\nnot go to Israel, had a terrible time leaving Germany, and my grandmother didn\u2019t\nmake it at all. There was a wonderful opportunity where the wrong turn was taken.\nYou ask did I see much evidence? I just really honestly cannot recall. Mm, I can\u2019t.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have memories of my parents visiting me at all because they were in the\nthroes of moving and setting up a practice and trying to start getting things ready for\nJune 23, 2005\na possible chance to -- to emigrate. My mother was very reluctant to emigrate. She\nwanted more than -- she was sure this was all going to blow over. My father knew\nbetter, or he -- he did indeed know better. He was sure that it wouldn\u2019t and so at that\npoint they were putting feelers out to see what might happen and what ha -- in effect\nhappened was my father, being a physician was contacted by a number of countries\nin South America who were opening their doors to physicians particularly. And it\nwas either Uruguay or Paraguay, and I\u2019m sh -- not sure that I remember, but one of\nthe -- one of those two countries that made a most attractive offer, but my father, not\nSpanish speaking, not having had too much contact with the Spanish speaking\npopulation decided that might not be for him. He also did not want to go to Israel, I\nmight add. He was not at all set on going to Israel. But in the meantime, this\nwonderful telegram showed up, the one that really saved us when we were able to\nestablish a family -- a blood connection to someone who lived in Canada. The\nquestion 1s, could we get into Canada, because Canada had a very tight quota. You\nmight know the -- the book, 6,000 is too many and indeed I don\u2019t even think that\nthey got 6,000, or allowed 6,000 in. But an -- at any rate, perhaps this is not what I --\nwhat I should be -- yeah. So my father turned down Uruguay or Paraguay, turned\ndown Israel, but was absolutely positive that we had to leave. And so my mother\ndecided she better learn how to do something. And so my mother, who was a singer\nJune 23, 2005\nand a lady who entertained beautifully and who was a -- a homemaker at heart\ndecided that she would study and did study under ORT auspices, and studied\nphysiotherapy. She had always loved a -- gym and exercise and physical culture and\nso on. Right up her alley, and she, in Breslau went to school and studied\nphysiotherapy. And really, in effect, this step did keep body and soul together once\nwe did come to Canada. And she loved what she was doing, and she did it for many\n-- well, for a number of years. So that was while I was in Berlin, she also started on\nthat and got -- got into class and worked.",
        "A: My parents were not Zionists. You know, in Germany there was the big schism,\nthe blue and white and the black and white. He did not belong to the blue and white,\nalthough that changed too. I mean, he was the strongest supporter of Israel that\nanybody could wish for, but at the time of our move he thought he could not take the\nweather in Israel. That was why.",
        "A: Actually, when he went to school, and he went to school at the university in\nBreslau after he came back from the war, he studied neu-neurology and psychiatry,\nJune 23, 2005\nthat was a -- a study that always went hand in hand. And then he went for\nspecialized work to Munich and studied in Munich for awhile before he actually\nwent into practice. He dealt mostly with adult patients and he did some very early\nwork on mescaline, which became a drug a -- that was used for, I believe\nrecreational, but it was a -- a very potent drug and he wrote one of the first papers on\nmescaline. And he also dealt with bromism, which I\u2019m not sure I really understand.\nAnd then he got very interested and very involved with electric shock therapy, and\nwas exceedingly successful with electroshock until it was sort of downplayed, and\nwas not used any more. And now things have come back and they are using electric\nshock therapy, under perhaps better circumstances because of the muscle relaxants\nand things that go with it. But my father was exceedingly successful. I always felt he\nwas out of favor with the establishment because his basis, from the earliest of all\ntimes he said, we will find biochemical and biologic basis for mental problems and\ndiseases of the mind. And of course when Freud became so popular, he was not at\nall in the swing. And he stuck to his guns and I think the world has changed. He was\nmore of a Jungian. He was extremely interested in what Jung had to tell us. And he\nreally felt, and I think he was -- h-he -- it -- it came to pass that his way of thinking\nwas quite right, quite on the ball. And he worked until he was -- worked 1n his\nprofession until he was 80 years old. And at that point in time he felt he couldn\u2019t\nJune 23, 2005\nkeep up with all the new medications and then decided that this was -- this was not,\nyou know, good for the patient. But he was quite successful in his -- in his work and\nhe loved every minute of it. He was the sort of person who, if somebody in the\nprovince, in New Brunswick when we came to Canada, was ill and needed his\nhelp, he got into his car and drove 300 miles without batting an eye. If the patient\nneeded him, he was there. He made housecalls.",

        "A: Ah yes, I moved back to Breslau and I was started in the Jewish school in\nBreslau, Raydia ar -- school and all children there were Jewish. All, or most\neveryone was trying to leave and -- and I think everybody\u2019s mind was such that --\nJune 23, 2005\nthat we were il -- we were losing people every day in school. I went to Raydia\nshula, it was a Jewish school. It was a sizeable Jewish school, much bigger than my\nschool in Ratibor, certainly ba -- much bigger than the one in Berlin, which was a\nsmall, little independent school. This was a large school, and almost all the children\nthere were being prepared, really, to leave the country. Hebrew was very big in the\ncurriculum and I was painfully inadequate. I did not like the school. I only made two\nfriends while I was in school and it was -- 1t was a very unhappy time of my life. My\nfather started his new practice and my grandmother -- my grandmother was having\nto rent out more rooms so that things would go reasonably well. She was made to\ngive up the store at the point of a gun. This beautiful store, this beautiful toy shop,\nthe biggest one in the entire province of Siles -- of Silesia, where people came from\nall over to buy. In fact, the people who had the guta, the large farms, these enormous\nfarms would bring their families in at Christmastime to do their shopping at Garson\nFrankel. That was the name of the store, was the name actually of my great-\ngrandfather. The store had been in the family since 1826 and my grandmother was\nrunning it with her sister because both had lost their husbands, and they were made\nto sell it, as I say, because it was taken over. And I even have a clipping to the effect\nthat it\u2019s now Aryan, a big clipping from the newspaper. So she took in borders into\nher big, beautiful home and everybody got along very well. But it was not as it was\nJune 23, 2005\nbefore. Still, she was able to have help in the house because help was still allowed to\nwork. It was later that the help was not allowed to work for Jewish people any more,\nbut at that time, in that place, there was help.",
        "A: I believe they were. I do believe they were. The house was one, two -- four\nstories high and the lowest part had the servant quarters of the gardener, which\nbecame our apartment. It was on the lowest level, the entry level and there were\nlovely shrubs around it. I remember there were lilacs that smelled so beautifully, and\nLilies of the Valley. Had a large iron gate that opened up to allow cars to move in.\nWe di -- she did not -- we did not have a car. My father had his motorcycle, never\ndrove a car until he came to Canada. And then there was the rote deala. That was a\nred foyer where when people came to visit, left their coats before being shown\nupstairs. And that was, of course, my favorite place to play because everything was\nso beautiful. Red satin or velvet or plush, very beautiful, with a bay window looking\nout into the shrubs. And then the back or side part of it had a huge kitchen. It was\nnot a kitchen for cooking though, it was an area to do the laundry. And every week\nthe laundresses came in and that was always great fun for me because they would\nhand wash everything on boards and then they would rinse it and then dry them, and\nthen at the end of the day the two of them would take the sheets, one standing at one\nJune 23, 2005\nend, one at the other and they would pull them in order to dry them completely and\nmy greatest joy was to stand underneath in the middle and have my hair fly up into\nthe sheets. It was such a joy and it was so much fun. That was so much fun. We had\na lovely gardener who took care of the garden, which had a walk all around it so that\none could stroll around a central green area. And then the borders were all peonies\nand roses and lovely shade flowers and tall trees. And then there was a small garden\narch that led into the fruits and vegetable gardens. And we had gooseberries. Never\nsee gooseberries any more. And red and white currants and raspberries and apple\ntrees and peach trees. It was -- it was a paradise, it was absolutely lovely, and the\ngardener worked hard to do -- to keep it so.

        "A: Once my grandmother was found and was able to establish contact with a distant\nrelative who had emigrated to Canada much earlier, and I wish I could tell you\nexactly when, I don\u2019t ec -- but, at any rate, he was a blood relative and action was\ntaken to try to contact him and see whether he could, in any way help out. His\nresponse was immediate and he said he could, of course try to help out but not\nmonetarily because it was in the late 30\u2019s and Canada was still reeling, as the\nStates, I know must have been after the depression, and really no one had much of\nanything. He -- Uncle Charlie, his name was Charlie Redlish, had established a\nsmall institute where he treated alcoholics. And it was very small and he ran it by\nhimself with one nurse. But he apparently was successful enough, but I don\u2019t think\nwas getting paid exceedingly well because he and his wife and his married daughter\nand unmarried daughter, all -- an-and son and his wife all had to live together in one\nflat just to be able to make it. But he was instrumental in getting things going and\nvery fortunately, his daughter Fay Redlish had a friend who was extremely well-to-\ndo. He was in the manufacturing business of men\u2019s suits, and at the time just before\nthe war, was starting to get contracts for army uniforms, and apparently had an in\npolitically speaking. And Jack took it upon himself, and I think I\u2019m right in saying\nthis, that he went up to Ottawa to see whether there was some way of expediting\nbringing us into Canada. Well, Canada had the law, of course, that only farmers\nJune 23, 2005\nand physicians could come in, and the other law, the law stated that they, if after a\nyear\u2019s time, the person could not make it on their own in Canada, they would be\nsent back. So it was a trial run, so to speak. In addition to fulfilling that, the person\nalso had to bring 3200 dollars with them, which at that point in time I guess must\nhave been a fair amount of money. And it took many months to actually get the\npermission to come, and once the permission was granted there was an awful lot to\ngo through as far as the Canadian authorities were concerned, but as far as the\nGerman authorities were concerned. Because they were on our tails constantly about\nsigning this paper and that paper. And during that period of time, many people were\ncalled to the police stations and never returned. This was a time in \u00b036 - \u00b037, when\npeople were called on unbelievably small details to their leaving and to their lives,\nthey were called, and they were made to jump off buildings. And this happened\nindeed, to friends of ours. Well, I think I can tell you, one day my father was called.\nWe were trembling, I think all day long, but he was one of the lucky ones. He signed\nwhatever he needed to sign and pay whatever he needed to pay and he came back. In\nthe meantime we were granted permission and a van was ordered to pack up our\nthings. And I think it\u2019s interesting to mention that we were allowed to bring things\nwith us that had been -- that were old things. So my grandmother suggested that we\ntake her furniture because that could be certified as being old. I don\u2019t know how -- I\nJune 23, 2005\n-- | know it was 10 years on suits because my father had to go to his tailor and tell\nhim to put labels into his suits which indicated when they were made, and he did.\nBut the van was -- as I say, was ordered and some of the old pieces were packed and\n-- and put in, but nothing of their modern furniture could come with them, it -- it was\nonly the old things, which -- which was fine. But when we were packing -- and my\nfather ha-had a terrific library, and a wonderful stamp collection, and when the\nactual packing took place, the Nazi, with their guns came, and they stood over us as\nwe were doing the packing. And I remember very, very well, we were in our little\ndownstairs gardener\u2019s apartment with lots and lots of boxes on the floor, these two\nmen with guns watching as my father packed all the books. And whenever they liked\na book -- an they particularly liked my children\u2019s books, they just helped\nthemselves. And they helped themselves to some of my father\u2019s stamps too, and\nthere wasn\u2019t a thing we could do about it. And I remember my father putting his\nhand to his mouth and saying shh. It was just, that\u2019s the way it was done. Well, he\nstill came over with a lot of books and I did come over with some children\u2019s books,\nbut I think my best ones didn\u2019t come with me. That\u2019s all right. But it was just, you\nknow, the situation. Also, for example, it\u2019s interesting; in that same apartment where\nwe were packing the books, we were also taking our food, because we were not\nallowed to eat with our grandmother upstairs. We had to eat separately. I mean, the\nJune 23, 2005\nlittle downstairs apartment was like an independently organized apartment. They\nwere allowed to bring the food down to us, but we couldn\u2019t eat it together with them\nupstairs. All the boarders could eat upstairs and my grandmother could eat upstairs,\nbut we couldn\u2019t, and we had to eat downstairs.",

There\nwasn\u2019t much of that either. I think the times were so desperate. My mother went to\nclass and came home. But I have to add this, because this I think is very important.\nMy parents both decided it was -- would be good if they took English lessons. And\nso they found out that there was a man, an Englishman who was settled in Breslau,\nwho was giving lessons to people who were leaving the country. My parents decided\nto also study English, as many of their friends were, a-and they went to the home of\nsomebody who had come from England and who was doing something other than\ngiving English lessons. But he gave English lessons on the side, and he gave them in\nthe evening, and my parents decided to take them. And first they walked into his\nhome, and he\u2019s -- they were sitting at his desk, he with his back to a huge picture of\nMr. Moseby. And who is Mr. Moseby? He was the Nazi of England. He was the\nJune 23, 2005\nemissary there. Well, my mother and father said, we\u2019ve got to learn English, we\u2019ve\ngot to face Moseby, and they went ahead and did and just disliked the occasion\nterribly but liked their teacher. Their teacher was a very good teacher and a very nice\nperson. So they never could understand why Moseby was there, but he was there.",
        "A: Yes, they took their English lessons and they did rather well and at least got a\nlittle bit of a foundation and developed their hearing skills and along with taking the\n-- along with taking the ORT group, my father also learned how to concoct beauty\npreparations. He learned how to make cold creams and vanishing creams and\nmoisturizing creams and all sorts of things practical. And this stood us in very good\nstead, actually. And he bought jars, beautifully designed jars and labels for the jars,\nso -- in English -- so that they could be at -- affixed to the jars that perhaps might be\nof -- of use on immi -- on immigration. So that was a time when you asked what did\npeople do, my parents were very busy, taking classes and doing very practical\nthings.",
        "A: I knew, yes. I knew that we were going to leave. When my mother -- when my\nfather finally persuaded my mother that we had no alternative, she came around to it\nand of course I knew, because of the papers that needed signing and the\nJune 23, 2005\ndocumentation that needed to be gotten and the visits to ready ourselves, yes. And of\ncourse, when the furniture was being packed, I think it was very clear. It was very --\na very difficult time for my grandmother, because unfortunately we could not bring\nher with us. The Canadian government put an age limit on those whom they would\npermit. And of course, she was not a trained person, either a farmer or a physician,\nso she -- on her own she would not be able to go. And she could not come as a\nmember of the family, much to the everlasting sadness that my father went through.\nHe was an only child and he was very close to his mother, and I think he suffered\nterribly, just the fact that she had to stay behind.",
        "A: Her name was Hedwig, Frankel was her maiden name, Fischer. And the store\u2019s\nname was Garson Frankel, it was her father\u2019s and that family\u2019s store. She was a\ngood business lady, she was very interested in genealogy. In fact, I\u2019ve just put\ntogether lots and lots of genealogic data, much of which she wrote down in German\nscript. And since there are not too many of us left who can still re-read German\nscript, I thought I\u2019d best do that, and I\u2019ve done it and I am so glad because it has\nopened up all sorts of interesting new avenues to investigate.

I can\nlook that up, I -- that I don\u2019t know exactly. But she was the -- it -- it was so much\nfun visiting her when I was a little girl because she read stories to me and she\nintroduced me to handwork. She did beautiful tatting and beautiful crocheting and I\nstill have collars that she made me, which I have put into tissue paper, and have kept\na tablecloth that she made for my mother, and just lovely handiwork.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that I had any choice, because they could not buy things new for me,\nso I had to take what I had. And for themselves they couldn\u2019t either, so we went with\nwhat we had, we couldn\u2019t really prepare in that sense, at all.",
        "A: Nope.",
        "A: Well, I remember taking leave from my grandmother -- my grandmother in\nBerlin, we said goodbye to earlier on. When we moved to -- I think she came to visit\nus and we said goodbye then. My grandmother in Breslau, with whom we stayed,\nJune 23, 2005\nwe said goodbye and -- and it was a very -- it was a very quiet time. And I remember\nthat one of the people who rented rooms from my grandmother was a pianist, and he\nplayed one of Chopin\u2019s etudes. And to this day, when I hear that etude, the tears\ncome -- welled up in -- welled up in my eyes. This -- there was not much to say. I\nthink we all knew that this would be the last time and we were taking leave. It was --\nit was tough, very tough. I don\u2019t remember how we got to where we went, I mean to\nthe station, but I know we went by train. I don\u2019t know how we got there. We went\nby train from Breslau to Hamburg and in Hamburg we had to undergo medical\nchecks with a Canadian doctor. And that was not a nice experience, but 1t was done.\nMy mother, who very early in her life developed glaucoma, she was in her 40\u2019s, she\nthinks that the doctor who examined her, Canadian doctor who examined her, might\nhave had a suspicion that there was something there, but he didn\u2019t let on. All she\nremembers is that she was forever getting her eyes examined. Now, she was an\nundiagnosed glaucoma [indecipherable], so imagine if she had had the glaucoma 10\nyears before and they would have told her about it, she might never have gone blind.\nBecause she did eventually become blind. But yes, we passed our exams, our\nphysicals.",

        "A: Yes, yes, she was. But it was -- you know, I was a little girl, nine years old. It was\nnot -- it wasn\u2019t my doctor, the one that I was used to, and being patted all over by a\nstrange person who was not -- whose language I didn\u2019t understand, was not a happy\nsituation.",
        "A: Well, I figure it must have been June, or July. June or July. My mother\u2019s brother\ncame to see us off -- I mean, came to Hamburg to see us before we took our leave,\nand oh well, we were hoping that we would see each other again. And we did.",
        "A: But it was very iffy, because he hadn\u2019t gotten permission to leave Germany, and\nit was late 30\u2019s -- mid-30\u2019s.",
        "A: Yes, they did, and they -- I could -- you know, interestingly enough, they didn\u2019t\nhave to tell me. There was so much electricity 1n the air, just our every day routine.\nJune 23, 2005\nAnd hearing particularly what was happening, through the maids, who went out and\ndid their shopping and who went and -- to church. We always were aware of what\npeople were thinking and what they were talking about. I think it came -- it came as\na bit of a shock, I think. But then my father -- by that time my father had already\nmade up his mind to go, and I think that reinforced his judgment. It was just such a\nnerve-wracking time to be there. One had to watch ones P\u2019s and Q\u2019s so carefully.\nDidn\u2019t say anything in public, didn\u2019t have an -- you know, even -- even when --\nwhen you went for little walks, you\u2019d look around and sort of make sure that nobody\nwas hearing your conversation. It was fraught with -- with all sorts of intangible,\nunpleasant things.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I wasn\u2019t on the street long enough, really. I -- I was fairly well\nsheltered. I don\u2019t -- that I don\u2019t recall. But I recall the dinner conversations when so\nand so was asked to come up to the Gestapo and so and so lost his business and such\nand such a person was asked for extra documentation, which of course they didn\u2019t\nhave. And it was -- it was just an unsure and uncertain and nerve-wracking time.\nAnd I think my mother, who was a bit of an insomniac must have suffered terribly.\nBut you know, life continued and it\u2019s amazing that it does, but it did. And bi -- after\nHamburg and having the medical exam and seeing our -- my Uncle Ludz, we were\nJune 23, 2005\nput on the train and we left for -- for Holland first, on our way to England. And I\ndon\u2019t remember the day that it was, but it must have been -- 1t was in the summer of\n1938, and we were on the train from Hamburg to Hoek van Holland, which was\nthe port, the seaport in Holland, before getting on the little peanut boat to\nGreenwich. And I remember we had second class tickets. My father had gotten\nthose and we were to get on the train and we were entering the second class carriage\nwhen somebody came waving a paper. Dr. Fischer, Dr. Fischer, would you kindly\nmove over into the first class carriage? My father said he had second class tickets.\nYes, but 1t would -- it would be better if we went into the first class carriage. I\nremember it so vividly, but the second class carriage had red leather seats, and first\nclass carriage had green velvet seats. I was dressed -- what is it, to the sevens? To\nthe fours?",
        "A: To the nines, well okay, I was very nicely dressed with while gloves. I remember\nmy mother slipping several rings on my fingers and telling me to keep my gloves on,\nwhich I did. But we were ushered into this very nice carriage and sat with not too\nmany people, whereas the other carriage was very, very full, and we came to the\nborder and I know we came to the border because there was my father, knowing\nexactly at what time that train was leaving Germany and getting into Holland,\nJune 23, 2005\nbecause he was waiting to be out of the clutches. Just before the border, the stop\nbefore the border, the train stopped. Second class carriage people left the train. We\nwent on without many of second class carriage people. Pll never forget it. I will\nnever forget it. And my father to this day said, we were that lucky because of the\nEnglish teacher with Moseby\u2019s picture in back. He was trying to help people out of\nGermany in whatever way they could. My father said he was very interested in\nknowing what trains we were taking. And really, my mother and father both, many,\nmany times had said, if it hadn\u2019t been for the English teacher, we might not have\ngotten out of second class carriage. So we crossed the border. I remember\neverybody, we three, just hugging each other, crying and making our way over to\nHoek van Holland and getting on our little boat. My father and I got very sick\ncrossing the English channel. My mother, the good rider -- or sailor I should say, had\nno problems whatsoever, as she did on the voyage across the Atlantic as well. And\nwe landed in Greenwich -- or Harwich -- Harwich. S-Sorry, Harwich [| think it\nwas. H-a-r-w-i-c-h. Yeah, Harwich. And from there we took the train to London.\nAnd in London my father had made arrangements for us to stay 1n a very nice hotel,\nwhich we have since visited. And we stayed there and h-he had fraternity brothers in\nLondon and his cousin was in -- no, his cousin wasn\u2019t there yet. But the fraternity\nbrothers were in London and we had a few very nice days in London until about\nJune 23, 2005\nthree days before we were to sail to Canada, I came down with appendicitis. Had to\ngo to the hospital emergency. Where did they take me? To the German hospital. Had\nto have my appendix removed, and fate again, fate unbelievable. I was on the\noperating table, about ready to have my appendix removed when the young surgeon\nwho came and was about to do the job said, oh, and what\u2019s your name and where are\nyou from, and said, is your father a physician? Yes. And we -- we established the\nfact that my father was a physician, and he said, he helped me out in my final exam.\nI told this story to my father. He said, you know, he was trying to keep calm, but\nsure enough, my father slipped him some answers when he was taking his final\nexam. And this was the doctor who took out my appendix. But I had to stay in\nhospital for a week, I guess it is. I was very well looked after, but 1t was a German\nhospital. And I suppose it was good that I was there because I understood what was\ngoing on, and they understood what I -- and af -- we had to miss our boat to\nCanada, and that was the difficult part.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nJune 23, 2005\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",

I -- I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t think of other toys. I did bring card games. Some\ngames and some puzzles. And I have the card games, they were quartets and they\nwere quartets dealing with authors and with flowers and with comics. Very funny\ncomics from the newspaper, but they were in sets of fours. And also cards with\nletters so that one could make Scrabble words, but all as cards. Small, small things.\nBut I think that\u2019s all. Maybe a chessboard.",
        "A: I recuperated, and my father of course, had to scout around to find a new -- a\nvoyage for us across the ocean and it was close to September and the visitors were\nreturning back to Canada after vacationing in Europe. It was a particularly busy\ntime of the year because the teachers were coming home on their trips and it was -- it\nwas a bit of a -- of -- of a difficulty. However, the Canadian embassy could not have\nbeen nicer. They found my folks a place to stay because staying at a hotel was too\nexpensive, and they settled them in somebody\u2019s home in Golders Green, which is a\nf -- well-known Jewish community, and perhaps not so far away from the hospital\neither. And they arranged, through the Jewi -- with the help of the Jewish Aid\nSociety in London to get us a later boat over and we came over on the Montrose,\nJune 23, 2005\nwhich was a slightly smaller ship than we were supposed to come on, but they had\nroom for the three of us and we had a good voyage across the sea. At least my\nmother had a good voyage. My father and I took it downstairs. We were -- he and I\nwere quite seasick. Not that it was such a hazardous journey at -- according to the\ninformation that I got from pier 21, it was a rather smooth journey, but our stomachs\ndid not know that. My mother played ping pong onboard and we were downstairs.",
        "A: No, there were not. There were -- I don\u2019t think there were -- I -- as far as I know\nthere were none, and I have the -- I have the entire list of the people in our class,\ntourist class, and we did not see Jewish names at all. Most of them, as I say, were\nreturning visitors to Europe. Did not at all. We did have iceberg practice and we all\ngot into our assigned jackets and had to parade out. And we were very close to an\niceberg. I think it\u2019s as close as I'd like to get to an iceberg. But it was a drill, and of\ncourse everybody took part. There was a very nice party, I\u2019m told, at the end of the\nride. I don\u2019t think my parents were in -- in a partying mood, but there was a party.\nAnd I should mention to you that the last day, the day that we were supposed to --\nthat we did in fact land in Montreal, I woke up and could not move. I had total\nparalysis of both my legs and my father had to carry me off the boat. This happened\ntwice in my life. This was the first time, and the second time it happened when, as a\nJune 23, 2005\nstudent in 1948, I had the -- and I was on an international student service seminar, I\nhad the opportunity to go back to Germany and the same thing happened. I woke up\nparalyzed from my waist down. The paralysis did not last very long. My father\ncarried me off the boat. The relatives were there to meet us. And in a day the\nparalysis was gone. I think they call this a hysterical paralysis, which it undoubtedly\nwas. Terribly frightened.",

        "A: Well, I think the telegram was sort of the lynchpin, if you will.

It was a\ntelegram that was sent to send congratulations to the wedding of and the mishpoka\nof the grandparent, my grandparents. And my grandmother kept that telegram, as she\nkept many, many things, and remembered in the 30\u2019s that there was somebody in\nCanada who was distantly related.

        "A: I missed my friends, I missed my grandmothers. I don\u2019t know that I missed the\nphysical part of Germany. I think at that age perhaps that\u2019s not so important, but I\ncertainly missed my friends. It was so much -- there was so much to learn and so\nmuch new, and so much to catch up with. It -- the impressions came so hard and so\nfast and they were so different. Coming from -- coming from a home, for example,\nas we were lucky enough to have, with servants and whatnot to a one room that we\nstayed in. We had one room and that -- that was it. It was a -- a new lifestyle, but\nyou know, my -- my mother particularly was quite adventuresome. My father\nbecame very depressed. My father, who was unable to find work because they\nwouldn\u2019t let him work, was in a -- sort of a desperate situation and as the war years\ncame along, it became even more so. Because remember, in Canada, the war started\nJune 23, 2005\nSeptember the third, 1939. We were at war exactly a year from the date we arrived\nin Canada. My father tried to join the army, they wouldn\u2019t have him because he\nwasn\u2019t a citizen. He wanted to join the medical corps, they wouldn\u2019t have him\nbecause he wasn\u2019t registered as a medic in Canada and you couldn\u2019t become a\nmedic in Canada until you took up citizenship. And so all -- everything was closed,\nand his main concern was trying to get the grandmothers over. And he had\nabsolutely no luck in that department. I know he traveled back and forth to Ottawa\ntrying to persuade the powers that be, the natio -- the commissioner of refugees, a\nwonderful woman by the name of Senator Karen Wilson, to see if there was some\nway of getting the grandparents out, even if it would be over at the Dominican\nRepublics, or Cuba, but even that door seemed to be closed because of their ages.\nAnd my father was making creams at that point and my mother, fortunately got a job\nand worked very hard. She fortunately met a physician through friends, I guess, or\nfamily, Canadian family, in Montreal, who was very interested in the fact that she\nwas able to do physiotherapy, which was not done a whole lot on this side of the\nocean. And she was very well trained and it was a period of the polio epidemic\nstarting. And also, she did post-operative -- broken legs and things like that, she\nworked with patients and so on. And she really had a lot of work. She -- she e --\nwell, in time she even -- we even got an apartment that had a basement in it, a\nJune 23, 2005\nfinished basement in which she gave classes, gym classes, and then the rest of the\napartment was rented out to different people -- different rooms. And she -- she did\nvery well and -- because my father couldn\u2019t work. But he was invited by Dr. Wilder\nPennfield and Dr. Cohen at the Neurological Institute in Montreal, which 1s a very\nwell known place, to come on rounds and to hone his skills and to get the English\nlingo. And he did that, and in time he met someone who asked him to become an\nintern in a hospital in the Maritime provinces of Canada, where the medical people\nleft in order to join the army. So a place became available where they really needed\nhis skills, and he -- he worked there until -- until someone said, why do you have\nthis enemy alien working for the Ca-Canadian government? And he went through a\nhorrible period of time in which his life was made miserable by the powers that be\nbecause he was -- they considered him as an enemy alien who -- whom they\nsuspected of being a farmer and a spy. He -- the Mounties came to visit him one day\nand he said, take the cameras, because they were afraid that he was photographing\ninstallations on the shore -- 0-0 -- the seacoast of New Brunswick, which was where\nhis job was. He went to New Brunswick to take on the job, my mother and I stayed\nin Montreal so that she could continue working. And as an intern, you know, it\u2019s\nhardly enough to support a family, so they -- we lived in separate places for awhile,\nfor a number of years. But he even weathered that, and I came across some of the\nJune 23, 2005\nclippings in the newspaper in getting ready to talk to you just the other day and I\ndidn\u2019t realize the splash that all this made in the newspapers across Canada, that,\nyou know, the government was employing enemy aliens to -- who were taking\nadvantage and taking the money from our people. So you come from Germany, you\ncome to Canada -- and of course, I was called a dirty Jew from Germany in school\nin Canada, where you know, the blinders were close to the head. And it was not an\neasy time in Canada. It was not.",

        "A: My world was totally consumed with the war. My father used to keep a map on\nthe wall and punch pins into where the Germans were, and especially once the war\nJune 23, 2005\nstarted, how the movements of the Germans were taking place, how the forces were\nprogressing, both into the east zone towards Russia, as well as out to -- through\nFrance and into Holland. And we would listen to news every night, of course, and\nas many times during the day as, you know, as there were news on, which wasn\u2019t\nalways our time. I mean, the news came on at seven o\u2019clock and everybody was\nsitting around. And I think it was the most trying of times because my father was\ntrying to tell people in Canada what was happening and nobody listened. My father\nbrought out clippings from newspapers, German newspapers that he hid in slatted\nareas of his suitcases. He hid them in the linings of the suitcases, to show the powers\nthat be on this side of the ocean what was happening because nobody was listening\nand nobody wanted to believe what was going on. Fortunately, he did not get caught,\nbecause when he was called one time to the police station -- and he was called many\ntimes -- he was very afraid that they might have found something because he was\nclipping, he was clipping newspaper articles right and left.",

And what I\u2019m trying to find out at this point in\ntime 1s whether he might have been one of the Ritchie boys. The Ritchie boys, the\nGerman Jewish people who came over who became interpreters and who were sent\nback to Germany in the army to help with language things. Because he did indeed\ngo into the army and became an interpreter and stayed in Germany after the war had\nfinished to help with the -- with translations for the Nuremberg Trials.

I don\u2019t know\nthat we knew the particulars, but I do know that my father said, and they didn\u2019t burn\npart of that synagogue because there were stores around the synagogue that were in\nhands of Germans, close to the wall around or near the synagogue. So part of the\nbuilding was destroyed, and part of 1t was not. But the [indecipherable] synagogue,\nwhich 1s the one that my parents and grandparent went 1n -- we-were in -- were\nmembers of and where my grandparents had pews, strangely enough next to each\nother, we know that that -- we knew that that synagogue was badly damaged in part.\nAnd the pictures have borne that out. They\u2019re in the process of restoring that\nsynagogue at this point in time, but what I learned -- what we learned, and of course\nto the horror of everyone, oh we -- we learned through the radio and then also I\nJune 23, 2005\nbelieve there must have been notification by mail as to what -- what was damaged.\nInterestingly enough, I think that my father and his mother probably had sort of an\nunderstanding of what was going to be said in a -- in a code sort of way, as to the\nsituation.",

She wrote that she needed some tea, would we be able to send\nher some tea, and that was the last -- that was the last letter that we ever received\nfrom her. And in all the letters, 1t was a little bit upbeat, in I am very well, but -- or --\nor Iam very well, and then period, and then could you possibly send me some tea.\nAnd we knew that that was a very bad sign.

        "A: Well, in our Canadian schools, a lot of English guest children came over and so\nwe had many guest children in our classes. People who opted to send their kids\noverseas until the end of the war. And I had a very, very dear friend, Monya\nWilliams was her name and we stayed in touch for awhile after she went back home.\nAnd life in Canada, as life was here was -- had rationing, we had a lot of rationing. I\nthink you probably had more rationing than we did, but it was as my mother always\nused to say, this isn\u2019t rationing. She went through the first World War, and she said\nthis was just equalizing things out. It was, you know, very, very little rationing per\nse. Nobody ever went hungry. And during the war -- a-as a child during the war I\nrolled bandages. I went down to Red Cross headquarters on Saturdays and I helped\nserved coffee. My mother also w-worked for the Red Cross at the -- at the blood\ndonating centers. I work -- I -- I helped when we had service personnel come to the\nJewish u -- like a USO. We went and we washed dishes and we served sandwiches\nJune 23, 2005\nto the young soldiers who were coming through. And this was a little bit later on,\nthis was when the soldiers were coming through the Maritime provinces to get on\nthe ships to send them overseas. The Jewish lads had a place to come to to dance and\nto write letters and just to have a good time, and we teenagers were allowed to help\nand that was always -- that was very nice. I had a job very early on. I tried to get a\njob in Montreal painting signs, but they thought maybe 11 was too young to get a jo\n-- to give anybody a job. But I used to sometimes walk to Sunday school -- to\nHebrew school. I did go to Hebrew school in Montreal, we went to Shaar\nHashomayim, which is a very beautiful, large synagogue and I had Hebrew twice a\nweek and I had Sunday school, but most of the time I either walked, or more than\nlikely I took the tram, 1f I wasn\u2019t lucky enough to get a ride in the Bronsman car.\nNow, the Bronsman kids, Charlie and Edgar were classmates of mine at Shaar\nHashomayim, and they had a -- a driver who drove them back and forth from class\nto Hebrew school, and once in awhile we got rides with them, and that was very nice\nbecause they had chocolate milk on the cars and the rest of us usually just got white\nmilk. And my mother, as a matter of fact, in her -- in her physiotherapy capacity\nmassaged -- gave massages to Mrs. Bronsman. And I remember very well in\nMontreal my mother did the Bronsman job, I guess once a week and she would\nhave to walk, because of course she didn\u2019t have a car and the streetcar or the bus\nJune 23, 2005\nwould only carry her so far, and she would have to walk up Westmount. Now mind\nyou, the Bronsmans lived up on the very top of the hill and there certainly wasn\u2019t a\n-- a bus going up there. And so she marched in the cold of winter. And Montreal\ncan be very icy in wintertime and she got such chilblains, and I remember she came\nhome, her legs were just so cold. I remember weeping and thinking how she was\nsuffering. And I asked her about it a number of years back and I said, Mother, I used\nto cry so, because I was so unhappy that you had such hard work. And she said oh,\nshe said, you know, I look back on this and she said it was such a good time. It was\nthe only time in my life, when we lived in Montreal, where I was an independent\nwoman and where I carried the family on my shoulders, and she said that was very\nsatisfying. I go -- I -- I\u2019ve mulled that over many, many times, and indeed it was.\nShe did wonderful work in -- in her capacity as therapist.",

I still recall exactly where these encounters took place, and they\nwere not in sight of the teachers, they were when we were having recess, either\nplaying marbles, or downstairs. On very cold days we were -- we were just mulling\naround and sitting on the benches and so on for -- for a little time out. And it wasn\u2019t\nthe boys as much as the girls that were nasty. But maybe girls are nastier to each\nother anyway.",
        "A: Probably not. I don\u2019t know. Probably not, I think -- I think I just did not want\nthem to worry about things more than they did. They had -- they had so many\nworries on their shoulders. My father, who couldn\u2019t work and who wanted so much\nto work. And y -- no -- you know, no money coming in. My mother, who worked so\nhard, and nothing in the offing for my father and that must have been, to the kind of\nperson that he was, a tremendous blow. And -- however, he had a fantastic sense of\nhumor all -- all his life, and I think maybe it even helped him then when things\nlooked so bleak. And I think the frustration that he carried within him, having so\nmuch information, wanting to tell people -- he even was in touch with a writer from\nthe newspaper who was the son of somebody who knew somebody, you know,\ncloser, and not just the man on the street. And nobody wanting to believe. I think\nthat must have been so frustrating.\nJune 23, 2005",

And maybe not by choice, but I was made\nto feel Jewish. Not that, you know, not that I wouldn\u2019t say I was Jewish, but I think\nyes, I think I was made to feel Jewish. I remember a sad thing. I was walking in\nfront of a shop one day, looking at some baked goods in the bakery store, Id --\nwould feast my eyes on all these good, good things. And there was my father, I\ndidn\u2019t realize that he was in back of me, looking at me -- so he tells me, and I\u2019m sure\nit\u2019s true -- with not enough change in his pocket to buy me the little roll that I\nwanted, that I would have liked to have had. It -- I think, you know, these are such\nsmall things in the scheme of things, but such humiliating and -- and depressing\nreactions. I mean, I think of it often. I\u2019m sure he never thought of it that much any\nmore after the fact. He was a realist, 1t couldn\u2019t happen at that point. I, on the other\nhand, internalized the whole thing. And -- yeah.",

Made good friends.\nAnd then, of course, I was in Montreal only fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh -- four years\nJune 23, 2005\nin Montreal and then we moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where my father\ngot the job as an intern, but we were not able to join him until the four years were\nover and h-he was able to get an apartment and get enough money to support us,\nbecause my mother did not work after we came to Saint John.",
        "A: And we stayed in Saint John -- well, I was married in Saint John. So I think my\nparents moved in 1955. My father got his citizenship in 1945 or \u201946, and then took\nhis Dominion Council exams and passed his exams so that he could go into practice,\nwhich he did, and then he be -- he became a diabetic and had some physical\nproblems and so it was thought that he should give up private practice and go into a\nhospital situation, which he did in Halifax, Nova Scotia. And it was a psychiatric\nhospital there, and he was in charge of all the woman patients, I think, at that\nhospital. And he stayed there until he retired and he was -- that was \u201978, I guess. So\nhe was there quite a number of years and they made a very happy life in Halifax.\nSaint John was a very small town, little in-bred. I mean, it was very small in every\nway. And moving to Halifax was really a nice thing for them to do because first of\nall it was a beautiful city and then it had the stimulation of having a university there.\nTwo, as a matter -- three -- three universities, with a lot of cultural things going in,\nwhich they loved. And they got a house on the Dartmouth side of the -- of the city\nJune 23, 2005\nand then they joined us. When my father -- when my father retired, he wanted to\nmove Mom and himself down to Knoxville, which they did. They came and they\njoined us in Knoxville and were there a couple of years when my husband was\ncalled by the NIH to come and work here and to head the department of blood\ndiseases. And so my parents said, well we\u2019d like to go back to Halifax. With heavy\nheart. They -- they did not want to come to the Washington area. So they moved\nback to Halifax and had many more good years in Halifax until my father died and\nthen my mother did indeed come to visit -- I mean, come to stay with us, and that\nwas good.",
        "A: Oh, it was the most freeing, wonderful experience. I remember being in camp,\nand my father sending me information about the victory, and all hell broke loose in\ncamp. This was Canadian camp, you know? And it was such a freeing -- it was like\ntearing away ropes that bound one\u2019s chest, really. And of course, with it came the\nrealization that even though the war was over, there were so many gone. I\nremember, for example, in the middle of one night when my mother woke us all up\nscreaming. And this was in the 40\u2019s, the early 40\u2019s. And to this day she thinks that\nwas the day that her mother was killed. And -- and probably it was. Probably it was.\nJune 23, 2005\nBut the fact that the war was over was -- at least the European part of the war was\nover. This was not yet the end because -- but Canadian forces were not in the\nPacific. So in a way, for us that war was over.",
        "A: You know, I had the feeling that they did know about the camps because there\nwere some camps that were already in existence when we were in Germany.\nMauthausen for one, and Dachau. So, I think they were very well aware of what\nwas going on, and I don\u2019t know, but they kept in very close touch with friends who\nhad also emigrated, and when one got, you know, word about anything, that they\nwould share with the adults, not the -- not the children. And as I say, for many years\nmy father tried so desperately to get the grandmothers out, and would go to the\nStates in order to do some of his work. I mean, up to Ottawa, down here to this\narea.

And, as a matter of\nfact, next week I am going to Los Angeles to be present at the Bar Mitzvah of his\ngrandson. And we have kept in close touch.

The h -- th-\nthe houses and the buildings in my mind are still the ones that are there, they\u2019re not\nthere any more. That area was terribly shot up, particularly the Russians took their\nguns to that area. And I don\u2019t -- perhaps didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t want to know what\nhad really happened. Although some of my friends have gone back. My friend in\nIsrael has gone back several times. But, interestingly enough, she 1s a year older\nthan I am and couldn\u2019t remember a thing. And yet, I\u2019m the visually one -- visually\nJune 23, 2005\nactive one, and I can remember it and I -- no. But I -- I think I\u2019m ready to go back\nnow. I would like to be well and go next year, and we\u2019re talking about it.",
        "A: I did not like it and I did not tell anybody that I could understand what they were\nsaying, because I could. I did not speak German, I spoke only in English. And it\u2019s\nvery interesting when a German talks German to me, I question in my mind, where\nwere you and where was your family? Take an example. My next door neighbor a\nfew years ago was a couple. He was from Germany, he was a writer for the\nFrankfurter Allgemeine, wonderful German, conservative German newspaper, a\ngood newspaper, though. He was married to a Spanish gal and they lived next door\nand it took me at least half a year before I could be comfortable with him. They had\nsince become perhaps our closest friends and neighbors. They -- you know, if\nanybody could make me feel that maybe the younger generation today 1s different,\nhe was the one. I am still in touch with them, they have moved back to -- well, at this\npoint to Spain. He still is writing for the Frankfurter Allgemeine. I watched their\ndaughter grow up, I babysat with the daughter. I have a little plant here that\u2019s my\nlittle Laura plant because she gave it to me. They are -- he is such a dear person and\nhe has -- the one who has sent me books on Ratibor and Breslau and tried to make\nJune 23, 2005\ncontacts for me to make it easy for me to go back if I wanted to go back.

I read slowly, stuff that\u2019s a little bit more complicated,\nbecause after all, I kind of stopped talking German when I came to Canada and my\nparents wanted to improve their English, so of course I had spoke English to my\nparents. But -- but I did speak German, and -- when I went home, Mother and I\nalways did try to keep it up at least a little. But I feel comfortable speaking German\nma -- if I know who I\u2019m talking to.

But yes, I -- I guess I -- I did, I -- I did think\n-- | did think so often how fortunate, how fortunate they were to be born in this\ncountry and to live in this wonderful, wonderful country, of which I became a\ncitizen, not too long ago. I did not -- I was a Canadian citizen for a long period of\ntime and then when I started to critique the government, I was told I better take out\ncitizenship. You cannot criticize -- well, the story was ma -- my husband needed Q\nclearance for his work, and so ah -- I -- I did take out my citizenship and it was a\nvery formal thing in Knoxville, Tennessee in the old-fashioned way and it was\nwonderful.

        "A: You know, it -- it\u2019s interesting, I did and I didn\u2019t. I think I -- I was hesitant until\nthey asked questions and then when they asked questions I tried to answer as\ntruthfully as I could. On the other hand they, like I, did not want to rub, you know,\nsalt into any wounds. They did not want to put me into a situation that would make it\nhard on me, as I did to my mother, because I did not want to hurt her. I -- I did share\nJune 23, 2005\nwith them, especially the school experiences. I di -- I shielded them, I think, a great\ndeal as to what happened to the grandmothers.

But we watched together many offerings on\ntelevision which prompted questioning, and I was tra -- I tried to answer as best I\ncould, what I thought was appropriate for their ages. So in a way I did share. But I\nthink -- I think now -- I think now that more is being written and more is known.\nThe children today -- I mean, my -- my grown children today feel freer to ask me\nand I am able to answer them, perhaps a little bit better than before.

        "A: More Jewish than ever. Not necessarily in the religious sense, but in the way of\nlife sense of doing the right thing and supporting the right causes. And helping\nwhere help is needed and living the exemplary life that our religion teaches us to\nlive.

        "A: Well, I -- I was a frustrated art student when I was studying microbiology and\nreally all my life wanted to go to art school. Wasn\u2019t allowed to because of other\nJune 23, 2005\nmatters. However, finally, after my children stayed in school til 3:30 in the\nafternoon, my husband urged me to do what I\u2019ve always wanted to do and that was\nto go to art school, which I did. I went to school at the University of Tennessee in\nKnoxville. And first I -- he had had a -- a second heart attack at that point in our\nstory and I again thought well, I should go back to school and learn to do something\nthat would prepare me to earn a living, God forbid, and thought I would study art\neducation. However, after the second class of art education I decided that was not for\nme under any circumstances. Perhaps I should try the art school. And he wanted\nvery much to have me do that and so I did go to art school and I studied\nmetalworking. And I -- I learned how to s -- do metalsmithing, metalcasting and all\naspects of the metal as an a -- as a tool, and taking a Master\u2019s degree in Fine Arts at\nthe university. And worked in metals and also had to choose a second part and that\nwas fibers, and so I took metals and fibers both, and then interesting situation arrived\nin the sense that after two years I was told -- and I was working part time because I\nstill had the carpools and the kids and 18 puppies and all that sort of thing -- I was\ntold I had to choose a thesis project. And so I decided I would write a thesis on the\nhistory of the ceremonial objects pertaining to the Torah and make contemporary\npieces based on the research of the history of each of these as implements on their\nown. And that\u2019s what I did. So I made breastplates and I made [indecipherable]\n105\nJune 23, 2005\npointers, and I proposed the [indecipherable] and I made the covering for the\nTorahs and I made mezuzahs and all sorts of other things along the side, learning\nthe technique. But I wanted to do something that was a bit cerebral as well as doing -\n- creating something new, and so that I did. And I wrote a thesis, a thick book, which\n-- the work of which I enjoyed tremendously, both doing the library re-research,\nwhich was a little difficult from Knoxville, Tennessee, but the university got me all\nkinds of books that I needed to and I was able to do that and in my graduate show I\nshowed my pieces, and it was accepted and I was a happy camper. I graduated in\n1973 with all my dear ones around me. Cap and gown and the whole thing, and\nDavid graduated from high school. So we had a gala celebration together. And then\nwe left Knoxville and I had -- I had the use of the university lab to do my work in\nand then we came to Knoxville and I no longer had a lab to work in and so I decided\nperhaps it was time to switch from doing metalwork, which required gas, which I\nfind very hard to -- to keep in my house, which psychologically was very difficult\nfor me to have a gas tank in my house.",

But all along I still\nJune 23, 2005\nloved my metal. And so, in the I-last number of years I\u2019ve combined the two and I\nweave metal on my loom. And it\u2019s wire that I use, and I use stainless steel wire and\ncopper wire and brass wire and I weave it on my loom and I do sculptural pieces.\nMany of them are Judaic. I take really my inspiration from the jew -- things Judaic.\nAnd of course, I have concentrated both on the liturgy -- I\u2019ve done a series on the\nHigh Holy Day prayers, but I\u2019ve also done Holocaust series and I did one particular\nsix piece Holocaust -- progression of thoughts on the Holocaust from the earliest\ndays to the final days. And so -- and also my metal, my woven metal -- metal pieces\nare [indecipherable] boxes and things that could -- that could be used 1n worship or\nin home worship at least. I made mis -- mizrahs and the -- various other implements\nwhere I can use the wos -- woven fi -- the woven fabric made out of metal.

I think one of the ideas that I\nused o-on the side, there\u2019s a progression from one to six, I used the stripes of the\ntallid, progressing from one to six. I chose six because of the reference to six\nmillion. My last piece is a very dark one, but it has a little glimmer of gold, and that\nis our hope for the future, that these things never happen again. They\u2019re small\ntapestries. I wanted them small so that one has to lean into them in order to really\nstudy them, more like putting one\u2019s nose into a book, if you will, by coming thr --\ninto very close contact. I used cotton material because it was a non-precious\nmaterial.
