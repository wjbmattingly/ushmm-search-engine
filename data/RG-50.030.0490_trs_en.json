        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "Q: It\u2019s so nice to see you. What was your name when you were born?",
        "A: My name was Sybilla Augusta Sophia von Sell. Augusta after my mother, and Sophia after\nmy aunt, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a family name, and Sybilla after the princess of Coburg and Gotha who la --\nlater became queen -- crown princess of Sweden, and is Gustav\u2019s mother -- was Gustav\u2019s\nmother.",
        "Q: And your name now?",
        "A: My name now, I dropped -- I -- I didn\u2019t quite drop Augusta, I still use it as an initial. My\nname now is Sibylle Sarah Niemoeller. It\u2019s my Jewish name, and I -- I picked it myself.",
        "Q: And you keep von Sell as your --",
        "A: Yes, as a --",
        "Q: -- as a family -- as the family name.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s Sybilla, it\u2019s not Sibyl --",
        "A: Yes, but you know, it\u2019s Sibylle, really, I be -- in this country, I prefer to be called Sibylle.",
        "Q: Sibylle.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And when were you born?",
        "A: On the 10\" of April.",
        "Q: And the year?",
        "A: 1923.",
        "Q: 1923, okay. Somehow I thought it was 1924.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But no, it\u2019s 1923.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: I was born Potsdam.",
        "Q: And did you --",
        "A: The cradle of Prussian military.",
        "Q: Yes? And how long did you stay there?",
        "A: Until I was two and a half years old, that\u2019s when my family moved to -- my father had a new\nposition, and we moved to Berlin, but not to Berlin Dahlem yet, but we stayed in -- in another\nhalf suburb of Berlin, which was known for being nice, and quiet, and cheap.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So tell me -- I would like to get a sense of your family. Tell me about your mother\nfirst, and then we\u2019ll go to your father, and the --",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "Q: -- and what the home life was like.",
        "A: Oh, by the way, since you asked my -- my names, I was not -- the authorities have to come to\nmy parents after my birth to tell them what my name was going to be. They had not counted on a\ngirl. I was to be -- I was to be a boy because my father had lost his three brothers --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- in the first World War, which was such a tragedy. And here comes a girl, so not everybody\nwas terribly amused. My mother -- I was my mother\u2019s second child, because she had been\nmarried before, she wa -- married at age 19, a Baron von Hornstein, who not only had a Jewish\ngrandmother, but was the rightful heir to the name -- I\u2019m sorry, he was the child -- he was the\ngreat, great grandchild of Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton. That\u2019s the one thing I en -- I always\nenvied my sister who -- my stepsister -- half sister, who is 10 years older than I am, always\nenvied her for it.",
        "Q: So your mother married into that family?",
        "A: My mother married into that family, that was a zo -- the -- they are -- that was old nobility\naround Lake Constance, and very Catholic, so she had to agree that in case my half sister was\nborn as a boy that he had to be brought up Catholic, which 1s, I think, a very brutal decision to\nsplit a family that way. Well but so he was bor -- he was baptized in the Protestant faith, and then\nmy mother lost her husband during the first few weeks of the first World War, and became very\nill with tuberculosis, which meant she -- thanks to the help of the friend of the family, the victor -\n- Queen Victoria\u2019s great grand-nephew, the count of Coburg and Gotha -- not count, I\u2019m sorry,\nthe duke of Coburg and Gotha saw to it that she was put in a -- in a -- a sanitorium, and she\nsurvived very well. She died at 93. My mother\u2019s family is by far -- is lo -- a lot older than my\nfather\u2019s family. My father\u2019s family, of which I'll talk later, they were really newcomers to\nnobility, meaning they were mor -- they were nobilized in 1657, while my mother\u2019s family goes\nback to -- to Charlemagne, documented.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. And they were partially -- they we -- they came from the east, how much Slavic\ninfluence there was, we can only guess. A lot, I would say.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, I -- sometimes, you know, the Vens, that Slavic tribe that ruled Germany between the\nriver Rhine and the -- and the -- or not -- not the Rhine, the Elba, and the Oda, they ruled in\nGermany, a wild tribe, for three to 400 years. So everybody has Vendish, Solbic, Serbic blood in\nthem. And my mother was born -- my mother\u2019s father was a Prussian general, and he had been\none of -- his name was von Brauchitsch, Brokovitce, you know, God knows what it was\noriginally. And my -- my grandfather was a Prussian general, as was my father\u2019s father. And he\nwas one of 23 children.",
        "Q: 23?",
        "A: Yes, his father had married several times, and there were your children, my children, our\nchildren. And there are funny legends going around about that family like a -- a Brauchitsch\nofficer stopped the little guy on -- in -- in a military school, asked for his name and then found\nout they were brothers. How many of them are true, I never -- I call them legends. So they were -\n- they didn\u2019t have much money of course, and my -- my --",
        "Q: So being nobility didn\u2019t mean that you had money?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely not --",
        "Q: So you had privilege?",
        "A: -- I mean, that\u2019s how the Crusades once started.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: Get the second and third son, get them out of the way, give them something to do. And no --\nand the -- the -- my oldest uncle, my mother\u2019s oldest brother, he inherited this fabulous castle,\nthe Rimburg, which is on the border from Germany to Holland, to the Netherlands, and the n --\nHolland claimed it after this last war, and my uncle was very happy about it, but then the\nGermans got it back. And my mother had -- there were six or seven children. Uncle Siegfried\nwas the oldest, and my grandmother was 18 years old, and she had the baby, as was done in\nthose days, at home, but thank goodness with the help of a -- of a doctor. And he wa -- wa -- held\nthe baby and declared him dead, and put him on a chair, and after awhile that dead child began to\nhowl and yell, and he -- he lived. And the -- the doctor told my -- my grandfather that that was to\nbe the first and only child. Oh, the -- she had a Caesarian, which in those days, can you imagine?\nAnd after the Caesarian she had right away one more child after the other, seven altogether.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. And died completely exhausted and spent at age 49.",
        "Q: So this was your mother\u2019s mother?",
        "A: That\u2019s my mother\u2019s mother. I never met her, of course.",
        "Q: Right. Now was your mother educated?",
        "A: No. Girls in those --",
        "Q: Girls were not educated.",
        "A: -- days, girls in those days were pitifully off. Really, she went to a -- she went to a girl\u2019s\nschool, I suppose, in wherever they lived. Oh my -- my grandfather had been the commander of\nColmar, Alsatian Colmar, which then was German, which as a consequen -- which had a cra --\nhad a confer -- consequence. About 20 years after this past war, let\u2019s say in 1965 or so, the\nFrench government offered French citizenship to my mother.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, which was very nice, but my mother said, no, I\u2019m 80 years old, you know, I might as\nwell stay who I am and where I am.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But she felt very much like li -- very Alsatian and spoke French with a strong Alsatian accent,\nwhich is funny. And from there he went to another military g-garrison in Silesia and finally to\nPotsdam and in Potsdam it was time for the girls. After school my mother had -- had finishing\nschool, one year in a finishing school in Geneva.",
        "Q: So this was a finishing school in order to be it -- to come out --",
        "A: Presentable, right.",
        "Q: -- and -- oh, uh-huh.",
        "A: I mean, her knowledge of things, be it mathematics, or -- or history, forget about it. She was --\nand that -- that led to her debut before -- before the emperor, and that was mandatory. Otherwise,\nyou -- she would never catch a husband. And so, you know, th -- how they managed, with their\nmeager income, it was at that time meager because my -- my grandfather had to retire at age 55\nbecause during a hunt, a hunter has mistaken his head for a hare, and put a load of what do you --\nwhat do you call the BB gun --",
        "Q: Buckshot? Oh.",
        "A: -- BB in there, which he was not mortally wounded, but to get all the little pieces out of his\nscalp was impossible, so he could never wear a steel helmet again. A general without a helmet?\nUnthinkable. So he had to retire and live off a meager pension. They had just barely enough to\neat and so did the ba -- the servants, you know, the life without food was thinkable, but not\nwithout servants. And then the -- my mother was taken to that wonderful ba -- ball of the year,\nand was pres -- officially presented to the majesties, and then other balls -- dances, followed,\nduring which she met her first husband. Erich Baron von Hornstein, and --",
        "Q: And is that when she becomes a baroness?",
        "A: No, no, no, she had been a baroness.",
        "Q: Okay, she\u2019s a baroness anyway?",
        "A: I -- only -- only -- only noble -- no -- people of nobility were invited there, others did not\nexist.",
        "Q: Exist, right.",
        "A: Of course the -- the -- there was the so-called briefadle, which was the -- many of those which\nthe Kaiser bestowed upon a person with great merits. But those were people that were looked\ndown upon, of course.",
        "Q: Yeah, because they were not true nobility.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And among my ancestors is not a single bourgeois, not a single one. I mean, as far as we can\ngo back, you know?",
        "Q: Right. It\u2019s all nobility [indecipherable]",
        "A: All nobility because they didn\u2019t meet anybody else.",
        "Q: Yeah. So how did your mother meet your father? Do you know?",
        "A: Oh absolutely, my father and my mother -- of course, he was old nobility too [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And they --",
        "Q: But not quite as old.",
        "A: Not quite as old, but that was, you know --",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t -- that didn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: That didn\u2019t, no, no, you know. And they met socially in Potsdam. He was a very outstanding\nyoung officer. He had been put in military school with all his brothers at age eight, and that was\na brutal education for this very sensitive boy. And he knew one thing, never mind what his father\nwanted, or what his -- his -- the plans that he had made for him, he will not enter the military as a\n-- choose the military as a career. His aim was become a diplomat and at a very young age, he\nbecame the adjutant of the then Reichschancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg. And in that capacity\nhe -- he -- for instance, he took -- he took the declaration of war to the Kaiser personally to be\nsigned. And he had -- he was a very promising young man who had probably become a vi --\nfinance mis -- minister or something like that. And then the war ended.",
        "Q: And we\u2019re talking World War I, of course.",
        "A: World War I, of course. And my -- my brother and his -- my -- my father and his brothers\nwent to war, and they all die -- they were all killed except my father, who had a terrible, terrible\nshrapnel wound right above the eye -- the ear, the left ear. And spent a year or so in military -- in\nmilitary hospitals. Was operated on under brutal circumstances. And then he came home, and he\nfound a mother who had, you know, who had been a proud woman with her beautiful four boys,\nand her -- her husband, a general for a husband. She was completely broken, of course, and ma --\nand my grandfather, not as a consequence of that, but soon after the war, was hospitalized with\nwhat probably was Alzheimer, and he -- he lost his mind and he died be -- six months before I\nwas born, to be his first grandchild. That was tragic. And my father\u2019s family, they were all\nmilitary. And -- and his grandfather was not only a general too, of course, but he was the -- in the\ncabinet of the duke -- of the Duke of Meklinburg, which was one of the states in Germany before\nthe unification in 1917. But th -- and he was highly regarded, but the -- the -- the duke forgot\nsomething very important which he did with other people, to give him an estate for -- you know,\nas a thank you. So he was -- he was receiving a pension and there was no money there. And --",
        "Q: So if nobility are not necessarily wealthy, do nobility have privilege? Is there -- is there\nsomething that comes?",
        "A: Well they -- first of all they think they are better than others, of course, yeah.",
        "Q: Yes, that\u2019s a self privilege, yes.",
        "A: And -- and it car -- came close to it -- close to serfdom in many provinces. Not as badly as in\nRussia, but -- and some of them were -- were very, very good to their people, and I guess I\nlearned from my -- my father how to treat people below you, always with the greatest respect.\nNever let them feel you\u2019re in a bad mood, or that -- always say please and thank you and I still\nremember my father when our nanny, who was then a cook, when she approached a door with a\nfull tray, he would jump up and open the door for her. And that was not --",
        "Q: That was not typical?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Well, probably not. Not in my mother\u2019s family, they weren\u2019t that nice.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Ho -- wh-what are your earliest memories as a kid?",
        "A: Well, the birth of my brother, I was two and a half.",
        "Q: You do remember?",
        "A: Iremember my br -- clearly my mo -- my brother, a yellow little something lying there, and I\nhad not been prepared. You know, in those days you weren\u2019t, because I mean, dis -- pregnancy\nwas something very indecent. And -- but I remember my disappointment tha -- when they told\nme the stork had already le -- had already left -- the stork who brought my brother had already\nleft, but he left me, as a present, a huge bag of candy. And what came out first was a wolf-like\nred -- Little Red Riding Hood wolf made of chocolate.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, and that wa -- made it easier for me to accept my brother. And he is still alive.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And now I\u2019m his younger sister, of course.",
        "Q: Even though you were the older sister?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes. This is Everhard? Is -- what [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s Freiderich Wilhelm.",
        "Q: Freiderich, right.",
        "A: Freiderich Everhard --",
        "Q: Is the -- is --",
        "A: -- was my mother\u2019s youngest brother.",
        "Q: Y-Youngest brother, right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how do you remember your parents when you were so young? I mean di -- were you\nclose --",
        "A: Well, I remember my -- my mother as being almost aloof, very cool.",
        "Q: Cruel?",
        "A: Cool.",
        "Q: Cool.",
        "A: Very cool, and I never -- I cannot remember one single occasion where I sat on her lap. She\ncouldn\u2019t -- she never received love at home, so she couldn\u2019t give love to her children, which was\ntragic. She had a horror of men because her father was -- had been after the daughters, which --",
        "Q: Sexually.",
        "A: Yes. And it must have come to a scene once where my mother overheard her mother behind a\nclosed door yelling, \u201cAnd if you do that once more, I\u2019m going to divorce you.\u201d I mean, he never\nreally touched them, you know, but it came pretty close.",
        "Q: So how did you find out about this?",
        "A: My mother told me.",
        "Q: Later\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, much later when I would understand.",
        "Q: So she was afraid of her father?",
        "A: She was afraid of her father and in consequence of -- of all men, including God. She was\nafraid of God. She could deal with Jesus Christ, but not with God himself.",
        "Q: Did you ever see her be affectionate with your father?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think once. Not even once. She was affectionate with my little brother.",
        "Q: She was?",
        "A: Yes, and of course that made it very hard for me --",
        "Q: For you.",
        "A: -- because I -- I was always told how homely I was. I had very little hair, the hair came late,\nand I was spindly little legs, you know, fresh. And I once overheard a terrible thing, which I -- at\nthe time I couldn\u2019t really interpret. Behind a -- a paravol, I overheard, in somebody else\u2019s house,\npeople talking and si -- once one lady said to, was it her husband, saying, \u201cUnbelievable, that\nchild and this beautiful mother? Those poor people.\u201d So that was me.",
        "Q: So you grow up feeling unattractive?",
        "A: Unattractive and that lasts for quite a long time, until I found out at age 18 that I had\nsomething that my mother didn\u2019t have. And that was called sex appeal.",
        "Q: Right. Now how did your father make you feel since you were much closer to him, yes?",
        "A: My f -- fa -- father, as soon as he was home I climbed on his lap and he kissed me and Sunday\nmornings, I'll -- I'll sit at the foot of his bed and for -- for -- for -- for hours he would tell me\nstories, and never wo -- I would have done -- have been in my mother\u2019s bed, unthinkable.",
        "Q: Now, did they sleep in separate rooms?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: This was -- this was what was done?",
        "A: That was -- yeah, that was done in our circles. Most of them slept in different room, but with\ndoor open so my father can -- could come and help my father. My father suffered from the most\nterrible nightmares.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Not only as far as the past was concerned, but it always ended with a horribly -- with this\nhoarse voice he\u2019d say, \u201cThey are coming for me, they are coming for me.\u201d \u201cSie holen mich, sie\nholen mich.\u201d Well, one day they came.",
        "Q: And it was -- and do you think at that point he was thinking of the Nazis?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Very definitely.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: And I was very surprised when I -- to find out someday that other people\u2019s fathers didn\u2019t have\nthese nightmares. They didn\u2019t yell out at night, he woke up the whole house. It happened at least\nonce a week.",
        "Q: It was that loud?",
        "A: It was the past that --",
        "Q: And would you run into his room?",
        "A: No, no, I knew my mo --",
        "Q: You wouldn\u2019t? So your mother --",
        "A: But I would -- I would get up at times because I heard my mother trying to comfort him.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And to wake him up and all that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But it was taken for granted.",
        "Q: Do you -- a-as you look back, as a young person, not as a -- not when you were a teenager or\nolder than that, did you think that they had a good marriage, or was this not what one thought\nabout very much?",
        "A: Yes, I thought it was. They never fought, they were very respectful to -- to one another, but\nthere was no -- no tenderness --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- no -- no, it wasn\u2019t -- just somehow -- I -- I could compare because th -- I-I adopted a family\nin the neighborhood.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I talked about --",
        "Q: Ditte, your friend. Ditte -- or Ditte.",
        "A: Ditte.",
        "Q: Ditte.",
        "A: She is still alive.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And Ditte\u2019s mother was Jewish. Of course, in those days denying she was, she looked like --\nyou would s -- notice it right away. But they had a regular Jewish family life, wonderful. And\nthey adopted me, and I really -- you know, from a certain age on, from age nine and 10 on, was\nnever anything but politics discussed at the dinner table. The atmosphere was grave at home, if\nnot black. And we grew up without supervision, too, you know my mother could -- we were sent\nout into the street, I was a regular little Berlin street girl, unusual for our circles, very unusual.\nAnd -- but home, my home was with the Nickel family, really. The Nickels.",
        "Q: So when did you f -- when did that start?",
        "A: That started -- we -- we entered -- we entered the lyceum, the high school together at age -- I\nwas nine, Ditte was 10.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s when that started?",
        "A: That\u2019s when that started, yes.",
        "Q: But now all through -- all through your childhood -- the Nazis don\u2019t take over until \u201933.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But there\u2019s a lot of ferment in Germany --",
        "A: But there was --",

        "A: -- yeah, there wa -- the -- the -- he was co -- Hitler was coming.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I remember a scene in a nearby street, the street on which Martin Niemoeller lived, and the --\nand the -- the -- the St. Anne\u2019s church was on that. One Sunday the SR -- the SR was marching\noutside, singing, chanting, you know, howling one. And I looked -- I said to my father, \u201cWho are\nthey?\u201d And my father s -- 1t must have been in \u201932. And my father said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a terrible\ngang, and -- and,\u201d -- and I said to him, \u201cWhy -- who allows them to do that?\u201d \u201cWell, th-that\u2019s\ntheir leader.\u201d And I said and what was going to happen, and he said, \u201cWell he -- he wants to be\nthe -- the head of the German government, and if he ever comes to power,\u201d -- I said, \u201cWhat --\nwhat will happen then?\u201d And he said, \u201cMay God help us all.\u201d So I remember that, I\u2019ve never\nforgotten. They did that in front of the church, to -- to disturb the services.",
        "Q: In Dahlem?",
        "A: In Dahlem. That already --",
        "Q: Right. You moved there --",
        "A: -- we had -- we had moved to Dahlem, yeah.",
        "Q: -- a number of years before. So ag-again, a little bit pri -- prior to the \u201932 and \u00b033, 1s it a very\nreligious home that you grew up in?",

        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. There was prayer at lunch.",
        "Q: And you all ate lunch together?",
        "A: My mother --",
        "Q: Father?",
        "A: -- and my -- no, my father was -- worked an hour away.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: He was then in the same pos -- in the position with the Hohenzollerns, the keeper of the privy\n-- purse, you know, the -- under a ruling monarch that would have been finance minister. And he\ntook care -- administered the -- one of the biggest fortunes not only in Germany, but in the world.\nAfter the Kaiser abdicated and f -- not went, but fled to Holland.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The German government took everything from him. But somehow things went large -- long\ntrains went to Holland, where he had sought and received asylum. He received all his -- his\npersonal belongings and -- and also his many, many estates.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: They were all back to his name there.",
        "Q: So your -- and your father is taking care of all this?",
        "A: My father is -- not only administered the money, but made a lot of money for them. The\nHohenzollern -- Hohenzollern family though, were imbeciles. Really. He did -- my father was\nnot a monarchist. My father couldn\u2019t ta -- stand the Hohenzollerns, who took advantage of him\nwhenever possible. But he loved this old, old, confused old man.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Who had caused so much trouble in the world, but would never admit to it. Never one word.\nAnd who was easily influenced. When the Nazis came he had remarried. Remarried a princess, a\nwidowed princess with four children, of -- two sons and two daughters, Princess of Schoenaich-\nCarolath, and who was 30 some years younger than he, and he fell in love, you know. His first\nwife, the Empress Auguste, who must have been an angel, she loved him. And she died literally\nof a broken heart after he went to Holland. And then he soon, within two years he was remarried\nand lived in his golden cage, and my father had his own apartment there, of course, and went --\nstayed with him, I would say, an average of a week a month.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And when him -- when my father left him, he had talked reason to him, you know, but he\nalways knew, as soon as he turns his back, the old man would --",
        "Q: Wish -- good -- would go back.",
        "A: -- fall prey to any bad influence. Poor man.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: He had a hard life, you know, growing up with wa -- only one arm, the other one crippled. For\na Prussian, for a future emperor, he had hells on wheels.",
        "Q: Hm. We have to stop the tape and change it.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: When does Anna come into your life as a housekeeper? Or what is she, actually?",
        "A: I -- came into Anna\u2019s life, so to say. Anna -- when my -- my father and my mother got\nmarried, they got in touch with je -- with each other while my mother was in the sanitorium for\nher lung disease and my father was in a military hospital. Somehow a correspondence began.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And one remembered the other, and they really fell in love over -- they must have -- over the\nletters, because they already got -- he got out of the military and they married in May of 1919.\nMy sister was always -- half sister was six months -- six years old.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And then was the question what was he going to do with his life. He had -- he ra -- was a very\ngood looking man, he had had his military -- military academy education, which I mean for those\nyears were -- was a pretty good one. He was right away spotted as a very special -- very special\nman with a talent for finances. Well, they got married and even though they had hardly enough\nto eat, they had to have a servant who would cook. And --",
        "Q: Your mother didn\u2019t go into the kitchen, of course.",
        "A: Oh, would sh -- well, first of all they -- they asked around in Potsdam and Anna\u2019s name was\ngiven to them. She was -- Anna was born in -- in the 1980 -- 18 -- 1887, so she was already, you\nknow, not very young for those days any more, and she was -- her -- her family, also noble, her\nfamily, von Massel -- I call them Shtraylo in my -- in my book, I believe. There were, due to the\ncircumstances there was nothing to eat, it was dismal circumstances. They moved to one of their\nestates, they had an estate. So Anna could pick, you know, and she took one look at my mother\nand said this lady is not going to interfere with my housekeeping, you know. She was right. And\nno children, thank goodness. So she accepted for -- for, I mean, peanuts for pay, the position. My\nmother -- my mother and father had been assigned an ap -- miserable apartment, which is still\nstanding in Potsdam facing a coal supply firm, and it was all windows going to the north, and\nthere were -- was a bit wet, and but you -- what could they do? And that\u2019s where I began my start\nin life. And when Anna heard that a baby was on the way, she seriously considered leaving. But\nthen on the other hand, you know, maybe my mother had no interest -- as little interest in a child\nthan she had for the household. She stayed, watched me being born and I was her baby. From the\nfirst day on, I grew up on Anna\u2019s arms, and all the tenderness that I didn\u2019t get from my mother, I\ngot from Anna.",
        "Q: So Anna became a kind of mother figure --",
        "A: Absol --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- and still -- I still, when I think of motherhood and -- and of being on somebody\u2019s lap, there\nis Anna, holding me tight like a -- like a gorilla holding her young, Anna. She would not even\nshare -- share her with my mother. This -- when my mother three years later, two and a half years\nlater, gave birth to my brother, she decided she\u2019d let her keep that baby.",
        "Q: So in some ways, Anna kept you from your mother, at a certain point.",
        "A: Well, though, she didn\u2019t have a hard time keeping --",
        "Q: Keeping you, I see.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, of course.",
        "Q: Explain to me what you mean by an apartment was assigned to your parents. Who assigned\nit?",
        "A: It was assigned, there was a housing office --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- because of the terrible shortage, like there was during the war -- World War II, and after\nWorld War II --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- where you had a va -- you had a right to certain space and -- and that\u2019s what they had to\ntake, whether they liked it -- 1t was either that apartment or none.",
        "Q: Right. Now tell me something, Anna is nobility, but she\u2019s working as a housekeeper. Now, is\nthis odd? Or 1s it --",
        "A: Wait -- what -- what -- whose --",
        "Q: Anna. Anna you said had an -- estates, her family. Or am I wrong?",
        "A: Yeah, Anna came from the Vendish tribe.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: A Vendish tribe, and a very proud tribe, and the girls were all sent to work with -- to work in\nhouseholds.",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t do anything else, th -- they had, according to German laws, which applied to\nthem, learn German and -- and attend school until 14. But Anna would not have gone to a\nbourgeois family. First position she had at age 14 was with nobility and later my parents.",
        "Q: And why is that, because the ven --",
        "A: A beca --",
        "Q: -- because of wu -- of the group that she comes from? The particul --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t -- she identified herself so much with our family that y -- or later too, very few\nnon-nobility people came into our house, and they had to make up for their terrible lack by titles\nlike your Excellency, stuff like that. Or doctor, you know. But Anna knew th -- those were her\ncircles, you know.",
        "Q: Hm. When you start going to school --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s --",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- let\u2019s mo -- move up. When do you first go to school, when you\u2019re six?",
        "A: When I was six, I went -- of course, we were much too sn-snobbish a -- to -- snob is not a ver\n-- g -- good word, by the way, a -- but mainly thanks to Anna, her child would not attend a public\nschool. So we -- th -- my parents joined other parents and they founded a school in the\nneighborhood, it took place in one room, and there were -- for the first three years of my life\nthere was one teacher who had been retired, he came out of retirement. He taught us all, we were\nabout 12 children. That was neat, that was neat. And then we -- even though I was so small and -\n- and I was sick very often, my parents insisted on me entering the so-called high school, the\nhigher school, not at age 10, but at age nine. Which of course, as a consequence, I -- I was left\nbehind when I was 13.",
        "Q: In order to join up with the other kids, or because you weren\u2019t --",
        "A: Because I was not --",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t ready.",
        "A: -- not mature enough.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And th -- that -- that school was just around the corner from us in Dahlem, we had moved to\nDahlem, renting a beautiful house on the same street where we would later in 1932 and \u201933,\nwould build our own townhouse.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you also said that that became a neighborhood where a lot of Nazis --",
        "A: It was an --",
        "Q: -- lived, or least some.",
        "A: -- aneighborhood where a lot of non-Nazis lived, but among the populati -- and film stars,\nmovie stars lived there. But a lot of the highest Nazis -- Himmler had his house around the\ncorner, the Minister of Economy, the Minister of Education, Woost, economy was Starrer.\nGoebbels was out in Wannsee. Oh yes, a lot of 1t was -- you know, all these beautiful villas\nwhere Jews had lived, that Jews had -- had built, had worked for, when they were expelled,\nbefore being dis -- deported and killed, those villas were taken by the Nazis and high military\npeople. You know, I had one Brauchitsch, General Field Marshall -- Field Marshall Walter von\nBrauchitsch, a cousin of my mother\u2019s, who was Chief of Staff of the German armed forces, of\nthe German army. And he lived in one of these big villas, and was -- he had been a member of\nthe Nazi party, with the golden bird. And even though he lived, walking, maybe seven minutes\naway, I not ever in my life set eyes on him. My father would not allow anyone even faintly\nresembling -- faintly connected with the Nazis, he would not allow it, but my mother was -- was\nmy mother\u2019s brother in a -- in -- a young o -- an older brother, of course, he joined the SR and\nthe party. And you -- he didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t come to the house after that.",
        "Q: Did your mother keep connections with the people who had connections with the Nazis, or\nwere -- did she join with her father --",
        "A: No, no, no, she joined --",
        "Q: -- or was it -- with her husband?",
        "A: -- absolute -- absolutely, yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And on the other hand there was the other brother of my mother, who married a Jewish lady\nfrom --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- from Russia, originally.",
        "Q: Now, when you first moved to Dahlem -- I don\u2019t mean when you were two and a half, when\nyou [indecipherable] you wouldn\u2019t --",
        "A: No, to -- to -- to Dahlem, I moved at age six.",
        "Q: At age six?",
        "A: Yes. To -- from Potsdam to Berlin --",
        "Q: Ah, at age two and a half.",
        "A: -- at age two and a half.",
        "Q: Right, okay. So when you were six.",
        "A: When I was six we moved. That makes it 1929. We moved t -- to Dahlem, had that rented\nhouse.",
        "Q: Now, do you remember having Jewish friends as well as non-Jewish friends?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: The neighborhood is quite mixed, then?",
        "A: Th-The school was -- yeah, my class was -- was -- was full of Jewish girls, and one by one\nthey disappeared. But except for my dear, dear, dear friend Anita Frank, who was -- they were --\nshe and her brother were already orphaned at the time, she died in Bergen-Belsen. Reinhardt\nmade it out of -- of Auschwitz, they all reached safety.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. For a very simple fact. Not only were the parents well informed, but they had a lot of\nmoney.",
        "Q: Money.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And they could get out.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So they got out early.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I never, except for once in Berlin during the day I saw an open truck loading Jews\nfrom house -- from a Jew house. Otherwise these sights were not -- you know, I was not familiar\nwith that sight, because even if they had come for them, you know, with the wide spaces in\nbetween the houses, nobody would have known.",
        "Q: Did your father explain to you when people were leaving, why they were leaving, or were you\nreading the newspapers when you were nine or 10 years old? I mean, what did you know?",
        "A: No, I wa -- I remember his growing interest when I said well, Ellen Ginsburg, or Alice Levy,\nor wa -- and he said, \u201cThey\u2019re Jewish?\u201d And I said yes. And behind that question was always,\nwhat can we do for them? That ha -- that happened very, very early. I remember the first incident\nat school where I didn\u2019t even notice it, but my father immediately did, where we handed little\nforms indicating what religion we were, you know? Name, and -- and re -- what religion the\nparents were. And -- and what -- what heritage and all that, I remember. Suza -- Suzi Levy,\nSusannah Levy, si -- Ellen Levy, sitting behind me and showed me hers, and that said, we hereby\ntestify that so and so is of purely Jewish background. It was the wa -- death verdict for them, you\nknow? And I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t find anything wrong with it, I thought that goes with school, they\nwant to know. Boy, did they ever want to know. And then, you know, by -- by -- of course, I was\ntaken out of that school, and by the time I was taken out in 1937, there were still -- even though\nthere were Jewish schools in Berlin, there were still some Jewish girls in my class. And by the\ntime I came back in 1939, there were -- I don\u2019t know, all left, they were all gone.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t have the f -- I was not a go -- very good friend with the exception to Anita and\nshe in \u00b041 once rang our doorbell, you know. She\u2019d been told that we were okay, and Anita I\u2019ve\nnever forgotten. She --",
        "Q: She was alone with her brother, her mother had been able to --",
        "A: She wa -- her f -- her -- her -- she lived in -- they lived in Dahlem. How much money they\nhad, I never knew. Very, very much. The mother, widowed mother, can you imagine such a\nthing, left the children. Anita was then 16 or so, and the brother nine, alone to fend for\nthemselves. She left for Switzerland to marry a man, in the hope that she would dr -- get the\nchildren, too. That mother must not have been terribly bright according to what Reinhardt says.",
        "Q: No. Yeah.",
        "A: And of course they moved one -- from one relative to the other, from one Jewish school to the\nother, until a fa -- she finally -- were both finally caught by the -- by the Nazis and she became a\nnurse, a nurse\u2019s aide -- she wanted to be a midwife.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: A nurse\u2019s aide in the Jewish hospital, and took her brother an -- who was then 12, and\nallegedly av -- an -- a electricians assistant, and they -- they -- they lived there in the hospital,\nand one day -- and that\u2019s when Anita came to visit. And Anita, I said, \u201cWhat about going into\nhiding?\u201d You know, and we ha -- gonna --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and she said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do it because of my brother, he looks so Jewish.\u201d Well Anita had\nlooked like a country girl, you know, coffa -- kinky hair and brown eyes, and like a -- like an\napple. And the little -- little Reinhardt, no, and she of cour -- felt responsible for him,\nSwitzerland. And he told her, after I found him again in New York a few years ago, he told me\nthat he was beseeching her to try and go across the -- the border illegally to Switzerland. And he\nsaid, \u201cWa -- wa -- all they can do is shoot us.\u201d Because that little boy knew, obviously, and --\nand she said no -- she was too Prussian, you know? No, no, things will -- wi -- wi -- will work\nout, and they were first sent to Theresienstadt. And Theresienstadt, oh there were -- they were\nreported to the Gestapo, you know, because they -- their position was somehow half legal. To the\nGestapo, they are both deported to -- to Theresienstadt by a man by the name of Gottschalk, a\nJewish spy of which Berlin was full. Remember what\u2019s her name, Stella?",
        "Q: Stella, yeah.",
        "A: Stella --",
        "Q: I forget her last name, but Stella --",
        "A: Gottschalk [indecipherable] Stella -- Stella Gottschalk.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: They both sent to Theresienstadt, and there they lived like everybody else, vegetated in the\nstadt -- in the city that the Fuhrer had given the Jews, for -- meant for 3,000 people, and I think\nthey had 45 in there. But you know, there were transports to -- to --",
        "Q: To Auschwitz?",
        "A: -- to Auschwitz all the time, and one day it was -- no, but I have to stop here, because a few\nweeks after they had appeared in Theresienstadt, who comes? Herr Gottschalk. His fate had\ncaught up with him. And Reinhardt spotted him right away, and took -- was invited for a\nconference among the Jews, what shall we do with him? He deserves the death penalty, but he\ndidn\u2019t go to the -- he were -- they executed him. They were working -- Reinhardt was working in\na chemical cleaners -- at a chemical clean -- for the SS you know, and they threw him in a\ncleaning machine.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And when he came out he was very clean, but quite dead.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then he was -- Reinhardt was selected and put on the train for Auschwitz, and the last\nthing Anita said to him -- and that tells you how naive she was, he said when you arrive -- she\nsaid, \u201cWhen you arrive there, tell them you are only 11 and very sickly.\u201d Had he followed her\nadvice --",
        "Q: Right, he would have been --",
        "A: -- they would have sent him to the gas chamber. On the train he was told to say he was 17 and\na learned -- and -- and a electrician.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how he eventually -- and that\u2019s a story by itself, survived.",
        "Q: When the Nazis take over, and there is a boycott and then there is a book burning in 1933, are\nyou conscious of this? You\u2019re --",
        "A: And how.",
        "Q: You are?",
        "A: And oh, every detail of it. It was -- 1t was -- you know, by that time, Martin Niemoeller had\nalready entered our family --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- who was very naive, and thanks to -- thanks to my father mainly, I -- I like to think, he\nfinally, when it hit home, he -- within a few months he was -- he was cured.",
        "Q: Because he was not against national socialism at first, at all?",
        "A: No, no, no. And he decided it would be good for the volken, whatever, and he -- he voted for\nHitler in 1933 --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- something unthinkable for my parents.",
        "Q: And you meet him because he\u2019s the pastor of the church, yes?",
        "A: I was the first of the family to meet him, because we\u2019ve had a very, very nice old Pastor\nLange, and Pastor Lange was supposed to retire. And I think we went there for Christmas and for\nEaster, that was about the amount of time my -- my parents spent in a church. And then my\nfather heard there was a new pastor and that was the time he decided that his daughter should\nstart going to Sunday school. And I attended the very first service Martin Niemoeller ever held in\nDahlem.",
        "Q: Really? Yes.",
        "A: And I -- I had been taken there against my will, because I had a hockey game that day. They\nwere always held on Sundays, much to my father\u2019s chagrin. So he took me -- he dragged me, and\n-- and handed me over physically to one of the ushers, and I sat in the front -- front aisle.",
        "Q: In the pew?",
        "A: Pew, in the front, pew, and decided to behave as outrageously as possible, sticking my tum --\ntongue out, and -- and I was full of freckles, you know, looking as unkempt as possible, even\nthough I\u2019d been forced to take a bath before. And there comes this good looking -- with our old,\nwhite haired Pastor Lange, comes that good looking, slender, very dark man, he had pitch black\nhair. Ver -- olive complexion, otherwise he reminded me of my father. And then he started to\ntalk to us children, not about Jesus or v -- the Virgin Mary or anything, but about his time in\nWorld War I as a submarine commander.",
        "Q: This was his first sermon?",
        "A: That -- very wise, because everybody was listening. And I decided I would love that man. But\nI didn\u2019t let -- know of -- anybody of the family know. I came home and I dis -- my father I felt\ndeserved punishment for -- for forcing me to go there, and my father asked, \u201cOh, how was it?\u201d\nOh, oh, was okay. \u201cWho -- how was the new pastor?\u201d Oh, he\u2019s okay, you know. \u201cAnd what did\nhe talk about, what\u2019s his name?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I knew darn well, you know. But as time\nprogressed, my parents went over to his house and I -- they came to our house, and I decided to\ntry the Niemoeller children, but a minister\u2019s children are notorious for being pious, and ha! Did I\nmeet a bunch? Six children with a -- three of them black, like the father, and three of them\nblonde with blue eyes like the mother, and gorgeous children. And I fit in like th-the runt of the\nlitter, you know?",
        "Q: The runt of the litter.",
        "A: Absolutely, and I -- I lived in there and roamed around the vast parsonage, and there was --\nthat house was so noisy, you wouldn\u2019t believe this -- once in awhile the door would open, and\nthe pastor, with a stentoric voice would ask for -- for -- would demand silence, otherwise he\nwould come and clobber us all. And the children all say, \u201cHe always says, he never does it,\u201d you\nknow. That was my first -- my first visit with Martin Niemoeller. Little did I know --",
        "Q: Little did you know.",
        "A: -- that I was to be --",
        "Q: So you were how old when you first --",
        "A: I-I was nine.",
        "Q: Nine.",
        "A: Or even eight. That was before --",
        "Q: And he must have been in his --",
        "A: He was -- he was 33 years older than I --",
        "Q: Three -- right, right.",
        "A: -- figure it out. Yeah. He was born in \u201992, I was born in --",
        "Q: Born in \u201923.",
        "A: -- \u00b023, yeah.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Thirt -- 32 years old. And then I soon asked my parents to spare me that experience of -- of --\nof children\u2019s services, but let me go with them. Now they started going to church.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: As soon as the Confessing Church was founded by him, they -- and soon as I had been -- had\nbeen confirmed, I became a member -- we became member --",
        "Q: Of the Confessing Church?",
        "A: -- of the Confessing Church, yes. And now, in my eyes, I mean he was an endangered species\nof course, because I va -- Frau Niemoeller came all the time and told me the Gestapo had called,\nthey had searched the house and all that. So I decided when the Gestapo comes, I will save his\nlife. So I went to Woolworth -- and I got a very meager amount of money each week and bought\na chain and a lock, with which I was going to -- what\u2019s the English word? The Gestapo 1 --",
        "Q: You -- yo --",
        "A: -- keeping him -- keeping them from -- from --",
        "Q: Getting him?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, you were going to lock him up, or you were going -- no, you were going to lock --",
        "A: No, I was going to lock the Gestapo up.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, I was not modest in my exp -- but 1t never happened.",
        "Q: Never happened, right. You didn\u2019t have that chance.",
        "A: But I heard every one of his -- of his sermons.",
        "Q: How old were you when you were confirmed? What is the age?",
        "A: Iwas 15.",
        "Q: 15.",
        "A: He was in the con -- I had hoped, while in boarding school, 14 - 15, that by the time I came\nout, he would be able to confirm me, but no such thing.",
        "Q: But he wasn\u2019t -- right.",
        "A: So his -- his successor or hi -- rather his -- his -- yeah, [indecipherable] Helmut Gollwitzer, he\nconfirmed me in his stead.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: By that time I had already witnessed Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: In Eberswalde.",
        "Q: Right. Well let\u2019s -- let\u2019s go back just -- just a little bit here. When you\u2019re going to school, and\nthere are Nazi kids, this is after \u201933 --",
        "A: Well, yeah, well there was --",
        "Q: Why did you hit Ribbentrop\u2019s daughter? What happened?",
        "A: Because she\u2019d been fresh to me, an I remember s -- I had to climb on a -- on the bench in\norder to reach her because she was so big.",
        "Q: You slapped her across the face?",
        "A: I slapped her across her stupid face. She was a nice girl, really.",
        "Q: She was?",
        "A: But we -- but that, 1t was personal, that really was personal.",
        "Q: That wasn\u2019t political.",
        "A: Bettina von Ribbentrop, and my father was so proud of me.",
        "Q: Yes. What did the teacher do when you did that?",
        "A: Teacher was not in the room. He was -- it was in dur -- during intermission, you know,\nsomething like that.",
        "Q: Over recess. And what -- and Scholz-Klink\u2019s daughters were there too?",
        "A: Both -- God, I completely forgot that. Both daughters of Madame Scholz-Klink, the\nReichsfrauenfuehrerin, she attended -- was in my -- they were in my class, in the same\nclassroom. Isolde, and I don\u2019t remember the name of the other. Well, with them you really had to\nbe careful. And the children --",
        "Q: Excuse me.",
        "A: -- of -- of -- of Himmler, the daughter of Himmler, Gudrund -- Gudrund, of course, she was a\nfew years younger. And the children of Woost, two daughters, they were also in another grade,\nbut you w -- w -- I saw them every day. They were -- they managed to get a teacher fired, but\nfortunately he did not end up in a concentration camp, the best teacher the school had. They told\ndaddy about a few remarks he had made, daddy took care of them. It was -- you know, what I\nlearned at home was to keep my mouth shut outside. You know, I was a blabbermouth, but not in\nthese things. And I was revolting against -- rebelling against my parents except in that one field.\nAnd so what I was taught -- I always say that, was the meaning of conspirative behavior, very\nearly. I mean, Jewish families can talk about their children learning it at a -- at a very early age.\nAnd the -- the meaning of your own conscience, how very, very important that was, that intact\nconscience. Never do u -- or -- 0-or say anything that you might not be able to sleep at night.\nAnd that was key in both life, for me it was normal, was nothing. And I had Ditte, of course.",
        "Q: And she was at that school?",
        "A: Ditte was next to me always. We were a feared duo. But she had to be much more careful\nbecause of her Jewish mother. What they left, that could only be done in -- in Dahlem, in Berlin.\nThey left a very quiet life. The children, they didn\u2019t even have piano lessons, nothing, you know?\nThey lived the Jewish family life, and that\u2019s how Ditte\u2019s mother survived. With her looks, to me\nstill a mystery.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to have to change the tape, so --",
        "A: Already?",
        "Q: Yes.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Okay. I will -- I -- Iam going to ask you in a minute about something that you did with a ka --\nwith Kaiser Wilhelm, but I want to ask you, because you just ended talking about what you were\ntaught at home about being at school. I imagine there 1s -- there are Nazi flags up, or there is a lot\nof -- you have to -- did you have to s -- s -- do the heil Hitler in the morning when the teacher\ncomes in?",
        "A: Not yet. That came as time went on. The first years -- few years, it was Gut Morgen.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And -- yes, and I don\u2019t remember the exact point in -- during which that wer -- heil Hitler was\nintroduced.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But even by the way, a teacher would greet the class with a German salute, you knew whether\nthe -- she -- it was only female te -- no, no, we had two male teachers, whether they were Nazis\nor not. I -- I knew why, you know. I was brought up with that six and seventh and eighth sense,\nand which has led me through my life, by --",
        "Q: So what did -- what did you mean when you said what your -- your -- y-you were clearly a so\n-- sort of a wild kid --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- or at least very devilish.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But in this area --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in the political area, you trusted what your parents said, and you followed them.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s right. Absolutely.",
        "Q: So were they telling you to be quiet in school?",
        "A: That is the most wondrous thing. I was never told, don\u2019t repeat that outside of the house. I\nknew. I just knew.",
        "Q: You just knew.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, by the way, that -- that -- there was a period of rebellion after I -- in ni -- in 1933\nmy father had taken us to Unter den Linden to see Hindenburg and Hitler. And on the way back I\nremember my brother and I, we both decided to count flags hanging out of the windows. And\nwhen we arrived home, I had more, but that -- it came out that I had counted the -- I -- th-the\nswastika flags, and my brother had counted the black, white, and red. And I se -- I count -- I have\nmore, and for that fact alone, my mother slapped me across the face. Hakenkreuzfahen. You just\nnever do that. And then that night I decided to become Nazi, and with the goal of eventually\nmarrying Hitler, or becoming his cook.",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite an idea.",
        "A: Well, you know Hitler -- and even my father was -- he w -- my father was so wonderful, he\nsaid, \u201cWell, have you ever thought about the fact that when Hitler\u2019s getting older, and you will\nhave to wait for an awfully long time to marry him. Why don\u2019t you plan to be his cook?\u201d Okay.\nSo every morning when he -- I came down, he say, \u201cWhat would you like to cook for your fuihrer\ntoday? Spinach? Brussel sprouts?\u201d You know, he was a vegetar -- so that period did not last\nlong.",
        "Q: And your father didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No, no, no --",
        "Q: -- cri -- nobody criticized you, they just let you go.",
        "A: -- no, not at all, he re -- he seemed very str -- stern, but --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- very serious about it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then something happened that made me change my mind, not my parents. I was invited\nto the home of a mutual friend notorious anti-Nazi, who had a tea party in her beautiful house.\nAnd since I often visited her, I rang the doorbell, and I said, \u201cCan a -- can I come in?\u201d And the --\nthe servant said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t come in today, Frau Pietschker,\u201d -- ha -- was her name, \u201cshe has\nher tea party.\u201d And sh -- there appears Frau Pietschker in a beautiful flowered dress. And she\nsays, \u201cCome in, come in, I want to show you to my ladies,\u201d you know. And she had a beautiful\noval salon, with tables like this, and a free room in the front. She drags me -- I was in leather\npants, you know? No socks are on, just -- just sandals, not washed, nothing. And she puts me in\nthe middle of the room, and says, \u201cLadies, just listen for one moment. This is Ulrich von Sell\u2019s\ndaughter. She is a Nazi.\u201d I -- I hoped the floor would open and swallow me because the laughter\nthat followed was -- would -- I know it would follow me for a lifetime, and it did. I went home\nand all the Nazi things that I\u2019d gathered, everything with the -- with the swastika on it, I put in an\nold handkerchief, and carried them out to the garbage, but I threw them in somebody else\u2019s\ngarbage. That was the end.",
        "Q: Now why was this the end, what -- what did it mean to you?",
        "A: I -- I was so -- that my father -- well, you know, I -- everybody knew my father, you know? It\nwas so humiliating to me, that I didn\u2019t show much character and stood up for the man I loved. I\njoined the other side. And that was the brief intermission, the brief period.",
        "Q: Now, were these people pro-Nazi?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Q: They weren\u2019t. And so they were laughing because --",
        "A: No, that\u2019s why they laughed.",
        "Q: -- they couldn\u2019t believe it.",
        "A: They just could not believe it. I --",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: -- we never had an ow -- of course we di -- we never went to Nazi\u2019s houses, nor did Nazis --\nNazi Germans, as one should really say, come to our house. It was just -- I -- I remember we\nwere good friends, one of -- last German ambassador to -- Dickhoff was his name, he lived a few\nhouses down the street. He came to dinner a few times, but then when Hitler progressed, he was\npersona non grata. I didn\u2019t even notice, but you know --",
        "Q: As a kid, let\u2019s say up to the age of 15 -- 14 or 15, how did you understand what it was that\nyour parents were against in terms of the Nazis? What -- what was it? Cause your father -- long\ntime --",
        "A: It was really -- and the -- he foresaw, years before Hitler came, what would happen if he came\nto power, because Hitler didn\u2019t fall from the sky like a meteor, you know? He had been a -- a\nknown agitator on the political scene for 14 years. I was against everything that Hitler did or\nsaid, I didn\u2019t specify, you know? I -- and then of course, were the Jews, the Jews, the Jews. We\nhad Jewish friends.",
        "Q: Did you listen to Hitler\u2019s speeches on the radio?",
        "A: No, no, no, Hitler\u2019s speeches were not listened to in our house. It was on very early put on the\nBBC, and that too, my -- there my father instructed us, when you -- when you listen to -- found\nthe station BBC, you ha -- after you turn off the radio -- radio entered our house late, in \u201936\nmaybe, you have to put the knob back to anything else. Sure enough, when the Gestapo came to\nthe house, it was after Martin Niemoeller\u2019s incarceration, the first thing the f -- man number one\ndid, go the radio and turn it on.",
        "Q: To see what station.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Was a German station.",
        "Q: It was a German station.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Right. Now, we can go back a little bit because I know you want to tell the story about the\nKaiser.",
        "A: Ica -- [have hundreds of stories.",
        "Q: I know you do.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you wanted him to be your guardian, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Or your -- your --",
        "A: My godfather.",
        "Q: -- your godfather.",
        "A: But you know, girls are not godchildren of the Kaiser. So my brother for his birthdays\nreceived all sorts -- is beautiful pla -- silver -- pure silver things. And I never got anything, you\nknow, so I decided if I\u2019d ask my -- my father why da -- isn\u2019t he my godfather. Because that\u2019s\nonly boys, and so on. So I decided as soon as I learned to write -- that had noth -- something to\ndo with it, I would bring about a situation where he couldn\u2019t say no. And then I thought -- I\nwrote, you know, like a child, and I addressed him Liebe Kaiser, dear Emperor, using no name,\nor majesty or some liebe. Some of them are -- one 1s printed in the -- in one of my books, you\nknow, Liebe Kaiser, and then I -- I -- I se -- I didn\u2019t really ask him, but you know, I know you\nare the godfather of my brother, can I be -- please be your godchild too? Something like -- and\nthen I thought it would be very nice if I included a little present, something he could really use.\nAnd I just learned from my grandmother to crochet, a white potholder with a red rim. And I\nenclosed that, and I put it in an envelope. And next time my father went to Holland, I said to him,\nwould he please -- I trusted him, would he please give this to the Kaiser? And my father did, you\nknow, vastly amused, of course. My -- the Kaiser was vastly amused, and from then on, he sent\nme things for my birthday, but no silver plates or anything like that. A scooter. A dynamo light --\na dynamo light for my -- for my -- for my bicycle, stuff like that.",
        "Q: So really good things?",
        "A: And I was conv -- I was convinced that he had tried out the scooter himself, you know, in the\n-- in the -- he went to the store, you know, and o -- did that all himself.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a great story.",
        "A: He was -- he was -- yes, he called me the little monkey. Never referred to me by anything\nelse. But there\u2019s a story behind that.",
        "Q: Yes, do you want to tell it?",
        "A: Yeah, sure. Once we had the brother of the sis -- my sister\u2019s fr -- girlfriend, who was then a\nyoung officer, must have been in \u201937 - \u00b038, who came to visit, not beknownst to us, and at the\ntable already ha -- he had developed Nazi ideas, and I saw my father\u2019s face grow paler and paler,\nbut fortunately the young man had to leave right after -- after dinner, and I was delegated to\naccompany hi -- him to the -- to the underground. And passing Martin Niemoeller\u2019s church, there\nwas a light -- it was already dark, there was a light in the church, and he said, \u201cWell, this is\nThursday evening, so what -- what\u2019s -- what\u2019s going on there?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, those are the -\n- the prayer -- the -- the service 1s held every night for all the pastors in concentration camps.\u201d\nAnd then he started, \u201c\u201cWhat? That is a scandal. I, in a German uniform, trying to defend the,\u201d --\nand I was speechless, and then I looked up to him and I said, \u201cYou ze affe.\u201d \u201cYou monkey.\u201d And\nthen ran away. We never heard from the young man again, fortunately. And my father told that\nstory to -- to his majesty, and his majesty thought it was very amusing, called me little monkey.",
        "Q: Little monkey, right. Now you had governesses?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And is that when you learned English, cause these were English governesses?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Th-That worked. You had a --",
        "A: Three English governesses. Joy, the other one\u2019s name I don\u2019t remember, and Nell, the third\none. All -- w-well the last one we kept connections until far after the war, yes.",
        "Q: And so you learned English from them, is that right?",
        "A: Yeah, yes. And I had a talent for si -- for -- for --",
        "Q: For languages?",
        "A: -- languages. And of course then we had a f -- a bon -- a French mademoiselle. She couldn\u2019t\nstand the food in the house, which was grim, you know. Prussian food? Forget about it. And --",
        "Q: So did --",
        "A: She couldn\u2019t stand it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So is that why you ate a lot in Ditte\u2019s house?",
        "A: Was always a place there for me. Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: You get very calm when you mention that family. You -- you felt very comfortable there.",
        "A: Yeah, because that was my rock of Gibraltar, you know, that was -- I was -- everybody was so\nhappy to see me. I was one of their children.",
        "Q: So your house was a very serious and obviously --",
        "A: Sinister, almost, you know. You opened the door and the atmosphere was already coming at\nyou. It was only forebodings of -- every day it was something new that Hitler had done, or order,\nwhatever. And he -- my father had been right in everything.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s also interesting because in this house that\u2019s partially Jewish, because the mother\nis Jewish --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- they are not as -- it\u2019s not as sinister, and they are more vulnerable.",
        "A: Oh, exactly.",
        "Q: Or would appear to be more vulnerable.",
        "A: Exactly, mommy -- I called her mommy. Mommy wanted -- she loved, she adored children.\nEvery morning she would go to the bakery and buy heaps of -- of -- of cake, just in case the\nchildren brought home friends, and there should be enough to eat for everybody. But in -- you\nknow, then came a time when they had to, except for the little boy, had to tell the three daughters\nwhat -- you know, th-the dangers they were in. And she -- they tried to get all the children out of\nthe country. They succeeded with the oldest one, Eve. Eve still lives in England, she\u2019s now 86 or\n88, and it was too late for -- for the other ones to get out of the country. And the little boy,\nHerman, that was my so-called foster brother, he was the first German student to enter the United\nStates after the war.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Got a law degree, he married Phyllis Fritchie, does the name mean anything to you?",
        "Q: So -- n --",
        "A: He has the north -- had the North Virginia Sun, or something, newspaper man.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And he was Stevenson\u2019s campaign manager.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And Herman wound up as the ambassador for the United States under Reagan in South\nAfrica. That\u2019s a career. But we got kind of, you know --",
        "Q: Now, let me a -- the -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if -- if you can even answer this question, do\nyou think your house might have been severe -- y-you talk about a sort of Prussian atmosphere --",
        "A: Severity, yeah.",
        "Q: -- even if there were no Nazis?",
        "A: Good question, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You think it really was this political --",
        "A: My father tended to melancholia and to depression, that\u2019s what I inherited from him.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Now, thanks to modern medicine, I don\u2019t have that any more.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And my mother was, you know, she was even, and lighthearted, and -- and she must have\nsuffered like hell, too, you know? Always grim moods. And then, of course, being in the position\nhe was in, whenever he was there, there were daily fights with the so-called Empress, who\nloathed my father.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And my fa -- I say that in my books, too, it came to such a point that the -- that at night 1 -- th-\nthe door to the apartment of -- there were -- there was a glass door, was not knocked but\nhammered on in the middle of the night and my father opened the -- the door, and outside stood a\nlittle man with his nightshirt on, and a f -- and a coat thrown over it, the Kaiser, in tears. He\nwould say to my father, \u201cShe was so bad to me again.\u201d \u201cSie war immer so schlecht zu mir.\u201d She\nwas absolutely wicked, and the ki -- my father said at one point to us children, and he had also\nmade it known in Doorn that he would not even go take her for a wa -- go for a walk with her,\nbecause she 1s capable of jumping into the moat and tell the world I pushed her in.",
        "Q: Pushed her, right. Now there -- very early on, Gestapo comes to your house, your father isn\u2019t\nthere. This is in --",
        "A: This 1 --",
        "Q: -- June of 1934 at the -- after the Night of Long Knives, when they kill --",
        "A: Oh, no, no --",

        "A: -- the Gestapo didn\u2019t come.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t come?",
        "A: Nothing happen -- nothing happened that night except for -- except for the fact that, you\nknow, the next day we found out who had been killed, the man who constantly came to the\nhouse, the former Reichskanzler von -- von -- you know, I say the name, I can\u2019t remember it\nnow. Schleicher. He had been murdered, you know, the Gestapo came into his house, and they\nwere having breakfast there, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. He and his wife, dead. And my father\nwas in Holland at the time. He came back, you know, just for a few days, he came back, I sat on\nhis lap, where I belonged, in his study, and the phone rings. And my father said -- he was so\ntired, he said, \u201cYou take it.\u201d And on the phone, that must have been second of July, third of July,\n1934, a fat voice --",
        "Q: A fat voice?",
        "A: A fat voice, not -- you know, I use -- they usually identify themselves, and this is so and so,\ncan -- Herr von Sell! So I had the receiver to my father, and I saw, \u201cYes?\u201d And then just a, \u201cyes,\nyes.\u201d And then he hung up. It had been Goring, telling him that he shouldn\u2019t feel all too sure\nabout his being safe, the next time they would get him. And from that day on, I was so afraid of\nmy father\u2019s -- of my father\u2019s --",
        "Q: And your father told you immediately, then?",
        "A: Well, I was --",
        "Q: 10 -- you were just 10.",
        "A: -- you know, this far from him. He was paralyzed, almost. That overwhelmingly fat -- it\u2019s a\nfat voice, like nobody -- you know, high pitched. And because my father, of all the Nazis, he --\nhe hated th -- the one he hated the most was Goring, because Goring should have had\n[indecipherable] a flier, a gentleman, coming from a good family, he should have known better.\nInstead he played God, and the famous saying that, I decide who is Aryan or not, indicated that\nhe was in the position to decide over life and death.",
        "Q: And why would Goring be calling your father?",
        "A: Because there was a list, obviously, and he was missed.",
        "Q: He was missed? He must have --",
        "A: He wa -- my father wa -- must have --",
        "Q: -- must have been on the list?",
        "A: Yeah. And so he took the receiver himself and called my father up. There had been -- my fa --\nGoring was a personal enemy of my father\u2019s. My father had two personal enemies under the --\namong the Nazis. One was Keitel, Field Marshall Keitel, and one was Goring. And those days it\nwas Goring who was much more powerful, you know. Goring was, among other things, he was a\nbig hunter. And he would deal with my father for the permission to hunt at one of the estates that\nbelonged to the Kaiser.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And my father said nyet just a few times too often, until Goring didn\u2019t have to ask permission\nany more, just went. And not even -- he not only came back with the horns or whatever, but for\nth -- terribly precious pictures, carpets and so on. But there was very little my father could do.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And Goring once -- that -- that really did the trick. When Goring came to a party of the\nHohenzollerns to which he had not been invited. Oh boy, yeah.",
        "Q: And he was asked to leave?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And your father was the one?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, there were Nazis among the Hohenzollerns. Victoria Louisa. The Kaiser\u2019s only\ndaughter. The mother of the future queen of Greece, who went to school with me in\n[indecipherable]. She -- she was ready for the 80\" birthday of her father, where the entire\nmishpowha came, to wear on her beautiful dress, a swastika of diamonds. And my father stood in\nthe door, and he said, \u201cWith that thing on, you have to step over my body.\u201d She took it off. There\nwas Prince Auguste Wilhelm, there were plenty -- and even the Crown Prince. He came to the --\nhe came to the -- the Potsdam ceremony without being invited. You know, to get himself in with\nthe Nazis. He might be king one day, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No dignity.",
        "Q: Now, your father is clearly known as an anti-Nazi, the family is known as an anti-Nazi.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, oh absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Q: But there is no -- at this point, this is early on, \u201933 - \u00b034 - \u00b035.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: There\u2019s no resistance group of which he\u2019s a part. So he\u2019s not --",
        "A: There were -- well, there was no -- you know, there was no resistance movement in Germany\nbecause we couldn\u2019t move. The first batch of resisters that had been, th -- the feared\nCommunists.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the same time that Hitler, in Potsdam, said he would be a good and peaceful leader. The\nfirst prisoners were marched into saxen -- in-into Sachsenhausen concentration camp, only a\nstone throw away. It was the Socialists, the Communists, the trade unionists. And that was all the\nresistance there was. Then came that huge goo -- that group, sizeable group of those who said he\nwon\u2019t be so bad, you know, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s ra -- as a matter of fact, we'll deal with him. And then\ncame the rather big group of those who decided to go into inner-emigration, be Nazi, and don\u2019t\ndo anything. And those, after the war, were the most despicable ones, because they could -- they\nclaimed they were not anti-Nazi -- they were anti-Nazis, but they didn\u2019t do anything.",
        "Q: So you w --",
        "A: And that\u2019s when my parents decided to put up a fight wherever it was possible. Getting to\nHitler is as -- is as a -- was as impossible as it is now to get rid of Fidel Castro. Once a dictator\nhas established himself, it is almost impossible to get rid of him. And so you must -- you -- there\nwere plenty of things, especially helping, helping Jews. And that developed slowly, until the\nJews were really in vital danger, in mortal danger. And that\u2019s when the Countess Maltzan was\none of them. She worked with my fa -- oh, my father, I have to say, was inducted into the\nGerman army, even though he was so terribly wounded, and he was much too old, after -- a-at --\nat the beginning of the war, and --",
        "Q: In 1939?",
        "A: -- in \u201939, and wa -- and he was sacked by them in -- must have been \u201942. His -- his boss was\nCanaris, and at the same outfit where he was -- where he was working, there -- it was since --\ncensorship of letters. And that is when he -- he and the ga -- Countess Maltzan -- and she only\ntold me that after the war, and that\u2019s where we got most of the Jews that came to the house, you\nknow?",
        "Q: So Jews were being hidden in your house?",
        "A: I -- they --",
        "Q: Or passing through?",
        "A: -- it wa -- passing through. Our house could -- even though where there were no children in\nthe house, 1-it -- people could not be hidden. They just -- they just pa -- they just received shelter\nfor awhile, claiming to be a seamstress, a gardener. And then of course th -- of the greatest help\nwere the air raids, and the -- the destruction, so a man could turn up, unless he looked like -- like\na Jew, and say all my papers were burned.",
        "Q: Right, right, so you didn\u2019t have --",
        "A: So we loved the British, especially the British, for -- you know, unloading their bombs over\nour heads, even though I must say I was terrified of them.",
        "Q: I can imagine, I can imagine.",
        "A: Terrified. Yet we blessed -- we blessed them every day, and prayed for their safe home --\nhome-going.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And that\u2019s why -- it was as you d -- declare somebody as a -- as a cousin of a chauffeur of a\nsomething like that, wasn\u2019t all too difficult. Living in the house for any length of time would\nhave been too -- too different.",
        "Q: Well, especially in that neighborhood, I imagine.",
        "A: I mean, hiding -- and especially in that neighborhood.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Hiding in the middle of the city, not so bad. But in order to hide one Jew, that is not clear to\neverybody who just talks about it, you have to have -- first of all, no children in the house. They\nblabber out --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the truth, you know, th-that new aunt of mine, you know, something like that. And there\nhas to be -- there have to be extra rations.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So you have to -- the butcher, have grocer, a doctor -- something like that, and it\u2019s a vast ho --\nthe smaller the cell, the better. You are not supposed to know what the other one did.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I found out rather late about the Scholls in Munich. Munich was a planet away.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: There was nothing in the media, and that was -- it was, you know, that\u2019s -- of course it -- word\ngot around, but Berlin and Dahlem, and with these five families were wonderful, we were never\nfound out. Nobody was found out.",
        "Q: And the Scholls, you\u2019re talking about The White Rose, you\u2019re talking about the students, yes.",
        "A: Yes, The White Rose, yes, yes. Cause th-the surviving sister came to visit Martin often after\nthe war, after he -- when I was there in Wiesbaden.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They were true heroes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Those were true heroes. While the resistance group that concentrated, it must have been in 38\n- \u00b039, planning to get rid of Adolf Hitler, the 20\" of July \u201944 group.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know how Hitler -- tha -- I don\u2019t know how many there -- SS nation attempts there were\nagainst Hitler, it\u2019s almost, you know -- several dozen, and they all failed. Hitler had, first of all,\nhad the instinct of an animal. And my -- and a distant uncle of mine von Gasthof, he was a major\nin the army, and was supposed to receive Hitler rather late for -- 40\u2019s, to visit a museum, that\nZeughaus, the military museum in Berlin, and had stuffed himself with bombs, and he would --\nwas ready to embrace Hitler in a deadly embrace. Hitler sh -- used another entry, and my uncle\nhad a hell of a time disarming himself.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: But it happened again, and again --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and again. And so then na -- by 1941 we started with the Jews, or na -- \u201940 - \u00b041 - 42, then\ncame these many evenings in our house where visitors came at night, among them our neighbor\nAdmiral Canaris. General Oster, Count Henkel von Donnersmark, my two f -- cousins, Haeften,\nUlrich von Hassel. And they came at night, and my ma -- the first time they came, I asked my\nmother what are they doing? And she said, \u201cSie morden.\u201d \u201cThey are committing murder.\u201d And\nthen they would leave one by one, back of the house, and all that. The only one who survived\nwas the Count Henkel von Donnersmark. And I saw him many times after the war, all the others\nwere --",
        "Q: They were killed.",
        "A: -- hanged.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. We have to stop the tape.",
        "A: Again?\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: In 1937, you are sent to a boarding school.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why? Why did they send you away\u201d?",
        "A: Well, for two reasons. First of all, I should get away from Ditte, my twin at heart, and I\nshould meet girls from my own s -- from my own caste. And that was a b-boarding -- elite\nboarding school, small, for daughters of -- for the noble names. There were three girls there who\nwere not members of nobility, and they g-got to hear it every day. That really wasn\u2019t fitting, you\nknow, not [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So there\u2019s a kind of meanness in this group?",
        "A: Oh, a kind, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, anyway, I was there for t -- sent there for th -- the other was --",
        "Q: Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Why were you ha -- why did you have to separate from Ditte? Why -- were you two just crazy",
        "A: W-We were two -- we had a terrible influence on one another, you know, that\u2019s why. But it\nwas a friendship that wouldn\u2019t break to this day. And -- and then the other reason was that the\nsituation with the BDM or the Hitler Youth was getting more precarious every day. So that was\nthe beginning of a phase, you know, when I went to that school, later to other schools, where I\ntrained myself -- or I s -- I thought of it myself. When asked, are you in the BDM, I said, \u201cOf\ncourse, in Berlin.\u201d\u201d You know, I mean, I\u2019m here only temporarily, why should I -- you know. And\nI did th -- I repeated that and it worked until shortly before graduation, they wouldn\u2019t let me\ngraduate.",
        "Q: Because they knew it was not true.",
        "A: [indecipherable] it wasn\u2019t true, no, no. Found out.",
        "Q: Now, how 1s -- how is Ditte surviving? Do they know that their mother is Jewish --",
        "A: Miracle.",
        "Q: -- or they don\u2019t know?",
        "A: Yes, by that time they -- of Jewish extraction, you know, somehow.",
        "Q: So is she a mischlinge?",
        "A: -- but Ditte -- she was a mish -- sh-she would have been called a mischlinge first --",
        "Q: First class.",
        "A: First grade or first class.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: And she even -- she went to st -- as a student to Heidelberg and -- and signed a document with\nher name that she was purely Aryan. She was -- it was one miracle after the other. And she did\nher own resisting in Heidelberg, my God --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- yeah. The more you were in danger, the more you did. You know, it became a sport.",
        "Q: Why, because you think that some of these people had nothing to lose?",
        "A: Well, it c -- became -- I don\u2019t know what it was, I don\u2019t know what it was.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s certainly not true for a lot of people.",
        "A: Oh, you better believe it, yeah, but through those inactive anti-Nazis, I have very little to s --\nall this they have really good reasons to explain their inertia. And those who said bad things will\nnot happen in Germany because we wouldn\u2019t let them do them, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah. Were you very sad to leave, to go to boarding school?",
        "A: Oh, I hated it. I hated it and I planned my escape from there to Holland, to the Kaiser. And in\nmy dreams at night, just before going to sleep, I would imagine how he would stand there,\nopening his arms, oh my poor, poor child, of course you can stay here. But then behind him was\nthat witch, and she\u2019d say no.",
        "Q: And you --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- and you knew that she would not approve, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, of course.",
        "Q: But you still fantasized this escape?",
        "A: I met Kaiser in -- so-called majesty [indecipherable] only once, and there was instant loathing\non both sides.",
        "Q: Of her?",
        "A: I wa -- of her --",
        "Q: Of her, and --",
        "A: And -- and -- and she for me. She later complained to my father, your daughter behaved in a\nterrible way, you know. My father just smiled.",
        "Q: And how old were you when you met?",
        "A: Nine.",
        "Q: Nine.",
        "A: 10-11.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Was in Berlin.",
        "Q: Now you also had to leave Sunday school, so you couldn\u2019t see -- because this is 19 --",
        "A: No, but I -- yeah --",
        "Q: Well, 37 --",
        "A: \u00b037 Pm --",
        "Q: -- he\u2019s already -- is --",
        "A: I was home for the first time from boarding school for summer vacation, and then came the\nnews that he had been arrested.",
        "Q: Rested.",
        "A: And I remember jumping on my bicycle, going from friend to friend to friend, telling them all\nthe terrible news, which was in the newspapers the next day, you know. Awful.",
        "Q: Were you worried over the last few years both about your father and about Niemoeller? Was\nhe",
        "A: Niemoeller, yes, of course, I had fallen in love with Niemoeller at age 13 - 14, al-allowed\nmyself to get a first rate crush on him.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Cause he would hardly notice me, you know. And of course I was terribly worried. And the\nwhole family alone now, and my father went right over, he couldn\u2019t go on summer vacation with\nus, because he felt he had to take care of the family, but they had -- they had many friends.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They did not -- were not needy, I mean, in a -- 1-1 -- in a physical kind of way.",
        "Q: And where would -- where did the fam -- where did Mrs. Niemoeller and their six children at\nthis point --",
        "A: This -- they still -- they still lived -- they still lived in the parsonage.",
        "Q: In the parsonage?",
        "A: Yes. And lived there until 19 -- until the time that Martin was transferred from Dachau --",
        "Q: To sa --",
        "A: -- from -- sorry, from Sachsenhausen to Dachau, then she moved in with friends at Lake\nStarnberg so she could visit her husband.",
        "Q: And she was allowed to do that?",
        "A: Yes, once in awhile she could visit him.",
        "Q: That\u2019s unusual.",
        "A: There were di -- well, everything was unusual because he was Hitler\u2019s only private pri --\nprisoner.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Legally he could -- they couldn\u2019t do anything about him at -- the highest German court had\nacquitted him, which at 1938 proved that there were judges in Germany who based their\njudgments, their verdicts on the law --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and on the law alone.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Which deeply disturbed Hitler.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now, when you\u2019re at this terrible school.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You go for a walk. You actually shake Hitler\u2019s hand at the [indecipherable]. What happened?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, well that wasn\u2019t -- you know, we were taken -- we were dragged on walks every\nafternoon, and what --",
        "Q: You were dragged?",
        "A: How do you know -- two by two --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and then -- and one day we did not go in the woods, we were j -- one of our classmates had\nhad a -- an operation, I think it was appendicitis and we were supposed to visit her in the\nhospital. That was in 1938 in the summer, I believe. And we ma -- just four or six of us marched\n-- with a teacher, marched towards the town and in town, you know and the -- I still remember\nthe street, I could find it again, with ugly apartment buildings. Eberswalde is the name of the --\nthe -- the -- th-the t-town of 37. Notorious now for anti-Semitism and anti-foreignenism, you\nknow. And the Nazism, of course. And we -- about twice as far as from here to -- to that door,\nwe see several huge limousines with -- open cars and limousines with swastika emblems and we\nstood still and the teachers [indecipherable] what might that be, you know? And there was either\npolicemen, I don\u2019t -- uniformed men who kept us back, just a moment, you can\u2019t pass through\nhere. And the very moment we had arrived, as close as now as from here to the door --",
        "Q: So about 10 feet.",
        "A: -- that door opens and out comes a group of men, and with them a li -- a man ma -- about my\nsize, with a moustache and a va -- za -- Bavarian hat on, trenchcoat, no uniform, nothing. And by\nJove, it was Adolf Hitler. And he sees us, and he thinks we\u2019ve appeared in his honor, of course,\nyou know? And we just stood there, so he went fwa -- one -- one to one, shaking hands, and\nasking o-our names and where we came from and all that, and then he j -- just went in the car and\ndrove away. We didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t really b -- nobody believed us but the next day it was in the\nnewspapers that Hitler had visited the widow of an old comrade in Eberswalde, so there was --\nPll never forget his fishy handsa -- shake.",
        "Q: He had a fishy handshake?",
        "A: Fishy handshake. And while my mother got sick while there wa -- once their eyes crossed in -\n- in an opera, during an opera visit, my mother became so violently ill my father had to take her\nhome, she couldn\u2019t sit thr -- through the opera. And others were obsessed with his charisma and\nhis blue eyes, I felt nothing. There was a ver -- a vo -- a very ordinary man, and he was even\nsmiling. But I had no --",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: Nothing. While one of the girls sank to the ground, and wanted to kiss the spot that Hitler\u2019s\nfoot had touched.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s -- well, that was my meeting with Hitler.",

        "Q: So how were you with these girls at the school, you --",
        "A: I -- some of them, thi -- they were all -- all came, except for me and a couple of others who c -\n- were -- came from Berlin or Hamburg, they came from vast estates.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, very wealthy.",
        "A: And never seen anything except foxes and hares and deer. Well, well, was okay, I\u2019m --",
        "Q: Was there any indoctrination at the school, or -- is --",
        "A: No.",

        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: This is just --",
        "A: None.",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: We knew the -- the -- the headmistresses both were very strong anti-Nazis.",
        "Q: Oh, they were?",
        "A: Oh yes. But they had -- for instance, they had to put up the swastika flag every day, and have\nit a -- just to s -- let the neighbors think we were --",
        "Q: And did most of you realize that this was a kind of conspiracy?",
        "A: Most of them didn\u2019t give a -- didn\u2019t give a hang about it. I was the only one who was\npolitically informed.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The only one.",

        "A: You know -- yeah, it -- it was terrible, absolutely terrible. Insufficient too, you know. Cheap,\nand -- but that was Prussian, you know.",
        "Q: This was part of the Prussian upbringing?",
        "A: Part of the Prussian upbringing was also to be of nobility and not to wear glasses. Can you\nimagine Frederick the Great, and Martin Luther with glasses? Stupid. Two of the girls were\nextremely short sighted. Nearsighted.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re not allowed to wear glasses?",
        "A: Yes, they were.",
        "Q: They were?",

There was of the --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- howling of people, chanting. Broken glass, broken doors, everything. And all of a sudden I\nfound myself shoved and pressed against the -- the fence separating me and the -- and the\nsynagogue. And I was immediately -- I noticed that the fire brigade, the fire hoses were in this\ndirection, one house, another house, in between was the burn -- burning synagogue, and outside\nlater the -- the -- the si-silver items and the Torah scrolls which they had taken apart and\ntrampled on by Hitler Youth and SR. There was to -- there was no SS there, as far as I remember.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re 14 years old? No.",
        "A: 15.",

        "A: 15.",
        "Q: 15.",
        "A: I was so shocked.",
        "Q: This was a big impression on you.",
        "A: That was -- of course, I mean had I been at home in Dahlem, I wouldn\u2019t have seen anything\nbecause there were no shops, you know, nothing. None of my family saw anything, I was the\nonly one, thanks to the fact -- and then Jews driven out of the synagogue, with the --",
        "Q: And you saw that?",
        "A: -- ye -- I -- oh, I saw the -- must have been the rabbi\u2019s family and thrown on trucks, speeding\naway and that was it. And I went home and that same evening I wrote a description to my parents\nending with the words in German, of course, people behaved like wild beasts. Yeah, that was it.",
        "Q: And is this a turning -- for many people this 1s a turning point.",
        "A: Well, it --",
        "Q: -- or was this something --",
        "A: Not for me, really.",
        "Q: Not for you.",
        "A: No, no, it would have -- course it was everything -- one hopes, especially as a child, that\nevery deed like that will be the last one, you know? Ha! We hadn\u2019t seen the beginning yet.",
        "Q: No. Did your parents want to leave Germany?",
        "A: Never, never.",
        "Q: Never. They never thought about it?",
        "A: Oh no. A country they -- their families, their clan had helped to build up over centuries?\nWould have been desertion. And there is the fact that once you\u2019re out you can\u2019t do anything any\nmore. No, no, they didn\u2019t have to for racial reasons. The Jews had nothing else to do if they\nwanted to save their lives. Because the --",
        "Q: So there was a sense of responsibility to stay?",
        "A: Absolutely. To be there, to stay there and take over once the time has passed.",
        "Q: Right. Did you expect war?",
        "A: My father told in -- 1 -- said that in 1933.",
        "Q: It would be war?",
        "A: Iremember him saying to my then brother -- no, he later became my -- my brother-in-law, my\nsister\u2019s husband, and you will see that the day will come -- first of all, he was a paper\nmanufacturer, that if you make toilet rolls this wide, and if you want to make them a little wider,\nyou'll be in a concentration camp. And Hitler will start a war, he was only waiting for an\nopportunity. Of course, that we always -- and you know when -- when -- when the war started, I\nwas kind of elated, because I thought now that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the beginning of a -- of the end --",
        "Q: Of the end.",

        "A: She was from -- our family was from Odessa.",

        "A: Second time was when his beloved Rotterdam was laid into ashes by the Nazis. And the third\ntime was when Hitler started his war against Russia. That I remember.",
        "Q: So you were there at each of these times to see him?",
        "A: Yes, yes, that\u2019s when I --",
        "Q: So there may have been --",
        "A: I witnessed it.",
        "Q: -- many more times that he cried, but you --",
        "A: Probably, probably.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: My father was so sensitive and so -- oh, well I sa -- I said to Elie Wiesel, you know, for 40\nyears, four oh years, I was not able to mention my father and his -- his -- not talk about ma --\nabout him at all, because I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t. Even my own son was of the opinion that in the\nwake of the 20\" of July, my father had somehow lost his life. That was good enough for him,\nyou know. And then -- but after I met Elie Wiesel, he said -- it was up in his apartment on th --\nstill on the West Side, which was gorgeous. Looking down -- it was April \u201985, looking down on\nthe -- on the park that ju -- was just beginning to bloom, and he said, you know, \u201cAnd now you\nmust tell me all about your father.\u201d And I said, \u201cElie, I can\u2019t. I haven\u2019t done it for 40 years\n[indecipherable].\u201d And he said, \u201cYou must.\u201d And under streaming tears I told him the entire\nstory. After which he s -- Marion was there too. After that he took me in his arms and comforted\nme. And we were at Martin\u2019s grave, by the way, in Germany, together. And he said, \u201cAnd now\nyou have to learn to speak in public about that.\u201d I said, \u201cI can never speak in public.\u201d \u201cOf course\nyou can.\u201d Then later -- a year later, I said -- and he said, \u201cNow you have to write a book.\u201d \u201cI\ncan\u2019t write a book.\u201d \u201cOf course you can.\u201d And then I came to him one day and I said, \u201cElie, I\u2019m\ngoing to be Jewish.\u201d And he said -- he left -- were two -- two words of, he said, \u201cOf course.\u201d",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Beginning and end of discussion. But he has opened windows in my life that I didn\u2019t -- doors\nof my -- in my life that I didn\u2019t even know existed. Bless him for that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And many other things. Yeah, now I\u2019m home, and I\u2019ve been sacked from school.",
        "Q: You -- you were kicked out of school.",
        "A: Yes, I was kicked out.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: Well, I was sent to one of my -- to -- out of the way, a-away, away, to an estate of friends -- of\n-- of -- of -- one of the many estates of family members and I stayed that -- there, until -- because\n-- yeah, I stayed there, helping in the household, you know, learning about household and all\nthat. And then I's -- decided to do something that would vastly amuse his majesty. I declared to\nmy father that I\u2019m going to go be a -- a -- a -- an actress. Go on sta -- an actress. That had never\nhappened in that family --",
        "Q: Oh, of course not.",
        "A: -- to stoop that low, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he went to Holland. Must have been before -- of course, before his death. And he sa -- my\nfather said to His Majesty -- I -- he had to tell him something personal and wanted his advice.\nThe little monkey -- no, my -- my ba -- Billa, he called me, she wants to go on stage. The little\nmonkey wants to be an actress? And then he -- he hit my father on the shoulder, and he said,\n\u2018And to you of all people this must happen.\u201d And he thought it was a marvelous idea, so my\nfather came home in a different mood, and he said, \u201cAll right, if you pass the entrance exam of\nthe state actors school, yi -- I will let you.\u201d And of course, then these things developed, I was\naccepted, and the Kaiser even lived to see it happen.",
        "Q: So where did you get this idea that you wanted to be an actor? How did that happen? Or had\nyou been doing it all your life?",
        "A: Well, I w -- I was enough -- it was probably first of all to shock my grandmother. But\notherwise I wanted to be somebody, you know, by now it was clear that I would not always stay\nquite that homely. And I had boyf -- men friends, always older men as boyfriends. And I was --",
        "Q: Even when you were in boarding school?",

        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, no, no. No, no.",
        "Q: No, once you have been kicked out.",
        "A: Oh, after that, yes. And then, you know, the stage was a very safe place for anti-Nazis.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: You were practically taboo. Ye -- I didn\u2019t have to go to the labor studio -- attend the labor\nservice, nobody asked me about the BDM or party, nothing. You were safe, you were on a\ndifferent level. And I knew that, of course, because I knew enough actors in Berlin now. I had\nmy two years in Berlin of ballet, and of -- education of -- you know.",
        "Q: And when did you -- when did you go to the academy? Was it --",

And it\u2019s still -- it\u2019s still true, you know, what to do as a woman, too, and what not to\ndo. Of course, as an 18 year old -- he would never touch a -- a girl who had no experiences at all,\nbut we were in a relationship, can say that, and two most happy years ended, hit -- 1t never -- it\nwa -- grew into a deep friendship, and ended only with his untimely death in -- in -- I don\u2019t\nremember, \u201968.",

        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, very strange. And his wife, I don\u2019t know how much she knew. She liked me, I liked her.\nAnd well -- and then we --",
        "Q: Was that odd for you as a young person, being with a married man, and knowing the wife, is\nthat odd?",
        "A: But it came so easily --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",

        "Q: It was -- uh-huh.",
        "A: -- it was done so tactfully, and s -- based -- it was based on friendship, and the same political\nopinion. He was the fi -- that, he didn\u2019t tell anybody, the first cousin of Field Marshall\nKesserling.",

        "Q: He was then acting.",
        "A: As a -- only on the theater that was under Goring. And ger -- and Goebbels was movies. And\nthose two had a very intimate enemy-ship, you know? So Goring wouldn\u2019t let anybody touch his\ntheater, and in the -- and Goebbels, he struck him -- Walter Franck from the list of actors to\nappear in movies, because he had never b -- gone to one of his receptions, always inventing one\nailment after the other. So -- but you -- it didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t disturb his theater career.",
        "Q: Right. Were you a good actress, you think? Did you like it?",
        "A: I loved it. But I was then doing my first engagement in Danzig, Nazi town of the first caliber,\nwhich was -- I wasn\u2019t used to that, you know? I -- I began suffering from stage fright, and it\nbecame so bad that I -- aft -- then I went to Essen, and then came the 20\" of July, and the\ntheaters were closed, and Essen was in the war. No Nazis, strangely enough. But the east? They\ngot what they deserved, and they deserved what they got. And the entire ensemble died, because\nthey -- except me, because they tried to flee on the Gustloff, Wilhelm Gustloff, the ship that was\nsunk by a -- by a Russian torpedo. And I would have be -- by God\u2019s grace, I wasn\u2019t. Yeah -- and\nno, but then, after the war, I became -- I became a -- an announcer -- a speaker on -- on the radio.",
        "Q: Right, right, right.",
        "A: That I wer -- no problems at all.",
        "Q: Did your parents see you on stage?",

        "Q: Uh-huh. And did she enjoy that?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: She did?",
        "A: Very strange experience.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- at age 16.",
        "Q: 16.",
        "A: But fortunately he was in Denmark, being stationed in the house of a pastor. And there was a\ndeep friendship, and he -- until the pastor died, visited him after the war, all the time.",
        "Q: Now, I understand that you, in a certain way rejected the confessing -- even the Confessing\nChurch, at a young age?",
        "A: What they did, when they could have done something.",
        "Q: Whey they could have done more.",
        "A: What of -- something, you know.",
        "Q: Something.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s was, you know, the Stuttgart Declaration of guilt.",
        "Q: Yes, explain that, what is -- what was that?",
        "A: That was -- well, when Martin returned from the concentration camp, livid --",
        "Q: This is after?",
        "A: Yeah. A terrible embarrassment for all the people who claimed they couldn\u2019t have done\nanything, you know, and here he comes. Oh, had he only died, they would have built a church\nwith his name and all that. But he came back just at the moment when they began business as\nusual, without a -- anything.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he forced the part, that Stuttgart Declaration. But the most important sentences were\nstricken. The church said we should ask forgiveness because they had not prayed enough, and\nnot done enough. And he said -- Martin said, bullshit. Excuse me. They did nothing. Which is\ntrue, after Hitler was very, very wise, taking him away from his flock, because -- which was\nsupposed to become a resistance group. They -- there were -- there were martyrs there of the\nConfessing Church, fa -- fal -- Snyder you know, and many others. But -- excuse me, senior\nmoment. But as a group they arranged themselves, only to claim after the war that they hadn\u2019t\nprayed enough. Hah! But you know, Martin was a thorn in their flesh from the f -- moment one\nto his death. Before his death he said into movie cameras, television cameras, \u201cAnd if I did not\nreceive my pension from the church, I would become a Quaker.\u201d He wasn\u2019t at the hierarchy, oh\nthat bugged him. He would not resi -- accept the title bishop.",
        "Q: Right. [indecipherable] remained a pastor, yes?",
        "A: He remained pastor and president, president of the church [indecipherable] Council of\nchurches, and president of the -- of the church of Hessen and Nassau.",
        "Q: Right. All right, we have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Sibylle, I asked you a question close to when we stopped, and I think you answered it in a\ndifferent way than I asked it. Why was it that you left the church when -- in your self description\nthat you left the church when you were about 18.",
        "A: 18 - 19, because I realized there w -- it -- the Confessing Church would not live up to Martin\nNiemoeller\u2019s expectations. And they were inert, they did nothing. And my [indecipherable] and\nto add something personal, you know there were three pastors in -- in Dahlem, and there was so\nmuch trouble between them, personal things, that my mother -- my mother and my -- I mean,\nleaving the church doesn\u2019t mean that I declared my -- my -- excuse me, I -- I have to think. No,\nmy -- my parents also -- I didn\u2019t go to church any more, and neither did they. There were --",
        "Q: But you still felt that you were a Christian?",
        "A: Y-Yes, moderately so. But you know then later, when I came to New York and lived among\nJews, the church -- I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t go back to the church there either.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And later when I ma -- ma -- I married Martin Niemoeller, he urged me to study about it\nmore, and gave me books. And what that led to was my conversion to Judaism, because it\u2019s a\nlogical way, you know? I found my roots, that\u2019s what -- how Elie Wiesel put it. I -- I told him\nI\u2019m going to be Jewish, and he said, \u201cOf course, you want to go back to your roots.\u201d",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But during the war period --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that\u2019s not the direction that you feel you\u2019re going in. You just simply are -- you\u2019re angry at\nthe church for what it\u2019s not doing.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m angry at the church, but I would never have formally left it.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Because being a member of the Confessing Church was a sign, an outward sign that you were\nnot for the Nazis.",
        "Q: Right, right. No matter what it wasn\u2019t doing, it still was --",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: -- clearly anti-Nazi.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: Right. Now tell me just a -- a -- the little story about Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s house and what was\ngoing on --",
        "A: Oh, yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: -- in the basement.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Well, after -- that must have been around the 20\" of July, 44, when my father --\nfirst the Gestapo came and -- and took me on the 21\u201c. But --",
        "Q: Do you want to tell the story about the assassination plot, and then this -- and then go to Leni\nRiefenstahl, would that make more sense?",
        "A: Oh no, we -- I can go back and forth.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And -- and after my father -- 1t was -- must have been around that time that we stopped being\n-- being part of that circle hiding Jews because the Gestapo -- and they always come\nunannounced, were searching the house all the time, and nobody was served by that. So, through\na man I met on a train -- and my instinct always told me he\u2019s okay, or she\u2019s okay, or not, I found\nentry into a very interesting group of resisters in Dahlem who specialized in forging papers,\nforging money, and the whole thing. And ha -- hiding people, or sending then into hiding,\nGerman army deserters, Jews, whoever came to their door, they were taken care of. And that all\ntook place in the gardener\u2019s house, adjacent to Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s beautiful villa, which reminded\none of Hitler\u2019s Berkoff. It was probably built with B-Berkoff in mind. I never saw the lady, she\nwas out filming on th -- all through the war. But she had just been married to a German officer\nby the name of Jarkop, he was a major. And he popped up once in awhile, so we had to be very,\nvery careful. And I remember going there once, there was the so-called caretaker, with his so-\ncalled wife. They weren\u2019t married, you know, but they gained, somehow, Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s\ntrust, and were taking care -- you know, with all the bombing, care of the house and garden, and\nvery fast through this -- this man, Hans Andres was his name, and he was a funny existence. He\nwas very much anti-Nazi, and -- but he was dealing on the black market, I think, and black\nmarket meant money, money, money. And money was always needed. And in the cellar of that\nhouse there were machine -- first of all there was an arsenal of weapons. And then there was a\nmoney forging machine, and a money printing machine and -- and paper forging machine, and\nall that, and they -- they took me into that, you know, into their trust, they knew they could, and\nthe s -- as soon as somebody had come, and there were -- usually they were received in the\nkitchen, and got something to eat and to drink. And with the slightest noise that was not\nexpected, there was an opening in the floor through which you could go down in the cellar. They\nwere quickly pushed down, and the carpet o-over them. And one day I was there, the caretaker,\nPowell and I were there. Powell was wearing an apron, green gardener\u2019s apron when there was a\nknock at the door. God, what is it now? There were two deserters in the kitchen. Down with the\ndeserters. It was Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s dear husband. And Powell said to me, \u201cKeep him out of the\nkitchen.\u201d And he pushed me -- bu -- bu -- bu -- made me drag him into the bedroom, you know. I\nwas red -- not ready, but prepared for anything. And -- and he would -- and Powell said, \u201cYou\nknow, we\u2019ve just wiped the floor of the kitchen, just will -- if you give us a minute.\u201d So I went\ninto the little bedroom with him. An extremely stupid looking man by the way, and -- and then\nhe just wanted to see if everything was in order. Oh yes, of course, Herr Major, of course Herr\nMajor. At that time I didn\u2019t know yet who he was. There hadn\u2019t been time, you know, was just\nsomebody. And then he came into the kitchen, looked around, everything seemed fine,\neverything had been pushed into drawers, and -- and bottles into the closets and all that. And\nthen he said -- and the car was -- staff car was waiting for him, and he said now he -- he had to\ngo back to the front. The front was probably 10 miles away, or 20 miles away. And then Powell\ntold me, \u201cYou know who that was? That was Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s husband.\u201d And that was the\nclosest call I\u2019ve --",
        "Q: That you had?",
        "A: -- that I remember. And Hans was the one who furnished all of us with a weapon. That\nweapon, a little Ortgiess [indecipherable] that saved my life and shot an SS man.",
        "Q: So that you got from him?",
        "A: I got that from Hans. Because -- I write in my book it\u2019s -- was my father\u2019s --",
        "Q: Yes, but it wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: -- it really the -- no, my father had a similar one. But it was Hans\u2019 --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- who suggested that I always carry it.",

And a\nabsolutely horrible woman, you know, a sergeant as a -- she was a Nazi, and she -- she really was\n-- was ready to let me have it as a daughter of a Junker, and -- and -- and a pra -- a jailbird and all\nthat. And so it was agreed that by the first of October, I would start there. And I said to myself,\nno, I\u2019m not going to do that. And one day I opened a newspaper, and in the -- were few\nnewspapers at [indecipherable] time because of the paper shortage. And I opened the newspaper\nand there is an add that urgently girls -- females, were sought to replace men to go to the front, to\ntrain horses.

And then I went\ninto the -- in the cavalry, and --",
        "Q: And you were trained as a young -- this 1s one of the things your father --",

        "A: Yes, and I had a talent for riding, for dressage especially. I was always afraid jumping, to\njump, always. Never lost that fear.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- before I was thrown so many times. Well, anyway, w-we -- and you know, training\na horse from scratch is a very, very taxing thing.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: A horse doesn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not one bit. But we had to do it, I had six or seven horses every day, si -- ride six or seven\nhours a day. But you know, we were 1n a -- in a -- in a hut, in a barrack, with three bedrooms, all\nof us girls, and most of them were from nobility, because after all, who could ride, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: And it was very exhausting, but it -- I had a wonderful commander, th-the -- the colonel,\nColonel Behnke. I call him different in my -- in my book. And he -- I told him -- I -- I -- I\nrelieved myself of my -- you know, I told him of my father, and he was so good, and he said ma -\n- at that time my father was in a prison in Berlin, and we didn\u2019t know where. I had to search for\nhim. I found him there, but only because that nice colonel let me go to Berlin on some kind of a\nmission, you know.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And in the stables, helping us, were Russians, Russian prisoners of war. Every morning a\ntroop of bedraggled le -- figures came from that -- the -- the -- the camp, you know, the POW\ncamp to help us in the stables. And they were having a wonderful time with us. We gave them\nbread, the stables were warm. I once visited that camp to identify a certain man, and it was --\nthere were vi -- on -- they were sleeping on the -- they didn\u2019t even have straw, was stone floors.\nAnd what -- what one of them told me they drag -- they dreaded nothing more than the Sundays\nwhen they didn\u2019t have to work, what were they supposed to do?

        "A: No, no, I was -- we are talking now \u00b044, and I was allowed to go to Berlin from time to time,\neven though there was -- no other one of the girls was allowed out. I was still searching for my\nfather. I found he -- I found his, the prison, the attastrasse number three, and --",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m asking now before, before he\u2019s imprisoned.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh.",
        "Q: A little before the assassination plot.",
        "A: Yes?",

        "A: Before?",
        "Q: Do -- do you hear -- d -- are people talking about they\u2019re murdering Jews, are they saying --",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: You -- you know this?",
        "A: Of course, they were -- there were rumors but we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t put too much importance\non those rumors. But we heard the name Auschwitz on the BBC.",
        "Q: Right, but -- but did you believe what they were saying?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And at that time in our house was a Jewish woman posing as a seamstress. She was Frau\nThiele, but her real name was Rittenburg. And her son and -- and -- and husband had already\nbeen deported to Auschwitz. They were -- they didn\u2019t survive. She -- she by the way is the only\none we know by name that sur -- that survived in Ditte\u2019s house.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And went to England right away. And my father, after his demise from -- from the German --\nfrom the army, with the help of Canaris, he escaped the concentration camp then. He was at\nhome, and shortly before the 20\" of July he went to -- to the estate of -- of friends of ours to be\naway for the time, and return right after to resume his planned post as a liaison man to England.",
        "Q: But now you -- does he know about the July 20\" plot?",
        "A: Well, he -- the -- the -- the -- the --",
        "Q: His part --",
        "A: -- meetings had taken place in our house.",
        "Q: Taken place in your house, right.",
        "A: And now the last question that had to be solved was who is going to do it? Must be somebody\nwilling --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- able, and still allowed in Hitler\u2019s presence.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because at that time he was a full grown paranoiac, and Stauffenberg was still -- still\npermitted in his presence. And there was a briefing that was to take place at hit -- at the wolf\u2019s\nlair, his headquarters, on the 20\" of July, and my cu -- my cousin Werner, and he -- Stauffenberg\nand his adjutant Werner von Haften, they flew by military plane of course, up to ca -- to -- to east\nPrussia. And in with them they had the attach\u00e9 case with the two British made bombs. And full\nof hope that maybe this time. And they entered the building, but my cousin Werner was not\nallowed to enter the ro -- the conference room. First of all, the conference was a -- a ba --\nsupposed to take place in an underground bunker, where the bomb -- the explosion would have\ntorn everyone to bits. At the last moment, it was -- 1t was transferred to a -- to a -- a hut, a light\nhut, where most of the pressure went out the windows.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Hitler again, because a wa -- the -- of the intense heat that day -- and as you know, I wa -- \u2019'm\nnot going to ta -- to -- to -- to talk at detail about how it then went, but Stauffenberg put the bo --\nhe had excused himself for changing his shirt or something like that before he reported to the\nflihrer, and had done what had to be done to the bombs in order to set them for time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And nothing could go wrong, really, nothing. So he -- he had been planned on the -- on this\nunderground bunker now, and that. He put it underneath a heavy oak table. And then 24 -- 24\npeople attended, and wa -- wa -- the -- the bombs were set for a certain time, so my cousin was --\nwas advised to -- to disturb, in order to get him out, he was allegedly to be called on the phone.\nAnd Stauffenberg went out and the two made it back, with a chauffeured car back to the airport\nand on the plane to Berlin. But already on their way, they heard the explosion and they knew that\neverybody must have got -- been killed. Three people were killed, 11 were heavily wounded, but\nHitler was not among them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He stood there, his trousers in -- in shreds, and one arm was paralyzed and all that, but he was\nexpecting Mussolini that same afternoon, visiting him, and he made it. He was bereft of his\nspeech for awhile, but he again -- and he made it by the time that -- that we were home, I was -- I\nwas outside of Berlin at the estate of a friend of mine, made it back to Berlin. And at my --\nshortly after midnight we turned on the radio and there was Hitler speaking.",
        "Q: Right. Did you -- did you know about the plot before --",
        "A: Oh yes --",
        "Q: Before?",
        "A: That was the trouble. Too many people knew, too many people knew.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I remember the day before I went to the countryside, be-before -- it must have been on\nthe 15\" of July, I took a walk with my father in the neighborhood and from a lantern right close\nto our house, hung a German soldier. I was not worth dying for the fuhrer, you know. And my ha\n-- my father had been let out of the -- Hitler\u2019s prison. He was -- wait a mo -- no, no, no, no, no,\nno, no, wrong, wrong, wrong.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yes, of course. And -- and we -- an-and by this -- by the church my father stood, took me by\nthe shoulders and he said, \u201cSomething is going to happen.\u201d And it\u2019ll happen tomorrow, whatever\nit was. \u201cWe have to do it, and it will -- it will not work. It will not -- I have a feeling,\u201d he said, \u201cit\nwill not work.\u201d As Alan -- keep for -- no, forget. Anyway, he said, \u201cIt will not work, but we have\nto show that some people cared.\u201d And I knew then that he did not count himself above this err --\namong the survivors. And he said, \u201cWhen all is over, I want you to seek your luck under another\nstar. You -- and for you and your children.\u201d And I\u2019ve never forgotten that, he want --",
        "Q: Was that the first time he said that to you?",

        "Q: The only time?",
        "A: Yeah. And we went home arv -- you know, and then they -- there came f -- my father left for\nthe Mackensan\u2019s, and I -- I was visiting my cousin Ilse, I came back and -- after it happened, and\nthe next day at six o\u2019clock in the morning the Gestapo came and searched the house. And my fa -",

        "A: My mother is there.",
        "Q: And you were there.",
        "A: My mother is there, but I tell you something now that shows -- demonstrates the naivet\u00e9 of th\n-- all the plotters. They were not trained mur-murderers, they were gentlemen, you know? And\non my father\u2019s desk -- oh, you\u2019re father\u2019s absent. Yes, he is with so and so, you know. On my\nfather\u2019s d-desk is a little piece of paper and on it is a telephone number. And the Gestapo man\ntakes it, and says, \u201c\u201cWhose number 1s that?\u201d My mother said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You know? And --\nand she snatches it away from him. And then he -- she tries the number, or allegedly that\nnumber, it was a different number, and she said, \u201cI can\u2019t get through.\u201d And she says, \u201cYou know,\ngive it to me, I'll try from the upstairs phone.\u201d And upstairs she manages -- it was pencil written,\nto erase two of the numbers and falsify them. The number was that of Goerdeler, who was going\nto be the head of the new government. And they never found out.",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: That was my mother. Typical. Well, anyway, that was --",
        "Q: So you\u2019re saying that in some way she was, if not smarter, more strategic?",

        "Q: She saw, yes.",
        "A: -- she was smart too, and cunning.",

        "Q: And also pretty brave.",
        "A: -- they never even took my mother in for -- for an interrogation, they took me.",
        "Q: But they took you.",
        "A: Oh yes, because I was -- not so much because I was my father\u2019s daughter, but because I was\nmu -- Werner\u2019s cousin.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But you know, I made them believe that I -- Werner and I were lovers, which was not too far\nfrom the truth, but -- we had fallen in love as a matter of fact. And -- and sh -- you know, I -- I\ndon\u2019t know -- know about that, we made love, we da-da da-da. And they -- and, you know, my\nfather had trained me, he had said, when you get into the hands of the Gestapo, only answer with\nyes or no. And when they get friendly, then beware.",
        "Q: Then beware.",
        "A: Then beware, yeah. And they got very friendly. And I played stupid, and -- and during the\nsecond interrogation, the Gestapo man by the name of Wipper, [indecipherable] Wipper -- we\nnever found him after the war. He called another man in because he wouldn\u2019t hit anybody and\nthat one let me have it.",
        "Q: He hit you?",
        "A: He hit me in the face with his -- with -- he had a -- a bo -- twice the size. And I was bleeding\nlike a -- like a -- how does one bleed?",
        "Q: And was -- di -- did he hit you just because he felt like hitting you, or he was --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- asking you a question and you didn\u2019t answer?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. He didn\u2019t even ask any question anyway, he just let me have it to prepare me for\nthe next session, you know. And then -- but then they let me go. And on the way downstairs,\ncowering on a -- in a -- ina chair, I saw a beautiful girl, classmate from Eberswalde, who was le\n-- the legitimate bride of my f -- my -- my cousin Werner von Haften. He was a big one with\nwomen, you know? And she to this day, acts like his widow. I\u2019ve never told her that he and I\nwere a bit attracted to one another. And she is the only one of the family, that family, who never\nmarried. Well, anyway, I went home, and --",
        "Q: So they -- did they believe you, that you were having a relationship with Werner?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: They did.",
        "A: I -- Lonly said I only know him personally. I\u2019ve not the faintest idea.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: And was he arrested?",
        "A: Yes, he was arrested, he got a few years, I believe, and then he died, unfortunately. Was a\nunbelievable story.",
        "Q: Before we talk about your father\u2019s arrest, how -- how do you understand what they were\nassassinating in assassinating Hitler? What were they trying to stop? In -- as far as you\nunderstood, what were they really doing?",
        "A: As far as I understood, they were going to kill him, and when he was gone, getting rid of all\nthe others would be child\u2019s play. Maybe it would have been, you know? But that was the main\ngoal, to get him out of the picture.",
        "Q: And they were --",
        "A: The head of the snake.",
        "Q: And the snake --",

        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- part of the system.",
        "A: Well, it -- it -- they all had different motives. Some of them were true anti-Nazis from the\nbeginning on, joining the army when they were forced to, you know, because what else could\nyou do but die, and if you died your whole family was gone, probably. And others went along,\nbecause they thought maybe it\u2019s the right thing to do. And yet others, they really, they waited\nuntil it was clear the war was lost. So they are -- they -- they joined -- and among those who died\na miserable death on the -- on the -- th-th-the piano wire, was a German general, who -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\ndocumented what he said, quite late, maybe \u00b042 - 43, he said, \u201cWell, you can think about Hitler\nwhat you want. The only good thing is that he rid us of the Jews.\u201d There were those people, too.\nSo there were not -- and the major -- the minor -- the -- the -- the real from the heart resistors\nwere in the minority.",

        "Q: And they knew that he was part of this?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. It was all documented, you know, by -- they didn\u2019t think much of secrets. Like\nthe -- that is German, b -- Germanic, because the -- the -- if -- if they had not been so -- so\nthorough we would never know about how many people di -- were killed in Auschwitz, and so --\nit had to be -- all had to ha -- have order.",
        "Q: So when he was taken, did you expect your father to be killed?",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yeah, Werner was shot.",
        "Q: He was young?",
        "A: Well, not e -- just 30.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. But like all the Brauchitsch, he had -- his mother was a Brauchitsch, you know, they --\nhe looked very, very young. Young and soft, but he wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: He wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: He was determined, also determined to sacrifice his life without thinking.",
        "Q: Were you in the house when they -- they took your father?",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Were they brutal with him? Do you remember?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They weren\u2019t?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. The Gestapo -- with the Jews they might have been brutal, not with people\nlike, you know, in this case.",
        "Q: Even -- even s --",
        "A: No, they were very -- they were very matter of fact, polite. He could take a toothbrush, or a tis\n-- a little -- pack a little something. And then he went between them.",
        "Q: Even though he\u2019s connected with a plot to kill Hitler?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t -- isn\u2019t that --",
        "A: Yeah well, he did -- you know, you di -- didn\u2019t know how many people were watching in the\nStreet.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But ah -- no.",
        "Q: So he takes the little bag and he goes, and he goes in a car?",
        "A: He goes down the block, across the -- a-a-around the corner, they wouldn\u2019t -- they wouldn\u2019t\npark in front of the house. And there he s -- he is seated between two SS men in the back, that\u2019s\nwas -- and one in the front, and the driver. And the driver turns around and says, \u201cOh my God,\nHerr Baron.\u201d It was the taxi driver who always took him to the station when he went to Holland.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a taxi driver, it\u2019s not --",
        "A: No, he had been inducted, you know, there were no taxis.",
        "Q: I see, so he\u2019s inducted --",
        "A: No, he had been inducted.",
        "Q: -- to work.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And ha -- and this is what your father told you after he came back, that that\u2019s what happened\nin the car?",
        "A: Well, he -- during the brief hours that I s -- I saw him, yeah. Yes, of course.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know he -- when -- his release was -- well anyway, he was gone, he was -- he had\ndisappeared, and I went then already in the -- in the -- in the cavalry and before, went from\nprison to prison, dolled up to the teeth, you know, high heels and -- I was quite -- quite pretty\nthen. And I went in and I just -- what was my excuse? Oh yes, I was told my father was here. So\nth -- the idiotic guards let me in and I was wa -- these hallways of the Lehrter strasse prison, that\nwas the military prison.",
        "Q: And did you go from prison to prison like this? [indecipherable] find him?",
        "A: I went f -- yeah. No, never heard of him, must be an error. I said, \u201cOh well, [indecipherable |\nis all mine, and all that.\u201d And the last prison Lehrter strasse drei, I w -- I standing in the hall, a\ndoor opens of -- an office door opens and out comes a dashing SS man, black uniform. And I just\nstood there, and I see a blackboard with the most illustrous names, and I see my father\u2019s name.\nThat was a list of the -- big, you know, in big le -- white letters. And then I re -- when he came\nback he said what could he do for me, and I said, \u201cI -- I know my father\u2019s here,\u201d and I da da da\nda, and, \u201cCan I see him?\u201d \u201cNo, you have to -- you have to -- you -- well, si -- fill certain forms\nand you -- and -- and maybe,\u201d -- and I got home and at least we knew where he was. So my\nmother somehow arranged -- and I do not know how it was possible. The first time we went to\nbring him things. A down -- a featherbed, I remember that.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Cause it was -- yeah, a feather blanket, very light. And the most important things were the\nthermos bottles filled with real coffee. In the SS they made a sport out of it, accepting it from\nyou and then dropping it. Which was so terrible, you know, but it -- nothing happened. My\nmother and I, we went -- we were led in -- we were told we were not allowed to use the Hitler\nsalute. Terrible punishment. People like us, you know.",
        "Q: You were --",
        "A: Yeah that -- we were --",
        "Q: -- you were not good enough.",
        "A: -- we were crushed.",
        "Q: Yeah, I bet.",
        "A: And th -- we went in and on the benches there sat also wives, mothers, you know, and -- but\nwe -- if we recognized anybody we didn\u2019t let g -- let n -- let anybody know. So we sat and\nwaited, and from time to time, the-there was a little booth with a black SS man behind it, who\nwould call out names. And a woman would get up with her little package, spend some time there,\ngive the package, and then leave. It was our turn and my mother and I went to the window and\nthere was a man looking like Satan himself. Really, a bit like Adolf Eichmann. Black, piercing\neyes and he took the thermos bottle, examined everything and said, quite politely, well that was -\n- that was it, and then on our -- we -- we turned around and then he called me back. Oh God,\nwhat have I done now? And he said -- he didn\u2019t even lift his eyes to mine, he went on writing,\nand he said, there now in that position, \u201cDo you have -- could you -- do you think you -- next\ntime you come you have some more bread, or anything to eat?\u201d And I -- I went speechless, and\nhe said, \u201cYou know, I have many prisoners here who don\u2019t have relatives.\u201d That was\nOberscharfthrer Knuth.",
        "Q: Knuth?",
        "A: K-n-u-t-h. And oh -- h-he was -- he was the t-turncoat too, you know? He realized at some\npoint in his career that he\u2019d joined the wrong party. He did a wonderful thing, and by the way the\nNazi, th -- his own colleagues took care of him, he didn\u2019t survive the war.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Was found out. But our friend, to be the minis -- social mi-minister of s -- Teodor Haubach,\nhe was a Socialist. Dr. Haubach, a lawyer. He was -- he was also in Lehrter strasse. He had been\ncondemned to death and he was -- they had to carry him on a stretcher to his execution, can you\nimagine? And his -- his fianc\u00e9 had received -- had received -- which we did not, permission to\nsee him at Christmas, visit him in the -- in -- in the -- in the prison. And she went -- the way that\nI just described to you, to that window, and Knuth, you know, with a face like that, he said,\n\u201cWait a little, wait a little, until I\u2019m rid of all the people here.\u201d And then he turned to her and he\nsaid -- urged her ga -- s-summoned her into his office, and there was a little office behind, and\nthere was a Christmas tree, a burning -- with burning candles, and there was Teodor Haubach.\nHe had arranged a farewell meeting for the two. Can you imagine that? Must have been very\nemotional. And then he was hanged. But much emotion involved in that.",
        "Q: So how many times were you able to see your father in this prison?",
        "A: Id -- I never saw my father. My mo -- ba -- a -- to -- to gi -- to deliver things.",
        "Q: You could, but you couldn\u2019t see him?",
        "A: I could -- no. My -- my mother only, saw him.",
        "Q: And what did she say about him? Did she tal -- tell you?",
        "A: Oh he -- yeah, yeah, she -- he looked terrible, and of course, while you were waiting there, for\neducational reasons they dragged by prisoners at has -- had just been tortured, or led to torture.\nYeah, that was the way. And then one day it must have -- it was on Good Friday, 19 -- oh no, it\nwas -- it\u2019s still March, and I was released from the -- from the cavalry because I had double\npneumonia -- no, wa -- pleurisy -- pleurisy. And spent time at home with -- I\u2019m glad. You know,\nit was a good idea to be with my mother, and my mother had tried to free -- get my father freed\nby Kaltenbrunner. Kaltenbrunner was a darling. And he had not received her. And then one day\nshe tried it again, sh -- that woman went into -- in Berlin, to Kaltenbrunner\u2019s office, and -- and\ndecided not to leave until she had seen him. And she came back, she was, you know, finished.\nShe said that he -- when she walked into Kaltenbrunner, who decided to see her, office -- he was\none of the worst -- he didn\u2019t even get up to greet her, and let her stand. And she said, \u201cMy\nhusband 1s a -- you know, the last survivor of four brothers.\u201d And so on. \u201cHad nothing to do\nwith,\u201d da da da. And then he re -- she -- sh -- he said nothing, and then he -- she went -- she went\nhome. And then on Good Friday, beginning of April it must have been, I was home when a\ntelephone came -- telephone call came to the house, we still at the beginning of April, had a\nworking telephone. Still it went into the middle of the -- of the month. And on the phone was my\nfather, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m free. Come and get me.\u201d And we decided -- I said, \u201cShould I pick you\nup from the prison?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no, no, no, on the S-bahn station,\u201d you know, the suburban\nstation, on the S-bahn station, and I -- I don\u2019t know, I must have flown on angel\u2019s wings, because\nth -- ow -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the subway, the buses, if they came, they came very, very\nseldom, but I -- somehow I made it and running up the steps to the -- the -- to the up -- upper\nplatform. And I was mobbed with people, I couldn\u2019t find my father, because that figure that\nstretched out his arms to me had nothing in common with my father. He was -- had a gray face,\nhe was completely bloated -- he had a very slender face -- completely bloated from the -- you\nknow, from hunger, edema. He looked terrible and we sank into each other\u2019s arms and just cried\nand cried. And behind my father, there was a touching sight, was a young SS man, 16, inducted\ninto the SS of course, and had tears streaming down his face because of that sight. And then my\nfather noticed that he had left his blanket behind. That was a -- you know, precious in those days.\nSo the young man ran back t -- and then came back with it.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: With the blanket, and then we somehow made it home, and sl -- you know, slept in the cellar\nand then -- it was -- it was the -- until -- it was the 23 of April then, on the -- in the afternoon.",
        "Q: S-So your father is in prison from July --",
        "A: July til April.",
        "Q: -- July \u00b044, until April *45.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And that\u2019s -- you know, if he had not been in such a terrible condition, he would\nhave had a better chance to survive what was coming to him.",
        "Q: And so how long then are you working with the horses?",
        "A: With the horse --",
        "Q: It\u2019s af -- is it after he\u2019s arrested --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- that you start?",
        "A: September, you know?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: After the first of September, when they closed the theaters, and I was w --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- nobody was allowed to do nothing. And I was then -- in January I came down with\npneumon -- pleurisy, and in March they released me, and that\u2019s when I went home. And I got a\nlittle better, but never completely better, you know, and then we\u2019re talking about the end of\nApril, my father is home. And -- and just he was home not more than five days maybe, three,\nfive days, I don\u2019t remember. And on the 23\", you know, I said I would like to go f -- yeah, that\nwas the reason. Potsdam had been bombed, something nobody ever expected. And in Potsdam\nwas my old grandmother, my father\u2019s mother. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go on a bicycle and see if\nGrandma is still alive.\u201d And I took the bicycle, steel helmet on, of course my -- parts of my\nuniform, thank God, you know. And my ortkeys. And somehow made it to Potsdam on a bicy --\na bicycle. The other reason why I went was I wanted to see how my -- my horse, you know, she\nwas already mine, how she w -- wa -- w-what happened to them, because the unit that had been\nstationed in Baseco, east of Berlin, had been stationed -- had been moved to Potsdam.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So the Russians had been in Baseco a long time ago. And I found my grandmother alive, and\nI found her -- her dis -- dip -- her com -- her apartment undisturbed. Her maid, Marta was there.\nAnd I could tell my grandmother that her son, her last remaining son was alive. And then I left\nand made my way north of Potsdam. There were so many corpses right, left, and center, and\ncadavers from horses. And I made it to the barracks where the cavalry unit was now stationed.\nAnd I fell into the commanders arms and he says, \u201cYou can\u2019t go back to Berlin, they just blew\nup all the bridges, and we are moving out. We are moving west.\u201d So I --",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: -- I -- on the [indecipherable] at the head of the whole troop -- behind us were the Russians,\neach leading two horses, and they walked on that trip. And we had to go -- the temple that the --\nthat the Russians were able to go, you know? Because we didn\u2019t lose one to lose one man or one\n-- or one -- or one horse. And my two favorite Russians, Fjodur and -- and Pawlik, they were\nwalking right behind me, and I was on the horse, and the commander, and the major and we\nwalked -- we walked west. Was -- it was a night already. And the second night I fell asleep on a\nhorse. And I woke up, had I not worn the steel helmet on my -- I would have cracked open like a\ncoconut. On -- and I remember seeing --",
        "Q: Fell off?",
        "A: -- Pawlik\u2019s eyes, you know, he picked me up and he said, \u201cKaput, kaput, nichts kaput, nichts\nkaput.\u201d And then he lifted me up on the horse again.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re riding Arabella all this time?",
        "A: Nobody else could.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] nobody else, right.",
        "A: Yeah. Nobody else could, and then we finally were met by the American 82\" Airborne after\nwhat -- 12 nights.",
        "Q: Did -- did you consider this a liberation?",
        "A: Do I consider it as a -- ha! It was wonderful. I\u2019d known all about the 82\" Airborne.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: [indecipherable] oh yes, BBC, you know? And it was wonderful, it was wonderful.\nLiberation, yes. And --",
        "Q: You were in Berlin when there is bombing? This -- y- you were in Berlin --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- when there was a lot of bombing, right?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I missed a single wa -- a sing -- single raid, and --",
        "Q: Right. That was pretty scary, right?",
        "A: -- I was -- well, the only one in my family who was never scared was my mother because she\nhad the second sight, whatever you call that, nothing\u2019s going to happen. Nothing is going to\nhappen to the house. While my father and I, and later on Liyala, we were scared to death by the\nbombs. And you know, it was like resurrection, surviving a -- a raid. And fo -- wa -- you know, I\nwas br-brought up to praise the bombers, you know, who put our -- and to -- I saw that city die\ninch by inch.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was terribly sad, but it had to be. But you know, I was liberated by the Americans, and the\nRussians came and there was -- one of the famous meetings on the Elbe, cause that -- that\u2019s\nwhere we were, between the Russians and the -- there was only one meeting. After that there\nwere no more friendly meetings. That was it. I mean some of the G.I.\u2019s almost died of the\nconsume of alcohol, you know. They weren\u2019t used to that, but that was fraternization, and I was\nbe -- left behind and th -- with the Russians, and was -- and was liberated, saved by young -- a\nyoung American officer. I know his name but I told him since he had a -- his rencontre with a --\nwith the army later, and received a -- not for that, for other things he did, received a dishonorable\ndischarge, which to this day follows him. Could not remain in the army, but he became a famous\nlawyer, and after 40 years I found that he has a practice in Florida. So we were reunited again.\nYeah, and then I -- the British came and then --",
        "Q: How chaotic was it? How difficult were those first few months?",
        "A: Wonderful.",
        "Q: It was wonderful?",
        "A: It was wonderful. I was in that village, I was hired by the Americans right away to be an\ninterpreter.",
        "Q: Interpreter, yes.",
        "A: Which meant that I was -- could be disturbed any day of -- any time, night and day. And you\nknow, they\u2019ve -- the famous, the most famous thing tha -- things they found things, I\u2019m saying,\npeople that are found, were hiding SS men. And some of them were already half beaten to death\nby the population or by -- by their victims. So it was -- there was never a dull moment.",
        "Q: But when you think about the whole sit -- maybe your situation was a little bit less chaotic,\nbecause you need to ha -- but --",
        "A: It was very chaotic, but very v -- very nice.",
        "Q: It was very nice.",
        "A: Very nice.",
        "Q: Do you think it was nice for all the refugees that were going --",
        "A: It was terrible.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It was unbelievable --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- because we saw them passed when we -- when we moved along these two -- 12 nights,\nwhat we passed, these -- these thousands and thousands of refugees, falling, and then attacked by\nthe low flying planes --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and falling into the -- by the side of the road. How many identification I took, you know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- can\u2019t even tell you. Yeah, and on the way, before we were liberated, the last day before --\nbefore we met with the Americans, we -- we collected our tri -- train, and ready to move on, and\nthe officers, the -- the veteran, he was in the rank of a major, and I don\u2019t remember his name, and\nthe colonel and I, we were waiting for all the others to come close so we could move on. When\nthe SS man came with a -- an SS man came with a -- on a motorcycle, and he said -- asked for\nidentification and he told us we had no business going west, we should go east and defend\nBerlin. Fine, great. So without a word, it was only a glance we exchanged, the vet -- the\nveterinarian -- the veterinarian, a thin blonde man, and I wi -- drew at the same time the pistols,\nand we shot at the same time. And he just sl -- slowly was sloping over his bike, and we still\nheard the engine going when -- while we moved away. Yeah, we killed him. I don\u2019t know which\nbullet killed him, but I don\u2019t [indecipherable] my shot.",
        "Q: And you had no --",
        "A: We had --",

        "Q: Uh-huh. But that\u2019s the first human being you shot. That seems a little --",
        "A: And hopefully the only one.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. I have one other person that I probab -- I caused the death of another person, probably\nof a Russian prisoner. My friend Pawlik, and -- you know, that we took along. He was such a\nbeautiful little human being, he was -- looked like 16, you know, with -- with al -- infected eyes,\nand sometimes he was crying, and I said, \u201cPawlik, what is 1t?\u201d And he said we have such a one --\nin his halting German, he could speak a little German -- bad, bad man in our outfit, he is a\ncommissar, a commissar. And he is giving them hell for being on friendly terms with the\nGermans. And that\u2019s when I went to inspect that -- that camp, and was pointed out the\ncommissar, and the next day he was gone. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. But Powell, and\nFjodur, and all the others were very relieved.

        "Q: So you di -- so --",
        "A: The neighbor across the street.",
        "Q: So why do you think the Russians pi -- did -- do you think they picked up the -- these men,\nincluding your father cause they thought they were Nazis or what? You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Probably, but there are various theories about that. In the -- on the truck was an old friend of\nmy father who said, \u201cI told the Russians to drive by your house. I\u2019ve lost all my documents and\nnow they came to -- to arrest me, and only you can tell them who I am.\u201d And my father said, \u201cOf\ncourse, I'll come with you.\u201d And my mother at the last moment said, \u201cHere is -- it might be a\ncold evening, take a jacket.\u201d And that was the last we ever saw of him.",
        "Q: And that was the last time --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So nobody\u2019s -- nobody is sure what this rounding up was about.",
        "A: Nobody to this -- to --",
        "Q: This sor --",
        "A: -- well later, when they interrogated my father, of course they found out that he was a baron.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Probably a spy.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Most likely a spy.",
        "Q: So that they were worried, huh?",
        "A: Ho -- wer -- but it\u2019s all --",
        "Q: Speculative, yeah.",
        "A: -- theoretical, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And on the 12\" of November, he -- his -- his bed bunk neighbor, a famous German actor who\nsurvived, by the way, found him dead on the floor. So.",
        "Q: So this is why November 1s a terrible month for you always?",
        "A: Yes. We were all taught to fear November.",
        "Q: As a bad month.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: All right, we\u2019ll change the tape.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: When did you find out that your father had passed?",
        "A: My father had disappeared, dissolved in thin air, so to say, and there were -- was a rumor here\nand a rumor there, and there were little pieces of paper found in the mailbox telling us that he is\nalive, but not where and -- and all that. We are talking between the end of April and -- and --\nwell, until he died on the 12\" of November. What month it was I do not remember. Oh yes, it\nmust have been after April 1946. I had gone over the green border, so to say, on the first of\nJanuary 1945, to see where my mother was, you know, how things were in Berlin. But there\nwere no official documents that -- that would allow you to pass from one zone to the other. So I\nleft my horse in Hasseldorf with my family there, friends, and boarded a train and somehow,\nfastened by -- by something to the -- what do you call these things between trains, you know, I\nmean there were --",
        "Q: I don\u2019t remember what you call it.",
        "A: -- were no room on the train.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t remember what you call it.",
        "A: Ice cold, they had -- had to hack me loose in -- in -- in Berlin, I arrived there. And somehow I\nremember h -- the happiness when I saw American soldiers on the subway, it was great. But I\nknew that our house was still there. So I -- I kind of ran home, and there w-was my mother, very\nthin, very much alone. I mean, she had a house full of refugees, of course, and in good spirits as I\n-- you know, of -- always collected, calm and collected. And then -- yeah. Then I\u2019d stay -- I\nstayed until -- until the first us -- beginning of April, 40 -- \u201946, April \u201946. I decided to go back to\nHasseldorf, see how my horse 1s, and ra -- I worked for the Norddeutscher radio station as an\nannouncer and I wanted to go back to my job, and how was it -- yeah, there was no way to get\nback, either. And so I smuggled myself into a refugee camp, even got food rations there, I\nremember. And somehow th -- there was a train, like cattle cars, like the ones, you know, that\nwere used to ship the Jews away. Cattle cars, maybe twen -- 10 - 20 cattle cars. And right smack\nin the middle was one car reserved for the British -- a re-regular car -- a car reserved for the\nBritish who would accompany the train and tried to -- would try to protect us against the Russian\nsoldiers. And at the -- at the checkpoint, I conversed with one. He said, \u201cYou speak English,\nyou'll be our interpreter.\u201d And so I was very glad. I was allowed to travel in the -- 1 -- I put my\nthings in the -- in a -- in a -- 1n the cattle ca -- in the cattle car, and in the next one that was the\nBritish car, oh, I got a beautiful meal and beer, and whatever. And whatever my services were --\nwere demanded, I did it. I did it, and you know, g-going a stretch that nowadays by car would\ntake from Berlin two and a half hours, then took 24. 20 f -- more, or more. I v -- know we left in\nthe afternoon at three and were there the next morning at seven. So, 12 - 13 - 14- 15 - 16. And\nthey s -- the sergeant, Atkinson was his name, Sergeant Atkinson told me that before the border\ndividing the Russian zone from the British zone, I should get out of the British car because the\nRussian soldiers would come and inspect the British car and they did not like German citizens\nmingling with the British, meaning a -- I would go into the -- into the car in front of us and\npretend to be one of the -- well, I was one of the people. And then he would give me a sign with\nhis -- with his flashlight that I would come back. And so, go there and the -- the Russian guards\ncome in and they read the -- they -- they read the documents upside down, you know, most of\nthem couldn\u2019t read it, other than Cyrillic, if they could at all. And everyth -- they went out and\nthe train begins to go into motion again. And I look, standing by the open door, that were not\nsealed, fortunately, I see a signal from the other car. Aha, this is my signal and so Ij -- clad with\nthick under, you know, pullovers, and a sheep coat, I jump down and I find no bottom and I fall\nand fall in spirals, and finally the water of the river closes over me, in freezing temperatures.\nThere were no -- you know, the -- the -- the -- the -- the tracks were all damaged, and what\nSergeant atkin -- Atkinson had -- had tried to do was warn me of that, but I had, you know, the\noriginal message had been -- and I was the -- it was the very, very shallow river, but I came up\nagain like a cork, and saw the -- the train was halted, it was standing, and I saw the -- all the\nBritish soldiers coming to rescue me. And they -- they -- they had to wade into the water and pull\nme out. And I had a gigantic -- it\u2019s still to see here, the bump on my forehead. I had bump --",
        "Q: Even in all your clothes you popped up?",
        "A: Well, the -- the -- the next second I would have been pulled down again, you know?",
        "Q: I see, right.",
        "A: I -- I popped up and they d -- they -- and then something happened which -- of which I was\nhav -- half -- you know, I was half conscious. And they pulled all the clothes from me, stark\nnaked and -- and -- and wrapped me into army blankets and put me on a stretcher there, or a\nbunk bed or whatever it was. And I was -- I was in a very elated mood, you know? And captain -\n- no, it wasn\u2019t a captain -- he sat next to me and after about four hours I went into shock. And\nthat was it, I started screaming and crying and having fits. And he knew how to handle this. He\ntook my hand and kept talking to me about his family in England, northern England. He was an\nelectrician, I believe, or a plumber, and his children and everything, and by the time we reached\nHannover about 10 hours later or eight hours later, I had developed an eye like this, you know?",
        "Q: Huge, huh?",
        "A: I looked terrible, and everything was dry except the fur coat, that took an extra two weeks.\nAnd on the platform stood the man I would -- was -- who was responsible for me in my job,\nCaptain -- Major Clark. Major Clark a Scotsman from Scotland. And he t-took one look at me\nand started laughing like hell, singing black eyed Susan. I was not amused. And he took me to\nthe British army hospital in Hannover, they x-rayed me and I had a concussion, of course, and\nother than that, I survived it. And I had very little to wear, I\u2019ve -- I stayed in the castle with a --\nwith the princely family of the Schoenaich-Carolath, where my horse was, and I re -- was allow -\n- course I had to rest for awhile, and Sergeant Atkinson gave me the promise of what -- he went\nback to Berlin, he would visit my mother and tell her that I\u2019m all right. And then he took another\nfour weeks or so, I remember it must have been May or June that he came back, carrying a big\nsuit, I was -- I -- he came with a Jeep, carrying a big suitcase that was for me, with clothes.\nClothes, you know, I didn\u2019t even know what clothes were, I only had those riding boots. And he\nsaid -- I took him to the park, it was a beautiful day, and he was so in awe by all the -- the -- the\nroyal highnesses and -- and wh-whatever. We went to the park and he said, \u201cI have very bad\nnews for you. Your father is dead.\u201d And then he spilled out the story that had just gotten to the\nears of my mother, over a year after -- after my father had been taken away, what had happened\nto him. So that\u2019s how we found out, and later my si -- my brother would find out that this -- this\nfamous actor, Berlin\u2019s you know, he was the manager of the Staatstheater, Gustaf Griindgens,\nhad been acco -- a friend of my -- had been there when my father was -- died. And I\u2019m s -- was\ndied. And I am so grateful the two had each other, because they -- they had a lot to -- to talk\nabout. And he told the story, but he -- very reluctantly because the Russians had released him\nunder the provision that he would never talk what happened to him in the -- in the ca -- in the\ncamp.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So he broke the promise. He died shortly after, but a natural death, so that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So that must have been a -- that [indecipherable |",
        "A: That\u2019s how we found out.",
        "Q: Then that must have been a really big shock for you, given how close you were to your father.\nOr did you expect it?",
        "A: Well we -- we gave up all, then we had to go -- gave -- give up all hope.",
        "Q: So you gave it up before?",
        "A: We had, really.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We really had. But now we had confirmation, and --",
        "Q: Sure, yes.",
        "A: -- closure.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, closure. And the -- this actor, Gustaf Griindgens, after my father died, saw to it\npersonally, together with other prisoners, that my father, who was very much respected -- my\nfather had turned politically much more to the left than anybody would have thought. You know,\nhe would have wound up a social democrat, you know, and not a rightist any more. Rightist, no\nhe was never a rightist, but the si -- the Nazis were rightists. And he was highly respected and to\nthis day I get do -- not to this day, for years I got messages from hi -- how wonderful he was, and\nhow well he behaved, and well anyway, he saw to it that my father was not thrown into a mass\ngrave, but has a single grave in Jamlitz, somewhere. I mean if I was to inspect a thousand skulls\nthere, I would have found my father\u2019s because of the shrapnel wound in the first World War.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But we never tried, we never, you know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- they dug up corpses there and they gave it up. What\u2019s the use?",
        "Q: What\u2019s the use?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well.",
        "Q: So now your brother\u2019s alive, this you found out, yes.",
        "A: My brother, I was at the Hasseldorf castle when one morning while I was asleep, the door\nopens, the princess stands there and said, \u201c\u201cSSomebody to see you.\u201d That was my little brother, you\nknow. And he worked on the farm then, you know, before he went back to Berlin, and in Berlin\nhe eventually was one of the founders of the Frei University.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, yes, because the Humboldt University, he was not the son of a laborer, refused him.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And everybody else who was not a laborer\u2019s son. And then he founded the univ -- the\nuniversity, became a lawyer.",
        "Q: And how is your mother right after the war? Are you -- do -- do you go back to her once\nyou\u2019ve -- once you\u2019re better, do you go back to Berlin?",
        "A: Oh yes, frequently, then I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve moved back to Berlin. I moved ba --",
        "Q: But when do you marry the first time? When you have [indecipherable]",
        "A: I -- oh, I married -- not for awhile.",
        "Q: Not for awhile, okay.",
        "A: Not for awhile. I -- I was, you know, still under the illusion that after the war, things will be\nall different. The Nazis will be dealt with and all the anti-Nazis would come up and rule the\ncountry, you know? It didn\u2019t quite happen that way, the Nazis had it good, and those de-Nazi\nvacation trials, I beg your pardon, you know. Were nothing but a farce. So I went to work in\nBerlin, in a famous organization, it was of course ba -- instituted by the Americans, by the CIA.\nThe Fighting League Against Inhumanity. And I was one of the first people there, and then they\nsomehow did things that the Americans di -- I didn\u2019t like either, and then I -- but I -- I\ninterviewed, interrogated more people than you can shake a stick at. You know, refugees.\nClearing them -- are they political, or are they not? None were sent back but the ones who could\nprove they were political prisoners, they left for political reasons, that their lives were\nendangered, they received extra help from the Americans. Taken by plane from West Germany\nand so on. That was the time when they came by the thousands before the -- the wall was built.",
        "Q: Now, did most of the people you speak with, you think they were -- they were just trying to\nleave the east and come west?",
        "A: You had to -- you had to use your judgment and I have a very good instinct. I could tell by the\nway a man entered a room.",
        "Q: Who he was.",
        "A: But once -- I describe it in my book. A man -- a gentleman, middle aged, enters the room, sits\ndown and tells me his real name. Doktor Reckzeh [indecipherable]. Doktor Reckzeh was\nresponsible, he was a Nazi spy, was responsible for the death of at least 30 people, a terrible\ndeath, because he had attended the famous Thadden tea party. A woman by the name of Fraiilein\nFron Thadden, who was the headmistress of a famous girl\u2019s school, had invited people who then\nwas living in Berlin, had invited people for a tea party and independent of each other, al -- my\nmother almost went, and the Countess [indecipherable] almost went. Both held back, you know,\nby something that could not be explained. And guest of the party and the only man was a very\nnice young man by the name -- he was a medical doctor, and he was allowed free access to and\nfrom Switzerland and people who wanted to give him messages should do it, he would gladly\ntake them. And he wasn\u2019t Gestapo spy and he denounced all of them. And Fratilein Fron\nThadden at a ripe old age, was beheaded. And -- and many -- all the -- all the -- all the people\nwere -- were hanged. And I -- right away I registered, I knew who that man was, even maybe my\nface gave me away, I don\u2019t know. And we talked, and then I -- excuse me, as I said, \u201cI have to go\nthe next room, just one moment.\u201d And I said to the pers -- \u201cCall the police, call the police right\naway.\u201d And by the time I came back, he was gone.",
        "Q: Was gone.",
        "A: And he went back into the Russian zone, where he wa -- they gave him a wonderful life,\nanyway, I don\u2019t know why he ever wanted to leave. He was a doctor and had a beautiful home\nwith a sky high wall around it, and I never knew what happened to him. He reported his own\ndaughter to the Russians for being anti-Communist. Yeah, nice guy. Yeah, I missed that boat.",
        "Q: So he could move from one group to another, it didn\u2019t matter, as long as he was --",
        "A: Oh yeah. And then, you know, the leader of the place was Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt. He was\nterribly naive, too. And of course we had all the Communist spy we could meet in our office, so\nwe sent our spies into the cowan -- the Communist side. And then I left and then I -- I decided\nwith the Nazi time, and I say it in these words, something wonderful had broken with the end of\nthe war. The ti -- feeling of togetherness with all the people who were against the regime.\nCatholic, Protestant, Jewish, Communist, monarchy, didn\u2019t matter. They -- for the moment of the\nend, each went in his own separate direction again. And that would never, ever be the same\nagain. That I really missed. Everybody missed it.",
        "Q: So there was a moment when it didn\u2019t matter who you were, as long as you were against the\nNazis?",
        "A: It didn\u2019t, no, it didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: And then -- and then --",
        "A: -- as long as somebody --",
        "Q: -- people split again.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They went into their old accustomed directions.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when I -- I -- you know, our family -- and I describe my friendship with -- I called\nher Aunt Edith and Uncle Otto, he -- Jewish, but Christians for centuries. And they had been\ndragged to Theresien -- Terezin, and they had been -- had survived Terezin and went to America,\nthen ba -- went back to Berlin, and she had her son from her first marriage, who was then chief\nof staff of the children\u2019s hospital in -- in Detroit, Michigan. He came to visit and he said, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you come to the United States?\u201d Ah, that was the moment when I woke up in the mor --\nmor -- morning and said to myself, \u201cI\u2019m going to the States.\u201d\u201d And my -- my little ba -- I had\nalready been divorced, and my little boy was not well. So he had been prescribed a time in a\nclimate where he would heal, you know, lungs and everything. It did the job, but what would I\ndo when -- you know, I gave myself those six months, that I would go to the States and establish\na -- an existence somehow.",
        "Q: And then bring him over.",
        "A: And I -- I did, and my mother brought the boy, and I -- in New York they had told me\nnewcomers need seven years to get accustomed to new y -- I needed one hour. All it took. This is\nmy city, you know.",
        "Q: And of course you had --",
        "A: I had English.",
        "Q: -- the English language.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Which made all the difference.",
        "A: So I got a -- got a wonderful position with NBC right away.",
        "Q: Right away.",
        "A: That\u2019s where I met -- later met my husband number two.",
        "Q: Right. Now husband number one, when did you get married?",
        "A: We got married in January of \u201952.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: We worked together for the American newspaper, the [indecipherable] in -- in -- in Munich.\nHe was a journalist. Son of a Jewish mother, by the way, who had muddled through.",
        "Q: The war. Let me ask you again about the League Against Inhumanity. You said there were\nthings that the Americans were doing that you didn\u2019t like.",
        "A: Not, not the Americans, that group was doing, yeah.",
        "Q: That group was doing, I see.",
        "A: You know, unnecessarily sending people into the Russian zone, just to -- to put an F on the\nwall somewhere, which mean frimins -- Freiheit, freedom.",
        "Q: Freedom, uh-huh.",
        "A: And stuff like that.",
        "Q: But I thought they were an anti-Communist group?",
        "A: It -- there was -- they were the anti-Communist group.",
        "Q: So why would this --",
        "A: And -- and then, you know, on their staff --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- they had a man tha -- he wa -- came after me, long after me, and he comes in the door and I\nsay to myself, SS. Sure enough. Yes, but -- and I went to the -- the manager, Dr. Rainer\nHildebrandt, I said to him, \u201cHow can you do that?\u201d He said, \u201cHe knows how to put up a new file\nsystem and all that, isn\u2019t that great? Good-bye.\u201d And I was furious with him, but actually there\nwas a reason why the Americans, together with Willy Brandt, they decided to dissolve that\ngroup, but that was long after I had gone. But while I was there it was interesting.",
        "Q: Were you anti-Communist most of your life?",
        "A: It was no issue during the Nazi time.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And before the Nazi time I was too small.",
        "Q: Yeah, no, no, clearly.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then, you know, I -- I was -- if I was anti-Communist, I was never as anti-Communist as\na -- I was anti-Nazi.",
        "Q: Nazi, yeah.",
        "A: I mean to -- of course we -- thanks to the Communist threat, erlof -- I -- Adolf Hitler came to\npower. No, I\u2019ve never really given it any -- ma -- my husband, you know, who accepted the\nLenin o -- oden -- and stuff like that, he said, I am accepting declarations from anyone if it for --\nis -- 1s -- if it\u2019s for the sake of peace. But he would never cease to speak his mind when the\nRussian delegation, th-the -- the -- and then east German delegation came to the house, the talk\nwas -- of course I kept my -- my mouth shut, h-he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m a -- Germany -- West\nGermany is only a colony of the Americans.\u201d And my husband, you know, shook his head and\nsaid, \u201cYeah, just like East Germany is a colony of the Soviets.\u201d",
        "Q: Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: And then he predicted the downfall of worldwide Communism so early you would never\n[indecipherable] in 1975.",
        "Q: And you -- you\u2019re talking about your third husband.",

        "Q: N -- N -- Niemoeller, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: -- yeah, my third husband. My second husband -- no, he -- they all died. I\u2019m a threefold\nwidow.",
        "Q: And your first husband you married from \u00b052 until you leave, or you were [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, until 54, I couldn\u2019t take hi -- I couldn\u2019t stand him any more.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: He was a very interesting man, but we were too different. And I couldn\u2019t frankly see myself\nstaying in Germany, nor could I see my son staying in Germany.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And was your -- was your son close to him, or was he --",
        "A: No, he was a baby. He met him later.",

        "A: Yeah, yeah, of course, several times.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: But didn\u2019t particularly care for him. I -- I f -- I took his father from him, but I furnished him\nwith two good stepfathers. Husband number two, he was not very effective, and he was a very\nmixed up and confused and difficult person. He was very good to my son, very good. Well, my\nson made it very easy for him to [indecipherable]. And then Martin Niemoeller and he, that was\nlove on first sight.",
        "Q: That was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Not on first sight, on second sight.",

        "Q: Ah, in *58.",
        "A: And we married in \u201959.",
        "Q: Okay. So you were married for nine years.",

        "A: I -- something in me must have se -- there must be some sense in our meeting, you know,\nbecause he was so -- he was so alone.

        "Q: What were you calling him?",
        "A: Pastor Niemoeller, of course. I said, \u201cHow come that you have stayed single now for so many\nyears?\u201d And soon as I said that I said to myself, I shouldn\u2019t have asked that question. And he just\nsmiled, and once we were out of the -- out of the restaurant, the hotel and walking, the snow was\nfalling, it was like in a fairy tale. Was only November. And he stopped and looked at me; he\nlooked so cute. And he said, you asked me a question, and because, you know, I\u2019m a ver -- I\u2019m --\nand Elie Wiesel says the same thing. I\u2019m very, very shy. So he would never have done the first\nstep. He had legions of women adoring him. So I took that, and I kissed him. And that was it.",

        "Q: He did?",
        "A: And -- yes, and be -- being seated in a restaurant, when the waiter asked what his daughter\nwanted, was me, you know, he would kick me under the table. Was very wise of him to marry a\nwoman that much younger. He would have died. During our marriage he would have died many\ntimes for neglecting himself and his -- his -- his health, you know? He would not go to bed when\nhe should --",

        "A: I never moved back.",
        "Q: No, well, physically you moved back.",
        "A: Physically no, because I knew I was coming to a very Americanized town, Wiesbaden. The\nAir Force headquarters was still there, the hospital was there. And all through my years in\nWiesbaden, I have not made one German friend.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: No, because as Martin\u2019s wife, that was -- he didn\u2019t have friends either. He had people who\neither loved him or despised him. And on his own level there was nobody, so he took all my\nfriends in. The entire staff of the hospital came Sunday after church for instance, for a drink and\na cigar. And he -- Martin\u2019s -- Martin\u2019s English was flawless.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: He spoke with a German accent, stronger than mine, but his -- it was -- when he --",

        "A: Both.",
        "Q: Both.",
        "A: Both, yeah, both. And we had our political -- our political views that was very di -- were --\nwere very different. He was naive in many ways. And one of these days, you know, it was --\nstarted off as nothing, and all of a sudden my husband has a -- has a tantrum. He\u2019s still seated at\nthe desk, and he begins to trample with his feet, scream.",

So Marc came down and\nwe start laughing in the back you -- the tears were coming from our eyes. We were going down\nto the -- on the floor, and all of a sudden there was complete quiet and after he stopped howling,\nhe turned around and saw us --",
        "Q: Laughing.",
        "A: -- dissolved in laughter and tears. And what does the man do? He starts laughing with us. He -\n- that was typical, typical. Once his sister was there when I had allegedly insulted him. When she\ndescended on me like an eagle, you know? \u201cYou cannot speak like that to my brother.\u201d And he\nturns on her and says, \u201cI love that about her, you know.\u201d His wife Elsa would never have dared\nthat, it wasn\u2019t done.",
        "Q: So -- so was -- was -- was he able to stop the tantrum sooner because --",
        "A: It stopped itself, he was spent.",
        "Q: Because you were not responding, and -- and stimulating it.",
        "A: No, because -- of course, of course.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Handwritten.",
        "Q: This is before you\u2019re married?",
        "A: We wrote to each other every day practically.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Every other day.",
        "Q: And do you have your letters to him, or only his letters to you?",
        "A: I have his letters -- my letters to him, too.",
        "Q: Too, you have both.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Under lock and key. He wrote beautiful letters. But yes, he was shy. There\nwas only one woman in his life and that was Elsa.",

I had married him after he was retired, so there would be\nlittle money. There is not much money now, but th-they did the best they could with me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They really -- the church of Hessen and Nassau carried me on angel\u2019s wings, I can\u2019t say it any\nother way. And after my conversion, ah, was marvelous the way they behaved.",
        "Q: Interesting.",

        "A: -- oh by the way your daughter died. Which one? I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] don\u2019t care,\neither. And then after a few days that must have been hell, he always hoped, he says, that it\nwould be Ut\u00e9 because he had a guilty conscience towards the other children because he showed\nhis preference to Ut\u00e9 all the time. She was an angel, she really was.",

        "A: No, he had a -- something happened to him when he, for the first time as a free man, with\nElsa, visited Dachau concentration camp.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Wanted to show her, you know, and the American officer.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because they kept the camp.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the only block that was standing, as a prison for their own G.I.\u2019s, you know, for all sorts\nof things, from murder to black market. And he finds himself standing in front of the crematoria,\nand so the crude sign, you know, board of s-something, on which it said, here so and so many\ninmates were killed between 1933 and 1945. And there, he says -- and he -- I -- I can quote him,\nI don\u2019t know if I can do it now by heart, verbatim, he said, \u201cIt wa -- like a cold chill came da --\nwent up my spine. I heard God\u2019s voice saying to me,\u201d -- wa -- well, you know, he said, \u201cI knew I\nhad an alibi between 1933 -- between 1937 and 1945.

        "A: I know.",
        "Q: -- at a certain point he was anti-Semitic, but then they don\u2019t speak about ho -- ho --",
        "A: Right, it\u2019s easy to say, yeah. And never stopped asking God\u2019s forgiveness.",

He had, you know, walls of books, theology books that he never\nread, didn\u2019t interest him. He was a pastor in this world to spread the message of Jesus.

And they have all sorts of marvelous [indecipherable]. First of all,\nwho would put closure? Who 1s there?",

        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: But that\u2019s not the Protestant view?",
        "A: That is -- oh well, more or less, yes. The hereafter is very, very important. While we Jews, we\nlive for this life. And what -- not what we think, but what we do is important. And that went very\nwell with me.",

        "A: She did not take it very well. First of all she said, \u201cHe\u2019s much too old for you.\u201d And then she\nsaid, \u201cHe\u2019s much too old for you.\u201d And then she came out with the truth, that years before -- and\nI even knew that, she had mentioned it at the time, when Elsa was forlorn and -- and -- and -- and\nalways when she was very depressed about her husband\u2019s absence when he was in the camp,\nDorha, the housekeeper, the one who was called -- was killed with her in that car crash; Elsa and\nDorha were killed together. Dorha would call my mother and said, \u201cWould you please come\nover? Frau Niemoeller is so depressed, she wants to see you.\u201d So my mother raced over there,\nsitting at her bedside, or whatever it was, and then, you know, after she complained, she did her\nbit of complaining, she said, \u201cYou know, if your husband,\u201d my father, \u201csomehow gets killed\nduring the you know, one way or the other, and I die, and my husband is still alive and you are\nstill alive, you\u2019ve got to marry him. I am not strong enough to be married to him.\u201d And my\nmother to -- obviously took that very seriously. But then we were being as graceful, as gracious\nas she was, she arranged herself with the given situation, and they became very close and dear\nfriends.",
        "Q: They did?",
        "A: Yes. It was almost touching to see those two, so close in age, together.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She was born in August, and they were separated by -- by four months, Martin was like\nAlbert Schweitzer, born on the 14\u201c of January.",

And h-had a massive stroke at age -- well, she was 80, she was\nabout my age, and -- which robbed her of her speech and use of her right arm and right leg, and I\nwas called to Berlin, somebody else took care of -- of my husband in Wiesbaden. I drove to\nBerlin, and the doctor took me aside and said, \u201cFrau Niemoeller, have no illusions, this clock has\nrun out.\u201d And I said, \u201cDoktor, you don\u2019t know my mother,\u201d you know? And my mother lived for\nmore than 12 years, regained her speech, use of her right arm, she could walk with a little limp.",
        "Q: You\u2019re kidding.",

        "Q: Did you become closer to your mother as -- as you got older?",
        "A: Yes, for the reason that she got older and more helpless, of course. But there is not a day that\ngoes by that I don\u2019t -- the I re -- really regret for not having had a relationship with my -- with\nmy mother. But my brother didn\u2019t have one either, in the end, you know.",
        "Q: Neither one of you did.",
        "A: No, no. She just -- but I realized it long before my -- my brother did, I think, that she was not\nto blame, that was the way she was made, that she had been educated. She lived in fear of men,\nand to -- she was not allowed, and she couldn\u2019t partake in discussions.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: She hadn\u2019t been brought up in -- you know, and Elsa was -- no, she -- Elsa was a -- a teacher\nof English, so she knew more. But in our circles a woman was raised as a girl to be married off.\nMarried off.",

        "A: I couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: You couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: And I never even imagined it. I only know he would have been hurt that I left the Messiah.\nJesus was his reason for surviving, you know? And it started early, when he was 14, he had a -- a\nhappening that when his father, who was a -- I remember my own -- my own father-in-law and\nmy mother-in-law, I met them when I was very little. And his father very much believed in\nsomething that pastors, or sometimes even rabbis don\u2019t do any more, visiting members of the\ncongregation and getting to know them. And his fa -- and whi -- pastor -- old Pastor Heinrich\nNiemoeller was exemplary. Every afternoon he\u2019d go and see somebody. And he visited th -- the\nhome of a miner. This was where he -- this was a mining district where they lived. And on the\nwall -- and the miner is -- is eaten up by some dreadful lung disease and on the wall Martin sees\nsome words under glass in German, \u201cWaswurde Jesus sagen?\u201d What would Jesus say? So this\nword guided him through all his life. Whatever he did, he would ask first, what would Jesus say\nto that? And how I could miss out on it because he would -- he would suspect a terrible void in\nme, what wasn\u2019t there, you know? I don\u2019t know how.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t think he would even understand it?",
        "A: No. It was -- would have been beyond him.",
        "Q: But I just couldn\u2019t have done otherwise. When people ask me, and I\u2019m often asked, now tell\nus the motivation why you became Jewish. I said, \u201cVery easy, I had to.\u201d I had to.",
        "Q: But then people say, so what\u2019s behind the having to?",
        "A: There is no [indecipherable] first of all, I do not -- I follow my mentors, Albert Friedlander\u2019s,\nand London\u2019s advice not to ever get in argument with Christians about it because I would soon\nnotice that I was being maneuvered into a corner where I have to defend myself. So when I\u2019m\nasked in a -- in a -- by the -- a member of the audie -- now tell us about the -- I said, \u201cI don\u2019t\ndiscuss that in public.\u201d But I will in a s-smaller and preferably Jewish circle. But the funny thing\nis that Martin\u2019s successor in office, Doktor Spengler, Jewish president of the Church of Hessen\nand Nassau, I didn\u2019t have to explain anything to him about the co-conversion. He called me one\nday, and he said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard you converted to Judaism.\u201d He said, \u201cI think it\u2019s marvelous.\u201d",

        "A: Yes, that is part of it, I am sure, I am sure. Because what was destroyed by Hitler, who was\nalmost -- I mean he -- he almost managed to -- to get rid of all the Jews in Europe, must have\nbeen so powerful that he felt it and he feared it. And that\u2019s why I had to find out what that 1s, you\nknow? Power has always attracted me, and Judaism is a very powerful religion. But not alien to\nme, but it\u2019s now part of me.",
        "Q: Right. And do you consider yourself religious now?",

        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "A: Oh, by the way, since you asked my -- my names, I was not -- the authorities have to come to\nmy parents after my birth to tell them what my name was going to be. They had not counted on a\ngirl. I was to be -- I was to be a boy because my father had lost his three brothers --",
        "A: -- in the first World War, which was such a tragedy. And here comes a girl, so not everybody\nwas terribly amused. My mother -- I was my mother\u2019s second child, because she had been\nmarried before, she wa -- married at age 19, a Baron von Hornstein, who not only had a Jewish\ngrandmother, but was the rightful heir to the name -- I\u2019m sorry, he was the child -- he was the\ngreat, great grandchild of Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton. That\u2019s the one thing I en -- I always\nenvied my sister who -- my stepsister -- half sister, who is 10 years older than I am, always\nenvied her for it.",
        "A: My mother married into that family, that was a zo -- the -- they are -- that was old nobility\naround Lake Constance, and very Catholic, so she had to agree that in case my half sister was\nborn as a boy that he had to be brought up Catholic, which 1s, I think, a very brutal decision to\nsplit a family that way. Well but so he was bor -- he was baptized in the Protestant faith, and then\nmy mother lost her husband during the first few weeks of the first World War, and became very\nill with tuberculosis, which meant she -- thanks to the help of the friend of the family, the victor -\n- Queen Victoria\u2019s great grand-nephew, the count of Coburg and Gotha -- not count, I\u2019m sorry,\nthe duke of Coburg and Gotha saw to it that she was put in a -- in a -- a sanitorium, and she\nsurvived very well. She died at 93. My mother\u2019s family is by far -- is lo -- a lot older than my\nfather\u2019s family. My father\u2019s family, of which I'll talk later, they were really newcomers to\nnobility, meaning they were mor -- they were nobilized in 1657, while my mother\u2019s family goes\nback to -- to Charlemagne, documented.",
        "A: Yes. And they were partially -- they we -- they came from the east, how much Slavic\ninfluence there was, we can only guess. A lot, I would say.",
        "A: Well, I -- sometimes, you know, the Vens, that Slavic tribe that ruled Germany between the\nriver Rhine and the -- and the -- or not -- not the Rhine, the Elba, and the Oda, they ruled in\nGermany, a wild tribe, for three to 400 years. So everybody has Vendish, Solbic, Serbic blood in\nthem. And my mother was born -- my mother\u2019s father was a Prussian general, and he had been\none of -- his name was von Brauchitsch, Brokovitce, you know, God knows what it was\noriginally.

        "A: Yes, his father had married several times, and there were your children, my children, our\nchildren. And there are funny legends going around about that family like a -- a Brauchitsch\nofficer stopped the little guy on -- in -- in a military school, asked for his name and then found\nout they were brothers. How many of them are true, I never -- I call them legends. So they were -\n- they didn\u2019t have much money of course, and my -- my --",
        "A: Oh, absolutely not --",

And my mother had -- there were six or seven children. Uncle Siegfried\nwas the oldest, and my grandmother was 18 years old, and she had the baby, as was done in\nthose days, at home, but thank goodness with the help of a -- of a doctor. And he wa -- wa -- held\nthe baby and declared him dead, and put him on a chair, and after awhile that dead child began to\nhowl and yell, and he -- he lived.

Oh my -- my grandfather had been the commander of\nColmar, Alsatian Colmar, which then was German, which as a consequen -- which had a cra --\nhad a confer -- consequence. About 20 years after this past war, let\u2019s say in 1965 or so, the\nFrench government offered French citizenship to my mother.",

Otherwise,\nyou -- she would never catch a husband.

        "A: That didn\u2019t, no, no, you know. And they met socially in Potsdam. He was a very outstanding\nyoung officer. He had been put in military school with all his brothers at age eight, and that was\na brutal education for this very sensitive boy. And he knew one thing, never mind what his father\nwanted, or what his -- his -- the plans that he had made for him, he will not enter the military as a\n-- choose the military as a career. His aim was become a diplomat and at a very young age, he\nbecame the adjutant of the then Reichschancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg. And in that capacity\nhe -- he -- for instance, he took -- he took the declaration of war to the Kaiser personally to be\nsigned.

And my -- my brother and his -- my -- my father and his brothers\nwent to war, and they all die -- they were all killed except my father, who had a terrible, terrible\nshrapnel wound right above the eye -- the ear, the left ear. And spent a year or so in military -- in\nmilitary hospitals. Was operated on under brutal circumstances. And then he came home, and he\nfound a mother who had, you know, who had been a proud woman with her beautiful four boys,\nand her -- her husband, a general for a husband.

        "A: And -- and it car -- came close to it -- close to serfdom in many provinces.

        "A: No.",

She\ncouldn\u2019t -- she never received love at home, so she couldn\u2019t give love to her children, which was\ntragic. She had a horror of men because her father was -- had been after the daughters, which --",
        "A: Yes. And it must have come to a scene once where my mother overheard her mother behind a\nclosed door yelling, \u201cAnd if you do that once more, I\u2019m going to divorce you.\u201d I mean, he never\nreally touched them, you know, but it came pretty close.",
        "A: My mother told me.",
        "A: Yes, much later when I would understand.",
        "A: She was afraid of her father and in consequence of -- of all men, including God. She was\nafraid of God. She could deal with Jesus Christ, but not with God himself.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think once. Not even once. She was affectionate with my little brother.",
        "A: Yes, and of course that made it very hard for me --",
        "A: -- because I -- I was always told how homely I was. I had very little hair, the hair came late,\nand I was spindly little legs, you know, fresh. And I once overheard a terrible thing, which I -- at\nthe time I couldn\u2019t really interpret. Behind a -- a paravol, I overheard, in somebody else\u2019s house,\npeople talking and si -- once one lady said to, was it her husband, saying, \u201cUnbelievable, that\nchild and this beautiful mother? Those poor people.\u201d So that was me.",

        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: That was -- yeah, that was done in our circles. Most of them slept in different room, but with\ndoor open so my father can -- could come and help my father. My father suffered from the most\nterrible nightmares.",
        "A: Not only as far as the past was concerned, but it always ended with a horribly -- with this\nhoarse voice he\u2019d say, \u201cThey are coming for me, they are coming for me.\u201d \u201cSie holen mich, sie\nholen mich.\u201d Well, one day they came.",

        "A: And to wake him up and all that.",
        "A: But it was taken for granted.",
        "A: Yes, I thought it was. They never fought, they were very respectful to -- to one another, but\nthere was no -- no tenderness --",
        "A: -- no -- no, it wasn\u2019t -- just somehow -- I -- I could compare because th -- I-I adopted a family\nin the neighborhood.",

The atmosphere was grave at home, if\nnot black. And we grew up without supervision, too, you know my mother could -- we were sent\nout into the street, I was a regular little Berlin street girl, unusual for our circles, very unusual.\nAnd -- but home, my home was with the Nickel family, really.

        "A: My father is -- not only administered the money, but made a lot of money for them. The\nHohenzollern -- Hohenzollern family though, were imbeciles. Really. He did -- my father was\nnot a monarchist. My father couldn\u2019t ta -- stand the Hohenzollerns, who took advantage of him\nwhenever possible. But he loved this old, old, confused old man.",
        "A: Who had caused so much trouble in the world, but would never admit to it. Never one word.\nAnd who was easily influenced. When the Nazis came he had remarried. Remarried a princess, a\nwidowed princess with four children, of -- two sons and two daughters, Princess of Schoenaich-\nCarolath, and who was 30 some years younger than he, and he fell in love, you know. His first\nwife, the Empress Auguste, who must have been an angel, she loved him. And she died literally\nof a broken heart after he went to Holland. And then he soon, within two years he was remarried\nand lived in his golden cage, and my father had his own apartment there, of course, and went --\nstayed with him, I would say, an average of a week a month.",
        "A: And when him -- when my father left him, he had talked reason to him, you know, but he\nalways knew, as soon as he turns his back, the old man would --",
        "A: -- fall prey to any bad influence. Poor man.",

        "A: And one remembered the other, and they really fell in love over -- they must have -- over the\nletters, because they already got -- he got out of the military and they married in May of 1919.\nMy sister was always -- half sister was six months -- six years old.",
        "A: And then was the question what was he going to do with his life. He had -- he ra -- was a very\ngood looking man, he had had his military -- military academy education, which I mean for those\nyears were -- was a pretty good one. He was right away spotted as a very special -- very special\nman with a talent for finances. Well, they got married and even though they had hardly enough\nto eat, they had to have a servant who would cook. And --",
        "A: Oh, would sh -- well, first of all they -- they asked around in Potsdam and Anna\u2019s name was\ngiven to them. She was -- Anna was born in -- in the 1980 -- 18 -- 1887, so she was already, you\nknow, not very young for those days any more, and she was -- her -- her family, also noble, her\nfamily, von Massel -- I call them Shtraylo in my -- in my book, I believe. There were, due to the\ncircumstances there was nothing to eat, it was dismal circumstances. They moved to one of their\nestates, they had an estate. So Anna could pick, you know, and she took one look at my mother\nand said this lady is not going to interfere with my housekeeping, you know. She was right. And\nno children, thank goodness. So she accepted for -- for, I mean, peanuts for pay, the position. My\nmother -- my mother and father had been assigned an ap -- miserable apartment, which is still\nstanding in Potsdam facing a coal supply firm, and it was all windows going to the north, and\nthere were -- was a bit wet, and but you -- what could they do? And that\u2019s where I began my start\nin life. And when Anna heard that a baby was on the way, she seriously considered leaving. But\nthen on the other hand, you know, maybe my mother had no interest -- as little interest in a child\nthan she had for the household. She stayed, watched me being born and I was her baby. From the\nfirst day on, I grew up on Anna\u2019s arms, and all the tenderness that I didn\u2019t get from my mother, I\ngot from Anna.",

He taught us all, we were\nabout 12 children. That was neat, that was neat. And then we -- even though I was so small and -\n- and I was sick very often, my parents insisted on me entering the so-called high school, the\nhigher school, not at age 10, but at age nine.

Oh yes, a lot of 1t was -- you know, all these beautiful villas\nwhere Jews had lived, that Jews had -- had built, had worked for, when they were expelled,\nbefore being dis -- deported and killed, those villas were taken by the Nazis and high military\npeople. You know, I had one Brauchitsch, General Field Marshall -- Field Marshall Walter von\nBrauchitsch, a cousin of my mother\u2019s, who was Chief of Staff of the German armed forces, of\nthe German army. And he lived in one of these big villas, and was -- he had been a member of\nthe Nazi party, with the golden bird. And even though he lived, walking, maybe seven minutes\naway, I not ever in my life set eyes on him. My father would not allow anyone even faintly\nresembling -- faintly connected with the Nazis, he would not allow it, but my mother was -- was\nmy mother\u2019s brother in a -- in -- a young o -- an older brother, of course, he joined the SR and\nthe party. And you -- he didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t come to the house after that.",
        "A: No, no, no, she joined --",
        "A: -- absolute -- absolutely, yes.",
        "A: And on the other hand there was the other brother of my mother, who married a Jewish lady\nfrom --",
        "A: -- from Russia, originally.",
        "A: No, to -- to -- to Dahlem, I moved at age six.",
        "A: Yes. To -- from Potsdam to Berlin --",
        "A: -- at age two and a half.",
        "A: When I was six we moved. That makes it 1929. We moved t -- to Dahlem, had that rented\nhouse.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Th-The school was -- yeah, my class was -- was -- was full of Jewish girls, and one by one\nthey disappeared. But except for my dear, dear, dear friend Anita Frank, who was -- they were --\nshe and her brother were already orphaned at the time, she died in Bergen-Belsen. Reinhardt\nmade it out of -- of Auschwitz, they all reached safety.",
        "A: Yeah. For a very simple fact. Not only were the parents well informed, but they had a lot of\nmoney.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I never, except for once in Berlin during the day I saw an open truck loading Jews\nfrom house -- from a Jew house. Otherwise these sights were not -- you know, I was not familiar\nwith that sight, because even if they had come for them, you know, with the wide spaces in\nbetween the houses, nobody would have known.",
        "A: No, I wa -- I remember his growing interest when I said well, Ellen Ginsburg, or Alice Levy,\nor wa -- and he said, \u201cThey\u2019re Jewish?\u201d And I said yes. And behind that question was always,\nwhat can we do for them? That ha -- that happened very, very early. I remember the first incident\nat school where I didn\u2019t even notice it, but my father immediately did, where we handed little\nforms indicating what religion we were, you know? Name, and -- and re -- what religion the\nparents were. And -- and what -- what heritage and all that, I remember. Suza -- Suzi Levy,\nSusannah Levy, si -- Ellen Levy, sitting behind me and showed me hers, and that said, we hereby\ntestify that so and so is of purely Jewish background. It was the wa -- death verdict for them, you\nknow? And I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t find anything wrong with it, I thought that goes with school, they\nwant to know. Boy, did they ever want to know. And then, you know, by -- by -- of course, I was\ntaken out of that school, and by the time I was taken out in 1937, there were still -- even though\nthere were Jewish schools in Berlin, there were still some Jewish girls in my class. And by the\ntime I came back in 1939, there were -- I don\u2019t know, all left, they were all gone.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t have the f -- I was not a go -- very good friend with the exception to Anita and\nshe in \u00b041 once rang our doorbell, you know. She\u2019d been told that we were okay, and Anita I\u2019ve\nnever forgotten. She --",
        "A: She wa -- her f -- her -- her -- she lived in -- they lived in Dahlem. How much money they\nhad, I never knew. Very, very much. The mother, widowed mother, can you imagine such a\nthing, left the children. Anita was then 16 or so, and the brother nine, alone to fend for\nthemselves. She left for Switzerland to marry a man, in the hope that she would dr -- get the\nchildren, too. That mother must not have been terribly bright according to what Reinhardt says.",
        "A: And of course they moved one -- from one relative to the other, from one Jewish school to the\nother, until a fa -- she finally -- were both finally caught by the -- by the Nazis and she became a\nnurse, a nurse\u2019s aide -- she wanted to be a midwife.",
        "A: A nurse\u2019s aide in the Jewish hospital, and took her brother an -- who was then 12, and\nallegedly av -- an -- a electricians assistant, and they -- they -- they lived there in the hospital,\nand one day -- and that\u2019s when Anita came to visit. And Anita, I said, \u201cWhat about going into\nhiding?\u201d You know, and we ha -- gonna --",
        "A: -- and she said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do it because of my brother, he looks so Jewish.\u201d Well Anita had\nlooked like a country girl, you know, coffa -- kinky hair and brown eyes, and like a -- like an\napple. And the little -- little Reinhardt, no, and she of cour -- felt responsible for him,\nSwitzerland. And he told her, after I found him again in New York a few years ago, he told me\nthat he was beseeching her to try and go across the -- the border illegally to Switzerland. And he\nsaid, \u201cWa -- wa -- all they can do is shoot us.\u201d Because that little boy knew, obviously, and --\nand she said no -- she was too Prussian, you know? No, no, things will -- wi -- wi -- will work\nout, and they were first sent to Theresienstadt. And Theresienstadt, oh there were -- they were\nreported to the Gestapo, you know, because they -- their position was somehow half legal. To the\nGestapo, they are both deported to -- to Theresienstadt by a man by the name of Gottschalk, a\nJewish spy of which Berlin was full. Remember what\u2019s her name, Stella?",
        "A: Stella --",
        "A: Gottschalk [indecipherable] Stella -- Stella Gottschalk.",
        "A: They both sent to Theresienstadt, and there they lived like everybody else, vegetated in the\nstadt -- in the city that the Fuhrer had given the Jews, for -- meant for 3,000 people, and I think\nthey had 45 in there. But you know, there were transports to -- to --",
        "A: -- to Auschwitz all the time, and one day it was -- no, but I have to stop here, because a few\nweeks after they had appeared in Theresienstadt, who comes? Herr Gottschalk. His fate had\ncaught up with him. And Reinhardt spotted him right away, and took -- was invited for a\nconference among the Jews, what shall we do with him? He deserves the death penalty, but he\ndidn\u2019t go to the -- he were -- they executed him. They were working -- Reinhardt was working in\na chemical cleaners -- at a chemical clean -- for the SS you know, and they threw him in a\ncleaning machine.",
        "A: And when he came out he was very clean, but quite dead.",
        "A: And then he was -- Reinhardt was selected and put on the train for Auschwitz, and the last\nthing Anita said to him -- and that tells you how naive she was, he said when you arrive -- she\nsaid, \u201cWhen you arrive there, tell them you are only 11 and very sickly.\u201d Had he followed her\nadvice --",
        "A: -- they would have sent him to the gas chamber. On the train he was told to say he was 17 and\na learned -- and -- and a electrician.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how he eventually -- and that\u2019s a story by itself, survived.",
        "A: And how.",
        "A: And oh, every detail of it. It was -- 1t was -- you know, by that time, Martin Niemoeller had\nalready entered our family --",
        "A: -- who was very naive, and thanks to -- thanks to my father mainly, I -- I like to think, he\nfinally, when it hit home, he -- within a few months he was -- he was cured.",
        "A: No, no, no. And he decided it would be good for the volken, whatever, and he -- he voted for\nHitler in 1933 --",
        "A: -- something unthinkable for my parents.",
        "A: I was the first of the family to meet him, because we\u2019ve had a very, very nice old Pastor\nLange, and Pastor Lange was supposed to retire. And I think we went there for Christmas and for\nEaster, that was about the amount of time my -- my parents spent in a church. And then my\nfather heard there was a new pastor and that was the time he decided that his daughter should\nstart going to Sunday school. And I attended the very first service Martin Niemoeller ever held in\nDahlem.",
        "A: And I -- I had been taken there against my will, because I had a hockey game that day. They\nwere always held on Sundays, much to my father\u2019s chagrin. So he took me -- he dragged me, and\n-- and handed me over physically to one of the ushers, and I sat in the front -- front aisle.",
        "A: Pew, in the front, pew, and decided to behave as outrageously as possible, sticking my tum --\ntongue out, and -- and I was full of freckles, you know, looking as unkempt as possible, even\nthough I\u2019d been forced to take a bath before. And there comes this good looking -- with our old,\nwhite haired Pastor Lange, comes that good looking, slender, very dark man, he had pitch black\nhair. Ver -- olive complexion, otherwise he reminded me of my father. And then he started to\ntalk to us children, not about Jesus or v -- the Virgin Mary or anything, but about his time in\nWorld War I as a submarine commander.",
        "A: That -- very wise, because everybody was listening. And I decided I would love that man. But\nI didn\u2019t let -- know of -- anybody of the family know. I came home and I dis -- my father I felt\ndeserved punishment for -- for forcing me to go there, and my father asked, \u201cOh, how was it?\u201d\nOh, oh, was okay. \u201cWho -- how was the new pastor?\u201d Oh, he\u2019s okay, you know. \u201cAnd what did\nhe talk about, what\u2019s his name?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I knew darn well, you know. But as time\nprogressed, my parents went over to his house and I -- they came to our house, and I decided to\ntry the Niemoeller children, but a minister\u2019s children are notorious for being pious, and ha! Did I\nmeet a bunch? Six children with a -- three of them black, like the father, and three of them\nblonde with blue eyes like the mother, and gorgeous children. And I fit in like th-the runt of the\nlitter, you know?",
        "A: Absolutely, and I -- I lived in there and roamed around the vast parsonage, and there was --\nthat house was so noisy, you wouldn\u2019t believe this -- once in awhile the door would open, and\nthe pastor, with a stentoric voice would ask for -- for -- would demand silence, otherwise he\nwould come and clobber us all. And the children all say, \u201cHe always says, he never does it,\u201d you\nknow. That was my first -- my first visit with Martin Niemoeller. Little did I know --",
        "A: -- that I was to be --",
        "A: I-I was nine.",
        "A: Or even eight. That was before --",
        "A: He was -- he was 33 years older than I --",
        "A: -- figure it out. Yeah. He was born in \u201992, I was born in --",
        "A: -- \u00b023, yeah.",
        "A: Thirt -- 32 years old. And then I soon asked my parents to spare me that experience of -- of --\nof children\u2019s services, but let me go with them. Now they started going to church.",
        "A: As soon as the Confessing Church was founded by him, they -- and soon as I had been -- had\nbeen confirmed, I became a member -- we became member --",
        "A: -- of the Confessing Church, yes. And now, in my eyes, I mean he was an endangered species\nof course, because I va -- Frau Niemoeller came all the time and told me the Gestapo had called,\nthey had searched the house and all that. So I decided when the Gestapo comes, I will save his\nlife. So I went to Woolworth -- and I got a very meager amount of money each week and bought\na chain and a lock, with which I was going to -- what\u2019s the English word? The Gestapo 1 --",
        "A: -- keeping him -- keeping them from -- from --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I was going to lock the Gestapo up.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, I was not modest in my exp -- but 1t never happened.",
        "A: But I heard every one of his -- of his sermons.",
        "A: Iwas 15.",
        "A: He was in the con -- I had hoped, while in boarding school, 14 - 15, that by the time I came\nout, he would be able to confirm me, but no such thing.",
        "A: So his -- his successor or hi -- rather his -- his -- yeah, [indecipherable] Helmut Gollwitzer, he\nconfirmed me in his stead.",
        "A: By that time I had already witnessed Kristallnacht.",
        "A: In Eberswalde.",
        "A: Well, yeah, well there was --",
        "A: Because she\u2019d been fresh to me, an I remember s -- I had to climb on a -- on the bench in\norder to reach her because she was so big.",
        "A: I slapped her across her stupid face. She was a nice girl, really.",
        "A: But we -- but that, 1t was personal, that really was personal.",
        "A: Bettina von Ribbentrop, and my father was so proud of me.",
        "A: Teacher was not in the room. He was -- it was in dur -- during intermission, you know,\nsomething like that.",
        "A: Both -- God, I completely forgot that. Both daughters of Madame Scholz-Klink, the\nReichsfrauenfuehrerin, she attended -- was in my -- they were in my class, in the same\nclassroom. Isolde, and I don\u2019t remember the name of the other. Well, with them you really had to\nbe careful. And the children --",
        "A: -- of -- of -- of Himmler, the daughter of Himmler, Gudrund -- Gudrund, of course, she was a\nfew years younger. And the children of Woost, two daughters, they were also in another grade,\nbut you w -- w -- I saw them every day. They were -- they managed to get a teacher fired, but\nfortunately he did not end up in a concentration camp, the best teacher the school had. They told\ndaddy about a few remarks he had made, daddy took care of them. It was -- you know, what I\nlearned at home was to keep my mouth shut outside. You know, I was a blabbermouth, but not in\nthese things. And I was revolting against -- rebelling against my parents except in that one field.\nAnd so what I was taught -- I always say that, was the meaning of conspirative behavior, very\nearly. I mean, Jewish families can talk about their children learning it at a -- at a very early age.\nAnd the -- the meaning of your own conscience, how very, very important that was, that intact\nconscience. Never do u -- or -- 0-or say anything that you might not be able to sleep at night.\nAnd that was key in both life, for me it was normal, was nothing. And I had Ditte, of course.",
        "A: Ditte was next to me always. We were a feared duo. But she had to be much more careful\nbecause of her Jewish mother. What they left, that could only be done in -- in Dahlem, in Berlin.\nThey left a very quiet life. The children, they didn\u2019t even have piano lessons, nothing, you know?\nThey lived the Jewish family life, and that\u2019s how Ditte\u2019s mother survived. With her looks, to me\nstill a mystery.",
        "A: Already?\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Not yet. That came as time went on. The first years -- few years, it was Gut Morgen.",
        "A: And -- yes, and I don\u2019t remember the exact point in -- during which that wer -- heil Hitler was\nintroduced.",
        "A: But even by the way, a teacher would greet the class with a German salute, you knew whether\nthe -- she -- it was only female te -- no, no, we had two male teachers, whether they were Nazis\nor not. I -- I knew why, you know. I was brought up with that six and seventh and eighth sense,\nand which has led me through my life, by --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s right. Absolutely.",
        "A: That is the most wondrous thing. I was never told, don\u2019t repeat that outside of the house. I\nknew. I just knew.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, by the way, that -- that -- there was a period of rebellion after I -- in ni -- in 1933\nmy father had taken us to Unter den Linden to see Hindenburg and Hitler. And on the way back I\nremember my brother and I, we both decided to count flags hanging out of the windows. And\nwhen we arrived home, I had more, but that -- it came out that I had counted the -- I -- th-the\nswastika flags, and my brother had counted the black, white, and red. And I se -- I count -- I have\nmore, and for that fact alone, my mother slapped me across the face. Hakenkreuzfahen. You just\nnever do that. And then that night I decided to become Nazi, and with the goal of eventually\nmarrying Hitler, or becoming his cook.",
        "A: Well, you know Hitler -- and even my father was -- he w -- my father was so wonderful, he\nsaid, \u201cWell, have you ever thought about the fact that when Hitler\u2019s getting older, and you will\nhave to wait for an awfully long time to marry him. Why don\u2019t you plan to be his cook?\u201d Okay.\nSo every morning when he -- I came down, he say, \u201cWhat would you like to cook for your fuihrer\ntoday? Spinach? Brussel sprouts?\u201d You know, he was a vegetar -- so that period did not last\nlong.",
        "A: No, no, no --",
        "A: -- no, not at all, he re -- he seemed very str -- stern, but --",
        "A: -- very serious about it.",
        "A: And then something happened that made me change my mind, not my parents. I was invited\nto the home of a mutual friend notorious anti-Nazi, who had a tea party in her beautiful house.\nAnd since I often visited her, I rang the doorbell, and I said, \u201cCan a -- can I come in?\u201d And the --\nthe servant said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t come in today, Frau Pietschker,\u201d -- ha -- was her name, \u201cshe has\nher tea party.\u201d And sh -- there appears Frau Pietschker in a beautiful flowered dress. And she\nsays, \u201cCome in, come in, I want to show you to my ladies,\u201d you know. And she had a beautiful\noval salon, with tables like this, and a free room in the front. She drags me -- I was in leather\npants, you know? No socks are on, just -- just sandals, not washed, nothing. And she puts me in\nthe middle of the room, and says, \u201cLadies, just listen for one moment. This is Ulrich von Sell\u2019s\ndaughter. She is a Nazi.\u201d I -- I hoped the floor would open and swallow me because the laughter\nthat followed was -- would -- I know it would follow me for a lifetime, and it did. I went home\nand all the Nazi things that I\u2019d gathered, everything with the -- with the swastika on it, I put in an\nold handkerchief, and carried them out to the garbage, but I threw them in somebody else\u2019s\ngarbage. That was the end.",
        "A: I -- I was so -- that my father -- well, you know, I -- everybody knew my father, you know? It\nwas so humiliating to me, that I didn\u2019t show much character and stood up for the man I loved. I\njoined the other side. And that was the brief intermission, the brief period.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s why they laughed.",
        "A: They just could not believe it. I --",
        "A: -- we never had an ow -- of course we di -- we never went to Nazi\u2019s houses, nor did Nazis --\nNazi Germans, as one should really say, come to our house. It was just -- I -- I remember we\nwere good friends, one of -- last German ambassador to -- Dickhoff was his name, he lived a few\nhouses down the street. He came to dinner a few times, but then when Hitler progressed, he was\npersona non grata. I didn\u2019t even notice, but you know --",
        "A: It was really -- and the -- he foresaw, years before Hitler came, what would happen if he came\nto power, because Hitler didn\u2019t fall from the sky like a meteor, you know? He had been a -- a\nknown agitator on the political scene for 14 years. I was against everything that Hitler did or\nsaid, I didn\u2019t specify, you know? I -- and then of course, were the Jews, the Jews, the Jews. We\nhad Jewish friends.",
        "A: No, no, no, Hitler\u2019s speeches were not listened to in our house. It was on very early put on the\nBBC, and that too, my -- there my father instructed us, when you -- when you listen to -- found\nthe station BBC, you ha -- after you turn off the radio -- radio entered our house late, in \u201936\nmaybe, you have to put the knob back to anything else. Sure enough, when the Gestapo came to\nthe house, it was after Martin Niemoeller\u2019s incarceration, the first thing the f -- man number one\ndid, go the radio and turn it on.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Was a German station.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Ica -- [have hundreds of stories.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: My godfather.",
        "A: But you know, girls are not godchildren of the Kaiser. So my brother for his birthdays\nreceived all sorts -- is beautiful pla -- silver -- pure silver things. And I never got anything, you\nknow, so I decided if I\u2019d ask my -- my father why da -- isn\u2019t he my godfather. Because that\u2019s\nonly boys, and so on. So I decided as soon as I learned to write -- that had noth -- something to\ndo with it, I would bring about a situation where he couldn\u2019t say no. And then I thought -- I\nwrote, you know, like a child, and I addressed him Liebe Kaiser, dear Emperor, using no name,\nor majesty or some liebe. Some of them are -- one 1s printed in the -- in one of my books, you\nknow, Liebe Kaiser, and then I -- I -- I se -- I didn\u2019t really ask him, but you know, I know you\nare the godfather of my brother, can I be -- please be your godchild too? Something like -- and\nthen I thought it would be very nice if I included a little present, something he could really use.\nAnd I just learned from my grandmother to crochet, a white potholder with a red rim. And I\nenclosed that, and I put it in an envelope. And next time my father went to Holland, I said to him,\nwould he please -- I trusted him, would he please give this to the Kaiser? And my father did, you\nknow, vastly amused, of course. My -- the Kaiser was vastly amused, and from then on, he sent\nme things for my birthday, but no silver plates or anything like that. A scooter. A dynamo light --\na dynamo light for my -- for my -- for my bicycle, stuff like that.",
        "A: And I was conv -- I was convinced that he had tried out the scooter himself, you know, in the\n-- in the -- he went to the store, you know, and o -- did that all himself.",
        "A: He was -- he was -- yes, he called me the little monkey. Never referred to me by anything\nelse. But there\u2019s a story behind that.",
        "A: Yeah, sure. Once we had the brother of the sis -- my sister\u2019s fr -- girlfriend, who was then a\nyoung officer, must have been in \u201937 - \u00b038, who came to visit, not beknownst to us, and at the\ntable already ha -- he had developed Nazi ideas, and I saw my father\u2019s face grow paler and paler,\nbut fortunately the young man had to leave right after -- after dinner, and I was delegated to\naccompany hi -- him to the -- to the underground. And passing Martin Niemoeller\u2019s church, there\nwas a light -- it was already dark, there was a light in the church, and he said, \u201cWell, this is\nThursday evening, so what -- what\u2019s -- what\u2019s going on there?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, those are the -\n- the prayer -- the -- the service 1s held every night for all the pastors in concentration camps.\u201d\nAnd then he started, \u201c\u201cWhat? That is a scandal.

We never heard from the young man again, fortunately. And my father told that\nstory to -- to his majesty, and his majesty thought it was very amusing, called me little monkey.",

        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Sinister, almost, you know. You opened the door and the atmosphere was already coming at\nyou. It was only forebodings of -- every day it was something new that Hitler had done, or order,\nwhatever. And he -- my father had been right in everything.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, exactly.",
        "A: Exactly, mommy -- I called her mommy. Mommy wanted -- she loved, she adored children.\nEvery morning she would go to the bakery and buy heaps of -- of -- of cake, just in case the\nchildren brought home friends, and there should be enough to eat for everybody. But in -- you\nknow, then came a time when they had to, except for the little boy, had to tell the three daughters\nwhat -- you know, th-the dangers they were in. And she -- they tried to get all the children out of\nthe country. They succeeded with the oldest one, Eve. Eve still lives in England, she\u2019s now 86 or\n88, and it was too late for -- for the other ones to get out of the country. And the little boy,\nHerman, that was my so-called foster brother, he was the first German student to enter the United\nStates after the war.",
        "A: Got a law degree, he married Phyllis Fritchie, does the name mean anything to you?",
        "A: He has the north -- had the North Virginia Sun, or something, newspaper man.",
        "A: And he was Stevenson\u2019s campaign manager.",
        "A: And Herman wound up as the ambassador for the United States under Reagan in South\nAfrica. That\u2019s a career. But we got kind of, you know --",
        "A: Severity, yeah.",
        "A: Good question, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: My father tended to melancholia and to depression, that\u2019s what I inherited from him.",
        "A: Now, thanks to modern medicine, I don\u2019t have that any more.",
        "A: And my mother was, you know, she was even, and lighthearted, and -- and she must have\nsuffered like hell, too, you know? Always grim moods. And then, of course, being in the position\nhe was in, whenever he was there, there were daily fights with the so-called Empress, who\nloathed my father.",
        "A: And my fa -- I say that in my books, too, it came to such a point that the -- that at night 1 -- th-\nthe door to the apartment of -- there were -- there was a glass door, was not knocked but\nhammered on in the middle of the night and my father opened the -- the door, and outside stood a\nlittle man with his nightshirt on, and a f -- and a coat thrown over it, the Kaiser, in tears. He\nwould say to my father, \u201cShe was so bad to me again.\u201d \u201cSie war immer so schlecht zu mir.\u201d She\nwas absolutely wicked, and the ki -- my father said at one point to us children, and he had also\nmade it known in Doorn that he would not even go take her for a wa -- go for a walk with her,\nbecause she 1s capable of jumping into the moat and tell the world I pushed her in.",
        "A: This 1 --",
        "A: Oh, no, no --",
        "A: -- the Gestapo didn\u2019t come.",
        "A: Nothing happen -- nothing happened that night except for -- except for the fact that, you\nknow, the next day we found out who had been killed, the man who constantly came to the\nhouse, the former Reichskanzler von -- von -- you know, I say the name, I can\u2019t remember it\nnow. Schleicher. He had been murdered, you know, the Gestapo came into his house, and they\nwere having breakfast there, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. He and his wife, dead. And my father\nwas in Holland at the time. He came back, you know, just for a few days, he came back, I sat on\nhis lap, where I belonged, in his study, and the phone rings. And my father said -- he was so\ntired, he said, \u201cYou take it.\u201d And on the phone, that must have been second of July, third of July,\n1934, a fat voice --",
        "A: A fat voice, not -- you know, I use -- they usually identify themselves, and this is so and so,\ncan -- Herr von Sell! So I had the receiver to my father, and I saw, \u201cYes?\u201d And then just a, \u201cyes,\nyes.\u201d And then he hung up. It had been Goring, telling him that he shouldn\u2019t feel all too sure\nabout his being safe, the next time they would get him. And from that day on, I was so afraid of\nmy father\u2019s -- of my father\u2019s --",
        "A: Well, I was --",
        "A: -- you know, this far from him. He was paralyzed, almost. That overwhelmingly fat -- it\u2019s a\nfat voice, like nobody -- you know, high pitched. And because my father, of all the Nazis, he --\nhe hated th -- the one he hated the most was Goring, because Goring should have had\n[indecipherable] a flier, a gentleman, coming from a good family, he should have known better.\nInstead he played God, and the famous saying that, I decide who is Aryan or not, indicated that\nhe was in the position to decide over life and death.",
        "A: Because there was a list, obviously, and he was missed.",
        "A: He wa -- my father wa -- must have --",
        "A: Yeah. And so he took the receiver himself and called my father up. There had been -- my fa --\nGoring was a personal enemy of my father\u2019s. My father had two personal enemies under the --\namong the Nazis. One was Keitel, Field Marshall Keitel, and one was Goring. And those days it\nwas Goring who was much more powerful, you know. Goring was, among other things, he was a\nbig hunter. And he would deal with my father for the permission to hunt at one of the estates that\nbelonged to the Kaiser.",
        "A: And my father said nyet just a few times too often, until Goring didn\u2019t have to ask permission\nany more, just went. And not even -- he not only came back with the horns or whatever, but for\nth -- terribly precious pictures, carpets and so on. But there was very little my father could do.",
        "A: And Goring once -- that -- that really did the trick. When Goring came to a party of the\nHohenzollerns to which he had not been invited. Oh boy, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: You know, there were Nazis among the Hohenzollerns. Victoria Louisa. The Kaiser\u2019s only\ndaughter. The mother of the future queen of Greece, who went to school with me in\n[indecipherable]. She -- she was ready for the 80\" birthday of her father, where the entire\nmishpowha came, to wear on her beautiful dress, a swastika of diamonds. And my father stood in\nthe door, and he said, \u201cWith that thing on, you have to step over my body.\u201d She took it off. There\nwas Prince Auguste Wilhelm, there were plenty -- and even the Crown Prince. He came to the --\nhe came to the -- the Potsdam ceremony without being invited. You know, to get himself in with\nthe Nazis. He might be king one day, you know?",
        "A: No dignity.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, oh absolutely, absolutely.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: There were -- well, there was no -- you know, there was no resistance movement in Germany\nbecause we couldn\u2019t move. The first batch of resisters that had been, th -- the feared\nCommunists.",
        "A: And the same time that Hitler, in Potsdam, said he would be a good and peaceful leader. The\nfirst prisoners were marched into saxen -- in-into Sachsenhausen concentration camp, only a\nstone throw away. It was the Socialists, the Communists, the trade unionists. And that was all the\nresistance there was. Then came that huge goo -- that group, sizeable group of those who said he\nwon\u2019t be so bad, you know, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s ra -- as a matter of fact, we'll deal with him. And then\ncame the rather big group of those who decided to go into inner-emigration, be Nazi, and don\u2019t\ndo anything. And those, after the war, were the most despicable ones, because they could -- they\nclaimed they were not anti-Nazi -- they were anti-Nazis, but they didn\u2019t do anything.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when my parents decided to put up a fight wherever it was possible. Getting to\nHitler is as -- is as a -- was as impossible as it is now to get rid of Fidel Castro. Once a dictator\nhas established himself, it is almost impossible to get rid of him. And so you must -- you -- there\nwere plenty of things, especially helping, helping Jews. And that developed slowly, until the\nJews were really in vital danger, in mortal danger. And that\u2019s when the Countess Maltzan was\none of them. She worked with my fa -- oh, my father, I have to say, was inducted into the\nGerman army, even though he was so terribly wounded, and he was much too old, after -- a-at --\nat the beginning of the war, and --",
        "A: -- in \u201939, and wa -- and he was sacked by them in -- must have been \u201942. His -- his boss was\nCanaris, and at the same outfit where he was -- where he was working, there -- it was since --\ncensorship of letters. And that is when he -- he and the ga -- Countess Maltzan -- and she only\ntold me that after the war, and that\u2019s where we got most of the Jews that came to the house, you\nknow?",
        "A: I -- they --",
        "A: -- it wa -- passing through. Our house could -- even though where there were no children in\nthe house, 1-it -- people could not be hidden. They just -- they just pa -- they just received shelter\nfor awhile, claiming to be a seamstress, a gardener. And then of course th -- of the greatest help\nwere the air raids, and the -- the destruction, so a man could turn up, unless he looked like -- like\na Jew, and say all my papers were burned.",
        "A: So we loved the British, especially the British, for -- you know, unloading their bombs over\nour heads, even though I must say I was terrified of them.",
        "A: Terrified. Yet we blessed -- we blessed them every day, and prayed for their safe home --\nhome-going.",
        "A: And that\u2019s why -- it was as you d -- declare somebody as a -- as a cousin of a chauffeur of a\nsomething like that, wasn\u2019t all too difficult. Living in the house for any length of time would\nhave been too -- too different.",
        "A: I mean, hiding -- and especially in that neighborhood.",
        "A: Hiding in the middle of the city, not so bad. But in order to hide one Jew, that is not clear to\neverybody who just talks about it, you have to have -- first of all, no children in the house. They\nblabber out --",
        "A: -- the truth, you know, th-that new aunt of mine, you know, something like that. And there\nhas to be -- there have to be extra rations.",
        "A: So you have to -- the butcher, have grocer, a doctor -- something like that, and it\u2019s a vast ho --\nthe smaller the cell, the better. You are not supposed to know what the other one did.",
        "A: I found out rather late about the Scholls in Munich. Munich was a planet away.",
        "A: There was nothing in the media, and that was -- it was, you know, that\u2019s -- of course it -- word\ngot around, but Berlin and Dahlem, and with these five families were wonderful, we were never\nfound out. Nobody was found out.",
        "A: Yes, The White Rose, yes, yes. Cause th-the surviving sister came to visit Martin often after\nthe war, after he -- when I was there in Wiesbaden.",
        "A: They were true heroes.",
        "A: Those were true heroes. While the resistance group that concentrated, it must have been in 38\n- \u00b039, planning to get rid of Adolf Hitler, the 20\" of July \u201944 group.",
        "A: You know how Hitler -- tha -- I don\u2019t know how many there -- SS nation attempts there were\nagainst Hitler, it\u2019s almost, you know -- several dozen, and they all failed. Hitler had, first of all,\nhad the instinct of an animal. And my -- and a distant uncle of mine von Gasthof, he was a major\nin the army, and was supposed to receive Hitler rather late for -- 40\u2019s, to visit a museum, that\nZeughaus, the military museum in Berlin, and had stuffed himself with bombs, and he would --\nwas ready to embrace Hitler in a deadly embrace. Hitler sh -- used another entry, and my uncle\nhad a hell of a time disarming himself.",
        "A: But it happened again, and again --",
        "A: -- and again. And so then na -- by 1941 we started with the Jews, or na -- \u201940 - \u00b041 - 42, then\ncame these many evenings in our house where visitors came at night, among them our neighbor\nAdmiral Canaris. General Oster, Count Henkel von Donnersmark, my two f -- cousins, Haeften,\nUlrich von Hassel. And they came at night, and my ma -- the first time they came, I asked my\nmother what are they doing? And she said, \u201cSie morden.\u201d \u201cThey are committing murder.\u201d And\nthen they would leave one by one, back of the house, and all that. The only one who survived\nwas the Count Henkel von Donnersmark. And I saw him many times after the war, all the others\nwere --",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, for two reasons. First of all, I should get away from Ditte, my twin at heart, and I\nshould meet girls from my own s -- from my own caste. And that was a b-boarding -- elite\nboarding school, small, for daughters of -- for the noble names. There were three girls there who\nwere not members of nobility, and they g-got to hear it every day. That really wasn\u2019t fitting, you\nknow, not [indecipherable]",

        "A: W-We were two -- we had a terrible influence on one another, you know, that\u2019s why. But it\nwas a friendship that wouldn\u2019t break to this day. And -- and then the other reason was that the\nsituation with the BDM or the Hitler Youth was getting more precarious every day. So that was\nthe beginning of a phase, you know, when I went to that school, later to other schools, where I\ntrained myself -- or I s -- I thought of it myself. When asked, are you in the BDM, I said, \u201cOf\ncourse, in Berlin.\u201d\u201d You know, I mean, I\u2019m here only temporarily, why should I -- you know. And\nI did th -- I repeated that and it worked until shortly before graduation, they wouldn\u2019t let me\ngraduate.",

        "A: So he forced the part, that Stuttgart Declaration. But the most important sentences were\nstricken. The church said we should ask forgiveness because they had not prayed enough, and\nnot done enough. And he said -- Martin said, bullshit. Excuse me. They did nothing.

But as a group they arranged themselves, only to claim after the war that they hadn\u2019t\nprayed enough. Hah! But you know, Martin was a thorn in their flesh from the f -- moment one\nto his death. Before his death he said into movie cameras, television cameras, \u201cAnd if I did not\nreceive my pension from the church, I would become a Quaker.\u201d He wasn\u2019t at the hierarchy, oh\nthat bugged him.

        "A: And later when I ma -- ma -- I married Martin Niemoeller, he urged me to study about it\nmore, and gave me books.

        "A: And -- and after my father -- 1t was -- must have been around that time that we stopped being\n-- being part of that circle hiding Jews because the Gestapo -- and they always come\nunannounced, were searching the house all the time, and nobody was served by that. So, through\na man I met on a train -- and my instinct always told me he\u2019s okay, or she\u2019s okay, or not, I found\nentry into a very interesting group of resisters in Dahlem who specialized in forging papers,\nforging money, and the whole thing. And ha -- hiding people, or sending then into hiding,\nGerman army deserters, Jews, whoever came to their door, they were taken care of. And that all\ntook place in the gardener\u2019s house, adjacent to Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s beautiful villa, which reminded\none of Hitler\u2019s Berkoff. It was probably built with B-Berkoff in mind. I never saw the lady, she\nwas out filming on th -- all through the war. But she had just been married to a German officer\nby the name of Jarkop, he was a major. And he popped up once in awhile, so we had to be very,\nvery careful. And I remember going there once, there was the so-called caretaker, with his so-\ncalled wife. They weren\u2019t married, you know, but they gained, somehow, Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s\ntrust, and were taking care -- you know, with all the bombing, care of the house and garden, and\nvery fast through this -- this man, Hans Andres was his name, and he was a funny existence. He\nwas very much anti-Nazi, and -- but he was dealing on the black market, I think, and black\nmarket meant money, money, money. And money was always needed. And in the cellar of that\nhouse there were machine -- first of all there was an arsenal of weapons. And then there was a\nmoney forging machine, and a money printing machine and -- and paper forging machine, and\nall that, and they -- they took me into that, you know, into their trust, they knew they could, and\nthe s -- as soon as somebody had come, and there were -- usually they were received in the\nkitchen, and got something to eat and to drink. And with the slightest noise that was not\nexpected, there was an opening in the floor through which you could go down in the cellar. They\nwere quickly pushed down, and the carpet o-over them. And one day I was there, the caretaker,\nPowell and I were there. Powell was wearing an apron, green gardener\u2019s apron when there was a\nknock at the door. God, what is it now? There were two deserters in the kitchen. Down with the\ndeserters. It was Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s dear husband. And Powell said to me, \u201cKeep him out of the\nkitchen.\u201d And he pushed me -- bu -- bu -- bu -- made me drag him into the bedroom, you know. I\nwas red -- not ready, but prepared for anything. And -- and he would -- and Powell said, \u201cYou\nknow, we\u2019ve just wiped the floor of the kitchen, just will -- if you give us a minute.\u201d So I went\ninto the little bedroom with him. An extremely stupid looking man by the way, and -- and then\nhe just wanted to see if everything was in order. Oh yes, of course, Herr Major, of course Herr\nMajor. At that time I didn\u2019t know yet who he was. There hadn\u2019t been time, you know, was just\nsomebody. And then he came into the kitchen, looked around, everything seemed fine,\neverything had been pushed into drawers, and -- and bottles into the closets and all that. And\nthen he said -- and the car was -- staff car was waiting for him, and he said now he -- he had to\ngo back to the front. The front was probably 10 miles away, or 20 miles away. And then Powell\ntold me, \u201cYou know who that was? That was Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s husband.\u201d And that was the\nclosest call I\u2019ve --",
        "A: -- that I remember. And Hans was the one who furnished all of us with a weapon. That\nweapon, a little Ortgiess [indecipherable] that saved my life and shot an SS man.",
        "A: I got that from Hans. Because -- I write in my book it\u2019s -- was my father\u2019s --",

And so it was agreed that by the first of October, I would start there. And I said to myself,\nno, I\u2019m not going to do that. And one day I opened a newspaper, and in the -- were few\nnewspapers at [indecipherable] time because of the paper shortage.

        "A: Yeah, I -- before I was thrown so many times. Well, anyway, w-we -- and you know, training\na horse from scratch is a very, very taxing thing.",

        "A: He stood there, his trousers in -- in shreds, and one arm was paralyzed and all that, but he was\nexpecting Mussolini that same afternoon, visiting him, and he made it. He was bereft of his\nspeech for awhile, but he again -- and he made it by the time that -- that we were home, I was -- I\nwas outside of Berlin at the estate of a friend of mine, made it back to Berlin. And at my --\nshortly after midnight we turned on the radio and there was Hitler speaking.",
        "A: Oh yes --",
        "A: That was the trouble. Too many people knew, too many people knew.",
        "A: And I remember the day before I went to the countryside, be-before -- it must have been on\nthe 15\" of July, I took a walk with my father in the neighborhood and from a lantern right close\nto our house, hung a German soldier. I was not worth dying for the fuhrer, you know. And my ha\n-- my father had been let out of the -- Hitler\u2019s prison. He was -- wait a mo -- no, no, no, no, no,\nno, no, wrong, wrong, wrong.",
        "A: We are now \u00b044.",
        "A: Yes, of course. And -- and we -- an-and by this -- by the church my father stood, took me by\nthe shoulders and he said, \u201cSomething is going to happen.\u201d And it\u2019ll happen tomorrow, whatever\nit was. \u201cWe have to do it, and it will -- it will not work. It will not -- I have a feeling,\u201d he said, \u201cit\nwill not work.\u201d As Alan -- keep for -- no, forget. Anyway, he said, \u201cIt will not work, but we have\nto show that some people cared.\u201d And I knew then that he did not count himself above this err --\namong the survivors. And he said, \u201cWhen all is over, I want you to seek your luck under another\nstar. You -- and for you and your children.\u201d And I\u2019ve never forgotten that, he want --",
        "A: That was the only time he said that to me.",
        "A: Yeah. And we went home arv -- you know, and then they -- there came f -- my father left for\nthe Mackensan\u2019s, and I -- I was visiting my cousin Ilse, I came back and -- after it happened, and\nthe next day at six o\u2019clock in the morning the Gestapo came and searched the house. And my fa -",
        "A: My mother is there.",
        "A: My mother is there, but I tell you something now that shows -- demonstrates the naivet\u00e9 of th\n-- all the plotters. They were not trained mur-murderers, they were gentlemen, you know? And\non my father\u2019s desk -- oh, you\u2019re father\u2019s absent. Yes, he is with so and so, you know. On my\nfather\u2019s d-desk is a little piece of paper and on it is a telephone number. And the Gestapo man\ntakes it, and says, \u201c\u201cWhose number 1s that?\u201d My mother said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You know? And --\nand she snatches it away from him. And then he -- she tries the number, or allegedly that\nnumber, it was a different number, and she said, \u201cI can\u2019t get through.\u201d And she says, \u201cYou know,\ngive it to me, I'll try from the upstairs phone.\u201d And upstairs she manages -- it was pencil written,\nto erase two of the numbers and falsify them. The number was that of Goerdeler, who was going\nto be the head of the new government. And they never found out.",
        "A: That was my mother. Typical. Well, anyway, that was --",
        "A: Oh --",
        "A: -- she was smart too, and cunning.",
        "A: Cunning, yes, and --",
        "A: -- they never even took my mother in for -- for an interrogation, they took me.",
        "A: Oh yes, because I was -- not so much because I was my father\u2019s daughter, but because I was\nmu -- Werner\u2019s cousin.",
        "A: But you know, I made them believe that I -- Werner and I were lovers, which was not too far\nfrom the truth, but -- we had fallen in love as a matter of fact. And -- and sh -- you know, I -- I\ndon\u2019t know -- know about that, we made love, we da-da da-da. And they -- and, you know, my\nfather had trained me, he had said, when you get into the hands of the Gestapo, only answer with\nyes or no. And when they get friendly, then beware.",
        "A: Then beware, yeah. And they got very friendly. And I played stupid, and -- and during the\nsecond interrogation, the Gestapo man by the name of Wipper, [indecipherable] Wipper -- we\nnever found him after the war. He called another man in because he wouldn\u2019t hit anybody and\nthat one let me have it.",
        "A: He hit me in the face with his -- with -- he had a -- a bo -- twice the size. And I was bleeding\nlike a -- like a -- how does one bleed?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. He didn\u2019t even ask any question anyway, he just let me have it to prepare me for\nthe next session, you know. And then -- but then they let me go. And on the way downstairs,\ncowering on a -- in a -- ina chair, I saw a beautiful girl, classmate from Eberswalde, who was le\n-- the legitimate bride of my f -- my -- my cousin Werner von Haften. He was a big one with\nwomen, you know? And she to this day, acts like his widow. I\u2019ve never told her that he and I\nwere a bit attracted to one another. And she is the only one of the family, that family, who never\nmarried. Well, anyway, I went home, and --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: I -- Lonly said I only know him personally. I\u2019ve not the faintest idea.",
        "A: And then, you know, on the 23\", they came for my father. It was a Saturday or a Sunday. And\nthen they came [indecipherable] sie holen [indecipherable]",

        "A: But I found the brute again, right after the war.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I reported him to the British.",
        "A: Yes, he was arrested, he got a few years, I believe, and then he died, unfortunately. Was a\nunbelievable story.",
        "A: As far as I understood, they were going to kill him, and when he was gone, getting rid of all\nthe others would be child\u2019s play. Maybe it would have been, you know? But that was the main\ngoal, to get him out of the picture.",
        "A: The head of the snake.",
        "A: Was the Nazi.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, it -- it -- they all had different motives. Some of them were true anti-Nazis from the\nbeginning on, joining the army when they were forced to, you know, because what else could\nyou do but die, and if you died your whole family was gone, probably. And others went along,\nbecause they thought maybe it\u2019s the right thing to do. And yet others, they really, they waited\nuntil it was clear the war was lost. So they are -- they -- they joined -- and among those who died\na miserable death on the -- on the -- th-th-the piano wire, was a German general, who -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\ndocumented what he said, quite late, maybe \u00b042 - 43, he said, \u201cWell, you can think about Hitler\nwhat you want. The only good thing is that he rid us of the Jews.\u201d There were those people, too.\nSo there were not -- and the major -- the minor -- the -- the -- the real from the heart resistors\nwere in the minority.",
        "A: Absolutely --",
        "A: -- absolutely.",

Every year they have\nceremonies and ji -- th-the f -- on the 55\" -- no, 0 -- 0 -- in -- in si -- \u201894 I went and the guest of\nhonor was Simon Wiesenthal, uh-huh. And that was wonderful meeting him. He was thin, so\nfragile and little. And now he\u2019s still alive, having lost his wife.",
        "A: Yeah. No, I don\u2019t have much in common with the -- with the people of the 20\" of July, just a\nfew ma -- family members. Course the family has tremendously grown and intermarried, you\nknow.",
        "A: One of conscience.",
        "A: Absolutely, one of conscience.",

        "A: My father is not home at that point.",
        "A: The f -- the -- the -- two days after the -- was probably on the 22\" that they got me.",
        "A: And my father came home if I am correct, while I was at the Gestapo because he saw how I\nlooked. Now, I went twice --",
        "A: -- that was the 21\u2018 and the 22\u2122, and on the 23 they came and got him.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. It was all documented, you know, by -- they didn\u2019t think much of secrets. Like\nthe -- that is German, b -- Germanic, because the -- the -- if -- if they had not been so -- so\nthorough we would never know about how many people di -- were killed in Auschwitz, and so --\nit had to be -- all had to ha -- have order.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, one -- one after the other. And we -- of course, we didn\u2019t know then by what brutal\nmeans they were being killed.",
        "A: And then he had -- he disappeared, nobody could find him.",
        "A: I went from one pr --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I really -- all in all it was 5,500 people. I do not remember, I really -- how -- the means by\nwhich we were informed. I think it was probably the BBC.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, and with most of the people Hitler took his time. He put them on\ntrial, trial, you know?",
        "A: Only the first four were -- were -- were shot. Albrecht, Stauffenberg, Merzenkronheim, and\nmy cousin.",
        "A: Werner.",
        "A: Yeah, Werner was shot.",
        "A: Well, not e -- just 30.",
        "A: Yeah. But like all the Brauchitsch, he had -- his mother was a Brauchitsch, you know, they --\nhe looked very, very young. Young and soft, but he wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: He was determined, also determined to sacrifice his life without thinking.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. The Gestapo -- with the Jews they might have been brutal, not with people\nlike, you know, in this case.",
        "A: No, they were very -- they were very matter of fact, polite. He could take a toothbrush, or a tis\n-- a little -- pack a little something. And then he went between them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah well, he did -- you know, you di -- didn\u2019t know how many people were watching in the\nStreet.",
        "A: But ah -- no.",
        "A: He goes down the block, across the -- a-a-around the corner, they wouldn\u2019t -- they wouldn\u2019t\npark in front of the house. And there he s -- he is seated between two SS men in the back, that\u2019s\nwas -- and one in the front, and the driver. And the driver turns around and says, \u201cOh my God,\nHerr Baron.\u201d It was the taxi driver who always took him to the station when he went to Holland.",
        "A: No, he had been inducted, you know, there were no taxis.",
        "A: No, he had been inducted.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, he -- during the brief hours that I s -- I saw him, yeah. Yes, of course.",
        "A: You know he -- when -- his release was -- well anyway, he was gone, he was -- he had\ndisappeared, and I went then already in the -- in the -- in the cavalry and before, went from\nprison to prison, dolled up to the teeth, you know, high heels and -- I was quite -- quite pretty\nthen. And I went in and I just -- what was my excuse? Oh yes, I was told my father was here. So\nth -- the idiotic guards let me in and I was wa -- these hallways of the Lehrter strasse prison, that\nwas the military prison.",
        "A: I went f -- yeah. No, never heard of him, must be an error. I said, \u201cOh well, [indecipherable |\nis all mine, and all that.\u201d And the last prison Lehrter strasse drei, I w -- I standing in the hall, a\ndoor opens of -- an office door opens and out comes a dashing SS man, black uniform. And I just\nstood there, and I see a blackboard with the most illustrous names, and I see my father\u2019s name.\nThat was a list of the -- big, you know, in big le -- white letters. And then I re -- when he came\nback he said what could he do for me, and I said, \u201cI -- I know my father\u2019s here,\u201d and I da da da\nda, and, \u201cCan I see him?\u201d \u201cNo, you have to -- you have to -- you -- well, si -- fill certain forms\nand you -- and -- and maybe,\u201d -- and I got home and at least we knew where he was. So my\nmother somehow arranged -- and I do not know how it was possible. The first time we went to\nbring him things. A down -- a featherbed, I remember that.",
        "A: Cause it was -- yeah, a feather blanket, very light. And the most important things were the\nthermos bottles filled with real coffee. In the SS they made a sport out of it, accepting it from\nyou and then dropping it. Which was so terrible, you know, but it -- nothing happened. My\nmother and I, we went -- we were led in -- we were told we were not allowed to use the Hitler\nsalute. Terrible punishment. People like us, you know.",
        "A: Yeah that -- we were --",
        "A: -- we were crushed.",
        "A: And th -- we went in and on the benches there sat also wives, mothers, you know, and -- but\nwe -- if we recognized anybody we didn\u2019t let g -- let n -- let anybody know. So we sat and\nwaited, and from time to time, the-there was a little booth with a black SS man behind it, who\nwould call out names. And a woman would get up with her little package, spend some time there,\ngive the package, and then leave. It was our turn and my mother and I went to the window and\nthere was a man looking like Satan himself. Really, a bit like Adolf Eichmann. Black, piercing\neyes and he took the thermos bottle, examined everything and said, quite politely, well that was -\n- that was it, and then on our -- we -- we turned around and then he called me back. Oh God,\nwhat have I done now? And he said -- he didn\u2019t even lift his eyes to mine, he went on writing,\nand he said, there now in that position, \u201cDo you have -- could you -- do you think you -- next\ntime you come you have some more bread, or anything to eat?\u201d And I -- I went speechless, and\nhe said, \u201cYou know, I have many prisoners here who don\u2019t have relatives.\u201d That was\nOberscharfthrer Knuth.",
        "A: K-n-u-t-h. And oh -- h-he was -- he was the t-turncoat too, you know? He realized at some\npoint in his career that he\u2019d joined the wrong party. He did a wonderful thing, and by the way the\nNazi, th -- his own colleagues took care of him, he didn\u2019t survive the war.",
        "A: Was found out. But our friend, to be the minis -- social mi-minister of s -- Teodor Haubach,\nhe was a Socialist. Dr. Haubach, a lawyer. He was -- he was also in Lehrter strasse. He had been\ncondemned to death and he was -- they had to carry him on a stretcher to his execution, can you\nimagine? And his -- his fianc\u00e9 had received -- had received -- which we did not, permission to\nsee him at Christmas, visit him in the -- in -- in the -- in the prison. And she went -- the way that\nI just described to you, to that window, and Knuth, you know, with a face like that, he said,\n\u201cWait a little, wait a little, until I\u2019m rid of all the people here.\u201d And then he turned to her and he\nsaid -- urged her ga -- s-summoned her into his office, and there was a little office behind, and\nthere was a Christmas tree, a burning -- with burning candles, and there was Teodor Haubach.\nHe had arranged a farewell meeting for the two. Can you imagine that? Must have been very\nemotional. And then he was hanged. But much emotion involved in that.",
        "A: Id -- I never saw my father. My mo -- ba -- a -- to -- to gi -- to deliver things.",
        "A: I could -- no. My -- my mother only, saw him.",
        "A: Oh he -- yeah, yeah, she -- he looked terrible, and of course, while you were waiting there, for\neducational reasons they dragged by prisoners at has -- had just been tortured, or led to torture.\nYeah, that was the way. And then one day it must have -- it was on Good Friday, 19 -- oh no, it\nwas -- it\u2019s still March, and I was released from the -- from the cavalry because I had double\npneumonia -- no, wa -- pleurisy -- pleurisy. And spent time at home with -- I\u2019m glad. You know,\nit was a good idea to be with my mother, and my mother had tried to free -- get my father freed\nby Kaltenbrunner. Kaltenbrunner was a darling. And he had not received her. And then one day\nshe tried it again, sh -- that woman went into -- in Berlin, to Kaltenbrunner\u2019s office, and -- and\ndecided not to leave until she had seen him. And she came back, she was, you know, finished.\nShe said that he -- when she walked into Kaltenbrunner, who decided to see her, office -- he was\none of the worst -- he didn\u2019t even get up to greet her, and let her stand. And she said, \u201cMy\nhusband 1s a -- you know, the last survivor of four brothers.\u201d And so on. \u201cHad nothing to do\nwith,\u201d da da da. And then he re -- she -- sh -- he said nothing, and then he -- she went -- she went\nhome. And then on Good Friday, beginning of April it must have been, I was home when a\ntelephone came -- telephone call came to the house, we still at the beginning of April, had a\nworking telephone. Still it went into the middle of the -- of the month. And on the phone was my\nfather, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m free. Come and get me.\u201d And we decided -- I said, \u201cShould I pick you\nup from the prison?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no, no, no, on the S-bahn station,\u201d you know, the suburban\nstation, on the S-bahn station, and I -- I don\u2019t know, I must have flown on angel\u2019s wings, because\nth -- ow -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the subway, the buses, if they came, they came very, very\nseldom, but I -- somehow I made it and running up the steps to the -- the -- to the up -- upper\nplatform. And I was mobbed with people, I couldn\u2019t find my father, because that figure that\nstretched out his arms to me had nothing in common with my father. He was -- had a gray face,\nhe was completely bloated -- he had a very slender face -- completely bloated from the -- you\nknow, from hunger, edema. He looked terrible and we sank into each other\u2019s arms and just cried\nand cried. And behind my father, there was a touching sight, was a young SS man, 16, inducted\ninto the SS of course, and had tears streaming down his face because of that sight. And then my\nfather noticed that he had left his blanket behind. That was a -- you know, precious in those days.\nSo the young man ran back t -- and then came back with it.",
        "A: With the blanket, and then we somehow made it home, and sl -- you know, slept in the cellar\nand then -- it was -- it was the -- until -- it was the 23 of April then, on the -- in the afternoon.",
        "A: July til April.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And that\u2019s -- you know, if he had not been in such a terrible condition, he would\nhave had a better chance to survive what was coming to him.",
        "A: With the horse --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: September, you know?",
        "A: After the first of September, when they closed the theaters, and I was w --",
        "A: -- nobody was allowed to do nothing. And I was then -- in January I came down with\npneumon -- pleurisy, and in March they released me, and that\u2019s when I went home. And I got a\nlittle better, but never completely better, you know, and then we\u2019re talking about the end of\nApril, my father is home. And -- and just he was home not more than five days maybe, three,\nfive days, I don\u2019t remember. And on the 23\", you know, I said I would like to go f -- yeah, that\nwas the reason. Potsdam had been bombed, something nobody ever expected. And in Potsdam\nwas my old grandmother, my father\u2019s mother. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go on a bicycle and see if\nGrandma is still alive.\u201d And I took the bicycle, steel helmet on, of course my -- parts of my\nuniform, thank God, you know. And my ortkeys. And somehow made it to Potsdam on a bicy --\na bicycle. The other reason why I went was I wanted to see how my -- my horse, you know, she\nwas already mine, how she w -- wa -- w-what happened to them, because the unit that had been\nstationed in Baseco, east of Berlin, had been stationed -- had been moved to Potsdam.",
        "A: So the Russians had been in Baseco a long time ago. And I found my grandmother alive, and\nI found her -- her dis -- dip -- her com -- her apartment undisturbed. Her maid, Marta was there.\nAnd I could tell my grandmother that her son, her last remaining son was alive. And then I left\nand made my way north of Potsdam. There were so many corpses right, left, and center, and\ncadavers from horses. And I made it to the barracks where the cavalry unit was now stationed.\nAnd I fell into the commanders arms and he says, \u201cYou can\u2019t go back to Berlin, they just blew\nup all the bridges, and we are moving out. We are moving west.\u201d So I --",
        "A: -- I -- on the [indecipherable] at the head of the whole troop -- behind us were the Russians,\neach leading two horses, and they walked on that trip. And we had to go -- the temple that the --\nthat the Russians were able to go, you know? Because we didn\u2019t lose one to lose one man or one\n-- or one -- or one horse. And my two favorite Russians, Fjodur and -- and Pawlik, they were\nwalking right behind me, and I was on the horse, and the commander, and the major and we\nwalked -- we walked west. Was -- it was a night already. And the second night I fell asleep on a\nhorse. And I woke up, had I not worn the steel helmet on my -- I would have cracked open like a\ncoconut. On -- and I remember seeing --",
        "A: -- Pawlik\u2019s eyes, you know, he picked me up and he said, \u201cKaput, kaput, nichts kaput, nichts\nkaput.\u201d And then he lifted me up on the horse again.",
        "A: Nobody else could.",
        "A: Yeah. Nobody else could, and then we finally were met by the American 82\" Airborne after\nwhat -- 12 nights.",
        "A: Do I consider it as a -- ha! It was wonderful. I\u2019d known all about the 82\" Airborne.",

        "A: -- I was -- well, the only one in my family who was never scared was my mother because she\nhad the second sight, whatever you call that, nothing\u2019s going to happen. Nothing is going to\nhappen to the house. While my father and I, and later on Liyala, we were scared to death by the\nbombs. And you know, it was like resurrection, surviving a -- a raid. And fo -- wa -- you know, I\nwas br-brought up to praise the bombers, you know, who put our -- and to -- I saw that city die\ninch by inch.",
        "A: It was terribly sad, but it had to be. But you know, I was liberated by the Americans, and the\nRussians came and there was -- one of the famous meetings on the Elbe, cause that -- that\u2019s\nwhere we were, between the Russians and the -- there was only one meeting. After that there\nwere no more friendly meetings. That was it. I mean some of the G.I.\u2019s almost died of the\nconsume of alcohol, you know. They weren\u2019t used to that, but that was fraternization, and I was\nbe -- left behind and th -- with the Russians, and was -- and was liberated, saved by young -- a\nyoung American officer. I know his name but I told him since he had a -- his rencontre with a --\nwith the army later, and received a -- not for that, for other things he did, received a dishonorable\ndischarge, which to this day follows him. Could not remain in the army, but he became a famous\nlawyer, and after 40 years I found that he has a practice in Florida. So we were reunited again.\nYeah, and then I -- the British came and then --",
        "A: Wonderful.",
        "A: It was wonderful. I was in that village, I was hired by the Americans right away to be an\ninterpreter.",
        "A: Which meant that I was -- could be disturbed any day of -- any time, night and day. And you\nknow, they\u2019ve -- the famous, the most famous thing tha -- things they found things, I\u2019m saying,\npeople that are found, were hiding SS men. And some of them were already half beaten to death\nby the population or by -- by their victims. So it was -- there was never a dull moment.",
        "A: It was very chaotic, but very v -- very nice.",
        "A: Very nice.",
        "A: It was terrible.",
        "A: It was unbelievable --",
        "A: -- because we saw them passed when we -- when we moved along these two -- 12 nights,\nwhat we passed, these -- these thousands and thousands of refugees, falling, and then attacked by\nthe low flying planes --",
        "A: -- and falling into the -- by the side of the road. How many identification I took, you know --",
        "A: -- can\u2019t even tell you. Yeah, and on the way, before we were liberated, the last day before --\nbefore we met with the Americans, we -- we collected our tri -- train, and ready to move on, and\nthe officers, the -- the veteran, he was in the rank of a major, and I don\u2019t remember his name, and\nthe colonel and I, we were waiting for all the others to come close so we could move on. When\nthe SS man came with a -- an SS man came with a -- on a motorcycle, and he said -- asked for\nidentification and he told us we had no business going west, we should go east and defend\nBerlin. Fine, great. So without a word, it was only a glance we exchanged, the vet -- the\nveterinarian -- the veterinarian, a thin blonde man, and I wi -- drew at the same time the pistols,\nand we shot at the same time. And he just sl -- slowly was sloping over his bike, and we still\nheard the engine going when -- while we moved away. Yeah, we killed him. I don\u2019t know which\nbullet killed him, but I don\u2019t [indecipherable] my shot.",

        "A: And hopefully the only one.",
        "A: Yeah. I have one other person that I probab -- I caused the death of another person, probably\nof a Russian prisoner. My friend Pawlik, and -- you know, that we took along. He was such a\nbeautiful little human being, he was -- looked like 16, you know, with -- with al -- infected eyes,\nand sometimes he was crying, and I said, \u201cPawlik, what is 1t?\u201d And he said we have such a one --\nin his halting German, he could speak a little German -- bad, bad man in our outfit, he is a\ncommissar, a commissar. And he is giving them hell for being on friendly terms with the\nGermans. And that\u2019s when I went to inspect that -- that camp, and was pointed out the\ncommissar, and the next day he was gone. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. But Powell, and\nFjodur, and all the others were very relieved. But you know, Powell never made it home, you\nknow what happened to the -- to the -- to the Soviet prisoners. The British, they were -- they\nmade it safely into American hands and then were handed back to the Soviet --",

        "A: No, no, no, no, no.",

        "A: -- we -- w-we agreed in the family we wouldn\u2019t talk about it.",

        "A: -- they had taken him from in front of the house where he was sweeping the sidewalk. A truck\ncame by and collected all the men, you know, and only one came back from [indecipherable] and\nthat was our neighbor who had been in the party and was well fed and younger. And my\nmother\u2019s --",
        "A: Nazi.",
        "A: Yeah. Across the street.",
        "A: The neighbor across the street.",
        "A: Probably, but there are various theories about that. In the -- on the truck was an old friend of\nmy father who said, \u201cI told the Russians to drive by your house. I\u2019ve lost all my documents and\nnow they came to -- to arrest me, and only you can tell them who I am.\u201d And my father said, \u201cOf\ncourse, I'll come with you.\u201d And my mother at the last moment said, \u201cHere is -- it might be a\ncold evening, take a jacket.\u201d And that was the last we ever saw of him.",

        "A: Yes. We were all taught to fear November.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: My father had disappeared, dissolved in thin air, so to say, and there were -- was a rumor here\nand a rumor there, and there were little pieces of paper found in the mailbox telling us that he is\nalive, but not where and -- and all that. We are talking between the end of April and -- and --\nwell, until he died on the 12\" of November. What month it was I do not remember. Oh yes, it\nmust have been after April 1946. I had gone over the green border, so to say, on the first of\nJanuary 1945, to see where my mother was, you know, how things were in Berlin. But there\nwere no official documents that -- that would allow you to pass from one zone to the other. So I\nleft my horse in Hasseldorf with my family there, friends, and boarded a train and somehow,\nfastened by -- by something to the -- what do you call these things between trains, you know, I\nmean there were --",
        "A: -- were no room on the train.",
        "A: Ice cold, they had -- had to hack me loose in -- in -- in Berlin, I arrived there. And somehow I\nremember h -- the happiness when I saw American soldiers on the subway, it was great. But I\nknew that our house was still there. So I -- I kind of ran home, and there w-was my mother, very\nthin, very much alone. I mean, she had a house full of refugees, of course, and in good spirits as I\n-- you know, of -- always collected, calm and collected. And then -- yeah. Then I\u2019d stay -- I\nstayed until -- until the first us -- beginning of April, 40 -- \u201946, April \u201946. I decided to go back to\nHasseldorf, see how my horse 1s, and ra -- I worked for the Norddeutscher radio station as an\nannouncer and I wanted to go back to my job, and how was it -- yeah, there was no way to get\nback, either. And so I smuggled myself into a refugee camp, even got food rations there, I\nremember. And somehow th -- there was a train, like cattle cars, like the ones, you know, that\nwere used to ship the Jews away. Cattle cars, maybe twen -- 10 - 20 cattle cars. And right smack\nin the middle was one car reserved for the British -- a re-regular car -- a car reserved for the\nBritish who would accompany the train and tried to -- would try to protect us against the Russian\nsoldiers. And at the -- at the checkpoint, I conversed with one. He said, \u201cYou speak English,\nyou'll be our interpreter.\u201d And so I was very glad. I was allowed to travel in the -- 1 -- I put my\nthings in the -- in a -- in a -- 1n the cattle ca -- in the cattle car, and in the next one that was the\nBritish car, oh, I got a beautiful meal and beer, and whatever. And whatever my services were --\nwere demanded, I did it. I did it, and you know, g-going a stretch that nowadays by car would\ntake from Berlin two and a half hours, then took 24. 20 f -- more, or more. I v -- know we left in\nthe afternoon at three and were there the next morning at seven. So, 12 - 13 - 14- 15 - 16. And\nthey s -- the sergeant, Atkinson was his name, Sergeant Atkinson told me that before the border\ndividing the Russian zone from the British zone, I should get out of the British car because the\nRussian soldiers would come and inspect the British car and they did not like German citizens\nmingling with the British, meaning a -- I would go into the -- into the car in front of us and\npretend to be one of the -- well, I was one of the people. And then he would give me a sign with\nhis -- with his flashlight that I would come back. And so, go there and the -- the Russian guards\ncome in and they read the -- they -- they read the documents upside down, you know, most of\nthem couldn\u2019t read it, other than Cyrillic, if they could at all. And everyth -- they went out and\nthe train begins to go into motion again. And I look, standing by the open door, that were not\nsealed, fortunately, I see a signal from the other car. Aha, this is my signal and so Ij -- clad with\nthick under, you know, pullovers, and a sheep coat, I jump down and I find no bottom and I fall\nand fall in spirals, and finally the water of the river closes over me, in freezing temperatures.\nThere were no -- you know, the -- the -- the -- the -- the tracks were all damaged, and what\nSergeant atkin -- Atkinson had -- had tried to do was warn me of that, but I had, you know, the\noriginal message had been -- and I was the -- it was the very, very shallow river, but I came up\nagain like a cork, and saw the -- the train was halted, it was standing, and I saw the -- all the\nBritish soldiers coming to rescue me. And they -- they -- they had to wade into the water and pull\nme out. And I had a gigantic -- it\u2019s still to see here, the bump on my forehead. I had bump --",
        "A: Well, the -- the -- the next second I would have been pulled down again, you know?",
        "A: I -- I popped up and they d -- they -- and then something happened which -- of which I was\nhav -- half -- you know, I was half conscious. And they pulled all the clothes from me, stark\nnaked and -- and -- and wrapped me into army blankets and put me on a stretcher there, or a\nbunk bed or whatever it was. And I was -- I was in a very elated mood, you know? And captain -\n- no, it wasn\u2019t a captain -- he sat next to me and after about four hours I went into shock. And\nthat was it, I started screaming and crying and having fits. And he knew how to handle this. He\ntook my hand and kept talking to me about his family in England, northern England. He was an\nelectrician, I believe, or a plumber, and his children and everything, and by the time we reached\nHannover about 10 hours later or eight hours later, I had developed an eye like this, you know?",
        "A: I looked terrible, and everything was dry except the fur coat, that took an extra two weeks.\nAnd on the platform stood the man I would -- was -- who was responsible for me in my job,\nCaptain -- Major Clark. Major Clark a Scotsman from Scotland. And he t-took one look at me\nand started laughing like hell, singing black eyed Susan. I was not amused. And he took me to\nthe British army hospital in Hannover, they x-rayed me and I had a concussion, of course, and\nother than that, I survived it. And I had very little to wear, I\u2019ve -- I stayed in the castle with a --\nwith the princely family of the Schoenaich-Carolath, where my horse was, and I re -- was allow -\n- course I had to rest for awhile, and Sergeant Atkinson gave me the promise of what -- he went\nback to Berlin, he would visit my mother and tell her that I\u2019m all right. And then he took another\nfour weeks or so, I remember it must have been May or June that he came back, carrying a big\nsuit, I was -- I -- he came with a Jeep, carrying a big suitcase that was for me, with clothes.\nClothes, you know, I didn\u2019t even know what clothes were, I only had those riding boots. And he\nsaid -- I took him to the park, it was a beautiful day, and he was so in awe by all the -- the -- the\nroyal highnesses and -- and wh-whatever. We went to the park and he said, \u201cI have very bad\nnews for you. Your father is dead.\u201d And then he spilled out the story that had just gotten to the\nears of my mother, over a year after -- after my father had been taken away, what had happened\nto him. So that\u2019s how we found out, and later my si -- my brother would find out that this -- this\nfamous actor, Berlin\u2019s you know, he was the manager of the Staatstheater, Gustaf Griindgens,\nhad been acco -- a friend of my -- had been there when my father was -- died. And I\u2019m s -- was\ndied. And I am so grateful the two had each other, because they -- they had a lot to -- to talk\nabout. And he told the story, but he -- very reluctantly because the Russians had released him\nunder the provision that he would never talk what happened to him in the -- in the ca -- in the\ncamp.",
        "A: So he broke the promise. He died shortly after, but a natural death, so that\u2019s it.",
        "A: That\u2019s how we found out.",
        "A: Well we -- we gave up all, then we had to go -- gave -- give up all hope.",
        "A: We had, really.",
        "A: We really had. But now we had confirmation, and --",
        "A: -- closure.",
        "A: You know, closure. And the -- this actor, Gustaf Griindgens, after my father died, saw to it\npersonally, together with other prisoners, that my father, who was very much respected -- my\nfather had turned politically much more to the left than anybody would have thought. You know,\nhe would have wound up a social democrat, you know, and not a rightist any more. Rightist, no\nhe was never a rightist, but the si -- the Nazis were rightists. And he was highly respected and to\nthis day I get do -- not to this day, for years I got messages from hi -- how wonderful he was, and\nhow well he behaved, and well anyway, he saw to it that my father was not thrown into a mass\ngrave, but has a single grave in Jamlitz, somewhere. I mean if I was to inspect a thousand skulls\nthere, I would have found my father\u2019s because of the shrapnel wound in the first World War.",
        "A: But we never tried, we never, you know --",
        "A: -- they dug up corpses there and they gave it up. What\u2019s the use?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well.",
        "A: My brother, I was at the Hasseldorf castle when one morning while I was asleep, the door\nopens, the princess stands there and said, \u201c\u201cSSomebody to see you.\u201d That was my little brother, you\nknow. And he worked on the farm then, you know, before he went back to Berlin, and in Berlin\nhe eventually was one of the founders of the Frei University.",
        "A: Yes, yes, because the Humboldt University, he was not the son of a laborer, refused him.",
        "A: And everybody else who was not a laborer\u2019s son. And then he founded the univ -- the\nuniversity, became a lawyer.",
        "A: Oh yes, frequently, then I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve moved back to Berlin. I moved ba --",
        "A: I -- oh, I married -- not for awhile.",
        "A: Not for awhile. I -- I was, you know, still under the illusion that after the war, things will be\nall different. The Nazis will be dealt with and all the anti-Nazis would come up and rule the\ncountry, you know? It didn\u2019t quite happen that way, the Nazis had it good, and those de-Nazi\nvacation trials, I beg your pardon, you know. Were nothing but a farce. So I went to work in\nBerlin, in a famous organization, it was of course ba -- instituted by the Americans, by the CIA.\nThe Fighting League Against Inhumanity. And I was one of the first people there, and then they\nsomehow did things that the Americans di -- I didn\u2019t like either, and then I -- but I -- I\ninterviewed, interrogated more people than you can shake a stick at. You know, refugees.\nClearing them -- are they political, or are they not? None were sent back but the ones who could\nprove they were political prisoners, they left for political reasons, that their lives were\nendangered, they received extra help from the Americans. Taken by plane from West Germany\nand so on. That was the time when they came by the thousands before the -- the wall was built.",
        "A: You had to -- you had to use your judgment and I have a very good instinct. I could tell by the\nway a man entered a room.",
        "A: But once -- I describe it in my book. A man -- a gentleman, middle aged, enters the room, sits\ndown and tells me his real name. Doktor Reckzeh [indecipherable]. Doktor Reckzeh was\nresponsible, he was a Nazi spy, was responsible for the death of at least 30 people, a terrible\ndeath, because he had attended the famous Thadden tea party. A woman by the name of Fraiilein\nFron Thadden, who was the headmistress of a famous girl\u2019s school, had invited people who then\nwas living in Berlin, had invited people for a tea party and independent of each other, al -- my\nmother almost went, and the Countess [indecipherable] almost went. Both held back, you know,\nby something that could not be explained. And guest of the party and the only man was a very\nnice young man by the name -- he was a medical doctor, and he was allowed free access to and\nfrom Switzerland and people who wanted to give him messages should do it, he would gladly\ntake them. And he wasn\u2019t Gestapo spy and he denounced all of them. And Fratilein Fron\nThadden at a ripe old age, was beheaded. And -- and many -- all the -- all the -- all the people\nwere -- were hanged. And I -- right away I registered, I knew who that man was, even maybe my\nface gave me away, I don\u2019t know. And we talked, and then I -- excuse me, as I said, \u201cI have to go\nthe next room, just one moment.\u201d And I said to the pers -- \u201cCall the police, call the police right\naway.\u201d And by the time I came back, he was gone.",
        "A: And he went back into the Russian zone, where he wa -- they gave him a wonderful life,\nanyway, I don\u2019t know why he ever wanted to leave. He was a doctor and had a beautiful home\nwith a sky high wall around it, and I never knew what happened to him. He reported his own\ndaughter to the Russians for being anti-Communist. Yeah, nice guy. Yeah, I missed that boat.",
        "A: Oh yeah. And then, you know, the leader of the place was Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt. He was\nterribly naive, too. And of course we had all the Communist spy we could meet in our office, so\nwe sent our spies into the cowan -- the Communist side. And then I left and then I -- I decided\nwith the Nazi time, and I say it in these words, something wonderful had broken with the end of\nthe war. The ti -- feeling of togetherness with all the people who were against the regime.\nCatholic, Protestant, Jewish, Communist, monarchy, didn\u2019t matter. They -- for the moment of the\nend, each went in his own separate direction again. And that would never, ever be the same\nagain. That I really missed. Everybody missed it.",

And they had been\ndragged to Theresien -- Terezin, and they had been -- had survived Terezin and went to America,\nthen ba -- went back to Berlin, and she had her son from her first marriage, who was then chief\nof staff of the children\u2019s hospital in -- in Detroit, Michigan. He came to visit and he said, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you come to the United States?\u201d Ah, that was the moment when I woke up in the mor --\nmor -- morning and said to myself, \u201cI\u2019m going to the States.\u201d\u201d And my -- my little ba -- I had\nalready been divorced, and my little boy was not well.

Yes, but -- and I went to the -- the manager, Dr. Rainer\nHildebrandt, I said to him, \u201cHow can you do that?\u201d He said, \u201cHe knows how to put up a new file\nsystem and all that, isn\u2019t that great? Good-bye.\u201d And I was furious with him, but actually there\nwas a reason why the Americans, together with Willy Brandt, they decided to dissolve that\ngroup, but that was long after I had gone. But while I was there it was interesting.",

No, I\u2019ve never really given it any -- ma -- my husband, you know, who accepted the\nLenin o -- oden -- and stuff like that, he said, I am accepting declarations from anyone if it for --\nis -- 1s -- if it\u2019s for the sake of peace. But he would never cease to speak his mind when the\nRussian delegation, th-the -- the -- and then east German delegation came to the house, the talk\nwas -- of course I kept my -- my mouth shut, h-he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m a -- Germany -- West\nGermany is only a colony of the Americans.\u201d And my husband, you know, shook his head and\nsaid, \u201cYeah, just like East Germany is a colony of the Soviets.\u201d",

        "A: I had ma -- relationships because people interest me.",
        "A: [had relationships with many completely different people on different levels. I have -- and I\ncan say that -- not with pride, but with humility, I\u2019ve been loved by great men, and I\u2019ve loved\ngreat men. I\u2019ve never -- in all my life, I\u2019ve really never been out of love to this day.",
        "A: Not yet.",
        "A: Not y -- oh, no, no, I was -- I have that position, but I had a small apartment on Blist, 25 West\n95\"\" Street. And I shared the floor, were two apartments, with a Jewish student from -- from\nIsrael.",
        "A: Leah. And Leah taught me the first things about Judaism. And all the time I was in New\nYork, aside from [indecipherable] I had a feeling I\u2019d been there before. When I went to the\nJewish qua -- the Jewish quarters, which was about to be dissolved really, in Lower East Side,\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s my people, that\u2019s my youth. It was very strange. And you know later,\nwhen I had to learn Hebrew -- you have to learn Hebrew in order to convert, and it came so easy\nto me. You know the Sh\u2019ema Israel, within the two days I knew it by heart.",
        "A: I was never uncomfortable with Jews, never. Of course, I mean, I was always overprotective\nof Jews, you know? My father, you know, I remember, when -- if the word Jew fell at the table, I\nsaw him, his ears going up. Can we help? Should we help? Where? When? And so on.",

And I see the elevators\nstop, knowing he was as punctual as I am, you know, and going down. It comes to me finally, w-\nw-w -- will he recognize me? Will -- wh-what will I say, how will I call him, you know. And the\ndoor opens and there stands, with a world wide, you know, smile, this beautiful old man with\nwhi -- snow white hair, brown face. I always said to him, \u201cDon\u2019t stay in the su -- in the sun too\nlong, or in the south they\u2019 put you in the back of the bus.\u201d You know, because he was getting so\n-- so tanned.

And he was full of vigor and he\ntook me to lunch, and it was beautiful lunch. First of all, 1t was Hitler\u2019s birthday.",

        "A: And he was so needy for -- for love, for a loving partner. You know, Hitler knew exactly what\nhe did to him when he put him in solitary. He wouldn\u2019t have suffered had he been with others.\nBut having it -- he was used to sharing every thought with somebody he cared for, who cared for\nhim. And he couldn\u2019t do that for so many years, that was --",
        "A: -- that was brutal. Of course, Elsa was -- Elsa\u2019s attitude was that of the pe -- women of the\ngeneration above me. There was no talking back, and when there were -- was -- pr -- his -- hi --\nher way of protesting was to sit in a corner and cry. While I -- I viciously attacked him.",
        "A: You know? And that\u2019s what he loved. That\u2019s what he loved. He had these famous, infamous\ntemper tantrums. They would flare up and he would insult you, whatever, and it was over. And\nhe expected the other one to forget that right away, you know. Person couldn\u2019t, all the time.",
        "A: And that was right after my son had moved in with us.

        "A: I -- something in me must have se -- there must be some sense in our meeting, you know,\nbecause he was so -- he was so alone. He had so many women, he -- he was very attractive for\nwomen, I can tell you that. But 1-it -- he said the key word for me, you know, when I visited him\nonce in Wiesbaden, took me out to a beautiful dinner, and I had asked him, I said -- he had asked\nme to call him Martin, which I found extremely difficult.",
        "A: Pastor Niemoeller, of course. I said, \u201cHow come that you have stayed single now for so many\nyears?\u201d And soon as I said that I said to myself, I shouldn\u2019t have asked that question. And he just\nsmiled, and once we were out of the -- out of the restaurant, the hotel and walking, the snow was\nfalling, it was like in a fairy tale. Was only November. And he stopped and looked at me; he\nlooked so cute. And he said, you asked me a question, and because, you know, I\u2019m a ver -- I\u2019m --\nand Elie Wiesel says the same thing. I\u2019m very, very shy. So he would never have done the first\nstep. He had legions of women adoring him. So I took that, and I kissed him. And that was it.",

        "A: Absolutely.",

        "A: And -- yes, and be -- being seated in a restaurant, when the waiter asked what his daughter\nwanted, was me, you know, he would kick me under the table. Was very wise of him to marry a\nwoman that much younger. He would have died. During our marriage he would have died many\ntimes for neglecting himself and his -- his -- his health, you know? He would not go to bed when\nhe should --",

        "A: I never moved back.",
        "A: Physically no, because I knew I was coming to a very Americanized town, Wiesbaden. The\nAir Force headquarters was still there, the hospital was there. And all through my years in\nWiesbaden, I have not made one German friend.",
        "A: No, because as Martin\u2019s wife, that was -- he didn\u2019t have friends either. He had people who\neither loved him or despised him. And on his own level there was nobody, so he took all my\nfriends in. The entire staff of the hospital came Sunday after church for instance, for a drink and\na cigar. And he -- Martin\u2019s -- Martin\u2019s English was flawless.",

        "A: And I went to the door, and I sh -- screamed up, \u201cMarc, come down, come down, you have to\nsee that.\u201d And he was not even -- his father was not even aware of it. So Marc came down and\nwe start laughing in the back you -- the tears were coming from our eyes. We were going down\nto the -- on the floor, and all of a sudden there was complete quiet and after he stopped howling,\nhe turned around and saw us --",
        "A: -- dissolved in laughter and tears. And what does the man do? He starts laughing with us. He -\n- that was typical, typical. Once his sister was there when I had allegedly insulted him.

        "A: -- oh by the way your daughter died. Which one? I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] don\u2019t care,\neither. And then after a few days that must have been hell, he always hoped, he says, that it\nwould be Ut\u00e9 because he had a guilty conscience towards the other children because he showed\nhis preference to Ut\u00e9 all the time. She was an angel, she really was.",

        "A: And all the children who are fair, they realized that without me he would have died.",

        "A: And I count myself among those survivors, having not been able to talk for 40 years. Four\nzero years. If Elie hadn\u2019t kvetched that out of me, you know, I would be quiet to this day. He had\nworked it through over the years. He was at peace with himself about it. He only -- people, some\npeople would ask him, was it really so bad? And he would have one stereotype answer, he would\nsay, \u201cNo, it was a thousand times worse.\u201d And that\u2019s all he -- all he said, he would never -- he\u2019d\ncut you off very briefly.

        "A: -- and that was done by many.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: But then he -- he realized the full impact of his own anti-Semitism only after the war, of\ncourse.",
        "A: No, he had a -- something happened to him when he, for the first time as a free man, with\nElsa, visited Dachau concentration camp.",
        "A: Wanted to show her, you know, and the American officer.",
        "A: Because they kept the camp.",
        "A: And the only block that was standing, as a prison for their own G.I.\u2019s, you know, for all sorts\nof things, from murder to black market. And he finds himself standing in front of the crematoria,\nand so the crude sign, you know, board of s-something, on which it said, here so and so many\ninmates were killed between 1933 and 1945. And there, he says -- and he -- I -- I can quote him,\nI don\u2019t know if I can do it now by heart, verbatim, he said, \u201cIt wa -- like a cold chill came da --\nwent up my spine. I heard God\u2019s voice saying to me,\u201d -- wa -- well, you know, he said, \u201cI knew I\nhad an alibi between 1933 -- between 1937 and 1945. But here God was asking me, where were\nyou between 1933 and 1937, and I had no answer. Cain, where is your brother Abel?\u201d And that\u2019s\nwhen he fully realized that he bore the same amount of responsibility, eight years of\nconcentration camp or not. He was -- and when people accuse him now of anti-Semitism, you\nknow, they\u2019re running into open doors. He admitted it publicly again and again.",
        "A: I know.",
        "A: Right, it\u2019s easy to say, yeah. And never stopped asking God\u2019s forgiveness.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, he went to Israel only once when I was --",
        "A: -- when I was there. He was what -- I heard from conversations with the ambassadors, and so\nI know that he was very pleased.",
        "A: Really, quite frankly, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well, he never considered himself a theologian.",
        "A: You know?",
        "A: Yeah. I know.",

        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: No, no. And I really don\u2019t know, but considering him, he would always raise his voice when\npeople called him a theologian. He had, you know, walls of books, theology books that he never\nread, didn\u2019t interest him. He was a pastor in this world to spread the message of Jesus. And that\u2019s\nwhat he would not ever understand about me turning to Judaism.",
        "A: He would -- but I could not -- I -- I -- I wouldn\u2019t have done a -- I couldn\u2019t have done\notherwise, you know? Tr -- my -- my connection with Jesus is still the same, only he was a Jew,\nhe was a pious Jew. And -- but the -- our faith, we are divided by Christians faith in him, and the\nJews, the faith of him. His faith, you know? So he was not, you know wh-when -- when\nChristians nowadays, so -- so-called Christians say, still talking about the Holocaust, isn\u2019t it time\nthat we moved on, you know? And they have all sorts of marvelous [indecipherable]. First of all,\nwho would put closure? Who 1s there?",

That\u2019s how the Catholic church especially,\ngets their people. If you suffer here, it means that you\u2019ll have a glorious whatever.",
        "A: That is -- oh well, more or less, yes. The hereafter is very, very important. While we Jews, we\nlive for this life. And what -- not what we think, but what we do is important. And that went very\nwell with me.",

        "A: -- as I said, I\u2019m being led by a higher power all the way, so He must have something in mind.\nNot she, but He.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s not -- it doesn\u2019t really matter. I belong to a conservative --",

        "A: Oh yes --",
        "A: -- at the progressive, as they call it. Liberal, as they call it in England. But I had to, in -- in\norder to be converted in England as a liberal, I had to go to the Mikvah.",
        "A: Which I did in New York. Which I loved by the way.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It is, you know, sa -- it\u2019s so meaningful.",
        "A: We have to change?\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "A: She did not take it very well. First of all she said, \u201cHe\u2019s much too old for you.\u201d And then she\nsaid, \u201cHe\u2019s much too old for you.\u201d And then she came out with the truth, that years before -- and\nI even knew that, she had mentioned it at the time, when Elsa was forlorn and -- and -- and -- and\nalways when she was very depressed about her husband\u2019s absence when he was in the camp,\nDorha, the housekeeper, the one who was called -- was killed with her in that car crash; Elsa and\nDorha were killed together. Dorha would call my mother and said, \u201cWould you please come\nover? Frau Niemoeller is so depressed, she wants to see you.\u201d So my mother raced over there,\nsitting at her bedside, or whatever it was, and then, you know, after she complained, she did her\nbit of complaining, she said, \u201cYou know, if your husband,\u201d my father, \u201csomehow gets killed\nduring the you know, one way or the other, and I die, and my husband is still alive and you are\nstill alive, you\u2019ve got to marry him. I am not strong enough to be married to him.\u201d And my\nmother to -- obviously took that very seriously. But then we were being as graceful, as gracious\nas she was, she arranged herself with the given situation, and they became very close and dear\nfriends.",
        "A: Yes. It was almost touching to see those two, so close in age, together.",
        "A: She was born in August, and they were separated by -- by four months, Martin was like\nAlbert Schweitzer, born on the 14\u201c of January.",
        "A: She was living in Berlin. And h-had a massive stroke at age -- well, she was 80, she was\nabout my age, and -- which robbed her of her speech and use of her right arm and right leg, and I\nwas called to Berlin, somebody else took care of -- of my husband in Wiesbaden. I drove to\nBerlin, and the doctor took me aside and said, \u201cFrau Niemoeller, have no illusions, this clock has\nrun out.\u201d And I said, \u201cDoktor, you don\u2019t know my mother,\u201d you know? And my mother lived for\nmore than 12 years, regained her speech, use of her right arm, she could walk with a little limp.",
        "A: But she was there and all with it. So you se -- it\u2019s very dangerous for a medical man to make\nprognosis of a person --",
        "A: -- he doesn\u2019t know, and my mother was a bundle of energy.",
        "A: Yes, for the reason that she got older and more helpless, of course. But there is not a day that\ngoes by that I don\u2019t -- the I re -- really regret for not having had a relationship with my -- with\nmy mother. But my brother didn\u2019t have one either, in the end, you know.",
        "A: No, no. She just -- but I realized it long before my -- my brother did, I think, that she was not\nto blame, that was the way she was made, that she had been educated. She lived in fear of men,\nand to -- she was not allowed, and she couldn\u2019t partake in discussions.",
        "A: She hadn\u2019t been brought up in -- you know, and Elsa was -- no, she -- Elsa was a -- a teacher\nof English, so she knew more. But in our circles a woman was raised as a girl to be married off.\nMarried off.",

        "A: -- bananas, yeah, yeah. No, she was very proud of being his mother-in-law, you know.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: And I never even imagined it. I only know he would have been hurt that I left the Messiah.\nJesus was his reason for surviving, you know? And it started early, when he was 14, he had a -- a\nhappening that when his father, who was a -- I remember my own -- my own father-in-law and\nmy mother-in-law, I met them when I was very little. And his father very much believed in\nsomething that pastors, or sometimes even rabbis don\u2019t do any more, visiting members of the\ncongregation and getting to know them. And his fa -- and whi -- pastor -- old Pastor Heinrich\nNiemoeller was exemplary. Every afternoon he\u2019d go and see somebody. And he visited th -- the\nhome of a miner. This was where he -- this was a mining district where they lived. And on the\nwall -- and the miner is -- is eaten up by some dreadful lung disease and on the wall Martin sees\nsome words under glass in German, \u201cWaswurde Jesus sagen?\u201d What would Jesus say? So this\nword guided him through all his life. Whatever he did, he would ask first, what would Jesus say\nto that? And how I could miss out on it because he would -- he would suspect a terrible void in\nme, what wasn\u2019t there, you know? I don\u2019t know how.",
        "A: No. It was -- would have been beyond him.",
        "A: There is no [indecipherable] first of all, I do not -- I follow my mentors, Albert Friedlander\u2019s,\nand London\u2019s advice not to ever get in argument with Christians about it because I would soon\nnotice that I was being maneuvered into a corner where I have to defend myself. So when I\u2019m\nasked in a -- in a -- by the -- a member of the audie -- now tell us about the -- I said, \u201cI don\u2019t\ndiscuss that in public.\u201d But I will in a s-smaller and preferably Jewish circle. But the funny thing\nis that Martin\u2019s successor in office, Doktor Spengler, Jewish president of the Church of Hessen\nand Nassau, I didn\u2019t have to explain anything to him about the co-conversion. He called me one\nday, and he said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard you converted to Judaism.\u201d He said, \u201cI think it\u2019s marvelous.\u201d",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, that is part of it, I am sure, I am sure. Because what was destroyed by Hitler, who was\nalmost -- I mean he -- he almost managed to -- to get rid of all the Jews in Europe, must have\nbeen so powerful that he felt it and he feared it. And that\u2019s why I had to find out what that 1s, you\nknow? Power has always attracted me, and Judaism is a very powerful religion. But not alien to\nme, but it\u2019s now part of me.",
        "A: Yeah. Always -- ever since I became Jewish, I consider myself religious. I go not only\nbecause I -- I read the -- the Torah regularly and -- and the prayer book.

        "A: I can guess, of course. How old does my mother look? 14?",
        "A: Yeah, then it was taken in 1900 and I would say -- does it say anything on the back, or\nnothing?",
