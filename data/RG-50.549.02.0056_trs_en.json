        "Q: We t -- we -- we talk about the change of the name a little later on --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: -- since this is sort of the official introduction. And now that we know who is\ntalking to us, I would like to begin with liberation. How was liberation for you, when\nwas it, and -- and what kind of state of mind were you?",
        "A: Circumstances, okay. Well, I was in the labor came and one day my older friend\napproached me and said, Cornell, next morning when the train pulls out from the\nstation, you and I are staying, and we going to hide someplace. We are not leaving\nwith this train. Cause the train was going on and on and on of course. And, of course,\nmy -- my closest friends were my age, see, he was a little bit older, maybe wiser, and\nhe had certain ideas, you see. So next day as the train was ready to pull out, and that\nwas in hunga -- Hungary, of course, he -- the train started to move and I had sort of,\nyou know my younger friends, they were all going up on a train and I was ready to\nmove on the train and he grabbed -- fortunately he grabbed my arm, he says, we\u2019re\nstaying. And we didn\u2019t stay. And the train pulled out, and then we hit the road, and\nwe walked on the highway. And after awhile we got off the highway, because it was\ndangerous, you know, trucks were coming with Hungarian soldiers, and maybe\nGerman soldiers, we didn\u2019t want to stay on the highway, too obvious. So we moved\noff the highway and about maybe quarter of a mile, half a mile, and there was some\nwater there, and some little river, and we just sat down there and was waiting for the\ndark. We\u2019re thinking what\u2019s going to happen now, see? Actually it was -- well, it was\nHungary in no -- ru -- th-that -- it was Romania, Romania at that time, yeah, because\nit was always back and forth Hungary and Romania and back and forth. And before it\ngot dark, some Hungarian soldiers stopped on the highway and came towards the\nriver. So we got sort of a little bit scared, but then you have to act cool, right? And as\nthey were getting closer and closer, we got up and we waved to them.\n[indecipherable] come over here, here is the river, see? Came over, sa -- and they\ncame over and then one of them asked us, he says, what are you doing? We says, ah,\nwe got late -- we got off the train -- w-we missed the train, we\u2019re waiting. Oh. They\ndidn\u2019t make a big issue out of 1t, we\u2019re lucky. Then they left. Later it became dark. A\nRomanian farmer came across the river and he said he is willing to hide us. So all\nright. Actually it was four of us, yeah, this older guy, me and two other guys\n[indecipherable]. So, we accepted, what choice do you have, right? So we went -- he\ntook us to his little farm and we went upstairs in his barn and we were hiding there.\nWe were hiding for a few days and suddenly we hear guns, guns, guns, Russian guns\ngetting closer and closer. We had food, we fed us potatoes, we\u2019re not hungry, had\nwater and everything. And -- and then he came -- one evening he cames over and he\nsaid the Russians are next door in the next village, but they celebrating. So, d -- you\nknow, how long are they gonna celebrate? But two days later they came, the Russians\nand the Romanians. First thing is a Romanian soldier I remember, first thing he did,\nhe took my watch. So wa -- so I asked him, I says -- some -- somewhat we\nconversed, you know. I said, why are you taking my watch? He says, I have to give it\nto the Russians. [indecipherable] okay. The next Romanian took my shoes, which I\ndidn't mind because it had nails from inside, you know? So he gave me his shoes. I\nthink it was a good trade. Anyway, so then we -- no, says, well let\u2019s start an -- let\u2019s\nstart walking. Walking the -- th-the aim, the goal was to reach his hometown in\nHungary, which was probably hundred miles from there, roughly. So we\u2019re walking,\nmaybe we get some rides. So we walked on the highway, see? And so the Russian\nCossacks on horses on the highway, shooting apple off the trees, and all that. And\nthen came a Russian -- Russian soldiers, you know, on -- on -- on trucks, they\nstopped, and they asked us, they said what -- who are you? Says, well we are, you\nknow, we were in labor camps. Th-Th -- actually didn\u2019t know exactly what you are\ntalking about, this -- they didn\u2019t know. What do they know? So it\u2019s -- one\n[indecipherable] ask who -- who -- where you from? I says, I am from Yugoslavia.\nHe says, wh-wh-why aren\u2019t you fighting with the partisans? [indecipherable] going to\nexplain it. But anyway -- and I spoke Russian, fortunately. That was another thing by\nthe way, my f -- my -- my f -- older friend was smart too, he knew with me -- he was\ngoing need the Russian language. So he was not stupid. So I spoke Russian. Okay, so\noh, oh, all right, fine, fine. And a Jewish officer, Russian officer came over and was\ntalking to me, so, are you Jewish? I say yes. He says, okay, I am too, he says, but be\nquiet, don\u2019t tell the Russian soldier that I\u2019m -- they don\u2019t know that I am Jewish.\nInteresting. I don\u2019t recall now if that truck, or we -- I think we took a ride with them,\nthey took us for a few miles, 20 - 30 - 40 miles, then we got off again. Well,\neventually, in about two days, we got into his hometown. His wife was there, of\ncourse, his wife was a Gentile. He was also half Jewish like I was, I didn't mention\nthat. His wife was Gentile, of course. And in his hometown, there\u2019s absolutely no\nsign or war. There was no sign of war, it was peace. Food like in the peacetime.\nDuck, geese, anything, it was just [indecipherable]. So we s -- I's -- the two guys and\nmyself, we staying by their house, and we stayed with them, of course. The name of\nthe city was Bekes-Gyula. It was about maybe 60 miles from Budapest --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- 60 - 70 miles from Budapest. We stayed there. I did not know at that time if my\nparents are okay -- they lived in Budapest, see? And I had a brother who was in Borr,\nBorr was a famous camp, you probably heard about it, the copper mines, you know,\nand they took from Hungary, these kids to Borr in \u201944. Later I -- somehow I found\nout through somebody who came from Budapest that my parents are alive, but my\nbrother died, he was killed in Borr. He was murdered in Borr. Later, after the war,\nmy cousin went to Borr by the way and recovered his body and brought his body\nback to Novi Sad, to my hometown, where he was buried. Now, the idea was to get\nto Budapest, but Budapest was not liberated yet, that time, well, they were still\nfighting for Budapest. And then I got a job as an interpreter with -- in a Russian h-\nhospital. The commander was Jewish, by the way. We became sort of friends.",
        "Q: That was in Budapest?",
        "A: In -- no, that was still in -- in Bekes-Gyula.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: In Bekes-Gyula, and [indecipherable] of course, from Budapest gets liberated\nright away, we\u2019ll go to Budapest. Sure enough, we went to Budapest with him, with\nthe Russian commander, and arrived in Budapest -- 1t was unbelievable, of course.\nPeople starving on the streets, coming over to the truck, begging for food, will give\nyou anything. Gold rings, whatever you have, for a loaf of bread. Was pathetic. And\nthe city looked, of course, terrible. It was just a day after liberation, still t -- heard\nshootings and everything. And now the idea was to find my parents. Well, I knew\nwhere they lived, see, because I lived in an apartment too, before I went to labor\ncamp. So that was no problem to find them. So we -- we drove over there, with the\ntruck. And my mother opened the door. She didn't know I was coming, of course, she\nopened the door, and she saw me, it was unbelievable, you know, like ah. She didn\u2019t\nknow the circumstances. And then -- course we talked about my brother and\neverything, and they were in good shape, they were lucky, and then -- of course we\ninvited -- the Russian commander stayed there 1n the apartment, he s -- he lived there.\nWe -- I don\u2019t know how long I will stay, but I was very lucky. I remember one day in\nBudapest, I was walking down the street, and came these Russian soldiers,\nsurrounded a whole block and took every man, every man from that block, they took\ninto a backyard, into a big backyard, a schoolyard or something. I did not like the\nidea, I knew there is something wrong here, something is going to happen. So I said,\nI better work fast here. So I found a soldier in the group there, and I told him, hey, do\nme a favor. Go over to this place -- I gave him my mother\u2019s address -- find my\ncommander, and tell him to come over here immediately, I need him. I was very,\nvery lucky, cause the Russians were unreliable, very unreliable people. Big liars and\nunreliable. Now, first of all, he has to find the place. He\u2019s not a Hungarian, you\nknow? I just give him an address. Then, he has to go, to begin with. And then he has\n-- and then he has to find the commander in the house and bring him over here,\nbecause this is a matter of time now, right. He did go. He did bring the commander,\nand the commander came in. I told him what the story is -- well, he knew, so he\ntalked to the commander in the yard and told him, this is -- I need this man, he is my\ninterpreter. I need him, you have to release him. Okay, that\u2019s it. He saved me. I don\u2019t\nhave to tell you what happened to the rest of the people. Russia. Took them to\nRussia. Many of them probably died. Matter of fact, not in that group, but I know my\nfather\u2019s -- one of his good friends from Yugoslavia originally, who was in a German\nconcentration camp, and who came back liberated from ra -- from Germany, was\ncaught in one of these Russian affairs, you know, taken to Russia and died in Russia.\nTerrible. I --",
        "Q: W-We should probably add that your mother was a Gentile and then stayed in\nBudapest for --",
        "A: Yeah, of course, that\u2019s why -- exactly, that\u2019s why how could -- she could stay\nbecause she was Gentile, and she lived in this apartment house, and the -- the land --\nnot the landlord, the -- the -- ha -- the keep -- not e -- the manager of the house was\nalso, of course, Gentile and he told the soldiers when the soldiers came a few times,\nwho are these people, he said, this is Mrs. Loen -- Lowenberg at that time, of course,\nand she\u2019s a Gentile person, you know, she was [indecipherable] the name, her father\nwas actually German, the mother was Hungarian. Of course, my mother did convert,\nyou know, but they didn\u2019t know that, originally. And then she had the opportunity to\nsave a lot of Jewish people from this apartment house. They were moved, before, to\nanother apartment house, downtown Budapest and my mother used to take food\nthere. Yeah, she ta-take them -- took them food, let her in, you know, and one time\none of the guards I think was objecting and so forth, and what she said, you have to\nlet me in because these people owe me money. Something like that, you know, sh-\nshe\u2019s smart. And -- and she has -- I don\u2019t know if Masha mentioned it to you 1n j -- in\nJerusalem she has a plaque, you know, and sh -- okay.",
        "Q: Yes, she did mention it, but we should talk a little bit more about it later on\nbecause there was also a celebration in Los Angeles, I understand [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah, big one with George Putnam.",
        "Q: Yeah [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, she said that?",
        "Q: She said that",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- I would like you to say that a little later when we --",
        "A: Yeah, okay --",
        "Q: -- when we get to that topic.",
        "A: Okay. So anyway -- so then, a wa -- as I say, I was lucky, he saved me. Then I\nwent back to -- I was going back and forth from this Bekes-Gyula, you know, where I\nlived with my friend, because th -- I lived there, actually. I didn't move right away\nback to Budapest. And we used to do some funny business, we went to Romania\nfrom Hungary and smuggled certain things. Like one time we smuggled a carload of\nsugar, and the Romanians mixed it with salt, so we had to throw the whole thing --\nthat reminded me, Stalin -- Stalin said once, he says, Romanians are not a nation,\nthey\u2019re a profession. It\u2019s true. Was very, very disgusting, but what can you do?\nAmazing. I told the story the other day to a Romanian guy about the sugar, so he said\nright away, they mixed it with salt, didn\u2019t they? So he knew. This was now, in 1999.\nSee, a Romanian. Takes a Romanian to know. But my friend, by the way, where I\nlived in -- in -- interestingly enough, I remember he had a brother who lived in\nLondon, who went to London before the war, and he was on the British Broadcasting\nCorporation, yes? His name was Haytai. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. I don\u2019t\nknow what happened to the brother. I know one thing, the brother where we lived, it\nwas very nice, and the wife was nice, but they were constantly fighting, which made\nit sort of unpleasant sometimes, you know, to live and stay and eat in a place where\nthe -- th-the host and the hostess constantly fight. The reason I don\u2019t know. But\nanyway, he was too much in business, he was a businessman and preoccupied with\nbusiness, and I think that\u2019s what she objected to. She was fairly young woman yet,\nyou know, the man comes back after, you know, so many years from a labor camp\nand then he -- 99 percent he spends in business, you know, and one percent with the\nwife. But then -- then eventually, of course, we split because I did go back to\nBudapest and -- and stayed with my parents. Now the goal at that time was\neventually to go to America where my older brother -- Masha, I\u2019m sure mentioned it\nto you, Ernest le -- came in 1938, he stayed here. So we have to get somehow out\nhere, and -- and the parents were working on it, too, but I had to leave, somehow,\nHungary and go to Austria, sort of the bridge, then from Austria to America. So I had\n[indecipherable] first to cross the border. Couldn\u2019t go it legally. So at night, with one\nof my good friends who was with me in the labor camp, he was -- by the way, I don\u2019t\nknow if I mentioned it before, that a lot of the guys were killed from -- on that train\nwhen we left -- oh, I didn\u2019t say that, yeah, where he pulled me away from the train\nand the train went on, lot of these kids were -- lot of them were murdered later in\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "Q: How do you know that?",
        "A: We knew, we found out from somebody else. Yeah, that was a fact. So that was --\nI was really lucky. Who knows what would have happened? But this -- this guy --\nthis -- this kid who le-left Hungary with me to Austria, Segeti Pauli was my best\nfriend. He also escaped the train, the same train, a few stations later. So whoever\nescaped [indecipherable] well, anyway, so at night we crossed the border, paid a few\nforints, or whatever, panguat, I don\u2019t remember the currency, and we crossed the\nborder and came to Austria. So then we went to Vienna first and then\n[indecipherable] I was to get to a displaced camp, and we knew about two displaced\ncamps in Linz, Linz on the Danube. It\u2019s between Salzburg and Vienna, about\nhalfway. And so we went to this -- that was easy when you get to a displaced camp,\nright away you register, you know. First we went to Lakeside, which was pretty lousy\nconditions, but then we went to Bindermichl. Now Bindermichl was like a -- a Hilton\nin comparison with Lakeside, right? And got a nice room, kitchen facilities. So -- he\nwas married, by the way, my friend, married. And so we stayed there, he and his wife\nand myself.",
        "Q: Before I ask you more questions about that, I would like to just ask you one m --\nother question about wartime experience. Was there a difference that you had\nbecause you were half Jewish?",
        "A: Oh, of course it was different, because ev -- first of all, we were -- well, 1-1-in -- in\nthat camp it was different because there was never a danger of being killed, you see?\nFood three times a day. I me -- not weinerschnitzel, you understand, but beans --\nbean soup, a -- but food. Coffee, everything. No problem. The commander was a\nlieutenant, nice guy, alcoholic, was drinking, you know? And just did what he had to\ndo. Were never any beatings, were never any threatening. Matter of fact, we didn\u2019t\nknow at that time what was really going on, except once, where in the very beginning\nfor instance, on weekends, I used to go back to Budapest, to my parents on\nweekends, it was so easy. And then we stopped at one station and there comes a train\nfrom Budapest, with people, you know, they were taking them to Poland in cattle\ncars. People just crying for water. So what\u2019s going on? This was the first time that we\nrealized that something -- something is going on, you see? And -- but we couldn\u2019t get\nclose to the train, they didn\u2019t let us close. But as I say, it was -- a lot of half Jews\nwere killed and murdered in Auschwitz, you know, I was just lucky that we stayed\nthere and nobody bothered to -- to -- you know, to take us anywhere. So we stayed --\na mat -- fr-from that place, by the way, then we moved, a few months later, to\nanother place that was in Romania, Gerdameshtahausa, also we were lucky, also\ncircumstances normal, we were burying Hungarian soldiers, they brought them from\nRussia, you know, and they\u2019re burying them, I remember it was one of the tasks we\ndid. And in the f-first place, we were -- we did -- we build railroad tracks, you know,\nand unloaded railroad cars, you see. And then I remember one day German troops\ncame, and I st -- I -- speaking German of course, so I spoke to one of the Germans\nand they said -- he says, today the invasion started, he told me, it\u2019s a very good\nfeeling. And I say, oh really, bah bah and da da da. But as I say, we were lucky, you\nknow, it was luck. Many, many times it was really luck, lucky circumstances that\nnothing really happened. Th --",
        "Q: So let\u2019s -- let\u2019s go to the DP camp then, the Hilton, quote unquote, where you\nstayed. What -- what did you do there? What -- what happened?",
        "A: In the -- in the camp?",
        "Q: In the camp, yeah. Well now, going back to Austria, to [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Bindermichl, Bindermichl, Bindermichl. I was -- I was\nthinking of something else, well okay, anyway, in Austria, okay, so that was in\nBindermichl, right? So in Bindermichl, nothing, black marketing, you know, no -- no\nbig things, whatever we could do. Well, I didn\u2019t do too much in that, and I was not a\n-- areal expert. Some guys made a lot of money. But any -- one day I was walking\ndown, oh, you know, in -- in the camp itself, and I saw this girl. Masha, yeah. It\u2019s a\nbeautiful girl. Said, where did she come from? She was absolutely stunning. So it\u2019s ju\n-- un-unbelievable how beautiful she is. So we started talking, you know, da da da da\nda da, talking, talking, talking, and then started going together, I invited her\n[indecipherable] to a concert, she says, what\u2019s a concert, you know, she\u2019d never been\nto a concert. She would rather go dancing, like you. But anyway, then I met her\nfather and her stepmother, because her mother was killed in the camp, of course, with\nher sisters. And so we got closer and closer, and so I says -- well, eventually we got\nmarried.",
        "Q: What did you like about her?",
        "A: Well, she was very attractive, very attr -- different personality, she looked so\ndifferent than anybody else in that camp. No, really, she was really beautiful, I -- I\nfell in love with her.",
        "Q: Describe her.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Describe her. What did she look like?",
        "A: I don\u2019t [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s crazy. And so, you know,\nshe had -- sh-she -- she -- she knew that I was -- had plans to go to America, too, and\n-- she had boyfriends, of course, before. As a matter of fact, she had a boyfriend who\nwent to Italy. And he found out later from my friends -- my friends, you know, the\none I told you I lived with, and his wife, he went to Italy and he met this guy, and this\nguy told him that he has a girlfriend in -- in Austria, and he said who? So he says,\nyou're too late. She\u2019s -- she\u2019s getting married. Funny.",
        "Q: So whe-when did you marry?",
        "A: \u00b047. 1947.Yeah, she was very young. Course, I was what, \u201947, I was 25, Masha\nwas probably, what is it, 18. 18? Yeah, I think she was 18. I think.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] 17, no?",
        "A: 17 or 18, something like that, yeah.",
        "Q: She was born in \u201930, 17.",
        "A: Yeah. Was very young, very young. But we got married 1n -- in -- in Bindermichl,\nyou know, Jewish wedding, break the glasses, everything at the end, you know?",
        "Q: Oh, did you -- were you brought up -- you were brought up in the -- in the Jewish\ntradition?",
        "A: Well yeah -- y -- really yes, that\u2019s interesting, yes. See, my father was Jewish, my\nmother was Gentile, but as I say, my moth -- mother, at one time, she converted see?\nAnd 1-it was a -- 1t was a jew -- not a religious Jewish home, you know, but tradition.\nJewish holidays we celebrated. My father\u2019s father, I mean, he was more -- you know,\nmore Jewish, but -- but we celebrated the Jewish holidays, all the Jewish holidays. So\nit was a -- it was a -- really a Jewish -- I was Bar Mitzvahed when I was, you know,\n13. So -- so was my older brother, too, and my -- my middle brother, who was killed.\nAnd [| had interestingly enough, strange but true, I had cousins in Hungary who were\nHungarians, and pro-Nazi. Well, of course, you see this is s-sad but true, pro-Nazi. I\nhad an uncle, my mother\u2019s brother, who walked in the night when the Hungarian\narmy came into bu -- to -- to -- to Novi Sad, to my town in 1942, he walked in in a\nNazi uniform. That\u2019s my brothers -- my -- my mother\u2019s brother, my Uncle Steffie,\ncomes in with a Nazi uniform, with the hackenkreuz, you know, on his left arm. He\nsays, I\u2019m sorry [indecipherable] -- he was drinking, he liked to drink. He says, I\u2019m\nsorry, but I can\u2019t help you. The reason he came. He says, I can\u2019t help you. Sad. And\nhis wife too, of course they were all brought -- and like I say, my -- my cousin in\nBudapest was in Hungarian army. We all s -- the youngsters, you know, they used to\ncome to Yugoslavia in the summertime. We were pretty well to do, you know, they\nwere sort of poor people, so they -- we brought them, you know, to Yugoslavia on\nresorts, you know, they stay there. And they were always, you know, different than\nwe were. Th-They were -- were Catholics, you know, pretty religious Catholics. So\nwe always had these political arguments, you know. And there again, they -- they\ncouldn\u2019t help us too much when was a big pogrom in Yugoslavia, in Novi Sad, you\nheard about it, in 1942, when they killed 1500 Jews in one day and everything, and\nnobody would help, nobody. You couldn\u2019t go to anybody. That\u2019s when --",
        "Q: So they didn't want to help.",
        "A: Nobody help. Th-That\u2019s when my -- my father\u2019s brother and his wife and the\ndaughter and the whole family was killed in one -- they shot and thrown in the\nDanube river. Was very, very cold day. They -- the Danube was frozen, they had to\ndig holes to shoot. And the Croatian people, the Croatians across the Danube river\nwere applauding. Nice. Very nice people, Croatians. Murderers. But anyway, like I\nsay -- Okay, so Masha and I, right, so we started corresponding and writing to\nAmerica, to my brother and getting the affidavits ready, da da da. My parents left\nEurope earlier, they left in -- yes, in \u201948, one year before we went. And bad luck. As\nit happened, my father send a lot of things in mail, Persian carpets, yeah. Nice\npaintings. A Persian carpet is the most valuable item. Everything was stolen. All the\ncrates came empty and the insurance company didn\u2019t pay a nickel because the things\nwere open. But yet that\u2019s why they said they could -- they -- he said, the things were\nstolen in Europe obviously, not during shipping. He couldn\u2019t collect a penny. That\nwas like the [indecipherable] now, you know. He didn\u2019t pursue that, he shou -- and I\ns -- and I am sure it\u2019s too late now for me to do anything about that. I don\u2019t even\nknow --",
        "Q: So he-he -- he -- they ha -- came here and had nothing?",
        "A: Noth -- and the cou -- [indecipherable] empty so they couldn\u2019t prove anything.\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t know if I could do anything about it today because I don\u2019t -\n- do not recall, now everybody died there -- died -- mother died, my brother just died\na -- seven, eight weeks ago, my older brother. So I have no idea who they arranged\nwit -- with. Could have been a German company, I don\u2019t know. But anyway, that was",
        "Q: Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s talk a little bit more about Austria. You worked for the Joint?",
        "A: Yes, the Joint Distribution Committee.",
        "Q: Could you say something?",
        "A: Yeah, I worked for the Joint for -- since 1947 to -- in \u201949, two years, in Linz, in\nLinz yeah, with -- spoke English already, some -- not as well, but pretty good. Good\nenough t-to be able to work for the Joint.",
        "Q: What did you do for them?",
        "A: Just office, you know, working in the office. Nothing, no special -- clerical work,\nmostly. You see, it was the American -- I remember one of them, what was his name,\nAntel was the first one. He was in charge and he -- I don\u2019t know, I heard some shady\nstories about him too, doing some business, you know. The next guy was Kaufman,\ncame after Antel, he\u2019s a very nice guy, Kaufman and his wife. We came very, very\nclose. As a matter of fact, he was from San Diego, and later, when we came to\nAmerica in the early 50\u2019s, we met once in San Diego with this guy, yeah, he was --\nhe was a terrific guy. But the Joint was a great organization, it was really beautiful,\nyou know? Would have been very, very hard if you wouldn\u2019t have any help or, you\nknow, support.",
        "Q: Did they approach you, or did you want to work for them?",
        "A: Oh, you know, I do -- I -- frankly I do not re -- I think I probably went there. I -- I\ncan\u2019t exactly remember the circumstances, but I -- I would say I probably went there\nand tried to, you know, get a job and I got a job. We have a lady here right now, a\ngood friend of ours, Lydia, she worked for the Joint also, in Linz.",
        "Q: How many languages d -- and which ones did you speak, by the way\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, at that time I used to speak, of course, Hungarian, which I do speak fluently\nright now. Could say that was my mother tongue in -- Hungarian. And then\nYugoslav, of course, Serbian. And German of course, I spoke as a kid. And then later\nI studied Russian in the [indecipherable] schools, you know, cause I knew eventually\nI might need it. And -- but I -- I forgot already Russian quite a bit. It\u2019s easy -- you --\nyou have to keep up languages, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very easy to forget. Very easy to\nforget. And French, I used to speak French quite well, also, no practice, you know, in\nmany, many years, you forget. It\u2019s a beautiful language.",
        "Q: Okay, before we go on, it\u2019s already time to switch the first --",
        "A: [indecipherable] time.",
        "Q: This is the end of tape one, side A, interview with Cornelius Loen and it\u2019s -- we\u2019re\nactually having a good time.",
        "A: After, yeah -- it-it\u2019s off?\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Cornelius Loen. This is tape number one, side B.",
        "A: Ah [indecipherable] here.",
        "Q: So how did -- yeah, you -- so you were about to go to America.",
        "A: Exactly. Now we are on, right?",
        "Q: Yeah, we are on.",
        "A: Okay. And -- yes, so waiting for the papers, was only a matter of time. As a matter\nof fact, Masha\u2019s parents got the Canadian papers before we got ours. Oh yeah. They -\n- they got it in \u201948, I believe, yeah, had to be \u201948, and they went to Canada, cold\ncountry. As a matter of fact, I had to lend -- my father-in-law was an excellent tailor,\nand he made me a -- a gorgeous winter coat. I had to give him my winter coat\nbecause I figured in California you don\u2019t need a winter coat, and he\u2019s was -- I gave\nhim my -- his creation back, which he appreciated, certainly. Toronto. And they did\nleave in \u201948, and we of course, stayed another full year before we got the papers in\n49. That was in July.",
        "Q: How did you live then, and how did you make your living, or how did you survive\nin that year -- during that year?",
        "A: Oh, that -- there was no question, so we got food, you know, there\u2019s food from,\nyou know, through the Joint, and s -- there were never a problem.",
        "Q: So what was --",
        "A: Never a problem.",
        "Q: -- when -- when you came to America, what was it like to see your brother again?\nYour relative --",
        "A: Oh, you don\u2019t want to hear the boat, the story on the boat and everything, not\nimportant.",
        "Q: Ah, tell me the story of the boat again, too.",
        "A: Yeah, well it\u2019s no big deal, I mean, we got this -- we boarded this ship, Royal\nEltinge was the name, it was one of those Liberty ships, you know, in Bremen, right,\nBremenhaven. And I don\u2019t know what to tell you, I got seasick right away 1n the first\nfew hours, in the channel. It was the -- one of the biggest storms. There\u2019s always a\nstorm there, but this was one of the biggest, supposedly. It was absolutely terrible.\nThose days, the boats, you know, they were not balanced as well as they are now,\nsupposedly. But anyway, it was ter -- Masha too, oh. Couldn\u2019t eat for at least one\nday. It was just terrible, terrible experience. And some people were eating and\ndrinking. It\u2019s amazing, you know, some people don\u2019t get affected by it. And that --\non the boat, of course, I was the interpreter, I remember. You know, every so on I\nhad to go on the microphone and tell the people about the situation, da da da da,\nprepare them for everything. And took about 12 to -- 12 days I believe, because we\nwent to New Orleans through New York -- it\u2019s a longer trip, and as far as\nseasickness, then it stopped and the sea was calm, no problem. Then we arrived in\nNew Orleans, was August, and received by the Joint on the pier and then they took us\nfor dinner. The first time in my life did I see white bread. You know, that so-called\nwhite bread, which we didn\u2019t see in Europe, and it looked interesting. It -- it -- it -- it\n-- | thought it was a cake, first, see? Was hard to get used to it though.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t like it?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, I didn't realize that the only way that you can eat that\nis toasted. But a lot of people do eat it, you know. Then, let\u2019s see, New Orleans, we\nmust have spent one day, maybe, one and a half days. And then, by train of course,\nwe drove to Los Angeles. First time I saw, actually, black people. Still segregated.\nOn the train, in the restaurants, which was amazing to us. But they told Masha --\nMasha -- I remember Masha -- one of the girls in the Jewish committee that told\nMasha, don\u2019t -- don\u2019t -- don\u2019t talk about it, don\u2019t pay too much attention to this, you\nknow, this -- this is just a facts -- facts of life. It was interesting, to us 1t was a very,\nvery unusual experience, in \u00b049, right?",
        "Q: Well, how did you feel about that?",
        "A: Well, it -- it was weird, it was strange, you see. We didn't see any arguments or\nfighting or anything like that, but it was still -- the restrooms, you know, colored,\nwhite, colored, white. Was sort of weird, especially after in the concentration camps,\nyou know. So -- okay, so we arrived August -- end of August, I believe, I -- in Los\nAngeles. My brother, my sister -- ex-sister-in-law, and her daughter, who was a\nyoung girl, waiting for us on the union -- Union Station, yeah, right. So we arrive, the\n[indecipherable] and we drove over to my mother\u2019s house. My mother that time --\nyeah, the moth -- the -- that time, yeah, my mother lived still with my brother in my\nbrother\u2019s house in Burbank. A real hot day, real warm day. You know, celebration,\nhi, kisses back and forth, hello. Haven\u2019t seen my -- my brother since 1937, yeah. He\nhad a -- some business going here. Masha must have mentioned it to you about the\nscooter business he had during the war, he didn't see -- during the war he had -- he\nwas not a -- unfortunately he was a real intellectual, a very bright man, very\nintelligent guy, but business sense he did not have. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s interesting how some\npeople, you know, they\u2019re just born with a sense of business, you know, they can\nmake anything out of nothing, see? He was a kind -- he was just too much of an\nintellectual, and he n -- he knew too much. Later on, of course, he became a\nmanagement consultant and he was actually doing good jobs, you know, for many,\nmany companies. But on his own, he could -- he would never succeed as a\nbusinessman. His -- his good friend, who he came with to America in 1938, he was\njust the opposite, you know? He came from a business oriented family, his father\u2019s\nown -- anyway, he went into the clothing business and eventually made a lot of\nmoney in the clothing business [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did your brother what -- what had happened? Was he 1n-informed?",
        "A: In the concentration -- you mean, in Europe? Somehow, not much. Later, you\nknow, he found out. Lot of people didn\u2019t really know. We didn't know, in -- lived in\nEurope and didn\u2019t know too much 1-1n the beginning, you see? He didn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t.\nHe heard about, of course, my brother being killed in -- in -- in -- and then whatever\nis in the papers here about the concentration camps. Radio, television, as much. So,\nthen we stayed there, I think, in their house for a few days and then we eventually\nmoved, my mom, my father and Masha and I moved to West Hollywood. West\nHollywood, Clark Street, in 1949, yeah a few -- a month later, I think, or maybe two\nweeks later we moved. Oh, it was impossible situation to live, you know, six people\nin one house, seven people. And on top of it, my late brother, as I said before, he just\ndied a few weeks ago, and was 84 years old, he was not the easiest guy to get along\nwith. A very complicated man.",
        "Q: Did your mother and -- and Masha get along that well, or your --",
        "A: Masha, Masha, yes. In the beginning it was a little bit hard, you see. They -- lot of\n-- unfortunately many times, you know, parents do not accept, oh poor little son, you\nknow, they -- ridiculous, and it was tension, tension there in the beginning, much\ntension. Matter of fact, eventually -- I don\u2019t remember how many weeks we stayed\ntogether, but eventually we had -- we moved. Not far from them, a matter of fact, few\nblocks from them, but we had to move to another apartment, Masha and I, because it\nwas just constant, just tension. And even with my brother, Masha never really got\nalong, all these years, was always -- but as I say, he was a difficult guy, he didn't get\nalong with his wife either, and with his daughter, his own daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to\nhim for 15 years at least, maybe 20 years. Later she -- just last few years, two years\nago I think she made peace. So she realized he\u2019s getting, you know, older, older,\nolder and then -- but it -- it was not easy. The beginning was not easy. But we had a\ngood time, we --",
        "Q: When you started looking for -- for -- for work, what -- did it help you that you\nspoke languages?",
        "A: Well, ha -- yes and no, no -- you know, I -- first I says, gonna get a job, I went to\nthe Roosevelt Hotel, I remember, on Hollywood Boulevard, trying to get a job, you\nknow, I speak several languages, da da da, fill out an application and nothing\nhappened eventually. Then the first job -- actually the first real job I got was in a\nmotel. Nice, huh? Fa-Fascinating job in a motel on Sunset Boulevard, East Sunset\nBoulevard, that\u2019s near Los Angeles, downtown. Night job. I can tell you, 1t was\nfascinating. I didn\u2019t realize that time that it\u2019s dangerous or not, hold-ups. But it was a\njob, I got it through a Jewish organization, as a matter of fact. A Jewish guy owned\nthat motel. As it happens, the motel is still there. It\u2019s \u201999, I saw it the other day, I\ndrive by it quite often. I don\u2019t know who owns it. I\u2019m sure not that Jewish guy\nbecause he was an old man, but it\u2019s there.",
        "Q: Were you armed in that job?",
        "A: I -- no, armed, are you kidding? Not even a knife. Nah, it\u2019s mostly guys came in\nwith girls, you know, at night, to motels. And pay was very low, pay was very low. I\ndidn't stay there too long, I believe maybe two -- two, three weeks, four weeks at\ntops. That same time Masha had a job downtown in a factory, she probably told you,\nyeah. Then after I left the motel -- trying to remember now, recollect here, what was\nmy next job? Oh yeah, my brother had the neighbor in Burbank, he -- and this 1s a\nGerman guy, Erb, Max Erb, he had a downtown Los Angeles -- scientific instruments\nhe used to sell, import from Germany, Zeiss, you know, and microscopes, and sell\nand rent to USC and UCLA, see? It was a big business, and I got a job there in the\nshipping department, I remember, in the shipping department. And I was there\nperhaps five, six months. Couldn\u2019t get along, something happened, that was it, that\nwas the end of that story. Then I joined a milk company here, Arden Farms as a\nsalesman. As a salesman I was soliciting new accounts. You know, o-opening new\naccounts for the milk company. Tho -- time -- it\u2019s still business, but tho -- those time\n-- those days, I mean, it was big business, this home delivery business. And it was a\nfairly good job, and that was a union job. That was the first time I joined the union,\nwhich was good, because I belonged to the union all my life. I worked there, it was\nan easy job, I met a few nice guys who helped me with opening accounts, you know,\nbecause they knew a lot of people on the street. That made it a lot easier, cause you\nget -- you worked on commission. Was -- was a -- basically was a salary, a basic\nsalary, which was not too much, and then whenever you opened an account, of\ncourse, you got commission for the account. So -- so Masha and I then -- we lived, as\nI say, we moved from L.A., from my parents and we had this nice little apartment,\nwhich Masha fixed up very nicely. And we had a nice life.",
        "Q: Did you want children?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t -- hm?",
        "Q: Did you want children? You personally?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t -- no, that -- that -- we didn\u2019t talk about -- we didn\u2019t think about it too\nmuch yet, in the beginning, you know\u201d? We -- we had fr -- [indecipherable] friends,\nfor instance, our first friends was a dentist who was recommended by my landlord to\nmy mother, who lived down on Clark Street, in West Hollywood. And Bestley was\nhis name, and we met them, and eventually we became very, very good friends. They\nbecame our first friends in America, American Jews. Bestley and his wife, and of\ncourse they had a family already, they have kids and they lived in Beverlywood, and\noh, he had a big job with Masha\u2019s teeth, you know, Masha had a big problem, you\nknow, after the concentration camp, and -- but as I say, we became very good friends,\nwe went to movies together and everything. And we [indecipherable] talked about is\nwhy don\u2019t you start a family, why don\u2019t you start a family? I says, ah, we got time,\nwe got time for we get better situated and a bit more money. And then eventually we\nmoved from West Hollywood to the valley. We always liked the valley somehow.\nWe moved to the valley, to a very nice apartment on Deacon Street, where we had a\ncrazy landlady who drove us nuts with keep the carpets clean, keep this clean, keep\nthat clean, you know? So we couldn\u2019t stand it, so we stayed there about two months,\nand we moved out -- same street. We moved to an apartment which this young\ncouple owned, very nice young couple who also became our friends, eventually. And\nthen I -- just about in 1954, I remember I changed jobs again, I joined this company. I\n-- it was a confectionary company, wholesale. They were making a famous Baker\nBoy confection roll, was a cinnamon roll, you know, but very -- very -- already\nestablished in Los Angeles area, and they needed some more salesman and I am --\nintroduced myself, da da da da. So I joined them, and I started working for them,\nselling this confection [indecipherable] to markets, big markets and all -- small\nmarkets, snack shops, stores, everything eventually. It was a good jo -- also a union\njob, of course. Five days, eight hours. Had a van -- their own van, of course, I used,\nyou know. And, as I say, it was a good -- good steady job, which we needed that\ntime. Masha still had her job, I don\u2019t rec -- oh no, that time she had the\n[indecipherable] shop with a partner. So the income was fair, you know.",
        "Q: Do you remember it as a difficult time for you to establish yourself all over again,\nor was it something that you didn't mind --",
        "A: No, no, it was not -- it was not difficult really. I didn't have any problems, you\nknow. Like at this job I got pretty easy and got into it very fast, smooth, no problems.\nMade friends easily [indecipherable |",
        "Q: But your first friends were not survivors, they were --",
        "A: Americans. Matter of fact, Masha pr-probably mentioned it to you that we didn\u2019t\nknow about the survivors. The only survivor we knew was the one from the ship who\ncame with -- on the same boat. And -- but I don\u2019t know why, I still don\u2019t remember\nwhy he didn\u2019t tell us that there\u2019s a lot of survivors here from Masha\u2019s hometown. But\neventually, we somehow ran into them, see, and then we knew more and more of\nthem. And a lot of them that all lived -- you see, we lived in West Hollywood, and\nmost of the Jewish immigrants that time lived in a certain section in town Boyle\nHeights, which was eventually -- or re -- n -- yeah, that\u2019s right, later became Spanish,\nLatino. But that time was strictly Jewish, and they all lived there. And we didn\u2019t\nknow, but through -- and this guy lived there also, this -- yeah, but he didn\u2019t tell us\nabout all these people. Why, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Was it important for you to talk about -- t-to ment -- did you talk about at all,\nabout your war experience, or did you -- did you not, to people?",
        "A: Well, it -- yes, yes and no, you see. Like, lot of these American people -- I\nremember the Jewish friends, the dentist, for instance, these people were -- th-that\ntime, they were all Russian sympathizers. You see, we had arguments with them. We\nhad arguments because we knew the Russians. We knew what they were, who they\nwere. They didn\u2019t. See, they didn\u2019t s -- they saw it from another perf -- perspective,\nsee? And this -- this was incredible. Later, they started realizing that we were right,\nbut it took years. Remember when the Rosenbergs were killed, you know, they were\nall [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And I meant to ask you how you felt about the McCarthy era, and the",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t -- na -- no, I didn\u2019t like -- I didn't like McCarthy at all, no, I didn\u2019t\nlike him, no, I didn't like him and then [indecipherable] and then Coen, remember\u2019?\nHe\u2019s a -- no, no. To me, I was strictly against that. Strictly, strictly against some days,\ndark days. This -- as I say -- and then, of course, I said I joined this company and I\nwas with them from 1954 to 1978. Can you believe that? Yeah. Meanwhile, David\nwas born, of course in 1958. See that -- and we moved again. We moved from one\nplace to the next place. But also in the valley, we stayed in the valley since first time\nwe moved, we stayed, and we stayed in the valley. San Fernando valley.",
        "Q: Tell me -- tell me more about David. Did you have any -- well, did you any\nparticular sort of hopes, or did you want something that you thought, in terms of\nparenting, that you wanted to do or not want to do?",
        "A: With him? For him?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Not really. Not really, not really. We didn\u2019t have any -- any plans like some\npeople have plans, you know, and th -- tries to do this and that. As far as going to\nschool later, we see -- I don\u2019t know why, just -- David was in sports very much, you\nknow, he liked sports, so -- I remember, I used to be -- I think all the friends we had,\nall the friends we had had all sons, and I don\u2019t remember ever any of their fathers\ngoing with their sons to -- to sporting events. Nat -- none. They were still -- I don\u2019t\nknow why -- I was -- I americize -- it was very, very much, you know, I became an\nAmerican very fast. A lot of our friends were still in the European mind, you know\u2019?\nThey never got accustomed to the American sports, really. That\u2019s interesting. See, I -\n- | caught on pretty fast, you know, baseball, football. And even nowadays, it\u2019s \u201999\nand I would say 90 percent of -- of -- of the friends who came from Europe, no idea\nabout baseball, or football. Interesting. They never got into it. And --",

        "A: Yeah, well sports, of course, of course [indecipherable]. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. I li -\n- I just liked -- I liked America right away, I liked the -- the people, you know. I liked\nthe -- the -- the -- the so-called liberty, you know, that you really can speak and not\nbe afraid to speak. Nobody is watching over you, nobody is following you, you\nknow, we were leaving the horrible period there, so that -- that makes also a big\ndifference, you see? Course, most people who came to America, even before, they\ncame from the terrible circumstances and mayb -- you know, also bad things\n[indecipherable]. So it\u2019s -- was very refreshing, you know? Really different --",

        "Q: Some things you critiz -- you were sort of crit -- critical about?",
        "A: The white bread. No, really. Even food, you know, you get used to the certain\nthings which you didn\u2019t have in Europe. The hamburgers, and the -- eventually, a --\nwe liked it, we liked it, we never had any problems. We never had any problems.\nNever criticized too much.",
        "Q: Did yo --",
        "A: Pretty good life.",
        "Q: Did you always agree with the strong emphasis of a Holocaust work in your\nwitfe\u2019s life, or did you have different --",
        "A: Oh no, no, no, I agree with that hundred percent. No, had -- somebody had to do\nit. Cause if you don\u2019t do it, if nobody does it, you know, it\u2019ll be forgotten. There\u2019s a\nlot of people like -- would like to forget it, see? And you have to constantly be on top\nof it, constantly. It\u2019s Ju-just something which 1s very, very important, so easy to\nforget, with this denial. This -- I -- I sto -- I still can\u2019t -- I-I can\u2019t conceive this, how\nsome people -- people, how can they deny something like this? Is it -- 1s it really --\nthat really deny -- they really believe in it, or -- or are they just acting, is it part of\nacting? I remember this case when -- I remember, if you recall this Mermestein, they\nhad a lawsuit against this American who -- you remember that case, yeah? Was\nunbelievable. How -- how this guy ever expected to win his case.",
        "Q: Say a little bit more about that though, for the listeners who may not remember it.",
        "A: Well, they -- an -- well, anyway, it was several years ago, this -- it was a guy, an\nintellectual man, you know, was not a nobody and he was not -- not a -- a -- right-\nwinger or a skinhead.

You see, sometimes he --his wife\nwas alt -- well, no, he had -- a-actually, there were some parts in the family who were\nmuch worse than he was, like my brother\u2019s wife\u2019s family. They were -- they were\nreally bad. They were really -- they were involved in the Nazi regime much, much,\nmuch deeper. He was nothing, nobody took him seriously, this -- this Steffie, not\neven the -- the Germans or the authorities, nothing. But th-these people were\ndangerous, some of those people. Later, some of them came to America after the war,\nyeah. But anyway, in \u201967, as I say, we were there, and lot of our friends were still\nalive. Dr. Fisher and I didn\u2019t meet anybody from my -- my school days, but some of -\n- some of the other ones. I remember I stayed in this hotel -- Masha never mentioned\nit to you? On the Danube River, and Masha got bitten by mosquitoes and we asked\nthe guy next day, I said -- the clerk, I said, why didn\u2019t you put screens -- screens on\nthe windows? He said, you\u2019d ruin the view. She was absolutely destroyed there\nmosquitoes, none of them bit me. See, different blood.

        "A: Well, of course, all right. Well, she knew about her -- that she has some relatives\nin Israel, but she had no idea where they live and so forth. And we -- as we arrived in\n-- we went to [indecipherable] of course, Tel Aviv, and we stopped on one corner,\nand we asked the cab driver, this -- these people live here and here? He says\n[indecipherable] live across the street. Across the street, yeah. [indecipherable]. So it\nwas actually Masha\u2019s cousins, first cousins. Tremendous reception, oh, it was\nincredible. She never seen them, you know, never -- never seen them in her life,\nnever corresponding with them. She just knew that her -- one of her aunts went to\nIsrael before the war. There was actually two of them went to Israel before the war,\ntwo sisters, and one of them was a real bad character, yeah. One of those things, and\nMasha never liked her. She was there, and we met her too, of course, but the other\none was a much nicer girl. And then she had two -- two -- two daughters, and the\nfather -- from the sister -- from the cousin, had a big factory. He made appliances.\nWe have one here, it\u2019s an automatic tea maker.

We stayed in\nthe Hilton as I recall and saw the relatives, of course, every day. And they came to\nAmerica later, several times, yeah. He had the -- the cousin\u2019s husband had a -- a Fiat\nrepair shop, Fiat di -- did -- I think repair, and dealership maybe, too. Just retired\nrecently. That was \u201979, of course. And then from se -- from -- from Israel we went to\nGreece, we took the Mediterranean cruise, Masha probably told you. Yeah,\nMediterranean cruise to Istanbul. And then we saw -- saw the -- all the Turkish cities\nwith all the Roman relics. Kusadasi, that\u2019s near Istanbul, it\u2019s beautiful. Istanbul was\nstriking as you arrive. When you arrived in Istanbul from the boat, you know the --\nthe -- the -- the -- incredibly beautiful, but as you arrived on the pier and you landed,\ndirty. Dirty, unbelievably filthy, yeah.

And as it\nturned out, Loen turned out to be more complicated, because nine out of 10 times, it\u2019s\npronounced Leon.

They\nwere in for -- well, you see, the -- the -- in -- in Budapest, actually, the -- th-the most\ndangerous situation was 1n the last six months, eight months of the war, yeah.

And we\n-- it was a group of people about, I would say, maybe 16 people here, we met, and we\nformed a society.

It\u2019s -- it\u2019s not -- it was not a good idea. It was a good idea\noriginally, see, but then it would have been hard to keep up with the members. Some\nof them really got scared, I think.

See, and all the -- th-the newspapers and the media was\nagainst them, the -- the -- the k -- the -- the -- the killers, you know, genocide here\nand there.

The [indecipherable] gonna start killing the\nSerbs. It never stops. Never stops in the small countries, you know?

Although I -- you know, we -- I was\nreading once in a paper that -- that -- that hurricanes are much worse. It\u2019s possible.\nWell, of course, it lasts much longer and it does more damage. But, of course, it\ndepends where you live, like even in Los Angeles, you know, the big earthquake we\nhad in \u201972 -- no, \u201972 was the first one, when was this big one?

First we had a 1922 Fiat Torino. 19 - twe -- I mean, I\u2019d like\nto have that car now. That would be worth a few dollars, I imagine. This car was\nconfiscated by the Hungarian army, and it just disappeared during the war. We never\nhad it -- [remember my uncle used to drive that car, he was an insurance broker from\n-- in my father\u2019s insurance company. He used to drive to the country on those lousy\nEuropean roads, you know. And if I tell you that that car had ar-around 200,000\nmiles when it was stolen. You know, it\u2019s 200,000 miles, it\u2019s a pr -- incredible. Well,\nit had a few repair jobs, I remember, but still 1t was in good shape, still driving.\nTorino, Fiat Torino. And then later, Father bought a -- a 1938 Chevy for 800 dollars,\nbrand new. Well, 800 dollars in 1938 was 800 dollars. So -- comparatively speaking,\nbut -- and that car was also confiscated during the war, and disappeared, which was\nunfortunate.

        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So you lost all of [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. And then, of course, we had a beautiful house in Novi Sad, that beautiful\nhouse which we always lo -- al-also lost. And then we got some compensation for it\nafter the war, a ridiculous amount, I hate to mention it, it was just nothing. But a\nbeautiful big home, and what -- we had about 10 rooms, and a big backyard, statues,\nwe had two statues made by a quite famous master there in -- in -- in Yugoslavia,\nwho incidentally committed suicide in Israel, his name was Coura. It was a -- quite a\n-- quite a -- it was not Mestrovic, but he was great, well known. And [indecipherable]\nand of course it was during the Communist, you know, it was confiscated and a lot of\nfamilies lived in that house. And somehow we got some money out of it, I don\u2019t\nknow how and who, the Yugoslav government [indecipherable] paid some\ncompensation. And ma -- ma -- my mom, late mother, she got a check and then she\ngave both sons something, and -- you know. What else was there?",
        "Q: And you lost your luggage, but then later on th -- you lost things again, right?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, but the luggage, that -- that -- that was -- that was a big loss, because\nthat -- very valuable things, you know, and the -- nothing for it, nothing for it. Lo --\nlo -- later we lost a little money in investments.",
        "Q: Did you ever have any --",
        "A: See, some people --",
        "Q: -- did you ever get any compensation from -- from -- for -- for the war?",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t. Only Masha. I didn\u2019t get any fortu -- unfortunately, as I\nsay, I went to one lawyer once, and -- the Lowenberg lawyer I mentioned to you and\nhe told me that there\u2019s nothing he can do with -- with my case because I was not --",
        "Q: You did mention -- yeah, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you, but you only said that to me\nprivately in the car, maybe you should say that as an episode [indecipherable |",
        "A: Oh, the -- the Lowenberg?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, oh, the [indecipherable] the story, yeah, yeah, was interesting. I went to this\nGerman lawyer, name was Lowenberg and he looked exactly like my father. I told\nmy wife to take a look. I mean, this is -- this 1s ma -- like my father\u2019s brother. And\nthen I asked the man where he was born, and he said he\u2019s -- he\u2019s from Vestva and\nthat\u2019s a part of Germany, and as it happens, my father\u2019s grandfather came from\nVestva, so he could have been a relative. But he was not a nice guy, he was not a nice\nlawyer. Very unfriendly, very uncooperative, and as I say, he was very negative. So I\nsaid to my wife, you know, wasting time here, nothing we can do. But there was\nanother lawyer also who told me that there\u2019s nothing he can do with Yugoslavia.\nNothing he can do with Yugoslavia. And now lately, there were stories that if you\nwere in a Hungarian camp, a Hungarian labor camp, that you are eligible for certain\ncompensation from the Hungarian government. So I wrote a letter, I wrote a letter\nand no answer yet. But somebody told me -- somebody told me, a Hungarian woman,\nshe says, all you can expect from the Hungarians, if you -- you do get something,\nbeing in the labor camp, some money, but you\u2019re not going to get the money, the\nmoney is going to stay in Hungary, and you have to go to Hungary and spend the\nmoney there. Nice, huh? And, again, it\u2019s only a nominal fee, she says, nothing,\nnothing to get excited about. Well, that is her opinion, but I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m still\nexpecting an answer from a -- I think Chicago 1s the lawyer. [indecipherable] even\nhappens if -- well, sure I should get some compensation, being in a camp. It was a\nlabor camp, it was a slave labor camp, you know? I-I didn't go there voluntarily, best\nyears of my life. Spent there, how many times [indecipherable] about two years. I\nhave pictures also, I have photos from the camp, which 1s unusual, a lot of people\ndon\u2019t, of course, you know, yeah, but I was in the camp there with the commander,\nwith the sergeant and the whole thing, the whole group of people. So\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: So, I\u2019m kind of out of questions at this point. Is there anything that you would like\nto -- to add, or say or something I didn\u2019t ask, or that you really want to -- to add to\nthis?",
        "A: No, what can I say? As I say, I\u2019m married to a great wife, who 1s the greatest coo-\ncook in the world. Very beautiful girl. Didn\u2019t change too much. I told you in the\nbeginning she was the most beautiful girl, she still 1s. She\u2019s very nice to me, and she -\n- we have a beautiful son who presently lives in Las Vegas and calls every day. Very\n-- very devoted, very devoted son, very, very nice kid. Very unusual. You hear\nstories, you know, from people where their children are just a -- forgot their parents,\nand bad relationships, and to have a son like him is -- 1s -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a jewel, a\npresent, really. But the way we brought him up I think is a lot to do with it. The\nbringing up, you know? Always close to him, always nice to him and that\u2019s why he\u2019s\nnice to us. He really likes us, you know? Comes twice a year, three times a year from\nVegas on vacation. He\u2019s coming in a few weeks before Masha\u2019s birthday, already\nhappy about it.",
        "Q: Ihave one more question after all. Did it make a difference any way or another\nthat you were married to a survivor, too?",
        "A: Oh no, no, I\u2019m happy. No, absolutely not. I was a survivor too.",
        "Q: No, I mean, was it -- was it -- was it even a help? Was it important in some ways\neven? I mean, I didn\u2019t mean to be negative about it, just [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I don\u2019t know. I usu -- we just met, you know, and I\njust happened to meet this beautiful girl. [indecipherable] really, survivor or no\nsurvivor, if she was no survivor, she\u2019s still a beautiful girl.",

        "A: Circumstances, okay. Well, I was in the labor came and one day my older friend\napproached me and said, Cornell, next morning when the train pulls out from the\nstation, you and I are staying, and we going to hide someplace. We are not leaving\nwith this train. Cause the train was going on and on and on of course. And, of course,\nmy -- my closest friends were my age, see, he was a little bit older, maybe wiser, and\nhe had certain ideas, you see. So next day as the train was ready to pull out, and that\nwas in hunga -- Hungary, of course, he -- the train started to move and I had sort of,\nyou know my younger friends, they were all going up on a train and I was ready to\nmove on the train and he grabbed -- fortunately he grabbed my arm, he says, we\u2019re\nstaying. And we didn\u2019t stay. And the train pulled out, and then we hit the road, and\nwe walked on the highway. And after awhile we got off the highway, because it was\ndangerous, you know, trucks were coming with Hungarian soldiers, and maybe\nGerman soldiers, we didn\u2019t want to stay on the highway, too obvious. So we moved\noff the highway and about maybe quarter of a mile, half a mile, and there was some\nwater there, and some little river, and we just sat down there and was waiting for the\ndark. We\u2019re thinking what\u2019s going to happen now, see? Actually it was -- well, it was\nHungary in no -- ru -- th-that -- it was Romania, Romania at that time, yeah, because\nit was always back and forth Hungary and Romania and back and forth. And before it\ngot dark, some Hungarian soldiers stopped on the highway and came towards the\nriver. So we got sort of a little bit scared, but then you have to act cool, right? And as\nthey were getting closer and closer, we got up and we waved to them.\n[indecipherable] come over here, here is the river, see? Came over, sa -- and they\ncame over and then one of them asked us, he says, what are you doing? We says, ah,\nwe got late -- we got off the train -- w-we missed the train, we\u2019re waiting. Oh. They\ndidn\u2019t make a big issue out of 1t, we\u2019re lucky. Then they left. Later it became dark. A\nRomanian farmer came across the river and he said he is willing to hide us. So all\nright. Actually it was four of us, yeah, this older guy, me and two other guys\n[indecipherable]. So, we accepted, what choice do you have, right? So we went -- he\ntook us to his little farm and we went upstairs in his barn and we were hiding there.\nWe were hiding for a few days and suddenly we hear guns, guns, guns, Russian guns\ngetting closer and closer. We had food, we fed us potatoes, we\u2019re not hungry, had\nwater and everything. And -- and then he came -- one evening he cames over and he\nsaid the Russians are next door in the next village, but they celebrating. So, d -- you\nknow, how long are they gonna celebrate? But two days later they came, the Russians\nand the Romanians. First thing is a Romanian soldier I remember, first thing he did,\nhe took my watch. So wa -- so I asked him, I says -- some -- somewhat we\nconversed, you know. I said, why are you taking my watch? He says, I have to give it\nto the Russians. [indecipherable] okay. The next Romanian took my shoes, which I\ndidn't mind because it had nails from inside, you know? So he gave me his shoes. I\nthink it was a good trade. Anyway, so then we -- no, says, well let\u2019s start an -- let\u2019s\nstart walking. Walking the -- th-the aim, the goal was to reach his hometown in\nHungary, which was probably hundred miles from there, roughly. So we\u2019re walking,\nmaybe we get some rides. So we walked on the highway, see? And so the Russian\nCossacks on horses on the highway, shooting apple off the trees, and all that. And\nthen came a Russian -- Russian soldiers, you know, on -- on -- on trucks, they\nstopped, and they asked us, they said what -- who are you? Says, well we are, you\nknow, we were in labor camps. Th-Th -- actually didn\u2019t know exactly what you are\ntalking about, this -- they didn\u2019t know. What do they know? So it\u2019s -- one\n[indecipherable] ask who -- who -- where you from? I says, I am from Yugoslavia.\nHe says, wh-wh-why aren\u2019t you fighting with the partisans? [indecipherable] going to\nexplain it. But anyway -- and I spoke Russian, fortunately. That was another thing by\nthe way, my f -- my -- my f -- older friend was smart too, he knew with me -- he was\ngoing need the Russian language. So he was not stupid. So I spoke Russian. Okay, so\noh, oh, all right, fine, fine. And a Jewish officer, Russian officer came over and was\ntalking to me, so, are you Jewish? I say yes. He says, okay, I am too, he says, but be\nquiet, don\u2019t tell the Russian soldier that I\u2019m -- they don\u2019t know that I am Jewish.\nInteresting. I don\u2019t recall now if that truck, or we -- I think we took a ride with them,\nthey took us for a few miles, 20 - 30 - 40 miles, then we got off again. Well,\neventually, in about two days, we got into his hometown. His wife was there, of\ncourse, his wife was a Gentile. He was also half Jewish like I was, I didn't mention\nthat. His wife was Gentile, of course. And in his hometown, there\u2019s absolutely no\nsign or war. There was no sign of war, it was peace. Food like in the peacetime.\nDuck, geese, anything, it was just [indecipherable]. So we s -- I's -- the two guys and\nmyself, we staying by their house, and we stayed with them, of course. The name of\nthe city was Bekes-Gyula. It was about maybe 60 miles from Budapest --",
        "A: -- 60 - 70 miles from Budapest. We stayed there. I did not know at that time if my\nparents are okay -- they lived in Budapest, see? And I had a brother who was in Borr,\nBorr was a famous camp, you probably heard about it, the copper mines, you know,\nand they took from Hungary, these kids to Borr in \u201944. Later I -- somehow I found\nout through somebody who came from Budapest that my parents are alive, but my\nbrother died, he was killed in Borr. He was murdered in Borr. Later, after the war,\nmy cousin went to Borr by the way and recovered his body and brought his body\nback to Novi Sad, to my hometown, where he was buried. Now, the idea was to get\nto Budapest, but Budapest was not liberated yet, that time, well, they were still\nfighting for Budapest. And then I got a job as an interpreter with -- in a Russian h-\nhospital. The commander was Jewish, by the way. We became sort of friends.",
        "A: In -- no, that was still in -- in Bekes-Gyula.",
        "A: In Bekes-Gyula, and [indecipherable] of course, from Budapest gets liberated\nright away, we\u2019ll go to Budapest. Sure enough, we went to Budapest with him, with\nthe Russian commander, and arrived in Budapest -- 1t was unbelievable, of course.\nPeople starving on the streets, coming over to the truck, begging for food, will give\nyou anything. Gold rings, whatever you have, for a loaf of bread. Was pathetic. And\nthe city looked, of course, terrible. It was just a day after liberation, still t -- heard\nshootings and everything. And now the idea was to find my parents. Well, I knew\nwhere they lived, see, because I lived in an apartment too, before I went to labor\ncamp. So that was no problem to find them. So we -- we drove over there, with the\ntruck. And my mother opened the door. She didn't know I was coming, of course, she\nopened the door, and she saw me, it was unbelievable, you know, like ah. She didn\u2019t\nknow the circumstances. And then -- course we talked about my brother and\neverything, and they were in good shape, they were lucky, and then -- of course we\ninvited -- the Russian commander stayed there 1n the apartment, he s -- he lived there.\nWe -- I don\u2019t know how long I will stay, but I was very lucky. I remember one day in\nBudapest, I was walking down the street, and came these Russian soldiers,\nsurrounded a whole block and took every man, every man from that block, they took\ninto a backyard, into a big backyard, a schoolyard or something. I did not like the\nidea, I knew there is something wrong here, something is going to happen. So I said,\nI better work fast here. So I found a soldier in the group there, and I told him, hey, do\nme a favor. Go over to this place -- I gave him my mother\u2019s address -- find my\ncommander, and tell him to come over here immediately, I need him. I was very,\nvery lucky, cause the Russians were unreliable, very unreliable people. Big liars and\nunreliable. Now, first of all, he has to find the place. He\u2019s not a Hungarian, you\nknow? I just give him an address. Then, he has to go, to begin with. And then he has\n-- and then he has to find the commander in the house and bring him over here,\nbecause this is a matter of time now, right. He did go. He did bring the commander,\nand the commander came in. I told him what the story is -- well, he knew, so he\ntalked to the commander in the yard and told him, this is -- I need this man, he is my\ninterpreter. I need him, you have to release him. Okay, that\u2019s it. He saved me. I don\u2019t\nhave to tell you what happened to the rest of the people. Russia. Took them to\nRussia. Many of them probably died. Matter of fact, not in that group, but I know my\nfather\u2019s -- one of his good friends from Yugoslavia originally, who was in a German\nconcentration camp, and who came back liberated from ra -- from Germany, was\ncaught in one of these Russian affairs, you know, taken to Russia and died in Russia.\nTerrible. I --",
        "A: Yeah, of course, that\u2019s why -- exactly, that\u2019s why how could -- she could stay\nbecause she was Gentile, and she lived in this apartment house, and the -- the land --\nnot the landlord, the -- the -- ha -- the keep -- not e -- the manager of the house was\nalso, of course, Gentile and he told the soldiers when the soldiers came a few times,\nwho are these people, he said, this is Mrs. Loen -- Lowenberg at that time, of course,\nand she\u2019s a Gentile person, you know, she was [indecipherable] the name, her father\nwas actually German, the mother was Hungarian. Of course, my mother did convert,\nyou know, but they didn\u2019t know that, originally. And then she had the opportunity to\nsave a lot of Jewish people from this apartment house. They were moved, before, to\nanother apartment house, downtown Budapest and my mother used to take food\nthere. Yeah, she ta-take them -- took them food, let her in, you know, and one time\none of the guards I think was objecting and so forth, and what she said, you have to\nlet me in because these people owe me money. Something like that, you know, sh-\nshe\u2019s smart. And -- and she has -- I don\u2019t know if Masha mentioned it to you 1n j -- in\nJerusalem she has a plaque, you know, and sh -- okay.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah, big one with George Putnam.",
        "A: Oh, she said that?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, okay --",
        "A: Okay. So anyway -- so then, a wa -- as I say, I was lucky, he saved me. Then I\nwent back to -- I was going back and forth from this Bekes-Gyula, you know, where I\nlived with my friend, because th -- I lived there, actually. I didn't move right away\nback to Budapest. And we used to do some funny business, we went to Romania\nfrom Hungary and smuggled certain things. Like one time we smuggled a carload of\nsugar, and the Romanians mixed it with salt, so we had to throw the whole thing --\nthat reminded me, Stalin -- Stalin said once, he says, Romanians are not a nation,\nthey\u2019re a profession. It\u2019s true. Was very, very disgusting, but what can you do?\nAmazing. I told the story the other day to a Romanian guy about the sugar, so he said\nright away, they mixed it with salt, didn\u2019t they? So he knew. This was now, in 1999.\nSee, a Romanian. Takes a Romanian to know. But my friend, by the way, where I\nlived in -- in -- interestingly enough, I remember he had a brother who lived in\nLondon, who went to London before the war, and he was on the British Broadcasting\nCorporation, yes? His name was Haytai. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. I don\u2019t\nknow what happened to the brother. I know one thing, the brother where we lived, it\nwas very nice, and the wife was nice, but they were constantly fighting, which made\nit sort of unpleasant sometimes, you know, to live and stay and eat in a place where\nthe -- th-the host and the hostess constantly fight. The reason I don\u2019t know. But\nanyway, he was too much in business, he was a businessman and preoccupied with\nbusiness, and I think that\u2019s what she objected to. She was fairly young woman yet,\nyou know, the man comes back after, you know, so many years from a labor camp\nand then he -- 99 percent he spends in business, you know, and one percent with the\nwife. But then -- then eventually, of course, we split because I did go back to\nBudapest and -- and stayed with my parents. Now the goal at that time was\neventually to go to America where my older brother -- Masha, I\u2019m sure mentioned it\nto you, Ernest le -- came in 1938, he stayed here. So we have to get somehow out\nhere, and -- and the parents were working on it, too, but I had to leave, somehow,\nHungary and go to Austria, sort of the bridge, then from Austria to America. So I had\n[indecipherable] first to cross the border. Couldn\u2019t go it legally. So at night, with one\nof my good friends who was with me in the labor camp, he was -- by the way, I don\u2019t\nknow if I mentioned it before, that a lot of the guys were killed from -- on that train\nwhen we left -- oh, I didn\u2019t say that, yeah, where he pulled me away from the train\nand the train went on, lot of these kids were -- lot of them were murdered later in\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "A: We knew, we found out from somebody else. Yeah, that was a fact. So that was --\nI was really lucky. Who knows what would have happened? But this -- this guy --\nthis -- this kid who le-left Hungary with me to Austria, Segeti Pauli was my best\nfriend. He also escaped the train, the same train, a few stations later. So whoever\nescaped [indecipherable] well, anyway, so at night we crossed the border, paid a few\nforints, or whatever, panguat, I don\u2019t remember the currency, and we crossed the\nborder and came to Austria. So then we went to Vienna first and then\n[indecipherable] I was to get to a displaced camp, and we knew about two displaced\ncamps in Linz, Linz on the Danube. It\u2019s between Salzburg and Vienna, about\nhalfway. And so we went to this -- that was easy when you get to a displaced camp,\nright away you register, you know. First we went to Lakeside, which was pretty lousy\nconditions, but then we went to Bindermichl. Now Bindermichl was like a -- a Hilton\nin comparison with Lakeside, right? And got a nice room, kitchen facilities. So -- he\nwas married, by the way, my friend, married. And so we stayed there, he and his wife\nand myself.",
        "A: Oh, of course it was different, because ev -- first of all, we were -- well, 1-1-in -- in\nthat camp it was different because there was never a danger of being killed, you see?\nFood three times a day. I me -- not weinerschnitzel, you understand, but beans --\nbean soup, a -- but food. Coffee, everything. No problem. The commander was a\nlieutenant, nice guy, alcoholic, was drinking, you know? And just did what he had to\ndo. Were never any beatings, were never any threatening. Matter of fact, we didn\u2019t\nknow at that time what was really going on, except once, where in the very beginning\nfor instance, on weekends, I used to go back to Budapest, to my parents on\nweekends, it was so easy. And then we stopped at one station and there comes a train\nfrom Budapest, with people, you know, they were taking them to Poland in cattle\ncars. People just crying for water. So what\u2019s going on? This was the first time that we\nrealized that something -- something is going on, you see? And -- but we couldn\u2019t get\nclose to the train, they didn\u2019t let us close. But as I say, it was -- a lot of half Jews\nwere killed and murdered in Auschwitz, you know, I was just lucky that we stayed\nthere and nobody bothered to -- to -- you know, to take us anywhere. So we stayed --\na mat -- fr-from that place, by the way, then we moved, a few months later, to\nanother place that was in Romania, Gerdameshtahausa, also we were lucky, also\ncircumstances normal, we were burying Hungarian soldiers, they brought them from\nRussia, you know, and they\u2019re burying them, I remember it was one of the tasks we\ndid. And in the f-first place, we were -- we did -- we build railroad tracks, you know,\nand unloaded railroad cars, you see. And then I remember one day German troops\ncame, and I st -- I -- speaking German of course, so I spoke to one of the Germans\nand they said -- he says, today the invasion started, he told me, it\u2019s a very good\nfeeling. And I say, oh really, bah bah and da da da. But as I say, we were lucky, you\nknow, it was luck. Many, many times it was really luck, lucky circumstances that\nnothing really happened. Th --",
        "A: In the -- in the camp?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Bindermichl, Bindermichl, Bindermichl. I was -- I was\nthinking of something else, well okay, anyway, in Austria, okay, so that was in\nBindermichl, right? So in Bindermichl, nothing, black marketing, you know, no -- no\nbig things, whatever we could do. Well, I didn\u2019t do too much in that, and I was not a\n-- areal expert. Some guys made a lot of money. But any -- one day I was walking\ndown, oh, you know, in -- in the camp itself, and I saw this girl. Masha, yeah. It\u2019s a\nbeautiful girl. Said, where did she come from? She was absolutely stunning. So it\u2019s ju\n-- un-unbelievable how beautiful she is. So we started talking, you know, da da da da\nda da, talking, talking, talking, and then started going together, I invited her\n[indecipherable] to a concert, she says, what\u2019s a concert, you know, she\u2019d never been\nto a concert. She would rather go dancing, like you. But anyway, then I met her\nfather and her stepmother, because her mother was killed in the camp, of course, with\nher sisters. And so we got closer and closer, and so I says -- well, eventually we got\nmarried.",
        "A: Well, she was very attractive, very attr -- different personality, she looked so\ndifferent than anybody else in that camp. No, really, she was really beautiful, I -- I\nfell in love with her.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: I don\u2019t [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s crazy. And so, you know,\nshe had -- sh-she -- she -- she knew that I was -- had plans to go to America, too, and\n-- she had boyfriends, of course, before. As a matter of fact, she had a boyfriend who\nwent to Italy. And he found out later from my friends -- my friends, you know, the\none I told you I lived with, and his wife, he went to Italy and he met this guy, and this\nguy told him that he has a girlfriend in -- in Austria, and he said who? So he says,\nyou're too late. She\u2019s -- she\u2019s getting married. Funny.",
        "A: \u00b047. 1947.Yeah, she was very young. Course, I was what, \u201947, I was 25, Masha\nwas probably, what is it, 18. 18? Yeah, I think she was 18. I think.",
        "A: 17 or 18, something like that, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Was very young, very young. But we got married 1n -- in -- in Bindermichl,\nyou know, Jewish wedding, break the glasses, everything at the end, you know?",
        "A: Well yeah -- y -- really yes, that\u2019s interesting, yes. See, my father was Jewish, my\nmother was Gentile, but as I say, my moth -- mother, at one time, she converted see?\nAnd 1-it was a -- 1t was a jew -- not a religious Jewish home, you know, but tradition.\nJewish holidays we celebrated. My father\u2019s father, I mean, he was more -- you know,\nmore Jewish, but -- but we celebrated the Jewish holidays, all the Jewish holidays. So\nit was a -- it was a -- really a Jewish -- I was Bar Mitzvahed when I was, you know,\n13. So -- so was my older brother, too, and my -- my middle brother, who was killed.\nAnd [| had interestingly enough, strange but true, I had cousins in Hungary who were\nHungarians, and pro-Nazi. Well, of course, you see this is s-sad but true, pro-Nazi. I\nhad an uncle, my mother\u2019s brother, who walked in the night when the Hungarian\narmy came into bu -- to -- to -- to Novi Sad, to my town in 1942, he walked in in a\nNazi uniform. That\u2019s my brothers -- my -- my mother\u2019s brother, my Uncle Steffie,\ncomes in with a Nazi uniform, with the hackenkreuz, you know, on his left arm. He\nsays, I\u2019m sorry [indecipherable] -- he was drinking, he liked to drink. He says, I\u2019m\nsorry, but I can\u2019t help you. The reason he came. He says, I can\u2019t help you. Sad. And\nhis wife too, of course they were all brought -- and like I say, my -- my cousin in\nBudapest was in Hungarian army. We all s -- the youngsters, you know, they used to\ncome to Yugoslavia in the summertime. We were pretty well to do, you know, they\nwere sort of poor people, so they -- we brought them, you know, to Yugoslavia on\nresorts, you know, they stay there. And they were always, you know, different than\nwe were. Th-They were -- were Catholics, you know, pretty religious Catholics. So\nwe always had these political arguments, you know. And there again, they -- they\ncouldn\u2019t help us too much when was a big pogrom in Yugoslavia, in Novi Sad, you\nheard about it, in 1942, when they killed 1500 Jews in one day and everything, and\nnobody would help, nobody. You couldn\u2019t go to anybody. That\u2019s when --",
        "A: Nobody help. Th-That\u2019s when my -- my father\u2019s brother and his wife and the\ndaughter and the whole family was killed in one -- they shot and thrown in the\nDanube river. Was very, very cold day. They -- the Danube was frozen, they had to\ndig holes to shoot. And the Croatian people, the Croatians across the Danube river\nwere applauding. Nice. Very nice people, Croatians. Murderers. But anyway, like I\nsay -- Okay, so Masha and I, right, so we started corresponding and writing to\nAmerica, to my brother and getting the affidavits ready, da da da. My parents left\nEurope earlier, they left in -- yes, in \u201948, one year before we went. And bad luck. As\nit happened, my father send a lot of things in mail, Persian carpets, yeah. Nice\npaintings. A Persian carpet is the most valuable item. Everything was stolen. All the\ncrates came empty and the insurance company didn\u2019t pay a nickel because the things\nwere open. But yet that\u2019s why they said they could -- they -- he said, the things were\nstolen in Europe obviously, not during shipping. He couldn\u2019t collect a penny. That\nwas like the [indecipherable] now, you know. He didn\u2019t pursue that, he shou -- and I\ns -- and I am sure it\u2019s too late now for me to do anything about that. I don\u2019t even\nknow --",
        "A: Noth -- and the cou -- [indecipherable] empty so they couldn\u2019t prove anything.\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t know if I could do anything about it today because I don\u2019t -\n- do not recall, now everybody died there -- died -- mother died, my brother just died\na -- seven, eight weeks ago, my older brother. So I have no idea who they arranged\nwit -- with. Could have been a German company, I don\u2019t know. But anyway, that was",

He was in charge and he -- I don\u2019t know, I heard some shady\nstories about him too, doing some business, you know. The next guy was Kaufman,\ncame after Antel, he\u2019s a very nice guy, Kaufman and his wife. We came very, very\nclose. As a matter of fact, he was from San Diego, and later, when we came to\nAmerica in the early 50\u2019s, we met once in San Diego with this guy, yeah, he was --\nhe was a terrific guy. But the Joint was a great organization, it was really beautiful,\nyou know? Would have been very, very hard if you wouldn\u2019t have any help or, you\nknow, support.",
        "A: Oh, you know, I do -- I -- frankly I do not re -- I think I probably went there. I -- I\ncan\u2019t exactly remember the circumstances, but I -- I would say I probably went there\nand tried to, you know, get a job and I got a job. We have a lady here right now, a\ngood friend of ours, Lydia, she worked for the Joint also, in Linz.",
        "A: Well, at that time I used to speak, of course, Hungarian, which I do speak fluently\nright now. Could say that was my mother tongue in -- Hungarian. And then\nYugoslav, of course, Serbian. And German of course, I spoke as a kid. And then later\nI studied Russian in the [indecipherable] schools, you know, cause I knew eventually\nI might need it. And -- but I -- I forgot already Russian quite a bit. It\u2019s easy -- you --\nyou have to keep up languages, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very easy to forget. Very easy to\nforget. And French, I used to speak French quite well, also, no practice, you know, in\nmany, many years, you forget. It\u2019s a beautiful language.",
        "A: [indecipherable] time.",
        "A: After, yeah -- it-it\u2019s off?\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Ah [indecipherable] here.",
        "A: Exactly. Now we are on, right?",
        "A: Okay. And -- yes, so waiting for the papers, was only a matter of time. As a matter\nof fact, Masha\u2019s parents got the Canadian papers before we got ours. Oh yeah. They -\n- they got it in \u201948, I believe, yeah, had to be \u201948, and they went to Canada, cold\ncountry. As a matter of fact, I had to lend -- my father-in-law was an excellent tailor,\nand he made me a -- a gorgeous winter coat. I had to give him my winter coat\nbecause I figured in California you don\u2019t need a winter coat, and he\u2019s was -- I gave\nhim my -- his creation back, which he appreciated, certainly. Toronto. And they did\nleave in \u201948, and we of course, stayed another full year before we got the papers in\n49. That was in July.",
        "A: Oh, that -- there was no question, so we got food, you know, there\u2019s food from,\nyou know, through the Joint, and s -- there were never a problem.",
        "A: Never a problem.",
        "A: Oh, you don\u2019t want to hear the boat, the story on the boat and everything, not\nimportant.",
        "A: Yeah, well it\u2019s no big deal, I mean, we got this -- we boarded this ship, Royal\nEltinge was the name, it was one of those Liberty ships, you know, in Bremen, right,\nBremenhaven. And I don\u2019t know what to tell you, I got seasick right away 1n the first\nfew hours, in the channel. It was the -- one of the biggest storms. There\u2019s always a\nstorm there, but this was one of the biggest, supposedly. It was absolutely terrible.\nThose days, the boats, you know, they were not balanced as well as they are now,\nsupposedly. But anyway, it was ter -- Masha too, oh. Couldn\u2019t eat for at least one\nday. It was just terrible, terrible experience. And some people were eating and\ndrinking. It\u2019s amazing, you know, some people don\u2019t get affected by it. And that --\non the boat, of course, I was the interpreter, I remember. You know, every so on I\nhad to go on the microphone and tell the people about the situation, da da da da,\nprepare them for everything. And took about 12 to -- 12 days I believe, because we\nwent to New Orleans through New York -- it\u2019s a longer trip, and as far as\nseasickness, then it stopped and the sea was calm, no problem. Then we arrived in\nNew Orleans, was August, and received by the Joint on the pier and then they took us\nfor dinner. The first time in my life did I see white bread. You know, that so-called\nwhite bread, which we didn\u2019t see in Europe, and it looked interesting. It -- it -- it -- it\n-- | thought it was a cake, first, see? Was hard to get used to it though.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, I didn't realize that the only way that you can eat that\nis toasted. But a lot of people do eat it, you know. Then, let\u2019s see, New Orleans, we\nmust have spent one day, maybe, one and a half days. And then, by train of course,\nwe drove to Los Angeles. First time I saw, actually, black people. Still segregated.\nOn the train, in the restaurants, which was amazing to us. But they told Masha --\nMasha -- I remember Masha -- one of the girls in the Jewish committee that told\nMasha, don\u2019t -- don\u2019t -- don\u2019t talk about it, don\u2019t pay too much attention to this, you\nknow, this -- this is just a facts -- facts of life. It was interesting, to us 1t was a very,\nvery unusual experience, in \u00b049, right?",
        "A: Well, it -- it was weird, it was strange, you see. We didn't see any arguments or\nfighting or anything like that, but it was still -- the restrooms, you know, colored,\nwhite, colored, white. Was sort of weird, especially after in the concentration camps,\nyou know. So -- okay, so we arrived August -- end of August, I believe, I -- in Los\nAngeles. My brother, my sister -- ex-sister-in-law, and her daughter, who was a\nyoung girl, waiting for us on the union -- Union Station, yeah, right. So we arrive, the\n[indecipherable] and we drove over to my mother\u2019s house. My mother that time --\nyeah, the moth -- the -- that time, yeah, my mother lived still with my brother in my\nbrother\u2019s house in Burbank. A real hot day, real warm day. You know, celebration,\nhi, kisses back and forth, hello. Haven\u2019t seen my -- my brother since 1937, yeah. He\nhad a -- some business going here. Masha must have mentioned it to you about the\nscooter business he had during the war, he didn't see -- during the war he had -- he\nwas not a -- unfortunately he was a real intellectual, a very bright man, very\nintelligent guy, but business sense he did not have. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s interesting how some\npeople, you know, they\u2019re just born with a sense of business, you know, they can\nmake anything out of nothing, see? He was a kind -- he was just too much of an\nintellectual, and he n -- he knew too much. Later on, of course, he became a\nmanagement consultant and he was actually doing good jobs, you know, for many,\nmany companies. But on his own, he could -- he would never succeed as a\nbusinessman. His -- his good friend, who he came with to America in 1938, he was\njust the opposite, you know? He came from a business oriented family, his father\u2019s\nown -- anyway, he went into the clothing business and eventually made a lot of\nmoney in the clothing business [indecipherable]",
        "A: In the concentration -- you mean, in Europe? Somehow, not much. Later, you\nknow, he found out. Lot of people didn\u2019t really know. We didn't know, in -- lived in\nEurope and didn\u2019t know too much 1-1n the beginning, you see? He didn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t.\nHe heard about, of course, my brother being killed in -- in -- in -- and then whatever\nis in the papers here about the concentration camps. Radio, television, as much. So,\nthen we stayed there, I think, in their house for a few days and then we eventually\nmoved, my mom, my father and Masha and I moved to West Hollywood. West\nHollywood, Clark Street, in 1949, yeah a few -- a month later, I think, or maybe two\nweeks later we moved. Oh, it was impossible situation to live, you know, six people\nin one house, seven people. And on top of it, my late brother, as I said before, he just\ndied a few weeks ago, and was 84 years old, he was not the easiest guy to get along\nwith. A very complicated man.",
        "A: Masha, Masha, yes. In the beginning it was a little bit hard, you see. They -- lot of\n-- unfortunately many times, you know, parents do not accept, oh poor little son, you\nknow, they -- ridiculous, and it was tension, tension there in the beginning, much\ntension. Matter of fact, eventually -- I don\u2019t remember how many weeks we stayed\ntogether, but eventually we had -- we moved. Not far from them, a matter of fact, few\nblocks from them, but we had to move to another apartment, Masha and I, because it\nwas just constant, just tension. And even with my brother, Masha never really got\nalong, all these years, was always -- but as I say, he was a difficult guy, he didn't get\nalong with his wife either, and with his daughter, his own daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to\nhim for 15 years at least, maybe 20 years. Later she -- just last few years, two years\nago I think she made peace. So she realized he\u2019s getting, you know, older, older,\nolder and then -- but it -- it was not easy. The beginning was not easy. But we had a\ngood time, we --",
        "A: Well, ha -- yes and no, no -- you know, I -- first I says, gonna get a job, I went to\nthe Roosevelt Hotel, I remember, on Hollywood Boulevard, trying to get a job, you\nknow, I speak several languages, da da da, fill out an application and nothing\nhappened eventually. Then the first job -- actually the first real job I got was in a\nmotel. Nice, huh? Fa-Fascinating job in a motel on Sunset Boulevard, East Sunset\nBoulevard, that\u2019s near Los Angeles, downtown. Night job. I can tell you, 1t was\nfascinating. I didn\u2019t realize that time that it\u2019s dangerous or not, hold-ups. But it was a\njob, I got it through a Jewish organization, as a matter of fact. A Jewish guy owned\nthat motel. As it happens, the motel is still there. It\u2019s \u201999, I saw it the other day, I\ndrive by it quite often. I don\u2019t know who owns it. I\u2019m sure not that Jewish guy\nbecause he was an old man, but it\u2019s there.",
        "A: I -- no, armed, are you kidding? Not even a knife. Nah, it\u2019s mostly guys came in\nwith girls, you know, at night, to motels. And pay was very low, pay was very low. I\ndidn't stay there too long, I believe maybe two -- two, three weeks, four weeks at\ntops. That same time Masha had a job downtown in a factory, she probably told you,\nyeah. Then after I left the motel -- trying to remember now, recollect here, what was\nmy next job? Oh yeah, my brother had the neighbor in Burbank, he -- and this 1s a\nGerman guy, Erb, Max Erb, he had a downtown Los Angeles -- scientific instruments\nhe used to sell, import from Germany, Zeiss, you know, and microscopes, and sell\nand rent to USC and UCLA, see? It was a big business, and I got a job there in the\nshipping department, I remember, in the shipping department. And I was there\nperhaps five, six months. Couldn\u2019t get along, something happened, that was it, that\nwas the end of that story. Then I joined a milk company here, Arden Farms as a\nsalesman. As a salesman I was soliciting new accounts. You know, o-opening new\naccounts for the milk company. Tho -- time -- it\u2019s still business, but tho -- those time\n-- those days, I mean, it was big business, this home delivery business. And it was a\nfairly good job, and that was a union job. That was the first time I joined the union,\nwhich was good, because I belonged to the union all my life. I worked there, it was\nan easy job, I met a few nice guys who helped me with opening accounts, you know,\nbecause they knew a lot of people on the street. That made it a lot easier, cause you\nget -- you worked on commission. Was -- was a -- basically was a salary, a basic\nsalary, which was not too much, and then whenever you opened an account, of\ncourse, you got commission for the account. So -- so Masha and I then -- we lived, as\nI say, we moved from L.A., from my parents and we had this nice little apartment,\nwhich Masha fixed up very nicely. And we had a nice life.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t -- hm?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t -- no, that -- that -- we didn\u2019t talk about -- we didn\u2019t think about it too\nmuch yet, in the beginning, you know\u201d? We -- we had fr -- [indecipherable] friends,\nfor instance, our first friends was a dentist who was recommended by my landlord to\nmy mother, who lived down on Clark Street, in West Hollywood. And Bestley was\nhis name, and we met them, and eventually we became very, very good friends. They\nbecame our first friends in America, American Jews. Bestley and his wife, and of\ncourse they had a family already, they have kids and they lived in Beverlywood, and\noh, he had a big job with Masha\u2019s teeth, you know, Masha had a big problem, you\nknow, after the concentration camp, and -- but as I say, we became very good friends,\nwe went to movies together and everything. And we [indecipherable] talked about is\nwhy don\u2019t you start a family, why don\u2019t you start a family? I says, ah, we got time,\nwe got time for we get better situated and a bit more money. And then eventually we\nmoved from West Hollywood to the valley. We always liked the valley somehow.\nWe moved to the valley, to a very nice apartment on Deacon Street, where we had a\ncrazy landlady who drove us nuts with keep the carpets clean, keep this clean, keep\nthat clean, you know? So we couldn\u2019t stand it, so we stayed there about two months,\nand we moved out -- same street. We moved to an apartment which this young\ncouple owned, very nice young couple who also became our friends, eventually. And\nthen I -- just about in 1954, I remember I changed jobs again, I joined this company. I\n-- it was a confectionary company, wholesale. They were making a famous Baker\nBoy confection roll, was a cinnamon roll, you know, but very -- very -- already\nestablished in Los Angeles area, and they needed some more salesman and I am --\nintroduced myself, da da da da. So I joined them, and I started working for them,\nselling this confection [indecipherable] to markets, big markets and all -- small\nmarkets, snack shops, stores, everything eventually. It was a good jo -- also a union\njob, of course. Five days, eight hours. Had a van -- their own van, of course, I used,\nyou know. And, as I say, it was a good -- good steady job, which we needed that\ntime. Masha still had her job, I don\u2019t rec -- oh no, that time she had the\n[indecipherable] shop with a partner. So the income was fair, you know.",
        "A: No, no, it was not -- it was not difficult really. I didn't have any problems, you\nknow. Like at this job I got pretty easy and got into it very fast, smooth, no problems.\nMade friends easily [indecipherable |",
        "A: Americans. Matter of fact, Masha pr-probably mentioned it to you that we didn\u2019t\nknow about the survivors. The only survivor we knew was the one from the ship who\ncame with -- on the same boat. And -- but I don\u2019t know why, I still don\u2019t remember\nwhy he didn\u2019t tell us that there\u2019s a lot of survivors here from Masha\u2019s hometown. But\neventually, we somehow ran into them, see, and then we knew more and more of\nthem. And a lot of them that all lived -- you see, we lived in West Hollywood, and\nmost of the Jewish immigrants that time lived in a certain section in town Boyle\nHeights, which was eventually -- or re -- n -- yeah, that\u2019s right, later became Spanish,\nLatino. But that time was strictly Jewish, and they all lived there. And we didn\u2019t\nknow, but through -- and this guy lived there also, this -- yeah, but he didn\u2019t tell us\nabout all these people. Why, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well, it -- yes, yes and no, you see. Like, lot of these American people -- I\nremember the Jewish friends, the dentist, for instance, these people were -- th-that\ntime, they were all Russian sympathizers. You see, we had arguments with them. We\nhad arguments because we knew the Russians. We knew what they were, who they\nwere. They didn\u2019t. See, they didn\u2019t s -- they saw it from another perf -- perspective,\nsee? And this -- this was incredible. Later, they started realizing that we were right,\nbut it took years. Remember when the Rosenbergs were killed, you know, they were\nall [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t -- na -- no, I didn\u2019t like -- I didn't like McCarthy at all, no, I didn\u2019t\nlike him, no, I didn't like him and then [indecipherable] and then Coen, remember\u2019?\nHe\u2019s a -- no, no. To me, I was strictly against that. Strictly, strictly against some days,\ndark days. This -- as I say -- and then, of course, I said I joined this company and I\nwas with them from 1954 to 1978. Can you believe that? Yeah. Meanwhile, David\nwas born, of course in 1958. See that -- and we moved again. We moved from one\nplace to the next place. But also in the valley, we stayed in the valley since first time\nwe moved, we stayed, and we stayed in the valley. San Fernando valley.",
        "A: With him? For him?",
        "A: Not really. Not really, not really. We didn\u2019t have any -- any plans like some\npeople have plans, you know, and th -- tries to do this and that. As far as going to\nschool later, we see -- I don\u2019t know why, just -- David was in sports very much, you\nknow, he liked sports, so -- I remember, I used to be -- I think all the friends we had,\nall the friends we had had all sons, and I don\u2019t remember ever any of their fathers\ngoing with their sons to -- to sporting events. Nat -- none. They were still -- I don\u2019t\nknow why -- I was -- I americize -- it was very, very much, you know, I became an\nAmerican very fast. A lot of our friends were still in the European mind, you know\u2019?\nThey never got accustomed to the American sports, really. That\u2019s interesting. See, I -\n- | caught on pretty fast, you know, baseball, football. And even nowadays, it\u2019s \u201999\nand I would say 90 percent of -- of -- of the friends who came from Europe, no idea\nabout baseball, or football. Interesting. They never got into it. And --",
        "A: Yeah, well sports, of course, of course [indecipherable]. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. I li -\n- I just liked -- I liked America right away, I liked the -- the people, you know. I liked\nthe -- the -- the -- the so-called liberty, you know, that you really can speak and not\nbe afraid to speak. Nobody is watching over you, nobody is following you, you\nknow, we were leaving the horrible period there, so that -- that makes also a big\ndifference, you see? Course, most people who came to America, even before, they\ncame from the terrible circumstances and mayb -- you know, also bad things\n[indecipherable]. So it\u2019s -- was very refreshing, you know? Really different --",
        "A: -- you could argue. Yeah, pardon me?",
        "A: The white bread. No, really. Even food, you know, you get used to the certain\nthings which you didn\u2019t have in Europe. The hamburgers, and the -- eventually, a --\nwe liked it, we liked it, we never had any problems. We never had any problems.\nNever criticized too much.",
        "A: Pretty good life.",
        "A: Oh no, no, no, I agree with that hundred percent. No, had -- somebody had to do\nit. Cause if you don\u2019t do it, if nobody does it, you know, it\u2019ll be forgotten. There\u2019s a\nlot of people like -- would like to forget it, see? And you have to constantly be on top\nof it, constantly. It\u2019s Ju-just something which 1s very, very important, so easy to\nforget, with this denial. This -- I -- I sto -- I still can\u2019t -- I-I can\u2019t conceive this, how\nsome people -- people, how can they deny something like this? Is it -- 1s it really --\nthat really deny -- they really believe in it, or -- or are they just acting, is it part of\nacting? I remember this case when -- I remember, if you recall this Mermestein, they\nhad a lawsuit against this American who -- you remember that case, yeah? Was\nunbelievable. How -- how this guy ever expected to win his case.",
        "A: Well, they -- an -- well, anyway, it was several years ago, this -- it was a guy, an\nintellectual man, you know, was not a nobody and he was not -- not a -- a -- right-\nwinger or a skinhead. A man, a business man, and he denied the Holocaust, he said\nit\u2019s all exaggerated, it didn\u2019t happen. And then one of our friends, Mermestein, who\nwent through the concentration camps, he says, he [indecipherable] you dispute it,\nokay, let\u2019s go to court. And there was a court case, went on for several weeks or\nmonths. 50,000 dollars I think it was, you know [indecipherable] the money, of\ncourse. And the man lost, of course he lost the case, went to court and he lost it, point\nblank. But it was -- it was unbelievable t-to -- how this man ever expected to win.",
        "A: Me?",
        "A: Testify, you mean?",
        "A: No, I didn't. I did not. I did not personally.",
        "A: Europe?",
        "A: Yeah, we went back twice. I went back in 1967 to Novi Sad, to my hometown,\nwith Masha, yeah. Well, 1967 there was still -- lot of the old friends were alive, and\nthe relatives. That Uncle Steffie, remember I told you about, the Nazi th -- he was\nstill alive, with his wife. Very poor.",
        "A: N-Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. He wa -- you see, he ne -- I never took him\ntoo seriously, he was not dangerous. He was just like a -- a comedian to me, even\nthen. Yeah, I know, I know, it sounds sad but true. You see, sometimes he --his wife\nwas alt -- well, no, he had -- a-actually, there were some parts in the family who were\nmuch worse than he was, like my brother\u2019s wife\u2019s family. They were -- they were\nreally bad. They were really -- they were involved in the Nazi regime much, much,\nmuch deeper. He was nothing, nobody took him seriously, this -- this Steffie, not\neven the -- the Germans or the authorities, nothing. But th-these people were\ndangerous, some of those people. Later, some of them came to America after the war,\nyeah. But anyway, in \u201967, as I say, we were there, and lot of our friends were still\nalive. Dr. Fisher and I didn\u2019t meet anybody from my -- my school days, but some of -\n- some of the other ones. I remember I stayed in this hotel -- Masha never mentioned\nit to you? On the Danube River, and Masha got bitten by mosquitoes and we asked\nthe guy next day, I said -- the clerk, I said, why didn\u2019t you put screens -- screens on\nthe windows? He said, you\u2019d ruin the view. She was absolutely destroyed there\nmosquitoes, none of them bit me. See, different blood. Yeah, it\u2019s the blood, they can\nsense this, the mosquitoes in Novi Sad.",
        "A: I what?",
        "A: Oh Austria, oh yes. Oh, Austria\u2019s beautiful. Well, I was in Austria before the war\nalso, in Vienna, many times you see, and Salzburg. But, with her -- oh, we loved it.\nIt\u2019s -- it\u2019s a beautiful country, beautiful country. Salzburg is great, of course. Linz,\nLinz is not as beautiful as Salzburg. And then we went to the Wolfgangsee, beautiful\nlakes, you know. That\u2019s where this -- remember that [indecipherable] tragedy. Food -\n- food was good in Austria. [indecipherable]. Then, in --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, went into -- Masha in Salzburg we ha -- we went to see Jedermann in\n[indecipherable], tre -- a tremendous experience. And we saw of course, Mozart,\nMarriage of Figaro, which 1s also fantastic. The scenery incredible, unforgettable.",
        "A: No, no, because the -- well, they chang -- they changed it, or they tried to change,\nyou know, certain remarks, you know, certain people behaved a little bit weird. But\nall in all there was no trouble, there was no problem. There was no problem. You\ndidn\u2019t feel any animosity, you know. You f -- you felt like at home in Salzburg, we\nhad a good time. Linz, too.",
        "A: No. Not really, no. Reading it, you know, in papers, you know, about sort of -- but\nyou didn\u2019t feel 1t. No-Nothing was like, you know, Europe, after Europe anything\nwas a -- was So bad, you know, that anything, even rem -- 1t was okay, it was okay.\nThere was some, of course, you know. When I had these -- when the Rosenberg\ntrials, of course, you hear some comments. But all in all, you didn\u2019t feel nothing.",
        "A: Oh with the -- the thing --",
        "A: -- oh, oh yeah, we arrived, and yeah, she saw this menu in one of the restaurants\nand she said -- she saw this in the writing on the menu, hot dogs. So she says, what\nkind of a country is this where they serve hot dogs? Was really funny. Really.",
        "A: But later she liked hot dogs. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes. I was there, we see, once, Masha was there twice. And the first time we went\nin \u201979, also a very interesting experience because Masha had -- she knew, see, that\nshe had relatives, did she di -- tell you the story? She must have told --",
        "A: Well, of course, all right. Well, she knew about her -- that she has some relatives\nin Israel, but she had no idea where they live and so forth. And we -- as we arrived in\n-- we went to [indecipherable] of course, Tel Aviv, and we stopped on one corner,\nand we asked the cab driver, this -- these people live here and here? He says\n[indecipherable] live across the street. Across the street, yeah. [indecipherable]. So it\nwas actually Masha\u2019s cousins, first cousins. Tremendous reception, oh, it was\nincredible.

There was actually two of them went to Israel before the war,\ntwo sisters, and one of them was a real bad character, yeah. One of those things, and\nMasha never liked her. She was there, and we met her too, of course, but the other\none was a much nicer girl. And then she had two -- two -- two daughters, and the\nfather -- from the sister -- from the cousin, had a big factory. He made appliances.\nWe have one here, it\u2019s an automatic tea maker. Terrific thing. In two seconds you get\nhot tea. He died also. So we had a very good time there, very good time. We stayed\nabout two weeks in Israel with some friends from America, we came together.

He had the -- the cousin\u2019s husband had a -- a Fiat\nrepair shop, Fiat di -- did -- I think repair, and dealership maybe, too. Just retired\nrecently. That was \u201979, of course. And then from se -- from -- from Israel we went to\nGreece, we took the Mediterranean cruise, Masha probably told you. Yeah,\nMediterranean cruise to Istanbul. And then we saw -- saw the -- all the Turkish cities\nwith all the Roman relics. Kusadasi, that\u2019s near Istanbul, it\u2019s beautiful. Istanbul was\nstriking as you arrive. When you arrived in Istanbul from the boat, you know the --\nthe -- the -- the -- incredibly beautiful, but as you arrived on the pier and you landed,\ndirty. Dirty, unbelievably filthy, yeah. Very disappointing, but that was Istanbul. And\nthen they had a great bazaar there, and they tried to sell you, of course, everything\nand anything. Everything 1s a bargain, everything is free. The most beautiful thing\nwas, of course, the [indecipherable]\nBeginning Tape Two",

And as it\nturned out, Loen turned out to be more complicated, because nine out of 10 times, it\u2019s\npronounced Leon. And imagine the complications, my father\u2019s first name was Leon,\nso they called him Leon Leon. It\u2019s not a joke, it\u2019s a fact. Terrible. Could never\nchange it back.

I think she didn't even\ntell him til he was maybe 15. 14 - 15 - 16, you know, to introduce him. I was telling\nhim more or less about my experiences, which -- you know, an American kid, I\nmean, they -- it-it\u2019s hard to him to -- to -- to -- to ac -- to ac -- understand this whole\nwar situation in Europe.

Interesting, isn\u2019t\nthat something? After all these years. And, I don\u2019t know, ridiculous. I don\u2019t know\nwhat she\u2019s going to get out of it, or not, but that --",

But this 1s -- this is forgotten, this\nis gonna be -- this 1s just part of history. And as far as, for instance, Roosevelt,\nRoosevelt to me -- see, I -- I didn\u2019t know, I never realized it, being in Europe, and --\nduring the war, to me, you know, Roosevelt was a -- a -- a -- as far as a -- a great\npresident, you know, and being an anti-Semite or not, we did not know. Later, when\nwe came to America, Masha had a discussion with a lady who told him -- told Masha\nthat Hoover -- see, we thought that Hoover, yeah, Hoover, Republican, da da da\n[indecipherable] the Democrat, he says Hoover was much more for the Jews than\nRoosevelt -- Roosevelt. And later we found out it was a fact that -- course Roosevelt\nwas under a lot of pressure from the Congress, you know the Senate, and he couldn\u2019t\ndo himsel -- alone, but he could have done more, a lot more than he did.

And they honored a lot of\npeople from different countries and one of them was my mother, which was a -- that\nwas a great experience, of course, a beautiful thing. And what she did -- what she did\nwas great, because you have to remember, i1-it sounds easy now, but when she did it,\nit was dangerous. Lot of people in Europe who were trying to hide Jews, some way,\nin one way or another, were killed, cause there was a lot of informants. See, like this\n-- this -- I told you the -- the -- the manager of that apartment house, he knew exactly\nwhat the mother is doing, and he could have -- one word he says, boom, she\u2019s gone.\nThe -- the leader of the Hungarian Arrow Cross party, Szalasi, lived across the street\nfrom her apartment house, for instance.

I should have asked my\nmother what happened to some of those people. I don\u2019t know if she ever met them\nafter the war. It\u2019s quite a few families, quite a few families. It was a long time. They\nwere in for -- well, you see, the -- the -- in -- in Budapest, actually, the -- th-the most\ndangerous situation was 1n the last six months, eight months of the war, yeah. In\nBudapest was -- life was quite -- fairly normal til then, but then it started, you know?\nEichmann came in and he says, final solution, this is it, and then they started, you\nknow, that -- taking most people to Auschwitz.

A Serbian guy with a Jewish wife, and\ncame up with the idea to organize a -- a Jewish Serbian society, because you know,\nthe ger -- serban -- Serbs suffered al-also under the war a lot, a lot, of course. And we\n-- it was a group of people about, I would say, maybe 16 people here, we met, and we\nformed a society. They had another Jewish Serbian society back east, I understand, so\n-- but we -- we are not in connection with them. See, we\u2019re a separate unit. And then\nwe had meetings every so often here and Pacific Palisades with the people. It lasted\nfor quite some time, but then the political situation in Europe started with this\nYugoslavia, with -- especially now [indecipherable] with Kosovo and everything, but\nlong before that already, it\u2019s got pretty bad and we figured we better stop. And then\nwe stopped the meetings and somehow the whole organization fell apart and we lost\ncontact completely with them in Yugoslavia. They were from Belgrade. Very nice\npeople.",

        "A: I -- I -- I do think so, I do think so, you see, but it\u2019s very hard to prove one way or\nanother. You see, Kosovo -- I don\u2019t know if you recall from history, the historical\nthing, in the -- 1480, I believe, the Turks massacred, you know, the Serbs in Kosovo,\nand they won the war, and they were sitting then on yugosla -- on Serbia for 500\nyears. Turks, see? And they were Muslims, of course. Frankly, I do not recall how\nthe Albanians came into Kosovo. I -- before this whole thing started, 1f you will ask\nme, I -- I wouldn\u2019t have known if -- if there\u2019s Albanians in Kosovo [indecipherable |\nSerbia.

But it\u2019s all over. It\u2019s all over. And Milosevic is still there. What\u2019s going to\nhappen to Milosevic I don\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t know either, I think. But he is there.",
        "A: Sometimes yes, sometimes no, but as I said, you see, it\u2019s all political. Look at --\nlook at what happened with -- with Saddam Hussein. Nothing, right? He\u2019s still there.\nWhat did we accomplish? Absolutely nothing. So it\u2019s hard to say, you know, it looks\ngood, it looks good for awhile and then everything cools off, and everything goes\nback to normal.",

        "A: Because we figured it\u2019s not a very good idea, you know, we were -- well, we\u2019re\nnot afraid really, but we feel we better lay off, let it -- let it cool off a little bit before\nwe Start again something. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s not -- it was not a good idea. It was a good idea\noriginally, see, but then it would have been hard to keep up with the members. Some\nof them really got scared, I think. So how can you sympathize? How can you\nsympathize with the Serbs? See, and all the -- th-the newspapers and the media was\nagainst them, the -- the -- the k -- the -- the -- the killers, you know, genocide here\nand there. I mean, how can you have a society and sympathize with them? So we just\nfigured it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s better -- Lydia, one of our good friends, you know, was very much\nfor the society. She was reading these articles, says Cornell, it\u2019s impossible. Says,\ncome on, how can we have this society? Doesn\u2019t make any sense. And now you\nknow what\u2019s going to happen in Kosovo? The [indecipherable] gonna start killing the\nSerbs. It never stops. Never stops in the small countries, you know? Look what the\nCroatians -- look what the Croatians did to the Serbs several years ago, was a\ntremendous massacre, Clinton didn\u2019t lift a finger.

Nice, huh? And, again, it\u2019s only a nominal fee, she says, nothing,\nnothing to get excited about.
