My grandmother my paternal\ngrandmother lived a simpler life. In a different section of Pabianice, but it was still it was nice. It\nwas nice. I should say though that my grandmother Salzberg I do remember when I was very,\nvery young we used to have facilities on the outside. I did not have that at my other\ngrandparents\u2019 house.

        "Q: And then what happened.",
        "A: Well since you know how old I am, I started school in 1932. 31, 32, when I was about five,\nfive and a half years old. And it was fine. We learned, we had fun. And it didn\u2019t last very long\nbecause as you know in 1933 the Nazis came into power. And how I happened to be very,\nbecome very much aware of that is because of something that happened to me in public school.\nIf you\u2019d like I can tell it to you. I went to school one day as I always did and was called out of\nclass. And there was, I was called into an office of a very quote unquote nice lady and she had a\nconversation with me and asked me many questions about my mother and father and\ngrandparents, my aunts, my uncles.

And at that time I still had a great grandfather, my maternal grandmother\u2019s father\nwas still living whom I was very fond of. So they dug into the back, my background as far back\nas a child of six, seven years old could remember. And when I came home and told my parents\nabout this, they were furious. And it wasn\u2019t too long after that that my parents put me into a\nprivate school for Jewish girls. And my and that coincides with the time that I wasn\u2019t even\nwelcomed in public school anymore. What this was about, this interview was called in German,\nPll give you the German word for it. It\u2019s called Razen undazuhom. Literally translated means\nrace research. Race, race research is what it means.",
        "Q: You said your parents were furious. Did they explain to you why they were so angered?",
        "A: I think so. To the best of my knowledge my father especially was very vocal about it.\nBecause he felt at that time that 1t was a heck of a lot of nerve for these people to take, get hold\nof a young person like myself and dig into their background. I have to tell you that at the time, at\nthe time, I wasn\u2019t aware. I was curious why. And I also knew that not everybody had this. And\nyou know kids are very tuned into other kids and other kids knew that I went for this interview,\nbut not everybody did. So already there was a line drawn. But it wasn\u2019t as obvious, as\nhorrendous to me as it certainly was to my father. Specially my father.",

        "A: Well what I remember primarily is a man would get on television and he would not on\ntelevision. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m way ahead of him. Wow, thank god there was no television then. Who\nknows what damage he could have done. My father was a, like listening to the radio and I did\ntoo. But when this person came on, I never understood what he was talking about because this\nman screamed and yelled. And although I was very proficient in German and spoke what is now\ncalled Hochdeutsch. They don\u2019t\u2019 even have that anymore. They speak one level of German.\nAnd I also wrote in this different script which 1s Hochdeutsch.",
        "Q: Can you translate Hochdeutsch?",

        "A: I believe they had it on the radio. I believe we were told that in school because I was still in\npublic school. I believe that they talked about it because immediately the pictures went up on the\nwalls of the school with him in his now infamous salute. Yeah. I don\u2019t know that I exactly heard\nor understood or grasped the concept. Can I tell you that I saw this man?",

        "A: When I was still in public school we went on a field, what\u2019s called a field trip. He was in\nHamburg and we had to go downtown and see Hitler. And although it was from a distance,\nremember I was a small person then. So I craned my neck and yes I got to see him and we had to\ngive the what is now the infamous Heil Hitler salute. I will tell you, I was not comfortable with\nthat. And I didn\u2019t really quite know yet why I wasn\u2019t. But I wasn\u2019t. Probably what I heard at\nhome.

Having heard\nhim on the radio and having heard my parents and their acquaintances talk so I think maybe\nthat\u2019s why I was uncomfortable but I had to do it, give the salute. I might add I had to give that\nsalute every morning once he came into power.

I\nwant to ask you to walk me through some of the changes that you might have noticed among\nneighbors and friends in the early days of Hitler\u2019s chancellorship. What stands out in your mind\nabout that time?",

I have, I remember\nher. The boy and I was a bit of a tomboy, this particular boy and his friends, but I\u2019m focusing on\nhim because he was, lived in the building. He joined very early on as a very young kid the Hitler\nYouth and from that moment on I became an outcast. For several years he tormented us with\nbad language, throwing stones, kicking us and as he got older, of course it got worse. He\nsomehow disappeared. I don\u2019t know if they moved or what happened. I, I really don\u2019t know.\nThe, this girl friend of mine from very early on, they didn\u2019t live that close to us but her parents\nand my parents were also friends. And I do remember their last name. It was Vall. They my\nparents stopped being friends with them. Or they with us and I never saw her again either.

You walked around with a nervous stomach and you saw kids that were not, that you\nknew were not Jewish kids. Because we were teased. We were made fun of. We were called\nbad names. They had nobody to answer to. In other words, this was the accepted thing. You felt\nfortunate if they left you alone. And I\u2019m not going to tell you that they, many times when I say\nthey, I\u2019m talking different kids, different from different areas. Don\u2019t\u2019 forget I had to use public\ntransportation to go to school, once I started private school. So you felt fortunate if you didn\u2019t get\npicked on and made fun of and tugged at and pulled at and kicked. And I will say this, I fought\nback too. Yes I did. And but that didn\u2019t matter.

        "Q: I asked you a moment ago if you were still going to Poland over the summers. Did you notice\nanti-Semitism in Poland on those summer visits.",
        "A: No because it was, things were very isolated visits as far as visiting family is concerned,\ngoing to the country. I have to say that I did not. They may have been. I heard conversations you\nknow that they set, you know my grandparents used to say you know this person was you know\nnot friendly toward Jews. But especially my grandfather. He was in a situation where he was a\nprofessional man. People came to him to get rid of a tooth, get rid of pain, to get a filling, to get\na tooth pulled. They were more than grateful if you took care of them. And he was also\nsomewhat educated in medicine. So they came to him actually for more than just the dental\nwork.

But you go try to explain that\nto a ten year old kid. It\u2019s, it\u2019s hard to swallow that. It is hard to swallow. Burning books.

This wasn\u2019t one of\nthese big, big bonfires. They collected books. I don\u2019t even know where they got them from,\nprobably out of people\u2019s homes or stores or neighborhood synagogues. I have no idea where they\ngot them from. And they built like a fire. These were the uniformed brown shirt Nazis, a lot of\nthem young. The youth groups, the youth groups. Hitler Youth. Which you have heard a lot\nabout. And they would light them up and set them on fire and go nuts. And, and absolutely think\nthey were listening to a rock concert.

I might also add that I would say that even prior to Hitler, maybe just\nprior, just after he came in. There were the makings, not even the makings, it was a natural but\nfor a certain element of people to persecute or be anti-Semitic, as it is everywhere.

I didn\u2019t know too much about\nMein Kampf then, his book but that\u2019s what I remember seeing because they were up and around\nand especially when I still went to public school.

Today a person sneezes at one end of the world and it\u2019s picked up at the other end of\nthe world.

And others saying it will, I mean this will pass, this can\u2019t\nbe happening. I may be getting ahead of 1t but people were starting to talk about getting out.\nAnd some left, some people left as early on as 1934, 35. My father\u2019s brother who would follow\nhim to Germany and they were in business together for a time his younger brother. He did not\nleave under the circumstances that my father did because he was able to return to Poland and\nvisit.

Some people more afraid than others and also I might say it\u2019s a tremendous\nventure to pick up your family, your, your, your life and move it to wherever. It\u2019s a tremendous\nand especially when there are children. We knew my aunt and uncle never had children so it\u2019s\nnot as traumatic. We had another my parents had friends Jewish Polish friends, they tried to\nleave but they didn\u2019t. They had no children. People with children, it was a little harder, it was a\nlittle harder to pick up. Imagine yourself having to totally leave. I mean for that time it, maybe\ntoday it isn\u2019t. People are moving about the whole world. In those days they, they left for political\nreasons like my father did but then he had established himself in, and was raising a family.

I went to a religious\nschool, a Jewish school . One did not go to school on the Sabbath but we had to get in six days\nof school. So we went on Sunday. Well we had to sneak that so instead of carrying a book bag, I\nmean this is just one relatively small example, although not so small. Carry instead of a book\nbag, a dress bag.

The other thing\nalso was that sometime around that time the uncle that we have here suggested that my father\ncome by himself and leave my mother and his two daughters to come at a later time. And that\nwas not acceptable to him. I may have my dates a little muddled with that. But instead of he\nbasically felt when that first offer came, no I have a family. And my mother was totally against\nmoving. How could she leave. Poland was not that far away. If she came to let\u2019s say the US she\nwould never get to see her parents and her family again. And this will pass, this, this can\u2019t last.\nPeople were in total I\u2019m not going to say denial, but disbelief.

Totally no livelihood, number one.\nNumber two the Gestapo started hounding us. Number three people were disappearing, people\nthat we knew were disappearing. Kids were taken out from school, as I mentioned before, first\nvery quietly, very nicely. And then not so nice. We lived in a very nice apartment building. You\nheard knocks at the door in the middle of the night. More people were taken away. A few\nscreams, screeches. Everything you know it was horrific. We heard via my father and also via\nfriends heard of people disappearing. Oh they were sent to on a train to no man\u2019s land which 1s\nout in the corridor. In fact that\u2019s the word I was looking for much earlier in the tape. And in the\nwinter time. Because winter in Germany at that time came early on, sometimes on my birthday\nthere was snow on the ground and I was born very late in September. But they were sent out on a\ntrain and then chased off the train into no man\u2019s land. And if they tried to come back or plead\nthey were shot. These things came back to us. Or they froze to death or got away. And these\nthings got back to me, to my parents and also to me. And by this time I\u2019m already a pre-teen-er.\nPre-teen. And so beginning to understand. But primarily for my father it was the total no job, no\nmoney coming in. Being released from his representation. And then his own business, what he\ndid on you know himself was also nonexistent. And it was constant harassing of the Gestapo and\nthreats and primarily people disappearing and what they heard. And never to be heard from\nagain. And also other people making plans to leave because Germany at the time that we\u2019re now\nat was in a state of frenzy to rid itself of Jews. So before my uncle Max, Max Salzberg and his\nwife Alice left, we already knew that we had to also make plans.

He also needed to get this didn\u2019t, none of this happens overnight. He also\nneeded to get permission from the Germans to get out, permission to leave. Might I add that all\nof us with the exception of my mother who had a Polish passport were stateless. And I was, my\nsister, my father obviously was. SO you start putting into motion plans to leave which isn\u2019t like\ngoing to a consulate today, get a visa and off you go. It\u2019s a lot of was a lot of work and\npersistence. With the Germans definitely bribing them. Making so called friends with them,\nwell let\u2019s not call it friends, but it\u2019s bribing them and he did that. He bribed, he lied. He did he\nput every trick out of his bag that he could so that we would not be taken away. That didn\u2019t\nguarantee it. Did not guarantee it so he put into motion to leave. The affidavit from the uncle\nfinally came. The permission from the Germans finally came. But we didn\u2019t have a visa from\nthe US to come and that\u2019s where we almost didn\u2019t make it out because the Americans didn\u2019t\nwant to give us a visa. I hate to say that.

He was told nobody could see\nhim. He says but you are going to see me, you are going to see us. Somebody has to see us. It\nwas very dramatic, very compelling.

And all the bens and the furniture but the parakeet to me was my most\nimportant possession that I had to leave behind. We got to Poland the next morning. My father\ncalled her up.

They destroyed our apartment, they trashed it. Bayonetted my bird,\nbayoneted this tiny little bird and beat her to a pulp. She was not a, see what she was doing\nanyway was illegal. She was, she was not a Jewish woman. I have no idea what she was. But she\nhad nowhere to go so you know for her my father said listen. Whatever 1s here is yours. But\nwhat are you going to do with it. So she was in the apartment and they didn\u2019t\u2019 believe her. They,\nthey beat her and destroyed everything. And that\u2019s how we know when they came.

Every time we\nmoved we had everything or my mother or anybody that Nazi out there with the bayonet pointed\nat you and he\u2019s ready. Any excuse, any excuse so let me see my father. He\u2019s talking and he\u2019s\nvery animated and we had no idea. All of a sudden they say the train is going to move and it\nstarted to, move, start to move along slowly and we\u2019re hysterical. There we are. My mother and\ntwo kids and no husband. He\u2019s still talking to the Germans. Finally we saw him run and he got\non the last what do they call it, the end of the train. The man was 40 years old, suffered from\nhigh blood pressure. That he didn\u2019t have a heart attack then was amazing. What did they want\nfrom him. When he finally came into the compartment and told us was they said he had too\nmuch money on him. So he said well then take it. We don\u2019t do that. They didn\u2019t\u2019 offer him an\nalternative. He says well why can\u2019t you take it. He says we are honest, we are honest people. We\ndon\u2019t take money. Well he had to come up with an alternative. He says well then Ill send it to\nHamburg, to the housekeeper. Is that all right. at first they said no and then they said yes.

        "Q: What was the exact date you left Germany?",
        "A: We left Hamburg on November sixth going to the seventh of 1938, just about the last legal\ntrain. When I say legal, yeah legal. Not too many people came out after that.",

Today\u2019s date is\nSeptember 15. This is a continuation of the September 8\" interview with Jutta Levy. This is tape\n2, side A. You have been telling me about your escape from Germany. But I wanted to go back\nand ask about something you had said previously about the last trip to Poland. YOU said it was a\nharrowing trip. Can you tell me about that trip?\nJutta Levy: Well as I may have mentioned we went back at the insistence of my late mother. She\nwanted to have her last goodbyes to her parents and sister and all the relatives. So she took my\nsister and of course me, back to Poland. Now to go to Poland from Hamburg Germany, you get\non the train and you have to go through no man\u2019s land. That\u2019s that stretch of land at that time,\nthat was quote unquote free. That meant passing borders. You\u2019re going through border. Every\nborder stop is a stop and the officials come on board. Well at that time, this is late 38, the\nGermans of course, the Nazis come on board and searched, questioned, very body on the train. I\ndidn\u2019t know at the time what strip search meant. I was a little past 12 years old and I found that\nout in a big hurry. Because of a matronly German woman took the women aside and strip\nsearched them. I was one of them. And if anybody has ever been strip searched and especially\nby an angry, German official of the Nazis, strip searching a young Jewish girl, you can imagine\nwhat that was like. Not pleasant, not nice and without getting graphic very nasty and impersonal.\nIt is one of the most unpleasant experience that I had personally and I think that\u2019s all I\u2019m going\nto say about that. I think one can imagine what that was like. They made it difficult. They let us\ngo but they made it unpleasant, difficult, and also very, very frightening. I was dreading the trip\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

But mercifully I did not. They were very thorough about checking our\nluggage, checking us personally but this intense strip search was not repeated. But it was going\nout of Germany to Poland. Why they didn\u2019t do it on the way back quite in that manner I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow. It\u2019s was maybe a fluke or maybe the other was. I don\u2019t know. they were angry people\nthat, I think if they had had the chance they would have thrown us off the train. Just to be never\nheard from again which they eventually, which they had already done and did more of. Again,\nwe were lucky. Sometimes not knowing a lot of things, not knowing what had already been\ndone is a blessing.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you. You just said a moment ago that they had already done, they had\nalready thrown people off the train. Can you clarify that point?",
        "A: in Hamburg where we lived as I said previously people began disappearing. Especially\npeople, Aust Juden which are the Jews from eastern Europe began disappearing. My parents for\ninstance had a couple. I can even remember their name, Mr. and Mrs. Max Steiner who\ndisappeared. We learned later on I learned later on. My parents knew even before that they were\nrounded up. They were taken away put on a train, sent to what I keep referring to as no man\u2019s\nland in the dead of winter. Told to get off at a given point. Oh they weren\u2019t the only ones. There\nwere hundreds of them. Told to get off the train. And just let go. Chased off the train, let go, in\nthe dead of winter. If the people didn\u2019t move fast enough for them, they were shot. If they\nmanaged to get away, who knows where they went. Some managed to escape to other parts of\nthe world. Others froze to death. Others were shot to death. These stories have been\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

At the time that I\u2019m\ntalking about now when we went legally to Poland, legally to Poland. I mean they could have\ndone what they wanted to. But they didn\u2019t. At the time we did not know what had already been,\nthe atrocities that had already been committed. We didn\u2019t\u2019? know. Communications as I\u2019ve said\nbefore was certainly nothing like it, not anywhere near what it is today. Had it been I don\u2019t think\nI'd be having this interview.",
        "Q: When you got to your relatives in Poland, what was that visit like?",
        "A: Heart wrenching. Very heart wrenching. Not because of any dark premonitions, certainly not\non my grandparents, my relatives side. In fact my grandfather was a very intelligent very this is\nnot my maternal grandfather who is a professional man. Very far sighted very ahead of the times.\nBut he could not foresee nor did he the tragedy that was to come to Poland. What was happening\nin Germany he felt as so many people did at that time, not so much anymore with German Jews.\nBut living in Poland was like living in another world here or another, certainly a faraway country\nhere. He just felt that 1t might pass. But he also fully understood why we had to leave given the\ncircumstances I\u2019ve described before. Lack of making a living, the name calling the anti-\nSemitism is a mild word for what was happening. The burning destruction of synagogues. He\nwas well aware of that. So with a lot of understanding he wished us of course the best but was\nsad to let us go. Not just him, all the family. It was a heart wrenching experience, much more so\nfor my mother and it was for my sister and me too. I felt it maybe a little more keenly being older\nand I loved my family there dearly especially my grandparents, my maternal and my paternal\ngrandmother in her, on my father\u2019s side. What was also very heart breaking I might add is that\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Realizing that we were leaving, realizing\nthat perhaps they would never see him again was conveyed and understood by me even at my\nyoung age. So that whole trip was very fast. We didn\u2019t\u2019 stay long. And again very, very heart\nwrenching. Sad, sad.",
        "Q: Did you notice any changes in the social attitudes toward Jews in Poland at that visit",
        "A: No. At that visit I wasn\u2019t even exposed all that much. We mainly visited. I also vested with\nmy girlfriend and I had friends over there but especially one who also did survive. Her family did\nnot. No I can\u2019t honestly say. My grandmother still, my maternal grandmother still had help in\nthe house. MY grandfather\u2019s practice was continuing on. No I can\u2019t say at that, don\u2019t\u2019 forget.\nThey were always somewhat anti-Semitic, some a great deal Anti-Semitic. I never felt it to that\nextent. After all I was a visitor. And by a visitor I mean visited family and loved ones and was\nloved in return so maybe we were shielded, although I don\u2019t\u2019 think so.",
        "Q: Did your cousin or your friend ask you about what was happening in your life back in\nGermany during that visit.",
        "A: Oh yeah they did. And as best I could explained, especially about they were interested in the\nschool, what was happening in school. What was happening to some of the friends that I had\nback in Hamburg who a lot of them at that point already weren\u2019t there anymore. They had either\nemigrated or were taken away. and of course their fate was unknown to me at that time as with a\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So yes they asked and as best I could,\nas, as kids we\u2019re all we were all the same age. I had explained to them and they were interested\nin what was going on_ thinking surely this would never come into their lives. Little did they\nknow but a few months later they marched in, the Nazis. Into Poland. And their lives changed.",
        "Q: You told me about leaving Germany. And I wanted to ask you to think back and just once\nmore reflect about the moment when you were out of Nazi Occupied territory.",
        "A: Unbelievable as I have told you. First of all the relief of my father getting back on the train.\nKnowing that momentarily we were crossing into a place that was not Nazi Germany. It\u2019s hard\nto explain when you realize that you can say something without being fearful, being afraid. I told\nyou that life had become full of fear, nervous stomach, that kind of fear. People here are people\nin general unless they went through a similar experience can\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not fear of an\nexam, it\u2019s not fear of, it\u2019s a totally different fear.",
        "Q: With respect to that fear that you\u2019re just describing. You mentioned a nervous stomach. Were\nthere are any other symptoms or manifestations of this fear that you can remember from your\nchildhood.",
        "A: Me personally. That nervous stomach that developed when I was a kid has stayed with me to\nthis day, to me. I can\u2019t attribute hyper, I suffer from hyper tension. I can\u2019t attribute that to it,\nalthough my father developed hyper tension there. And ultimately actually died from that\nbecause we didn\u2019t\u2019 have the drugs that they have today for it.

But \u2019'm more keenly aware of a nervous stomach\nwhich I developed and I still have it. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. it\u2019s fear even to this day of\na uniform. My father had a business here downtown and I\u2019m digressing a little bit and he made\nfriends with all the police which was in downtown Washington years and years and years ago.\nEvery time a police man would come up to collect for something or just to come up and say\nhello, my father froze. Every time a uniform came in during the war. A friend of mine was in\nuniform, whether it be army or navy uniform, especially officers, he froze. Momentarily and I\nhave to tell you I do too. And I wasn\u2019t, I had friends that were in the service, but the moment\nwhen you see a uniform that is the fear that developed over a period of time and you live under a\nregime for that many years. six years 1s a long time.",
        "Q: Often times children will have nightmares if they\u2019re anxious about something. Is that\nsomething that was true in your experience.",
        "A: I think so. And this was before we left. When you hear footsteps at night on marble floors,\nboots, and they\u2019re not, you don\u2019t know but they\u2019re not stopping at your door but they are\nstopping someplace else and you hear conversations and it gets loud you can\u2019t help but take this\nwith you when you go to sleep or if you\u2019re awakened by it. It\u2019s hard then to go back to sleep.\nSure. It\u2019s a, it was a fearful frightful I don\u2019t know how else to say it time in my life. I can seek\nfor myself. Not knowing all the ramifications but knowing enough to be afraid.",

        "A: We went by way of Aachen. It\u2019s near the border where my father was taken off the train. And\nonce you are through that you\u2019re in Belgium. And there\u2019s another stop and more uniforms come\nin. The uniforms at this point though are Belgian officials who spoke French and not German.\nSo once we got past that and they were, they were official, they were to the point but even\nthough we were fearful but there was nothing really to be afraid of at that point but as I said\nbefore, you don\u2019t get over that. Once we got through that border, don\u2019t\u2019 forget there were many\nother people on the train in the compartments other than us that were on the run. Some with only\nthe clothes on their back, no luggage even. But then they started to talk a little bit. Without\nfearing that they would be arrested or they would be overheard for saying something that wasn\u2019t\npolitically correct. And what stuck in my mind to this day is that people smuggled things out. In\nthe most ingenious way. I remember one lady had I don\u2019t\u2019 know if it was a coat or a jacket but\nher big buttons about the size of maybe even bigger than a half a dollar and she was so proud of\nherself, as well she should have been, that she was able to smuggle out diamonds that were\nhidden in the hollow of those buttons and I remember that and I was totally amazed. But in\nretrospect how she got away with that. How they didn\u2019t, I mean this was just one. People had\nother ways of bringing things across. But that, that was one thing that stuck in my mind. That\nthey were so relieved that they almost started to share and I did this and I did that and they were\nsaying, well they were basically trashing the Nazis which they hadn\u2019t been able to do all these\nyears. Being afraid to be overheard or if somebody, if they felt they were with somebody that\nthey could trust and they couldn\u2019t trust them. That was another thing. So you know it goes on\nand on. It goes on and when you live under a regime like that and people like ourselves, people\nlike myself it takes a while to trust again and to say wow I can say this. And believe it or not,\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

I have never ever taken that for granted.",
        "Q: Continue on with your trip.",
        "A: So we then came to the rest of it was uneventful. When I say uneventful, nothing 1s\nuneventful and you\u2019re sitting with people that were running away from a dictatorship such as we\nwere running away from so nothing is uneventful. But we don\u2019t want to be repetitious. I don\u2019t\nwant to be. We got to Paris where my mother had her brother there and we stayed there\nwaiting for the Queen Mary to take us to America. While we were in Paris, an incident\nhappened that really changed the rest of Germany forever. And that was the young Jewish\nfellow. He was a Americanized, Greenspan that was his name and he killed an attach\u00e9 in Paris of\nthe German embassy. Most people are, historians are very much aware of that. This of course\ncaused a tremendous upheaval in Germany and that is a, it culminated what they call here now\nKristallnacht, the night of broken glass because of what this young Jewish fellow did out of\nfrustration, anger and whatever other emotion you can think of and I will say this, go on record\nand have said it before. That was the culmination this Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass.\nThey had been doing these things, certainly in Hamburg and other places in Germany all that\nyear and certainly all that fall and early winter while I was still in Germany. I heard oh yes, store\nfronts being broken into. And I knew of book burnings. I saw some of it. And I what I think we\nmean by Kristallnacht which we were still in Europe then. But 1t was the culmination of and so I\nonly want to say that after that it was a miracle, as it was a miracle with us that we got out of\nGermany at the time that we did.

We\nhad proper papers. After that there was no such thing. He was done with, Hitler was done with\nGerman Jews. If he hadn\u2019t annihilated them if we hadn\u2019t gotten out, their life wasn\u2019t worth a\nplugged nickel. Because shortly thereafter he moved into Poland.",
        "Q: While you were in Paris and your hearing this news, what was the reaction of people around\nyou.",
        "A: First of all my father was appalled. I keep referring to my father because he was a very strong\ninfluence in my life. He was, I listened. I listened. When he and my uncle and other, we had\nother relatives in Paris were talking about this incident it was with (pause) regret that this had\nhappened because it put in jeopardy so many people, which of course it did. It also was with\nsome relief that we were out because had the, had we not left exactly when we did. And I mean\nalmost to the minute, I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 be talking to you today. We got out just at the nick of time, six\nhours before the Gestapo came to my house. That this young man chose that day that week to\nshoot the German attach\u00e9, causing tremendous uproar in Germany, and the fact that we were no\nlonger there was very fortunate for us. So yeah we had there was a tremendous amount of relief.\nOn my father, my parents\u2019 part and of course transcended to me. And even though I might have\nleft with a lot of sadness leaving behind friends and stuff. And a life. I having had it explained\nto me what was going on at that point and papers being full of it, radio, I was to tell you that I\nwas pretty happy being out of there. Naturally not knowing what was facing us in a new\ncountry, in a new life, but still we did not have to fear for the Nazis. There were other fears. So\nyes, generally that\u2019s the reaction.

        "Q: Is there anything else that stands out in your mind on your stay there in Paris.",
        "A: My father had a cousin in Paris who lived outside Paris. Their name was Gothelf. The first\ncousin was a well-known artist there, Sam Zamush Gothelf, a well-known artist. He had a son,\n12 years old and here I meet this handsome young fellow. He was about 15, 16 at the time. And\nat 12 years old the hormones already are working a little bit so of course I immediately fell in\nlove with this young cousin. He wrote a beautiful poem in my autograph book. Remember I\nnever go anywhere without my autograph book. He was also an artist. He even drew a beautiful\nlittle picture. A forlorn seashore because we were leaving and turns out that this cousin we heard\nlater who I really liked so very much. His name was Guy, Guy, G-U-Y. Joined the resistance\nand was shot as was his father. And needless to say although I found this out several years later,\nit saddened me deeply. He was, they were talented lovely, lovely people. And especially the\nyoung fellow who I, who I liked so much. Actually I would say that was my first real crush. So\nthe other thing leaving there we had to go to Cherbourg. And everything happens at night. I\ndon\u2019t know why. Late at night we got to Cherbourg, got on a tender. Everything was black.\nEverything was sort of blacked out. And all of a sudden this humongous monster appears in the\nwater. And that was the Queen Mary with a few little lights here and there. This huge to me\nthen and of course it is huge ship out there that we had to get on. And I have to tell you I was\nscared to death, but we got on the ship and started our voyage across.

        "Q: Anybody stand out in your mind who was on the ship with you.",
        "A: Asa matter of fact, I have pictures, tiny little pictures. There was a couple and I don\u2019t\u2019 know\nif, where in Germany they were from, but they were from Germany that traveled and left as we\ndid. Basically the same circumstances that were traveling with very, very young children, babes\nin arms and I do have a picture of them. Because I, I loved autographs and pictures if I could get\nthem. And I do believe they also wrote in my autograph book. They stand out because I, even\nthough I don\u2019t\u2019 know where they came from but traveling with very, very young children into an\nunknown situation.",
        "Q: Did you make any friends on the ship?",
        "A: No other than, well acquaintances but nothing lasting. It\u2019s weird that on the same ship which\nI found out later was a school mate of mine who boarded the ship before I did because the ship\ncame, the Queen Mary came from Southampton to Cherbourg. She boarded. She and her family\nboarded the ship in Southampton. They left before I did but we never ran into each other.

And\nI don\u2019t know because I think life was gray and kind of sad at that point. The thing that was\npointed out to us was the Statue of Liberty and I had heard about it but vaguely. And I couldn\u2019t\u2019\ntell you if I knew the significance of it but I soon learned because people were talking about it.\nand to see the Statue of Liberty and people talking about what it meant that we are now free and\nto pursue, to, to worship, to all the things that it really stands for. To have people talk about it in\nGerman because that\u2019s all I spoke at the time, that was quite a moment. Thinking back on it\nnow. Getting off the ship was quite something else again. My father got down on his hands and\nknees and he kissed the concrete ground as he came off the boat. And that\u2019s a moment I won\u2019t\nforget. The next thing that I saw was a stevedore that just that one stevedore. I remember. He\nwas black and I had not seen too many black people before. In fact I hadn\u2019t, I had seen one. And\nhe was in flowing robes and sort of a diplomat in Hamburg. So and then at first not seeing my\nrelatives, well I mean I had never met them, you know and then my father pointed out over there\nhis brother and his two brothers actually. The one that had left before us and the one that had\nbeen here for many years. I have no other impressions. It was very overwhelming, very, very\noverwhelming. And if you want me to continue on in that vein. The uncle was there that had\nsigned our affidavit. We went to his home. we spent one night there and I was separated from my\nparents which was almost as traumatic as that whole experience of leaving Germany. So if you\nwant me to continue on that I\u2019d be glad to do that.",

        "A: To begin with it was awful. Because as I started to tell you, I was here one day, new country,\nnew language, new everything and my parents went off to Detroit Michigan where my father\u2019s\ntwo brothers were and I was to go with this great aunt and uncle who lived in Washington, DC,\npeople that I didn\u2019t\u2019 know, really never heard of them, but this was my grandmother Salzberg,\nmy paternal grandmother\u2019s sister and her husband who said that they would take me because\nthere was not enough room for me in Detroit. So since I was the older of the two daughters, I\nwas the one that was elected to go with them. Now coming to a new country, being here one\nday, at most two days and one night and then leaving my parents and my sister was t, do you use\nthe word traumatic. It was traumatic. I came here with them on the train. They were very nice\npeople. They didn\u2019t\u2019 understand me, I didn\u2019t understand them. They talked Yiddish but German\nand Yiddish people say are so much alike, but if your ear isn\u2019t used to it you don\u2019t understand.\nAnd they tried, maybe a little bit of German but it was I didn\u2019t understand and I had to go with\nthem. And nobody\u2019s going to feel sorry for me because they had a beautiful home. they were\nvery well heeled people. He had a chauffeur driven car in Washington. And so I don\u2019t want\nanybody feeling sorry for me. I just felt sorry for me. It was my heart was aching. I was alone. I\nfelt like I had been left, like I had been abandoned. And so I was not a happy person when I first\ncame here. And I must say even though these people were wonderful, they meant well. The\nUlmans, U-L-M-A-N. They were very good to me. They were generous. But I was very\nunhappy and very lonesome.",

How long did you stay apart\nfrom your parents.",
        "A: About nine months. Nine months. Yeah and I want to say that I was comfortable. I had, my\nphysical needs were taken care of. I was treated very well. They sent me to the Americanization\nschool. They bought me a couple of more Americanized clothes. Not much, a little bit. They\nhad other family here from his side. He was, Mr. Ulman was not my blood relative but his wife\nmy aunt, great aunt I might say that part. So his he had family here and they weren\u2019t too nice to\nme but I frankly didn\u2019t\u2019 realize that until I understood a little bit more but they sent me to the\nAmericanization school. Downtown at 13 and New York Avenue. The building is still\nstanding. So I was put in with, I was the only kid there. They were all adults. To say that I\ndisliked it is putting it mildly. I hated it. And I don\u2019t think I got a whole lot out of it because I\nwas frankly unhappy. I cried a lot. I cried myself to sleep. I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I woke up crying. I\nwas lonesome. They tried very hard. I, I need to say that they tried hard and I guess they thought\nI was happy. They had a business here. He took me to the business with him. I had no chores to\ndo. I basically had nothing to do. I would go the Americanization school which was not a good\nexperience for me. They didn\u2019t put me into a school and I wonder, years later why not. But\nthat\u2019s how it went. If my father called I would cry and tell him how unhappy I was and a few\nmonths later he did make a trip to Washington to see me. I did not see my mother that whole\ntime. And he came here and he promised that as soon as he could establish himself somewhere\nand he was hopeful it would be other than Detroit.

So he went\nback to Detroit. About nine months later, maybe a little more but let\u2019s say nine, nine and a half\nmonths later my father did pick up with my mother and my sister and moved to New York. My\nmother had some cousins there. And he felt maybe that would be better. He didn\u2019t\u2019 like Detroit,\ndidn\u2019t like what was going on there between the brothers, et cetera. And he came to New York\nand once I knew that they were in I wanted to be there also. And he came and he got me. And\nfrom a beautiful home on Davenport Street in Northwest Washington I went with my, I went to a\nwalk up apartment at 91\u2018 and Amsterdam Avenue. Right along with the bedbugs, rats and the\nmice. But you know what I was happy cause we were all together at this point. Then he started\nto, he started to look for work do work. He sold hair ribbons, stockings. If he made two dollars\nhe would spend it to buy then made two more dollars, spent, and bought kept the profits so we\ncould eat and have the rent. We had very little money. We did not come here with bundles of\nmoney. He my mother made hair ribbons and my sister and I helped and various other things\nlike that. And in the meantime all the while looking for some type of work. Without getting too\nwordy on this. About not too many months, not too many months, he found a position\nrepresenting a company that sold basically the same things that he sold in Germany. For the\nterritory that encompassed Washington, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. So he started\nthinking about making the move to Washington so he could be closer to the territory that he was\nto represent. And that was for him a dream come true because he already liked New York. He\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 love it, but he did love Washington. A good reason. It was a beautiful city. It was cleaner\nat that time. Than New York and very much like Hamburg. He always used to say it reminded\nhim, it was that type of city. So I would say within a year\u2019s time we made a move here. And I\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Or is it swim or sink. I don\u2019t know. But I was put into sixth grade which of course I\npromptly flunked because I didn\u2019t know how to talk but I did have a young girl in my class.

And it was, and I liked it. I was\na movie fan in Germany and just a fan of theater and movies theater in Germany so I went to the\nmovies a lot. In New York and of course continued it here.

I have in my possession and I remember getting when we first came to Washington, so we\nwere already in Washington. Sketchy mail, maybe a postcard from my family in Poland. You\nknow my father\u2019s mother wrote and her family wrote for her and my grandfather wrote. So we\nwere already in Washington when we heard about the invasion of Poland. And I have to say that\nit was devastating news to my parents. Hearing that the Germans had marched into Poland. We\nthen knew nothing further. As far as the what happened in Europe, in all of Europe as it became\nwar torn, it was a tragedy it was terrible. Again what happened other than the, the fact that I had\nso much family in Poland but the fact that I had friends over here who at that point being 17, 18\nyears old drafted into the army or signing up for the army maybe, whatever going into service.\nAnd some of them never to come back.

        "A: Primarily the fact that my parents tried very hard to get in touch with their families in Poland.\nNever hearing again. There was conversation that things were very difficult in Poland for our\nfamilies there. We did not and I reiterate did not know all the ramifications of what was\nhappening. But we knew I should say the adults, my parents knew that whatever it was, it\nwasn\u2019t good. And having escaped from that regime ourselves, we knew that whatever was\nhappening wasn\u2019t good. It was a constant fear of what was happening over there. To our\nfamilies. And we\u2019re talking Poland specifically. My father was a news hound. He liked, he\nwanted to listen to the radio constantly when he wasn\u2019t, when he was home. WE didn\u2019t dare talk\nwhile he was listening to the news because he was anxious to know every little bit that there was\nof what was going on in the world. Primarily in Europe and more specifically in Poland. And\nnot a whole to came out. Again, given the lack of knowledge as far as communication is\nconcerned as we know it today. Some things leaked out of course, not leaked out but became\nknown but again things move very swiftly once that Hitler marched into Poland. It was a\nprogression that went along very swiftly as history tells us today. And we all know it. Poland\nwas not the only stop he made. He made quite a few other stops and it was a constant search for\nnews and for us specifically. But of course my father became agitated every country that he\nwent into. That Hitler went into, he was agitated. And he was in a constant state of agitation and\nfrustration. And also making a living, making a living. My mother worked and at 14 I went to\nwork.

At that time we were already in a two bedroom\napartment. To begin with we were four people in a one bedroom apartment. And shortly before\nPearl Harbor we moved to a two bedrooms and at 2:00 I took my bath. And I heard my father\nabout that time yelling that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor. And I did not know where\nPearl Harbor was. Obviously he did. And I quickly got out and I thought what\u2019s going on,\nwhat\u2019s going on and he explained that Pearl Harbor was in Hawaii which was at that time a US\npossession or protectorate. I don\u2019t know what you call it. And essentially we would be at war\nwith the Japanese. I have to tell you though that there was a little bit of a lilt to him, to my dad\nbecause he felt that once the Japanese, once America and at that time Roosevelt had not been\ndeclared but he and his friends and there was lots of talking going on. Once they declared war on\nthe Japanese, as certainly they did it wouldn\u2019t be too long before we would declare war on\nGermany. And they were waiting for that, they were waiting for that. As much as people didn\u2019t\nwant to go war in America or Americans to go to war, people like my dad and at this point we\ntoo felt better get in there. Have to put a stop to what\u2019s going on. So it was horrible, horrible,\nhorrible. And things happened so quickly within a period of two, three days.

For several years I had a\nguttural accent. Germany was not popular. Having a guttural German accent, didn\u2019t exactly\nmake me queen of the day. I fought hard and bitter to lose it, got into fights. Kids made fun of\nme. People that I\u2019m friends with to this day made fun of me and I had, I was a tomboy. I had\nfights with them.

My parents were about, and other people, but\nwe're specifically talking about my family. We knew that many evil things had gone on there\nand I refer to them as evil things as opposed to say anything else. Just how bad and how our\nfamilies were affected, we really didn\u2019t know. It was a nightmare that was going to come true.\nThen we got a telephone call from Sweden, from mother\u2019s sister. Flora Kerner at that time. And,\ntelling us that she and my, her daughter my cousin, Rita, had survived but that everyone else in\nour family had perished. I remember my father being on the telephone and falling to his knees\nbecause he was so very emotionally upset, drained. And very other thing that you can name. It\nwasn\u2019t a long conversation but it was enough so that he got an almost full picture of filling in\ngaps of things that we had only heard about or read about or listened to on the radio and now his\nworst nightmare come true as far as our personal family was concerned.",

They were\nliberated by the British. To get them ready to go to Sweden and I can\u2019t think of the term. It\u2019s\ndisplaced person\u2019s camp they were put in. And that\u2019s where my aunt called from. It took several\ndays after liberation because they were very generous from what I understand about having\nsurvivors call but my aunt had not been well. She had contracted typhus, I believe it was. So it\ntook a few days, maybe not even extra days, but it took time. and there were thousands and\nthousands of extra people in various camps that were trying to reach family all over the world.\nBut she did call us and she told us at that time, she would call us again when they got to Sweden\nbecause that was where they were going.",

These things started late in the\nwar years, or end, towards the end of the war. Don\u2019t forget soldiers were already coming back.\nNot that he met them personally. Some yes, some not, but there was the media and so he did\nknow about camps, crematoriums.

However, always hopeful that perhaps they\nweren\u2019t as touched as so many thousands, millions were. At that point we weren\u2019t thinking in\nterms of millions. We didn\u2019t\u2019 know. At least I didn\u2019t know but we knew that bad things had\nhappened over there. We could only hope that we would get some good news that families had\nsurvived, some of our family if not all had survived. Hearing that they hadn\u2019t other than my\nmother\u2019s sister and her daughter was in one way of course very good news. But in another it was\nhorrific. It was my mother and my father were devastated as was I. At that point already I was on\nmy way, I was and adult just about, an adult already and I remembered being very pained, very,\nvery pained. To say the very least. It\u2019s an awful feeling to hear that all your family that you left\nbehind but two people had perished. And at that time we really didn\u2019t know exactly who died in\nwhich way. We didn\u2019t know that exactly until they came here. And I\u2019m getting ahead but my\naunt and my cousin came here after Sweden, not too in 1946. So about a year, a little over a year\nafter they were liberated. My father brought them home. He, if you like I can tell you when they\ncalled him from Sweden which was maybe a week after their initial call, he immediately went\nand I went with him, this is now 1945. Immediately went to I believe it was the Red Cross. I\nremember going on a Saturday downtown with him and getting, wiring off to the Red Cross and\nthe wire services, $50, which to us was like it would be $5000 today. Got it together and sent it\nto my aunt and my cousin in Sweden. And with which he then went to work to bring them here.\nWhich he did. He had them sponsored by my aunt, the lady that I lived with here. They were\nmoneyed people as I said. He got her to sign the affidavit.

We were basically the same age and in fact we recently talked about this very thing\nI\u2019m telling you now. I asked her, what was it like? What was camp, concentration camp like?\nWell for two hours or more my cousin told me graphically as graphic as she could get exactly\nwhat camp was like, what ghetto was like, what camp was like for her because I have since heard\nother stories but that was my first. And I was absolutely horrified. Talk about nightmares, if I\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 have terrible nightmares before, I sure had them after that. Here was somebody in front\nof me that had lived through these horrors and they were other people that had worse stories.

And they tried the Germans, to\nfor the Red Cross anyway for people who came to put up an appearance that they were doing all\nthat they could, quote unquote. Of course that was all nonsense.

You had just told me about your talk with your cousin when she told you of her\nexperiences in the Holocaust and I wanted to ask you how was the news of the death camps\npresented in this country, in the American media?\nJutta Levy: Well in those days we had newsreels. And which most everyone at this point has\nseen. That\u2019s all we had at the time, well that\u2019s all you have. How was it presented. It was\npresented graphically and with certain amount of disbelief. I think the disbelief is to this day. The\ndisbelief. Not that people didn\u2019t believe it. But my god in heaven, how could this have happened.\nVirtually under our noses. How could such a thing have happened? Never did my family or I\never, ever become used to seeing those pictures or those images. They were shown here not just\nby the news media, in the news and in the movies. Didn\u2019t have television, just yet. But 1t was not\neasy to take. It really was very difficult but the main thing was how was it that this government,\nyou\u2019re talking about the American government, how is it that this could have happened. How\nwas it that they didn\u2019t know. And if they did know why didn\u2019t they do more to help? Why\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 they put a stop to it? As though that was so easy. But these are questions that bubbled up.\nThere was a certain amount of anger amongst people like, like us. How could this have\nhappened. Ok we didn\u2019t know about it. Or we didn\u2019t\u2019 have as much of a clue as maybe the\ngovernments didn\u2019t. What did they do? Why was it allowed to happen? There was anger. There\nis anger today about the very same thing because we\u2019re finding out more and more and more.\nwe\u2019re still finding out.

Anger, sadness.\nDisbelief, just as when my cousin sat and talked to me. I don\u2019t\u2019 think I said a word. For two,\nbetter than two hours and believe me, if you knew me it\u2019s not easy for me not to talk. I was\ntotally in shock at hearing that something like this went on and the world stood by. And now as\nan old woman I have to say how could the world have stood by. I didn\u2019t\u2019 understand it then, I\ndon\u2019t\u2019 understand it now.",
        "Q: Can you make a distinction in your mind. I asked you what the Americans thought and you\nresponded to me but was that a general response for the American people or perhaps was it a\nresponse from the Jewish community. Do you have a sense of I hope I\u2019m making my question\nclear. Do you have a sense of whether it was the general public in the United States that had that\nresponse or was it perhaps a Jewish response that you just described.",
        "A: Well I think primarily it was a Jewish response. However I was still in school. And at that\npoint, 45, 46, I was on my way to college, so I was there was a mix I\u2019m talking about younger\npeople and also older people. I have to say that the people that we were associating with and I\ninclude us as a family I would say that that was a universal attitude. How could this have\nhappened. how. Simple as that, or as complicated as that. How could it have happened?",

        "Q: What were you reactions to the trials and what came out of them.",
        "A: Horror. Horror. I have to be honest with you. To begin, not to begin with, some of I\ncouldn\u2019t, I personally had a hard time even having listened to what my cousin had to say, some\nof the things that came out, I had a very hard time listening to. I had a very hard time watching\nthe visuals, very hard time. Because they are so horrific. My reaction, you don\u2019t want to know\nwhat I think about what, well they never got a chance to really punish. What they should have\ndone to these people there is, I have no answer for it. I really don\u2019t. there isn\u2019t anything that I\ncan think of that reflect of what, how some of these or all of these criminals should have been\npunished. There isn\u2019t a punishment. And I don\u2019t know what, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did you and your friends ever talk about the Nuremberg trials while they were happening?",
        "A: You know if I talk to people like myself, yes. If I talked to Americans not as much. You\nknow when you\u2019re young, you\u2019re in college by that time, its\u2019, it\u2019s not going to be the topic of\nconversation. You know people turn away. They don\u2019t want, the average whether they\u2019re Jewish\nor not they just don\u2019t want to be, they don\u2019t want to think too much about these things. but I have\nto tell you something, I myself was still in the process of, want to be accepted, I want to be like\nthe rest. How much on that, of that can I, can I personally focus on.

        "Q: I\u2019m going to get back to that. I have one more question then I want to get back to just that\npoint. Did you follow the events of partition of Palestine anyway?",
        "A: Yeah we did, I did. I was aware of it. When you say follow, I didn\u2019t read every word on it but\nI was very much aware of what was going on and ultimately the independence. I might add a\nlittle PS. MY cousin Rita and I went down to the what was then the counselor embassy, Israeli\nwhen independence was declared and she and I were even in a huge group picture together. But\nyes I followed the creation of the state of Israel, the partition, you know all that went on, yeah\nfollowed it. Was interested. Was thrilled when independence came. Because I felt along with\nmany other, I can speak for myself I felt my God, the Jews now have a homeland. Not that I\nwanted to go there to live. I was perfectly content here. But we now have a homeland,\nsomething that we didn\u2019t have when we needed it the most.",
        "Q: Now I want to get back to what you were saying before. From your perspective as a refugee\nthat had come to the united States could you see what effect there might have been on the\nAmerican Jewish community as a result of the Holocaust. And the Nuremberg trials and the birth\nof the state of Israel. Did you see any changes in the Jewish community from when you first\narrived.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very tough question because you know for as many people as there are and as many\npeople as I knew not that it is that many, but you get different reactions. Totally different\nreactions. This, I have to tell you amongst a lot of people and Jews too there\u2019s a lot of apathy. I\nthink that\u2019s the right word.

Terrible.\nIt must never happen again. I don\u2019t\u2019 really think that it all sank in. There are too many things\nhappening. Same with the state of Israel. That there are your true Zionists who absolutely were\nthrilled. My father one of them. Thrilled with the fact that there was a state of Israel. But you\nalso found a lot of ok it\u2019s done, let\u2019s get on with it type of attitude. And the ramifications of all\nwhat we\u2019ve been talking about the last few minutes, didn\u2019t\u2019 really come to a, well there\u2019s no\nconcluding cause nothing is over. But the full impact didn\u2019t come til many, many, many years\nlater. I would say as recently as 15 years ago, 20 years ago. That people really began well when\nthose survivors started speaking. They haven\u2019t been talking all that long. I for one started to talk\nabout my own experience when my kids got really involved in their high schools, at Blair High\nschool. The teacher wanted to ask my older daughter who is now 44, is anybody in class who has\na mother or father that is survived the Hitler regime that was from Poland or Germany or\nRomania, or Russia or whatever. And the only one in the class that raised their hand was my\ndaughter. Shannon. And the teacher said well she asked about me and my daughter was told her\nthat oh yes my mom was born in Hamburg Germany and she lived under Hitler for six years. My\nfour year old grandchildren when they were at that age that this Grandma came from Hamburg\nGermany. Hamburger Germany. Anyway she said my, told her that the mom that she was born\nin Hamburg Germany, came over here and the teacher said would your mother be interested in\ntalking and my daughter says I don\u2019t\u2019 know. Anyway teacher called me. And I did talk to all the\nclasses during that year of that and then, and then the teacher. I don\u2019t know if the same teacher\ndid, I did it for my younger daughter also when she four years later followed. But you know up\nuntil except for isolated cases, do you know they didn\u2019t\u2019 speak. The survivors did not speak if\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Who wanted to hear it?",
        "Q: Tell me about your life since the end of the war, about your personal life, your professional\nlife?",
        "A: Well as I told you in the beginning we fluffed over that quickly. I went to work at the age of\n14. First for others. I won\u2019t\u2019 even begin to tell you all the things that I\u2019ve done. But then\nprimarily for my father in his business. I worked hard. I worked with both my parents. My\nfather got sick early on so I ran a business. I have to say that. I ran a business. I got married in\n1952. We held onto that business. My father was very ill, required, he could never get the\nproper life insurance because of his hypertension. We, he had the best of care. we tried very\nmuch, very hard to keep him going but he died at 55. He accomplished a lot in a very short time.\nMarried off two daughters in style, college educated, two daughters at George Washington\nUniversity. Had a home. lived well, way beyond his means. So by the time he died we were\npretty well tapped out. So but we rebounded. My husband went to work for the government. I\nwent to work for various people. In the jewelry business, in the travel business, in a doctor\u2019s\noffice. Too many things to name. We\u2019ve had and I have a, we always have even when my\nparents were alive anice life, pleasant. Problems yes. Always struggling a bit.

I\u2019ve also been involved in the US Holocaust Museum, although not I\u2019m not\na volunteer there because believe it or not I still work a little bit.

        "A: Yes I have.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what that experience was like?",
        "A: I have to tell you that on my own I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 have gone. Had I not been invited and the trip\nbeen paid for I wouldn\u2019t have gone. The city of Hamburg has invited people like myself back\nand two years ago my husband and I went as guests, everything paid for. What was that like?\nThe day I got there I knew how to get back to my apartment. And we took the subway whatever.\nI knew exactly where to get off. It\u2019s amazing how everything came back. I saw the apartment, I\nsaw ultimately the school where I went. Not the public school, the private school. I went into the\nbuilding, into the apartment. I went into the back yard where I had to be so quiet. During our\nrecess. Went to the downtown branch of the school, saw what was left of my synagogue.

The only thing that remains of it is the front of it because it\nwas granite and it had been relatively newly built. They couldn\u2019t burn granite. The Hebrew\nlettering is there and I have pictures of that. What was my you asked me what was my\nimpression going back. The area that I lived in was not bombed or harmed so basically 1t was\nsomewhat frozen in time. The downtown area has was completely bombed and rebuilt. It\u2019s a\nvery rich city moneywise. Pros, prosperous is a better word. I did get to see some special places\nthat we used to go to. I also had the opportunity to go to the concentration camp Bergen Belsen\nwhere to me that\u2019s like a cemetery because people that I knew and loved I think perished there.\nI\u2019m not even sure but certainly my cousin and her mother had survived it. it\u2019s been sanitized. It\u2019s\nbecome like a memorial and I will say that the Germans do visit there because they have very\nfew Jews in Hamburg. Very few. Bergen Belsen is about two hours outside of Hamburg which I\ndidn\u2019t even know. Between Hamburg and Hanover. I didn\u2019t know that. Til I got there. I\u2019ve\nforgotten that you asked me. The overall impression. I was sad. When I left the plane took off\nand I looked down at the city where I was born and I was sad and I cried, the only time I cried.\nOh I shouldn\u2019t\u2019 say that. I did cry in the back yard of the school because it hadn\u2019t changed. But\nwhen we left I cried. Why? I was born there. I grew up there. What I felt they took away my\nchildhood. I had realized it before but it didn\u2019t\u2019 impact me as much as, my husband was sitting\nnext to me on the plane. And it didn\u2019t impact me until I left. They took away my childhood. They\ndid and for that and that\u2019s a small maybe price to pay in view of what others lost but don\u2019t forget\nI lost my family too. But I wasn\u2019t\u2019 in a camp. I didn\u2019t starve. We were very dirt poor when we\nfirst came to New York. All that was do-able and bear-able. But we\u2019re talking about me talking\nabout me and how this whole part of history impacted me yeah it did. They took away my\nchildhood. They took away what might have been for me, education wise. Many things. And\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Because we were kept busy. But then reflecting. I have reflected a lot since I came back. I\nwas cheated also. Cheated. It was, they took away a chunk of my life, a big chunk. And I think\nit has impacted me, the way I act, the way I think and the way I behave, even into my 70s. And\nI\u2019m starting to fill up and I don\u2019t\u2019 want to. It\u2019s sad.",

I know that what I\u2019ve gone through doesn\u2019t\u2019 begin to tell\na whole story, doesn\u2019t\u2019 begin to compare to so many thousands but I have survived the millions\nthat were killed.

        "A: We had to get to Paris. Then we came to the border in Aachen and the Germans gave us one\nlast send off. Took my father off the train as they came through to check the papers. You don\u2019t\ndare move in Europe. There are compartments and from each compartment. Remember we were\nnot the only ones running. There were many people on the train, some with no luggage but many\npeople like us. But they took my father off the train and you don\u2019t dare move. Every time we\nmoved we had everything or my mother or anybody that Nazi out there with the bayonet pointed\nat you and he\u2019s ready. Any excuse, any excuse so let me see my father. He\u2019s talking and he\u2019s\nvery animated and we had no idea. All of a sudden they say the train is going to move and it\nstarted to, move, start to move along slowly and we\u2019re hysterical. There we are. My mother and\ntwo kids and no husband. He\u2019s still talking to the Germans. Finally we saw him run and he got\non the last what do they call it, the end of the train. The man was 40 years old, suffered from\nhigh blood pressure. That he didn\u2019t have a heart attack then was amazing. What did they want\nfrom him. When he finally came into the compartment and told us was they said he had too\nmuch money on him. So he said well then take it. We don\u2019t do that. They didn\u2019t\u2019 offer him an\nalternative. He says well why can\u2019t you take it. He says we are honest, we are honest people. We\ndon\u2019t take money.

Today\u2019s date is\nSeptember 15. This is a continuation of the September 8\" interview with Jutta Levy. This is tape\n2, side A. You have been telling me about your escape from Germany. But I wanted to go back\nand ask about something you had said previously about the last trip to Poland. YOU said it was a\nharrowing trip. Can you tell me about that trip?\nJutta Levy: Well as I may have mentioned we went back at the insistence of my late mother. She\nwanted to have her last goodbyes to her parents and sister and all the relatives. So she took my\nsister and of course me, back to Poland. Now to go to Poland from Hamburg Germany, you get\non the train and you have to go through no man\u2019s land. That\u2019s that stretch of land at that time,\nthat was quote unquote free. That meant passing borders. You\u2019re going through border. Every\nborder stop is a stop and the officials come on board. Well at that time, this is late 38, the\nGermans of course, the Nazis come on board and searched, questioned, very body on the train. I\ndidn\u2019t know at the time what strip search meant. I was a little past 12 years old and I found that\nout in a big hurry. Because of a matronly German woman took the women aside and strip\nsearched them. I was one of them. And if anybody has ever been strip searched and especially\nby an angry, German official of the Nazis, strip searching a young Jewish girl, you can imagine\nwhat that was like. Not pleasant, not nice and without getting graphic very nasty and impersonal.\nIt is one of the most unpleasant experience that I had personally and I think that\u2019s all I\u2019m going\nto say about that. I think one can imagine what that was like. They made it difficult. They let us\ngo but they made it unpleasant, difficult, and also very, very frightening.

But mercifully I did not. They were very thorough about checking our\nluggage, checking us personally but this intense strip search was not repeated. But it was going\nout of Germany to Poland. Why they didn\u2019t do it on the way back quite in that manner I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow. It\u2019s was maybe a fluke or maybe the other was. I don\u2019t know. they were angry people\nthat, I think if they had had the chance they would have thrown us off the train.

        "A: in Hamburg where we lived as I said previously people began disappearing. Especially\npeople, Aust Juden which are the Jews from eastern Europe began disappearing. My parents for\ninstance had a couple. I can even remember their name, Mr. and Mrs. Max Steiner who\ndisappeared. We learned later on I learned later on. My parents knew even before that they were\nrounded up. They were taken away put on a train, sent to what I keep referring to as no man\u2019s\nland in the dead of winter. Told to get off at a given point. Oh they weren\u2019t the only ones. There\nwere hundreds of them. Told to get off the train. And just let go. Chased off the train, let go, in\nthe dead of winter. If the people didn\u2019t move fast enough for them, they were shot. If they\nmanaged to get away, who knows where they went. Some managed to escape to other parts of\nthe world.

At the time that I\u2019m\ntalking about now when we went legally to Poland, legally to Poland. I mean they could have\ndone what they wanted to. But they didn\u2019t. At the time we did not know what had already been,\nthe atrocities that had already been committed. We didn\u2019t\u2019? know. Communications as I\u2019ve said\nbefore was certainly nothing like it, not anywhere near what it is today. Had it been I don\u2019t think\nI'd be having this interview.",
        "A: Heart wrenching. Very heart wrenching. Not because of any dark premonitions, certainly not\non my grandparents, my relatives side. In fact my grandfather was a very intelligent very this is\nnot my maternal grandfather who is a professional man. Very far sighted very ahead of the times.\nBut he could not foresee nor did he the tragedy that was to come to Poland. What was happening\nin Germany he felt as so many people did at that time, not so much anymore with German Jews.\nBut living in Poland was like living in another world here or another, certainly a faraway country\nhere. He just felt that 1t might pass. But he also fully understood why we had to leave given the\ncircumstances I\u2019ve described before. Lack of making a living, the name calling the anti-\nSemitism is a mild word for what was happening. The burning destruction of synagogues. He\nwas well aware of that. So with a lot of understanding he wished us of course the best but was\nsad to let us go. Not just him, all the family. It was a heart wrenching experience, much more so\nfor my mother and it was for my sister and me too. I felt it maybe a little more keenly being older\nand I loved my family there dearly especially my grandparents, my maternal and my paternal\ngrandmother in her, on my father\u2019s side.

We didn\u2019t\u2019 stay long. And again very, very heart\nwrenching. Sad, sad.",
        "A: No. At that visit I wasn\u2019t even exposed all that much. We mainly visited. I also vested with\nmy girlfriend and I had friends over there but especially one who also did survive. Her family did\nnot. No I can\u2019t honestly say. My grandmother still, my maternal grandmother still had help in\nthe house. MY grandfather\u2019s practice was continuing on. No I can\u2019t say at that, don\u2019t\u2019 forget.\nThey were always somewhat anti-Semitic, some a great deal Anti-Semitic. I never felt it to that\nextent. After all I was a visitor.

        "A: Oh yeah they did. And as best I could explained, especially about they were interested in the\nschool, what was happening in school.

        "A: Unbelievable as I have told you. First of all the relief of my father getting back on the train.\nKnowing that momentarily we were crossing into a place that was not Nazi Germany. It\u2019s hard\nto explain when you realize that you can say something without being fearful, being afraid. I told\nyou that life had become full of fear, nervous stomach, that kind of fear. People here are people\nin general unless they went through a similar experience can\u2019t understand.

But \u2019'm more keenly aware of a nervous stomach\nwhich I developed and I still have it. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. it\u2019s fear even to this day of\na uniform. My father had a business here downtown and I\u2019m digressing a little bit and he made\nfriends with all the police which was in downtown Washington years and years and years ago.\nEvery time a police man would come up to collect for something or just to come up and say\nhello, my father froze. Every time a uniform came in during the war. A friend of mine was in\nuniform, whether it be army or navy uniform, especially officers, he froze. Momentarily and I\nhave to tell you I do too. And I wasn\u2019t, I had friends that were in the service, but the moment\nwhen you see a uniform that is the fear that developed over a period of time and you live under a\nregime for that many years. six years 1s a long time.\nsomething that was true in your experience.",
        "A: I think so. And this was before we left. When you hear footsteps at night on marble floors,\nboots, and they\u2019re not, you don\u2019t know but they\u2019re not stopping at your door but they are\nstopping someplace else and you hear conversations and it gets loud you can\u2019t help but take this\nwith you when you go to sleep or if you\u2019re awakened by it. It\u2019s hard then to go back to sleep.\nSure. It\u2019s a, it was a fearful frightful I don\u2019t know how else to say it time in my life. I can seek\nfor myself. Not knowing all the ramifications but knowing enough to be afraid.",
        "A: We went by way of Aachen. It\u2019s near the border where my father was taken off the train. And\nonce you are through that you\u2019re in Belgium. And there\u2019s another stop and more uniforms come\nin. The uniforms at this point though are Belgian officials who spoke French and not German.\nSo once we got past that and they were, they were official, they were to the point but even\nthough we were fearful but there was nothing really to be afraid of at that point but as I said\nbefore, you don\u2019t get over that. Once we got through that border, don\u2019t\u2019 forget there were many\nother people on the train in the compartments other than us that were on the run. Some with only\nthe clothes on their back, no luggage even. But then they started to talk a little bit. Without\nfearing that they would be arrested or they would be overheard for saying something that wasn\u2019t\npolitically correct. And what stuck in my mind to this day is that people smuggled things out. In\nthe most ingenious way. I remember one lady had I don\u2019t\u2019 know if it was a coat or a jacket but\nher big buttons about the size of maybe even bigger than a half a dollar and she was so proud of\nherself, as well she should have been, that she was able to smuggle out diamonds that were\nhidden in the hollow of those buttons and I remember that and I was totally amazed. But in\nretrospect how she got away with that. How they didn\u2019t, I mean this was just one. People had\nother ways of bringing things across. But that, that was one thing that stuck in my mind. That\nthey were so relieved that they almost started to share and I did this and I did that and they were\nsaying, well they were basically trashing the Nazis which they hadn\u2019t been able to do all these\nyears. Being afraid to be overheard or if somebody, if they felt they were with somebody that\nthey could trust and they couldn\u2019t trust them. That was another thing. So you know it goes on\nand on. It goes on and when you live under a regime like that and people like ourselves, people\nlike myself it takes a while to trust again and to say wow I can say this.

I have never ever taken that for granted.",

When I say uneventful, nothing 1s\nuneventful and you\u2019re sitting with people that were running away from a dictatorship such as we\nwere running away from so nothing is uneventful. But we don\u2019t want to be repetitious. I don\u2019t\nwant to be. We got to Paris where my mother had her brother there and we stayed there\nwaiting for the Queen Mary to take us to America. While we were in Paris, an incident\nhappened that really changed the rest of Germany forever. And that was the young Jewish\nfellow. He was a Americanized, Greenspan that was his name and he killed an attach\u00e9 in Paris of\nthe German embassy. Most people are, historians are very much aware of that. This of course\ncaused a tremendous upheaval in Germany and that is a, it culminated what they call here now\nKristallnacht, the night of broken glass because of what this young Jewish fellow did out of\nfrustration, anger and whatever other emotion you can think of and I will say this, go on record\nand have said it before. That was the culmination this Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass.\nThey had been doing these things, certainly in Hamburg and other places in Germany all that\nyear and certainly all that fall and early winter while I was still in Germany. I heard oh yes, store\nfronts being broken into. And I knew of book burnings. I saw some of it. And I what I think we\nmean by Kristallnacht which we were still in Europe then. But 1t was the culmination of and so I\nonly want to say that after that it was a miracle, as it was a miracle with us that we got out of\nGermany at the time that we did.

We\nhad proper papers. After that there was no such thing. He was done with, Hitler was done with\nGerman Jews.

        "A: First of all my father was appalled. I keep referring to my father because he was a very strong\ninfluence in my life. He was, I listened. I listened. When he and my uncle and other, we had\nother relatives in Paris were talking about this incident it was with (pause) regret that this had\nhappened because it put in jeopardy so many people, which of course it did. It also was with\nsome relief that we were out because had the, had we not left exactly when we did. And I mean\nalmost to the minute, I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 be talking to you today. We got out just at the nick of time, six\nhours before the Gestapo came to my house.

And even though I might have\nleft with a lot of sadness leaving behind friends and stuff. And a life. I having had it explained\nto me what was going on at that point and papers being full of it, radio, I was to tell you that I\nwas pretty happy being out of there. Naturally not knowing what was facing us in a new\ncountry, in a new life, but still we did not have to fear for the Nazis. There were other fears. So\nyes, generally that\u2019s the reaction.

I came here with them on the train. They were very nice\npeople. They didn\u2019t\u2019 understand me, I didn\u2019t understand them. They talked Yiddish but German\nand Yiddish people say are so much alike, but if your ear isn\u2019t used to it you don\u2019t understand.\nAnd they tried, maybe a little bit of German but it was I didn\u2019t understand and I had to go with\nthem. And nobody\u2019s going to feel sorry for me because they had a beautiful home. they were\nvery well heeled people. He had a chauffeur driven car in Washington. And so I don\u2019t want\nanybody feeling sorry for me. I just felt sorry for me. It was my heart was aching. I was alone. I\nfelt like I had been left, like I had been abandoned. And so I was not a happy person when I first\ncame here. And I must say even though these people were wonderful, they meant well. The\nUlmans, U-L-M-A-N. They were very good to me. They were generous. But I was very\nunhappy and very lonesome.\nThis is tape 2, side b and you were telling me about being separated from your parents and your\nsister and coming to the Washington DC area with other relatives. How long did you stay apart\nfrom your parents.",
        "A: About nine months. Nine months. Yeah and I want to say that I was comfortable. I had, my\nphysical needs were taken care of. I was treated very well. They sent me to the Americanization\nschool. They bought me a couple of more Americanized clothes. Not much, a little bit. They\nhad other family here from his side. He was, Mr. Ulman was not my blood relative but his wife\nmy aunt, great aunt I might say that part. So his he had family here and they weren\u2019t too nice to\nme but I frankly didn\u2019t\u2019 realize that until I understood a little bit more but they sent me to the\nAmericanization school. Downtown at 13 and New York Avenue. The building is still\nstanding. So I was put in with, I was the only kid there. They were all adults. To say that I\ndisliked it is putting it mildly. I hated it. And I don\u2019t think I got a whole lot out of it because I\nwas frankly unhappy. I cried a lot. I cried myself to sleep. I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I woke up crying. I\nwas lonesome. They tried very hard. I, I need to say that they tried hard and I guess they thought\nI was happy. They had a business here. He took me to the business with him. I had no chores to\ndo. I basically had nothing to do. I would go the Americanization school which was not a good\nexperience for me. They didn\u2019t put me into a school and I wonder, years later why not. But\nthat\u2019s how it went. If my father called I would cry and tell him how unhappy I was and a few\nmonths later he did make a trip to Washington to see me. I did not see my mother that whole\ntime. And he came here and he promised that as soon as he could establish himself somewhere\nand he was hopeful it would be other than Detroit. He didn\u2019t\u2019 like Detroit. We would all get, be\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

So he went\nback to Detroit. About nine months later, maybe a little more but let\u2019s say nine, nine and a half\nmonths later my father did pick up with my mother and my sister and moved to New York. My\nmother had some cousins there. And he felt maybe that would be better. He didn\u2019t\u2019 like Detroit,\ndidn\u2019t like what was going on there between the brothers, et cetera. And he came to New York\nand once I knew that they were in I wanted to be there also. And he came and he got me. And\nfrom a beautiful home on Davenport Street in Northwest Washington I went with my, I went to a\nwalk up apartment at 91\u2018 and Amsterdam Avenue. Right along with the bedbugs, rats and the\nmice. But you know what I was happy cause we were all together at this point. Then he started\nto, he started to look for work do work. He sold hair ribbons, stockings. If he made two dollars\nhe would spend it to buy then made two more dollars, spent, and bought kept the profits so we\ncould eat and have the rent. We had very little money. We did not come here with bundles of\nmoney. He my mother made hair ribbons and my sister and I helped and various other things\nlike that. And in the meantime all the while looking for some type of work. Without getting too\nwordy on this. About not too many months, not too many months, he found a position\nrepresenting a company that sold basically the same things that he sold in Germany. For the\nterritory that encompassed Washington, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. So he started\nthinking about making the move to Washington so he could be closer to the territory that he was\nto represent. And that was for him a dream come true because he already liked New York. He\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 love it, but he did love Washington. A good reason. It was a beautiful city. It was cleaner\nat that time. Than New York and very much like Hamburg. He always used to say it reminded\nhim, it was that type of city. So I would say within a year\u2019s time we made a move here. And I\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Or is it swim or sink. I don\u2019t know. But I was put into sixth grade which of course I\npromptly flunked because I didn\u2019t know how to talk but I did have a young girl in my class. I\nknow her name because she did an autograph. May Corbet who was a black girl who helped me.\nThe only person in that class in New York that helped me. How I don\u2019t even remember. I guess\nwith sign language and little by little I started to learn English. I also listened to the radio a lot.\nAnd went to the movies a lot, a lot. Because that was an escape. And it was, and I liked it. I was\na movie fan in Germany and just a fan of theater and movies theater in Germany so I went to the\nmovies a lot. In New York and of course continued it here. But I did lose some schooling along\nthe way. Number one I didn\u2019t go to school. Number two I flunked and but here I am.",

        "A: What was my, my no I remember I\u2019m a teenager at this point. I want to just go back a little\nbit. I have in my possession and I remember getting when we first came to Washington, so we\nwere already in Washington. Sketchy mail, maybe a postcard from my family in Poland. You\nknow my father\u2019s mother wrote and her family wrote for her and my grandfather wrote. So we\nwere already in Washington when we heard about the invasion of Poland. And I have to say that\nit was devastating news to my parents. Hearing that the Germans had marched into Poland. We\nthen knew nothing further. As far as the what happened in Europe, in all of Europe as it became\nwar torn, it was a tragedy it was terrible. Again what happened other than the, the fact that I had\nso much family in Poland but the fact that I had friends over here who at that point being 17, 18\nyears old drafted into the army or signing up for the army maybe, whatever going into service.\nAnd some of them never to come back. Or hearing almost immediately they were killed.\nBecause already I\u2019m a, at this point I\u2019m a teenager too. And I again have friends that went off to\nwar and never came back.\nwhen American got involved, is there anything in that time frame that stands out in your mind?\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "A: Primarily the fact that my parents tried very hard to get in touch with their families in Poland.\nNever hearing again. There was conversation that things were very difficult in Poland for our\nfamilies there. We did not and I reiterate did not know all the ramifications of what was\nhappening. But we knew I should say the adults, my parents knew that whatever it was, it\nwasn\u2019t good. And having escaped from that regime ourselves, we knew that whatever was\nhappening wasn\u2019t good. It was a constant fear of what was happening over there. To our\nfamilies. And we\u2019re talking Poland specifically. My father was a news hound. He liked, he\nwanted to listen to the radio constantly when he wasn\u2019t, when he was home. WE didn\u2019t dare talk\nwhile he was listening to the news because he was anxious to know every little bit that there was\nof what was going on in the world. Primarily in Europe and more specifically in Poland. And\nnot a whole to came out. Again, given the lack of knowledge as far as communication is\nconcerned as we know it today. Some things leaked out of course, not leaked out but became\nknown but again things move very swiftly once that Hitler marched into Poland. It was a\nprogression that went along very swiftly as history tells us today. And we all know it. Poland\nwas not the only stop he made. He made quite a few other stops and it was a constant search for\nnews and for us specifically. But of course my father became agitated every country that he\nwent into. That Hitler went into, he was agitated. And he was in a constant state of agitation and\nfrustration. And also making a living, making a living. My mother worked and at 14 I went to\nwork. I don\u2019t know what else to say about that period.",
        "A: Oh definitely. Certainly. It was on a Sunday of course as everybody knows. If you must\nknow I was taking a bath. We were four people. At that time we were already in a two bedroom\napartment. To begin with we were four people in a one bedroom apartment. And shortly before\nPearl Harbor we moved to a two bedrooms and at 2:00 I took my bath. And I heard my father\nabout that time yelling that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor. And I did not know where\nPearl Harbor was. Obviously he did. And I quickly got out and I thought what\u2019s going on,\nwhat\u2019s going on and he explained that Pearl Harbor was in Hawaii which was at that time a US\npossession or protectorate. I don\u2019t know what you call it. And essentially we would be at war\nwith the Japanese. I have to tell you though that there was a little bit of a lilt to him, to my dad\nbecause he felt that once the Japanese, once America and at that time Roosevelt had not been\ndeclared but he and his friends and there was lots of talking going on. Once they declared war on\nthe Japanese, as certainly they did it wouldn\u2019t be too long before we would declare war on\nGermany. And they were waiting for that, they were waiting for that. As much as people didn\u2019t\nwant to go war in America or Americans to go to war, people like my dad and at this point we\ntoo felt better get in there. Have to put a stop to what\u2019s going on. So it was horrible, horrible,\nhorrible. And things happened so quickly within a period of two, three days. First Japan, then\nGermany and of course we knew about the Blitzkrieg and we at this time knew I don\u2019t want to\njump ahead of me.",

But we knew there were evil things\ngoing on all over Europe where Hitler had invaded and we certainly knew about, we knew about\nthe French, his marching into France. And we certainly knew about the Blitzkrieg between the\nbombings of London and Britain and what was going on over there. We did. I mean we had\nnews commentators, radio, newspapers so we certainly were aware and it was for that reason\npeople felt, people like my father I don\u2019t want to include all Americans, felt that 1t was time that\nthe Americans took a stand and got involved also.

For several years I had a\nguttural accent. Germany was not popular. Having a guttural German accent, didn\u2019t exactly\nmake me queen of the day.

        "A: Well in Germany of course we knew. Because we left. So we know more or less what had\nhappened in Germany. As far as the countries that he occupied. For instance in for us more\nimportantly Poland, we got a phone call. We knew that things were not good. Things had started\nto come out. My father was very, very concerned. My parents were about, and other people, but\nwe're specifically talking about my family. We knew that many evil things had gone on there\nand I refer to them as evil things as opposed to say anything else. Just how bad and how our\nfamilies were affected, we really didn\u2019t know. It was a nightmare that was going to come true.\nThen we got a telephone call from Sweden, from mother\u2019s sister. Flora Kerner at that time. And,\ntelling us that she and my, her daughter my cousin, Rita, had survived but that everyone else in\nour family had perished. I remember my father being on the telephone and falling to his knees\nbecause he was so very emotionally upset, drained. And very other thing that you can name. It\nwasn\u2019t a long conversation but it was enough so that he got an almost full picture of filling in\ngaps of things that we had only heard about or read about or listened to on the radio and now his\nworst nightmare come true as far as our personal family was concerned.",
        "A: Very shortly after my aunt had my cousin were liberated from Bergen Belsen and I have to\ncorrect myself. They called from the what\u2019s the camp called. Where they put people. They were\nliberated by the British. To get them ready to go to Sweden and I can\u2019t think of the term. It\u2019s\ndisplaced person\u2019s camp they were put in. And that\u2019s where my aunt called from. It took several\ndays after liberation because they were very generous from what I understand about having\nsurvivors call but my aunt had not been well. She had contracted typhus, I believe it was. So it\ntook a few days, maybe not even extra days, but it took time. and there were thousands and\nthousands of extra people in various camps that were trying to reach family all over the world.\nBut she did call us and she told us at that time, she would call us again when they got to Sweden\nbecause that was where they were going.\nphone call.

However, always hopeful that perhaps they\nweren\u2019t as touched as so many thousands, millions were. At that point we weren\u2019t thinking in\nterms of millions. We didn\u2019t\u2019 know. At least I didn\u2019t know but we knew that bad things had\nhappened over there. We could only hope that we would get some good news that families had\nsurvived, some of our family if not all had survived. Hearing that they hadn\u2019t other than my\nmother\u2019s sister and her daughter was in one way of course very good news. But in another it was\nhorrific. It was my mother and my father were devastated as was I. At that point already I was on\nmy way, I was and adult just about, an adult already and I remembered being very pained, very,\nvery pained. To say the very least. It\u2019s an awful feeling to hear that all your family that you left\nbehind but two people had perished. And at that time we really didn\u2019t know exactly who died in\nwhich way. We didn\u2019t know that exactly until they came here.

He, if you like I can tell you when they\ncalled him from Sweden which was maybe a week after their initial call, he immediately went\nand I went with him, this is now 1945. Immediately went to I believe it was the Red Cross. I\nremember going on a Saturday downtown with him and getting, wiring off to the Red Cross and\nthe wire services, $50, which to us was like it would be $5000 today. Got it together and sent it\nto my aunt and my cousin in Sweden. And with which he then went to work to bring them here.\nWhich he did. He had them sponsored by my aunt, the lady that I lived with here. They were\nmoneyed people as I said. He got her to sign the affidavit. She didn\u2019t blink an eye and signed it,\nnot with all the problems that we had. And we tried to get her over here and did of course.

What was camp, concentration camp like?\nWell for two hours or more my cousin told me graphically as graphic as she could get exactly\nwhat camp was like, what ghetto was like, what camp was like for her because I have since heard\nother stories but that was my first. And I was absolutely horrified. Talk about nightmares, if I\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 have terrible nightmares before, I sure had them after that.

You had just told me about your talk with your cousin when she told you of her\nexperiences in the Holocaust and I wanted to ask you how was the news of the death camps\npresented in this country, in the American media?\nJutta Levy: Well in those days we had newsreels. And which most everyone at this point has\nseen. That\u2019s all we had at the time, well that\u2019s all you have. How was it presented. It was\npresented graphically and with certain amount of disbelief. I think the disbelief is to this day. The\ndisbelief. Not that people didn\u2019t believe it. But my god in heaven, how could this have happened.\nVirtually under our noses. How could such a thing have happened? Never did my family or I\never, ever become used to seeing those pictures or those images. They were shown here not just\nby the news media, in the news and in the movies.

It really was very difficult but the main thing was how was it that this government,\nyou\u2019re talking about the American government, how is it that this could have happened. How\nwas it that they didn\u2019t know. And if they did know why didn\u2019t they do more to help? Why\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 they put a stop to it? As though that was so easy.

I have to say that the people that we were associating with and I\ninclude us as a family I would say that that was a universal attitude. How could this have\nhappened. how. Simple as that, or as complicated as that. How could it have happened?",

        "A: Horror. Horror. I have to be honest with you. To begin, not to begin with, some of I\ncouldn\u2019t, I personally had a hard time even having listened to what my cousin had to say, some\nof the things that came out, I had a very hard time listening to. I had a very hard time watching\nthe visuals, very hard time. Because they are so horrific. My reaction, you don\u2019t want to know\nwhat I think about what, well they never got a chance to really punish. What they should have\ndone to these people there is, I have no answer for it. I really don\u2019t. there isn\u2019t anything that I\ncan think of that reflect of what, how some of these or all of these criminals should have been\npunished. There isn\u2019t a punishment. And I don\u2019t know what, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: You know if I talk to people like myself, yes. If I talked to Americans not as much. You\nknow when you\u2019re young, you\u2019re in college by that time, its\u2019, it\u2019s not going to be the topic of\nconversation. You know people turn away.

        "A: Yeah we did, I did. I was aware of it. When you say follow, I didn\u2019t read every word on it but\nI was very much aware of what was going on and ultimately the independence. I might add a\nlittle PS. MY cousin Rita and I went down to the what was then the counselor embassy, Israeli\nwhen independence was declared and she and I were even in a huge group picture together. But\nyes I followed the creation of the state of Israel, the partition, you know all that went on, yeah\nfollowed it. Was interested. Was thrilled when independence came. Because I felt along with\nmany other, I can speak for myself I felt my God, the Jews now have a homeland. Not that I\nwanted to go there to live. I was perfectly content here. But we now have a homeland,\nsomething that we didn\u2019t have when we needed it the most.\nthat had come to the united States could you see what effect there might have been on the\nAmerican Jewish community as a result of the Holocaust.

Totally different\nreactions. This, I have to tell you amongst a lot of people and Jews too there\u2019s a lot of apathy. I\nthink that\u2019s the right word.

Terrible.\nIt must never happen again. I don\u2019t\u2019 really think that it all sank in. There are too many things\nhappening. Same with the state of Israel. That there are your true Zionists who absolutely were\nthrilled. My father one of them. Thrilled with the fact that there was a state of Israel. But you\nalso found a lot of ok it\u2019s done, let\u2019s get on with it type of attitude.

But the full impact didn\u2019t come til many, many, many years\nlater. I would say as recently as 15 years ago, 20 years ago. That people really began well when\nthose survivors started speaking. They haven\u2019t been talking all that long. I for one started to talk\nabout my own experience when my kids got really involved in their high schools, at Blair High\nschool. The teacher wanted to ask my older daughter who is now 44, is anybody in class who has\na mother or father that is survived the Hitler regime that was from Poland or Germany or\nRomania, or Russia or whatever. And the only one in the class that raised their hand was my\ndaughter. Shannon. And the teacher said well she asked about me and my daughter was told her\nthat oh yes my mom was born in Hamburg Germany and she lived under Hitler for six years. My\nfour year old grandchildren when they were at that age that this Grandma came from Hamburg\nGermany. Hamburger Germany. Anyway she said my, told her that the mom that she was born\nin Hamburg Germany, came over here and the teacher said would your mother be interested in\ntalking and my daughter says I don\u2019t\u2019 know. Anyway teacher called me. And I did talk to all the\nclasses during that year of that and then, and then the teacher. I don\u2019t know if the same teacher\ndid, I did it for my younger daughter also when she four years later followed.

I won\u2019t\u2019 even begin to tell you all the things that I\u2019ve done. But then\nprimarily for my father in his business. I worked hard. I worked with both my parents. My\nfather got sick early on so I ran a business. I have to say that. I ran a business. I got married in\n1952. We held onto that business. My father was very ill, required, he could never get the\nproper life insurance because of his hypertension. We, he had the best of care. we tried very\nmuch, very hard to keep him going but he died at 55. He accomplished a lot in a very short time.\nMarried off two daughters in style, college educated, two daughters at George Washington\nUniversity. Had a home. lived well, way beyond his means. So by the time he died we were\npretty well tapped out. So but we rebounded. My husband went to work for the government. I\nwent to work for various people.

The city of Hamburg has invited people like myself back\nand two years ago my husband and I went as guests, everything paid for. What was that like?\nThe day I got there I knew how to get back to my apartment. And we took the subway whatever.\nI knew exactly where to get off. It\u2019s amazing how everything came back. I saw the apartment, I\nsaw ultimately the school where I went. Not the public school, the private school. I went into the\nbuilding, into the apartment. I went into the back yard where I had to be so quiet. During our\nrecess. Went to the downtown branch of the school, saw what was left of my synagogue.

The only thing that remains of it is the front of it because it\nwas granite and it had been relatively newly built. They couldn\u2019t burn granite. The Hebrew\nlettering is there and I have pictures of that. What was my you asked me what was my\nimpression going back. The area that I lived in was not bombed or harmed so basically 1t was\nsomewhat frozen in time. The downtown area has was completely bombed and rebuilt. It\u2019s a\nvery rich city moneywise. Pros, prosperous is a better word. I did get to see some special places\nthat we used to go to. I also had the opportunity to go to the concentration camp Bergen Belsen\nwhere to me that\u2019s like a cemetery because people that I knew and loved I think perished there.\nI\u2019m not even sure but certainly my cousin and her mother had survived it. it\u2019s been sanitized. It\u2019s\nbecome like a memorial and I will say that the Germans do visit there because they have very\nfew Jews in Hamburg. Very few. Bergen Belsen is about two hours outside of Hamburg which I\ndidn\u2019t even know. Between Hamburg and Hanover. I didn\u2019t know that. Til I got there. I\u2019ve\nforgotten that you asked me. The overall impression. I was sad. When I left the plane took off\nand I looked down at the city where I was born and I was sad and I cried, the only time I cried.\nOh I shouldn\u2019t\u2019 say that. I did cry in the back yard of the school because it hadn\u2019t changed. But\nwhen we left I cried. Why? I was born there. I grew up there. What I felt they took away my\nchildhood. I had realized it before but it didn\u2019t\u2019 impact me as much as, my husband was sitting\nnext to me on the plane. And it didn\u2019t impact me until I left. They took away my childhood. They\ndid and for that and that\u2019s a small maybe price to pay in view of what others lost but don\u2019t forget\nI lost my family too. But I wasn\u2019t\u2019 in a camp. I didn\u2019t starve. We were very dirt poor when we\nfirst came to New York. All that was do-able and bear-able. But we\u2019re talking about me talking\nabout me and how this whole part of history impacted me yeah it did. They took away my\nchildhood. They took away what might have been for me, education wise. Many things. And\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Because we were kept busy. But then reflecting. I have reflected a lot since I came back. I\nwas cheated also. Cheated. It was, they took away a chunk of my life, a big chunk. And I think\nit has impacted me, the way I act, the way I think and the way I behave, even into my 70s. And\nI\u2019m starting to fill up and I don\u2019t\u2019 want to. It\u2019s sad.",

I know that what I\u2019ve gone through doesn\u2019t\u2019 begin to tell\na whole story, doesn\u2019t\u2019 begin to compare to so many thousands but I have survived the millions\nthat were killed.
