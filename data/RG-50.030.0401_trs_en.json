        "Q: How do you think having each other kept you going?\nR: All the time I thought about is that it\u2019s -- we survive because we have each other. There were\nsituations when, you know, you were not so strong any more, to go on.\nS: Yeah.",

No, look, she was older as I am, and she\nwas -- I know that she was very friendly to me, she -- and --\nR: The war did that.\nS: The war did, yeah, and then what -- what -- what she told me was right. We didn\u2019t discuss\nsuch things like political things or something very big and very clever, but day to day things,\nthought she knew better than I. What can I -- what can a 15 - 16 - 17 years old teenager know\nabout life? She used to grab me --\nR: But you were -- you were [indecipherable]\nS: -- to her, and to cover my eyes not to see how -- how women were raped.

        "Q: Can you just talk a little bit about that?\nS: [indecipherable]\nR: No. It\u2019s hard to explain how it come, but I -- but I felt a friend in her, in spite of the -- th-the --\nthat I was very devoted to the whole family, I felt a friend, and I like her, and I can\u2019t tell you\nwhy. Even now I can\u2019t know why I like her, but I like her.\nS: No, it\u2019s a -- she\u2019ll -- related like sisters, that is the proper --\nR: But you felt like sister.\nS: Like a -- like a family.\nR: And -- and I am -- I like very much her children, they were devoted.\nS: And they like her.\nR: Yeah.\nS: Yeah, and they --\nR: And my children like her. Even my grandchildren.

They have to come.\nR: [indecipherable] I said yes, the whole family.\nS: Yeah.",

        "Q: I did want to ask, because this has been a bit of a theme. Both of you mentioned that you\nhadn\u2019t talked in a lot of detail to your children. A-And I think you Luta said that -- that you\nhadn't really shared the story with hardly anybody. What made you decide to -- to do it now?\nWhat were your thoughts about it?\nS: I think that Rachel told me about it, and she told me, can we come together? And I thought\nthat -- that no, we are not young already and it comes a time when maybe we have to do it, like\nobligation, not like a -- a goodwill, but obligation. Maybe to leave it for my children, if not for\nthe history, is for my children, because my son is pushing me all the time, but he is not pushing\nme all the time to -- to write about the Holocaust time, but about the family, what -- he doesn\u2019t\nknow the family of course, because they -- he didn\u2019t know his grandparents and so I thought,\nmaybe it\u2019s time, and because she is going, so I\u2019Il go with her.\nR: So we went together.",

If you -- he find you on his way, he will shit --\nR: Shot.\nS: -- he will shot you -- he will shoot you without regret. Anything.\nR: It was the horror of the ghetto if he would standing --\nS: And the Poles wanted him [indecipherable] and the Poles -- the Polish people had the death\npenalty. They would hung him, one, two, three. That what they did to every such a murderer they\nfound.\nR: You know, and he growed up three sons, very educated, very strong, and this came an old Jew\nwho even can\u2019t talk right, you know --\nS: Yeah. [indecipherable]\nR: -- and he is a witness.\nS: They were whispering, they were laughing, and it was horrible.\nR: But that\u2019s what it is.\nS: That\u2019s it.\nR: They destroyed the best.\nS: Yeah, the best they destroyed.

No, look, she was older as I am, and she\nwas -- I know that she was very friendly to me, she -- and --\nR: The war did that.\nS: The war did, yeah, and then what -- what -- what she told me was right. We didn\u2019t discuss\nsuch things like political things or something very big and very clever, but day to day things,\nthought she knew better than I. What can I -- what can a 15 - 16 - 17 years old teenager know\nabout life? She used to grab me --\nR: But you were -- you were [indecipherable]\nS: -- to her, and to cover my eyes not to see how -- how women were raped.

Even now I can\u2019t know why I like her, but I like her.\nS: No, it\u2019s a -- she\u2019ll -- related like sisters, that is the proper --\nR: But you felt like sister.\nS: Like a -- like a family.\nR: And -- and I am -- I like very much her children, they were devoted.\nS: And they like her.\nR: Yeah.\nS: Yeah, and they --\nR: And my children like her.

A-And I think you Luta said that -- that you\nhadn't really shared the story with hardly anybody. What made you decide to -- to do it now?\nWhat were your thoughts about it?\nS: I think that Rachel told me about it, and she told me, can we come together? And I thought\nthat -- that no, we are not young already and it comes a time when maybe we have to do it, like\nobligation, not like a -- a goodwill, but obligation. Maybe to leave it for my children, if not for\nthe history, is for my children, because my son is pushing me all the time, but he is not pushing\nme all the time to -- to write about the Holocaust time, but about the family, what -- he doesn\u2019t\nknow the family of course, because they -- he didn\u2019t know his grandparents and so I thought,\nmaybe it\u2019s time, and because she is going, so I\u2019Il go with her.\nR: So we went together.",

[indecipherable]\nR: -- and he is a witness.\nS: They were whispering, they were laughing, and it was horrible.\nR: But that\u2019s what it is.\nS: That\u2019s it.\nR: They destroyed the best.\nS: Yeah, the best they destroyed. The culture, the Jewish culture of east Europe didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\ncome back. They destroyed. Of course some people, as we survived, and we produced other\npeople, yeah.

        "S: Which will be like, easier for me. That\u2019s it. So the time came and I\u2019m here, and describe the --\na part of -- of this -- of -- it\u2019s a part of the life we had, it\u2019s not everything what -- you cannot\ndescribe every detail, because the days were full with dangerous details and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\namazing that we survived, you know, it -- I don\u2019t know how it was, like -- every step our -- every\nstep, every day, was maybe the last step. Every time we went to appelle st -- to stay on the -- on\nthe appelle, we had to think what is the last, if [indecipherable] last, they will choose us to the\ncrematorium or not? So, it was like that.\nR: As I told you Kathy, that the life of every survivor is an accident.\nS: Yeah, it\u2019s up to [indecipherable]\nR: They can be taken to the oven --\nS: They could.\nR: -- as easily as another one. As I told you, the Yom Kippur action, how close we was --\nS: Yeah.\nR: -- to death. And there were hundreds of situations.\nS: Hundreds, thousands, yeah. So, it\u2019s accident.\nR: We could catch -- we could catch typhus --\nS: Typhus, yeah.\nR: -- very easily.\nS: Oh.\nR: We were surrounded, around, around with people that were very --\nS: [indecipherable] one --\nR: Yeah.\nS: [indecipherable]",
        "R: So it\u2019s a --\nS: It\u2019s the fate.\nR: Here we are.\nS: Yeah, it\u2019s a fate.\nR: [indecipherable] old age.\nS: If you believe in fate, that\u2019s it.\nR: And I want to tell you that I was thinking about to come, and we were -- I al -- an interview,\nand always I was pushing it away.

I th --\nR: -- I was thinking that --\nS: -- I thought that Pll not do it. I don\u2019t have to do it. Why I have to do it? Why I have to go\nthrough that? And it was a --\nR: But now we are --\nS: Yeah.\nR: -- okay. We did it. Let people know.",
        "S: Only we didn\u2019t pay them off. That what I wanted. I want to tell you that after the liberation, I\nwas very sick, that why. But my dream was to belong t -- to a organization, to a terrorist\norganization. And to go from home to home to find out the people who did it for us, and to kill\nthem on the spot. Not a trial, that they didn't trial us. So, that\u2019s it. But I was sick, and my -- my\nhusband quiet me down after that. Sometimes I\u2019m thinking that what we should do because\nthousands of them are having a good life after that. And saying that it\u2019s -- 1t wasn\u2019t a Holocaust.\nDo you know how painful it is? If you survived all the things, horrible things, and lost your\nwhole family, and all people are oh, and say Jews are imagining something like that --\nR: They\u2019re making it up.\nS: -- they\u2019re making it up, and th -- the -- because they wanted to take money from Germany.\nAnd Germany is such a poor country, they would give it for nothing, the money for -- to the\nJews. Germany knows exactly what -- what it was, what they did to us. It\u2019s a -- how many people\nwere sentenced? Were sentenced for life, or sentenced to death? You can count it on the finger.\nAnd the pictures we have, you know, in the museum, how the Germans are holding the pistol,\nwhy they made the pictures of that? It means you like it? What kind of person are you if you like\nto kill others? Kill people what you don\u2019t know, you have no idea whom you are killing, why\nyou are killing? I understand that soldiers are fighting. They are fighting. Two countries are\nfighting and if you don\u2019t kill them, they will kill you, yeah. It\u2019s not good, very bad, but that\u2019s it.\nBut here, civilian women, children, old -- old -- old people. Men without -- without weapons,\nwhat -- who cannot do any harm to you? How could you sleep after that? It means you are not a\nhuman being and you have to be killed. I wouldn\u2019t -- and here the murderers now, I wouldn\u2019t\ntake them to prison and then we are paying for them to -- to keep them in the prison. They are\npaying the taxes because they -- they have a good life in the prison. If you murdered somebody,",
        "you have to be murdered, you have to be killed. There is no other way. That\u2019s my opinion, of\ncourse.\nR: [indecipherable] are worse than the other way.\nS: Yeah, so [indecipherable] of course. And that what it --\nR: What was the --\nS: -- makes me sick that I never did anything to pay off for my father or my mother, or for my\nbrother. That\u2019s it.\nR: You will never be able to do it.\nS: No, of course not.\nR: Otherwise the whole --\nS: Now | am --\nR: -- world would be destroyed.\nS: Now I am not -- not able to do it. I -- I don\u2019t know if I would be able to do it before, but I\nwanted it. Now, somebody ask me not long ago, would you be able to kill? Wa -- what -- if you\nknow? But no --\nR: No.\nS: -- I wouldn\u2019t be able to kill. But I hate it. And that\u2019s it, what I wanted to tell you.\nR: But now is another generation, another people --\nS: Yeah, no, not the young people, not -- oh not the innocent, not Germans is Germans, no. Only\nthe people, if I knew exactly, that they were the murderers. That they m --\nR: But you will never be able to find them.\nS: No, now I-I don\u2019t th-think about -- talk about now.\nR: And even before.",
        "S: Before we could, before we could.\nR: How long -- how long did it take to find Eichmann?\nS: Oh, because nobody looked for him so much. He was only -- he was even a -- he didn't change\nthe name even.\nR: Do you remember that it was a trial? We had to go to the trial --\nS: Actually --\nR: -- from Mora.\nS: -- we -- to Mora -- from Mora. Mora was the hangman of the Wilna ghetto. Of the ghetto in\nWilna. But then, after the liquidation of the Wilna ghetto, he went to Poland, and he was a\nhangman of the Poles. So the Poles wanted him very much, but he was caught by the Russians,\nand he had the trial in Wilna. And then the -- it was not the death penalty in Wilna, in -- in\nRussia, so they -- they sentenced him for life, and he was in Siberia, yeah. Then Stalin died and\nKhrushchev came to power. I don\u2019t know why he decided, probably ha -- asked for some\nprisoners of war, Soviet prisoners of war from Austria, he was from Austria. So he -- he was\ntalking to them and they asked, give us our prisoners [indecipherable] yeah, and he gave it to\nMora. And here -- they promised that they will sentence him also, that his -- it will be a trial in --\nin -- in Vienna, or in his place where he was born. So you know, there are still witnesses alive.\nThey came from Israel, and it was a trial. And he was sitting and his sons were sitting and\nlaughing at the witnesses. One wa -- it was a horrible trial. It was a trial over the witnesses, not\nover him. And he was free. Then they decided he ne -- in a [indecipherable] that they will have --\nfind other witnesses that came to Wilna and we had to be the witnesses. Oh, but then he took a --\na document from the doctor that he is very sick, and the trial never -- he died. He was even the\nmayor in the city, he was -- he lived on -- in. That\u2019s it.",
        "R: And the best people who can stand up for the [indecipherable]\nS: Yeah. Oh yeah. [indecipherable]\nR: You know? So, anyway, you will not change the world.\nS: No.\nR: You read not so long the book about Indians.\nS: Mm-hm.\nR: You see what\u2019s doing? Yeah, yeah.\nS: What will go -- Yugoslavia, yeah.\nR: So, what are you looking for? Yugoslavia --\nS: Israel.\nR: Yeah. But you can\u2019t compare to the Jewish tragedy, because there were tragedies a lot, very\nbig and horrible tragedies.\nS: You don\u2019t have to compare. Let it go.\nR: Yes. But this is a tragedy that\u2019s --\nS: Nothing have to [indecipherable |\nR: -- nobody can, or could escape. Escape only --\nS: Was enough deaths in Yugoslavia also.\nR: -- only escape the people who were hiding and they didn\u2019t find them. Who were not shot\nbecause the last time they have a rule not to shot, which people have to die from the sicknesses.\nAnd that\u2019s it. No other way to survive. No richness, no education, nothing helped to survive a\nperson. And it\u2019s --\nS: Okay, it\u2019s enough.\nR: Thank you.",
