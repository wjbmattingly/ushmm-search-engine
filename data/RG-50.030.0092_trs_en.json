We had to stop. You know how the trains...they were not\nrunning on on a regular time. It was a war, you know. They were afraid that they would\nbomb. Maybe the bridges were bombed, and in the meanwhile, you know, Rostov was\nvery safe already. There was deep...there were Caucausion Mountains, on the ;\non the , SO...and we were there and then they took us to another...1n the\nCaucausion...I forgot the name... , | think.

This is\nagainst the the protection of the...or they put it on top of the roof. You know, they dry it\nbecause it's straw. They burn it and make it make it as a, you know, they put it in the\nfireplaces, and they had to cut this in squares. They started to cry because they're not used\nto it. They never worked in their life, so I said...and you had to make a norm, you know,\nto to get enough food, you know, and I don't know if you know in Russia, you know, you\nhave to make so much, you know, per day. They give you a norm and you have to make\nyour norm, so | had to make...for three women and one man who was a little invalid, so I\nhad to make the norm for them, I remember, and and I used to cut that for them. Besides\nthat I used to work on their combine so I was a real uh, you know...what do you call...a\nhard worker. I don't know what they...what can you say...supported three families down\nthere.",
        "Q: At this time did you go back to uh the partisans?",

He was already in\na uniform. Ah, I wish I could see...(sigh)...and and uh I remember he gave me some\nrubles and then he says I I have here some guys here from Poland. Maybe you're going to\ntalk to them. And those guys were on the train because they were on the station, and they\nwere from my city, Lemberg. They were uh uh drafted to the Russian army, but then they\nbecame uh not the only but they became uh working...uh uh..what they call\nthat...work...working battalion.

        "A: That I'm trying to tell you. So my brother knew who in Lwow was hurting the Jews.\nThat's where I'm trying to go. You know, people...my brother knew. My brother didn't\nhave...he had power but not that power that I had. He was a party man. He didn't have\nthat power what I had cause I was...in in Poland I had...I could uh uh arrest a general. I\nhad a little power, little power. And my brother was telling me, he was telling who helped\nthe Jews, who not helped the Jews, you know, and so we started to to keep like a list...not\na list but a list by...cause I didn't need a list. I just need a face and the name. And we\nstarted talking and then he was uh uh transferred to Breslau, Breslau, the headquarters.\nHe was there with his wife and we started to talk again, because mostly the Polish people\nfrom Ukrainian moved to Breslau. Breslau is...Breslau now, or they moved to Staten (ph)\nor they moved to K , you know, near Krakow, and we started to look around, and I\nlooked around.

        "A: I used to go by car or motorcycle or...I had a car. I I could have a car. Nothing. We used\nto go in and talk to them and take them on the side and just eliminate them, or take them\nin the woods and eliminate them. Not even bury them. Mostly Ukrainian and some Polish\npeople. Even I killed a friend of mine used to go to school from the first grade to second\ngrade.",
        "A: Because they killed Jews. They were killing Jews in the ghetto.",

A lot of Ukrainian...or you go to...a lot of\nUkrainians that came here...you know, they're old now. They're the same age probably as\nme and you know, you can't do nothing. You know, there's a lot in Detroit. They used to\n, Buffalo. They said they're Polish or they...you know...you can do nothing about\nthat.",
        "A: Where did they go? (Laughter) I took them outside. I took them out to the woods and I\nshot them. I didn't ask questions. They knew. They saw me. They knew already. In\nKrakow too. In Krakow they they...you know, there were there were a lot of Jews. They\nused to do business, you know, on the on the square, in Krakow, and there were\nthe Polish invalids, you know. They they wanted money. You know, they were\nblackmailing and they wanted money, and some of them didn't want to give so they used\nto beat them up, you know. So I know I shot three guys right on the square. I I didn't...I\nwasn't afraid, you know. They were anti-Semites, and I wanted to go toa village \u2014__\nnow...",
        "A: I I would like to go visit Poland now (laughter) to take my kids and my wife, you know. I\ndon't know why, but anyway I I...that's what I used to do. My brother and I and a friend. I\nhave a friend here that I have taken...or that Weber (ph) that I let go on the border, he\ndied here, you know. That's what I wanted to...those kind of things. We went to...that\nWeber that I said...",
        "A: That guy, that guy that said uh you are Zygmund Helbling's son on the border, that was\narrested by my corporal now. You know, we met him here in New York many years ago\nand he told my wife I didn't...I never brag about those things, but it was like nothing. He\ntold my wife what I did, how I helped him. He died. He has children here, you know, and\nhe told my wife how I rescued him from the border because he used to smuggle, you\nknow. I had some other people that uh they live some place in Jersey...I don't know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Because I was a political officer, OK, you know. And a political officer...it's like a a\nKGB, you know. In this army we don't have it. Cause I was in this army, we had .\nBut there, they were open, you know. They were . They used to take you out,\nindoctrinate you. They used to take this platoon or this battalion or this company and they\nused to talk to them about Communism and that and that...you know, indoctrinate them to\nbe more...a good Communist.",
        "A: I was not, but I was in that group, you know. Because I was in the Russian army and they\nmade me that. They trusted me. I wasn't even going to fight. I knew they were going to\nPersia. They were going to to Israel and from Israel they went to Italy, . So I went.\nThey...and when I went uh to take a shower, they got me. (Laughter) You know,\nbecause the Polish people don't circumcise, you know.",
        "A: They threw me out. They threw me out on my neck. Not...they didn't tell me why. But\nthen I knew, you know. Now it dawns on me. But meanwhile I I was in the Polish army\nand liberated that, you know. I had I had fights here in the American army I had fights.\nThey call me dirty Jew. I had fights here too, but I never let nobody . Never. Since\nthat time, you know, after after I saw what was happening up there, I found out\nAuschwitz and Treblinka and Dachau. You know, when I was in the army I didn't hear\nthat. After we liberated we hear it. I didn't because I was I was always...uh most of the\ntime I was mostly...most of the time I was a little bit tipsy because I didn't care if I lived\nor not. I didn't care. My life was to me like that . I didn't care. I didn't have nobody,\nyou know. After I found my brother, then it was different, you know, but my life was\nnothing. To me it didn't mean nothing. Not so well. Something had to be done. They\nknew where to go. You know, even...even uh anybody in the Polish army, the Russian\narmy, ..1 got lots of guts, and no brains maybe, you know.",
