        "Q: Start with your childhood.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m wa \u2014 I went to school in \u2014 in Belgium, in Flemish school.\nThe only language I spoke when I was a kid was Flemish and Yiddish, Yiddish,\nbecause \u2014 and then I lived there since 1940 and \u2014 and in 1940 the war broke out.\nAnd I \u2014 when the war broke out, I saw the \u2014 the mobilization, the \u2014 the Belgians\nwere trying to defend the country and they were mobilizing the people on the street,\nand were mobilizing the horses, everything. And they \u2014 they were preparing for the\n\u2014 for this \u2014 for the war. And a couple days later \u2014 my uncle had a bakery, and they\nJuly 23, 2009\ndecide of going to fra \u2014 of leaving Belgium because of the war. And they \u2014 and they\n\u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and they got the tickets for all \u2014 for the entire family to go to France,\nand the next day we left Antwerp, we left everything and we went to Brussels. And\nin Brussels, there were like a \u2014 a lot of people mar \u2014 was a \u2014 was a rush to the\nrailroad station, and up the \u2014 we \u2014 we had to go from the La Gare du Nord to La\nGare du Midi in Brussels to go to France. And it was a\u2014a-\u2014 an - ata-\u2014at the\nrailroad station in Brussels, we got on the train, and the train left for France. And\nwe had our suitcases and everything, we wore our clothing, with all kind of things.\nAnd we went to \u2014 and the train took off, and the \u2014 everything was in the \u2014 1n the \u2014\non alert, no? And a lot of people had gas masks. The f \u2014 the Flemish people, the\nBelgian people had gas mak \u2014 gas masks, but the \u2014 the Jewish population, they were\nconsidered as foreigners, because their parents were not born in Belgium, so they\ndidn\u2019t issue them gas masks, so we were without gas masks. And the train was\nsupposed to go to Paris, but Paris was already in a state of alert, and everything\nwas closed up, so the train passed by Paris and went to the south of France. And\nour \u2014 and on the \u2014 on the way, after we left Paris, the \u2014 there \u2014 the German planes\no-overflew the \u2014 the \u2014 th-the train and bombed \u2014 and bombed. And one train got hi\n\u2014 the tr \u2014 one of the c-car of the train got hit, so they distr \u2014 dislocated the train and\nthey left this, th-the bad part of the train, they removed it from the rails and they\nJuly 23, 2009\nreconnected the train, and we \u2014 and wa \u2014 and we ke \u2014 and we kept going towards\nsouth of France, where wa \u2014 south of France. And on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the road,\nthe train stopped a couple times, and they gave us food. They ga \u2014 they gave us\nbread and little can of pat\u00e9 de foie, pat\u00e9 de foie they gave us, and that was our food\nuntil we got to Toulouse, to Toulouse. In Toulouse th-the train took another road,\nanother, and we went to [indecipherable] that\u2019s near Montpellier. And up there we\n\u2014 we got off the train, and the people were \u2014 made dinners for us. They had like \u2014\noutside \u2014 outside the railroad station was big tables and they \u2014 they gi\u2014 they made\nfood for us. And they \u2014 and we all ate, and then they took us to places to sleep, was\nlike garages, big garages, and like where depot where they \u2014 where they kept\nmerchandise. They removed the merchandise and they made mattresses so we could\nsleep. So we slept there and they \u2014 they fed us, and they gave us \u2014 they helped us,\nthey gave us clothes and everything. And we stayed there for about maybe two\nweeks. And then the French army was in retreat. The French army was in retreat\nand the French army came into town and they took over the school. And they made\nfood, and they fed us too. The French army fed us too. And then I saw \u2014 then they\nhad big lines, and the \u2014 them \u2014 the f \u2014 the French government made an armistice\nwith the German, half of France wer \u2014 France wa \u2014 became divided. Half of\nFrance went over to the Germans, and the other fr \u2014 part of France was free, was a\nJuly 23, 2009\npart of France which was free. And we remained in the free part. And then the\nFrench army, they wanted the \u2014 they gave all the weapons, they rounded up all the\nweapons from the French soldiers, and they turned the \u2014 they put it on a little truck,\nand they \u2014 and it went to the \u2014 to the armistice line. They gave it to the Germans,\nthe weapons, they surrendered, the French surrendered, and the French was left \u2014\nthe fr \u2014 army was left without any weapons, yeah. They g \u2014 they g \u2014 sur \u2014 ga \u2014\nsurrender all the weapons to the enemy. And \u2014 and then we remained in France\nthere, and the free French, and \u2014 and then a lot of \u2014 a couple weeks later, a lot of \u2014a\nlot of people th \u2014 the \u2014 went back to Belgium. They repatriated a lot of people\nbecause they had the armistice, so they had no more war, so they repatriated a lot of\npeople. So most of the Flemish people, the Christians went back to Belgium, and\nsome \u2014 and the Jews remained in France. Some Jews went back too, you know?\nAnd my family remained in France, so we \u2014 we decided to go to Toulouse to look\nfor an apartment. And when we went to Toulouse we got arrested in the streets,\nfrom the French gendarme. They arrested us in the street, and they asked us a\npaper. And my father showed the paper and th-the poli \u2014 the gendarme said, oh,\nthey are Polish, they are Polonais. We said wa \u2014 they asked us what we are doing,\nwe looking for [indecipherable]. So he says yeah, Po-Polonais, so he says, the wi\n\u2014 the woman is Polonais too, because she is married to him, she must be Polish too.\nJuly 23, 2009\nSo my mother didn\u2019t want \u2014 didn\u2019t want to be Polish. So she start f \u2014 arguing with\nthe police that she\u2019s not Polish. So my father said, in Jewish, he says, don\u2019t \u2014 leave\nit alone, because they don\u2019t understand the difference anyway, between Polish and\nRussian, they\u2019re French, you know? So she insisted she didn\u2019t want to be Polish, so\nit started a fight. So the pa \u2014 the gendarmes said, wh-what is going on, what they\nfight? So we \u2014 we said, because she don\u2019t want to be Polish. Oh, she says, okay, so\n\u2014 so that ended the argument and they took us to a \u2014 to a special camp, it used to be\ncalled reci \u2014 Recebedou. And in that camp, they would treat us very nice, they gave\nus even hot chocolate for the kids, we \u2014 they gave a hot chocolate and everything.\nAnd we stayed there about maybe a \u2014 a couple weeks in that camp, and they gave us\nwhere to sleep and food and everything, because it was for the foreigners. The\nFrench kept the foreigners on the side, they didn\u2019t want to be \u2014 they \u2014 mixed with\nthe foreigners, the foreigners, they had their own place for the foreigners, they had\ncamps for the foreigners. And then from Recebedou, they took us to a camp, it\u2019s\ncalled Brenz(ph), n-a-r-b, in th \u2014 France, and it was an island. You had to cross a\nbridge to get there. And on that island was surrounded with \u2014 with rivers, very\nstrong rivers. You couldn\u2019t swim in the river. When you threw a piece of wood, the\npiece of wood just \u2014 the river used to take away a piece of wood and break it, you\nknow, it was like very, very strong river. So we stayed in that camp of Brenz(ph),\nJuly 23, 2009\nwe stayed maybe four or \u2014 four or five months. And from \u2014 from Brenz(ph) they\ntook us to Rivesaltes. They \u2014 they may \u2014 had trains coming in and they loaded all\nthe people. It was like a \u2014 wagons, you know, for the horses, like, and they took us\nto Rivesaltes. And the Rivesaltes was by the coast, by the sea. And \u2014 and\nRivesaltes was a \u2014 a strong camp with \u2014 with a\u2014 a wire, you know, it was \u2014 and\nhad guards with rifles and everything. And \u2014 and Rivesaltes is separate the women\nfrom the men. The women went to a different part of the camp and the men to a\ndifferent camp. And there was no school or nothing, and we \u2014 the kids, we used to\nplay together and oh, every day was the same. And the camp had a lot of lice. After\nbeing there about a week or two, we were like loaded with lice. The lice went in the\nclothes, and where the \u2014 where the clothes is stitched, that\u2019s where the lice used to\nhide. And the \u2014 it was very un \u2014 we used to scratch all day, you know, and finally\nwe used to find the lice and kill the lice. And there was no food. The f\u2014 every day\nthe kitchen \u2014 we had three meals a day, breakfast, we had the little piece of Swiss\ncheese, with bread, and at lunchtime we had navet. Navet is called \u2014 is \u2014 it\u2019s\nturnips. It\u2019s turnip soup and a little \u2014 very \u2014 not even bread, turn \u2014 only turnip soup.\nAnd a -\u2014 in the night, about six o\u2019clock, we had another soup, turnip. Turnip soup.\nAnd we used to eat that every day, that was the food. And \u2014 and then we used to\ncome back to the barracks. The water \u2014 well, there was no water in the barracks,\nJuly 23, 2009\nyou had to go like about maybe a har \u2014 200 meters from the barracks, there was\nwater. And we used to have like a \u2014 a\u2014 an empty si \u2014 can of \u2014 a ration can, you\nknow, from the food. And in there we used to keep our water, we used to put a wire\nround, and that was our water. Okay, we used to wash too, we used to wash up\nthere. It was cold water, there was nothing else. And we had no soap either, there\nwas no soap. And we used to use that water a \u2014 for \u2014 for drinking, everything. And\n\u2014 and then it used to get very windy in the camp, like from the sea, from the\nMediterranean, used to get very windy. That way, you walk down to the barracks,\nyou couldn\u2019t stay out long, the wind used to \u2014 used to blow you. Used to blow you\naway. SO we \u2014 we remained in the barracks most of the time. And it was a army\nbarracks from the French army from years ago, from the second World War. That\u2019s\nwhy they kept the French troops, used to come from north Africa, where they used\nto \u2014 used to come to help France fight the war. And \u2014 and the \u2014 the guards used to\n\u2014 used to watch, there was no way of \u2014 out of the camp. And then my father, they\nused to take the men for hard labor. The men we used to see how they walked them\nto \u2014 to work every day. And the \u2014 and the \u2014 we kids, we used to play, you know, we\nused to play in the camp. And \u2014 and they \u2014 one kid used to tell stories. He \u2014 and he\nused to make te \u2014 he \u2014 about the cowboys, and he used to make the noise like the\nhorse. He was like \u2014 he knew how to tell a story and make the sound too, from the \u2014\nJuly 23, 2009\nthe \u2014 how the horse runs and everything, you know? And he was like the main \u2014 the\nmain kid who used to tell the stories. Every day used to tell different stories of\ndifferent movies. That was our entertainment, no? And \u2014 and \u2014 and then my \u2014 and\nthen my father got a job as a\u2014 I was \u2014 I was in the barrack with my father, and \u2014\nbecause the women were in different side of the barracks. And in the camp was also\na \u2014asi-\u2014 part of the camp were Gypsies, Gypsies. And the other part of the camp\nwere Spanish people from the Civil War. They were like big numbers, the Spanish\npeople from the Civil War. There were maybe in the thousands. And \u2014 and my\nfather got a job as a plumber, out fixing the roofs, he was a roofer too, so he used to\nfix the roof. And in \u2014 1n between, he knew how the \u2014 the \u2014 the road of \u2014 of escape\nfrom the camp, he used to know the road of escape. So he used to \u2014 some people\nused to pay him, and he used to take them out of the camp and he used to make a\ncouple dollars, used to buy a little food outside and bring it back. He had like a little\ncarriage from the \u2014 from our sister, little carriage on four wheels, where the kids sit\nin there, you know? And in there he used to smuggle food on the way back, you\nknow, you know? And I \u2014 I stayed in the camp for about a \u2014 about a year I stayed in\nthe camp, and tow \u2014 towards the end, he told me that he\u2019s gonna leave, because\nsomebody squealed at them that he takes out people. So I told him, take me with\nyou. So he said no, it\u2019s too dangerous, I can\u2019t take you with me. So I insisted and he\nJuly 23, 2009\ntook me with \u2014 with him, and then on the \u2014 on the way out, he took out an old\nwoman \u2014 no, no, an old man, a woman, and a \u2014 and a\u2014 45 - 50, and a \u2014 a little boy\nfrom that woman. And the woman had family in Marseilles, so \u2014 so we went \u2014 she\nknew \u2014 she told us, when we get to Marseilles, we can stay by her brother, okay, he\nlives in Marseilles. So we\u2019re \u2014 at night \u2014 we got out at night, and the truck came in,\nand they saw us leaving, they fired at us, we \u2014 we \u2014 we got in the \u2014 in the ditches,\nand n-nothing hit us. And th-the smoke of the truck, the dust of the truck on the\nsand blinded \u2014 blinded the people on the truck, and we made it to the town Les\nPapiniere(ph), a small town, and up there we got a train. We got a\u2014 we got on the\ntrain and my father paid some money to the \u2014 to the guy in charge of the train, like\nthe railroad chief. He gave him some money and we \u2014 we left, we got to Marseilles,\nand we pass Carcassonne. And I remember Carcassonne, the walls of\nCarcassonne. And we get to Marseille, we couldn\u2019t get out of the rail \u2014 of the\nrailroad station because the \u2014 the railroad station was all guarded with \u2014 with the \u2014\nthe French gar \u2014 the gendarme, and the people from Vichy, the guards. They\u2019re all\nguarded. So we had to go to the restaurant, and we had to \u2014 the women knew who to\nask for, aname \u2014 am-\u2014aman named Harry \u2014 Harry. And he is \u2014 was a waiter in\nthe restaurant.

So \u2014 so then, a little bit later is \u2014\nCossionair(ph), the father was a commander in the French army, and he was a\nprisoner in Germany, and the German government released a lot of \u2014 a lot of\nFrench prisoners, all the officers, they were released. So he came back and we had\nto pick him up in Mont\u00e9limar, we had to pick him up. And when we picked him\nup, he came with other prisoners, but their uniforms were all torn up, they only had\none uniform. And when they were in camp in Germany, they wore that uniform. So\nwhen he came home, his to \u2014 his uniform was all torn up. And I remember that, that\nwe picked him up and we brought him back home. At home he took off his uniform\nand he wore regular clothes, and he could play piano. On the weekend he played\npiano, was a \u2014 was a nice atmosphere in the house. And then \u2014 a-a-and then in the \u2014\nin the \u2014 in the summer, some other kids came to \u2014 to stay with us. All are kids from\nFrench officers, from French officers. They came for the summer because their\nparents were busy, so they came, they had like a vacation with us, you know. And\nthe house was very nice, around the house was a lot of chestnut trees, chestnut trees.\nAnd we used to \u2014 we used to take the chestnut and eat the chestnut. And \u2014 and we\nused to play games outside, you know, with a ball, you know, the \u2014 called ba-\nJuly 23, 2009\nballoon prisonnier; was a special game we used to play. Th-They had two party,\nlike the two camps, and the ca \u2014 the guys in the middle, they were in the middle and\nwe had to hit them with the ball, you know, yeah, it was like a football, you know,\nlike a big ball. And it was very nice there, but th-the \u2014 I got along very good there\nwith the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the big boy who used to come back for \u2014 in the summer, he\nhad no school. He was \u2014 he wanted to be the boss of everybody, and if you didn\u2019t\nlisten to him, you had friction with him. I used to get into fights with him\nsometimes, you know. Bernard, his name was. But \u2014 and then later, maybe a\ncouple weeks later, a kid came from \u2014 he was a son of a French officer, a navy\nofficer, and he slept in my room. And he \u2014 I got friendly with him, and he saw that I\nhave friction with Bernard. So he said, well \u2014 well, what does he want from you? I\nsay, he wants to be the boss. He said, leave him up to me, you know. Because there\nwas a\u2014a girl came from Paris, and she \u2014 Bernard used to \u2014 used to be like his\ncousin, but the gi \u2014 the fr \u2014 the kid from the French officer who came \u2014 stayed with\nus, he liked \u2014 he tried to make conversation with the girl, and Bernard got mad at\nhim. So that caused \u2014 caused friction, so he had a fight with Bernard, and after that\nBernard became like a \u2014 like a lamb, he didn\u2019t \u2014 he had no more power, you know,\nbecause he took over the power, know? And he was my friend, he slept with me in\nthe room, you know. And we used to \u2014 we used to get a \u2014 a ba\u2014 a wash once a\nJuly 23, 2009\nweek, the \u2014 a\u2014 a shower. The \u2014 the dau \u2014 the sister of Mademoiselle Milan(ph)\nused to be in charge of lam \u2014 washing the kids once a week, you know, we used to\nget the shower. And the rest of the week we washed \u2014 washed our teeth by hand,\nyou know, with cold water. And \u2014 and I stayed by Mademoiselle Milan(ph) like\nabout almost two years, you know, almost two years I stayed with her. And my\nfather used to write to me letters. It was in the \u2014 in Yiddish, but not written in\nHebrew, was written in Latin, know? [indecipherable] So I used to get those letters\nfrom him, and then \u2014 and \u2014 and then they deci \u2014 my mother got out of the camp and\nshe joined my father in Tresse, and I was then \u2014 I was \u2014 they brought me back to \u2014\nthey send me back to Tresse. And when I left, I didn\u2019t see Mademoiselle\nMilan(ph). She was a \u2014 because she actually thought I was her son after a while.\nShe\u2019s a \u2014 knit things for me, sweaters and everything. And when I left, I left with a\nsister-in-law of a sister, who came to stay with us, and she took me to Marseilles, to\n[indecipherable] and I met my mother there, at the railroad station. She came to\nMarseilles to pick me up with Lucie. And my mother couldn\u2019t speak French, and I\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 I had forgotten the Jewish \u2014 Yiddish, you know, I\u2019d forgotten Yiddish.\nSo I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I had a hard time speaking to my mother. I spoke in French and\nLucie translated. Lucie learned French, you know, she [indecipherable] and Lucie\ntranslated to my mother, and it took me a couple weeks to get back to the language,\nJuly 23, 2009\nto Yiddish, to speak, because my mother didn\u2019t speak Flemish, she spoke only\nYiddish. I spoke Flemish because I learned Flemish as a kid in Belgium in school.\nSo \u2014 so I came \u2014I came to Tresse, and in Tresse \u2014 I \u2014 I went to school in Tresse.\nAnd I had to \u2014 I\u2014 my Mademoiselle Milan(ph), they spoke of \u2014 her \u2014 th-they had a\nParisian accent in their French. So when they heard the Parisian accent, the kids\nused to make fun of me like I\u2019m a Parisian. So it took me months to get back to \u2014 to\nget \u2014 to get back the accent of \u2014 to get the Marseilles accent, you know, like the\nkids in school. And then I was part of the kids in school, you know, the \u2014 the French\naccent. So then a \u2014 ash \u2014 in tre \u2014 in Tresse | stayed, since I came back from\nMadame Milan(ph), maybe four or five months, and then the ozay(ph) came to us,\nand they took me and Lucie and they took us to San Raphael to \u2014 for \u2014 for the\nsummer, for two months. So I went to [indecipherable] in San Raphael in the \u2014 in\nthe \u2014 I forgot the name of the \u2014 of the camp in San Raphael. You \u2014 you remember\nthe name?\nA2: Villa Marianne.",
        "A: Yeah, Villa Marianna(ph). And up there was a nice villa, where every day we\nused to go to the beach to swim. But we had no food, it was hu \u2014 we were hungry.\nAnd at the beach, we used to wait for \u2014 French couples used to come on the beach,\nand they used to have melon. And when they li \u2014 left the place where they stayed,\nJuly 23, 2009\nthe blanket and everything, they left the melon, you know, cut, the melon. And\nwhen they cut the melon, they just cut the top, and there was like melon left. So we\nused to take that and eat that. That was \u2014 that was a \u2014 a big thing to us to grab the\nmelon from the people when they le \u2014 when they left. And in San Raphael, we \u2014\nwe used to go to school, we had to march to school, maybe about four miles every\nday to school. We had to march in \u2014 in steps. If you didn\u2019t march in steps, the \u2014 the\ncadres(ph) who used to wa-watch you, they used to hit you, you know? One day I\nhad the fight with one of the cadres(ph). Because I wasn\u2019t in step, he got mad at me\nand we had a big fight. And another cadre(ph) came and he fou \u2014 he helped him hit\nme, you know, like \u2014 had like a big fight with him. And in school, we used to eat\nlunch in school, we used to br \u2014 they used to give us a sandwich in school, used to \u2014\nused to take with us a sandwich. And in school there was the kids who came from\nthe farms, and they had big sandwiches. So we used to give them marbles sometime\nand they used to give us a sandwich, because they were not hungry, the kids from\nthe farms. So I used to have a kid who used to give me his sandwich. And I used to\ngive him marbles, different things, bells. And then finally one day he came to\nschool, he wouldn\u2019t give us his sandwich. Cause the sandwich, I used to split it with\nmy other buddies from the \u2014 from the \u2014 from the Villa Marianna(ph). So \u2014 so he\n[indecipherable] I say, why didn \u2014 why didn\u2019t you give us sandwich? He said, my\nJuly 23, 2009\nmother says I shouldn\u2019t give to m \u2014 the sandwich to strange kids, because you\npeople are not French, she say, you know, like he was a little racist. So \u2014 so, when\nhe threw away the sandwich, I got him, and it was like a big barrel in the yard, and I\n\u2014 I pushed his head in the barrel, you know, in order to get the sandwich. So he told\nhis mother that I roughed him up, because we took the sandwich from him. So the\nmother came to school. In those days there was no gasoline, they had horses, and\nthe mother had a nice carriage with a horse like a racing horse, and she had a whip,\nan umbrella, and she had her \u2014 her father on the carriage too. But the father was\nsenile, he was very old. He was on the horse too. And she went to the principal, and\nsh-she argued with the principal that we beat him up, the kids from the Villa\nMarianna(ph) beat him up. So I had to go to see the principal. So the \u2014 the\nprincipal said to me, what\u2019s the matter? How come you hit him beca \u2014 and took his\nsandwich? So I said no, he gave us his sandwich, then he didn\u2019t want to give us his\nsandwich no more. So we \u2014 we were hungry, so we took the san \u2014 so the principal\nexplained to the mother that the kids 1n \u2014 in the \u2014 in the home, they don\u2019t have too\nmuch food, so they dependent on that sandwich. And he \u2014 he gave a \u2014 he gave them\nthe sandwich and then he stopped giving us the sandwich. So the principal made\nbefore that, all that stuff happened, he made conversation with me, and he was in\nthe second World War in Belgium as a soldier, a French soldier. And he was very\nJuly 23, 2009\nfriendly with me because h-he knew Belgium. So he explained to the mother that\nshe gotta speak to the son, it\u2019s not \u2014 they\u2019re not malicious kids, they\u2019re like hungry,\nyou know? So the mother changed \u2014 changed, and she told the kid to give us a\nsandwich. So, since that time, we used to get a sandwich from the kid. It was a big,\nbig country bread. Th-The French used to make bread, round bread like that, like\nthe Italian country bread, y\u2019*know? And the m \u2014 he used to give us a sandwich, and\nri \u2014 1n the beginning we didn\u2019t want to take a sandwich, we didn\u2019t want no trouble\nwith him. He said, no, no, no, the principal knows about it, you can take the\nsandwich and have your sandwich. My mother said I should give you the sandwich.\nSo there was a\u2014a success there with the sandwich, you know, in that school. And\nthen a \u2014 and then a \u2014 at \u2014 I stayed there maybe another month, and then I went back\nto Tresse, to my \u2014 to my father and my mother. And \u2014 and I used to \u2014 I used to go\nsee my father in the mountains, you know, where he used to cut the woods? And\nthat became like the \u2014 the resistance. It became like a stronghold of the resistance.\nAnd then one day \u2014 my mother used to give me food to bring to my father, you\nknow, like food that she made that he liked. And I w \u2014I was on the way to leave\ntown to go to the mountains, a German patrol were in town, German troops. And\nthe patrol, they went with me for awhile, you know, and they ask me where I\u2019m\ngoing. I said to, you know, my grandmother, I\u2019m going to see my grandmother. So,\nJuly 23, 2009\nth-they walked a little bit with me. Maybe somebody squealed that I\u2019m going to see\nmy father. So \u2014 so the \u2014 the German patrol, the German officer heard like noise in\nthe bushes, because there was a lot of lizards there and even snakes. So he says in\nGerman, I understood what he said, he says [speaks German here]. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go\nback. Let\u2019s not go with them, because it\u2019s dangerous areas, like a jungle, he said.\n[speaks German] It means it\u2019s like a jungle. So he \u2014 th-the German patrol stayed in\ntown, they ac \u2014 they walked a little bit with me, maybe 200 meters, and then they\nwent back. So I went by myself up to the mountain. It was a big climb, was like\nmaybe four or five hours until I got up there. And at that time, they derailed a\nGerman train. And when they derailed the German train, there were sardines, they\ncaptured a lot of sardines and weapons. There was trains going to Italy that they\nderailed. And there were \u2014 there were \u2014 the train had sardines and sweet milk,\nbecause the German women who used to go to Italy to meet their husbands, who\nwere in the German army, used to have sweet milk for their babies. And when they\nderailed the train, the French resistance captured a lot of sardines and the sweet\nmilk. So up there I used to eat bread with sweet milk and sardines. And then my\nfather gave me some sardines in a Jar, 1n a jar, sardines, because he didn\u2019t want me\nto bring the cans in town, then th \u2014 th \u2014 if they find the cans, they will know that\nthey derailed the train. So he says, and when you\u2019re finished eating the sardines,\nJuly 23, 2009\nyou bury the jar. So I did that, I buried the jar. But I didn\u2019t bury the jar deep\nenough, so the next week, German troops came and they surrounded the town, and\nthey made \u2014 they took us all on the Place de la Gare in the town, and they used to\nsearch the houses for the \u2014 search the houses for weapons, because they know in the\ntown there\u2019s resistance who derailed the train. So th \u2014 so I buried that \u2014 the jar on\nthe \u2014 on my landlady\u2019s yard, next to us where we lived. And he used \u2014 he went with\nthe dog on the yard, and the dog smelled the sardines, so the dog was barking. So he\ndidn\u2019t want to dig up the yard, you know, the sardine there, so he says to the dog,\ndu verruickt hund. It means, you crazy dog, why are you smelling here?\n[indecipherable] and he kicked the dog. And \u2014 and the dog cried a little bit, and he\n| \u2014 he left with the dog. But if he would every undug that place, he would have find\nthe jar from the sardine, and that could have been dangerous. So the Germans, all\nday they kept the people prisoner, and they searched the houses, but they didn\u2019t find\nnothing, so they left, they left. And then \u2014 and then we st \u2014 1n the town we ast \u2014 we\n\u2014 we stayed under the German occupation. And they came \u2014 they didn\u2019t come all\nthe time, the German, they came once in awhile, and they \u2014 but a lot of Germans\nwent through town to go to Italy, the German convoys. They went to Italy to fight\nthe war, they were fighting the Americans and the British in there. And then they\nlanded in Normandy. They landed in Normandy and then \u2014 the south of France\nJuly 23, 2009\nwas still occupied until August \u2014 until July the 15\", they landed in San Tropez, and\nthey \u2014 and they came up towards \u2014 towards Tresse, but they stayed on the national\nroad. Tresse was liberated by the resistance. And then the [indecipherable] papers\n[indecipherable] you called, that the people should go to the mountains, should go\nto the mountains because the town is gonna have \u2014 can be fighting in the town. So\nthe entire population went to the mountains, the civilian population. But the people\nwent to the mountain, they had food with them. And then we went too, my mother,\nmy two sisters, my father was in the mountain, he didn\u2019t go with us. So we went to\nthe mountains. So we stayed there about two days, and we had no more food, so my\nmother says, take the wheel carriage from your sister, you know, the carriage, and\ngo to town an-and get us \u2014 bring some food. In the \u2014 in the closet, I got some chi-\nchi beans, you know, some the beans, and \u2014 and some melons. And take it, take it o\n\u2014 so we have enough food until \u2014 until the liberation, you know. So I got to town,\nand as I got to town with a friend of mine, a kid, he came with me, the town was all\nempty. It was like a no man \u2014 like a \u2014 like you see from the \u2014 in the town of the\ncowboys where everybody\u2019s gone. So we got to town, and we got to the house and\nwe loaded the wagon with the food, the melons and the \u2014 and the beans, and as we\nwant to go get out of the house, two German armored cars come in, and they \u2014 and\nthey go \u2014 they o \u2014 they \u2014 all the bars were locked, yeah, so they go to one the bars,\nJuly 23, 2009\nrestaurant, and they ripped the doors open. They ripped the doors open and they\ntake out the drink and they put the table outside and they start drinking, the\nGermans, you know? And they were the Germans who were supposed to protect the\ntown, maybe about 30 Germans with \u2014 had \u2014 with the machine guns, the \u2014 all, you\nknow, ready to \u2014 to fight the war. So my friend say, what we gonna do now? We\ncan\u2019t get out. He said, we stay here until night time, at night time, we\u2019ll get out of\nthe town at night time. So we stayed there until it got dark. And as I walked out, the\n\u2014 the carriage made noise, because there was no oil. It made eh, eh, eh. So \u2014 so he\nsays, what are we gonna do, it makes too much noise. So we \u2014 we picked up the\ncarriage and we dragged it a little bit, but then we let 1t down again, and it made\nnoise. The Germans heard the noise, they came running with the machine guns in\nthe dark. We saw them. As kids, you can see good at night. So \u2014 so w-we walked up\nthe hill, we had to \u2014 from the fountain, we had to walk the hill towards the\nmountain. So we saw the German pointing at us, and he \u2014 he starts shooting. So we\nleft the carriage go. The carriage went against a tree, th \u2014 and broke and the melon\nstarts rolling. So the German starts shooting at the melons, he didn\u2019t know what it\nwas. He starts shooting at the melon, and we escaped, you know, we got up in the\nmountain, we came back to the woods. So the kid told the French families that we\nwent down and there is full of Germans. So they said, what are you doing in town?\nJuly 23, 2009\nSo he explains to them, we didn\u2019t have enough food. Said, why didn\u2019t you ask us?\nSo they gave us food, know? And overnight, at night, there was a big for \u2014 a fight\nbetween the Americans and the Germans, like artillery and everything. And then \u2014\nand then the next day they told us that the \u2014 the town is liberated. So we didn\u2019t\nknow, we thought we were the only two 1n the town, but there were the \u2014 the\nresistance was in town too, and they killed all the Germans, the 30 Germans, and\nthey lined them up on the sidewalk like sardines, they\u2019re sardines. And they took\neverything away from them in a blanket. You know, their possession, their rings,\ntheir lighters, their \u2014 their rifles, everything, their machine guns. They\u2019re the\nSchmeisser machine gun, that was the \u2014 the best machine gun. And they took\neverything away, and they were all dead. And then they \u2014 they buried them outside\nthe town, you know, they buried all the Germans, and when we came down from\nthe mountains, they were all dead, y\u2019 know? And \u2014 and then they captured about\nhundred \u2014 200 Germans, prisoners who surrendered to the \u2014 from the \u2014 from\nanother part of the town. And they had them prisoner, and the resistance had to\ninterrogate them. Every German was interrogated. There was [indecipherable]\nfrom the resistance just to write everything down. So they used to use me as\ntranslator, know, and interrogate all these German, everything was written down, all\nthe \u2014 where they\u2019re born, how m \u2014 how many years in the army and everything.\nJuly 23, 2009\nAnd then one German, he was very scared, and he said that he comes from a\nsocialist family, because he noticed that the resistance had the h-hammer and the\nsickle on their he \u2014 on their y \u2014 beret, you know? So \u2014 so he says to \u2014 to me, we c \u2014\nI\u2014we-\u2014Icome from a socialist family, don\u2019t kill us, don\u2019t kill us. So he was afraid\nthe French resistance would kill him. So I told him, he says, yeah, today they\u2019re all\nsocialists, you know? And before, they were all Nazis, now they\u2019re socialists, the\nguy \u2014 the officer of the resistance said. And then \u2014 and then as I interrogate the\nGermans, they took away this guy was very scared, and we interrogate them\nseparately. And he says, the officer of the resistance, he says, ask him where the\nofficers are. He said the officers, they in the wood, they wouldn\u2019t surrender. He say,\nin which wood? He say, in the same wood where you captured us. So we\nsurrounded the woods, and \u2014 and the offer \u2014 one officer came out, they had no food,\nhe came out to eat some grapes outside the woods were \u2014 were grapes. And that was\nthe time when the grapes are ripe, you know, August. So he \u2014 he took in the helmet\nsome grapes and he came back. And they told him to stop, he wouldn\u2019t stop, so they\nshot him. So the other officer came out, he said, Hans, Hans, was ist los? It mean,\nHans, Hans, what happened? So they \u2014 so they told him to stop, so he wouldn\u2019t\nstop, they shot him too. So they brought back the two German officers on the truck.\nThe French truck, by the wheels they have like a \u2014 like a \u2014 the wheel is separated\nJuly 23, 2009\nfrom the motor. There\u2019s like a separation. So they put one officer this way, and one\nofficer that way, and they brought them back to town. And they were bleeding all\non the road, y\u2019 know, because when they got shot? And in town, the people were\ntouching them with branches, you know, the \u2014 was like a big news, that the officers\ngot shot, know? And then \u2014 yeah, see? Again?",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] one more time, sorry.\nEnd of File Two\nJuly 23, 2009\nBeginning File Three",
        "Q: Were they dead, the \u2014 the soldiers?",
        "A: Well, finished with the liberation.",
        "Q: Yeah, let\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Well, no, but you talked about the soldiers and how the people touched them\nwith branches.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were they already dead, or were they \u2014",
        "A: They were dead.",
        "Q: They were dead.",
        "A: They were dead.",
        "Q: Just wait.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "Q: Wait.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: We\u2019re all set.",
        "A: Yeah? So they touched them with branches, and they were on the truck. Then the\n\u2014 the French resistance took off the boots. The boots were leather, and leather was\nlike gold in those days. So most of the kids were barefooted, there was no \u2014 we had\nJuly 23, 2009\nno shoes. So they gave me the boots to make su \u2014 to give it to the shoemaker to\nmake some \u2014 some shoes. So they gave me the boots, and one boot was full of\nblood. So we \u2014 I tried to wash it with my friend by the fountain with powder and\neverything, but we couldn\u2019t get it clean. We couldn\u2019t get it clean, so that boot we\nhad to throw away. But the three other boots, I gave to a Spanish shoemaker who\nlived in the town, he was from the Civil War, he was very good sa \u2014 sh \u2014\nshoemaker. He made me sandals for me and Lucie, you know? Sandals. And the\nsole, he used the sole from the \u2014 the belt from the mines, you know, the rubber belts\nthat they used in the mine for the coal? He used. And the top was all leather from\nthe boots. And he kept the leather, leftover leather he kept it for himself to make\nshoes, so he didn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t cost us nothing, the sandals. So he made sandals for\nme and Lucie and we had the sandals way back to Belgium we had those sandals.\nThey were made like unbelievable. And that was the \u2014 the profit because through\nme they got the German officers. If not they wouldn\u2019t know the German officers\nwere in the woods, you know? So \u2014 and then the \u2014 they had the German prisoners,\nthey didn\u2019t kill them. They turn them over to the Americans much later, know?\nThey use them. Because I met some of those German soldiers who were \u2014 that I\ninterrogate, I met them later in Marseilles. They used to clean the beach, the mines\non the beach. And then in Marseilles \u2014 I came to live in Marseilles. From Tresse I\nJuly 23, 2009\nwent to live in Marseilles. In Marseilles there was no room, there was no\napartments. Through a friend of my father, from the resistance, he \u2014 he was \u2014\nbecame like the mayor of \u2014 of the [indecipherable] Marseilles, and he got a\napartment for us, next to the [indecipherable]. And \u2014 and he s \u2014 and this \u2014 this \u2014\nthis fellow was like the mayor of that district up there, he told my father \u2014 my\nmother was still in town in Tresse, she didn\u2019t come yet to Marseilles. And then\nlater she came to Marseilles, but before she came to Marseilles, he send me to\nSept\u00e9me. Sept\u00e9me is a little town not too far from Marseilles by Aix-en-Provence.\nAnd I stayed by the mayor of Sept\u00e9me, you know, because he was from the\nresistance too. And the mayor from Sept\u00e9me, I slept in his house and I became\nfriendly with his son. And the son used to \u2014 used to go hunting for rabbits and\neverything, I became his friend. In those d \u2014 in that time, France was like a civil\nwar. The French were fighting the French. The French from the resistance were\nfighting the French who were with the Germans in the second World War with\nVichy. And \u2014 and in the next town where I stayed, the \u2014 the French people from\nVichy killed the mayor \u2014 killed the mayor. So he was the \u2014 the son of the mayor\nwas afraid they\u2019re gonna come and kill his ow \u2014 his father, so we slept all night with\na rifle, he had rifles. We slept all night with the rifles underneath the bed. And I was\nscared, I thought something\u2019s gonna happen. So I didn\u2019t sleep all night, I fell asleep\nJuly 23, 2009\nin the morning, you know, in the morning. And then \u2014 and then all the woods were\ncleaned from the \u2014 the guys from \u2014 the people wi \u2014 with the Germans, you know,\nthe Vichy, they cleaned all the woods, and there was \u2014 everything was good, you\nknow, there was no more enemies in the woods, because they cleaned the woods.\nThey used to clean all the woods, the resistance. More resistance came from\nMarseilles, and they helped cleaning the woods, yeah. And then I went back to\nMarseilles where \u2014 then my mother came from the town, and I start living in\nMarseilles. And in Marseilles, | ma\u2014 we were playing soccer, you know, by the\nrailroad station. And the ball went across the fence, to a place where \u2014 where ja \u2014\nthere were German prisoners. German prisoners. So my friends used to know that I\nspeak German, they used to say, Andre, go get the \u2014 go get the ball for \u2014 so I went\nto ge \u2014 ask them for the ball. He says, I\u2019ll give you the ball if you do me one favor,\nthe German prisoner says. Th-Th \u2014 well, I got it from Americans, yeah, and the\nAmericans said, don\u2019t speak too much to them, know? I said was just want to get\nthe ball. Oh. So at that time I couldn\u2019t speak English, you know, we had like\nexplained to him. So we got the ball and he says he wants \u2014 he wants I should buy\nhim some beer. He says, I have no money, he said, but I give you my gold ring. He\ntook out \u2014 he took his wedding ring, a heavy gold ring, and he gave me the gold\nring. And I am gonna take the ring, I figure [indecipherable]. So \u2014 so I \u2014 then my\nJuly 23, 2009\nbuddies, they said to me in French, what does he want? I say, he wants a \u2014 a couple\nbottles of beer. He wants to give the ring. So they said, take the ring, take the ring\nfrom the guy, you know. They\u2019re my buddies, you know, so I took the ring, and I\nbought him \u2014 I bought him some beer. I bought him with some beer and I kept the\nring, I took the ring home, I gave the ring to my mother. And my mother had the\nring th \u2014 the rest of her life she had the ring, yeah. And then later I took out the\ninscription, the German inscription in the ring. And it is just a \u2014 th-they \u2014 like once\nthey were prisoners, the Germans, they were like \u2014 they were like helpless, you\nknow. So then from \u2014 later from Marseilles, we went back to Belgium. We went\nback to Belgium. We lived there about one year in Marseilles, and we went back to\nBelgium. And from Belgium we came to the United States. My aunt made the\npapers for us, she insisted we should come there. And my mother didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t\nsaw her aunt \u2014 my \u2014 her sister since the Russian revolution she didn\u2019t see her sister.\nHer sister lived in the United States. Because originally she came to Belgium when\nshe was a young girl to take the ship t \u2014 for United States, and then she met my\nfather, she remained in Belgium, you know. She got married, she went in Belgium.\nAnd \u2014 and my father didn\u2019t want to go to the States, but he had a lot of arguments\nwith her, finally he gave in and he wen \u2014 we came to the States. And that\u2019s how I\nended up in the States, yeah. And in the States, I lived here about two years, I got\nJuly 23, 2009\ndrafted in the American Army, you know, and they send me to Korea. From Korea\nthey send me to Germany, because I spoke German, they se \u2014 they said, they send\nme to Germany on occupation duty. And I came out of the army, I-I stayed in the\nUnited States because my parents lived here, and th \u2014 and that\u2019s the story, yeah.\nWhat else? Is it \u2014",
        "Q: When \u2014 how was it when you arrived in the United States?",
        "A: When I arrived in the United States, it was tough because I couldn\u2019t speak\nEnglish. Took me time to learn English. And it\u2019s a good thing I \u2014 I had a trade, you\nknow, I start working right away. I-I learned to be a jeweler in Belgium, you know.\nAnd I start working as a jeweler. But I looked younger than my age, and they\nwouldn\u2019t hire me. They wouldn\u2019t hire me, they didn\u2019t believe me that \u2014 and then\nfinally they hired me and I start working. And then I got drafted, you know. And I\ndon\u2019t know, what else? That\u2019s it, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have a family here in \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, ye-ah. I got \u2014 when I came out of the army, I \u2014 I \u2014 I go \u2014 I got married to\nsomebody born from here, you know, an American wo-woman. And I live with her\ntwe \u2014 20 years, I got two daughters with her. And then later, after we divorced, I\nmet my second wife, which is from Guatemala, you know, and I\u2019m married her\nJuly 23, 2009\nnow 10 years, I think. I learned to speak Spanish [indecipherable] in our country,\nyou know. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s it, I-I guess.",
        "Q: Do you have anything else you\u2019d like to add about the war or being at\nRivesaltes? Do you have some other things you might want to add?",
        "A: Yeah, one thing, yeah. When [indecipherable] so in \u2014 when I lived in Tresse,\nmy mother got a letter from a woman living in Marseilles, that she knew from\ncamp. And the woman says, there\u2019s no food here, maybe you people can bring us\nsome food. In Marseilles there was no food. So my mother made like a par \u2014 like a\npackage of food, and I took the bus to Marseilles. In those days, there was only one\nbus going to tr\u2014 Marseilles, and one bus coming home. That\u2019s the communication\nthere was there, from the town to \u2014 to Marseilles. So I came to Marseilles and I\nlooked \u2014 I left a \u2014 the package in the consigne in the \u2014 by the bus stop there was a\nconsigne. You leave the package, and when \u2014 when you\u2019re ready, you go there, you\ntake it out and you gi \u2014 bring it to the people. And I looked for the people. So I\ncame to the house where the people live, and I see the \u2014 the apartment is empty,\nnobody lives there. So, I \u2014 there was a kid playing in front of the door, marbles, so\nplay marbles with him. I said to him, where are the people who live here? He said\noh, he said, the French police took them a couple days ago. He says they \u2014 he says,\nbecause they were Jews. I said, no kidding, you know, like I made believe I don\u2019t\nJuly 23, 2009\nknow what \u2014 I say, what is that? He say, yeah, they believe in another religion. He\nsay, they\u2019re not like us. So he said to me, where you from? I say, I\u2019m from Notre-\nDame de la Garde in Marseilles, you know, the mountain, the church. He says, oh,\nplay with me marbles, and then next time I\u2019Il come to you. I want to play marbles in\nyour neighborhood. So I play marbles with him, and then I saw that \u2014 so I said, well\nI got to \u2014I got to go. He said, Ill go with you. I said, no, I want to \u2014 I got to see my\ngrandmother. If my grandmother knows that I played around, she\u2019s gonna get mad\nat me. He say, I\u2019ll see you next time. He said, yeah, I\u2019Il come and meet you in\nNotre-Dame de la Garde. So I-I went back to the rail \u2014 to the bus stop, and I know\nI can\u2019t deliver the \u2014 the package. So I stayed in the town, and the town was full of\nGermans. They were all going to Africa in those days, they were fighting in Africa.\nThat was like in 1940 \u2014 end of 1942. And the town was full of Germans, and then\nthere was two Italian ships leaving, with the Italian troops. And the Italian people\ncame there with their babies to say goodbye to this \u2014 to the soldiers. And they were\nholding up the babies to the \u2014 to show the soldiers, the Italian soldiers that \u2014 their\nbaby \u2014 and they were yelling, bambino, bambino. And the \u2014 and the German\nsoldiers were guarding the harbor and they were laughing, they were making fun of\nthe Italians because the bambino, you know, they were showing the babies, you\nknow. And I wi \u2014 I witnessed this then, know, in Marseilles, you know. And th-the\nJuly 23, 2009\nGermans were buying things in the harbor and everything, because they were also\nleaving on ships to north Africa, you know. That was the closest I came to the \u2014 to\nthe German troops going to Africa, you know, and Marseilles, yeah. And then at\nnight I went back to my town. And when I went back to my town, the \u2014 a patrol\ncame up on the b \u2014 on the bus and checked everything. And he showed me \u2014 he said\nto me, what are you doing with the food? They notice I got food. I say, yeah, I say,\nI\u2019m \u2014 my grandmother gave me some food to bring to my mother, you know. Yeah,\nyou had to know what to say to them, yeah, because they couldn\u2019t speak \u2014 they\ncouldn\u2019t speak French. That was the only thing which saved everything, because the\nFrench couldn\u2019t speak German and the Germans couldn\u2019t speak French. There was\nsometime one guy who could speak a couple words, but he didn\u2019t know \u2014 you say\ngrandmother, he knew was grosmutter, yeah. Oh, grosmutter, grosmutter, yeah,\nokay. So was a \u2014 there was a look, because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they couldn\u2019t\ncommunicate, yeah, yeah.",

        "A: Oh yeah, that was the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 in \u20141n Tresse, when we came to Tresse, the\nwoman was our landlady, she owned the Hotel de France. And in the Hotel de\nFrance was three prisoners. The king of Morocco, ben Yusef, Bourguiba, who\nwanted to \u2014 to have freedom for Tunisia, and there was a guy, Ali, his last name I\ndon\u2019t remember. And he was \u2014 there were three Arab chiefs who wanted\nindependence from France and the French wouldn\u2019t give them independence, and\nthey kept them there as prisoners. R\u00e9sidents Francais. Every day they had to sign\nby the police, by the gendarme, and they were prisoners there. And being that I\nlived next to the hotel, she \u2014 the woman who owned the hotel was our \u2014 our\nlandlady too. Her name was Madame Laville(ph), and she was very friendly with\nus. I used to go to the garden with her, with a donkey and a \u2014 a carriage. And then\nwe used to come back from the garden, she had a garden outside the si \u2014 the town,\nshe has a couple miles of \u2014 of vin, you know, what\u2019s her name? Grapes, a couple\nmiles of grapes she used to own. And she used to \u2014 we used to bring back grapes or\npeaches. And she said to me, the peaches bring to Bourguiba. The grapes bring to\nben Yusef, the king of Morocco, and the cherries, whatever, the other stuff, she\nsaid, bring it to Ali. They had their own rooms, I used to bring it to them. And the\nJuly 23, 2009\nking of Morocco, he had a man watching him. He had like another ma \u2014 Arab\nwatching him. And the women who used to clean the room, they told me that he\nwas blonde. He wore a little hat so you didn\u2019t see his hair, so they told us that he is\nblonde, he is the only guy, he\u2019s a blonde guy. So we didn\u2019t believe\n[indecipherable] and he was watching the king, ben Yusef. Ben Yusef couldn\u2019t\nspeak French, he only spoke Arabic. Bourguiba spoke French and he helped me\nwith my homework, yeah. And later, one of my friends became the mayor of\nGassin, in France, next to San Tropez. And we went to ga \u2014 when I went to\nGassin to s \u2014 meet my friend \u2014 he used to come to New York to see me too \u2014 he\nsaid to me, I want to write to Bourguiba, I wrote to Bourguiba, he won\u2019t answer\nme. But if I write a letter, you sign it, he will answer you. So he wrote a letter to his\noffice, and I signed it, and Bourguiba answered the letter, that\u2019s the letter I showed\nyou there, that you have now. Yeah.

        "A: Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m wa \u2014 I went to school in \u2014 in Belgium, in Flemish school.\nThe only language I spoke when I was a kid was Flemish and Yiddish, Yiddish,\nbecause \u2014 and then I lived there since 1940 and \u2014 and in 1940 the war broke out.\nAnd I \u2014 when the war broke out, I saw the \u2014 the mobilization, the \u2014 the Belgians\nwere trying to defend the country and they were mobilizing the people on the street,\nand were mobilizing the horses, everything. And they \u2014 they were preparing for the\n\u2014 for this \u2014 for the war. And a couple days later \u2014 my uncle had a bakery, and they\nJuly 23, 2009\ndecide of going to fra \u2014 of leaving Belgium because of the war. And they \u2014 and they\n\u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and they got the tickets for all \u2014 for the entire family to go to France,\nand the next day we left Antwerp, we left everything and we went to Brussels. And\nin Brussels, there were like a \u2014 a lot of people mar \u2014 was a \u2014 was a rush to the\nrailroad station, and up the \u2014 we \u2014 we had to go from the La Gare du Nord to La\nGare du Midi in Brussels to go to France. And it was a\u2014a-\u2014 an - ata-\u2014at the\nrailroad station in Brussels, we got on the train, and the train left for France.

And a lot of people had gas masks. The f \u2014 the Flemish people, the\nBelgian people had gas mak \u2014 gas masks, but the \u2014 the Jewish population, they were\nconsidered as foreigners, because their parents were not born in Belgium, so they\ndidn\u2019t issue them gas masks, so we were without gas masks. And the train was\nsupposed to go to Paris, but Paris was already in a state of alert, and everything\nwas closed up, so the train passed by Paris and went to the south of France. And\nour \u2014 and on the \u2014 on the way, after we left Paris, the \u2014 there \u2014 the German planes\no-overflew the \u2014 the \u2014 th-the train and bombed \u2014 and bombed. And one train got hi\n\u2014 the tr \u2014 one of the c-car of the train got hit, so they distr \u2014 dislocated the train and\nthey left this, th-the bad part of the train, they removed it from the rails and they\nJuly 23, 2009\nreconnected the train, and we \u2014 and wa \u2014 and we ke \u2014 and we kept going towards\nsouth of France, where wa \u2014 south of France. And on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the road,\nthe train stopped a couple times, and they gave us food. They ga \u2014 they gave us\nbread and little can of pat\u00e9 de foie, pat\u00e9 de foie they gave us, and that was our food\nuntil we got to Toulouse, to Toulouse. In Toulouse th-the train took another road,\nanother, and we went to [indecipherable] that\u2019s near Montpellier. And up there we\n\u2014 we got off the train, and the people were \u2014 made dinners for us. They had like \u2014\noutside \u2014 outside the railroad station was big tables and they \u2014 they gi\u2014 they made\nfood for us. And they \u2014 and we all ate, and then they took us to places to sleep, was\nlike garages, big garages, and like where depot where they \u2014 where they kept\nmerchandise. They removed the merchandise and they made mattresses so we could\nsleep. So we slept there and they \u2014 they fed us, and they gave us \u2014 they helped us,\nthey gave us clothes and everything. And we stayed there for about maybe two\nweeks. And then the French army was in retreat. The French army was in retreat\nand the French army came into town and they took over the school. And they made\nfood, and they fed us too. The French army fed us too. And then I saw \u2014 then they\nhad big lines, and the \u2014 them \u2014 the f \u2014 the French government made an armistice\nwith the German, half of France wer \u2014 France wa \u2014 became divided. Half of\nFrance went over to the Germans, and the other fr \u2014 part of France was free, was a\nJuly 23, 2009\npart of France which was free. And we remained in the free part. And then the\nFrench army, they wanted the \u2014 they gave all the weapons, they rounded up all the\nweapons from the French soldiers, and they turned the \u2014 they put it on a little truck,\nand they \u2014 and it went to the \u2014 to the armistice line. They gave it to the Germans,\nthe weapons, they surrendered, the French surrendered, and the French was left \u2014\nthe fr \u2014 army was left without any weapons, yeah. They g \u2014 they g \u2014 sur \u2014 ga \u2014\nsurrender all the weapons to the enemy. And \u2014 and then we remained in France\nthere, and the free French, and \u2014 and then a lot of \u2014 a couple weeks later, a lot of \u2014a\nlot of people th \u2014 the \u2014 went back to Belgium. They repatriated a lot of people\nbecause they had the armistice, so they had no more war, so they repatriated a lot of\npeople. So most of the Flemish people, the Christians went back to Belgium, and\nsome \u2014 and the Jews remained in France. Some Jews went back too, you know?\nAnd my family remained in France, so we \u2014 we decided to go to Toulouse to look\nfor an apartment. And when we went to Toulouse we got arrested in the streets,\nfrom the French gendarme. They arrested us in the street, and they asked us a\npaper. And my father showed the paper and th-the poli \u2014 the gendarme said, oh,\nthey are Polish, they are Polonais. We said wa \u2014 they asked us what we are doing,\nwe looking for [indecipherable]. So he says yeah, Po-Polonais, so he says, the wi\n\u2014 the woman is Polonais too, because she is married to him, she must be Polish too.\nJuly 23, 2009\nSo my mother didn\u2019t want \u2014 didn\u2019t want to be Polish. So she start f \u2014 arguing with\nthe police that she\u2019s not Polish. So my father said, in Jewish, he says, don\u2019t \u2014 leave\nit alone, because they don\u2019t understand the difference anyway, between Polish and\nRussian, they\u2019re French, you know? So she insisted she didn\u2019t want to be Polish, so\nit started a fight. So the pa \u2014 the gendarmes said, wh-what is going on, what they\nfight? So we \u2014 we said, because she don\u2019t want to be Polish. Oh, she says, okay, so\n\u2014 so that ended the argument and they took us to a \u2014 to a special camp, it used to be\ncalled reci \u2014 Recebedou. And in that camp, they would treat us very nice, they gave\nus even hot chocolate for the kids, we \u2014 they gave a hot chocolate and everything.\nAnd we stayed there about maybe a \u2014 a couple weeks in that camp, and they gave us\nwhere to sleep and food and everything, because it was for the foreigners. The\nFrench kept the foreigners on the side, they didn\u2019t want to be \u2014 they \u2014 mixed with\nthe foreigners, the foreigners, they had their own place for the foreigners, they had\ncamps for the foreigners. And then from Recebedou, they took us to a camp, it\u2019s\ncalled Brenz(ph), n-a-r-b, in th \u2014 France, and it was an island. You had to cross a\nbridge to get there. And on that island was surrounded with \u2014 with rivers, very\nstrong rivers. You couldn\u2019t swim in the river. When you threw a piece of wood, the\npiece of wood just \u2014 the river used to take away a piece of wood and break it, you\nknow, it was like very, very strong river. So we stayed in that camp of Brenz(ph),\nJuly 23, 2009\nwe stayed maybe four or \u2014 four or five months. And from \u2014 from Brenz(ph) they\ntook us to Rivesaltes. They \u2014 they may \u2014 had trains coming in and they loaded all\nthe people. It was like a \u2014 wagons, you know, for the horses, like, and they took us\nto Rivesaltes. And the Rivesaltes was by the coast, by the sea. And \u2014 and\nRivesaltes was a \u2014 a strong camp with \u2014 with a\u2014 a wire, you know, it was \u2014 and\nhad guards with rifles and everything. And \u2014 and Rivesaltes is separate the women\nfrom the men. The women went to a different part of the camp and the men to a\ndifferent camp. And there was no school or nothing, and we \u2014 the kids, we used to\nplay together and oh, every day was the same. And the camp had a lot of lice. After\nbeing there about a week or two, we were like loaded with lice. The lice went in the\nclothes, and where the \u2014 where the clothes is stitched, that\u2019s where the lice used to\nhide. And the \u2014 it was very un \u2014 we used to scratch all day, you know, and finally\nwe used to find the lice and kill the lice. And there was no food. The f\u2014 every day\nthe kitchen \u2014 we had three meals a day, breakfast, we had the little piece of Swiss\ncheese, with bread, and at lunchtime we had navet. Navet is called \u2014 is \u2014 it\u2019s\nturnips. It\u2019s turnip soup and a little \u2014 very \u2014 not even bread, turn \u2014 only turnip soup.\nAnd a -\u2014 in the night, about six o\u2019clock, we had another soup, turnip. Turnip soup.\nAnd we used to eat that every day, that was the food. And \u2014 and then we used to\ncome back to the barracks. The water \u2014 well, there was no water in the barracks,\nJuly 23, 2009\nyou had to go like about maybe a har \u2014 200 meters from the barracks, there was\nwater. And we used to have like a \u2014 a\u2014 an empty si \u2014 can of \u2014 a ration can, you\nknow, from the food. And in there we used to keep our water, we used to put a wire\nround, and that was our water. Okay, we used to wash too, we used to wash up\nthere. It was cold water, there was nothing else. And we had no soap either, there\nwas no soap. And we used to use that water a \u2014 for \u2014 for drinking, everything. And\n\u2014 and then it used to get very windy in the camp, like from the sea, from the\nMediterranean, used to get very windy. That way, you walk down to the barracks,\nyou couldn\u2019t stay out long, the wind used to \u2014 used to blow you. Used to blow you\naway. SO we \u2014 we remained in the barracks most of the time. And it was a army\nbarracks from the French army from years ago, from the second World War. That\u2019s\nwhy they kept the French troops, used to come from north Africa, where they used\nto \u2014 used to come to help France fight the war. And \u2014 and the \u2014 the guards used to\n\u2014 used to watch, there was no way of \u2014 out of the camp. And then my father, they\nused to take the men for hard labor. The men we used to see how they walked them\nto \u2014 to work every day. And the \u2014 and the \u2014 we kids, we used to play, you know, we\nused to play in the camp. And \u2014 and they \u2014 one kid used to tell stories. He \u2014 and he\nused to make te \u2014 he \u2014 about the cowboys, and he used to make the noise like the\nhorse. He was like \u2014 he knew how to tell a story and make the sound too, from the \u2014\nJuly 23, 2009\nthe \u2014 how the horse runs and everything, you know? And he was like the main \u2014 the\nmain kid who used to tell the stories. Every day used to tell different stories of\ndifferent movies. That was our entertainment, no? And \u2014 and \u2014 and then my \u2014 and\nthen my father got a job as a\u2014 I was \u2014 I was in the barrack with my father, and \u2014\nbecause the women were in different side of the barracks. And in the camp was also\na \u2014asi-\u2014 part of the camp were Gypsies, Gypsies. And the other part of the camp\nwere Spanish people from the Civil War. They were like big numbers, the Spanish\npeople from the Civil War. There were maybe in the thousands. And \u2014 and my\nfather got a job as a plumber, out fixing the roofs, he was a roofer too, so he used to\nfix the roof. And in \u2014 1n between, he knew how the \u2014 the \u2014 the road of \u2014 of escape\nfrom the camp, he used to know the road of escape. So he used to \u2014 some people\nused to pay him, and he used to take them out of the camp and he used to make a\ncouple dollars, used to buy a little food outside and bring it back. He had like a little\ncarriage from the \u2014 from our sister, little carriage on four wheels, where the kids sit\nin there, you know? And in there he used to smuggle food on the way back, you\nknow, you know? And I \u2014 I stayed in the camp for about a \u2014 about a year I stayed in\nthe camp, and tow \u2014 towards the end, he told me that he\u2019s gonna leave, because\nsomebody squealed at them that he takes out people. So I told him, take me with\nyou. So he said no, it\u2019s too dangerous, I can\u2019t take you with me. So I insisted and he\nJuly 23, 2009\ntook me with \u2014 with him, and then on the \u2014 on the way out, he took out an old\nwoman \u2014 no, no, an old man, a woman, and a \u2014 and a\u2014 45 - 50, and a \u2014 a little boy\nfrom that woman. And the woman had family in Marseilles, so \u2014 so we went \u2014 she\nknew \u2014 she told us, when we get to Marseilles, we can stay by her brother, okay, he\nlives in Marseilles. So we\u2019re \u2014 at night \u2014 we got out at night, and the truck came in,\nand they saw us leaving, they fired at us, we \u2014 we \u2014 we got in the \u2014 in the ditches,\nand n-nothing hit us. And th-the smoke of the truck, the dust of the truck on the\nsand blinded \u2014 blinded the people on the truck, and we made it to the town Les\nPapiniere(ph), a small town, and up there we got a train. We got a\u2014 we got on the\ntrain and my father paid some money to the \u2014 to the guy in charge of the train, like\nthe railroad chief. He gave him some money and we \u2014 we left, we got to Marseilles,\nand we pass Carcassonne. And I remember Carcassonne, the walls of\nCarcassonne. And we get to Marseille, we couldn\u2019t get out of the rail \u2014 of the\nrailroad station because the \u2014 the railroad station was all guarded with \u2014 with the \u2014\nthe French gar \u2014 the gendarme, and the people from Vichy, the guards. They\u2019re all\nguarded. So we had to go to the restaurant, and we had to \u2014 the women knew who to\nask for, aname \u2014 am-\u2014aman named Harry \u2014 Harry. And he is \u2014 was a waiter in\nthe restaurant. And we got to h \u2014 and we got him, and he told us, just have your\ncoffee, and I\u2019m getting a cab and we\u2019re gonna \u2014 gonna take us out of the railroad\nJuly 23, 2009\nstation. And then we got on the cab, and we \u2014 we got out of the railroad station and\n[indecipherable]. And we got out and we got to his house, and they made\nsomething dif \u2014 to eat in the house for us, and there \u2014 his wife took me, she was g \u2014\nto buy bread. She took me with her to shi \u2014 and she took me to the \u2014 to the bakery,\nand I-I was like a dream, because I didn\u2019t see bread for more than a year, I didn\u2019t\nbread like that. And the smell, and the ra \u2014 in the bakery was like unbelievable. And\nthen we bought some bread, we took it home, we ate. And we start living in\nMarseilles. And in Marseilles, we stayed like a couple days by those people, and\nthen we went to \u2014 we got a room in the Hotel Delavain(ph). That was the hotel in r\n\u2014in\u2014in Marseilles, where most of the foreigners used to go and sleep there. And \u2014\nand the hotel used to be also raided by the French police \u2014 by the French police.\nAnd my father was a plumber, he knew the building, and he knew in the \u2014 in the\nwall, or in the ceiling there\u2019s a empty, like \u2014 was like a attic. So we slept in the attic.\nWe slept in the attic, and in the night, they came and they took a lot of people from\nthe hotel, they arrested a lot of people, but we lived in the attic, and they didn\u2019t \u2014\nthey didn\u2019t get us, in the attic of the room. And we stayed in the \u2014 in this Hotel\nDelavain(ph) a ca \u2014 a couple weeks, and then he got \u2014 my father got work in \u2014 in\nthe region of \u2014 of Aix-en-Provence by the \u2014 by Tresse, he got the job there as \u2014 as\nJuly 23, 2009\na bicheron, is a\u2014 is a\u2014 to cut wood and \u2014 wood no \u2014 how you call that in English\nagain?",

And this woman, like a \u2014 I showed\nyou the picture of, she took me there and she left me there. And I was very unhappy\nto be there, because I didn\u2019t know where I was. And that woman, Mademoiselle \u2014\nMademoiselle Milan(ph), she stayed with my mother, Milan(ph), and she took\nover. And I became her like \u2014 her \u2014 I became her \u2014 I say I live in there by her.

        "A: So in school \u2014 in school at that time, the ruler of France was Marshal P\u00e9tain.\nAnd all the kids \u2014 all the kids in school had to \u2014 used to get a picture from Marshal\nP\u00e9tain, and they used to have to write a letter to Marshal P\u00e9tain. And \u2014 and then\nhe used to send th-the kids a picture on a white horse. And also the \u2014 the letter was\nto go to Marshal P\u00e9tain was also \u2014 in secrets, they used to know how many kids go\nto school, what their names was, and everything. It was like \u2014 like a giveaway. So \u2014\nso everybody wrote a letter and I wrote a letter too, but I never got an answer,\nbecause the principal must have torn up my letter, because he was \u2014 Mademoiselle\nMilan(ph) had a \u2014 used to know him very good, and she must have told him, don\u2019t\nsend a letter from the kid to Marshal P\u00e9tain, because, you know, it\u2019s gonna be a\ngiveaway. So wa \u2014 I never got a picture from Marshal P\u00e9tain. And as a kid I felt \u2014\nI felt bad, so the principal gave me an extra letter he had, and it \u2014 it was a\u2014 was a\npicture where it had on the \u2014 on the \u2014 Marshal P\u00e9tain on the white horse. When\nyou are a kid that means a lot to you, you know, yeah. So \u2014 so I went to school in\nthat school, and everything was nice in school there, and every morning in school in\nthose days, you had to sing La Marseillaise. They used to put up the flag. If you\ncame late, you couldn\u2019t go in the yard, you had to stay outside the school until the \u2014\nthey sing the Marseillaise and they put up the flag. Was very pu \u2014 patri \u2014 patriotic\nJuly 23, 2009\ns-school. So I went to this school, and a yo-younger kid from Cossionair(ph) went\nto school with me, went to school. His brother didn\u2019t go to school with me, he went\nto Mont\u00e9limar, to a private school. So \u2014 so then, a little bit later is \u2014\nCossionair(ph), the father was a commander in the French army, and he was a\nprisoner in Germany, and the German government released a lot of \u2014 a lot of\nFrench prisoners, all the officers, they were released. So he came back and we had\nto pick him up in Mont\u00e9limar, we had to pick him up. And when we picked him\nup, he came with other prisoners, but their uniforms were all torn up, they only had\none uniform. And when they were in camp in Germany, they wore that uniform. So\nwhen he came home, his to \u2014 his uniform was all torn up. And I remember that, that\nwe picked him up and we brought him back home. At home he took off his uniform\nand he wore regular clothes, and he could play piano. On the weekend he played\npiano, was a \u2014 was a nice atmosphere in the house. And then \u2014 a-a-and then in the \u2014\nin the \u2014 in the summer, some other kids came to \u2014 to stay with us. All are kids from\nFrench officers, from French officers. They came for the summer because their\nparents were busy, so they came, they had like a vacation with us, you know. And\nthe house was very nice, around the house was a lot of chestnut trees, chestnut trees.\nAnd we used to \u2014 we used to take the chestnut and eat the chestnut. And \u2014 and we\nused to play games outside, you know, with a ball, you know, the \u2014 called ba-\nJuly 23, 2009\nballoon prisonnier; was a special game we used to play. Th-They had two party,\nlike the two camps, and the ca \u2014 the guys in the middle, they were in the middle and\nwe had to hit them with the ball, you know, yeah, it was like a football, you know,\nlike a big ball. And it was very nice there, but th-the \u2014 I got along very good there\nwith the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the big boy who used to come back for \u2014 in the summer, he\nhad no school. He was \u2014 he wanted to be the boss of everybody, and if you didn\u2019t\nlisten to him, you had friction with him. I used to get into fights with him\nsometimes, you know. Bernard, his name was. But \u2014 and then later, maybe a\ncouple weeks later, a kid came from \u2014 he was a son of a French officer, a navy\nofficer, and he slept in my room. And he \u2014 I got friendly with him, and he saw that I\nhave friction with Bernard. So he said, well \u2014 well, what does he want from you? I\nsay, he wants to be the boss. He said, leave him up to me, you know. Because there\nwas a\u2014a girl came from Paris, and she \u2014 Bernard used to \u2014 used to be like his\ncousin, but the gi \u2014 the fr \u2014 the kid from the French officer who came \u2014 stayed with\nus, he liked \u2014 he tried to make conversation with the girl, and Bernard got mad at\nhim. So that caused \u2014 caused friction, so he had a fight with Bernard, and after that\nBernard became like a \u2014 like a lamb, he didn\u2019t \u2014 he had no more power, you know,\nbecause he took over the power, know? And he was my friend, he slept with me in\nthe room, you know. And we used to \u2014 we used to get a \u2014 a ba\u2014 a wash once a\nJuly 23, 2009\nweek, the \u2014 a\u2014 a shower. The \u2014 the dau \u2014 the sister of Mademoiselle Milan(ph)\nused to be in charge of lam \u2014 washing the kids once a week, you know, we used to\nget the shower. And the rest of the week we washed \u2014 washed our teeth by hand,\nyou know, with cold water. And \u2014 and I stayed by Mademoiselle Milan(ph) like\nabout almost two years, you know, almost two years I stayed with her. And my\nfather used to write to me letters. It was in the \u2014 in Yiddish, but not written in\nHebrew, was written in Latin, know? [indecipherable] So I used to get those letters\nfrom him, and then \u2014 and \u2014 and then they deci \u2014 my mother got out of the camp and\nshe joined my father in Tresse, and I was then \u2014 I was \u2014 they brought me back to \u2014\nthey send me back to Tresse. And when I left, I didn\u2019t see Mademoiselle\nMilan(ph). She was a \u2014 because she actually thought I was her son after a while.\nShe\u2019s a \u2014 knit things for me, sweaters and everything. And when I left, I left with a\nsister-in-law of a sister, who came to stay with us, and she took me to Marseilles, to\n[indecipherable] and I met my mother there, at the railroad station. She came to\nMarseilles to pick me up with Lucie. And my mother couldn\u2019t speak French, and I\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 I had forgotten the Jewish \u2014 Yiddish, you know, I\u2019d forgotten Yiddish.\nSo I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I had a hard time speaking to my mother. I spoke in French and\nLucie translated. Lucie learned French, you know, she [indecipherable] and Lucie\ntranslated to my mother, and it took me a couple weeks to get back to the language,\nJuly 23, 2009\nto Yiddish, to speak, because my mother didn\u2019t speak Flemish, she spoke only\nYiddish. I spoke Flemish because I learned Flemish as a kid in Belgium in school.\nSo \u2014 so I came \u2014I came to Tresse, and in Tresse \u2014 I \u2014 I went to school in Tresse.\nAnd I had to \u2014 I\u2014 my Mademoiselle Milan(ph), they spoke of \u2014 her \u2014 th-they had a\nParisian accent in their French. So when they heard the Parisian accent, the kids\nused to make fun of me like I\u2019m a Parisian. So it took me months to get back to \u2014 to\nget \u2014 to get back the accent of \u2014 to get the Marseilles accent, you know, like the\nkids in school. And then I was part of the kids in school, you know, the \u2014 the French\naccent. So then a \u2014 ash \u2014 in tre \u2014 in Tresse | stayed, since I came back from\nMadame Milan(ph), maybe four or five months, and then the ozay(ph) came to us,\nand they took me and Lucie and they took us to San Raphael to \u2014 for \u2014 for the\nsummer, for two months. So I went to [indecipherable] in San Raphael in the \u2014 in\nthe \u2014 I forgot the name of the \u2014 of the camp in San Raphael. You \u2014 you remember\nthe name?\nA2: Villa Marianne.",
        "A: Yeah, Villa Marianna(ph). And up there was a nice villa, where every day we\nused to go to the beach to swim. But we had no food, it was hu \u2014 we were hungry.\nAnd at the beach, we used to wait for \u2014 French couples used to come on the beach,\nand they used to have melon. And when they li \u2014 left the place where they stayed,\nJuly 23, 2009\nthe blanket and everything, they left the melon, you know, cut, the melon. And\nwhen they cut the melon, they just cut the top, and there was like melon left. So we\nused to take that and eat that. That was \u2014 that was a \u2014 a big thing to us to grab the\nmelon from the people when they le \u2014 when they left. And in San Raphael, we \u2014\nwe used to go to school, we had to march to school, maybe about four miles every\nday to school. We had to march in \u2014 in steps. If you didn\u2019t march in steps, the \u2014 the\ncadres(ph) who used to wa-watch you, they used to hit you, you know? One day I\nhad the fight with one of the cadres(ph). Because I wasn\u2019t in step, he got mad at me\nand we had a big fight. And another cadre(ph) came and he fou \u2014 he helped him hit\nme, you know, like \u2014 had like a big fight with him. And in school, we used to eat\nlunch in school, we used to br \u2014 they used to give us a sandwich in school, used to \u2014\nused to take with us a sandwich. And in school there was the kids who came from\nthe farms, and they had big sandwiches. So we used to give them marbles sometime\nand they used to give us a sandwich, because they were not hungry, the kids from\nthe farms. So I used to have a kid who used to give me his sandwich. And I used to\ngive him marbles, different things, bells. And then finally one day he came to\nschool, he wouldn\u2019t give us his sandwich. Cause the sandwich, I used to split it with\nmy other buddies from the \u2014 from the \u2014 from the Villa Marianna(ph). So \u2014 so he\n[indecipherable] I say, why didn \u2014 why didn\u2019t you give us sandwich? He said, my\nJuly 23, 2009\nmother says I shouldn\u2019t give to m \u2014 the sandwich to strange kids, because you\npeople are not French, she say, you know, like he was a little racist. So \u2014 so, when\nhe threw away the sandwich, I got him, and it was like a big barrel in the yard, and I\n\u2014 I pushed his head in the barrel, you know, in order to get the sandwich. So he told\nhis mother that I roughed him up, because we took the sandwich from him. So the\nmother came to school. In those days there was no gasoline, they had horses, and\nthe mother had a nice carriage with a horse like a racing horse, and she had a whip,\nan umbrella, and she had her \u2014 her father on the carriage too. But the father was\nsenile, he was very old. He was on the horse too. And she went to the principal, and\nsh-she argued with the principal that we beat him up, the kids from the Villa\nMarianna(ph) beat him up. So I had to go to see the principal. So the \u2014 the\nprincipal said to me, what\u2019s the matter? How come you hit him beca \u2014 and took his\nsandwich? So I said no, he gave us his sandwich, then he didn\u2019t want to give us his\nsandwich no more. So we \u2014 we were hungry, so we took the san \u2014 so the principal\nexplained to the mother that the kids 1n \u2014 in the \u2014 in the home, they don\u2019t have too\nmuch food, so they dependent on that sandwich. And he \u2014 he gave a \u2014 he gave them\nthe sandwich and then he stopped giving us the sandwich. So the principal made\nbefore that, all that stuff happened, he made conversation with me, and he was in\nthe second World War in Belgium as a soldier, a French soldier. And he was very\nJuly 23, 2009\nfriendly with me because h-he knew Belgium. So he explained to the mother that\nshe gotta speak to the son, it\u2019s not \u2014 they\u2019re not malicious kids, they\u2019re like hungry,\nyou know? So the mother changed \u2014 changed, and she told the kid to give us a\nsandwich. So, since that time, we used to get a sandwich from the kid. It was a big,\nbig country bread. Th-The French used to make bread, round bread like that, like\nthe Italian country bread, y\u2019*know? And the m \u2014 he used to give us a sandwich, and\nri \u2014 1n the beginning we didn\u2019t want to take a sandwich, we didn\u2019t want no trouble\nwith him. He said, no, no, no, the principal knows about it, you can take the\nsandwich and have your sandwich. My mother said I should give you the sandwich.\nSo there was a\u2014a success there with the sandwich, you know, in that school. And\nthen a \u2014 and then a \u2014 at \u2014 I stayed there maybe another month, and then I went back\nto Tresse, to my \u2014 to my father and my mother. And \u2014 and I used to \u2014 I used to go\nsee my father in the mountains, you know, where he used to cut the woods? And\nthat became like the \u2014 the resistance. It became like a stronghold of the resistance.\nAnd then one day \u2014 my mother used to give me food to bring to my father, you\nknow, like food that she made that he liked. And I w \u2014I was on the way to leave\ntown to go to the mountains, a German patrol were in town, German troops. And\nthe patrol, they went with me for awhile, you know, and they ask me where I\u2019m\ngoing. I said to, you know, my grandmother, I\u2019m going to see my grandmother. So,\nJuly 23, 2009\nth-they walked a little bit with me. Maybe somebody squealed that I\u2019m going to see\nmy father. So \u2014 so the \u2014 the German patrol, the German officer heard like noise in\nthe bushes, because there was a lot of lizards there and even snakes. So he says in\nGerman, I understood what he said, he says [speaks German here]. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go\nback. Let\u2019s not go with them, because it\u2019s dangerous areas, like a jungle, he said.\n[speaks German] It means it\u2019s like a jungle. So he \u2014 th-the German patrol stayed in\ntown, they ac \u2014 they walked a little bit with me, maybe 200 meters, and then they\nwent back. So I went by myself up to the mountain. It was a big climb, was like\nmaybe four or five hours until I got up there. And at that time, they derailed a\nGerman train. And when they derailed the German train, there were sardines, they\ncaptured a lot of sardines and weapons. There was trains going to Italy that they\nderailed. And there were \u2014 there were \u2014 the train had sardines and sweet milk,\nbecause the German women who used to go to Italy to meet their husbands, who\nwere in the German army, used to have sweet milk for their babies. And when they\nderailed the train, the French resistance captured a lot of sardines and the sweet\nmilk. So up there I used to eat bread with sweet milk and sardines. And then my\nfather gave me some sardines in a Jar, 1n a jar, sardines, because he didn\u2019t want me\nto bring the cans in town, then th \u2014 th \u2014 if they find the cans, they will know that\nthey derailed the train. So he says, and when you\u2019re finished eating the sardines,\nJuly 23, 2009\nyou bury the jar. So I did that, I buried the jar. But I didn\u2019t bury the jar deep\nenough, so the next week, German troops came and they surrounded the town, and\nthey made \u2014 they took us all on the Place de la Gare in the town, and they used to\nsearch the houses for the \u2014 search the houses for weapons, because they know in the\ntown there\u2019s resistance who derailed the train. So th \u2014 so I buried that \u2014 the jar on\nthe \u2014 on my landlady\u2019s yard, next to us where we lived. And he used \u2014 he went with\nthe dog on the yard, and the dog smelled the sardines, so the dog was barking. So he\ndidn\u2019t want to dig up the yard, you know, the sardine there, so he says to the dog,\ndu verruickt hund. It means, you crazy dog, why are you smelling here?\n[indecipherable] and he kicked the dog. And \u2014 and the dog cried a little bit, and he\n| \u2014 he left with the dog. But if he would every undug that place, he would have find\nthe jar from the sardine, and that could have been dangerous. So the Germans, all\nday they kept the people prisoner, and they searched the houses, but they didn\u2019t find\nnothing, so they left, they left. And then \u2014 and then we st \u2014 1n the town we ast \u2014 we\n\u2014 we stayed under the German occupation. And they came \u2014 they didn\u2019t come all\nthe time, the German, they came once in awhile, and they \u2014 but a lot of Germans\nwent through town to go to Italy, the German convoys. They went to Italy to fight\nthe war, they were fighting the Americans and the British in there. And then they\nlanded in Normandy. They landed in Normandy and then \u2014 the south of France\nJuly 23, 2009\nwas still occupied until August \u2014 until July the 15\", they landed in San Tropez, and\nthey \u2014 and they came up towards \u2014 towards Tresse, but they stayed on the national\nroad. Tresse was liberated by the resistance. And then the [indecipherable] papers\n[indecipherable] you called, that the people should go to the mountains, should go\nto the mountains because the town is gonna have \u2014 can be fighting in the town. So\nthe entire population went to the mountains, the civilian population. But the people\nwent to the mountain, they had food with them. And then we went too, my mother,\nmy two sisters, my father was in the mountain, he didn\u2019t go with us. So we went to\nthe mountains. So we stayed there about two days, and we had no more food, so my\nmother says, take the wheel carriage from your sister, you know, the carriage, and\ngo to town an-and get us \u2014 bring some food. In the \u2014 in the closet, I got some chi-\nchi beans, you know, some the beans, and \u2014 and some melons. And take it, take it o\n\u2014 so we have enough food until \u2014 until the liberation, you know. So I got to town,\nand as I got to town with a friend of mine, a kid, he came with me, the town was all\nempty. It was like a no man \u2014 like a \u2014 like you see from the \u2014 in the town of the\ncowboys where everybody\u2019s gone. So we got to town, and we got to the house and\nwe loaded the wagon with the food, the melons and the \u2014 and the beans, and as we\nwant to go get out of the house, two German armored cars come in, and they \u2014 and\nthey go \u2014 they o \u2014 they \u2014 all the bars were locked, yeah, so they go to one the bars,\nJuly 23, 2009\nrestaurant, and they ripped the doors open. They ripped the doors open and they\ntake out the drink and they put the table outside and they start drinking, the\nGermans, you know? And they were the Germans who were supposed to protect the\ntown, maybe about 30 Germans with \u2014 had \u2014 with the machine guns, the \u2014 all, you\nknow, ready to \u2014 to fight the war. So my friend say, what we gonna do now? We\ncan\u2019t get out. He said, we stay here until night time, at night time, we\u2019ll get out of\nthe town at night time. So we stayed there until it got dark. And as I walked out, the\n\u2014 the carriage made noise, because there was no oil. It made eh, eh, eh. So \u2014 so he\nsays, what are we gonna do, it makes too much noise. So we \u2014 we picked up the\ncarriage and we dragged it a little bit, but then we let 1t down again, and it made\nnoise. The Germans heard the noise, they came running with the machine guns in\nthe dark. We saw them. As kids, you can see good at night. So \u2014 so w-we walked up\nthe hill, we had to \u2014 from the fountain, we had to walk the hill towards the\nmountain. So we saw the German pointing at us, and he \u2014 he starts shooting. So we\nleft the carriage go. The carriage went against a tree, th \u2014 and broke and the melon\nstarts rolling. So the German starts shooting at the melons, he didn\u2019t know what it\nwas. He starts shooting at the melon, and we escaped, you know, we got up in the\nmountain, we came back to the woods. So the kid told the French families that we\nwent down and there is full of Germans. So they said, what are you doing in town?\nJuly 23, 2009\nSo he explains to them, we didn\u2019t have enough food. Said, why didn\u2019t you ask us?\nSo they gave us food, know? And overnight, at night, there was a big for \u2014 a fight\nbetween the Americans and the Germans, like artillery and everything. And then \u2014\nand then the next day they told us that the \u2014 the town is liberated. So we didn\u2019t\nknow, we thought we were the only two 1n the town, but there were the \u2014 the\nresistance was in town too, and they killed all the Germans, the 30 Germans, and\nthey lined them up on the sidewalk like sardines, they\u2019re sardines. And they took\neverything away from them in a blanket. You know, their possession, their rings,\ntheir lighters, their \u2014 their rifles, everything, their machine guns. They\u2019re the\nSchmeisser machine gun, that was the \u2014 the best machine gun. And they took\neverything away, and they were all dead. And then they \u2014 they buried them outside\nthe town, you know, they buried all the Germans, and when we came down from\nthe mountains, they were all dead, y\u2019 know? And \u2014 and then they captured about\nhundred \u2014 200 Germans, prisoners who surrendered to the \u2014 from the \u2014 from\nanother part of the town. And they had them prisoner, and the resistance had to\ninterrogate them. Every German was interrogated. There was [indecipherable]\nfrom the resistance just to write everything down. So they used to use me as\ntranslator, know, and interrogate all these German, everything was written down, all\nthe \u2014 where they\u2019re born, how m \u2014 how many years in the army and everything.\nJuly 23, 2009\nAnd then one German, he was very scared, and he said that he comes from a\nsocialist family, because he noticed that the resistance had the h-hammer and the\nsickle on their he \u2014 on their y \u2014 beret, you know? So \u2014 so he says to \u2014 to me, we c \u2014\nI\u2014we-\u2014Icome from a socialist family, don\u2019t kill us, don\u2019t kill us. So he was afraid\nthe French resistance would kill him. So I told him, he says, yeah, today they\u2019re all\nsocialists, you know? And before, they were all Nazis, now they\u2019re socialists, the\nguy \u2014 the officer of the resistance said. And then \u2014 and then as I interrogate the\nGermans, they took away this guy was very scared, and we interrogate them\nseparately. And he says, the officer of the resistance, he says, ask him where the\nofficers are. He said the officers, they in the wood, they wouldn\u2019t surrender. He say,\nin which wood? He say, in the same wood where you captured us. So we\nsurrounded the woods, and \u2014 and the offer \u2014 one officer came out, they had no food,\nhe came out to eat some grapes outside the woods were \u2014 were grapes. And that was\nthe time when the grapes are ripe, you know, August. So he \u2014 he took in the helmet\nsome grapes and he came back. And they told him to stop, he wouldn\u2019t stop, so they\nshot him. So the other officer came out, he said, Hans, Hans, was ist los? It mean,\nHans, Hans, what happened? So they \u2014 so they told him to stop, so he wouldn\u2019t\nstop, they shot him too. So they brought back the two German officers on the truck.\nThe French truck, by the wheels they have like a \u2014 like a \u2014 the wheel is separated\nJuly 23, 2009\nfrom the motor. There\u2019s like a separation. So they put one officer this way, and one\nofficer that way, and they brought them back to town. And they were bleeding all\non the road, y\u2019 know, because when they got shot? And in town, the people were\ntouching them with branches, you know, the \u2014 was like a big news, that the officers\ngot shot, know? And then \u2014 yeah, see? Again?",
        "A: It\u2019s all right.\nBeginning File Three",
        "A: Well, finished with the liberation.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They were dead.",
        "A: They were dead.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah? So they touched them with branches, and they were on the truck. Then the\n\u2014 the French resistance took off the boots. The boots were leather, and leather was\nlike gold in those days. So most of the kids were barefooted, there was no \u2014 we had\nJuly 23, 2009\nno shoes. So they gave me the boots to make su \u2014 to give it to the shoemaker to\nmake some \u2014 some shoes. So they gave me the boots, and one boot was full of\nblood. So we \u2014 I tried to wash it with my friend by the fountain with powder and\neverything, but we couldn\u2019t get it clean. We couldn\u2019t get it clean, so that boot we\nhad to throw away. But the three other boots, I gave to a Spanish shoemaker who\nlived in the town, he was from the Civil War, he was very good sa \u2014 sh \u2014\nshoemaker. He made me sandals for me and Lucie, you know? Sandals. And the\nsole, he used the sole from the \u2014 the belt from the mines, you know, the rubber belts\nthat they used in the mine for the coal? He used. And the top was all leather from\nthe boots. And he kept the leather, leftover leather he kept it for himself to make\nshoes, so he didn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t cost us nothing, the sandals. So he made sandals for\nme and Lucie and we had the sandals way back to Belgium we had those sandals.\nThey were made like unbelievable. And that was the \u2014 the profit because through\nme they got the German officers. If not they wouldn\u2019t know the German officers\nwere in the woods, you know? So \u2014 and then the \u2014 they had the German prisoners,\nthey didn\u2019t kill them. They turn them over to the Americans much later, know?\nThey use them. Because I met some of those German soldiers who were \u2014 that I\ninterrogate, I met them later in Marseilles. They used to clean the beach, the mines\non the beach. And then in Marseilles \u2014 I came to live in Marseilles. From Tresse I\nJuly 23, 2009\nwent to live in Marseilles. In Marseilles there was no room, there was no\napartments. Through a friend of my father, from the resistance, he \u2014 he was \u2014\nbecame like the mayor of \u2014 of the [indecipherable] Marseilles, and he got a\napartment for us, next to the [indecipherable]. And \u2014 and he s \u2014 and this \u2014 this \u2014\nthis fellow was like the mayor of that district up there, he told my father \u2014 my\nmother was still in town in Tresse, she didn\u2019t come yet to Marseilles. And then\nlater she came to Marseilles, but before she came to Marseilles, he send me to\nSept\u00e9me. Sept\u00e9me is a little town not too far from Marseilles by Aix-en-Provence.\nAnd I stayed by the mayor of Sept\u00e9me, you know, because he was from the\nresistance too. And the mayor from Sept\u00e9me, I slept in his house and I became\nfriendly with his son. And the son used to \u2014 used to go hunting for rabbits and\neverything, I became his friend. In those d \u2014 in that time, France was like a civil\nwar. The French were fighting the French. The French from the resistance were\nfighting the French who were with the Germans in the second World War with\nVichy. And \u2014 and in the next town where I stayed, the \u2014 the French people from\nVichy killed the mayor \u2014 killed the mayor. So he was the \u2014 the son of the mayor\nwas afraid they\u2019re gonna come and kill his ow \u2014 his father, so we slept all night with\na rifle, he had rifles. We slept all night with the rifles underneath the bed. And I was\nscared, I thought something\u2019s gonna happen. So I didn\u2019t sleep all night, I fell asleep\nJuly 23, 2009\nin the morning, you know, in the morning. And then \u2014 and then all the woods were\ncleaned from the \u2014 the guys from \u2014 the people wi \u2014 with the Germans, you know,\nthe Vichy, they cleaned all the woods, and there was \u2014 everything was good, you\nknow, there was no more enemies in the woods, because they cleaned the woods.\nThey used to clean all the woods, the resistance. More resistance came from\nMarseilles, and they helped cleaning the woods, yeah. And then I went back to\nMarseilles where \u2014 then my mother came from the town, and I start living in\nMarseilles. And in Marseilles, | ma\u2014 we were playing soccer, you know, by the\nrailroad station. And the ball went across the fence, to a place where \u2014 where ja \u2014\nthere were German prisoners. German prisoners. So my friends used to know that I\nspeak German, they used to say, Andre, go get the \u2014 go get the ball for \u2014 so I went\nto ge \u2014 ask them for the ball. He says, I\u2019ll give you the ball if you do me one favor,\nthe German prisoner says. Th-Th \u2014 well, I got it from Americans, yeah, and the\nAmericans said, don\u2019t speak too much to them, know? I said was just want to get\nthe ball. Oh. So at that time I couldn\u2019t speak English, you know, we had like\nexplained to him. So we got the ball and he says he wants \u2014 he wants I should buy\nhim some beer. He says, I have no money, he said, but I give you my gold ring. He\ntook out \u2014 he took his wedding ring, a heavy gold ring, and he gave me the gold\nring. And I am gonna take the ring, I figure [indecipherable]. So \u2014 so I \u2014 then my\nJuly 23, 2009\nbuddies, they said to me in French, what does he want? I say, he wants a \u2014 a couple\nbottles of beer. He wants to give the ring. So they said, take the ring, take the ring\nfrom the guy, you know. They\u2019re my buddies, you know, so I took the ring, and I\nbought him \u2014 I bought him some beer. I bought him with some beer and I kept the\nring, I took the ring home, I gave the ring to my mother. And my mother had the\nring th \u2014 the rest of her life she had the ring, yeah. And then later I took out the\ninscription, the German inscription in the ring. And it is just a \u2014 th-they \u2014 like once\nthey were prisoners, the Germans, they were like \u2014 they were like helpless, you\nknow. So then from \u2014 later from Marseilles, we went back to Belgium. We went\nback to Belgium. We lived there about one year in Marseilles, and we went back to\nBelgium. And from Belgium we came to the United States. My aunt made the\npapers for us, she insisted we should come there. And my mother didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t\nsaw her aunt \u2014 my \u2014 her sister since the Russian revolution she didn\u2019t see her sister.\nHer sister lived in the United States. Because originally she came to Belgium when\nshe was a young girl to take the ship t \u2014 for United States, and then she met my\nfather, she remained in Belgium, you know. She got married, she went in Belgium.\nAnd \u2014 and my father didn\u2019t want to go to the States, but he had a lot of arguments\nwith her, finally he gave in and he wen \u2014 we came to the States. And that\u2019s how I\nended up in the States, yeah. And in the States, I lived here about two years, I got\nJuly 23, 2009\ndrafted in the American Army, you know, and they send me to Korea. From Korea\nthey send me to Germany, because I spoke German, they se \u2014 they said, they send\nme to Germany on occupation duty. And I came out of the army, I-I stayed in the\nUnited States because my parents lived here, and th \u2014 and that\u2019s the story, yeah.\nWhat else? Is it \u2014",
        "A: When I arrived in the United States, it was tough because I couldn\u2019t speak\nEnglish. Took me time to learn English. And it\u2019s a good thing I \u2014 I had a trade, you\nknow, I start working right away. I-I learned to be a jeweler in Belgium, you know.\nAnd I start working as a jeweler. But I looked younger than my age, and they\nwouldn\u2019t hire me. They wouldn\u2019t hire me, they didn\u2019t believe me that \u2014 and then\nfinally they hired me and I start working. And then I got drafted, you know. And I\ndon\u2019t know, what else? That\u2019s it, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, ye-ah. I got \u2014 when I came out of the army, I \u2014 I \u2014 I go \u2014 I got married to\nsomebody born from here, you know, an American wo-woman. And I live with her\ntwe \u2014 20 years, I got two daughters with her. And then later, after we divorced, I\nmet my second wife, which is from Guatemala, you know, and I\u2019m married her\nJuly 23, 2009\nnow 10 years, I think. I learned to speak Spanish [indecipherable] in our country,\nyou know. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s it, I-I guess.",
        "A: Yeah, one thing, yeah. When [indecipherable] so in \u2014 when I lived in Tresse,\nmy mother got a letter from a woman living in Marseilles, that she knew from\ncamp. And the woman says, there\u2019s no food here, maybe you people can bring us\nsome food. In Marseilles there was no food. So my mother made like a par \u2014 like a\npackage of food, and I took the bus to Marseilles. In those days, there was only one\nbus going to tr\u2014 Marseilles, and one bus coming home. That\u2019s the communication\nthere was there, from the town to \u2014 to Marseilles. So I came to Marseilles and I\nlooked \u2014 I left a \u2014 the package in the consigne in the \u2014 by the bus stop there was a\nconsigne. You leave the package, and when \u2014 when you\u2019re ready, you go there, you\ntake it out and you gi \u2014 bring it to the people. And I looked for the people. So I\ncame to the house where the people live, and I see the \u2014 the apartment is empty,\nnobody lives there. So, I \u2014 there was a kid playing in front of the door, marbles, so\nplay marbles with him. I said to him, where are the people who live here? He said\noh, he said, the French police took them a couple days ago. He says they \u2014 he says,\nbecause they were Jews. I said, no kidding, you know, like I made believe I don\u2019t\nJuly 23, 2009\nknow what \u2014 I say, what is that? He say, yeah, they believe in another religion. He\nsay, they\u2019re not like us. So he said to me, where you from? I say, I\u2019m from Notre-\nDame de la Garde in Marseilles, you know, the mountain, the church. He says, oh,\nplay with me marbles, and then next time I\u2019Il come to you. I want to play marbles in\nyour neighborhood. So I play marbles with him, and then I saw that \u2014 so I said, well\nI got to \u2014I got to go. He said, Ill go with you. I said, no, I want to \u2014 I got to see my\ngrandmother. If my grandmother knows that I played around, she\u2019s gonna get mad\nat me. He say, I\u2019ll see you next time. He said, yeah, I\u2019Il come and meet you in\nNotre-Dame de la Garde. So I-I went back to the rail \u2014 to the bus stop, and I know\nI can\u2019t deliver the \u2014 the package. So I stayed in the town, and the town was full of\nGermans. They were all going to Africa in those days, they were fighting in Africa.\nThat was like in 1940 \u2014 end of 1942. And the town was full of Germans, and then\nthere was two Italian ships leaving, with the Italian troops. And the Italian people\ncame there with their babies to say goodbye to this \u2014 to the soldiers. And they were\nholding up the babies to the \u2014 to show the soldiers, the Italian soldiers that \u2014 their\nbaby \u2014 and they were yelling, bambino, bambino. And the \u2014 and the German\nsoldiers were guarding the harbor and they were laughing, they were making fun of\nthe Italians because the bambino, you know, they were showing the babies, you\nknow. And I wi \u2014 I witnessed this then, know, in Marseilles, you know. And th-the\nJuly 23, 2009\nGermans were buying things in the harbor and everything, because they were also\nleaving on ships to north Africa, you know. That was the closest I came to the \u2014 to\nthe German troops going to Africa, you know, and Marseilles, yeah. And then at\nnight I went back to my town. And when I went back to my town, the \u2014 a patrol\ncame up on the b \u2014 on the bus and checked everything. And he showed me \u2014 he said\nto me, what are you doing with the food? They notice I got food. I say, yeah, I say,\nI\u2019m \u2014 my grandmother gave me some food to bring to my mother, you know. Yeah,\nyou had to know what to say to them, yeah, because they couldn\u2019t speak \u2014 they\ncouldn\u2019t speak French. That was the only thing which saved everything, because the\nFrench couldn\u2019t speak German and the Germans couldn\u2019t speak French. There was\nsometime one guy who could speak a couple words, but he didn\u2019t know \u2014 you say\ngrandmother, he knew was grosmutter, yeah. Oh, grosmutter, grosmutter, yeah,\nokay. So was a \u2014 there was a look, because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they couldn\u2019t\ncommunicate, yeah, yeah.",

        "A: Who?",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 in \u20141n Tresse, when we came to Tresse, the\nwoman was our landlady, she owned the Hotel de France. And in the Hotel de\nFrance was three prisoners. The king of Morocco, ben Yusef, Bourguiba, who\nwanted to \u2014 to have freedom for Tunisia, and there was a guy, Ali, his last name I\ndon\u2019t remember. And he was \u2014 there were three Arab chiefs who wanted\nindependence from France and the French wouldn\u2019t give them independence, and\nthey kept them there as prisoners. R\u00e9sidents Francais. Every day they had to sign\nby the police, by the gendarme, and they were prisoners there. And being that I\nlived next to the hotel, she \u2014 the woman who owned the hotel was our \u2014 our\nlandlady too. Her name was Madame Laville(ph), and she was very friendly with\nus. I used to go to the garden with her, with a donkey and a \u2014 a carriage. And then\nwe used to come back from the garden, she had a garden outside the si \u2014 the town,\nshe has a couple miles of \u2014 of vin, you know, what\u2019s her name? Grapes, a couple\nmiles of grapes she used to own. And she used to \u2014 we used to bring back grapes or\npeaches. And she said to me, the peaches bring to Bourguiba. The grapes bring to\nben Yusef, the king of Morocco, and the cherries, whatever, the other stuff, she\nsaid, bring it to Ali. They had their own rooms, I used to bring it to them. And the\nJuly 23, 2009\nking of Morocco, he had a man watching him. He had like another ma \u2014 Arab\nwatching him. And the women who used to clean the room, they told me that he\nwas blonde. He wore a little hat so you didn\u2019t see his hair, so they told us that he is\nblonde, he is the only guy, he\u2019s a blonde guy. So we didn\u2019t believe\n[indecipherable] and he was watching the king, ben Yusef. Ben Yusef couldn\u2019t\nspeak French, he only spoke Arabic. Bourguiba spoke French and he helped me\nwith my homework, yeah. And later, one of my friends became the mayor of\nGassin, in France, next to San Tropez. And we went to ga \u2014 when I went to\nGassin to s \u2014 meet my friend \u2014 he used to come to New York to see me too \u2014 he\nsaid to me, I want to write to Bourguiba, I wrote to Bourguiba, he won\u2019t answer\nme. But if I write a letter, you sign it, he will answer you. So he wrote a letter to his\noffice, and I signed it, and Bourguiba answered the letter, that\u2019s the letter I showed\nyou there, that you have now. Yeah. So \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s it now, that\u2019s about it now.\nThere\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s it, yeah.",
