        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Susie Schwarz, conducted by Margaret West, on September the\nvideotaped interview conducted with Susie Schwarz on February the 14th, 1990. The\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr\nfor making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A.",
        "Answer: I\u2019m Susie Schwarz. I was born in Germany, on May the third, 1931 in a little\ntown called Schlichtern, which is near the city of Frankfort, Germany. My father\u2019s name\nwas Max Greenbaum -- or Greenbaum and he was born in November of 1897, also in\nSchlichtern. My mother\u2019s maiden name was Kaita Kahn and she came from what is now\ncalled Badbuchau, in southern Germany. Her birthdate is December eight, 1903 and for\nthe record, she is still living and well in Baltimore, Maryland. She married my father in\nMarch of 1930, after a whirlwind courtship and moved with him to Schlichtern and lived\nthere together with his family, his mother and several siblings. My father, as a trade,\nworked as a horse -- or was a horse dealer. They sold -- bought and sold horses and sold\nthem mostly to farmers, I believe, and seemed to have made a very good living, because\nthey lived very comfortably there in Schlichtern, as I was told. However, in 1933, he felt\nthat the political situation was such that he was no longer comfortable staying in\nGermany. He was worried that things would go from bad to worse and decided to go to\nEngland. I was told that he left in search of new opportunities and went to -- through the\nNetherlands to go to England. However, he stopped in a little town in Holland called\nDinksburlow and there he was -- he was given a contact with a family by the name of\nPagrach, P-a-g-r-a-c-h. And when he told them that he was going to go to German -- to --\nsorry -- to England, they said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here? In the Netherlands, you will be\nvery safe, and they do need a horse dealer here. There are lots of farmers who are always\nin need of new horses. And also, there are some people that are interested in riding\nhorses.\u201d Well, it appears that he allowed himself to be dissuaded from going to England,\nand remained. And obviously sent, shortly thereafter, for my mother and me. I, at that\ntime, was two years old. So, the two of us came to Holland and my recollections\nobviously are not too clear. With regard to my parents beliefs and opinions, I have a\nfeeling that my mother in particular, felt German first, Jewish second. I think my father\nmay have been a little bit more neutral in that area. By the way, my mother came from a\nfairly Orthodox family. Her father went to synagogue a lot and I don\u2019t know if they had a\nreally, strictly kosher home, but they were fairly observant. My father\u2019s family, however,\nwas not. I don\u2019t think they were either very religious or very much associated with a\nsynagogue or community, as such. I think they were more interested in their business and\nmy grandfather, incidentally, also was in the same line of business -- my paternal\ngrandfather. And interestingly, my mother\u2019s father was a cattle dealer, slash, farmer. I am\nnot too sure how politically active or conscious they were, other than the threat of\nNazism. But, other than that, I don\u2019t think they were involved in any party or political\norganizations. My father did serve in the German army in the first World War. I do not\nknow in what capacity, but he was a soldier, I don\u2019t know what rank he ever -- if any, he\nachieved. In any case, my mother\u2019s family, just to complete the picture, consisted of her\nparents, a brother -- an older brother and sister, who incidentally, went to Israel in \u201837 or\n\u201838. The mother, having been left behind for good reasons, because they wanted to\nestablish themselves first in Israel, and therefore, the mother remained in Buchau --\nBadbuchau. My father\u2019s family consisted of three brothers, two sisters and of course, my\nfather. All of the former went to the United States also, in -- I assume it was in 1938, with\nthe exception of one younger brother, who also went to the Netherlands. So, that is for\nbackground information on the family in Germany. I --",
        "Q: What happened to the brother in the Netherlands?",
        "A: Good question. The brother in the Netherlands, did not think that anything was going\nto happen to him. Incidentally, he lived in Amsterdam, and when my father did say to\nhim -- his name was Ludwig, \u201cLudwig, things are getting tight. Don\u2019t you think you\nshould go into hiding?\u201d Ludwig had responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to go to Westerbork, and\nI know that\u2019s where many of them are going and I\u2019m sure I will be all right.\u201d Obviously,\nhe was not all right, he was killed in Sobibor. However, all the others, they lived and\nthrived in Baltimore, Maryland. So, to get back to Holland, we -- we settled in -- in\nHolland. These very nice people by the name of Pagrach found us a home and\nincidentally, they almost become surrogate family to us. They found us a home across the\nstreet and I seemed to have really bonded with them, calling them Uncle Ohm -- Ohm\nand Tumter and Oma and Opa, in lieu of having any Omas or Opas around me. So, my\nfather started his new life and seemed to do quite nicely, I think, from an economic point\nof view, we -- we were all right. My mother was and still is, a very gregarious woman\nand she quickly made friends. In the German Jewish community, it seems that in the\ntown of Dinksburlow, a lot of German Jews came over the border and settled there. And\nmy mother managed to make contact with some of them and she used to have her\nSaturday afternoon coffee klatches with them and seemed to be fairly content with her\nlife, although I think living in a small town like that must have been a little bit frustrating\nto her. I really don\u2019t know if she was always very happy living in Dinksburlow.",
        "Q: Was she a very cultivated person, who\u2019d love music and theater and so on that cities --\ncity life would offer?",
        "A: No, unfortunately she was not -- was not and is not. She was a very good looking,\nyoung woman and I think somewhat indulged in by both her father, as well as my father.\nShe was more interested in being courted than perhaps going to theaters, to concerts, to\nmovies, etcetera. She read. I don\u2019t know how much she read, but she read. I really don\u2019t\nknow what her interests at that time were, other than to be able to set a nice table and to\nentertain her friends. And my father was a very, very good provider, but he too did not\nseem to be very much connected with -- he was quiet with the community. He would go\non Saturdays to synagogue, which was the proper thing for everyone to do. He would\nplay cards, I believe, perhaps once a week with some of, again, the German Jews. They\nled a fairly self-contained life and there was really not much culture in and around that\narea. And this is sort of the atmosphere I grew up in. I adored my mother. I was very\nmuch attached to her, to the point where I would be with her if I could have been with\nher, morning, noon and night. I was less attached to my father. I guess I admired my\nmother. She was a very good looking, always very well groomed, dressed lady and I must\nhave been quite taken by that.",
        "Q: You were an only child?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I\u2019m interested in knowing if you would suppose that to be the case because by\nthe time you were born, there was clear -- clearly ominous signs on the horizon?",
        "A: Yes. I asked my mother once why it was that I was an only child and she said, \u201cWell,\nthe circumstances were not exactly propitious to have more children. And of course,\nobviously, it was -- it was a g -- inadvertently, it was a good decision, because I think it\nwould have been very difficult for us to have found two hiding place -- I mean, hiding\nplaces for several children. I don\u2019t think I considered myself to be a very spoiled child,\nbut I don\u2019t know, of course, that\u2019s not for me to judge. My mother was very, very strict, a\nfairly tough taskmaster or mistress and I was expected to obey and she -- in many ways\nshe controlled me quite a bit, because if I were offered a cookie by a stranger, I would\nlook and see if she would nod and say yes, you may take the cookie, or no you may not\ntake the cookie. And expected to make my little curtsy when I shook hands with\nsomebody and things like that. She -- She was strict, my dad was not. He was more -- I\nthink he was more loving, a little warmer than she. I -- It\u2019s very hard to recall the en --\nreally, the environment too much. It -- I think, in many ways, that I perhaps got more\nnurturing from my adopted family, the Pagrachs or more attention from the Pagrachs,\nthan I might have gotten at home. It\u2019s very difficult to describe this so many, many years\nlater. In any case --",
        "Q: Well, you know a thought occurs to me. It\u2019s interesting that your mother would seem\nto be perhaps a -- a little self centered and yet, when tested by life, she came through with\nsuch flying colors, of courage and fortitude and optimism, which is remarkable. I wonder\nif you think those strengths in both your parents really came through s -- a spiritual\nsense? A s -- Convictions that were deep in the background?",
        "A: I doubt it. I really, really doubt it, but I think your point 1s well taken. There was this\nsort of -- well, what? They were not -- They were not as warm or giving as I think they\ncould have been. I don\u2019t know, but spiritual? I think it was a matter of, we have to\nsurvive, we want to survive and no further thoughts were given to it. It\u2019s very possible. In\nany event, I would say it was a -- a good childhood, it was nothing extraordinary. I -- I\ngot what I think I should have gotten and what I needed and I had my little friends, who\nwould come to the house and play with me. I read a lot, I went to the library and got very\nmany books and I was encouraged to read. I think my mother read to me. My mother,\nincidentally played the piano and would play for me sometimes. But, I have no\nremembrances of either one of my parents ever playing with me, playing games or really\ndoing very many so-called fun things. I\u2019ve tried to -- to think if there were instances and\nthe only instance I can remember where I was taken somewhere just for my pleasure, was\nsome -- I guess you would call it a very fancy playground in another town. But then\nagain, my town, Dinksburlow, did not have many opportunities for very many activities,\nso we had to make our own. We certainly managed to do that and did it very, very well, I\nthink. So life in Dinksburlow really went on with friends and this -- the Pagrachs.",
        "Q: Now you had taken identity papers from the Pagrachs when you went into hiding.\nWhat was the purpose for doing that?",
        "A: No, I did not take identity papers of the Pagrachs when I went into hiding. I got those\npapers after the war. After the war, the Pagrachs came back to Dinksburlow to, they were\nin hiding. One sister perished, her name was Lien and I had the letter from the Red Cross\nin which they notified the family that Lien had died in Sobibor. I got that letter from\nLien\u2019s sister, whose name was Berta -- Bertha, and she also gave me other papers.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And those are the papers I also turned over to the museum.",
        "Q: Yes. So, was she -- was she also a child?",
        "A: No. The Pagrachs, there was a brother and there were two sisters and they were all\ncontemporaries of my parents. And the oldest sister came to the United States and lived\nnear us and as I said, I considered her truly an aunt and a member of the family and had a\nlot of fondness for her, and m -- when she came to -- we had her come to the United\nStates and when she came to New York and couldn\u2019t live there any longer, we moved her\nto Rockville and we looked after her there.",
        "Q: Now, moving along, what I was interested in knowing how you -- how your father\narranged the hiding places and whether his ability to reward somebody financially had\nany role in that. O-Or whether people would be given help through the organized\nresistance.",
        "A: Mm-Hm. Well, my father and -- arranged -- 1t was not done through an organized\nresistance. My father, because he knew very many farmers, had sort of, in a discreet way,\ntried to find who could he trust, who could he not trust and who could he contact and\nwho could he not contact. And found -- And knew a farmer with whom he had been\ndoing business and had sort of dropped a hint, saying, you know, things are getting tough\nfor us and when push comes to shove, I think we -- we probably have to try and hide\nourselves rather than report. And this man, whose name was Yolink and this figures very\nprominently in my survival, said, \u201cWell, I have these --,\u201d I think they were cousins of his\nand they were sh -- teachers. And he said, \u201cThey are involved in the underground\nmovement, or in the resistance movement and why don\u2019t you talk to them, because I\nthink they may know some people. But,\u201d he said, \u201cI, myself, would be more than happy\nto take you.\u201d And, so that was arranged, that my father would meet those two ladies. And\nthey -- And they\u2019d had probably a number of addresses, one -- two of whom were the\npeople where we ended up being in contact with. But, above all, Mr. Yolink said to my\nfather, \u201cI would be happy to kee-keep you, but not your wife and child, because I can\nonly take one person.\u201d And that\u2019s how we came to Yolink and then my father learned\nabout the other families, but did not meet them at all. It was just a name -- two names that\nwere given to him. And one of the families had said they would take me and the other\nfamily said they\u2019d take my mother and her mother, my grandmother, who, remember I\nsaid, had been left behind in Germany, and came to live with us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Why do you think these people did this and put their lives on the line?",
        "A: I think these people are -- first of all, they were -- especially the Hartamings where we\nstayed, were very deeply religious, they were Dutch Reformed and the Yolinks were also\nDutch Reformed, perhaps a tad less religious than the Hartamings were. I think it was\nreligion, slash, humanitarian need to help your fellow man, because interestingly -- and\nI\u2019m jumping ahead a little bit now, when I have spoken to them about why, they -- they\nsort of look at me in amazement and they say, \u201cWell, we\u2019d do it all over again.\u201d And\nYolink\u2019s son said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it was such a big deal.\u201d Well, it was a big deal\nindeed, because, after all, they put their lives and their farms and their families on the line\nfor us, but over and over, over the years, they have said, no, they would do it again and it\nwas only the right thing to do. So, I guess it was indeed Christian as well as\nhumanitarian.",
        "Q: Yes. I\u2019m jumping ahead also, to that wonderful moment you describe, o-of the -- at\nthe end of the war, when you gave thanks in the kitchen. And I wonder if you\u2019d talk more\nabout that. And I was interested also, when your host family -- and I think it was the\nmother who prayed, were -- did you also -- those of you who were Jewish, did you also\noffer thanks? Do you remember if there was more to the ceremony\u201d?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t really a ce -- I don\u2019t know if it wa -- 1t wasn\u2019t really a ceremony, it was\nall -- the war was over and we all came out of our little crevices and, as I had mentioned\nbefore, we sat around this, what looked to me like a huge, round table, the same table\nthey sat at every night and they ate their porridge and then they played the organ and they\nsang hymns. So that the day of liberation, Mutter Hartaming, Mother Hartaming said,\n\u201cWell, we should all sit down and eat,\u201d I guess the porridge or whatever it was, together\nand all of us did there, six, seven children, Father and Mutter Hartaming. My mother, my\nfather and I, two or three other young men that were s-semi hiding there and our\nneighbors, whom I talked about on my tape, that had crawled into the hole with us for the\nlast few weeks. And we all sat around that table and then Mutter Hartaming simply said,\n\u201cWell, let us pray.\u201d And we all sat and we bowed our heads and then she said, \u201cI want to\nthank the good Lord for having allowed us to survive this and to be able to save --\u201d and\nshe named all of us and sort of said, \u201cWe thank the good Lord.\u201d And we all sat and then\nwe said amen, and that was it and I think there were many a wet -- not too many dry eyes\nleft after that. Also, I think the Sunday after our liberation, we came back to the farm to\naccompany all of them to the church for a service, where we sat and prayed with them.\nWe looked at the prayer books and prayed with them. Being Jewish didn\u2019t make any\ndifference. And it was a very beautiful moment.",
        "Q: Do you have a memory of the shape that people were in physically then? Would your\nparents -- I mean, would you be sitting in your -- the arms of one of your parents at that\nfarmhouse table and think you were very weak, at the end of the war, but I wonder if the\nothers too, were poorly nourished and ragged in your clothing and so on?",
        "A: As a matter of fact, no. I think all of us who came out, probably looked as well as we\ndid when we went in. My mother, who was blonde, I think her har -- her hair may have\ndarkened a little bit. And I had gotten rather heavy and I think part of this was due to the\nillness, coupled with inactivity and I think I was a rather roly-poly, with long hair. My\nfather looked the same as he always did and the farmers themselves -- of course, we did\nnot suffer from any malnourishment. We were always very adequately provided for. It\nmay not have been gourmet food, but it certainly was good food and we -- what they had,\nthey shared with us. So no, I think -- and clothing-wise, it\u2019s funny -- I don\u2019t remember\nthat too well, I know I must have outgrown the few clothes that I had when I went in, but\nI also know that as soon as we came out, someone gave me clothes, perhaps some\nfriends, to fit me and my mother immediately went in search of her dressmaker and found\nsome material to have herself some dresses made. And dad had probably the same clothes\nhe had before the war, so there was no -- no problem there, and I know when the war was\nover, we went back to Dinksburlow and the first thing I did -- and I don\u2019t know why I did\nit, I had, at that time, very long braids, and I had them cut off, because I thought I had to\nstart to look a little older, but I don\u2019t think it helped.",
        "Q: And you -- your mother was blonde, you were dark-haired as a child, and that would\nincrease the risk of you being discovered, is that right?",
        "A: Precisely. My mother looked far -- well, my mother almost looked -- almost looked\nAryan, because of her blonde hair, her sort of bluish gray eyes, whereas my father and I\nwere typically Semitic looking people, very dark and that was another reason it was\nfortunate that I could go to the farm with my mother, rather than to the farm that I was\npegged to go to, because I could not have been free to roam around, since I did look too\nJewish.",
        "Q: They do -- I was struck by the kindness of the farm people, which you talk about also.\nThe occasion when you became sick with rheumatic fever, was when the farm daughter\nhad stayed with you, because it was one of -- your mother\u2019s only visit, I think, to your\nfather, but I thought it\u2019s -- it\u2019s striking kindness and sharing that went on.",
        "A: Oh, they were, they -- they all, each and every one of them were absolutely warm and\nloving and wonderful. The -- Actually, the father -- the head of the household, if you will,\nwe had very little interactions with and I think this was considered really to be a -- a\nwomen thing.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, with\nSusie Schwarz. This is tape number one, side B.",
        "A: Well, of course, with respect to my childhood, there are memories. They\u2019re all sort of\njumbled. There is the memory of my grandmother coming, which was a major, major\nevent. She was my uncle\u2019s -- my uncle and aunt had left to go to Israel, she was left\nbehind. And then, I think in \u00b039, 1t was decided that she would come and stay with us\nuntil she could go to what was then still Palestine. And she was set to go -- she must have\nbeen in her late 60\u2019s, to me she looked ancient -- and came to a border town with all her\nearthly belongings, her jewelry and lots of luggage and she was sent back, which was a\ntremendous blow and I really don\u2019t know why that happened, but she was sent back to\nGermany and then was not able to come back til the following year, which was already in\n1940 or maybe it was even \u201c41, I don\u2019t know. And when she came to live with us, I was\nvery, very happy, because she did give me a lot of attention and she was always busy\nknitting, knitting sweaters for me and for my friends and would bake cakes and cookies\nand I would be allowed to help her. And she was very wonderful and my father, too,\nenjoyed her very, very much. But I think she was rather frail, and I mentioned this on the\ntape, too, she -- she died a few days before we went into hiding and that was all very\ntraumatic and very, very sad. But she played really a major role in my life.",
        "Q: What would happen to all your worldly goods when you went into hiding?",
        "A: Our worldly goods -- some of our worldly goods were hidden, too. There were a few\ncontacts again that my father had, that said they would keep some of the furniture and\nfurnishings. And I know -- I think the silver was buried in the ground near our house.\nAnd some of the worldly goods were simply abandoned when we left -- when we went\ninto hiding. And when we came back after the war -- first of all, our house was 90 -- 85\npercent destroyed and my father said some of the furniture, he could even find in the\nwoods, still, it was just chopped up. But the people that had taken the bulk of it, returned\nit all to us and the silver and the crystal and whatever it was, was uncovered and it all\ncame with us to the United States. So we were very lucky that we could retrieve a lot of\nthe things we had. After the war, it was really rough too, to pick up the pieces again and I\ndon\u2019t know if we should talk about that yet.",
        "Q: Yeah, I -- I also wondered -- you mentioned on the videotape, your father, the day he\nleft to go into hiding. Do you remember more about that moment or that day of saying\ngood-bye to him? It must have been hard.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember. I do know he left well ahead of us and I don\u2019t remember, for\nexample, a very dramatic good-bye or a hugging, kissing. He -- He left. I\u2019m not sure if it\nwas on the same day or perhaps the day before. He too -- He left alone, that I know, on\nhis bicycle and I have a feeling that he went to this sort of in between house, where we\nalso were taken to. And then, I was not aware of contact with my father, but my mother\nsaid that the farmers were in touch and knew he was all right and he was well. And\ninterestingly, now that I have gone back to the farm quite a number of times, I realize he\nwas far closer to us than I thought at that time we were. As a matter of fact, I would say\nhe was in 10 minutes walking distance from us, which was not far. But, at that time, I\nthink -- I thought it was very, very far. It was -- Go ahead.",
        "Q: I was just thinking of possessions. Were there particular things that you had in your\nknapsack when you went into hiding, that really comforted and were precious to you or\nto you and your mother during the years of hiding?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think it was really a knapsack -- it may have been a knapsack, it may\nhave been a suitcase. As a matter of fact, I think some of our personal things were taken\nto the farmers in advance of our going there, which must have included some clothing\nitems, because when we went on the bike, the evening that we were taken to the farm, I\ndon\u2019t remember that we had anything with us. So, clothing and some personal items were\ntaken along, but I don\u2019t remember that anything specific of mine went along with me.\nPerhaps a few books, I know my mother had a few books. But all during our hiding time,\nI really did not see any -- many personal belongings, other than probably some blankets\nthat we slept on, and pillows that were in our hiding place with us, but nothing more\npersonal came along. Come to think of it, I must have left all my books and toys, or\nwhatever it was, behind. And I must have also left it behind without looking back or\ngiving it further thoughts, because perhaps it wasn\u2019t meaningful enough or it was just,\nwell, we had to go and don\u2019t think more about it.",
        "Q: Do you ever have dreams and if so, sort of what has -- what have you dreamt of, of\nthis time?",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question to ask, because I\u2019ve been talking about that a lot. I had\ndreams after the war was over and for many, many years -- subsequent years, including\nafter I came to the United States and it was always the same dream, namely, I had two\nvery good friends. They lived within shouting distance, if you will, of where we lived.\nTheir name was Menist, M-e-n-i-s-t. There was a boy, he was the grandson of the local\nrabbi and his sister and my parents were very good friends with their parents. And we\nwere always playing. As a matter of fact, I would almost say they were amongst my best\nfriends, and they were deported. And after the war, I dreamt that I were -- I dreamt that\nthey had survived and they came back. And I would go to their house, where they lived,\nand there would be a woman and perhaps it was the mother who said, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t\nsee them today, but come back tomorrow.\u201d And then my dr-dream continued. I would go\nback and she would always say, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t see them now, but come back\ntomorrow.\u201d And that dream haunted me for years and years and years after the war. And,\nas I said before, even after I arrived in the United States. And that was about the only\ndream.",
        "Q: Did you ever find out what had happened to them?",
        "A: Yes. They were both killed in Sobibor, too. Most of the Jews in the village where we\nwere, were taken to Sobibor and I know that for a fact, because of the research I\u2019ve done.\nAnd speaking of the Menist children, they too were a big part in my life, because th-the\ngrandfather was the local rabbi and he attempted to give us Hebrew lessons, instill some\nJewishness in us and we would meet every week, on Sunday, in his kitchen and he would\nteach us a little bit of history and little bit of the reading. But I was never very interested\nand besides, Eeshe, the boy -- there were two other boys, who were also friends of mine.\nAnd the rabbi was very critical of me because I wouldn\u2019t come to service every Saturday\nas he thought I should. I did go sometimes. I would sit in the women\u2019s section and\ninstead of reading a prayer book, I would read Tilonspiegel. And he would sometimes\ncome home from the synagogue and walk through the streets to go home and I would be\nout on the street playing and then on Sunday I would arrive at his house and he said, \u201cI\nsaw you playing with the Gentile children. I don\u2019t want to see that any more.\u201d And then\none day he said to me, \u201cYou are not coming to synagogue often enough and the reason,\nOma Pagrach 1s ill, is because you don\u2019t come to the synagogue enough.\u201d And I -- I\nguess I must have been about eight, nine, 10, I don\u2019t know, and it was, I got very angry at\nthat and I said, \u201cI\u2019m not staying here.\u201d I got up and I was ready to leave, and Eeshe, his\ngrandson said, \u201cWell, shall I keep her?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, let her go.\u201d And I ran out of\nthere and it was bitter cold, without a coat. And on my way home, I see a little girlfriend,\nI say, \u201cGo back there and fetch my coat.\u201d And I walked into the house and I said to my\nmother, \u201cI will not go back, because he blames me for Oma Pagrach being ill.\u2019 And my\nmother said, \u201cI agree with you.\u201d And that was the end of my Jewish education and so\ntherefore, I\u2019m totally uneducated and that was an incident I remembered quite well.\nSadly, of course, he too was deported and died in Sobibor.",
        "Q: Would they have thought of leaving the country, do you know? Wh-What was in my\nmind was whether he would feel that it was important that he continue with his people t-\nto the end.",
        "A: Again, I think that -- no, I think he -- he would not have contemplated leaving and I\nthink that he also would -- I don\u2019t know if he had any sort of philosophy, I want to stay\nwith my people or with my flock til the end. He was old, he was -- I think he was\nprimitive. But how do I know, I was so young. I think he just went, as many of the others\nwent. He met his fate and apparently, I was told afterwards, he must have been very upset\nwhen they were collected on the marketplace to be sent wherever it was. He was very\nagitated and angry. But just like all the others, he met his fate and that was that. There\nwas another women there whom we knew. Her name was Mrs. Schwab. She was also\nGerman and my father, toward the very end, mentioned that he could find her a place.\nAnd she was one who said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to go because they won\u2019t have kosher\nfood.\u201d I think I mentioned that in my tape. And she was, of course, killed, together with\nall the others. It was a nice town and I think the people were very nice, but I think they all\nknew -- many of them knew that things would not continue to go well for them and there\nwere always rumors and they were always speculating what is going to happen to us.",
        "Q: I wanted to -- you to tell me, first of all, in your first few months in hiding, when you\nwere in the coffin, what do you remember about following each day and having a sense\nof time then? And then go on to tell me how your mother coped and whether she was\nable to deal with the situation more ably than your father in his hiding place. And to what\nextent she always kept up her defenses.",
        "A: Interestingly, my recollections of the coffin are fairly vague. I see it in front of me,\nhow we went into it and we were lying on those huge sacks of milled flour, I think 1t was\nand it had a very dr -- it was very dry and stuffy. It was as if you are constantly inhaling\ndust, but of course it didn\u2019t -- there was an odor to it, too. So, it was big enough that we\ncould stretch out in it and we were lying there. I don\u2019t think we could sit [indecipherable]\npositive. And they would -- they put us in there and we had a little receptacle in case we\nhad to use the toilet facilities. And must have been given some food. What I do remember\nquite well though, 1s at night, the daughter, or one of the daughters would come, open the\nlid and told us to go out, because this was in a -- in an attic-like place. Opened up the lid,\nwe would go out, stretch, walk and we were given food at that time and I guess maybe\nwe washed ourselves. It\u2019s -- It is truly very vague. And while we were lying in there, my\nmother and I would of course talk incessantly and she always tried to put a positive thing\non everything, this is only going to be a short time, they are going to find us another\nplace and told me stories, which she did the whole time anyhow. But also, during that\ntime, I wasn\u2019t well. And I think that was the -- probably already a forerunner of what was\nto come, because one evening, when the daughter took us out, I had chills and I was\nreally not feeling well. I had the sore throat already. So, mother was ma -- mother was\npositive and I was, I think, fairly weepy and well, we stayed there and I wish I\nremembered how long it was. I can\u2019t believe it was all too long and then we were\ntransferred to the other wonderful palace that I called it, that we occupied for the\nremainder of the time. And, with respect to my father, there was little contact and strange,\nI -- I wasn\u2019t homesick for my father. I think I was too busy trying to adjust to that life that\nI had to lead there with my mother, that I could not think too much about my father\u2019s\nabsence. It was [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Tell me about the one occasion when your mother did let her feelings -- reveal her\nfeelings to you, of disappointment.",
        "A: And it was only one occasion that that happened. It was during the time -- it must have\nbeen in \u201844, I think, when the allies had this aborted invasion of the Netherlands, near\nIronham, I think that\u2019s eventually, what the movie, \u201cOne Bridge Too Far,\u201d was based on\nand they were sent back and we had hoped that the end was in sight, and we were all so\neuphoric about it all. And then it all came to naught and then my mother was very down,\nI would almost say depressed, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever get out of here.\u201d And\nanother thing she said to Mutter Hartaming, \u201cI guess if you had known that it would last\nthis long, would you have taken -- you wouldn\u2019t have taken us.\u201d And she said, \u201cWe took\nyou, no matter how long it would be.\u201d But my mother is one of these people who you\ncan\u2019t keep down too long and she recovered from this tremendous disappointment and\nthe farmer said to, \u201cAn end will come and you have to continue to hope.\u201d So, we went\non.",
        "Q: Well, I wanted to ask you about -- your mother told you stories, that helped to pass the\ntime. Has that been important in your life since then?",
        "A: Yes and no. Of course, many of the stories have stayed with me and many of the\nsongs that she has taught me have stayed with me and I really savor them and enjoy it, is\nit important? Has it made a difference in my life? I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know what the\nanswer to that would be. My mother wo -- as I said, I was very connected to her as a\nyoung child, I was afraid to leave her and yet she was -- I mentioned that too, she was\nvery strict as -- very strict, a real disciplinarian of the old school. And she continued this\nafter the war, too and I think I rebelled a lot and became very -- 1n some ways, she was\nvery intim -- controlling and intimidating and I think I had a hard time working on that\nand working through all that. So, am I really answering? Yes, there are a lot of things that\nstayed with me and that I remember very well and remember with fondness. And the\nother side of it is that there are also a lot of things that I remember very well, with not\nthat much fondness, because I think her being so very controlling, has, 1n some ways, at\ntimes, hampered me in my development.",
        "Q: In what sort of ways are you -- and -- and when would you have been working\nthrough that? In the -- Would that have begun in -- when you went to the Montessori\nschool in Utrecht, sort of, or in your years here alone?",
        "A: I think, in my years here in America, alone, although -- because even while I was at\nMontessori, I still felt very controlled by her. I was controlled as a young child, 1.e. the\ncookie incident where, you know, you shouldn\u2019t always take -- accept cookies or\nwhatever. And in Montessori, 1t was a boarding school and I only went home on\noccasions, but even then, I was supposed to -- to do her bidding. And I think one of the\nreasons that I went to the United States when I did, and as I did, was probably to get --\nbecome a little bit more independent, because I think I realized that she was too -- too\ncontrolling. And my father was not at all, but she was and I think that continued through\nmy early and late adolescence and even my early adulthood.",
        "Q: On the other hand, I cannot imagine that you would have survived if you had been in\nhiding, not allowed to come out of your hiding place, without your mother.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct. You\u2019re right. Her -- Her -- Her strength and her dominance was what\ngot us through. I think if she hadn\u2019t been as strong as she was and if she hadn\u2019t been the\nno-nonsense type of person that she was, and if she hadn\u2019t been as resourceful, I think it\nmay have been very difficult. And I always have to think of her having to be there with a\n-- a young child between the ages of 12 and 14, and it was no easy task.",
        "Q: This was not a normal adolescence.",
        "A: No, it was not -- it was not at all a normal adolescence and interestingly, I can\u2019t even -\n- I can\u2019t even identify what -- what was right at that time or not. I mean, what kind of\nthinking I had. You know, girls of 12 and 14 have their interests and problems and so on.\nI don\u2019t even know what, if any, I had, other than there is tomorrow and the next day and\nthe next day and all those days really had very little to offer. Of course, in hiding, one of\nthe highlights was that I was being taught on occasion by the farmers. The daughter\u2019s\nfianc\u00e9, and that was really very, very wonderful.",
        "Q: And that sounded as if your mother\u2019s resourcefulness had been at work.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: He\u2019s a teacher, he can be trusted.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And immediately, that was under way.",
        "A: Yes, it was her resourcefulness, as well as the farmer\u2019s daughter, who suggested that\nshe bring in her fianc\u00e9. A-After all, he was trustworthy, his family was hiding people,\ntoo. So, yes, and mother encouraged that, of course and that was good. And also, after the\nwar was over, it was she who must have come up with the idea of my going to\nMontessori school, realizing that I could not stay in the little school in the village, which\nwould have been a disaster. And sent me to that Montessori school and I still have to find\nout how they were able to fund all that, cause it must have been frightfully expensive, it\nbeing a boarding school, slash, lyceum.",
        "Q: Yeah. Why was the -- Why would it have been a disaster to be at the village school?",
        "A: Very -- The reason 1t would have been a disaster 1s, I should have been at the -- at 14,\nI should have been in the middle school, and had I stayed in the village -- and I was in\nschool there, I was in six or seventh grade, so I was in with the wrong age group and that\nwas not very comfortable. Also, I had difficulties. Remember, I had missed school for\nmany, many years and it was very hard to catch up. And I think the reason the Montessori\nschool came along as my -- again, the Pagrachs suggested my mother take me to the city\nof Arnam and have some testing done to see what I was capable of doing. And I do\nremember I was taken to Arnam, which at the time was considered to be the big city, and\nI was tested and when the report came back, it said that perhaps I should be sent to a\nschool where I could progress at my own speed and see what would happen to me and\nthen make a decision later on. And I think that\u2019s how the Montessori came about, which\nwas really a terrific decision, because again, the Montessori school was very good for me.\nI could indeed progress at my own speed. I may have progressed in the wrong areas,\nbecause I concentrated more on -- on learning languages and literature and history rather\nthan in math. But, it was a good environment, I was around young people my own age for\nthe first time ever. And it was a little bit of an adjustment to be suddenly thrown into this\n-- this type of an environment. It was a fairly exclusive school and very, very small. But,\nI made some friends and I was very happy there. I had a very nice time and we\u2019d go\nhome every few weeks for a weekend and in turn would be invited at some newly made\nfriends home for a weekend and it was a rather posh school. We learned dancing and\nsailing and hockey and tennis and it was all very nice. But, then, after two years at\nMontessori, I was 16 and had I stayed at Montessori, I would have ultimately have to\ntake what they call a state or a final exam, to matriculate, and I was very concerned about\nit, too, because I did not know if I was up to par. And the family in the United States kept\nagitating that I should come and spend a year there, just to forget about what had\nhappened or -- and I think the reason they did that too, because they were hoping that my\nparents, particularly my father would ultimately come and be reunited with his siblings.\nSo, I said yes. I guess, to me, it was an adventure to go across the big ocean to the United\nStates and to be independent and go on my -- be on my own, although I had to -- I was\ngoing to live with my father\u2019s family. So, the idea was for me to go for a year, go to\nschool in Baltimore and then come back. And, in the Montessori school, of course, the\nchildren all thought that was pretty neat [indecipherable] someone to go to United States,\nbecause United States was still Hollywood, big cars and all these wonderful --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: -- continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Susie\nSchwarz. This is tape number two, side A. The Montessori school.",
        "A: The Montessori school, there was one other Jewish girl there, her name was Marishka.\nI think she was Hungarian and I really don\u2019t know anything about her background. Either\nshe had been 1n hiding, too, or perhaps she came -- I don\u2019t think she survived a camp.\nAnd all the other children that were there were children of, I guess some of the Dutch,\neither aristocracy, as there were some -- a few girls, they were vaguely connected to the\nroyal family and a lot of children whose parents were still in Indonesia, and the parents\nbeing Indonesia, they sent the children to school. But it was all very democratic and\nreally very nice.",
        "Q: Was that quite a sacrifice for your parents to send you there, or did the school give\nscholarships, or --",
        "A: I -- The school definitely, definitely did not give scholarships and it must have been a\nsacrifice, because I cannot imagine that 1t was very inexpensive. It was -- As I said, 1t was\na very small school, it was a very exclusive setting and the type of children that were sent\nthere, I think it must have been fairly expensive, and I really don\u2019t know where the\nmoney came from, if my father had indeed done that well again, or if someone lent them\nthe money, I don\u2019t know. But, I do think it was a wonderful thing that they did for me,\nhaving sent me to that school instead of suffering through another school.",
        "Q: Yes, I wonder if you have any memories about the attitudes of the other children\nthere? Were they at all anti-Semitic? Did you talk openly about what had happened? Not\njust the -- to the Jews, but really, do you remember discussions about the war, and what\nthey\u2019d all si -- gone through?",
        "A: I remember one specific incidence, because this is interesting. I\u2019m sure I must have\ntalked about it, and I had one friend who -- well, who roomed with me. As a matter of\nfact, there were two girls. We sh -- There were three of us in one room. And one of\nwhom I became very friend -- good friends with, she w -- visited me in the United States.\nI think she immigrated here eventually, herself. And no feeling of anti-Semitism\nwhatsoever. I think the headmaster was Jewish, I\u2019m fairly sure. However, one of the\nroommates was a young woman who had come from Curacao and asked me home for a\nweekend and I accepted and I went home with her in a neighboring town and I remember\na remark she made, oh, her family really liked me, although in general, they were not too\nkeen on Jews. And that was fortunately the one and only remark that was made and I\ndon\u2019t even remember how I responded to it, or how I handled it. I do know I never did\ninvite her to my house, nor did I ever go with her again. But we stayed on very good\nterms.",
        "Q: You know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m remembering that when I was first told your story in just brief\ndetails, in my mind, of course, was Anne Frank and her diary, but, do you think that there\nare any things in Anne Frank\u2019s story or experiences that are -- that you share in common\nwith her? Superficially, your experiences were very similar.",
        "A: The experiences were very similar. As a matter of fact, I think, age-wise, we were\nfairly close. Interestingly, she came from Frankfort, which was not that far from\nSchlichtern. No, I really don\u2019t think so. I alway think, having of course read her diary\nseveral times, she was more -- a much more introspective, much more thinking person at\nthat age than I was, ergo her diary. When I wrote my so-called cookbook diary, which I\ninterspersed with little things, they were never very thoughtful or significant, other than\nwhat was going on with the war, what the family, meaning the farmers, were doing, and\nwhat my mother and I were doing, whereas I think Anne Frank led a more -- ma-maybe\nmore profound life, a more thinking life. I think she came from a very different\nenvironment than I did, too. So, do I have anything in common with her, other than that\nwe were hidden? No, I don\u2019t think so. I saw her hiding place this summer and of course,\ncompared to my hiding place, they were living in luxurious quarters. But, those luxurious\nquarters were not that good for them.",
        "Q: Yes. It does -- It seems to me, too, that she may have been more living a life of the\nmind when you were also so bonded with your mother, who may have been discouraging\nthat. You may have survived emotionally unscathed, as you said you had, partly because\nyou were keeping in the present. Maybe remaining a child longer than you would have\notherwise.",
        "A: I think I did remain a child much longer than I would have under normal\ncircumstance, or even if we are comparing or trying to see if there\u2019s any connection or --\nor whatever, with Anne Frank. I think I was more connected with my mother than Anne\nwas with her -- both her parents. And yes, I was kept a child and that may have helped\nme, too. I think I was not yet a real adolescent and Anne Frank was, even beyond that.\nAnd perhaps that is why I consider I came out of there un -- relatively unscathed, because\nI still came out as a child. I was a child at 14. I think I was still a child at 16 and perhaps\nthat was to the good.",
        "Q: And it may have been a blessing, yes.",
        "A: Yes, it -- perhaps it was to the good, I think.",
        "Q: Yes. And, what about physically, the physical aftermath of the -- the hiding?",
        "A: Physically, of course, when I -- while I -- when I was in hiding, I started menstruating\nand became aware that I was a woman, but even that was taken very much as -- it was a\nnon-event. It was -- matter of fact, 1t was a nuisance, because, given the circumstances we\nwere in, it was not very pleasant. But I never thought, \u201cAll right, now you -- you have\npassed a threshold and now you\u2019re entering womanhood.\u201d These things never occurred to\nme. I also did not have romantic fantasies, as -- again, as Anne Frank did. I think I\nbecame aware of boys when I went to boarding school, where I did -- well, had my little\nflirtations with the boys, because, by the way, I think I did mention, it was a -- the first\ncoed Montessori school, too. And, you know, we all had our little fantasies and so-called\nromances, but I was a child and my family in Baltimore, they confirmed that, too. They\nsaid when they picked me up and brought me to their home, they were very surprised\nhow -- what a young child I was at 16, because, after all, in the United States, even then,\nat 16, the girls and the boys are more -- more forward, more developed and of course, not\nas sheltered. I was a very, very sheltered child before the war and even somewhat after\nthe war.",
        "Q: Mm, it\u2019s u -- it\u2019s actually a funny term to use, you being sheltered, captive.",
        "A: [indecipherable] Right. I was sheltered in more ways than one. I was emotionally\nsheltered and physically sheltered.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now, what about -- do you have any physical problems that resulted from your\nrheumatic fever and from those years of little movement, and --",
        "A: Well, physical problems were just that I developed -- because of the rheumatic fever,\nthey think that was the cause of a -- a mitral valve, or heart murmur. But it did not hinder\nme in any way as a young woman, I participated in the swimming and the tennis and\neverything else. That only manifested itself in later years, maybe because this valve has\nseepage or leaking and as I got older, it became a little bit more debilitating, til finally, in\n1988, it got so debilitating that the decision was made to repair that valve. So, as I like to\nsay, in 1988, I had a valve job and in 1998, it is still holding up, so the warranty ran out\nand it\u2019s still going strong and I don\u2019t think I have, other than the brief period of time\nwhen it was somewhat incapacitating, with shortness of breath, things like a rapid\nheartbeat, it has not really kept me from doing all the things that I\u2019ve always enjoyed\ndoing, such as hiking, tennis and all the other fun activities.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s move on to that story now, of coming to Baltimore. How did you come? Where\ndid you live, what did you begin to do and so on?",
        "A: I came to Baltimore, as I said, supposedly for one year. How did I come to Baltimore?\nIn \u201847, it was still very difficult to move around, and my family managed to book passage\nfor me on the SS Ernie Pyle -- you know, Er-Ernie Pyle was a war correspondent and this\ntroop ship was named after him and then it was converted to transport people. But, I had\nto pick up that ship in Lahavre and my parents could not go. By the way, they never got\ntheir Dutch citizenship, they kept their ger -- well, we were stateless. I came on a stateless\npassport to the United States. But, again, a friend of the Pagrach\u2019s said he would\naccompany me as far as Paris. And then, in Paris, we connected with another young\nwoman who was also going to board that ship. So, my parents took me to the train in\nAmsterdam and we said good-bye and I think --",
        "Q: Tell me about that good-bye.",
        "A: That must have been difficult, but again, it\u2019s hazy and I don\u2019t remember a thing, other\nthan going to the train, getting on the train and it must have been a sleeper, I would think,\nand getting off in Paris, with this man who was a cousin of the family Pagrach, who\nincidentally, was a survivor from a camp. Had dreadful, dreadful stories to tell.\nWonderful person. And he came with me to Paris and then in Paris we met this woman,\nher name was Margot Faulk, I remember her name and I remember also the first evening\nwe were there, this man and this woman wanted to go to the -- the Moulin Rouge or one\nof these clubs and they didn\u2019t know what to do with me and decided to take me along.\nOh, it was called the Casino de Paris and for me that was big adventure.",
        "Q: You were 16\u201d",
        "A: I was 16. Sweet 16. And I don\u2019t even remember the hotel we stayed in. I only do\nremember we went to this Casino de Paris and must have then, the next day, said good-\nbye to this man and went by train to Lahavre, where we boarded this, what looked to me,\nenormous ship. And there were thous -- I don\u2019t know how many people on this ship. And\nwe didn\u2019t have cabins, we were in sort of dormitories and there was a dormitory for men\nand a dormitory for women. A lot of farmers were going on that ship and I -- my guess 1s\nthe-they were a lot of Dutch and maybe Belgian and French, who could not make it any\nmore in Europe and went either to the United States or to Canada, which actually, several\nof our -- of our farm families children did, they moved to Toronto and neighboring areas.",
        "Q: Are -- That\u2019s cause it was -- life was hard in Europe?",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm. So, we got on this ship, this woman, Mar-Margot and I and I was\nmighty glad to have her, because I would have been totally lost and I -- I was rather timid\nand not very happy at that point. Now, that I remember very well. It\u2019s interesting, I don\u2019t\nremember saying good-bye to my parents and don\u2019t remember details of the Paris stay,\nbut I do remember being overwhelmed by that big boat. And then we were assigned a\nbunkbed. I think they were triple bunks and I remember we had to eat in the cafeteria and\nthis Margot and I amused ourselves. We were sort of left to our own devices and it was a\n10 day journey. I was a little bit seasick and I think I was quite homesick already then,\ntoo. But she -- she was very wonderful. I think she ended up going to Canada, but I\u2019m not\ntoo sure.",
        "Q: What language would you speak?",
        "A: She spoke Dutch.",
        "Q: Yes, so that was --",
        "A: Yes. And incidentally, yes -- so she spoke Dutch and most -- a lot of the people on the\nboat were Dutch, but we did not have too much contact with them.",
        "Q: Were many of them Jews, or were they a real mixture?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I -- I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. I only remember all these women\nin that huge dormitory and then in the morning, the men would come and say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s\ntime to get up.\u201d And again, most of the journey was fairly vague. Obviously, it was quite\nuneventful, but this Margot and I became good friends and remained in touch with one\nanother for a couple of years afterwards. So, the 10 days -- after the 10 days passed, we\napproached New York harbor and I knew my father\u2019s oldest brother and his wife would\nmeet us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now --",
        "Q: Di -- Well, did you s -- You\u2019d come into New York harbor where you\u2019d see the Statue\nof Liberty?",
        "A: Yeah, I saw it.",
        "Q: Would you -- Where would you --",
        "A: Well, I was quite impressed and overwhelmed and I saw the skyscrapers and I found it\nall to be very, very interesting, but of course, I was also very frightened and intimidated\nby it all. So, we were standing on the top deck and I recognized my father\u2019s brother,\nbecause he looked exactly like him. Of course, I had seen photographs and incidentally,\nthe family, after they heard that we survived the war, they sprang into action and send us\nlots of care packages, together with clothes, together with food. And my uncle\u2019s son was\nin the American army and visited us there, and I think I may have mentioned that. That\nwas quite wonderful. So --",
        "Q: How long would they have gone not knowing whether you were all right or not?",
        "A: For the duration of the war. Oh, no --",
        "Q: For several years?",
        "A: My -- My parents managed to get word to them through the Red Cross in -- in sort of\ncode language that -- letting them know that we -- we were all right, that we were not\ndeported. They did --",
        "Q: In hiding --",
        "A: Yeah, well, they didn\u2019t know that, but they knew we did not -- we were not sent away\nto concentration camps. And after the war was over, the son who was in the American\narmy found us and that was a beautiful -- that was one of these memorable incidents,\nwhich I think I spoke about.",
        "Q: You spoke of -- tell me about it again, that\u2019s --",
        "A: That was so lovely, because we were staying in makeshift quarters. I think we had two\nrooms on the farm. And my father was taking a walk on a Sunday morning, or whatever\nand, you know, we were surrounded by a lot of the Canadians who had liberated us, so --\nand they were very nice and they would always bring us food and -- and good things to\neat. So, my father was taking this walk and he sees a soldier, thinking 1t was another\nCanadian. The soldier looked at him and smiled, my father smiled, and must have made a\nlittle chit chat with him and suddenly the soldier said, \u201cWell, Uncle Max, don\u2019t you\nrecognize me?\u201d And my father looked at him and recognized him because he had a little\nscar here where a chicken had once attacked him.",
        "Q: By his eyebrow.",
        "A: Yes, and it was his nephew Martin and he took him home with him and I remember I\nwas so embarrassed because I was still wearing my -- my slip, and I ran away. And he\nsays -- he spent the day with us and told us about the family and he was also saying, you\nshould -- I should come to the United States. And it was really a wonderful get together\nand I think he came back once or twice more, when he was on leave, so that was a big --\nwonderful, big thing and we connected again. Anyhow, when I arrived in New York and\nI saw them standing there, there were also some others, and then | realized they were my\nmother\u2019s cousin. And of course, because of our being together so much, I had a very\ngood knowledge of who was what and what they looked like, practically down to their\nsize and shape.",
        "Q: More information than they had, probably.",
        "A: Right, exactly, and they too, were standing there and they were all frantically waving\nand then I got off the boat and after I went through the immigration. And Margot was --\nmust have been met by someone, too, and then I met them and it was very emotional. My\nuncle was crying and my aunt was crying and then it was my mother\u2019s cousin and her\nhusband and an aunt who were also there. And we first went to someone\u2019s house, it was\nmy aunt\u2019s sister, where we were probably given a meal. And then we drove to Baltimore\nfrom New York in my -- what I thought, my uncle\u2019s enormous, big car and I was really\nawed by all the cars, by all the buildings. It was just vast, 1t was very impressive as well\nas intimidating. But what was more intimidating -- when we got to Baltimore, we didn\u2019t\nimmediately go to my uncle\u2019s home, we went to my aunt, that was my father\u2019s older\nsister, with whom I was supposed to stay. And we get into the house -- she was a\nremarkable lady, my Aunt Eva, and -- by the way, they all spoke German, of course, and\nEnglish, but my German was almost nonexistent, because I remembered a little bit from\nmy grandmother, who spoke German, but I always spoke Dutch. So my German was not\nvery good, but I managed. And my English was fairly poor, too. So I get -- I arrive in my\naunt\u2019s house and the house was full of people -- well, they wanted to all be there and give\nme a big welcome and there were -- there was another aunt and her husband and lots of\ncousins and cousins children. It was really overwhelming and I was very, very\nintimidated and frightened and then my cousin, who was my aunt\u2019s daughter still living\nwith her, could see that I was close to tears, and she said to me, \u201cCome with me to the\nkitchen. I -- There is some mail here for you from -- I think from friends in Holland.\u201d\nAnd I remember she took me to the kitchen and she gave me a banana. And I looked at\nthat mail -- I think I\u2019m getting very sentimental about it, and there were letters from all\nmy friends from school, you know, oh, you must be in United States now and how\nwonderful and how anxious they are to hear from me. But it was very smart of my cousin\nto have done that, to have removed me from all these people that were sort of standing\nover me and wanting to know everything. So, she must have gone back into the living\nroom and told them to disperse. And th-they did. And then, eventually, it was just my\ncousin, her name was Erma and my aunt and I, who were left. And well, I -- they said I\nhave to share the bedroom with my aunt and my cousin, cause my aunt was a widow. She\ncame to the United States with her two daughters, she was widowed. And she had a fairly\nbig house, but she rented rooms. So the three of us all slept in the same room. And my\ncousin was getting ready to get married shortly after I arrived, so it was just my aunt and\nI that were left behind, but she was a very forceful woman. Now, I arrived in July and she\nsaid, \u201cWell, in September, you\u2019re going to go to the high school here and I will arrange\nit.\u201d And in the meantime, the summer was there and we visited another aunt whose\ndaughter had lived -- lived in Cumberland. So, the family really took a tremendous\ninterest in me and -- and tried very hard to --",
        "Q: Be kind.",
        "A: Be kind, yes. Most of them did. They were very wonderful.",
        "Q: But your links -- your letters back to your parents and friends would be what really\nkept you going, is that right?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s correct, if that really kept me going. I think the -- probably, yes,\nit could be that kept me going and thinking also, well, I only have to stay a year, I will be\nable to go home again. That\u2019s -- I think was the key to it, too. In the meantime, my aunt\nhad decided to really bring Susie into American life and started to teach me the right\nthings to say in English, thank you, you\u2019re welcome and so forth and so on and you have\nto be more assertive and you shouldn\u2019t be so shy and we have to make friends. And she\nwas -- I think she probably was at -- with me and for me at the right time. And after the\nsummer was over, she enrolled me in the local high school and this is what I think is\ninteresting, because I was 16 and I -- she managed to place me in the 11th grade, which I\ncould never have been in, had I stayed in Holland. So I realized, well, that was good,\nbecause that would mean I would graduate at age 18, as all normal children would. Had I\nstayed in Holland, I would have probably been 20 or 21 before I would have gotten that\ndiploma. And she took me to the school, I remember very well and she took me to the\ncounselor and she said, \u201cShe is supposed to get the easiest classes, because her English 1s\nvery poor.\u201d And the counselor was very understanding and said, \u201cThere are lots of,\u201d --\nnots lots of, \u201cthere are a number of other immigrant children and don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll take\ncare of her.\u201d And -- And she had a young girl go with me to school, because after -- I\ndidn\u2019t know my way and she was also the daughter of immigrants and they all -- the --\nthe -- the German Jewish immigrants, they stuck very much together. So, this young\nwoman, Ellen, took me to school. And when I came on the first day, the counselor said,\n\u201cYou know, there is a young girl here who speaks Dutch.\u201d Well, I thought I\u2019d died and\nlanded in heaven. And he introduced me to the girl who was really from Germany, from\nBerlin, but she had spent the war years with her family in Bangkok and was sent to a\nDutch school there. And in -- her name was Marion. And, incidentally, Marion was my\nfirst friend and she still is my very dearest friend. She still lives in Baltimore and we see\neach other, oh, at least once or twice a month. And she and I became inseparable and that\nwas very, very good for both of us, because she was shy and I was shy and we did not fit\nin too well. When -- Neither were we too comfortable with our American peer group. We\ndid meet also, some other young immigrant girls and became friends with them. And\nslowly, we developed a -- a nice group. As a matter of fact, we even had a little social\ngroup, boy - girl, which would meet every weekend and we\u2019d dance and have a good\ntime. And my Aunt Eva was always prodding, \u201cNow you have to do this and you have to\ndo that and you have to become more social.\u201d I was still homesick, but I think it star --\noh, and a big event was, after I was perhaps a month or two, they said, we will call your\nparents and you know, making a transoceanic call at that time was a big event and I\ncalled and talked to my mother and father and of course it was bittersweet, because after I\nhung up I felt worse, I think, than I did before. But, I thought that was too very\nwonderful. In any case, life at Aunt Eva\u2019s was very, very good because she took such a\ntremendous interest in me and tried to get me socially -- emotionally, socially and\nintellectually up to snuff. No -- No small task. And --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nSusie Schwarz. This is tape number two, side B.",
        "A: Well, life at Aunt Eva\u2019s was quite good and I think I benefited from it very, very\nmuch. I remember when I got my first report card and I got a near failing grade in\nFrench, she marched herself to school and said to the French teacher, \u201cThat won\u2019t do, she\nis not going to accept that.\u201d And transferred me out of the French class, into a German\nclass, which was very smart, because of course I did very well there and it helped my --\nmy German. So -- But I could not stay at Aunt Eva, because her married daughter had to\nmove back in, because they were going to remodel a house, and then I was shipped off to\nmy Uncle Meyer, who was my father\u2019s oldest brother. That was the father of my cousin\nMartin. There, I was not that happy, because Uncle Meyer\u2019s wife, whereas I\u2019m sure she\nwas happy to take me, was not used to having a young girl around and was accepting of\nhaving me there, but did not like -- did -- was not as encouraging as Aunt Eva, ergo, she\ndid not like it when I would invite people over and --",
        "Q: Was that also in Baltimore?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: So your school, everything else, your friendship --",
        "A: Everything was in Baltimore.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But my friendships stayed the same, but life at my Uncle Meyer and Aunt Ada\u2019s was\nnot quite as wonderful as life at Aunt Eva, although I continued to see Aunt Eva all the\ntime, but I had to stay there, because -- so, after the year was over, my mother came, with\nthe idea to take me back. And at that point, I was quite well settled, very happy, oh, and I\nhad gotten babysitting job, so I learned how wonderful it is to make money, 50 cents an\nhour babysitting. Every Saturday I would babysit and that was a pretty good feeling.\nHowever, Uncle Meyer made me turn most of the money over. Later on -- And I resented\nit, he only allowed me to keep a small amount -- and much later on, I learned that he had\nput that money in an account for me, but he didn\u2019t say that. So, the year was over, my\nmother came with the idea of taking me back and at that point, I think -- there were two\nreasons, I -- I felt very comfortable. I liked school, I liked my life and my Uncle Meyer\nand Aunt Eva and Aunt Hunny, they all said, \u201cWe think your parents should come here\nand it would be much better,\u201d and they were -- they were very close, th-the siblings.",
        "Q: And that had been their plan a-all along, [indecipherable]",
        "A: Of course. So, my mother came, and I let it be known I was not going back.",
        "Q: Well, do you remember what it was like, the reunion with your mother?",
        "A: Well, I was very happy that she came, but there were -- there were some things in --\nyou know, she -- the first thing she saw, I had very bad acne and said, \u201cWell, why isn\u2019t\nanything being done about that?\u201d She was a little bit critical. But I was happy to see her,\nbut I think I was very ambivalent. Well, here she is and she wants to take me back, and\nhere she 1s and the first thing, she was saying, \u201cWell, you need to do something about this\nand that.\u201d It was a mix -- mixed thing, and I think I let it be known very early on that I\nwanted to stay and -- and she must have been agreeable to it. So, she stayed, I believe, for\nthree or four months and went back without me and I continued doing what I did, living\nwith Uncle Meyer and Aunt Ada, babysitting. As a matter of fact, I think I even got an\noffice job at that time, because I took a commercial course in the high school, knowing\nfull well that I could not qualify for higher level courses, not having had any preparation\nwhatsoever. So, in \u201849, my father came and that was also the time I was due to graduate\nfrom high school, so he was there for my graduation, which was very important to me.\nAnd I was so happy to see him. And --",
        "Q: That must have been -- he must have been so moved and proud himself.",
        "A: Oh, he was, yes, he was moved, A, to see me and me doing as well as I was and in\nparticular to seeing his -- his siblings, again. He hadn\u2019t seen them since the mid - 30\u2019s.\nAnd they enveloped him, they just didn\u2019t want to let him go, and he didn\u2019t go, he stayed,\nand must have said to my mother that he was not going to come back and that she should\nclose up, finish up, whatever, and come, which she then did, in 1950, but -- so, he stayed\nfor one year with my uncle, also. And that was wonderful and he and I actually became\nvery close, because, remember I said I was very, very close to my mother, very attached\nto her, but at -- that year was very good for my father and me and we really bonded and I\nthink it was very wonderful. So, I graduated in \u201849 and I went to work. And,\ninterestingly, I went to work for a physician, who was there for -- he came from Detroit\nand he was working on the book of diseases of the -- I don\u2019t know what it was, lung\ndisease or stomach disease and I was doing some work for him at Hopkins. And he and\nhis wife were awfully nice. They didn\u2019t have children and they sort of adopted me. They\nwere very interested and very helpful and he said, \u201cYou know what, I think you need to\ngo to university.\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can make it, because I don\u2019t have the c-\ncredentials.\u201d And he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll help you.\u201d And I said, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have the money.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cWe\u2019 ll fund you, and I want you to discuss it with your family.\u201d But the\nfamily felt I should not accept it, it was too much of a responsibility and a burden, which,\nin retrospect was a bad mistake. And I stayed with that man, I think, for a year or so, and",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t want you to be indebted?",
        "A: I think really that\u2019s what it was, I --",
        "Q: Was he Jewish? The doctor [indecipherable]?",
        "A: Yes, yes, he was. I think that\u2019s what it was, or --",
        "Q: What a mistake.",
        "A: It was. I think that was one of the biggest mistakes that could have been made. My\nunc -- My family, I think they were not academically oriented and I think that\u2019s sad. And\nmy father was not strong enough, I think, either, to make a case for it. My uncle was\nvery, very strong and he felt it\u2019s better if I continue to help support, go to work, and if I\nwanted to take night courses, which I did for awhile, I could, but he was -- there was no\nencouragement, and --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. It would have been different if you had been a boy? Would you have been --",
        "A: Not necessarily. I don\u2019t think -- I think it was not a sexist thing, no, I don\u2019t think so.\nSo, when I declined, the doctor was very disappointed, but he said he understood and that\nwas that and I was crushed. I think, if I had been stronger or more willful, I could have\nprobably made a case for putting myself through school, but -- I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t,\nbut I didn\u2019t. And then, in 1950, my mother came and she went to work. She had never\nworked in her life and she went to work 1n a slipcover factory, where she did piecework.\nAnd she immediately said, well the harder she worked and the longer she worked, the\nmore money she had and she worked very hard. And my father worked 1n -- well, it was\nan installment business, clothing and things like that, not very challenging. And we lived\nin an apartment in Baltimore, on our own. So, all three of us worked, my father, my\nmother and I. I worked in an office, for a small Jewish department store. And then -- And\nmy mother was very unhappy the first few years she was here, she was utterly miserable\nand very homesick for Holland and threatened to go back, but my father did -- also did\nnot want to go back. I didn\u2019t want to go back, so she stayed.",
        "Q: Two against one.",
        "A: Yes, exactly. She stayed and as time went on, I -- I continued to take a lot of courses,\neither at the business school, or at Hopkins, where I went at night and took English and\nliterature and history. I don\u2019t know why I never signed up for a credit or a degree. I\ndidn\u2019t. But I was --",
        "Q: Nobody there to push you --",
        "A: Nobody to push me --",
        "Q: -- to encourage, I suppose.",
        "A: -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s really -- if I -- I -- and it used to bother me in my younger -- not at that\ntime, but much later years, that I felt deprived from the point of view of intellectual\nchallenges and education, as I thought education should have been. So I did very -- a lot\nto educate myself and I think I did quite adequately. But what I really would have liked, I\ndid not get and I think part of it is I wasn\u2019t encouraged and the other part of it is, I\nprobably wasn\u2019t motivated enough, either. So, there\u2019s -- you can\u2019t put a blame on\nanything, or anybody. And -- But I worked hard and then I got a job at Johns Hopkins,\nalso in a secretarial area and I was promoted and became supervisor of their outpatient\nclinic, and that was very nice work and very challenging and interesting. And I developed\nquite a few friendships, that was very nice. And met a young man who was not Jewish\nand thought that he was the right one, became engaged to him and then shortly -- much\nlater found out that he, too, was a little anti-Semitic and broke off the engagement. And --",
        "Q: Tell me about that. He obviously felt it didn\u2019t matter at first, and --",
        "A: Yeah, right. He -- I met him and at first it didn\u2019t matter and then, I think when he\nsensed I was losing interest in him, because I realized he was not the right person for me,\nhe -- he -- I broke off and he -- I broke off, as a matter of fact, it was very traumatic. I\ncared for him and I guess I really -- he had a vile temper and that worried me and I think\nhe drank too much and that worried me and when I broke off with him, I was very\nunhappy. And --",
        "Q: Your first big decision --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that you had made.",
        "A: And -- Right. And I went to Canada and we had very good friends in Montreal and I\nstayed with them for a little while and then got a job and worked in a children\u2019s hospital\nthere and I was there, on my own, for a year and it was a pretty good year. It was\nbittersweet, because it was difficult. I was still mourning the break off, but I realized too,\nI did the right thing. And I stayed for a year and then I came back to Baltimore and I saw\n-- | -- he was still around, and I saw him. He was almost -- You could almost call it\nstalking me, he would sometimes show up after work and I didn\u2019t like it and eventually, I\nthink he just left. And -- All right, then I had that very nice job at Hopkins, which was\nvery, very good. And then, one fine day, I get a telephone call -- oh, and of course, I\ncontinued to live with my parents. I guess that\u2019s what one did in those days. I continued\nto live with them and my mother was her usual, controlling self. I -- Where a -- Where\nare you going, when are you going, when are you coming back and so forth and so on.\nShe was not very happy about that young man, neither was my father, so -- oh, and the\nanti-Semitism surfaced when I broke off with him, the second time when I saw him\nagain. And then he -- I was out with him one night -- one evening and he was very down\non my father because my father had said to him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t -- don\u2019t trouble us any\nmore, don\u2019t bother us.\u201d\u2019 And then she said, \u201cWell, the world would had lo -- have lost\nnothing if your father had died in a concentration camp.\u201d So I got out of his car and I\nremember exactly where it was, it was late and that was it.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And then one fine day, my telephone rang and this man\u2019s voice identified himself as\nMax Schwarz and I s -- he said he\u2019s Dutch and I said, \u201cWonderful.\u201d He said, \u201cI got your\nname from my sister.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, who\u2019s your sister?\u201d\u2019 And he said, \u201cShelly\nFried.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cNever heard of her.

And after I\nhung up, I said to my mother, \u201cImagine this man.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cI know what this 1s\nabout.\u201d She had been in Israel to visit her sister and her niece said, \u201cI have a girlfriend\nwho has two brothers in the United States,\u201d one of whom was what is now my husband.\nSo, we went out and that was in 1955 and in 1956, we married.

And so, we met and we married\nand married in 1956 and moved to Washington, DC, because my husband was working\nfor the government. And we lived in -- almost at the edge of Georgetown for the first\nyear and then in 1957, our daughter was born and before she was born, we moved to\nMontgomery County. And I had worked a little bit before our daughter was born, then\nafter she was born, I did not work, and stayed home. Did a little free lance work here and\nthere. Took some courses here and there and then, in 1960, our son was born and in --\nthen I went with him to -- and this is interesting, I went with -- I enrolled him in a\ncooperative nursery school and met very nice women, very nice people. And I was\nalways very much aware of my lack of education, because there were all these American\nwomen, with all their degrees and this, that and the other and what did I have a degree in",
        "Q: And in this area, especially.",
        "A: Oh, and what did I have a degree in? Surviving. And I always had to think of my\ngrandmother, whom I once asked, \u201cWhat kind of schooling did you have, Oma?\u201d And\nshe said, in German, \u201cHibin in deshula deslabins gevasin.\u201d And -- In the school -- I have\nvisited the school of life. So, I kept telling myself, \u201cWell, you went to the school of life,\u201d\nbut it was not really -- not very satisfactory. In that nursery school, though, I met and\nbefriended a young woman who was doing freelance proofreading, and she asked me\nwould I be interested in doing some -- helping her with it. And of course I thought that\nwas wonderful, always having been very good in English and in spelling. And this\nwoman was the one and only one, too, who did not have a college education, so I guess\nthat\u2019s the connection. And she found -- she was a -- a single mom and she found all these\nwonderful jobs doing -- editing proofreading. And we formed a team and I did it with\nher. And then one day, we were doing a fairly big job for a company and she said, \u201cYou\nknow, I\u2019m not going to do this any more. I got a job teaching English at Sandy Springs\nFriends School. Why don\u2019t you take it over?\u201d And I took it over and went to deliver the\nwork and this was a start-up company in Bethesda, called Congressional Information\nService. And I took the work back and I said, \u201cI have taken over her job, and -- but I can\ndo a good job for you.\u201d They kept me -- And they kept me and eventually, they offered\nme a job on a part-time basis, doing what they called accuracy, or accuracy editing,\nwhich I did and enjoyed thoroughly, about 20 hours a week and then little by little, it\ncrept up and it crept up and it was 30 hours a week. In the meantime, of course, the\nchildren -- this is after some time. I started this in 19 six, well \u201865, so I was associated\nwith that company since \u201869, something like that. And it -- our children were well\nensconced in school, there were the two, Tanya and David and I worked for them. And\nthen I was made an assistant Managing Editor, and then I was made the coordinator for\nthe editorial departments. And then in 1970, they offered me the job of Human Resources\nDirector, which I took -- no, that\u2019s not true, that was in 1979, I became the Director of\nHuman Resources there and I ran it until my retirement in 1990. So, notwithstanding the\nfact that I did not have that famous, or --",
        "Q: Which only you were bothered by.",
        "A: Which only I was bothered by. I realized that I could achieve and I did achieve\nwithout it and I think it was a tremendous boost for me and my self esteem. So, that --\nthat basically was my life, or is -- has been my life and then when I retire, in 1990, of\ncourse I have various and sundry connections here and there and one of which was I\nknew this young woman who was -- who worked for the Jewish Social Service agency.\nShe said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you come and do some workshops for us as a volunteer for our\nRussian refugees?\u201d Which I did, for about four years. I ran -- I taught the new immigrants\nhow to look for jobs, how to write resumes and how to do applications and things like\nthat. So, I did that for four years and various -- and then once in awhile, I did some\nfreelance work still, from my old companies. Matter of fact, I still did it a year ago. And\nraised the children and the children now -- some have children. The daughter, our\ndaughter --",
        "Q: Tanya.",
        "A: Tanya became a psychiatrist and I think that\u2019s what I'll do in my nec --",
        "Q: That must have made you very, very proud.",
        "Q: -- exactly, yes -- in my next life. And she lives in Baltimore and has two children. And\nour son David became an attorney and 1s a partner in a firm in Los Angeles, so yes, that\nmakes me feel very, very good, because they did what I didn\u2019t do.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And my husband and I continue to live a very full life here, taking care of this place\nand doing quite a bit of traveling and being involved in many different activities, so to\nsum it up, it -- life has been very good to me.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, I\u2019ve --",
        "A: My mother is living in Baltimore. She will be 95, and we talk every day, we see each\nother once a week and we -- once in awhile we reminisce about what was. She 1s still\nvery much of sound mind. I think it\u2019s been a role reversal, I think now, at this point, I\u2019m\nmore controlling or more -- she\u2019s more dependent on me, and that\u2019s fine. She still drives\nher car and she\u2019s a very amazing and still very active lady.",
        "Q: And your father died some time ago?",
        "A: And my father died in 1967 and I think -- I think, I know he had lung cancer. He was\na very heavy smoker. And fortunately, 1t was a short illness, but that was very traumatic.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And family, the cousin who was so wonderful to me when I first came and gave me\nmy mail with my banana, she still lives in Baltimore. She -- Her sister and we have\nalways remained very close. And so I have a lot of family. And family in Israel, too,\ncousins, and -- with whom we are very close, also. So it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s very nice.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you go to synagogue regularly? Do you --",
        "A: No. We are not synagogue goers and even though my husband came from this very\nreligious -- he said, when he was in Geneva, he was still very observant and then one day\nhe decided, well, it doesn\u2019t make sense, and he started to smoke on the Shabbat, no\nlonger wore a beraid and we never affiliated ourself -- we are very Jewish and very --\nwell, what? We just do not go to -- we don\u2019t belong to a synagogue, but our grandson --\nour son was never Bar Mitzvahed, our grandson was, this past -- this past April, and as a\npresent, we took him to Holland and we showed him where we both lived, where my\nhusband lived and where I lived and where I was in hiding and he met --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nSusie Schwarz. This is tape number three, side A.",
        "A: I think I forgot something very important, namely that -- obviously, I went back to\nHolland, after I was here for a number of years, to wit -- we went in 1967. At that time,\nthe wife of the farmer where my father was, was still alive. And as we approached the\nhouse, she was sitting there and shelling beans and she looked up and recognized me.\nAnd she was very happy to see me. And that was very emotional, very. And she looked at\nme and she said, \u201cMy, my,\u201d in Dutch, of course, \u201cthose were terrible times, but we\u2019d do\nthe same thing all over again.\u201d I remember I dissolved in tears. And in \u201867, they still, on\nthe farm where we were in hiding, the hiding place was still intact, so I could show it to\nmy husband. But -- And then we continued to go every few years, to visit the farmers, the\n-- the surviving ones, the children and we always were in touch with them, we -- on\nbirthdays ... As I said, we -- we -- well, we write on birthdays and during the holidays,\nNew Year, Christmas, I call them and chat with them. And the Hartamings, that are the\npeople where we were, the only one that is still in Holland is daughter Lida, and her\nhusband Herman, who was my teacher and three brothers and a sister had immigrated to\nCanada, and incidentally, we are in touch with them, too. They visited us here, once and\nwe\u2019 ve been there a few times and we talked to them and we write to them and this past\nsummer, we visited them. And they are still very religious and, is also moving, because\nwhen we visit with the one son and we have a small repast, he will sit and say his prayers\nand always thank God th-that he still can see us. Anyhow, to go back to Holland, so we\ntook our grandson and showed him --",
        "Q: And how old was he?",
        "A: He -- Now.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: When he was 13.",
        "Q: Yeah, I know, but his age, I --",
        "A: Yes, uh-huh, 13. And we --",
        "Q: Same age as you were?",
        "A: Right. And he was quite -- well, impressed is not the word, he -- when I ask him what\nwas the highlight of your whole trip, because we did many wonderful things, we went\nboating, hiking, biking and he said, \u201cYou know, being in the village where you grew up\nand s -- meeting the people and seeing where you stayed.\u201d And fortunately, the farm on\nwhich my father had stayed, the room where my father had slept was still there, so our\ngrandson could see it. So, that was really quite a -- a nice experience. And I think he got a\nlot out of it, so that was good and incidentally, when he was in fourth grade, he asked me\nonce would I come to his school and speak to his class about what happened and I did,\nand --",
        "Q: Now, is this in LA?",
        "A: No, the -- our son in LA does -- is not married.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, oh, it\u2019s --",
        "A: It\u2019s the daughter who lives in Baltimore.",
        "Q: -- Tanya\u2019s children --",
        "A: It\u2019s Tanya\u2019s children.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I went to his school and I spoke to his classmates. They were very interested and\nof course, he was very proud to have his Oma come and -- and tell them about what life\nwas like, once upon a time. So, all this makes for very wonderful things and wonderful\nliving. And our farmers, in 1994, were honored by Yad Vashem, in the Netherlands, and\nthat was very beautiful too, because the Canadians all came for the occasion -- not all, but\nsome of them came for the occasion and Lida and Herman\u2019s children were there. And it\nwas a very beautiful ceremony and a very beautiful gathering, and --",
        "Q: Now, w-were a whole group of people who had hidden Jews in the ceremony\ntogether, or was it just your --",
        "A: There were two other --",
        "Q: So it was very small?",
        "A: Yes. Two other -- well, and the reason it was so small is it\u2019s late.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And there, too, it is something -- it should have been done -- I should have done it\nmuch earlier than what I -- what I did and I was not even aware of how this could be\ndone, but I did it and I\u2019m so happy that we were able to do it.",
        "Q: You sent the documentation and so on?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Oh [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, yes, I did. As a matter of fact, when I was in Israel, I went to Yad Vashem and I\ncontacted the -- the proper people there to set it all in motion and it took a couple years.\nAnd I was very nervous that nothing should happen to any of them --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- before, and luckily, it didn\u2019t, and it was very, very beautiful, and --",
        "Q: I was thinking of your -- as you spoke of the friendship, how wonderful that was, but\nwondering if there are ways in which you can thank them, and of course, that was the\nmost super way of doing it.",
        "A: Yeah, it was a superb way of doing it. Whatever you do, it -- 1t can never -- you can\nnever thank them.",
        "Q: No. And we never know --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- 1f we were in that position, whether we would -- whether we would all do the right\nthing.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: And they did.",
        "A: Yes, exactly, and I often say this, there is no way I can thank them. I did this and this\nis fine, because they will go down in history as having been amongst the righteous.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And it will be wonderful for their children to be aware of -- they are -- who are aware\nof that, too, but as far as our role is concerned, there is nothing we can do to ever show\nthem our gratification. There -- You cannot humanly do that, because what they did was\nso extraordinary, putting their lives and their house and their children on the line for three\ntotal strangers.",
        "Q: Yes. And it\u2019s -- even like the fact that they were fairly poor, relatively uneducated --",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: -- and yet, they behaved in the most --",
        "A: In a noble --",
        "Q: -- wonderful -- yes, noble --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- princely, I was going to say, but noble.",
        "A: Noble way, exactly.",
        "Q: Yeah, according to, sort of higher standards of [indecipherable]",
        "A: Exactly, exactly. That\u2019s precisely correct. And was it religion or whatever it was, it\u2019s\njust -- and even now, whenever we go and see them, especially the daughter, there is\nsomething very beautiful about their presence. And they still like to talk about the times,\nbut never in a -- a sad way, well just reminiscing what -- what happened, but always with\nthe feeling, well, what happened -- what we did, it was right.",
        "Q: Yes. Has life been good to Lida, the daughter?",
        "A: I think so. Her-Herman became the principal of a school and I think -- and they have\nfive children and they in turn have children and I think they have a very good family life.\nOne son 1s -- had a brain tumor, and that\u2019s very sad. He\u2019s terribly handicapped, and he\nlives with them, but they seem to be quite positive and upbeat and the Canadians are a\nvery happy and wonderful people. And I learned something interesting there too, when\nwe were there just now, that the son\u2019s wife -- in other words, was Lida\u2019s sister-in-law,\ncame from a family -- the father was a minister and she told us that one brother was killed\nbecause he worked in the underground. One sister did nothing but transport Jewish\nchildren to and from hiding places .The mother was engaged in -- imprisoned in\nunderground work. The father, a minister, was sent to a work camp -- concentration camp\n-- was sent -- came home again. And it\u2019s so amazing when you hear how many people\ndid what they did, it\u2019s awesome.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Very awesome.",
        "Q: Even Lida herself, you told a story in your previous interview of her being threatened\nby German officers --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- when they searched the farmhouse and showed her courage then 1n risking --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right, exactly, because it was something she believed, and that -- and no matter how\nthreatening they were and intimidating they were, she was going to stand her ground.\nAnd I think they -- they were really -- and -- and when we visit, we talk about the\ncourage and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s awesome.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So amazing.",
        "Q: You know, another thing, stays in my mind 1s the -- the -- the mother\u2019s wrestling with\nthe issue of having sworn on the Bible that she was hiding no Jews, but in fact, again,\nthat -- an ordinary person, but what she did was correct and she found her way of --",
        "A: Yes -- justifying it.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, she justified it to herself and my mother said to her, \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t worry\nabout it, because swearing, we --\u201d",
        "Q: To these people.",
        "A: \u201c-- falsely, that\u2019s -- God will forgive you.\u201d And I think she -- she sort of\nacknowledged that, but nonetheless she -- she had a very nice way to circumvent -- circ --\nyes, to sort of get around it.",
        "Q: Yes, which was?",
        "A: That, well, they were Jewesses, after all. She was pretty wonderful. They were all very\nwonderful and they still -- the ones that are still -- are wonderful, the ones that we see.",
        "Q: Now, how -- you -- I know that you\u2019ve spoken about how many farming people hid\nJews, but what were the numbers overall? I mean, was it a -- really a tiny minority of\nlives that were saved of the Jewish pop --",
        "A: In the -- As to the Dutch -- the area where I lived, eastern Holland, and a fairly\nisolated area I would call it, there were quite a number of people that did save -- that did\ntake in Jews. Some for mercenary reasons, because I had heard of cases where, money\ngone, you\u2019re gone now, too and that happened, but I don\u2019t know how many instances\nthere were. I did hear about it, but all in all, after the war, or not even after the war, in\nrecent years I learned that the Dutch percentage -- the Dutch people were not as helpful\nor as cooperative with respect to saving Jews, as some of the other countries did, but even\nsome eastern European countries had a higher rate, shall we call it, of having saved or\nmanaged to help Jews, than the Dutch did. And part of 1t may have been the government,\nbecause when the war broke out, the queen hotfooted it over to England and the Princess\nJulianna and her children went to Canada. And I think Prince Bernard served 1n the -- in\nthe English army or some -- in the Dutch division, I think, of the English army, I don\u2019t\nknow. But, articles have said, or books have said, that Queen He -- Wilhelmina could\nhave done more to help her Jewish compatriots than she did and apparently, according to\nliterature, she had sort of said, yes, it\u2019s too bad what\u2019s happening, but has not made a real\ntremendous effort to help. And perhaps that set the tone, I don\u2019t know, but the NSB in\nHolland, the Dutch Nazi party, was quite active and again, more people could have been\nhelped than were helped, as compared to the French, who had a higher record of having\nsaved people. Course, the Danes were amazing. Belgium and so forth. Holland came out\nvery low on the list and I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know why.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: [really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And then you had your policeman friend, who was again, si -- he wasn\u2019t putting his\nlife on the line or anything, but -- but wa -- seems to have had his values in order and\nwhat -- wh -- I mean, do you have any thoughts about why he would take the position he\ntook, when other neighbors --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Yeah, exactly.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s interesting. He lived next door and across the street from us were other\npeople and they had a little girl who must have been my age. And shortly after the war\nbroke out, perhaps a year after it, all of a sudden, the child was no longer allowed to play\nwith me and then we learned that the father had joined the NSB. Now, Mr. Fisher, that\npoliceman next door to us -- he was born in Germany, interestingly -- he had told us, he\nsaid, \u201cWatch out for the neighbor across the street, he joined the party.\u201d He -- He was just\na totally unprejudiced man, as was a neighbor two doors further down, who was also a\nlow level official in the local government, who was also very pro-Jewish and also very\ninterested in us and incidentally, I think that he too knew -- yeah, he knew we were going\ninto hiding so he es -- he -- he was very helpful and very well aware of it. So there you\nhave two people who were helpful -- didn\u2019t put their life on the line, but at the same time,\ndid not hesitate to have commerce with us, which is -- which was very brave in later\ntimes, when we were no longer supposed to be associating with non-Jewish people and\nthey -- they did. Their daughter, incidentally, still lives in Holland and has remained a\ngood friend of mine. So, it -- I -- I don\u2019t know and I also don\u2019t know in general what the -\n- what the beliefs in -- of the people in the village were. I knew there were quite an few\nNSB, but others, who were sort of invisible and I don\u2019t know what -- what -- what their\nbeliefs were or what their support was for one or the other.",
        "Q: Id like to go back to your -- to your marriage and it certainly seemed to me that\neverything about Max was right and then that sort of, if you theorized about someone\u2019s\nbackground being suitable for a lasting, happy life -- even his -- his experiences -- you\nboth survived the Holocaust and I know that neither of you feel that you suffered as\npeople did who survived the camps and so on --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- but, I wonder if you\u2019ve thought much about that suitability, compatibility?",
        "A: Well, I th -- Compatibility, it\u2019s interesting, because in a way, we came from opposite\nbackgrounds and opposite everything. What we had in common is, we were raised in the\nsame country, we spoke the same language and we were both Jewish. We had survived\nthe Holocaust, and that\u2019s another topic that I want to address brief -- albeit briefly. Yes,\nsurvive the Holocaust we did, but I never considered myself a survivor as I do consider\nthose people that were in the camps and my husband feels very much the same way. I\nwish there were another word for it, becau -- in a way, it\u2019s a misnomer. Perhaps it should\nbe called, you know, concentration camp survivor, versus a hidden person or -- there\nmust be another word for it, because I think what we went through was a snap, honestly,\ncompared to what people suffered in all the different camps. And my husband feels very\nstrongly about that, too. That people such as we, or some of the people that he has seen\non tape because of his volunteer work that he does in the oral history, are not really that\nmuch related to the -- should not really be pegged as survivors. They may have played a\nrole of sorts, but it\u2019s -- the people that survived the concentration camps should be in a\ncategory all to themselves, that\u2019s really, I think, an important thing to know -- to be aware\nof, because they are unique, I think. What I think is very sad, though, 1s, with all that has\nhappened, with the awareness, with the education, with the -- the Schindler\u2019s List,\netcetera, etcetera, man\u2019s inhumanity to man continues. So what has -- what has history\ntaught us? I don\u2019t know. This I find very disturbing and very shocking. I mean, if you\nthink about Kosovo, it\u2019s frightening. So, have we not learned anything? I guess not.",
        "Q: We have to keep -- keep telling the story and re-reminding ourselves and each other\nand that\u2019s -- that\u2019s so -- analogous, because they\u2019re people just like us, enjoying the same\nway of life and so on.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. But telling the story over and over, of course, is good and having\nthe museum is more than good. It\u2019s a wonderful, educational thing and I think the more\nmuseums are created, the better it is. And I think people are very keen on learning about\nit, so long term, I guess it will -- hopefully it will have some sort of positive effect on\npeople, but -- at least over here. I really don\u2019t know. It\u2019s an eye opener for many people. I\nsee people going in and out of the museum and if you look at their expressions they are\nquite shocked and astonished and it\u2019s very difficult for them and for the children it\u2019s very\ngood to learn about it. That\u2019s one of the reasons I felt -- when my grandson wanted me to\ngo to his school, why not? But I don\u2019t know how much of this education is being spread\nin other places, and in other countries, given the fact that so many atrocities are still\ntaking place.",
        "Q: And you know -- We know about them instantly.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. As they happen. And that\u2019s -- That makes it all the more shocking. So, I\ndon\u2019t know what the world will look like, 10 - 20 - 30 years from now, but I hope some\nof these killing fields will -- will be gone.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You -- Wh-When we mentioned the -- the Holocaust museum, do you think\nthat that might be a phase of this great popularity, that it might be a passing fad, or do\nyou think that the -- the institution and the message really are much bigger than that?",
        "A: I would think it\u2019s not a phase. I would hope it is not a phase and I would think that the\ninstitution and the message are what -- something that will endure, because there will\nalways be other generations with some curiosity about what was, just like there 1s still a\ncuriosity about the Civil War, or any of these events that have happened in history. I\nthink this will continue to be of the same interest as time goes on, I would hope. I think\nso, because as long as the textbooks and the -- the educators show that this was an\nimportant part of history, the likes of these museums will continue to be of interest to the\n-- to the public, I guess -- I hope.",
        "Q: I wonder to what extent your own experiences have had an impact on your -- the\nposition you\u2019ve taken as a -- an American citizen in dealing even with -- we were\nspeaking of the -- the war in Bosnia. Do you think that in all these cases -- I\u2019m thinking\nof the -- all the things that have happened historically since you came here, do you want\nto comment on your perspective?",
        "A: Too many. Too many things have happened since I came here, and the Kosovo and\nthe African wars and so forth and so on. Remember when, in Rwanda, when there were\nall these problems, I kept saying, \u201cWell, history 1s repeating itself, because the world 1s\nstanding by and nothing --\u201d and I felt so impotent, in -- in some ways I felt as if I should\npack up and go and do something, knowing fully well, what can I do there? And then I s -\n- chide myself or deride myself and say, \u201cWell, if -- that\u2019s not the right attitude to take,\neither. If you feel that strongly, you ought to go and do something. You are no better than\npeople were at that time.\u201d So, I get very enraged, and very frustrated. Obviously, other\nthan giving some financial help, I didn\u2019t do anything. And when I look on the television\nscreen and I see what\u2019s going on in Kosovo, I feel the same way. Well, why isn\u2019t our\ngovernment more active and why -- and yes, you can write letters to your congresspeople\nand we do, when we feel the need, but that\u2019s where our involvement then ends and in\nsome ways, it\u2019s not enough. I get this -- this -- this feeling of indignation, how dare\npeople be this way, still, after all that has happened? And I sometimes think we as a\nnation ought to get more involved in it, but it doesn\u2019t always happen that way.",
        "Q: But it would have influenced your political position and so on?",
        "A: Yes, of course. As a matter of fact, that\u2019s why I said, the only voice I have is by\nexpressing it in writing, by writing to my representative or my senator. Unfortunately, my\nrepresentative 1s not of the right beliefs, but the senators in the state of Maryland are and\nthey just -- the only thing we can do 1s encourage them.",

        "Q: This is an continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Susie Schwarz. This is tape number four, side A. Tell me about how much of your\nexperiences you shared with your children.",
        "A: Well, as I started to say, this is interesting, because when my husband and I first met,\nof course we talked about our backgrounds and what happened to him, what happened to\nme and in general, and very much aware of each of our histories. And then we married\nand we really never talked about it any more -- very little. Perhaps alluded to it here and\nthere. And then the children came, Tanya first, in \u201857 and David in 1960 and I think\nneither one of us ever really made it a point to -- to sit down and say, \u201cWell, you want to\nknow about what happened to us.\u201d We may have touched it, we may have talked about it\nhere and there, but not in depth. And I think, as we got older, as the -- as we were less\ninvolved in the children\u2019s lives, namely once they were out of college and out on their\nown, if you will, I think much later we started to think more about it and to discuss it\nmore. And even, you know, going more into details of what happened to us, particularly\nin my case, because my husband was always much more reluctant to talk about it\nbecause, you know, his parents, of course, had a very horrible ending. And, as we\nsometimes said, he never really had a chance to grieve for them and it was always a little\ndifficult for him to talk about it. And as time went on, it wasn\u2019t as if we were hiding\nanything. We answered and they knew I was in hiding and where I was in hiding and so\nforth and so on. But I think 1t became very much topic A after I -- after we got involved\nwith the Holocaust Museum and after I gave my testimony and after my t -- my tape. And\nI think then, we started to talk much more about what was than we did in the earlier\nyears. And I think part of it -- I really wasn\u2019t deliberate -- I think 1t was more we were\nvery much engaged in working, bringing up children and making a life and did not really\ndwell on what was. And I think, as we got older, we thought back, more about what\nhappened and it\u2019s a reminiscence, really. And again, as I said, the tape was sort of a -- a\nfinal presentation to them, as to the what and the whereabouts -- the wheres. Also, my\nsister-in-law in Israel just recently sent a little praysee on their trip from Holland to\nGeneva. She wrote it in Dutch and my husband 1s going to translate it, also, again, for all\nthe children to have. But all this interestingly, happened really in our later lives and not\nearly on and I think there\u2019s a good reason for it.",
        "Q: How did you come to give testimony at the museum? Did they contact you or did you\nget in touch with them?",
        "A: I got in touch with them. As a matter of fact, my cardiologist, his -- what was to be his\ndaughter-in-law, worked at the museum and my cardiologist, I -- I had told him where --\nwhere I had been in the war and he told me to contact her or I contacted her, I don\u2019t\nremember, but that\u2019s how I made contact with them regarding the testimony.",
        "Q: And would you comment on what it\u2019s meant to you and your husband to volunteer at\nthe museum\u2019?",
        "A: Interestingly, my husband -- we were invited to the opening of the museum and he did\nnot want to go. It was difficult for him emotionally and then I went and toured the\nmuseum and I thought it was very well done, but he did not go with me. I took my\nmother, as a matter of fact. And he told me he couldn\u2019t, it was too difficult and too\nemotional. And then one day, I was out of town and when I came back he said, \u201cI went to\nthe museum.\u201d And he was really very impressed and he had spoken to someone in the\nphoto lab -- I don\u2019t know how -- and coincidentally, she -- this lady in the photo lab --\ncan\u2019t think of her name right now, Genya -- Genya Marcon was her name, had -- her\nfamily name was the same as someone that my husband used to know in Amsterdam, and\ntalked to her and she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and volunteer?\u201d And that\u2019s how he became\nand he\u2019s been very involved and very, very much engaged and then drew me in, too. But\nit took a little while.",
        "Q: Yes, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sorry not to be asking him about this, but I wonder if that is something\nthat he feels he\u2019s doing as a tribute to his parents?",
        "A: Probably. I would think so. It\u2019s a -- Probably, yes, that is so.",
        "Q: I wonder if you have any thoughts, too, about the ways in which the -- all the\nHolocaust survivors, of the camps and of -- those who were in hiding, or -- those who\ncame to America, do you have any thoughts about ways in which they have enriched life\nin this country? Wh-What they have given to the United States?",
        "A: That\u2019s difficult to answer, because I have not really thought about that, so it w -- it\u2019s\ngoing to be a pretty superficial answer. There are many of them who have made\nsignificant contributions to United States and life in the United States, I think. As\nwitnessed by the people that are very actively involved there, Mr. Lerner, and --\nLehrman, I mean, Miles Lehrman and so forth and Benjamin Neeves. They have done\nwonderful things. And I\u2019m sure there are very many others. I want to add, though,\nsomething else. There 1s the hidden child -- it\u2019s -- what 1s it called? Fonde -- no, not. The\nhidden child -- can\u2019t think of the other word. It\u2019s a group of surviving children that were\nin hiding. I have been -- They were in touch with me, I know someone who\u2019s involved in\nit. and I don\u2019t very much believe in all these organized, you know, th-the children of\nsurvivors and the hidden children, how helpful that is or how meaningful all that is. I\nguess, to join together and to discuss what -- what happened, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very\nproductive.",
        "Q: You mentioned speaking at your grandson\u2019s school.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you do much speaking about your experience, or was that a rare occasion?",
        "A: No, that was -- No, ac -- as a matter of fact, it was at my grandson\u2019s school and then I\nmet a lady who belongs to a church and she asked me would I speak to her church group\nand I did and as a matter of fact, the church group was so awfully nice, they send a\ndonation to the museum, which was lovely. Other than that, no, I haven\u2019t.",
        "Q: I want to ask you what -- what your views are on this quotation, it\u2019s just something\nthat I think the Holocaust museum thought was of interest and it\u2019s Prime Minister\nNetanyahu saying, \u201cThis is the lesson of the Holocaust, this and only this. That the\nexistence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish sovereignty and a Jewish army that rests\non the strength of Jewish faith.\u201d And that\u2019s something that Netanyahu had said in\nceremonies after a -- after the march to remember the Holocaust.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But, do you have any comment on that?",
        "A: I think that\u2019s hard to comment on. In other words, what he\u2019s saying 1s really it\u2019s the\nJewish faith and in a way the Jews bonding, sticking together, that helps us survive. I\nthink the state of Israel has been -- the creation of the state of Israel has been a very\nimportant milestone for the Jews and I think without the existence of the state of Israel, I\nthink we would be far more vulnerable than we are now. Desperate you mean, while in\nhiding?",
        "Q: Yeah. Really, I\u2019m interested in knowing the -- since there were times when, in your\ntestimony, you really are using a -- a real sense of humor that perhaps your mother used.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",

        "Q: -- showing that humor was keeping you going, but I wondered what the funniest times\nwere and the most -- and the most dreadful. The most anguishing or desperate.",
        "A: Well, I think the most desperate or anguishing times was when I was fully aware how\nvery ill I was and it was frightening, because my hearing at that time was impaired. So\nthat was very, very -- and -- and the frustration of being indoors all the time was very,\nvery difficult, where I couldn\u2019t see the sunshine and had a real longing for the sunshine.\nAnd the happy time was that one and only time when they carried me out into the wheat\nfields and I did see the sun. Funny, no. There was not very much that was funny. The\nmice procreating above us, maybe it was funny. Oh no, no I can\u2019t say there was anything\nreally light, no. And anguishing, yes, to me there was always a certain fear,\nnotwithstanding my mothers constant optimism, are we going to get out of here and\nwhat\u2019s going to happen once we get out of there. No, I can\u2019t really address that too well.",
        "Q: Are there times in life now when you\u2019re suddenly -- you spoke of your dreams before,\nbut I wondered if there\u2019s a fabric or a smell or a situation which will suddenly take you\nback to that time?",
        "A: No, not -- not really. It\u2019s interesting, I can store it away. I really think very little about\nthe time and there is nothing that, as you sa - -ask, fabric smell or smell -- maybe if I\ndrive past a silo, I will suddenly say, \u201cHm, that smells familiar.\u201d But other than that, no.\nIt\u2019s a part of life that\u2019s finished. Not forgotten, but not with me every day, because there\u2019s\ntoo much every day that is with me and that I need to look forward to and want to look\nforward to, so no.",

        "Q: What happened to the brother in the Netherlands?",
        "Q: Was she a very cultivated person, who\u2019d love music and theater and so on that cities --\ncity life would offer?",
        "Q: You were an only child?",
        "Q: And I\u2019m interested in knowing if you would suppose that to be the case because by\nthe time you were born, there was clear -- clearly ominous signs on the horizon?",
        "Q: Well, you know a thought occurs to me. It\u2019s interesting that your mother would seem\nto be perhaps a -- a little self centered and yet, when tested by life, she came through with\nsuch flying colors, of courage and fortitude and optimism, which is remarkable. I wonder\nif you think those strengths in both your parents really came through s -- a spiritual\nsense? A s -- Convictions that were deep in the background?",
        "Q: Now you had taken identity papers from the Pagrachs when you went into hiding.\nWhat was the purpose for doing that?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Yes. So, was she -- was she also a child?",
        "Q: Now, moving along, what I was interested in knowing how you -- how your father\narranged the hiding places and whether his ability to reward somebody financially had\nany role in that. O-Or whether people would be given help through the organized\nresistance.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Why do you think these people did this and put their lives on the line?",
        "Q: Yes. I\u2019m jumping ahead also, to that wonderful moment you describe, o-of the -- at\nthe end of the war, when you gave thanks in the kitchen. And I wonder if you\u2019d talk more\nabout that. And I was interested also, when your host family -- and I think it was the\nmother who prayed, were -- did you also -- those of you who were Jewish, did you also\noffer thanks? Do you remember if there was more to the ceremony\u201d?",
        "Q: Do you have a memory of the shape that people were in physically then? Would your\nparents -- I mean, would you be sitting in your -- the arms of one of your parents at that",

        "Q: They do -- I was struck by the kindness of the farm people, which you talk about also.\nThe occasion when you became sick with rheumatic fever, was when the farm daughter\nhad stayed with you, because it was one of -- your mother\u2019s only visit, I think, to your\nfather, but I thought it\u2019s -- it\u2019s striking kindness and sharing that went on.",

        "Q: Yeah, I -- I also wondered -- you mentioned on the videotape, your father, the day he\nleft to go into hiding. Do you remember more about that moment or that day of saying\ngood-bye to him? It must have been hard.",
        "Q: I was just thinking of possessions. Were there particular things that you had in your\nknapsack when you went into hiding, that really comforted and were precious to you or\nto you and your mother during the years of hiding?",
        "Q: Do you ever have dreams and if so, sort of what has -- what have you dreamt of, of\nthis time?",
        "Q: Did you ever find out what had happened to them?",
        "Q: Would they have thought of leaving the country, do you know? Wh-What was in my\nmind was whether he would feel that it was important that he continue with his people t-\nto the end.",
        "Q: I wanted to -- you to tell me, first of all, in your first few months in hiding, when you\nwere in the coffin, what do you remember about following each day and having a sense\nof time then? And then go on to tell me how your mother coped and whether she was\nable to deal with the situation more ably than your father in his hiding place. And to what\nextent she always kept up her defenses.",
        "Q: Tell me about the one occasion when your mother did let her feelings -- reveal her\nfeelings to you, of disappointment.",

        "Q: And immediately, that was under way.",
        "Q: Yeah. Why was the -- Why would it have been a disaster to be at the village school?",

        "Q: Was that quite a sacrifice for your parents to send you there, or did the school give\nscholarships, or --",
        "Q: Yes, I wonder if you have any memories about the attitudes of the other children\nthere? Were they at all anti-Semitic? Did you talk openly about what had happened? Not\njust the -- to the Jews, but really, do you remember discussions about the war, and what\nthey\u2019d all si -- gone through?",
        "Q: You know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m remembering that when I was first told your story in just brief\ndetails, in my mind, of course, was Anne Frank and her diary, but, do you think that there\nare any things in Anne Frank\u2019s story or experiences that are -- that you share in common\nwith her? Superficially, your experiences were very similar.",
        "Q: Yes. It does -- It seems to me, too, that she may have been more living a life of the\nmind when you were also so bonded with your mother, who may have been discouraging\nthat. You may have survived emotionally unscathed, as you said you had, partly because\nyou were keeping in the present. Maybe remaining a child longer than you would have\notherwise.",
        "Q: And it may have been a blessing, yes.",
        "Q: Yes. And, what about physically, the physical aftermath of the -- the hiding?",
        "Q: Mm, it\u2019s u -- it\u2019s actually a funny term to use, you being sheltered, captive.",

        "Answer: I\u2019m Susie Schwarz. I was born in Germany, on May the third, 1931 in a little\ntown called Schlichtern, which is near the city of Frankfort, Germany. My father\u2019s name\nwas Max Greenbaum -- or Greenbaum and he was born in November of 1897, also in\nSchlichtern. My mother\u2019s maiden name was Kaita Kahn and she came from what is now\ncalled Badbuchau, in southern Germany. Her birthdate is December eight, 1903 and for\nthe record, she is still living and well in Baltimore, Maryland. She married my father in\nMarch of 1930, after a whirlwind courtship and moved with him to Schlichtern and lived\nthere together with his family, his mother and several siblings. My father, as a trade,\nworked as a horse -- or was a horse dealer. They sold -- bought and sold horses and sold\nthem mostly to farmers, I believe, and seemed to have made a very good living, because\nthey lived very comfortably there in Schlichtern, as I was told. However, in 1933, he felt\nthat the political situation was such that he was no longer comfortable staying in\nGermany. He was worried that things would go from bad to worse and decided to go to\nEngland. I was told that he left in search of new opportunities and went to -- through the\nNetherlands to go to England. However, he stopped in a little town in Holland called\nDinksburlow and there he was -- he was given a contact with a family by the name of\nPagrach, P-a-g-r-a-c-h. And when he told them that he was going to go to German -- to --\nsorry -- to England, they said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here? In the Netherlands, you will be\nvery safe, and they do need a horse dealer here. There are lots of farmers who are always\nin need of new horses. And also, there are some people that are interested in riding\nhorses.\u201d Well, it appears that he allowed himself to be dissuaded from going to England,\nand remained. And obviously sent, shortly thereafter, for my mother and me. I, at that\ntime, was two years old. So, the two of us came to Holland and my recollections\nobviously are not too clear. With regard to my parents beliefs and opinions, I have a\nfeeling that my mother in particular, felt German first, Jewish second. I think my father\nmay have been a little bit more neutral in that area. By the way, my mother came from a\nfairly Orthodox family. Her father went to synagogue a lot and I don\u2019t know if they had a\nreally, strictly kosher home, but they were fairly observant. My father\u2019s family, however,\nwas not. I don\u2019t think they were either very religious or very much associated with a\nsynagogue or community, as such. I think they were more interested in their business and\nmy grandfather, incidentally, also was in the same line of business -- my paternal\ngrandfather. And interestingly, my mother\u2019s father was a cattle dealer, slash, farmer. I am\nnot too sure how politically active or conscious they were, other than the threat of\nNazism. But, other than that, I don\u2019t think they were involved in any party or political\norganizations. My father did serve in the German army in the first World War. I do not\nknow in what capacity, but he was a soldier, I don\u2019t know what rank he ever -- if any, he\nachieved. In any case, my mother\u2019s family, just to complete the picture, consisted of her\nparents, a brother -- an older brother and sister, who incidentally, went to Israel in \u201837 or\n\u201838. The mother, having been left behind for good reasons, because they wanted to\nestablish themselves first in Israel, and therefore, the mother remained in Buchau --\nBadbuchau. My father\u2019s family consisted of three brothers, two sisters and of course, my\nfather. All of the former went to the United States also, in -- I assume it was in 1938, with\nthe exception of one younger brother, who also went to the Netherlands. So, that is for\nbackground information on the family in Germany. I --",
        "A: Good question. The brother in the Netherlands, did not think that anything was going\nto happen to him. Incidentally, he lived in Amsterdam, and when my father did say to\nhim -- his name was Ludwig, \u201cLudwig, things are getting tight. Don\u2019t you think you\nshould go into hiding?\u201d Ludwig had responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to go to Westerbork, and\nI know that\u2019s where many of them are going and I\u2019m sure I will be all right.\u201d Obviously,\nhe was not all right, he was killed in Sobibor. However, all the others, they lived and\nthrived in Baltimore, Maryland. So, to get back to Holland, we -- we settled in -- in\nHolland. These very nice people by the name of Pagrach found us a home and\nincidentally, they almost become surrogate family to us. They found us a home across the\nstreet and I seemed to have really bonded with them, calling them Uncle Ohm -- Ohm\nand Tumter and Oma and Opa, in lieu of having any Omas or Opas around me. So, my\nfather started his new life and seemed to do quite nicely, I think, from an economic point\nof view, we -- we were all right. My mother was and still is, a very gregarious woman\nand she quickly made friends. In the German Jewish community, it seems that in the\ntown of Dinksburlow, a lot of German Jews came over the border and settled there. And\nmy mother managed to make contact with some of them and she used to have her\nSaturday afternoon coffee klatches with them and seemed to be fairly content with her\nlife, although I think living in a small town like that must have been a little bit frustrating\nto her. I really don\u2019t know if she was always very happy living in Dinksburlow.",
        "A: No, unfortunately she was not -- was not and is not. She was a very good looking,\nyoung woman and I think somewhat indulged in by both her father, as well as my father.\nShe was more interested in being courted than perhaps going to theaters, to concerts, to\nmovies, etcetera. She read. I don\u2019t know how much she read, but she read. I really don\u2019t\nknow what her interests at that time were, other than to be able to set a nice table and to\nentertain her friends. And my father was a very, very good provider, but he too did not\nseem to be very much connected with -- he was quiet with the community. He would go\non Saturdays to synagogue, which was the proper thing for everyone to do. He would\nplay cards, I believe, perhaps once a week with some of, again, the German Jews. They\nled a fairly self-contained life and there was really not much culture in and around that\narea. And this is sort of the atmosphere I grew up in. I adored my mother. I was very\nmuch attached to her, to the point where I would be with her if I could have been with\nher, morning, noon and night. I was less attached to my father. I guess I admired my\nmother. She was a very good looking, always very well groomed, dressed lady and I must\nhave been quite taken by that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. I asked my mother once why it was that I was an only child and she said, \u201cWell,\nthe circumstances were not exactly propitious to have more children. And of course,\nobviously, it was -- it was a g -- inadvertently, it was a good decision, because I think it\nwould have been very difficult for us to have found two hiding place -- I mean, hiding\nplaces for several children. I don\u2019t think I considered myself to be a very spoiled child,\nbut I don\u2019t know, of course, that\u2019s not for me to judge. My mother was very, very strict, a\nfairly tough taskmaster or mistress and I was expected to obey and she -- in many ways\nshe controlled me quite a bit, because if I were offered a cookie by a stranger, I would\nlook and see if she would nod and say yes, you may take the cookie, or no you may not\ntake the cookie. And expected to make my little curtsy when I shook hands with\nsomebody and things like that. She -- She was strict, my dad was not. He was more -- I\nthink he was more loving, a little warmer than she. I -- It\u2019s very hard to recall the en --\nreally, the environment too much. It -- I think, in many ways, that I perhaps got more\nnurturing from my adopted family, the Pagrachs or more attention from the Pagrachs,\nthan I might have gotten at home. It\u2019s very difficult to describe this so many, many years\nlater. In any case --",
        "A: I doubt it. I really, really doubt it, but I think your point 1s well taken. There was this\nsort of -- well, what? They were not -- They were not as warm or giving as I think they\ncould have been. I don\u2019t know, but spiritual? I think it was a matter of, we have to\nsurvive, we want to survive and no further thoughts were given to it. It\u2019s very possible. In\nany event, I would say it was a -- a good childhood, it was nothing extraordinary. I -- I\ngot what I think I should have gotten and what I needed and I had my little friends, who\nwould come to the house and play with me. I read a lot, I went to the library and got very\nmany books and I was encouraged to read. I think my mother read to me. My mother,\nincidentally played the piano and would play for me sometimes. But, I have no\nremembrances of either one of my parents ever playing with me, playing games or really\ndoing very many so-called fun things. I\u2019ve tried to -- to think if there were instances and\nthe only instance I can remember where I was taken somewhere just for my pleasure, was\nsome -- I guess you would call it a very fancy playground in another town. But then\nagain, my town, Dinksburlow, did not have many opportunities for very many activities,\nso we had to make our own. We certainly managed to do that and did it very, very well, I\nthink. So life in Dinksburlow really went on with friends and this -- the Pagrachs.",
        "A: No, I did not take identity papers of the Pagrachs when I went into hiding. I got those\npapers after the war. After the war, the Pagrachs came back to Dinksburlow to, they were\nin hiding. One sister perished, her name was Lien and I had the letter from the Red Cross\nin which they notified the family that Lien had died in Sobibor. I got that letter from\nLien\u2019s sister, whose name was Berta -- Bertha, and she also gave me other papers.",
        "A: And those are the papers I also turned over to the museum.",
        "A: No. The Pagrachs, there was a brother and there were two sisters and they were all\ncontemporaries of my parents. And the oldest sister came to the United States and lived\nnear us and as I said, I considered her truly an aunt and a member of the family and had a\nlot of fondness for her, and m -- when she came to -- we had her come to the United\nStates and when she came to New York and couldn\u2019t live there any longer, we moved her\nto Rockville and we looked after her there.",
        "A: Mm-Hm. Well, my father and -- arranged -- 1t was not done through an organized\nresistance. My father, because he knew very many farmers, had sort of, in a discreet way,\ntried to find who could he trust, who could he not trust and who could he contact and\nwho could he not contact. And found -- And knew a farmer with whom he had been\ndoing business and had sort of dropped a hint, saying, you know, things are getting tough\nfor us and when push comes to shove, I think we -- we probably have to try and hide\nourselves rather than report. And this man, whose name was Yolink and this figures very\nprominently in my survival, said, \u201cWell, I have these --,\u201d I think they were cousins of his\nand they were sh -- teachers. And he said, \u201cThey are involved in the underground\nmovement, or in the resistance movement and why don\u2019t you talk to them, because I\nthink they may know some people. But,\u201d he said, \u201cI, myself, would be more than happy\nto take you.\u201d And, so that was arranged, that my father would meet those two ladies. And\nthey -- And they\u2019d had probably a number of addresses, one -- two of whom were the\npeople where we ended up being in contact with. But, above all, Mr. Yolink said to my\nfather, \u201cI would be happy to kee-keep you, but not your wife and child, because I can\nonly take one person.\u201d And that\u2019s how we came to Yolink and then my father learned\nabout the other families, but did not meet them at all. It was just a name -- two names that\nwere given to him. And one of the families had said they would take me and the other\nfamily said they\u2019d take my mother and her mother, my grandmother, who, remember I\nsaid, had been left behind in Germany, and came to live with us.",
        "A: I think these people are -- first of all, they were -- especially the Hartamings where we\nstayed, were very deeply religious, they were Dutch Reformed and the Yolinks were also\nDutch Reformed, perhaps a tad less religious than the Hartamings were. I think it was\nreligion, slash, humanitarian need to help your fellow man, because interestingly -- and\nI\u2019m jumping ahead a little bit now, when I have spoken to them about why, they -- they\nsort of look at me in amazement and they say, \u201cWell, we\u2019d do it all over again.\u201d And\nYolink\u2019s son said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it was such a big deal.\u201d Well, it was a big deal\nindeed, because, after all, they put their lives and their farms and their families on the line\nfor us, but over and over, over the years, they have said, no, they would do it again and it\nwas only the right thing to do. So, I guess it was indeed Christian as well as\nhumanitarian.",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t really a ce -- I don\u2019t know if it wa -- 1t wasn\u2019t really a ceremony, it was\nall -- the war was over and we all came out of our little crevices and, as I had mentioned\nbefore, we sat around this, what looked to me like a huge, round table, the same table\nthey sat at every night and they ate their porridge and then they played the organ and they\nsang hymns. So that the day of liberation, Mutter Hartaming, Mother Hartaming said,\n\u201cWell, we should all sit down and eat,\u201d I guess the porridge or whatever it was, together\nand all of us did there, six, seven children, Father and Mutter Hartaming. My mother, my\nfather and I, two or three other young men that were s-semi hiding there and our\nneighbors, whom I talked about on my tape, that had crawled into the hole with us for the\nlast few weeks. And we all sat around that table and then Mutter Hartaming simply said,\n\u201cWell, let us pray.\u201d And we all sat and we bowed our heads and then she said, \u201cI want to\nthank the good Lord for having allowed us to survive this and to be able to save --\u201d and\nshe named all of us and sort of said, \u201cWe thank the good Lord.\u201d And we all sat and then\nwe said amen, and that was it and I think there were many a wet -- not too many dry eyes\nleft after that. Also, I think the Sunday after our liberation, we came back to the farm to\naccompany all of them to the church for a service, where we sat and prayed with them.\nWe looked at the prayer books and prayed with them. Being Jewish didn\u2019t make any\ndifference. And it was a very beautiful moment.\nfarmhouse table and think you were very weak, at the end of the war, but I wonder if the\nothers too, were poorly nourished and ragged in your clothing and so on?",
        "A: As a matter of fact, no. I think all of us who came out, probably looked as well as we\ndid when we went in. My mother, who was blonde, I think her har -- her hair may have\ndarkened a little bit. And I had gotten rather heavy and I think part of this was due to the\nillness, coupled with inactivity and I think I was a rather roly-poly, with long hair. My\nfather looked the same as he always did and the farmers themselves -- of course, we did\nnot suffer from any malnourishment. We were always very adequately provided for. It\nmay not have been gourmet food, but it certainly was good food and we -- what they had,\nthey shared with us. So no, I think -- and clothing-wise, it\u2019s funny -- I don\u2019t remember\nthat too well, I know I must have outgrown the few clothes that I had when I went in, but\nI also know that as soon as we came out, someone gave me clothes, perhaps some\nfriends, to fit me and my mother immediately went in search of her dressmaker and found\nsome material to have herself some dresses made. And dad had probably the same clothes\nhe had before the war, so there was no -- no problem there, and I know when the war was\nover, we went back to Dinksburlow and the first thing I did -- and I don\u2019t know why I did\nit, I had, at that time, very long braids, and I had them cut off, because I thought I had to\nstart to look a little older, but I don\u2019t think it helped.",
        "A: Precisely. My mother looked far -- well, my mother almost looked -- almost looked\nAryan, because of her blonde hair, her sort of bluish gray eyes, whereas my father and I\nwere typically Semitic looking people, very dark and that was another reason it was\nfortunate that I could go to the farm with my mother, rather than to the farm that I was\npegged to go to, because I could not have been free to roam around, since I did look too\nJewish.",
        "A: Oh, they were, they -- they all, each and every one of them were absolutely warm and\nloving and wonderful. The -- Actually, the father -- the head of the household, if you will,\nwe had very little interactions with and I think this was considered really to be a -- a\nwomen thing.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Well, of course, with respect to my childhood, there are memories. They\u2019re all sort of\njumbled. There is the memory of my grandmother coming, which was a major, major\nevent. She was my uncle\u2019s -- my uncle and aunt had left to go to Israel, she was left\nbehind. And then, I think in \u00b039, 1t was decided that she would come and stay with us\nuntil she could go to what was then still Palestine. And she was set to go -- she must have\nbeen in her late 60\u2019s, to me she looked ancient -- and came to a border town with all her\nearthly belongings, her jewelry and lots of luggage and she was sent back, which was a\ntremendous blow and I really don\u2019t know why that happened, but she was sent back to\nGermany and then was not able to come back til the following year, which was already in\n1940 or maybe it was even \u201c41, I don\u2019t know. And when she came to live with us, I was\nvery, very happy, because she did give me a lot of attention and she was always busy\nknitting, knitting sweaters for me and for my friends and would bake cakes and cookies\nand I would be allowed to help her. And she was very wonderful and my father, too,\nenjoyed her very, very much. But I think she was rather frail, and I mentioned this on the\ntape, too, she -- she died a few days before we went into hiding and that was all very\ntraumatic and very, very sad. But she played really a major role in my life.",
        "A: Our worldly goods -- some of our worldly goods were hidden, too. There were a few\ncontacts again that my father had, that said they would keep some of the furniture and\nfurnishings. And I know -- I think the silver was buried in the ground near our house.\nAnd some of the worldly goods were simply abandoned when we left -- when we went\ninto hiding. And when we came back after the war -- first of all, our house was 90 -- 85\npercent destroyed and my father said some of the furniture, he could even find in the\nwoods, still, it was just chopped up. But the people that had taken the bulk of it, returned\nit all to us and the silver and the crystal and whatever it was, was uncovered and it all\ncame with us to the United States. So we were very lucky that we could retrieve a lot of\nthe things we had. After the war, it was really rough too, to pick up the pieces again and I\ndon\u2019t know if we should talk about that yet.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember. I do know he left well ahead of us and I don\u2019t remember, for\nexample, a very dramatic good-bye or a hugging, kissing. He -- He left. I\u2019m not sure if it\nwas on the same day or perhaps the day before. He too -- He left alone, that I know, on\nhis bicycle and I have a feeling that he went to this sort of in between house, where we\nalso were taken to. And then, I was not aware of contact with my father, but my mother\nsaid that the farmers were in touch and knew he was all right and he was well. And\ninterestingly, now that I have gone back to the farm quite a number of times, I realize he\nwas far closer to us than I thought at that time we were. As a matter of fact, I would say\nhe was in 10 minutes walking distance from us, which was not far. But, at that time, I\nthink -- I thought it was very, very far. It was -- Go ahead.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think it was really a knapsack -- it may have been a knapsack, it may\nhave been a suitcase. As a matter of fact, I think some of our personal things were taken\nto the farmers in advance of our going there, which must have included some clothing\nitems, because when we went on the bike, the evening that we were taken to the farm, I\ndon\u2019t remember that we had anything with us. So, clothing and some personal items were\ntaken along, but I don\u2019t remember that anything specific of mine went along with me.\nPerhaps a few books, I know my mother had a few books. But all during our hiding time,\nI really did not see any -- many personal belongings, other than probably some blankets\nthat we slept on, and pillows that were in our hiding place with us, but nothing more\npersonal came along. Come to think of it, I must have left all my books and toys, or\nwhatever it was, behind. And I must have also left it behind without looking back or\ngiving it further thoughts, because perhaps it wasn\u2019t meaningful enough or it was just,\nwell, we had to go and don\u2019t think more about it.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question to ask, because I\u2019ve been talking about that a lot. I had\ndreams after the war was over and for many, many years -- subsequent years, including\nafter I came to the United States and it was always the same dream, namely, I had two\nvery good friends. They lived within shouting distance, if you will, of where we lived.\nTheir name was Menist, M-e-n-i-s-t. There was a boy, he was the grandson of the local\nrabbi and his sister and my parents were very good friends with their parents. And we\nwere always playing. As a matter of fact, I would almost say they were amongst my best\nfriends, and they were deported. And after the war, I dreamt that I were -- I dreamt that\nthey had survived and they came back. And I would go to their house, where they lived,\nand there would be a woman and perhaps it was the mother who said, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t\nsee them today, but come back tomorrow.\u201d And then my dr-dream continued. I would go\nback and she would always say, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t see them now, but come back\ntomorrow.\u201d And that dream haunted me for years and years and years after the war. And,\nas I said before, even after I arrived in the United States. And that was about the only\ndream.",
        "A: Yes. They were both killed in Sobibor, too. Most of the Jews in the village where we\nwere, were taken to Sobibor and I know that for a fact, because of the research I\u2019ve done.\nAnd speaking of the Menist children, they too were a big part in my life, because th-the\ngrandfather was the local rabbi and he attempted to give us Hebrew lessons, instill some\nJewishness in us and we would meet every week, on Sunday, in his kitchen and he would\nteach us a little bit of history and little bit of the reading. But I was never very interested\nand besides, Eeshe, the boy -- there were two other boys, who were also friends of mine.\nAnd the rabbi was very critical of me because I wouldn\u2019t come to service every Saturday\nas he thought I should. I did go sometimes. I would sit in the women\u2019s section and\ninstead of reading a prayer book, I would read Tilonspiegel. And he would sometimes\ncome home from the synagogue and walk through the streets to go home and I would be\nout on the street playing and then on Sunday I would arrive at his house and he said, \u201cI\nsaw you playing with the Gentile children. I don\u2019t want to see that any more.\u201d And then\none day he said to me, \u201cYou are not coming to synagogue often enough and the reason,\nOma Pagrach 1s ill, is because you don\u2019t come to the synagogue enough.\u201d And I -- I\nguess I must have been about eight, nine, 10, I don\u2019t know, and it was, I got very angry at\nthat and I said, \u201cI\u2019m not staying here.\u201d I got up and I was ready to leave, and Eeshe, his\ngrandson said, \u201cWell, shall I keep her?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, let her go.\u201d And I ran out of\nthere and it was bitter cold, without a coat. And on my way home, I see a little girlfriend,\nI say, \u201cGo back there and fetch my coat.\u201d And I walked into the house and I said to my\nmother, \u201cI will not go back, because he blames me for Oma Pagrach being ill.\u2019 And my\nmother said, \u201cI agree with you.\u201d And that was the end of my Jewish education and so\ntherefore, I\u2019m totally uneducated and that was an incident I remembered quite well.\nSadly, of course, he too was deported and died in Sobibor.",
        "A: Again, I think that -- no, I think he -- he would not have contemplated leaving and I\nthink that he also would -- I don\u2019t know if he had any sort of philosophy, I want to stay\nwith my people or with my flock til the end. He was old, he was -- I think he was\nprimitive. But how do I know, I was so young. I think he just went, as many of the others\nwent. He met his fate and apparently, I was told afterwards, he must have been very upset\nwhen they were collected on the marketplace to be sent wherever it was. He was very\nagitated and angry. But just like all the others, he met his fate and that was that. There\nwas another women there whom we knew. Her name was Mrs. Schwab. She was also\nGerman and my father, toward the very end, mentioned that he could find her a place.\nAnd she was one who said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to go because they won\u2019t have kosher\nfood.\u201d I think I mentioned that in my tape. And she was, of course, killed, together with\nall the others. It was a nice town and I think the people were very nice, but I think they all\nknew -- many of them knew that things would not continue to go well for them and there\nwere always rumors and they were always speculating what is going to happen to us.",
        "A: Interestingly, my recollections of the coffin are fairly vague. I see it in front of me,\nhow we went into it and we were lying on those huge sacks of milled flour, I think 1t was\nand it had a very dr -- it was very dry and stuffy. It was as if you are constantly inhaling\ndust, but of course it didn\u2019t -- there was an odor to it, too. So, it was big enough that we\ncould stretch out in it and we were lying there. I don\u2019t think we could sit [indecipherable]\npositive. And they would -- they put us in there and we had a little receptacle in case we\nhad to use the toilet facilities. And must have been given some food. What I do remember\nquite well though, 1s at night, the daughter, or one of the daughters would come, open the\nlid and told us to go out, because this was in a -- in an attic-like place. Opened up the lid,\nwe would go out, stretch, walk and we were given food at that time and I guess maybe\nwe washed ourselves. It\u2019s -- It is truly very vague. And while we were lying in there, my\nmother and I would of course talk incessantly and she always tried to put a positive thing\non everything, this is only going to be a short time, they are going to find us another\nplace and told me stories, which she did the whole time anyhow. But also, during that\ntime, I wasn\u2019t well. And I think that was the -- probably already a forerunner of what was\nto come, because one evening, when the daughter took us out, I had chills and I was\nreally not feeling well. I had the sore throat already. So, mother was ma -- mother was\npositive and I was, I think, fairly weepy and well, we stayed there and I wish I\nremembered how long it was. I can\u2019t believe it was all too long and then we were\ntransferred to the other wonderful palace that I called it, that we occupied for the\nremainder of the time. And, with respect to my father, there was little contact and strange,\nI -- I wasn\u2019t homesick for my father. I think I was too busy trying to adjust to that life that\nI had to lead there with my mother, that I could not think too much about my father\u2019s\nabsence. It was [indecipherable |",
        "A: And it was only one occasion that that happened. It was during the time -- it must have\nbeen in \u201844, I think, when the allies had this aborted invasion of the Netherlands, near\nIronham, I think that\u2019s eventually, what the movie, \u201cOne Bridge Too Far,\u201d was based on\nand they were sent back and we had hoped that the end was in sight, and we were all so\neuphoric about it all. And then it all came to naught and then my mother was very down,\nI would almost say depressed, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever get out of here.\u201d And\nanother thing she said to Mutter Hartaming, \u201cI guess if you had known that it would last\nthis long, would you have taken -- you wouldn\u2019t have taken us.\u201d And she said, \u201cWe took\nyou, no matter how long it would be.\u201d But my mother is one of these people who you\ncan\u2019t keep down too long and she recovered from this tremendous disappointment and\nthe farmer said to, \u201cAn end will come and you have to continue to hope.\u201d So, we went\non.",
        "A: Yes and no. Of course, many of the stories have stayed with me and many of the\nsongs that she has taught me have stayed with me and I really savor them and enjoy it, is\nit important? Has it made a difference in my life? I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know what the\nanswer to that would be. My mother wo -- as I said, I was very connected to her as a\nyoung child, I was afraid to leave her and yet she was -- I mentioned that too, she was\nvery strict as -- very strict, a real disciplinarian of the old school. And she continued this\nafter the war, too and I think I rebelled a lot and became very -- 1n some ways, she was\nvery intim -- controlling and intimidating and I think I had a hard time working on that\nand working through all that. So, am I really answering? Yes, there are a lot of things that\nstayed with me and that I remember very well and remember with fondness. And the\nother side of it is that there are also a lot of things that I remember very well, with not\nthat much fondness, because I think her being so very controlling, has, 1n some ways, at\ntimes, hampered me in my development.",
        "A: I think, in my years here in America, alone, although -- because even while I was at\nMontessori, I still felt very controlled by her. I was controlled as a young child, 1.e. the\ncookie incident where, you know, you shouldn\u2019t always take -- accept cookies or\nwhatever. And in Montessori, 1t was a boarding school and I only went home on\noccasions, but even then, I was supposed to -- to do her bidding. And I think one of the\nreasons that I went to the United States when I did, and as I did, was probably to get --\nbecome a little bit more independent, because I think I realized that she was too -- too\ncontrolling. And my father was not at all, but she was and I think that continued through\nmy early and late adolescence and even my early adulthood.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct. You\u2019re right. Her -- Her -- Her strength and her dominance was what\ngot us through. I think if she hadn\u2019t been as strong as she was and if she hadn\u2019t been the\nno-nonsense type of person that she was, and if she hadn\u2019t been as resourceful, I think it\nmay have been very difficult. And I always have to think of her having to be there with a\n-- a young child between the ages of 12 and 14, and it was no easy task.",
        "A: No, it was not -- it was not at all a normal adolescence and interestingly, I can\u2019t even -\n- I can\u2019t even identify what -- what was right at that time or not. I mean, what kind of\nthinking I had. You know, girls of 12 and 14 have their interests and problems and so on.\nI don\u2019t even know what, if any, I had, other than there is tomorrow and the next day and\nthe next day and all those days really had very little to offer. Of course, in hiding, one of\nthe highlights was that I was being taught on occasion by the farmers. The daughter\u2019s\nfianc\u00e9, and that was really very, very wonderful.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, it was her resourcefulness, as well as the farmer\u2019s daughter, who suggested that\nshe bring in her fianc\u00e9. A-After all, he was trustworthy, his family was hiding people,\ntoo. So, yes, and mother encouraged that, of course and that was good. And also, after the\nwar was over, it was she who must have come up with the idea of my going to\nMontessori school, realizing that I could not stay in the little school in the village, which\nwould have been a disaster. And sent me to that Montessori school and I still have to find\nout how they were able to fund all that, cause it must have been frightfully expensive, it\nbeing a boarding school, slash, lyceum.",
        "A: Very -- The reason 1t would have been a disaster 1s, I should have been at the -- at 14,\nI should have been in the middle school, and had I stayed in the village -- and I was in\nschool there, I was in six or seventh grade, so I was in with the wrong age group and that\nwas not very comfortable. Also, I had difficulties. Remember, I had missed school for\nmany, many years and it was very hard to catch up. And I think the reason the Montessori\nschool came along as my -- again, the Pagrachs suggested my mother take me to the city\nof Arnam and have some testing done to see what I was capable of doing. And I do\nremember I was taken to Arnam, which at the time was considered to be the big city, and\nI was tested and when the report came back, it said that perhaps I should be sent to a\nschool where I could progress at my own speed and see what would happen to me and\nthen make a decision later on. And I think that\u2019s how the Montessori came about, which\nwas really a terrific decision, because again, the Montessori school was very good for me.\nI could indeed progress at my own speed. I may have progressed in the wrong areas,\nbecause I concentrated more on -- on learning languages and literature and history rather\nthan in math. But, it was a good environment, I was around young people my own age for\nthe first time ever. And it was a little bit of an adjustment to be suddenly thrown into this\n-- this type of an environment. It was a fairly exclusive school and very, very small. But,\nI made some friends and I was very happy there. I had a very nice time and we\u2019d go\nhome every few weeks for a weekend and in turn would be invited at some newly made\nfriends home for a weekend and it was a rather posh school. We learned dancing and\nsailing and hockey and tennis and it was all very nice. But, then, after two years at\nMontessori, I was 16 and had I stayed at Montessori, I would have ultimately have to\ntake what they call a state or a final exam, to matriculate, and I was very concerned about\nit, too, because I did not know if I was up to par. And the family in the United States kept\nagitating that I should come and spend a year there, just to forget about what had\nhappened or -- and I think the reason they did that too, because they were hoping that my\nparents, particularly my father would ultimately come and be reunited with his siblings.\nSo, I said yes. I guess, to me, it was an adventure to go across the big ocean to the United\nStates and to be independent and go on my -- be on my own, although I had to -- I was\ngoing to live with my father\u2019s family. So, the idea was for me to go for a year, go to\nschool in Baltimore and then come back. And, in the Montessori school, of course, the\nchildren all thought that was pretty neat [indecipherable] someone to go to United States,\nbecause United States was still Hollywood, big cars and all these wonderful --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: The Montessori school, there was one other Jewish girl there, her name was Marishka.\nI think she was Hungarian and I really don\u2019t know anything about her background. Either\nshe had been 1n hiding, too, or perhaps she came -- I don\u2019t think she survived a camp.\nAnd all the other children that were there were children of, I guess some of the Dutch,\neither aristocracy, as there were some -- a few girls, they were vaguely connected to the\nroyal family and a lot of children whose parents were still in Indonesia, and the parents\nbeing Indonesia, they sent the children to school. But it was all very democratic and\nreally very nice.",
        "A: I -- The school definitely, definitely did not give scholarships and it must have been a\nsacrifice, because I cannot imagine that 1t was very inexpensive. It was -- As I said, 1t was\na very small school, it was a very exclusive setting and the type of children that were sent\nthere, I think it must have been fairly expensive, and I really don\u2019t know where the\nmoney came from, if my father had indeed done that well again, or if someone lent them\nthe money, I don\u2019t know. But, I do think it was a wonderful thing that they did for me,\nhaving sent me to that school instead of suffering through another school.",
        "A: I remember one specific incidence, because this is interesting. I\u2019m sure I must have\ntalked about it, and I had one friend who -- well, who roomed with me. As a matter of\nfact, there were two girls. We sh -- There were three of us in one room. And one of\nwhom I became very friend -- good friends with, she w -- visited me in the United States.\nI think she immigrated here eventually, herself. And no feeling of anti-Semitism\nwhatsoever. I think the headmaster was Jewish, I\u2019m fairly sure. However, one of the\nroommates was a young woman who had come from Curacao and asked me home for a\nweekend and I accepted and I went home with her in a neighboring town and I remember\na remark she made, oh, her family really liked me, although in general, they were not too\nkeen on Jews. And that was fortunately the one and only remark that was made and I\ndon\u2019t even remember how I responded to it, or how I handled it. I do know I never did\ninvite her to my house, nor did I ever go with her again. But we stayed on very good\nterms.",
        "A: The experiences were very similar. As a matter of fact, I think, age-wise, we were\nfairly close. Interestingly, she came from Frankfort, which was not that far from\nSchlichtern. No, I really don\u2019t think so. I alway think, having of course read her diary\nseveral times, she was more -- a much more introspective, much more thinking person at\nthat age than I was, ergo her diary. When I wrote my so-called cookbook diary, which I\ninterspersed with little things, they were never very thoughtful or significant, other than\nwhat was going on with the war, what the family, meaning the farmers, were doing, and\nwhat my mother and I were doing, whereas I think Anne Frank led a more -- ma-maybe\nmore profound life, a more thinking life. I think she came from a very different\nenvironment than I did, too. So, do I have anything in common with her, other than that\nwe were hidden? No, I don\u2019t think so. I saw her hiding place this summer and of course,\ncompared to my hiding place, they were living in luxurious quarters. But, those luxurious\nquarters were not that good for them.",
        "A: I think I did remain a child much longer than I would have under normal\ncircumstance, or even if we are comparing or trying to see if there\u2019s any connection or --\nor whatever, with Anne Frank. I think I was more connected with my mother than Anne\nwas with her -- both her parents. And yes, I was kept a child and that may have helped\nme, too. I think I was not yet a real adolescent and Anne Frank was, even beyond that.\nAnd perhaps that is why I consider I came out of there un -- relatively unscathed, because\nI still came out as a child. I was a child at 14. I think I was still a child at 16 and perhaps\nthat was to the good.",
        "A: Yes, it -- perhaps it was to the good, I think.",
        "A: Physically, of course, when I -- while I -- when I was in hiding, I started menstruating\nand became aware that I was a woman, but even that was taken very much as -- it was a\nnon-event. It was -- matter of fact, 1t was a nuisance, because, given the circumstances we\nwere in, it was not very pleasant. But I never thought, \u201cAll right, now you -- you have\npassed a threshold and now you\u2019re entering womanhood.\u201d These things never occurred to\nme. I also did not have romantic fantasies, as -- again, as Anne Frank did. I think I\nbecame aware of boys when I went to boarding school, where I did -- well, had my little\nflirtations with the boys, because, by the way, I think I did mention, it was a -- the first\ncoed Montessori school, too. And, you know, we all had our little fantasies and so-called\nromances, but I was a child and my family in Baltimore, they confirmed that, too. They\nsaid when they picked me up and brought me to their home, they were very surprised\nhow -- what a young child I was at 16, because, after all, in the United States, even then,\nat 16, the girls and the boys are more -- more forward, more developed and of course, not\nas sheltered. I was a very, very sheltered child before the war and even somewhat after\nthe war.",
        "A: [indecipherable] Right. I was sheltered in more ways than one. I was emotionally\nsheltered and physically sheltered.",
        "A: Well, physical problems were just that I developed -- because of the rheumatic fever,\nthey think that was the cause of a -- a mitral valve, or heart murmur. But it did not hinder\nme in any way as a young woman, I participated in the swimming and the tennis and\neverything else. That only manifested itself in later years, maybe because this valve has\nseepage or leaking and as I got older, it became a little bit more debilitating, til finally, in\n1988, it got so debilitating that the decision was made to repair that valve. So, as I like to\nsay, in 1988, I had a valve job and in 1998, it is still holding up, so the warranty ran out\nand it\u2019s still going strong and I don\u2019t think I have, other than the brief period of time\nwhen it was somewhat incapacitating, with shortness of breath, things like a rapid\nheartbeat, it has not really kept me from doing all the things that I\u2019ve always enjoyed\ndoing, such as hiking, tennis and all the other fun activities.",
        "A: I came to Baltimore, as I said, supposedly for one year. How did I come to Baltimore?\nIn \u201847, it was still very difficult to move around, and my family managed to book passage\nfor me on the SS Ernie Pyle -- you know, Er-Ernie Pyle was a war correspondent and this\ntroop ship was named after him and then it was converted to transport people. But, I had\nto pick up that ship in Lahavre and my parents could not go. By the way, they never got\ntheir Dutch citizenship, they kept their ger -- well, we were stateless. I came on a stateless\npassport to the United States. But, again, a friend of the Pagrach\u2019s said he would\naccompany me as far as Paris. And then, in Paris, we connected with another young\nwoman who was also going to board that ship. So, my parents took me to the train in\nAmsterdam and we said good-bye and I think --",
        "A: That must have been difficult, but again, it\u2019s hazy and I don\u2019t remember a thing, other\nthan going to the train, getting on the train and it must have been a sleeper, I would think,\nand getting off in Paris, with this man who was a cousin of the family Pagrach, who\nincidentally, was a survivor from a camp. Had dreadful, dreadful stories to tell.\nWonderful person. And he came with me to Paris and then in Paris we met this woman,\nher name was Margot Faulk, I remember her name and I remember also the first evening\nwe were there, this man and this woman wanted to go to the -- the Moulin Rouge or one\nof these clubs and they didn\u2019t know what to do with me and decided to take me along.\nOh, it was called the Casino de Paris and for me that was big adventure.",
        "A: I was 16. Sweet 16. And I don\u2019t even remember the hotel we stayed in. I only do\nremember we went to this Casino de Paris and must have then, the next day, said good-\nbye to this man and went by train to Lahavre, where we boarded this, what looked to me,\nenormous ship. And there were thous -- I don\u2019t know how many people on this ship. And\nwe didn\u2019t have cabins, we were in sort of dormitories and there was a dormitory for men\nand a dormitory for women. A lot of farmers were going on that ship and I -- my guess 1s\nthe-they were a lot of Dutch and maybe Belgian and French, who could not make it any\nmore in Europe and went either to the United States or to Canada, which actually, several\nof our -- of our farm families children did, they moved to Toronto and neighboring areas.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm. So, we got on this ship, this woman, Mar-Margot and I and I was\nmighty glad to have her, because I would have been totally lost and I -- I was rather timid\nand not very happy at that point. Now, that I remember very well. It\u2019s interesting, I don\u2019t\nremember saying good-bye to my parents and don\u2019t remember details of the Paris stay,\nbut I do remember being overwhelmed by that big boat. And then we were assigned a\nbunkbed. I think they were triple bunks and I remember we had to eat in the cafeteria and\nthis Margot and I amused ourselves. We were sort of left to our own devices and it was a\n10 day journey. I was a little bit seasick and I think I was quite homesick already then,\ntoo. But she -- she was very wonderful. I think she ended up going to Canada, but I\u2019m not\ntoo sure.",
        "A: She spoke Dutch.",
        "A: Yes. And incidentally, yes -- so she spoke Dutch and most -- a lot of the people on the\nboat were Dutch, but we did not have too much contact with them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I -- I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. I only remember all these women\nin that huge dormitory and then in the morning, the men would come and say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s\ntime to get up.\u201d And again, most of the journey was fairly vague. Obviously, it was quite\nuneventful, but this Margot and I became good friends and remained in touch with one\nanother for a couple of years afterwards. So, the 10 days -- after the 10 days passed, we\napproached New York harbor and I knew my father\u2019s oldest brother and his wife would\nmeet us.",
        "A: Now --",
        "A: Yeah, I saw it.",
        "A: Well, I was quite impressed and overwhelmed and I saw the skyscrapers and I found it\nall to be very, very interesting, but of course, I was also very frightened and intimidated\nby it all. So, we were standing on the top deck and I recognized my father\u2019s brother,\nbecause he looked exactly like him. Of course, I had seen photographs and incidentally,\nthe family, after they heard that we survived the war, they sprang into action and send us\nlots of care packages, together with clothes, together with food. And my uncle\u2019s son was\nin the American army and visited us there, and I think I may have mentioned that. That\nwas quite wonderful. So --",
        "A: For the duration of the war. Oh, no --",
        "A: My -- My parents managed to get word to them through the Red Cross in -- in sort of\ncode language that -- letting them know that we -- we were all right, that we were not\ndeported. They did --",
        "A: Yeah, well, they didn\u2019t know that, but they knew we did not -- we were not sent away\nto concentration camps. And after the war was over, the son who was in the American\narmy found us and that was a beautiful -- that was one of these memorable incidents,\nwhich I think I spoke about.",
        "A: That was so lovely, because we were staying in makeshift quarters. I think we had two\nrooms on the farm. And my father was taking a walk on a Sunday morning, or whatever\nand, you know, we were surrounded by a lot of the Canadians who had liberated us, so --\nand they were very nice and they would always bring us food and -- and good things to\neat. So, my father was taking this walk and he sees a soldier, thinking 1t was another\nCanadian. The soldier looked at him and smiled, my father smiled, and must have made a\nlittle chit chat with him and suddenly the soldier said, \u201cWell, Uncle Max, don\u2019t you\nrecognize me?\u201d And my father looked at him and recognized him because he had a little\nscar here where a chicken had once attacked him.",
        "A: Yes, and it was his nephew Martin and he took him home with him and I remember I\nwas so embarrassed because I was still wearing my -- my slip, and I ran away. And he\nsays -- he spent the day with us and told us about the family and he was also saying, you\nshould -- I should come to the United States. And it was really a wonderful get together\nand I think he came back once or twice more, when he was on leave, so that was a big --\nwonderful, big thing and we connected again. Anyhow, when I arrived in New York and\nI saw them standing there, there were also some others, and then | realized they were my\nmother\u2019s cousin. And of course, because of our being together so much, I had a very\ngood knowledge of who was what and what they looked like, practically down to their\nsize and shape.",
        "A: Right, exactly, and they too, were standing there and they were all frantically waving\nand then I got off the boat and after I went through the immigration. And Margot was --\nmust have been met by someone, too, and then I met them and it was very emotional. My\nuncle was crying and my aunt was crying and then it was my mother\u2019s cousin and her\nhusband and an aunt who were also there. And we first went to someone\u2019s house, it was\nmy aunt\u2019s sister, where we were probably given a meal. And then we drove to Baltimore\nfrom New York in my -- what I thought, my uncle\u2019s enormous, big car and I was really\nawed by all the cars, by all the buildings. It was just vast, 1t was very impressive as well\nas intimidating. But what was more intimidating -- when we got to Baltimore, we didn\u2019t\nimmediately go to my uncle\u2019s home, we went to my aunt, that was my father\u2019s older\nsister, with whom I was supposed to stay. And we get into the house -- she was a\nremarkable lady, my Aunt Eva, and -- by the way, they all spoke German, of course, and\nEnglish, but my German was almost nonexistent, because I remembered a little bit from\nmy grandmother, who spoke German, but I always spoke Dutch. So my German was not\nvery good, but I managed. And my English was fairly poor, too. So I get -- I arrive in my\naunt\u2019s house and the house was full of people -- well, they wanted to all be there and give\nme a big welcome and there were -- there was another aunt and her husband and lots of\ncousins and cousins children. It was really overwhelming and I was very, very\nintimidated and frightened and then my cousin, who was my aunt\u2019s daughter still living\nwith her, could see that I was close to tears, and she said to me, \u201cCome with me to the\nkitchen. I -- There is some mail here for you from -- I think from friends in Holland.\u201d\nAnd I remember she took me to the kitchen and she gave me a banana. And I looked at\nthat mail -- I think I\u2019m getting very sentimental about it, and there were letters from all\nmy friends from school, you know, oh, you must be in United States now and how\nwonderful and how anxious they are to hear from me. But it was very smart of my cousin\nto have done that, to have removed me from all these people that were sort of standing\nover me and wanting to know everything. So, she must have gone back into the living\nroom and told them to disperse. And th-they did. And then, eventually, it was just my\ncousin, her name was Erma and my aunt and I, who were left. And well, I -- they said I\nhave to share the bedroom with my aunt and my cousin, cause my aunt was a widow. She\ncame to the United States with her two daughters, she was widowed. And she had a fairly\nbig house, but she rented rooms. So the three of us all slept in the same room. And my\ncousin was getting ready to get married shortly after I arrived, so it was just my aunt and\nI that were left behind, but she was a very forceful woman. Now, I arrived in July and she\nsaid, \u201cWell, in September, you\u2019re going to go to the high school here and I will arrange\nit.\u201d And in the meantime, the summer was there and we visited another aunt whose\ndaughter had lived -- lived in Cumberland. So, the family really took a tremendous\ninterest in me and -- and tried very hard to --",
        "A: Be kind, yes. Most of them did. They were very wonderful.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s correct, if that really kept me going. I think the -- probably, yes,\nit could be that kept me going and thinking also, well, I only have to stay a year, I will be\nable to go home again. That\u2019s -- I think was the key to it, too. In the meantime, my aunt\nhad decided to really bring Susie into American life and started to teach me the right\nthings to say in English, thank you, you\u2019re welcome and so forth and so on and you have\nto be more assertive and you shouldn\u2019t be so shy and we have to make friends. And she\nwas -- I think she probably was at -- with me and for me at the right time. And after the\nsummer was over, she enrolled me in the local high school and this is what I think is\ninteresting, because I was 16 and I -- she managed to place me in the 11th grade, which I\ncould never have been in, had I stayed in Holland. So I realized, well, that was good,\nbecause that would mean I would graduate at age 18, as all normal children would. Had I\nstayed in Holland, I would have probably been 20 or 21 before I would have gotten that\ndiploma. And she took me to the school, I remember very well and she took me to the\ncounselor and she said, \u201cShe is supposed to get the easiest classes, because her English 1s\nvery poor.\u201d And the counselor was very understanding and said, \u201cThere are lots of,\u201d --\nnots lots of, \u201cthere are a number of other immigrant children and don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll take\ncare of her.\u201d And -- And she had a young girl go with me to school, because after -- I\ndidn\u2019t know my way and she was also the daughter of immigrants and they all -- the --\nthe -- the German Jewish immigrants, they stuck very much together. So, this young\nwoman, Ellen, took me to school. And when I came on the first day, the counselor said,\n\u201cYou know, there is a young girl here who speaks Dutch.\u201d Well, I thought I\u2019d died and\nlanded in heaven. And he introduced me to the girl who was really from Germany, from\nBerlin, but she had spent the war years with her family in Bangkok and was sent to a\nDutch school there. And in -- her name was Marion. And, incidentally, Marion was my\nfirst friend and she still is my very dearest friend. She still lives in Baltimore and we see\neach other, oh, at least once or twice a month. And she and I became inseparable and that\nwas very, very good for both of us, because she was shy and I was shy and we did not fit\nin too well. When -- Neither were we too comfortable with our American peer group. We\ndid meet also, some other young immigrant girls and became friends with them. And\nslowly, we developed a -- a nice group. As a matter of fact, we even had a little social\ngroup, boy - girl, which would meet every weekend and we\u2019d dance and have a good\ntime. And my Aunt Eva was always prodding, \u201cNow you have to do this and you have to\ndo that and you have to become more social.\u201d I was still homesick, but I think it star --\noh, and a big event was, after I was perhaps a month or two, they said, we will call your\nparents and you know, making a transoceanic call at that time was a big event and I\ncalled and talked to my mother and father and of course it was bittersweet, because after I\nhung up I felt worse, I think, than I did before. But, I thought that was too very\nwonderful. In any case, life at Aunt Eva\u2019s was very, very good because she took such a\ntremendous interest in me and tried to get me socially -- emotionally, socially and\nintellectually up to snuff. No -- No small task. And --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Well, life at Aunt Eva\u2019s was quite good and I think I benefited from it very, very\nmuch. I remember when I got my first report card and I got a near failing grade in\nFrench, she marched herself to school and said to the French teacher, \u201cThat won\u2019t do, she\nis not going to accept that.\u201d And transferred me out of the French class, into a German\nclass, which was very smart, because of course I did very well there and it helped my --\nmy German. So -- But I could not stay at Aunt Eva, because her married daughter had to\nmove back in, because they were going to remodel a house, and then I was shipped off to\nmy Uncle Meyer, who was my father\u2019s oldest brother. That was the father of my cousin\nMartin. There, I was not that happy, because Uncle Meyer\u2019s wife, whereas I\u2019m sure she\nwas happy to take me, was not used to having a young girl around and was accepting of\nhaving me there, but did not like -- did -- was not as encouraging as Aunt Eva, ergo, she\ndid not like it when I would invite people over and --",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Everything was in Baltimore.",
        "A: But my friendships stayed the same, but life at my Uncle Meyer and Aunt Ada\u2019s was\nnot quite as wonderful as life at Aunt Eva, although I continued to see Aunt Eva all the\ntime, but I had to stay there, because -- so, after the year was over, my mother came, with\nthe idea to take me back. And at that point, I was quite well settled, very happy, oh, and I\nhad gotten babysitting job, so I learned how wonderful it is to make money, 50 cents an\nhour babysitting. Every Saturday I would babysit and that was a pretty good feeling.\nHowever, Uncle Meyer made me turn most of the money over. Later on -- And I resented\nit, he only allowed me to keep a small amount -- and much later on, I learned that he had\nput that money in an account for me, but he didn\u2019t say that. So, the year was over, my\nmother came with the idea of taking me back and at that point, I think -- there were two\nreasons, I -- I felt very comfortable. I liked school, I liked my life and my Uncle Meyer\nand Aunt Eva and Aunt Hunny, they all said, \u201cWe think your parents should come here\nand it would be much better,\u201d and they were -- they were very close, th-the siblings.",
        "A: Of course. So, my mother came, and I let it be known I was not going back.",
        "A: Well, I was very happy that she came, but there were -- there were some things in --\nyou know, she -- the first thing she saw, I had very bad acne and said, \u201cWell, why isn\u2019t\nanything being done about that?\u201d She was a little bit critical. But I was happy to see her,\nbut I think I was very ambivalent. Well, here she is and she wants to take me back, and\nhere she 1s and the first thing, she was saying, \u201cWell, you need to do something about this\nand that.\u201d It was a mix -- mixed thing, and I think I let it be known very early on that I\nwanted to stay and -- and she must have been agreeable to it. So, she stayed, I believe, for\nthree or four months and went back without me and I continued doing what I did, living\nwith Uncle Meyer and Aunt Ada, babysitting. As a matter of fact, I think I even got an\noffice job at that time, because I took a commercial course in the high school, knowing\nfull well that I could not qualify for higher level courses, not having had any preparation\nwhatsoever. So, in \u201849, my father came and that was also the time I was due to graduate\nfrom high school, so he was there for my graduation, which was very important to me.\nAnd I was so happy to see him. And --",
        "A: Oh, he was, yes, he was moved, A, to see me and me doing as well as I was and in\nparticular to seeing his -- his siblings, again. He hadn\u2019t seen them since the mid - 30\u2019s.\nAnd they enveloped him, they just didn\u2019t want to let him go, and he didn\u2019t go, he stayed,\nand must have said to my mother that he was not going to come back and that she should\nclose up, finish up, whatever, and come, which she then did, in 1950, but -- so, he stayed\nfor one year with my uncle, also. And that was wonderful and he and I actually became\nvery close, because, remember I said I was very, very close to my mother, very attached\nto her, but at -- that year was very good for my father and me and we really bonded and I\nthink it was very wonderful. So, I graduated in \u201849 and I went to work. And,\ninterestingly, I went to work for a physician, who was there for -- he came from Detroit\nand he was working on the book of diseases of the -- I don\u2019t know what it was, lung\ndisease or stomach disease and I was doing some work for him at Hopkins. And he and\nhis wife were awfully nice. They didn\u2019t have children and they sort of adopted me. They\nwere very interested and very helpful and he said, \u201cYou know what, I think you need to\ngo to university.\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can make it, because I don\u2019t have the c-\ncredentials.\u201d And he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll help you.\u201d And I said, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have the money.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cWe\u2019 ll fund you, and I want you to discuss it with your family.\u201d But the\nfamily felt I should not accept it, it was too much of a responsibility and a burden, which,\nin retrospect was a bad mistake. And I stayed with that man, I think, for a year or so, and",
        "A: I think really that\u2019s what it was, I --",
        "A: Yes, yes, he was. I think that\u2019s what it was, or --",
        "A: It was. I think that was one of the biggest mistakes that could have been made. My\nunc -- My family, I think they were not academically oriented and I think that\u2019s sad. And\nmy father was not strong enough, I think, either, to make a case for it. My uncle was\nvery, very strong and he felt it\u2019s better if I continue to help support, go to work, and if I\nwanted to take night courses, which I did for awhile, I could, but he was -- there was no\nencouragement, and --",
        "A: Not necessarily. I don\u2019t think -- I think it was not a sexist thing, no, I don\u2019t think so.\nSo, when I declined, the doctor was very disappointed, but he said he understood and that\nwas that and I was crushed. I think, if I had been stronger or more willful, I could have\nprobably made a case for putting myself through school, but -- I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t,\nbut I didn\u2019t. And then, in 1950, my mother came and she went to work. She had never\nworked in her life and she went to work 1n a slipcover factory, where she did piecework.\nAnd she immediately said, well the harder she worked and the longer she worked, the\nmore money she had and she worked very hard. And my father worked 1n -- well, it was\nan installment business, clothing and things like that, not very challenging. And we lived\nin an apartment in Baltimore, on our own. So, all three of us worked, my father, my\nmother and I. I worked in an office, for a small Jewish department store. And then -- And\nmy mother was very unhappy the first few years she was here, she was utterly miserable\nand very homesick for Holland and threatened to go back, but my father did -- also did\nnot want to go back. I didn\u2019t want to go back, so she stayed.",
        "A: Yes, exactly. She stayed and as time went on, I -- I continued to take a lot of courses,\neither at the business school, or at Hopkins, where I went at night and took English and\nliterature and history. I don\u2019t know why I never signed up for a credit or a degree. I\ndidn\u2019t. But I was --",
        "A: Nobody to push me --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s really -- if I -- I -- and it used to bother me in my younger -- not at that\ntime, but much later years, that I felt deprived from the point of view of intellectual\nchallenges and education, as I thought education should have been. So I did very -- a lot\nto educate myself and I think I did quite adequately. But what I really would have liked, I\ndid not get and I think part of it is I wasn\u2019t encouraged and the other part of it is, I\nprobably wasn\u2019t motivated enough, either. So, there\u2019s -- you can\u2019t put a blame on\nanything, or anybody. And -- But I worked hard and then I got a job at Johns Hopkins,\nalso in a secretarial area and I was promoted and became supervisor of their outpatient\nclinic, and that was very nice work and very challenging and interesting. And I developed\nquite a few friendships, that was very nice. And met a young man who was not Jewish\nand thought that he was the right one, became engaged to him and then shortly -- much\nlater found out that he, too, was a little anti-Semitic and broke off the engagement. And --",
        "A: Yeah, right. He -- I met him and at first it didn\u2019t matter and then, I think when he\nsensed I was losing interest in him, because I realized he was not the right person for me,\nhe -- he -- I broke off and he -- I broke off, as a matter of fact, it was very traumatic. I\ncared for him and I guess I really -- he had a vile temper and that worried me and I think\nhe drank too much and that worried me and when I broke off with him, I was very\nunhappy. And --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And -- Right. And I went to Canada and we had very good friends in Montreal and I\nstayed with them for a little while and then got a job and worked in a children\u2019s hospital\nthere and I was there, on my own, for a year and it was a pretty good year. It was\nbittersweet, because it was difficult. I was still mourning the break off, but I realized too,\nI did the right thing. And I stayed for a year and then I came back to Baltimore and I saw\n-- | -- he was still around, and I saw him. He was almost -- You could almost call it\nstalking me, he would sometimes show up after work and I didn\u2019t like it and eventually, I\nthink he just left. And -- All right, then I had that very nice job at Hopkins, which was\nvery, very good. And then, one fine day, I get a telephone call -- oh, and of course, I\ncontinued to live with my parents. I guess that\u2019s what one did in those days. I continued\nto live with them and my mother was her usual, controlling self. I -- Where a -- Where\nare you going, when are you going, when are you coming back and so forth and so on.\nShe was not very happy about that young man, neither was my father, so -- oh, and the\nanti-Semitism surfaced when I broke off with him, the second time when I saw him\nagain. And then he -- I was out with him one night -- one evening and he was very down\non my father because my father had said to him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t -- don\u2019t trouble us any\nmore, don\u2019t bother us.\u201d\u2019 And then she said, \u201cWell, the world would had lo -- have lost\nnothing if your father had died in a concentration camp.\u201d So I got out of his car and I\nremember exactly where it was, it was late and that was it.",
        "A: And then one fine day, my telephone rang and this man\u2019s voice identified himself as\nMax Schwarz and I s -- he said he\u2019s Dutch and I said, \u201cWonderful.\u201d He said, \u201cI got your\nname from my sister.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, who\u2019s your sister?\u201d\u2019 And he said, \u201cShelly\nFried.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cNever heard of her. Where does she live?\u201d \u201cIn Israel.\u201d I said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\nknow.\u201d But, well, could he come anyhow and take me out and I said yes. And after I\nhung up, I said to my mother, \u201cImagine this man.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cI know what this 1s\nabout.\u201d She had been in Israel to visit her sister and her niece said, \u201cI have a girlfriend\nwho has two brothers in the United States,\u201d one of whom was what is now my husband.\nSo, we went out and that was in 1955 and in 1956, we married. So, it was a very quick\ncourtship, I guess. And --",
        "A: Oh, I think it was, yes. It -- It felt right. And it was interesting, because I always laugh\nabout it. When I left boarding school, I said to the, \u201cOh,\u201d they said, \u201cOh, you are going to\nmarry an American,\u201d and this and this. I said, \u201cNo, you just wait, I will marry a\nDutchman.\u201d And Max of -- and I, of course, come from totally different backgrounds.\nHis family -- His father was born in Saint Petersburg and his mother in Maylo, which 1s\non the German border. And his father came from Saint Petersburg to Amsterdam, he was\nin the diamond business and --",
        "A: No. No, no, no. My husband was born in Holland.",
        "A: His father came to Holland as a young man, from --",
        "A: -- and got married --",
        "A: -- in Holland -- from Russia --",
        "A: -- got married in Holland, and --",
        "A: Right, exactly.",
        "A: And he had two brothers and two sisters, my bro -- my -- my husband.",
        "A: And he lived in Amsterdam and they were a very, very religious -- his father was the\nfounder of the Russian shul -- Russian synagogue in Amsterdam and very, very\nOrthodox. Th-The boys had Talmud lessons after school and the mother was very\nintellectual, writes -- wrote poetry and the sister, one studied languages, one studied and\nbecame a very good pianist. So it -- it\u2019s a very different environment, background. His\nparents were deported, my husband\u2019s parents. They were sent to Sobibor, and the ch --",
        "A: I guess in \u201843. *42, \u201843 was the -- when all the masses left and -- but in \u00b042, they had\nsent the children to Switzerland, they went through the underground and ended up in\nSwitzerland and Geneva and the two girls, they were able to pursue whatever it is they\nwanted to pursue. I think my sister-in-law -- one of them went to study music and the\nother one, don\u2019t know exactly what she did and my husband was sent to a work camp, I\nthink for the first year or two and then went to the University of Geneva, where he got his\nPh.D. in chemistry. And then, ultimately, he came to Florida State University on a post-\ndoctoral. One sister immigrated to Israel, met her future husband on the boat and the\nother sister and brother both came to New York. And the brother now is in Dallas and he\nis also in the diamond business. The older sister still lives in Israel with her husband and\nthe younger sister lives in Colorado with her husband. And so, we met and we married\nand married in 1956 and moved to Washington, DC, because my husband was working\nfor the government. And we lived in -- almost at the edge of Georgetown for the first\nyear and then in 1957, our daughter was born and before she was born, we moved to\nMontgomery County. And I had worked a little bit before our daughter was born, then\nafter she was born, I did not work, and stayed home. Did a little free lance work here and\nthere. Took some courses here and there and then, in 1960, our son was born and in --\nthen I went with him to -- and this is interesting, I went with -- I enrolled him in a\ncooperative nursery school and met very nice women, very nice people. And I was\nalways very much aware of my lack of education, because there were all these American\nwomen, with all their degrees and this, that and the other and what did I have a degree in",
        "A: Oh, and what did I have a degree in? Surviving. And I always had to think of my\ngrandmother, whom I once asked, \u201cWhat kind of schooling did you have, Oma?\u201d And\nshe said, in German, \u201cHibin in deshula deslabins gevasin.\u201d And -- In the school -- I have\nvisited the school of life. So, I kept telling myself, \u201cWell, you went to the school of life,\u201d\nbut it was not really -- not very satisfactory. In that nursery school, though, I met and\nbefriended a young woman who was doing freelance proofreading, and she asked me\nwould I be interested in doing some -- helping her with it. And of course I thought that\nwas wonderful, always having been very good in English and in spelling. And this\nwoman was the one and only one, too, who did not have a college education, so I guess\nthat\u2019s the connection. And she found -- she was a -- a single mom and she found all these\nwonderful jobs doing -- editing proofreading. And we formed a team and I did it with\nher. And then one day, we were doing a fairly big job for a company and she said, \u201cYou\nknow, I\u2019m not going to do this any more. I got a job teaching English at Sandy Springs\nFriends School. Why don\u2019t you take it over?\u201d And I took it over and went to deliver the\nwork and this was a start-up company in Bethesda, called Congressional Information\nService. And I took the work back and I said, \u201cI have taken over her job, and -- but I can\ndo a good job for you.\u201d They kept me -- And they kept me and eventually, they offered\nme a job on a part-time basis, doing what they called accuracy, or accuracy editing,\nwhich I did and enjoyed thoroughly, about 20 hours a week and then little by little, it\ncrept up and it crept up and it was 30 hours a week. In the meantime, of course, the\nchildren -- this is after some time. I started this in 19 six, well \u201865, so I was associated\nwith that company since \u201869, something like that. And it -- our children were well\nensconced in school, there were the two, Tanya and David and I worked for them. And\nthen I was made an assistant Managing Editor, and then I was made the coordinator for\nthe editorial departments. And then in 1970, they offered me the job of Human Resources\nDirector, which I took -- no, that\u2019s not true, that was in 1979, I became the Director of\nHuman Resources there and I ran it until my retirement in 1990. So, notwithstanding the\nfact that I did not have that famous, or --",
        "A: Which only I was bothered by. I realized that I could achieve and I did achieve\nwithout it and I think it was a tremendous boost for me and my self esteem. So, that --\nthat basically was my life, or is -- has been my life and then when I retire, in 1990, of\ncourse I have various and sundry connections here and there and one of which was I\nknew this young woman who was -- who worked for the Jewish Social Service agency.\nShe said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you come and do some workshops for us as a volunteer for our\nRussian refugees?\u201d Which I did, for about four years. I ran -- I taught the new immigrants\nhow to look for jobs, how to write resumes and how to do applications and things like\nthat. So, I did that for four years and various -- and then once in awhile, I did some\nfreelance work still, from my old companies. Matter of fact, I still did it a year ago. And\nraised the children and the children now -- some have children. The daughter, our\ndaughter --",

        "A: And my husband and I continue to live a very full life here, taking care of this place\nand doing quite a bit of traveling and being involved in many different activities, so to\nsum it up, it -- life has been very good to me.",
        "A: My mother is living in Baltimore. She will be 95, and we talk every day, we see each\nother once a week and we -- once in awhile we reminisce about what was. She 1s still\nvery much of sound mind. I think it\u2019s been a role reversal, I think now, at this point, I\u2019m\nmore controlling or more -- she\u2019s more dependent on me, and that\u2019s fine. She still drives\nher car and she\u2019s a very amazing and still very active lady.",
        "A: And my father died in 1967 and I think -- I think, I know he had lung cancer. He was\na very heavy smoker. And fortunately, 1t was a short illness, but that was very traumatic.",
        "A: And family, the cousin who was so wonderful to me when I first came and gave me\nmy mail with my banana, she still lives in Baltimore. She -- Her sister and we have\nalways remained very close. And so I have a lot of family. And family in Israel, too,\ncousins, and -- with whom we are very close, also. So it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s very nice.",
        "A: No. We are not synagogue goers and even though my husband came from this very\nreligious -- he said, when he was in Geneva, he was still very observant and then one day\nhe decided, well, it doesn\u2019t make sense, and he started to smoke on the Shabbat, no\nlonger wore a beraid and we never affiliated ourself -- we are very Jewish and very --\nwell, what? We just do not go to -- we don\u2019t belong to a synagogue, but our grandson --\nour son was never Bar Mitzvahed, our grandson was, this past -- this past April, and as a\npresent, we took him to Holland and we showed him where we both lived, where my\nhusband lived and where I lived and where I was in hiding and he met --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: I think I forgot something very important, namely that -- obviously, I went back to\nHolland, after I was here for a number of years, to wit -- we went in 1967. At that time,\nthe wife of the farmer where my father was, was still alive. And as we approached the\nhouse, she was sitting there and shelling beans and she looked up and recognized me.\nAnd she was very happy to see me. And that was very emotional, very. And she looked at\nme and she said, \u201cMy, my,\u201d in Dutch, of course, \u201cthose were terrible times, but we\u2019d do\nthe same thing all over again.\u201d I remember I dissolved in tears. And in \u201867, they still, on\nthe farm where we were in hiding, the hiding place was still intact, so I could show it to\nmy husband. But -- And then we continued to go every few years, to visit the farmers, the\n-- the surviving ones, the children and we always were in touch with them, we -- on\nbirthdays ... As I said, we -- we -- well, we write on birthdays and during the holidays,\nNew Year, Christmas, I call them and chat with them. And the Hartamings, that are the\npeople where we were, the only one that is still in Holland is daughter Lida, and her\nhusband Herman, who was my teacher and three brothers and a sister had immigrated to\nCanada, and incidentally, we are in touch with them, too. They visited us here, once and\nwe\u2019 ve been there a few times and we talked to them and we write to them and this past\nsummer, we visited them. And they are still very religious and, is also moving, because\nwhen we visit with the one son and we have a small repast, he will sit and say his prayers\nand always thank God th-that he still can see us. Anyhow, to go back to Holland, so we\ntook our grandson and showed him --",
        "A: He -- Now.",
        "A: When he was 13.",
        "A: Yes, uh-huh, 13. And we --",
        "A: Right. And he was quite -- well, impressed is not the word, he -- when I ask him what\nwas the highlight of your whole trip, because we did many wonderful things, we went\nboating, hiking, biking and he said, \u201cYou know, being in the village where you grew up\nand s -- meeting the people and seeing where you stayed.\u201d And fortunately, the farm on\nwhich my father had stayed, the room where my father had slept was still there, so our\ngrandson could see it. So, that was really quite a -- a nice experience. And I think he got a\nlot out of it, so that was good and incidentally, when he was in fourth grade, he asked me\nonce would I come to his school and speak to his class about what happened and I did,\nand --",
        "A: No, the -- our son in LA does -- is not married.",
        "A: It\u2019s the daughter who lives in Baltimore.",
        "A: It\u2019s Tanya\u2019s children.",
        "A: And I went to his school and I spoke to his classmates. They were very interested and\nof course, he was very proud to have his Oma come and -- and tell them about what life\nwas like, once upon a time. So, all this makes for very wonderful things and wonderful\nliving. And our farmers, in 1994, were honored by Yad Vashem, in the Netherlands, and\nthat was very beautiful too, because the Canadians all came for the occasion -- not all, but\nsome of them came for the occasion and Lida and Herman\u2019s children were there. And it\nwas a very beautiful ceremony and a very beautiful gathering, and --",
        "A: There were two other --",
        "A: Yes. Two other -- well, and the reason it was so small is it\u2019s late.",
        "A: And there, too, it is something -- it should have been done -- I should have done it\nmuch earlier than what I -- what I did and I was not even aware of how this could be\ndone, but I did it and I\u2019m so happy that we were able to do it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I did. As a matter of fact, when I was in Israel, I went to Yad Vashem and I\ncontacted the -- the proper people there to set it all in motion and it took a couple years.\nAnd I was very nervous that nothing should happen to any of them --",
        "A: -- before, and luckily, it didn\u2019t, and it was very, very beautiful, and --",
        "A: Yeah, it was a superb way of doing it. Whatever you do, it -- 1t can never -- you can\nnever thank them.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Yes, exactly, and I often say this, there is no way I can thank them. I did this and this\nis fine, because they will go down in history as having been amongst the righteous.",
        "A: And it will be wonderful for their children to be aware of -- they are -- who are aware\nof that, too, but as far as our role is concerned, there is nothing we can do to ever show\nthem our gratification. There -- You cannot humanly do that, because what they did was\nso extraordinary, putting their lives and their house and their children on the line for three\ntotal strangers.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: In a noble --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Noble way, exactly.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly. That\u2019s precisely correct. And was it religion or whatever it was, it\u2019s\njust -- and even now, whenever we go and see them, especially the daughter, there is\nsomething very beautiful about their presence. And they still like to talk about the times,\nbut never in a -- a sad way, well just reminiscing what -- what happened, but always with\nthe feeling, well, what happened -- what we did, it was right.",
        "A: I think so. Her-Herman became the principal of a school and I think -- and they have\nfive children and they in turn have children and I think they have a very good family life.\nOne son 1s -- had a brain tumor, and that\u2019s very sad. He\u2019s terribly handicapped, and he\nlives with them, but they seem to be quite positive and upbeat and the Canadians are a\nvery happy and wonderful people. And I learned something interesting there too, when\nwe were there just now, that the son\u2019s wife -- in other words, was Lida\u2019s sister-in-law,\ncame from a family -- the father was a minister and she told us that one brother was killed\nbecause he worked in the underground. One sister did nothing but transport Jewish\nchildren to and from hiding places .The mother was engaged in -- imprisoned in\nunderground work. The father, a minister, was sent to a work camp -- concentration camp\n-- was sent -- came home again. And it\u2019s so amazing when you hear how many people\ndid what they did, it\u2019s awesome.",
        "A: Very awesome.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right, exactly, because it was something she believed, and that -- and no matter how\nthreatening they were and intimidating they were, she was going to stand her ground.\nAnd I think they -- they were really -- and -- and when we visit, we talk about the\ncourage and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s awesome.",
        "A: So amazing.",
        "A: Yes -- justifying it.",
        "A: Yes, she justified it to herself and my mother said to her, \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t worry\nabout it, because swearing, we --\u201d",
        "A: \u201c-- falsely, that\u2019s -- God will forgive you.\u201d And I think she -- she sort of\nacknowledged that, but nonetheless she -- she had a very nice way to circumvent -- circ --\nyes, to sort of get around it.",
        "A: That, well, they were Jewesses, after all. She was pretty wonderful. They were all very\nwonderful and they still -- the ones that are still -- are wonderful, the ones that we see.",
        "A: In the -- As to the Dutch -- the area where I lived, eastern Holland, and a fairly\nisolated area I would call it, there were quite a number of people that did save -- that did\ntake in Jews. Some for mercenary reasons, because I had heard of cases where, money\ngone, you\u2019re gone now, too and that happened, but I don\u2019t know how many instances\nthere were. I did hear about it, but all in all, after the war, or not even after the war, in\nrecent years I learned that the Dutch percentage -- the Dutch people were not as helpful\nor as cooperative with respect to saving Jews, as some of the other countries did, but even\nsome eastern European countries had a higher rate, shall we call it, of having saved or\nmanaged to help Jews, than the Dutch did. And part of 1t may have been the government,\nbecause when the war broke out, the queen hotfooted it over to England and the Princess\nJulianna and her children went to Canada. And I think Prince Bernard served 1n the -- in\nthe English army or some -- in the Dutch division, I think, of the English army, I don\u2019t\nknow. But, articles have said, or books have said, that Queen He -- Wilhelmina could\nhave done more to help her Jewish compatriots than she did and apparently, according to\nliterature, she had sort of said, yes, it\u2019s too bad what\u2019s happening, but has not made a real\ntremendous effort to help. And perhaps that set the tone, I don\u2019t know, but the NSB in\nHolland, the Dutch Nazi party, was quite active and again, more people could have been\nhelped than were helped, as compared to the French, who had a higher record of having\nsaved people. Course, the Danes were amazing. Belgium and so forth. Holland came out\nvery low on the list and I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know why.",
        "A: [really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s interesting. He lived next door and across the street from us were other\npeople and they had a little girl who must have been my age. And shortly after the war\nbroke out, perhaps a year after it, all of a sudden, the child was no longer allowed to play\nwith me and then we learned that the father had joined the NSB. Now, Mr. Fisher, that\npoliceman next door to us -- he was born in Germany, interestingly -- he had told us, he\nsaid, \u201cWatch out for the neighbor across the street, he joined the party.\u201d He -- He was just\na totally unprejudiced man, as was a neighbor two doors further down, who was also a\nlow level official in the local government, who was also very pro-Jewish and also very\ninterested in us and incidentally, I think that he too knew -- yeah, he knew we were going\ninto hiding so he es -- he -- he was very helpful and very well aware of it. So there you\nhave two people who were helpful -- didn\u2019t put their life on the line, but at the same time,\ndid not hesitate to have commerce with us, which is -- which was very brave in later\ntimes, when we were no longer supposed to be associating with non-Jewish people and\nthey -- they did. Their daughter, incidentally, still lives in Holland and has remained a\ngood friend of mine. So, it -- I -- I don\u2019t know and I also don\u2019t know in general what the -\n- what the beliefs in -- of the people in the village were. I knew there were quite an few\nNSB, but others, who were sort of invisible and I don\u2019t know what -- what -- what their\nbeliefs were or what their support was for one or the other.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, I th -- Compatibility, it\u2019s interesting, because in a way, we came from opposite\nbackgrounds and opposite everything. What we had in common is, we were raised in the\nsame country, we spoke the same language and we were both Jewish. We had survived\nthe Holocaust, and that\u2019s another topic that I want to address brief -- albeit briefly. Yes,\nsurvive the Holocaust we did, but I never considered myself a survivor as I do consider\nthose people that were in the camps and my husband feels very much the same way. I\nwish there were another word for it, becau -- in a way, it\u2019s a misnomer. Perhaps it should\nbe called, you know, concentration camp survivor, versus a hidden person or -- there\nmust be another word for it, because I think what we went through was a snap, honestly,\ncompared to what people suffered in all the different camps. And my husband feels very\nstrongly about that, too. That people such as we, or some of the people that he has seen\non tape because of his volunteer work that he does in the oral history, are not really that\nmuch related to the -- should not really be pegged as survivors. They may have played a\nrole of sorts, but it\u2019s -- the people that survived the concentration camps should be in a\ncategory all to themselves, that\u2019s really, I think, an important thing to know -- to be aware\nof, because they are unique, I think. What I think is very sad, though, 1s, with all that has\nhappened, with the awareness, with the education, with the -- the Schindler\u2019s List,\netcetera, etcetera, man\u2019s inhumanity to man continues. So what has -- what has history\ntaught us? I don\u2019t know. This I find very disturbing and very shocking. I mean, if you\nthink about Kosovo, it\u2019s frightening. So, have we not learned anything? I guess not.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. But telling the story over and over, of course, is good and having\nthe museum is more than good. It\u2019s a wonderful, educational thing and I think the more\nmuseums are created, the better it is. And I think people are very keen on learning about\nit, so long term, I guess it will -- hopefully it will have some sort of positive effect on\npeople, but -- at least over here. I really don\u2019t know. It\u2019s an eye opener for many people. I\nsee people going in and out of the museum and if you look at their expressions they are\nquite shocked and astonished and it\u2019s very difficult for them and for the children it\u2019s very\ngood to learn about it. That\u2019s one of the reasons I felt -- when my grandson wanted me to\ngo to his school, why not? But I don\u2019t know how much of this education is being spread\nin other places, and in other countries, given the fact that so many atrocities are still\ntaking place.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. As they happen. And that\u2019s -- That makes it all the more shocking. So, I\ndon\u2019t know what the world will look like, 10 - 20 - 30 years from now, but I hope some\nof these killing fields will -- will be gone.",
        "A: I would think it\u2019s not a phase. I would hope it is not a phase and I would think that the\ninstitution and the message are what -- something that will endure, because there will\nalways be other generations with some curiosity about what was, just like there 1s still a\ncuriosity about the Civil War, or any of these events that have happened in history. I\nthink this will continue to be of the same interest as time goes on, I would hope. I think\nso, because as long as the textbooks and the -- the educators show that this was an\nimportant part of history, the likes of these museums will continue to be of interest to the\n-- to the public, I guess -- I hope.",
        "A: Too many. Too many things have happened since I came here, and the Kosovo and\nthe African wars and so forth and so on. Remember when, in Rwanda, when there were\nall these problems, I kept saying, \u201cWell, history 1s repeating itself, because the world 1s\nstanding by and nothing --\u201d and I felt so impotent, in -- in some ways I felt as if I should\npack up and go and do something, knowing fully well, what can I do there? And then I s -\n- chide myself or deride myself and say, \u201cWell, if -- that\u2019s not the right attitude to take,\neither. If you feel that strongly, you ought to go and do something. You are no better than\npeople were at that time.\u201d So, I get very enraged, and very frustrated. Obviously, other\nthan giving some financial help, I didn\u2019t do anything. And when I look on the television\nscreen and I see what\u2019s going on in Kosovo, I feel the same way. Well, why isn\u2019t our\ngovernment more active and why -- and yes, you can write letters to your congresspeople\nand we do, when we feel the need, but that\u2019s where our involvement then ends and in\nsome ways, it\u2019s not enough. I get this -- this -- this feeling of indignation, how dare\npeople be this way, still, after all that has happened? And I sometimes think we as a\nnation ought to get more involved in it, but it doesn\u2019t always happen that way.",
        "A: Yes, of course. As a matter of fact, that\u2019s why I said, the only voice I have is by\nexpressing it in writing, by writing to my representative or my senator. Unfortunately, my\nrepresentative 1s not of the right beliefs, but the senators in the state of Maryland are and\nthey just -- the only thing we can do 1s encourage them.\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Well, as I started to say, this is interesting, because when my husband and I first met,\nof course we talked about our backgrounds and what happened to him, what happened to\nme and in general, and very much aware of each of our histories. And then we married\nand we really never talked about it any more -- very little. Perhaps alluded to it here and\nthere. And then the children came, Tanya first, in \u201857 and David in 1960 and I think\nneither one of us ever really made it a point to -- to sit down and say, \u201cWell, you want to\nknow about what happened to us.\u201d We may have touched it, we may have talked about it\nhere and there, but not in depth. And I think, as we got older, as the -- as we were less\ninvolved in the children\u2019s lives, namely once they were out of college and out on their\nown, if you will, I think much later we started to think more about it and to discuss it\nmore. And even, you know, going more into details of what happened to us, particularly\nin my case, because my husband was always much more reluctant to talk about it\nbecause, you know, his parents, of course, had a very horrible ending. And, as we\nsometimes said, he never really had a chance to grieve for them and it was always a little\ndifficult for him to talk about it. And as time went on, it wasn\u2019t as if we were hiding\nanything. We answered and they knew I was in hiding and where I was in hiding and so\nforth and so on. But I think 1t became very much topic A after I -- after we got involved\nwith the Holocaust Museum and after I gave my testimony and after my t -- my tape. And\nI think then, we started to talk much more about what was than we did in the earlier\nyears. And I think part of it -- I really wasn\u2019t deliberate -- I think 1t was more we were\nvery much engaged in working, bringing up children and making a life and did not really\ndwell on what was. And I think, as we got older, we thought back, more about what\nhappened and it\u2019s a reminiscence, really. And again, as I said, the tape was sort of a -- a\nfinal presentation to them, as to the what and the whereabouts -- the wheres. Also, my\nsister-in-law in Israel just recently sent a little praysee on their trip from Holland to\nGeneva. She wrote it in Dutch and my husband 1s going to translate it, also, again, for all\nthe children to have. But all this interestingly, happened really in our later lives and not\nearly on and I think there\u2019s a good reason for it.",
        "A: I got in touch with them. As a matter of fact, my cardiologist, his -- what was to be his\ndaughter-in-law, worked at the museum and my cardiologist, I -- I had told him where --\nwhere I had been in the war and he told me to contact her or I contacted her, I don\u2019t\nremember, but that\u2019s how I made contact with them regarding the testimony.",
        "A: Interestingly, my husband -- we were invited to the opening of the museum and he did\nnot want to go. It was difficult for him emotionally and then I went and toured the\nmuseum and I thought it was very well done, but he did not go with me. I took my\nmother, as a matter of fact. And he told me he couldn\u2019t, it was too difficult and too\nemotional. And then one day, I was out of town and when I came back he said, \u201cI went to\nthe museum.\u201d And he was really very impressed and he had spoken to someone in the\nphoto lab -- I don\u2019t know how -- and coincidentally, she -- this lady in the photo lab --\ncan\u2019t think of her name right now, Genya -- Genya Marcon was her name, had -- her\nfamily name was the same as someone that my husband used to know in Amsterdam, and\ntalked to her and she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and volunteer?\u201d And that\u2019s how he became\nand he\u2019s been very involved and very, very much engaged and then drew me in, too. But\nit took a little while.",
        "A: Probably. I would think so. It\u2019s a -- Probably, yes, that is so.",
        "A: That\u2019s difficult to answer, because I have not really thought about that, so it w -- it\u2019s\ngoing to be a pretty superficial answer. There are many of them who have made\nsignificant contributions to United States and life in the United States, I think. As\nwitnessed by the people that are very actively involved there, Mr. Lerner, and --\nLehrman, I mean, Miles Lehrman and so forth and Benjamin Neeves. They have done\nwonderful things. And I\u2019m sure there are very many others. I want to add, though,\nsomething else. There 1s the hidden child -- it\u2019s -- what 1s it called? Fonde -- no, not. The\nhidden child -- can\u2019t think of the other word. It\u2019s a group of surviving children that were\nin hiding. I have been -- They were in touch with me, I know someone who\u2019s involved in\nit. and I don\u2019t very much believe in all these organized, you know, th-the children of\nsurvivors and the hidden children, how helpful that is or how meaningful all that is. I\nguess, to join together and to discuss what -- what happened, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very\nproductive.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, that was -- No, ac -- as a matter of fact, it was at my grandson\u2019s school and then I\nmet a lady who belongs to a church and she asked me would I speak to her church group\nand I did and as a matter of fact, the church group was so awfully nice, they send a\ndonation to the museum, which was lovely. Other than that, no, I haven\u2019t.\non the strength of Jewish faith.\u201d And that\u2019s something that Netanyahu had said in\nceremonies after a -- after the march to remember the Holocaust.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s hard to comment on. In other words, what he\u2019s saying 1s really it\u2019s the\nJewish faith and in a way the Jews bonding, sticking together, that helps us survive. I\nthink the state of Israel has been -- the creation of the state of Israel has been a very\nimportant milestone for the Jews and I think without the existence of the state of Israel, I\nthink we would be far more vulnerable than we are now. Desperate you mean, while in\nhiding?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, I think the most desperate or anguishing times was when I was fully aware how\nvery ill I was and it was frightening, because my hearing at that time was impaired. So\nthat was very, very -- and -- and the frustration of being indoors all the time was very,\nvery difficult, where I couldn\u2019t see the sunshine and had a real longing for the sunshine.\nAnd the happy time was that one and only time when they carried me out into the wheat\nfields and I did see the sun. Funny, no. There was not very much that was funny. The\nmice procreating above us, maybe it was funny. Oh no, no I can\u2019t say there was anything\nreally light, no. And anguishing, yes, to me there was always a certain fear,\nnotwithstanding my mothers constant optimism, are we going to get out of here and\nwhat\u2019s going to happen once we get out of there. No, I can\u2019t really address that too well.",
        "A: No, not -- not really. It\u2019s interesting, I can store it away. I really think very little about\nthe time and there is nothing that, as you sa - -ask, fabric smell or smell -- maybe if I\ndrive past a silo, I will suddenly say, \u201cHm, that smells familiar.\u201d But other than that, no.\nIt\u2019s a part of life that\u2019s finished. Not forgotten, but not with me every day, because there\u2019s\ntoo much every day that is with me and that I need to look forward to and want to look\nforward to, so no.\n"
