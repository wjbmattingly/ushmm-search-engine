ALAN ZIMM\nPage l\nAlan Zimm interview 2/10/95\nS: Why don't you tell me how you came to [Dachau]\nALAN ZIMM: I came to [Durovan-Bullchiwan] in January of 1945\nwhich was a very, very cold day. And snow was laying on the\nground much deeper than here. And, eh, we arrived at Atr -\nand we were actually on the train for almost 6 hours, from\n[Bulchwa] to [Dura]. And we arrived it was very early in\nthe morning, ah 5 o'clock. It was dark, still, and we had\nto get out of the train you know, and the Germans with the\ndogs, and with the bayonets. [Rauss, Rauss, Rauss]. And we\nlined up in groups from the whole train and we marched into\nthe camp. [Muracha] didn't know what was there. And there\nwas in the mountains earlier a whole barracks, were up in\nthe mountains. We had to walk up and to divide a thousand\ngroups to each block one group. I was assigned to a certain\nblock. We had to walk up steps, wooden steps, into the\nmountains and there was the barracks. We checked into the\nbarracks and they told us,\" You're going to sleep just a\ncouple hours and next you're going to be awakened and you're\ngoin' get some breakfast. The breakfast was unbelievable.\nJust a little bit of waterish soup with turnips, and they\ngave you a chunk of bread- black, it was black like black\ncoffee. It was so soft you could just throw it in the wall,\nit would stick. So that was the breakfast, the whole thing.",
        "And they marched you out, out of the barracks and we came\ninto a big place in the center of the camp called a\nAppelplatz. We lined up in groups and the head of the\n[Cest}, the Gestapo, came around with two officers and they\nchecked every - asked everybody what kind of - what's what\ncoming [brupastu]. What kind of profession or trade do you\nhave. So I'll told them I was a tailor. So they assigned\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. ALAN ZIMM\nPage 2",
        "me to the factory, and when we were there the two. days,\nuntil we got assigned to the factory, we didn't actually\nknow where the factory was. We were just a block away from\nit. It was so camouflaged that you didn't know it was a\nfactory there. And the entrance to the factory was covered\nwith a net of artificial trees and bushes and you,uhum, we\ndidn't know it was a factory. When we marched in _ we\nrealized what it was. The factory was a huge underground\nfactory, it was about two miles long, and they had 48\ntunnels, and each tunnel a different section, a different\npart of the racket was built. I was assigned to one of the\ntunnels, to a group of two hundred, and I was assigned to\nwork in that area. So I-I saw machines who I've never seen",
        "in my life, so the foreman and the engineer, a German\nCivilian, and the foreman was also from a prison there. He\nsaid,\"I'm goin' teach you how to operate this machine, what\nyou have to do, and em, you're going to learn quickly.\" I\nsaid, 'Well, I'm looking at the machine there was something\nvery unusual to me. So but uh it took me about six hours to\nget what I was Supposed to do. So I was supposed to make a\npart to the racket. So hold it and still remember it Jlike\ntoday --------- and dis to order to make that racket hard,\nyou went through a certain operation, about 12 different\noperations with the machine. The German called it drapping\nwhat you put part on the machine you do certain operations\nwith it and eh they told me you have to make it with on my\nshift. 20 of these. That's normal. We should not make\nanything which is defective. If it's defective, one they\nallow it but if make more than one, or three or four, then\nwe could be considered a sabotage. People would hang for\nthat. And then but them to hang you is no problem as if it\nwas 1-2-3 they hang you. So I learned how to make it and ah\nthe German foreman, the German engineer, civilian, he was a\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int.

        "telling me later on that he was from Czechoslovakia. But he\nwasn't in fact civilian, he lived outside the camp. And he\nsaid to me do your work and no worry everything will be ok.\nDo your work right and I will treat you well. So ah the\nsecond I heard this I was increasing my norm and I was\nafraid if I make some wrong I'm ah they hang you. So I made\ninstead of 20 I make 24, 25, and 26 and they foreman and\nthey engineer was very happy with me, so what he did is\nduring they give you bread additional bread in the factory\nso he signed me up to get a loaf a bread once ae week. A\nwhole loaf of bread. That was just like saving your life.\nBecause what we ate there was nothing couldn't even hardly\nwalk. So I ate the eh eh gave me this bread and told me to\nhide it so nobody would see it. And we had to hide it for\nour, in front our prisoners who couldn't eat. IT ate at\nnight time on when I was going to. sleep. And in the\nbarracks. But he was so happy with me he was a nice man.\nSometimes he would come in the morning early from before\nwhen I came to the machine he would hide the sandwich in the\nmachine for me, his own. From we brought from outside. And\nI was doing the worked in that factory actually for almost 4\nmonths. And eh by the time I arrived we were evacuated. I\nnever saw the daylight. Because we arrived into the factory\nin was night, dark when we left it was dark. And inside was\ndark, I mean it was light but no daylight. And eh eh the\nthe Germans had the the prisoners stay eh eh eh that camp\nwhere we were with 25,000 prisoners. And among those\nprisoners were 10,000 Russian prisoners, war prisoners. In",
        "eh uniform soldiers were there also. And what happen is the\none time it was in February I think, I was there almost 2\nmonths. 2 escaped escaped the camp 2, 2, people, we don't\nknow who. So made us stay outside in winter when it was\nfreezing cold, snow up to here. We stayed outside for\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. ALAN ZIMM\nPage 4\nalmost 24 hours we didn't get into the barracks, we didn't\ngo to work either. Because they were looking for those two\nescapees in every barracks they looked everywhere. Under\nthe floors, everywhere and they haven't found them. SO\nfinally they made us go back to the barracks and we what\nthey did took 10 prisoners from the group, Russians and\nhanged them in the camp. For the ones who escaped they took\n10 of them and hanged them. And they had a band there,\nmusic from prisoners the band was playing while they hanged\nthe people. And we then we start keep on going back to the\nfactory working. I worked there and worked and one time it\nwas March, at the beginning of March '45. Somebody in one\nof the tunnels in one of the sections somebody sabotaged a\npart of a machine, broke apart of the machine, without that\npart they could not produce the rackets. And they I heard",
        "the engineers talking between them selves in German.\nWhoever did this, must have known, must be educated person\nto know what he is breaking, what he's doing. Without\u2019 the\nthat part they couldn't finish the racket. And what they\ndid was they took the whole group from that section and\nhanged them. All of them. In the middle of the tunnel.\nPut scaffolds all around. An an almost 200 hundred people\nwhere hanged in pairs. And we had to march the group they\nmarched every group they let them hang there for about a\nwhole shift and every group from every tunnel section had to\ngo march thru so you hanged from the hanging prisoners would\ntouch your head and made you look watch you that you look up\nand see what we do with people who do_- sabotage. That's\ngonna happen to you if you do the same thing. I was so\nscarred after that I couldn't sleep all night. I'm that\nreally shook me so much that I say well we never going get\nout of here alive regardless what we do. We didn't believe\nanybody's gonna be alive for getting out from this place.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int.

        "steps were dead corps laying 5 of them, people starving\nfrom starvation. Because we were the good ones actually,\nthere were people going to the quarries from there working\nin the rocks, quarries, drilling more tunnels in the factory\nand enlarging the factory. Those people didn't survive,\nvery few of them. Every day dead people coming back.\nBecause there were bound to kill them the ------ kill them\nand all the prisoners had to bring the dead bodies and lay\nthem down in front of the barracks where they belonged to\nand the following morning people clean em up and take them\nto the crematorium. Permanently. Right there was a\ncrematorium also. In that camp. It was working day and\nnight that crematorium. SO we we were was ae terrible\nterrible time to was eh the the condition was just brutal in\nthat camp. And an well I was we continue working in _ the\nfactory. Till the end of March the end of March we notice\nsomething unusual. The time to evacuate the whole camp,\nbecause end of March, was the end of March 29 I would\nremember correctly. American planes about 500 of them\nshowed up at one time. And in not far from the factory was\na small town called Mauthausen. And they came instead of\nbombing the factory actually, they I don't know if they\nrealize there was a factory or not, but there was train\ntracks going into the factory from outside and leaving the\ntunnel also train tracks what the Germans did, they loaded\nthe racket up on the trains on the trains coming into\u2019 the\ntunnel and covered them with straw, boxes of straw with\nempty boxes to camouflage them and leave in the tunnel. And",
        "nobody knew what was on the train. Even the people leaving\nMauthausen didn't know. And they were loading the rackets\nup to North to ship eh to use against ------. So at one\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. ALAN ZIMM\nPage 6\ntime they unloaded all the bombs on Mauthasuen.\nSandy. . . ?\nALAN ZIMM:\nWell, after after the bombing of Nauthausen, the Germans start\nCO\nevacuate the factory. The first they evacuated the RuSSians,\nall\nof them by train. Constantly trains were moving in and taking\nout the prisoners. That was the beginning of April. April lst\nand 2nd of '45. And ah what my foreman did he left me a stor?\nlast group to leave the camp. So everybody evacuating and I was\nleft with 2000 other prisoners. And what they did was they gave\nus a loaf bread and can of meat because we were the last group\nCO\nleave. And my our um eh? which we were supposed to do there\nwas cut all the cables from all the machines and burn all the",
        "blueprints. That what we were doing in the factory. And we did\nit took us one day to do all that and then they evacuated us,\nalso on the train. While we were on the train we did know where\nwe were going actually, we were going North. They told us-~ one\nof the guards were going to Hamburg, Germany. And there they\ngonna put us on a ship and blow us up. So we were very much\nconcerned what they gonna do to us and we didn't see anybody but\nwhat they evacuated before. So we kept on going from station to\nstation but the American bombers came in and bombed the stations\nbefore we got there. So the train was headed. back. A\ncouple hours till they repaired the trucks so we could get\nthru. So finally we arrived to a station in Hanover, I\nremember Hanover in Germany the Americans came in and bombed\ncompletely the station. And the railroads everything was\nflames everywhere was burning. And we stayed with before we\ncan get thru we stayed on the train. It took we stayed\nthere 2 days and waited until they repaired the train. The\nstation was still burning. They made the train go thru the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. ALAN ZIMM\nPage 7\nflames it was burning on each side with the train went thru.\nFinally, after about 6 days on the train we arrived at a",
        "small station called Bergen. That was a junction a railroad\ncrossing. And there trains coming from other directions too\nwith prisoners but we eh other places. So I had overheard\nthe Germans the guards talking between each other now we\nhave a chance to go into Americaner? or to the English,\nGermans. We had to surrender to either to this one or that\none. So I knew the end was coming. But there still was get\nit was guns like there machine guns around you all the time.\nAnd no food. And everybody was from the group we we came\nfrom Bergen, half of the people were dead actually. If we\n1f I wouldn't got the loaf of bread and the can of meat was\nhiding under my shirt I would never survive either. When we\narrive there, before we arrived at that station, we stopped\nin an area with a farm like a farm. The train stopped for\nno reason, I don't know. This asked the guards wanted to\nhave some water for themselves so they stopped the train,\nand eh eh I said to the guard who was sitting next to me,\ncan I go with you get something I Saw some prisoners over\nthere in the field. Had some piles you know that could\nmean all kinds of things. So a French man in Belgium, war\nprisoners also grabbed by the SS. But they were not\u2019 like\nus, they waS a a waS war prisoners they were treated\ndifferently like us. So we arrived there when in the the SS\ngot took some watering and buckets and I said does this can\nI go over to the prisoners maybe get something to eat there.\nMushner! Mushner! So I ran over there to the Frenchman I\ncouldn't talk French I say Mzham Mzham food. And they let\nme take potatoes and turnips what they had there whole",
        "potatoes I just put them in my shirt and put~ some\nturnips. . .mumbling. . .my friend was me we ran back to the\ntrain. I had 2 of my close friends I gave them _ some\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. ALAN ZIMM\nPage 8\npotatoes to eat, whole potatoes we ate that's all we were\neating. Finally, after that we arrived at Bergen they made\nus get out of the train, and line up whoever was living\nstill line up and we could holler I could still walk. But\neh some people could hardly walk. So we hugged each other\nfive in a row, and made us walk and there were a whole\ncolumn of prisoners walking a a 1100's and SS were all around\nus with machine guns, bayonets. So we walked and walked and\nwe Started to walk 9 o'clock in the morning. When we\narrived there. We arrived at the camp. It was a camp I\ndon't know what camp it was--it was three o'clock in the\nafternoon. Turn right, you go in there, and the gate opens\nup, and we walked into this camp, Bergen BElsen. But here\nwere two camps actually, one was half a mile further down,\nwhere the women were, women, and this camp wa a vacant camp\nwhat the army used, soldiers used this for themselves\nthey had no space where to put us. They put us in this",
        "camp. We stayed in the camp--everybody, they assigned us to\ndifferent barracks. We went in to lay down, there was\nnothing in, er, no tables, no nothing just straw on the\nground and cement. We lay down, we were so exhausted we\njust lay down and fell asleep. we must have slept about a\nday an a half there. When we woke up--\nwas, probably if was about the twelfth of April of 45.\nSuddenly we looked out of the window and they say, I was\nwith a Polish young priest, Polish ex-soldiers in civilian\nclothes, we were together--Jewish prisoners were there very\nfew--from the whole 35,000 prisoners there in Bergen Belsen,\nthere must have been 200 of us left from all over. So I said\nwhat are you making out of this. He said, Oh, I looked, he\nlooked and leaned his head out of the window. He said: the\nGerman army is here, the army, not the SS. The SS is\nsomewhere else out there setting up guns, machine guns,\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. ALAN ZIMM\nPage 9\nheavy guns, and and all kinds of equipment, war equipment.\nI said: What do you think they are going to do? He said:\nMaybe they are going to kill us all here. Nobody believed\nthey're going to survive. Till the last minute, we didn't",
        "believe. Suddenly a grand battle erupted. Without, without\nany warning, the they shooting the German with heavy guns,\nmachine guns are shooting, and and and we hear from far away\ndistance artillery, shooting in our direction and explosions\nall around. The camp was in a wooded area, all woods, no\nhuman beings around there, and not far from the camp was a\nroad, in the woods going between the woods, a road going\nsomewhere, we don't know where. The battle took about 24\nhours, a day and a night, and the following morning, early\nin the morning, the guns were silent, nothing moving,\nnothing, er er, eerie feeling--you don't know what's going\nto happen. Laying down nobody there to lift his head. I\nSaid to the chaplain, the young priest: What do you think is\nhappening? He said: I don't know. I said: Let's look out\nand see where they are, the Germans. So he picked out his\nhead up to the window, the glass was gone, the windows were\nShattered, all was gone. He said: We don't see any\nsoldier--all gone. What happened? He looks around, there's\nnobody here. So we looked out the little window. The SS is\nstill there. But they had put on white arm bands on _ the\narms and there still were the guns. And they came, guarded\nby Hungarian SS, all around. We can't get out from the\nblocks; we're sitting in there with no_- food. We stay\nalready there almost four days without food. it was the\n13th of April. After it was quiet. The sun was out, nice.\nWe looked out the window and suddenly like an earthquake,\neverybody's running, all the prisoners are running to the\nmiddle of the camp. We didn't know what happened. They",
        "don't care about SS, they don't care about the guards, they\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. ALAN ZIMM\nPage 10\nare running. So I said to my friend: What we shall do? He\nsays: Let's run too, see what's going on. We jumped out of\nthe barrack of this barrack--we run. They knew what\u2019 was\ngoing on there. There were mounds of potatoes, mounds of\nturnips covered in the ground for the winter for the\nsoldiers there. They prepare for the winter, and they were\nstill in the ground, and with their hands, everybody grabbed\nwith their hands uncovering the mounds. we uncovered\npotatoes and turnips, I said: Well, this is something.\nThey didn't care who's shooting, or the German are there or\nnobody. So I grabbed some potatoes, we're eating while\nwe're digging, we're eating already because we were so\nhungry. We didn't know what to. do. So I grabbed two\nturnips put under my shirt on my shirt, a couple of\npotatoes, and I said to my friend: Let's go back. I don't\nwant to stay out here. We can get shot here. So we run\nback, we lay down and we're eating. We're waiting, it's\nquiet, nothing happened, SS is there, the Hungarians outside\nthe fence with guns and they're wearing the white arm bands.",
        "So in the afternoon around the 14th, they said to us: You\nknow what? the loudspeakers announced: Tomorrow morning at\nnine o'clock, the Swiss Red Cross iS going to come in and go\ntake you over. We will nothing to do with you anymore.\nTomorrow morning nine o'clock. Nobody believed it, because\nthey were lying to the last minute all the time. So why\nwould the Swiss Red Cross, why would they put white arm\nbands when the Swiss Red Cross iS going to come tomorrow\nmorning? While we were debating that--it was about 3-4\no'clock in the afternoon--the sun was out and the fourteenth\nof April. Suddenly we hear the tremendous roar, noise,\nroar, uh, heavy artillery or tanks are moving from\nsomewhere. And it comes louder and louder, so one of the\nofficers, a Polish officer was in civilian clothes; he never\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. ALAN ZIMM\nPage ll\nlet anyone know he was an officer. He said according to the\nnoise what he can hear, they're not German tanks. They're\neither Americans or English. So sure enough, the noise was\nso loud, we looked out the windows, we were not afraid\nanymore, to look out, and sure enough, in that road to the\nwoods you could see tanks, with stars on it - white stars",
        "and all kinds of markings but no Germans.",
        "S: We've gotta stop and change the roll...",

        "tanks, there were all the tanks, everyone was Jumping up and\ndown, hugging and kissing and now we finally believe we're",
        "free - we gonna be free! What was happened, they didn't",
        "come the camp; they passed by and went to the small town of",
        "Bergen to secure the radio station. And then the SS_ told",
        "us, \"You have to line up tomorrow morning exactly at nine",
        "o'clock in front of the barracks.\" [At Palank], we couldn't\nsleep hardly that night; we wee so agitated, we're so",
        "anxious to see what's going to happen, because even the",
        "[less many] people didn't believe they would be liberated.",
        "So in the par - the next day in the morning, 9 o clock,",
        "exactly. The gate, far down the camp was a gate. The gate",
        "opened up anda jeep with British military police, dressed",
        "in red with red hats and white belts and white gloves\u2019 and",
        "all, green and white. Everybody said, \"What, who are these",

        "dressed up in a war like that. And the jeep with machine",
        "guns, 4 soldiers and two soldiers behind, and they came into\nthe camp and disarmed the SS. Took the guns away from them",
        "and put the men aside. And behind them was a truck with",

And they were jumping up and down and running\nto the English soldiers and they were throwing cigarettes\nand candy to everybody. And we were hugging and Jumping\naround in front and then behind them were coming trucks with\nsoldiers. And they were right away taking over the whole\ncamp, and setting up microphones with music was playing,\nlike that, and we were, this was the liberat-, they were\nliberation. And we were, everybody was running around, we\ndidn't know what to do - where to go, what to say. We were\nJumping and hugging each other and kissing and embracing.\nAnd they disarmed all these Germans and the Hungarian SS and\nthey took over the whole camp. And they took the guards\nwith the SS and the Hungarians as prisoners. And there was\na fenced-in area and they put \u2018em in that fenced-in area.\nWhat happened after the liberation actually, the Russian\nkapos set up a tribunal. I couldn't go there and I. didn't\nwant to bother with it, and took all these kapos, the German\nSS, and they sentenced them to death. While the British\ntook over the camp, they let the prisoners rule and do what",
        "they want. And they executed about 50 of them, at that\ntime. I couldn't watch it; they did all kinds of terrible\nthings to them. To the guards, the SS guards. So we stayed\nthere about two days, where as no, the British didn't bring\nany food. They just took us some crackers and cookies and\nand candy. That's all they had, the soldiers. I said,\n\"Where's food?\" The prisoners demanded food, they, we\ndidn't eat. They said: The ships hadn't arrived yet. They\nhave to bring..the ships ar coming to Hamburg and we'll\nunload the food for you. But by the time the food comes\nhere, we're all dead.

And\nsure enough, they had jeeps, and trucks the Russians) right\naway took over German trucks and went out to the villages.\nWithin a few hours they brought in chickens and all kind of\npigs and cattle and goats, you name it, they brung in more\nthan food. ? fires and kitchens were cooking and everybody\nhad food to eat. They were preparing food for us. So this",
        "was the way we stayed in that camp a couple of weeks until\nthey organized everything. They gave us DP identify cards\nand they disinfected everybody, you know, gave care, took\ncare, and then different people came from different\ncountries. The French came in French officers and soldiers,\nthey took them home right away, about a week after\nliberation. Trucks came in for the Frenchmen, trucks came\nin for the Danish, the Hollander, the Belgium, there were\nprisoners from everywhere there. And all the nationalities\nfrom western Europe, they were taken home right away after\nthe liberation. But eastern Europe, like we were from\nPoland, Czechoslovakia, and Russia, they didn't take nobody\nhome, the war was still on, the fight was still going on\nthere. And we were staying in that camp Bergen-Belsen until\nthe war was over\nand when the war was over, it was June the 8th, before the\nwar was over after the liberation, the German ? found some\nairplanes while the war was still on, five days after we\nwere liberated they came to this camp, dropped off bombs,\nfive prisoners got killed by these bombs after the\nliberation. So finally we were ready to go leave the camp,\nthe war was over and they say we cannot go to Poland now,\ncause why? They said: Now all the leaders are in Berlin, in\nPottsdam.

So finally we had\nbicycles, five of us, to Poland together. We drove the\nbicycles into the city of Magdeburg, which was occupied by\nthe British all of it was British zone. We stopped there,\nand the British were nice to us and the Polish, there was a\nPolish army there working also, ? with the British. They\ntook us under their wing, so to say, and they put us in a\nhotel and we stayed ina hotel until the conference was\nover. And they gave us food and shelter and everything. And\nthen finally we went back to Poland, took us two months\u2019 to\nreach Poland after the liberation. I went back to the city\nof Lodz, where I was in the ghetto before there. I arrived\nin Lodz, they told us there is a place to go where you\nregister. we registered with the survivors, all the\nSurvivors coming from all over, different places.

It was a small town where a German\nfamily, a German family, was a small synagogue, they hid it\nfrom the nazis all these years and protected the Torah, the\nscrolls, the holy books in the basement. And the British\ncame in and liberated it. They went to the British and\ntold them: there was a small synagogue. We protected it.\nSure enough, the synagogue was a little ? of this house.\nAnd the British told us: You have to go there, looking out\nonly for the Jewish prisoners, war prisoners, we were\nliberated. So we went there and we told them, they took us\nby truck there to the little town, it was about 10 miles\naway, and on Friday services, it was a British chaplain, a\nJewish rabbi from the British army in uniform. He went to\nthe basement and took out the scrolls, the Torah, and he\nwalked up with the Torah where the arc was, there was no\nscrolls in there, and made us walk behind him.

So when everybody was walking\naround in the camp looking for something to eat, so the SS\ncame and said to us on the loudspeaker: We have some bread\nand canned goods for you on tucks waiting there. So\neverybody 1S running to that area. So the major from the\nSS, a doctor, you could tell he was a doctor, he wears\nspecial insignia, he came and he stood in front of these\ntrucks and said to us: Please do me a favor, do not touch\nany of that food, do not touch it, don't take it.\nEverybody says: Why?

So the German was\npleading with them, the doctor: Please, wait another 24\nhours. You're going to be free, the English are going to be\nhere. Nobody believed him either.
