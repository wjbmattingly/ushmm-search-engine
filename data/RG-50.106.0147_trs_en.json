        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Margitta Cooper conducted by Gail Schwartz on\nJanuary 4\"\", 2002 at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. This is tape\nnumber one, side A. What is your full name?",
        "Answer: Including maiden a -- Margitta Granberg Grunberg Cooper.",
        "Q: And where were you born and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born June the 10\", 1929 in Speyer, Germany.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family. Tell me about your parents and their\nbackground, how long they had been there.",
        "A: My father was one of the religious leaders in the town, he was also the cantor\ncum rabbi. He was born in Poland. My mother was a -- a young woman who\nmarried -- in her day, who could -- never had a career, of course, she married from\nher mother\u2019s house, married my father. He had been married before, he was a young\nwidower, as a matter of fact, when she married him. She -- how they met I never\nknew because there was some romantic story that she had gone to visit a friend and\nhe met her and he fell in love with her. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s about it.\nProbably a blind date. Anyway, they married, they had one child, who died. My\nsister died when she was 10 years old, which was a devastating event for my\nJanuary 4, 2002\nparents. And, as a matter of fact, if it had not been for the death of my sister, I\nprobably -- my brother and I would not have been born -- we were twins. So in\nconsidering my father and his philosophy, he -- it had to be somewhat ironic for him\nto have lost a child and then have twins born. At any rate, that\u2019s how we arrived, and\nI think we had a n -- very nice life, a very nice home. Stable. I mean, I felt no\nanxiety or fear, at least not until I was about five years old, when it became more\ndifficult to be a Jew in Germany and | think that\u2019s an old story. And the children, I\nthink, more than the adults, began to react to my brother and I as Jews, even though\nthere were still children who were not Jewish, Christian children who would play\nwith us, because there was a park in front of our home. I had Jewish friends. I was a\nchild that had -- my brother and I -- more m-me, because my brother was very well\nbehaved. I always had the feeling that I had to be very well behaved. I was a special\nchild because of my father and certain conduct was expected of me, so that was\ndifficult. It was a very religious home. My father was a relig -- 1-1-in -- in the sense\nthat it was strictly Orthodox. My mother was, I think -- I don\u2019t know how sh --\nexactly what her beliefs were, but certainly she -- she upheld whatever my father\nwanted to do in a -- in -- in the marriage. She was a very nervous woman because of\nmy sister\u2019s death. I think that was a terrible trauma for her. So when I think of what\nultimately happened to my mother, it\u2019s unbearable to think that this woman who had\nJanuary 4, 2002\n-- ended up her life the way it eventually did. And that I find probably the most\nunforgivable thing about this whole situation that happened in Germany. And let\nme say now, at the outset, that what happened in Germany, while it was unique in\nthe history of the world, notwithstanding great sieges, great battles and great\nsuffering among other peoples of the world, I have come to the conclusions after\nmany, many years of thinking about it, that whatever happened in Germany could\nhappen anyplace, given certain economic and cultural events, and that it is singularly\ninappropriate for -- for people to be smug and say well, you know, this is -- these are\nthe people that were able to do it. I think all peoples are capable of doing it.",
        "Q: What were your parents\u2019 names?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Anna Rosenthal Greenberg. She was born Irena\nBayata, but they called her Anna. My father was Benjamin Greenberg and they\ncalled him Benno Greenberg.",
        "Q: And -- and your brother\u2019s name?",
        "A: My -- my brother\u2019s name was Heinz and he was my twin and he now lives in\nFlorida and he\u2019s a grandfather. So I mean, you know, it\u2019s wonderful, when you\nthink about that.",
        "Q: And tell me a little bit about your late sister. What was her name and what did\nshe die of?\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: My -- my sister\u2019s name was Margot and she was absolutely exquisite, I have a\npicture of her. She was angelic. Not only because she died, because people become\nangelic after they\u2019re dead, but from -- everybody said that she was just a sweet and\ngentle child. And her death not only devastated my parents, but I think my mother\u2019s\nbrothers, her uncles and my -- my grandmother, and I think that -- she was really\nbeautiful. I mean, she looked like the Rosenthals.",
        "Q: Wha-What did she die of?",
        "A: Diphtheria. She was fine. They had sent her to Switzerland to reco --\nrecuperate, and I think from what now that -- I was in the medical field a little bit for\n-- for a long time, she -- I think they must have given her digitalis to strengthen the\nheart, and I think they o -- overdosed and I think it killed her. She was only 10 years\nold. So I think that\u2019s precisely what happened, although, you know, it was so long\nago, I mean, was 1928, so it\u2019s difficult to -- but they did bring back the body from\nSwitzerland -- it had to be a -- a frightful event for my parents. And -- but as I said,\nyou know, my childhood was pretty normal. I was -- after the -- do you want to hear\nthis?",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you a little bit more before we get to the --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- the -- to the -- the 30\u2019s --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- or the mid-30\u2019s. What kind of neighborhood did you live in, was it a Jewish\nneighborhood, or a mixed neighborhood?",
        "A: Mm-hm. It was a Jewish neighborhood. It was a very nice neighborhood, you\nknow, each house was individual, had land around it.",
        "Q: You were right in the center of the city?",
        "A: Not really. I would have thought it was more -- it was not a big -- I mean Speyer\nis -- 1S -- it was a fairly well known city, it had a very famous cathedral and it had\nthe Speyer Diet..there was something with Luther that was there, too. I think it was\nmore toward the outskirts. It was a very residential area and there were lots of Jews\nliving in that area. There were some Christians too, but they would have been across\nthe park. And there was a beautiful church not too far from us and then there were a\ncluster of homes there, too, that I think belonged to Christian families. But where I\nlived, our neighbors were Jewish. The interesting thing was that maybe 20 yards\nfrom us, around the corner, was what is known as a -- it was like, not barracks for\nsoldiers, but like a building that housed soldiers. You know, army soldiers, not SS or\nNazi. And that was very -- that was strange, because 1-it -- right in -- in this area they\nhad what is called a -- a -- I don\u2019t remember what it was called in Germany -- in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nGerman, but they had soldiers living there, training, being trained there. So I used to\nwatch them when I was little, and we -- they were very friendly then.",
        "Q: You had mentioned extended family. Did you have quite a bit of relatives,\ncousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents?",
        "A: [had a grandmother who lived in Gimbsheim, where my mother was -- where\nmy mother was born. My mother had two brothers. One was a bachelor all his life\nand came to the United States in the late 30\u2019s, 1939. And she also had a younger\nbrother who was married and I had one cousin. And then there were various assorted\nsecond cousins. My mother -- my grandmother was widowed when she was like, in\nher late 20\u2019s, from -- you know. And -- but she had a brother who came to this\ncountry as a young man. Now, I have family that live in Wichita, Kansas, too. So, I\nmean, you know, it\u2019s the old story about emigration and -- and -- and families and\nintermarriages and -- and -- but we -- we -- it was nice. I -- I -- it was a nice -- it was\n-- it was a nice -- it was a nice life for a child and certainly it had to be for my\nparents, you know, because they had a position in the community and -- and that wa\n-- that was --",
        "Q: You said your father was a cantor, was that his full time work?",
        "A: Work, yeah, plus he was educating all the young -- youngsters. He also educ --\nyou know, he also had classes. He also trained all the boys for their Bar Mitzvahs,January 4, 2002\nplus he had Sunday School, that he ran. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m sa -- once -- th-that\u2019s why\nI said initially, my problem was that I always had to be on such good behavior,\nbecause of him.",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself? Were you an independent child?",
        "A: I think the word brat would probably come to mind. Independent. Well, I -- I\nthink the one thing I -- that I learned and that I love, and I think that made it much\neasier to cope with me is I loved to read. And once I discovered books, I think I was\neasier to cope with. Before that, I -- I didn\u2019t understand what I did that made it --\nmade me always get into trouble, but I did, you know. And my mother would say,\nMargit, please stand up, Margit, please sit still. You know, the usual things, you\nknow, that children do.",
        "Q: Were your parents Zionists?",
        "A: My father I am su -- I didn\u2019t understand what Zionism was, but certainly he\nbelieved in the state of 1 -- of 1 -- not -- at-at -- Palestine, absolutely, because I heard\nhim talk about that. They were firm believers that Jews had to have a place to go.\nAnd he was very, very much aware of what was happening in Germany, because he\ntold my -- my mother\u2019s brothers both to get out, and they listened to him. He could\nnot leave, they would not let him.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll talk about that also in a little while --\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: Yes, sure.",
        "Q: I just wanted to go more into your own personal life.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yes.",
        "Q: You said you liked to read, any other hobbies that you had?",
        "A: Now?",
        "Q: N-No, when you were a child.",
        "A: Oh. I read, I played. But I would think that reading was my great passion, always\nand still is.",
        "Q: What about sports?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t very good. I mean, let me put it to you this way, when they would\nchoose people to play, after everybody else was chosen they\u2019d say, well, we\u2019ll take\nher, you know? That was the final choice, nobody really wanted me. But I -- it\ndidn\u2019t bother me because I-I loved it, even though I was so bad at it. I mean, I\nplayed badly, but I loved doing it and I was always thrilled when they even would\ninclude me. So that was -- sports was not my forte, no.",
        "Q: Did you have a special relationship with your twin brother?",
        "A: Y-Y -- no. Yes and no, we fought a lot. Oh, I did te -- take violin and all that\nstuff. You know that my father was very musical and had a wonderful voice and he\nplayed like umpteen instruments, well. So I learned how to play the violin badly,January 4, 2002\nbecause I really wanted to play the piano, but my brother got the piano, per usual, he\ngot everything, you know -- know the old ch -- my brother was a -- is and was a very\ngentle, sweet boy. I was really the monster. I mean, h-he -- it wa -- it -- definitely\nrole reversal there somewhere, you know. But yeah, we got along fairly well.",
        "Q: What kind of school did you go to?",
        "A: Well, in the beginning we went to a public school -- I mean, public -- sort of\nprivate public school, like they have in Europe. It wasn't a school like they have\nhere, it was a small school. But then eventually, when things were very bad, we had\na tutor that came from another town and taught all the Jewish children in -- in -- in --\nin -- in Speyer. He came every -- every day.",
        "Q: When you were very young --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- did you feel very German?",
        "A: I never thought about it, I was German, that was it. I was a German and a Jew\nand the two were not mutually exclusive, you know, there was one or the o -- I wou\n-- if you\u2019re saying did I feel a great sense of patriotism about Germany? I don\u2019t\nknow. I don\u2019t think any child really thinks of it, unless -- I mean, today, after\nSeptember the 11\", I\u2019m sure there are children who will say, I\u2019m an American and --\nand be very conscious, who were unconscious before. I think it takes a catastrophicJanuary 4, 2002\nevent to make a child realize it. I became very conscious of being a Jew, and not\nbeing accepted as a German, after awhile.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Did you have any non-Jewish friends --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- er -- early on?",
        "A: Oh yes, I had always Christian friends. As a matter of fact, I got a letter not too\nlong ago from one of them, and I should -- I se -- I\u20191l send you -- and she goes to my\nsister\u2019s grave and she makes sure that it\u2019s still taken care of. So I mean, she -- yeah,\nI did, and I loved them. And they still played with me. I mean, some of -- some -- I\nmean, my mother, for example, sent me to a convent to learn how to knit and\nembroider because she and her -- my grandmother threw up their hands, they\ncouldn\u2019t do it. And they sent me to the nuns, and I learned how to knit and I learned\nhow to embroider. I had a nun there who would sit there and tell me wonderful\nstories. And it was fine. I was a Jewish child. I was the child of a -- a -- Dr.\nGreenberg and nobody ever thought about it. I also had a laundress who came -- we\nhad a laundress who brought laundry back -- back and forth every week. I went to\nher house, I had ham sandwiches, and I -- my father found out, he was a little\nexcited, but I was never very good. So, I mean I -- those are the kind of things you\nsaid how I got in trouble. I knew I shouldn\u2019t during Passover eat bread, let aloneJanuary 4, 2002\ncold cuts. So I mean, that\u2019s the kind of troubles I was always in. But it was, as I said,\nfine. I mean, I loved it. I would go with my -- I would go to the nuns and they would\nteach me. So there was a lot of interaction between a non-Jewish community and our\nfamily.",
        "Q: And favorite holidays that you remember? Anything that stays out in your mind?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I remembered -- I always liked the holidays, I did not like Passover,\never. I hated the Seder, I thought it was endless. I wanted to eat. But I liked Rosh\nHashanah, I loved Yom Kippur, because I was allowed to eat lunch, and then I loved\nbreaking fast, because they used to make something called Pergelfleisch. I don\u2019t\nknow if you know what that is. It\u2019s -- it sounds horrific, it\u2019s called pickled beef, but\nit is the most wonderful thing in the world, nobody\u2019s ever makes it, nobody knows\nhow to make it in this country. And I looked forward to that and having bread and I\nlike the -- I like Saturday night dinners, except Swiss cheese. My father once said to\nme why -- why do you -- Margit, why do you hate Swiss? He s -- I said, I only like\nthe holes. Now those are the kind of things that did not endear me to my mother.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: German. A little French, but mostly German.",
        "Q: And why French?January 4, 2002",
        "A: Because my mother liked it. But I mean, we\u2019re talking about phrases like n\u2019est-ce\npas, or you know, comme il faut, or something like that. We\u2019re not speaking -- I me\n-- | mean, I\u2019m not talking about real, real conversational French.",
        "Q: Well now let\u2019s begin -- when did you first hear of a man named Hitler? I mean,\nyou were born in 1929, so when did you first hear --",
        "A: I think when I was five -- five, six years old. It\u2019s when -- when I first saw the\nuniforms and I saw marching through the streets, and then --",
        "Q: What -- what do these uniforms mean to a five year old?",
        "A: Th-The reaction of the adults to them. I -- I think I became more nervous about\nthem because of the reaction of the adults. The fact that suddenly there was a\ndifference, there was more tension.",
        "Q: Did your parents explain what this meant? Earl -- we\u2019re talking about early on.\nDid your parents say anything?",
        "A: No, no they didn\u2019t. All I know is that, for an example I was walking down the\nstreet one day when I was about maybe seven. I think it was -- began really when I\nwas seven, and they were throwing stones at my brother and I, and they were yelling\ndirty Jew and -- and he -- he was hurt, I mean, they hit him. And when he -- we\ncame home, that\u2019s when my father and my mother said we couldn\u2019t play any more\nand we couldn\u2019t go to the school any more. So I was about seven or eight when it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nreally, really, really began. And the German soldiers themselves began to change.\nTheir attitude became -- there was so much hostility now. There was a different,\nthere was a -- a break, and there was fear. Kristallnacht was when I was nine years\nold already. It had begun way before then. Not as terrible as it was after\nKristallnacht, but there was a change. There was no longer the comfort level.",
        "Q: What happened in school? Was this -- was your school a Jewish school, or both\nJewish and non-Jewish students and faculty?",
        "A: They were -- it was a non-Jewish school, and they were non-Jewish teachers, and\nthey did begin to express a difference. I-I think there was begin -- the beginning wa -\n- who -- whichever one of them was a -- an anti-Semitism, now felt free to express\nit, whereas before they might not have.",
        "Q: This is preceding Kristallnacht, we\u2019re talking about?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I -- it was, but again, 1t was much worse after Kristallnacht.\nAfter Kristallnacht it became flagrant. And then -- let me say that at the time, you a\n-- also -- after -- even after Kristallnacht, there were still people who did not, in any\nway, react to us in a negative way, who became overtly anti-Semitic. The people\nwho were really anti-Semitic were always anti-Semitic. Now the children were the\nsurprise. The children who became so -- who became, you know, really taunted us\nand began -- made life so difficult for us. Those are the ones -- the mu -- most of theJanuary 4, 2002\nu -- most of the Christians ignored it, ignored us. They might not have been friendly,\nbut they were not overtly -- they were not overtly cruel or anything. It was the\nchildren more than anything else, and some of the teachers.",
        "Q: When you and your brother were walking down the street, you said in some\n[indecipherable] can you describe that in more detail what your -- what thoughts\nwere going through your head as a young child, when that was happening?",
        "A: When I was walking -- I walked with my brother and they began taunting us\nboth.",
        "Q: What kind of things were said, do you remember?",
        "A: You dirty Jew, Christ killer. That was a big one. All -- get out ,;we don\u2019t want\nyou, you don\u2019t belong here, all the usual. And then they picked up stones and it\nbecame physical. They hit me, and I ran. I think they may -- I may have fallen and\nscraped my knee. They hit my brother and of course, you know, he bled. And after\nthat we were not allowed to go to school any more, my mother said no, we were not\ngoing to go. And we never went anywhere -- anywhere without having somebody\nalong, or traveling in -- more than two. It was a terrible thing. I think it traumatized\nmy brother to the point that even today he doesn\u2019t even talk about it, let alone\nremember it. It was a terrible --",
        "Q: When -- when did this happen? Was it before Kristallnacht?January 4, 2002",
        "A: Yeah, it happened before Kristallnacht. Maybe -- I\u2019m trying to think, was it\nbefore? No, I think it happened after. There were things that were happening before,\nbut after Kristallnacht it all came together. It became a -- it became now a\ngovernment directed persecution and I think it became -- and -- and -- and now the\nrhetoric was geared up so high. I mean, you know, we -- we -- the -- the -- the -- the\n-- the vendetta against Jew -- Jews, and the fine -- resolution became now a par -- a -\n-a--a--anaim, a political aim. And it became -- and I think -- you give people\nenough propaganda and you tell them and you repeat something enough, even they\nwa -- they want to believe it. If they have any dis -- I mean, today in this country, if\nyou have a minority that somebody dislikes, if you give them enough power and\njustification to react to that minority, they will do it. And Hitler gave people the\nright to do it. He gave those children the right to hurt us. And he gave those people\nthe right to burn down the synagogues and to arrest people and to murder them, and\nlet the oth -- and let -- and let them -- and let the -- the people stand by passively and\nallow it to happen, because he made them feel that this was okay, that they -- he was\nabsolutely getting rid of an -- of a world evil. That he was destroying a hydra-headed\nmonster called a Jew. So it -- that was permissible.",
        "Q: What does a flag with a swastika or a German in a uniform mean to a seven year\nold little girl?\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: Oh, a -- it frightened me. I remember I used to walk very quickly with my head\ndown if I saw them. They would stand, you know, at kiosks and if I saw one of\nthem, and the sad thing, the sad thing that I did not forgive myself for for a long,\nlong time was that I was so intimidated by them and wanted so much to belong and\nbe part of that -- this -- this -- this life, these children that had -- were so rejecting to\nme -- you know, were rejecting me. And I saw them with their little uniforms and I\nwanted so much that I actually one day walked by a German soldier and the child\nahead of me had given the heil Hitler sign, and I raised my hand and said heil\nHitler. Even though I know this m -- I knew by then that this man was our sworn\nenemy. I mean, they had arrested my father already, and -- by then. And I knew.\nAnd I remember he turned around and he said to me, you\u2019re a Jew, which humiliated\nme even more. Now, it took me years, I couldn\u2019t think about it. When I would think\nabout it I would like break out in sweat, I was so humiliated and embarrassed and\nangry that I -- but I was -- I forgave myself after awhile. I realized I was a child, I\nwanted to belong, I wanted to be part, and I wasn\u2019t any more. I was now ostracized.\nAll -- we all were. All our friends were. We were now persona non grata.",
        "Q: And again, did you talk this over with your parents?",
        "A: Oh yes, we talked --",
        "Q: And how did they handle it?January 4, 2002",
        "A: They themselves didn\u2019t know how -- what to do. My father only knew one thing,\nthat we had to leave, that it was done, that we had to go. That -- but he couldn\u2019t, he\ncould not get out. They -- he was refused the visas, he was considered a political\nprisoner and he couldn -- but he knew. I mean, he urged my cousins, he urged my\nuncles, he urged everybody to go, they all left. They all went. They went. He knew\nthat there was no survival.",
        "Q: Whe-When did he try to start leaving?",
        "A: He left -- immediately after he came back from Dachau, when they had arrested\nhim aft -- at Kristallnacht they arrested him. He came back six weeks later, he did\neverything in his power -- I think he had done it before, but not with the kind of\nurgency that he felt then.",
        "Q: Prec-Preceding November \u201938, was his work at the nu -- at the synagogue\naffected at all?",
        "A: No, that continued. And I'll tell you something else that was interesting. One of\nthe priests tried to -- wa -- on -- during Kristallnacht woke him up to tell him the\nsynagogue was burning, they ran down and saved the Torah. I mean, you know ya --\nI mean, the -- 1-in all -- in the midst of absolute evil -- and I use that word in its true\nsense, there are people who took an interest. I remember walking with my mother\nwhile my father was in the -- in Dachau and I met one of my nuns. I had -- was noJanuary 4, 2002\nlonger going there, you know, because I think it was difficult for them, they couldn\u2019t\n-- | mean, anybody who had anything to do with a Jew was at risk. So I remember\nshe bent down, she kissed me, and I had this overwhelming feeling of sadness,\nbecause sh-she ha -- the tear rolled down her cheek. So I mean she -- they all -- we\nall knew, I mean everybody knew that we were condemned. Nobody knew about the\nconcentration camps yet. My father knew Dachau existed and Buchenwald existed,\nbut nobody understood what the ultimate plan was. I mean, nobody could -- would\nhave believed it, except that my father knew that the ultimate plan was to kill\neverybody, and he wanted his family out. Now, I think my mother -- and this is\nsomething I\u2019m not sure about, but I do believe from what I remember as a child, that\nmy mother could have left, and she refused. She stayed with my father. So I -- you\nknow, I think she could have gone with her brothers, because they were leaving, and\nmy grandmother could have gone too, and they chose not to go, they chose to stay.",
        "Q: Could she have taken you too, the two of you?",
        "A: Probably. But for some reason she wanted -- she didn\u2019t do it. She didn\u2019t. She\ncondemned herself, effectively, to death, and probably us too, although I don\u2019t think\nshe really believed they would kill us. I don\u2019t think any mother believes that her\nchildren are going to be killed. But I think she could have gone. And that -- for\nknowing my mother as I know her, it -- as I remember her, it -- it -- she was such aJanuary 4, 2002\ndelicate, as I said, nervous woman, for her to have made that decision had to take\nenormous courage. I mean, for her to know that she was going to stay in this horrible\nplace where, you know, when everybody else was starting to go, you know, I think it\nhad to take enormous strength. I don\u2019t know if I could have done it. I don\u2019t know if I\nwouldn\u2019t have said, I -- I\u2019m sorry, I -- I\u2019m taking my children, I\u2019m running. I think it\ntakes a very strange love, belief, confidence in your mate, or not being willing to\nleave him, you know, to -- to face it by himself. I -- I -- he -- she did that. I think that\n-- that -- that\u2019s one of the remarkable things about her.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Margitta Cooper. This is tape number one, side B. Let\u2019s now talk\nabout Kristallnacht. What are your memories of that specific time?",
        "A: I think it was probably one of the major traumas in my life. First of all there was\nthe burning of the synagogue, which while I -- I must say, being a little brat, as I\nsaid, or a child, for one glorious moment I said, oh thank God, I don\u2019t have to go.\nBut then I -- then even -- e-even I understood that this was not a good thing. But\nthen they came to arrest my father.January 4, 2002",
        "Q: Wer-Were you awake at night? Whe-When did you first become aware what was\nhappening?",
        "A: I heard the banging on the doors, and I heard them -- my father going downstairs\nand we -- the maid and my mother and I heard -- I knew it was the priest. And my\nfather ran out of the house.",
        "Q: This is in the middle of the night?",
        "A: Yes. And then when he came back at five o\u2019clock that morning, I heard again, a\nlot of noise, and I ran downstairs and I -- I mean, I don\u2019t think they had gone to\nsleep, I mean, nobody did. I mean, my father was still dressed, and he had burned\nhis hand, and I think he had -- was wearing like a bandage on it. And the SS had\ncome in and they were arresting him. And my mother -- this is -- and my mother was\nhysterical, everybody was hysterical and I started to become hysterical because I\ndidn\u2019t understand. I must say the SS again, this is the contradiction in human beings,\nwhen they saw me and my brother, they tried to reassure me. They said, itll be all\nright, your father will be all right. And of course they were very polite. I mean, there\nwas nothing of the sturm and drung kind of thing that you see in the movies. They\nwere very calm, very icy, very -- you know, waited for him to get hi -- you know,\nput his coat on and everything, and he was arrested. Now, once that happened my\nmother did everything to get him out, once we found out where he was, how -- the\nJanuary 4, 2002\npolice kind of told her where he was, or somebody told her. My grandmother and\nmy uncle all tried everything. And I'll tell you a story that sounds like something out\nof a movie. My mother took -- told me to get dressed one afternoon, and I -- were t -\n- |-I was dressed, and she took me by the hand, and she had her pocketbook, and in\nher -- and er -- and she was holding a little chamois bag. And I\u2019Il never forget the --\nand I remembered what she wore. She wore a -- she had a magnificent blue coat\nwith a blue fox collar and she wore that coat with a matching blue dress. And we\nwent to the police, and we sat outside and waited, and I had no idea and for once I\nwas very quiet. And then she -- they told her to come in and we sat in front of this\nman and he wore a black uniform with the SS -- I mean, the swastika on his arm.\nAnd my mother said to -- they were talking and then she opened this little bag and\nshe too -- put all her jewelry on the desk and she said, you may have it all. She said,\nI would like you to have it, she says, if you can get me -- if my husband come home.\nAnd I'll never forget what this man said, he looked at -- my mother was a very\npretty woman, and he too-took her -- the jewelry and he put it back in the bag and he\nhanded it to her -- of course it was all gone eventually anyway. And he says, I\ncannot take it, he says, but I will -- and I ca -- he says, I will try to do what I can. So\nwe went home, and about three days later I heard footsteps coming down the street\ntoward our house, I knew it was my father. I knew it. I woke up the whole\nJanuary 4, 2002\nhousehold. I start screaming, I said, Papa\u2019s home, Papi\u2019s home. And everybody says\nno, no, no. My mother says, what? I said, he\u2019s coming. And sure enough, the door\nrang -- there was a knock on the door, we all flew, and there was my father. He had\ntaken -- he -- as he left the camp, he had given his jacket, his overcoat, everything he\nhad to the prisoners that were left, that would never come home. And he had a white\n-- he wore his white shirt, he was very thin. My -- my -- my mother, of course, wept.\nWe put him into -- he went to bed and I remember during the morning -- this was\nvery early in the morning, was maybe 5:30 - six o\u2019clock in the morning -- everything\nin Germany happens either in the middle of the night or early in the morning. That\nseemed to be their best time, you know, like the vampires, you know, do well at\nnight. Anyway, I remember tiptoeing into his room to make sure that he was there,\nyou know? And I remember he looked at me, he says, Margit? And I said yes. I\nsaid, are you all right? He says yes. Of course he wasn\u2019t, because he knew. You see,\nmy father then knew that ultimately it was all downhill from then. I mean, you\nknow, the school, everything had stopped, the tutors came. They were -- the families\nwere trying to get out. Of course, the families that ended up going to Gerthe with\nus, stayed. They did not get out. And I still -- of course, and there were still a lot of\npeople who really believed that this was some kind of nightmare, that something\nwas going to happen. But then the united -- I mean, England went to war.\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "Q: How lo -- how long was your father in Dachau?",
        "A: Six weeks. They kept him from Kristallnacht out and he came home in the\nbeginning of January.",
        "Q: Did he tell you anything about what happened while he was there?",
        "A: He said it was very bad. He says there were a lot of people there. He said there\nwere a lot of young men there. And he also said that that time that they were not\ngetting out, that these were people that -- I don\u2019t think they had gas chambers then,\nbut these were really prisoners -- not all Jews. I don\u2019t think they were all Jews. But\nhe said the conditions were horrific. There was hunger. Of course he was so thin\nwhen he came home. There was already hunger, there was already a lack of food,\nthere was lack of warmth, it was very, very cold. That\u2019s why he left all his clothing,\nas much as he could. The conditions were very bad and obviously he knew, he\nsensed that they were gearing up for something very big. And he also found out that\nDachau was just one camp. There was also Buchenwald then. And he was --\nBelsen-Belsen wasn\u2019t there yet. But he was -- he knew. He had heard from what --\nhe -- he told my uncle, who had come to visit him right before he left -- he left for --\nfor -- for the United States. That\u2019s why I know that my mother could have probably\ngone because my uncle came from Berlin to see his sister. And --\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "Q: But what did you do when your father was away? What activity, did -- were you\nstill in school or had -- had you been expelled from school?",
        "A: My mother slept with us that night. I didn\u2019t -- oh, I forgot to tell you that. The\nnight that my father was arrested, that day my mother was so panicked that she\npacked us up and took us to cousins in Mannheim. She thought that -- she -- she --\nshe just was so frightened and probably went there to figure out what they could do\nfor -- for my father. We stayed there, I\u2019d say almost a week. And I remember I cried\nthat night, I got like hysterical, I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know if it was a\nperformance, that I was being Sarah Bernhardt, or what, but I -- I -- I -- you know,\nand we stayed for a week and then came home and I think that\u2019s when she -- dis -- di\n-- | think that\u2019s when already they had begun to try to get to release him. The tutor\ncame, I still played with my friends, my little Jewish friends. I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think\nany Christian child was allowed to play with a Jew any more at all.",
        "Q: When had you started with a tutor?",
        "A: As soon as we had to leave school, all the children, all the Jewish children got\ntutors to co -- got one tutor and we were taught in a little room someplace.",
        "Q: When -- when did you have to leave school, do you remember?",
        "A: Yes, after Kristallnacht. Oh, maybe -- I think after Kristallnacht, yeah, yeah,\nyeah. I think it was then, and I think it was very uncomfortable before then, too. YouJanuary 4, 2002\nknow, there was a lot of anti-Semitism. And as I said, the teachers who really didn\u2019t\nlike Jews were free to begin to react to it.",
        "Q: W-Were you physically hurt in school at all?",
        "A: No. No, no. No, no.",
        "Q: What -- what kind of things did the teachers say to you?",
        "A: Well, she would -- you know, she -- it -- 1t wasn\u2019t anything overt. It was, your\npeople, or -- you know, th-the -- the usual things, you know. Y-You know, you all\nthink you know everything, or something, you know, there -- wa -- there were little\nslurs, which they could get away with. I think after Kristallnacht they could have\nprobably been much more overt. But by then aw -- there was no child that was\ngoing. I mean, we couldn't walk the streets, we were afraid. Our parents were afraid.\nSo it had become an absolutely impossibility for a child to continue in public school.\nAnd it -- it -- it was dangerous. So my brother and I and my friend Truda Alcon,\nwho now lives in New York and Gunter Katzen, all of us had this crazy man who\ncame, poor soul, he came from Ludwigshaven every morning and went back. He\nwas a bad teacher, too, very boring.",
        "Q: Wa-Was there secular subjects and religious, or just --",
        "A: Secular. My father taught religion, you know, whatever religion I have -- had. I\nwa -- I became, of course, an agnostic by the time I could think straight.January 4, 2002",
        "Q: Do you remember names having to be added on, Sarah and Israel to the par --\nadult names? Does that --",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that. I don\u2019t think so, no. The only thing was that -- things\nsettled actually into a routine. That is why the arrest in 1940, to go to Gurs was such\na profound shock, because life had become a routine, like everything else. I didn't\nthink -- nobody thought about being re-arrested again. I mean, my father, I think\nsuspected and maybe my mother, but I as a child thought everything was over. So\nwhen they came that night, I had no idea.",
        "Q: Preceding Kristallnacht, Hitler had marched into Austria --",
        "A: Mm-hm. Yeah -- oh, we --",
        "Q: -- did you, as a child, know about that?",
        "A: Oh, we all knew. My fa -- there was a -- my parents were very political and their\nfriends were political, so I knew about the anschluss and I knew about --",
        "Q: And again, what does that mean to you as a child, a nine year old?",
        "A: I wanted Hitler to die. I wanted Hitler -- I wanted the Jews -- I had these\nfantasies about these great Jewish generals riding, in their great armies, to defeat\nJanuary 4, 2002\nHitler. I had visions of -- of God coming -- and I believed in God, of course -- I bel\n-- | thought that God would reach down his hand, the way he did it in the Bible and -\n- and -- and smite them, all the Germans, all the Nazis. That was my fantasy, and\nthat\u2019s what I -- well, I was always a dreamer and I visualized this, you know, these --\nthis great host suddenly coming and -- and -- and destroying the Germans. And that\nwas wonderful and that\u2019s why I knew that there was war. And when England would\nsend her planes over at night, and my father and I would be outside watching the\nplanes coming, while my par -- my mother and my brother and my grandmother\nwere downstairs, my broth -- my father and I would go up to see. And the planes\nwere coming, they were bombing Germany as early as 1939, most people don\u2019t\nrealize it, 1939 and \u201940. I was thrilled. I loved it, I was excited that the Englanders\nwere coming. The English were coming. Yes, I wanted Germany to be defeated. I\nknew that, you know, that I -- the Russians had -- I mean, I was horrified when I\nheard that the Russians were friends with the Germans because of the pact that\nStalin had made. I mean, those were things that stunned me.",
        "Q: Had you -- what did you know about the United States by that time, by \u201938 - \u201939\n- 40? What did the United States mean to you? What di -- what was the concept of\nthe United States to a child?\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: The United States of course was not called the United States, it was called\nAmerica. America was the land, literally, of milk and honey. America was the\nPromised Land. America was the land that God chose for us to go to, if we were\nlucky. It was the place of miracles. It was utopia. It was everything that human\nbeings could possibly visualize. The great hope was America, and that I understood.\nWhat it was, I didn\u2019t know. I knew it was a country, but I had no idea -- it was\nsomething myth -- almost mystic. It -- I didn\u2019t know, I just knew that I had to get to\nAmerica, that in order to live, for us to be safe, we had to go to America. And that\u2019s\nall I knew and that\u2019s -- I heard that, of course, from adults.",
        "Q: Did you ever listen to speeches of Hitler on the radio?",
        "A: No, well yeah, the raving and the ranting, but I didn\u2019t fully understand, you\nknow. But when you talk about America, I had read Lord Fauntleroy, who was\nborn in Brooklyn, you see, so I had an idea of how wonderful America was, and I\nhad read some books that -- that you know, I -- I had read a translation of some --\nsome books that had Americans in them. So I knew that this was the place,\nabsolutely.",

        "Q: Ho-How much destruction was there of your synagogue?",
        "A: Not that -- not that much, we -- it was able to be used. The only thing that was\ndamaged, I think, was the -- in -- in the -- the sanctuary and I think that was\nrepaired. I -- as I said, the life, oddly enough, continued after Kristallnacht, in a --\nin a bizarre sort of a way. There was -- I -- I -- there was -- there was none of the -- I\nmean, we didn\u2019t live in fear and trembling, at least I didn\u2019t. What my parents or my\nfather felt, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure they -- they were much -- but I didn\u2019t, I -- you\nknow, children are very resilient. I accepted things had changed. I\u2019m not going to\npublic school, I have a tutor. I don\u2019t go outside to play that much, that\u2019s fine. I mean,\nJanuary 4, 2002\nI adapted and it became normal. What was -- what was abnormal now became\nnormal.",
        "Q: Did you confide in your brother at all?",
        "A: No. Mm-mm, we were -- very rarely talked about this. And then, you know,\neventually it wasn\u2019t normal any more. 1940 arrived and the Nazis arrived and they\narrested us again in the middle of the night, the Germans are night people. And they\ncame and said pack up, and that was it, I mean, that was the end. And we left our\nhouse for good.",
        "Q: Ta-Talk a little bit about that experience, when you -- were -- you were fast\nasleep?",
        "A: I was fast asleep, again there was a banging on the door and the soldiers came in.\nNot Nazis, soldiers. They told us we had two and a half hours to pack everything we\nneed. My mother forgot my clothes, most of them, so that was very tough for me in\nGurs. I mean, you know, kind of had to wear a very few things. She na -- she was\nvery upset that she forgot. But anyway -- but I would have outgrown them anyway.\nAnyway, she -- we had two and a half hours. My father wept. That\u2019s the only time I\ncan ever remember my father, because my father knew that this was it. Of course,\nhis horror was that we were going to go to Buchen -- he did not know about Gurs in\nFrance. He thought we were going either to Dachau or Buchenwald.

        "A: 40\u2019s, in their 40\u2019s, cause my sister had been 10, so my mother was in her early\n30\u2019s, she must have been then in her very early 40\u2019s, yeah. And so was my father,\nthough my father must have been older, in his -- maybe in his middle 40\u2019s. Anyway,\nwe went to Frankfurt.",
        "Q: Tell me about getting on the truck. What were people saying?",
        "A: Silent. There was dead silence. It was very quiet. I mean, we just sat there and I\nthink some people wanted to know where we were going, and what was happening.\nAnd the thing that my mother was very upset about, cause there was laundry in the\nlaundry, in the -- in the washing machine. I mean, those are the little things that are\nabsolutely heartbreaking when you think that a woman was riding to eventual death.\nAnd what was she worried about? That somebody would find out she had laundry\nleft in the washing machine. That\u2019s what enrages me so. That\u2019s when I feel totalJanuary 4, 2002\nrage, at that -- those little minutiae, you know, those little -- little things. Anyway, it\nwas quiet.",

I took Tarzan, I took the kinderha -- hagen, th-the -- that -- that -- that the -\n- that\u2019s a special series of little books that will -- for a -- she -- 1t was called\nkinderhagen. And that means the little nestling, you know, the little bird? That\u2019s\nwhat it is, like a child, you know. And I took some books. We -- it was chilly. We\ngot to Frankfurt, they gave us wonderful sandwiches, and which were -- which\nwere not kosher but my father said I could eat them. I thought they were great. I said\noh, this is going to be wonderful. Then we got on the train. Huge train that stretched\nfor as far as you could see. And we all got on there, everybody that was -- had been\nunloaded from the trucks got on this train.",
        "Q: So the truck went directly to the train station.",
        "A: Right, station, right. The train curved around the entire track, that\u2019s how long it\nwas, and we all got on there, and that m -- at that moment, my grandmother, I think\nhad what is known to -- would have been called a TIA, a transient ischemic attack.\nShe did not know where she was and she was disoriented and confused and of\nJanuary 4, 2002\ncourse terrified. And -- but she was okay after that. We got on the train and the train\nbegan -- and -- and they were slamming the doors shut and --",
        "Q: This is a passenger train, with seats?",
        "A: This was not a cattle train. And they were slamming, and the train began to move\nand then it stopped, about an hour later and said, anyone who has jewelry, give it up\nnow, a -- or you will be severely punished. Now, there are people who -- my mother\ndidn\u2019t have any, and if sh -- I mean, she had given her -- ma -- jewelry that belonged\nto her to my uncle to take to the United States and I got that eventually, but just a\nfew pieces. Most of it she had already sold. I think probably to bribe -- bribe -- for\nbribery to get my father out, which was fine. Whatever money they -- she had. And\nthere were people who did hand it over and there are other pe-people I don\u2019t think\never did, and I hope they didn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t matter, they were going to die anyway. So\nanyway, the train then went, continued and continued and -- for hours. I mean, don\u2019t\nforget, we were leaving Frankfurt and going to the Pyrenees, which is -- and you\nknow, so it was overnight. And then we got to this place, and there were more\ntrucks. And they unloaded the train, this enormous train of people --",
        "Q: Were there many children with you?",
        "A: Oh yes. Well, the families, yeah, they had a lot of children, which is an\ninteresting story. When we got to Gurs, I am not -- I\u2019m very vague how we gotJanuary 4, 2002\nthere. I think it was also by bus, but we got to this place which was a sea of mud\nwith barracks. They separated the men and the women. The women had the children.",
        "Q: O-On the -- on the trip to Gurs --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- you said there were many children. Were the children calm? What did -- did\nthe parents say to them? What did your parents say to you o-on the journey to Gurs?",
        "A: My -- I -- Iasked wher-where we were going, and I go -- I have to tell you, my\nparents were very -- always very truthful. My father said he did not know and so did\nmy mother. But my father also said we are together. And -- and that was -- I think\nreassuring. I was not afraid. Now, I think maybe -- I\u2019m not sure, in retrospect,\nwhether the reason I wasn\u2019t afraid is because even though I always thought through\nthese last four -- three or four years that it had no affect, it did affect me and that I\nhad become very -- not stoic, maybe but dis -- disaffected, or disas -- you know, and\nno longer associative with a -- you know, a -- a -- a -- lacking affect, in other words.\nThat maybe in some way I had detached myself, so that I was really looking at it\nnow from -- from -- from a perspective that had nothing to do with me. I was there.\nSo maybe that\u2019s really more the truth than anything else. At any rate, I was not\nafraid. I didn\u2019t know, and I wasn\u2019t afraid of death, and I certainly never thought of\nanybody harming me. When we got to Gurs and I saw the sea of mud, I knew. TheJanuary 4, 2002\nwomen, once they were separated from their men, fell apart. And this little dictator,\nmeaning me, and all the other children -- oh, the German soldiers then said, get the\nwomen organized. To us. To us children. So that we were marching up and down\nthese long barracks where these women were huddled, didn\u2019t know what -- I said,\nget yourselves organized. I said to my mother, sit there with Omar. And my mother,\nwho would have probably had a shrieking fit having been told by her 10 year old\ndaughter how to behave, right, did exactly what we told -- and we were so drunk\nwith power, these kids, we were like, you know \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d? I mean, we\nwere telling everybody what to do. There was no place to lie down, there was no\nplace to do anything, I mean, it was barracks. Long barracks with nothing.\nEventually they gave us these pallets, you know, to lie -- sit on, to lie on, but there\nwas nothing then. And then they did come with the pallets and they handed them\nout. And every family, every mother and her child had like a little -- ha-have you\nbeen to -- in barracks? You know, you can put stuff under the little eaves, you\nknow? Well, that\u2019s where they put their possessions and that\u2019s where we were, it\nwas very cold, damp, and very muddy.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking April 1940.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And a sea of mud. I mean, that\u2019s the one thing I remember about --\nno, this was in October of 19 -- was it --\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "Q: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, October 1940.",
        "A: Yeah. This was a sea of mud. I mean, you could not step anywhere.

        "Q: Did you say goodbye to your father when you were separated?",
        "A: Yeah, we said goodbye, and I knew he was going to be down the road from us.\nThey did tell us that they, you know, the men were going to be in one section and\nthe women were going to be in another section. But it -- but can you imagine leaving\nyour home and suddenly being transported for 24 hours or whatever time it took,\nand 1 -- and then put into a strange place in a barracks? I mean, and having\nabsolutely nobody to tell you anything, nobody to explain to you what was\nhappening to you? I mean, f -- Americans -- I mean, I -- I sometimes think to\nmyself, what would happen if tomorrow morning this happened in this country,\npeople suddenly vanished? I mean, you no longer saw anybody that had lived in that\nhouse for umpteen years and was suddenly gone. So I mean, th -- it was a terrifying\ntime for -- for -- for -- for these -- for these poor women and for the -- and the\nchildren were crying, a lot of the children were crying, they were afraid. Again, I\nwasn\u2019t afraid. I -- I just a -- I -- you know, I just gave orders. And it worked. I -- inaJanuary 4, 2002\nstrange way I guess the -- the -- the three or four of us who were running around\nbeing, you know, the administrators probably did a lot of good because it made\nsome of the mother\u2019s angry enough to say, who are you to tell us anything, and it\nprobably established a sense of normalcy, you know? And that was the beginning of\nGurs.",
        "Q: And then what did you -- what -- what -- did they give you any food? Can you\ndescribe the living conditions there?",
        "A: The food was horrific. They had a stove that really didn\u2019t throw much heat. The\nfood was really like very -- like thin gruel soups. They had a place that they had\nbuilt o -- on -- like on -- on -- that you walked up, it was like on stilts, where they\nhad running water and stuff and a toilet, and toilets. And where you could wash. The\ncamp had originally been established for Spanish prisoners and had been emptied\nafter the Spanish Civil War. So actually we were using that, those facilities and of\ncourse they were not great facilities. It was a -- I think there was a lot of ent --\ndiarrhea, I mean, all the unpleasant side effects of not having a -- a decent food and\ndecent water and decent conditions and certainly very -- no medical care, very little\nmedical care. There were deaths. A little child died while out there. My father was\nallowed to sort of wander around and sort of, you know, help, because he was, you\nknow, a-as a -- sort of a religious leader, they allowed him certain privileges.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002",

        "A: He came to visit, oh yeah. And I went -- was able to see him. I wasn\u2019t allowed to,\nbut I'd sneak over there anyway. Yeah, he -- the men were allowed to visit. I mean,\nnot conjugal visits, just to see their families. Yeah, I think maybe once a week or so,\nthey came. My father came more frequently. He also was able to get me -- he was\nable to get my mother galoshes. The thing that was always -- you know, like little\nboots, because of -- and me, too. The thing I did learn, and I\u2019ve never forgotten is if\nyou need to flee anywhere, you better damn sight have money. You can\u2019t stop at the\nATM machine. You have to have cash on you, your life is always saved by money.\nMoney is a most valuable commodity you can have, if you are stuck anywhere\nwhere -- you can always buy your way out. It\u2019s sad to say, but that\u2019s true. My father\nhad some money with him, and it was a -- he was able to make things a little easier,\nthan maybe families who fled and didn\u2019t have any cash on them at all. That was the\nimportant thing.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s how he got you your galoshes.",
        "A: Got me my galoshes and maybe got my mother a blanket -- my grandmother and\nmy mother a blanket. I mean, that\u2019s -- that -- that -- that\u2019s true. It -- it\u2019s sad that you\ncan\u2019t -- that everything is available if you have the money.",

        "A: The thing about Gurs was that -- the discomfort of -- for the -- more for the -- I\nthink, for -- for -- for th -- for the women than for the children. Now, there\u2019s certain\nthings that I -- I found -- I -- I wasn\u2019t bored. I just didn\u2019t -- I -- I just -- my -- I had\nmy girlfriend al -- Truda with me and we still played together and we play -- we\nwere together. The thing that bothered me 1s for example, there was a young wo-\nwoman in our -- in our barracks who was handicapped. She had a very severe defor -\n- severely deformed hand. And I\u2019m not sure if -- if it -- 1f -- if -- what happened, but\none d -- you know, she -- she was gone. I wo -- I came back one day and I -- you\nknow, when you live in a place, even a child as insensitive as I may have been, you\nknow -- you can sense atmospheres. I mean, there was -- even the 1m -- the -- even\nthe abnormal atmosphere of being in these barracks became a normality after\nawhile, so when you walk in and you sense another change, you know something\nhas happened, and I knew something had happened because I saw -- I did not see\nBecky.",
        "Q: And how old was she?\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: She may have been 14. She was older than I was, 14 or 15, pretty child, pretty\nyoung girl, but she had a very badly deformed hand, like a thalidomide hand. And\nsomething was -- and I think -- and there was something wrong with the second\nhand too, but one was really -- and I remember I walked in and I sat down and I\nturned around and I said -- I looked around and I saw her mother was sitting like\nwith her head bent down and not doing anything, and I said, where\u2019s Becky\u2019? And\nmy mother said shhh. And I said -- well, that was not the thing to say to me, so --\nunfortunately, so I said, where is Becky? And she says, Margit, I\u2019m going to hit\nyou. Be still. Now that -- when that happened, I said, did she go away, and I said --\nmy mother said yes, she went away. And I was glad, I was happy, I thought she had\ngotten away. It took me -- yet, I knew. I wanted to believe she had gotten away, but I\nm -- sensed there was something wrong. And then there was the little girl, beautiful\nlittle girl who became ill, she was about maybe three years old, and she died. And I\nremember th -- the mother screaming in this makeshift hospital they had there, they\nhad like a makeshift infirmary, that her body was still warm. She was screaming at\nmy father, saying, she\u2019s still warm. And I remember my mother was dissolved in\nsobs, I mean, she was hyster -- well, first of all, to see this mother lose her child,\nwell it had to bring back that same trauma for her, plus the fact that there was\nnothing to be done. And I\u2019m sure, under -- given circumstances, she would have\nJanuary 4, 2002\nsurvived. The thing was, eventually my father found out, or somehow discovered\nthat he could get my brother and I out of Gurs. And I think that in every energy he\nhad became bend toward that. And then of course they told him that he could -- his\nson could go. My brother, but not me. So my father told them -- and he told me this -\n- that he had two children, they were both going to leave, or neither will leave. He\nsaid, I\u2019m not letting my son go and my daughter is to stay here. In other words he --\nwhat he said to them in effect was, you\u2019re not sending my child, one child to death\nand not the other. They bo -- he says, they\u2019re twins. They belong together, they\nshould go together. And they let us. So it was me and my brother. It was my friend\nTruda and my friend Gunter Katz, who were among the four children who left\nGurs.",

        "A: Mm. Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "Q: What did you do during the day, and -- from October to April?",
        "A: Truda and I would play cards, somebody had a deck of cards. We would read.\nWe would talk. We would be outside in the mud, playing. I don\u2019t remember what we\nplayed. We played games that children played. There were no -- I think somebody\nhad a ball, we would play with a ball. We tried to play things that were normal. IJanuary 4, 2002\nwould go visit my father as much as I could, my brother and I would. But Truda\nand I spent a lot of time together and we would be playing games. I remember we\nwould sit on this bench they had, she and I and play cards together for hours on end.\nBut of course, any book. Most of the time, I would read. Now the children -- it was -\n- for the children it had to be -- there was no education. I mean, nobody -- there were\nno classes, there was not -- no school, except you know, my fa -- my mother would\ntry, but di -- we didn\u2019t go to school. We just -- it was just drifting every day. Get up\nin the morning, get washed, spend a little time with my mother. Find Truda, who le\n-- who was in the barracks, in the same barracks, but down, and -- and play together\nand then go outside if it was at all permissible, you know, and then go visit the -- my\nfather and then come and stay with my parents. It was -- it was a non-existence. The\nonly thing that really, really saved me wer -- were the books, was reading. The other\nchildren -- and when I talked to Truda about it she says, what did we do? I said, I\ndon\u2019t remember. She says, I know we played some cards. They were -- we\u2019re all in\nthe same boat. It was a non-existence.",
        "Q: Did your mother or father make any distinction about Friday night? Friday night\nShabbat?",

On Friday night\nJanuary 4, 2002\nhe came. And -- and -- I mean, there were -- the holidays, I mean, there was -- oh,\nand I will tell you something else. I was there for Passover. If a -- if you live to be a\nthousand years old you\u2019re never going to guess who sent the Jews matzo in -- in\nGurs. The Japanese sent boxes of matzos. I swear, it said in the back, Nippon. Can\nyou believe it? It was so amazing, I mean, and we did have matzo for Passover, and\nthat\u2019s how I knew it was Passover, my father told us. And right after that I left. But -\n- of course, Hanukah came there was nothing, you know.",
        "Q: Who were the guards? Were they French guards and did you understand any\nFrench?",
        "A: No, they were all Germans and they had their groupies with them, they had these\nwomen who I guess were -- must have been prostitutes, but they were very\nglamorous. You know, to me they were very glamorous, they were clean, they had\npolished nails, I mean, you know, and they had them living there. And they were\nGerman soldiers, they were all German. They were German soldiers, not SS. I think\nthe SS were sort of -- the commandant may have been SS, but the people guarding --\nwell, they had a -- they had no problems, they had a -- they had a -- a completely\ncompliant group of prisoners. I mean, nobody did anything. I mean, they -- they had\nnothing to do. They would stay in those kiosks, you know, along the highway. Th-\nThere was a highway that ran down and on each side were -- were the barracks. And\nJanuary 4, 2002\nthere was really nothing for them to do, and we would be walking on -- on -- on the\nhighways once in awhile, but most of the time we did nothing.

But he -- my brother eventually -- I think there was a\nproblem and my brother did come to us, but not in the beginning. And I think one of\nthe reasons that happened was because he -- my brother became ill and my father\nsaid he should be with his mother. And, you know -- yet, he missed my mother. So -\n- | mean, he was a little boy, and -- and he s -- came -- came with us, and he stayed\nwith us and it was fine, you know. He -- the thing was that -- that my brother had --\nhad become very quiet. He had completely become -- completely -- he was afraid.\nWhen we were at Gurs, I think my brother began to change. I think it -- it -- it -- I\nthink the final -- the final straw was when we -- when he knew that we were going to\nbe leaving by ourselves, without our parents, that we were going to be going alone.\nAnd I think for the children to know that they were leaving without their parents was\nvery frightening to them.

And that was the only premise under which I\nwas going to be going to -- I didn\u2019t understand that.

I said, I\u2019m going to America. And I told my brother\nwe're going to America. And they came. Whatever little clothing I had which I --\nyou know, was no good any more, packed it up, looked at all this mud, which was\nnow a sea of mud again because all -- everything had thawed out and it was, you\nknow, no longer frozen, it was -- had been cold there.

        "Q: What did you say to your parents when you were leaving?",
        "A: I said goodbye to them, and you know, the Germans allowed them to say\ngoodbye to us when we left for the United States, before they took them to\nAuschwitz. Did you know that? Did you ever hear that? After -- I just -- after I went\nto Marjelier there, when we finally were allowed to go to the United States, they\ntook us past my parents conce -- the concentration camp, near -- near Po. We wentJanuary 4, 2002\nto Po on the way to Spain. And they stopped the train and allowed the parents to see\nus One more time. My parents saw me one more time. M -- I didn't even recognize\nmy mother, she was so thin, and my father. And my father gave me a letter which he\nasked me to destroy, which I should have never destroyed. It was a wonderful letter\nto me saying whatever happens, life is for the living, remember we loved you,\nremember us. And I -- I -- I destroyed the letter cause he asked to d -- he was afraid\nthat 1t would be found on me. And he said, you came from a good family. You have\n-- you -- you -- you -- he -- he said, you came from a good family, a family who\nloved you. You -- we wanted a -- you were -- you should ha -- you\u2019re very bright,\nyou deserve a wonderful education. We loved you, both your mother and I. That this\nhas happened was not meant to be, but I want you to have a life and I don\u2019t want you\nerieve. And he says, I don\u2019t want you to hate, because he knew that I would hate,\nand I did. I hated with a passion for years. I mean, I\u2019ve -- I could not forgive it. It\ntook me long time. I mean, I would say it took me the better portion of my life to\nlook at anything that was German and not wish it the most horrible things to happen.\nWhen thalidomide happened, to my shame, and I heard there were German babies, I\nfelt not a shred of regret. When -- when Germany was being rebuilt, I felt nothing\nbut anger and grief that this country should -- but then I began to understand what I\nsaid in the outset of this interview, that human beings are capable, all of them, of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nmost horrific things. That we have an innate sense of cruelty. That we have what --\nwhat -- what -- what is referred to as our reptilian system that has never matured,\nthat has never developed, that has never -- that evolution has never taken care of,\nthat re-regresses to this atavistic state of absolute enormous cruelty and rage against\nanother person. And that\u2019s when I began to forgive the Germans, when I realized\nthat there are people in this country who are perfectly willing and able to destroy\nothers the same way the Germans destroyed us. So when I left Gurs -- to go back to\nthe original thing -- when I left Gurs and went -- went to Marjelier, there was this\nenormous castle.",

        "A: They had two adults with us who had -- somehow, I think -- they were people\nwho came to the concentration camp I should say, to Gurs, who were Jews, who\nwere extremely well dressed.

I mean, they w-wore fashionable clothes and they were\nvery patronizing toward my mother. They came to see her really out of respect fo-\nfor my father, but they were patronizing.

        "Q: So these are Jews?\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: Mm. So in some way they collabord way -- collaborated with the Germans. Now\nmy question has always been, in what way? I mean, what did they get, how did they\nescape being interned? How did they escape going to Auschwitz? How did they\nsurvive? I mean, it was like the French collaborators, you know, who -- who -- who\n-- like, you know, who sold the -- themselves to the Germans.

They came to pay their respects and to see what was going on and how could\nthey help, and there was nothing, but ma -- I remember my mother saying, what do\nyou mean, how can you help? You know, she was angry. But they left again. I mean,\nthey were free to come and go as they pleased. They had come to visit. From where?\nI mean, how do you get to Gurs from Speyer? And why were they not arrested?\nThat is -- I have to find -- I mean, I -- I really -- it always bothered me all these years\nhow this could have happened.

        "Q: So these people had nothing to do with your being chosen to leave?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think that came from the -- I think that came from a much --\nfrom an international kind of decision by the United States and other countries. No,\nthe people that took us to Gurs were probably -- I -- I mean, took us to Marjelier\nwere probably people who were sort of a liaison with all these different programs\nthat had -- they were trying to get some of the children saved, and that we got to\nMarjelier and I was very bewildered. And I -- you know, when they said it was a\ncastle, of course, after I -- I read all these books, I expected Cinderella, you know,\nwith a -- well, this was not the place. I mean, this was a big, big place with a huge\nentrance. And very barren, very cold. Not -- you know, it was set up to take care of\nchildren. I mean, it was not set up to be a salon or anything like that. And there were\nlots of children there already. We were just more. They had teachers. They had --\nthey had ver -- they were very good to us, I mean, they were very nice to us. TheyJanuary 4, 2002\nspoke French mostly, and that\u2019s how I learned to s -- really speak French much\nbetter. And they tried -- they tried to be really -- they really tried to educate us. I\nthink that was one of the big things, they wanted to continue our education and we\ndid go to school. Now, they gave me a little plot of ground outside for me to plant\nmy own vegetables. Well, that is the s -- I mean, I can not even grow a weed. So I\nwas the only one that nothing ever grew for. They were -- they -- they were -- they\nwere nice to us. I mean, there was not -- I mean they were not gushing and they were\nnot affectionate at all. I think they were doing a job, and I think they were also\naware of the fact that most of these children were going to be leaving, hopefully, and\nthat new ones would be coming in. When they finally -- now, there were children\nwho were grieving terribly. There was a child that came whose mother died in the\ncamp. She was an only child. She -- her mother -- she was in my -- she was in -- in -\n- in Gurs with us.",
        "Q: And the mother died in Gurs?",
        "A: No, the mother died in Auschwitz, but she was the only child of this mother who\nwas either divorced or widowed. It was the most wrenching thing for that child to\nleave her mother and for that mother to let her child go. I -- I mean, I -- I have\nchildren and I\u2019m sure you do too. I keep thinking of handing my child up on a truck,\n10 years old, or 11 years old, and in this little c-ca -- girl\u2019s case, six years old, and\nJanuary 4, 2002\nsaying goodbye and letting them go down a road where you don\u2019t know where\nthey\u2019re going. I mean, my father said America. I don\u2019t think he knew himself. The\ncourage it had to take, and not to weep, and not to -- and to control yourself and not\nlet the child see how s -- how anguished you are. This mother did that. This child\nlooked like frozen, like a piece of glass when she sat down. She was beautiful. Black\ncurls all over her head and she wore this little clean dress that her mother had saved\nfor the occasion and she was sitting there and weeping, I me -- I me -- like a piece of\nstone with the tears just falling down her cheek. And terrified, I mean terrified out of\nher mi-mind. She\u2019d never been alone, she had never left her mother. And she -- she\nwas so quiet, you know, she -- her mother had -- must have impressed on her -- she\nwas not in our barracks, that she had to do this, she had to go. And she had accepted\nit, but she didn't want to, you know, she kept saying -- and then that night she kept\ncalling for her mother. I mean, she was a little child. And th-the teachers would\ncome out and they would talk to her. As I said, they were not overly affectionate, not\ndoting. They couldn\u2019t be. I mean, there were so many children. And --",
        "Q: Who were the teachers?",
        "A: They were French. I don\u2019t -- I think they were Jewish. You saw -- saw some of\nthis. You showed me some of that stu -- they were Jewish. One was a married\ncouple for sure because they shared the room right where we all slept. And youJanuary 4, 2002\nknow something how -- you know, I keep think -- I-I -- you know, for years I -- I\nwas very smugly saying that these -- that I had absolutely no feelings about this at\nall, that I was absolutely objective, but when -- when the children were starting to go\nto America and I wasn\u2019t one of them, there were children that were beginning to\nleave and they were going to, quote, America. So one day I\u2019m lying in bed and a\nspider is walking alongside the bed -- ara -- along my pillow. And I said to myself, if\nthe spider climbs on my hand and climbs up my arm, I\u2019m going to go to America.\nSo the spider climbed on my hand and climbed up -- by now I'd probably faint, and\nclimbed up my arm and then stopped and then turned around and climbed down\nagain. And I swear to you Gail, the next day they came and said, you and your\nbrother are going to America. Of course, what it meant that I had signed my\nparents\u2019 death sentence. I mean, not me, but they had -- were going to Auschwitz.\nThat was the whole point. These were the families -- the children that left Gurs for\nAmerica were -- were the children of parents that had been d-designated for\nAuschwitz. They had already been named that they would be shipped to Auschwitz,\nand my parents -- my mother was shipped in the transport of 1942, and this was\n1941. So they were already designated for that. My grandmother had already died,\nand I didn\u2019t know that. My grandmother died in -- in \u00b042 -- I mean, no, she hadn\u2019t\ndied yet. She died in February of 1942 and my father -- now this is the thing that I\u2019m\nJanuary 4, 2002\nnot sure about, my father I think died in Gurs. I don\u2019t think he died in Auschwitz.\nThey have never been able to determine it. On the list it gives his name too, but --\nbut there are other things that indicate that he died in Gurs, of a massive heart\nattack, probably.",
        "Q: O-On what list?",
        "A: On the list of transports from Gurs, and I have that here, and -- but I\u2019m going to\nhave to send you copies of all that. Which means -- which is a horror to me, when I\nthink that 1f my grandmother -- I have the death certificate for my grandmother from\nGermany -- from France, and if my father did die before my mother left for\nAuschwitz, that meant that my mother went to Auschwitz alone. And that I find\nunendurable. I\u2019m hoping that if they went, they went together. But 1 -- I don\u2019t think\nso, I think my father did go to -- did die there and never got to go -- Auschwitz --\nand for him it\u2019s a blessing and for my grandmother certainly it\u2019s a blessing, she was\na woman in her 70\u2019s, so -- but for my mother I find it -- and I\u2019m hoping that if -- you\nknow, she did go, that there was somebody with her, that maybe the Alcons were\nstill there, because Truda said her -- of course her parents died in Auschwitz. So\nmaybe all the people from Speyer were still together then, you know.",
        "Q: Marjelier was a chateau --",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "Q: -- and it was southeast of Tur.",
        "A: Yes, yes, and it was a big place that had become a center for -- that somehow had\nbeen given over by -- by the French, I assume, to take care of these children until\nthey could be dispersed into different -- to different places. Now, this was not\noccupied France at the time. S -- what happened was, as -- as -- I was there only a\nfew months and what happened wa -- is that as we left, other children would come.\nNow, were these children -- how many of these children were from Gurs? I think\nmost of them came from Gurs. I don\u2019t think they came from ger -- I think -- I -- I\u2019m\nnot sure what other places they could have been coming from. I mean, they were not\ncoming from the German concentration camps. I don\u2019t know where else they could\nhave been coming fr -- to -- to Marjelier from, because Gurs was really -- there\nwas only Gurs.",
        "Q: Was this mar -- Marjelier sponsored by the OSA, the O-S-A -- O-S-E?",
        "A: I think so. I think that\u2019s who did it, yes. And I think they -- they were some -- the\nUnited States I think did offer to take X number of children. I think that\u2019s how they\n-- you know, I think they -- it was sort of sponsored, an international kind of thing.\nHow it came to be, I don\u2019t know. Certainly when I got there it was already\nestablished. I mean, we were not the first arrivals, there were children there.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with your parents when -- once you got to Marjelier?January 4, 2002",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: Between the time you | -- you got there and the time you left?",
        "A: No, there was no contact at all. As I said, the only time I saw them again was at\nthe end, when we left the country.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Margitta Cooper. This is tape two, side B and I\nhad asked you if you had had any communication with your parents bef -- until the\ntime that you left, and you said no. So how was that for you and your brother not to\nhave this communication with your parents? You were very young. What was that\nlike?",
        "A: The thing -- you know, as I s -- the thing that was so strange is that I really felt all\nright about it. I -- I -- I think maybe I thought this was just like a temporary thing.\nAnd the other thing was that I had become -- | -- I think I -- what had happened is\nthat I had become really disaffected. I did not realize it, but I think I kind of had\nbecome like numb. I didn\u2019t think about my parents except in the expectation that I\nwould see them, that this was a temporary situation and that they would eventually\nbe coming. I didn't think beyond that. I would hear little conversations between theJanuary 4, 2002\nteachers that would make me -- that would frighten me. For an example, they were\ntalking about what was happening to some of the children, children that had physical\nhandicaps. And -- and that\u2019s, of course, what happened with Becky -- that they were\ndoing things. They were very frightened and very uneasy, even about being in\nMarjelier. They were afraid of the Germans coming. The Germans had occupied, of\ncourse, a part of France, Vichy, France and I would hear little things, that they\nwere always very conscious of being at risk or in danger in some way. And that\nmade me nervous. And yet I thought, well, I\u2019m -- we here. So if I\u2019m here, and\nHenry and Heinz are here, then my parents can\u2019t be that far behind. So it didn\u2019t\nfrighten me. I didn't begin to understand that they were not coming until I saw them\nin Po. And then I knew that they were not going to be coming with us to America,\nthat we were going by ourselves. But until then, when the train stopped and I saw\nthe parents, I thought well, this is it, you know, we\u2019re -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re coming\nback. We\u2019re going now. We\u2019re going to America.",
        "Q: Did you go to school in Marjelier? Did they have classes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you learn?\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: They had classes in history, we took some math, we -- but it was all in French, so\nI mean, you know, I -- an-and they taught us how to speak French, of course, and\nchildren learn fast. And of course there were books, which was wonderful.",
        "Q: Did they give you clothes?",
        "A: They gave us clothing, absolutely, we had no clothing. They gave us clothing, as\nI said, they asked us to do -- we did work in the ki -- we kept our own rooms up, I\nmean the beds -- I mean, there was like a dorm. We made our own beds, we -- we\ncleaned. I, like an idiot one day thought it\u2019d be fun to help scrub the floors. That\ntaught me never to volunteer again. And -- and we worked outside and then la -- on\nthe -- on the -- in the gardens and grew our own vegetables, and it was -- it was -- it\nwas an absolutely work place. I mean, you know, the children were not pampered.\nBut it -- they -- it saved their lives.",
        "Q: And you had enough food?",
        "A: Yeah, there was enough food, it was not good. Lots and lots of lentils. I\nremember we were loaded with lentils, lots of legumes, n -- very little meat. Some\nmilk, some bread. Not -- not what you call haute cuisine. I mean, it was an --\nsufficient for us to survive on. There was very little fresh food, I mean, no oranges\nand things like that. Sometimes -- I have always wondered what the neighborhood\nthought, you know, what the neighbors must have thought of this place and all theseJanuary 4, 2002\nchildren, though Ill -- although it was pretty isolated, I mean, there were not too\nmany neighboring houses there.",
        "Q: Di-Did you go into the nearby towns at all?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think we ever did. I don\u2019t think we ever really left. There were places for\nus to roam around and to play in, but we never made visits into a-any neighboring\ntowns, until we left. Until finally we had to go and we headed for Marseilles. But --\nand -- you know, on the train. But it was -- it -- it -- 1t -- the children, again, were\nvery well behaved. I think all the children knew there was -- this was not normal.\nYou know, that we were going through am -- I mean, when you think of children,\nranging from the age, let\u2019s say, of six, seven, to maybe 12 - 13, all strangers to each\nother, suddenly being thrust into a situation where they never saw their parents,\nnever heard from their parents, having to exist in this way and having absolutely no -\n- no knowledge of what was to become of them. Except for me, I was positive I was\ngoing to America. My father had said so and I was going. But the rest of them\ndidn\u2019t know. Everybody wanted to go. That was, you know, one of the most\ntriumphant things was was one of the children came to me and said, I\u2019m going to\nAmerica. And that\u2019s when the -- right after that my little spider arrived. So, I mean,\nthat was -- it was like getting -- you know, it was like going to look at the bulletin\nboard in college and knowing that you been -- you know, that you\u2019ve gotten theJanuary 4, 2002\nschool of your choice. This was the dream of every child there, it was to come to the\nUnited States.",
        "Q: How many children were there when you were there?",
        "A: About 80, yeah.",
        "Q: And you mixed with the other children, besides your friend from Speyer?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. We -- well, my friend from Speyer didn\u2019t come. She went later.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah, they didn\u2019t come with me. Truda an-and Gunter came later, and Truda\nstayed in France for seven years after that. But she never left. The thing -- I came\nwith my brother by myself, with other children from gu -- from Gurs, but not\nTruda. No, she said she -- they were very upset when I left because they thought\nthey would never be able to get out, but they did eventually. No, these were children\nfrom everywhere.",
        "Q: Did you stay with -- did your brother sleep near you?",
        "A: Yeah, my br -- no, my brother slept with the boys and I slept with the girls. And\nthere was like huge dormitories and he was -- you know, and they would come up at\nnight and we were allowed -- they would turn lights out and that was it. It was -- it\nwas like -- it was like -- a little bit like being in a camp for the poor.",
        "Q: How was your physical condition, were you a strong child, physically?\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: Ye -- yeah, well I became ill on the boat. I got rheumatic fever. But I was fine\nthen, you know, when I came -- when I -- when I left Marjelier and I was on the\ntransport to Marseilles, they took two children off the train. They were friends of\nours from Marjelier. And it was a sister -- a broth -- a brother and a sister and they\nhad very bad eyesight, they wore very thick glasses. And the train stopped, the\nGermans came and took them off. Now, again, I don\u2019t understand that. I mean, I\u2019ve\nnever been able to understand why the ger -- the Germans allowed these children to\ngo to the United States, obviously, or the fren -- no, the fr -- no, the French took\nthem off, not the Germans, because we were traveling through unoccupied France\nat that time, til we got to Marseilles. It must have been the French that did that,\nbecause the United States would not have allowed them into the country, because\nthey could not see well. So when I became very ill, on -- on the train, I had the first\nattack, I didn\u2019t tell anybody anything cause I knew that they would take me off the\ntrain. And I was fine when I got to Marseilles. And I asked my pediatrician who\ntook care of me here, Dr. Liebolis in -- in Maryland why it would come like this,\nthat I would get this tremendous pain. He says -- she says, because that\u2019s what\nhappened. She says, it would come, the rum -- rheumatic fever is exactly like that,\nyou have these terrible pains. It affects the heart. And I was fine when I got to\nMarseilles. When I got on the boat it happened again, and this time was very severe.January 4, 2002\nAnd again I was afraid to say anything. But when I got to this country, my brother\nhad a fever, and they don\u2019t allow you in.",
        "Q: Okay, well --",
        "A: We'll go --",
        "Q: -- we\u2019ll get to that.",
        "A: -- yeah.",
        "Q: So, how did you know you were be le -- you would be leaving Marjelier?",
        "A: They told -- they came and told -- they called my brother and I into the office of\nthe headmistress and they said we\u2019re going -- you\u2019re going to be leaving next week,\nyou\u2019re going -- and I said, we\u2019re going to America. And she says, we are going to\nAmerica. I said, good. And I -- I was going to say to them, well when is my mother\nand father coming, but I somehow didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t. So she said to me, you know, we\n-- gather all your things together, and I did. I immediately was ready. I mean, I was\nready at that moment. And they came and they were who -- they were whoever we --\nit was a number of children. We all lined up. They had an -- this car. They had cars,\nnot -- not trucks.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t everybody in Marjelier at that time?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, just a few. There were maybe -- how many were -- of us came\non the boat? I would say maybe 20, that\u2019s about all, came -- again, only the par --\nJanuary 4, 2002\nchildren of those parents that had already been designated. And they came -- we --\nthey took us in cars. Now, when we got to -- we went by train to marjel -- to\nMarseilles. What happened that was very interesting is that our leaders, there were\ntwo adults that went with us -- and on the train to Marseilles is when Bernard and\nhis sister were taken off, and we never saw --",
        "Q: The leaders are Jewish leaders?",
        "A: Yes, I think they were Jewish. But when -- when we got to Marseilles,\nsomething happened and they told us to go very quickly down the steps because\nthere were Germans coming in. And whether they thought the Germans would stop\nus, I don\u2019t know, but I remember absolute panicking. I did panic then because she\nsaid, go quickly, quietly, down the steps to the trains -- to, you know, wherever we\nwere going, and we -- we all ran very quickly. And as I was running, I looked up\nand I saw the Germans coming and walking up the stairs. You know, we were going\ndown one flight, they were coming up another flight and I remember thinking, oh\nGod, ub -- because I saw their uniforms, the yellow uniforms with the swastika and\nthe black pants. And that -- I got very frightened cause I thought I would be going to\nAmerica, and -- you know, and we got --",
        "Q: Now -- th-this is now October \u201941?",
        "A: Yes.January 4, 2002",
        "Q: So you were in Marjelier from April to October?",
        "A: -- \u2018tober, yes. So then we get on the train and --",
        "Q: And you were 12 years old?",
        "A: Yes. I was not 12 yet. I was -- yeah, I was 12, I had turned 12. So anyway, we\nwere on the train, and oh --",
        "Q: Had you physically matured yet?",
        "A: Yes, I was just thinking, they had given me a bra to wear, cause I was starting to\nshow a little bit and I didn\u2019t like that. But anyway, I wore the bra and I was getting\nto be -- well, I was not chubby, but -- I wasn\u2019t chubby, but I was always a little\nshort. So anyway, one of the teachers had tilted my head up like this, one of the\nwoman teachers, very nice, I liked her very much, and said, you\u2019re going to be a\nvery pretty woman. And I never thought that at all, so I said -- I remember thinking\nshe was cr -- oh, she was right, by the way, I did turn out to be a very pretty woman\nas I grew up. Anyway, not --",
        "Q: Had you star -- how did you -- had you started to menstruate yet?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, not -- I didn\u2019t do that until I went to the Catholic co-convalescent\nhome in the United States after I had rheumatic fever. Catholics and I have a thing,\nI\u2019m telling you. So anyway, I -- we got on the train to Marjelier -- is a -- at mas --\nJanuary 4, 2002\nin -- in Marseilles and we headed toward the Spanish border, and that\u2019s -- was the\nincident with Po and my parents, you know. Wi --",
        "Q: T-Ta-Talk a little more about that.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: You did a little bit.",
        "A: Okay, th-the train stopped and they said to us, they said that the parents would be\nallowed to see their children for five minutes. So all -- from Gurs. These were all\nthe children from Gurs that were on the train. And I looked outside and there was\nmy mother and father and they came on for a minute. My mother hu -- my other was\nalmost silent.",
        "Q: They came onto the car of the train?",
        "A: Yeah, they came into the -- yeah, we were allowed to go -- they were allowed to\nstep into the train, to the compartment. And my mother was very quiet. I think -- I\nthink she knew. I think she knew. And she hugged me and she kissed my brother\nand I and she cried a little. And she said, be good. She says, be a good girl. And I\nthink they must have been shocked by how much I\u2019d grown in those few months.\nAnd then my father, as I said, gave me the letter, he hugged and kissed me, and I\nremember -- the thing I remember is when the train was pulling away and I saw\nthem standing there, together, how totally forlorn they were. Even as young as I was,January 4, 2002\nI knew that ineffable sadness that every child on the train felt when they looked at\ntheir parents. Not just me, we all felt 1t. We were absolutely saddened. Now ac --\nI\u2019m wrong, not all the children\u2019s parents were at Gurs, there were others who came\nto us afterwards and said, were these your parents? So they -- not all the children\nwere from Gurs, some of them were. I think most of them, because I remember\ncome -- some one of the girls coming in and say, was that your mother and father\nand I said yes. So it wasn\u2019t her p -- her parents weren\u2019t there. But we all knew that\npain, you know, that a child feels when they s -- when they suddenly feel that sense\nof insecurity of not having a parent, a -- any -- it was very frightening to me, and to -\n- | think to my brother, and the finality of it. And when the letter -- when I read the\nletter to my brother -- my father was saying goodbye, you know, an-an-and I knew\nthat was it. I\u2019m so sorry I ever tore it up, but it\u2019s gone. Anyway, we left Marseilles,\nnow we head toward wonderful Spain. We pull into ma -- this 1s --",
        "Q: What was your brother\u2019s reaction in seeing your parents, on saying goodbye?",
        "A: Devastating, he -- devastating. He was -- I -- I\u2019m telling you, for my brother the -\n- these little bits and pieces of life being torn away from him devastated him. I think\nhe -- he became ap -- he -- h-he -- he looked at this as something that he was totally\nremoved from. He went through all the motions, but he had absolutely no feeling\nwith it. He behaved normally, but I think my brother was very badly hurt by all this,\nJanuary 4, 2002\nall his life. So then we got t -- we got on the train and it\u2019s traveling, traveling, we\npull into Madrid. Now, we had been given Gruyere cheese -- cheese, grapes and\nbread by s -- the people in -- in Marjelier. I have never eaten a piece of Gruyere\ncheese in over 60 years. They were starving in Spain. This was after the civil war.\nMother were nursing their children at the depot. Soldiers in rags were walking up\nand down, there was nothing, we gave them all our food. All the children did, we\nhanded it through the windows, never realizing that we were going to Lisbon and\nwe would have to have nothing to -- well, we did, we all gave our food away. I think\npartly because we really were sick of the Gruyere, too. And the train continued to\nLisbon, and we arrived in Lisbon in this beautiful city, have you ever been there?\nYou -- it\u2019s still there, I s -- have a friend who went. You have this vista of the sea,\nthe medit -- it\u2019s just magnificent, and this beautiful hotel, where they -- these\nraggedy children arrived. I\u2019m sure that hotel concierge probably passed out when he\nsaw us, all these raggedly -- bunch of kids who hadn\u2019t been bathed in days, you\nknow, arriving. They gave us bread and butter, the best bread and butter I\u2019ve ever\neaten, and I\u2019m telling you, they would bring out trays of it, it would be gone in two\nseconds. They kept bringing out more and more trays of bread and fruit and\neverything and the minute it was -- we just ate like wolves, I mean -- oh, the other\nthing was, we -- we did stay in Marseille for about three days and they brought us\nJanuary 4, 2002\nfood there, too. That\u2019s where we got the Gruyere cheese and stuff. They brought in\nthis wonderful food, I don\u2019t know if it was kosher or not. But -- I mean, that was the\nfirst time we had really eaten really food -- food since we left Germany. I mean, we\ndidn\u2019t -- you know, that we had meat and we had potatoes and we had vegetables,\nand you know, s -- things. And the same thing in Lisbon. They brought us all this\nbread an-and cheeses and fruit and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and meals that we\ncould actually eat. That night they showed movies. I had never seen these movies.\nAmerican movies. They were in English, I couldn\u2019t understand, but I said, this is\nAmerica. Well, of course, you know, Shirley Temple, I mean, need I say anything\nelse? So that was wonderful, those were a wonderful three days because we were\nwashed, our hair was washed, we had clean clothes to put on. But, when I got on the\nboat, I had nothing. I had no underwear, nothing. So I wore -- I used to wash out my\nunderwear at night and -- and -- and wear it the next day and it was very cold. And\nof course, I was already sick, which didn\u2019t help, you know? But on the boat -- we\nwere supposed to sail on this boat and the boat, we missed it in Marseille. There\nwas a delay and when we got to Lisbon, this boat had sailed. That boat was sunk by\na German sub, and we t -- I would have never made it here. You would not be\nlistening to this absolutely scintillating story. I -- my -- we took the Safir Pinto\ninstead. And we left and I was very, very seasick until we got to Casablanca. And\nJanuary 4, 2002\nonce we got to Casablanca -- oh, and when I was standing there, you know, I was\nafter -- and you know, being a reader and being very melodramatic, I watched the --\nthe -- the shores of Europe recede, and I\u2019m thinking to myself, you must remember\nthis moment all your life, that you are now leaving. You have to remember this, this\nis an important moment. It\u2019s just like when I saw my parents, I said to myself, you\nhave to remember this, you have to remember them just as they looked. You know, I\nwanted to do that, and I did. I\u2019ve never forgotten it. Anyway, we got to -- we get to\nCasablanca and we stayed there for -- oh, I did not see Ingrid or Bogey, I just saw\na very dirty island, or dirty city. And then we sailed. It took us 10 days to come to\nthe United States. More than 10 days, like 13 days, with one pair of underpants.\nVery strange food, very elegant first class. They had women -- they had a lot of\nemigrants on that boat, ver -- again, a very motley crew of people in first class.\nWomen who were very heavily made up and wore very elegant clothes, and men.\nThey pretty much tried to ex -- ignore us because we\u2019re this ragtag bunch of kids,\nyou know, we -- I think we were sort of an object of pity and -- and also\nembarrassment and guilt, you know? That they were having this wonderful time\nwith music playing and dancing and everything and here we were with these big\neyes reminding them what was really going on in Europe, and they didn\u2019t want to\nbe reminded. I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t know how many were Jews or not Jews, but\nJanuary 4, 2002\nnobody wants -- wanted to be reminded. And they were sort of nice. But I had my\nfirst love affair on the boat because the son of the captain was on the boat, and he\nliked me. And he\u2019d sneak little things for me. That\u2019s when I first began to\nunderstand the importance of being a female, and what it -- 1t -- you can derive out\nof that. I got great oranges, all peeled and beautiful. I got wonderful sweets and ice\ncream. I mean, he got me lots of goodies. And I --",
        "Q: H-How old was he?",
        "A: About 13. I was 12. And he really liked me. He would talk to me. We didn\u2019t\nunderstand one word, I mean he spoke Portuguese and I spoke whatever. But we\nunderstood each other. And I would be sitting there and he\u2019d come up and the\nsteward would be trailing behind him and he\u2019d open up this thing and there would\nbe wonderful goodies, and I was -- became very powerful then. Then we got to the\nUnited States -- oh, they posed us -- oh, go ahead.",
        "Q: How many children were on the boat with you in your group?",
        "A: I'd say about 40. About 40, I think, yeah, not that many. Yeah, about 40 because\nwe -- when we landed you know, they posed me -- the newspaper, American\nnewspapers posed me. It must be still there in -- it\u2019s in the archives of the New York\nTimes for that day. They posed my brother and I on the rail of the ship behind the\nStatue of Liberty. The American reporters came to interview us because they heardJanuary 4, 2002\nthat the children had come from Europe. And that\u2019s how my Uncle Heinz found\nout, he opened up the New York Times and there on the front page was his niece.",
        "Q: Now what day, this is October?",
        "A: October -- it was October the seventh, I think. Anyway, there was his niece\nsitting there with her -- my brother. He -- he cried. My uncle, again, also cried.\nAnyway, they took --",
        "Q: O-On the ship, did you have any classes, or it was just free time?",
        "A: Oh no, nothing like that. No --",
        "Q: No English classes?",
        "A: -- no, no, no, but when the -- when the e -- nothing. We did nothing but roam the\nship, play and do whatever and sit and read. Course again, I found books, which was\nwonderful.",
        "Q: Did you have your cha -- your ho -- your own books with you? Had you been\nable to take them?",
        "A: No, no, no, I brought nothing with me. As -- I got on that ship without anything.\nWe had little satchel maybe of something, but when I left Lisbon, I really had\nnothing. I mean, I think I had one change of clothing and I really didn\u2019t have any\nunder things at all.\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "Q: When did you have to give up your personal books that you had brought with you\nfrom --",
        "A: I left them in Gurs for the children, for everybody else that was left. I never took\nthem with me. No, I would never have done that. That\u2019s one thing we learned to do\nis that we had to -- whatever we could leave for somebody else to use, it became\ninstinctive and we all did that. It\u2019s like when we gave all the food to the -- to the\nSpaniards, I mean, it was just instinctive to do that, we had learned to do that.\nAnyway, when we got on the United States, when the immigration people came on\nboard and the doctors, they took my brother\u2019s temperature and ma -- he had a li-little\ntemperature, so we had to go to this place in -- in -- in Queens or Brooklyn that was\nlike a rehabilitation [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Wa -- wa -- tell me, before that, what was it like for you to see the Statue of\nLiberty?",
        "A: I hadn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have a clue. I just thou -- looked at this big thing. I mean, I\ndidn't know what it was supposed to be. Everybody -- I mean, I heard them saying\nStatue of Liberty, Statue of Liberty and I knew libert\u00e9 means liberty. And I didn\u2019t\nknow what these reporters were all doing around us and then he -- one of them\nhoisted me up on the rail and he hoisted up my brother and they all yelling and they\nall talking, and this -- the interpreter is trying to say things and they were taking\nJanuary 4, 2002\nthese pictures. He says -- and I do remember this, I understood, how do you like\nAmerica? Are you an -- an-and | didn\u2019t understand and I kept saying yes, yes, you\nknow, oui, oui. I didn\u2019t have a clue. And --",
        "Q: What was it like when you first got off the --",
        "A: It was [indecipherable] that boat -- huh?",
        "Q: Oh -- oh -- oh -- and then when you got off the boat and got onto the land?",
        "A: When I got off the boat and on the land, the thing that absolutely -- absolutely\nstunned me is as we walked -- driving through the streets is the outside of the food\nstores. The fruit piled up. I could not imagine that human beings had that much to\neat. I mean, the -- the abundance of everything, and the way people were walking\naround and the yelling and the screaming and the waving and -- and you know, we\nwere driving through a Jewish section, you know, it was probably like the East Side.\nI mean, the exuberance of this country, after all the quiet and -- and -- and -- and the\ndesolation and the grieving and the mourning that I\u2019ve been subjected to for the last\nfour or five years, you know, that unconsciously I had absorbed. And now suddenly\nseeing all this life and this -- the -- the abundance is what -- what did it for me. I\nmean, I -- I saw oranges this big and people didn\u2019t pay -- I saw a woman eating an\nice cream cone. I hadn\u2019t seen an ice cream, I didn\u2019t even know what it looked like\nany more. And the thing I fell in love with was chewing gum. The driver of the carJanuary 4, 2002\nsays, would you like chewing gum? I couldn\u2019t understand what chewing gum was,\nbut he handed me this thing and he showed me and I chewed it and I loved it. And I\n-- it -- I -- and it was just wonder -- I mean, everything was exhilarating to me. I\ndidn\u2019t -- again, I didn\u2019t realize, you know, that this was the prologue to my life here.",
        "Q: So it was you and your brother in the car, and who else?",
        "A: Oh, and all the other children. It was like a van, like a station wagon, you know.\nWe were like in a big bus kind of thing, and they were taking us to this place where -\n- where there was like a little hospital, and it was really an orphanage, but a very\nhigh class orph -- very nice. And they kept us there until we could go with foster\nparents, til my foster parents could take me in Baltimore. You know, I came -- went\nto foster parents, my brother and I. You didn\u2019t know that? Yeah. So anyway, I -- th-\nthat\u2019s --",
        "Q: So you stayed in this -- this orphanage for how long?",
        "A: Oh, about two or three days. And then the m -- the -- the -- Mrs. --",
        "Q: What was the name of the orphanage, do you know?",
        "A: Mrs. Beser came from Baltimore, who came with the associated Jewish\ncharities. She was their liaison with all this and she came and got my brother and I.\nHer son was the nav -- navigator who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima,\nJacob Beser. Yeah, and he never recovered from that, which I can well understand.January 4, 2002\nAnyway, she came and she got us and on the trip to Baltimore -- I had no idea -- oh,\nin the meantime, my Uncle Heinz came and my Uncle Adolf, they couldn\u2019t take us\nfor some reason or other what had to do cause they weren\u2019t citizens themselves. And\nmy father\u2019s family came and wanted us and I decided not to, which was the biggest\nmistake I ever made in my life. I did not want to go with these people, I didn\u2019t know\nwho they were, I -- I --",
        "Q: They ga -- they all came to the orphanage?",
        "A: Yes, and -- which was sad because I should have gone with them. They were my\nfather\u2019s -- but my uncles didn\u2019t want me to go with them because they didn\u2019t think\nthey were high class enough. They were real German snobs and my poor father was\nPolish, so they never re -- they forgave him because he was so smart, but they could\nnot forgive these people. Anyway, it was a big mistake. Anyway, went to\nBaltimore, got another attack of my little rheumatic fever, which I didn't\nunderstand, and this time it -- it got better but it didn\u2019t stay better. I ended up going\nto Sinai Hospital in Baltimore. And I met my foster parents. They were probably\ngood people, but I think were doing it for the wrong reasons, they were doing it for\nfinancial reasons, with some compassion.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nJanuary 4, 2002\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Margitta Cooper. This is tape number three,\nside A. You have arrived in the United States and Mrs. Beser came and took y --\nand then you were told you were going to Baltimore?",
        "A: Mm-hm. And -- and I -- well, I became ill on the train again, you know, that --\nthat last -- I think it was like the last attack, that was like the third one. And again I\nkind of tried not to give into it because I was still very frightened, but it really kind\nof overwhelmed me and eventually I ended up going to Sinai Hospital. I s --",
        "Q: Thi-Thi-This is the train from New York to Baltimore?",
        "A: And then I -- I-I went to meet --",
        "Q: In -- in October 1941.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So you are 12 years old?",
        "A: Yeah. And what happened was I was ill. I met my -- I did -- I met my new foster\nparents that night, and as I said, part -- they had various reasons for doing it. I don\u2019t\nthink they were the right reasons and I don\u2019t think they were the right people for us.\nMy brother eventually went to another foster home, and so did I. But they were not,\nin any way, abusive. My foster father, unfortunately developed an affection for meJanuary 4, 2002\nwhich wasn\u2019t quite what it should have been. It wasn\u2019t paternal, let\u2019s put it that way.\nSo it was -- it was not a great experience for me, but it wasn\u2019t horrible either, I\nmean, nothing terrible happened to me, except that I did go to the hospital, I couldn\u2019t\nspeak English, I -- they were very concerned that they didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nknow exactly what was happening to me. I had a wonderful pediatrician who was\ntaking care of me. Her name was Lucille Liebolis, and she\u2019s very well known. And\n-- and I was at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore and a lot of young doctors came in and\ntried to speak to me and I couldn\u2019t really understand them. And finally a -- a rabbi\ncame in from Ohav Shalom and he was doctor -- oh God, he was a rabbi before,\nRabbi Shaw, I can\u2019t even remember his name, but he had come in and said he had\nmet my father in -- in -- in Germany, and he spoke to me in what was passable\nGerman, and so he finally explained to me what was happening to me and why I was\nthere, and what they were trying to do to me, because I wasn\u2019t sure what -- what\nthey were doing. Anyway, I stayed there for six weeks. After I came out of there --",
        "Q: Did your foster parents continually visit you?",
        "A: Once in awhile they did come, yes. Absolutely they came.",
        "Q: What about your brother?",
        "A: My brother did too. But -- but what happened in between 1s that the United\nStates went to war. And I remember all the brouhaha that was going around. I hadJanuary 4, 2002\nbecome friendly with the little girl next -- in the cubicle next to me who had had\npolio. And that was really horrible what they were doing to her because they were\nusing the kes -- Sister Kenny\u2019s system with the hot towels. Anyway, she and I\nbecame friends and my favorite occupation with her was singing, \u201cYou Are My\nSunshine.\u201d We sang it day and night, we drove everybody insane. But I heard all this\ngoing on and somebody explained to me and I was speaking a little English, that the\nUnited States was at war. And somebody came in and said to me in Yiddish, the\nUnited States, it is kreig, is at war, and he said -- I mean, I said, e -- yes? He said,\nwe are at war with Japan and Germany. And I couldn\u2019t understand that, I thought\neverybody was at war. I didn\u2019t realize the United States were not at war, I thought\nthe whole world was at -- that wasn\u2019t -- that was no big deal. Anyway, that\u2019s what\nhappened when I was in the hospital. I came out, I went to a convalescent center,\nSaint something in Catonsville in mary] -- in Baltimore, and --",
        "Q: Did you know Yiddish?",
        "A: No, but the words, the many words that are similar in a di -- you know, they are\nclose. I couldn\u2019t speak -- I only sp -- only spoke German, but there are people who\nspeak Yiddish who can make themselves understood very easily. Anyway, I went to\nthis Catholic convalescent home and I stayed there for another six weeks, altogether.\nThen they told me at that time, Dr. Liebolis told me I would never have children,January 4, 2002\nthat I had a very bad heart. I went to the William S. Baer School for crippled\nchildren with horrifically handicapped children, but very nice. I -- it was a very nice\nexperience for me. They were very nice to me. And I -- then after that I went to\nWestern High School. I sat for a scholarship to Barnard, but I met my husband --",
        "Q: Well, now wait a minute, you -- you -- so you went to live with your foster\nparents after you got out of this --",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yeah, yes -- oh yeah, I went back to them, but th --",
        "Q: What were the names of your foster parents?",
        "A: Snowhite, if -- if you can believe it. Jules and Ceil Snowhite. I know. Yeah, I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it either once I understood what the word meant. Anyway, I did go\nback to them and then I was transferred out from there to another foster family\ncalled Maniken, where I met my husband, because he had been their foster child,\ntoo. My husband --",
        "Q: Wa -- wa -- why -- why did you leave snow -- the Snowhites?",
        "A: Because Mrs. Beser, I think they all decided that it was not a good situation. She\nhad another child. They were a very young couple, and they had another baby and\nthey really had no room for me. I mean, once the baby came they needed the rooms.January 4, 2002\nMy brother had already gone by then to another foster family, the Kolectors, and I\nwent to the Manikens, and -- and my husband had come from Germany in 1938.\nThere were two brothers, Walter Grunberg -- my maiden name and my married\nname became the same. And I know, it\u2019s a -- yo-you\u2019ve got the weirdest interview\nhere e -- in history. And his brother Manfred had come. His brother Manfred had\nenlisted in the American army and was killed as a navigator, he was shot down over\nGermany. If that is not irony I cannot tell you what else would be. Anyway, Walter\nwas there. She had taken the boys in -- she took five German boys, German\nrefugees, Jewish children, in. My -- the two Grunberg brothers plus the three Mann\nbrothers. There were three brothers there. So there were five altogether. Well, they\nwere all gone by the time I got there, they were all either in the service -- the only\none that was left was Walter and I hated him and he hated me and we never got\nalong, until one day when I was about 17, he says, you doing anything? I said no. He\nsays, Ill take you to the movies, I said okay. So he went -- he took me to a movie\nwith his friend Frank. My date consisted of me trailing behind -- behind them,\nwhile they were talking to each other. They never looked at me, never talked to me.\nI remember the movie, was called \u201cThe Jolson Story\u201d with Al -- and I came -- then\nwhen -- what ha -- I don\u2019t know what happened -- oh, I know, we -- he says, you\nwant something to eat? I said yes. So we went to Nate\u2019s [indecipherable], which\nJanuary 4, 2002\nwas a very famous deli in Baltimore, and Frank says, I\u2019ve got to go. So, he left and\nWalter and I s -- began to speak to each other for the first time like human beings,\ninstead of snarling at each other all the time. And I really liked him. And he really\nliked me. He had been engaged before, didn\u2019t work out, and he was very handsome.\nHe is my children\u2019s father. And we started going out. Mrs. Maniken was outraged.\nNot for any sexual reasons. Not because she thought I was not going to be a -- you\nknow, that there was going to be anything pornographic going on under her roof, or\nanything obscene or that I was doing anything bad, no. Walter was very generous\nfinancially. He bought her lots of gifts, he had no obligations, he was working. So\nshe wasn\u2019t too happy about that. But he asked me to marry him, and I said yes, for\nall the wrong reasons.",
        "Q: How old were you then?",
        "A: I was going to be 18. I didn\u2019t deci -- I was not the -- which meant I was not going\nto go to college, I was going to be married. So --",
        "Q: And he was how old?",
        "A: Walter was 24. He was born in 1925, so he -- he was four years older than I was,\nso he was -- no, if I was -- he was about -- he was born in 1923, I\u2019m sorry, \u201923, I was\nborn in \u201929, he was six years older than I was, so he was about 24 then, almost 24. I\nwanted to be my own person. I wanted to be free. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t want to liveJanuary 4, 2002\nunder anybody\u2019s roof any more. I wanted to -- I -- you know. So I married Walter. I\ncared about him, he was a very nice -- he was a very decent man, and he always\nloved me til the day he died. I had my son about two years later, which was\nwonderful. Then I had my daughter four years after that, and then I wanted a\ndivorce, for no imaginable reason under the sun except I wa -- had met a\npsychiatrist. He promised me the earth and the moon and I thought, I don\u2019t want to\nstruggle any more, I want everything easy. I was very immature. That\u2019s where\nchildren who are -- have to grow up so quickly, in one aspect of their lives and have\nno chance to mature in the normal things -- I did not have the chance to be a child,\nha -- be a teenager. I never had the time to do any of those things. I was catapulted\nfrom one event to another. And adjusting to new people, adjusting to more new\npeople, adjusting to a school, learning a language. There is no excuse. I\u2019m not\nmaking any excuses for myself because that\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m saying it. \u2019'm\nsimply saying that behavior that is aberrant among people -- from people that have\ngone through a lot of trauma has -- there are explanations. You don\u2019t have to forgive\nit and you don\u2019t even have to put up with it, but you have to know that it\u2019s going to\nhappen. And it did happen with me. I was simply not prepared to be a mother. I was\n-- | love my children, I adore them. And my children, for some reason, think that I\nwalk on water. And I always tell them I don\u2019t understand that because I was reallyJanuary 4, 2002\ntempted to drown both of you at birth, you know? But the thing is that I have done\nthat with my children simply because I love them and respect them. But I was not a\ngreat mother, I was not a doting mother. I was totally self-absorbed, always. It took\nme years to understand that there was a world outside of me, my feelings, my anger,\nmy rage, what had happened to me. Not poor me kind of thing, I never felt that. I\nnever felt, oh, poor me. I always realized how lucky I was. But -- but the self-\nabsorption was unconscious. I didn\u2019t realize it. And so my marriage failed because\nof that. I then --",
        "Q: Ca-Can we back up a little bit?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When the war was over in 1945, you were 16 about --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- I guess. What was -- what did that mean to you?",
        "A: I wanted to find my parents and that\u2019s the first thing I did, I went to the Red\nCross. And they came back and said my parents had died, both. They gave me the\nnews that my parents were both dead, but they gave me the wrong dates. They told\nme my parents -- and for years I carried that burden -- they told me that my parents\nhad died in May of 1945, maybe 20 days before the war was over, which I fi --\nagain, found intolerable. If I had known they had died in the beginning of 19 -- in th\nJanuary 4, 2002\n-- in 1942, when there was no end to the war in sight, 1t wouldn\u2019t have been so\nhorrific, but for me to realize that, you know, they could have lived another 20 --\nwell, 1 -- that was a mistake, they had made the mistake. It was one of those things\nthat happened. But they told me that both my parents were dead. And --",
        "Q: What -- be-besides the timing of it, what were your reactions?",
        "A: Well, my reaction was -- it only fed into my rage and anger. I mean, it only fed\nby what was now, by now a full grown hate for -- for what happened to my parents,\nthe fact that -- that this was done to them, and a -- a -- that people -- I mean, I was\nangry at the United States. I found Jews in the United States are forg -- unforgiving\n-- | -- | wa -- I was unforgiving toward them. I felt that they were the smuggest, most\ncomplacent -- I attacked them viciously, I mean, with venom. I\u2019d say, don\u2019t you ever\ntalk to me about your friend Mr. Roosevelt. I said, don\u2019t you ever talk to me and\ncommiserate to me about what happened in Europe while you were all sitting here\ndoing absolutely nothing while your people were dying in concentration -- where\nwere your marches to Washington? I mean, I railed and ranted for years. And I\nreally made -- I mean, I have a lot of friends, and that they took this crap from me --\nI mean, I\u2019m talking about people like Elaine. I mean, they\u2019ve been my friends for\nover 50 years. They took it, and they absorbed m -- my anger and their guilt.\nBecause they didn\u2019t have anything -- it was their parents, they were youngJanuary 4, 2002\nthemselves, but I -- you know, I used to go on and on on my little soap box. Now I\nrealize, it\u2019s going on he -- I\u2019m sitting here, what am I doing for Israel? I\u2019m sending\nthem a few checks? Am I raving and ranting and railing and running to Washington\nsaying do something? No. For my people? No, I\u2019m just as complacent as these\npeople were. The wheel is round. My husband always said that and he is right. I\npersonally would like to see Mr. Arafat writhe in agony, but it ain\u2019t gonna happen.\nSo, I mean, it -- it -- life goes on. Anyway, I got married, I had my children, left my\nhusband, remarried again, disaster. Met my third husband who was the gem. He was\nwonderful, as Walter had been. And then I went to wor -- when I was married, after\nmy relationship with my psychiatrist broke up and oh -- and I realized it wasn\u2019t\ngoing to work, I went to work for the school of medicine, Johns Hopkins, which\nwas one of the highlights of my life. I went to work for A. McGee Harvey, who was\n-- who was chairman of the department of medicine, physician and chief of Johns\nHopkins Hospital and the editor of the Journal Medicine. And the McGee -- A.\nMcGee Harvey building is named after him at Johns Hopkins Hospital. And I went\nfor an interview, and I walk into this room, and this little man is sitting there behind\nthis absolutely cluttered desk in this rather -- rather unimpressive office. And I\nshook hands with him, I had wore kid gloves. I shook hands with him and sat down.\nI had failed the test that the employment agency had given me. There was a big red\nJanuary 4, 2002\nX right across th-the exam that she had sent out. And I saw it lying there and I figure\nwhy is he seeing me? So he -- we were chatting and he asked me about everything\nand I said -- to everything he asked me I said no, cause I didn\u2019t know. So then I went\nhome. I get this call from this man, this personnel director of the Hopkins and he\nsays, Mrs. Grunberg? I said yes. He says, welcome to Johns Hopkins. I said, you\nmean he -- they hired me? He said yes. I said, who is that little man? I said, who 1s\nthis Dr. Harvey? Well, there was dead silence like my asking do you know who\npresident -- who the president is. He says, that is Dr. A. McGee Harvey, very, very\ncoldly. He says, he is physician and chief of this hospital and chairman of the\ndepartment of medicine, and professor of medicine. He 1s the -- the professor or\nmedicine. I said oh. I said, I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t tell me that beforehand because I\nwould have fainted right there on the spot. Years later -- oh, when I walked in there\nwas another man sitting in a corner, his name was Kenneth Zeiler. Ken Zeiler is\none of the geniuses of all time, he was chief of endocrinology. Years later I said to\nKen, why did ha -- Mark hire me? He says, you walked in, you shook hands, you\nsat down, you looked like a lady and you spoke English. I said, not well. He said but\nyou -- he says, believe me, you did. It was -- you know, and then the other thing that\nwas funny about Ken, I saw him maybe 10 years ago, I said, Ken, I said, you know\nyou were always one of my most favorite people. He was also a full professor. He\nJanuary 4, 2002\nsays, did you know I was in love with you? I said, what? He says, I loved you for\nyears. I said, Ken, you are married. He says, I know. I says, there was never -- he\nsays, you never knew, he says, you never realized, he says, but I always loved you. I\nsaid, you are joining that long list. Anyway, that was wonderful, he trained me to be\na redactor, you know, and -- and -- with manus -- for manuscripts. He put me on the\ninternship committee, on the residency committee, I was in charge of the Lilienthal\nlibrary. I mean, he really trained me and gave me wonderful, wonderful time. And\nthen my husband said to me, it\u2019s time for you not -- I\u2019d like you to stop working. He\nsaid, you don\u2019t need to financially -- but the mean -- in the meantime my mother\u2019s\nbrother died, my Uncle Heinz, and left me money, which was very nice of him. And\nhe left it to my brother and my cousin and I, and he was very well-to-do, he was rich\nman. And he -- we split it three ways. And -- and my husband was comfortable, so I\ndidn\u2019t -- but I -- I said, okay. We joined the cumtr -- country club. I became like an\nadult camp -- you know, we\u2019re going shopping today, we\u2019re playing bridge today,\nwe\u2019re doing mahjong today. The skirts are too long, the skirts are too short, they\u2019 re\nwearing boots, they\u2019re not wearing boots. Finally got to the point I was going to lose\nmy mind. I said to my husband, I have to go do something. So I called Ira Morris, a\nfriend of mine, a doctor at Hopkin -- from Hopkins, who had formed a medical\ngroup down in east Baltimore, which is a very poor area. And he was doing the --\nJanuary 4, 2002\nnot an HMO, but similar to that, but poor, for the poor. And that\u2019s where I met\nEllen. Wonderful day, 1976. She was the -- there was A-Annabelle Scher, Richard\nScher -- do you know Annabelle and Richard Scher? He does news, he was the\nanchor and Annabelle was there, Ellen was there, and I went to work for Ira. Ira is\nher dear friend and my dear friend and he\u2019s the one she talks to now all the time\nabout this. I called up Ira, I said, Ira, I need to do something. He says, what do you\nwant to do, darling? He called me the countess. He says, Countess, what do you\nwant to do? I said, I want to work a couple days a week. So he said okay. So we\nwent -- I went to work in east Baltimore, which was run by the state and fu -- really\nfunded by the state, for really the -- the -- the -- you know, really people who on\nMedicaid, you know. And Ellen was sort of there the psychologist cum whatever.\nAnd -- and that\u2019s how I met her and sh -- it was wonderful. I mean, it was a\nwonderful job, I loved it. I worked there for like two, three days a week. And of\ncourse I kind of became the -- like, you know, I became the administrator, I became\nthe hot honcho. And that fell apart. Ira and the state and Senator Douglas from the\nstate of Maryland parted company. Not -- not -- not the -- not -- the state senator.\nAnd he formed the east -- the central [indecipherable] medical group and I went\nwith him, uh-huh, and stayed there for about another 10 - 12 years. Ellen did not\ncome with that, Ellen then, when the whole thing fell apart, it was a very ugly scene,January 4, 2002\nwith a lot of newspapers and I was interviewed again, do -- you know, the whole\nthing. Anyway, I went to work for him and then my husband died. That was tr-\ntremendous trauma for me. He died in 1980, and that was very hard. I f -- think that\nwhen you lose a mate, and I\u2019m not pontificating, I don\u2019t think anybody whose never\n-- whose -- until you\u2019ve been there, it is probably the singlest greatest loss that you\ncan experience. Even -- I think even in situations where the marriage hasn\u2019t been\nthat steadfast. And people, you know, always say that, but they don\u2019t understand\nwhy a person who\u2019s lived with somebody for 30 years and has never had a nice\nword to say about him all of a sudden is wailing and -- and weeping all over place.\nWell, I'll tell you why they do. I understand. It\u2019s because that person 1s no longer\nthere, it has become an attachment. It\u2019s like somebody severing a part of you. And\nthat is why suddenly this person becomes saint -- saintly. Well, I happen to have\nliked my husband, so it was really, really hard. And --",
        "Q: Do you think it was harder because you had lost your parents?",
        "A: Oh, I think so, I think it\u2019s -- a loss for me has always been difficult. And it -- \u2019m\nbasically -- the thing I discovered about myself, which is the final result of all that\nhas happened to me, is that underneath all the bravado, and underneath all this -- this\n-- this -- that my friends and my children to this day believe that I am the strongest\nperson they know. I mean, they admire that -- that underneath all that I am the mostJanuary 4, 2002\nfearful, insecure, quivering mass of jelly you have ever seen. And they don\u2019t\nunderstand that. I am terrified of everything. And that came much later. That did not\ncome when I was young. When I was young I had that audacity. I decided to leave a\nhusband with two children. I had the guts to do all that. The -- th-the -- the -- the\nthing came as I began to understand and as I began to take my life apart and look at\nit. If I had kept it set in concrete the way it was, without ever chiseling away at that -\n- that -- that -- that -- that thing that I encased everything into. If I hadn\u2019t broken that\nthing apart to look at it, what was in there, if I kept it encapsulated, I wouldn\u2019t be so\nfearful. But I think in doing that I unleashed, literally, the fear that -- and -- and --\nand -- and -- and the terror that I experienced as a child, that I was -- that I just\nburied, and -- and closed up and -- and -- and -- until it became hardened. And that\u2019s\nwhat -- that\u2019s what I did. I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not sorry I did it because in a way it set me\nfree in other areas. I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not so consumed by anger any more and I don\u2019t\ntend to be as judgmental as I used to be. You know, I -- I used to be very critical of\npeople. When they talked about the war I looked at them with the utmost superiority\nand say, well you don\u2019t even know what it is, you know? But now I don\u2019t -- but now\nI do know. I think they -- I do know what that is that they felt during the war. It may\nnot have been of the -- the -- the -- the epic proportions that we did, who were there,\nJanuary 4, 2002\nover there, but certainly they suffered, too.

        "A: Oh yeah, I think so. I think there were times when I would watch my children,\nand I would think about it. I would -- I remember when -- when -- when Bonnie, I\nthink was like -- when I took Bonnie to school the first time, more so than Mark,\nbecause Mark went to school happily. I mean, he would -- he -- he ran away from\nme to get into class. But Bonnie -- when Bonnie -- I took Bonnie to school and I\nsaw her walk away for the -- for one moment I felt the anguish that my mother must\nhave felt, that I thought about it, I said, my God, she\u2019s only going away for four\nhours.

If there\u2019s a -- an attack, how will I ever get home. And I tr -- I was\ntrying to give instructions to my children what they should do. Don\u2019t leave. I will\nget to you.

I always told them that\ny -- what -- when you see anything done by state -- by a state, if you see a lynching,\nor if you hear a cross being burned on a lawn, that\u2019s one thing. That\u2019s a terrible and\nugly thing, but if you ever hear -- if you ever see this government pass a law, by\nstate, by state, that affects you, you get out.

        "Q: What are your thoughts about ger -- Germany today, do you feel very German\u2019?\nDo you still feel German?",
        "A: Not at all. I feel absolutely American. My loyalties are totally to this country. I\nnever think about myself as a German, ever, ever. It\u2019s interesting -- not because I\ndeliberately did this, it was just a gradual progress. It was -- I never thought of\nmyself any more as German, I always thought of myself as Jewish. And by Jewish I\nhave tried to explain to my children, who are not religious, but are a -- very Jewish, I\nalways tell them that Jew -- being a Jew is not a religion. It is only partly that. Being\nJewish is -- is a State of mind. It is an -- a -- a -- a very -- it is a part of you, it\u2019s an\nattachment of you. It\u2019s something you cannot erase, it is just a fact. I said, you are a\nJew. It is genetic. It\u2019s almost like a genetic code, it is there. It is the 5,000 years of\nhistory. And -- and I think myself as a -- an American and as a Jew.

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Margitta Cooper. This is tape three, side B, and\nyou were talking about your feelings of being a Jew.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s one thing the Germans did for me is that they made me very\nconscious of Judaism and being a Jew. I think the fact that they hated -- hated Jews\nso much, and were -- I mean, the whole idea that they were -- that they wanted only\none thing, which was to kill all of us, to eradicate us completely, I think reinforced,\nin me at least, and I think in most Holocaust survivors, especially those who really\nsurvived the Holocaust in these -- in the camps, that they -- that -- that part of them\nre -- th -- I think the -- th-the -- the main thrust now is that they are Jewish. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean that they necessarily practice it, but their awareness of it, o-of being a\nJew. You s -- you asked me how I felt about Germany now, retrospectively? I feel\nthat Germany, tomorrow morning under Hitler, another Hitler could do the same\nthing. That has never changed in my -- my opinion has never changed that. The -- as\nI said before, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re unique in that. I think they have a parclivity --\nproclivity to do that, maybe a little faster, because once you\u2019ve committed murder,\nthe second time it makes it easier. I think their denials don\u2019t in any way impress me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nI think they\u2019re fully capable of relighting the ovens and doing it all over again. I\u2019m\nnot being bitter, I\u2019m simply saying what I believe. Hopefully their governments will\nnever permit that, because I think ultimately it 1s not the people who direct those\nactivities, it is the government that does it. And people, a -- the people respond to\nthat, to the government\u2019s edicts. Germany had behaved in an exemplary fashion in\nthe last 20 years. Their government has been democratic. The fr -- much more so\nthan the French do -- as far as I\u2019m concerned, the French were as rotten, in their own\nway, as the Germans were. I think ger -- France\u2019s conduct toward Jews during the\nsecond war is atrocious. The fact that they had a camp like -- camp like Gurs right\nin the middle of their country without protest, is outrageous. The fact that they\ntransported people by the hundreds of thousands across their country to these horror\nis -- 1S -- 1S an indictment against them. They\u2019ve never accepted their guilt. Only\nlately I think I\u2019m supposed to be getting 25,000 francs from them for transporting\nmy parents to Auschwitz. So I mean, the whole European -- the -- all of Europe --\nthe ur -- Austrians, for example, we -- you know, we talk about the Austrians and\nthe anschluss. The Austrians were no better than the Germans. I mean, all of\nEurope was corrupted by Hitler, but basically underneath it all, 1t could never have\nhappened, Hitler could have never achieved what he did if underneath it all wasn\u2019t\nthis enormous wave of anti-Semitism that was allowed to spread and to be acted on.\nJanuary 4, 2002\nThat is the calamity of the -- of -- of the second World War and the Jews; it is the\nfact that the Austrians, the Germans, the French, all the rest were allowed -- not only\nallowed but encouraged, to act on festering anti-Semitism that had been there for a\nvery, very long time. It didn\u2019t happen in 1933, it was there. It was simply allowed to\ncome to the surface full force and to be acted on in any way anybody saw fit.\nThere\u2019s a lot of anti-Semitism in this country. It is suppressed, it is never allowed to\nbe acted on. If it was suddenly allowed to be fr -- to -- to free flow, without any reins\nor checks, I don\u2019t know what would happen here.",
        "Q: What do you think are the roots of that anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Well, Christianity, of course. I think when you have -- when you ha -- are the\nchild of a father, and I\u2019m talking about now Judaism versus Christianity, and the\nfather does not accept the child, in this case meaning Christ, that is an enormous slap\nin the face. Christians simply cannot understand why Jews do not accept Christ as a\ngodhead. That\u2019s the number one cause. And for hundreds of years there was this\nmyth promulgated that they -- that we killed, we the Jews killed this child, that\u2019s\nnumber one, this chi -- this godhead. Number two, the Jews have always been in\nprofessions that have been very much -- not necessarily in the professions, they have\nbeen the shopkeepers, where money has always been exchanged. They have been --\nthey were the ones who were sent out by the Poles and the Russians to collect taxes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nThey became the hated people who collected taxes. They had to collect them\nbecause their Christian bosses told them to go out. I think they -- and the fact that\nJews have had one philosophy, that is to educate, to educate and to educate. And\nthey have also done something else that we do, most societies don\u2019t do and we don\u2019t\ndo any more either, which is sad, is that they took the best and the brightest and they\nmarried their best and their brightest off to their best and brightest girls, and they\ngave them the education and those who were a little slower and not quite as bright\nwere put in the corner and say okay, be a good boy because your brother is the smart\none, he\u2019s got to learn. We did that, so we had -- we had genetically, probably,\nthrough hundreds of years had developed a group of people who were very bright,\naggressive, and because of our -- because of our -- the nature of our -- of our status\nin other countries, we\u2019ve become aggressive. We have -- we -- we -- we -- we feel\nthat we have to act in order to achieve. We have to push and shove in order to get\nanywhere, even when we don\u2019t have to. And I think there is a lot of resentment\nabout that. It\u2019s the same resentment that Americans begin to feel about Asians,\nbecause they\u2019re thrusting themselves into the forefront of education, of everything,\nand it\u2019s beg -- an-and it\u2019s -- and now the rest of Americans are beginning to resent\nthem. You always resent that. Anti-Semitism is a very, very old and sad story.",

        "Q: How many synagogues were there in Speyer, just the one?",
        "A: One, yeah. Well, there may have been little ones, but that was the big one, that\nwas the main one. And would I go back? I think yes. My friend Lenore went back\nto Berlin, they actually paid for her to come, and -- she says otherwise she wouldn\u2019t\nhave gone. She says, I would have gone someplace else, but not there. But look, life\nis -- life is -- 1s -- is -- is a survival.

But underneath it\nall, I think when you start scratching the surface there are this -- there are this --\nthere are things that make us, that set us apart. I never want that, you know, I think\nI\u2019ve s -- I think I strove very hard not to be a different -- I wanted to be a normalJanuary 4, 2002\nteenager. I wanted to be a normal wife and mother. I made very sure I dressed the\nsame, I acted the same, I -- I was very much the young American wife, you know. I\nthink it\u2019s obvi -- very, very important to me that I should not be any different. I\ndidn\u2019t want my children to feel that they had a mother who was, you know, a\nsurvivor. I mean the -- I-I never talked about it. I think -- and I always felt\nuncomfortable with the way people look at survivors. I mean, even I look at them --\nI mean, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not one of them. Oh, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that, where were you?\nOh, in Gurs? Must have been terrible, tell me all about it, you know? I mean, that\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019m saying, I never wanted to be like them. I never wanted -- I mean, I couldn\u2019t\n-- | -- if I\u2019d had the number, I would have never shown anybody the number. It took\nme years to understand that it wasn\u2019t my fault, I was not to blame for this. I didn't\nhave to assume the guilt for this. I felt guilty, so I didn\u2019t want anybody to know, or\nto remind me. I -- in some way being different may -- I felt guilty because I was\ndifferent. I felt guilty because it had happened to me and that -- I don\u2019t know how to\nexplain. It\u2019s like a child that gets beaten by a parent and they assume the guilt for the\nparent like they had done something wro -- well, I felt that maybe something had --\nwe had done something. This is what I said about anti-Semitism. What did we do\nthat we deserved this? We didn\u2019t do anything. My parents did nothing. Gunter\u2019s\nparents did nothing. I mean, my friends -- they -- we -- there was nothing that anyJanuary 4, 2002\nJew did that deserved them to end up as bones in a gas chamber. Nothing that they\ncould have done deserved this. And I think that the smugness of even some\nAmerican Jews when they say, well, you should have fought, you know, f-fight,\nfight what? It came like a bolt out of the blue. These were people living normal\nlives. My father did not keep an Uzi under his bed. And he was a non-violent man\nand he could never have de -- done anything. Yes, now, 50 years after the fact, you\nhave an Israeli army, and you do have men livin -- men and women in this country\nwho would not tolerate that being done to them.

I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember her because I think I blocked out\nthat thing.

I didn't want that. I wanted to be like them. I envied\nthem. I envied them being -- going -- I remember I used to -- I always had friends. I\nremember being envious of going to my girlfriend\u2019s house after school and having --\nwe used to have cookies or milk, or I had a friend who loved tomato soup. She\nwould open up cans of tomato soup for me, surely, and I would sit there and have\ntomato soup. And her mother would come in and she\u2019d bend down, she\u2019d kiss her.\nAnd she always patted me on the head, she always liked me. And say, girls, what\nelse do you want?

But -- and -- and again, it took me\nyears to understand, that as sad as that was -- and it was sad, it was sad for a little\ngirl not to have a mother and father.

Weeping, sitting there with a shoe in his hand, trying to put\nhis shoe on and weeping because he knew at that moment that his life and my\nmother\u2019s life and probably my grandmother\u2019s and his children\u2019s lives were over,\ndone with, they were going to die. He knew it, because he had fought so hard to get\nus out and he wouldn\u2019t have done that if he had thought we would live. I can never\n106\nJanuary 4, 2002\nforget my grandmother\u2019s face. She had these magnificent big blue eyes, she was a\nbeautiful woman. Like, she looked -- she didn't look like my mother, but they were\nboth beautiful, really beautiful. Unusually pretty women. The way she looked when\nshe looked around, she said, wh-where\u2019s the bed? And my mother\u2019s tears when she\nrealized that her mother -- she thought her mother had had a stroke. I mean, -- and\non this horrible train. And the men banging, the soldiers banging on the window,\nsaying give us your jewelry or you\u2019re going to die. I mean, those things were real,\nand my sticking them somewhere there wasn\u2019t going to -- wasn\u2019t going to help me\nor my children. I finally sat my children down and said these are the facts of life,\nthis is what you need to know, this is what really happened. I want you to\nunderstand it. I\u2019m not saying -- telling you this cause I want -- expect you to feel\nsorry for your mother, because your mother is one of the lucky ones and I\u2019ve had a\ngood life. But I want you to understand what happened to your grandparents. And I\ndid, I told them everything. And then when I got all this crap together for -- for the --\nFrance, I -- I did, I got hysterical. I was at Bonnie\u2019s house in Florida and she was\nXeroxing and she was looking at something and I looked at it and it was a transport\nlist. And I did, I just lost it. I lost it at Vad Yashe -- Yad Vashem --",
        "Q: Yad Vashem.\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: Yeah, in -- in Israel. But, for the most part it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine with it now. But I\nhad to deal with it and I think that the Holocaust -- I -- I admire those people who\nsurvived. I admired what they achieved. I look at a man -- ooh -- I look at a man like\nWiesel, who is, I think the classic exponent of what human beings can survive and\nmake of themselves. And I listened to some of the -- and I\u2019ve listened to others, and\nI think to myself, they\u2019re so much braver than I was, because they faced it, and they\ndealt with it. I didn\u2019t. I just pretended it never happened. I made up a fantasy about\nthe whole thing. You know, okay I went to Gurs, it wasn\u2019t really bad. I had to leave\nmy parents, but it was all right. You know, I went si -- to Marjelier, that was okay,\ntoo. We were in Marseilles, we were afraid of being arrested. I had rheumatic fever,\nfine. Pll survive that, too. I mean, those are things -- I went to a hospital, couldn't\nspeak a word of English, they were doing things to me I didn\u2019t understand. I mean,\nthose things are things you need to deal with. You can\u2019t just blithely say them and\nthink they\u2019re going to go away, they\u2019re not. They have -- they affect you. And I\nthink that\u2019s what happened to me, I finally through the years learned to deal with it.\nPretty well.",
        "Q: Are there any sights today, or sounds, or smells that trigger memories? You --\nyou -- you gave one of when you took your child to nurser -- to kindergarten andJanuary 4, 2002\nyou had to say goodbye and you thought of your mother. Are there any other things\nthat you see in the world around you, or hear, that also triggers memories?",
        "A: Lots of things. Well, as I said, when I smell Gruyere cheese, it always reminds\nme of that trip. Dishwater. Dirty dishwater reminds me of Gurs because the soup\nsmelled strange, and I\u2019d smelled a little bit like th -- like cabbage-y. I think when I\nsee pictures of -- of -- there was a film with -- which I never an -- I never watch\nanything that has to do with the concentration camps ever, and I have not seen\n\u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d I do not -- I have not been to the Holocaust Museum, I haven\u2019t -\n- the only place I ever went to was Yad Vashem and that was very hard for me. But\nI think it\u2019s time for me to get over that a little bit. There\u2019s certain thing, it -- like, I\nsaw a movie with Vanessa Redgrave where she was playing the violin. Well, we\nhad -- we had a young woman who had like a flute with her in Gurs, and she would\nplay occasionally. So when I hear those plaintive sounds, it reminds me. You n --\nyou never forget. Whenever I see pictures of France, you know -- I don\u2019t know\nwhere it was, I think couple years ago they were talking about the Pyrenees, and I --\nI was right there. I mean, I saw it all ag -- all over again.",
        "Q: Have you been back to that part of France?",
        "A: I\u2019ve never been back to France. But I mean, those are things that -- that remind\nme. When I see pictures um -- the second World war, when I see, for example, someJanuary 4, 2002\nold movies that are mi -- that reminds me when I came over here and -- and gila --\n\u201cCasablanca\u201d for example, I st -- you know -- I mean there are a lot -- Lisbon,\nwhen somebody talks about Lisbon, I\u2019m back, you know, when -- with the bread\nand baskets. Yes, I think there are always memories. There are always certain smells\nthat suddenly you are transported back. I cannot look at a Bing cherry, that --\nwithout thinking of when Hilda, who was -- used to take care of us, my brother and\nI, during the summer, and she used to get the Bing cherries with the -- the thing and\nmake earrings for me. And I-I remember that all the time. I -- when I see old movies\nthat have th -- I mean, \u201cTarzan,\u201d I loved that book, I read that in concentration\ncamp. \u201cAn Old Fashioned Girl\u201d by Louisa May Alcott, I read that. Those are\nthings I\u2019ll always remember, you know, that I don\u2019t know, it -- it -- it -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nunexpected, I mean, you don\u2019t look for it, it\u2019s -- just happens and -- and it\u2019s there. I\nmean, you don\u2019t look for those memories, they just happened. And I think scent is a\nvery pow -- provocative kind of memory. The thing I -- my mother\u2019s birthday and\nmy father\u2019s, I always, you know, think about them. I sometimes can\u2019t believe -- I\nstill can\u2019t believe that -- that -- one of the -- I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve heard this so many\ntimes, that I ha -- one of the things that I have never been able to grasp -- I\nunderstand it intellectually, but emotionally, how an -- bo -- how c-could I ever be\nthat angry, or that full of hate that I could take women and put them on a cattle carJanuary 4, 2002\nand let those people walk into an oven to die? Into a chamber to die? Could -- how\ncould that have happened? I mean, that\u2019s -- those are moot questions, they\u2019 ve been\nasked a million times. How did it happen and why\u2019d it happen. But I sometimes\nthink to myself, I was there, I saw these people. I understand that after awhile they\nlose their humanity. You do -- no longer look at them as human beings. They\u2019ve lost\nit. | mean, they\u2019ve become gray and dirty and with matter hair and they are no\nlonger these attractive people that maybe you saw the first time. After awhile they\nbec -- they shuffle, they don\u2019t walk any more, they have become vacant looking,\nthey have no expression in their eyes. But even so, can you do that? Can you tell\nsomebody -- send somebody to their death? Those are the questions I\u2019ve had about\nall this applica -- for th-these last 50 years. How can we -- how could that have\nhappened? How could it have happened to somebody like my mother, who was such\nan immaculate woman, to end her life that way? You know? Who was brought up\ncarefully by her own mother, and cherished? And yet, ended -- and had to die in that\nway, for what reason? An-And I -- I -- as I said, I became an agnostic when I was\n14, but not because of that. I must tell you, I never decided there was no God\nbecause -- and I still have not decided that because nobody can prove one way or the\nother. The only reason -- it\u2019s not because of my own rage, that had nothing to do\nwith it. It just seemed scientifically and logically impossible to me. I mean, it\u2019s like,January 4, 2002\nwhat did I hear, y-yesterday, somebody saying I can\u2019t really believe that people\naround there flapping with their win -- wings, there are just too many of them. But, I\nmean, I became agnostic because I -- I c -- I couldn\u2019t accept the reality of a -- a -- an\norganized religion that, you know, of a God. I mean, I just -- not because how could\nhe have done -- had that happen. That is the -- that is the cry of -- of -- of grief and\nmourning, how could you let that happen to us, we are your chosen people. I always\nfelt that we would have been a lot better off if He\u2019d chosen the Chinese, but you\nknow, but the thing is, that isn\u2019t why I decided. And of course, underneath it all I\u2019m\njust as much of a coward as anybody else and I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m wrong.",

        "Q: -- Hebrew school training?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, and again, they chose -- if they ch -- they choose not to be\nreligious, but they\u2019re very, very conscious, as I said earlier, of being Jewish and the\nobligation that being a Jew means. I mean, I told them, I said, it is not the religion. I\nsaid, I don\u2019t care if you do not go to shul, or to Temple, I said, but I care very, very\nmuch if you ever lose your identity as a Jew. That is your first identity, a second\nidentity is that you are an American Jew. And I think that\u2019s a big difference. You\nknow, I am a Jew. I may not be religious, but I am a Jew all the way, and nobody -- I\nmean, that would be the first thing I would ever tell anybody, I am a Jew, and I\u2019m an\nAmerican. So I think there is, as I said, I think being Jewish is being like a\nstatehood, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very special thing to me. And I think\nthat I got from my father, because my father was a very bright man and also a\nphilosopher. I mean, he had a philosophy. He believed that -- he believed that -- that\nreligion brings with it other things. Pride in who you are, in your traditions, in the --\nin your -- in the knowledge, in what the -- the contributions that your -- your people\nhave made.

        "A: Well, my father was an avid -- my father was an avid reader, like I am. That\u2019s\none thing he and I shared. And the thing was that he also had enormous interest in\npeople, and he was very well liked. There was a -- there was a man, I don\u2019t know y -\n- are you interested in classical music? Okay, there was a man that used to be on\nevery Saturday night, cannot think of his name, I have his letter home, who used to c\n-- do a program on classical music, what was his name? Cliff? Anyway, he was\nfrom Speyer and he was on PBS every Saturday for an hour or two hours and I\nwrote him a letter once and he wrote me a letter back and he says, your father\ntrained me for my Bar Mitzvah. I mean, this is a very famous man, he came from\nNew York, I think he\u2019s dead now. Anyway, he says, your father was very nice, he\nsaid, but your mother was a lot prettier and I had a crush on her. But my father -- the\nonly thing he -- my father ever did for me -- to me that I didn\u2019t like is he made me\nplay the violin instead of the piano. But he always used to say to me, what you have\nin your mind is gold, because nobody can take it from you. He said, and for every\nword you learn, he says, you will get smarter, more intelligent. And I said, what do\nJanuary 4, 2002\nyou mean? He said well, he says, if you learn a new word today, he said, that means\nyou know that word and you will become more intelligent. He says, it\u2019Il help you.\nAnd it took me years to understand that. Then of course, then I read John Milton,\nand John Milton had said the same thing, vocabulary is a power. So I -- I -- that --\nyou know, he was just -- I miss not have known -- I miss not having known him as\nan adult, because as a child you hold -- talk to your parent in a different way than I\nwould have, let\u2019s say if he had -- if I had gotten to know him as an adult and he and I\ncould have shared adult thoughts. And that I never had the chance to do.",
        "Q: What was your brother\u2019s Bar Mitzvah like in 1942?",
        "A: Well, my uncle came -- my uncles -- my whole family -- I mean, the family came\nfrom Germany -- I mean, from New York, God. And his foster parents gave it to\nhim -- well, at that time we were still with Snowhites, so sh -- they gave it. And of\ncourse, it was really nice. We -- he was -- a Bar Mitzvah at an -- an Orthodox\nsynagogue. There was a party for him. He was shorter than I was at that time, then\nhe grew to be six feet tall. And he was very excited, he did very well. And the thing\nI remember, he wore this navy blue suit, you know, how little boys dress for -- and\nhe was reading the Haftorah and he really did very well, and I think -- and I\nremember my f -- my -- m-my uncle looked at me -- and I\u2019m sure he wa -- I mean,\nwe were all thinking about my father, I mean, that he\u2019s -- could not be there, I mean,\n115\nJanuary 4, 2002\nhe would have trained his own son, you know, for the Bar Mitzvah himself -- that\nhe couldn\u2019t be there. But I have to tell you, my Uncle Heinz came to my son\u2019s Bar\nMitzvah, too. And when my son stood up to go -- you know, to -- to -- and I -- they\ncalled his father and I up to the Bima. And I remember, of course, I remember what\nI wore. I wore a suit about the color of Jacqueline Kennedy\u2019s, which she wore to\nTexas, that color pink, and I wore a big hat. I really looked great that day. And I\nlooked very young. I mean, you know, everybody thought I looked like I was 20.\nAnd we -- I stood up there with him, and when I looked down the tears were rolling\ndown my uncle\u2019s face. And I said to him afterwards, I said, Uncle Heinz, I said,\nwhy were you crying? He says, I thought of how you -- your father would have\nloved the way your son looked, you have a beautiful son, and how you looked. I\nsaid, I know. Well, I remember my Tante Betty, she was a cousin of my mother\u2019s,\nwe were walking down the aisle when I was getting married to -- to Walter. I wore\npale blue slipper satin, it was a beautiful gown, and my Uncle Heinz paid for all that\ntoo. He was, as I said, rich. Anyway, I didn\u2019t know how rich he was then. I wish I\nhad. Anyway -- anyway, I\u2019m walking down the aisle and of course everybody -- I\ndon\u2019t have to tell you, I\u2019m walking down the aisle with my uncle, and of course\neverybody in -- it was down at the Luxemburger Temple in -- in New York, and\neverybody knew, oh poor Margaret, poor little orphan, poor little thing, you know,\nJanuary 4, 2002\nand I knew it and I held my head up very high. And my Aunt Margaret had given\neverybody orders to control themselves, you know. Except my Tante Betty. As I am\nwalking down the aisle I hear this shriek. [indecipherable] I thought to myself,\nstupid woman. And -- you know, she was always very melodramatic. I lost two\ncrowns and I feel very self-conscious -- at -- and I didn\u2019t lose them, thank God, I\nmean the two -- four crowns, actually, the whole thing came out yesterday. Four\nthousand dollars if I\u2019d lost them. Anyway, yeah, she as shrieking at the wedding,\nand my -- Walter turned around to me afterwards -- and I remember thinking my\nknees were shaking so much, I was so nervous, you know, and I remember Walter\ndidn\u2019t want to laugh, because he heard it, this Margitt. Anyway, so I -- aft -- so I --\nthat part, you know, I\u2019m -- it\u2019s sad that my father never had a chance to see his\ngrandchildren or even his son, or my mother. Now, when I was little, I went upstairs\nonce to the attic. We had a huge house, it was three stories. There, Gail, believe it or\nnot, was a chest, a hope chest that was yay high, maybe two and a half feet high and\nmaybe 70 inches across. In that hope chest were sheets, beautiful, lace embroidered\nsheets with my initial on it and a space for where my husband\u2019s would go. Towels.\nEverything ever was so gorgeous I couldn\u2019t wait to get married. I never wanted to be\nmarried, but I thought this it beautif -- and now I -- you know, I used to think -- that\nwas another thing that used to piss me, excuse me. Who got my sheets? Who was\n117January 4, 2002\nusing M.G. with a little space for the husband? AII these things. My mother\u2019s\nsterling silver. All her bu -- beautiful things gone. You know, these were material\nthings, I mean, they don\u2019t make up for a life. But when you -- but it -- she had to\nthink about that. I mean, I -- I would be thinking -- h-how -- what did she think\nabout in the concentration camp? What did she think when she went -- got to\nAuschwitz? What were 1 -- ow -- I mean, if there is an afterlife. Those are the\nquestions I have. What did they feel like? What did they think once my brother and I\nwere gone? What did they think when they saw us on that train going to -- you\nknow, these little children, all these little children hanging out of the train, you\nknow, and looking bewildered. And so many of them were -- you know. How did\nthat mother feel who let her little seven year old go -- six or seven year old child go,\nyou know, and she was alone. She was alone, she had no husband. But I would -- I --\nI thought about that. I think about it, what if my father\u2019s -- if he was dying -- if he\nhad died of a heart attack and didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s one thing. But suppose he wa --\nhad been dying -- suppose he died -- suppose these people died, they knew they\nwere dying, the men, or the women, and they were leaving their mate behind to face\nsomething dreadful alone. At least if they had each other, there was some support.\nYou were not alone in your fear, but if you had -- if you were a husband and you\nwere dying and you were leaving your wife alone to face whatever there was comingJanuary 4, 2002\n-- and I think by now they knew about Auschwitz. They had to know, they had to\nknow that the camp was being emptied out. Where were all these people going?\nThey were not going home. So they knew they were going someplace terrible.",

Look, I had a t\n-- | had a doctor once, and -- who became very famous, his name was Edgar\nBerman. He wa -- became a famous surgeon, he took my tonsils out when I was 16\nyears old, and he was doing something with my -- on my boob, I thought it was part\nof the exam. It wasn\u2019t until I was married that I understood that this is not part of an\nexam. But he was doing it, talking to me the whole time, never paid any attention,\nyou know? And so I mean, wi -- girls, you know, I -- we don\u2019t -- that -- that didn\u2019t\nupset me at all because I thought it was -- I had been examined so much in my life\nand I had so much blood taken and so many EKGs taken and so much stuff, that I\njust thought it was something new for the tonsillectomy, that 1t was part of that. And\nit took me, when I was married, about three fo -- I never told Walter about that one.\nI told him enough abou -- but I, you know, I think most young women have an\nunfortunate experience somewhere along in their lives before they are married, that\nsomebody tries something. So it is nothing unusual, nothing exceptional happened to\nme. It was not a rape, it was nothing brutal like that. It was just a guy who was, IJanuary 4, 2002\nthink maybe not -- I wouldn\u2019t call -- certainly would not have called him a\npedophile. I just think he was -- I was a young woman growing into maturity and\nthat wa -- and I was in his house, probably, you know, running around in -- in a slip\nwithout thinking. I don\u2019t know. Again, we tend to blame ourselves, there\u2019s no\nexcuse for his behavior. But that\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: Do you get reparations?",
        "A: No. I never knew I could. No, because first of all, I didn\u2019t have loss of -- I didn\u2019t\nhave loss of work. The Germans -- the French are now paying for the loss of my par\n-- mother going to Auschwitz, they\u2019re willing to do that. As I said, they\u2019re giving\n80,000 francs, which I haven\u2019t gotten yet. My brother did, but I haven\u2019t yet.",
        "Q: What -- what about your father, the loss of your father, they don\u2019t --",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no, why would they do that? They pay for nothing. There are no\nreparations from Germany. Germany only did it for property, and I got something\nfor my house years and years ago. Probably I mishandled that -- my brother and I\ndid. But, you know, the thing is, they -- they did pay reparations, are you ready for\nthis, to Israel -- to these -- to Israel, is they sent Mercedes-Benz, mer -- that -- I\ncould never understand that, why did they do that? As -- as an atonement for what\nthey did?",
        "Q: Do you feel totally assimilated now?January 4, 2002",
        "A: In this country? Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, I have absolutely nothing left\nthat -- of -- to -- of Europe at all. I mean, as I said before, I\u2019ve all -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve\nconsidered myself an American from the get-go. The thing I feel bad about are the\nfact that my children have never had a family, that they\u2019ve never had grandparents,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Wh-When they were younger and you hadn\u2019t told them the whole story, what did\nyou say to them when -- about not having grandparents? How did you present it to\nthem, before you told them?",
        "A: I told them that their grandparents were dead on Daddy\u2019s and Mommy\u2019s side.\nBoth of them died in ur -- both died in Europe. And then as they got older I told\nthem that both their p -- all four of their grandparents died in concentration camps --\nWalter\u2019s did, too. So, I said, this is what happened, and then they began to\nunderstand. I mean, you know, they un -- my children are unusual in the sense they\nhad four grandparents die in a concentration camp. Walter\u2019s parents died too, and\nso did mine.",
        "Q: Have you been back to Europe at all?",
        "A: I\u2019ve never gone back to Europe. When I stood dramatically with arms stretched\nout like Rose in the Titanic saying, I\u2019m leaving, remember this moment, I meant tt.\nI was not going to come back. But I\u2019m ready now. Again, you know, it ta -- it took\nJanuary 4, 2002\nme -- I\u2019m a little slow. But I told the children that I\u2019d be willing to go back to\nGermany and see, and go back to France, you know, and see something. And I\u2019d\nlike them to see th -- first of all, from a thetic point of view, it\u2019s the -- it\u2019s a beautiful\ncountry and there\u2019s no reason for them not to see it, you know. And thank God they\ndon\u2019t have those memories. They\u2019re gonna look at it -- they may look at it with\nsome sorrow for me, but certainly from their point of view, it -- it -- wa -- wa --\nthere\u2019s no -- there\u2019s noth -- no anguish there for them, you know? I mean, they don\u2019t\nknow th -- they never knew their grandparents, so it\u2019s fine. I want them to see it. It\u2019s\n-- yeah, go ahead.",
        "Q: What -- this is some time ago, but what were your thoughts during the Eichmann\ntrial?",
        "A: That they couldn\u2019t hang him high enough. I mean, my feelings for mist -- well,\nthe thing that impressed me about Eichmann is number one, the way they got him.\nAnd my fervent regret that they never got Mengele. But I also felt that he represents\nto me what I said again earlier, that Germany, under the right kind of Fuhrer could\nabsolutely revert right back to 1932 without any question, because Eichmann was\ntotally, totally unremorseful. He was -- did not regret one thing that he did. The only\nthing he regretted is that he was caught. He had -- he -- he felt absolutely justified in\nwhat he did, which is the -- the horror of the whole thing, is -- 1s what I's -- wa --\nJanuary 4, 2002\nyou know, how can you do this to another human being, I asked? Well, Eichmann\nthought that was absolutely justified. That is what\u2019s so terrifying. Not that these\npeople did things that were aga -- went against the grain. These people did things\nthat they felt were for the greater good of -- for all. This was for the greater good of\nGermany. They were doing by the -- the -- the -- the -- the ends justified the means\n-- or the means justified the ends, whatever. The point was that they felt what they\nhad done was the thing to do. And that\u2019s what\u2019s frightening. When people do things\nthat go against them, somewhere they begin to break down. Somewhere their\nconscience begins to catch up with them, but not if you really believe you\u2019re doing\nthe right thing. Then you just go on. And Eichmann sat in that chair in frozen, like\nglacial calm, because he was right and they -- his -- th-the people, his accusers, were\nwrong. He was convinced of that. And he went to his death believing it. So Iam\nconvinced that if tomorrow morning a new regime -- I mean, look what the Germans\nhave continued doing to the Turks. I mean, whatever their doing to their -- to\nforeigners, it 1s there. That absolute belief that somewhere along the way, they have\nachieved some kind of superiority. And that everybody else is really just a notch\nbeneath them.",
        "Q: Will you -- do you buy German products?\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: No. No, and my daughter bought a Porsche. It was a very dramatic day. She said,\nI saw this little car. And I said oh, is that darling, is that adorable. It was in\nMassachusetts. She\u2019s a very successful woman. So she says hop in, Ill give you a\nride. So we drive gila -- Gloucester, which is a lovely fishing town in mas -- loved\nit. And it was a very teeming, raining day and I\u2019m -- I -- I mean, every time we went\nby this, water would wash over the whole car, it was -- and I jump out and she says,\nyou like it, Mother? I said, it -- I\u2019m telling you Bonnie, it\u2019s adorable. I said, what\nkind is it? She said, oh, she says, it\u2019s like a little sports coupe. And of course, you\nknow your child, right? I said, Bonnie, what little sports coupe? She said, Mother,\nshe said, now don\u2019t get excited. I said, I\u2019m not excited. She says, you\u2019re gonna be. I\nsaid no I\u2019m not, I said, tell me. She says, it\u2019s a Porsche. I said, a Porsche? You\nbought a -- I said, I guess next you\u2019ll be buying Braun. She says, Braun, a\ncoffeemaker? I said, oh, you already got one. It was a nice car. She sold it. No, I\nwon\u2019t buy it. I -- y-you know, which 1s really st -- you know, 1-it -- a -- 1-it -- o-\noutside of -- inside of me goes this constant battle. Am I being really rationable, and\n-- and -- and normal, and -- not -- or stupid? I mean, what am I -- what -- what am I\nachieving? Braun does not miss me. The Porsche company will produce cars,\nBMW is booming and the Volkswagen is back in full swing. So what -- what does\nmy boycotting have to do with anything? Is it just a matter of principle, or is it just --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n128January 4, 2002\nam I being absolutely wrong in doing this? Those are the questions. I know people\nthat -- that did not survive anything, who are American born, who will not buy a\nGerman product, because -- out of respect for those who went before. And they\nwon\u2019t do it. And yet, I know that there are s -- Holocaust survivors, who are wearing\nthe German watches, buying the German cameras, driving the German cars. They\ndon\u2019t think it\u2019s anything wro -- so, it\u2019s fine, whatever you want to do, you know. I\nhave never bou -- I\u2019ve never had the need to buy it, but I am going to buy the Braun\ntoothpa -- brush, because you know, being what is known as common sense wise,\nit\u2019s a very good toothbrush.",
        "Q: On that note, is there anything else you wa --",
        "A: No, I think [inaudible]",
        "Q: -- you want to add to what you said today, any other thoughts?",
        "A: Well, the only other -- I don\u2019t have another thought besides Braun. The thing I\nthink that I would like -- if anyone ever listens to this ramble, the only thing I would\nlike them to n -- remember is that vigilance -- and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to hear this\non every tape that is in -- in this museum, that vigilance is something that Jews and\nall people need. That human beings need to take care of each other, respect each\nother. I\u2019m not asking them to love each other, because that\u2019s really hard to do, but at\nleast have respect and trust. If we have a sense of trust of each other, even if -- when\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nthere\u2019s betrayal, and there is bound to be betrayal between peoples, but if there 1s\nsufficient trust left, we can survive. We can\u2019t survive without it. And I think this 1s\nthe most difficult lessons for man to learn and he hasn\u2019t learned it yet, we haven\u2019t\nlearned it. We have not learned it in this year of 2002, we are -- you know, the -- let\nme end up on a note ma -- of a man much wiser than I will ever be. Thucydides\nwrote a book called \u201cThe Peloponnesian Wars.\u201d And the book was written, I\nwould say, 1500 to 2000 B.C.. And he opens the book -- and I\u2019m paraphrasing\nbecause I\u2019m not as clever as Thucydides. He said, we are once again engaged in a\ngreat war, because we have not learned from the past. This man wrote this 4,000\nyears ago. And we begin the year 2002, once again engaged in great wars all over\nthis globe. We haven\u2019t learned anything. And I think if my experience and those\nwho came before me and those who will come after me, will teach anyone, it\u2019s that\nwe heed to learn to trust each other and to know something about justice and\ndecency toward each other. That\u2019s all I can say.",

        "Answer: Including maiden a -- Margitta Granberg Grunberg Cooper.",
        "A: I was born June the 10\", 1929 in Speyer, Germany.",
        "A: My father was one of the religious leaders in the town, he was also the cantor\ncum rabbi. He was born in Poland. My mother was a -- a young woman who\nmarried -- in her day, who could -- never had a career, of course, she married from\nher mother\u2019s house, married my father. He had been married before, he was a young\nwidower, as a matter of fact, when she married him. She -- how they met I never\nknew because there was some romantic story that she had gone to visit a friend and\nhe met her and he fell in love with her. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s about it.\nProbably a blind date. Anyway, they married, they had one child, who died. My\nsister died when she was 10 years old, which was a devastating event for my\nJanuary 4, 2002\nparents. And, as a matter of fact, if it had not been for the death of my sister, I\nprobably -- my brother and I would not have been born -- we were twins. So in\nconsidering my father and his philosophy, he -- it had to be somewhat ironic for him\nto have lost a child and then have twins born. At any rate, that\u2019s how we arrived, and\nI think we had a n -- very nice life, a very nice home. Stable. I mean, I felt no\nanxiety or fear, at least not until I was about five years old, when it became more\ndifficult to be a Jew in Germany and | think that\u2019s an old story. And the children, I\nthink, more than the adults, began to react to my brother and I as Jews, even though\nthere were still children who were not Jewish, Christian children who would play\nwith us, because there was a park in front of our home. I had Jewish friends. I was a\nchild that had -- my brother and I -- more m-me, because my brother was very well\nbehaved. I always had the feeling that I had to be very well behaved. I was a special\nchild because of my father and certain conduct was expected of me, so that was\ndifficult. It was a very religious home. My father was a relig -- 1-1-in -- in the sense\nthat it was strictly Orthodox. My mother was, I think -- I don\u2019t know how sh --\nexactly what her beliefs were, but certainly she -- she upheld whatever my father\nwanted to do in a -- in -- in the marriage. She was a very nervous woman because of\nmy sister\u2019s death. I think that was a terrible trauma for her. So when I think of what\nultimately happened to my mother, it\u2019s unbearable to think that this woman who had\nJanuary 4, 2002\n-- ended up her life the way it eventually did. And that I find probably the most\nunforgivable thing about this whole situation that happened in Germany. And let\nme say now, at the outset, that what happened in Germany, while it was unique in\nthe history of the world, notwithstanding great sieges, great battles and great\nsuffering among other peoples of the world, I have come to the conclusions after\nmany, many years of thinking about it, that whatever happened in Germany could\nhappen anyplace, given certain economic and cultural events, and that it is singularly\ninappropriate for -- for people to be smug and say well, you know, this is -- these are\nthe people that were able to do it. I think all peoples are capable of doing it.",

        "A: My -- my sister\u2019s name was Margot and she was absolutely exquisite, I have a\npicture of her. She was angelic. Not only because she died, because people become\nangelic after they\u2019re dead, but from -- everybody said that she was just a sweet and\ngentle child. And her death not only devastated my parents, but I think my mother\u2019s\nbrothers, her uncles and my -- my grandmother, and I think that -- she was really\nbeautiful.

        "A: Diphtheria. She was fine.

She was only 10 years\nold. So I think that\u2019s precisely what happened, although, you know, it was so long\nago, I mean, was 1928, so it\u2019s difficult to -- but they did bring back the body from\nSwitzerland -- it had to be a -- a frightful event for my parents.

        "A: Not really. I would have thought it was more -- it was not a big -- I mean Speyer\nis -- 1S -- it was a fairly well known city, it had a very famous cathedral and it had\nthe Speyer Diet..there was something with Luther that was there, too. I think it was\nmore toward the outskirts. It was a very residential area and there were lots of Jews\nliving in that area. There were some Christians too, but they would have been across\nthe park. And there was a beautiful church not too far from us and then there were a\ncluster of homes there, too, that I think belonged to Christian families. But where I\nlived, our neighbors were Jewish. The interesting thing was that maybe 20 yards\nfrom us, around the corner, was what is known as a -- it was like, not barracks for\nsoldiers, but like a building that housed soldiers. You know, army soldiers, not SS or\nNazi. And that was very -- that was strange, because 1-it -- right in -- in this area they\nhad what is called a -- a -- I don\u2019t remember what it was called in Germany -- in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nGerman, but they had soldiers living there, training, being trained there.

And then there were various assorted\nsecond cousins. My mother -- my grandmother was widowed when she was like, in\nher late 20\u2019s, from -- you know. And -- but she had a brother who came to this\ncountry as a young man. Now, I have family that live in Wichita, Kansas, too.

That was the final choice, nobody really wanted me. But I -- it\ndidn\u2019t bother me because I-I loved it, even though I was so bad at it.

        "A: Oh yes, I had always Christian friends. As a matter of fact, I got a letter not too\nlong ago from one of them, and I should -- I se -- I\u20191l send you -- and she goes to my\nsister\u2019s grave and she makes sure that it\u2019s still taken care of. So I mean, she -- yeah,\nI did, and I loved them. And they still played with me. I mean, some of -- some -- I\nmean, my mother, for example, sent me to a convent to learn how to knit and\nembroider because she and her -- my grandmother threw up their hands, they\ncouldn\u2019t do it. And they sent me to the nuns, and I learned how to knit and I learned\nhow to embroider. I had a nun there who would sit there and tell me wonderful\nstories. And it was fine. I was a Jewish child. I was the child of a -- a -- Dr.\nGreenberg and nobody ever thought about it. I also had a laundress who came -- we\nhad a laundress who brought laundry back -- back and forth every week. I went to\nher house, I had ham sandwiches, and I -- my father found out, he was a little\nexcited, but I was never very good. So, I mean I -- those are the kind of things you\nsaid how I got in trouble. I knew I shouldn\u2019t during Passover eat bread, let aloneJanuary 4, 2002\ncold cuts. So I mean, that\u2019s the kind of troubles I was always in. But it was, as I said,\nfine. I mean, I loved it. I would go with my -- I would go to the nuns and they would\nteach me. So there was a lot of interaction between a non-Jewish community and our\nfamily.",

But I liked Rosh\nHashanah, I loved Yom Kippur, because I was allowed to eat lunch, and then I loved\nbreaking fast, because they used to make something called Pergelfleisch. I don\u2019t\nknow if you know what that is. It\u2019s -- it sounds horrific, it\u2019s called pickled beef, but\nit is the most wonderful thing in the world, nobody\u2019s ever makes it, nobody knows\nhow to make it in this country. And I looked forward to that and having bread and I\nlike the -- I like Saturday night dinners, except Swiss cheese. My father once said to\nme why -- why do you -- Margit, why do you hate Swiss?

        "A: No, no they didn\u2019t. All I know is that, for an example I was walking down the\nstreet one day when I was about maybe seven. I think it was -- began really when I\nwas seven, and they were throwing stones at my brother and I, and they were yelling\ndirty Jew and -- and he -- he was hurt, I mean, they hit him. And when he -- we\ncame home, that\u2019s when my father and my mother said we couldn\u2019t play any more\nand we couldn\u2019t go to the school any more. So I was about seven or eight when it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nreally, really, really began. And the German soldiers themselves began to change.\nTheir attitude became -- there was so much hostility now. There was a different,\nthere was a -- a break, and there was fear. Kristallnacht was when I was nine years\nold already. It had begun way before then. Not as terrible as it was after\nKristallnacht, but there was a change. There was no longer the comfort level.",

        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I -- it was, but again, 1t was much worse after Kristallnacht.\nAfter Kristallnacht it became flagrant. And then -- let me say that at the time, you a\n-- also -- after -- even after Kristallnacht, there were still people who did not, in any\nway, react to us in a negative way, who became overtly anti-Semitic. The people\nwho were really anti-Semitic were always anti-Semitic. Now the children were the\nsurprise. The children who became so -- who became, you know, really taunted us\nand began -- made life so difficult for us. Those are the ones -- the mu -- most of theJanuary 4, 2002\nu -- most of the Christians ignored it, ignored us. They might not have been friendly,\nbut they were not overtly -- they were not overtly cruel or anything. It was the\nchildren more than anything else, and some of the teachers.",

And then they picked up stones and it\nbecame physical. They hit me, and I ran. I think they may -- I may have fallen and\nscraped my knee. They hit my brother and of course, you know, he bled. And after\nthat we were not allowed to go to school any more, my mother said no, we were not\ngoing to go. And we never went anywhere -- anywhere without having somebody\nalong, or traveling in -- more than two. It was a terrible thing.

        "A: Yeah, it happened before Kristallnacht. Maybe -- I\u2019m trying to think, was it\nbefore? No, I think it happened after. There were things that were happening before,\nbut after Kristallnacht it all came together. It became a -- it became now a\ngovernment directed persecution and I think it became -- and -- and -- and now the\nrhetoric was geared up so high. I mean, you know, we -- we -- the -- the -- the -- the\n-- the vendetta against Jew -- Jews, and the fine -- resolution became now a par -- a -\n-a--a--anaim, a political aim. And it became -- and I think -- you give people\nenough propaganda and you tell them and you repeat something enough, even they\nwa -- they want to believe it. If they have any dis -- I mean, today in this country, if\nyou have a minority that somebody dislikes, if you give them enough power and\njustification to react to that minority, they will do it. And Hitler gave people the\nright to do it. He gave those children the right to hurt us.

        "A: They themselves didn\u2019t know how -- what to do. My father only knew one thing,\nthat we had to leave, that it was done, that we had to go. That -- but he couldn\u2019t, he\ncould not get out. They -- he was refused the visas, he was considered a political\nprisoner and he couldn -- but he knew. I mean, he urged my cousins, he urged my\nuncles, he urged everybody to go, they all left. They all went. They went. He knew\nthat there was no survival.",
        "A: He left -- immediately after he came back from Dachau, when they had arrested\nhim aft -- at Kristallnacht they arrested him. He came back six weeks later, he did\neverything in his power -- I think he had done it before, but not with the kind of\nurgency that he felt then.",
        "A: No, that continued. And I'll tell you something else that was interesting. One of\nthe priests tried to -- wa -- on -- during Kristallnacht woke him up to tell him the\nsynagogue was burning, they ran down and saved the Torah. I mean, you know ya --\nI mean, the -- 1-in all -- in the midst of absolute evil -- and I use that word in its true\nsense, there are people who took an interest. I remember walking with my mother\nwhile my father was in the -- in Dachau and I met one of my nuns. I had -- was noJanuary 4, 2002\nlonger going there, you know, because I think it was difficult for them, they couldn\u2019t\n-- | mean, anybody who had anything to do with a Jew was at risk. So I remember\nshe bent down, she kissed me, and I had this overwhelming feeling of sadness,\nbecause sh-she ha -- the tear rolled down her cheek. So I mean she -- they all -- we\nall knew, I mean everybody knew that we were condemned. Nobody knew about the\nconcentration camps yet. My father knew Dachau existed and Buchenwald existed,\nbut nobody understood what the ultimate plan was. I mean, nobody could -- would\nhave believed it, except that my father knew that the ultimate plan was to kill\neverybody, and he wanted his family out. Now, I think my mother -- and this is\nsomething I\u2019m not sure about, but I do believe from what I remember as a child, that\nmy mother could have left, and she refused. She stayed with my father. So I -- you\nknow, I think she could have gone with her brothers, because they were leaving, and\nmy grandmother could have gone too, and they chose not to go, they chose to stay.",
        "A: Probably. But for some reason she wanted -- she didn\u2019t do it. She didn\u2019t. She\ncondemned herself, effectively, to death, and probably us too, although I don\u2019t think\nshe really believed they would kill us. I don\u2019t think any mother believes that her\nchildren are going to be killed. But I think she could have gone. And that -- for\nknowing my mother as I know her, it -- as I remember her, it -- it -- she was such aJanuary 4, 2002\ndelicate, as I said, nervous woman, for her to have made that decision had to take\nenormous courage. I mean, for her to know that she was going to stay in this horrible\nplace where, you know, when everybody else was starting to go, you know, I think it\nhad to take enormous strength. I don\u2019t know if I could have done it. I don\u2019t know if I\nwouldn\u2019t have said, I -- I\u2019m sorry, I -- I\u2019m taking my children, I\u2019m running. I think it\ntakes a very strange love, belief, confidence in your mate, or not being willing to\nleave him, you know, to -- to face it by himself. I -- I -- he -- she did that. I think that\n-- that -- that\u2019s one of the remarkable things about her.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: I think it was probably one of the major traumas in my life. First of all there was\nthe burning of the synagogue, which while I -- I must say, being a little brat, as I\nsaid, or a child, for one glorious moment I said, oh thank God, I don\u2019t have to go.\nBut then I -- then even -- e-even I understood that this was not a good thing. But\nthen they came to arrest my father.January 4, 2002",
        "A: I heard the banging on the doors, and I heard them -- my father going downstairs\nand we -- the maid and my mother and I heard -- I knew it was the priest. And my\nfather ran out of the house.",
        "A: Yes. And then when he came back at five o\u2019clock that morning, I heard again, a\nlot of noise, and I ran downstairs and I -- I mean, I don\u2019t think they had gone to\nsleep, I mean, nobody did. I mean, my father was still dressed, and he had burned\nhis hand, and I think he had -- was wearing like a bandage on it. And the SS had\ncome in and they were arresting him. And my mother -- this is -- and my mother was\nhysterical, everybody was hysterical and I started to become hysterical because I\ndidn\u2019t understand. I must say the SS again, this is the contradiction in human beings,\nwhen they saw me and my brother, they tried to reassure me. They said, itll be all\nright, your father will be all right. And of course they were very polite. I mean, there\nwas nothing of the sturm and drung kind of thing that you see in the movies. They\nwere very calm, very icy, very -- you know, waited for him to get hi -- you know,\nput his coat on and everything, and he was arrested. Now, once that happened my\nmother did everything to get him out, once we found out where he was, how -- the\nJanuary 4, 2002\npolice kind of told her where he was, or somebody told her. My grandmother and\nmy uncle all tried everything. And I'll tell you a story that sounds like something out\nof a movie. My mother took -- told me to get dressed one afternoon, and I -- were t -\n- |-I was dressed, and she took me by the hand, and she had her pocketbook, and in\nher -- and er -- and she was holding a little chamois bag. And I\u2019Il never forget the --\nand I remembered what she wore. She wore a -- she had a magnificent blue coat\nwith a blue fox collar and she wore that coat with a matching blue dress. And we\nwent to the police, and we sat outside and waited, and I had no idea and for once I\nwas very quiet. And then she -- they told her to come in and we sat in front of this\nman and he wore a black uniform with the SS -- I mean, the swastika on his arm.\nAnd my mother said to -- they were talking and then she opened this little bag and\nshe too -- put all her jewelry on the desk and she said, you may have it all. She said,\nI would like you to have it, she says, if you can get me -- if my husband come home.\nAnd I'll never forget what this man said, he looked at -- my mother was a very\npretty woman, and he too-took her -- the jewelry and he put it back in the bag and he\nhanded it to her -- of course it was all gone eventually anyway. And he says, I\ncannot take it, he says, but I will -- and I ca -- he says, I will try to do what I can. So\nwe went home, and about three days later I heard footsteps coming down the street\ntoward our house, I knew it was my father. I knew it. I woke up the whole\nJanuary 4, 2002\nhousehold. I start screaming, I said, Papa\u2019s home, Papi\u2019s home. And everybody says\nno, no, no. My mother says, what? I said, he\u2019s coming. And sure enough, the door\nrang -- there was a knock on the door, we all flew, and there was my father. He had\ntaken -- he -- as he left the camp, he had given his jacket, his overcoat, everything he\nhad to the prisoners that were left, that would never come home. And he had a white\n-- he wore his white shirt, he was very thin. My -- my -- my mother, of course, wept.\nWe put him into -- he went to bed and I remember during the morning -- this was\nvery early in the morning, was maybe 5:30 - six o\u2019clock in the morning -- everything\nin Germany happens either in the middle of the night or early in the morning. That\nseemed to be their best time, you know, like the vampires, you know, do well at\nnight. Anyway, I remember tiptoeing into his room to make sure that he was there,\nyou know? And I remember he looked at me, he says, Margit? And I said yes. I\nsaid, are you all right? He says yes. Of course he wasn\u2019t, because he knew. You see,\nmy father then knew that ultimately it was all downhill from then. I mean, you\nknow, the school, everything had stopped, the tutors came. They were -- the families\nwere trying to get out. Of course, the families that ended up going to Gerthe with\nus, stayed. They did not get out. And I still -- of course, and there were still a lot of\npeople who really believed that this was some kind of nightmare, that something\nwas going to happen. But then the united -- I mean, England went to war.\nJanuary 4, 2002",

        "A: He said it was very bad. He says there were a lot of people there. He said there\nwere a lot of young men there. And he also said that that time that they were not\ngetting out, that these were people that -- I don\u2019t think they had gas chambers then,\nbut these were really prisoners -- not all Jews. I don\u2019t think they were all Jews. But\nhe said the conditions were horrific. There was hunger. Of course he was so thin\nwhen he came home. There was already hunger, there was already a lack of food,\nthere was lack of warmth, it was very, very cold. That\u2019s why he left all his clothing,\nas much as he could. The conditions were very bad and obviously he knew, he\nsensed that they were gearing up for something very big. And he also found out that\nDachau was just one camp. There was also Buchenwald then. And he was --\nBelsen-Belsen wasn\u2019t there yet. But he was -- he knew. He had heard from what --\nhe -- he told my uncle, who had come to visit him right before he left -- he left for --\nfor -- for the United States.

The\nnight that my father was arrested, that day my mother was so panicked that she\npacked us up and took us to cousins in Mannheim. She thought that -- she -- she --\nshe just was so frightened and probably went there to figure out what they could do\nfor -- for my father. We stayed there, I\u2019d say almost a week. And I remember I cried\nthat night, I got like hysterical, I don\u2019t know why.

I think it was also by bus, but we got to this place which was a sea of mud\nwith barracks. They separated the men and the women. The women had the children.",

But my father also said we are together. And -- and that was -- I think\nreassuring. I was not afraid. Now, I think maybe -- I\u2019m not sure, in retrospect,\nwhether the reason I wasn\u2019t afraid is because even though I always thought through\nthese last four -- three or four years that it had no affect, it did affect me and that I\nhad become very -- not stoic, maybe but dis -- disaffected, or disas -- you know, and\nno longer associative with a -- you know, a -- a -- a -- lacking affect, in other words.\nThat maybe in some way I had detached myself, so that I was really looking at it\nnow from -- from -- from a perspective that had nothing to do with me. I was there.\nSo maybe that\u2019s really more the truth than anything else. At any rate, I was not\nafraid. I didn\u2019t know, and I wasn\u2019t afraid of death, and I certainly never thought of\nanybody harming me. When we got to Gurs and I saw the sea of mud, I knew. TheJanuary 4, 2002\nwomen, once they were separated from their men, fell apart. And this little dictator,\nmeaning me, and all the other children -- oh, the German soldiers then said, get the\nwomen organized. To us. To us children. So that we were marching up and down\nthese long barracks where these women were huddled, didn\u2019t know what -- I said,\nget yourselves organized. I said to my mother, sit there with Omar. And my mother,\nwho would have probably had a shrieking fit having been told by her 10 year old\ndaughter how to behave, right, did exactly what we told -- and we were so drunk\nwith power, these kids, we were like, you know \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d? I mean, we\nwere telling everybody what to do. There was no place to lie down, there was no\nplace to do anything, I mean, it was barracks. Long barracks with nothing.\nEventually they gave us these pallets, you know, to lie -- sit on, to lie on, but there\nwas nothing then. And then they did come with the pallets and they handed them\nout. And every family, every mother and her child had like a little -- ha-have you\nbeen to -- in barracks? You know, you can put stuff under the little eaves, you\nknow? Well, that\u2019s where they put their possessions and that\u2019s where we were, it\nwas very cold, damp, and very muddy.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And a sea of mud. I mean, that\u2019s the one thing I remember about --\nno, this was in October of 19 -- was it --\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: Yeah. This was a sea of mud. I mean, you could not step anywhere. And the --\nand the -- and of course the mu -- the m -- wives were terrified, the mothers were\nterrified because they no longer were with their husbands. And they went out on\ntheir own wi -- among these strangers with these soldiers. And --",
        "A: Yeah, we said goodbye, and I knew he was going to be down the road from us.\nThey did tell us that they, you know, the men were going to be in one section and\nthe women were going to be in another section. But it -- but can you imagine leaving\nyour home and suddenly being transported for 24 hours or whatever time it took,\nand 1 -- and then put into a strange place in a barracks? I mean, and having\nabsolutely nobody to tell you anything, nobody to explain to you what was\nhappening to you? I mean, f -- Americans -- I mean, I -- I sometimes think to\nmyself, what would happen if tomorrow morning this happened in this country,\npeople suddenly vanished? I mean, you no longer saw anybody that had lived in that\nhouse for umpteen years and was suddenly gone.

And where you could wash. The\ncamp had originally been established for Spanish prisoners and had been emptied\nafter the Spanish Civil War.

I mean, there was -- even the 1m -- the -- even\nthe abnormal atmosphere of being in these barracks became a normality after\nawhile, so when you walk in and you sense another change, you know something\nhas happened, and I knew something had happened because I saw -- I did not see\nBecky.\nJanuary 4, 2002",

And\nmy mother said shhh. And I said -- well, that was not the thing to say to me, so --\nunfortunately, so I said, where is Becky? And she says, Margit, I\u2019m going to hit\nyou. Be still. Now that -- when that happened, I said, did she go away, and I said --\nmy mother said yes, she went away. And I was glad, I was happy, I thought she had\ngotten away. It took me -- yet, I knew. I wanted to believe she had gotten away, but I\nm -- sensed there was something wrong. And then there was the little girl, beautiful\nlittle girl who became ill, she was about maybe three years old, and she died. And I\nremember th -- the mother screaming in this makeshift hospital they had there, they\nhad like a makeshift infirmary, that her body was still warm. She was screaming at\nmy father, saying, she\u2019s still warm. And I remember my mother was dissolved in\nsobs, I mean, she was hyster -- well, first of all, to see this mother lose her child,\nwell it had to bring back that same trauma for her, plus the fact that there was\nnothing to be done.

So my father told them -- and he told me this -\n- that he had two children, they were both going to leave, or neither will leave. He\nsaid, I\u2019m not letting my son go and my daughter is to stay here.

        "A: Yes, yes, and it was a big place that had become a center for -- that somehow had\nbeen given over by -- by the French, I assume, to take care of these children until\nthey could be dispersed into different -- to different places. Now, this was not\noccupied France at the time. S -- what happened was, as -- as -- I was there only a\nfew months and what happened wa -- is that as we left, other children would come.\nNow, were these children -- how many of these children were from Gurs? I think\nmost of them came from Gurs. I don\u2019t think they came from ger -- I think -- I -- I\u2019m\nnot sure what other places they could have been coming from. I mean, they were not\ncoming from the German concentration camps. I don\u2019t know where else they could\nhave been coming fr -- to -- to Marjelier from, because Gurs was really -- there\nwas only Gurs.",
        "A: I think so. I think that\u2019s who did it, yes. And I think they -- they were some -- the\nUnited States I think did offer to take X number of children. I think that\u2019s how they\n-- you know, I think they -- it was sort of sponsored, an international kind of thing.\nHow it came to be, I don\u2019t know. Certainly when I got there it was already\nestablished. I mean, we were not the first arrivals, there were children there.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: No, there was no contact at all. As I said, the only time I saw them again was at\nthe end, when we left the country.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: The thing -- you know, as I s -- the thing that was so strange is that I really felt all\nright about it. I -- I -- I think maybe I thought this was just like a temporary thing.\nAnd the other thing was that I had become -- | -- I think I -- what had happened is\nthat I had become really disaffected. I did not realize it, but I think I kind of had\nbecome like numb. I didn\u2019t think about my parents except in the expectation that I\nwould see them, that this was a temporary situation and that they would eventually\nbe coming. I didn't think beyond that. I would hear little conversations between theJanuary 4, 2002\nteachers that would make me -- that would frighten me. For an example, they were\ntalking about what was happening to some of the children, children that had physical\nhandicaps. And -- and that\u2019s, of course, what happened with Becky -- that they were\ndoing things. They were very frightened and very uneasy, even about being in\nMarjelier. They were afraid of the Germans coming. The Germans had occupied, of\ncourse, a part of France, Vichy, France and I would hear little things, that they\nwere always very conscious of being at risk or in danger in some way. And that\nmade me nervous. And yet I thought, well, I\u2019m -- we here. So if I\u2019m here, and\nHenry and Heinz are here, then my parents can\u2019t be that far behind. So it didn\u2019t\nfrighten me. I didn't begin to understand that they were not coming until I saw them\nin Po. And then I knew that they were not going to be coming with us to America,\nthat we were going by ourselves. But until then, when the train stopped and I saw\nthe parents, I thought well, this is it, you know, we\u2019re -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re coming\nback. We\u2019re going now. We\u2019re going to America.",
        "A: Yes.\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: They had classes in history, we took some math, we -- but it was all in French, so\nI mean, you know, I -- an-and they taught us how to speak French, of course, and\nchildren learn fast. And of course there were books, which was wonderful.",
        "A: They gave us clothing, absolutely, we had no clothing. They gave us clothing, as\nI said, they asked us to do -- we did work in the ki -- we kept our own rooms up, I\nmean the beds -- I mean, there was like a dorm. We made our own beds, we -- we\ncleaned. I, like an idiot one day thought it\u2019d be fun to help scrub the floors. That\ntaught me never to volunteer again. And -- and we worked outside and then la -- on\nthe -- on the -- in the gardens and grew our own vegetables, and it was -- it was -- it\nwas an absolutely work place. I mean, you know, the children were not pampered.\nBut it -- they -- it saved their lives.",
        "A: Yeah, there was enough food, it was not good. Lots and lots of lentils. I\nremember we were loaded with lentils, lots of legumes, n -- very little meat. Some\nmilk, some bread. Not -- not what you call haute cuisine. I mean, it was an --\nsufficient for us to survive on. There was very little fresh food, I mean, no oranges\nand things like that. Sometimes -- I have always wondered what the neighborhood\nthought, you know, what the neighbors must have thought of this place and all theseJanuary 4, 2002\nchildren, though Ill -- although it was pretty isolated, I mean, there were not too\nmany neighboring houses there.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think we ever did. I don\u2019t think we ever really left. There were places for\nus to roam around and to play in, but we never made visits into a-any neighboring\ntowns, until we left. Until finally we had to go and we headed for Marseilles. But --\nand -- you know, on the train. But it was -- it -- it -- 1t -- the children, again, were\nvery well behaved. I think all the children knew there was -- this was not normal.\nYou know, that we were going through am -- I mean, when you think of children,\nranging from the age, let\u2019s say, of six, seven, to maybe 12 - 13, all strangers to each\nother, suddenly being thrust into a situation where they never saw their parents,\nnever heard from their parents, having to exist in this way and having absolutely no -\n- no knowledge of what was to become of them. Except for me, I was positive I was\ngoing to America. My father had said so and I was going. But the rest of them\ndidn\u2019t know. Everybody wanted to go. That was, you know, one of the most\ntriumphant things was was one of the children came to me and said, I\u2019m going to\nAmerica. And that\u2019s when the -- right after that my little spider arrived. So, I mean,\nthat was -- it was like getting -- you know, it was like going to look at the bulletin\nboard in college and knowing that you been -- you know, that you\u2019ve gotten theJanuary 4, 2002\nschool of your choice. This was the dream of every child there, it was to come to the\nUnited States.",
        "A: About 80, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. We -- well, my friend from Speyer didn\u2019t come. She went later.",
        "A: Yeah, they didn\u2019t come with me. Truda an-and Gunter came later, and Truda\nstayed in France for seven years after that. But she never left. The thing -- I came\nwith my brother by myself, with other children from gu -- from Gurs, but not\nTruda. No, she said she -- they were very upset when I left because they thought\nthey would never be able to get out, but they did eventually. No, these were children\nfrom everywhere.",
        "A: Yeah, my br -- no, my brother slept with the boys and I slept with the girls. And\nthere was like huge dormitories and he was -- you know, and they would come up at\nnight and we were allowed -- they would turn lights out and that was it. It was -- it\nwas like -- it was like -- a little bit like being in a camp for the poor.\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: Ye -- yeah, well I became ill on the boat. I got rheumatic fever. But I was fine\nthen, you know, when I came -- when I -- when I left Marjelier and I was on the\ntransport to Marseilles, they took two children off the train. They were friends of\nours from Marjelier. And it was a sister -- a broth -- a brother and a sister and they\nhad very bad eyesight, they wore very thick glasses. And the train stopped, the\nGermans came and took them off. Now, again, I don\u2019t understand that. I mean, I\u2019ve\nnever been able to understand why the ger -- the Germans allowed these children to\ngo to the United States, obviously, or the fren -- no, the fr -- no, the French took\nthem off, not the Germans, because we were traveling through unoccupied France\nat that time, til we got to Marseilles. It must have been the French that did that,\nbecause the United States would not have allowed them into the country, because\nthey could not see well. So when I became very ill, on -- on the train, I had the first\nattack, I didn\u2019t tell anybody anything cause I knew that they would take me off the\ntrain. And I was fine when I got to Marseilles. And I asked my pediatrician who\ntook care of me here, Dr. Liebolis in -- in Maryland why it would come like this,\nthat I would get this tremendous pain. He says -- she says, because that\u2019s what\nhappened. She says, it would come, the rum -- rheumatic fever is exactly like that,\nyou have these terrible pains. It affects the heart. And I was fine when I got to\nMarseilles. When I got on the boat it happened again, and this time was very severe.January 4, 2002\nAnd again I was afraid to say anything. But when I got to this country, my brother\nhad a fever, and they don\u2019t allow you in.",
        "A: We'll go --",
        "A: -- yeah.",
        "A: They told -- they came and told -- they called my brother and I into the office of\nthe headmistress and they said we\u2019re going -- you\u2019re going to be leaving next week,\nyou\u2019re going -- and I said, we\u2019re going to America. And she says, we are going to\nAmerica. I said, good. And I -- I was going to say to them, well when is my mother\nand father coming, but I somehow didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t. So she said to me, you know, we\n-- gather all your things together, and I did. I immediately was ready. I mean, I was\nready at that moment. And they came and they were who -- they were whoever we --\nit was a number of children. We all lined up. They had an -- this car. They had cars,\nnot -- not trucks.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, just a few. There were maybe -- how many were -- of us came\non the boat? I would say maybe 20, that\u2019s about all, came -- again, only the par --\nJanuary 4, 2002\nchildren of those parents that had already been designated. And they came -- we --\nthey took us in cars. Now, when we got to -- we went by train to marjel -- to\nMarseilles. What happened that was very interesting is that our leaders, there were\ntwo adults that went with us -- and on the train to Marseilles is when Bernard and\nhis sister were taken off, and we never saw --",
        "A: Yes, I think they were Jewish. But when -- when we got to Marseilles,\nsomething happened and they told us to go very quickly down the steps because\nthere were Germans coming in. And whether they thought the Germans would stop\nus, I don\u2019t know, but I remember absolute panicking. I did panic then because she\nsaid, go quickly, quietly, down the steps to the trains -- to, you know, wherever we\nwere going, and we -- we all ran very quickly. And as I was running, I looked up\nand I saw the Germans coming and walking up the stairs. You know, we were going\ndown one flight, they were coming up another flight and I remember thinking, oh\nGod, ub -- because I saw their uniforms, the yellow uniforms with the swastika and\nthe black pants. And that -- I got very frightened cause I thought I would be going to\nAmerica, and -- you know, and we got --",
        "A: Yes.January 4, 2002",
        "A: -- \u2018tober, yes. So then we get on the train and --",
        "A: Yes. I was not 12 yet. I was -- yeah, I was 12, I had turned 12. So anyway, we\nwere on the train, and oh --",
        "A: Yes, I was just thinking, they had given me a bra to wear, cause I was starting to\nshow a little bit and I didn\u2019t like that. But anyway, I wore the bra and I was getting\nto be -- well, I was not chubby, but -- I wasn\u2019t chubby, but I was always a little\nshort. So anyway, one of the teachers had tilted my head up like this, one of the\nwoman teachers, very nice, I liked her very much, and said, you\u2019re going to be a\nvery pretty woman. And I never thought that at all, so I said -- I remember thinking\nshe was cr -- oh, she was right, by the way, I did turn out to be a very pretty woman\nas I grew up. Anyway, not --",
        "A: No, no, no, no, not -- I didn\u2019t do that until I went to the Catholic co-convalescent\nhome in the United States after I had rheumatic fever. Catholics and I have a thing,\nI\u2019m telling you. So anyway, I -- we got on the train to Marjelier -- is a -- at mas --\nJanuary 4, 2002\nin -- in Marseilles and we headed toward the Spanish border, and that\u2019s -- was the\nincident with Po and my parents, you know. Wi --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay, th-the train stopped and they said to us, they said that the parents would be\nallowed to see their children for five minutes. So all -- from Gurs. These were all\nthe children from Gurs that were on the train. And I looked outside and there was\nmy mother and father and they came on for a minute. My mother hu -- my other was\nalmost silent.",
        "A: Yeah, they came into the -- yeah, we were allowed to go -- they were allowed to\nstep into the train, to the compartment. And my mother was very quiet. I think -- I\nthink she knew. I think she knew. And she hugged me and she kissed my brother\nand I and she cried a little. And she said, be good. She says, be a good girl. And I\nthink they must have been shocked by how much I\u2019d grown in those few months.\nAnd then my father, as I said, gave me the letter, he hugged and kissed me, and I\nremember -- the thing I remember is when the train was pulling away and I saw\nthem standing there, together, how totally forlorn they were. Even as young as I was,January 4, 2002\nI knew that ineffable sadness that every child on the train felt when they looked at\ntheir parents. Not just me, we all felt 1t. We were absolutely saddened. Now ac --\nI\u2019m wrong, not all the children\u2019s parents were at Gurs, there were others who came\nto us afterwards and said, were these your parents? So they -- not all the children\nwere from Gurs, some of them were. I think most of them, because I remember\ncome -- some one of the girls coming in and say, was that your mother and father\nand I said yes. So it wasn\u2019t her p -- her parents weren\u2019t there. But we all knew that\npain, you know, that a child feels when they s -- when they suddenly feel that sense\nof insecurity of not having a parent, a -- any -- it was very frightening to me, and to -\n- | think to my brother, and the finality of it. And when the letter -- when I read the\nletter to my brother -- my father was saying goodbye, you know, an-an-and I knew\nthat was it. I\u2019m so sorry I ever tore it up, but it\u2019s gone. Anyway, we left Marseilles,\nnow we head toward wonderful Spain. We pull into ma -- this 1s --",
        "A: Devastating, he -- devastating. He was -- I -- I\u2019m telling you, for my brother the -\n- these little bits and pieces of life being torn away from him devastated him. I think\nhe -- he became ap -- he -- h-he -- he looked at this as something that he was totally\nremoved from. He went through all the motions, but he had absolutely no feeling\nwith it. He behaved normally, but I think my brother was very badly hurt by all this,\nJanuary 4, 2002\nall his life. So then we got t -- we got on the train and it\u2019s traveling, traveling, we\npull into Madrid. Now, we had been given Gruyere cheese -- cheese, grapes and\nbread by s -- the people in -- in Marjelier. I have never eaten a piece of Gruyere\ncheese in over 60 years. They were starving in Spain. This was after the civil war.\nMother were nursing their children at the depot. Soldiers in rags were walking up\nand down, there was nothing, we gave them all our food. All the children did, we\nhanded it through the windows, never realizing that we were going to Lisbon and\nwe would have to have nothing to -- well, we did, we all gave our food away. I think\npartly because we really were sick of the Gruyere, too. And the train continued to\nLisbon, and we arrived in Lisbon in this beautiful city, have you ever been there?\nYou -- it\u2019s still there, I s -- have a friend who went. You have this vista of the sea,\nthe medit -- it\u2019s just magnificent, and this beautiful hotel, where they -- these\nraggedy children arrived. I\u2019m sure that hotel concierge probably passed out when he\nsaw us, all these raggedly -- bunch of kids who hadn\u2019t been bathed in days, you\nknow, arriving. They gave us bread and butter, the best bread and butter I\u2019ve ever\neaten, and I\u2019m telling you, they would bring out trays of it, it would be gone in two\nseconds. They kept bringing out more and more trays of bread and fruit and\neverything and the minute it was -- we just ate like wolves, I mean -- oh, the other\nthing was, we -- we did stay in Marseille for about three days and they brought us\nJanuary 4, 2002\nfood there, too. That\u2019s where we got the Gruyere cheese and stuff. They brought in\nthis wonderful food, I don\u2019t know if it was kosher or not. But -- I mean, that was the\nfirst time we had really eaten really food -- food since we left Germany. I mean, we\ndidn\u2019t -- you know, that we had meat and we had potatoes and we had vegetables,\nand you know, s -- things. And the same thing in Lisbon. They brought us all this\nbread an-and cheeses and fruit and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and meals that we\ncould actually eat. That night they showed movies. I had never seen these movies.\nAmerican movies. They were in English, I couldn\u2019t understand, but I said, this is\nAmerica. Well, of course, you know, Shirley Temple, I mean, need I say anything\nelse? So that was wonderful, those were a wonderful three days because we were\nwashed, our hair was washed, we had clean clothes to put on. But, when I got on the\nboat, I had nothing. I had no underwear, nothing. So I wore -- I used to wash out my\nunderwear at night and -- and -- and wear it the next day and it was very cold. And\nof course, I was already sick, which didn\u2019t help, you know? But on the boat -- we\nwere supposed to sail on this boat and the boat, we missed it in Marseille. There\nwas a delay and when we got to Lisbon, this boat had sailed. That boat was sunk by\na German sub, and we t -- I would have never made it here. You would not be\nlistening to this absolutely scintillating story. I -- my -- we took the Safir Pinto\ninstead. And we left and I was very, very seasick until we got to Casablanca. And\nJanuary 4, 2002\nonce we got to Casablanca -- oh, and when I was standing there, you know, I was\nafter -- and you know, being a reader and being very melodramatic, I watched the --\nthe -- the shores of Europe recede, and I\u2019m thinking to myself, you must remember\nthis moment all your life, that you are now leaving. You have to remember this, this\nis an important moment. It\u2019s just like when I saw my parents, I said to myself, you\nhave to remember this, you have to remember them just as they looked. You know, I\nwanted to do that, and I did. I\u2019ve never forgotten it. Anyway, we got to -- we get to\nCasablanca and we stayed there for -- oh, I did not see Ingrid or Bogey, I just saw\na very dirty island, or dirty city. And then we sailed. It took us 10 days to come to\nthe United States. More than 10 days, like 13 days, with one pair of underpants.\nVery strange food, very elegant first class. They had women -- they had a lot of\nemigrants on that boat, ver -- again, a very motley crew of people in first class.\nWomen who were very heavily made up and wore very elegant clothes, and men.\nThey pretty much tried to ex -- ignore us because we\u2019re this ragtag bunch of kids,\nyou know, we -- I think we were sort of an object of pity and -- and also\nembarrassment and guilt, you know? That they were having this wonderful time\nwith music playing and dancing and everything and here we were with these big\neyes reminding them what was really going on in Europe, and they didn\u2019t want to\nbe reminded. I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t know how many were Jews or not Jews, but\nJanuary 4, 2002\nnobody wants -- wanted to be reminded. And they were sort of nice. But I had my\nfirst love affair on the boat because the son of the captain was on the boat, and he\nliked me. And he\u2019d sneak little things for me. That\u2019s when I first began to\nunderstand the importance of being a female, and what it -- 1t -- you can derive out\nof that. I got great oranges, all peeled and beautiful. I got wonderful sweets and ice\ncream. I mean, he got me lots of goodies. And I --",
        "A: About 13. I was 12. And he really liked me. He would talk to me. We didn\u2019t\nunderstand one word, I mean he spoke Portuguese and I spoke whatever. But we\nunderstood each other. And I would be sitting there and he\u2019d come up and the\nsteward would be trailing behind him and he\u2019d open up this thing and there would\nbe wonderful goodies, and I was -- became very powerful then. Then we got to the\nUnited States -- oh, they posed us -- oh, go ahead.",
        "A: I'd say about 40. About 40, I think, yeah, not that many. Yeah, about 40 because\nwe -- when we landed you know, they posed me -- the newspaper, American\nnewspapers posed me. It must be still there in -- it\u2019s in the archives of the New York\nTimes for that day. They posed my brother and I on the rail of the ship behind the\nStatue of Liberty. The American reporters came to interview us because they heardJanuary 4, 2002\nthat the children had come from Europe. And that\u2019s how my Uncle Heinz found\nout, he opened up the New York Times and there on the front page was his niece.",
        "A: October -- it was October the seventh, I think. Anyway, there was his niece\nsitting there with her -- my brother. He -- he cried. My uncle, again, also cried.\nAnyway, they took --",
        "A: Oh no, nothing like that. No --",
        "A: -- no, no, no, but when the -- when the e -- nothing. We did nothing but roam the\nship, play and do whatever and sit and read. Course again, I found books, which was\nwonderful.",
        "A: No, no, no, I brought nothing with me. As -- I got on that ship without anything.\nWe had little satchel maybe of something, but when I left Lisbon, I really had\nnothing. I mean, I think I had one change of clothing and I really didn\u2019t have any\nunder things at all.\nJanuary 4, 2002",
        "A: I left them in Gurs for the children, for everybody else that was left. I never took\nthem with me. No, I would never have done that. That\u2019s one thing we learned to do\nis that we had to -- whatever we could leave for somebody else to use, it became\ninstinctive and we all did that. It\u2019s like when we gave all the food to the -- to the\nSpaniards, I mean, it was just instinctive to do that, we had learned to do that.\nAnyway, when we got on the United States, when the immigration people came on\nboard and the doctors, they took my brother\u2019s temperature and ma -- he had a li-little\ntemperature, so we had to go to this place in -- in -- in Queens or Brooklyn that was\nlike a rehabilitation [indecipherable]",
        "A: I hadn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have a clue. I just thou -- looked at this big thing. I mean, I\ndidn't know what it was supposed to be. Everybody -- I mean, I heard them saying\nStatue of Liberty, Statue of Liberty and I knew libert\u00e9 means liberty. And I didn\u2019t\nknow what these reporters were all doing around us and then he -- one of them\nhoisted me up on the rail and he hoisted up my brother and they all yelling and they\nall talking, and this -- the interpreter is trying to say things and they were taking\nJanuary 4, 2002\nthese pictures. He says -- and I do remember this, I understood, how do you like\nAmerica? Are you an -- an-and | didn\u2019t understand and I kept saying yes, yes, you\nknow, oui, oui. I didn\u2019t have a clue. And --",
        "A: It was [indecipherable] that boat -- huh?",
        "A: When I got off the boat and on the land, the thing that absolutely -- absolutely\nstunned me is as we walked -- driving through the streets is the outside of the food\nstores. The fruit piled up. I could not imagine that human beings had that much to\neat. I mean, the -- the abundance of everything, and the way people were walking\naround and the yelling and the screaming and the waving and -- and you know, we\nwere driving through a Jewish section, you know, it was probably like the East Side.\nI mean, the exuberance of this country, after all the quiet and -- and -- and -- and the\ndesolation and the grieving and the mourning that I\u2019ve been subjected to for the last\nfour or five years, you know, that unconsciously I had absorbed. And now suddenly\nseeing all this life and this -- the -- the abundance is what -- what did it for me. I\nmean, I -- I saw oranges this big and people didn\u2019t pay -- I saw a woman eating an\nice cream cone. I hadn\u2019t seen an ice cream, I didn\u2019t even know what it looked like\nany more. And the thing I fell in love with was chewing gum. The driver of the carJanuary 4, 2002\nsays, would you like chewing gum? I couldn\u2019t understand what chewing gum was,\nbut he handed me this thing and he showed me and I chewed it and I loved it. And I\n-- it -- I -- and it was just wonder -- I mean, everything was exhilarating to me. I\ndidn\u2019t -- again, I didn\u2019t realize, you know, that this was the prologue to my life here.",
        "A: Oh, and all the other children. It was like a van, like a station wagon, you know.\nWe were like in a big bus kind of thing, and they were taking us to this place where -\n- where there was like a little hospital, and it was really an orphanage, but a very\nhigh class orph -- very nice. And they kept us there until we could go with foster\nparents, til my foster parents could take me in Baltimore. You know, I came -- went\nto foster parents, my brother and I. You didn\u2019t know that? Yeah. So anyway, I -- th-\nthat\u2019s --",
        "A: Oh, about two or three days. And then the m -- the -- the -- Mrs. --",
        "A: Mrs. Beser came from Baltimore, who came with the associated Jewish\ncharities. She was their liaison with all this and she came and got my brother and I.\nHer son was the nav -- navigator who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima,\nJacob Beser. Yeah, and he never recovered from that, which I can well understand.January 4, 2002\nAnyway, she came and she got us and on the trip to Baltimore -- I had no idea -- oh,\nin the meantime, my Uncle Heinz came and my Uncle Adolf, they couldn\u2019t take us\nfor some reason or other what had to do cause they weren\u2019t citizens themselves. And\nmy father\u2019s family came and wanted us and I decided not to, which was the biggest\nmistake I ever made in my life. I did not want to go with these people, I didn\u2019t know\nwho they were, I -- I --",
        "A: Yes, and -- which was sad because I should have gone with them. They were my\nfather\u2019s -- but my uncles didn\u2019t want me to go with them because they didn\u2019t think\nthey were high class enough. They were real German snobs and my poor father was\nPolish, so they never re -- they forgave him because he was so smart, but they could\nnot forgive these people. Anyway, it was a big mistake. Anyway, went to\nBaltimore, got another attack of my little rheumatic fever, which I didn't\nunderstand, and this time it -- it got better but it didn\u2019t stay better. I ended up going\nto Sinai Hospital in Baltimore. And I met my foster parents. They were probably\ngood people, but I think were doing it for the wrong reasons, they were doing it for\nfinancial reasons, with some compassion.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nJanuary 4, 2002\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Mm-hm. And -- and I -- well, I became ill on the train again, you know, that --\nthat last -- I think it was like the last attack, that was like the third one. And again I\nkind of tried not to give into it because I was still very frightened, but it really kind\nof overwhelmed me and eventually I ended up going to Sinai Hospital. I s --",
        "A: And then I -- I-I went to meet --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. And what happened was I was ill. I met my -- I did -- I met my new foster\nparents that night, and as I said, part -- they had various reasons for doing it. I don\u2019t\nthink they were the right reasons and I don\u2019t think they were the right people for us.\nMy brother eventually went to another foster home, and so did I. But they were not,\nin any way, abusive. My foster father, unfortunately developed an affection for meJanuary 4, 2002\nwhich wasn\u2019t quite what it should have been. It wasn\u2019t paternal, let\u2019s put it that way.\nSo it was -- it was not a great experience for me, but it wasn\u2019t horrible either, I\nmean, nothing terrible happened to me, except that I did go to the hospital, I couldn\u2019t\nspeak English, I -- they were very concerned that they didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nknow exactly what was happening to me. I had a wonderful pediatrician who was\ntaking care of me. Her name was Lucille Liebolis, and she\u2019s very well known. And\n-- and I was at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore and a lot of young doctors came in and\ntried to speak to me and I couldn\u2019t really understand them. And finally a -- a rabbi\ncame in from Ohav Shalom and he was doctor -- oh God, he was a rabbi before,\nRabbi Shaw, I can\u2019t even remember his name, but he had come in and said he had\nmet my father in -- in -- in Germany, and he spoke to me in what was passable\nGerman, and so he finally explained to me what was happening to me and why I was\nthere, and what they were trying to do to me, because I wasn\u2019t sure what -- what\nthey were doing. Anyway, I stayed there for six weeks. After I came out of there --",
        "A: Once in awhile they did come, yes. Absolutely they came.",
        "A: My brother did too. But -- but what happened in between 1s that the United\nStates went to war. And I remember all the brouhaha that was going around. I hadJanuary 4, 2002\nbecome friendly with the little girl next -- in the cubicle next to me who had had\npolio. And that was really horrible what they were doing to her because they were\nusing the kes -- Sister Kenny\u2019s system with the hot towels. Anyway, she and I\nbecame friends and my favorite occupation with her was singing, \u201cYou Are My\nSunshine.\u201d We sang it day and night, we drove everybody insane. But I heard all this\ngoing on and somebody explained to me and I was speaking a little English, that the\nUnited States was at war. And somebody came in and said to me in Yiddish, the\nUnited States, it is kreig, is at war, and he said -- I mean, I said, e -- yes? He said,\nwe are at war with Japan and Germany. And I couldn\u2019t understand that, I thought\neverybody was at war. I didn\u2019t realize the United States were not at war, I thought\nthe whole world was at -- that wasn\u2019t -- that was no big deal. Anyway, that\u2019s what\nhappened when I was in the hospital. I came out, I went to a convalescent center,\nSaint something in Catonsville in mary] -- in Baltimore, and --",
        "A: No, but the words, the many words that are similar in a di -- you know, they are\nclose. I couldn\u2019t speak -- I only sp -- only spoke German, but there are people who\nspeak Yiddish who can make themselves understood very easily. Anyway, I went to\nthis Catholic convalescent home and I stayed there for another six weeks, altogether.\nThen they told me at that time, Dr. Liebolis told me I would never have children,January 4, 2002\nthat I had a very bad heart. I went to the William S. Baer School for crippled\nchildren with horrifically handicapped children, but very nice. I -- it was a very nice\nexperience for me. They were very nice to me. And I -- then after that I went to\nWestern High School. I sat for a scholarship to Barnard, but I met my husband --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, yes -- oh yeah, I went back to them, but th --",
        "A: Snowhite, if -- if you can believe it. Jules and Ceil Snowhite. I know. Yeah, I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it either once I understood what the word meant. Anyway, I did go\nback to them and then I was transferred out from there to another foster family\ncalled Maniken, where I met my husband, because he had been their foster child,\ntoo. My husband --",
        "A: Because Mrs. Beser, I think they all decided that it was not a good situation. She\nhad another child. They were a very young couple, and they had another baby and\nthey really had no room for me. I mean, once the baby came they needed the rooms.January 4, 2002\nMy brother had already gone by then to another foster family, the Kolectors, and I\nwent to the Manikens, and -- and my husband had come from Germany in 1938.\nThere were two brothers, Walter Grunberg -- my maiden name and my married\nname became the same. And I know, it\u2019s a -- yo-you\u2019ve got the weirdest interview\nhere e -- in history. And his brother Manfred had come. His brother Manfred had\nenlisted in the American army and was killed as a navigator, he was shot down over\nGermany. If that is not irony I cannot tell you what else would be. Anyway, Walter\nwas there. She had taken the boys in -- she took five German boys, German\nrefugees, Jewish children, in. My -- the two Grunberg brothers plus the three Mann\nbrothers. There were three brothers there. So there were five altogether. Well, they\nwere all gone by the time I got there, they were all either in the service -- the only\none that was left was Walter and I hated him and he hated me and we never got\nalong, until one day when I was about 17, he says, you doing anything? I said no. He\nsays, Ill take you to the movies, I said okay. So he went -- he took me to a movie\nwith his friend Frank. My date consisted of me trailing behind -- behind them,\nwhile they were talking to each other. They never looked at me, never talked to me.\nI remember the movie, was called \u201cThe Jolson Story\u201d with Al -- and I came -- then\nwhen -- what ha -- I don\u2019t know what happened -- oh, I know, we -- he says, you\nwant something to eat? I said yes. So we went to Nate\u2019s [indecipherable], which\nJanuary 4, 2002\nwas a very famous deli in Baltimore, and Frank says, I\u2019ve got to go. So, he left and\nWalter and I s -- began to speak to each other for the first time like human beings,\ninstead of snarling at each other all the time. And I really liked him. And he really\nliked me. He had been engaged before, didn\u2019t work out, and he was very handsome.\nHe is my children\u2019s father. And we started going out. Mrs. Maniken was outraged.\nNot for any sexual reasons. Not because she thought I was not going to be a -- you\nknow, that there was going to be anything pornographic going on under her roof, or\nanything obscene or that I was doing anything bad, no. Walter was very generous\nfinancially. He bought her lots of gifts, he had no obligations, he was working. So\nshe wasn\u2019t too happy about that. But he asked me to marry him, and I said yes, for\nall the wrong reasons.",
        "A: I was going to be 18. I didn\u2019t deci -- I was not the -- which meant I was not going\nto go to college, I was going to be married. So --",
        "A: Walter was 24. He was born in 1925, so he -- he was four years older than I was,\nso he was -- no, if I was -- he was about -- he was born in 1923, I\u2019m sorry, \u201923, I was\nborn in \u201929, he was six years older than I was, so he was about 24 then, almost 24. I\nwanted to be my own person. I wanted to be free. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t want to liveJanuary 4, 2002\nunder anybody\u2019s roof any more. I wanted to -- I -- you know. So I married Walter. I\ncared about him, he was a very nice -- he was a very decent man, and he always\nloved me til the day he died. I had my son about two years later, which was\nwonderful. Then I had my daughter four years after that, and then I wanted a\ndivorce, for no imaginable reason under the sun except I wa -- had met a\npsychiatrist. He promised me the earth and the moon and I thought, I don\u2019t want to\nstruggle any more, I want everything easy. I was very immature. That\u2019s where\nchildren who are -- have to grow up so quickly, in one aspect of their lives and have\nno chance to mature in the normal things -- I did not have the chance to be a child,\nha -- be a teenager. I never had the time to do any of those things. I was catapulted\nfrom one event to another. And adjusting to new people, adjusting to more new\npeople, adjusting to a school, learning a language. There is no excuse. I\u2019m not\nmaking any excuses for myself because that\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m saying it. \u2019'm\nsimply saying that behavior that is aberrant among people -- from people that have\ngone through a lot of trauma has -- there are explanations. You don\u2019t have to forgive\nit and you don\u2019t even have to put up with it, but you have to know that it\u2019s going to\nhappen. And it did happen with me. I was simply not prepared to be a mother. I was\n-- | love my children, I adore them. And my children, for some reason, think that I\nwalk on water. And I always tell them I don\u2019t understand that because I was reallyJanuary 4, 2002\ntempted to drown both of you at birth, you know? But the thing is that I have done\nthat with my children simply because I love them and respect them. But I was not a\ngreat mother, I was not a doting mother. I was totally self-absorbed, always. It took\nme years to understand that there was a world outside of me, my feelings, my anger,\nmy rage, what had happened to me. Not poor me kind of thing, I never felt that. I\nnever felt, oh, poor me. I always realized how lucky I was. But -- but the self-\nabsorption was unconscious. I didn\u2019t realize it. And so my marriage failed because\nof that. I then --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I wanted to find my parents and that\u2019s the first thing I did, I went to the Red\nCross. And they came back and said my parents had died, both. They gave me the\nnews that my parents were both dead, but they gave me the wrong dates. They told\nme my parents -- and for years I carried that burden -- they told me that my parents\nhad died in May of 1945, maybe 20 days before the war was over, which I fi --\nagain, found intolerable. If I had known they had died in the beginning of 19 -- in th\nJanuary 4, 2002\n-- in 1942, when there was no end to the war in sight, 1t wouldn\u2019t have been so\nhorrific, but for me to realize that, you know, they could have lived another 20 --\nwell, 1 -- that was a mistake, they had made the mistake. It was one of those things\nthat happened. But they told me that both my parents were dead. And --",
        "A: Well, my reaction was -- it only fed into my rage and anger. I mean, it only fed\nby what was now, by now a full grown hate for -- for what happened to my parents,\nthe fact that -- that this was done to them, and a -- a -- that people -- I mean, I was\nangry at the United States. I found Jews in the United States are forg -- unforgiving\n-- | -- | wa -- I was unforgiving toward them. I felt that they were the smuggest, most\ncomplacent -- I attacked them viciously, I mean, with venom. I\u2019d say, don\u2019t you ever\ntalk to me about your friend Mr. Roosevelt. I said, don\u2019t you ever talk to me and\ncommiserate to me about what happened in Europe while you were all sitting here\ndoing absolutely nothing while your people were dying in concentration -- where\nwere your marches to Washington? I mean, I railed and ranted for years. And I\nreally made -- I mean, I have a lot of friends, and that they took this crap from me --\nI mean, I\u2019m talking about people like Elaine. I mean, they\u2019ve been my friends for\nover 50 years. They took it, and they absorbed m -- my anger and their guilt.\nBecause they didn\u2019t have anything -- it was their parents, they were youngJanuary 4, 2002\nthemselves, but I -- you know, I used to go on and on on my little soap box. Now I\nrealize, it\u2019s going on he -- I\u2019m sitting here, what am I doing for Israel? I\u2019m sending\nthem a few checks? Am I raving and ranting and railing and running to Washington\nsaying do something? No. For my people? No, I\u2019m just as complacent as these\npeople were. The wheel is round. My husband always said that and he is right. I\npersonally would like to see Mr. Arafat writhe in agony, but it ain\u2019t gonna happen.\nSo, I mean, it -- it -- life goes on. Anyway, I got married, I had my children, left my\nhusband, remarried again, disaster. Met my third husband who was the gem. He was\nwonderful, as Walter had been. And then I went to wor -- when I was married, after\nmy relationship with my psychiatrist broke up and oh -- and I realized it wasn\u2019t\ngoing to work, I went to work for the school of medicine, Johns Hopkins, which\nwas one of the highlights of my life. I went to work for A. McGee Harvey, who was\n-- who was chairman of the department of medicine, physician and chief of Johns\nHopkins Hospital and the editor of the Journal Medicine. And the McGee -- A.\nMcGee Harvey building is named after him at Johns Hopkins Hospital. And I went\nfor an interview, and I walk into this room, and this little man is sitting there behind\nthis absolutely cluttered desk in this rather -- rather unimpressive office. And I\nshook hands with him, I had wore kid gloves. I shook hands with him and sat down.\nI had failed the test that the employment agency had given me. There was a big red\nJanuary 4, 2002\nX right across th-the exam that she had sent out. And I saw it lying there and I figure\nwhy is he seeing me? So he -- we were chatting and he asked me about everything\nand I said -- to everything he asked me I said no, cause I didn\u2019t know. So then I went\nhome. I get this call from this man, this personnel director of the Hopkins and he\nsays, Mrs. Grunberg? I said yes. He says, welcome to Johns Hopkins. I said, you\nmean he -- they hired me? He said yes. I said, who is that little man? I said, who 1s\nthis Dr. Harvey? Well, there was dead silence like my asking do you know who\npresident -- who the president is. He says, that is Dr. A. McGee Harvey, very, very\ncoldly. He says, he is physician and chief of this hospital and chairman of the\ndepartment of medicine, and professor of medicine. He 1s the -- the professor or\nmedicine. I said oh. I said, I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t tell me that beforehand because I\nwould have fainted right there on the spot. Years later -- oh, when I walked in there\nwas another man sitting in a corner, his name was Kenneth Zeiler. Ken Zeiler is\none of the geniuses of all time, he was chief of endocrinology. Years later I said to\nKen, why did ha -- Mark hire me? He says, you walked in, you shook hands, you\nsat down, you looked like a lady and you spoke English. I said, not well. He said but\nyou -- he says, believe me, you did. It was -- you know, and then the other thing that\nwas funny about Ken, I saw him maybe 10 years ago, I said, Ken, I said, you know\nyou were always one of my most favorite people. He was also a full professor. He\nJanuary 4, 2002\nsays, did you know I was in love with you? I said, what? He says, I loved you for\nyears. I said, Ken, you are married. He says, I know. I says, there was never -- he\nsays, you never knew, he says, you never realized, he says, but I always loved you. I\nsaid, you are joining that long list. Anyway, that was wonderful, he trained me to be\na redactor, you know, and -- and -- with manus -- for manuscripts. He put me on the\ninternship committee, on the residency committee, I was in charge of the Lilienthal\nlibrary. I mean, he really trained me and gave me wonderful, wonderful time. And\nthen my husband said to me, it\u2019s time for you not -- I\u2019d like you to stop working. He\nsaid, you don\u2019t need to financially -- but the mean -- in the meantime my mother\u2019s\nbrother died, my Uncle Heinz, and left me money, which was very nice of him. And\nhe left it to my brother and my cousin and I, and he was very well-to-do, he was rich\nman. And he -- we split it three ways. And -- and my husband was comfortable, so I\ndidn\u2019t -- but I -- I said, okay. We joined the cumtr -- country club. I became like an\nadult camp -- you know, we\u2019re going shopping today, we\u2019re playing bridge today,\nwe\u2019re doing mahjong today. The skirts are too long, the skirts are too short, they\u2019 re\nwearing boots, they\u2019re not wearing boots. Finally got to the point I was going to lose\nmy mind. I said to my husband, I have to go do something. So I called Ira Morris, a\nfriend of mine, a doctor at Hopkin -- from Hopkins, who had formed a medical\ngroup down in east Baltimore, which is a very poor area. And he was doing the --\nJanuary 4, 2002\nnot an HMO, but similar to that, but poor, for the poor. And that\u2019s where I met\nEllen. Wonderful day, 1976. She was the -- there was A-Annabelle Scher, Richard\nScher -- do you know Annabelle and Richard Scher? He does news, he was the\nanchor and Annabelle was there, Ellen was there, and I went to work for Ira. Ira is\nher dear friend and my dear friend and he\u2019s the one she talks to now all the time\nabout this. I called up Ira, I said, Ira, I need to do something. He says, what do you\nwant to do, darling? He called me the countess. He says, Countess, what do you\nwant to do? I said, I want to work a couple days a week. So he said okay. So we\nwent -- I went to work in east Baltimore, which was run by the state and fu -- really\nfunded by the state, for really the -- the -- the -- you know, really people who on\nMedicaid, you know. And Ellen was sort of there the psychologist cum whatever.\nAnd -- and that\u2019s how I met her and sh -- it was wonderful. I mean, it was a\nwonderful job, I loved it. I worked there for like two, three days a week. And of\ncourse I kind of became the -- like, you know, I became the administrator, I became\nthe hot honcho. And that fell apart. Ira and the state and Senator Douglas from the\nstate of Maryland parted company. Not -- not -- not the -- not -- the state senator.\nAnd he formed the east -- the central [indecipherable] medical group and I went\nwith him, uh-huh, and stayed there for about another 10 - 12 years. Ellen did not\ncome with that, Ellen then, when the whole thing fell apart, it was a very ugly scene,January 4, 2002\nwith a lot of newspapers and I was interviewed again, do -- you know, the whole\nthing. Anyway, I went to work for him and then my husband died. That was tr-\ntremendous trauma for me. He died in 1980, and that was very hard. I f -- think that\nwhen you lose a mate, and I\u2019m not pontificating, I don\u2019t think anybody whose never\n-- whose -- until you\u2019ve been there, it is probably the singlest greatest loss that you\ncan experience. Even -- I think even in situations where the marriage hasn\u2019t been\nthat steadfast. And people, you know, always say that, but they don\u2019t understand\nwhy a person who\u2019s lived with somebody for 30 years and has never had a nice\nword to say about him all of a sudden is wailing and -- and weeping all over place.\nWell, I'll tell you why they do. I understand. It\u2019s because that person 1s no longer\nthere, it has become an attachment. It\u2019s like somebody severing a part of you. And\nthat is why suddenly this person becomes saint -- saintly. Well, I happen to have\nliked my husband, so it was really, really hard. And --",
        "A: Oh, I think so, I think it\u2019s -- a loss for me has always been difficult. And it -- \u2019m\nbasically -- the thing I discovered about myself, which is the final result of all that\nhas happened to me, is that underneath all the bravado, and underneath all this -- this\n-- this -- that my friends and my children to this day believe that I am the strongest\nperson they know. I mean, they admire that -- that underneath all that I am the mostJanuary 4, 2002\nfearful, insecure, quivering mass of jelly you have ever seen. And they don\u2019t\nunderstand that. I am terrified of everything. And that came much later. That did not\ncome when I was young. When I was young I had that audacity. I decided to leave a\nhusband with two children. I had the guts to do all that. The -- th-the -- the -- the\nthing came as I began to understand and as I began to take my life apart and look at\nit. If I had kept it set in concrete the way it was, without ever chiseling away at that -\n- that -- that -- that -- that thing that I encased everything into. If I hadn\u2019t broken that\nthing apart to look at it, what was in there, if I kept it encapsulated, I wouldn\u2019t be so\nfearful. But I think in doing that I unleashed, literally, the fear that -- and -- and --\nand -- and -- and the terror that I experienced as a child, that I was -- that I just\nburied, and -- and closed up and -- and -- and -- until it became hardened. And that\u2019s\nwhat -- that\u2019s what I did. I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not sorry I did it because in a way it set me\nfree in other areas. I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not so consumed by anger any more and I don\u2019t\ntend to be as judgmental as I used to be. You know, I -- I used to be very critical of\npeople. When they talked about the war I looked at them with the utmost superiority\nand say, well you don\u2019t even know what it is, you know? But now I don\u2019t -- but now\nI do know. I think they -- I do know what that is that they felt during the war. It may\nnot have been of the -- the -- the -- the epic proportions that we did, who were there,\nJanuary 4, 2002\nover there, but certainly they suffered, too. Children whose fathers went overseas,\nand you know, who were left here, alone.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I think so. I think there were times when I would watch my children,\nand I would think about it. I would -- I remember when -- when -- when Bonnie, I\nthink was like -- when I took Bonnie to school the first time, more so than Mark,\nbecause Mark went to school happily. I mean, he would -- he -- he ran away from\nme to get into class. But Bonnie -- when Bonnie -- I took Bonnie to school and I\nsaw her walk away for the -- for one moment I felt the anguish that my mother must\nhave felt, that I thought about it, I said, my God, she\u2019s only going away for four\nhours. I feel this pain of separation. How could my mother have done it? And then\nwhen I thought about my -- th-then wh-when they did things, like when -- I\nremember Mark when he was little, ran away once. He wandered off with a child.\nIn those days we were not afraid of the kind of things that we\u2019re afraid of now, I just\nwas nervous and I was pregnant with Bonnie and when he came home, the first\nthing that came out of his mouth was, did I miss the Good Humor man, Mommy\u2019?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nBut again I felt that anguish, that fear, you know, that something had happened to\nthe -- that -- wa -- are my children safe? Every -- I remember the scare with -- with\nKennedy and the -- and the [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- Missile Crisis. I was at Hopkins. My children were in school. I remember\nthinking i -- what are -- how am I gonna find my children? Where are my children\ngoing to be? If there\u2019s a -- an attack, how will I ever get home. And I tr -- I was\ntrying to give instructions to my children what they should do. Don\u2019t leave. I will\nget to you. Daddy and I will find you. But the thing was again, I thought all the time,\nmy chil -- I can tell my children I\u2019]l try to get to them, because I have the ability. My\nmother could not leave that camp to come and get me, no matter what happened to\nme. If they told her your child is very sick in Marjelier, my mother could not walk\nout the door and say, well, I\u2019m going to my daughter, she needs me. I cou -- had the\nfreedom to go to my children, and I always told my kids that. I always told them that\ny -- what -- when you see anything done by state -- by a state, if you see a lynching,\nor if you hear a cross being burned on a lawn, that\u2019s one thing. That\u2019s a terrible and\nugly thing, but if you ever hear -- if you ever see this government pass a law, by\nstate, by state, that affects you, you get out. You do not wait, you run to the nearest\nexit. And they said -- they didn\u2019t understand. I said, it is when a government -- when\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\na head of state makes a statement against a group of people, it gives all the rest\npermission to act against that group. So if you ever hear a state -- head of state make\na statement, or if y -- Congress ever passes a law that\u2019s inimical to a group, you\nleave. You go wherever they will take you. You get out. Yeah, as my children grew\nup, I was very conscious of that. I always told them how grateful they should be, and\nhow much this country, good or bad has given them, and that it saved my life.",
        "A: Not at all. I feel absolutely American. My loyalties are totally to this country. I\nnever think about myself as a German, ever, ever. It\u2019s interesting -- not because I\ndeliberately did this, it was just a gradual progress. It was -- I never thought of\nmyself any more as German, I always thought of myself as Jewish. And by Jewish I\nhave tried to explain to my children, who are not religious, but are a -- very Jewish, I\nalways tell them that Jew -- being a Jew is not a religion. It is only partly that. Being\nJewish is -- is a State of mind. It is an -- a -- a -- a very -- it is a part of you, it\u2019s an\nattachment of you. It\u2019s something you cannot erase, it is just a fact. I said, you are a\nJew. It is genetic. It\u2019s almost like a genetic code, it is there. It is the 5,000 years of\nhistory. And -- and I think myself as a -- an American and as a Jew. Probably first as\na Jew, and then as an American.\nJanuary 4, 2002\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: I think that\u2019s one thing the Germans did for me is that they made me very\nconscious of Judaism and being a Jew. I think the fact that they hated -- hated Jews\nso much, and were -- I mean, the whole idea that they were -- that they wanted only\none thing, which was to kill all of us, to eradicate us completely, I think reinforced,\nin me at least, and I think in most Holocaust survivors, especially those who really\nsurvived the Holocaust in these -- in the camps, that they -- that -- that part of them\nre -- th -- I think the -- th-the -- the main thrust now is that they are Jewish. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean that they necessarily practice it, but their awareness of it, o-of being a\nJew. You s -- you asked me how I felt about Germany now, retrospectively? I feel\nthat Germany, tomorrow morning under Hitler, another Hitler could do the same\nthing. That has never changed in my -- my opinion has never changed that. The -- as\nI said before, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re unique in that. I think they have a parclivity --\nproclivity to do that, maybe a little faster, because once you\u2019ve committed murder,\nthe second time it makes it easier. I think their denials don\u2019t in any way impress me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nI think they\u2019re fully capable of relighting the ovens and doing it all over again. I\u2019m\nnot being bitter, I\u2019m simply saying what I believe. Hopefully their governments will\nnever permit that, because I think ultimately it 1s not the people who direct those\nactivities, it is the government that does it. And people, a -- the people respond to\nthat, to the government\u2019s edicts. Germany had behaved in an exemplary fashion in\nthe last 20 years. Their government has been democratic. The fr -- much more so\nthan the French do -- as far as I\u2019m concerned, the French were as rotten, in their own\nway, as the Germans were. I think ger -- France\u2019s conduct toward Jews during the\nsecond war is atrocious. The fact that they had a camp like -- camp like Gurs right\nin the middle of their country without protest, is outrageous. The fact that they\ntransported people by the hundreds of thousands across their country to these horror\nis -- 1S -- 1S an indictment against them. They\u2019ve never accepted their guilt. Only\nlately I think I\u2019m supposed to be getting 25,000 francs from them for transporting\nmy parents to Auschwitz. So I mean, the whole European -- the -- all of Europe --\nthe ur -- Austrians, for example, we -- you know, we talk about the Austrians and\nthe anschluss. The Austrians were no better than the Germans. I mean, all of\nEurope was corrupted by Hitler, but basically underneath it all, 1t could never have\nhappened, Hitler could have never achieved what he did if underneath it all wasn\u2019t\nthis enormous wave of anti-Semitism that was allowed to spread and to be acted on.\nJanuary 4, 2002\nThat is the calamity of the -- of -- of the second World War and the Jews; it is the\nfact that the Austrians, the Germans, the French, all the rest were allowed -- not only\nallowed but encouraged, to act on festering anti-Semitism that had been there for a\nvery, very long time. It didn\u2019t happen in 1933, it was there. It was simply allowed to\ncome to the surface full force and to be acted on in any way anybody saw fit.\nThere\u2019s a lot of anti-Semitism in this country. It is suppressed, it is never allowed to\nbe acted on. If it was suddenly allowed to be fr -- to -- to free flow, without any reins\nor checks, I don\u2019t know what would happen here.",
        "A: Well, Christianity, of course. I think when you have -- when you ha -- are the\nchild of a father, and I\u2019m talking about now Judaism versus Christianity, and the\nfather does not accept the child, in this case meaning Christ, that is an enormous slap\nin the face. Christians simply cannot understand why Jews do not accept Christ as a\ngodhead. That\u2019s the number one cause. And for hundreds of years there was this\nmyth promulgated that they -- that we killed, we the Jews killed this child, that\u2019s\nnumber one, this chi -- this godhead. Number two, the Jews have always been in\nprofessions that have been very much -- not necessarily in the professions, they have\nbeen the shopkeepers, where money has always been exchanged. They have been --\nthey were the ones who were sent out by the Poles and the Russians to collect taxes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nThey became the hated people who collected taxes. They had to collect them\nbecause their Christian bosses told them to go out. I think they -- and the fact that\nJews have had one philosophy, that is to educate, to educate and to educate. And\nthey have also done something else that we do, most societies don\u2019t do and we don\u2019t\ndo any more either, which is sad, is that they took the best and the brightest and they\nmarried their best and their brightest off to their best and brightest girls, and they\ngave them the education and those who were a little slower and not quite as bright\nwere put in the corner and say okay, be a good boy because your brother is the smart\none, he\u2019s got to learn. We did that, so we had -- we had genetically, probably,\nthrough hundreds of years had developed a group of people who were very bright,\naggressive, and because of our -- because of our -- the nature of our -- of our status\nin other countries, we\u2019ve become aggressive. We have -- we -- we -- we -- we feel\nthat we have to act in order to achieve. We have to push and shove in order to get\nanywhere, even when we don\u2019t have to. And I think there is a lot of resentment\nabout that. It\u2019s the same resentment that Americans begin to feel about Asians,\nbecause they\u2019re thrusting themselves into the forefront of education, of everything,\nand it\u2019s beg -- an-and it\u2019s -- and now the rest of Americans are beginning to resent\nthem. You always resent that. Anti-Semitism is a very, very old and sad story.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t want to go. Ai -- well, that\u2019s not true, I\u2019m starting to think. Ellen\nwent to Speyer and she -- she went to see for me, and she sent me back lots of\nthings that look familiar. So I\u2019m thinking maybe this year -- m-maybe not this year,\nbut certainly by -- maybe by the end of the year, I\u2019d like to go with my son, he said\nhe would go. Just to see where I lived, the house is still intact, everything is intact,\nthe synagogue 1s intact.",
        "A: One, yeah. Well, there may have been little ones, but that was the big one, that\nwas the main one. And would I go back? I think yes. My friend Lenore went back\nto Berlin, they actually paid for her to come, and -- she says otherwise she wouldn\u2019t\nhave gone. She says, I would have gone someplace else, but not there. But look, life\nis -- life is -- 1s -- is -- is a survival.

We are different.\nThere are distinct differences. I don\u2019t think -- I mean, I don\u2019t think my friends or\neven my children know. They think I\u2019m just like everybody else. But underneath it\nall, I think when you start scratching the surface there are this -- there are this --\nthere are things that make us, that set us apart. I never want that, you know, I think\nI\u2019ve s -- I think I strove very hard not to be a different -- I wanted to be a normalJanuary 4, 2002\nteenager. I wanted to be a normal wife and mother. I made very sure I dressed the\nsame, I acted the same, I -- I was very much the young American wife, you know. I\nthink it\u2019s obvi -- very, very important to me that I should not be any different. I\ndidn\u2019t want my children to feel that they had a mother who was, you know, a\nsurvivor. I mean the -- I-I never talked about it. I think -- and I always felt\nuncomfortable with the way people look at survivors. I mean, even I look at them --\nI mean, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not one of them. Oh, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that, where were you?\nOh, in Gurs? Must have been terrible, tell me all about it, you know? I mean, that\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019m saying, I never wanted to be like them. I never wanted -- I mean, I couldn\u2019t\n-- | -- if I\u2019d had the number, I would have never shown anybody the number. It took\nme years to understand that it wasn\u2019t my fault, I was not to blame for this. I didn't\nhave to assume the guilt for this. I felt guilty, so I didn\u2019t want anybody to know, or\nto remind me. I -- in some way being different may -- I felt guilty because I was\ndifferent. I felt guilty because it had happened to me and that -- I don\u2019t know how to\nexplain. It\u2019s like a child that gets beaten by a parent and they assume the guilt for the\nparent like they had done something wro -- well, I felt that maybe something had --\nwe had done something. This is what I said about anti-Semitism. What did we do\nthat we deserved this? We didn\u2019t do anything. My parents did nothing. Gunter\u2019s\nparents did nothing. I mean, my friends -- they -- we -- there was nothing that anyJanuary 4, 2002\nJew did that deserved them to end up as bones in a gas chamber. Nothing that they\ncould have done deserved this. And I think that the smugness of even some\nAmerican Jews when they say, well, you should have fought, you know, f-fight,\nfight what? It came like a bolt out of the blue. These were people living normal\nlives. My father did not keep an Uzi under his bed. And he was a non-violent man\nand he could never have de -- done anything. Yes, now, 50 years after the fact, you\nhave an Israeli army, and you do have men livin -- men and women in this country\nwho would not tolerate that being done to them. But that even -- but in my\ncommunity, where I live now, they wouldn\u2019t be prepared to fight an a -- a -- a -- a --\na -- the onslaught of a Nazi\u2019s raid. So, I mean, you know, it -- it\u2019s -- but I always felt\nthat I didn't want to be -- I always -- when I meet somebody who\u2019s gone through the\n-- through the whole scenario, which I did not, went to Auschi-schwitz, survived\nAuschwitz, the fact that they used to be able to talk about it so willingly\nembarrassed me.

I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember her because I think I blocked out\nthat thing.

I didn't want that. I wanted to be like them. I envied\nthem. I envied them being -- going -- I remember I used to -- I always had friends. I\nremember being envious of going to my girlfriend\u2019s house after school and having --\nwe used to have cookies or milk, or I had a friend who loved tomato soup. She\nwould open up cans of tomato soup for me, surely, and I would sit there and have\ntomato soup. And her mother would come in and she\u2019d bend down, she\u2019d kiss her.\nAnd she always patted me on the head, she always liked me. And say, girls, what\nelse do you want? But I envied her the normalcy. I never had that and I wanted my\nchildren to have that.

I didn\u2019t have the\nparents, you know, to make hi -- tomato soup. But -- and -- and again, it took me\nyears to understand, that as sad as that was -- and it was sad, it was sad for a little\ngirl not to have a mother and father. It was sad for me to have my first period and\nnot know what it was, to see the -- you know, to see it and not understand what was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n104January 4, 2002\nhappening to me. I thought -- I was ashamed that I had done something wrong,\nbecause -- you know. Finally somebody explained it. But, on the other hand, years\nlater when I used to listen to the stories of what went on in their lives, that looked so\nglorious to me from the outside, all the neurotic parents and the things that were\ngoing on behind closed doors which weren\u2019t so wonderful, I didn\u2019t know that at the\ntime. I might not have been so longing for it if I had known that with that -- with\neverything there comes a price. And you know, that being a -- a child, you know,\nthat my -- some of my friends had very tough lives of their own, with their parents.",
        "A: No, on my own. I -- it -- you know, th-through examine -- I guess examining\nmyself a little more and being a little more honest, I think we lied to ourselves so\nmuch, unconsciously.

And that\u2019s one of the reasons I never wanted to talk about it, because once\nJanuary 4, 2002\nI did talk about it, or mention anything like that, then I became different, and I didn't\nwant to be different.

I cannot -- I can\u2019t alter that, the terror, and the -- what I felt when I\nsaw my father weeping.

She had these magnificent big blue eyes, she was a\nbeautiful woman. Like, she looked -- she didn't look like my mother, but they were\nboth beautiful, really beautiful. Unusually pretty women. The way she looked when\nshe looked around, she said, wh-where\u2019s the bed? And my mother\u2019s tears when she\nrealized that her mother -- she thought her mother had had a stroke. I mean, -- and\non this horrible train. And the men banging, the soldiers banging on the window,\nsaying give us your jewelry or you\u2019re going to die. I mean, those things were real,\nand my sticking them somewhere there wasn\u2019t going to -- wasn\u2019t going to help me\nor my children. I finally sat my children down and said these are the facts of life,\nthis is what you need to know, this is what really happened. I want you to\nunderstand it. I\u2019m not saying -- telling you this cause I want -- expect you to feel\nsorry for your mother, because your mother is one of the lucky ones and I\u2019ve had a\ngood life.

And then when I got all this crap together for -- for the --\nFrance, I -- I did, I got hysterical. I was at Bonnie\u2019s house in Florida and she was\nXeroxing and she was looking at something and I looked at it and it was a transport\nlist. And I did, I just lost it.

But I\nhad to deal with it and I think that the Holocaust -- I -- I admire those people who\nsurvived. I admired what they achieved. I look at a man -- ooh -- I look at a man like\nWiesel, who is, I think the classic exponent of what human beings can survive and\nmake of themselves. And I listened to some of the -- and I\u2019ve listened to others, and\nI think to myself, they\u2019re so much braver than I was, because they faced it, and they\ndealt with it. I didn\u2019t.

        "A: Lots of things. Well, as I said, when I smell Gruyere cheese, it always reminds\nme of that trip. Dishwater. Dirty dishwater reminds me of Gurs because the soup\nsmelled strange, and I\u2019d smelled a little bit like th -- like cabbage-y. I think when I\nsee pictures of -- of -- there was a film with -- which I never an -- I never watch\nanything that has to do with the concentration camps ever, and I have not seen\n\u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d I do not -- I have not been to the Holocaust Museum, I haven\u2019t -\n- the only place I ever went to was Yad Vashem and that was very hard for me.

Well, we\nhad -- we had a young woman who had like a flute with her in Gurs, and she would\nplay occasionally. So when I hear those plaintive sounds, it reminds me. You n --\nyou never forget.

The thing I -- my mother\u2019s birthday and\nmy father\u2019s, I always, you know, think about them. I sometimes can\u2019t believe -- I\nstill can\u2019t believe that -- that -- one of the -- I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve heard this so many\ntimes, that I ha -- one of the things that I have never been able to grasp -- I\nunderstand it intellectually, but emotionally, how an -- bo -- how c-could I ever be\nthat angry, or that full of hate that I could take women and put them on a cattle carJanuary 4, 2002\nand let those people walk into an oven to die? Into a chamber to die? Could -- how\ncould that have happened? I mean, that\u2019s -- those are moot questions, they\u2019 ve been\nasked a million times. How did it happen and why\u2019d it happen. But I sometimes\nthink to myself, I was there, I saw these people. I understand that after awhile they\nlose their humanity. You do -- no longer look at them as human beings. They\u2019ve lost\nit. | mean, they\u2019ve become gray and dirty and with matter hair and they are no\nlonger these attractive people that maybe you saw the first time. After awhile they\nbec -- they shuffle, they don\u2019t walk any more, they have become vacant looking,\nthey have no expression in their eyes. But even so, can you do that? Can you tell\nsomebody -- send somebody to their death? Those are the questions I\u2019ve had about\nall this applica -- for th-these last 50 years. How can we -- how could that have\nhappened? How could it have happened to somebody like my mother, who was such\nan immaculate woman, to end her life that way? You know? Who was brought up\ncarefully by her own mother, and cherished? And yet, ended -- and had to die in that\nway, for what reason? An-And I -- I -- as I said, I became an agnostic when I was\n14, but not because of that. I must tell you, I never decided there was no God\nbecause -- and I still have not decided that because nobody can prove one way or the\nother. The only reason -- it\u2019s not because of my own rage, that had nothing to do\nwith it. It just seemed scientifically and logically impossible to me. I mean, it\u2019s like,January 4, 2002\nwhat did I hear, y-yesterday, somebody saying I can\u2019t really believe that people\naround there flapping with their win -- wings, there are just too many of them.

That is the -- that is the cry of -- of -- of grief and\nmourning, how could you let that happen to us, we are your chosen people. I always\nfelt that we would have been a lot better off if He\u2019d chosen the Chinese, but you\nknow, but the thing is, that isn\u2019t why I decided.

That is your first identity, a second\nidentity is that you are an American Jew. And I think that\u2019s a big difference. You\nknow, I am a Jew. I may not be religious, but I am a Jew all the way, and nobody -- I\nmean, that would be the first thing I would ever tell anybody, I am a Jew, and I\u2019m an\nAmerican. So I think there is, as I said, I think being Jewish is being like a\nstatehood, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very special thing to me. And I think\nthat I got from my father, because my father was a very bright man and also a\nphilosopher. I mean, he had a philosophy. He believed that -- he believed that -- that\nreligion brings with it other things. Pride in who you are, in your traditions, in the --\nin your -- in the knowledge, in what the -- the contributions that your -- your people\nhave made. I mean, if you really think about it, the Jews have contributed one-third\nof all the Nobel prizes winners in the world.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Well, my father was an avid -- my father was an avid reader, like I am. That\u2019s\none thing he and I shared. And the thing was that he also had enormous interest in\npeople, and he was very well liked. There was a -- there was a man, I don\u2019t know y -\n- are you interested in classical music? Okay, there was a man that used to be on\nevery Saturday night, cannot think of his name, I have his letter home, who used to c\n-- do a program on classical music, what was his name? Cliff? Anyway, he was\nfrom Speyer and he was on PBS every Saturday for an hour or two hours and I\nwrote him a letter once and he wrote me a letter back and he says, your father\ntrained me for my Bar Mitzvah. I mean, this is a very famous man, he came from\nNew York, I think he\u2019s dead now. Anyway, he says, your father was very nice, he\nsaid, but your mother was a lot prettier and I had a crush on her. But my father -- the\nonly thing he -- my father ever did for me -- to me that I didn\u2019t like is he made me\nplay the violin instead of the piano. But he always used to say to me, what you have\nin your mind is gold, because nobody can take it from you. He said, and for every\nword you learn, he says, you will get smarter, more intelligent. And I said, what do\nJanuary 4, 2002\nyou mean? He said well, he says, if you learn a new word today, he said, that means\nyou know that word and you will become more intelligent. He says, it\u2019Il help you.\nAnd it took me years to understand that. Then of course, then I read John Milton,\nand John Milton had said the same thing, vocabulary is a power. So I -- I -- that --\nyou know, he was just -- I miss not have known -- I miss not having known him as\nan adult, because as a child you hold -- talk to your parent in a different way than I\nwould have, let\u2019s say if he had -- if I had gotten to know him as an adult and he and I\ncould have shared adult thoughts. And that I never had the chance to do.",
        "A: Well, my uncle came -- my uncles -- my whole family -- I mean, the family came\nfrom Germany -- I mean, from New York, God. And his foster parents gave it to\nhim -- well, at that time we were still with Snowhites, so sh -- they gave it. And of\ncourse, it was really nice. We -- he was -- a Bar Mitzvah at an -- an Orthodox\nsynagogue. There was a party for him. He was shorter than I was at that time, then\nhe grew to be six feet tall. And he was very excited, he did very well. And the thing\nI remember, he wore this navy blue suit, you know, how little boys dress for -- and\nhe was reading the Haftorah and he really did very well, and I think -- and I\nremember my f -- my -- m-my uncle looked at me -- and I\u2019m sure he wa -- I mean,\nwe were all thinking about my father, I mean, that he\u2019s -- could not be there, I mean,\n115\nJanuary 4, 2002\nhe would have trained his own son, you know, for the Bar Mitzvah himself -- that\nhe couldn\u2019t be there. But I have to tell you, my Uncle Heinz came to my son\u2019s Bar\nMitzvah, too. And when my son stood up to go -- you know, to -- to -- and I -- they\ncalled his father and I up to the Bima. And I remember, of course, I remember what\nI wore. I wore a suit about the color of Jacqueline Kennedy\u2019s, which she wore to\nTexas, that color pink, and I wore a big hat. I really looked great that day. And I\nlooked very young. I mean, you know, everybody thought I looked like I was 20.\nAnd we -- I stood up there with him, and when I looked down the tears were rolling\ndown my uncle\u2019s face. And I said to him afterwards, I said, Uncle Heinz, I said,\nwhy were you crying? He says, I thought of how you -- your father would have\nloved the way your son looked, you have a beautiful son, and how you looked. I\nsaid, I know. Well, I remember my Tante Betty, she was a cousin of my mother\u2019s,\nwe were walking down the aisle when I was getting married to -- to Walter. I wore\npale blue slipper satin, it was a beautiful gown, and my Uncle Heinz paid for all that\ntoo. He was, as I said, rich. Anyway, I didn\u2019t know how rich he was then. I wish I\nhad. Anyway -- anyway, I\u2019m walking down the aisle and of course everybody -- I\ndon\u2019t have to tell you, I\u2019m walking down the aisle with my uncle, and of course\neverybody in -- it was down at the Luxemburger Temple in -- in New York, and\neverybody knew, oh poor Margaret, poor little orphan, poor little thing, you know,\nJanuary 4, 2002\nand I knew it and I held my head up very high. And my Aunt Margaret had given\neverybody orders to control themselves, you know. Except my Tante Betty. As I am\nwalking down the aisle I hear this shriek. [indecipherable] I thought to myself,\nstupid woman. And -- you know, she was always very melodramatic. I lost two\ncrowns and I feel very self-conscious -- at -- and I didn\u2019t lose them, thank God, I\nmean the two -- four crowns, actually, the whole thing came out yesterday. Four\nthousand dollars if I\u2019d lost them. Anyway, yeah, she as shrieking at the wedding,\nand my -- Walter turned around to me afterwards -- and I remember thinking my\nknees were shaking so much, I was so nervous, you know, and I remember Walter\ndidn\u2019t want to laugh, because he heard it, this Margitt. Anyway, so I -- aft -- so I --\nthat part, you know, I\u2019m -- it\u2019s sad that my father never had a chance to see his\ngrandchildren or even his son, or my mother. Now, when I was little, I went upstairs\nonce to the attic. We had a huge house, it was three stories. There, Gail, believe it or\nnot, was a chest, a hope chest that was yay high, maybe two and a half feet high and\nmaybe 70 inches across. In that hope chest were sheets, beautiful, lace embroidered\nsheets with my initial on it and a space for where my husband\u2019s would go. Towels.\nEverything ever was so gorgeous I couldn\u2019t wait to get married. I never wanted to be\nmarried, but I thought this it beautif -- and now I -- you know, I used to think -- that\nwas another thing that used to piss me, excuse me. Who got my sheets? Who was\n117January 4, 2002\nusing M.G. with a little space for the husband? AII these things. My mother\u2019s\nsterling silver. All her bu -- beautiful things gone. You know, these were material\nthings, I mean, they don\u2019t make up for a life. But when you -- but it -- she had to\nthink about that. I mean, I -- I would be thinking -- h-how -- what did she think\nabout in the concentration camp? What did she think when she went -- got to\nAuschwitz? What were 1 -- ow -- I mean, if there is an afterlife. Those are the\nquestions I have. What did they feel like? What did they think once my brother and I\nwere gone? What did they think when they saw us on that train going to -- you\nknow, these little children, all these little children hanging out of the train, you\nknow, and looking bewildered. And so many of them were -- you know. How did\nthat mother feel who let her little seven year old go -- six or seven year old child go,\nyou know, and she was alone. She was alone, she had no husband. But I would -- I --\nI thought about that. I think about it, what if my father\u2019s -- if he was dying -- if he\nhad died of a heart attack and didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s one thing. But suppose he wa --\nhad been dying -- suppose he died -- suppose these people died, they knew they\nwere dying, the men, or the women, and they were leaving their mate behind to face\nsomething dreadful alone. At least if they had each other, there was some support.\nYou were not alone in your fear, but if you had -- if you were a husband and you\nwere dying and you were leaving your wife alone to face whatever there was comingJanuary 4, 2002\n-- and I think by now they knew about Auschwitz. They had to know, they had to\nknow that the camp was being emptied out. Where were all these people going?\nThey were not going home. So they knew they were going someplace terrible.",
        "A: My brother -- I approached my brother several times and my brother\u2019s word to\nme always was, I don\u2019t remember. There are a few things that he remembers. He\nremembers Marseilles. I think he does not remember Marjelier. He remembers\nvery little of Gurs, but he remembers. But he remembers very little -- if I remem --\nmention people to him, he doesn\u2019t remember them. I knew he did not remember\nGunter Katz at all. He didn\u2019t remember Truda. He --",

Which was true.\nMy mother was firm. I mean, she had -- it was her way or no way. But he was a very\nfragile child. I mean, even before that, I think he was a very sensitive little boy, and\nI think he probably suffered in -- more than I did. Certainly he had more -- it had\nmore of -- of -- a -- me -- well, he\u2019s not intro -- inpu -- he -- it would not be -- he\u2019sJanuary 4, 2002\nnot introspective. He does not look into things.

        "A: Only English. He doesn\u2019t remember one word of German. Not a word. Nothing.\nThat\u2019s what I meant when I said he just wiped the slate clean, but I mean clean. He -\n- I said to him something once about Gurs and he says, I don\u2019t remember. And I\nsaid something about coming over here in the Safir Pinto, he says, I remember\nbeing really seasick. I said, you were terribly sea -- he was very seasick. But that\u2019s\nit. He remembers being with his foster parents very well. From that moment on, he\nremembers everything. I mean, he remembers everything when he came to this\ncountry. Once he was here, his memory is perfect. It was just those time before that,\nhe just doesn\u2019t remember.",

I think I had -- I\u2019d seen Shirley\nTemple in \u201cPoor Little Rich Girl.\u201d I expected to move into this little mansion, you\nknow, and have a nice little butler named Arthur Treacher taking care of me. I\nnever expected to, you know. So -- oh, I had illusions of grandeur too, and I was\nvery immature in that sense, too.

I\nwas, I was 12 years old, but I was, you know, starting to develop and -- and it wa --\nit -- it happened when I came back from the convalescent home, so I was already\nalmost 13.

        "A: No.",
        "A: I never told Mrs. Beser, whom I saw once a month. I never told a soul. And I did\nnot tell a soul for years and I\u2019m telling you for the first time, except maybe my\ndaughter. I just never talked about it. It -- now, you know, now of course it\u2019s\nwonderful cause girls can talk, but in those days, who would have believed me? This\nwas a very respectable man. They would have thought I was making it up. Nobody\nJanuary 4, 2002\nwould have believed me and for years I wouldn\u2019t say anything, I wouldn\u2019t have said\nanything. Because of -- the chances are that somebody would have thought it was --\nI was lying and I was -- I was afraid. And as I said, he never really harmed me. L --\nit -- when I told Walter, he believed me. I mean, Walter knew that I would never,\nnever lie about something and I -- just there was no reason for me to. Look, I had a t\n-- | had a doctor once, and -- who became very famous, his name was Edgar\nBerman. He wa -- became a famous surgeon, he took my tonsils out when I was 16\nyears old, and he was doing something with my -- on my boob, I thought it was part\nof the exam. It wasn\u2019t until I was married that I understood that this is not part of an\nexam. But he was doing it, talking to me the whole time, never paid any attention,\nyou know? And so I mean, wi -- girls, you know, I -- we don\u2019t -- that -- that didn\u2019t\nupset me at all because I thought it was -- I had been examined so much in my life\nand I had so much blood taken and so many EKGs taken and so much stuff, that I\njust thought it was something new for the tonsillectomy, that 1t was part of that. And\nit took me, when I was married, about three fo -- I never told Walter about that one.\nI told him enough abou -- but I, you know, I think most young women have an\nunfortunate experience somewhere along in their lives before they are married, that\nsomebody tries something. So it is nothing unusual, nothing exceptional happened to\nme. It was not a rape, it was nothing brutal like that. It was just a guy who was, IJanuary 4, 2002\nthink maybe not -- I wouldn\u2019t call -- certainly would not have called him a\npedophile. I just think he was -- I was a young woman growing into maturity and\nthat wa -- and I was in his house, probably, you know, running around in -- in a slip\nwithout thinking. I don\u2019t know.

        "A: No. No, no, no, no, why would they do that? They pay for nothing. There are no\nreparations from Germany. Germany only did it for property, and I got something\nfor my house years and years ago. Probably I mishandled that -- my brother and I\ndid. But, you know, the thing is, they -- they did pay reparations, are you ready for\nthis, to Israel -- to these -- to Israel, is they sent Mercedes-Benz, mer -- that -- I\ncould never understand that, why did they do that? As -- as an atonement for what\nthey did?",

I mean, as I said before, I\u2019ve all -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve\nconsidered myself an American from the get-go.

And then as they got older I told\nthem that both their p -- all four of their grandparents died in concentration camps --\nWalter\u2019s did, too. So, I said, this is what happened, and then they began to\nunderstand. I mean, you know, they un -- my children are unusual in the sense they\nhad four grandparents die in a concentration camp.

I mean, my feelings for mist -- well,\nthe thing that impressed me about Eichmann is number one, the way they got him.\nAnd my fervent regret that they never got Mengele. But I also felt that he represents\nto me what I said again earlier, that Germany, under the right kind of Fuhrer could\nabsolutely revert right back to 1932 without any question, because Eichmann was\ntotally, totally unremorseful. He was -- did not regret one thing that he did. The only\nthing he regretted is that he was caught. He had -- he -- he felt absolutely justified in\nwhat he did, which is the -- the horror of the whole thing, is -- 1s what I's -- wa --\nJanuary 4, 2002\nyou know, how can you do this to another human being, I asked? Well, Eichmann\nthought that was absolutely justified. That is what\u2019s so terrifying. Not that these\npeople did things that were aga -- went against the grain. These people did things\nthat they felt were for the greater good of -- for all. This was for the greater good of\nGermany. They were doing by the -- the -- the -- the -- the ends justified the means\n-- or the means justified the ends, whatever. The point was that they felt what they\nhad done was the thing to do. And that\u2019s what\u2019s frightening. When people do things\nthat go against them, somewhere they begin to break down. Somewhere their\nconscience begins to catch up with them, but not if you really believe you\u2019re doing\nthe right thing. Then you just go on. And Eichmann sat in that chair in frozen, like\nglacial calm, because he was right and they -- his -- th-the people, his accusers, were\nwrong. He was convinced of that. And he went to his death believing it. So Iam\nconvinced that if tomorrow morning a new regime -- I mean, look what the Germans\nhave continued doing to the Turks. I mean, whatever their doing to their -- to\nforeigners, it 1s there. That absolute belief that somewhere along the way, they have\nachieved some kind of superiority.

That human beings need to take care of each other, respect each\nother. I\u2019m not asking them to love each other, because that\u2019s really hard to do, but at\nleast have respect and trust. If we have a sense of trust of each other, even if -- when\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 4, 2002\nthere\u2019s betrayal, and there is bound to be betrayal between peoples, but if there 1s\nsufficient trust left, we can survive.

We have not learned it in this year of 2002, we are -- you know, the -- let\nme end up on a note ma -- of a man much wiser than I will ever be. Thucydides\nwrote a book called \u201cThe Peloponnesian Wars.\u201d And the book was written, I\nwould say, 1500 to 2000 B.C.. And he opens the book -- and I\u2019m paraphrasing\nbecause I\u2019m not as clever as Thucydides. He said, we are once again engaged in a\ngreat war, because we have not learned from the past. This man wrote this 4,000\nyears ago. And we begin the year 2002, once again engaged in great wars all over\nthis globe. We haven\u2019t learned anything. And I think if my experience and those\nwho came before me and those who will come after me, will teach anyone, it\u2019s that\nwe heed to learn to trust each other and to know something about justice and\ndecency toward each other.
