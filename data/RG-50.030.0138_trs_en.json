        "Q: Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born?",
        "A: My name is Masha Loen. I was born in Lithuania, Kovno, 1930. I lived near Kovno in a\nsuburb called Slobodka before the war. I came from an average home. In Yiddish they\nwould say Balle Batish, middle class. My father was a good tailor, maybe would have\ncalled a designer here and made a good living and I had two little sisters and one older\nsister than I am. We were four girls. One of them was born in ghetto. There was only\nthree girls before the war, and no boys. And what I can tell about my childhood...I went\nto school. I went to private school, called Kommerz Gymnasium (ph). I was thrown out\nof public school. It so happened that I I have a terrible temper and the teacher said\nsomething to me and I didn't like it and I took the my book and I threw at the desk. On\naccident I think it hit her nose. So my grandfather pushed me into a private school\nsomehow and I enjoyed it. I went to school everyday by bus. We came back. We came\nback home. We played games. We played soccer ball they called in Lithuania and we\nmade Jewish friends mostly and in the winter we were ice skating. That was the main\nsport of Lithuania in the winter for kids and grown-ups too, and like I said, everything\nwas going on just as it 1s till 1940, when the Russians came in first to Lithuania. They\ngave us Vilna, the capital back and at that time when I was in Kovno, a lot...we had some\nrefugees from Austria and from Poland that had relatives in Kovno so they came and we\nhelped them with clothes and everything else and I had a Austrian little girl friend by the\nname of Levine, Anna Levine. I will never forget that and I came to my grandfather. My\ngrandfather was better off than we were and I said, Zayde, I need a bicyclet, you know, a\nbicycle for my girlfriend Anna. He said you know, Maraska (ph), I can't afford to buy her\na new one but we'll manage something, and you know, he found a bicycle and put on a\nnet in the back, and matched mine...very so much that I liked hers better than mine, and\nshe was a beautiful girl. A very well-behaved child. My mother loved her very much\nbecause she thought it was good influence on me and I don't know what happened to her.\nI absolute don't know. I lost touch with her when I went into ghetto because I had so\nmuch on my mind. When the war broke up in 1941, my sister, my oldest sister that 1s four\nand a half years older than I am, was a Communist, and she somehow came to us and she\nsaid run,\n01:04:\nbecause I'm running. And she disappeared and we packed up whatever we could and we\nran. My little sister was, , the little...the youngest, was about six years, seven\nyears younger than I am and we start running and before we even reached about twenty,\nthirty kilometers...the Germans were ahead of us, and my grandmother was running and\nmy uncle was running, and my uncle at one time was living in Memel that was occupied\nby the Germans and he came back to Kovno and he said, we have to get away. We cannot\nstay. So we were running, but the running didn't help. They overtook us, so we snuck\nvery quietly back into Kovno and I lived in Slobodka and what I can tell you is it it\nhappened to me I an experience today that with that . I, we walked into our\nhome and everything was like blood lying all over the house. Nobody was killed because\nnobody was in the house. I don't know how the blood get got there and then the neighbors\nall around the district... many many Jews got killed. In fact later on I heard from the\ngrown-ups accidentally there was there was a head from the child and a breast from the\nmother standing on a piano because the Lithuanians said the pogrom before the Germans\neven came in, and today of all days I met a righteous Lithuanian woman and admired her\nmore than anybody else that from so many murderers like the Lithuanians, one woman\ncould come out and hide a one and a half year old child. I don't know if she got paid for it\nor what happened. I didn't want to ask questions but I did ask her and I feel badly. Maybe\nI hurt her, if she had more problems from her neighbors than from the Nazis, because the\nLithuanians, like I said, were very very bad. They collaborated with the Germans in\nevery way and did a lot of things that the Germans didn't do and asked them to do to the\nJews. To find one that saved really a child is a miracle and I shouldn't have said it. I felt\nbadly later on, because she answered, in every nationality and every religion are different\nkind of people. I wanted to tell her yes, but not so in Lithuanian but I already kept my\nmouth shut and didn't say anything because it happened as they said...there was the Riga\nAktion, there was the Estonia Aktion. Every time they took out...first they killed a lot\nof...the first thing they killed is the intellectuals in Kovno. So being a child I didn't know\nthat, learned after the war, but what I remember is the Riga Aktion. I was working, as an\nolder child. I was always acting like...when the war started I was not going on eleven...I\nwas going on forty, because I had to grow up. I had to grow up because of the blood that\nthey saw and the thing that was going on and here is my mother with two...with pregnant,\nexpecting another child and I didn't know, you know, in which world I am. Am I forty?\nAm I eleven? Am I fifteen? Sometimes I cried like a baby and sometimes I acted like a\ngrown-up that nobody can touch me. I was untouchable, and what happened is is that my\nuncle, Menashke Saposhnikov, my father's brother, was one of the leaders of the\nunderground and when the Riga ghet...and we had a bunker. It was in my grandfather's\nhome that you went through a baker's oven and you went in there. In fact the\nunderground some of their equipment kept in that bunker. They knew about the Kinder\nAktion. I walked at night in the ghetto Werkstatten, the ghetto works, you know, what\nthey did knitting and they did sewing and all different kind of things and they came to\npick me up to run me into the bunker because they knew somehow, the underground\nknew there was going to be an Aktion and they are taking people to Riga. And as we get,\nas there was an Aktion...first it was the...no, I'm sorry, I have to go back...first there was\nthe the Kleine Aktion. That was from the small ghetto. There was a bridge and they\nliquidated the small ghetto. Then there was the aktion from one section where I lived and\nthat time they took away my grandfather...both my grandfathers, both my grandmothers,\nuncles, aunts and so on and I tell you something - I could have saved them, but I came\ntoo late. They came in. The Kommandatur, the German command was not far from us\nand I had a little cousin...my uncle and aunt live now in Vilna...1t was their\ndaughter,Dveirele, and she came in and she said: Tante Michle...German...poup, poup,\npoup. She saw those German near the Kommandatur, and she saw them with their rifles,\nwhatever they had at that time - I don't remember, and my mother says, and she was, you\nknow, the little flour that she had she was baking...it was a Friday...and she was\nscrubbing the floor, and said get out\n01:10:\nof my way, and all of a sudden in about ten minutes, the Germans came in with the\nshotguns and pushed us out of the house and at that time my father, like I said, he was a\nbetter tailor...worked for Jordan of the ghetto...at that time he was the head of the ghetto,\nKovno ghetto, and he was sewing for him and we got some sign [document] called the\nLebensschein. And that is a sign to be alive and it was hanging in our kitchen in a little\nbasket and she yells to me, Maruska, go get the , the...to be alive...the\nLebensschein. So I ran into the house and I grabbed the Schein and I come out and my\nmother wasn't there, and then there was a big street that they took us to the field and that\nstreet was the border how many people they took out, and there were people going by the\ndozens, carrying children and so on, and I want my mother, so I stand up in the middle of\nthe street and I start yelling...this is why I tell you I grew up so fast... Momma, Momma,\nMomma...so a German start beating me and he said get off the street. I'll shoot you right\nthere. I said no. I have Judenschein. You cannot shoot me, like I was something special. I\nthought I was something special. He says get off there and all of a sudden from about I\ndon't know how many feet away to tell you...maybe a block away...I heard my mother's\nvoice yelling Maruska, Maruska...and I run to her. When we came to that field where\nthey're they're separating...right, left, right, left...1 found out that one Judenschein can\nsave one family, and I had four of them, because I had three from us and one for my\nfather that was out to work in the brigade, so I kept running around between the people,\nbut they already took away both my grandmothers and both my grandfathers. There were\nnobody left from my family that was living right there in that section, so what I did is I\nsaid Momma, what should I do. She said start grabbing people. Start giving them the\nJudenschein. My mother always thought of somebody else. She was a beautiful lady, not\nbecause she was my mother, but as I grow up and I don't think I'm that nice and people\nsay I'm a nice person but I don't think so, because I don't, wouldn't have had the guts to\ntell my daughter to run around with life, life depends on and start grabbing people and\ngiving them Judenschein and then you don't even know if you would get it back from\nthem, but if people were nice enough when we came back on the right side, on the good\nside, they did give me back the Judenschein and this is one day part of my life, of my\nchildhood. And that was the first aktion...that was the second one and then it was the\nRiga aktion. I couldn't tell you really one after another because I blank out or I may go\nback from time to time to tell you. Is that alright?",
        "Q: That's fine.",
        "A: And then came the big Aktion, October 28th, 1941. It was...I don't know...I can't tell you\ndates really and that\nwas called the Grosse Aktion, the big aktion. And they went from home to home and they\ntold everybody please leave your sick ones at home and Jordan wants to hold a speech.\nWe want you on this and this field. Leave your sick ones home and everybody has to be\nat this and this time on that field. So my mother was pregnant and one of my uncles that\nmy aunt was taken away in the first aktion that I told you, had something very swollen on\nhis face and we didn't know what it was. He came with us. Some of my aunts were\nseparated. My mother's sister that we lived in the same house was separated from us, but\nmy father's brother and my father's brother that was in the underground kept yelling at\nmy father...he was a painter...and my father took him in and showed him how to sew and\nhe worked with him in the Jordan Brigade as a tailor, so we came and we came on that\nbig field and they start sorting and Jordan never showed up. They surrounded us with\nmachine guns and they start sorting...right, left, right, left. And Hessel, I think it was\nHessel his name - I don't know for sure - I can't remember. He was the right hand of\nJordan. He comes up to my father and says you Bruder Schneidermeister, you brother\ntailor. Take your family and go. So my father started looking for people...you know for\nfamily, but there was no family around except my uncle with that big face and he said\nwhat's the matter with him. He says oh, he had a toothache. It will be pulled out, and my\nfather saw that there's nobody from our family so he start dragging people that were\nbehind and in front of us and my mother and me, and he had such a smirk on his face...I'll\nnever forget...and they said all this is your family? And my father saved a lot of strangers\nand we all went and a lot of my aunts went away. A lot of people went away to the Ninth\nFort, and what the most terrible thing about the Ninth Fort or the Seventh Fort was in\nKovno is that at night we heard the shooting of the people. The machine guns were going\n't-t-t-t-t-t-t' and what I found out...now these things what I'm going to tell you now\nI found out after the war...is that they were not shooting one person into the grave. They\nwere shooting two or three at a time to save bullets and that were open graves and then\nthey would put a chemical over it and burn them, and some people after it got dark ten\nthousand people to shoot into the graves, it took time, by the time they sorted us out and\neverything, so they didn't have a chance to burn them. Some of them got themselves out\nand came back into the ghetto, and this is how we find out what had happened, so what\nthey called portable crematoriums in Sobibor and they called portable crematoriums in\nother death camps...that why when I talk about the Kovno ghetto I don't talk it as a\nghetto. I talk it as the concentration camps. I talk about Stutthof as the death camp,\nbecause we did have portable crematoriums in the Ninth Fort. We did have portable\ncrematoriums in the Seventh Fort. They didn't have to have the oven. They just shot them\nin. At that time they still had bullets. They shot them in and then burned them. So if they\ncan call a portable crematorium why couldn't we call the portable crematorium on\nthe Ninth Fort. Do you think I'm wrong? So this is what I call...when I talk to some\npeople where they ask me about experiences, I don't talk really like a ghetto, because a\nghetto is a concentration of certain people that, ethnic people and so on, and I don't call\nthis a ghetto because being without food, being without clothes, being eliminated\nconstantly, thousand, ten thousand, five thousand...and then buried practically alive in a\nportable crematorium...you couldn't call this a ghetto. You called this a concentration\ncamp, and then we were sent to the death camps. Now I want to tell you one story that I\nalways talk about and that's the children aktion. The children...1 was working in the\nghetto works...everything happens that they, that should happen, like today I'm here in\nWashington with a broken leg, but that's alright. Everything happens that should happen.\nI came to my father. You see the Jordan brigade, it was moved to the ghetto works and\nmy father was working in town. You know, you would trade some things for some food\nand the Jordan brigade, it was well-know that it was bringing food into ghetto and would\nshare. My mother of course shared it with with everybody before she gave it to us. My\nfather shared it with his family. So you had food to eat, more than the average person, so\nwhat happened is when they put the Jordan brigade into the ghetto into the ghetto works,\nthey had a separate room. They had a window into the ghetto and everything was...they\nhad it better than anybody. The ghetto works but it still was not in to town, so that day in,\nvery early in the morning, there's a . You know what...I would like to go out into\ntown, in a brigade I said maybe I can bring something in because it's getting to the point\nthat the kids are starving, you know. And they said...not starving but not enough food\nto...you know, we did our best. And he said you know what...I said you have protection.\nYou go in. You talk to the Arbeitsamt, to the Komitet in the ghetto works, so he went in\nand it was already late, and he said to me...that one of the men said, he says, you know,\nHerr Saposhnikov, he says, there is one brigade, a German and six girls to clean up a\nhouse...would you daughter be happy to do that? He said my daughter would be very\nhappy to do it, so it happened that we left late and as we were walking out of the\nghetto...of course every girl was older than I was, that worked in the ghetto works...we\nsaw some black machines coming into the ghetto but no windows. Just painted little\nwhite windows. And I said to the girls, oh, that looks funny. There's something rotten in\nDen...I didn't know about Denmark...I was too young to know about, you know, Hamlet\nor whatever it is...and I said there's something wrong. Why are those machines coming in\nthe ghetto. I a little panic, keep quiet...they're coming in...they're bringing some\npeople maybe from a different ghetto or something, so I kept quiet and we went to the\nGerman's house, and we cleaned up the house and there were six girls and we were six\ngirls...they had two Germans watching us and the brigadier, the Jewish fellow that went\nwith us, so there was no way of us going out into the town and trade something for bread\nor milk or things like that, so what happened is that I ......how long does it take to clean\nup a house, as even if you're weak and don't eat all day and everything. Still it doesn't\ntake long. Six girls. So what we did is we didn't know what to do...we start dancing and\nsinging and dancing the horah and I never danced the horah in my life, but it was some\nolder people and they knew about the horah and they start dancing the horah so the\nGermans walk in and said, you're through? It's time to take you back. Fine. We couldn't\ntrade anyways so something to bring in to ghetto so they took us back and that\nLithuanian woman was wrong when she said every nation or anything. When we came to\nthe ghetto gate, there was like a Lithuanian with a gun, a machine gun on one part and a\nGerman about maybe like from here to the vase here with another machine gun. A\nLithuanian and a German, and the whole thing, the whole ghetto was surrounded and we\nwalk into the ghetto gate and there is none of our Jewish policemen. There is none of the\nsame German when we walked out. There was different Germans, completely different,\nand something is very quiet on that street. The ghetto isn't moving. Everything was like\nin slow motion. And I and a man that was with the Arbeitsamt, the uncle Jankele\nGoldovsky comes out from behind that booth near the gate where the Germans were\nstanding. He said, girls, you came at the worst time. It's twelve-thirty. They are taking\naway all children, all people over forty-five, fifty he says, and they don't have the quota.\nThey're taking everybody. And as we walk out from that booth, we saw about four White\nRussians, Germans, coming with machine guns...started, it was a very very long street. It\nwent through, all through the ghetto, that street where the, where the gate was. And they\nsurrounded us. They surrounded us and they start walking with us and I know I walked\nby that little Kommandatur, our little houses, and I know...oh, my God. My mother is at\nhome. Even now I get goose pimple even if I talk about it. My mother is at home with the\ntwo kids. What can I do? Shall I run? Shall I make a run for it? Go see what happened?\nAnd from far away I saw a friend of mine, Susa, with her mother, standing outside a\ndoor, and I couldn't do nothing and I start giggling. I didn't know what happened to me,\nand the , the German, he says to me, ah, laugh...in German...laugh as much as\nyou want. In a half an hour the sun will not shine for you anymore. And I walked. We\nwalked and they take us to this...and there were some big, big apartment houses in ghetto\non that street, and they walk us to those machines that I will never forget. They tried to\nput us into machine and one girl practically had one foot up on it, and there was a\nman...I'll never forget him - Regal (ph) was his name, a German man. He had his hand in\na sling and it's his house that we cleaned and he says, ah, nein, no. These girls belong to\nthe ghetto works. Take them back. He saw us from upstairs, where all the Germans were\nsitting. He recognized one of the girls. I don't know what he did, and we got four people,\nfour German again...different ones. They took us back to the ghetto works, and what I tell\nyou 1s the ghetto works....there are two barracks. One on one side or like barracks or like\nplaces that work, and one on the other side and in the middle was like a big, big street,\nand we walked to the ghetto works and we walk in. No Jewish policemen. Not the same\nGermans. Completely new people, and they walk us into one of the places and I see some\ndead bodies, not lying on the...1n between the two barracks, and some guy that I fix a\nsweater for him - I thought he was, you know, war, how do you call it - prisoner of war,\nall of a sudden is wearing a German uniform with a with a machine gun. And we walk in\nto that room and everybody from the people, all the people asking what is happening in\nghetto, what is happening in ghetto. I said, because they had no windows out into the\nghetto and I said, we don't know what's happening in the ghetto. What's happening here?\nAll we know is that somebody told us they are taking away...they didn't say we\nknow...they're taking away all the children, old people over a certain age, and anybody\nthat's sick - they're taking them away. And I know my father's on the other side, and I\nknow my mother's home with the two kids, my two little sisters, and I didn't know what\nto do, and I came to him and he said, oh my, Maruska, he says, come on - I'll take you to\nyour father. And the women that were friends of my mother and my brother are dragging\nme back. She says don't go. The minute somebody walks out or he beats them up or he\nshoots them. I said but I have to go to see my father, I said. And I fixed him - I told you I\nfixed him a sweater for him and I was very good to him and he says, Maruska, tell me. I\nknow you have two little sisters. Tell me where they are. I'll go and help you. And you\nknow, sometimes I was eleven but sometimes like I told you I was forty, and my mind\nstart working. I said oh no. He's wearing a German uniform. He's having a gun. Even if I\nI tell him one word...I said you know I don't live with my mother anymore. I'm grown up.\nI have my own place. He said you never told me that. He said would you like to see your\nfather? I said, yes, very much. And again, my mother's girlfriends and my father's friends\nare dragging me back into the other side, and I thought to myself, what do I have to loose.\nMy mother and my two little sisters are not there anymore. I want to see my father.\nand . And it so happened, like one time a doctor told me I have nine\nlives...I have to figure out how many more times before I broke my leg again...and he\ntook me to my father. And you know, the most God-forsaken thing I've ever seen is eight\nmen holding their head on their...hands on their head, walking around and crying like\nbabies because through their window, through the Jordan break out a window, you could\nsee the way the Germans are dragging, with hand grenades...they were opening the\nbunkers that children were hidden. They were dragging old people and everyone in that\nroom had somebody, had children, had a wife at home, or had somebody because they\nwere working for the Jordan brigade and they were protected a little bit with that. And\nwhat do I do? All of a sudden I turn eleven again. I put my hand on my head and I start\ncrying and I start following them. At three o'clock they called off the Kinderaktion and I\nand my father stopped running, and I told you before my Uncle Menashke Saposhnikov\nwas one of the leaders of the underground, so they had to run by their home, so my aunt\nwas lying and bleeding...they took away his two little boys, and my other aunts were\nhelping her and I grabbed my father's arm and we start running in, and we run into this\nlittle house...was a peasant house where my mother was with two kids, and there is no\nsound, nothing. And I stopped crying. I said, Papa, they're dead. Papa, they're \"toit\". And\nall of a sudden we heard from upstairs, \"knock\", \"knock\", \"knock\", - knock. And my\nmother says quiet. They're not dead. And she opened up that little board that she had, and\nshe dragged down the two kids, and they were completely out...I think a little bit over-\ndosed. She gave them sleeping tables, and she tells us what happened. I practically and\nmy father fainted right there. And she said, the machines were driving around the ghetto\nand saying, everybody stay in their house. Anybody that comes out gets shot. And she\ndidn't know what to do. So she took these sleeping tablets and she gave it to the kids, she\nbroke open a little board in there. She, she was thinking fast. She dragged them up. She\nput them flat. Dragged herself up, tipped over the tables so the sand should fall off it\nbecause sand came down, and she was lying with them, so when the Germans came in to\nlook if there's children or anybody in the house, they didn't see nothing and they were\nalready dead asleep and my mother was still lying flat, but they had picks. They went into\nthe floor and they went into the top with the picks. In fact one of my little sister was just\ngrazed, and she pushed them from one side to the other, and she was also afraid to push\nthem because in case the sand start coming down but the Germans thought the sand was\ncoming down from their picks. I\n01:32:\nrealize it now...of course I didn't know it at that time, you know, but she was afraid at that\ntime. And she had a little hole that she saw this machines. She saw those mothers taking\nthe kids to the, to those to those machines. And people dragging them and the mothers,\nthey didn't want to give the children up, was being beaten or a dog sent on her, and she\nsaved my two little sisters. Now there was a rumor that...she was a brave lady. She was a\nbeautiful lady. Good, brave, and that they don't have the quota. It's going to go on again.\nSo I said Momma, let me up with the children, up there, and you go in to the ghetto\nworks on my papers. She said no, you go with your poppa. You're going to be missed and\nthere's going to be something not kosher, and we went away, and she stayed with the\nchildren up there, and they called off again the aktion later on and she saved those two\nlittle sisters, and I'm selfish enough to think if my mother wouldn't have saved my two\nlittle sisters, maybe she would have been alive for a little while longer because she was a\nvery young woman. Because when we were, when the ghetto was liquidated and we were\nsent into the death camp, to Stutthof, they separated her with the two kids and they took\nher away. At that time, to tell you the truth, I didn't know what a crematorium means. I\ndidn't even know what a crematorium 1s. I know one thing is that when they were still\nalive and the ghetto was going on, before it was liquidated, we had to move them. Don't\nforget one was born in ghetto. My little sister Rosale never knew\n01:34:\nwhat it means to have one piece of bread and a full glass of milk. And what we did is,\nthose new apartments...they made the ghetto smaller again and we had to move the kids,\nso the little one we put in a potato sack instead of taking part of her valuables that was\nleft over, and the middle one, the one that was younger than I, we put her hair up, we put\nlipstick and we put her between me and my father and my mother in front, and we slipped\nthrough because we were not far, like I told you, for the German Kommandatur. So what\nhappened is every time they made the ghetto smaller, we had to move them, and the little\none was so smart. She was one and a half years old when they liquidated the ghetto, and\nwhat she did 1s, when she saw a German...she knew every German by the name...and\nwhen she saw a German she would grab the seven year old and say, let's go , and\nthey would hide themselves in the closet in a pair of laundry bags. And when they didn't\ntouch them, when they liquidated the ghetto...we were on a field waiting to be put on the\ntrains...they did not touch them. But when they did arrive near Stutthoff, my mother had\npoison tablets. How she got all of them I don't know, and she...father says let's take them\nbecause they were separating the men and sending them to Dachau, and the women and\nthe children sending in to Stutthoff. There came out little wagons with white spots on it,\nwent through a tunnel or something...I don't remember...everything is not so clear to\nme...and my mother, the first time she really put her foot down and she says no. No\npoison tablets. This time we go with destiny. For all the Jewish people are going to go\nthat route. We are going to go and if one finger is left to one of my kids or if any of us 1s\nsaved, it will be worth it to tell the story. And you know, something flipped through my\nmind when she said it, because this is the woman that was sitting at the dinner table when\nwe had the refugees in 1941 from Poland and Austria...I'm going back again...and I was\nvery upset with her. We were sitting at the dinner table. She just came back from taking\nthem clothes and food, and she and my father were talking and when they didn't want us\nto understand what they were talking about, they were talking in Russian, and I\nunderstood Russian. I spoke Russian. And she said, you know, those people are\nexaggerating. Nobody can do what they are telling the Germans are doing. And you\nknow, at, as we were dri...driving into Stutthof in those little wagons and she said, let's go\nwhere everybody's going, I remembered that Momma said this once at the table and I was\nfeeling so sorry for Anna Levine, that little Austrian girl, and...but I don't blame her for it\nbecause a lot of us didn't believe it. Nobody...a lot of Americans don't believe it. A lot of\npeople of the free world don't believe it, so...because she was so good when my father\nwould bring some food from the\nJordan brigade and first it was divided between the family. Then she would take it from\nus and send it to one of my girlfriends, her sister had a little baby...she would take away\nfrom Rosale with some milk and give it to Gitta's sister's baby, and a piece of...a little\npiece of bread here and a little piece of bread here and I don't know where everything\nwent but she was the most good-hearted person in the world and this is what happened in\nStutthof. They separated us and they took me in...you know, have you every watched the\nmovie, , that they show the gynecologist table with all the dirt and filth. I wrote to\nthe director a letter - 1t was done very wrong, because at thirteen and a half, they put me\non one of those tables to look for gold, and it wasn't a dirty room. The room was\ncompletely sterilized, white...like I can remember because that one thing will never come\nout of my mind, and the doctor was...or whoever he was...was all in white with a mask,\nand he was looking for gold in me, and that's why I said they were very wrong because\nthe Germans weren't working, they wouldn't have worked in a room like that, a doctor,\nbecause everything was white. All I remember is white. White, white, white, and I\nremember a gynecologist table. I never knew about it. Until I got pregnant with my son, I\nnever went to a gynecologist, and even now I have very very bad feelings when I have to\ngo up on one. It's a terrible thing to tell it in a video, but I have to tell you that, because\nit's wrong. The movie was done wrong. So when J arrived in Stutthof and they took my\nmother away and I couldn't go with her, I didn't want to live anymore. I just said to\nmyself whatever I do, I don't care anymore. So they said that they are going to take us to\nlittle labor camps because they need working power. Again they start sorting, you\nknow...the strong one, the not strong ones. But before I go on I have to tell you the story\nwhy I have that mark on my head. Max, the sadist from Stutthof, one of the biggest\nsadists that ever existed. See, they didn't have a chance to shave our hair, because most of\nthe Eastern European ghettos were being liquidated, so everybody was coming at one\ntime, so they had time to give us the uniforms, our numbers, but they didn't have time to\nshave our hair, so I had big long braids, black braids, so at six o'clock...I don't know what\ntime it was...1t was still dark...bare-footed...we didn't have any shoes, Max yells appell, so\nI asked the woman that had threw us, at night they threw us into the barracks on top of\nother women... what do they mean. Said keep quiet and get out and stand still. So I stand\nstill and SS and he goes through the lines like this, like a maniac. I'll never forget,\nand he said, \"Du schwarzer Teufel Du wirdst Stubenaelteste\" you black devil are going to\nbe some kind of a post of some kind of clean the latrine or stubenaeltester, you know, the\nhead of the barrack. And I was still braiding, I'm still trying, still braiding my braid. I\ndon't know where my mother is. With the kids I don't know what's happening here. See, I\nwent ahead of myself. I'm telling you back what happened to me with Max, and I said:\n\"was\". Takes me, he breaks my head and hit me on the barrack with my head, and I start\nbleeding. As the coming down bleeding and I was so confused I didn't know what was\nhappening. Why is that man doing it to me? What are those people all around me doing\nshivering in in striped uniform? Where am I? Where is my mother? All of a sudden I\nturned thirteen again. What is happening to me? And I looked at him with my two black\neyes...they were black and big at that time...and I said, and I looked at him and I didn't\ncry. I didn't move. The blood was running and I didn't do nothing. And that sadist that\ndidn't have a mind of his own thought I was supernatural. That's what saved my life.\nEvery time he came into the barrack to beat up the women, every time we were standing\nin line, he was knocking out the soup from our hand...that little bit of water and ___ that\nwe got. He never touched me. I didn't know why, because at that time I didn't figure it\nout. Now that I'm grown up and I know a little bit of psychology, I figured it out. He\nthought I was supernatural. How can I get help? How can I heal with a big cut like that\nand how can I look him straight in the face without crying. That means I didn't hurt. I was\nsupernatural, so he was afraid to touch me again. And that's what saved my life in\nStutthof and then when they were sorting out the people, stronger on one side, that he\nwas drunk...other people did it. I think so. So we went and they put three boats to go out\nto those little camps to work. And I was in one of the boats and then they decided they\ndon't need three boats and one of boats they set on fire, and the people start jumping from\nthat boat and trying to get on the other boats, and that was dipping the other boats, and\nyou know, I was sitting in my home and watching the boat people and I was crying and\nmy son says to me, Mom, why are you crying? It's natural thing to people that and\nDavid. History repeats itself and I told him the story. At that time he was about already\neleven and a half years old. I don't know how old he was. He was old enough that I could\ntell him, and I told him the story what happened, you know, in the water with the three\nboats when they were taking us to the little camps. It's all very not clear in my mind. I\ndon't know how to tell it to you, which boat it was and how the people jumped, but I\nknow when I saw the\nboat people, everything was coming back to me. People jumping out of a boat. People\ntrying to get into another boat, so something clicked in my mind. All of a sudden I\nrealized that something like this somewhere happened to me, and that's what happened.\nAnd they came in those little labor camps digging foxholes and I didn't care what\nhappened to me at that time because it was so close when they took away my mother and\nthe two little children and I don't know if they were killed in Stutthof, if they were taken\naway somewhere else, because I know they gave them civilian clothes. So why take them\nto a crematorium in Stutthof and put civilian clothes on them. But I still know that it\nhappened in Stutthof and they...for me they died in Stutthof. Maybe they took them to\nTheresienstadt. I don't know where they took them. And I just didn't want to go on\nanymore, but you know, in back of mind was one thing - survive, survive. Take revenge.\nSurvive. Take revenge. Survive. Take revenge. So what I would I do is those little camps,\nthey're always stationed near a lake and in the winter I would break open the ice and I\nwould wash myself with the, with cold water and the tea that they gave us...the hair start\ngrowing out.... would rub into my head, the warm tea. So Mrs. Gelta (ph) and ves\nis alive, she lived a hundred and twenty because she saved my life...she was a\nlageraltester, decided that I was the young...they knew I was the youngest there, that I\nshould work in the kitchen. Peel potatoes or clean the kettles...we had field kettles there\nfor the little bit of soup that they gave us, but I was always clean. I always clean. I always\nkept myself clean, and the shoes that I got in Stutthof was already worn out, so I wore a\npair of wooden shoes that they got for me and I worked in the kitchen and they would\nalways...now I realize it...they never gave us normal people for SS people. They were\npeople that were sick...they were people that were retarded, people that had syphilis. I\nfound it out after this because at one time a German came to us. Eingedeutshter Pole.\nYou know, a Polish German and he came over and he sat on the kettle and looked at me.\nLike that. And then he came to my step-mother, and later she was my step-mother but she\nwas my mother's friend and he said, Rochele, he said. I'm going to marry the Maruska\nafter the war, and she was thinking...you know...you should live that long. And one day\nhe went home for...oh how to say it...for vacation and he came back and he brought back\nwith him some shoes and some meat and bread and he brought me a whole package out\nto the kitchen, and there were some Jewish girls like our lageraltester that lived\nOl :47:50\nwith the Germans, and they saved a lot of our lives in that camp, in that little camp, by\ndoing that because the Oberscharfuerer was not bad, because they controlled him a little\nbit and they lived in a cell by themselve, all figured out for them, and I said to myself,\nthey just took away my mother and my two little sisters, and I will have to do what they\ndo - not on his life. So the Oberscharfuerer was standing downstairs with the people on\nappell to take them to work, and the kitchen was raised on a little hill...I1 took the whole\npackage and let it down the hill and it stopped right next to the Oberscharfuehrer's feet.\nThey put him in bunker for two weeks. When he came out, he start beating up the\nwomen, and I didn't know what to do about it, so all of a sudden the Allies start coming\nnear, so we start walking. It was the last march, you know, that long march. And we start\ngoing and we had the black SS and with me, I always had a little bit of imagination. I\ndon't know where I found a needle and I pulled most of my blanket out with thread and I\ncut off...at that little camp we were wearing red stars instead of yellow stars painted on\nour clothes, civilian clothes, and what I did is I took pieces out from one side and covered\nthe star like a little pocket. I must have had the talent from my father because I was a\ndesigner out here when I came to this country...went to art school...and I, to open it and\nclose it. And I thought to myself maybe I will be able to run away. And maybe I won't be\nable to run away, so I had that thing, but one of the guys...we called him Willie the\nDancer...each of them had a name...he knew that I had those covered somehow. How he\nfound out I don't know, so we were walking on the way and that German that I told you,\nthat Poland, from Poland, you know, the Polish German, he tried and he beat a\nwoman terrible and Willie the Dancer comes up to me and said, Maruska, he says, there\nis a big, you know...everybody was mixing together...the Wehrmacht, our fronts were\ngoing, and my step-mother's, my mother's friend feet, they're already frozen at that time.\nMine were frozen but not as bad because we were walking over the Weichsel, you know,\nthe Ger...the Polish river and my heels were made out of snow, you know, because in the\nwooden shoes, but after 1t was completely frozen but one good thing about ;\nnone of our people were shot. None of them. They couldn't walk any more. We just\ndragged them. Everybody dragged each other, so when we came to that...and he came out\nand he says to me really, let's go over to the...cover your stars, he says. I want you to go\nwith me somewhere. I got scared to death. I thought he was going to shoot me right there,\nand at that time everybody was hungry. Nothing was to eat. If we got a half a potato a\nday, a raw potato, it was lucky. So he says come with me, but just talk as little German as\nyou can, and I spoke a little bit so we came to that to the Wehrmacht and he introduced\nme as their Lithuanian Eingedeutschter, Lithuanian cook that cooks for the German, and\nif he can have some food from them because they took everything away from the farmers.\nSo what we got is we got a pig. We got potatoes and we got one of those big field kettles\nto cook it in. Who can open a pig? Who can do anything? We cooked up the potatoes.\nThe pig was already cleaned, but not very\n01:52:\nclean. We cooked up the pig, and we cut it up in pieces and we took it out in basket to\nour camp, to the women, to give it to them. And as we were giving out the potatoes, that\nGerman that I told you about, that beat up the women when he came out of the bunker,\nthat said he was going to marry me, was holding his gun to hit my step-mother, my\nmother's friend at that time. I grabbed the gun, with the basket I was holding with the\nfood, and he turned around to shoot me and when he saw my face, he didn't touch me and\nhe never touched another woman. Never. And when they took away the black SS and\ngave us some different Germans, because they took away the black SS to fight for\nthem,at Danzig, whoever they can get, , they had us in like in a camp. They\nwere afraid to kill us. They were afraid...they didn't know what to do with us. So he threw\na blanket over to me so I keep warm. I don't know what was going on in his mind, but at\nthat, that time, they left...that time I told my, my mother's friend at that time, Rochele, my\nstep-mother, I said we'll hide you in the straw and what happens happens. You can't go\non anymore. Now this is all...don't forget I am only, not even fifteen years old yet. I'm\nfourteen years old, and we hid her in the straw and she survived. A Polish family found\nher, and it was practically the...the Russians were there already so they were afraid to kill\nus so they kept us. One of her feet, her toes were taken off after the war. And all ofa\nsudden, another little story happened. In the camps are going around the rumors and I\nknow that my two aunts, my two mother's sisters, were in the camp with Sochne?? _.\nThat was...in their house was the commandanteur. They were friends of the family, and\nall of a sudden those two camps meet and Sochne works there with the...works with her\ndaughters, and I yell, ; , Where 1s Pave (?). Where is Taivele. She said that\nis dying. She's in a in a, you know, wagon, with a horse. Perele had come back\nto Stutthof and all of a sudden I see her daughter's feet bleeding so I drag up half of my\nblanket and I said bind your feet in it, and I...the childish head of mine, didn't think to do\nmy own feet like that, so then when I told her, so I ran to the wagon where my Aunt\nwas lying and the German was beating me go back to your place so she was\nalready dead under this straw and I went back to the place and then it fall into my head to\nbind my feet in my blanket instead of letting them bleed to death, because during the day\nthe snow would melt and then if you would sleep in a silo, it would freeze at night back\nto our feet. So we always prayed to God that we would sleep in a cow barn, because it\nwas warm. Can I drink some water?",
        "A: Yes. OK. We'll stop here for a minute. They're going to need to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: OK.",
        "A: So we walked and we walked and finally they couldn't move us any more. And they put\nus put us in a silo in a village called Cheno (ph), and the two typhuses broke out and I\nwas holding on and it's the funniest thing...you can imagine what Germans they always\ngave us, in the end too...that were the kapo, a German, that came to the door in the\nmorning. He said, who is dead should say so. And you would get up in the morning and\nyou would find dead people on each side of you. In fact one of the people that you\ninterviewed yesterday, his mother died next to me. And I walk out...remember in the\nbeginning of the tape I told you my mother would send milk to my friend's sister's little\nbaby...she was a kapo in one of the camps, and she...all the kapos and all the\nlageraltesters slept in the village away from the silo because of the typhuses...maybe they\nthought they'll survive better. I don't know what happened. I couldn't account for\nanybody else except myself, and I came out and she was standing and the food...around\nthe food and everything and you know, it's a blank her name for me. I can't even mention\nher name. This is how I blanked her out, and I said just give me a ...because I was getting\nalready a temperature. I felt it, you know. And I said just give me a little bit of the hot\nwater. I don't want any food. She said, well stay away from me with all that lice. And I\nturned around and I walked away. I couldn't even cry anymore. And all those things went\nthrough...her sister and her little baby and my mother giving the food and that minute\neverything went through my mind and I went into the silo and she saw that she did a\nmistake, and she came to the\n02:02:\ndoor and she said, Maruska, come here. Here is some tea. And I turned and I covered\nmyself with straw, that I didn't want to know about her. And they told us that they are\ngoing to burn that silo and there was a little girl next to me, Chajele, that we'd spend the\ntime together all the time, keeping each other, and I said you know that that piece of\nblanket that I have left over...you still can walk. Why don't you run? I can't walk\nanymore, and when I heard the yelling, I though they were burning the silo so I covered\nmyself with the straw and I slipped into unconsciousness and when I woke up, I woke up\nin a home that the Russians are taking care of me medically, and before I even have a\nchance to breath properly, they told us they have to move out of there. The front is\ncoming near. We have to go to Laurenburg (ph), so in that German house they found\nsome clothes they gave us, and they gave us medicine and we walked a couple of\nkilometers and they saw...there were two Russians officers driving in a two-horse\ncarriage, you know, in the back just two seats and I and Chajele are walking and I said\ncould you take us? And he says no...we shouldn't, but you know what...we'll take you.\nThey saw that we fall practically down but we'll leave you out right before Laurenburg\nand everybody was walking and the shooting was going on, and they drove us up to\nLaurenburg, and the first house we walked in. Now you may think I'm superstitious but\nnow I realize what it was, you know. There was nothing in that house except one bottle\nof black berries and it was standing in the middle of the floor and I...so hell, I don't care if\nit's poisoned , if not. I'm going to drin...eat a part of it. Said I'll eat 1t too, and we both fell\nasleep and we got up and we felt better. Now I realized that 1t must have been fermented,\nand we both got drunk on it, on those black berries and we fall asleep and maybe that's\nwhat helped knock down with all the medication that we got, and they took us to a\nRussian hospital and they shaved our head, because it was all full of thing. They put a\ngreen solvent, and you can imagine...I was forty-five kilo when I was liberated, and I\nlooked like hell, and in Laurenberg they said said go and look for a home. So I...about\nthree or four girls that looked better already that were older than than me...they say come\nMaruska. Come and live with us, because the Russian, they're, you know, raping the\nJewish girls, the German girls. They didn't care. They were going on the front. They\ndidn't give a damn who it was. So and then you had to sign typhus...they didn't even\nlisten, so what they did is they gave me a\nlittle bottle of medicine that the hospital gave me, and every time a drunk Russian, no\nmatter how drunk he was, came in or something, they send me out with my all that green\nstuff on my head and like this and I walked out like a dead woman, and when they saw\nme coming they start running. But then my hair start growing in and I start getting a little\nbetter, they said no. We can't stand it anymore, so we went to the Russian\ncommandanteur and at that time I didn't give them no . [just wanted to go home\nand see if anybody's alive. And we went to the Russian. They said oh yes, we'll send you\nhome and they put us on trucks and they sent us to farms in Pomerania, and there's a story\nby itself. We arrive in Pomerania and there's cows, sick cows and sick pigs and sick\nthings, you know, and they want, needed food for Russia so what they did is they opened\na cheese factory, where they couldn't use the cows and they didn't know what to do with\nit, so the Russian girls that went...Ukrainian Russian girl... I thought that went the\nGermans were playing the piano and the Jewish girls were cleaning the stalls from the\ncows, everything. After the concentration camp and after what they went through so in\none time it comes, the captain comes to us. He says who wants to go in Rickenwald (ph).\nThere is a veterinarian doctor from Moscow and he wants to teach you to be a\nveterinarian nurse. In two weeks he wants to teach us to be a veterinarian nurse, so I am\ngame. I'm game of anything. I said I'm going. I mean, there we were also kept like in a\nprison but not as bad because we had food, we had clothes, everything, but we could\nnever walk from one village to another without a Russian soldier. So I went to\nRickenwald and it so happened...I must read (ph) of my father and I told the Polkovniks\n[colonel]wife, I said you know, you don't wear this dress. This is a nightgown. Put on\nthis. I said you have so much clothes and I told her all the hair, you should do it, you\nknow, that way. I made very good friends with her, and the doctor that was supposed to\nteach us was a drunkard. Was very sick, very drunk, so he would teach us about two\nhours a day. The rest of the time he would get drunk and after two weeks, he gave us a\nbig stamp. He said, , I'm a veterinarian nurse. So I came back to the camp, and\nthey put...Polkovnik came to visit one time...this is during the Russian. This, I'm liberated\nalready. And he said I want Maruska (ph), Mar...Maruska at the table. And the captain\nsaid, Maruska at the table. He said yes. I told you when I telephoned you that I want her\nat the table. My wife wants to talk to her. So he saw that I am good friends with\nPolkovnik and the Russian soldiers loved me very much because I worked where the\nmilk was delivered and were going to the cheese factory, so the Russian soldiers wouldn't\nget anything to eat, and when we came back, what they did is what they did with the\ncows that they captured, we checked if they have tuberculosis and we would cut around\nthe lungs...would have the German people cut around the lungs and then the rest they\nwould cut, cook it for the Russian soldiers. The good ones they would make conserves\nthemselves. They opened a conserve factory and send it to Russian and so the cheese, the\nRussian soldiers didn't get nothing, so they would come at twelve o'clock at night and I\nwould give them the milk and I would give them whatever there was. The captain had\neverything at the table, but the soldier had nothing. So they liked me very much. And\nPolkovnik liked me, so how does he get rid of me. He makes me...now remember, this is\n'45 and it was beginning of '45 when I was liberated and went though it. Let's say I was\nfifteen years old. I wasn't even fifteen years old, and\nthey send me as the head of the cheese factory, and they send and a big house\nand I get the house of the woman that owned it, and she got to be my housekeeper but she\nnever was because she was a beautiful lady, and I made up...one thing I forgot to tell\nyou...I'm going to take revenge. I'm going to take revenge of the people, so I was riding a\nhorse, being that I was a veterinarian nurse I had to go to the fields and see 1f the cows\nare clean, if the German women are taking care of it, and I saw some children on the\nstreet and I would fly by with my horse and and I was careful not to hurt them, but I\nthought I had and I walked into a German house and I would, with my boot I was always\nopening like they did our house, and you know after four weeks what I did. I stole from\nthe Russians and I gave the medicine, because we Jewish people are compassionate\npeople and we cannot see anybody suffer. Took medicines to them. I took food to them.\nWould you believe it? And the German woman in Pommern, she was Polish-German,\nand she took care of me and I wouldn't let her and she was my equal. She was supposed\nto be my servant. She was my equal and I was fifteen years old and my mind was\nworking and one story I have to tell you that 1s the most fantastic story, that I am writing\nabout my experience after the war with the Russians. He came to me one day and he says\nto me, you know, he says to me I had a lot of, before that I tell you I had a\n02:11:\nlot...there was to clean. There was a big airport not far from where I stayed in ;\nand they brought...a lot of fliers, majors and captains would come to visit me. They were\nboar hunting, you know, and they brought vodka and there was a piano and they were\nplaying and when they got real drunk...that that housekeeper of mine, that lady that\nowned the \"gut\"[estate], would lock me in her room that they couldn't touch me.\n(Laughter) You understand what I mean. But they were very close to me, so the captain\ncame to me and said I have a problem. I said what's your problem? He said I need seven\nhorses. I said why? He said because the horses is in my village and my ranch and my\nPolkovnik and he said I want seven horses because is coming and only you can\nhelp me, because the people love you here and they'll give it to you. I said nobody gives\nnothing because it came out I think that the Russians cannot take anything away from the\nGermans, from farmers, anything. Nothing can be touched again. No cows, no horses,\nnothing. What's theirs belongs to them. Not far from me was also a officer, a Polish\nofficer camp from the Pole...for the Polish people soldiers, so I said OK. On one\ncondition. That you release every Jewish girl that wants to go out of your camp I said,\nand I want them sent right here. I'll stay. I said I'll stay. He says no, I'll make with you a\ndeal. For every horse you get me, one girl can go. I'll take them to the train. I said fine,\nyou sign it for me so I can show it to the . I said I want to have something over\nyou. So he did. Now remember, this is all a fifteen year old talking and it's the truth, it's\nthe honest truth with God as my witness. What I did is...I had at that time I invited six,\nsix because there were not seven, six Polish officers to a party in my home. There were\nthe Russian, a couple of Russian officers came in with vodka and caviar and everything\nyou can imagine. The officers had everything and what I did is, they...I said I want you\nto get those guys drunk, as drunk as you can. I had six Russian soldiers, seven because\nwe can only get seven waiting on the side...I knew approximately the size of the officers\nbecause they came to visit very often, and they send me seven of them...I got them so\ndrunk they couldn't move. We undressed them. We put the Polish uniforms on the\nRussian soldiers. They took, they stole six horses. They came back. we put the uniforms\non. I put them on a wagon and I sent them back to the camp, and the captain had seven\nhorses, because one I had kept for him. From then on, I was in danger. He was afraid of\nme. You understand what I mean. Because I had something over him. But I had the\nprotection of the Russian soldiers. I had the protection of the German people - they like\nme because I didn't hurt them in any way. I had the protection of a lot of officers that\nknew me, the protection of the polkovnik. So one day I am going with a man from\nGeorgia, from Russia, a soldier, riding into the fields to look over what's going on, and a\nshort Jewish man comes up to me and said, you know somebody by the name of Maruska\nSaposhnikov and I said . And that man from Grushin, from Georgia, says to me,\ndon't worry Maruska, he says. Whatever this man wants from you, nothing will be said. I\nsaid I have to leave without nothing or anything. He wants to take me. My father is alive\nin Lodz and he wants to take me with him. My father sent\nhim. Now if you want to go and tell to the captain, you're alright. Go tell him. But I have\nto go. He said not only will I let you go, I will take you there with that gentleman. But I\nsaid I can't let you do it, but you know what I'll do. I said I will write you a letter what\nhappened between me and the captain. You just say to him you have a letter about the\nsecret seven horses from Maruska, I said, and that's all...that nothing, I don't think\nnothing will happen to you. But I said I appreciate it. He took us to the train and we left\nand I met my father in Lodz. And later on, some girls escaped from there too, some\nJewish girls. He kept his word. Some of them were released. They escaped and they told\nme that that guy lies ina hammock and it's catered to him. Masha they said... at that time\nI was calling myself already Masha. Maruska, what did you do? I said this is between me\nand that Grushin, nobody else and that's the story about the seven horses. I'll never forget\nit. As many things I did to him that he didn't know, you know. When I came back from\nRiegenwald, being a veterinarian nurse that I was not...I knew that much, all I knew is\nhow to take analysis, a blood analysis from a horse, and somebody had to hold him, and\nhow to cut around the lungs from the cow, and how to see that everybody, that everything\nis clean. And when I came back from Riegenwald after the polkovnik was there, in about\na period of three weeks, the Jewish girls are playing the piano and the Russian girls were\ncleaning the stalls. But I was in danger from them also. So I had to run away somehow,\nso my father found out where I was from somebody and he sent that man to get me out of\nthere, and this is how I came to Lodz, because my father survived Dachau and we met in\nLodz. And then we had to go to, run away from the AK, from the fascists in Lodz\nbecause you couldn't go out. I didn't speak Polish. My father didn't speak Polish, so\nhow...you couldn't even go out on the street. My father was working as a tailor. He hardly\nmade a living, but one thing he did is he had an apartment. Everybody went to to Lodz\nfrom somewhere, one camp or another...he wouldn't let them go back to Lithuanian.\nAlways kept them there. It was a big, big apartment. Many people told me before I even\ncame what my father did for them. But it was also a beautiful thing that he did and he\ndied pretty young, and what happened is is we had to smuggle the border. So how do we\nsmuggle the border. It costs a lot of money. So Masha went to work in a kibbutz in Lodz\nand made friends with the Brichah and took a transport in 1945...I wasn't even fifteen\nyears old...in July I was fifteen. I took a transport with my father and my...at that time she\nwas already my step-mother, Rochele, all through to Bratislava and the AK was shooting\nafter us, and I stopped the people because my step-\n02:19:\nmother couldn't walk that well. She just had an operation in Poland and they were\nshooting. The people were screaming and I said I promised you to get you across and I\nwill get you across, and I got them across to Bratislava. But I loved Austria...and I stayed\nin Austria after the war and I went to school there, and my husband was , before\nI met my husband. And I worked for the Brichah. I helped people smuggle from\nsonnenfeld because I went to school. I spoke pretty good Austrian. Let my braid grow\nagain. Put on an Austrian outfit into Sonnenfeld and smuggled people over the Innsbruck\nborder into Italy with the Brichah. Many times were shot after. And when I got married I\nthink I settled down a little bit. And I came to America and we lost ev...my husband lost\neverything we had and one thing I'll never forget. We came into New Orleans and\nsomebody once asked me, how do you like this country? I said oh, this country is\nwonderful, but why...I didn't speak very good English...my husband spoke the King's\nEnglish and he wanted me to go to school again. I said school again? Never. He said\nremember, when we come come to America, I won't help you. You'll have to go to\nschool. Why don't you do it now? I said no. First my father, then you...school, school,\nschool. I'm tired of school. So, but I read. He read to me a lot, and when we came in I\nknow what hot means and I know what dog means. I said I understand everything. It's a\nbeautiful country. I have bananas to eat. Everything is...but why do people eat hot dogs?\n(Laughter) Because that's the only thing I could read. And like I said I came here and I\nstart working and I went to school. I finished high school and I start...I had a small degree\nin college that is not great, and I I had an art major so I start designing and I designed\nknitted clothes for a lot of movie people, because we came direct...in New Orleans we\nwere two days. We came direct to Los Angles because my husband had a brother here.\nsent us affidavits and he was broke. And we had, we didn't get from the HIAS,\ndidn't get nothing. My husband was broke because everything was stolen that they\nshipped from Budapest, but we made it. We made it and I love this country and I wish it\nwas when I came in '49 the same way it was then. But everything changes, but it's still\none of the best countries in the world. Of course after Israel. I'm a...I'm an American\nZionist. I always was a Zionist. And that's my story up till now. Except before I broke my\nleg, before I came to Washington.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you recall that you didn't tell us that you'd like to add?",
        "A: I don't know because like I told you, I was a child and with\nme it comes back in flashes. That's why I never will write a book. I talk into a\nmicrophone. If my husband and my son wants and I'm not here anymore, he can take it,\nput it together, do whatever they want, because sometimes at night...I have a little poem\nthat I wrote. When the Memorial was built, there were some flags put up, and I\nhave two flags of my two little sisters and the flags of my family and part of my\nhusband's family that was killed from the Hungarians, and when they built it, it was the\nopening and I was co-chairing and I was the hostess at dinner opening and Hausner (ph)\nwas our main speaker, and I couldn't sleep that night and I got up and I wrote a poem and\nI love that little plain poem. I write poetry from time to time. And that little plain poem I\nlove so much, because it tells so much about me. In the couple of little words it says so\nmuch so when I was in England the last time I found a friend of mine that was an actor\nand I composed some works and I got permission from the Barry sisters to use their\nmusic, and we made a little tape out of it and I think your producer has it, 1f you wanted\nto play it.",
        "Q: We'll put it on...(pause) OK. (pause) They're going to play the poem back and we'll be\nable to hear it and they'll be recording, looking at you, while they're playing it. So OK.\nThey're going to do that now. We have to sit quietly.\nMUSIC\n02:24\nThe poem that you are about to hear was written by Masha Loen, who as a child\nexperienced and survived what is probably the most dramatic and tragic event in the\nhistory of mankind - the Holocaust. Of the six million Jews who died or who were put to\ndeath by the Nazis, one and a half million were children. This was only forty years ago,\nwithin living memory. Yet to many, the Holocaust is a distant and even forgotten episode\nin history. To those who may have forgotten, it 1s hoped that in this simple but moving\npoem, which was written by a child who survived the horror, the world and future\ngenerations will remember the unfortunate victims, the survivors and especially those\nwho still have to live with the nightmare, with the sorrow of having lost loved one. Never\nbut never must it be that people become complacent or take the attitude, oh, that was long\nago. That has nothing to do with me. But worse still, let by-gones be by-gones. No. Never\nshall you forget, nor your children, nor your children's children. No. Never must mankind\nforget what heinous crime a nation committed on fellow men. The question that must be\nasked is, oh God, why did you let it happen?\nI was a little girl, lost and sad.\nMy mother told me I was not bad.\nThen why the agony and pain\nThe Nazis inflicted on me with whip and cane.\nThe question was unanswered,\nBecause mother was no more.\nThey took her away to settle the score.\nBy hiding her children, she committed a crime.\nAnd that is why they killed her.\nOh mother of mine.\nI wasn't a little girl for long any more.\nI had to survive to settle that score.\nThe beatings did not hurt.\nHunger was forgotten,\nBecause the one thing in my mind\nWas to take revenge on the lot.\nThe time came and I emerged out of hell and pain.\nAnd the stories I will tell over and over again.\nNow the time has come.\nYou are a Statistic no more.\nAnd Memorial is settling the score.\nRosalie and , with one and a half million\nThat were killed during the Holocaust years,\nFor the years to come when I am not here,\nSomebody else will see the flag\nAnd shed for you a tear.\nMUSIC\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: See, the revenge I'm doing 1s, like I said in the poem, it should never happen again. I got\nalso is that I lecture on the Holocaust. I go. I work. I worked very hard\nto open the Memorial. I will do anything for any memorial. I don't care if there's a\nmemorial in each corner, because like I said, we are a compassionate people. We cannot\ngo out and kill. We cannot go out and do certain things that we thought we were going to\nbe able to do, that we learned from the Germans, but we didn't. So the only way we can\ndo it is to prevent it from ever happening to any people, to anybody, no matter of\nreligion, race or or or or creed or whatever it is. Those things can not be happening and\nthat's my revenge...is staying ten days with the Mormons in Utah, in southern Southern\nat Southern Utah college, to go anywhere, rain or shine, if I'm called...or ten year olds in\na temple. But I will talk about it till I die. And that is my revenge because I can't do it any\nother way.",

        "A: My name is Masha Loen. I was born in Lithuania, Kovno, 1930. I lived near Kovno in a\nsuburb called Slobodka before the war. I came from an average home. In Yiddish they\nwould say Balle Batish, middle class. My father was a good tailor, maybe would have\ncalled a designer here and made a good living and I had two little sisters and one older\nsister than I am. We were four girls. One of them was born in ghetto. There was only\nthree girls before the war, and no boys. And what I can tell about my childhood...I went\nto school. I went to private school, called Kommerz Gymnasium (ph). I was thrown out\nof public school. It so happened that I I have a terrible temper and the teacher said\nsomething to me and I didn't like it and I took the my book and I threw at the desk. On\naccident I think it hit her nose. So my grandfather pushed me into a private school\nsomehow and I enjoyed it. I went to school everyday by bus. We came back. We came\nback home. We played games. We played soccer ball they called in Lithuania and we\nmade Jewish friends mostly and in the winter we were ice skating. That was the main\nsport of Lithuania in the winter for kids and grown-ups too, and like I said, everything\nwas going on just as it 1s till 1940, when the Russians came in first to Lithuania. They\ngave us Vilna, the capital back and at that time when I was in Kovno, a lot...we had some\nrefugees from Austria and from Poland that had relatives in Kovno so they came and we\nhelped them with clothes and everything else and I had a Austrian little girl friend by the\nname of Levine, Anna Levine. I will never forget that and I came to my grandfather. My\ngrandfather was better off than we were and I said, Zayde, I need a bicyclet, you know, a\nbicycle for my girlfriend Anna. He said you know, Maraska (ph), I can't afford to buy her\na new one but we'll manage something, and you know, he found a bicycle and put on a\nnet in the back, and matched mine...very so much that I liked hers better than mine, and\nshe was a beautiful girl. A very well-behaved child. My mother loved her very much\nbecause she thought it was good influence on me and I don't know what happened to her.\nI absolute don't know. I lost touch with her when I went into ghetto because I had so\nmuch on my mind. When the war broke up in 1941, my sister, my oldest sister that 1s four\nand a half years older than I am, was a Communist, and she somehow came to us and she\nsaid run,\n01:04:\nbecause I'm running. And she disappeared and we packed up whatever we could and we\nran. My little sister was, , the little...the youngest, was about six years, seven\nyears younger than I am and we start running and before we even reached about twenty,\nthirty kilometers...the Germans were ahead of us, and my grandmother was running and\nmy uncle was running, and my uncle at one time was living in Memel that was occupied\nby the Germans and he came back to Kovno and he said, we have to get away. We cannot\nstay. So we were running, but the running didn't help. They overtook us, so we snuck\nvery quietly back into Kovno and I lived in Slobodka and what I can tell you is it it\nhappened to me I an experience today that with that . I, we walked into our\nhome and everything was like blood lying all over the house. Nobody was killed because\nnobody was in the house. I don't know how the blood get got there and then the neighbors\nall around the district... many many Jews got killed. In fact later on I heard from the\ngrown-ups accidentally there was there was a head from the child and a breast from the\nmother standing on a piano because the Lithuanians said the pogrom before the Germans\neven came in, and today of all days I met a righteous Lithuanian woman and admired her\nmore than anybody else that from so many murderers like the Lithuanians, one woman\ncould come out and hide a one and a half year old child. I don't know if she got paid for it\nor what happened. I didn't want to ask questions but I did ask her and I feel badly. Maybe\nI hurt her, if she had more problems from her neighbors than from the Nazis, because the\nLithuanians, like I said, were very very bad. They collaborated with the Germans in\nevery way and did a lot of things that the Germans didn't do and asked them to do to the\nJews. To find one that saved really a child is a miracle and I shouldn't have said it. I felt\nbadly later on, because she answered, in every nationality and every religion are different\nkind of people. I wanted to tell her yes, but not so in Lithuanian but I already kept my\nmouth shut and didn't say anything because it happened as they said...there was the Riga\nAktion, there was the Estonia Aktion. Every time they took out...first they killed a lot\nof...the first thing they killed is the intellectuals in Kovno. So being a child I didn't know\nthat, learned after the war, but what I remember is the Riga Aktion. I was working, as an\nolder child. I was always acting like...when the war started I was not going on eleven...I\nwas going on forty, because I had to grow up. I had to grow up because of the blood that\nthey saw and the thing that was going on and here is my mother with two...with pregnant,\nexpecting another child and I didn't know, you know, in which world I am. Am I forty?\nAm I eleven? Am I fifteen? Sometimes I cried like a baby and sometimes I acted like a\ngrown-up that nobody can touch me. I was untouchable, and what happened is is that my\nuncle, Menashke Saposhnikov, my father's brother, was one of the leaders of the\nunderground and when the Riga ghet...and we had a bunker. It was in my grandfather's\nhome that you went through a baker's oven and you went in there. In fact the\nunderground some of their equipment kept in that bunker. They knew about the Kinder\nAktion. I walked at night in the ghetto Werkstatten, the ghetto works, you know, what\nthey did knitting and they did sewing and all different kind of things and they came to\npick me up to run me into the bunker because they knew somehow, the underground\nknew there was going to be an Aktion and they are taking people to Riga. And as we get,\nas there was an Aktion...first it was the...no, I'm sorry, I have to go back...first there was\nthe the Kleine Aktion. That was from the small ghetto. There was a bridge and they\nliquidated the small ghetto. Then there was the aktion from one section where I lived and\nthat time they took away my grandfather...both my grandfathers, both my grandmothers,\nuncles, aunts and so on and I tell you something - I could have saved them, but I came\ntoo late. They came in. The Kommandatur, the German command was not far from us\nand I had a little cousin...my uncle and aunt live now in Vilna...1t was their\ndaughter,Dveirele, and she came in and she said: Tante Michle...German...poup, poup,\npoup. She saw those German near the Kommandatur, and she saw them with their rifles,\nwhatever they had at that time - I don't remember, and my mother says, and she was, you\nknow, the little flour that she had she was baking...it was a Friday...and she was\nscrubbing the floor, and said get out\n01:10:\nof my way, and all of a sudden in about ten minutes, the Germans came in with the\nshotguns and pushed us out of the house and at that time my father, like I said, he was a\nbetter tailor...worked for Jordan of the ghetto...at that time he was the head of the ghetto,\nKovno ghetto, and he was sewing for him and we got some sign [document] called the\nLebensschein. And that is a sign to be alive and it was hanging in our kitchen in a little\nbasket and she yells to me, Maruska, go get the , the...to be alive...the\nLebensschein. So I ran into the house and I grabbed the Schein and I come out and my\nmother wasn't there, and then there was a big street that they took us to the field and that\nstreet was the border how many people they took out, and there were people going by the\ndozens, carrying children and so on, and I want my mother, so I stand up in the middle of\nthe street and I start yelling...this is why I tell you I grew up so fast... Momma, Momma,\nMomma...so a German start beating me and he said get off the street. I'll shoot you right\nthere. I said no. I have Judenschein. You cannot shoot me, like I was something special. I\nthought I was something special. He says get off there and all of a sudden from about I\ndon't know how many feet away to tell you...maybe a block away...I heard my mother's\nvoice yelling Maruska, Maruska...and I run to her. When we came to that field where\nthey're they're separating...right, left, right, left...1 found out that one Judenschein can\nsave one family, and I had four of them, because I had three from us and one for my\nfather that was out to work in the brigade, so I kept running around between the people,\nbut they already took away both my grandmothers and both my grandfathers. There were\nnobody left from my family that was living right there in that section, so what I did is I\nsaid Momma, what should I do. She said start grabbing people. Start giving them the\nJudenschein. My mother always thought of somebody else. She was a beautiful lady, not\nbecause she was my mother, but as I grow up and I don't think I'm that nice and people\nsay I'm a nice person but I don't think so, because I don't, wouldn't have had the guts to\ntell my daughter to run around with life, life depends on and start grabbing people and\ngiving them Judenschein and then you don't even know if you would get it back from\nthem, but if people were nice enough when we came back on the right side, on the good\nside, they did give me back the Judenschein and this is one day part of my life, of my\nchildhood. And that was the first aktion...that was the second one and then it was the\nRiga aktion. I couldn't tell you really one after another because I blank out or I may go\nback from time to time to tell you. Is that alright?",
        "A: And then came the big Aktion, October 28th, 1941. It was...I don't know...I can't tell you\ndates really and that\nwas called the Grosse Aktion, the big aktion. And they went from home to home and they\ntold everybody please leave your sick ones at home and Jordan wants to hold a speech.\nWe want you on this and this field. Leave your sick ones home and everybody has to be\nat this and this time on that field. So my mother was pregnant and one of my uncles that\nmy aunt was taken away in the first aktion that I told you, had something very swollen on\nhis face and we didn't know what it was. He came with us. Some of my aunts were\nseparated. My mother's sister that we lived in the same house was separated from us, but\nmy father's brother and my father's brother that was in the underground kept yelling at\nmy father...he was a painter...and my father took him in and showed him how to sew and\nhe worked with him in the Jordan Brigade as a tailor, so we came and we came on that\nbig field and they start sorting and Jordan never showed up. They surrounded us with\nmachine guns and they start sorting...right, left, right, left. And Hessel, I think it was\nHessel his name - I don't know for sure - I can't remember. He was the right hand of\nJordan. He comes up to my father and says you Bruder Schneidermeister, you brother\ntailor. Take your family and go. So my father started looking for people...you know for\nfamily, but there was no family around except my uncle with that big face and he said\nwhat's the matter with him. He says oh, he had a toothache. It will be pulled out, and my\nfather saw that there's nobody from our family so he start dragging people that were\nbehind and in front of us and my mother and me, and he had such a smirk on his face...I'll\nnever forget...and they said all this is your family? And my father saved a lot of strangers\nand we all went and a lot of my aunts went away. A lot of people went away to the Ninth\nFort, and what the most terrible thing about the Ninth Fort or the Seventh Fort was in\nKovno is that at night we heard the shooting of the people. The machine guns were going\n't-t-t-t-t-t-t' and what I found out...now these things what I'm going to tell you now\nI found out after the war...is that they were not shooting one person into the grave. They\nwere shooting two or three at a time to save bullets and that were open graves and then\nthey would put a chemical over it and burn them, and some people after it got dark ten\nthousand people to shoot into the graves, it took time, by the time they sorted us out and\neverything, so they didn't have a chance to burn them. Some of them got themselves out\nand came back into the ghetto, and this is how we find out what had happened, so what\nthey called portable crematoriums in Sobibor and they called portable crematoriums in\nother death camps...that why when I talk about the Kovno ghetto I don't talk it as a\nghetto. I talk it as the concentration camps. I talk about Stutthof as the death camp,\nbecause we did have portable crematoriums in the Ninth Fort. We did have portable\ncrematoriums in the Seventh Fort. They didn't have to have the oven. They just shot them\nin. At that time they still had bullets. They shot them in and then burned them. So if they\ncan call a portable crematorium why couldn't we call the portable crematorium on\nthe Ninth Fort. Do you think I'm wrong? So this is what I call...when I talk to some\npeople where they ask me about experiences, I don't talk really like a ghetto, because a\nghetto is a concentration of certain people that, ethnic people and so on, and I don't call\nthis a ghetto because being without food, being without clothes, being eliminated\nconstantly, thousand, ten thousand, five thousand...and then buried practically alive in a\nportable crematorium...you couldn't call this a ghetto. You called this a concentration\ncamp, and then we were sent to the death camps. Now I want to tell you one story that I\nalways talk about and that's the children aktion. The children...1 was working in the\nghetto works...everything happens that they, that should happen, like today I'm here in\nWashington with a broken leg, but that's alright. Everything happens that should happen.\nI came to my father. You see the Jordan brigade, it was moved to the ghetto works and\nmy father was working in town. You know, you would trade some things for some food\nand the Jordan brigade, it was well-know that it was bringing food into ghetto and would\nshare. My mother of course shared it with with everybody before she gave it to us. My\nfather shared it with his family. So you had food to eat, more than the average person, so\nwhat happened is when they put the Jordan brigade into the ghetto into the ghetto works,\nthey had a separate room. They had a window into the ghetto and everything was...they\nhad it better than anybody. The ghetto works but it still was not in to town, so that day in,\nvery early in the morning, there's a . You know what...I would like to go out into\ntown, in a brigade I said maybe I can bring something in because it's getting to the point\nthat the kids are starving, you know. And they said...not starving but not enough food\nto...you know, we did our best. And he said you know what...I said you have protection.\nYou go in. You talk to the Arbeitsamt, to the Komitet in the ghetto works, so he went in\nand it was already late, and he said to me...that one of the men said, he says, you know,\nHerr Saposhnikov, he says, there is one brigade, a German and six girls to clean up a\nhouse...would you daughter be happy to do that? He said my daughter would be very\nhappy to do it, so it happened that we left late and as we were walking out of the\nghetto...of course every girl was older than I was, that worked in the ghetto works...we\nsaw some black machines coming into the ghetto but no windows. Just painted little\nwhite windows. And I said to the girls, oh, that looks funny. There's something rotten in\nDen...I didn't know about Denmark...I was too young to know about, you know, Hamlet\nor whatever it is...and I said there's something wrong. Why are those machines coming in\nthe ghetto. I a little panic, keep quiet...they're coming in...they're bringing some\npeople maybe from a different ghetto or something, so I kept quiet and we went to the\nGerman's house, and we cleaned up the house and there were six girls and we were six\ngirls...they had two Germans watching us and the brigadier, the Jewish fellow that went\nwith us, so there was no way of us going out into the town and trade something for bread\nor milk or things like that, so what happened is that I ......how long does it take to clean\nup a house, as even if you're weak and don't eat all day and everything. Still it doesn't\ntake long. Six girls. So what we did is we didn't know what to do...we start dancing and\nsinging and dancing the horah and I never danced the horah in my life, but it was some\nolder people and they knew about the horah and they start dancing the horah so the\nGermans walk in and said, you're through? It's time to take you back. Fine. We couldn't\ntrade anyways so something to bring in to ghetto so they took us back and that\nLithuanian woman was wrong when she said every nation or anything. When we came to\nthe ghetto gate, there was like a Lithuanian with a gun, a machine gun on one part and a\nGerman about maybe like from here to the vase here with another machine gun. A\nLithuanian and a German, and the whole thing, the whole ghetto was surrounded and we\nwalk into the ghetto gate and there is none of our Jewish policemen. There is none of the\nsame German when we walked out. There was different Germans, completely different,\nand something is very quiet on that street. The ghetto isn't moving. Everything was like\nin slow motion. And I and a man that was with the Arbeitsamt, the uncle Jankele\nGoldovsky comes out from behind that booth near the gate where the Germans were\nstanding. He said, girls, you came at the worst time. It's twelve-thirty. They are taking\naway all children, all people over forty-five, fifty he says, and they don't have the quota.\nThey're taking everybody. And as we walk out from that booth, we saw about four White\nRussians, Germans, coming with machine guns...started, it was a very very long street. It\nwent through, all through the ghetto, that street where the, where the gate was. And they\nsurrounded us. They surrounded us and they start walking with us and I know I walked\nby that little Kommandatur, our little houses, and I know...oh, my God. My mother is at\nhome. Even now I get goose pimple even if I talk about it. My mother is at home with the\ntwo kids. What can I do? Shall I run? Shall I make a run for it? Go see what happened?\nAnd from far away I saw a friend of mine, Susa, with her mother, standing outside a\ndoor, and I couldn't do nothing and I start giggling. I didn't know what happened to me,\nand the , the German, he says to me, ah, laugh...in German...laugh as much as\nyou want. In a half an hour the sun will not shine for you anymore. And I walked. We\nwalked and they take us to this...and there were some big, big apartment houses in ghetto\non that street, and they walk us to those machines that I will never forget. They tried to\nput us into machine and one girl practically had one foot up on it, and there was a\nman...I'll never forget him - Regal (ph) was his name, a German man. He had his hand in\na sling and it's his house that we cleaned and he says, ah, nein, no. These girls belong to\nthe ghetto works. Take them back. He saw us from upstairs, where all the Germans were\nsitting. He recognized one of the girls. I don't know what he did, and we got four people,\nfour German again...different ones. They took us back to the ghetto works, and what I tell\nyou 1s the ghetto works....there are two barracks. One on one side or like barracks or like\nplaces that work, and one on the other side and in the middle was like a big, big street,\nand we walked to the ghetto works and we walk in. No Jewish policemen. Not the same\nGermans. Completely new people, and they walk us into one of the places and I see some\ndead bodies, not lying on the...1n between the two barracks, and some guy that I fix a\nsweater for him - I thought he was, you know, war, how do you call it - prisoner of war,\nall of a sudden is wearing a German uniform with a with a machine gun. And we walk in\nto that room and everybody from the people, all the people asking what is happening in\nghetto, what is happening in ghetto. I said, because they had no windows out into the\nghetto and I said, we don't know what's happening in the ghetto. What's happening here?\nAll we know is that somebody told us they are taking away...they didn't say we\nknow...they're taking away all the children, old people over a certain age, and anybody\nthat's sick - they're taking them away. And I know my father's on the other side, and I\nknow my mother's home with the two kids, my two little sisters, and I didn't know what\nto do, and I came to him and he said, oh my, Maruska, he says, come on - I'll take you to\nyour father. And the women that were friends of my mother and my brother are dragging\nme back. She says don't go. The minute somebody walks out or he beats them up or he\nshoots them. I said but I have to go to see my father, I said. And I fixed him - I told you I\nfixed him a sweater for him and I was very good to him and he says, Maruska, tell me. I\nknow you have two little sisters. Tell me where they are. I'll go and help you. And you\nknow, sometimes I was eleven but sometimes like I told you I was forty, and my mind\nstart working. I said oh no. He's wearing a German uniform. He's having a gun. Even if I\nI tell him one word...I said you know I don't live with my mother anymore. I'm grown up.\nI have my own place. He said you never told me that. He said would you like to see your\nfather? I said, yes, very much. And again, my mother's girlfriends and my father's friends\nare dragging me back into the other side, and I thought to myself, what do I have to loose.\nMy mother and my two little sisters are not there anymore. I want to see my father.\nand . And it so happened, like one time a doctor told me I have nine\nlives...I have to figure out how many more times before I broke my leg again...and he\ntook me to my father. And you know, the most God-forsaken thing I've ever seen is eight\nmen holding their head on their...hands on their head, walking around and crying like\nbabies because through their window, through the Jordan break out a window, you could\nsee the way the Germans are dragging, with hand grenades...they were opening the\nbunkers that children were hidden. They were dragging old people and everyone in that\nroom had somebody, had children, had a wife at home, or had somebody because they\nwere working for the Jordan brigade and they were protected a little bit with that. And\nwhat do I do? All of a sudden I turn eleven again. I put my hand on my head and I start\ncrying and I start following them. At three o'clock they called off the Kinderaktion and I\nand my father stopped running, and I told you before my Uncle Menashke Saposhnikov\nwas one of the leaders of the underground, so they had to run by their home, so my aunt\nwas lying and bleeding...they took away his two little boys, and my other aunts were\nhelping her and I grabbed my father's arm and we start running in, and we run into this\nlittle house...was a peasant house where my mother was with two kids, and there is no\nsound, nothing. And I stopped crying. I said, Papa, they're dead. Papa, they're \"toit\". And\nall of a sudden we heard from upstairs, \"knock\", \"knock\", \"knock\", - knock. And my\nmother says quiet. They're not dead. And she opened up that little board that she had, and\nshe dragged down the two kids, and they were completely out...I think a little bit over-\ndosed. She gave them sleeping tables, and she tells us what happened. I practically and\nmy father fainted right there. And she said, the machines were driving around the ghetto\nand saying, everybody stay in their house. Anybody that comes out gets shot. And she\ndidn't know what to do. So she took these sleeping tablets and she gave it to the kids, she\nbroke open a little board in there. She, she was thinking fast. She dragged them up. She\nput them flat. Dragged herself up, tipped over the tables so the sand should fall off it\nbecause sand came down, and she was lying with them, so when the Germans came in to\nlook if there's children or anybody in the house, they didn't see nothing and they were\nalready dead asleep and my mother was still lying flat, but they had picks. They went into\nthe floor and they went into the top with the picks. In fact one of my little sister was just\ngrazed, and she pushed them from one side to the other, and she was also afraid to push\nthem because in case the sand start coming down but the Germans thought the sand was\ncoming down from their picks. I\n01:32:\nrealize it now...of course I didn't know it at that time, you know, but she was afraid at that\ntime. And she had a little hole that she saw this machines. She saw those mothers taking\nthe kids to the, to those to those machines. And people dragging them and the mothers,\nthey didn't want to give the children up, was being beaten or a dog sent on her, and she\nsaved my two little sisters. Now there was a rumor that...she was a brave lady. She was a\nbeautiful lady. Good, brave, and that they don't have the quota. It's going to go on again.\nSo I said Momma, let me up with the children, up there, and you go in to the ghetto\nworks on my papers. She said no, you go with your poppa. You're going to be missed and\nthere's going to be something not kosher, and we went away, and she stayed with the\nchildren up there, and they called off again the aktion later on and she saved those two\nlittle sisters, and I'm selfish enough to think if my mother wouldn't have saved my two\nlittle sisters, maybe she would have been alive for a little while longer because she was a\nvery young woman. Because when we were, when the ghetto was liquidated and we were\nsent into the death camp, to Stutthof, they separated her with the two kids and they took\nher away. At that time, to tell you the truth, I didn't know what a crematorium means. I\ndidn't even know what a crematorium 1s. I know one thing is that when they were still\nalive and the ghetto was going on, before it was liquidated, we had to move them. Don't\nforget one was born in ghetto. My little sister Rosale never knew\n01:34:\nwhat it means to have one piece of bread and a full glass of milk. And what we did is,\nthose new apartments...they made the ghetto smaller again and we had to move the kids,\nso the little one we put in a potato sack instead of taking part of her valuables that was\nleft over, and the middle one, the one that was younger than I, we put her hair up, we put\nlipstick and we put her between me and my father and my mother in front, and we slipped\nthrough because we were not far, like I told you, for the German Kommandatur. So what\nhappened is every time they made the ghetto smaller, we had to move them, and the little\none was so smart. She was one and a half years old when they liquidated the ghetto, and\nwhat she did 1s, when she saw a German...she knew every German by the name...and\nwhen she saw a German she would grab the seven year old and say, let's go , and\nthey would hide themselves in the closet in a pair of laundry bags. And when they didn't\ntouch them, when they liquidated the ghetto...we were on a field waiting to be put on the\ntrains...they did not touch them. But when they did arrive near Stutthoff, my mother had\npoison tablets. How she got all of them I don't know, and she...father says let's take them\nbecause they were separating the men and sending them to Dachau, and the women and\nthe children sending in to Stutthoff. There came out little wagons with white spots on it,\nwent through a tunnel or something...I don't remember...everything is not so clear to\nme...and my mother, the first time she really put her foot down and she says no. No\npoison tablets. This time we go with destiny. For all the Jewish people are going to go\nthat route. We are going to go and if one finger is left to one of my kids or if any of us 1s\nsaved, it will be worth it to tell the story. And you know, something flipped through my\nmind when she said it, because this is the woman that was sitting at the dinner table when\nwe had the refugees in 1941 from Poland and Austria...I'm going back again...and I was\nvery upset with her. We were sitting at the dinner table. She just came back from taking\nthem clothes and food, and she and my father were talking and when they didn't want us\nto understand what they were talking about, they were talking in Russian, and I\nunderstood Russian. I spoke Russian. And she said, you know, those people are\nexaggerating. Nobody can do what they are telling the Germans are doing. And you\nknow, at, as we were dri...driving into Stutthof in those little wagons and she said, let's go\nwhere everybody's going, I remembered that Momma said this once at the table and I was\nfeeling so sorry for Anna Levine, that little Austrian girl, and...but I don't blame her for it\nbecause a lot of us didn't believe it. Nobody...a lot of Americans don't believe it. A lot of\npeople of the free world don't believe it, so...because she was so good when my father\nwould bring some food from the\nJordan brigade and first it was divided between the family. Then she would take it from\nus and send it to one of my girlfriends, her sister had a little baby...she would take away\nfrom Rosale with some milk and give it to Gitta's sister's baby, and a piece of...a little\npiece of bread here and a little piece of bread here and I don't know where everything\nwent but she was the most good-hearted person in the world and this is what happened in\nStutthof. They separated us and they took me in...you know, have you every watched the\nmovie, , that they show the gynecologist table with all the dirt and filth. I wrote to\nthe director a letter - 1t was done very wrong, because at thirteen and a half, they put me\non one of those tables to look for gold, and it wasn't a dirty room. The room was\ncompletely sterilized, white...like I can remember because that one thing will never come\nout of my mind, and the doctor was...or whoever he was...was all in white with a mask,\nand he was looking for gold in me, and that's why I said they were very wrong because\nthe Germans weren't working, they wouldn't have worked in a room like that, a doctor,\nbecause everything was white. All I remember is white. White, white, white, and I\nremember a gynecologist table. I never knew about it. Until I got pregnant with my son, I\nnever went to a gynecologist, and even now I have very very bad feelings when I have to\ngo up on one. It's a terrible thing to tell it in a video, but I have to tell you that, because\nit's wrong. The movie was done wrong. So when J arrived in Stutthof and they took my\nmother away and I couldn't go with her, I didn't want to live anymore. I just said to\nmyself whatever I do, I don't care anymore. So they said that they are going to take us to\nlittle labor camps because they need working power. Again they start sorting, you\nknow...the strong one, the not strong ones. But before I go on I have to tell you the story\nwhy I have that mark on my head. Max, the sadist from Stutthof, one of the biggest\nsadists that ever existed. See, they didn't have a chance to shave our hair, because most of\nthe Eastern European ghettos were being liquidated, so everybody was coming at one\ntime, so they had time to give us the uniforms, our numbers, but they didn't have time to\nshave our hair, so I had big long braids, black braids, so at six o'clock...I don't know what\ntime it was...1t was still dark...bare-footed...we didn't have any shoes, Max yells appell, so\nI asked the woman that had threw us, at night they threw us into the barracks on top of\nother women... what do they mean. Said keep quiet and get out and stand still. So I stand\nstill and SS and he goes through the lines like this, like a maniac. I'll never forget,\nand he said, \"Du schwarzer Teufel Du wirdst Stubenaelteste\" you black devil are going to\nbe some kind of a post of some kind of clean the latrine or stubenaeltester, you know, the\nhead of the barrack. And I was still braiding, I'm still trying, still braiding my braid. I\ndon't know where my mother is. With the kids I don't know what's happening here. See, I\nwent ahead of myself. I'm telling you back what happened to me with Max, and I said:\n\"was\". Takes me, he breaks my head and hit me on the barrack with my head, and I start\nbleeding. As the coming down bleeding and I was so confused I didn't know what was\nhappening. Why is that man doing it to me? What are those people all around me doing\nshivering in in striped uniform? Where am I? Where is my mother? All of a sudden I\nturned thirteen again. What is happening to me? And I looked at him with my two black\neyes...they were black and big at that time...and I said, and I looked at him and I didn't\ncry. I didn't move. The blood was running and I didn't do nothing. And that sadist that\ndidn't have a mind of his own thought I was supernatural. That's what saved my life.\nEvery time he came into the barrack to beat up the women, every time we were standing\nin line, he was knocking out the soup from our hand...that little bit of water and ___ that\nwe got. He never touched me. I didn't know why, because at that time I didn't figure it\nout. Now that I'm grown up and I know a little bit of psychology, I figured it out. He\nthought I was supernatural. How can I get help? How can I heal with a big cut like that\nand how can I look him straight in the face without crying. That means I didn't hurt. I was\nsupernatural, so he was afraid to touch me again. And that's what saved my life in\nStutthof and then when they were sorting out the people, stronger on one side, that he\nwas drunk...other people did it. I think so. So we went and they put three boats to go out\nto those little camps to work. And I was in one of the boats and then they decided they\ndon't need three boats and one of boats they set on fire, and the people start jumping from\nthat boat and trying to get on the other boats, and that was dipping the other boats, and\nyou know, I was sitting in my home and watching the boat people and I was crying and\nmy son says to me, Mom, why are you crying? It's natural thing to people that and\nDavid. History repeats itself and I told him the story. At that time he was about already\neleven and a half years old. I don't know how old he was. He was old enough that I could\ntell him, and I told him the story what happened, you know, in the water with the three\nboats when they were taking us to the little camps. It's all very not clear in my mind. I\ndon't know how to tell it to you, which boat it was and how the people jumped, but I\nknow when I saw the\nboat people, everything was coming back to me. People jumping out of a boat. People\ntrying to get into another boat, so something clicked in my mind. All of a sudden I\nrealized that something like this somewhere happened to me, and that's what happened.\nAnd they came in those little labor camps digging foxholes and I didn't care what\nhappened to me at that time because it was so close when they took away my mother and\nthe two little children and I don't know if they were killed in Stutthof, if they were taken\naway somewhere else, because I know they gave them civilian clothes. So why take them\nto a crematorium in Stutthof and put civilian clothes on them. But I still know that it\nhappened in Stutthof and they...for me they died in Stutthof. Maybe they took them to\nTheresienstadt. I don't know where they took them. And I just didn't want to go on\nanymore, but you know, in back of mind was one thing - survive, survive. Take revenge.\nSurvive. Take revenge. Survive. Take revenge. So what I would I do is those little camps,\nthey're always stationed near a lake and in the winter I would break open the ice and I\nwould wash myself with the, with cold water and the tea that they gave us...the hair start\ngrowing out.... would rub into my head, the warm tea. So Mrs. Gelta (ph) and ves\nis alive, she lived a hundred and twenty because she saved my life...she was a\nlageraltester, decided that I was the young...they knew I was the youngest there, that I\nshould work in the kitchen. Peel potatoes or clean the kettles...we had field kettles there\nfor the little bit of soup that they gave us, but I was always clean. I always clean. I always\nkept myself clean, and the shoes that I got in Stutthof was already worn out, so I wore a\npair of wooden shoes that they got for me and I worked in the kitchen and they would\nalways...now I realize it...they never gave us normal people for SS people. They were\npeople that were sick...they were people that were retarded, people that had syphilis. I\nfound it out after this because at one time a German came to us. Eingedeutshter Pole.\nYou know, a Polish German and he came over and he sat on the kettle and looked at me.\nLike that. And then he came to my step-mother, and later she was my step-mother but she\nwas my mother's friend and he said, Rochele, he said. I'm going to marry the Maruska\nafter the war, and she was thinking...you know...you should live that long. And one day\nhe went home for...oh how to say it...for vacation and he came back and he brought back\nwith him some shoes and some meat and bread and he brought me a whole package out\nto the kitchen, and there were some Jewish girls like our lageraltester that lived\nOl :47:50\nwith the Germans, and they saved a lot of our lives in that camp, in that little camp, by\ndoing that because the Oberscharfuerer was not bad, because they controlled him a little\nbit and they lived in a cell by themselve, all figured out for them, and I said to myself,\nthey just took away my mother and my two little sisters, and I will have to do what they\ndo - not on his life. So the Oberscharfuerer was standing downstairs with the people on\nappell to take them to work, and the kitchen was raised on a little hill...I1 took the whole\npackage and let it down the hill and it stopped right next to the Oberscharfuehrer's feet.\nThey put him in bunker for two weeks. When he came out, he start beating up the\nwomen, and I didn't know what to do about it, so all of a sudden the Allies start coming\nnear, so we start walking. It was the last march, you know, that long march. And we start\ngoing and we had the black SS and with me, I always had a little bit of imagination. I\ndon't know where I found a needle and I pulled most of my blanket out with thread and I\ncut off...at that little camp we were wearing red stars instead of yellow stars painted on\nour clothes, civilian clothes, and what I did is I took pieces out from one side and covered\nthe star like a little pocket. I must have had the talent from my father because I was a\ndesigner out here when I came to this country...went to art school...and I, to open it and\nclose it. And I thought to myself maybe I will be able to run away. And maybe I won't be\nable to run away, so I had that thing, but one of the guys...we called him Willie the\nDancer...each of them had a name...he knew that I had those covered somehow. How he\nfound out I don't know, so we were walking on the way and that German that I told you,\nthat Poland, from Poland, you know, the Polish German, he tried and he beat a\nwoman terrible and Willie the Dancer comes up to me and said, Maruska, he says, there\nis a big, you know...everybody was mixing together...the Wehrmacht, our fronts were\ngoing, and my step-mother's, my mother's friend feet, they're already frozen at that time.\nMine were frozen but not as bad because we were walking over the Weichsel, you know,\nthe Ger...the Polish river and my heels were made out of snow, you know, because in the\nwooden shoes, but after 1t was completely frozen but one good thing about ;\nnone of our people were shot. None of them. They couldn't walk any more. We just\ndragged them. Everybody dragged each other, so when we came to that...and he came out\nand he says to me really, let's go over to the...cover your stars, he says. I want you to go\nwith me somewhere. I got scared to death. I thought he was going to shoot me right there,\nand at that time everybody was hungry. Nothing was to eat. If we got a half a potato a\nday, a raw potato, it was lucky. So he says come with me, but just talk as little German as\nyou can, and I spoke a little bit so we came to that to the Wehrmacht and he introduced\nme as their Lithuanian Eingedeutschter, Lithuanian cook that cooks for the German, and\nif he can have some food from them because they took everything away from the farmers.\nSo what we got is we got a pig. We got potatoes and we got one of those big field kettles\nto cook it in. Who can open a pig? Who can do anything? We cooked up the potatoes.\nThe pig was already cleaned, but not very\n01:52:\nclean. We cooked up the pig, and we cut it up in pieces and we took it out in basket to\nour camp, to the women, to give it to them. And as we were giving out the potatoes, that\nGerman that I told you about, that beat up the women when he came out of the bunker,\nthat said he was going to marry me, was holding his gun to hit my step-mother, my\nmother's friend at that time. I grabbed the gun, with the basket I was holding with the\nfood, and he turned around to shoot me and when he saw my face, he didn't touch me and\nhe never touched another woman. Never. And when they took away the black SS and\ngave us some different Germans, because they took away the black SS to fight for\nthem,at Danzig, whoever they can get, , they had us in like in a camp. They\nwere afraid to kill us. They were afraid...they didn't know what to do with us. So he threw\na blanket over to me so I keep warm. I don't know what was going on in his mind, but at\nthat, that time, they left...that time I told my, my mother's friend at that time, Rochele, my\nstep-mother, I said we'll hide you in the straw and what happens happens. You can't go\non anymore. Now this is all...don't forget I am only, not even fifteen years old yet. I'm\nfourteen years old, and we hid her in the straw and she survived. A Polish family found\nher, and it was practically the...the Russians were there already so they were afraid to kill\nus so they kept us. One of her feet, her toes were taken off after the war. And all ofa\nsudden, another little story happened. In the camps are going around the rumors and I\nknow that my two aunts, my two mother's sisters, were in the camp with Sochne?? _.\nThat was...in their house was the commandanteur. They were friends of the family, and\nall of a sudden those two camps meet and Sochne works there with the...works with her\ndaughters, and I yell, ; , Where 1s Pave (?). Where is Taivele. She said that\nis dying. She's in a in a, you know, wagon, with a horse. Perele had come back\nto Stutthof and all of a sudden I see her daughter's feet bleeding so I drag up half of my\nblanket and I said bind your feet in it, and I...the childish head of mine, didn't think to do\nmy own feet like that, so then when I told her, so I ran to the wagon where my Aunt\nwas lying and the German was beating me go back to your place so she was\nalready dead under this straw and I went back to the place and then it fall into my head to\nbind my feet in my blanket instead of letting them bleed to death, because during the day\nthe snow would melt and then if you would sleep in a silo, it would freeze at night back\nto our feet. So we always prayed to God that we would sleep in a cow barn, because it\nwas warm. Can I drink some water?",
        "A: Yes. OK. We'll stop here for a minute. They're going to need to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2",
        "A: So we walked and we walked and finally they couldn't move us any more. And they put\nus put us in a silo in a village called Cheno (ph), and the two typhuses broke out and I\nwas holding on and it's the funniest thing...you can imagine what Germans they always\ngave us, in the end too...that were the kapo, a German, that came to the door in the\nmorning. He said, who is dead should say so. And you would get up in the morning and\nyou would find dead people on each side of you. In fact one of the people that you\ninterviewed yesterday, his mother died next to me. And I walk out...remember in the\nbeginning of the tape I told you my mother would send milk to my friend's sister's little\nbaby...she was a kapo in one of the camps, and she...all the kapos and all the\nlageraltesters slept in the village away from the silo because of the typhuses...maybe they\nthought they'll survive better. I don't know what happened. I couldn't account for\nanybody else except myself, and I came out and she was standing and the food...around\nthe food and everything and you know, it's a blank her name for me. I can't even mention\nher name. This is how I blanked her out, and I said just give me a ...because I was getting\nalready a temperature. I felt it, you know. And I said just give me a little bit of the hot\nwater. I don't want any food. She said, well stay away from me with all that lice. And I\nturned around and I walked away. I couldn't even cry anymore. And all those things went\nthrough...her sister and her little baby and my mother giving the food and that minute\neverything went through my mind and I went into the silo and she saw that she did a\nmistake, and she came to the\n02:02:\ndoor and she said, Maruska, come here. Here is some tea. And I turned and I covered\nmyself with straw, that I didn't want to know about her. And they told us that they are\ngoing to burn that silo and there was a little girl next to me, Chajele, that we'd spend the\ntime together all the time, keeping each other, and I said you know that that piece of\nblanket that I have left over...you still can walk. Why don't you run? I can't walk\nanymore, and when I heard the yelling, I though they were burning the silo so I covered\nmyself with the straw and I slipped into unconsciousness and when I woke up, I woke up\nin a home that the Russians are taking care of me medically, and before I even have a\nchance to breath properly, they told us they have to move out of there. The front is\ncoming near. We have to go to Laurenburg (ph), so in that German house they found\nsome clothes they gave us, and they gave us medicine and we walked a couple of\nkilometers and they saw...there were two Russians officers driving in a two-horse\ncarriage, you know, in the back just two seats and I and Chajele are walking and I said\ncould you take us? And he says no...we shouldn't, but you know what...we'll take you.\nThey saw that we fall practically down but we'll leave you out right before Laurenburg\nand everybody was walking and the shooting was going on, and they drove us up to\nLaurenburg, and the first house we walked in. Now you may think I'm superstitious but\nnow I realize what it was, you know. There was nothing in that house except one bottle\nof black berries and it was standing in the middle of the floor and I...so hell, I don't care if\nit's poisoned , if not. I'm going to drin...eat a part of it. Said I'll eat 1t too, and we both fell\nasleep and we got up and we felt better. Now I realized that 1t must have been fermented,\nand we both got drunk on it, on those black berries and we fall asleep and maybe that's\nwhat helped knock down with all the medication that we got, and they took us to a\nRussian hospital and they shaved our head, because it was all full of thing. They put a\ngreen solvent, and you can imagine...I was forty-five kilo when I was liberated, and I\nlooked like hell, and in Laurenberg they said said go and look for a home. So I...about\nthree or four girls that looked better already that were older than than me...they say come\nMaruska. Come and live with us, because the Russian, they're, you know, raping the\nJewish girls, the German girls. They didn't care. They were going on the front. They\ndidn't give a damn who it was. So and then you had to sign typhus...they didn't even\nlisten, so what they did is they gave me a\nlittle bottle of medicine that the hospital gave me, and every time a drunk Russian, no\nmatter how drunk he was, came in or something, they send me out with my all that green\nstuff on my head and like this and I walked out like a dead woman, and when they saw\nme coming they start running. But then my hair start growing in and I start getting a little\nbetter, they said no. We can't stand it anymore, so we went to the Russian\ncommandanteur and at that time I didn't give them no . [just wanted to go home\nand see if anybody's alive. And we went to the Russian. They said oh yes, we'll send you\nhome and they put us on trucks and they sent us to farms in Pomerania, and there's a story\nby itself. We arrive in Pomerania and there's cows, sick cows and sick pigs and sick\nthings, you know, and they want, needed food for Russia so what they did is they opened\na cheese factory, where they couldn't use the cows and they didn't know what to do with\nit, so the Russian girls that went...Ukrainian Russian girl... I thought that went the\nGermans were playing the piano and the Jewish girls were cleaning the stalls from the\ncows, everything. After the concentration camp and after what they went through so in\none time it comes, the captain comes to us. He says who wants to go in Rickenwald (ph).\nThere is a veterinarian doctor from Moscow and he wants to teach you to be a\nveterinarian nurse. In two weeks he wants to teach us to be a veterinarian nurse, so I am\ngame. I'm game of anything. I said I'm going. I mean, there we were also kept like in a\nprison but not as bad because we had food, we had clothes, everything, but we could\nnever walk from one village to another without a Russian soldier. So I went to\nRickenwald and it so happened...I must read (ph) of my father and I told the Polkovniks\n[colonel]wife, I said you know, you don't wear this dress. This is a nightgown. Put on\nthis. I said you have so much clothes and I told her all the hair, you should do it, you\nknow, that way. I made very good friends with her, and the doctor that was supposed to\nteach us was a drunkard. Was very sick, very drunk, so he would teach us about two\nhours a day. The rest of the time he would get drunk and after two weeks, he gave us a\nbig stamp. He said, , I'm a veterinarian nurse. So I came back to the camp, and\nthey put...Polkovnik came to visit one time...this is during the Russian. This, I'm liberated\nalready. And he said I want Maruska (ph), Mar...Maruska at the table. And the captain\nsaid, Maruska at the table. He said yes. I told you when I telephoned you that I want her\nat the table. My wife wants to talk to her. So he saw that I am good friends with\nPolkovnik and the Russian soldiers loved me very much because I worked where the\nmilk was delivered and were going to the cheese factory, so the Russian soldiers wouldn't\nget anything to eat, and when we came back, what they did is what they did with the\ncows that they captured, we checked if they have tuberculosis and we would cut around\nthe lungs...would have the German people cut around the lungs and then the rest they\nwould cut, cook it for the Russian soldiers. The good ones they would make conserves\nthemselves. They opened a conserve factory and send it to Russian and so the cheese, the\nRussian soldiers didn't get nothing, so they would come at twelve o'clock at night and I\nwould give them the milk and I would give them whatever there was. The captain had\neverything at the table, but the soldier had nothing. So they liked me very much. And\nPolkovnik liked me, so how does he get rid of me. He makes me...now remember, this is\n'45 and it was beginning of '45 when I was liberated and went though it. Let's say I was\nfifteen years old. I wasn't even fifteen years old, and\nthey send me as the head of the cheese factory, and they send and a big house\nand I get the house of the woman that owned it, and she got to be my housekeeper but she\nnever was because she was a beautiful lady, and I made up...one thing I forgot to tell\nyou...I'm going to take revenge. I'm going to take revenge of the people, so I was riding a\nhorse, being that I was a veterinarian nurse I had to go to the fields and see 1f the cows\nare clean, if the German women are taking care of it, and I saw some children on the\nstreet and I would fly by with my horse and and I was careful not to hurt them, but I\nthought I had and I walked into a German house and I would, with my boot I was always\nopening like they did our house, and you know after four weeks what I did. I stole from\nthe Russians and I gave the medicine, because we Jewish people are compassionate\npeople and we cannot see anybody suffer. Took medicines to them. I took food to them.\nWould you believe it? And the German woman in Pommern, she was Polish-German,\nand she took care of me and I wouldn't let her and she was my equal. She was supposed\nto be my servant. She was my equal and I was fifteen years old and my mind was\nworking and one story I have to tell you that 1s the most fantastic story, that I am writing\nabout my experience after the war with the Russians. He came to me one day and he says\nto me, you know, he says to me I had a lot of, before that I tell you I had a\n02:11:\nlot...there was to clean. There was a big airport not far from where I stayed in ;\nand they brought...a lot of fliers, majors and captains would come to visit me. They were\nboar hunting, you know, and they brought vodka and there was a piano and they were\nplaying and when they got real drunk...that that housekeeper of mine, that lady that\nowned the \"gut\"[estate], would lock me in her room that they couldn't touch me.\n(Laughter) You understand what I mean. But they were very close to me, so the captain\ncame to me and said I have a problem. I said what's your problem? He said I need seven\nhorses. I said why? He said because the horses is in my village and my ranch and my\nPolkovnik and he said I want seven horses because is coming and only you can\nhelp me, because the people love you here and they'll give it to you. I said nobody gives\nnothing because it came out I think that the Russians cannot take anything away from the\nGermans, from farmers, anything. Nothing can be touched again. No cows, no horses,\nnothing. What's theirs belongs to them. Not far from me was also a officer, a Polish\nofficer camp from the Pole...for the Polish people soldiers, so I said OK. On one\ncondition. That you release every Jewish girl that wants to go out of your camp I said,\nand I want them sent right here. I'll stay. I said I'll stay. He says no, I'll make with you a\ndeal. For every horse you get me, one girl can go. I'll take them to the train. I said fine,\nyou sign it for me so I can show it to the . I said I want to have something over\nyou. So he did. Now remember, this is all a fifteen year old talking and it's the truth, it's\nthe honest truth with God as my witness. What I did is...I had at that time I invited six,\nsix because there were not seven, six Polish officers to a party in my home. There were\nthe Russian, a couple of Russian officers came in with vodka and caviar and everything\nyou can imagine. The officers had everything and what I did is, they...I said I want you\nto get those guys drunk, as drunk as you can. I had six Russian soldiers, seven because\nwe can only get seven waiting on the side...I knew approximately the size of the officers\nbecause they came to visit very often, and they send me seven of them...I got them so\ndrunk they couldn't move. We undressed them. We put the Polish uniforms on the\nRussian soldiers. They took, they stole six horses. They came back. we put the uniforms\non. I put them on a wagon and I sent them back to the camp, and the captain had seven\nhorses, because one I had kept for him. From then on, I was in danger. He was afraid of\nme. You understand what I mean. Because I had something over him. But I had the\nprotection of the Russian soldiers. I had the protection of the German people - they like\nme because I didn't hurt them in any way. I had the protection of a lot of officers that\nknew me, the protection of the polkovnik. So one day I am going with a man from\nGeorgia, from Russia, a soldier, riding into the fields to look over what's going on, and a\nshort Jewish man comes up to me and said, you know somebody by the name of Maruska\nSaposhnikov and I said . And that man from Grushin, from Georgia, says to me,\ndon't worry Maruska, he says. Whatever this man wants from you, nothing will be said. I\nsaid I have to leave without nothing or anything. He wants to take me. My father is alive\nin Lodz and he wants to take me with him. My father sent\nhim. Now if you want to go and tell to the captain, you're alright. Go tell him. But I have\nto go. He said not only will I let you go, I will take you there with that gentleman. But I\nsaid I can't let you do it, but you know what I'll do. I said I will write you a letter what\nhappened between me and the captain. You just say to him you have a letter about the\nsecret seven horses from Maruska, I said, and that's all...that nothing, I don't think\nnothing will happen to you. But I said I appreciate it. He took us to the train and we left\nand I met my father in Lodz. And later on, some girls escaped from there too, some\nJewish girls. He kept his word. Some of them were released. They escaped and they told\nme that that guy lies ina hammock and it's catered to him. Masha they said... at that time\nI was calling myself already Masha. Maruska, what did you do? I said this is between me\nand that Grushin, nobody else and that's the story about the seven horses. I'll never forget\nit. As many things I did to him that he didn't know, you know. When I came back from\nRiegenwald, being a veterinarian nurse that I was not...I knew that much, all I knew is\nhow to take analysis, a blood analysis from a horse, and somebody had to hold him, and\nhow to cut around the lungs from the cow, and how to see that everybody, that everything\nis clean. And when I came back from Riegenwald after the polkovnik was there, in about\na period of three weeks, the Jewish girls are playing the piano and the Russian girls were\ncleaning the stalls. But I was in danger from them also. So I had to run away somehow,\nso my father found out where I was from somebody and he sent that man to get me out of\nthere, and this is how I came to Lodz, because my father survived Dachau and we met in\nLodz. And then we had to go to, run away from the AK, from the fascists in Lodz\nbecause you couldn't go out. I didn't speak Polish. My father didn't speak Polish, so\nhow...you couldn't even go out on the street. My father was working as a tailor. He hardly\nmade a living, but one thing he did is he had an apartment. Everybody went to to Lodz\nfrom somewhere, one camp or another...he wouldn't let them go back to Lithuanian.\nAlways kept them there. It was a big, big apartment. Many people told me before I even\ncame what my father did for them. But it was also a beautiful thing that he did and he\ndied pretty young, and what happened is is we had to smuggle the border. So how do we\nsmuggle the border. It costs a lot of money. So Masha went to work in a kibbutz in Lodz\nand made friends with the Brichah and took a transport in 1945...I wasn't even fifteen\nyears old...in July I was fifteen. I took a transport with my father and my...at that time she\nwas already my step-mother, Rochele, all through to Bratislava and the AK was shooting\nafter us, and I stopped the people because my step-\n02:19:\nmother couldn't walk that well. She just had an operation in Poland and they were\nshooting. The people were screaming and I said I promised you to get you across and I\nwill get you across, and I got them across to Bratislava. But I loved Austria...and I stayed\nin Austria after the war and I went to school there, and my husband was , before\nI met my husband. And I worked for the Brichah. I helped people smuggle from\nsonnenfeld because I went to school. I spoke pretty good Austrian. Let my braid grow\nagain. Put on an Austrian outfit into Sonnenfeld and smuggled people over the Innsbruck\nborder into Italy with the Brichah. Many times were shot after. And when I got married I\nthink I settled down a little bit. And I came to America and we lost ev...my husband lost\neverything we had and one thing I'll never forget. We came into New Orleans and\nsomebody once asked me, how do you like this country? I said oh, this country is\nwonderful, but why...I didn't speak very good English...my husband spoke the King's\nEnglish and he wanted me to go to school again. I said school again? Never. He said\nremember, when we come come to America, I won't help you. You'll have to go to\nschool. Why don't you do it now? I said no. First my father, then you...school, school,\nschool. I'm tired of school. So, but I read. He read to me a lot, and when we came in I\nknow what hot means and I know what dog means. I said I understand everything. It's a\nbeautiful country. I have bananas to eat. Everything is...but why do people eat hot dogs?\n(Laughter) Because that's the only thing I could read. And like I said I came here and I\nstart working and I went to school. I finished high school and I start...I had a small degree\nin college that is not great, and I I had an art major so I start designing and I designed\nknitted clothes for a lot of movie people, because we came direct...in New Orleans we\nwere two days. We came direct to Los Angles because my husband had a brother here.\nsent us affidavits and he was broke. And we had, we didn't get from the HIAS,\ndidn't get nothing. My husband was broke because everything was stolen that they\nshipped from Budapest, but we made it. We made it and I love this country and I wish it\nwas when I came in '49 the same way it was then. But everything changes, but it's still\none of the best countries in the world. Of course after Israel. I'm a...I'm an American\nZionist. I always was a Zionist. And that's my story up till now. Except before I broke my\nleg, before I came to Washington.",
        "A: I don't know because like I told you, I was a child and with\nme it comes back in flashes. That's why I never will write a book. I talk into a\nmicrophone. If my husband and my son wants and I'm not here anymore, he can take it,\nput it together, do whatever they want, because sometimes at night...I have a little poem\nthat I wrote. When the Memorial was built, there were some flags put up, and I\nhave two flags of my two little sisters and the flags of my family and part of my\nhusband's family that was killed from the Hungarians, and when they built it, it was the\nopening and I was co-chairing and I was the hostess at dinner opening and Hausner (ph)\nwas our main speaker, and I couldn't sleep that night and I got up and I wrote a poem and\nI love that little plain poem. I write poetry from time to time. And that little plain poem I\nlove so much, because it tells so much about me. In the couple of little words it says so\nmuch so when I was in England the last time I found a friend of mine that was an actor\nand I composed some works and I got permission from the Barry sisters to use their\nmusic, and we made a little tape out of it and I think your producer has it, 1f you wanted\nto play it.\nMUSIC\n02:24\nThe poem that you are about to hear was written by Masha Loen, who as a child\nexperienced and survived what is probably the most dramatic and tragic event in the\nhistory of mankind - the Holocaust. Of the six million Jews who died or who were put to\ndeath by the Nazis, one and a half million were children. This was only forty years ago,\nwithin living memory. Yet to many, the Holocaust is a distant and even forgotten episode\nin history. To those who may have forgotten, it 1s hoped that in this simple but moving\npoem, which was written by a child who survived the horror, the world and future\ngenerations will remember the unfortunate victims, the survivors and especially those\nwho still have to live with the nightmare, with the sorrow of having lost loved one. Never\nbut never must it be that people become complacent or take the attitude, oh, that was long\nago. That has nothing to do with me. But worse still, let by-gones be by-gones. No. Never\nshall you forget, nor your children, nor your children's children. No. Never must mankind\nforget what heinous crime a nation committed on fellow men. The question that must be\nasked is, oh God, why did you let it happen?\nI was a little girl, lost and sad.\nMy mother told me I was not bad.\nThen why the agony and pain\nThe Nazis inflicted on me with whip and cane.\nThe question was unanswered,\nBecause mother was no more.\nThey took her away to settle the score.\nBy hiding her children, she committed a crime.\nAnd that is why they killed her.\nOh mother of mine.\nI wasn't a little girl for long any more.\nI had to survive to settle that score.\nThe beatings did not hurt.\nHunger was forgotten,\nBecause the one thing in my mind\nWas to take revenge on the lot.\nThe time came and I emerged out of hell and pain.\nAnd the stories I will tell over and over again.\nNow the time has come.\nYou are a Statistic no more.\nAnd Memorial is settling the score.\nRosalie and , with one and a half million\nThat were killed during the Holocaust years,\nFor the years to come when I am not here,\nSomebody else will see the flag\nAnd shed for you a tear.\nMUSIC\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: See, the revenge I'm doing 1s, like I said in the poem, it should never happen again. I got\nalso is that I lecture on the Holocaust. I go. I work. I worked very hard\nto open the Memorial. I will do anything for any memorial. I don't care if there's a\nmemorial in each corner, because like I said, we are a compassionate people. We cannot\ngo out and kill. We cannot go out and do certain things that we thought we were going to\nbe able to do, that we learned from the Germans, but we didn't. So the only way we can\ndo it is to prevent it from ever happening to any people, to anybody, no matter of\nreligion, race or or or or creed or whatever it is. Those things can not be happening and\nthat's my revenge...is staying ten days with the Mormons in Utah, in southern Southern\nat Southern Utah college, to go anywhere, rain or shine, if I'm called...or ten year olds in\na temple. But I will talk about it till I die. And that is my revenge because I can't do it any\nother way.\n"
