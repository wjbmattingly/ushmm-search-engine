        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage l\nHelen Fagin interview, 2/13/95\nSWB: Why don't you tell me a little about your experience\nbefore liberation took place.\nHELEN FAGIN: Immediately before liberation, is that what\nyou're asking for?\nSWB: Go back a little bit.\nHELEN FAGIN: Well j- I'l1l-I'll just touch the highlights.\nThe Holocaust began for me exactly the day World War w- two\nstarted, which is Friday morning, September one, 1939. Our\nhouse was bombed Saturday morning, September 2, 1939. And\nwe were on the run since then. We finally returned to our\nhome town of Radumska, Poland, where we stayed with friends,\nand soon after that the ghetto was formed. We stayed in the\nRadumska ghetto through 1942. In 1942, September of 1942,\nmy parents were taken away from us and sent to Treblinka,\nwhere they perished. My two sisters and I, then, remained\nin the ghetto, but we stayed there until the liquidation of\nthe ghetto. I was able to escape the march to the railroad\nstation, having sent away my other two sisters before. And\nI was hiding, I was hiding for a long time and then I\ncouldn't hide any longer. I was able to find my way to a\nlarge ghetto in Warsaw. I stayed in the Warsaw ghetto until",
        "the uprising. Then just before the uprising I was able to\nget out of the ghetto, and I was on so-called Aryan papers,\nwhich is false papers. In the mean time, I was caught, and\nuh worked in a camp, in aw- ina labor camp, but then was\nreleased and was taken back to the Warsaw ghetto. I was\nliberated in Poland, February 17 of 1945. And tried to find\nmy two sisters. We were able to reunite for a very, after a\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage 2\nlong long search. And then the decision was made that we\ncould not stay in Poland because we lost everyone, we lost\neverything, and there was no reason to stay in Poland.\nMostly because the atmosphere was not very inviting. Uh,\npeople resented those Jews who have been liberated, and\nresented the fact that some Jews survived. And uh, we had\nsome personal experiences which persuaded us not to stay in\nPoland.\nSWB: Tell me about those.\nHELEN FAGIN: Well, for example prior to us uh leaving for\nthe ghetto, we had some personal possessions that we took",
        "when we fled, and we entrusted these possessions to a_e so\ncalled friend, and uh, after we returned after the end of\nthe world war two to claim these possessions, they wouldn't\nrecognize us, they wouldn't give them back to us, and_ uh,\nuh, they just totally dismissed us. So we decided that this\nwas not a very favorable atmosphere to stay at. And then it\nwas much too painful to stay in Poland. It was um, Poland\nwas not very hospitable. And it was very very painful. The\nmemories and the experiences connected with living in Poland\nwill just, were just too devastating. We were contacted by\nsome people who told us that there 1S a group of Israeli\nyoung boys who formed an organization called Brucha, and\nthat they are helping survivors of the Holocaust...to\nrehabilitate themselves and possibly to find a way of taking\nthem to Palestine. Now Palestine was a place where we knew\nabout because our father was a great Zionist, and he had\npurchased land in Palestine in 1930's. And he had traveled\nto Palestine several times. So we knew that eventually we\nwould like to reach Palestine. Parenthetically as a matter\nof fact, my father had signed me on the list of a uh, higher\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage 3",
        "education which later become, became the Rehovot, Weissmann\nInstitute in Rehovot, in-in then[?] Palestine. SO we\ndecided to put our lives in their hands because there was no\nreal alternative. We were contacted by them and we were\ntold to just, to follow their instructions. And they took\nus on a long journey over the Carpashian mountains. And we\nfound ourselves on the Czechoslovakian side of the\nmountains. In Czechoslovakia we were met by another group\nof young boys who took us through the countryside. And we\nfinally arrived in Bratislava. In Bratislava there was a\nkind of a camp, which was, in auh, actually in a square\nsurrounded by buildings, like a large apartment building\ncomplex. And we arrived there and there were many many many\npeople, meandering back and fro and uh, everyone was in the\nSame Situation as we were. Well we were staying there for a\ncertain time, and I really don't recall how long it was, but\nI remember that we were walking through the streets of\nBratislava, trying to find people who looked familiar, as a\nmatter of fact, we did find some friends who came from our\nhometown, just by sheer chance, and we were very delighted\nto have found somebody we have known. And then we were told\nthat we were going to go on a journey. And that journey's\ngoing to take us into Austria. The object of our journey\nwas to go out of the Russian occupational zone, leave the\nRussian occupational zone and go to the American occupation-\nal zone. Because the conditions were much better and there\nwere some displaced persons camps formed already. In the\nuh, in Austrian territory of the American occupational zone.",
        "We were met by two or three young boys who told us that from\nnow on we have to shed our identity. That we are no longer\nPolish Jews, that we are Jews who are trying to return to\nGreece. Simply because it was felt that no one really in\nAustria would know the Greek language. But people knew\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage 4\nGerman or Czech or Polish or Russian and they could always\nfind somebody who could be the translator for us. SO we\nplayed the role of Greek Jews knowing full well that we\nCannot communicate in the language. So one of the young\nboys told us that we, since we cannot be numb altogether,\nthat we have to make an appearance of being able to\ncommunicate to one another. That perhaps we ought to use\nthe Hebrew prayers because very few of us really could\ncommunicate in Hebrew. So we actually did communicate by\ngesticulating and using the prayers that everybody knew, in\na very conversational tone, so that we would give a uh, some\nkind of an indication that we are communicating with each\nother. When we were traveling the international Red Cross\nwould meet us at the different points of the journey and try\nto help us. And he actually tried to find somebody who knew",
        "the Greek language to be able to speak to us.\nSWB: We have to put another roll of film on...\n[CAMERA RELOAD]\n[CR#2 ]\nSWB: When you start again, why don't you go back and talk\nabout using the Hebrew prayers as your language.\nHELEN FAGIN: So we had to communicate in some kind of a\nlanguage, and because we didn't know the Greek language uh\nwe used Hebrew prayers by simply using them in a\nconversational tone, and gesticulating as if we understood\neach other. Well, we were taken by different modes. of\ntransportation, either by train if we were not worried about\ngoing through stations and being met there by some\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage 5\nofficials, or by trucks. Eventually we reached uh the\nshores of the Danube riv- river, at night. And there were",
        "little boats waiting for us and we got onto the boats and we\ncrossed the Danube. And then we found ourselves on the\nother shore which was already in the American sector. From\nthere we were taken by foot and then later by some other\nconveyance. I remember it must have been trucks, to a camp\npast Mauthausen concentration camp, which was Wels, in\nAustria. And there they uh experience of displaced persons\ncamp began. This was our first displaced persons camp. And\nit was a very depressing experience. First of all, the camp\nhad a fence around it. Secondly, it was guarded by\nmilitary, American military police, by the MP's. Dressed in\nthe white helmets that say MP, they were wearing the MP\nuniform, and they were always carrying guns. We had to\nregister and this is the first time that we registered. We\ngot food rations and I remember that the entire experience\nwas very depressing and very devastating. This was to-\nSupposed to have been the liberating aspect of our\nSituation. But it was not. I remember the anguish, and I\nremember the thought processes that went through my _ mind.\nAnd I remember asking myself what am I doing here. Where am\nI going? Who is going to be waiting for me? How am I going\nto begin my so-called new life? What is in store for me? I\nremember one night, we were awakened about two or there\no'clock in the morning, and the MP's stormed in, and told us\nto get off our bunks, and our bunks were just that, bunks.\nWith burlap sacks filled with straw, this is what we slept\non. And they said that were there because somebody stole a\ncan of peaches. And they searched all those straw sacks for",
        "the hidden can of peaches. I remember that the following\nday, we gathered together and we tried to thing, my _ God,\nwhat is this all about? Fortunately, we didn't stay very\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage 6\nlong in Wels. I really don't recall how long. I believe\nthat perhaps six weeks or so, maybe two months.\nSWB: Were you locked in?\nHELEN FAGIN: We were not locked in, but we were surrounded\nby fences and we really couldn't get out because, number\none, we didn't know where to go, it waS a very isolated\nplace. And secondly, we were really guarded, for whatever\nreason I don't know. [Sound of crows in BG] They took us\nfrom Wels to Lenz in Germany. Lenz was another displaced\npersons camp, but when we arrived there, it was full to\ncapacity. And they couldn't receive us. So we were waiting\nthere on a temporary basis, they couldn't accommodate us\nthere. And finally, they told us that we have to go back on\nthose trucks, and they took th- took us to the south of\nAustria. Into a beautiful place called Badgastein. Which",
        "was a resort, in the Alps, and the accommodations were\nabsolutely phenomenal. They put us up in hotels. And we\nhad nice beddings, and we didn't have to use outhouses any\nlonger. We had bathrooms. And we had indoor showers. In\nWels we had outdoor showers. And that was a tremendous\nimprovement. It was, this camp was under the auspices of\nUNRHA, United Nations Refugee Rehabilitation Administration.\nAnd the conditions were-were-were much improved. There was\na certain aspect of that camp which was different from any\nother. First of all, we were freer to think about our\nfuture. There was a free movement of people in and out.\nAnd we were aware of what was going on in the world. So we\nknew that there was such a thing as exodus. We could leave.\nWe could go by way of Switzerland, to Italy, and we could\nSign up to go on those boats towards Palestine. And we\ncould dream at least of a certain kind of an objective,\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage 7\ncertain kind of a goal, certain kind of a future, that was\nin sight. It was concrete, it was achievable, it was\u2019 do\nable. So those of us who had dreams of going to Palestine\ndid so. We signed up. I believe that we arrived in Badgas-",
        "tein towards the end of September, probably beginning of\nOctober 1945. The international Red Cross sent us packages,\nand we were able to find some decent clothes to wear. With\nthe approaching fall and winter however, we didn't have much\nwinter clothes. But we were satisfied that we could at\nleast have some decent attire. Not too much of it, but we\nwere wearing decent clothes. When winter approached, I\nremember a very fine young lieutenant, from Dayton, Ohio, I\nremember his name, Lieutenant Kyle, approached me once and\nasked me if I had a winter coat, and I said, no I didn't.\nSo he brought me a G.I. blanket. And I remember I cut a\nhole in the middle of the blanket and I wore it aS a cape.\nAnd that was my winter coat and I was very grateful for\nthat. In the camp I was able to work in the office, cause I\nspoke fluent German, and it helped us to know the German\nlanguage to communicate with the rest of the population.\nThe population was not very happy with our presence there.\nBut we did the best we could not to aggravate them and to\nstay out of their way. The life inside displaced persons'\ncamp... waS very interesting. First of all, we tried to\ngain awareness of what the potential, what our future oppor-\ntunities may be. And we got together quite often, young men\nand women, to discuss our situation. The first thing that\nwe did, and that was a very determined act, we were told\nthat if we are of a special, of a certain nationality, we\nwill be given the opportunity to return to the country of\nour origin. And if we make that choice, we had to sign up,\nand we would go to our respective countries. The other",
        "choice was, the other alternative was, to declare ourselves\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage 8\nstateless. And then leave it to whatever fate there is\ngoing to uh be available to us.\nSWB: We need to reload...\n[CAMERA RELOAD]\n[CR#3]\nSWB: When we start, just back up and restate that you had a\nchoice between repatriation...\nHELEN FAGIN: Well ain the displaced persons camp of\nBadgastein, we were given two choices. One, to return to\nthe country of our origin and become repatriated. Or to\nremain in the camp, in that case we have to pronounce\nourselves and declare ourselves stateless. Without any\nright of belonging to any country any longer. That was a uh\nchoice that many of us decided in favor of, becoming",
        "stateless. At that moment of our decision I think we\nsuffered a very tremendous anguish. Because the decision\nhas to be made on the basis of what is there for us in the\nfuture. We knew we cannot go back to Poland, because there\nwas nothing to go back to. We knew we have lost all the\nties to Poland and we Knew that the situation in Poland was\nreally not favorable to establishing any kind of a life for\nourselves. So the decision to become stateless was\u2019 the\nbetter decision. And perhaps the most, the more, the more\npromising decision for our future. And it was, at that\nmoment, I remember, that my thoughts and my feelings ran the\ngamut. It was a period of feeling tremendous anguish, even\ndespair. Liberation was a very bittersweet concept for us\nat that moment. And as much as we longed for being\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage 9\nliberated all these years of the holocaust, the situation of\nhaving been liberated did not hold very much promise for a\nbetter life for us. Our thoughts went back obviously to the\npast, to our childhood, to our youth, to our families, to\nour parents, and there was a tremendous emptiness in our\nsouls and our hearts. There was no jubilation, there was no",
        "happiness, there was almost depression. When we talked,\nwhen we met, we were always somber. And we couldn't really\nunderstand whether or not we made the right decision. We\njust felt in our guts that this was the decision that we had\nto reach. Knowing full well that we are not the masters of\nour own fate, we just had to leave everything to those who\nwould direct us from then on. So many of us decided to be\nas positive as we could. We would gather together and we\nwould attend some kind of lectures, I remembered many of us\ndecided to learn English. Uh we decided to find some books\nor some uh resources that would allow us to get acquainted\nat least with the language so we could communicate with the\npeople of UNRHA, most of whom were either American or\nBritish. And I remember getting some kind of a book with\nverses, with little ditties, little poems, and we were\nlearning them and trying to understand them, and I. still\nremember a couple of them, but uh. We tried to be as useful\nto ourselves as possible. Another aspect of our activities,\nI remember, were political activities. We have found out\nthat the British did not allow the boats to uh land in\nHaifa, and they did not allow, they did not receive the\nrefugees into Palestine. I don't recall whether we learned\nabout the camp of Cyprus at that time or not, but we heard\nthat some of the boats were returned, and we organized\nprotests. And we were marching [light plane noise in BG]\nand protesting, and uh we were very vociferous, very vocal\nagainst the British actions, and we were trying to influence",
        "Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage 10\nthe international Red Cross to express our protest. I know\nthat we had a number of visitors who brought us all this\nnews, of what was going on, and we tried to inform ourselves\nthe best we could. And we tried to help people who are in\nneed, that there was a hospital nearby in Hoffgastein, my\nSister who had some nurses' training was working in that\nhospital. We tried to obtain as much medication as_ we\ncould, to save the health of a number of people who were\nplaced in that hospital. We tried to be as helpful to each\nother as we could. We tried to be as uh social with one\nanother as we could. There were very many kids who didn't\nhave any parents left and who didn't have any siblings, so\nwe tried to sort of form extended families for those who\ndidn't have any families left. We tried to boost each\nothers' hopes and we tried to help each other. The\ninternational Red Cross came there to try to find some of\nour families. We had families, we thought we had families\nin England and we gave them the names and they tried to\nresearch it for us. They did research, uh-uh, some of the\nnames for us. Uh, we tried to communicate with people we\nknew who lived in Israel, I had family in Israel, and _ we\ncontacted them. And we established communications with",
        "Israel. What we were very surprise is that we were not very\nmuch helped by any Jewish organizations in the United\nStates. I don't recall that any of these organizations came\nforward with any help for us. As a matter of fact, I do\nrecall that, that high-S[?] helped with my... with my ticket\nfrom Bremenhaven to New York City, but I also recall that I\ngot a bill for them from them, and eventually I had to repay\nthem the fare of the transport from Bremenhaven to New York.\nI was very surprised and in retrospect I really cannot\nunderstand the fact that when I arrived in New York, nobody\ngave a hoot what has happened, what would happened with me.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage ll\nUh, I uh, was not given the opportunity for education,\nnobody cared about my psychological well-being. Uh, nobody\never asked how in the world is it possible for a_= young\nperson who has gone through five and a half years of\npersecution, and kind of a personal tragedies that we had to\ngo through, and not worry about their psychological well\nbeing. Uh this is something that has always dumbfounded me.\nThat when the Holocaust survivor came to the United States,\nhe or she embarked immediately onto the process of",
        "acculturation, of trying to adapt oneself to the way of life\nof America, to try not to stand out like a sore thumb, to\ntry to melt into the culture and the life, to try not to\nshow that we were different, to try not to act the victim,\nand to try to develop a certain mode of- live in the certain\nkind of a life which would establish us as a normal part of\nthe society. Learning the language, for example. I came\nhere and I didn't know English. And I remember my first act\nwas to buy a dictionary. I couldn't find a Polish-English\ndictionary, I bought a Polish, a German-English dictionary\nand I would buy the New York Times and I would read it with\nthe dictionary.\nSWB: We have to reload.\nHELEN FAGIN: Now would you prefer if I stopped already?\n[CAMERA RELOAD |\n[CR#4]\nSWB: So for example the language, if you could just back up\nto there, coming to this country.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int. HELEN FAGIN\nPage 12\nHELEN FAGIN: Well, oh, I didn't really know English at all.\nAnd uh what I did was I would buy the New York Times\u2019 and\nwith the help of a German-English dictionary, I would read\nit. And I would try to understand it. And then, everyone\nthat I would meet, I would ask them to please correct my\npronunciation, to correct my language, as much as_ they\ncould, because I was very very intent on learning how to\nspeak English. I never learned a word unless I knew its\nspelling, so that I knew how to spell it, and then I would\nlearn how to pronounce it. And the pronunciation of course\nwas very difficult once you are more or less an adult, it's\nvery very difficult to forget the uh, idioms of a_ language\nthat you were trained in, and translate them into a\ndifferent language. Uh, but you really don't want me _ to\ntalk about my time in-in-in America, so.\nSWB: Tell me, going back to Wels, I want to learn about the\nday-to-day life there. Was there a lot of standing in line,\nwas it organized, was it disorganized?\nHELEN FAGIN: I thought it was pretty well organized, uh,\nbut of course there was always standing in line for the\nfood, as was always standing in line for the showers. There\nwas um, always, well standing in line of course for\nregistration. But this was, this was a very very well",
        "organized uh-uh system. Uh because they wanted to have\neverything under a very very strict control. Uh, this was\nactually the first time that we registered. The first time\nthat we declared ourselves as-as any kind of a, of a living\nperson, to be dealt with. Uh, but um, it was very\ndepersonalized. Very cold, and very very uh, officious, I\nwould say. We didn't get the impression that anybody really\ncared for us as people, aS a person, aS a human being. But\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int.

We knew that\nuh, uh, that was the place, that iS was sort of a transit\nplace, and uh we were hoping we were not going to remain\nthere for a long time.\nSWB: The time that you were there, were there um many\nnationalities and also were there non-Jews?\nHELEN FAGIN: I don't remember whether there were any non\nJews, but I do remember many nationalities. Many\nCzechoslovakian, many Hungarian, many Rumanian Jews. Uh, I",
        "don't remember that there were very many north European\nJews, but I do remember central and east European Jews.\nSWB: Did you think there was a lack of understanding on the\npart of the administrators, or the MP's, because many of you\nwere from countries that they didn't understand why you\ncouldn't go back?\nHELEN FAGIN: Well, I really cannot remember the exact, uh\nconduct of the people, but I have the impression that is so\nlasting, aS a matter of fact I spoke with my younger sister\nabout it the other day. And I ask her what kind of\nimpressions she took out of there. And she confirmed with\nme that she felt the same way. So it's not a personal\naversion, it 1S something that was a general atmosphere, a\ngeneral feeling, that we weren't cared for as human beings,\nwe were just cared for as uh, as-as-as an entity\nto-to-to-to-to, to-to process more or 1l1ess, it was a\nprocessing feeling rather than caring feeling.\nSWB: And now going back to liberation itself, can you tell\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int.

        "me...\nHELEN FAGIN: Yes the process of uh-libera-liberation was uh\nvery interesting one in my case because I was sort of\nliberated twice.

In\nwestern Poland. And when we heard that the Russians were\nvery close we decided that maybe we can emerge and finally\nuh, act as ourselves and [plane noise BG] say well here we\nare and we can be liberated. Well the Russians did come and\nwe emerged and we were elated and they, at first could not\nbelieve that we were Jewish because they had encountered,\nprior to that, Jews coming out of hiding or coming out of\ncamps, and sure enough, we were euphoric.

So we decided not to show our-our elation, and to\ntake it with low profile, and that was a very lucky choice\nfor us, because sure enough, somehow or other, the Russian\nhad to re- Russians had to retreat, and the Germans came\nback. When the Germans came back we really were very\nfrightened. We thought that we are going to be renounced by\nthe population, who may have sensed our elation with the\nGermans. And uh we decided to go east to move east as far\neast as we could, but we really couldn't get very far\nbecause the front moved, kept moving from one kilometer one\nway to the one kilometer the other way. So we went\nunderground, and then we-we-we heard fighting, and we just",
        "didn't know what to do, so we hid in-in basements as much as\nwe could, until about few days later when we heard total\nSilence, when we didn't hear any shooting, when we uh sent\nsomebody out to uh find out whether it was safe to come out\nand when we came out indeed the Russians were there. And\nthey assured us that they were there for good, and that the\nGermans retreated for good, and then we really blew our\ncover, and we felt that we were free to be ourselves. And\nthen of course, the bittersweet feeling came upon us. We uh\nmade the decision to return to our hometown, to see whether\nwe can find anyone alive, and then we confronted the\nrubbles, the physical rubbles and the psychological rubbles\nof uh, of the aftermath of the war.\nSWB: And so order emerged out of the chaos very slowly.\nHELEN FAGIN: I wouldn't call it order. Chaos was\ncontinuing. People were wandering about, people were trying\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 Int.
