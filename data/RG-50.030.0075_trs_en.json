        "Q: Okay. Fritzie, we're going to begin our interview now by asking you to tell us your name.",
        "A: My name now, or my name while I was in Europe?",
        "Q: Well, let's start with your name now, and then\u2014",
        "A: Okay. My name now is Fritzie Fritshall, and my maiden name was Fritzie Weiss.",
        "Q: And where were you born, Fritzie?",
        "A: I was born in a small town called Czechoslovakia \u2014 a country called Czechoslovakia, in a\nsmall town called Klyucharki, which was near a city called Munkacs. They were like, I\ndon't know, maybe 20 kilometers from the \u201cbig city\u201d called Munkacs.",
        "Q: What can you tell us of life in the city, as far back as you can remember?",
        "A: I came from a small town. There were not many Jewish families in our town. We were\nmaybe a handful. I was a child, and I don't \u2014 I, I couldn't tell you how many. But it was a\nclose-knit Jewish community. Prior to the war, I personally didn't \u2014 I did not feel any\nantisemitism directed towards me or my family. As far as I remember, we lived in peace\nwith our neighbors. My friends were not Jewish as well as Jewish. In fact, my very best\nfriend was not Jewish. She was a young lady, a young girl my age, who used to sleep in\nour home. We would share a bed, many times, and \u2014 as I would sleep in her home. And I,\nI personally never felt any antisemitism directly towards me, or directly towards my\nfamily.",
        "Q: What kind of work did your father do?",
        "A: My dad came to this country just before the war broke out. Our families were farmers\nmostly. And I don't really recall. I think he was, he was an owner of a store \u2014 clothing\nstore, prior to coming to \u2014 his coming to this country. I don't really remember him. To tell\nyou the truth, when I came to this country, I came to my \u2014 I had very few memories of\nmy father. He was like \u2014 it was like coming to a stranger. You know? So I really don't\nknow.",
        "Q: And when your mother was looking after you, when you were growing up as a small\nchild, could you tell us whether she looked after you alone? Or were there others in the\nfamily?",
        "A: Well, we had \u2014 my grandmother lived in town. And, of course, I had uncles and my aunt.\nAnd we did have family. There were some cousins. We were very fond of our\ngrandmother, and I spent a lot of time there; and my mother also had her parents, who\nlived in another town. And so she had support from both families, both on her husband's\nside and on her, her own parents' side. But after my dad came to this country, he used to\nhelp us. When my dad came to this country, it was right after, I believe, the Depression.\nAnd he came to Chicago, and earned three dollars a week working for Vienna Sausage\nCompany in Chicago. And the story went that my dad would send us a dollar and a half\nto live on in Europe \u2014 which was a lot of money at that time in Europe. And, of course,\nhe lived on a dollar and a half here.\nAnd when my dad came here, immigration was very strict. In those days, a man had to\nshow that he could support a family before he was allowed to bring a family to this\ncountry. And I believe there's a long story behind this, but by the time my dad was able to\nsend us papers to immigrate to this country, the war had broken out. And my mother was\nafraid to take her family. I had two younger brothers; and my mother was afraid to take\nthree children on a ship that might have been bombed on the waters, that were beginning\nto be bombed already because the war had broken out. I, I believe this is the joke of, of\nthe century: her being afraid to take us on a boat that might be bombed, and then getting\ncaught in the war in Europe and concentration camps. You know? So....",
        "Q: As you speak of the war beginning, could you tell us what your first impressions were of\nthe beginning of the war?",
        "A: The first \u2014 okay. The first that I really knew that Jews were being persecuted in Europe\nwas as a child. I recall my mother taking us \u2014 meaning my brothers, my two brothers and\nherself \u2014 going to my grandfather's town where my grandparents lived, where my mother\nwas born and came from. And she took us there, often times, for visits. And, I believe, in\n1939 when the Germans took away citizenship from the Polish Jews that emigrated to\nGermany, became German citizens, established businesses in Germany and fought for the\nGerman government. These Jews were asked to leave Germany when Hitler came into\npower. He took away their businesses, as you well know; and he took \u2014 confiscated\neverything they had, and sent them back over the border to Poland. When these Jews\ncame to Poland, they had no place to go. They had no homes; and of course the Polish\ncommunity did not want these Jews back. So a lot of the Jews were being persecuted, and\na lot of them went into the mountain areas. My grandparents lived close to the Polish\nborder in Czechoslovakia; and, of course, in \u2014 near the mountains.\nI recall, as a child, these Jews coming down from the mountains looking for Jewish\nhomes; and begging for food, begging for warm clothing and so forth, to take back to\ntheir families in hiding. I recall, as a child, helping my grandfather; taking buckets,\npretending we were going to feed the animals, and going into the barns for whatever\nreason. And carrying food and warm clothing in these buckets to take back to these\npeople, so that they could take it back to their families. I recall hearing horror stories of\nJews being persecuted in Poland and in Germany. Of course, we didn't know about\nconcentration camps at that time. But we knew \u2014 I knew, as a child, that Jews were being\npersecuted. And I recall hiding many of these young Jewish people that would come; and\nputting them into wagons and covering them with straw and whatever, and taking them\ninto different parts of Czechoslovakia, to different towns. So that we could help these\nyoung Jews escape. We still had freedom at that time, and little did we know that we\nwere going to be next. That we were going to be persecuted. So I did know at that time\nthat Jews were being persecuted. But we still lived in peace with our neighbors. We, as I\nsaid, were not being persecuted at that time. Our life was peaceful. The businessmen did\nor went about their business as they pleased. And that was my first recollection. Then I\nrecall going back home to our hometown in Czecho\u2014 in Klyucharki. And I had a young\nuncle that must have been 17, 18 years old at the time; and as Czechoslovakia was being\noccupied, this uncle pretended he was going to take eggs and things off of the farm to go\ninto the big city of Munkacs. He would take these things and put them in a basket on his\nbicycle and pedal to the city; strictly to find out about what was happening in the city,\nwhat was happening around the world, so to speak. Because that was the only news we\ncould really get. We didn't have television and we didn't have radio, as they do today.\nAnd my uncle used to come back and bring us bits and pieces of news. We were not\nallowed to listen to this news, we as children. We were being protected. And we were\njust \u2014 we were getting bits and pieces of this. So I did know that in certain areas Jews,\nbecause they were Jews, they were being persecuted. But we ourselves were not touched\nby it at that point. Actually, I personally was not affected by this until Hitler marched into\nCzechoslovakia and took over the country.",
        "Q: Do you remember that?",
        "A: My first recollection was when I went to school. The night before going to school, my\nfriend who was not Jewish \u2014 she and I slept in our home. Slept in the same bed, played as\nchildren do. I remember my mother opening the door and telling us to go to sleep,\nbecause we were being noisy and the next day was school. She and I got up in the\nmorning to go to school, one morning. When we came to school, she was allowed to walk\nin and the door was closed to me.\nI was told I was not allowed to walk into class anymore. I needed to go home, because I\nwas Jewish. A teacher who was my teacher, who took out a white handkerchief from his\npocket the week before to wipe a smudge off of my face, turned to me one day and told\nme I must not come to school anymore. All of a sudden, for whatever reason, I needed to\ngo back home and not come back to school. I remember going home and crying, and not\nunderstanding why I was not allowed to go to school anymore. A few minutes later, my\ntwo brothers came home crying. They too were sent back home, and were told not to go\nto school anymore. Because we became quote \"Jewish\" overnight. My mother had to sit\ndown with us and tell us the facts of life. Tell us why we were not allowed to go to school\nanymore; tell us that the country was invaded by a man called Hitler who was a bad man.\nWe did not know about the killings at that time \u2014 at least, I didn't. But we were told that\nthere were certain rules we needed to follow from now on, and one was not to go to\npublic school. I recall the laws being set down one by one. Not being able to go to a\ngrocery store, except during certain hours. Not being able to work our farms anymore.\nNot being able to walk into a bakery anymore, except during certain hours. Not to go into\na park and sit on a bench, unless it said, \"For Jews Only.\" The wearing of the yellow star.\nAnd the hours we were allowed to be out, and the hours we were \u2014 has to be back in the\nhouse. And those were the first that I personally felt. And then, of course, the laws that\ncame down one by one. Everyday there was a new law, and everyday we had to obey the\nnew law. And we were not allowed to walk down the street anymore. If someone came\ntowards us that was not a Jew, the Jew needed to step off the sidewalk to allow the next\nperson \u2014 who of course was not Jewish \u2014 to walk by. I recall our neighbors turning their\nbacks on us. Spitting on us. Neighbors who lived in peace with us, who were our friends\nthe week before. And then, of course, we were lucky we were farmers; because we would\nhave starved to death.\nYou know, it's interesting. You, you sit and, and you talk, and as you sat and memories\ncame back. It took me many, many years to find out why my mother would put food on\nthe table for her three children at night, give us our dinner, and after she served us, she\nwould walk out of the room. She never stayed in the room where we ate. I could never\nunderstand this. Just recently \u2014 shows you how smart I am \u2014 I've just recently figured this\nout. I probably had forgotten all of this. The reason she didn't stay with us was because\nthere wasn't enough food to go around. So those are my early memories of Hitler walking\ninto Czechoslovakia. And, of course, then there was the knock on the door in the middle\nof the night. We were told to gather our belongings, take warm clothes, take our\nvaluables, and to take our pots and pans. We were told we were going to be relocated.\nAnd as we know today, they lied. And we believed. I'm not sure if our parents knew what\nwas going to happen or not. But we believed. I think we needed to believe. And, of\ncourse, as we know how brave Hitler was \u2014 the knock came in the middle of the night. It\nwas the last days of Passover when they came to get us, and they told us to take whatever\nfood we could. We didn't have bread in the house yet. We still had matzo. I remember my\nmother packing matzo to take with us to the ghetto. It seems like yesterday.",
        "Q: You mentioned to the ghetto. Was the ghetto in the town or did they transport you?",
        "A: In our case a ghetto was in a small \u2014 in our small town. The Germans took over the\ngrammar school, a small school. They emptied the school. They put a fence around the\nschool. They brought soldiers. They brought dogs. For some reason, always dogs. And\nthe guards, of course. And they put us into this school \u2014 which became our ghetto. All the\nJewish family from the \u2014 families from this community were put into this school. We\nslept on the floor. We had our bedding, because we brought it with us. We were not\nabused while we were in this so-called ghetto. Food was brought to us every day. We\ndidn't have an over-abundance of food, but we were not starving. Of course, our\nneighbors did not come to see us, nor did they come to ask if we needed any food or any\nhelp. I will never understand that part. I will never understand how one human being \u2014 a\nneighbor, a friend \u2014 can turn against you. A person that has lived with you in peace, that\nhas watched you born, that has gone to school with you, knows your family and knows\nyour life history, can turn against you as a human being. But nevertheless, that's what\nthey did. The Germans would come \u2014 the soldiers would come every day to the ghetto.\nThey would take our young people on a work crew \u2014 I was too young, but they would\ntake most of the young people \u2014 and they would take them to do forced labor. Whatever\nthey did, I don't know. There were different jobs for all the young men, as well as\nwomen. They would tell us that they would bring them back at night; and in most cases,\nmost of them did come back at night. The ones that didn't, we were told that they were\nsent to a different area but we would see them in some future time. Of course, we never\ndid. And this is how we lived for several weeks. We \u2014 the families stayed together; and\nwe could have lived that way, very well. We would not have had all of the comforts of\nhome. But if they would have let us, we could have survived in that type of an\natmosphere. Until the trucks came to empty out the ghetto; and, of course, to take us to\nthe famous trains. When they came to empty the ghettos, again they told us we were\ngoing to be relocated. I had two younger brothers, of which one was nine and one was\nseven. When they came to take us on to the trucks, as we were walking on to towards the\ntrucks, my youngest brother turned back and ran back into the school. He would not\ncome out. He hid underneath a table. They carried him out, bodily, and threw him on to\nthis truck as he was kicking and crying, as if he knew where he was going to go.",
        "Q: Your mother, you, your brothers...",
        "A: .. my grandparents, my aunt, my relatives, and all the other Jews in the community \u2014 we\nwere all loaded onto this train, going to Auschwitz. When we were put onto this train,\nwhich, of course, I don't need to describe to you. It was a cattle car, as you know. No\nwindows and no seats. No toilet. When we got onto the trains, none of us knew we were\nbeing taken to a concentration camp. None of us knew anything about Auschwitz. At\nleast, I don't think we knew. We honestly thought we were going to be relocated. Until\nthe door closed, and we heard the lock go on from the outside. I believe, that was the first\nwe knew wherever we were going to be taken to, it was not going to be freedom, and it\nwas not going to be a great relocation. We were not told where we were being taken to,\nnor did we know what direction we were going in. I recall there was a small window on\ntop of this compartment, the train we were on. They would lift a child up that could read.\nA man would lift the child up as the train would pass a station, so that the child could\nread what direction the train was going in, what stations we passed. And that would give\nus a clue where we were going to. This is how we knew where \u2014 towards what\ndestination we were being taken to. The train would stop once, sometimes twice, a day\nand wait for other Jews to be brought to be put back \u2014 to be put on to this train. Until the\ncompartment was so full that there was standing room only. It got to the point where if\none needed to sit down, someone else needed to stand up; because there truly was\nabsolutely \u2014 it was a packed train. When the train would stop sometimes once a day, they\nwould push in a bucket for our personal use, for toilet. They would push in a bucket of\nwater; and they would take one of the men off the train to go and get water. And usually\nit was a matter of choosing who would go to get this bucket of water, because we weren't\nsure if the person would come back or not. And usually it was a young man that would\nvolunteer. And that bucket of water needed to go around for every single person. And\noften times it didn't make to the very end. Many people would not get any water on that\ngiven day. How do I tell you about a train ride like that? About the dignity that is taken\naway from you when you need to use a bucket as toilet in the middle of a compartment\non a train, in front of everyone? About sharing water with every single person? About the\nmothers holding on to hungry children. The crying. The stink. The fear. It's strange, fear\ngives out a certain smell and that mixed with open bucket \u2014 it's a smell I don't believe one\ncan ever forget. It's, it's not to be described.",
        "Q: How long were you in that train?",
        "A: I believe, two and a half days. I believe we were there two and a half days in all, with the\nstopping and going. I can't tell you exactly. I believe if I live to be 100, that smell will\nstay with me. And I will always hear the crying of the babies; and in particular, the young\nmother trying to feed an infant, breast feed an infant, and not having any milk to feed this\ninfant. These revisionists that don't believe, I would like to take them all and put them\ninto a compartment like that and show them what it feels like.",
        "Q: When the train finally stopped\u2014 ?",
        "A: When the train stopped in Auschwitz, of course, we didn't know where we were. The\ntrain arrived in the middle of the night, so we were greeted by very bright lights shining\ndown on us. We were greeted by soldiers, SS\u2019 \u2014 men as well as women. We were greeted\nby dogs and whips, by shouting and screaming orders to try to empty the train, by\n' Schutzstaffeln [Protection Squads] (German)\nconfusion, and by men in striped uniform. We didn't know it at the time, but the men in\nuniform were the Jews who were brought there before us. They were called \"Kanada\u2019,\"\nwhich I found out later. Their job was to empty the train. One of those men saved my life.\nThat was the first. When they had asked us to empty the trains, these men would come\nonto the compartment of the train; and they would try and push and pull us off the train\nas fast as they could. These men were not allowed to speak to us; but, in their own way,\nthey tried to help young people. They walked amongst us, and in Yiddish would whisper\nto a child, \"You're 15. Remember you're 15.\" When we got off the train and they asked us\nto line up according to age, I lined up with \u2014 I became 15 years old, lined up with the 15\nyears old. And I truly believe that man, whoever he was, saved my life. Time out.\n[Pause in interview |",
        "Q: Anytime you want to continue.... You've brought us to the point where a man gave you\nadvice, and you followed his advice. Can you remember what was going on around you,\nin terms of your mother, and your brothers, and others who came with you?",
        "A: When they asked us to line up, of course, ,,. When we, when we got off the train, the men\nneeded to go to one side, the young boys \u2014 I believe it was to the left. It's like a picture.\nThe babies were taken away and put onto trucks. Today that I am a mother and a\ngrandmother, I can understand this more than I did at the time. The young children and\nthe babies that were taken out of mothers' arms and put on to these trucks; and the\nmothers running after them. And the crying and the screaming, \"My baby!\" And they\nwere told they would see them later. Of course, as we know today, they never did. The\nold people, the cripples whoever couldn't walk, these were put on trucks. The young\npeople needed to line up. Women and men were separated, as were children. My mother\nand I stood on the same line when they told us to line up, and then they started to call\nage. Mother was a young woman. They called, \"Age!\" And I told my mother she stood in\nthe wrong line. My mother went into another line. I found out several hours later that the\nline she went in went directly to the gas chambers. I'm sorry.",
        "Q: It's okay. Take your time.",
        "A: I thought this was going to be an easy interview.",
        "Q: They're never easy. But after you realized that the lines were separated, and you were in\nyour line\u2014",
        "A: I have to back-track a little bit, if I may.\n* Canada (German); term for the warehouse of looted goods at Auschwitz; also used to refer to\nprisoners who where assigned to work in the warehouse facilities.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: When I came to this country \u2014 I don't know if you want this on the tape or not \u2014 when I\ncame to this country, I came here as a teenager. I had decided that I was going to live as a\nnormal teenager. I could not live with my memories of what had happened. I couldn't\nhandle them. So I had taken all of my memories and put them in a little box, and put them\non the very bottom of my brain. Closed the box never to be taken out, never to be\nexamined. This is how I lived for many years. This is how I handled my past. This is not\nsaying it's right or wrong, but it's saying the way I could cope with it. Except for one\ntime, after I came to this country. My father cornered me and asked me about what had\nhappened: am I sure my mother is dead, and am I sure my brothers are dead? We did not\ndiscuss the Holocaust in our home. It was taboo. I would not associate with any\nsurvivors. I would not join any organizations. I got married. My husband knew I was a\nsurvivor. We raised a child who knew his mother was a survivor, would come home from\nschool when he would learn about the Holocaust \u2014 as little as was taught at that time,\nbecause we're going back 30 some years \u2014 and would ask questions. I could not answer\nthe questions. I would give a one syllable \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. And after a while, a child\nrealizes that these are things we don't talk about. And so he stopped asking. This is how I\nlived for many years. This was my way. Until about five, five and a half years ago, my\nson called one night, and he said, \"Mom, I just read an article in the newspaper put in by\nthe Holocaust Foundation of Illinois, asking for survivors to come forth and have their\nstories recorded.\" He says, \"Mom, you need to do this. You need to do this, because I\nneed to know. It's time.\" And he called me once, and he called me twice; and I kept\nsaying, \"Yes, I'll do it.\" I had seen the article several times, but I ignored it because I\ncould not handle it. And one day he called me and he said, \"If you don't call, I will call\nthe Foundation. Mom, please go. Don't ask for anything. Sign whatever they tell you to\nsign. But ask for a tape. Ask for a tape so that we \u2014 your grandson, now, and I \u2014 will\nknow what happened.\" And so I did. And this is when the memories started to fall back\ninto place. This is when I went back into camp, and started to relive all of this. The\nreason I'm telling you this is because many things are blocked out in my mind. One of the\nthings is, crossing the threshold from the train station into the camp itself. Whether it's\nreally blocked out or not, I don't know. But probably, psychologically, it's there; but it\nneeds to come out. I remember the gate. I can see the gate in front of me: \"Arbeit Macht\nFrei\u2019.\" I see the separation. I see the lines. I see the trucks moving. But I do not recall\ngoing into the camp. The first memory of camp is sitting in a chair and having my hair\nshaved.\nAnd I recall the hair falling in my face, mingling with my tears. And then a uniform\nbeing thrown at me and a pair of clogs. Pushed outside. I recall walking outside, and\n* Work Makes [You] Free (German)\nseeing all of these hundreds and hundreds of other women with their heads shaved. Some\nholding on to their uniforms, and some wearing their uniforms already. And here was\nFritzie \u2014 this pampered child \u2014 thrown into a snake pit, so to speak. A lady walked up to\nme, and kept staring at me. The lady turned out to be my mother's youngest sister, whose\nhair was shaved already and who was in uniform. It was due to that lady that I survived\nAuschwitz concentration camp. But that was really my first memory of walking into\nAuschwitz. This lady held my hand all the way through the months of Auschwitz. I'm not\nsure any survivor can describe Auschwitz to you. I know you said you are going back\nthere; but unless you've lived under those conditions for one day, you will never know.\nHow does one describe the walking into Auschwitz, the, the smell? And someone\npointing out to you that those are gas chambers, that your parents went up in smoke?\nWhen I asked, \"When will I see my mother?\" several hours later after I came into the\ncamp, I was shown the smoke. This is how I found out where she went. How do I\ndescribe fear? How do I describe hunger to someone that has probably had breakfast and\nlunch today? Or even if you're dieting, or even if you're fasting for a day? I think hunger\nis when the pit of your stomach hurts. When you would sell your soul for a potato or a\nslice of bread. I believe that once one has experienced hunger, they will never ever forget\nit. How do I describe living with lice in your clothes, on your body? The stink. The fear.\nThe selections. The Appells\u2019. The being told when to go to a toilet, not when you needed\nto use it. The using of the morning coffee to wash your face with. The knowing that Dr.\nMengele\u201d will be there for his selections every single day. And mostly, mostly death in\nthe gas chambers, the smoke. There 1s no way to describe your first coming to\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: As you struggle to remember and help us to know, can you share with us some of your\nimpressions of what you saw and how you reacted to it?",
        "A: I think the, the reaction is \u2014 I think the first thought is, to survive. Your concern for your\nfamily. Your wondering what happened to them. The people around you. The seeing of\ndeath day in and day out. Not knowing when your turn was going to come. But I think\nthe struggle to survive, in all of us. And, and none of us really know the kind of energy\nwe put in every day to survive, unless we're faced with this. And I know many people\nthought of dying, and many people thought of committing suicide. My thought was\nalways of tomorrow. And I believe that's what \u2014 maybe youth \u2014 but my, my hope was\nalways of tomorrow. The struggles to survive.",
        "Q: You mentioned the word \"selection.\" Could you tell us a little about that process?",
        "A: Selection. We needed to get undressed every day. And we needed to run \u2014 not walk \u2014 in\n* roll call (German)\n> Dr. Josef Mengele\nfront of Dr. Mengele, or his entourage, which was SS soldiers. We needed to show that\nwe still had strength left to \u2014 whether it was to work or to live another day. I recall some\nwomen were beginning \u2014 as the hair grows back, they were beginning to get gray hair.\nAnd they would go and take a little piece of coal from one of the pot-bellied stoves that\nwas in a barrack. And they would use this coal to color their hair with, so that they would\nlook a little younger. I mean, one grayed at the age of maybe 18 or 19 under those\nconditions. And they would run \u2014 we would run in front of whoever it was that was doing\nthe selections, to show that we could survive one other day. If one had a scar, a pimple, if\none didn't run fast enough, if one didn't look right for whatever reason to the particular\nperson that was doing the selection. They would stand there with a stick \u2014 to the right or\nto the left \u2014 as you ran by them. One never knew if they were in the good line or the bad\nline. One line would go to the gas chambers. The other line would go back to the camp\nand to the barracks, to live another day. This is how the selection was done. I believe\nthere were so many people that needed to be gassed every day. And we knew the trains\nwere coming in; and we watched the people marching. And we knew many of the\nbarracks were being emptied out, day in and day out, to make room for the new people\nthat were coming in. We never knew when our turn would come next. So one always\nlived in fear, and one always tried to get through these selections for one more day. And,\nof course, the Appell. They would wake us up at the crack of dawn and empty out the\nentire barracks. And we would need to line up in fives to be counted, twice a day \u2014 the\nfirst thing in the morning and the last thing at night. To make sure no one had escaped, no\none was missing. Sometimes we would stand there for hours and hours. Just stand to be\ncounted, until every single person in the particular camp was accounted for.\nYou must remember, there were thousands and thousands of people in each camp.\nWhether it rained or the sun was out, if it was hot or if it was cold. We had very little\nclothing. And, of course, 1n the summer we had to wear whatever we had. So if the sun\nwould beat down on you, many people would faint during these \"Appell\" counts. Nobody\never wanted to be at the beginning of the line, and nobody ever wanted to be at the front\nof the line; because for whatever punishment was being dished out, they would pull\npeople from the beginning or the end of the line to punish these people. To show us what\nwould happen to us if we did not obey orders in every day living. And, of course, the\ndead people that that would die during the night from starvation or disease, or from\nkilling, from beatings, they too would need to be carried out from the barracks every\nsingle morning, and lined up in front of the barracks. They, too needed, to be counted.\nEvery single body needed to be accounted for. Day in, and day out. We would not get\nany food until every single person was accounted for. And then we were allowed to\nmarch and get our breakfast, which often times just consisted of a cup of coffee. Often\ntimes they would give us a little soup and a small slice of bread. And most of the time, of\ncourse, we didn't have any water. So we would use that hot coffee to wash our faces and\nour hands with. So we wouldn't even get the hot coffee in the morning. This was our\nexistence while we were in Auschwitz. My job in Auschwitz was \u2014 they would line us up\nevery morning and they would take us outside; and we would carry huge rocks from one\nside to another. One day we would come, and we would take these huge rocks from this\nside and we would carry them to that side. The next day, they would bring us back; and\nwe would take these same huge rocks, and we would carry them from that side back to\nthis side. Now you need to know, we were undernourished. We were all weak. And to\ncarry a big rock like that was a lot of weight and a lot of work. By the time they take us\nback to the barracks at night, we could barely crawl. But we needed to show that we\ncould still walk, and we were strong enough to give one more day.",
        "Q: How long did that go on?",
        "A: That went on for several months. It went on for close to nine months. Until one day they\ncame and they were emptying out our barrack. And we knew exactly where we were\ngoing to go. They lined us up, and they were marching us towards the gas chambers. It\nwas our turn. My aunt and I, and the rest of the women, marched towards the gas\nchambers. And they had a selection. My aunt was chosen to go onto a truck to be taken\nsomewheres else. And I was chosen to stay, to march into the gas chambers. The last my\naunt saw of me, was walking towards the gas chambers as she crawled down from the\ntruck and begged could I come onto the truck with her. And they were laughing and said\nno, but she could come down and join me, as the trucks were pulling away. As we started\nto walk towards the gas chambers and we were walking in, I was at the end of the line \u2014\nagain, because of my aunt. Six of us were pulled out of line; and I was literally in the\ndoor of the gas chamber. I will never know the reason why. Six of us were pulled out and\nput onto another truck, with several other women, to go to work in a factory. Forced\nlabor. When they brought us to the factory, I was the youngest of 600 women.\nOur job was \u2014 we were doing parts. Each one of us had a different job to do, and this was\n\u2014 they were doing parts for airplanes. My particular job was to put the spring into the\ncompass that would go onto an airplane. Because I was the youngest, 599 women shared\ntheir precious food with me. Allowed me a little extra food every day. If anyone could\nrest, I was the one that would rest. I was their hope to survive. I was their hope to carry\nthe message to the world. To tell the world what happened. It took me 40 some years to\nremember a promise I made to 599 women. But I remember today. And I remember\nevery time I stand up to speak, it was due to them that I made the last days of camp.",
        "Q: Of the 600 women including yourself, do you recall how many were able to come out\nwith you?",
        "A: No. I don't know what happened to any of them. As Germany started to lose the war, they\nstarted to gather us, of course, and the famous death march. And we, too \u2014 all of us were\n\u2014 joined a group, the group from other concentration camps and factories. And started the\ndeath march. I don't know if you're familiar with the death march, but it was \u2014 I don't\nknow how to describe it. All of us were weak already, but we knew \u2014 we did not know\nwhere we were going to go, but we knew that it was the last days of the war. We knew\nbecause of the bombings; and we knew because of the way the German soldiers were\npushing us and pulling us already, and emptying the camps and whatever. They took us\nall and put us together, all of the people from camps. And they had us march through\ntowns and through fields. They didn't know where to put us anymore, and they didn't\nknow what to do with us. And there was no food, because the Germans were losing the\nwar. Often times, as they marched us through a town, a window would open and a shutter\nwould open, and either a potato or a loaf of bread would come flying out; and the shutter\nwould close after. And we would all pounce on this potato or this \u2014 whatever this piece of\nfood was that came at us. And, of course, they would shoot at us; but we didn't care at\nthat point, because we were hungry. The streets were literally covered with bodies. As we\nmarched, we would pass bodies. Body after body after body. People that were dropping\ndead from hunger, from disease, from dysentery; because they did not have the strength,\nor because they gave up. So we knew it was towards the very end. We would sleep in the\nfields. We lived on whatever we could find. If we could find a carrot, a potato, snails,\nsnails! In order to survive. The planes would come down low, and shoot at us often times.\nTowards the very last, a friend \u2014 a girl whose name I do not recall \u2014 and I ran into the\nforest. I believe they saw us run. I believe the Germans saw us run; because they could\nhave shot us at that that point. But they didn't. We ran into the forest and spent the first\nnight in the forest sleeping. And we spent all the next day there, because we were afraid\nto go out. And when it started to get dark, she and I found a town to walk to.\nAnd we came to a farmer. And, of course, they had to know who we were. Our heads\nwere shaved and we wore striped clothing. And we begged for food; and they did give us\nfood, and told us to go into the barn. Because they had to go and give us \u2014 get us stamps,\nbecause they didn't have enough food. And we went into the barn; and when the man left,\nwe ran out of the barn and ran away, because we were afraid they would turn us in. And\nwe lived in the forests until the Russians liberated us. You know, as we read books today\nand we watch films, and of course, we know the Germans \u201cdid not know what was going\non.\u201d So they tell us. Not true. They all knew what was going on. They marched us\nthrough the towns to the forced labor, with our heads shaved and wearing striped\nuniforms. Often times, a window would open and they would throw food at us. The\nworkers that worked in the factories with us. They tell us, \u201cHitler did this.\u201d Did Hitler\nreally do this by himself? Are we forgetting the machinery Hitler had working for him?\nAre we forgetting the soldiers that gathered us? The people that took care of the ghettos?\nThe people that drove the trains to Treblinka and other places? The men and women who\nwere the guards in Auschwitz concentration camp? Our neighbors that turned us in? Are\nwe forgetting all of that? Hitler didn't do it by himself. Hitler had lots of help. What about\nthese men that were the guards in the camps, that would go home at night to play with\ntheir children and listen to their music and hug their wives while they were killing our\nparents and our sisters and brothers? Did they keep a secret? Can they keep a secret?\nHow many people can keep a secret? We were told they didn't know. What about all the\npeople that lived in the towns around Auschwitz and other concentration camps, that saw\nthe flames day in and day out? That smelled the stink of the bodies burning, day in and\nday out? What about all the people that saw the trains passing by, and the people begging\nfor water, for food to give to their babies? Why are we forgetting all of that? Why are we\nsaying, \u201cHitler did this?\u201d Yes, Hitler was instrumental in doing this. What about all of\nthose people? What about all of those people that were my age, at that time; and were\ntaught to hate me because I was Jewish, and to hate other Jews? They are my age today.\nDo they love me? I'm the same person, but so are they. Do they love me today? Have\nthey overcome their hatred? Do they forget that, yes, we are Jews, but we're also human\nbeings? Do they forget that we all breath the same? End of speech.",
        "Q: Well, Fritzie, we certainly will not forget. Before we finish the interview, could you share\nwith us a few moments of how you were in fact aware of your freedom, when it came?",
        "A: I think \u2014 well, as I said, I was liberated by the Russians. I think the first thought is to fill\nyour stomach and to have a warm bath. We're all human.",
        "Q: Let's go back to the point of being liberated by the Russians. How did that actually\nhappen?",
        "A: When we heard that Russia had occupied the particular town we were liberated in, we\nwent to them and presented ourselves as prisoners, as they could see, because we were\nskin and bones, and of course our hair had not grown back in the few days, and we were\nstill in uniform. We joined other survivors. They took us to an area where they had other\nsurvivors that they had liberated. And then the Russians took us into a town, where they\ntook over an apartment building; and they put us all into this building and literally made\nit like a ghetto type of a surrounding. Although they did give us all the medical attention\nwe needed, and they did give us food and they gave us a bath and they gave clothing.\nThey had to put guards around us, because they were afraid we were carriers of disease at\nthat point, as probably we were. Most of us were sick. And they \u2014 as I said they put\nguards there; and they put they put wires on the windows. But they did \u2014 we were given\nfreedom at that point. And I think the, the windows and so forth were being protected \u2014\nwe, we were given the protection from their soldiers at that point, more than anything.\nBecause we were women; and, of course, you know, the protection we needed. After that,\nafter we had medical attention and all, they had asked us where we wanted to go. And I\nchose to go back home to my hometown, hoping that someone from my family had\nsurvived and would come back home.\nI was one of the first to come back home. And when we came \u2014 when I came back to our\ntown, our home was destroyed. Soldiers had used it as a lookout post. It was kind of on a\nhill, and they could see different directions from it. So it was totally destroyed. My\ngrandmother's home still stood. There were no windows, but the home was intact. And I\nmoved into that home. And we had a train that would pass by our village once a day. And\nI would go to meet that train every day, to see if someone else had survived. And little by\nlittle, some of our young people started to trickle back, one by one. And my\ngrandmother's home became the gathering place for all of us. We all moved in. We had\nwhat you call communal living; except that we did it out of necessity, 'cause we had\nnothing else. And we all migrated to this one home, and lived off of potatoes and carrots\nor whatever we could get off the fields. Our neighbors did not come to offer us anything.\nOur neighbors \u2014 who used our furniture, who used my aunt's clothes and my mother's\nclothes, that we recognized \u2014 not once came to ask if we needed any food or warm\nclothing. I like to think that it was done out of shame, maybe out of guilt. I don't know. I\nlike to think that this is why they never came forth. And we all lived that way until we all\nwent in our different directions.",
        "Q: How long were you there? In which direction did you go?",
        "A: When I came back to our hometown in Czechoslovakia, my dad was in this country, in\nAmerica. Neighbors \u2014 the post office had mail from my father, who was trying to locate\nhis family. Not knowing what had happened to his family, tried to locate us in any way\nhe could, any of us that had survived. And the post office had some letters that I had\ngotten from my father. And so I knew where he was. I knew he was in America, but did\nnot remember his address. And I was able to get in touch with my father, and he was able\nto send me some money in letters. And an American dollar at that time was a lot of\nmoney. And so I survived on that. And after we lived there for a while, I found that I had\nan uncle that had survived. My mother's youngest brother, who lived in another town. He\ncame to find me, and then the Germans closed the borders between East and West, and\nwe were caught on the Communist side of Czechoslovakia, of course. And my uncle had\nleft. He went to the Sudetenlands. And I was \u2014 my aunt, my one aunt that I survived and I\nwere caught under communism. And my uncle paid a man to smuggle my aunt and to\nsmuggle me over the border in the middle of the night. That's a book I need to write one\nday about that part of it. To smuggle us to the Sudetenlands. And we lived with my uncle\nuntil my father was able to send us papers, and I was able to come to this country. I came\nhere in 1947. I was still of age where I did not need to wait for a quota number, so I was\nable to \u2014 it was a little easier for me to come to this country. And life is as it is today. Life\ngoes on.",

        "A: I came from a small town. There were not many Jewish families in our town. We were\nmaybe a handful. I was a child, and I don't \u2014 I, I couldn't tell you how many. But it was a\nclose-knit Jewish community. Prior to the war, I personally didn't \u2014 I did not feel any\nantisemitism directed towards me or my family. As far as I remember, we lived in peace\nwith our neighbors. My friends were not Jewish as well as Jewish. In fact, my very best\nfriend was not Jewish. She was a young lady, a young girl my age, who used to sleep in\nour home. We would share a bed, many times, and \u2014 as I would sleep in her home.

To tell\nyou the truth, when I came to this country, I came to my \u2014 I had very few memories of\nmy father. He was like \u2014 it was like coming to a stranger. You know? So I really don't\nknow.",
        "A: Well, we had \u2014 my grandmother lived in town. And, of course, I had uncles and my aunt.\nAnd we did have family. There were some cousins. We were very fond of our\ngrandmother, and I spent a lot of time there; and my mother also had her parents, who\nlived in another town. And so she had support from both families, both on her husband's\nside and on her, her own parents' side. But after my dad came to this country, he used to\nhelp us. When my dad came to this country, it was right after, I believe, the Depression.\nAnd he came to Chicago, and earned three dollars a week working for Vienna Sausage\nCompany in Chicago. And the story went that my dad would send us a dollar and a half\nto live on in Europe \u2014 which was a lot of money at that time in Europe. And, of course,\nhe lived on a dollar and a half here.\nAnd when my dad came here, immigration was very strict. In those days, a man had to\nshow that he could support a family before he was allowed to bring a family to this\ncountry. And I believe there's a long story behind this, but by the time my dad was able to\nsend us papers to immigrate to this country, the war had broken out. And my mother was\nafraid to take her family. I had two younger brothers; and my mother was afraid to take\nthree children on a ship that might have been bombed on the waters, that were beginning\nto be bombed already because the war had broken out. I, I believe this is the joke of, of\nthe century: her being afraid to take us on a boat that might be bombed, and then getting\ncaught in the war in Europe and concentration camps. You know? So....",
        "A: The first \u2014 okay. The first that I really knew that Jews were being persecuted in Europe\nwas as a child. I recall my mother taking us \u2014 meaning my brothers, my two brothers and\nherself \u2014 going to my grandfather's town where my grandparents lived, where my mother\nwas born and came from. And she took us there, often times, for visits. And, I believe, in\n1939 when the Germans took away citizenship from the Polish Jews that emigrated to\nGermany, became German citizens, established businesses in Germany and fought for the\nGerman government. These Jews were asked to leave Germany when Hitler came into\npower. He took away their businesses, as you well know; and he took \u2014 confiscated\neverything they had, and sent them back over the border to Poland. When these Jews\ncame to Poland, they had no place to go. They had no homes; and of course the Polish\ncommunity did not want these Jews back. So a lot of the Jews were being persecuted, and\na lot of them went into the mountain areas. My grandparents lived close to the Polish\nborder in Czechoslovakia; and, of course, in \u2014 near the mountains.\nI recall, as a child, these Jews coming down from the mountains looking for Jewish\nhomes; and begging for food, begging for warm clothing and so forth, to take back to\ntheir families in hiding. I recall, as a child, helping my grandfather; taking buckets,\npretending we were going to feed the animals, and going into the barns for whatever\nreason. And carrying food and warm clothing in these buckets to take back to these\npeople, so that they could take it back to their families. I recall hearing horror stories of\nJews being persecuted in Poland and in Germany. Of course, we didn't know about\nconcentration camps at that time. But we knew \u2014 I knew, as a child, that Jews were being\npersecuted. And I recall hiding many of these young Jewish people that would come; and\nputting them into wagons and covering them with straw and whatever, and taking them\ninto different parts of Czechoslovakia, to different towns. So that we could help these\nyoung Jews escape. We still had freedom at that time, and little did we know that we\nwere going to be next. That we were going to be persecuted. So I did know at that time\nthat Jews were being persecuted. But we still lived in peace with our neighbors. We, as I\nsaid, were not being persecuted at that time. Our life was peaceful. The businessmen did\nor went about their business as they pleased. And that was my first recollection. Then I\nrecall going back home to our hometown in Czecho\u2014 in Klyucharki. And I had a young\nuncle that must have been 17, 18 years old at the time; and as Czechoslovakia was being\noccupied, this uncle pretended he was going to take eggs and things off of the farm to go\ninto the big city of Munkacs. He would take these things and put them in a basket on his\nbicycle and pedal to the city; strictly to find out about what was happening in the city,\nwhat was happening around the world, so to speak. Because that was the only news we\ncould really get. We didn't have television and we didn't have radio, as they do today.\nAnd my uncle used to come back and bring us bits and pieces of news. We were not\nallowed to listen to this news, we as children. We were being protected. And we were\njust \u2014 we were getting bits and pieces of this. So I did know that in certain areas Jews,\nbecause they were Jews, they were being persecuted. But we ourselves were not touched\nby it at that point. Actually, I personally was not affected by this until Hitler marched into\nCzechoslovakia and took over the country.",
        "A: My first recollection was when I went to school. The night before going to school, my\nfriend who was not Jewish \u2014 she and I slept in our home. Slept in the same bed, played as\nchildren do. I remember my mother opening the door and telling us to go to sleep,\nbecause we were being noisy and the next day was school. She and I got up in the\nmorning to go to school, one morning. When we came to school, she was allowed to walk\nin and the door was closed to me.\nI was told I was not allowed to walk into class anymore. I needed to go home, because I\nwas Jewish. A teacher who was my teacher, who took out a white handkerchief from his\npocket the week before to wipe a smudge off of my face, turned to me one day and told\nme I must not come to school anymore. All of a sudden, for whatever reason, I needed to\ngo back home and not come back to school. I remember going home and crying, and not\nunderstanding why I was not allowed to go to school anymore. A few minutes later, my\ntwo brothers came home crying. They too were sent back home, and were told not to go\nto school anymore. Because we became quote \"Jewish\" overnight. My mother had to sit\ndown with us and tell us the facts of life. Tell us why we were not allowed to go to school\nanymore; tell us that the country was invaded by a man called Hitler who was a bad man.\nWe did not know about the killings at that time \u2014 at least, I didn't. But we were told that\nthere were certain rules we needed to follow from now on, and one was not to go to\npublic school. I recall the laws being set down one by one. Not being able to go to a\ngrocery store, except during certain hours. Not being able to work our farms anymore.\nNot being able to walk into a bakery anymore, except during certain hours. Not to go into\na park and sit on a bench, unless it said, \"For Jews Only.\" The wearing of the yellow star.\nAnd the hours we were allowed to be out, and the hours we were \u2014 has to be back in the\nhouse. And those were the first that I personally felt. And then, of course, the laws that\ncame down one by one. Everyday there was a new law, and everyday we had to obey the\nnew law. And we were not allowed to walk down the street anymore. If someone came\ntowards us that was not a Jew, the Jew needed to step off the sidewalk to allow the next\nperson \u2014 who of course was not Jewish \u2014 to walk by. I recall our neighbors turning their\nbacks on us. Spitting on us. Neighbors who lived in peace with us, who were our friends\nthe week before. And then, of course, we were lucky we were farmers; because we would\nhave starved to death.\nYou know, it's interesting. You, you sit and, and you talk, and as you sat and memories\ncame back. It took me many, many years to find out why my mother would put food on\nthe table for her three children at night, give us our dinner, and after she served us, she\nwould walk out of the room. She never stayed in the room where we ate. I could never\nunderstand this. Just recently \u2014 shows you how smart I am \u2014 I've just recently figured this\nout. I probably had forgotten all of this. The reason she didn't stay with us was because\nthere wasn't enough food to go around. So those are my early memories of Hitler walking\ninto Czechoslovakia. And, of course, then there was the knock on the door in the middle\nof the night. We were told to gather our belongings, take warm clothes, take our\nvaluables, and to take our pots and pans. We were told we were going to be relocated.\nAnd as we know today, they lied. And we believed. I'm not sure if our parents knew what\nwas going to happen or not. But we believed. I think we needed to believe. And, of\ncourse, as we know how brave Hitler was \u2014 the knock came in the middle of the night. It\nwas the last days of Passover when they came to get us, and they told us to take whatever\nfood we could. We didn't have bread in the house yet. We still had matzo. I remember my\nmother packing matzo to take with us to the ghetto. It seems like yesterday.",
        "A: In our case a ghetto was in a small \u2014 in our small town. The Germans took over the\ngrammar school, a small school. They emptied the school. They put a fence around the\nschool. They brought soldiers. They brought dogs. For some reason, always dogs. And\nthe guards, of course. And they put us into this school \u2014 which became our ghetto. All the\nJewish family from the \u2014 families from this community were put into this school. We\nslept on the floor. We had our bedding, because we brought it with us. We were not\nabused while we were in this so-called ghetto. Food was brought to us every day. We\ndidn't have an over-abundance of food, but we were not starving. Of course, our\nneighbors did not come to see us, nor did they come to ask if we needed any food or any\nhelp. I will never understand that part. I will never understand how one human being \u2014 a\nneighbor, a friend \u2014 can turn against you. A person that has lived with you in peace, that\nhas watched you born, that has gone to school with you, knows your family and knows\nyour life history, can turn against you as a human being. But nevertheless, that's what\nthey did. The Germans would come \u2014 the soldiers would come every day to the ghetto.\nThey would take our young people on a work crew \u2014 I was too young, but they would\ntake most of the young people \u2014 and they would take them to do forced labor. Whatever\nthey did, I don't know. There were different jobs for all the young men, as well as\nwomen. They would tell us that they would bring them back at night; and in most cases,\nmost of them did come back at night. The ones that didn't, we were told that they were\nsent to a different area but we would see them in some future time. Of course, we never\ndid. And this is how we lived for several weeks. We \u2014 the families stayed together; and\nwe could have lived that way, very well. We would not have had all of the comforts of\nhome. But if they would have let us, we could have survived in that type of an\natmosphere. Until the trucks came to empty out the ghetto; and, of course, to take us to\nthe famous trains. When they came to empty the ghettos, again they told us we were\ngoing to be relocated. I had two younger brothers, of which one was nine and one was\nseven. When they came to take us on to the trucks, as we were walking on to towards the\ntrucks, my youngest brother turned back and ran back into the school. He would not\ncome out. He hid underneath a table. They carried him out, bodily, and threw him on to\nthis truck as he was kicking and crying, as if he knew where he was going to go.",
        "A: .. my grandparents, my aunt, my relatives, and all the other Jews in the community \u2014 we\nwere all loaded onto this train, going to Auschwitz. When we were put onto this train,\nwhich, of course, I don't need to describe to you. It was a cattle car, as you know. No\nwindows and no seats. No toilet. When we got onto the trains, none of us knew we were\nbeing taken to a concentration camp. None of us knew anything about Auschwitz. At\nleast, I don't think we knew. We honestly thought we were going to be relocated. Until\nthe door closed, and we heard the lock go on from the outside. I believe, that was the first\nwe knew wherever we were going to be taken to, it was not going to be freedom, and it\nwas not going to be a great relocation. We were not told where we were being taken to,\nnor did we know what direction we were going in. I recall there was a small window on\ntop of this compartment, the train we were on. They would lift a child up that could read.\nA man would lift the child up as the train would pass a station, so that the child could\nread what direction the train was going in, what stations we passed. And that would give\nus a clue where we were going to. This is how we knew where \u2014 towards what\ndestination we were being taken to. The train would stop once, sometimes twice, a day\nand wait for other Jews to be brought to be put back \u2014 to be put on to this train. Until the\ncompartment was so full that there was standing room only. It got to the point where if\none needed to sit down, someone else needed to stand up; because there truly was\nabsolutely \u2014 it was a packed train. When the train would stop sometimes once a day, they\nwould push in a bucket for our personal use, for toilet. They would push in a bucket of\nwater; and they would take one of the men off the train to go and get water. And usually\nit was a matter of choosing who would go to get this bucket of water, because we weren't\nsure if the person would come back or not. And usually it was a young man that would\nvolunteer. And that bucket of water needed to go around for every single person. And\noften times it didn't make to the very end. Many people would not get any water on that\ngiven day. How do I tell you about a train ride like that? About the dignity that is taken\naway from you when you need to use a bucket as toilet in the middle of a compartment\non a train, in front of everyone? About sharing water with every single person? About the\nmothers holding on to hungry children. The crying. The stink. The fear. It's strange, fear\ngives out a certain smell and that mixed with open bucket \u2014 it's a smell I don't believe one\ncan ever forget. It's, it's not to be described.",
        "A: I believe, two and a half days. I believe we were there two and a half days in all, with the\nstopping and going. I can't tell you exactly. I believe if I live to be 100, that smell will\nstay with me. And I will always hear the crying of the babies; and in particular, the young\nmother trying to feed an infant, breast feed an infant, and not having any milk to feed this\ninfant. These revisionists that don't believe, I would like to take them all and put them\ninto a compartment like that and show them what it feels like.",
        "A: When the train stopped in Auschwitz, of course, we didn't know where we were. The\ntrain arrived in the middle of the night, so we were greeted by very bright lights shining\ndown on us. We were greeted by soldiers, SS\u2019 \u2014 men as well as women. We were greeted\nby dogs and whips, by shouting and screaming orders to try to empty the train, by\n' Schutzstaffeln [Protection Squads] (German)\nconfusion, and by men in striped uniform. We didn't know it at the time, but the men in\nuniform were the Jews who were brought there before us. They were called \"Kanada\u2019,\"\nwhich I found out later. Their job was to empty the train. One of those men saved my life.\nThat was the first. When they had asked us to empty the trains, these men would come\nonto the compartment of the train; and they would try and push and pull us off the train\nas fast as they could. These men were not allowed to speak to us; but, in their own way,\nthey tried to help young people. They walked amongst us, and in Yiddish would whisper\nto a child, \"You're 15. Remember you're 15.\" When we got off the train and they asked us\nto line up according to age, I lined up with \u2014 I became 15 years old, lined up with the 15\nyears old. And I truly believe that man, whoever he was, saved my life. Time out.\n[Pause in interview |",
        "A: When they asked us to line up, of course, ,,. When we, when we got off the train, the men\nneeded to go to one side, the young boys \u2014 I believe it was to the left. It's like a picture.\nThe babies were taken away and put onto trucks. Today that I am a mother and a\ngrandmother, I can understand this more than I did at the time. The young children and\nthe babies that were taken out of mothers' arms and put on to these trucks; and the\nmothers running after them. And the crying and the screaming, \"My baby!\" And they\nwere told they would see them later. Of course, as we know today, they never did. The\nold people, the cripples whoever couldn't walk, these were put on trucks. The young\npeople needed to line up. Women and men were separated, as were children. My mother\nand I stood on the same line when they told us to line up, and then they started to call\nage. Mother was a young woman. They called, \"Age!\" And I told my mother she stood in\nthe wrong line. My mother went into another line. I found out several hours later that the\nline she went in went directly to the gas chambers. I'm sorry.",
        "A: I thought this was going to be an easy interview.",
        "A: I have to back-track a little bit, if I may.\n* Canada (German); term for the warehouse of looted goods at Auschwitz; also used to refer to\nprisoners who where assigned to work in the warehouse facilities.",
        "A: When I came to this country \u2014 I don't know if you want this on the tape or not \u2014 when I\ncame to this country, I came here as a teenager. I had decided that I was going to live as a\nnormal teenager. I could not live with my memories of what had happened. I couldn't\nhandle them. So I had taken all of my memories and put them in a little box, and put them\non the very bottom of my brain. Closed the box never to be taken out, never to be\nexamined. This is how I lived for many years. This is how I handled my past. This is not\nsaying it's right or wrong, but it's saying the way I could cope with it. Except for one\ntime, after I came to this country. My father cornered me and asked me about what had\nhappened: am I sure my mother is dead, and am I sure my brothers are dead? We did not\ndiscuss the Holocaust in our home. It was taboo. I would not associate with any\nsurvivors. I would not join any organizations. I got married. My husband knew I was a\nsurvivor. We raised a child who knew his mother was a survivor, would come home from\nschool when he would learn about the Holocaust \u2014 as little as was taught at that time,\nbecause we're going back 30 some years \u2014 and would ask questions. I could not answer\nthe questions. I would give a one syllable \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. And after a while, a child\nrealizes that these are things we don't talk about. And so he stopped asking. This is how I\nlived for many years. This was my way. Until about five, five and a half years ago, my\nson called one night, and he said, \"Mom, I just read an article in the newspaper put in by\nthe Holocaust Foundation of Illinois, asking for survivors to come forth and have their\nstories recorded.\" He says, \"Mom, you need to do this. You need to do this, because I\nneed to know. It's time.\" And he called me once, and he called me twice; and I kept\nsaying, \"Yes, I'll do it.\" I had seen the article several times, but I ignored it because I\ncould not handle it. And one day he called me and he said, \"If you don't call, I will call\nthe Foundation. Mom, please go. Don't ask for anything. Sign whatever they tell you to\nsign. But ask for a tape. Ask for a tape so that we \u2014 your grandson, now, and I \u2014 will\nknow what happened.\" And so I did. And this is when the memories started to fall back\ninto place. This is when I went back into camp, and started to relive all of this. The\nreason I'm telling you this is because many things are blocked out in my mind. One of the\nthings is, crossing the threshold from the train station into the camp itself. Whether it's\nreally blocked out or not, I don't know. But probably, psychologically, it's there; but it\nneeds to come out. I remember the gate. I can see the gate in front of me: \"Arbeit Macht\nFrei\u2019.\" I see the separation. I see the lines. I see the trucks moving. But I do not recall\ngoing into the camp. The first memory of camp is sitting in a chair and having my hair\nshaved.\nAnd I recall the hair falling in my face, mingling with my tears. And then a uniform\nbeing thrown at me and a pair of clogs. Pushed outside. I recall walking outside, and\n* Work Makes [You] Free (German)\nseeing all of these hundreds and hundreds of other women with their heads shaved. Some\nholding on to their uniforms, and some wearing their uniforms already. And here was\nFritzie \u2014 this pampered child \u2014 thrown into a snake pit, so to speak. A lady walked up to\nme, and kept staring at me. The lady turned out to be my mother's youngest sister, whose\nhair was shaved already and who was in uniform. It was due to that lady that I survived\nAuschwitz concentration camp. But that was really my first memory of walking into\nAuschwitz. This lady held my hand all the way through the months of Auschwitz. I'm not\nsure any survivor can describe Auschwitz to you. I know you said you are going back\nthere; but unless you've lived under those conditions for one day, you will never know.\nHow does one describe the walking into Auschwitz, the, the smell? And someone\npointing out to you that those are gas chambers, that your parents went up in smoke?\nWhen I asked, \"When will I see my mother?\" several hours later after I came into the\ncamp, I was shown the smoke. This is how I found out where she went. How do I\ndescribe fear? How do I describe hunger to someone that has probably had breakfast and\nlunch today? Or even if you're dieting, or even if you're fasting for a day? I think hunger\nis when the pit of your stomach hurts. When you would sell your soul for a potato or a\nslice of bread. I believe that once one has experienced hunger, they will never ever forget\nit. How do I describe living with lice in your clothes, on your body? The stink. The fear.\nThe selections. The Appells\u2019. The being told when to go to a toilet, not when you needed\nto use it. The using of the morning coffee to wash your face with. The knowing that Dr.\nMengele\u201d will be there for his selections every single day. And mostly, mostly death in\nthe gas chambers, the smoke. There 1s no way to describe your first coming to\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: I think the, the reaction is \u2014 I think the first thought is, to survive. Your concern for your\nfamily. Your wondering what happened to them. The people around you. The seeing of\ndeath day in and day out. Not knowing when your turn was going to come. But I think\nthe struggle to survive, in all of us. And, and none of us really know the kind of energy\nwe put in every day to survive, unless we're faced with this. And I know many people\nthought of dying, and many people thought of committing suicide. My thought was\nalways of tomorrow. And I believe that's what \u2014 maybe youth \u2014 but my, my hope was\nalways of tomorrow. The struggles to survive.",
        "A: Selection. We needed to get undressed every day. And we needed to run \u2014 not walk \u2014 in\n* roll call (German)\n> Dr. Josef Mengele\nfront of Dr. Mengele, or his entourage, which was SS soldiers. We needed to show that\nwe still had strength left to \u2014 whether it was to work or to live another day. I recall some\nwomen were beginning \u2014 as the hair grows back, they were beginning to get gray hair.\nAnd they would go and take a little piece of coal from one of the pot-bellied stoves that\nwas in a barrack. And they would use this coal to color their hair with, so that they would\nlook a little younger. I mean, one grayed at the age of maybe 18 or 19 under those\nconditions. And they would run \u2014 we would run in front of whoever it was that was doing\nthe selections, to show that we could survive one other day. If one had a scar, a pimple, if\none didn't run fast enough, if one didn't look right for whatever reason to the particular\nperson that was doing the selection. They would stand there with a stick \u2014 to the right or\nto the left \u2014 as you ran by them. One never knew if they were in the good line or the bad\nline. One line would go to the gas chambers. The other line would go back to the camp\nand to the barracks, to live another day. This is how the selection was done. I believe\nthere were so many people that needed to be gassed every day. And we knew the trains\nwere coming in; and we watched the people marching. And we knew many of the\nbarracks were being emptied out, day in and day out, to make room for the new people\nthat were coming in. We never knew when our turn would come next. So one always\nlived in fear, and one always tried to get through these selections for one more day. And,\nof course, the Appell. They would wake us up at the crack of dawn and empty out the\nentire barracks. And we would need to line up in fives to be counted, twice a day \u2014 the\nfirst thing in the morning and the last thing at night. To make sure no one had escaped, no\none was missing. Sometimes we would stand there for hours and hours. Just stand to be\ncounted, until every single person in the particular camp was accounted for.\nYou must remember, there were thousands and thousands of people in each camp.\nWhether it rained or the sun was out, if it was hot or if it was cold. We had very little\nclothing. And, of course, 1n the summer we had to wear whatever we had. So if the sun\nwould beat down on you, many people would faint during these \"Appell\" counts. Nobody\never wanted to be at the beginning of the line, and nobody ever wanted to be at the front\nof the line; because for whatever punishment was being dished out, they would pull\npeople from the beginning or the end of the line to punish these people. To show us what\nwould happen to us if we did not obey orders in every day living. And, of course, the\ndead people that that would die during the night from starvation or disease, or from\nkilling, from beatings, they too would need to be carried out from the barracks every\nsingle morning, and lined up in front of the barracks. They, too needed, to be counted.\nEvery single body needed to be accounted for. Day in, and day out. We would not get\nany food until every single person was accounted for. And then we were allowed to\nmarch and get our breakfast, which often times just consisted of a cup of coffee. Often\ntimes they would give us a little soup and a small slice of bread. And most of the time, of\ncourse, we didn't have any water. So we would use that hot coffee to wash our faces and\nour hands with. So we wouldn't even get the hot coffee in the morning. This was our\nexistence while we were in Auschwitz. My job in Auschwitz was \u2014 they would line us up\nevery morning and they would take us outside; and we would carry huge rocks from one\nside to another. One day we would come, and we would take these huge rocks from this\nside and we would carry them to that side. The next day, they would bring us back; and\nwe would take these same huge rocks, and we would carry them from that side back to\nthis side. Now you need to know, we were undernourished. We were all weak. And to\ncarry a big rock like that was a lot of weight and a lot of work. By the time they take us\nback to the barracks at night, we could barely crawl. But we needed to show that we\ncould still walk, and we were strong enough to give one more day.",
        "A: That went on for several months. It went on for close to nine months. Until one day they\ncame and they were emptying out our barrack. And we knew exactly where we were\ngoing to go. They lined us up, and they were marching us towards the gas chambers. It\nwas our turn. My aunt and I, and the rest of the women, marched towards the gas\nchambers. And they had a selection. My aunt was chosen to go onto a truck to be taken\nsomewheres else. And I was chosen to stay, to march into the gas chambers. The last my\naunt saw of me, was walking towards the gas chambers as she crawled down from the\ntruck and begged could I come onto the truck with her. And they were laughing and said\nno, but she could come down and join me, as the trucks were pulling away. As we started\nto walk towards the gas chambers and we were walking in, I was at the end of the line \u2014\nagain, because of my aunt. Six of us were pulled out of line; and I was literally in the\ndoor of the gas chamber. I will never know the reason why. Six of us were pulled out and\nput onto another truck, with several other women, to go to work in a factory. Forced\nlabor. When they brought us to the factory, I was the youngest of 600 women.\nOur job was \u2014 we were doing parts. Each one of us had a different job to do, and this was\n\u2014 they were doing parts for airplanes. My particular job was to put the spring into the\ncompass that would go onto an airplane. Because I was the youngest, 599 women shared\ntheir precious food with me. Allowed me a little extra food every day. If anyone could\nrest, I was the one that would rest. I was their hope to survive. I was their hope to carry\nthe message to the world. To tell the world what happened. It took me 40 some years to\nremember a promise I made to 599 women. But I remember today. And I remember\nevery time I stand up to speak, it was due to them that I made the last days of camp.",
        "A: No. I don't know what happened to any of them. As Germany started to lose the war, they\nstarted to gather us, of course, and the famous death march. And we, too \u2014 all of us were\n\u2014 joined a group, the group from other concentration camps and factories. And started the\ndeath march. I don't know if you're familiar with the death march, but it was \u2014 I don't\nknow how to describe it. All of us were weak already, but we knew \u2014 we did not know\nwhere we were going to go, but we knew that it was the last days of the war. We knew\nbecause of the bombings; and we knew because of the way the German soldiers were\npushing us and pulling us already, and emptying the camps and whatever. They took us\nall and put us together, all of the people from camps. And they had us march through\ntowns and through fields. They didn't know where to put us anymore, and they didn't\nknow what to do with us. And there was no food, because the Germans were losing the\nwar. Often times, as they marched us through a town, a window would open and a shutter\nwould open, and either a potato or a loaf of bread would come flying out; and the shutter\nwould close after. And we would all pounce on this potato or this \u2014 whatever this piece of\nfood was that came at us. And, of course, they would shoot at us; but we didn't care at\nthat point, because we were hungry. The streets were literally covered with bodies. As we\nmarched, we would pass bodies. Body after body after body. People that were dropping\ndead from hunger, from disease, from dysentery; because they did not have the strength,\nor because they gave up. So we knew it was towards the very end. We would sleep in the\nfields. We lived on whatever we could find. If we could find a carrot, a potato, snails,\nsnails! In order to survive. The planes would come down low, and shoot at us often times.\nTowards the very last, a friend \u2014 a girl whose name I do not recall \u2014 and I ran into the\nforest. I believe they saw us run. I believe the Germans saw us run; because they could\nhave shot us at that that point. But they didn't. We ran into the forest and spent the first\nnight in the forest sleeping. And we spent all the next day there, because we were afraid\nto go out. And when it started to get dark, she and I found a town to walk to.\nAnd we came to a farmer. And, of course, they had to know who we were. Our heads\nwere shaved and we wore striped clothing. And we begged for food; and they did give us\nfood, and told us to go into the barn. Because they had to go and give us \u2014 get us stamps,\nbecause they didn't have enough food. And we went into the barn; and when the man left,\nwe ran out of the barn and ran away, because we were afraid they would turn us in. And\nwe lived in the forests until the Russians liberated us. You know, as we read books today\nand we watch films, and of course, we know the Germans \u201cdid not know what was going\non.\u201d So they tell us. Not true. They all knew what was going on. They marched us\nthrough the towns to the forced labor, with our heads shaved and wearing striped\nuniforms. Often times, a window would open and they would throw food at us. The\nworkers that worked in the factories with us. They tell us, \u201cHitler did this.\u201d Did Hitler\nreally do this by himself? Are we forgetting the machinery Hitler had working for him?\nAre we forgetting the soldiers that gathered us? The people that took care of the ghettos?\nThe people that drove the trains to Treblinka and other places? The men and women who\nwere the guards in Auschwitz concentration camp? Our neighbors that turned us in? Are\nwe forgetting all of that? Hitler didn't do it by himself. Hitler had lots of help. What about\nthese men that were the guards in the camps, that would go home at night to play with\ntheir children and listen to their music and hug their wives while they were killing our\nparents and our sisters and brothers? Did they keep a secret? Can they keep a secret?\nHow many people can keep a secret? We were told they didn't know. What about all the\npeople that lived in the towns around Auschwitz and other concentration camps, that saw\nthe flames day in and day out? That smelled the stink of the bodies burning, day in and\nday out? What about all the people that saw the trains passing by, and the people begging\nfor water, for food to give to their babies? Why are we forgetting all of that? Why are we\nsaying, \u201cHitler did this?\u201d Yes, Hitler was instrumental in doing this. What about all of\nthose people? What about all of those people that were my age, at that time; and were\ntaught to hate me because I was Jewish, and to hate other Jews? They are my age today.\nDo they love me? I'm the same person, but so are they. Do they love me today? Have\nthey overcome their hatred? Do they forget that, yes, we are Jews, but we're also human\nbeings? Do they forget that we all breath the same? End of speech.",
        "A: I think \u2014 well, as I said, I was liberated by the Russians. I think the first thought is to fill\nyour stomach and to have a warm bath. We're all human.",
        "A: When we heard that Russia had occupied the particular town we were liberated in, we\nwent to them and presented ourselves as prisoners, as they could see, because we were\nskin and bones, and of course our hair had not grown back in the few days, and we were\nstill in uniform. We joined other survivors. They took us to an area where they had other\nsurvivors that they had liberated. And then the Russians took us into a town, where they\ntook over an apartment building; and they put us all into this building and literally made\nit like a ghetto type of a surrounding. Although they did give us all the medical attention\nwe needed, and they did give us food and they gave us a bath and they gave clothing.\nThey had to put guards around us, because they were afraid we were carriers of disease at\nthat point, as probably we were. Most of us were sick. And they \u2014 as I said they put\nguards there; and they put they put wires on the windows. But they did \u2014 we were given\nfreedom at that point. And I think the, the windows and so forth were being protected \u2014\nwe, we were given the protection from their soldiers at that point, more than anything.\nBecause we were women; and, of course, you know, the protection we needed. After that,\nafter we had medical attention and all, they had asked us where we wanted to go. And I\nchose to go back home to my hometown, hoping that someone from my family had\nsurvived and would come back home.\nI was one of the first to come back home. And when we came \u2014 when I came back to our\ntown, our home was destroyed. Soldiers had used it as a lookout post. It was kind of on a\nhill, and they could see different directions from it. So it was totally destroyed. My\ngrandmother's home still stood. There were no windows, but the home was intact. And I\nmoved into that home. And we had a train that would pass by our village once a day. And\nI would go to meet that train every day, to see if someone else had survived. And little by\nlittle, some of our young people started to trickle back, one by one. And my\ngrandmother's home became the gathering place for all of us. We all moved in. We had\nwhat you call communal living; except that we did it out of necessity, 'cause we had\nnothing else. And we all migrated to this one home, and lived off of potatoes and carrots\nor whatever we could get off the fields. Our neighbors did not come to offer us anything.\nOur neighbors \u2014 who used our furniture, who used my aunt's clothes and my mother's\nclothes, that we recognized \u2014 not once came to ask if we needed any food or warm\nclothing. I like to think that it was done out of shame, maybe out of guilt. I don't know. I\nlike to think that this is why they never came forth. And we all lived that way until we all\nwent in our different directions.",
        "A: When I came back to our hometown in Czechoslovakia, my dad was in this country, in\nAmerica. Neighbors \u2014 the post office had mail from my father, who was trying to locate\nhis family. Not knowing what had happened to his family, tried to locate us in any way\nhe could, any of us that had survived. And the post office had some letters that I had\ngotten from my father. And so I knew where he was. I knew he was in America, but did\nnot remember his address. And I was able to get in touch with my father, and he was able\nto send me some money in letters. And an American dollar at that time was a lot of\nmoney. And so I survived on that. And after we lived there for a while, I found that I had\nan uncle that had survived. My mother's youngest brother, who lived in another town. He\ncame to find me, and then the Germans closed the borders between East and West, and\nwe were caught on the Communist side of Czechoslovakia, of course. And my uncle had\nleft. He went to the Sudetenlands. And I was \u2014 my aunt, my one aunt that I survived and I\nwere caught under communism. And my uncle paid a man to smuggle my aunt and to\nsmuggle me over the border in the middle of the night. That's a book I need to write one\nday about that part of it. To smuggle us to the Sudetenlands. And we lived with my uncle\nuntil my father was able to send us papers, and I was able to come to this country. I came\nhere in 1947. I was still of age where I did not need to wait for a quota number, so I was\nable to \u2014 it was a little easier for me to come to this country. And life is as it is today. Life\ngoes on.",
