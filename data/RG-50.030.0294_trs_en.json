        "Q: I'd like you to begin by telling me your full name and when and where you were born,\nand why don't you tell me all your names just so we have a it right here at the\nbeginning of the tape?",
        "A: Should I spell it too?",
        "Q: No, you don't need to spell them because it's on the slate. And then I'd like to you tell\nme a little bit about your childhood and background before the war. Go ahead.",
        "A: I was born in Lublin, Poland on August 8, 1920, son of a middle class family. My\nbirth parents were fairly well to do people, not rich though. My mother was a\nfull-time mom. She used to sing in the path when she was young, but her career\nended before I was born, I understand. My dad was a locksmith and son of 1 of 13\nchildren, and when his father passed away he had to assume the responsibilities of\ntaking care of the entire family of 12 sisters and brothers. Naturally, he had to go to\nwork to support his family. That's why he didn't finish school yet. Eventually when he\nmarried my mom, he graduated from high school, became a locksmith to survive and\nto earn a living, and then slowly in coming years he felt a need for education, and\ngoing to night school, he became an architect. So I was raised in a middle class\nfamily. Very, very happy childhood. I had a sister, was one year older than I was. We\nlived in a big apartment house belonged to my grandparents. The entire family, over\n18, 19 people lived, there all my cousins so we see each other every day. Naturally, as\nyou live with your cousins, one try to outdo the other win, scholastically, otherwise,\nand this was promoted by the parents, particularly our mothers. Now, I was playing\nviolin since I was four and a half years old. I remember my first violin was bigger\nthan I was. I couldn't hold the violin properly. I recall the tortured nights when they\nput cork between my fingers to stretch my ridge of my fingers to reach the octave on\nthe violin. Naturally, this was not very promoting to my music career.\nI never forgot the tortures, but my mother was thus in heaven when I start playing\nparticularly, the concert, or so we had a quartet; my sister playing piano, my uncle,\nmy youngest brother of my dad playing cello, my other cousin was playing viol",
        "A: There was four people and I was playing violin. Of course, we were playing for\nfriends of our parents. I would rather be outside playing tennis or whatever. But this\nwas a ritual that for years was an understandable thing that we have to do and I liked\nit actually. But anyway, until I reach the age of 13 I would say, I had the idea that I\nwant to be a doctor. I don't want to, would like to be a doctor. I don't want to be a\nmusician. I knew I was not Heifetz or Perlman, but my mother would never\nunderstand that, and when I told her I wanted to be a doctor, this was like stabbing\nher in the heart. There were days I refused to practice ... and ... and with time of\nrebellion, a quiet rebellion. But then I had to do it, so after a day or two I start\npracticing again. I was going to school of music. Eventually I graduate ... in academy\nof music, and I was full fledged violinist. In the meantime, my father was involved in\nexpansion of a high school. This was a Catholic high school where the principal was\na bishop. I recall seeing him on occasions, walking in his robe in hallways,\naccompanied by a rabbi with curls, side curls, you know, and this fur hat, you know.\nTo me it was rather odd looking type of a connection here. We lived in the outside of\narea where normally Jewish people lived, what they call Aryan are",
        "A: It was modern edifice and there were no Jewish people around there. So my parents\nspoke Yiddish here and there, mostly Polish though. I did understand Yiddish but I\ncould never speak Yiddish. And one day, going back to the principal of the high\nschool, my dad asked him kiddingly, you know what, my son reaching the age now\nthat you have to enter high school. What you think of my son considered being a\nstudent in your high school? He said \"no problem.\" As soon as he passes the\npre-entrance exam, he accepted. There is no problem. But then my dad replied, but\nthis 1s a Catholic school and we're Jewish. So, ... the principal replied. We prefer a\nJewish student in a Catholic high school.\nBelieve it or not, I started studying hard. I was a good student and I passed exam and\nthe reality came through. I became the first Jewish student in the highly Catholic\nschool, high school. Well, my days in high school were extremely happy. They were\nthe best years of my life. I never felt I'm different. I didn't look different, but on the\nstreet, kids in the area knew who I was. They called me, you dirty Jew. You filthy\nJew, for no reason. But my high school I was never approached like this. I was\nrespected by my colleagues. I think they liked me. I was excellent student. I was even\nassigned by teachers of certain class like French, Latin, geography, history, to tutor\nmy colleagues from the same class that didn't do so well, and all of them went\nthrough and passed the exams. So, I was very happy to hear that I was instrumental in\nhelping my colleagues, and it developed a certain type of rapport with them, not\nbecause they are dependent on me, but it helped us to bind us together, I would say.\nAnd, I was very active in French club which I organized. I was very active in an art\nclub which I organized, and then musical circle too, and then eventually I was\nnominated by the director of the musical department school to participate in our\nsymphony orchestra in high school, to a point on one day we had a contest in our\ntown of different symphony orchestras in different high schools and this took place in\none big theaters in the city, and won the first prize and I was playing solo forget like\ntoday and I thought, my mother was very proud of me then. She seen certain things,\nyou know, that she hoped maybe I would fulfill a dream, and I was glad to give her\nthis kind of satisfaction although, innerly I felt that's not the road of my future. I was\njust insisting I would do something else and occasionally we discussed this and my\nmom didn't want me to talk about it about it. And there were different days you\nrespected your parents more and whatever they say, really this was the way it was\nsupposed to be. Maybe I was the first one in our generation in those days, that made\nquiet rebellion against, quietly, yet in the beginning but persistently pursued further.\nAnyway, my school days were really fantastic. Sundays was customarily thing that all\nboys high school all in uniforms would marching to church. I was in front with the\nband. I was playing saxophone and clarinet in the band. And then when we arrived in\nthe church, 800 or so students, went up to the church and my road led to the choir,\nand I was playing violin with the choir. Naturally, I was quite acquainted with the\nrituals with the prayers for eight years I was in school there and I felt that I'm\nCatholic, except I was not baptized. I had Christmas tree at home next to Hanukkah.\nAnd I had a, had a kind of natural thing to do. No one making fun of this. But then\nhere and there in the city when I went to the park or so, I seen Anti-Semitic remarks,\nand knowing who I was. One day I remember I was little. We went to the park,\nwintertime, and one of my dad's employees took a sled. I was on the sled. He was\npulling me on the sled. He was a professional wrestler, huge man, muscular man\nyoung in his 20s or so. It was a scene, a scene I never forget. Students of the local\nuniversity, Catholic university attacked an older Jew, religious person with his side\ncurls on, attacked him with sticks at the end which were razor blades. They are\ncutting off his side curls, and by doing this they chopped off his ear. Blood was\nflowing and I never forgot. I was a young kid. But they seen us watching them from a\ndistance. They ran toward us, tried to attack us. But my dad's employee was very fast,\nathletic and so on, he pulled that sled fast and they were falling, you know, in\ndistance and couldn't reach us. But eventually, they blocked our path, you know, and\nthey pinned us against the wall. He made a mincemeat out of them. He beat them so\nup, you know, that eventually police came in and arrested him. The fact that we were\nattacked meant nothing. I think he put to jail then. This was one episode I remember.\nBut this never happened in my school though. In school, I was person, that I was not\na Jew. I was respected by my teachers, professors, by the priests, you know, by\neveryone. That's why my memories going back now to those days are really great.\nAnd, I didn't realize at that time eventually, very soon afterwards this connection with\nmy high school and friends, colleagues, classmates, professors would help me\nsurvive. So this is about my childhood, very happy with a lovely apartment.",
        "Q: When was that incident with the --",
        "A: This was probably in about '32, '34, 1933, '34, about five years or so before the war.\nThis was not an isolated incident. There were more incidents like this from then on.\nThere was more German propaganda after Hitler came to power in '33. Then you seen\npeople very traumatic. In front of Jewish stores, Polish people standing with signs \"do\nnot buy from the Jews, they steal your money.\" And in spite of this, many people\ngoing to Jewish stores, and then they are leaving the stores they were someone taking\ntheir pictures and eventually, they were using those photographs, the photographs in\nthose and placing the propaganda with the name of the people who frequent Jewish\nstores. And I seen all those things. I was already confused. Here I am in Catholic high\nschool. I thought I was Catholic. And to me, being Jewish didn't mean nothing. We\nare not a religious family although my parents had a kosher home, for one reason. All\nthe Jews had kosher home. They felt that the meat was cleaner, more hygienic. Meat\nwas not bought from a peasant who slaughtered the cattle some place in a barn, didn't\nknow how hygienic was done. So no one got sick from eating kosher meat or so, but\nthat's the only reason. But otherwise, we are not religious. But to explain yet my\nparents attitude towards me as their son, and to build up my identity although, they\nwere not religious I say. Once a year we going to the little Synagogue was actually\nsomebody's like apartment, where the Jews were praying all day long. I remember\nthat I was little boy then. I couldn't wait until the service was over. There was so\nstuffy. There was no air conditioning and I would rather to go out and play with the\nkids, but here I am, stuck with older people, you know, for a whole day until you are\nallowed to eat. You are not allowed to eat until sundown you know, so for a child,\nyou know, this was ... but food was not a problem really, but those scenes you know,\nI remember until today. And then to reinforce my identity who I was my parents hire\na teacher which they call a Rebbe.\nRebbe is not a rabbi. It is someone whose very well versed in the Hebrew teachings,\nyou know, and the religious laws and so on. And he was coming, I don't recall, three\nor four times a week to my home, and I remember he was falling asleep while he was\nreading to me and when he was half asleep, I was changing the book, you know. I\nwas turning over the pages, you know, so we would get faster, you know. And when\nhe woke up, half the book was turned over without him realizing it even. But, I got\nthe touch of it anyway, you know. Not that I learned anything from him. But there is\nsomethings I learned some things, prayers, you know, and but until today I was not\nvery comfortable being in a Synagogue because I didn't grow up in that kind of\nsurroundings you know. But I knew who I was. Then since there was a Catholic\nschools and there was so many other Jewish students in different schools. None\nCatholic but state schools who didn't had no formal Jewish education. So once a week\none of the professors of Jewish, of Jewish history was coming to our school Catholic\nschool teaching us about Jewish history, talking about the exodus of the Jews from\nEgypt and all the uprisings you know, the Jewish history and we, so more or less\nwere not ignorant about those things and then were graded on the base of his report.\nBut I was also graded on New Testament, which I attended, so I was graded on the\nNew Testament and also the Old Testament and religious education, and I had two\ngrades. And this was very happy solution to me until summer of '39, prior to\nSeptember 1, 1939. Rumors of Hitler Army moving, probably to Poland. We invade\nPoland. We on vacation at time, summer vacation and of course, most of the Jews\nbelittle the rumors. All Jews all rumor this and that, but as a precaution they decide to\ncut short vacation and come home. Sure enough, September 1, '39 war broke out.\nPolish Army didn't last too long, Within less than two weeks, or three weeks. The\nwhole army fall apart. Our government left Poland, first to escape, and only one that\nstood up yet was Warsaw, was defending self for several weeks. And Germany have a\nhell of a time, the whole of Poland was invaded already and Warsaw was still\nfighting. In the meantime the Germans entered our hometown. First thing they did, all\nthe Jews have to register.\nAll the Jews have to give up their possessions. Their music instruments, piano, grand\npiano, furs, jewelry, libraries, whatever was of certain worth to them they had to give\nit up. And of course, means of communications, telephones and radio. Germans were\nafraid of the local population listening to the radio, to BBC maybe. So we're not\nallowed to have the radios, and one day I remember my dad came home bloodied up.\nHe was beaten by the Pole and the Germans. He was caught on the street. He was\nthere to do some work you know, some labor work that day and they beat him up as a\nprepay and sent him home. When I seen this, I seen what was to come here. I recall\nwe sitting together, the whole family at the table, discussing what should we do. It\nwas too late to run. West we couldn't go, wanted us to know that Russia divided\nPoland with the Germans. The Soviet Army actually came from the East going West\nand they stopped at the River Bug and the German Army stopped at the River Bug\ntoo and our town was slightly west of the River Bug so we were at the fortune to be\nunder German occupation. Some of my colleagues, Jewish colleagues, decided to go\neastward, to the Germans. With the blessing of my family, I took a bicycle. My\nparents provided some cigarettes for me, for this was the best means of bribery and\nmoney didn't mean nothing. So if you want to ... were caught by anyone, especially\nSoviet solders, by giving a carton of cigarettes you buy your way out. There was not\ndocuments except the old Polish documents, and took me about a week to reach\ndestination far east in Poland. A little town named Rovno. Why do you go to Rovno?\nRovno was a city where my uncle, the younger brother of my father lived, and I\nthought at least I find somebody a relative of course. I arrived there. My ultimate goal\nwas to enter the school there and study medicine. But I was not accepted, maybe as\nmuch as good as I thought I will be. Mainly, because food was a problem. Staying in\nthis small, cramped quarters, you know. He was married. Had one boy, baby boy, and\nI know it was very difficult for them.\nSo I try to spare them the problem and I decided to leave and go to Lvov, the\nGermans call Lemberg, which was a big city, about 250,000 people, site of\nuniversity, formally under the jurisdiction of Austria, Hungary. Many intelligent\npeople spoke German, and it was just a beautiful city and I was very fortunate to take\nmy pre-entrance exam and be accepted in medical school. Now you have to\nunderstand, that I was a refugee. I had nothing with me. I had no money. I had no\nclothing except what I had with me and I was hungry most of the time. But I still felt\n... Lalways promised my parents I would pursue my education and that kind of an\nobligation I felt I should fulfill, and for myself too. I always wanted to be a doctor. So\nI was smart enough to find my way through and I was employed by the school\ncafeteria. I cleaned the tables. I was getting three meals and then knowing the\npeople, then slowly, I was fortunate enough to secure myself a bed and in a room for\nstudents, like a dormitory. And I was paired with another student, also a refugee from\nmy hometown. We became good friends and I was doing well in school.",
        "Q: This is 1939?",
        "A: '39.",
        "Q: And you were how old then?",
        "A: I was 19. And through 1940 I was doing nothing but studying. I wasn't hungry no\nmore, and that's a time that we didn't have no communication with my home, Lublin.\nI was very bothered with the fact that I didn't know what was going on with my\nparents and my older sister. There was no way you could communicate there. I sent a\nfew messages through people, peasants they used to smuggle items going one way or\nthe other to the border, but allegedly they never received letters from me, which I\nlater found out. One day who knocks on my door? I open the door. Who is there? My\ndad. He swam through the River Bug and being pursued by the Germans and the\nRussians, arrested by the Russians as a spy and he bought his way out, explained he\nwas not a spy, a Jew looking for his son. They let him go. Happened to be a Jewish\nofficer understand. He came to Lvov.\nHe found me and looked at me and he was crying because I never looked so\ndilapidated, so abandoned like. And I didn't have a coat. I didn't have a blanket. At\nnight I covered myself with my overcoat, my blanket, but I was not cold. But he\ndidn't get used to this picture because I was always well-dressed and a well-to-do\nfamily, and so on and here -- I try to explain to him not to worry about me here. At\nleast nobody is going to kill me here. Nobody was going to shoot me. I still get my\neducation and I asked him maybe to stay with me, and we looked for ways to bring\nmy mother and my sister to us. There was no way. My dad refused to do that. \"There\nwas no way to do that.\" And he is stay with me for a few days only. I remember\ntoday, he sat on my coat. A button was missing. He said, if your mother would see\nthat she would be very unhappy. And he got a button someplace and a thread and sew\nthe button on my coat. I never forget those little things ... Then we parted...while I\nthought I would never see him again. But the meantime life was going on. I was\ngoing to school. 1941, July, war again. Germany, in spite of their pact with the Soviet\nRussia, they invade Eastern Poland and first thing what happened, Ukraine students\nin the dormitory, Knew who was the Jewish student. They grabbed me, one of my\ngood friends, Ukrainian, grabbed me beating the hell out of me. Forced me to scrub\nthe floor of a pub they had opened up for German officers. From then I was taken to a\nlabor camp in Janowska street in Lvov. It was not a concentration camp, it was a\nlabor camp, but the way they treated us was just like concentration camp. We lying\non wooden boxes really. Not in bed, boxes. There was nothing to eat. And we had to\nbe on a field at 5 am. wintertime. If you didn't stand straight, they beat you. They kick\nyou from the front, from the back, from the side. You couldn't go down or they would\nshoot you. So the awareness of not to go down, the beating always kept me aware of\nit, to stand up and I was numb. And after a while I didn't feel the beating even and\nthen maybe at 7am. or so we marching to the city to work, and after a few days I\nthought well, there was nothing to expect. I run away. And, where you going to go? I\nrun away to the dormitory. That's the only place I knew. However, I found three of\nmy colleagues, Jewish students, hiding in the basement. How they escape I don't\nknow, because they went through the building very thorough, using the Ukrainian\npolice with the Germans. We decided to go eastward. The Russians were still not too\nfor from the city, so hiding, going to the fields at night or so. We try to stop some of\nthe Russian trucks so they can maybe pick us up so we can go with them east to\nRussian. Well, they pointed their guns to us.\nThey didn't know who we were. They were afraid too. They were running away\nthemselves. So walking about 70 kilometers, mostly during the night, some during the\nday, especially through the forest so we would not be visible. We reached the town\nnamed Zolochev. It was a town of about 35,000 people, I would say 80 percent Jews.\nWith my luck, wouldn't you believe we walked in at a time when there was a big\npogrom taking place. Right away we were caught by the Ukraines, brought us to a\nsquare, town square and put in front of a small building which was the administrative\nbuilding, I understand. Here in front of us were bodies of Jews, piled one on top of\neach other, dead. They said to line up, four of us, with hands up, and there were about\nfew thousand maybe 2000 to 3000 spectators in the town square, mostly Ukraine.\nAnd we seen the SS or Gestapo, I don't remember which. I think it was SS and firing\nsquad. Before you knew you were there, right there and we supposed to be executed.\nWell, you know, this moment my whole childhood went through my mind. I close my\neyes. I seen everything. I remember first time, I recall any event which was a funeral\nwhen I was five years old. From then on, my childhood, my sister, my parents, my\nhigh school, the principal, the bishop, everything until this moment and like a movie.\nI said, that's a very short life though. And I didn't hear nothing. I just became totally\nnumb.\nMaybe it's like a self-defense mechanism with your body that if you know that you\nwere facing your final hour, maybe that's what it was. I was never a victim of\nexecution. So you don't know how to behave. It was so quiet, so peaceful, and I didn't\nhear a thing. And I was totally frozen. There were four of us lined up and I was\nsecond from the left. And then after a while, I don't know how long it lasted, I slowly\nopened my eyes, slowly. I thought, I cannot be dead. Its so quiet and peaceful. Where\nam I? Slowly, I turn to the left, slowly to the right, mostly with my eyes only, and I\nseen my colleague to the right. The last one was slumped over on the ground, so I\ndidn't know if he was dead or not. But all my other colleagues, one on the left, one on\nthe right, were standing like myself, erect and still. Slowly I turn more and more and I\nlook around and I see nobody. Totally turning around I look, thousands of bodies on\nthe ground. I don't know what happened. They looked like Muslims praying, you\nknow. And they were all dead. Making a long story short, I found out that two\nRussian planes came in, seen a gathering with the police and the German and they\nstart shooting and bombing the area. One colleague was killed. We believed he was\nmost likely killed by the Russians accidentally, not by the execution, the firing squad.\nWhen see what was going on. The three of us grab my little suitcase, tiny little satchel\nactually, and run to the river. The pogroms were still going on in the rest of the city.\nWe hid in the river, up to our necks. We took some bushes to cover our heads. We\nstayed there at least three or four days or nights. Until we frozen to death. We\ncouldn't stand it no more. We were hungry, exhausted. We didn't care. We're\ndesperate and we just didn't care what happened to us no more. So we decided to get\nout the river, and walking toward some buildings we heard Ukrainians say, Oh, three\nmore Jews not killed? How comes? You know, we kept walking, walking. I don't\nknow how we happened to -- we walked into a hospital, local hospital, happened to\nbe a Jewish hospital. Pogrom was over. Whoever was killed was killed. Thousands of\npeople were killed and they accepted us.\nThey fed us. They cleaned us, gave us some clothing and shelter and bed and asked\nus to work in the hospital. But I didn't know what happened to my family. This was a\nvery close-nit family and I had to find out if they were still alive or not. I didn't know\nhow to make contact with the family. So I decided to go back to Lvov, Lemberg,\nwhich was my university, and I thought we knew some Polish people there. Maybe\nsomehow they heard something, what happened to my hometown at least. So again,\nsmuggling our way through, all three of us went back to the Lvov and I did visit one\nof the families. They didn't hear nothing but they say they will be able to transfer\nsome of my message to the family if I know the address. But I didn't know the\naddress. But there was no problem finding where the Jews are living now in Lublin.\nAfter a while, someone came to me, I was staying with those people, the Polish\npeople. The ghetto was not fully forming yet at that time so Jews were moving\naround, not freely, but they could move around. They had to be at dusk in their\nquarters, you know. And a Polish fellow came to me and said my father contacted\nhim to bring me back home. He was a cab driver who drove all night, only during the\nnight, so he wouldn't be caught either. He had some false papers on some kind of\nPolish mission and I went with him back home, leaving my two friends behind, not\nknowing if we ever see each other, saying good-bye to each other. Driving at night,\nwe atrived home. Of course, I found my family not in the original home anymore.\nThey were moved to a ghetto area which was behind ... the old town, the Jews used\nlive there before, was a gate entrance. You had to go, pass through, show your ID\nYou go could to work through the gate again into the city. My father worked as an\narchitect. Again, he worked for the German railroad, so right away I was a medical\nstudent. But he got me a job on the construction of the railroad as a medic. I had a\nwhite band with red cross on it. I didn't have nothing else with me. I could do nothing\nfor anybody who got sick. I didn't know nothing about.\nAnyway, I was not a doctor yet, but this was a way of surviving, you know. And with\nhim every day to construction and I made a lot of contacts there with many Polish\npeople. I contact some of my school friends and they were happy to see me I was still\nalive. They ask me what they can do for me. At that time I didn't know what they\ncould do for me. We are not still in the situation very desperate yet ... and ... we were\ngoing through several selections what they used to call. Selection was the means of\nwhen the Germans coming to the ghetto. One night they arrive, maybe one in the\nmorning. They want to have a grand piano. Where we going to get a grand piano? We\nwere not allowed to have a grand piano. Remember, in '39 all the Jews have to give\nup all the musical instruments. So they didn't care where to get a piano. Buy it. Where\nyou a going to buy a piano at one o'clock in the morning even if you have the money?\nSo the people had to be taxes, I don't recall the sum of money needed, but early the\nmorning they went to town and they bought a grand piano and delivered a grand\npiano to the Germans. So we got a reprieve. A month later another selection. People\nwere not necessary for the German government to sustain the war machine were\neliminated. They were selected left, and right, left and right, and whoever was not\nneeded were disappeared actually. They took them by trucks and they left, no one\nknew where they went. We were fortunate. We were still together, the whole family\nuntil about April of 1942. In 1942 in April, the rumor was that the Germans are going\nto move all the Jews outside the city, there special quarters made for us. It's going to\nbe like a summer home for the Jews there. Little gardens we could go till our soil, and\nwe still working for them. Whoever is working 1s going to be working. From about 60\nor 70 thousand Jews there were only four thousand Jews left then. Mind you, that\nmany Jews were eliminated during my absence when I went East. So I came back\nthere was just about 4000 Jews. We had to march by the foot about 15 kilometers\nwithout belongings to new quarters. We took place the little -- village name was\nMajdan Tatarski. '\nThis was a little village of horse thieves and some peasants. They had a little cattle,\nlike a pig or two, dogs, and you know, and they put the Poles and the Jewish in the\napartment balconies. You could see a pig on the balcony and they were not very\nunhappy about it. They were not used to living in an apartment house, and the Jews\nwere in a little town not far away from the city, about several kilometers away from\nthe city, and this little town was surrounded by empty fields. So was at that time no\none thought about it that. This was strategically figured out by the Germans because\nthey won't be able to hide. There are all empty fields around this little town.\nUnbeknown to us they are building already a concentration camp, Majdanek, which\nwas only three or four kilometers away from this area. Some of my fathers Polish\nfriends were employed as carpenters, came back and told my father. They are\nbuilding some there, something very suspicious. We are working on it. We don't\nknow what is it. It is some kind of barracks, but maybe its for the German Army, for\nthe soldier or so. But then they building something like ovens, or something. We\ndon't know what it's for and some of the Polish people say, I bet you they\ncrematorium to burn the Jews. And that's how the rumor started. But where you going\nto go? There 1s no place to go. And in January I think, January ... No, no I'm sorry,\nnot January. November 9 was total liquidation of our ghetto. Early in the morning the\nUkraine Army, not Army, the soldier and the policeman surrounded the ghetto with\nsome Lithuanian policeman too, and they said everybody has to report at different\ngate and they will be deported to labor camps. That's all that was said. As my wife\nsaid in her statement before, my father built a little hiding place by doubling a wall\nthrough a hidden door. We could stay there in, only in standing position. This was not\na hiding place for a long lasting type of escape or so, hiding. You could maybe hide\nthere for a few hours or so, a day maybe and that is about all. We see the futility of\nthe whole thing. Because the announcement you could hear through the loudspeakers\nwhile were hiding. Anybody found hiding after such and such a time, 7 am will be\nshot.\nSo your only time to escape now is to get out now. My parents decided to leave and\ngo. They want me to save myself. I took Lucine my friend at that time to my hiding\n' Majdan Tatarski: or Maydan Tatarski.\nplace away from her parents because they had no place to hide at all. After we seen\nthe futility of our hiding place there was no point in doing that, and my parents\ndecided to go with the rest of the people. We escaped from this hiding place, went to\nthe attic of the Jewish Administration Building where Lucine's father was still active\nthere, and through the hole in the wall I see my parents and my sister walking with\nhundreds of people to unknown, to the concentration camp. That's the last sight of my\nparents I seen. I try to grab my sister to try maybe to escape together, but I didn't\nknow how and where and when. She didn't want to leave my parents. My parents\ninsisted I don't go with them, so I stayed with Lucine, not knowing what we going to\ndo next. And the picture of my parents huddling, holding each other, embracing each\nother, and the snow falling down called November, early morning, never leave my\nlife, always remember that picture. We still have about two hours time to the\ndeadline. Her father bribed the Ukrainian guard some gold coins and the a fountain\npen, a bottle of vodka I think, so he would just ignore us, not to look our way while\nwe try to lift the barbed wire, sneak right under the wire, escape. That's what we did.\nOne of the -- one, myself, my wife, her little brother was about eight or nine years old\nat that time. From under the wire we run away. We running zig zag fashion.\nUkrainian guards and other guards are shooting after us but didn't hit us, and, after\nrunning for two, three kilometers we found a Polish peasant who was going home in a\nwagon, horse-driven wagon. He gave us a lift, you know. He probably suspected who\nwe were because there was no other people in this area. He didn't said nothing then,\nnothing to us. He pretend that he didn't know nothing.\nAnd where we go from here? No plan, no money, no documents of any kind. First\nthought was to go to a bishop's palace. This was not the bishop who was the principal\nat the high school, but the gardener at the bishop's palace. Their son was a friend of\nmine that I tutored in high school. We knock on their doors early in the morning.\nWhen his mother seen me, she cross herself. She said, My God, where is your mom\nand dad? I said, they left already. What are you doing here? We looking for shelter.\nCan you help me? She took us to greenhouse. It was nice and warm there but she\nsaid, look, you can only stay here until early in the morning because this was Sunday,\nbecause next Monday morning the workers coming in they find you hiding, they\nwould denounce you to the Gestapo or the Polish police, and you know what they do\nwith us they find you hiding here? They kill us all. So we stayed there. She fed us,\ngave me a coat and a jacket, of her husband. Her son was missing in the war. She\ndidn't know where he was. He turned out to be later on in the British RAF. He\nsurvived the war, but she never forgot what I done for her son. He passed all the\ngrade because I tutoring him, French, Latin, math, history and she felt very bad. She\nwanted to help but she was scared stiff and I understood. I don't know if situation be\nreversed how would I behave? Would I have the guts to hide those people under a\ndeath threat? In all honest, I don't know if I could do it. I did understand their\nmotivation and their fears but was grateful, they kept me at least overnight to get our\nthoughts together. And then I remember my dad's associate, a Polish fellow. My dad\ngave him all the shops. Give to him as a present since he couldn't keep it himself. So\nhe inherit all the tools and the machinery, so on, and he not too far away from the\nbishop's palace. So, early in the morning before the workers arrive, we went there and\nknocked at the door again, and the same story. He crossed himself. My God, where's\nyour dad? Told him the whole story again. He said, let's go right now through\nwarehouse and nobody will see you.\nSo he hid us for several days there brought us a little food there, and he gave us\nnames of people to contact in the Polish underground. Maybe they can do something\nfor us. While I was waiting there hidden with her little brother, my wife, without\ndocuments, went to Warsaw by train, which was a life-threatening situation, to\ncontact some people who knew how to get the documents. Mind you we have no\nmoney, no money. This was name of the game. You're not alive you have no money.\nShe contact some people. She was directed to some hotel where the Polish\nunderground was there and they were manufacturing false documents. Over there she\nmet a friend of her father who was already ... domesticated, so to say. He had his\ndocuments. He lived on the Aryan side. He tried to seduce my wife, at that time not\nmy wife yet. Tell her he would help her only if she would stay with him. Of course,\nshe rejected the whole thing and she left him. She came home back with false\ndocuments. Now, how do you move from a hiding place broad daylight if your\nhometown, not too big of a town, but people might know you and you didn't know\nwho was going to denounce you? We couldn't go to the railroad station. The station\nwas surrounded by police and Gestapo, but at least we've had documents, so we are\nhire a driver with a buggy whom took us to next little town which was about 15\nkilometers away, at night. How this man never suspected. If he did suspect, he never\nsaid a word to us. Who we were. It was obvious, you know. We were like odd people,\nodd couple. Myself, little boy didn't look like our son. Too young for that. It was\nunusual situation so anyone with common sense would know who we are. Arriving in\nthe darkness in a little railroad station and we boarded a train. I was very upset, very\nnervous on the train. I had documents, but, they're false documents. And after maybe\ntwo, three hours ride on the train, all of a sudden train stops. Doors open. German\nGestapo, SS walks into each car. Asks documents, everybody's documents.\nWell, we are not sitting together. I pretend I do not know my wife, my Lucine, I\nmean, my friend, in front at that time in case one is caught, maybe other escape and\nlittle boy sitting with her, just in case, her brother. And then one of the officers comes\nin and points out to young man. You, you, you, you. One of them was me. This 1s it.\nBut there were mostly Polish people there. I was kind of confused. What's going on?\nWell, they were catching Poles too to send to labor camps you know, to send most to\nGermany. Get out they say. So I got out. I line up with a few other people. Maybe one\nof us young guys -- and go with me. I thought we shot probably. So what happened?\nWe went to the first car and we start going to car to car, through the whole train. They\nwere liquidating all the ... tobacco, food, hams, meats, that the Polish peasants were\nsmuggling to the city to sell in the black market. And we are the people that supposed\nto carry all the stuff to their cars. And this took about two hours, and at the end this,\nhe gave me a big ham. Payola, and back to the train. And so went back to the train\nand arrived at midnight in Warsaw. You know by now that we were accosted by a\nrickshaw driver. We request to go to same hotel that my wife knew about when she\ngot the false papers. This was the headquarters of the refugees. How the Gestapo\ndidn't know about it yet I don't know, but it's the only place we knew of. The ultimate\nplan was either to make contact to stay in Warsaw proper on the Aryan side, or if not,\ngo back to the Warsaw ghetto which was still big and maybe look up her uncle who\nlived there. Maybe he be instrumental in assisting us. So we gave him the address\nwhere to go but we see he is going to the opposite direction and we ask him, where\nyou going? He said, oh, you know where I am going. I'm going to, you know, I'm\ngoing to Aleja Szucha\u2019 which is known headquarters of the German Gestapo. Why\nyou take us there? You filthy Jews. I'm going to be paid for you very well. And I said,\nhow much can you get paid for that? So we didn't deny the fact anymore. We didn't\nadmit who we are, but it was obvious. I said, look, take whatever we have. We don't\nhave much but whatever we have is yours. What you going to gain? They going to\nkill us. So, he took my coat, my boots, left me with my socks, scarf, a fountain pen,\nlittle money we had, not much, took her purse, everything.\nLeft us in the middle of the street past midnight, that if we could be caught by any\npatrol, you know, and killed right away. Anybody moved after midnight was a game,\nyou know, they were shooting. They didn't ask any questions, and we found a way to\nthis hotel. Over there we made contact with some people. We see we have no way of\nstaying outside the ghetto, so we contact a man who was involved in the labor groups\ngoing in and out of ghetto. One of them was a friend of my father. He was from my\nhometown. He knew my father very well. So when he recognized me he said, come in\nat four o'clock. I will take you to the ghetto when the group is finished working. We\narrived there at four o'clock. He took us all, my wife, her little brother, myself to the\nghetto. Was a horrifying sign in the picture of the ghetto. I'm not used to it. Even in\nour ghetto in Lublin, the situation was not as desperate as in Warsaw. There was\nabout 60,000 Jewish living in that ghetto. There were many dead bodies lying in the\nstreet covered with newspapers. The stench of the bodies, you know, flies, and people\nbypassing them like nothing happened, just macabre sight. This is what we came to\nghetto for. People dying like this. Better off dead, being shot by German. We found\nour way to Lucine's Uncle's house. He was very well-to-do person. He was employed\n* Alea Szuch A. Szucha Avenue, or Lane.\nby American Joint Committee before the war in a very high position. Very wealthy\nperson. They had a little baby girl so we said look, we don't have no place to go. We\nhave no money. We have nothing. Could you help us. So he said, well, I don't know\ntemporarily, why don't you sleep on the floor in the kitchen and Lucine -- her name\nwas Estera at that time -- you sleep upstairs 1n the attic. He never asked us if we\nwanted to eat anything or not. We were hungry and we were depressed and\ndevastated morally and broken down, sleeping at nights. Maybe 2:00, 3:00 AM I seen\ncandlelight. I seen waking up at night her uncle and her aunt eating food, you know.\nThey never ask us if we want to eat anything. They didn't want to share the food with\nus. There was not much food at that time, so they tried not to share it with us. I\ncouldn't blame them really, you know.\nBut we seen how can we live like this, you know. Then they got the bright idea you\ncannot live under one roof without being married. Well, Lucine was only 16 years old\nand he said we have a friend who is a rabbi, a friend of your father -- meaning Lucine\n-- I'll try to contact. Maybe he marry you since he knew your father. Turned out he\nwas sick at that time with typhus, and so he found another different young rabbi.\nWithout having a ring, without having any proper clothes or suit or a dress for her, we\ngot married. There was a young couple before us. Somehow they got us bottle of\nwine. We got married. We toast each other with their wine and after the wedding\nceremony, which only the two people, the previous couple witnessed and also her\ncousin -- which survived the war too, he witnessed so till today were the only ones\nwitnessed our wedding. Leaving the ceremony, she run into a lady who recognize her,\nfriend of her mother, who was just out with her husband. So she said, we just got\nmarried but no rings. She took the ring off her finger. Why don't you take my ring?\nMaybe bring you good luck, and she give her ring. And this was our honeymoon in\nthe Warsaw Ghetto. We decided to move out of her Uncle's house. We had to really.\nWe found one little rooms, cramped, with other people. They allowed us to use one\nbed. There were no mattresses. You just improvise by taking a sack, a canvas type of\nsack filled with straw and put some towels over it and no sheets. That was your bed\nand, but I had contacts.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Let's got back and tell me the incident in the garage.",
        "A: I have to regress and recall some incidents I would like to mention maybe. When I\ncame back from Zolochev back to Lvov or Lemberg, when before I met my three\nother colleagues from medical school. During the one occasion when I was I was\ncaught by my Ukrainian colleague and he asked me -- he forces me to clean the pub,\nthe floor etcetera. One of the days I went to work they asked some people, who\u2019s a\nmechanic? This was a good profession to be in. Without hesitation I raised my hand. I\nmechanic. I never touched anything mechanical in my life, but many people were\ndoing the same thing, and they took me on the side and one mechanic came in, turned\nout to be a Jewish boy too, and ten of us we took the police garage. They gave us\nsome quarter there, a bunk bed. They fed us good and asked us to work on their cars.\nI admitted to the man, chief mechanic, that I have no blind idea about mechanics. He\nsaid, shhh, be quiet. We'll help you what we can. I'll tell you what to do. Just unscrew\nthis portion and then oil this part and so on. We'll tell you what to do so don't worry\nabout it. I'm running the show. You do what I tell you to do. Was very nice about it.\nAnd so I was there for maybe a few weeks. We're fed well. We're not beaten. The\nGermans usually say hello to us. The German Police, it was not the Gestapo, this was\nnot the SS. And one day during the evening, one of the German officers approached\nme in the garage and took me on the side and asked me, 1s it true you're medical\nstudent? And I said, yes. He said look, I want you to be aware of it that as of tonight\nthey're going to liquidate the garage and they'll take you all of you away.\nI don't know where, you won't stay here. I want you to know there's a stable on the\nleft wing of the building there, and I will give you something to carry for me to the\nstable now and I will meet you over there. I was very puzzled with the whole thing\nbut you do obey orders. I went there, I followed him, went there with this big box.\nThen he show me behind where the horses are placed. there's a little hiding place.\nYou stay there. They will never find you there and at night after they liquidate this\ngarage, and so on. You can stay until next day or so and somehow you have to get out\nof here and go to town and I'm bring you something. He went, came back maybe a\nfew minutes later, and brought me a whole chicken. He said, that's all I can do for\nyou. I can do nothing else for you. I'm so sorry, and he left. I don't know his name,\ndon't know who he was. I know he was a doctor in German Army. He was not a\nGestapo, he was not an SS man, he was not a policeman. He was a physician, very\nyoung. In his upper 20s maybe. That's the only benevolent act I have encountered\nfrom Germans.",
        "Q: Did you hear something that night while you were hiding there?",
        "A: I heard some voices only, noises, but not very loud, and then everything was quiet.\nAnd the next morning gates were opening and closing and cars trucks moving out,\nand the whole regiment of the police left the compound and there was no one left\nbehind, and I waited until night, following night, and I through the fence I find my\nway back to the city, to the ghetto area. And I approach some of the Jewish people\nthere and they let me sleep in one the rooms there, and that's next day I went out to\nthe ghetto with the work battalion. And I approached one the Polish people that I\nknew from before who could contact my father, which I mentioned before. This was\non one episode. Then when I came back home and prior to liquidation of the ghetto\nfew days before, I did try to escape. We did know that the ghetto was going to be\nliquidated completely and I tried to run away, and going under the barbed wire the\nUkraine were shooting at me. I was running like a wild beast and they wouldn't have\ncaught me if not the police dog. He grabbed, forgive my French, my buttock, ripped a\npiece of flesh out and my calf and subdue me. I was bleeding all over. Then I was\ncaught by the Ukrainian guards and they brought me back to the ghetto and handed\nover to the Gestapo, and they start beating me up.\nThey were beating me, standing behind me with a -- we call it a peitsche.\u2019 What it\nwas is actually is a handle made out of leather, hard leather, at end of which like a\nwhip. Actually was a hard, metal ball with points on it. Standing behind me he was\nhitting me from the front so it was injured, my face actually standing behind me. And\nI have a little scar and I... until today I am impaired vision in left eye ... was bleeding\nfrom the eye. But I couldn't go to a doctor of course. I will stay like this until two\ndays later until finally, when finally the ghetto was liquidated and I escape again.\nWith Lucine, my future wife and her little brother under a barbed wire, and you know\nthe story then that we were hiding in the bishop palace, which I mentioned before,\nthen went to my father's friend who hid us in a warehouse. Then Lucine went to\nWarsaw to secure some papers for us. Then she come back. We had the papers all\ntogether but no money. Lucine remembered her parents left some jewelry and silver,\na candelabra with a neighbor and a friend who lived in the same house. So we went to\nher and Lucine approached her. Would you mind at least give us one candelabra so\nwe can sell it, maybe find a way to Warsaw so -- and if we don't survive, whatever\nelse my family gave you is yours. She said, well, but, you know, I don't have it in my\nhome everything. Is hidden in the attic and I cannot go to the attic tonight because the\nneighbors would be very suspicious, what am I doing in the attic. But come tomorrow\nand I will prepare everything for you. I will wrap it so people won't know what it is.\nCome back tomorrow at two o'clock. Having a suspicious mind, and you felt a certain\nextra instinct, like a hunted animal, I just felt maybe the whole thing sounded fishy.\nInstead of coming two o'clock, we approached the area about noon time, 12:30. Now,\n*peitche: whip.\nwe're locating ourself across the street from the main entrance to the building that the\nlady lived, and this area was bombed out, lot of ruins, you know. You could hide very\neasily there, and behind us was a little street and a small apartment like a street\napartment.\nActually, that my colleague from high school lived there. His father was a shoemaker.\nI was tempted to go there, now stay there maybe and watch the house, but then I\ndidn't want to expose them to this kind of danger either. So I decided to wait on the\nstreet behind the ruin, and sure enough about one o'clock we see two police cars\npulling over to the curb of the house and two or four Gestapo people got out of the\ncars and rushed up stairs. Within about 15, 20 minutes they came out and they split.\nTwo people went one way, the other two people went the other way, looking for us. I\nassume they meant us. We didn't wait too long there. We knew she had denounced us\nto the Gestapo because of a silver candelabra. And I just remember now talking about\nJudas sold Jesus and the situation was so analogous to it, you know. But anyway, we\ndidn't know what to do so we run into my friend's house. The parents recognized me\nright away, what happened? I told them what happened very briefly and shortly.\nGestapo looking for us. What going to do? And she very, old lady, you take your coat\noff. Here, take your shoe off and start putting nails in your shoe, in my heel. She gave\na apron to my wife and she was cooking something on the iron stove. Said, you\npretend you cooking dinner right now and your little brother, put him to bed. He's\nasleep. Now we'll cover him up with blankets. There was a curtain separating a one\nroom apartment, a curtain separating the one bed area from the work place and the\nkitchen, and this old lady took a blanket outside, start dusting the blanket, calmly,\nquietly. All of a sudden, two people approach her. Did you see Jews here? So she\npretended. Jews here? There no Jews here. They all dead. There not nobody here.\nWhose house is that? My house. My father's working here. My husband's client 1s\nhere and my daughter is there. She cooking right now, dinner, and they walked inside\nto see. Didn't ask for the paper, although we did have documents, false. They looked\nlike they didn't believe they would be fresh enough to be so blatantly, you know, or\nstupid or to stay right near the scene of a crime. And they left the house and start\nlooking for us again. Of course, we didn't wait too much longer. We took off. That's\nwhen we went back to the warehouse the same night we took that horse and buggy\ntype of thing to the near railroad station near Lublin.\nWell, going back to the ghetto area. So, we lived in one little room and from there I\nhad to go on to work detail. Each morning a group of maybe 40, 50 people gathered\nin the ghetto area with a leader. The leader was a friend of my father, and with him\nwe're going to the railroad station over there. We're unloading cars. They didn't beat\nus there but didn't pay us either. Didn't feed us either. The only pay off was I could\ntake as much coal as I could carry on my back as my payment for days work. So I of\ncourse, I put as much coal as I could. I was bent over on all fours practically, carrying\nthe big sack of coal back to the ghetto. It was cold but we couldn't afford to heat our\napartment because this was all our food depend on the coal. I was carrying to the\nthird story with some the richer, older Jews you know. We were buying the coal.\nWith the money we collected for the coal we could buy some food. We lived on\ncarrots, cabbage, turnip from which, of course, we got diarrheas. We were sick,\nstomachaches. There was no bread. We couldn't afford any bread. There was nothing,\nnothing cooked. There was nothing to cook. And on one of my trips I notice a\nfamiliar face in a uniform of a Polish railroad man and I thought, I know this face.\nAnd as I said before, you develop a certain instinct. You just aware of your\nsurroundings. Who is around there. Who, is he a friend or an enemy? And finally I\napproach him. I start working the area he was standing. I said do I know you? Aren't\nyou from Lublin. He looks at me. He said, who are you? I said my name, it is Horn\nfrom Lublin. He said, yes. Don't show any emotion. I know you, yes, I am so and so.\nHis name was Lowloc Rice (ph). I said, I know, I thought that was you. He said,\npretend we don't know each other, and let's not talk to long. What are you doing here?\nI said I wanted to get out. What can I do to get out? So he said, why don't you come\ntomorrow again same time and we talk in details. I can't talk to you now right now. I\ncouldn't wait. I came back to the ghetto with my sack of coal. Next day early in the\nmorning went back to work in the detail group and sure enough he was there. And he\nsaid, I can get you out of the ghetto but it cost a lot of money. I said, I don't have no\nmoney but, you know what before I left the ghetto in Lublin, my father show me a\nspot in his shop that he buried a case.\nIt's a steel case with jewelry, gold, watches, bracelets, my family's jewelry, and one of\nour friends who was a jeweler. Whoever survivor the war, if ever then you can live\nthe rest of your life on it. I remember that spot. That's the only thing I know. I hope\nit's still there, but I cannot give guarantees. But I know this spot. If you were willing\nto talk to your people and they are willing to take a chance, whatever we will find,\nhalf is theirs. I need only a little bit to survive. You can take more than half. I will\nleave it up to you, how much you want. How much you leave to us. He said, let me\ntalk to my people. I said, who are your people? Well, I can tell you that that's Polish\nUnderground, Armia Krajowa, or Home Army. They need money to buy ammunition,\narms, etcetera. I don't know if they will go for this kind of deal because it is\ncomplicated, but if they will, I'll let you know. I will be here in a day or two. But I\ndon't know what day, but I'll find you. So I was coming to work every day with the\nhope, my dreams kind of encouraged, maybe he'll find him. Maybe is something work\nout. Otherwise, I see the doom. Sure enough, one day he's there, again same spot in\nthe uniform. He said, I talk to my people. They went for it, and on such and such a\nday you lead off. Your leader of your group is part of us. He part of us, our group too.\nHe knows all about it. So you will be snatched too. Make sure your wife goes to work\ntoo and her little brother too. Children were going to work too. No one question\nanything. And sure enough, at that given early in the morning by carrying a sack of\ncoal to the side, we're snatched by a group of people from the Polish Underground\nwaiting with a car, and then a streetcar. We change streetcars to different streetcar\nand people were changing to our guards. Our guards were changing. They all armed\nin case they caught us there would be a fight. And we arrived to a house, to an\napartment house which one of the -- not headquarters but one the apartments were the\nPolish Home Army was meeting was meeting there.\nI was surprised. We found maybe 10 or 12 Jewish people there, hiding. I found out\nthat he is helping lot of Jewish people. I looked at it and I met this man. I asked him\nwhy do you do that. The first man I seen so definitely show the effort and the risk to\nhelp the Jewish people. Why? You like the Jews? He said, no I don't. So why do you\ndo that? Well, I show you. He took me another room. Now listen to it. And I listened.\nThere were noises over the wall, people talking Yiddish, arguing and fighting with\neach other. He said, what kind of people are you? I'm risking my life and here they\nstart I fighting about, they fighting about stupid things and the neighbors they hear\nthose things. They denounce it and we're all dead. I never see people in danger who\ndo this kind of thing. I don't respect your people. I have no answer to it. What can I\nsay. They're old orthodox people. For some reason they felt they should continue\ntheir orthodoxy, their sacred needs. They want kosher food. You know, where you\ngoing to get kosher food there? One of the men died, older man died, but he was very\nreligious. What the Home Army did, they put him in a an orthodox kind of a canvas\nsack. That's how the Jews are buried you know. Not in the coffins, and they threw\nhim over the wall in the Jewish cemetery. They didn't bury him there and but left him\nthere in the Jewish cemetery. And I think this was more than anybody could expect.\nBut this was just one the examples what those people did for us. And, they described\nthe whole plan what we're going to do. First thing, I got the papers as a railroad man\nand they give me a uniform with a cap, a jacket, slacks, you know, the typical railroad\nuniform, with documents employed by railroads in Warsaw. And he said, you going\nto go with a group of few people. One is a Volkes Deutch and I don't follow, Volkes\nDeutch is a German who lived in Poland for generations, but he still did not lose his\nGerman identity. He could be Polish patriot. And this was, one was by your German.\nHe was just an excuse to get all the country German Army. He knew where they are\nand he had a special privileges as a German citizen really, and he pretend to be\nalways humiliated by the Poles and so on. So it's special right and privileges.\nHe was our protector on the trip on the rail to Lublin with guarded by two Polish\nUnderground people, armed all the time. We arrived at the scene and sure enough, the\nlocation used to be a shack was a street now. The shack was raised. To explain a little\nbit yet more about the situation, Lublin was at site where the Jewish POWs from the\nPolish, from the former Polish Army where stationed there, and they were doing the\ndirty work for the Germans. They were digging in the ghetto. They are leveling the\nghetto. They were removing the door-frames, the window-frames, the door, the\nhinges, where the Jews were hiding gold and coins, and jewelry, diamonds,\neverything they could. And they were taking everything apart piece by piece, and\nthey leveled that hut, the little shack. There was nothing ... but I seen the spot. I knew\nthe spot right way. And I said, I'm going to stand up on that spot. That's where it is.\nBut he said, that's a street now. He said, well, okay. We'll come back tomorrow and\nwe left. He took me to one of the people home. I stay overnight. They fed me. They\ntreated me nicely, and next day they took me back to same location. What do I see?\nThe whole street is blocked off, detour. The signs of detour. Broad daylight. A tent is\nerected middle of the street and the a sign, and A big roll of cable standing next to the\ntent, the German Post Office and telegraph. And people, helmets and overcoats are\ndigging in the middle of the street right where this thing is, the understand was when\nthey find the case that I described. They lit a torch and this was a sign that they found\nit. Now, I was hiding across the street and behind a door there was a little window\nthere. There were people passing. It was a big apartment house and I was standing\nthere, and looking through a little window there and watching if they lit the torch.\nWhen this was torch be lit, this was a sign for me to get out and mean they got the\ncase and they won't need me no more. They will take me away and we'll go back\nhome and, I am of course, I'm standing there, very nervous, very upset. Don't forget,\nthis my hometown. I could run into somebody I knew, somebody knew me, and this\nwould be the end of it. But I was guarded people with arms, you know, so I knew it\nwouldn't be easy for anybody, so they told me not to worry about it.\nIf this happen that Poles recognize me they will fix him right away. Germans don't\nenter this area anyway. They were not concerned at all, but I was nervous and maybe\ntook about two, two and a half hours, I see them stopping working and one of them\nreaching down and then straightening out and taking a torch and lighting a torch. And\nI was sweating and I thought that was a sign. I was coming out right into the middle\nof the street and here is the case opened up, completely empty, open up empty. I don't\nknow what to say, but at least I knew this was true. They knew that I didn't lie to\nthem. But where's the gold? Where's all the goodies? We found out later on that the\nJewish POWs were digging everywhere and they opened this thing and left the empty\ncase there and closed it up. They didn't report to the Germans cause the same day,\nunderstand, people are selling watches in the camps of the POWs. Watches and gold\nthey were selling everywhere. Well, this was the end of our trip and I knew we were\ngoing back to the ghetto because they did not receive what they are supposed to get.\nOn the way back home on the train we talked about it. We had one compartment.\nThere was no other people there and I said, well, obviously we cannot afford to be out\nof the ghetto. We cannot pay you people. I want you to understanding that I didn't lie\nto you about it. Yes, we know that. You going to send me back to the ghetto? He said\nno. Why? What would you do in the ghetto? You would perish in the ghetto. Maybe\nyou can help us here on this side. You can work for your upkeep. We'll discuss the\ndetail and come home. So we turn back to Warsaw. And you know the rest of the\nstory. That important fact I omitted that we got married in Warsaw Ghetto and my\nwife, with the help of the Polish Underground got us a little apartment, one little\nroom. I was hiding there. I did go to a hiding place in the washroom, boarding up the\nwalls of the washroom and creating a hiding door. When you lifted the boards of the\nwall was a secret door that you open up, and behind the door was a little hiding place\naccommodating maybe eight or nine people. I built a little bed so we could lie there\nand so on. Now this part of the building was totally destroyed during the bombing of\nWarsaw, so there was a way we could have run away from this hiding place any case\nof a danger, if someone entered the front of the apartment, with a signal which was\ndissident in the beginning. In case any danger, Lucine would knock on the door\ntwice, and we would know to run. We did have an emergency address where to go,\nanother hiding place through the Home Army, hiding Jews in case of different\nlocation. In case of emergency we could find a spot there until situation would clear\nup. And sure enough one day the janitor became suspicious because Lucine was\nbringing too much food in her little basket and he thought two women living in that\napartment, and she bringing food galore, and he notified the Polish police. One day\nwhen she came in from work -- and what kind of work she was doing. She was selling\nwomen\u2019s nets on the market, flea market and so on. Nobody knew she was Jewish, of\ncourse. She had good looks as an Aryan person. She seen policeman at the door. She\ndidn't want to go in so she went to a store in the same building, grocery store. First\nthing she did was took the key out of her purse. She drop the key in a sack of beans\nand while doing this the policeman entered the store and arrested her. They when\nthrough her purse and ask her where her key. Oh, I guess I lost it. They look on the\nstreet everywhere, they couldn't find it. Which is your apartment? What do you want?\nWhat do you want? We understand you are hiding Jews. You are accused by the\njanitor that you bring too much food for two people there. We want to see your\napartment. This conversation was very loud going on while they entering the\napartment on the third floor, and on stairway we could hear the steps of the boots and\nthe noise and the argumentation. And then my wife said, there 1s nobody there unless\nmy aunt is. She working too. She 1s not home yet but let me knock on the door. She\nknocked twice which was danger signal. And we also had some rabbits in the\napartment, just in case some neighbors hear some footsteps, we can always say the\nrabbits walking around. And they could hear some noise in there. Is there somebody\nin there? Well, maybe the rabbits. So they broke down the door. They look over.\nThey went to the washroom. They did not discover our hiding place at all, although\nwe are not there no more. They seen the rabbits and said, what are you talking about.\nAnd they left, but they took per purse with her, took her documents with them and\nshe stayed without any papers which was like a death sentence.\nShe discussed this thing with our friends from the Polish Home Army, and they\nsuggested that one of them would go with her to get a copy of it. And she went to the\noffice. Behind was a gentlemen armed just in case. Without any difficulty she got a\ncopy of ID and she left, no problem. During one of the trips on the streetcar they stole\nher purse again. She lost the documents again. Same history repeat itself. She went\nback there and got ID, no problem. I had to occasionally had to run from place to\nplace and I did need ID too, so the Home Army organized arranged for me to go with\nthem to the main office there with my real birth certificate of a person that passed\naway, young man was two years younger than I really was. His name was Wojick\n(ph), Felix Wojick. So I assumed his identity. So this birth certificate, I entered the\nmain office and I received a ID without any difficulty whatsoever, with two guards\nbehind me. No one suspected anything and now I was equipped with real documents,\nand they could check it I was registered everywhere and I was not a Jew anymore.\nBut I had more Semitic looks than Lucine and with a man you know, it was not\ndifficult to suspect something, stop him, put him aside, and take his pants down and\nknow who we are. Because only Jewish man was circumcised and this was the danger\nspot, but I tried to avoid situation like this. So Lucine was working for the Polish\nUnderground actually, indirectly, and all the hiding Jews were doing the same thing.\nThey were taught how to make woman's hair nets. It was a fashionable thing at that\ntime to do. They were taking the car inner-tubes or truck inner-tubes and cutting into\nsmall strips, very narrow strips. Then they could buy white silk and then they are\ndying the silk different colors. Was it a gold, gray, brown or black or navy blue. So\nmaking any net color you desire with the orders they receive. So I was taught by the\ngroup how to wrap this little string of rubber with a silk. So I was making the elastic,\nactually. The other group people were making the nets themself by hand of course.\nAnd somebody design a little cardboard paper how to wrap it around and look very\nprofessionally. And Lucine, as having good Aryan looks with another lady, also\nJewish person, good looks. They were spreading all over the city, market places and\nflea markets etcetera, and our life was more or less stable from then on except I was\nlike a prisoner in my own house which I readily assumed and took. I was taught how\nto do those things and finally our benefactor said, why do you start doing these too\nand do it on the side and Lucine can sell for you too. So be it. We did. We started to\naccumulated a little money. We felt a little more comfortable. We were not that poor\nno more.",
        "Q: Was Lucine's brother still living with you then or is this after. What was it like hiding\nwith him in that little cubicle?",
        "A: It was very pathetic. He was little boy. He was like a prisoner. It was hard for him to\nunderstand why he was hiding. He knew he was Jewish. He knew he could not show\nhis face although he had good Aryan looks, but as a kid they could pull his pants\ndown, they know who he ts. So was a sad thing to look at, him to be in hiding all the\ntime. He was pale. He was deprived of the sunlight, sunshine. He couldn't play. I tried\nto be very near him, put arms around him. He miss his parents. He was at the age he\nunderstood. He lost his parents and you couldn't replace it, of course. There were\ntimes that he was questioning, asking if he ever going to see them again and so on. He\nwas still a child and on the other hand he was a grown-up, above his age. The\npolitical situation just forced the people to grow up very fast. So he was aware of\nwhat really the score is and on the other hand, he was only eight or nine years old you\nknow. I couldn't replace his father. I was not old enough to act like a father, but I tried\nto do best I could. I try to be the disciplinarian. Sometimes he want to do certain\nthings he want to do and so I say you cannot do it and I had to be firm. And he tell,\nme you're not my father. I said, I know. I don't pretend to father. But you cannot do it\nbecause all of us would be in danger, you including. So it was a very tragic thing to\nsee him going through all this thing.\nI did not mention that during one of those days that we were together, that we seen,\nwhen we run away from the apartment that the policemen arrested Lucine we went to\nemergency hiding place. That's the time that Lucine run to one of her friends, who\nturned out to be the mistress one of the German Gestapo man. She knew she was\nJewish. She said, what you doing here? She was afraid to tell anything, because we\ndidn't know -- Lucine didn't know who she is now. Is she pro Gestapo or is she going\nto tell everything where we are and then Gestapo come arrest us all. But she finally\ntold her, look, I am doing this because I am desperate myself to save my life you\nknow. But you know I remember your parents. I can help you maybe. So she, Lucine,\ntold her the whole story that the problem now is we don't have apartment anymore.\nWe stay only a few days. We didn't know what to do. Next we have brothers with us\nand she said, you know, what this was is this Hotel Polski, Polish hotel, that the\nGermans with a lot of money taking people and they go to southern France. The\nletters arrive from those people who went on transport to southern France, writing\nback to their relatives in Warsaw. Right at the sea, sunning ourself. Life is different.\nWe waiting for visas to go to South America to North America, to the United States\nand I hope you can join us. And Lucine seen those letters and they are truly letters,\nexcept that these people didn't realize this whole thing was a trick. When we wanted\nto register they said, well, the next transport not going to a week later, but this time it\nwas totally full but if you come up with like $5,000 actually, and we didn't have this\nkind of money. So talking to her friend we said, we cannot afford this kind of thing.\nWe want to go. She said but, you know what, your little brother can take with you for\nnothing, but you have to come up with money. So we said we have no money. So she\npromised to take her little boy with her, and on given day through, going through\ncertain stages of hiding and before reaching that hotel because you went in there was\nonly Jewish people going in and who was going out, only Jewish people. You didn't\nknow if Gestapo waiting outside or not so it was a tricky thing to get in and get out of\nthis hotel and one day we delivered the little boy to this young lady who was very\nnice, and took him under her protection on that trip to so called paradise, southern\nFrance. We did receive one postcard from a train in Germany someplace that\neverything fine from him. It was his writing.\nBut did he really write what he meant? Was he forced to write it? We don't know, but\nthis was the last thing we ever heard. The final thing what we heard actually after of\nthe war, that the whole train went to Northern Germany near Hannover someplace to\na concentration camp and they were all eliminated. So, the whole thing was a stage, a\nplot from the Germans who knew that some Jews were hiding and they paying for the\nsafety to Polish people, but some running out of money so they had to sooner or later\nget out. So they have some money left they could bribe their way by paying to go on\ntransport to Southern France. Unfortunately, we couldn't go. We had no money, not\nthat kind of money. So we stayed without her little brother and we assumed the worst\nbecause we didn't hear nothing for months to come. We suspected he probably\nperished, but for sure we didn't know at that time. Life was going on and Lucine was\nselling her hair nets. I making the hair net and off and on we lost our hiding place due\nto some suspicions that we had, maybe unfounded, but you couldn't take a chance. So\nwe jumped from one place to another one, always in contact with other hiding Jews,\nand they had our name and addresses and we had theirs in case their apartment was\nsuspected of being not in order they run to us. And one day one of her schooling\ngirlfriends notify Lucine that her apartment is no good and her husband 1s going to go\nto Polish Partisan, but he has to wait a few days and needs shelter. So we took him to\nour house, our apartment. He slept to with us, one bed, all three of us. And two days\nlater he left us and went to Polish Underground. I understand he perished there and\nhis wife perished too. So we one day we looking again for another apartment. This\nwas a constant situation every few months we looking for another apartment because\npeople are not stupid and they suspect something and if unfounded even, they might\nsuspect it and you can't take a chance. They might call the police or so. One day she\nmet a lady who was a nanny to one of her Jewish boyfriends when she was little yet,\nand she knew that the lady recognize her already. And they hug and kiss and so and\nshe was a widow. They was peddling some ham, bacon, you know, from store to\nstore. She had one room apartment, little kitchenette, that's all. Lucine told her we're\nwithout apartment. She said, why you don't come to me?\nShe said yea, but, you know who we are? Oh, yes, I know who you are. You know\nwhat we doing? Oh yes I know what your doing but, I have to be paid for it. We have\nlittle money. What will this cost us? Normally reasonable cost us about 50 to 100\nZlotys per month, and I don't remember. I think we paid her 5 or 600 Zlotys. I'm not\nsure exactly the amount. That's what she requested. She was very happy to get that\nkind of money. She was struggling economically. So we moved in. Move in, we\ndidn't have nothing to move in with. A coat, a jacket, a pair of shoes, and I move my\nlittle factory with me. I was making those little hair nets, producing. Lucine was\nselling it. Now, we have to think about safety. I don't flush the toilet because both\nladies, Lucine and this house-lady, were working so I couldn't walk around. I couldn't\nflush the toilet. I waiting until they came back home not to create suspicious. Floors\nwere wooden. You afraid to put your weight down because the floors were squeaking.\nBe very, very, careful. I used to walk on the board next to the wall where the floor\nwas more solid and the planks wooden floor planks were not as flexible so without\ncreating a noise. Then this was in the corner of the room, there was a ceramic heater.\nI don't if you're familiar with European heating system. It's made out of ceramic tiles,\nsquares up to the ceiling almost, and connected to the chimney, and you were heating\nwith coal there. There was a little door, metal door you put your wood or coal this\nwas. Well, I decided to do to hollow out that stove. I disassemble the whole stove.\nLucine would bring me clay each day, a little bit in a bag, a little bag. I use a fork and\na knife to disassemble without cracking the tiles. Don't forget this was old stove, and\nfrom the base on I rebuild the whole stove using clay and water. And I remove the\ntop, the surface, the ceramic tile and I made a wooden planking and put the tile on top\nof the wooden planking so I would get cover. But you have to heat it so what are you\ngoing to do. So we bought a little iron stove with a pipe. The pipe was going right in\nthe middle of the stove into the chimney. There was a little stool and a table next to\nthe stove in case of emergency. I could step on the stool on the table inside the stove.\nI was sitting like on horseback on the pipe. Only thing I forgot not being professional,\nwhat am I going to do if the pipe 1s going to be hot because the stove is being used for\ncooking?\nDidn't think about it and I didn't think about the possible gases emanating from this\ncontraption. I was not a scientist. I'm not a professional bricklayer or stove layer,\nwhatever. But it served purpose and I hope I would never have to use it. All of a\nsudden one day we find out that the landlady had a cousin in the village near Warsaw,\nwho one day came in drunk, total drunk, and when he knocked at the door, I had only\nmaybe a minute time to get into the stove. I got in the stove. He came in. They tried\nto get rid of him, he was so drunk they couldn't. Oh, no. I stay here overnight. I go\nhome tomorrow. So I stayed in the stove all night. When he left following morning, I\nwas totally unconscious, overcome by fumes. They couldn't call a doctor. They\ncouldn't pull me out because very awkward, was way up top to the ceiling. They were\ntwo women, one old lady. Lucine was young but alone she couldn't do. I was a\nheavyweight person and I started moving a little bit, but I was semiconscious and I\ngot out of that stove and they try to breathe in my mouth, artificial respiration,\nspringing water, splashing water on me, and so on, and I come to it and I recovered.\nThis was my first experience in hiding place like this. The other experience, I had,\nanother cousin, a woman came one day with a little poodle or a dog, small dog. I had\nno time to get to the stove. There was a cabinet against the wall so I hid in cabinet\nbehind coats and so on. All of a sudden, that little poodle start barking, coming\ntoward the cabinet and barking and barking and barking. Didn't want to leave, and\nthis cousin of this house-lady said, what are you barking? What do you see in that\ncabinet? Oh, I probably have a little ham there. I'm peddling ham, and so on. He\nprobably want this. So she brought a piece of ham to the dog, give him the ham and\nhe ate it and stopped barking. And there were few episodes like this where I was\nhiding. But each time I escape without any problems. Until one day our benefactor\nfrom the Home Army came to me and said to me, be prepared because the Polish\nUnderground is staging an uprising. In the meantime, prior to this of course, we're\nlocated next to the former ghetto. We see the ghetto burning.\nWe see people dancing and 1s laughing outside the ghetto walls saying the Jewish bed\nbugs are frying. Finally, we got rid of them and so on, you know. I didn't hear it\nmyself. I just heard the noise. I heard the explosions in the ghetto. This was the\nJewish uprising and we didn't hear no cries. Nothing, just explosions, shots, and then\nthe fire and eventually of course, after almost what? Less than a month, the whole\nghetto uprising, went under and the Germans sealed up the area and there was no\nmore ghetto. Then our captain came and said you better start storing some food\nbecause there is going to be uprising Warsaw proper. We don't be able to get anything\nat all. If you have any money left, any savings or so, buy something for it because the\nmoney will be worth nothing. Prior to this, he came to us once and he took a loan\nfrom us. He needed money to transport some Jewish people. He had no money to\nsave them. So he was selling whatever he could, his own things to pay for the upkeep\nof those people. We gave him the money. He returned the money to us eventually. So\nLucine bought some rings that's all you could buy in the jeweler stores. You couldn't\nbuy nothing else but wedding rings. We ended up with several, maybe 10 or 11 rings\nwhich we could not get rid of afterwards. After the war they are worth practically\nnothing. The uprising started. Our Polish captain said, I want you to be part of our\ngroup. We won't ask you to fight directly for us, it's not your fight. I said, your fight is\nmy fight. You saved my life. Whatever you want me to do, I will do. We need\nsomebody to attack the German warehouses to steal the provisions, food for our\nsoldiers and so on. It's under fire. And, I agreed to it immediately, and at night we're a\ngroup of five, six people from the Home Army ,Underground don't forget the\nbasements were connected to each house next to each other. They cut through the\nwalls of each house so we did not have to be on the surface, which was deadly, but\nunderground we moving the whole underground city. We moving from one end of\nWarsaw to the other end underground. And that's how we knew which was the exit\nwhere to go, where the warehouses were and when we grabbed the supplies, what we\ncould of course, we didn't have no transportation. All on our backs, you know, and\npockets, pants, hands, you tied to your belt, whatever you could.\nWe disappear in the underground. The German looking for us and couldn't find us.\nWe disappear. Then that's how we brought the supplies for the fighting boys you\nknow. Then the Germans seen that the uprising 1s continuing and decided to do more\ndrastic type of move and they decided to bomb the city. In the meantime, the political\nsituation change all bad. We already knew that the Soviet troops on the other side of\nWisla River, which the eastern part of Warsaw.\u2019 The name is Prague, like city of\nPrague in Czechoslovakia. People were hiding there that were liberated. We on the\nwestern part were not liberated yet. Some Jews thought that in case they have to die\nnow they try to swim through the Wisla River on the other side going east, and they\ncaught by the German fire of course. Some of them try to support themself with their\nhands under the bridge, holding on to different pipes and cables, only holding on with\ntheir hands cross the bridge underneath to reach the other side, and some of them\nsucceeded. Some of our friends did succeeded to do that. It requires a tremendous\nphysical strength to do that unless you accustomed to it. And many people\nundernourished and weak and so on couldn't do it. Even swimming through the Wisla\nRiver in the part of Warsaw which was pretty wide and deep was suicidal, so we\nwouldn't dare. So we took our fate the way it is. So the German troops start to\nbombing the city and they done it systematically, street after street, so we knew\nwhich street bomb today, so we knew which street would be bombed tomorrow. So\nrunning from one type of a block to another block, but the bombing caught up with us\nfinally. We are at our home, our home, our apartment that we stay with the Polish\nlady which I mentioned before selling ham and etcetera, etcetera. The bomb hit one\nof our wings and the whole stairway collapsed. Lucine was upstairs. She went right\nonto the main floor under the rubble. I couldn't get to the other side to save her so I\ntook a plank, a wide plank, maybe a foot wide. It was a corner wing and so I put one\nend of the plank on the window frame, the other plank was four story and the other\nwindow, and all my fours I crossed from one wing to the other one, not looking\ndown. Because if I look down I probably get dizzy and go down, and I was able to\nreach her area and recover her by pulling her.\nI see her legs sticking out and by pulling her, debris and bricks and cement and piece\nof wood and so on. She sustained fairly intensive injury and her whole right side of\nthe face, ear, neck, chest, breast, right side of abdomen, was scraped from falling\ndebris and so on. Bleeding so on, I was wounded in the mean time. I don't know what\nfrom. It was a piece of shrapnel I thought. My abdomen, I was bleeding a little bit but\nI felt good otherwise. I put her on my back and carried her on my back to the first aid\nstation. There were signs in the city where the first aid station don't forget it was our\n*Wisla River: Vistula River.\narea, the Polish Home Army not the German area yet, and I found my way to what\nthey say is the lazarett.\u00b0 The lazarett and the first aid with the red cross on it. I bring\nher on my back. I crawl in practically through the door and whom do I find is a\ndoctor. I almost fainted. Then with together with Lucine on my back, my classmate\nwho was my partner in crime and was supposed to be executed by firing squad, he\nwas hiding in Warsaw. He finished his medical school underground. He just\nwhispered to me, we don't know each other, and that was all, I was the only one.\nLucine was the only one who get tetanus shot. There was not tetanus for nobody. She\nwas the only one who received it. They tended her wounds and so on. Squeeze my\nhands and couldn't hug and kiss each other and just wish each other best of luck and\nwe left. And after several weeks, few weeks, I think about a month, the uprising went\ndown under. German triumphed and they announced loudspeakers, all the inhabitants\nof Warsaw now going to be evacuated to a camp near Warsaw by foot. We walked\nseveral kilometers by foot to a little town name Pruszkow.\nI was wearing my uniform, had my bandages on. Lucine had bandages on and at that\ntime nobody suspected any Jews left, and we approaching the camp we see a doctor\nthere and several nurses. Lucine thought they were nuns. They were not nuns. They\nwere nurse and I told them I am a medical student and one of the doctor said \"go to\nthe right, go to the right.\" This was the building -- I forgot the number of the building.\nWe didn't know where to go to right or not. The first intuition was maybe we\nshouldn't, but why would he steer us wrong. He 1s not working for the Poles, not for\nGermany. As we found a lot of older people meantime getting out of one barrack to\nanother one, and we see an older lady, old lady on a stretcher lying there, moaning,\nand no one was there. So I grab another guy. Why don't you help me get this lady to\nthe barracks, and we carry the lady that behind us and they thought that we're part of\nthe troop over there caring for the sick and disabled, etcetera. We came to there\nbarrack and we see a lot of elderly people, sick people and so on. And at this time I\nwonder if we made the right decision cause we know from the ghetto days yet, sick\nand disabled people are garbage. They going to be destroyed. Why didn't they put us\nwith the younger people? We young people, young really. Younger people just go to\nGermany to work, but this was no way out. There a guard at the door. If you want to\nget out, even go to the washroom or something, there some containers and the women\nand men together.\nEnd of Tape #2\n\u2018lazarett: (German). Hospital or clinic.\nTape #3",
        "A: So we looking around the barracks and seeing all the older people we don't know\nwhat we're doing there actually. And a thought went through our minds, and maybe\nthis a group of peoples going to go for final resolutions of their problems. Probably\nAuschwitz or so, and then after two or three nights staying on straw mats on the floor,\nyou lying down one night, you woke up the next night about three feet away because\nthe straw mats were moving. That's how people were talking about, lice, horrible\nsituation there, and they one morning they decided to let us out the of the barracks\nand direct us toward the railroad track where open cars, cattle cars. While to me this\nwas nothing new. I read it very well and I knew what's happening now. First thought\nwas, we probably going to go to Auschwitz or one of those places. But the young\npeople think maybe this get to Germany for work. But the old people, sick people,\npeople on stretchers and so on that's what they do with us. They seal the cars, but\nthrough the upper little windows they actually wired type of upper portion. The car\nwere wired. You could see through and standing on somebody's shoulders you could\nsee outside. I seen there were only two guards, soldiers or what ever, Gestapo I'm not\nsure who they were. One near the locomotive, the beginning of the train and one at\nthe end. This was not really clear to me what the purpose of this transport. Where are\nwe going? Nobody knew. Everybody was asking the same question. People were\nsquashed like cattle, you know. About maybe close to 100 people in the car. Woman,\nman, there were no toilet facilities of course, and people just relieving themselves the\nway they were, standing and so on. And everybody, you know, without any\nconcentration. The fear, you know, not knowing where we going. I was conditioned\nto it a little bit, and the other Poles weren't. The rest the Poles weren't, so that's the\nfirst experience they had. So I was kind of over hand but the final destination was still\nthe same. So what am I going to win here? We going to go together as a Pole maybe,\nbut still. All of a sudden one night one very important railroad stations.\nThe place was bombed by allies. They destroyed the railroad lengths you know, and\nthe train couldn't go any further. This detained us for about two or three days until\nthey repaired the tracks. And to say there were no food given, no water given, there\nwere no people outside. There was nothing and then the car start rolling again and\nafter unknown number of days, we are arrived in a little town. The name was\nJedrzejow a town with maybe 8, 10,000 people and all of a sudden the train stopped.\nThe car doors open up. Polish Red Cross appeared. Woman with band, red cross on it\nand they directing this car, this car going left, this car going straight, the other car\ngoing to the right and we found ourselves in front of many horse carriages, you know,\ndriven by the local peasants. And in front of the carriages there were tables and Polish\nwoman was sitting there registering everybody. They want your IDs. So you give\nIDs. I was in railroad uniform at this time. My wife was with me and registered, and\nshe assigned us to a certain village, to a peasant that was forced to take us as guests\nand to feed us and be responsible for us. And they let us go free. We didn't go in any\njail. We didn't go to any concentration camp. No one ever informed us what going to\nhappen, nothing until this moment. We're driven, by, it turn out later, by the mayor of\nthis little village to a different farmer. He brought us there, knocked at the door. Here\nthey are and he left. Of course, we speak very fluent and clean, very intelligent\nPolish. Peasant Polish 1s a little different Polish and they hate the city people you\nknow, and he told me right away in slang, \"I am not taking freeloaders to my house. I\ncannot afford you people.\" I said \"I was wounded. Lucine was wounded too, my wife,\nyou know.\" She was bandaged up. I said, but \"look, as soon as we feel better we\ngoing to help you. We help you on the farm.\" He said, \"I'm not going to take no\nbody.\" And, he shut the door. We standing there maybe, most of the day outside. It\nwas cold. Mind you this was already either end of October or so, beginning of\nNovember, it was cold, raining.\nWe hugged each other, standing, didn't know what to do. He refused to take us in and\nwe stayed like this way all night under the little roof, thinking what next. Early in the\nmorning, the mayor of the village appeared there. Allegedly, he knew that we were\nnot taken in by this farmer. He asked us to go with him. We didn't have no luggage\nwith us, of course. So we walked with him. He took us to the only building made out\nof brick. The rest were huts and he say, you stay in this house now, and the people\nwalked out, the farmer, middle age people. Maybe she was 40, 42, he was maybe 45,\nwith two little kids and very friendly invited us in. Knowing that we were wounded\nso they give us their own bedroom and bed so we can sleep and rest. She said she\nmaking chicken for me, chicken broth and so on and so on. Very, very friendly and\naccepting us, and feeling sorry for us probably. Well, at this moment I didn't care. I\njust wanted to lie down and rest. I didn't feel good. I was sick. I was weak. I was\nbleeding a little bit. All the turmoil and what was happening next and so on. I didn't\nlook beyond that moment. The same night I woke up with a light flashing in my face.\nWho are you? I thought maybe Gestapo. Right away you know you always live with\nthat fear it's always in your end. And here was a man said, I am from the underground\nfrom Home Army in this area, we heard that you people were from Warsaw, uprising\nfrom Warsaw, and we just want to tell you we very apologetic we couldn't come to\nyour help. You know, those days you couldn't take a train or trucks or cars to Warsaw\nto help the other groups of the Home Army you know but he said they couldn't do\nnothing for us and so on but they make sure not a hair on our head here in this village.\nAs a matter of fact, they hear about the other farm and they took care of him already.\nThey went that night before they came to us. They woke up the whole family, the\nfarmer refuse our entry asked him to strip completely from the waist down. Bent over\na trunk of a tree and so on they beat him up with some ... branches of trees and so on.\nThey were bleeding. They beat up the whole family. The farmer, his wife, his\ngrown-up sons and so on. The farmer beg us to return to his home, but we didn't\nknow. We didn't have nothing to do with them beating them up. But they aware that\nwe're from Warsaw uprising. They thought that we really some important people\nfrom the Home Army, which we're not. I was a small fish there, you know. But,\nanyway I was proud to be one of them and he said they make sure that if we need a\ndoctor they provide medical me care and so on and nothing would happen to us. And\nbelieve me our care was the best care any hospital could give us and after I got a little\nbetter, I got worse again and I got sick with high fever and yellow jaundice. My\nnights were horrible. I didn't know what I was talking about. Lucine said I was\ntalking nonsense through my sleep and so on. They were scared I might die,\ntemperature 103, 104, yellow jaundice, you know. Finally, the farmer said I take you\nto the doctor, I'm sorry. Can't let you dies like this. So he took his two horses, you\nknow, and his wagon, you know, and took me to nearest town. There was Polish\ndoctor there. This town was about 15 or 20 kilometers away. In the meantime, Lucine\nwas very, she recovered faster than I did. and she was very helpful in the farmhouse.\nShe was helping with chickens and cooking and peeling potatoes and bringing in\nwater and whatever was necessary and feeding the pigs, you know. And they liked it\nvery much because they, we didn't have to be paid for it. You know, they just\nsupported us. And they were very grateful for this. It showed the way they treated us.\nAnd I was just a victim of this. I was in no shape to do any of it. And I went to this\ndoctor, was on the second floor. I remember like today they had to practically carry\nme upstairs. I couldn't walk straight. There was a little waiting room. There was no\none in the waiting room, but I had to wait. To my left was a little table. On the little\ntable was a little box, looked like from medical instrument something. I glance at the\nbox. There was a label on it. Dr. Grayefski (ph) Praga, Warsaw. Just I notice this\nthat's all. I was still in my uniform. That's the only clothes I had. Finally the door\nopens up. The nurse calls me in, said Mr. Woyick? I said, yes. And she asked me my\nhistory, what happened to me and so on. So I told her the whole story about Warsaw\nuprising, my wounds. my wife being hurt and so on, I thought maybe a results of this\nresult of my wounds, you know.\n06:12:\nSo they wrote everything down. The doctor comes in and he said what's your name?\nAnd I said Wojick. He looks at my uniform. Where you from? I said, Warsaw. Are\nyou a railroad man? I said, yes. Which division, department? I said, we're Prague.\nYou must know me. I was your doctor of the railroad. So I look at him, look at him,\nlook at him. I said, \"you're not by any chance Dr. Grayefski?\" He said, of course I\nam. You know me. This name I memorize from this little box on the table. And from\nthen on was such a bond, such a contact, you know. I didn't worry about any\nsuspicions or so. He gave me a shot. I turned back, he gave me a shot. He didn't know\nwho was, nothing else. Gave me some vitamins, some medications and so on. I went\nback home and from then on I started my miraculous recovery. The people were nice\nto me. There were some other Warsaw refugees there, Polish refugees. One was a\nshoemaker and I felt very uneasy about him. For some reason he look at me all the\ntime and I was worrying if he maybe recognize me from somewhere or suspect who I\nam. And during Easter holidays he invited us, me and Lucine to his house. He was all\nalone. I think he was single, but he was middle age person. And we would talked. He\nask me questions, where I from and so on. Very inquisitive you know, which school I\nwent to. So I told him, Lublin. I told him the story. I told him all these things which\nwas true. My Polish misled everybody because my Polish was the best, if I brag about\nit, one thing, I brag my language. I speak several languages my Polish is exquisite. Is\nperfect, really perfect, literately Polish. They couldn't understand it because Jews\ndon't speak that kind of Polish. None of the Jews. So, but he never said nothing. He\nwas very cordial. Treated us, Polish sausage and this and then apologize he not a\ngood cook, but he done what he could. By being fellow from Warsaw and so on we\nhave something in common, he thought he invite us be the holidays with him. He\ndidn't want to be alone. And slowly I was recovering. Then I got the idea how could I\nrepay those peasants, for they're their ... being so good to us. And I thought since the\nschools were illegal and schools closed I would organize a secret Polish school. And I\nsuspected that mayor of the village was somebody that maybe I don't know exactly\nwho he was. He was more than just the mayor. And one day I approached him. I said,\nyou know what? I feel strong enough. I like to teach the children Polish language to\nread.\nLittle math, geography, whatever I can, and the political situation. Let them be aware\nof what was going on now. But I have no books. How we going to get books? The\narea we located was far away from our normal area where we used to live you know.\nI didn't know anyone there. o he said, \"well, I'll tell you. I'll give you a name. You can\ngo to next village.\" As a matter of fact, on Sunday I go to the town. Maybe I take you\nwith me, in the wagon, and then I don't know want to go with you, to this place, to\nthat person. Just tell them I send you and you tell them what you need. But I said I\ndon't have money either -- \"don't worry about that, just don't worry about that. Just\ntell him what need.\" I will straighten it out. And I met this person. He looked at me\nsuspicious look, asked for my IDs, my documents. Asked I was from Home Army. I\nsaid, yes, I was wounded during the uprising. So he had no reason to doubt me, which\nwas true. I didn't say who I was. He gave me about ten difference books. Polish\nreadings, simple arithmetics, art, crayons, all the pencils, all the little things, erasers.\nHere I am, educational director. I'm organizing a school. I took the kids together in\none house. I told them what we going to do and I told them we have to be smart about\nit because if the German find out that we have a secret school, they are going to burn\nthe village and we have to have a school. So we taught the kids that each day, one of\nthe kids, they were mostly boys if I remember, will stand guard outside on the top, on\nthe roof of the house. Our village was top of the hill so you can see the road down\nthere in the next town. If the Germans coming to the village, they had to come to this\nroad. So if you watch this road, you will find out who was coming to the village.\nThen you can take proper precautions. We told the kids if anything suspicious, right\naway they dispenses each one runs to his own house. Each one runs, takes the book\nwith him right away, there not be a trace left of any educational type material on the\ntables. And we conduct school very nicely with no problem, with no difficulty. Kids\nwere very nice. They obey. And one day during the classes, all of a sudden a door\nopens up and two men with hats, long gray leather coats, boots, typical Gestapo\ndetectives walk in. And right away ask me, \"Are you Mr. Wojick?\" Well, I don't have\nto tell you how I felt.\nI knew this was it, someone denounces me. You come with us. I was ready to faint.\nTry to regain my composure. Tried to ask him what it's all about. They said \"you go\nwith us.\" I walked out into the hallway, and they stopped. They start shaking my\nhand. We came in on orders of the Polish Government Exile who found out that\nsomeone is organizing a secret Polish education for the children, and we just want to\nthank you and congratulate you. We want to assure you that the end of the problem is\nsoon. The war is almost at the end. The Germans are losing the war. There was no\nnews. We don't know nothing. The Russian Army is advancing and they should be\nhere within weeks probably, and with this they left. Until today I don't know what\nhappened to that boy on the roof of the house, that he didn't detect the two men\nwalking in there. Could be Gestapo. Anyway, I was continuing teaching then all of a\nsudden we heard rumblings from the front nearby, the noise of the war. The\nexplosions and the artillery was getting louder, louder every day and of course, our\nhope was building up each minute. But the awareness that we could lose our lives, the\nend, the last hour of life was still with me. And I decided one day one of the sons of\nthe neighbor came in. Was a member of the Polish Underground but a different\nunderground what they used to call the N.S.Z.\u00b0 which a Polish nationalist alliance\ngroup, together with Polish Hitlerites, they just found in the forest a bunker, a\nwoman, two children, hidden. So they killed them. He came to our house to tell us\nabout it. Thought we would rejoice it, and we had, I had to hear that. And he told us\nthat he's leaving, go west with the Germans because the Russians are coming in. If\nthey catch him he will be sent to Siberia because his group was cooperating with the\nGermans, of course. And he left. I talked to the peasants, my friends now. I said,\n\"You know, I would like to meet the Russians. Said, please, please don't, and Mr.\nWoyick don't do that. They won't come here anyway. Don't do that it's dangerous.\nYou don't want to go in the field of action, but I had to go there.\nSo I was crawling out the village on all my fours. There was a little forest next the\n\u00b0N.S.Z.: Narodowe Sily Zbrojne. Soviet backed Polish partisans\nvillage and I could see the tanks for maybe, like a hundred feet away, only the\nRussian tanks. I recognize the star on the tank and I recognize their faces because\ntheir head was up out the tank, you know, looking with field glasses where they are or\nsomething, and I start getting up, to try to greet them and they start shooting at me.\nThe tank, thank Gods, the they didn't hit me, didn't get near me. You know, I crawled\nright back, right back to the village scared stiff. Before I knew it the Russian entered\nthe village. They asked for the mayor and asked how many people there was in the\nvillage and so on. And I was stopped. They asked me who I was. I speak fluent\nRussian so I said, \"I'm the teacher here.\" Then the Russian tell him I'm also a Jew. He\nsaid, \"A Jew. You're lying, there are no Jews here. You must be a spy. How come you\nspeak Russian? Only a spy speak Russian. And the Jews, there are no Jews left. They\nare all killed.\" I said, \"That's not true. Myself and my wife, we escaped and we hiding\nunder false names.\" \"False names, you must be a spy,\" and I said, \"No, I'm telling you\nIam Jewish.\" And he said, wait and minute, and he called another officer. His name\nwas Lev. I remember like today. It was a typical Jewish first name in Russian. Lev,\ncome over here. Take a load of this. This guy telling me he is a Jew. Now, you\nJewish. You find out. He comes to me and about 45-year-old man. He said, I am from\nLeningrad. I'm a plumber by profession. I'm officer in the Russian Tank Division.\n\u201cNow, you tell me you're Jewish.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d So he start talking me Yiddish. I do\nnot understand Yiddish. \u201cYou tell me you're Jewish and you don't understand\nYiddish.\u201d \u201cI don't. Because my family always spoke Polish to me. My parents spoke\nYiddish. I understand Yiddish. I can tell you what you say. But I can not talk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way. No Jew--If you Jewish, you speak Yiddish.\u201d I said, \u201cBelieve me. I\nam a Jew but I do not speak Yiddish.\u201d \u201cNo, you cannot be a Jew. He might be right.\nYou must be a spy. How come you speak Russian?\u201d So, I told him my story. I was in\nLvov medical school, I learn Russian from some colleagues that spoke Russian and I\ntold him and he said that's all baloney, I don\u2019t believe one word you say, you must be\na spy. Then .I remember a prayer in Hebrew. At that time rabbi that come to my home\nteach me a few things. I forgot most of it but I remember one prayer. I said, wait a\nminute. You know how to pray?\nHe said, well, I forgot. I said, but if I tell you a prayer will you remember that? He\nsaid, yes. So I start praying in Hebrew, just the beginning of the prayer. I don't\nremember too much of it. He look at me, look at me, he start crying. ... He was close\nto me. He put his arms around me. He embraced me, hugged me, kissed me. Said,\nyeah, you are Jewish. This was all in Russian. I didn't want the Poles to know that I\nam Jewish. I asked him that please, I don't want to disappoint them. They were so\nnice to us. We going to leave the area very soon. He told us where to go, how to get\nto our home, where my hometown was. I don't have to tell you the good-bye was very\nsad. ... The village's, the mayor, they want me to stay. They gave me a school. They\nwant me to stay and be their teacher there. They give me a little plot of land next to\nthe school. They--you were good to us. Our kids adore you. Why don't you stay here.\nYou don't have to worry about nothing and the war is over. Start from scratch. I said,\nlook, my hometown is Lublin. I have to go and put the pieces together. Maybe,\nmaybe, somehow I can find anybody from the family. I don't know where they are,\nyou know. Warsaw destroyed too and I lie a little bit and say I look for a family in\nWarsaw and so on, and they did understand. And on the way out the mayor squeezed\nmy hand and I do feel he knew who I was. ... And, one morning the peasants, they\nprepared a little bag for us, food, you know. They made us handmade kind of boots\nyou know, made out of felt and rabbit fur for Lucine, you know. It was cold. We had\nnothing, no coats, nothing and with their blessing we left. And we walked by foot\nmaybe 80 kilometers cold, winter, 20 below. ...We crossed to a little town, a little\nvillage.\nWe seen a man standing in front of a little shack, red head, he looked typical Jewish.\nThere is a word in Hebrew, they say amcho, amcho means are you one of us? Means\nare you our people. And I ask him amcho? He look at me he was afraid to say\nanything. Even the Russian there already. He was still scared. Finally I said don't be\nafraid. We are, but Lucine don't look at all. And I said what are you doing here? I\nsurvive in the forests in the bunker and everybody is killed. I said to him, I don't\nknow what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't have anybody to talk to and the\nvillagers were not friendly to me. I said, why don't you go to Palestine. He said, I\ndon't know what I'm going to do. Anyway, he asked us if we need anything, bread or\nsomething? We had some supplies and I said no, and thanked them and we parted,\ntotal stranger. We found our way to our hometown and here already was a Jewish\ncommittee working, organizing. The first thing we did was approach the Red Cross,\ntry to find out if my wife's little brother survived or not. We knew his name was\nKowalski on his papers and there was a name Kowalski as surviving one the camps\nbut turned out to be not him. We later found out that he perished in one the transports\nat that time and one of the concentrations camps forgot the name near Hannover in\nGermany. We registered in the Jewish Committee and tried to look for survived who\nwas left. We had a large family, over a hundred people. Anybody ask for is not there.\nOne day I went to my home, used to live, our home. Our whole family lived there. I\nthought maybe some neighbors, maybe she seen somebody. Anyone survive would\ncome to the place where you were born where you live. You have to start some place.\nTo my amazement they all crossed themselves to see I survived. Most of them very\ngrateful I did survive. Because they were good to my family, my family good to them.\nWe owned the building. My grandfather actually, not my parents, and he said, you\nknow what? One of your uncle, he survived. He was here. He tried to sell the\nbuilding. I said, how can you sell the building. First, it is not his.\nNumber two, how can he think about selling something, you know, when you looking\nfor members of family. You thinking about the house. Who cares? He is in uniform. I\nknew who it was. It was a younger brother of my father who used to be a lieutenant in\nPolish Air Force. And they told me where I could reach him. In a small apartment\nthere. When he seen me he put his arms around me, but rather coldly I would say,\nlike, he was not surprise I'm around. More or less. \"Oh, that's your wife.\" \"Yes, that's\nmy wife.\" He introduce himself. He was wearing a Polish officer uniform, looked\nmuch like a movie star, and I said, I don't know what do now. Is anybody left? He\nsaid, \"yes, my younger brother with my other uncle and my father's youngest brother\nis alive. He is in Yugoslavia. He was a musician. He was right under Marshall Tito.\nHe organized a military band for Marshall Tito in Yugoslavia when he lost his family\nhis little son in Rovno.\" If you remember, a little town east Poland when I escape\nfrom my home and I went to Lvov. This was him. He lost his wife, lost his little son.\nAnd he escaped through the mountains, Carpathian Mountains to Czechoslovakia,\nHungary, to Yugoslavia. He survived there he might be on his way home now. He's\nlooking for his wife, maybe he finds her. So he said, \"that's the key to my apartment.\"\nYou can only stay there maybe two days because I need the apartment myself. He\nwas single. He was dating already and so on. He needed his apartment and I couldn't\nget to my house either because other people lived there. My house but I couldn't kick\npeople out of there. So, in meantime, we met other friends of ours from high school\nyet. Lucine's friend and so on. So we managed to rent a little room someplace and so\non, and each day going the Jewish Committee to see whom we going to find because\nthis was a gathering place. That if someone survive, had to go there first and look at\nthe list of registrants. Who is there. Everyone coming home. Unfortunately nobody\nelse came from my family. And one day my uncle asked me, what you plan to do? I\nsaid, I promised my mom that if I survive ever I go back to school. He said, if you\ndon't want to be musician you want to be a doctor, do whatever you want to be but\npursue your career. And I felt I promises I should do it and that's what I want to do.\nSo we went to a town. The name is Breslow in Polish. I register in medical school and\nthe first words I was noticing I heard of students. Students themselves saying \"\nanother Jewish student.\" Another, Hitler didn't kill them all and this was in my mind\nin every place I turn around. I was not used to it because in my high school days the\nkids knew I was Jewish but never told me you're, a Jew. I knew who I was I. I didn't\nhave to be reminded about it. After the war things were worse. Instead of telling me\nI'm so happy you survived. Did anyone else survive? Can we do anything for you?\nCan we help you, books whatever? They tell me another Jew survive. It was like a\nburden on my mind and I was kind of crowded in this classroom, you know. I didn't\nfeel good there. And I met contact with some other students, not medical school.\nJewish students who were architecture, art and so on and we organize a student group\nin this town who performed music, dancing for the remaining Jewish refugees that\ncame back from Russian. Everyone was coming and going nobody stay in one place.\nMore people coming, some going away, gone to look for relatives and so on. The\nborders were open. You can go through in and out nobody ask you any questions.\nWhere are you going? Looking for my mother, looking for my father, looking for my\nbrother, looking for anybody, and everybody understood this. So there was a kind of a\nchaos on the border but it was not used up as a chaotic type of political purpose or so.\nEverybody knew this was a purpose of family reunions, and we one day in this group\neverybody was saying remarks, you know, that we shouldn't stay here. We shouldn't\nstay here. So we thought maybe we should leave Poland and go someplace outside of\nPoland. Czechoslovakia, Austria maybe, France, we didn't know yet. So this was in\nthe talkative stages and in the meantime, my uncle didn't show too much a ties to me.\nAnd he was doing his things, busy dating and doing other things you know. And in\nmeantime, he was arrested. He was the commanding officer of the Polish Pilot school.\nInstructor and commanding officer there for stealing a blanket or something, selling\non the black market. That was what he was accused of. Could be they wanted to get\nrid of him too because he was Jewish. They knew he was Jewish see, and was he\nthrown out. I never found out.\nI know he went to jail, maybe two years in jail. In the meantime, I was without any\nmoney and so on, so I decided to sell my house. It was a beautiful building. But I\ndidn't have nothing to live on. No suits, no dress for my wife, nothing. So I\napproached somebody who was an attorney. If you have any customer for the\nbuilding and said, yes, and found a butcher, Polish butcher want to buy my building. I\nsaid, why you pay the building? Everything is nationalized by the Soviets. You\ncannot own it. They said I know, but I made so much money during the Germans\ntimes, illegally slaughtering cattle and so on, I had all this cash lying around. I won't\nbenefit. Maybe someday my kids will benefit from it. They'll have the building at\nleast. I said, okay. I sold it for $1,000. The attorney took $400 so I was left with $400\nAmerican dollar which was a fortune. I buy a new suit. The only picture I have right\nnow is in the museum is with Lucine when we both were dressed. She bought a new\nhat. I bought a suit and shoes and we are in the park, and our kids look at the picture,\nDad, you don't look like you just survived the war. You look like you came from a\ncountry club. I was shaven, lean, smiling, pale maybe, but smiling. I said, look, we're\nyoung. We cannot bring back what we lost. We can live with the past, we can live\nwith our memories. We can start from scratch and build our home again from the\nbeginning. So that's what we did. I bought her a delayed wedding present. I bought\nher a ring, small ring and a watch, gold watch with the money and one day the whole\ngroup, with the help of Bricha. I don't know if you know who Bricha is. Bricha is the\nPalestinian underground agency which is helping the Jews escape from Soviet Russia\ncoming to Poland want to go to Palestine. They were smuggling those people, those\nyoung people to Palestine. With their assistance we crossed the border one cold night\nin November, 1946. The only thing I took we me is my student papers, my books and\nso on in case I ever go back to school and to save my papers. And on their advice\nthey took us to Vienna. We met a lot of Jewish students already, Americans, first time\nI seen Americans, life full of music and laughter. I didn't know what it was. I didn't\nknow how to behave. I was afraid of this thing. I thought it was sacrilegious; to laugh\nand to smile and go to night clubs, coffee houses.\nI couldn't cope with it. I wasn't ready for it you know. But we stayed together the\nwhole group for about 2 year and one when his own way. They graduated -- one\narchitecture, one electrical engineer, few medical students. One boy couldn't cope\nwith the situation. Went back to Poland, Jewish boy. Didn't know what happened to\nhim. And, then each one went his own way. With the help of the American Joint\nCommittee we getting a stipend to pay for our tuition. To my amazement when they\naccepted me to medical school they accept all the papers translated by the Jewish\nCommittee in Vienna found out I need my high school diploma which I didn't have\nwith me. I didn't know what happened to it. But my high school still stand. I wrote to\nLublin. They sent me a copy of my high school diploma. For whatever strange\nreason, I had 6 years of Latin and a degree of Latin was a dash, like I never had Latin.\nThe professor looks at it. I'm sorry everything is in order but you have no Latin. You\nhave to take a pre-entrance exam in Latin. I said you know if after all these years I\ndon't know if I remember too many things and my German was very poor. I just\nstarted learning German. What language do you speak? Polish, Russian. Okay. You\nspeak Russian. I speak Russian. So he give me two days to come back and take an\nexam in Latin in the Russian language which I did and I passed it. He said, I want to\nknow if you ever took Latin. It is not exam for grading. I want to know if you were\nacquainted with Latin, if you remember something and so on, which I did many\nthings. And he was satisfied. He gave me a passing grade and here I was back in\nmedical school. So, we struggled quite a bit. It was very difficult financially, but the\nZionist Organization in Vienna, helped us out. They rent a school for the whole group\nof us. And we lived in that school. They fed us, warm, you know. They gave us\nblankets, gave us suits, you know, from American Joint. We felt like human beings.\nWe did regain our dignity, slowly, and one day somebody came to us and said, you\nknow what? I just came back from the British Zone in Germany and I was on a train\nto Germany. Run into somebody who 1s a relative of yours. So I said, what? What's\nhis name? So, he mentioned first name Baruch, Baruch. I don't have anybody in my\nfamily named Baruch. Then Lucine remembered, you know what, that my cousin,\nwho was our only witness on our wedding in Warsaw ghetto.\nHe must be him. Well that\u2019s the address. We wrote a letter to him. He wrote back. It\nwas him. He survived the concentration camp in Germany. He made contact with an\naunt in New York City. It was his real aunt. It was my wife's second line aunt actually\nbecause the aunt with the baby in the Warsaw ghetto that went to the Hotel Polski\nwas her sister in New York. But we wrote a letter to them. We didn't ask for anything,\nbut they start showering us with gifts, packages, food, chocolates, cigarettes. I didn't\nsmoke. I was selling on black market. He, her uncle asked me if I needed anything.\nHe can send me to Vienna. He said, \"do you want papers?\" I try to get you papers to\ncome to United States. But first you have to graduate and get your diploma. Don't you\never come to the States without diploma. You'd be nobody. If you be medical doctor\nthen you be somebody. Your future be assured. As difficult it might be for now, I\nremind you of a family in New York, mind you, people I never met, I never knew,\nLucine never met, never knew. She knew of this them but was a distant family\nthrough marriage of her uncle. He start sending me packages of certain things,\nmedication. I sell on black market. And we live like kings then. So after graduate\nmedical school, we throw a party for maybe 50 people, our friends and so on like one\nfamily. We became one 93 family all the refugee, students and their relatives were all\none family. They substitute for our lost brothers and sisters. Their parents were our\nparents. We used to call them mom and dad, you know. Some of them fortunately\nsurvived, some parents of my colleagues. They were very good to us and it helped us\nto regain our composure you know and maybe regain faith in humanity. And slowly\nwe registered in American Embassy, and here we met a little difficulty with one lady.\nThis was the time of Korean War. We registered with all the proper documents. We\ngot a visa to enter United States. The only thing still, I didn't finish my final exam to\nget my diploma. She said, you have a deadline to meet. You have to go right now.\nYou have three weeks time to go. What am I going to do? I cannot get my diploma in\nthree weeks. My final exam is not until a few months from now on. She was very\nannoyed with it. She said \"I have my son fighting Korea and you have a chance to go\nto United States and you refuse to.\"\nI said, \"look, I'm not refusing. And I try to explain to her where I stand, what's the\nproblem.\" She was not very compassionate, couldn't understand, and said, well, if\nthat's how it is, then you might lose your entry. I said, well, if that's what's going to\nbe, that's what's going to be. If I go there now I be nobody. I only ask you to allow to\nfinish my studies. It's only a few months, can you ask for an extension? No, I can't.\nSo we walked out. This was the end of it. We are very depressed, upset and\ndepressed. We worn out. I didn't know what to do. I knew we could not stay in\nVienna because foreigners were not allowed to stay and practice in profession. You\ncould only study. And the one day we get a note, a letter from the embassy to report\nto the embassy. It was a different person. It was a man, A different lady and they are\ntelling us that we got our visa extended and when do we think we can go. Is our time\nto go. When can we go? We can go any time now. I just graduate and got my\ndiploma. So, I don't know what happened. Either this first lady had second thoughts.\nMaybe she was bitter that her son was in Korea fighting. I felt very bad for her. I was\nvery sad but, maybe she did understand my problem and quietly maybe she helped\nme. I don't know. I never seen her. I wish I would. And we packed and went to the\nStates. We arrived in New York. We are greeted by my wife's family. They treated us\nvery nicely. They were very well-to-do people. And they were very instrumental in\nour well being and he asked me, what can I do for you? You need money, tell me. I\nsaid, look, I\u2019m young, I have ten fingers, I have both hands, thank God I am not lame.\nI want to work. I do the right thing to do, only I need advice. And we survive. We\nsurvived so far. I didn't want nothing from them and I know he told me, you know,\nFelix, you're the only relative -- we brought quite a few from Europe -- you're the\nonly one that never asked for money. I said, you know what? It is a very strange\nthing. I learned from the past several years to do without money. I survived. If you\nhave less, you do less. You did what you could without money and this is not the\nmost important thing.\nWe have goal ahead of us, a purpose in life. I want to start as soon as I could. We\nwant to leave New York. It was a jungle. Too many refugee and I wanted to mingle\nwith American people. I didn't know any English, I want to start learning and I want\nto get on my foot all by myself without any assistance. So went to the Jewish\nCommittee in New York. Where should we go? We opened a map and the social\nworker put her finger on the spot. And she said \"that's Rochester, New York. What\nabout that?\" That's fine wherever it is. We went to Rochester, New York. Nice,\ncultural town with a decent school of music, beautiful medical schools and so on. Got\nacquainted with proper people. We got refuge from a German Jewish family. We\nstayed with them for several months. They were beautiful people. Very nice to us and\nright away I got acquainted with the hospital. The chief of the hospital was a Jewish\nfellow, Dr. Stapens (ph) who was fascinated with my stories. He wanted to know. He\nsupposed to ask me medical questions, if I equipped to start, what my internship.\nMind you, not speaking English was very difficult to establish that fact. He spoke\nsome German, very little, but one the chief surgeons was fluent in German so he\ncalled him in, and the three of us sitting in his chambers in medical school and talking\nGerman and what he was asking my whole story.",
        "Q: Tell me about going back and going back to the woman with the candelabra?",
        "A: After we come back to Lublin, we couldn't forget that lady, that she was selling us for\na silver candelabra to the Gestapo. How could a person who was a neighbor for years.\nHer kids grew up with my wife Lucy, a neighbor. She was a patient of my\nmother-in-law, who was a dentist. How could she? Could I do the same to anybody?\nSo I came -- we both came to her--we confronted her. She became pale like a ghost.\nShe went down on her knees. She crossed herself. She didn't believe, that's us, that we\nsurvive. She didn't know, she probably thought maybe they caught us that famous day\nthat she called the Gestapo on us. And I said, \"you sold us to the Gestapo and here we\nare.\"\nNow your life is at stake. Don't have to do 1s point a finger, what you did to us and\nyou be sentenced immediately, swift justice. They shoot you right away. She begged\nus, she was crying, screaming to spare her life in the name of her son and her\ndeparted husband, who died in the meantime, arrested allegedly by the German and\nso on. I couldn't do it. My wife inquired to some friends what can be done, if\nanything. I wouldn't let them be killed but I felt she should be aware of what she did\nand they told my wife. Unless she has witnesses that we're there at that time, there is\nnothing she can do. But the fact that the woman went through facing us was enough\nof pay back, what she owed us. I don't know if she's alive or not but if she died by\nnow, she died with the fact what she tried to do to us. That day Christian blame the\nJews. Crucify Jesus or Judas selling Jesus for silver. She tried to do the same thing\nonly she had killed Jews doing that. If she was a religious person, real Christian, how\ncould she do that? Where was the church all the time. Single people, priests did help\nus. They help us to get the real birth certificate. You need ID. Fakes were no good.\nThey checked it right away. But we received through the Home Army the real birth\ncertificate. The church was instrumental in helping us. There certainly was a certain\ngroup of Polish people, definitely the intelligent people, people-- the real Polish\npatriot who knew who the real enemy is, not the Jews, and the little shopkeeper in the\nvillage or so, and the milkman, the Jewish milkman was not a dangerous person to the\nPole, and the intelligencia the Jewish professionals, doctors, lawyers, CPA, and so on.\nWhat a threat to the population? None. No one, maybe more or less. That was a little\njealousy, maybe because the Jewish professionals lead a more, extravagant life,\nmaybe and it was striking something easy, visible. See, the Jews were traveling\nabroad overseas, etcetera, etcetera. Most Poles, even the ones that could afford it.\nThey didn't do these things. So there was certain differences, that the Poles did resent\nand I won't go into details. I'm not a social workers and I never did any studies on the\nsubject. This is just my person observation.\nBut my thanks are due to some people. We did survive thanks to some Polish people.\nAnd we grateful to the Polish Home Army, the leaders, the people directly involved\nwith us who saved many other Jewish people, poor people, without any\ncompensation. Risked their own lives, and I said it before, could anyone of us? Try to\ninspect my own soul. Could I do the same thing? What those Polish people did? I\nhonestly don't know. I was never a hero. Maybe I'm a coward, I don't know. But, they\nwere heroes in my eyes, they were. Maybe they were cowards too. Maybe, they\u2019re\nrunning only because they're human beings, and I remembered the words of my\nfriend who said, \"I don't like you Jews. I do it because I--nobody was going to help\nyou.\u201d\nHe was a humanitarian. He meant he was upset. He was upset and was angry that\nthey were arguing and in the Jewish -- in the Yiddish language where the neighbors\ncould hear and jeopardizing his life, his whole operation, his whole army. So I\nunderstand. But in order to understand my early days, my high school gave me a lot\nof happiness, the Polish people. I was their Jew maybe, but I never had a bad word\nfrom them, never. The only complaint I might have when I was young, I never dated\nJewish girls, and many Jewish girls felt I am a snob, or I don't know. I only dated\nPolish girls. Because I was more comfortable with them because I was raised with\nthem. I grew up with them and I was more at ease with them, and I was not\ncomfortable with the very religious Jews. Because I was ignorant about the Jewish\nreligion and the prayers, and so on. My parents did the best they could to instill in me,\nbut they were themselves not guilty of that. They never give them that proper\neducation, Jewish education. And I don't know if I should blame them for that or not,\nbecause we're the orthodox people the right people, or less orthodox or the less\nreligious people the wrong people who should be sentenced to die just -- they were\nserious religious orthodox, orthodox people going to their death. They were the real\nheroes. They were going there with the words in their mouth Shema Yisrael means,\nthat's the prayer for the dead. They were heroes. They didn't run. They didn't try to\ndodge or nothing. They were killed right and went to their graves right in front of\nthem. I think they are the brave people. Are we the heroes? No. I think we survive by\naccident, instinct maybe. But, we're here.\nWe have to build our life again from beginning. We have a nice family. We are a\nspecial family. I think, everybody my not think that way. We are very close, our\nchildren. They are very close to us. We talk to each other every day. We are fortunate\nwe're in the same town. We are 15, 20 minutes away. We are blessed with three and a\nhalf -- half is coming, the fourth one is coming -- grandchildren. We have three\ngranddaughters, fourth on the way. I gave the promise to my parents that we try to be\ndecent, honest. ... We never ask anything from anybody. We didn't have any, we did\nwithout it. We're not a burden to society. We grew up. I'm proud of my children. I\nfeel they are decent citizens and I feel as difficult as it is to talk about it absolutely\nmust, we don't know how long we'll stay here. If you have the history deniers, the lies\nspread now. Whatever good this will do, it's a living testimony. It happened. Thank\nyou.",

    "answers": [
        "A: Should I spell it too?",
        "A: I was born in Lublin, Poland on August 8, 1920, son of a middle class family. My\nbirth parents were fairly well to do people, not rich though. My mother was a\nfull-time mom. She used to sing in the path when she was young, but her career\nended before I was born, I understand. My dad was a locksmith and son of 1 of 13\nchildren, and when his father passed away he had to assume the responsibilities of\ntaking care of the entire family of 12 sisters and brothers. Naturally, he had to go to\nwork to support his family. That's why he didn't finish school yet. Eventually when he\nmarried my mom, he graduated from high school, became a locksmith to survive and\nto earn a living, and then slowly in coming years he felt a need for education, and\ngoing to night school, he became an architect. So I was raised in a middle class\nfamily. Very, very happy childhood. I had a sister, was one year older than I was. We\nlived in a big apartment house belonged to my grandparents. The entire family, over\n18, 19 people lived, there all my cousins so we see each other every day. Naturally, as\nyou live with your cousins, one try to outdo the other win, scholastically, otherwise,\nand this was promoted by the parents, particularly our mothers. Now, I was playing\nviolin since I was four and a half years old. I remember my first violin was bigger\nthan I was. I couldn't hold the violin properly. I recall the tortured nights when they\nput cork between my fingers to stretch my ridge of my fingers to reach the octave on\nthe violin. Naturally, this was not very promoting to my music career.\nI never forgot the tortures, but my mother was thus in heaven when I start playing\nparticularly, the concert, or so we had a quartet; my sister playing piano, my uncle,\nmy youngest brother of my dad playing cello, my other cousin was playing viol",
        "A: There was four people and I was playing violin. Of course, we were playing for\nfriends of our parents. I would rather be outside playing tennis or whatever. But this\nwas a ritual that for years was an understandable thing that we have to do and I liked\nit actually. But anyway, until I reach the age of 13 I would say, I had the idea that I\nwant to be a doctor. I don't want to, would like to be a doctor. I don't want to be a\nmusician. I knew I was not Heifetz or Perlman, but my mother would never\nunderstand that, and when I told her I wanted to be a doctor, this was like stabbing\nher in the heart. There were days I refused to practice ... and ... and with time of\nrebellion, a quiet rebellion. But then I had to do it, so after a day or two I start\npracticing again. I was going to school of music. Eventually I graduate ... in academy\nof music, and I was full fledged violinist. In the meantime, my father was involved in\nexpansion of a high school. This was a Catholic high school where the principal was\na bishop. I recall seeing him on occasions, walking in his robe in hallways,\naccompanied by a rabbi with curls, side curls, you know, and this fur hat, you know.\nTo me it was rather odd looking type of a connection here. We lived in the outside of\narea where normally Jewish people lived, what they call Aryan are",
        "A: It was modern edifice and there were no Jewish people around there. So my parents\nspoke Yiddish here and there, mostly Polish though. I did understand Yiddish but I\ncould never speak Yiddish. And one day, going back to the principal of the high\nschool, my dad asked him kiddingly, you know what, my son reaching the age now\nthat you have to enter high school. What you think of my son considered being a\nstudent in your high school? He said \"no problem.\" As soon as he passes the\npre-entrance exam, he accepted. There is no problem. But then my dad replied, but\nthis 1s a Catholic school and we're Jewish. So, ... the principal replied. We prefer a\nJewish student in a Catholic high school.\nBelieve it or not, I started studying hard. I was a good student and I passed exam and\nthe reality came through. I became the first Jewish student in the highly Catholic\nschool, high school. Well, my days in high school were extremely happy. They were\nthe best years of my life. I never felt I'm different. I didn't look different, but on the\nstreet, kids in the area knew who I was. They called me, you dirty Jew. You filthy\nJew, for no reason. But my high school I was never approached like this. I was\nrespected by my colleagues. I think they liked me. I was excellent student. I was even\nassigned by teachers of certain class like French, Latin, geography, history, to tutor\nmy colleagues from the same class that didn't do so well, and all of them went\nthrough and passed the exams. So, I was very happy to hear that I was instrumental in\nhelping my colleagues, and it developed a certain type of rapport with them, not\nbecause they are dependent on me, but it helped us to bind us together, I would say.\nAnd, I was very active in French club which I organized. I was very active in an art\nclub which I organized, and then musical circle too, and then eventually I was\nnominated by the director of the musical department school to participate in our\nsymphony orchestra in high school, to a point on one day we had a contest in our\ntown of different symphony orchestras in different high schools and this took place in\none big theaters in the city, and won the first prize and I was playing solo forget like\ntoday and I thought, my mother was very proud of me then. She seen certain things,\nyou know, that she hoped maybe I would fulfill a dream, and I was glad to give her\nthis kind of satisfaction although, innerly I felt that's not the road of my future. I was\njust insisting I would do something else and occasionally we discussed this and my\nmom didn't want me to talk about it about it. And there were different days you\nrespected your parents more and whatever they say, really this was the way it was\nsupposed to be. Maybe I was the first one in our generation in those days, that made\nquiet rebellion against, quietly, yet in the beginning but persistently pursued further.\nAnyway, my school days were really fantastic. Sundays was customarily thing that all\nboys high school all in uniforms would marching to church. I was in front with the\nband. I was playing saxophone and clarinet in the band. And then when we arrived in\nthe church, 800 or so students, went up to the church and my road led to the choir,\nand I was playing violin with the choir. Naturally, I was quite acquainted with the\nrituals with the prayers for eight years I was in school there and I felt that I'm\nCatholic, except I was not baptized. I had Christmas tree at home next to Hanukkah.\nAnd I had a, had a kind of natural thing to do. No one making fun of this. But then\nhere and there in the city when I went to the park or so, I seen Anti-Semitic remarks,\nand knowing who I was. One day I remember I was little. We went to the park,\nwintertime, and one of my dad's employees took a sled. I was on the sled. He was\npulling me on the sled. He was a professional wrestler, huge man, muscular man\nyoung in his 20s or so. It was a scene, a scene I never forget. Students of the local\nuniversity, Catholic university attacked an older Jew, religious person with his side\ncurls on, attacked him with sticks at the end which were razor blades. They are\ncutting off his side curls, and by doing this they chopped off his ear. Blood was\nflowing and I never forgot. I was a young kid. But they seen us watching them from a\ndistance. They ran toward us, tried to attack us. But my dad's employee was very fast,\nathletic and so on, he pulled that sled fast and they were falling, you know, in\ndistance and couldn't reach us. But eventually, they blocked our path, you know, and\nthey pinned us against the wall. He made a mincemeat out of them. He beat them so\nup, you know, that eventually police came in and arrested him. The fact that we were\nattacked meant nothing. I think he put to jail then. This was one episode I remember.\nBut this never happened in my school though. In school, I was person, that I was not\na Jew. I was respected by my teachers, professors, by the priests, you know, by\neveryone. That's why my memories going back now to those days are really great.\nAnd, I didn't realize at that time eventually, very soon afterwards this connection with\nmy high school and friends, colleagues, classmates, professors would help me\nsurvive. So this is about my childhood, very happy with a lovely apartment.",
        "A: This was probably in about '32, '34, 1933, '34, about five years or so before the war.\nThis was not an isolated incident. There were more incidents like this from then on.\nThere was more German propaganda after Hitler came to power in '33. Then you seen\npeople very traumatic. In front of Jewish stores, Polish people standing with signs \"do\nnot buy from the Jews, they steal your money.\" And in spite of this, many people\ngoing to Jewish stores, and then they are leaving the stores they were someone taking\ntheir pictures and eventually, they were using those photographs, the photographs in\nthose and placing the propaganda with the name of the people who frequent Jewish\nstores. And I seen all those things. I was already confused. Here I am in Catholic high\nschool. I thought I was Catholic. And to me, being Jewish didn't mean nothing. We\nare not a religious family although my parents had a kosher home, for one reason. All\nthe Jews had kosher home. They felt that the meat was cleaner, more hygienic. Meat\nwas not bought from a peasant who slaughtered the cattle some place in a barn, didn't\nknow how hygienic was done. So no one got sick from eating kosher meat or so, but\nthat's the only reason. But otherwise, we are not religious. But to explain yet my\nparents attitude towards me as their son, and to build up my identity although, they\nwere not religious I say. Once a year we going to the little Synagogue was actually\nsomebody's like apartment, where the Jews were praying all day long. I remember\nthat I was little boy then. I couldn't wait until the service was over. There was so\nstuffy. There was no air conditioning and I would rather to go out and play with the\nkids, but here I am, stuck with older people, you know, for a whole day until you are\nallowed to eat. You are not allowed to eat until sundown you know, so for a child,\nyou know, this was ... but food was not a problem really, but those scenes you know,\nI remember until today. And then to reinforce my identity who I was my parents hire\na teacher which they call a Rebbe.\nRebbe is not a rabbi. It is someone whose very well versed in the Hebrew teachings,\nyou know, and the religious laws and so on. And he was coming, I don't recall, three\nor four times a week to my home, and I remember he was falling asleep while he was\nreading to me and when he was half asleep, I was changing the book, you know. I\nwas turning over the pages, you know, so we would get faster, you know. And when\nhe woke up, half the book was turned over without him realizing it even. But, I got\nthe touch of it anyway, you know. Not that I learned anything from him. But there is\nsomethings I learned some things, prayers, you know, and but until today I was not\nvery comfortable being in a Synagogue because I didn't grow up in that kind of\nsurroundings you know. But I knew who I was. Then since there was a Catholic\nschools and there was so many other Jewish students in different schools. None\nCatholic but state schools who didn't had no formal Jewish education. So once a week\none of the professors of Jewish, of Jewish history was coming to our school Catholic\nschool teaching us about Jewish history, talking about the exodus of the Jews from\nEgypt and all the uprisings you know, the Jewish history and we, so more or less\nwere not ignorant about those things and then were graded on the base of his report.\nBut I was also graded on New Testament, which I attended, so I was graded on the\nNew Testament and also the Old Testament and religious education, and I had two\ngrades. And this was very happy solution to me until summer of '39, prior to\nSeptember 1, 1939. Rumors of Hitler Army moving, probably to Poland. We invade\nPoland. We on vacation at time, summer vacation and of course, most of the Jews\nbelittle the rumors. All Jews all rumor this and that, but as a precaution they decide to\ncut short vacation and come home. Sure enough, September 1, '39 war broke out.\nPolish Army didn't last too long, Within less than two weeks, or three weeks. The\nwhole army fall apart. Our government left Poland, first to escape, and only one that\nstood up yet was Warsaw, was defending self for several weeks. And Germany have a\nhell of a time, the whole of Poland was invaded already and Warsaw was still\nfighting. In the meantime the Germans entered our hometown. First thing they did, all\nthe Jews have to register.\nAll the Jews have to give up their possessions. Their music instruments, piano, grand\npiano, furs, jewelry, libraries, whatever was of certain worth to them they had to give\nit up. And of course, means of communications, telephones and radio. Germans were\nafraid of the local population listening to the radio, to BBC maybe. So we're not\nallowed to have the radios, and one day I remember my dad came home bloodied up.\nHe was beaten by the Pole and the Germans. He was caught on the street. He was\nthere to do some work you know, some labor work that day and they beat him up as a\nprepay and sent him home. When I seen this, I seen what was to come here. I recall\nwe sitting together, the whole family at the table, discussing what should we do. It\nwas too late to run. West we couldn't go, wanted us to know that Russia divided\nPoland with the Germans. The Soviet Army actually came from the East going West\nand they stopped at the River Bug and the German Army stopped at the River Bug\ntoo and our town was slightly west of the River Bug so we were at the fortune to be\nunder German occupation. Some of my colleagues, Jewish colleagues, decided to go\neastward, to the Germans. With the blessing of my family, I took a bicycle. My\nparents provided some cigarettes for me, for this was the best means of bribery and\nmoney didn't mean nothing. So if you want to ... were caught by anyone, especially\nSoviet solders, by giving a carton of cigarettes you buy your way out. There was not\ndocuments except the old Polish documents, and took me about a week to reach\ndestination far east in Poland. A little town named Rovno. Why do you go to Rovno?\nRovno was a city where my uncle, the younger brother of my father lived, and I\nthought at least I find somebody a relative of course. I arrived there. My ultimate goal\nwas to enter the school there and study medicine. But I was not accepted, maybe as\nmuch as good as I thought I will be. Mainly, because food was a problem. Staying in\nthis small, cramped quarters, you know. He was married. Had one boy, baby boy, and\nI know it was very difficult for them.\nSo I try to spare them the problem and I decided to leave and go to Lvov, the\nGermans call Lemberg, which was a big city, about 250,000 people, site of\nuniversity, formally under the jurisdiction of Austria, Hungary. Many intelligent\npeople spoke German, and it was just a beautiful city and I was very fortunate to take\nmy pre-entrance exam and be accepted in medical school. Now you have to\nunderstand, that I was a refugee. I had nothing with me. I had no money. I had no\nclothing except what I had with me and I was hungry most of the time. But I still felt\n... Lalways promised my parents I would pursue my education and that kind of an\nobligation I felt I should fulfill, and for myself too. I always wanted to be a doctor. So\nI was smart enough to find my way through and I was employed by the school\ncafeteria. I cleaned the tables. I was getting three meals and then knowing the\npeople, then slowly, I was fortunate enough to secure myself a bed and in a room for\nstudents, like a dormitory. And I was paired with another student, also a refugee from\nmy hometown. We became good friends and I was doing well in school.",
        "A: '39.",
        "A: I was 19. And through 1940 I was doing nothing but studying. I wasn't hungry no\nmore, and that's a time that we didn't have no communication with my home, Lublin.\nI was very bothered with the fact that I didn't know what was going on with my\nparents and my older sister. There was no way you could communicate there. I sent a\nfew messages through people, peasants they used to smuggle items going one way or\nthe other to the border, but allegedly they never received letters from me, which I\nlater found out. One day who knocks on my door? I open the door. Who is there? My\ndad. He swam through the River Bug and being pursued by the Germans and the\nRussians, arrested by the Russians as a spy and he bought his way out, explained he\nwas not a spy, a Jew looking for his son. They let him go. Happened to be a Jewish\nofficer understand. He came to Lvov.\nHe found me and looked at me and he was crying because I never looked so\ndilapidated, so abandoned like. And I didn't have a coat. I didn't have a blanket. At\nnight I covered myself with my overcoat, my blanket, but I was not cold. But he\ndidn't get used to this picture because I was always well-dressed and a well-to-do\nfamily, and so on and here -- I try to explain to him not to worry about me here. At\nleast nobody is going to kill me here. Nobody was going to shoot me. I still get my\neducation and I asked him maybe to stay with me, and we looked for ways to bring\nmy mother and my sister to us. There was no way. My dad refused to do that. \"There\nwas no way to do that.\" And he is stay with me for a few days only. I remember\ntoday, he sat on my coat. A button was missing. He said, if your mother would see\nthat she would be very unhappy. And he got a button someplace and a thread and sew\nthe button on my coat. I never forget those little things ... Then we parted...while I\nthought I would never see him again. But the meantime life was going on. I was\ngoing to school. 1941, July, war again. Germany, in spite of their pact with the Soviet\nRussia, they invade Eastern Poland and first thing what happened, Ukraine students\nin the dormitory, Knew who was the Jewish student. They grabbed me, one of my\ngood friends, Ukrainian, grabbed me beating the hell out of me. Forced me to scrub\nthe floor of a pub they had opened up for German officers. From then I was taken to a\nlabor camp in Janowska street in Lvov. It was not a concentration camp, it was a\nlabor camp, but the way they treated us was just like concentration camp. We lying\non wooden boxes really. Not in bed, boxes. There was nothing to eat. And we had to\nbe on a field at 5 am. wintertime. If you didn't stand straight, they beat you. They kick\nyou from the front, from the back, from the side. You couldn't go down or they would\nshoot you. So the awareness of not to go down, the beating always kept me aware of\nit, to stand up and I was numb. And after a while I didn't feel the beating even and\nthen maybe at 7am. or so we marching to the city to work, and after a few days I\nthought well, there was nothing to expect. I run away. And, where you going to go? I\nrun away to the dormitory. That's the only place I knew. However, I found three of\nmy colleagues, Jewish students, hiding in the basement. How they escape I don't\nknow, because they went through the building very thorough, using the Ukrainian\npolice with the Germans. We decided to go eastward. The Russians were still not too\nfor from the city, so hiding, going to the fields at night or so. We try to stop some of\nthe Russian trucks so they can maybe pick us up so we can go with them east to\nRussian. Well, they pointed their guns to us.\nThey didn't know who we were. They were afraid too. They were running away\nthemselves. So walking about 70 kilometers, mostly during the night, some during the\nday, especially through the forest so we would not be visible. We reached the town\nnamed Zolochev. It was a town of about 35,000 people, I would say 80 percent Jews.\nWith my luck, wouldn't you believe we walked in at a time when there was a big\npogrom taking place. Right away we were caught by the Ukraines, brought us to a\nsquare, town square and put in front of a small building which was the administrative\nbuilding, I understand. Here in front of us were bodies of Jews, piled one on top of\neach other, dead. They said to line up, four of us, with hands up, and there were about\nfew thousand maybe 2000 to 3000 spectators in the town square, mostly Ukraine.\nAnd we seen the SS or Gestapo, I don't remember which. I think it was SS and firing\nsquad. Before you knew you were there, right there and we supposed to be executed.\nWell, you know, this moment my whole childhood went through my mind. I close my\neyes. I seen everything. I remember first time, I recall any event which was a funeral\nwhen I was five years old. From then on, my childhood, my sister, my parents, my\nhigh school, the principal, the bishop, everything until this moment and like a movie.\nI said, that's a very short life though. And I didn't hear nothing. I just became totally\nnumb.\nMaybe it's like a self-defense mechanism with your body that if you know that you\nwere facing your final hour, maybe that's what it was. I was never a victim of\nexecution. So you don't know how to behave. It was so quiet, so peaceful, and I didn't\nhear a thing. And I was totally frozen. There were four of us lined up and I was\nsecond from the left. And then after a while, I don't know how long it lasted, I slowly\nopened my eyes, slowly. I thought, I cannot be dead. Its so quiet and peaceful. Where\nam I? Slowly, I turn to the left, slowly to the right, mostly with my eyes only, and I\nseen my colleague to the right. The last one was slumped over on the ground, so I\ndidn't know if he was dead or not. But all my other colleagues, one on the left, one on\nthe right, were standing like myself, erect and still. Slowly I turn more and more and I\nlook around and I see nobody. Totally turning around I look, thousands of bodies on\nthe ground. I don't know what happened. They looked like Muslims praying, you\nknow. And they were all dead. Making a long story short, I found out that two\nRussian planes came in, seen a gathering with the police and the German and they\nstart shooting and bombing the area. One colleague was killed. We believed he was\nmost likely killed by the Russians accidentally, not by the execution, the firing squad.\nWhen see what was going on. The three of us grab my little suitcase, tiny little satchel\nactually, and run to the river. The pogroms were still going on in the rest of the city.\nWe hid in the river, up to our necks. We took some bushes to cover our heads. We\nstayed there at least three or four days or nights. Until we frozen to death. We\ncouldn't stand it no more. We were hungry, exhausted. We didn't care. We're\ndesperate and we just didn't care what happened to us no more. So we decided to get\nout the river, and walking toward some buildings we heard Ukrainians say, Oh, three\nmore Jews not killed? How comes? You know, we kept walking, walking. I don't\nknow how we happened to -- we walked into a hospital, local hospital, happened to\nbe a Jewish hospital. Pogrom was over. Whoever was killed was killed. Thousands of\npeople were killed and they accepted us.\nThey fed us. They cleaned us, gave us some clothing and shelter and bed and asked\nus to work in the hospital. But I didn't know what happened to my family. This was a\nvery close-nit family and I had to find out if they were still alive or not. I didn't know\nhow to make contact with the family. So I decided to go back to Lvov, Lemberg,\nwhich was my university, and I thought we knew some Polish people there. Maybe\nsomehow they heard something, what happened to my hometown at least. So again,\nsmuggling our way through, all three of us went back to the Lvov and I did visit one\nof the families. They didn't hear nothing but they say they will be able to transfer\nsome of my message to the family if I know the address. But I didn't know the\naddress. But there was no problem finding where the Jews are living now in Lublin.\nAfter a while, someone came to me, I was staying with those people, the Polish\npeople. The ghetto was not fully forming yet at that time so Jews were moving\naround, not freely, but they could move around. They had to be at dusk in their\nquarters, you know. And a Polish fellow came to me and said my father contacted\nhim to bring me back home. He was a cab driver who drove all night, only during the\nnight, so he wouldn't be caught either. He had some false papers on some kind of\nPolish mission and I went with him back home, leaving my two friends behind, not\nknowing if we ever see each other, saying good-bye to each other. Driving at night,\nwe atrived home. Of course, I found my family not in the original home anymore.\nThey were moved to a ghetto area which was behind ... the old town, the Jews used\nlive there before, was a gate entrance. You had to go, pass through, show your ID\nYou go could to work through the gate again into the city. My father worked as an\narchitect. Again, he worked for the German railroad, so right away I was a medical\nstudent. But he got me a job on the construction of the railroad as a medic. I had a\nwhite band with red cross on it. I didn't have nothing else with me. I could do nothing\nfor anybody who got sick. I didn't know nothing about.\nAnyway, I was not a doctor yet, but this was a way of surviving, you know. And with\nhim every day to construction and I made a lot of contacts there with many Polish\npeople. I contact some of my school friends and they were happy to see me I was still\nalive. They ask me what they can do for me. At that time I didn't know what they\ncould do for me. We are not still in the situation very desperate yet ... and ... we were\ngoing through several selections what they used to call. Selection was the means of\nwhen the Germans coming to the ghetto. One night they arrive, maybe one in the\nmorning. They want to have a grand piano. Where we going to get a grand piano? We\nwere not allowed to have a grand piano. Remember, in '39 all the Jews have to give\nup all the musical instruments. So they didn't care where to get a piano. Buy it. Where\nyou a going to buy a piano at one o'clock in the morning even if you have the money?\nSo the people had to be taxes, I don't recall the sum of money needed, but early the\nmorning they went to town and they bought a grand piano and delivered a grand\npiano to the Germans. So we got a reprieve. A month later another selection. People\nwere not necessary for the German government to sustain the war machine were\neliminated. They were selected left, and right, left and right, and whoever was not\nneeded were disappeared actually. They took them by trucks and they left, no one\nknew where they went. We were fortunate. We were still together, the whole family\nuntil about April of 1942. In 1942 in April, the rumor was that the Germans are going\nto move all the Jews outside the city, there special quarters made for us. It's going to\nbe like a summer home for the Jews there. Little gardens we could go till our soil, and\nwe still working for them. Whoever is working 1s going to be working. From about 60\nor 70 thousand Jews there were only four thousand Jews left then. Mind you, that\nmany Jews were eliminated during my absence when I went East. So I came back\nthere was just about 4000 Jews. We had to march by the foot about 15 kilometers\nwithout belongings to new quarters. We took place the little -- village name was\nMajdan Tatarski. '\nThis was a little village of horse thieves and some peasants. They had a little cattle,\nlike a pig or two, dogs, and you know, and they put the Poles and the Jewish in the\napartment balconies. You could see a pig on the balcony and they were not very\nunhappy about it. They were not used to living in an apartment house, and the Jews\nwere in a little town not far away from the city, about several kilometers away from\nthe city, and this little town was surrounded by empty fields. So was at that time no\none thought about it that. This was strategically figured out by the Germans because\nthey won't be able to hide. There are all empty fields around this little town.\nUnbeknown to us they are building already a concentration camp, Majdanek, which\nwas only three or four kilometers away from this area. Some of my fathers Polish\nfriends were employed as carpenters, came back and told my father. They are\nbuilding some there, something very suspicious. We are working on it. We don't\nknow what is it. It is some kind of barracks, but maybe its for the German Army, for\nthe soldier or so. But then they building something like ovens, or something. We\ndon't know what it's for and some of the Polish people say, I bet you they\ncrematorium to burn the Jews. And that's how the rumor started. But where you going\nto go? There 1s no place to go. And in January I think, January ... No, no I'm sorry,\nnot January. November 9 was total liquidation of our ghetto. Early in the morning the\nUkraine Army, not Army, the soldier and the policeman surrounded the ghetto with\nsome Lithuanian policeman too, and they said everybody has to report at different\ngate and they will be deported to labor camps. That's all that was said. As my wife\nsaid in her statement before, my father built a little hiding place by doubling a wall\nthrough a hidden door. We could stay there in, only in standing position. This was not\na hiding place for a long lasting type of escape or so, hiding. You could maybe hide\nthere for a few hours or so, a day maybe and that is about all. We see the futility of\nthe whole thing. Because the announcement you could hear through the loudspeakers\nwhile were hiding. Anybody found hiding after such and such a time, 7 am will be\nshot.\nSo your only time to escape now is to get out now. My parents decided to leave and\ngo. They want me to save myself. I took Lucine my friend at that time to my hiding\n' Majdan Tatarski: or Maydan Tatarski.\nplace away from her parents because they had no place to hide at all. After we seen\nthe futility of our hiding place there was no point in doing that, and my parents\ndecided to go with the rest of the people. We escaped from this hiding place, went to\nthe attic of the Jewish Administration Building where Lucine's father was still active\nthere, and through the hole in the wall I see my parents and my sister walking with\nhundreds of people to unknown, to the concentration camp. That's the last sight of my\nparents I seen. I try to grab my sister to try maybe to escape together, but I didn't\nknow how and where and when. She didn't want to leave my parents. My parents\ninsisted I don't go with them, so I stayed with Lucine, not knowing what we going to\ndo next. And the picture of my parents huddling, holding each other, embracing each\nother, and the snow falling down called November, early morning, never leave my\nlife, always remember that picture. We still have about two hours time to the\ndeadline. Her father bribed the Ukrainian guard some gold coins and the a fountain\npen, a bottle of vodka I think, so he would just ignore us, not to look our way while\nwe try to lift the barbed wire, sneak right under the wire, escape. That's what we did.\nOne of the -- one, myself, my wife, her little brother was about eight or nine years old\nat that time. From under the wire we run away. We running zig zag fashion.\nUkrainian guards and other guards are shooting after us but didn't hit us, and, after\nrunning for two, three kilometers we found a Polish peasant who was going home in a\nwagon, horse-driven wagon. He gave us a lift, you know. He probably suspected who\nwe were because there was no other people in this area. He didn't said nothing then,\nnothing to us. He pretend that he didn't know nothing.\nAnd where we go from here? No plan, no money, no documents of any kind. First\nthought was to go to a bishop's palace. This was not the bishop who was the principal\nat the high school, but the gardener at the bishop's palace. Their son was a friend of\nmine that I tutored in high school. We knock on their doors early in the morning.\nWhen his mother seen me, she cross herself. She said, My God, where is your mom\nand dad? I said, they left already. What are you doing here? We looking for shelter.\nCan you help me? She took us to greenhouse. It was nice and warm there but she\nsaid, look, you can only stay here until early in the morning because this was Sunday,\nbecause next Monday morning the workers coming in they find you hiding, they\nwould denounce you to the Gestapo or the Polish police, and you know what they do\nwith us they find you hiding here? They kill us all. So we stayed there. She fed us,\ngave me a coat and a jacket, of her husband. Her son was missing in the war. She\ndidn't know where he was. He turned out to be later on in the British RAF. He\nsurvived the war, but she never forgot what I done for her son. He passed all the\ngrade because I tutoring him, French, Latin, math, history and she felt very bad. She\nwanted to help but she was scared stiff and I understood. I don't know if situation be\nreversed how would I behave? Would I have the guts to hide those people under a\ndeath threat? In all honest, I don't know if I could do it. I did understand their\nmotivation and their fears but was grateful, they kept me at least overnight to get our\nthoughts together. And then I remember my dad's associate, a Polish fellow. My dad\ngave him all the shops. Give to him as a present since he couldn't keep it himself. So\nhe inherit all the tools and the machinery, so on, and he not too far away from the\nbishop's palace. So, early in the morning before the workers arrive, we went there and\nknocked at the door again, and the same story. He crossed himself. My God, where's\nyour dad? Told him the whole story again. He said, let's go right now through\nwarehouse and nobody will see you.\nSo he hid us for several days there brought us a little food there, and he gave us\nnames of people to contact in the Polish underground. Maybe they can do something\nfor us. While I was waiting there hidden with her little brother, my wife, without\ndocuments, went to Warsaw by train, which was a life-threatening situation, to\ncontact some people who knew how to get the documents. Mind you we have no\nmoney, no money. This was name of the game. You're not alive you have no money.\nShe contact some people. She was directed to some hotel where the Polish\nunderground was there and they were manufacturing false documents. Over there she\nmet a friend of her father who was already ... domesticated, so to say. He had his\ndocuments. He lived on the Aryan side. He tried to seduce my wife, at that time not\nmy wife yet. Tell her he would help her only if she would stay with him. Of course,\nshe rejected the whole thing and she left him. She came home back with false\ndocuments. Now, how do you move from a hiding place broad daylight if your\nhometown, not too big of a town, but people might know you and you didn't know\nwho was going to denounce you? We couldn't go to the railroad station. The station\nwas surrounded by police and Gestapo, but at least we've had documents, so we are\nhire a driver with a buggy whom took us to next little town which was about 15\nkilometers away, at night. How this man never suspected. If he did suspect, he never\nsaid a word to us. Who we were. It was obvious, you know. We were like odd people,\nodd couple. Myself, little boy didn't look like our son. Too young for that. It was\nunusual situation so anyone with common sense would know who we are. Arriving in\nthe darkness in a little railroad station and we boarded a train. I was very upset, very\nnervous on the train. I had documents, but, they're false documents. And after maybe\ntwo, three hours ride on the train, all of a sudden train stops. Doors open. German\nGestapo, SS walks into each car. Asks documents, everybody's documents.\nWell, we are not sitting together. I pretend I do not know my wife, my Lucine, I\nmean, my friend, in front at that time in case one is caught, maybe other escape and\nlittle boy sitting with her, just in case, her brother. And then one of the officers comes\nin and points out to young man. You, you, you, you. One of them was me. This 1s it.\nBut there were mostly Polish people there. I was kind of confused. What's going on?\nWell, they were catching Poles too to send to labor camps you know, to send most to\nGermany. Get out they say. So I got out. I line up with a few other people. Maybe one\nof us young guys -- and go with me. I thought we shot probably. So what happened?\nWe went to the first car and we start going to car to car, through the whole train. They\nwere liquidating all the ... tobacco, food, hams, meats, that the Polish peasants were\nsmuggling to the city to sell in the black market. And we are the people that supposed\nto carry all the stuff to their cars. And this took about two hours, and at the end this,\nhe gave me a big ham. Payola, and back to the train. And so went back to the train\nand arrived at midnight in Warsaw. You know by now that we were accosted by a\nrickshaw driver. We request to go to same hotel that my wife knew about when she\ngot the false papers. This was the headquarters of the refugees. How the Gestapo\ndidn't know about it yet I don't know, but it's the only place we knew of. The ultimate\nplan was either to make contact to stay in Warsaw proper on the Aryan side, or if not,\ngo back to the Warsaw ghetto which was still big and maybe look up her uncle who\nlived there. Maybe he be instrumental in assisting us. So we gave him the address\nwhere to go but we see he is going to the opposite direction and we ask him, where\nyou going? He said, oh, you know where I am going. I'm going to, you know, I'm\ngoing to Aleja Szucha\u2019 which is known headquarters of the German Gestapo. Why\nyou take us there? You filthy Jews. I'm going to be paid for you very well. And I said,\nhow much can you get paid for that? So we didn't deny the fact anymore. We didn't\nadmit who we are, but it was obvious. I said, look, take whatever we have. We don't\nhave much but whatever we have is yours. What you going to gain? They going to\nkill us. So, he took my coat, my boots, left me with my socks, scarf, a fountain pen,\nlittle money we had, not much, took her purse, everything.\nLeft us in the middle of the street past midnight, that if we could be caught by any\npatrol, you know, and killed right away. Anybody moved after midnight was a game,\nyou know, they were shooting. They didn't ask any questions, and we found a way to\nthis hotel. Over there we made contact with some people. We see we have no way of\nstaying outside the ghetto, so we contact a man who was involved in the labor groups\ngoing in and out of ghetto. One of them was a friend of my father. He was from my\nhometown. He knew my father very well. So when he recognized me he said, come in\nat four o'clock. I will take you to the ghetto when the group is finished working. We\narrived there at four o'clock. He took us all, my wife, her little brother, myself to the\nghetto. Was a horrifying sign in the picture of the ghetto. I'm not used to it. Even in\nour ghetto in Lublin, the situation was not as desperate as in Warsaw. There was\nabout 60,000 Jewish living in that ghetto. There were many dead bodies lying in the\nstreet covered with newspapers. The stench of the bodies, you know, flies, and people\nbypassing them like nothing happened, just macabre sight. This is what we came to\nghetto for. People dying like this. Better off dead, being shot by German. We found\nour way to Lucine's Uncle's house. He was very well-to-do person. He was employed\n* Alea Szuch A. Szucha Avenue, or Lane.\nby American Joint Committee before the war in a very high position. Very wealthy\nperson. They had a little baby girl so we said look, we don't have no place to go. We\nhave no money. We have nothing. Could you help us. So he said, well, I don't know\ntemporarily, why don't you sleep on the floor in the kitchen and Lucine -- her name\nwas Estera at that time -- you sleep upstairs 1n the attic. He never asked us if we\nwanted to eat anything or not. We were hungry and we were depressed and\ndevastated morally and broken down, sleeping at nights. Maybe 2:00, 3:00 AM I seen\ncandlelight. I seen waking up at night her uncle and her aunt eating food, you know.\nThey never ask us if we want to eat anything. They didn't want to share the food with\nus. There was not much food at that time, so they tried not to share it with us. I\ncouldn't blame them really, you know.\nBut we seen how can we live like this, you know. Then they got the bright idea you\ncannot live under one roof without being married. Well, Lucine was only 16 years old\nand he said we have a friend who is a rabbi, a friend of your father -- meaning Lucine\n-- I'll try to contact. Maybe he marry you since he knew your father. Turned out he\nwas sick at that time with typhus, and so he found another different young rabbi.\nWithout having a ring, without having any proper clothes or suit or a dress for her, we\ngot married. There was a young couple before us. Somehow they got us bottle of\nwine. We got married. We toast each other with their wine and after the wedding\nceremony, which only the two people, the previous couple witnessed and also her\ncousin -- which survived the war too, he witnessed so till today were the only ones\nwitnessed our wedding. Leaving the ceremony, she run into a lady who recognize her,\nfriend of her mother, who was just out with her husband. So she said, we just got\nmarried but no rings. She took the ring off her finger. Why don't you take my ring?\nMaybe bring you good luck, and she give her ring. And this was our honeymoon in\nthe Warsaw Ghetto. We decided to move out of her Uncle's house. We had to really.\nWe found one little rooms, cramped, with other people. They allowed us to use one\nbed. There were no mattresses. You just improvise by taking a sack, a canvas type of\nsack filled with straw and put some towels over it and no sheets. That was your bed\nand, but I had contacts.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: I have to regress and recall some incidents I would like to mention maybe. When I\ncame back from Zolochev back to Lvov or Lemberg, when before I met my three\nother colleagues from medical school. During the one occasion when I was I was\ncaught by my Ukrainian colleague and he asked me -- he forces me to clean the pub,\nthe floor etcetera. One of the days I went to work they asked some people, who\u2019s a\nmechanic? This was a good profession to be in. Without hesitation I raised my hand. I\nmechanic. I never touched anything mechanical in my life, but many people were\ndoing the same thing, and they took me on the side and one mechanic came in, turned\nout to be a Jewish boy too, and ten of us we took the police garage. They gave us\nsome quarter there, a bunk bed. They fed us good and asked us to work on their cars.\nI admitted to the man, chief mechanic, that I have no blind idea about mechanics. He\nsaid, shhh, be quiet. We'll help you what we can. I'll tell you what to do. Just unscrew\nthis portion and then oil this part and so on. We'll tell you what to do so don't worry\nabout it. I'm running the show. You do what I tell you to do. Was very nice about it.\nAnd so I was there for maybe a few weeks. We're fed well. We're not beaten. The\nGermans usually say hello to us. The German Police, it was not the Gestapo, this was\nnot the SS. And one day during the evening, one of the German officers approached\nme in the garage and took me on the side and asked me, 1s it true you're medical\nstudent? And I said, yes. He said look, I want you to be aware of it that as of tonight\nthey're going to liquidate the garage and they'll take you all of you away.\nI don't know where, you won't stay here. I want you to know there's a stable on the\nleft wing of the building there, and I will give you something to carry for me to the\nstable now and I will meet you over there. I was very puzzled with the whole thing\nbut you do obey orders. I went there, I followed him, went there with this big box.\nThen he show me behind where the horses are placed. there's a little hiding place.\nYou stay there. They will never find you there and at night after they liquidate this\ngarage, and so on. You can stay until next day or so and somehow you have to get out\nof here and go to town and I'm bring you something. He went, came back maybe a\nfew minutes later, and brought me a whole chicken. He said, that's all I can do for\nyou. I can do nothing else for you. I'm so sorry, and he left. I don't know his name,\ndon't know who he was. I know he was a doctor in German Army. He was not a\nGestapo, he was not an SS man, he was not a policeman. He was a physician, very\nyoung. In his upper 20s maybe. That's the only benevolent act I have encountered\nfrom Germans.",
        "A: I heard some voices only, noises, but not very loud, and then everything was quiet.\nAnd the next morning gates were opening and closing and cars trucks moving out,\nand the whole regiment of the police left the compound and there was no one left\nbehind, and I waited until night, following night, and I through the fence I find my\nway back to the city, to the ghetto area. And I approach some of the Jewish people\nthere and they let me sleep in one the rooms there, and that's next day I went out to\nthe ghetto with the work battalion. And I approached one the Polish people that I\nknew from before who could contact my father, which I mentioned before. This was\non one episode. Then when I came back home and prior to liquidation of the ghetto\nfew days before, I did try to escape. We did know that the ghetto was going to be\nliquidated completely and I tried to run away, and going under the barbed wire the\nUkraine were shooting at me. I was running like a wild beast and they wouldn't have\ncaught me if not the police dog. He grabbed, forgive my French, my buttock, ripped a\npiece of flesh out and my calf and subdue me. I was bleeding all over. Then I was\ncaught by the Ukrainian guards and they brought me back to the ghetto and handed\nover to the Gestapo, and they start beating me up.\nThey were beating me, standing behind me with a -- we call it a peitsche.\u2019 What it\nwas is actually is a handle made out of leather, hard leather, at end of which like a\nwhip. Actually was a hard, metal ball with points on it. Standing behind me he was\nhitting me from the front so it was injured, my face actually standing behind me. And\nI have a little scar and I... until today I am impaired vision in left eye ... was bleeding\nfrom the eye. But I couldn't go to a doctor of course. I will stay like this until two\ndays later until finally, when finally the ghetto was liquidated and I escape again.\nWith Lucine, my future wife and her little brother under a barbed wire, and you know\nthe story then that we were hiding in the bishop palace, which I mentioned before,\nthen went to my father's friend who hid us in a warehouse. Then Lucine went to\nWarsaw to secure some papers for us. Then she come back. We had the papers all\ntogether but no money. Lucine remembered her parents left some jewelry and silver,\na candelabra with a neighbor and a friend who lived in the same house. So we went to\nher and Lucine approached her. Would you mind at least give us one candelabra so\nwe can sell it, maybe find a way to Warsaw so -- and if we don't survive, whatever\nelse my family gave you is yours. She said, well, but, you know, I don't have it in my\nhome everything. Is hidden in the attic and I cannot go to the attic tonight because the\nneighbors would be very suspicious, what am I doing in the attic. But come tomorrow\nand I will prepare everything for you. I will wrap it so people won't know what it is.\nCome back tomorrow at two o'clock. Having a suspicious mind, and you felt a certain\nextra instinct, like a hunted animal, I just felt maybe the whole thing sounded fishy.\nInstead of coming two o'clock, we approached the area about noon time, 12:30. Now,\n*peitche: whip.\nwe're locating ourself across the street from the main entrance to the building that the\nlady lived, and this area was bombed out, lot of ruins, you know. You could hide very\neasily there, and behind us was a little street and a small apartment like a street\napartment.\nActually, that my colleague from high school lived there. His father was a shoemaker.\nI was tempted to go there, now stay there maybe and watch the house, but then I\ndidn't want to expose them to this kind of danger either. So I decided to wait on the\nstreet behind the ruin, and sure enough about one o'clock we see two police cars\npulling over to the curb of the house and two or four Gestapo people got out of the\ncars and rushed up stairs. Within about 15, 20 minutes they came out and they split.\nTwo people went one way, the other two people went the other way, looking for us. I\nassume they meant us. We didn't wait too long there. We knew she had denounced us\nto the Gestapo because of a silver candelabra. And I just remember now talking about\nJudas sold Jesus and the situation was so analogous to it, you know. But anyway, we\ndidn't know what to do so we run into my friend's house. The parents recognized me\nright away, what happened? I told them what happened very briefly and shortly.\nGestapo looking for us. What going to do? And she very, old lady, you take your coat\noff. Here, take your shoe off and start putting nails in your shoe, in my heel. She gave\na apron to my wife and she was cooking something on the iron stove. Said, you\npretend you cooking dinner right now and your little brother, put him to bed. He's\nasleep. Now we'll cover him up with blankets. There was a curtain separating a one\nroom apartment, a curtain separating the one bed area from the work place and the\nkitchen, and this old lady took a blanket outside, start dusting the blanket, calmly,\nquietly. All of a sudden, two people approach her. Did you see Jews here? So she\npretended. Jews here? There no Jews here. They all dead. There not nobody here.\nWhose house is that? My house. My father's working here. My husband's client 1s\nhere and my daughter is there. She cooking right now, dinner, and they walked inside\nto see. Didn't ask for the paper, although we did have documents, false. They looked\nlike they didn't believe they would be fresh enough to be so blatantly, you know, or\nstupid or to stay right near the scene of a crime. And they left the house and start\nlooking for us again. Of course, we didn't wait too much longer. We took off. That's\nwhen we went back to the warehouse the same night we took that horse and buggy\ntype of thing to the near railroad station near Lublin.\nWell, going back to the ghetto area. So, we lived in one little room and from there I\nhad to go on to work detail. Each morning a group of maybe 40, 50 people gathered\nin the ghetto area with a leader. The leader was a friend of my father, and with him\nwe're going to the railroad station over there. We're unloading cars. They didn't beat\nus there but didn't pay us either. Didn't feed us either. The only pay off was I could\ntake as much coal as I could carry on my back as my payment for days work. So I of\ncourse, I put as much coal as I could. I was bent over on all fours practically, carrying\nthe big sack of coal back to the ghetto. It was cold but we couldn't afford to heat our\napartment because this was all our food depend on the coal. I was carrying to the\nthird story with some the richer, older Jews you know. We were buying the coal.\nWith the money we collected for the coal we could buy some food. We lived on\ncarrots, cabbage, turnip from which, of course, we got diarrheas. We were sick,\nstomachaches. There was no bread. We couldn't afford any bread. There was nothing,\nnothing cooked. There was nothing to cook. And on one of my trips I notice a\nfamiliar face in a uniform of a Polish railroad man and I thought, I know this face.\nAnd as I said before, you develop a certain instinct. You just aware of your\nsurroundings. Who is around there. Who, is he a friend or an enemy? And finally I\napproach him. I start working the area he was standing. I said do I know you? Aren't\nyou from Lublin. He looks at me. He said, who are you? I said my name, it is Horn\nfrom Lublin. He said, yes. Don't show any emotion. I know you, yes, I am so and so.\nHis name was Lowloc Rice (ph). I said, I know, I thought that was you. He said,\npretend we don't know each other, and let's not talk to long. What are you doing here?\nI said I wanted to get out. What can I do to get out? So he said, why don't you come\ntomorrow again same time and we talk in details. I can't talk to you now right now. I\ncouldn't wait. I came back to the ghetto with my sack of coal. Next day early in the\nmorning went back to work in the detail group and sure enough he was there. And he\nsaid, I can get you out of the ghetto but it cost a lot of money. I said, I don't have no\nmoney but, you know what before I left the ghetto in Lublin, my father show me a\nspot in his shop that he buried a case.\nIt's a steel case with jewelry, gold, watches, bracelets, my family's jewelry, and one of\nour friends who was a jeweler. Whoever survivor the war, if ever then you can live\nthe rest of your life on it. I remember that spot. That's the only thing I know. I hope\nit's still there, but I cannot give guarantees. But I know this spot. If you were willing\nto talk to your people and they are willing to take a chance, whatever we will find,\nhalf is theirs. I need only a little bit to survive. You can take more than half. I will\nleave it up to you, how much you want. How much you leave to us. He said, let me\ntalk to my people. I said, who are your people? Well, I can tell you that that's Polish\nUnderground, Armia Krajowa, or Home Army. They need money to buy ammunition,\narms, etcetera. I don't know if they will go for this kind of deal because it is\ncomplicated, but if they will, I'll let you know. I will be here in a day or two. But I\ndon't know what day, but I'll find you. So I was coming to work every day with the\nhope, my dreams kind of encouraged, maybe he'll find him. Maybe is something work\nout. Otherwise, I see the doom. Sure enough, one day he's there, again same spot in\nthe uniform. He said, I talk to my people. They went for it, and on such and such a\nday you lead off. Your leader of your group is part of us. He part of us, our group too.\nHe knows all about it. So you will be snatched too. Make sure your wife goes to work\ntoo and her little brother too. Children were going to work too. No one question\nanything. And sure enough, at that given early in the morning by carrying a sack of\ncoal to the side, we're snatched by a group of people from the Polish Underground\nwaiting with a car, and then a streetcar. We change streetcars to different streetcar\nand people were changing to our guards. Our guards were changing. They all armed\nin case they caught us there would be a fight. And we arrived to a house, to an\napartment house which one of the -- not headquarters but one the apartments were the\nPolish Home Army was meeting was meeting there.\nI was surprised. We found maybe 10 or 12 Jewish people there, hiding. I found out\nthat he is helping lot of Jewish people. I looked at it and I met this man. I asked him\nwhy do you do that. The first man I seen so definitely show the effort and the risk to\nhelp the Jewish people. Why? You like the Jews? He said, no I don't. So why do you\ndo that? Well, I show you. He took me another room. Now listen to it. And I listened.\nThere were noises over the wall, people talking Yiddish, arguing and fighting with\neach other. He said, what kind of people are you? I'm risking my life and here they\nstart I fighting about, they fighting about stupid things and the neighbors they hear\nthose things. They denounce it and we're all dead. I never see people in danger who\ndo this kind of thing. I don't respect your people. I have no answer to it. What can I\nsay. They're old orthodox people. For some reason they felt they should continue\ntheir orthodoxy, their sacred needs. They want kosher food. You know, where you\ngoing to get kosher food there? One of the men died, older man died, but he was very\nreligious. What the Home Army did, they put him in a an orthodox kind of a canvas\nsack. That's how the Jews are buried you know. Not in the coffins, and they threw\nhim over the wall in the Jewish cemetery. They didn't bury him there and but left him\nthere in the Jewish cemetery. And I think this was more than anybody could expect.\nBut this was just one the examples what those people did for us. And, they described\nthe whole plan what we're going to do. First thing, I got the papers as a railroad man\nand they give me a uniform with a cap, a jacket, slacks, you know, the typical railroad\nuniform, with documents employed by railroads in Warsaw. And he said, you going\nto go with a group of few people. One is a Volkes Deutch and I don't follow, Volkes\nDeutch is a German who lived in Poland for generations, but he still did not lose his\nGerman identity. He could be Polish patriot. And this was, one was by your German.\nHe was just an excuse to get all the country German Army. He knew where they are\nand he had a special privileges as a German citizen really, and he pretend to be\nalways humiliated by the Poles and so on. So it's special right and privileges.\nHe was our protector on the trip on the rail to Lublin with guarded by two Polish\nUnderground people, armed all the time. We arrived at the scene and sure enough, the\nlocation used to be a shack was a street now. The shack was raised. To explain a little\nbit yet more about the situation, Lublin was at site where the Jewish POWs from the\nPolish, from the former Polish Army where stationed there, and they were doing the\ndirty work for the Germans. They were digging in the ghetto. They are leveling the\nghetto. They were removing the door-frames, the window-frames, the door, the\nhinges, where the Jews were hiding gold and coins, and jewelry, diamonds,\neverything they could. And they were taking everything apart piece by piece, and\nthey leveled that hut, the little shack. There was nothing ... but I seen the spot. I knew\nthe spot right way. And I said, I'm going to stand up on that spot. That's where it is.\nBut he said, that's a street now. He said, well, okay. We'll come back tomorrow and\nwe left. He took me to one of the people home. I stay overnight. They fed me. They\ntreated me nicely, and next day they took me back to same location. What do I see?\nThe whole street is blocked off, detour. The signs of detour. Broad daylight. A tent is\nerected middle of the street and the a sign, and A big roll of cable standing next to the\ntent, the German Post Office and telegraph. And people, helmets and overcoats are\ndigging in the middle of the street right where this thing is, the understand was when\nthey find the case that I described. They lit a torch and this was a sign that they found\nit. Now, I was hiding across the street and behind a door there was a little window\nthere. There were people passing. It was a big apartment house and I was standing\nthere, and looking through a little window there and watching if they lit the torch.\nWhen this was torch be lit, this was a sign for me to get out and mean they got the\ncase and they won't need me no more. They will take me away and we'll go back\nhome and, I am of course, I'm standing there, very nervous, very upset. Don't forget,\nthis my hometown. I could run into somebody I knew, somebody knew me, and this\nwould be the end of it. But I was guarded people with arms, you know, so I knew it\nwouldn't be easy for anybody, so they told me not to worry about it.\nIf this happen that Poles recognize me they will fix him right away. Germans don't\nenter this area anyway. They were not concerned at all, but I was nervous and maybe\ntook about two, two and a half hours, I see them stopping working and one of them\nreaching down and then straightening out and taking a torch and lighting a torch. And\nI was sweating and I thought that was a sign. I was coming out right into the middle\nof the street and here is the case opened up, completely empty, open up empty. I don't\nknow what to say, but at least I knew this was true. They knew that I didn't lie to\nthem. But where's the gold? Where's all the goodies? We found out later on that the\nJewish POWs were digging everywhere and they opened this thing and left the empty\ncase there and closed it up. They didn't report to the Germans cause the same day,\nunderstand, people are selling watches in the camps of the POWs. Watches and gold\nthey were selling everywhere. Well, this was the end of our trip and I knew we were\ngoing back to the ghetto because they did not receive what they are supposed to get.\nOn the way back home on the train we talked about it. We had one compartment.\nThere was no other people there and I said, well, obviously we cannot afford to be out\nof the ghetto. We cannot pay you people. I want you to understanding that I didn't lie\nto you about it. Yes, we know that. You going to send me back to the ghetto? He said\nno. Why? What would you do in the ghetto? You would perish in the ghetto. Maybe\nyou can help us here on this side. You can work for your upkeep. We'll discuss the\ndetail and come home. So we turn back to Warsaw. And you know the rest of the\nstory. That important fact I omitted that we got married in Warsaw Ghetto and my\nwife, with the help of the Polish Underground got us a little apartment, one little\nroom. I was hiding there. I did go to a hiding place in the washroom, boarding up the\nwalls of the washroom and creating a hiding door. When you lifted the boards of the\nwall was a secret door that you open up, and behind the door was a little hiding place\naccommodating maybe eight or nine people. I built a little bed so we could lie there\nand so on. Now this part of the building was totally destroyed during the bombing of\nWarsaw, so there was a way we could have run away from this hiding place any case\nof a danger, if someone entered the front of the apartment, with a signal which was\ndissident in the beginning. In case any danger, Lucine would knock on the door\ntwice, and we would know to run. We did have an emergency address where to go,\nanother hiding place through the Home Army, hiding Jews in case of different\nlocation. In case of emergency we could find a spot there until situation would clear\nup. And sure enough one day the janitor became suspicious because Lucine was\nbringing too much food in her little basket and he thought two women living in that\napartment, and she bringing food galore, and he notified the Polish police. One day\nwhen she came in from work -- and what kind of work she was doing. She was selling\nwomen\u2019s nets on the market, flea market and so on. Nobody knew she was Jewish, of\ncourse. She had good looks as an Aryan person. She seen policeman at the door. She\ndidn't want to go in so she went to a store in the same building, grocery store. First\nthing she did was took the key out of her purse. She drop the key in a sack of beans\nand while doing this the policeman entered the store and arrested her. They when\nthrough her purse and ask her where her key. Oh, I guess I lost it. They look on the\nstreet everywhere, they couldn't find it. Which is your apartment? What do you want?\nWhat do you want? We understand you are hiding Jews. You are accused by the\njanitor that you bring too much food for two people there. We want to see your\napartment. This conversation was very loud going on while they entering the\napartment on the third floor, and on stairway we could hear the steps of the boots and\nthe noise and the argumentation. And then my wife said, there 1s nobody there unless\nmy aunt is. She working too. She 1s not home yet but let me knock on the door. She\nknocked twice which was danger signal. And we also had some rabbits in the\napartment, just in case some neighbors hear some footsteps, we can always say the\nrabbits walking around. And they could hear some noise in there. Is there somebody\nin there? Well, maybe the rabbits. So they broke down the door. They look over.\nThey went to the washroom. They did not discover our hiding place at all, although\nwe are not there no more. They seen the rabbits and said, what are you talking about.\nAnd they left, but they took per purse with her, took her documents with them and\nshe stayed without any papers which was like a death sentence.\nShe discussed this thing with our friends from the Polish Home Army, and they\nsuggested that one of them would go with her to get a copy of it. And she went to the\noffice. Behind was a gentlemen armed just in case. Without any difficulty she got a\ncopy of ID and she left, no problem. During one of the trips on the streetcar they stole\nher purse again. She lost the documents again. Same history repeat itself. She went\nback there and got ID, no problem. I had to occasionally had to run from place to\nplace and I did need ID too, so the Home Army organized arranged for me to go with\nthem to the main office there with my real birth certificate of a person that passed\naway, young man was two years younger than I really was. His name was Wojick\n(ph), Felix Wojick. So I assumed his identity. So this birth certificate, I entered the\nmain office and I received a ID without any difficulty whatsoever, with two guards\nbehind me. No one suspected anything and now I was equipped with real documents,\nand they could check it I was registered everywhere and I was not a Jew anymore.\nBut I had more Semitic looks than Lucine and with a man you know, it was not\ndifficult to suspect something, stop him, put him aside, and take his pants down and\nknow who we are. Because only Jewish man was circumcised and this was the danger\nspot, but I tried to avoid situation like this. So Lucine was working for the Polish\nUnderground actually, indirectly, and all the hiding Jews were doing the same thing.\nThey were taught how to make woman's hair nets. It was a fashionable thing at that\ntime to do. They were taking the car inner-tubes or truck inner-tubes and cutting into\nsmall strips, very narrow strips. Then they could buy white silk and then they are\ndying the silk different colors. Was it a gold, gray, brown or black or navy blue. So\nmaking any net color you desire with the orders they receive. So I was taught by the\ngroup how to wrap this little string of rubber with a silk. So I was making the elastic,\nactually. The other group people were making the nets themself by hand of course.\nAnd somebody design a little cardboard paper how to wrap it around and look very\nprofessionally. And Lucine, as having good Aryan looks with another lady, also\nJewish person, good looks. They were spreading all over the city, market places and\nflea markets etcetera, and our life was more or less stable from then on except I was\nlike a prisoner in my own house which I readily assumed and took. I was taught how\nto do those things and finally our benefactor said, why do you start doing these too\nand do it on the side and Lucine can sell for you too. So be it. We did. We started to\naccumulated a little money. We felt a little more comfortable. We were not that poor\nno more.",
        "A: It was very pathetic. He was little boy. He was like a prisoner. It was hard for him to\nunderstand why he was hiding. He knew he was Jewish. He knew he could not show\nhis face although he had good Aryan looks, but as a kid they could pull his pants\ndown, they know who he ts. So was a sad thing to look at, him to be in hiding all the\ntime. He was pale. He was deprived of the sunlight, sunshine. He couldn't play. I tried\nto be very near him, put arms around him. He miss his parents. He was at the age he\nunderstood. He lost his parents and you couldn't replace it, of course. There were\ntimes that he was questioning, asking if he ever going to see them again and so on. He\nwas still a child and on the other hand he was a grown-up, above his age. The\npolitical situation just forced the people to grow up very fast. So he was aware of\nwhat really the score is and on the other hand, he was only eight or nine years old you\nknow. I couldn't replace his father. I was not old enough to act like a father, but I tried\nto do best I could. I try to be the disciplinarian. Sometimes he want to do certain\nthings he want to do and so I say you cannot do it and I had to be firm. And he tell,\nme you're not my father. I said, I know. I don't pretend to father. But you cannot do it\nbecause all of us would be in danger, you including. So it was a very tragic thing to\nsee him going through all this thing.\nI did not mention that during one of those days that we were together, that we seen,\nwhen we run away from the apartment that the policemen arrested Lucine we went to\nemergency hiding place. That's the time that Lucine run to one of her friends, who\nturned out to be the mistress one of the German Gestapo man. She knew she was\nJewish. She said, what you doing here? She was afraid to tell anything, because we\ndidn't know -- Lucine didn't know who she is now. Is she pro Gestapo or is she going\nto tell everything where we are and then Gestapo come arrest us all. But she finally\ntold her, look, I am doing this because I am desperate myself to save my life you\nknow. But you know I remember your parents. I can help you maybe. So she, Lucine,\ntold her the whole story that the problem now is we don't have apartment anymore.\nWe stay only a few days. We didn't know what to do. Next we have brothers with us\nand she said, you know, what this was is this Hotel Polski, Polish hotel, that the\nGermans with a lot of money taking people and they go to southern France. The\nletters arrive from those people who went on transport to southern France, writing\nback to their relatives in Warsaw. Right at the sea, sunning ourself. Life is different.\nWe waiting for visas to go to South America to North America, to the United States\nand I hope you can join us. And Lucine seen those letters and they are truly letters,\nexcept that these people didn't realize this whole thing was a trick. When we wanted\nto register they said, well, the next transport not going to a week later, but this time it\nwas totally full but if you come up with like $5,000 actually, and we didn't have this\nkind of money. So talking to her friend we said, we cannot afford this kind of thing.\nWe want to go. She said but, you know what, your little brother can take with you for\nnothing, but you have to come up with money. So we said we have no money. So she\npromised to take her little boy with her, and on given day through, going through\ncertain stages of hiding and before reaching that hotel because you went in there was\nonly Jewish people going in and who was going out, only Jewish people. You didn't\nknow if Gestapo waiting outside or not so it was a tricky thing to get in and get out of\nthis hotel and one day we delivered the little boy to this young lady who was very\nnice, and took him under her protection on that trip to so called paradise, southern\nFrance. We did receive one postcard from a train in Germany someplace that\neverything fine from him. It was his writing.\nBut did he really write what he meant? Was he forced to write it? We don't know, but\nthis was the last thing we ever heard. The final thing what we heard actually after of\nthe war, that the whole train went to Northern Germany near Hannover someplace to\na concentration camp and they were all eliminated. So, the whole thing was a stage, a\nplot from the Germans who knew that some Jews were hiding and they paying for the\nsafety to Polish people, but some running out of money so they had to sooner or later\nget out. So they have some money left they could bribe their way by paying to go on\ntransport to Southern France. Unfortunately, we couldn't go. We had no money, not\nthat kind of money. So we stayed without her little brother and we assumed the worst\nbecause we didn't hear nothing for months to come. We suspected he probably\nperished, but for sure we didn't know at that time. Life was going on and Lucine was\nselling her hair nets. I making the hair net and off and on we lost our hiding place due\nto some suspicions that we had, maybe unfounded, but you couldn't take a chance. So\nwe jumped from one place to another one, always in contact with other hiding Jews,\nand they had our name and addresses and we had theirs in case their apartment was\nsuspected of being not in order they run to us. And one day one of her schooling\ngirlfriends notify Lucine that her apartment is no good and her husband 1s going to go\nto Polish Partisan, but he has to wait a few days and needs shelter. So we took him to\nour house, our apartment. He slept to with us, one bed, all three of us. And two days\nlater he left us and went to Polish Underground. I understand he perished there and\nhis wife perished too. So we one day we looking again for another apartment. This\nwas a constant situation every few months we looking for another apartment because\npeople are not stupid and they suspect something and if unfounded even, they might\nsuspect it and you can't take a chance. They might call the police or so. One day she\nmet a lady who was a nanny to one of her Jewish boyfriends when she was little yet,\nand she knew that the lady recognize her already. And they hug and kiss and so and\nshe was a widow. They was peddling some ham, bacon, you know, from store to\nstore. She had one room apartment, little kitchenette, that's all. Lucine told her we're\nwithout apartment. She said, why you don't come to me?\nShe said yea, but, you know who we are? Oh, yes, I know who you are. You know\nwhat we doing? Oh yes I know what your doing but, I have to be paid for it. We have\nlittle money. What will this cost us? Normally reasonable cost us about 50 to 100\nZlotys per month, and I don't remember. I think we paid her 5 or 600 Zlotys. I'm not\nsure exactly the amount. That's what she requested. She was very happy to get that\nkind of money. She was struggling economically. So we moved in. Move in, we\ndidn't have nothing to move in with. A coat, a jacket, a pair of shoes, and I move my\nlittle factory with me. I was making those little hair nets, producing. Lucine was\nselling it. Now, we have to think about safety. I don't flush the toilet because both\nladies, Lucine and this house-lady, were working so I couldn't walk around. I couldn't\nflush the toilet. I waiting until they came back home not to create suspicious. Floors\nwere wooden. You afraid to put your weight down because the floors were squeaking.\nBe very, very, careful. I used to walk on the board next to the wall where the floor\nwas more solid and the planks wooden floor planks were not as flexible so without\ncreating a noise. Then this was in the corner of the room, there was a ceramic heater.\nI don't if you're familiar with European heating system. It's made out of ceramic tiles,\nsquares up to the ceiling almost, and connected to the chimney, and you were heating\nwith coal there. There was a little door, metal door you put your wood or coal this\nwas. Well, I decided to do to hollow out that stove. I disassemble the whole stove.\nLucine would bring me clay each day, a little bit in a bag, a little bag. I use a fork and\na knife to disassemble without cracking the tiles. Don't forget this was old stove, and\nfrom the base on I rebuild the whole stove using clay and water. And I remove the\ntop, the surface, the ceramic tile and I made a wooden planking and put the tile on top\nof the wooden planking so I would get cover. But you have to heat it so what are you\ngoing to do. So we bought a little iron stove with a pipe. The pipe was going right in\nthe middle of the stove into the chimney. There was a little stool and a table next to\nthe stove in case of emergency. I could step on the stool on the table inside the stove.\nI was sitting like on horseback on the pipe. Only thing I forgot not being professional,\nwhat am I going to do if the pipe 1s going to be hot because the stove is being used for\ncooking?\nDidn't think about it and I didn't think about the possible gases emanating from this\ncontraption. I was not a scientist. I'm not a professional bricklayer or stove layer,\nwhatever. But it served purpose and I hope I would never have to use it. All of a\nsudden one day we find out that the landlady had a cousin in the village near Warsaw,\nwho one day came in drunk, total drunk, and when he knocked at the door, I had only\nmaybe a minute time to get into the stove. I got in the stove. He came in. They tried\nto get rid of him, he was so drunk they couldn't. Oh, no. I stay here overnight. I go\nhome tomorrow. So I stayed in the stove all night. When he left following morning, I\nwas totally unconscious, overcome by fumes. They couldn't call a doctor. They\ncouldn't pull me out because very awkward, was way up top to the ceiling. They were\ntwo women, one old lady. Lucine was young but alone she couldn't do. I was a\nheavyweight person and I started moving a little bit, but I was semiconscious and I\ngot out of that stove and they try to breathe in my mouth, artificial respiration,\nspringing water, splashing water on me, and so on, and I come to it and I recovered.\nThis was my first experience in hiding place like this. The other experience, I had,\nanother cousin, a woman came one day with a little poodle or a dog, small dog. I had\nno time to get to the stove. There was a cabinet against the wall so I hid in cabinet\nbehind coats and so on. All of a sudden, that little poodle start barking, coming\ntoward the cabinet and barking and barking and barking. Didn't want to leave, and\nthis cousin of this house-lady said, what are you barking? What do you see in that\ncabinet? Oh, I probably have a little ham there. I'm peddling ham, and so on. He\nprobably want this. So she brought a piece of ham to the dog, give him the ham and\nhe ate it and stopped barking. And there were few episodes like this where I was\nhiding. But each time I escape without any problems. Until one day our benefactor\nfrom the Home Army came to me and said to me, be prepared because the Polish\nUnderground is staging an uprising. In the meantime, prior to this of course, we're\nlocated next to the former ghetto. We see the ghetto burning.\nWe see people dancing and 1s laughing outside the ghetto walls saying the Jewish bed\nbugs are frying. Finally, we got rid of them and so on, you know. I didn't hear it\nmyself. I just heard the noise. I heard the explosions in the ghetto. This was the\nJewish uprising and we didn't hear no cries. Nothing, just explosions, shots, and then\nthe fire and eventually of course, after almost what? Less than a month, the whole\nghetto uprising, went under and the Germans sealed up the area and there was no\nmore ghetto. Then our captain came and said you better start storing some food\nbecause there is going to be uprising Warsaw proper. We don't be able to get anything\nat all. If you have any money left, any savings or so, buy something for it because the\nmoney will be worth nothing. Prior to this, he came to us once and he took a loan\nfrom us. He needed money to transport some Jewish people. He had no money to\nsave them. So he was selling whatever he could, his own things to pay for the upkeep\nof those people. We gave him the money. He returned the money to us eventually. So\nLucine bought some rings that's all you could buy in the jeweler stores. You couldn't\nbuy nothing else but wedding rings. We ended up with several, maybe 10 or 11 rings\nwhich we could not get rid of afterwards. After the war they are worth practically\nnothing. The uprising started. Our Polish captain said, I want you to be part of our\ngroup. We won't ask you to fight directly for us, it's not your fight. I said, your fight is\nmy fight. You saved my life. Whatever you want me to do, I will do. We need\nsomebody to attack the German warehouses to steal the provisions, food for our\nsoldiers and so on. It's under fire. And, I agreed to it immediately, and at night we're a\ngroup of five, six people from the Home Army ,Underground don't forget the\nbasements were connected to each house next to each other. They cut through the\nwalls of each house so we did not have to be on the surface, which was deadly, but\nunderground we moving the whole underground city. We moving from one end of\nWarsaw to the other end underground. And that's how we knew which was the exit\nwhere to go, where the warehouses were and when we grabbed the supplies, what we\ncould of course, we didn't have no transportation. All on our backs, you know, and\npockets, pants, hands, you tied to your belt, whatever you could.\nWe disappear in the underground. The German looking for us and couldn't find us.\nWe disappear. Then that's how we brought the supplies for the fighting boys you\nknow. Then the Germans seen that the uprising 1s continuing and decided to do more\ndrastic type of move and they decided to bomb the city. In the meantime, the political\nsituation change all bad. We already knew that the Soviet troops on the other side of\nWisla River, which the eastern part of Warsaw.\u2019 The name is Prague, like city of\nPrague in Czechoslovakia. People were hiding there that were liberated. We on the\nwestern part were not liberated yet. Some Jews thought that in case they have to die\nnow they try to swim through the Wisla River on the other side going east, and they\ncaught by the German fire of course. Some of them try to support themself with their\nhands under the bridge, holding on to different pipes and cables, only holding on with\ntheir hands cross the bridge underneath to reach the other side, and some of them\nsucceeded. Some of our friends did succeeded to do that. It requires a tremendous\nphysical strength to do that unless you accustomed to it. And many people\nundernourished and weak and so on couldn't do it. Even swimming through the Wisla\nRiver in the part of Warsaw which was pretty wide and deep was suicidal, so we\nwouldn't dare. So we took our fate the way it is. So the German troops start to\nbombing the city and they done it systematically, street after street, so we knew\nwhich street bomb today, so we knew which street would be bombed tomorrow. So\nrunning from one type of a block to another block, but the bombing caught up with us\nfinally. We are at our home, our home, our apartment that we stay with the Polish\nlady which I mentioned before selling ham and etcetera, etcetera. The bomb hit one\nof our wings and the whole stairway collapsed. Lucine was upstairs. She went right\nonto the main floor under the rubble. I couldn't get to the other side to save her so I\ntook a plank, a wide plank, maybe a foot wide. It was a corner wing and so I put one\nend of the plank on the window frame, the other plank was four story and the other\nwindow, and all my fours I crossed from one wing to the other one, not looking\ndown. Because if I look down I probably get dizzy and go down, and I was able to\nreach her area and recover her by pulling her.\nI see her legs sticking out and by pulling her, debris and bricks and cement and piece\nof wood and so on. She sustained fairly intensive injury and her whole right side of\nthe face, ear, neck, chest, breast, right side of abdomen, was scraped from falling\ndebris and so on. Bleeding so on, I was wounded in the mean time. I don't know what\nfrom. It was a piece of shrapnel I thought. My abdomen, I was bleeding a little bit but\nI felt good otherwise. I put her on my back and carried her on my back to the first aid\nstation. There were signs in the city where the first aid station don't forget it was our\n*Wisla River: Vistula River.\narea, the Polish Home Army not the German area yet, and I found my way to what\nthey say is the lazarett.\u00b0 The lazarett and the first aid with the red cross on it. I bring\nher on my back. I crawl in practically through the door and whom do I find is a\ndoctor. I almost fainted. Then with together with Lucine on my back, my classmate\nwho was my partner in crime and was supposed to be executed by firing squad, he\nwas hiding in Warsaw. He finished his medical school underground. He just\nwhispered to me, we don't know each other, and that was all, I was the only one.\nLucine was the only one who get tetanus shot. There was not tetanus for nobody. She\nwas the only one who received it. They tended her wounds and so on. Squeeze my\nhands and couldn't hug and kiss each other and just wish each other best of luck and\nwe left. And after several weeks, few weeks, I think about a month, the uprising went\ndown under. German triumphed and they announced loudspeakers, all the inhabitants\nof Warsaw now going to be evacuated to a camp near Warsaw by foot. We walked\nseveral kilometers by foot to a little town name Pruszkow.\nI was wearing my uniform, had my bandages on. Lucine had bandages on and at that\ntime nobody suspected any Jews left, and we approaching the camp we see a doctor\nthere and several nurses. Lucine thought they were nuns. They were not nuns. They\nwere nurse and I told them I am a medical student and one of the doctor said \"go to\nthe right, go to the right.\" This was the building -- I forgot the number of the building.\nWe didn't know where to go to right or not. The first intuition was maybe we\nshouldn't, but why would he steer us wrong. He 1s not working for the Poles, not for\nGermany. As we found a lot of older people meantime getting out of one barrack to\nanother one, and we see an older lady, old lady on a stretcher lying there, moaning,\nand no one was there. So I grab another guy. Why don't you help me get this lady to\nthe barracks, and we carry the lady that behind us and they thought that we're part of\nthe troop over there caring for the sick and disabled, etcetera. We came to there\nbarrack and we see a lot of elderly people, sick people and so on. And at this time I\nwonder if we made the right decision cause we know from the ghetto days yet, sick\nand disabled people are garbage. They going to be destroyed. Why didn't they put us\nwith the younger people? We young people, young really. Younger people just go to\nGermany to work, but this was no way out. There a guard at the door. If you want to\nget out, even go to the washroom or something, there some containers and the women\nand men together.\nEnd of Tape #2\n\u2018lazarett: (German). Hospital or clinic.\nTape #3",
        "A: So we looking around the barracks and seeing all the older people we don't know\nwhat we're doing there actually. And a thought went through our minds, and maybe\nthis a group of peoples going to go for final resolutions of their problems. Probably\nAuschwitz or so, and then after two or three nights staying on straw mats on the floor,\nyou lying down one night, you woke up the next night about three feet away because\nthe straw mats were moving. That's how people were talking about, lice, horrible\nsituation there, and they one morning they decided to let us out the of the barracks\nand direct us toward the railroad track where open cars, cattle cars. While to me this\nwas nothing new. I read it very well and I knew what's happening now. First thought\nwas, we probably going to go to Auschwitz or one of those places. But the young\npeople think maybe this get to Germany for work. But the old people, sick people,\npeople on stretchers and so on that's what they do with us. They seal the cars, but\nthrough the upper little windows they actually wired type of upper portion. The car\nwere wired. You could see through and standing on somebody's shoulders you could\nsee outside. I seen there were only two guards, soldiers or what ever, Gestapo I'm not\nsure who they were. One near the locomotive, the beginning of the train and one at\nthe end. This was not really clear to me what the purpose of this transport. Where are\nwe going? Nobody knew. Everybody was asking the same question. People were\nsquashed like cattle, you know. About maybe close to 100 people in the car. Woman,\nman, there were no toilet facilities of course, and people just relieving themselves the\nway they were, standing and so on. And everybody, you know, without any\nconcentration. The fear, you know, not knowing where we going. I was conditioned\nto it a little bit, and the other Poles weren't. The rest the Poles weren't, so that's the\nfirst experience they had. So I was kind of over hand but the final destination was still\nthe same. So what am I going to win here? We going to go together as a Pole maybe,\nbut still. All of a sudden one night one very important railroad stations.\nThe place was bombed by allies. They destroyed the railroad lengths you know, and\nthe train couldn't go any further. This detained us for about two or three days until\nthey repaired the tracks. And to say there were no food given, no water given, there\nwere no people outside. There was nothing and then the car start rolling again and\nafter unknown number of days, we are arrived in a little town. The name was\nJedrzejow a town with maybe 8, 10,000 people and all of a sudden the train stopped.\nThe car doors open up. Polish Red Cross appeared. Woman with band, red cross on it\nand they directing this car, this car going left, this car going straight, the other car\ngoing to the right and we found ourselves in front of many horse carriages, you know,\ndriven by the local peasants. And in front of the carriages there were tables and Polish\nwoman was sitting there registering everybody. They want your IDs. So you give\nIDs. I was in railroad uniform at this time. My wife was with me and registered, and\nshe assigned us to a certain village, to a peasant that was forced to take us as guests\nand to feed us and be responsible for us. And they let us go free. We didn't go in any\njail. We didn't go to any concentration camp. No one ever informed us what going to\nhappen, nothing until this moment. We're driven, by, it turn out later, by the mayor of\nthis little village to a different farmer. He brought us there, knocked at the door. Here\nthey are and he left. Of course, we speak very fluent and clean, very intelligent\nPolish. Peasant Polish 1s a little different Polish and they hate the city people you\nknow, and he told me right away in slang, \"I am not taking freeloaders to my house. I\ncannot afford you people.\" I said \"I was wounded. Lucine was wounded too, my wife,\nyou know.\" She was bandaged up. I said, but \"look, as soon as we feel better we\ngoing to help you. We help you on the farm.\" He said, \"I'm not going to take no\nbody.\" And, he shut the door. We standing there maybe, most of the day outside. It\nwas cold. Mind you this was already either end of October or so, beginning of\nNovember, it was cold, raining.\nWe hugged each other, standing, didn't know what to do. He refused to take us in and\nwe stayed like this way all night under the little roof, thinking what next. Early in the\nmorning, the mayor of the village appeared there. Allegedly, he knew that we were\nnot taken in by this farmer. He asked us to go with him. We didn't have no luggage\nwith us, of course. So we walked with him. He took us to the only building made out\nof brick. The rest were huts and he say, you stay in this house now, and the people\nwalked out, the farmer, middle age people. Maybe she was 40, 42, he was maybe 45,\nwith two little kids and very friendly invited us in. Knowing that we were wounded\nso they give us their own bedroom and bed so we can sleep and rest. She said she\nmaking chicken for me, chicken broth and so on and so on. Very, very friendly and\naccepting us, and feeling sorry for us probably. Well, at this moment I didn't care. I\njust wanted to lie down and rest. I didn't feel good. I was sick. I was weak. I was\nbleeding a little bit. All the turmoil and what was happening next and so on. I didn't\nlook beyond that moment. The same night I woke up with a light flashing in my face.\nWho are you? I thought maybe Gestapo. Right away you know you always live with\nthat fear it's always in your end. And here was a man said, I am from the underground\nfrom Home Army in this area, we heard that you people were from Warsaw, uprising\nfrom Warsaw, and we just want to tell you we very apologetic we couldn't come to\nyour help. You know, those days you couldn't take a train or trucks or cars to Warsaw\nto help the other groups of the Home Army you know but he said they couldn't do\nnothing for us and so on but they make sure not a hair on our head here in this village.\nAs a matter of fact, they hear about the other farm and they took care of him already.\nThey went that night before they came to us. They woke up the whole family, the\nfarmer refuse our entry asked him to strip completely from the waist down. Bent over\na trunk of a tree and so on they beat him up with some ... branches of trees and so on.\nThey were bleeding. They beat up the whole family. The farmer, his wife, his\ngrown-up sons and so on. The farmer beg us to return to his home, but we didn't\nknow. We didn't have nothing to do with them beating them up. But they aware that\nwe're from Warsaw uprising. They thought that we really some important people\nfrom the Home Army, which we're not. I was a small fish there, you know. But,\nanyway I was proud to be one of them and he said they make sure that if we need a\ndoctor they provide medical me care and so on and nothing would happen to us. And\nbelieve me our care was the best care any hospital could give us and after I got a little\nbetter, I got worse again and I got sick with high fever and yellow jaundice. My\nnights were horrible. I didn't know what I was talking about. Lucine said I was\ntalking nonsense through my sleep and so on. They were scared I might die,\ntemperature 103, 104, yellow jaundice, you know. Finally, the farmer said I take you\nto the doctor, I'm sorry. Can't let you dies like this. So he took his two horses, you\nknow, and his wagon, you know, and took me to nearest town. There was Polish\ndoctor there. This town was about 15 or 20 kilometers away. In the meantime, Lucine\nwas very, she recovered faster than I did. and she was very helpful in the farmhouse.\nShe was helping with chickens and cooking and peeling potatoes and bringing in\nwater and whatever was necessary and feeding the pigs, you know. And they liked it\nvery much because they, we didn't have to be paid for it. You know, they just\nsupported us. And they were very grateful for this. It showed the way they treated us.\nAnd I was just a victim of this. I was in no shape to do any of it. And I went to this\ndoctor, was on the second floor. I remember like today they had to practically carry\nme upstairs. I couldn't walk straight. There was a little waiting room. There was no\none in the waiting room, but I had to wait. To my left was a little table. On the little\ntable was a little box, looked like from medical instrument something. I glance at the\nbox. There was a label on it. Dr. Grayefski (ph) Praga, Warsaw. Just I notice this\nthat's all. I was still in my uniform. That's the only clothes I had. Finally the door\nopens up. The nurse calls me in, said Mr. Woyick? I said, yes. And she asked me my\nhistory, what happened to me and so on. So I told her the whole story about Warsaw\nuprising, my wounds. my wife being hurt and so on, I thought maybe a results of this\nresult of my wounds, you know.\n06:12:\nSo they wrote everything down. The doctor comes in and he said what's your name?\nAnd I said Wojick. He looks at my uniform. Where you from? I said, Warsaw. Are\nyou a railroad man? I said, yes. Which division, department? I said, we're Prague.\nYou must know me. I was your doctor of the railroad. So I look at him, look at him,\nlook at him. I said, \"you're not by any chance Dr. Grayefski?\" He said, of course I\nam. You know me. This name I memorize from this little box on the table. And from\nthen on was such a bond, such a contact, you know. I didn't worry about any\nsuspicions or so. He gave me a shot. I turned back, he gave me a shot. He didn't know\nwho was, nothing else. Gave me some vitamins, some medications and so on. I went\nback home and from then on I started my miraculous recovery. The people were nice\nto me. There were some other Warsaw refugees there, Polish refugees. One was a\nshoemaker and I felt very uneasy about him. For some reason he look at me all the\ntime and I was worrying if he maybe recognize me from somewhere or suspect who I\nam. And during Easter holidays he invited us, me and Lucine to his house. He was all\nalone. I think he was single, but he was middle age person. And we would talked. He\nask me questions, where I from and so on. Very inquisitive you know, which school I\nwent to. So I told him, Lublin. I told him the story. I told him all these things which\nwas true. My Polish misled everybody because my Polish was the best, if I brag about\nit, one thing, I brag my language. I speak several languages my Polish is exquisite. Is\nperfect, really perfect, literately Polish. They couldn't understand it because Jews\ndon't speak that kind of Polish. None of the Jews. So, but he never said nothing. He\nwas very cordial. Treated us, Polish sausage and this and then apologize he not a\ngood cook, but he done what he could. By being fellow from Warsaw and so on we\nhave something in common, he thought he invite us be the holidays with him. He\ndidn't want to be alone. And slowly I was recovering. Then I got the idea how could I\nrepay those peasants, for they're their ... being so good to us. And I thought since the\nschools were illegal and schools closed I would organize a secret Polish school. And I\nsuspected that mayor of the village was somebody that maybe I don't know exactly\nwho he was. He was more than just the mayor. And one day I approached him. I said,\nyou know what? I feel strong enough. I like to teach the children Polish language to\nread.\nLittle math, geography, whatever I can, and the political situation. Let them be aware\nof what was going on now. But I have no books. How we going to get books? The\narea we located was far away from our normal area where we used to live you know.\nI didn't know anyone there. o he said, \"well, I'll tell you. I'll give you a name. You can\ngo to next village.\" As a matter of fact, on Sunday I go to the town. Maybe I take you\nwith me, in the wagon, and then I don't know want to go with you, to this place, to\nthat person. Just tell them I send you and you tell them what you need. But I said I\ndon't have money either -- \"don't worry about that, just don't worry about that. Just\ntell him what need.\" I will straighten it out. And I met this person. He looked at me\nsuspicious look, asked for my IDs, my documents. Asked I was from Home Army. I\nsaid, yes, I was wounded during the uprising. So he had no reason to doubt me, which\nwas true. I didn't say who I was. He gave me about ten difference books. Polish\nreadings, simple arithmetics, art, crayons, all the pencils, all the little things, erasers.\nHere I am, educational director. I'm organizing a school. I took the kids together in\none house. I told them what we going to do and I told them we have to be smart about\nit because if the German find out that we have a secret school, they are going to burn\nthe village and we have to have a school. So we taught the kids that each day, one of\nthe kids, they were mostly boys if I remember, will stand guard outside on the top, on\nthe roof of the house. Our village was top of the hill so you can see the road down\nthere in the next town. If the Germans coming to the village, they had to come to this\nroad. So if you watch this road, you will find out who was coming to the village.\nThen you can take proper precautions. We told the kids if anything suspicious, right\naway they dispenses each one runs to his own house. Each one runs, takes the book\nwith him right away, there not be a trace left of any educational type material on the\ntables. And we conduct school very nicely with no problem, with no difficulty. Kids\nwere very nice. They obey. And one day during the classes, all of a sudden a door\nopens up and two men with hats, long gray leather coats, boots, typical Gestapo\ndetectives walk in. And right away ask me, \"Are you Mr. Wojick?\" Well, I don't have\nto tell you how I felt.\nI knew this was it, someone denounces me. You come with us. I was ready to faint.\nTry to regain my composure. Tried to ask him what it's all about. They said \"you go\nwith us.\" I walked out into the hallway, and they stopped. They start shaking my\nhand. We came in on orders of the Polish Government Exile who found out that\nsomeone is organizing a secret Polish education for the children, and we just want to\nthank you and congratulate you. We want to assure you that the end of the problem is\nsoon. The war is almost at the end. The Germans are losing the war. There was no\nnews. We don't know nothing. The Russian Army is advancing and they should be\nhere within weeks probably, and with this they left. Until today I don't know what\nhappened to that boy on the roof of the house, that he didn't detect the two men\nwalking in there. Could be Gestapo. Anyway, I was continuing teaching then all of a\nsudden we heard rumblings from the front nearby, the noise of the war. The\nexplosions and the artillery was getting louder, louder every day and of course, our\nhope was building up each minute. But the awareness that we could lose our lives, the\nend, the last hour of life was still with me. And I decided one day one of the sons of\nthe neighbor came in. Was a member of the Polish Underground but a different\nunderground what they used to call the N.S.Z.\u00b0 which a Polish nationalist alliance\ngroup, together with Polish Hitlerites, they just found in the forest a bunker, a\nwoman, two children, hidden. So they killed them. He came to our house to tell us\nabout it. Thought we would rejoice it, and we had, I had to hear that. And he told us\nthat he's leaving, go west with the Germans because the Russians are coming in. If\nthey catch him he will be sent to Siberia because his group was cooperating with the\nGermans, of course. And he left. I talked to the peasants, my friends now. I said,\n\"You know, I would like to meet the Russians. Said, please, please don't, and Mr.\nWoyick don't do that. They won't come here anyway. Don't do that it's dangerous.\nYou don't want to go in the field of action, but I had to go there.\nSo I was crawling out the village on all my fours. There was a little forest next the\n\u00b0N.S.Z.: Narodowe Sily Zbrojne. Soviet backed Polish partisans\nvillage and I could see the tanks for maybe, like a hundred feet away, only the\nRussian tanks. I recognize the star on the tank and I recognize their faces because\ntheir head was up out the tank, you know, looking with field glasses where they are or\nsomething, and I start getting up, to try to greet them and they start shooting at me.\nThe tank, thank Gods, the they didn't hit me, didn't get near me. You know, I crawled\nright back, right back to the village scared stiff. Before I knew it the Russian entered\nthe village. They asked for the mayor and asked how many people there was in the\nvillage and so on. And I was stopped. They asked me who I was. I speak fluent\nRussian so I said, \"I'm the teacher here.\" Then the Russian tell him I'm also a Jew. He\nsaid, \"A Jew. You're lying, there are no Jews here. You must be a spy. How come you\nspeak Russian? Only a spy speak Russian. And the Jews, there are no Jews left. They\nare all killed.\" I said, \"That's not true. Myself and my wife, we escaped and we hiding\nunder false names.\" \"False names, you must be a spy,\" and I said, \"No, I'm telling you\nIam Jewish.\" And he said, wait and minute, and he called another officer. His name\nwas Lev. I remember like today. It was a typical Jewish first name in Russian. Lev,\ncome over here. Take a load of this. This guy telling me he is a Jew. Now, you\nJewish. You find out. He comes to me and about 45-year-old man. He said, I am from\nLeningrad. I'm a plumber by profession. I'm officer in the Russian Tank Division.\n\u201cNow, you tell me you're Jewish.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d So he start talking me Yiddish. I do\nnot understand Yiddish. \u201cYou tell me you're Jewish and you don't understand\nYiddish.\u201d \u201cI don't. Because my family always spoke Polish to me. My parents spoke\nYiddish. I understand Yiddish. I can tell you what you say. But I can not talk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way. No Jew--If you Jewish, you speak Yiddish.\u201d I said, \u201cBelieve me. I\nam a Jew but I do not speak Yiddish.\u201d \u201cNo, you cannot be a Jew. He might be right.\nYou must be a spy. How come you speak Russian?\u201d So, I told him my story. I was in\nLvov medical school, I learn Russian from some colleagues that spoke Russian and I\ntold him and he said that's all baloney, I don\u2019t believe one word you say, you must be\na spy. Then .I remember a prayer in Hebrew. At that time rabbi that come to my home\nteach me a few things. I forgot most of it but I remember one prayer. I said, wait a\nminute. You know how to pray?\nHe said, well, I forgot. I said, but if I tell you a prayer will you remember that? He\nsaid, yes. So I start praying in Hebrew, just the beginning of the prayer. I don't\nremember too much of it. He look at me, look at me, he start crying. ... He was close\nto me. He put his arms around me. He embraced me, hugged me, kissed me. Said,\nyeah, you are Jewish. This was all in Russian. I didn't want the Poles to know that I\nam Jewish. I asked him that please, I don't want to disappoint them. They were so\nnice to us. We going to leave the area very soon. He told us where to go, how to get\nto our home, where my hometown was. I don't have to tell you the good-bye was very\nsad. ... The village's, the mayor, they want me to stay. They gave me a school. They\nwant me to stay and be their teacher there. They give me a little plot of land next to\nthe school. They--you were good to us. Our kids adore you. Why don't you stay here.\nYou don't have to worry about nothing and the war is over. Start from scratch. I said,\nlook, my hometown is Lublin. I have to go and put the pieces together. Maybe,\nmaybe, somehow I can find anybody from the family. I don't know where they are,\nyou know. Warsaw destroyed too and I lie a little bit and say I look for a family in\nWarsaw and so on, and they did understand. And on the way out the mayor squeezed\nmy hand and I do feel he knew who I was. ... And, one morning the peasants, they\nprepared a little bag for us, food, you know. They made us handmade kind of boots\nyou know, made out of felt and rabbit fur for Lucine, you know. It was cold. We had\nnothing, no coats, nothing and with their blessing we left. And we walked by foot\nmaybe 80 kilometers cold, winter, 20 below. ...We crossed to a little town, a little\nvillage.\nWe seen a man standing in front of a little shack, red head, he looked typical Jewish.\nThere is a word in Hebrew, they say amcho, amcho means are you one of us? Means\nare you our people. And I ask him amcho? He look at me he was afraid to say\nanything. Even the Russian there already. He was still scared. Finally I said don't be\nafraid. We are, but Lucine don't look at all. And I said what are you doing here? I\nsurvive in the forests in the bunker and everybody is killed. I said to him, I don't\nknow what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't have anybody to talk to and the\nvillagers were not friendly to me. I said, why don't you go to Palestine. He said, I\ndon't know what I'm going to do. Anyway, he asked us if we need anything, bread or\nsomething? We had some supplies and I said no, and thanked them and we parted,\ntotal stranger. We found our way to our hometown and here already was a Jewish\ncommittee working, organizing. The first thing we did was approach the Red Cross,\ntry to find out if my wife's little brother survived or not. We knew his name was\nKowalski on his papers and there was a name Kowalski as surviving one the camps\nbut turned out to be not him. We later found out that he perished in one the transports\nat that time and one of the concentrations camps forgot the name near Hannover in\nGermany. We registered in the Jewish Committee and tried to look for survived who\nwas left. We had a large family, over a hundred people. Anybody ask for is not there.\nOne day I went to my home, used to live, our home. Our whole family lived there. I\nthought maybe some neighbors, maybe she seen somebody. Anyone survive would\ncome to the place where you were born where you live. You have to start some place.\nTo my amazement they all crossed themselves to see I survived. Most of them very\ngrateful I did survive. Because they were good to my family, my family good to them.\nWe owned the building. My grandfather actually, not my parents, and he said, you\nknow what? One of your uncle, he survived. He was here. He tried to sell the\nbuilding. I said, how can you sell the building. First, it is not his.\nNumber two, how can he think about selling something, you know, when you looking\nfor members of family. You thinking about the house. Who cares? He is in uniform. I\nknew who it was. It was a younger brother of my father who used to be a lieutenant in\nPolish Air Force. And they told me where I could reach him. In a small apartment\nthere. When he seen me he put his arms around me, but rather coldly I would say,\nlike, he was not surprise I'm around. More or less. \"Oh, that's your wife.\" \"Yes, that's\nmy wife.\" He introduce himself. He was wearing a Polish officer uniform, looked\nmuch like a movie star, and I said, I don't know what do now. Is anybody left? He\nsaid, \"yes, my younger brother with my other uncle and my father's youngest brother\nis alive. He is in Yugoslavia. He was a musician. He was right under Marshall Tito.\nHe organized a military band for Marshall Tito in Yugoslavia when he lost his family\nhis little son in Rovno.\" If you remember, a little town east Poland when I escape\nfrom my home and I went to Lvov. This was him. He lost his wife, lost his little son.\nAnd he escaped through the mountains, Carpathian Mountains to Czechoslovakia,\nHungary, to Yugoslavia. He survived there he might be on his way home now. He's\nlooking for his wife, maybe he finds her. So he said, \"that's the key to my apartment.\"\nYou can only stay there maybe two days because I need the apartment myself. He\nwas single. He was dating already and so on. He needed his apartment and I couldn't\nget to my house either because other people lived there. My house but I couldn't kick\npeople out of there. So, in meantime, we met other friends of ours from high school\nyet. Lucine's friend and so on. So we managed to rent a little room someplace and so\non, and each day going the Jewish Committee to see whom we going to find because\nthis was a gathering place. That if someone survive, had to go there first and look at\nthe list of registrants. Who is there. Everyone coming home. Unfortunately nobody\nelse came from my family. And one day my uncle asked me, what you plan to do? I\nsaid, I promised my mom that if I survive ever I go back to school. He said, if you\ndon't want to be musician you want to be a doctor, do whatever you want to be but\npursue your career. And I felt I promises I should do it and that's what I want to do.\nSo we went to a town. The name is Breslow in Polish. I register in medical school and\nthe first words I was noticing I heard of students. Students themselves saying \"\nanother Jewish student.\" Another, Hitler didn't kill them all and this was in my mind\nin every place I turn around. I was not used to it because in my high school days the\nkids knew I was Jewish but never told me you're, a Jew. I knew who I was I. I didn't\nhave to be reminded about it. After the war things were worse. Instead of telling me\nI'm so happy you survived. Did anyone else survive? Can we do anything for you?\nCan we help you, books whatever? They tell me another Jew survive. It was like a\nburden on my mind and I was kind of crowded in this classroom, you know. I didn't\nfeel good there. And I met contact with some other students, not medical school.\nJewish students who were architecture, art and so on and we organize a student group\nin this town who performed music, dancing for the remaining Jewish refugees that\ncame back from Russian. Everyone was coming and going nobody stay in one place.\nMore people coming, some going away, gone to look for relatives and so on. The\nborders were open. You can go through in and out nobody ask you any questions.\nWhere are you going? Looking for my mother, looking for my father, looking for my\nbrother, looking for anybody, and everybody understood this. So there was a kind of a\nchaos on the border but it was not used up as a chaotic type of political purpose or so.\nEverybody knew this was a purpose of family reunions, and we one day in this group\neverybody was saying remarks, you know, that we shouldn't stay here. We shouldn't\nstay here. So we thought maybe we should leave Poland and go someplace outside of\nPoland. Czechoslovakia, Austria maybe, France, we didn't know yet. So this was in\nthe talkative stages and in the meantime, my uncle didn't show too much a ties to me.\nAnd he was doing his things, busy dating and doing other things you know. And in\nmeantime, he was arrested. He was the commanding officer of the Polish Pilot school.\nInstructor and commanding officer there for stealing a blanket or something, selling\non the black market. That was what he was accused of. Could be they wanted to get\nrid of him too because he was Jewish. They knew he was Jewish see, and was he\nthrown out. I never found out.\nI know he went to jail, maybe two years in jail. In the meantime, I was without any\nmoney and so on, so I decided to sell my house. It was a beautiful building. But I\ndidn't have nothing to live on. No suits, no dress for my wife, nothing. So I\napproached somebody who was an attorney. If you have any customer for the\nbuilding and said, yes, and found a butcher, Polish butcher want to buy my building. I\nsaid, why you pay the building? Everything is nationalized by the Soviets. You\ncannot own it. They said I know, but I made so much money during the Germans\ntimes, illegally slaughtering cattle and so on, I had all this cash lying around. I won't\nbenefit. Maybe someday my kids will benefit from it. They'll have the building at\nleast. I said, okay. I sold it for $1,000. The attorney took $400 so I was left with $400\nAmerican dollar which was a fortune. I buy a new suit. The only picture I have right\nnow is in the museum is with Lucine when we both were dressed. She bought a new\nhat. I bought a suit and shoes and we are in the park, and our kids look at the picture,\nDad, you don't look like you just survived the war. You look like you came from a\ncountry club. I was shaven, lean, smiling, pale maybe, but smiling. I said, look, we're\nyoung. We cannot bring back what we lost. We can live with the past, we can live\nwith our memories. We can start from scratch and build our home again from the\nbeginning. So that's what we did. I bought her a delayed wedding present. I bought\nher a ring, small ring and a watch, gold watch with the money and one day the whole\ngroup, with the help of Bricha. I don't know if you know who Bricha is. Bricha is the\nPalestinian underground agency which is helping the Jews escape from Soviet Russia\ncoming to Poland want to go to Palestine. They were smuggling those people, those\nyoung people to Palestine. With their assistance we crossed the border one cold night\nin November, 1946. The only thing I took we me is my student papers, my books and\nso on in case I ever go back to school and to save my papers. And on their advice\nthey took us to Vienna. We met a lot of Jewish students already, Americans, first time\nI seen Americans, life full of music and laughter. I didn't know what it was. I didn't\nknow how to behave. I was afraid of this thing. I thought it was sacrilegious; to laugh\nand to smile and go to night clubs, coffee houses.\nI couldn't cope with it. I wasn't ready for it you know. But we stayed together the\nwhole group for about 2 year and one when his own way. They graduated -- one\narchitecture, one electrical engineer, few medical students. One boy couldn't cope\nwith the situation. Went back to Poland, Jewish boy. Didn't know what happened to\nhim. And, then each one went his own way. With the help of the American Joint\nCommittee we getting a stipend to pay for our tuition. To my amazement when they\naccepted me to medical school they accept all the papers translated by the Jewish\nCommittee in Vienna found out I need my high school diploma which I didn't have\nwith me. I didn't know what happened to it. But my high school still stand. I wrote to\nLublin. They sent me a copy of my high school diploma. For whatever strange\nreason, I had 6 years of Latin and a degree of Latin was a dash, like I never had Latin.\nThe professor looks at it. I'm sorry everything is in order but you have no Latin. You\nhave to take a pre-entrance exam in Latin. I said you know if after all these years I\ndon't know if I remember too many things and my German was very poor. I just\nstarted learning German. What language do you speak? Polish, Russian. Okay. You\nspeak Russian. I speak Russian. So he give me two days to come back and take an\nexam in Latin in the Russian language which I did and I passed it. He said, I want to\nknow if you ever took Latin. It is not exam for grading. I want to know if you were\nacquainted with Latin, if you remember something and so on, which I did many\nthings. And he was satisfied. He gave me a passing grade and here I was back in\nmedical school. So, we struggled quite a bit. It was very difficult financially, but the\nZionist Organization in Vienna, helped us out. They rent a school for the whole group\nof us. And we lived in that school. They fed us, warm, you know. They gave us\nblankets, gave us suits, you know, from American Joint. We felt like human beings.\nWe did regain our dignity, slowly, and one day somebody came to us and said, you\nknow what? I just came back from the British Zone in Germany and I was on a train\nto Germany. Run into somebody who 1s a relative of yours. So I said, what? What's\nhis name? So, he mentioned first name Baruch, Baruch. I don't have anybody in my\nfamily named Baruch. Then Lucine remembered, you know what, that my cousin,\nwho was our only witness on our wedding in Warsaw ghetto.\nHe must be him. Well that\u2019s the address. We wrote a letter to him. He wrote back. It\nwas him. He survived the concentration camp in Germany. He made contact with an\naunt in New York City. It was his real aunt. It was my wife's second line aunt actually\nbecause the aunt with the baby in the Warsaw ghetto that went to the Hotel Polski\nwas her sister in New York. But we wrote a letter to them. We didn't ask for anything,\nbut they start showering us with gifts, packages, food, chocolates, cigarettes. I didn't\nsmoke. I was selling on black market. He, her uncle asked me if I needed anything.\nHe can send me to Vienna. He said, \"do you want papers?\" I try to get you papers to\ncome to United States. But first you have to graduate and get your diploma. Don't you\never come to the States without diploma. You'd be nobody. If you be medical doctor\nthen you be somebody. Your future be assured. As difficult it might be for now, I\nremind you of a family in New York, mind you, people I never met, I never knew,\nLucine never met, never knew. She knew of this them but was a distant family\nthrough marriage of her uncle. He start sending me packages of certain things,\nmedication. I sell on black market. And we live like kings then. So after graduate\nmedical school, we throw a party for maybe 50 people, our friends and so on like one\nfamily. We became one 93 family all the refugee, students and their relatives were all\none family. They substitute for our lost brothers and sisters. Their parents were our\nparents. We used to call them mom and dad, you know. Some of them fortunately\nsurvived, some parents of my colleagues. They were very good to us and it helped us\nto regain our composure you know and maybe regain faith in humanity. And slowly\nwe registered in American Embassy, and here we met a little difficulty with one lady.\nThis was the time of Korean War. We registered with all the proper documents. We\ngot a visa to enter United States. The only thing still, I didn't finish my final exam to\nget my diploma. She said, you have a deadline to meet. You have to go right now.\nYou have three weeks time to go. What am I going to do? I cannot get my diploma in\nthree weeks. My final exam is not until a few months from now on. She was very\nannoyed with it. She said \"I have my son fighting Korea and you have a chance to go\nto United States and you refuse to.\"\nI said, \"look, I'm not refusing. And I try to explain to her where I stand, what's the\nproblem.\" She was not very compassionate, couldn't understand, and said, well, if\nthat's how it is, then you might lose your entry. I said, well, if that's what's going to\nbe, that's what's going to be. If I go there now I be nobody. I only ask you to allow to\nfinish my studies. It's only a few months, can you ask for an extension? No, I can't.\nSo we walked out. This was the end of it. We are very depressed, upset and\ndepressed. We worn out. I didn't know what to do. I knew we could not stay in\nVienna because foreigners were not allowed to stay and practice in profession. You\ncould only study. And the one day we get a note, a letter from the embassy to report\nto the embassy. It was a different person. It was a man, A different lady and they are\ntelling us that we got our visa extended and when do we think we can go. Is our time\nto go. When can we go? We can go any time now. I just graduate and got my\ndiploma. So, I don't know what happened. Either this first lady had second thoughts.\nMaybe she was bitter that her son was in Korea fighting. I felt very bad for her. I was\nvery sad but, maybe she did understand my problem and quietly maybe she helped\nme. I don't know. I never seen her. I wish I would. And we packed and went to the\nStates. We arrived in New York. We are greeted by my wife's family. They treated us\nvery nicely. They were very well-to-do people. And they were very instrumental in\nour well being and he asked me, what can I do for you? You need money, tell me. I\nsaid, look, I\u2019m young, I have ten fingers, I have both hands, thank God I am not lame.\nI want to work. I do the right thing to do, only I need advice. And we survive. We\nsurvived so far. I didn't want nothing from them and I know he told me, you know,\nFelix, you're the only relative -- we brought quite a few from Europe -- you're the\nonly one that never asked for money. I said, you know what? It is a very strange\nthing. I learned from the past several years to do without money. I survived. If you\nhave less, you do less. You did what you could without money and this is not the\nmost important thing.\nWe have goal ahead of us, a purpose in life. I want to start as soon as I could. We\nwant to leave New York. It was a jungle. Too many refugee and I wanted to mingle\nwith American people. I didn't know any English, I want to start learning and I want\nto get on my foot all by myself without any assistance. So went to the Jewish\nCommittee in New York. Where should we go? We opened a map and the social\nworker put her finger on the spot. And she said \"that's Rochester, New York. What\nabout that?\" That's fine wherever it is. We went to Rochester, New York. Nice,\ncultural town with a decent school of music, beautiful medical schools and so on. Got\nacquainted with proper people. We got refuge from a German Jewish family. We\nstayed with them for several months. They were beautiful people. Very nice to us and\nright away I got acquainted with the hospital. The chief of the hospital was a Jewish\nfellow, Dr. Stapens (ph) who was fascinated with my stories. He wanted to know. He\nsupposed to ask me medical questions, if I equipped to start, what my internship.\nMind you, not speaking English was very difficult to establish that fact. He spoke\nsome German, very little, but one the chief surgeons was fluent in German so he\ncalled him in, and the three of us sitting in his chambers in medical school and talking\nGerman and what he was asking my whole story.",
        "A: After we come back to Lublin, we couldn't forget that lady, that she was selling us for\na silver candelabra to the Gestapo. How could a person who was a neighbor for years.\nHer kids grew up with my wife Lucy, a neighbor. She was a patient of my\nmother-in-law, who was a dentist. How could she? Could I do the same to anybody?\nSo I came -- we both came to her--we confronted her. She became pale like a ghost.\nShe went down on her knees. She crossed herself. She didn't believe, that's us, that we\nsurvive. She didn't know, she probably thought maybe they caught us that famous day\nthat she called the Gestapo on us. And I said, \"you sold us to the Gestapo and here we\nare.\"\nNow your life is at stake. Don't have to do 1s point a finger, what you did to us and\nyou be sentenced immediately, swift justice. They shoot you right away. She begged\nus, she was crying, screaming to spare her life in the name of her son and her\ndeparted husband, who died in the meantime, arrested allegedly by the German and\nso on. I couldn't do it. My wife inquired to some friends what can be done, if\nanything. I wouldn't let them be killed but I felt she should be aware of what she did\nand they told my wife. Unless she has witnesses that we're there at that time, there is\nnothing she can do. But the fact that the woman went through facing us was enough\nof pay back, what she owed us. I don't know if she's alive or not but if she died by\nnow, she died with the fact what she tried to do to us. That day Christian blame the\nJews. Crucify Jesus or Judas selling Jesus for silver. She tried to do the same thing\nonly she had killed Jews doing that. If she was a religious person, real Christian, how\ncould she do that? Where was the church all the time. Single people, priests did help\nus. They help us to get the real birth certificate. You need ID. Fakes were no good.\nThey checked it right away. But we received through the Home Army the real birth\ncertificate. The church was instrumental in helping us. There certainly was a certain\ngroup of Polish people, definitely the intelligent people, people-- the real Polish\npatriot who knew who the real enemy is, not the Jews, and the little shopkeeper in the\nvillage or so, and the milkman, the Jewish milkman was not a dangerous person to the\nPole, and the intelligencia the Jewish professionals, doctors, lawyers, CPA, and so on.\nWhat a threat to the population? None. No one, maybe more or less. That was a little\njealousy, maybe because the Jewish professionals lead a more, extravagant life,\nmaybe and it was striking something easy, visible. See, the Jews were traveling\nabroad overseas, etcetera, etcetera. Most Poles, even the ones that could afford it.\nThey didn't do these things. So there was certain differences, that the Poles did resent\nand I won't go into details. I'm not a social workers and I never did any studies on the\nsubject. This is just my person observation.\nBut my thanks are due to some people. We did survive thanks to some Polish people.\nAnd we grateful to the Polish Home Army, the leaders, the people directly involved\nwith us who saved many other Jewish people, poor people, without any\ncompensation. Risked their own lives, and I said it before, could anyone of us? Try to\ninspect my own soul. Could I do the same thing? What those Polish people did? I\nhonestly don't know. I was never a hero. Maybe I'm a coward, I don't know. But, they\nwere heroes in my eyes, they were. Maybe they were cowards too. Maybe, they\u2019re\nrunning only because they're human beings, and I remembered the words of my\nfriend who said, \"I don't like you Jews. I do it because I--nobody was going to help\nyou.\u201d\nHe was a humanitarian. He meant he was upset. He was upset and was angry that\nthey were arguing and in the Jewish -- in the Yiddish language where the neighbors\ncould hear and jeopardizing his life, his whole operation, his whole army. So I\nunderstand. But in order to understand my early days, my high school gave me a lot\nof happiness, the Polish people. I was their Jew maybe, but I never had a bad word\nfrom them, never. The only complaint I might have when I was young, I never dated\nJewish girls, and many Jewish girls felt I am a snob, or I don't know. I only dated\nPolish girls. Because I was more comfortable with them because I was raised with\nthem. I grew up with them and I was more at ease with them, and I was not\ncomfortable with the very religious Jews. Because I was ignorant about the Jewish\nreligion and the prayers, and so on. My parents did the best they could to instill in me,\nbut they were themselves not guilty of that. They never give them that proper\neducation, Jewish education. And I don't know if I should blame them for that or not,\nbecause we're the orthodox people the right people, or less orthodox or the less\nreligious people the wrong people who should be sentenced to die just -- they were\nserious religious orthodox, orthodox people going to their death. They were the real\nheroes. They were going there with the words in their mouth Shema Yisrael means,\nthat's the prayer for the dead. They were heroes. They didn't run. They didn't try to\ndodge or nothing. They were killed right and went to their graves right in front of\nthem. I think they are the brave people. Are we the heroes? No. I think we survive by\naccident, instinct maybe. But, we're here.\nWe have to build our life again from beginning. We have a nice family. We are a\nspecial family. I think, everybody my not think that way. We are very close, our\nchildren. They are very close to us. We talk to each other every day. We are fortunate\nwe're in the same town. We are 15, 20 minutes away. We are blessed with three and a\nhalf -- half is coming, the fourth one is coming -- grandchildren. We have three\ngranddaughters, fourth on the way. I gave the promise to my parents that we try to be\ndecent, honest. ... We never ask anything from anybody. We didn't have any, we did\nwithout it. We're not a burden to society. We grew up. I'm proud of my children. I\nfeel they are decent citizens and I feel as difficult as it is to talk about it absolutely\nmust, we don't know how long we'll stay here. If you have the history deniers, the lies\nspread now. Whatever good this will do, it's a living testimony. It happened. Thank\nyou.\nEnd of Tape #3\nConclusion of Interview\n"
