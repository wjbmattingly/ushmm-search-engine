Of course, you know, if you\u2019re hiding what you have under pillow, some money or\nsomething. On the Plaszow from the suit was hanging on the ceiling. I got sewed in there\ndiamond. The rest was in the shop. So when I heard the hand is crawling in and I was thinking\nwhat to do. I was thinking I\u2019m going to get up first and catch him.

        "Q: How did you find out who he was?",
        "A: So in the morning, I reported to -- the diamond from the Plaszow is gone, not hanging any more\non top. Was on the floor. So next day I went to Friedman, to Fishman, and they went to\nthe Buzim barrack looking for somebody missing a piece of the shirt which was stupid. When\nwe went in the barrack looking for the guy who was stealing, somebody came in and he said,\nthat the kapos arrived, so forget about it. They\u2019re going to liquidate us. That was not true. The\nkapos was still there. I didn\u2019t know who took it. We still were there. Then one day, they\u2019re\ngoing to liquidate the Skolna. No more Jews in Radom. So one day everybody has to go\nmarching. We went marching. There was no trains, we marched by foot. We didn\u2019t know\nwhere we going. We marched by day. At night they let us go in a tent (?) to lay down, to sleep.\nSome people, they couldn\u2019t walk any more. If they know what happen, they would walk. A car\n-- not a car -- a horse and a wagon went in the back, goes with us, went with us. The SS said\nwho cannot walk any more 1s tired, should go on the wagon. Near me was Mr. G , a little\nbit older than me and Mrs. Zucker. Her husband got killed on the sch when I told you\nwas a fire, sabotage. They killed her husband and other people. They went on the wagon.\nWhen the wagon was full, the wagon disappeared. Then he came back, empty. Some other\npeople, next time, they still went on the wagon. But later on, we saw something is not kosher.\nThe second time, the wagon disappeared. The third time, nobody went on the wagon any\nmore. Because we was sleeping on the field and then one day they said water arrived to give\nus, to drink water. It was so a mess that they start shooting. They shoot the people in the lakes.\nA lot of people. Then when they have to march again, yeah, they marched with bullets in the\nlegs. They didn\u2019t go on the wagon any more. But the last night, they were sleeping on the field\nbefore we went into Tomaszow- . It was a family -- what was the name -- Sinna I\nthink. Was a mother, a daughter, and two sons. Sinnas.

Not on top, on the\nbottom. Then I start looking for help. Moishe Goldberg cannot talk. He got a . He\ntook care of the room. Was also a Radoman, Friedman. I didn\u2019t know him too good. Later I\ngot to be a friend of his. I start calling. Friedman, if you can give me a sack with straw, you\nknow, and take this away. He didn\u2019t listen. I said, was his name. Also\nFriedom, like the policeman. I have some dollars, I give you some dollars. He felt, he said\nokay. I\u2019m going to put on you -- mattress. Mattress huh -- straw on top.

        "Q: Yes. You\u2019re asking the question now. Could you ask the question then?",
        "A: No. To whom am I going to ask a question?",
        "A: And you couldn\u2019t talk to him? You couldn\u2019t buy anything from him? You were too far away?",
        "A: No, no. Then I said to myself. After the war, if I\u2019m going to survive, no Red Cross for me. I\u2019m\ngoing to hate them always and I\u2019m not going to donate a penny to the Red Cross any more. The\nJewish donating money to the Red Cross. I wouldn\u2019t. If they can give a package to him, why\nnot to me? Nobody would know. So I\u2019m laying here hungry, don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on\noutside.

Then the\nSS did find out. They came with guns and they shoot in the barrack. I don\u2019t know how many\npeople got killed or what. I was laying covered up on my place.",
        "Q: So they shot right there in front of you? You could see it?",
        "A: Yeah, in the barrack. In the ceiling, underneath, everywhere. Because they knew they were\nhiding. But still a lot of people were hiding.

        "A: In the sick barrack, no. He died in the regular barrack. This barrack was only for contaminated\npeople, typhus. So when I got this bread and they told me we are liberated, I said to myself, I\u2019m\nnot going to lay in bed. I start crawling from bed down out to the field. The wire was cut\nalready, the people cut the wire and I was crawling on the field where the trucks passed, the\nFrench army.

The army never bathed because they were afraid to\ngo in. They put the powder over you, all over the place. The French people start looking\naround and they went in the back and they saw how many people laying in this ditch with the\nstriped suits, a lot. They think hundreds and hundreds. Then they called the mayor from\nVaihingen, the mayor or somebody and the people come over. They should look what they did.\nOne French soldier, a Jewish, I think he was Jewish, he gives me a gun. When he gives me a\ngun, I kill him (?) The people who come to work. They brought people to work, to bury the\npeople. I never got a gun in my hand I says and I cannot kill nobody. He looks at me stupid.\nSo we were staying in this barrack and they caught the SS. Hechay, the two guys in the kitchen\nplus Machine and Bill. There what they did, their job, they cooked. They worked with the\npeople with the Jewish people. They were the top Jewish people cooking. They went home, we\nwere staying on that field to count us. They went through you, like this, and hit here in the\ntesticles. A lot of people they were no men any more. What they went through, they hate you\nall the time. Even you were hiding, holding like this, they caught them. They caught almost all\nthe SS except Miller the . One was there, a Wehrmacht, the , we called him.

Every morning he wake up bitten the whole body. Marks from the, I don\u2019t know how you\ncall this swanzen. They\u2019re on the wall, the walls and everywhere. The customer, my customers\nthat went into the German police and they said they\u2019re not able to go in to fit because they are\nafraid of typhus. The police should give me a permission to go to them. This, for me was good.\nThe police gave me a paper. The time allowed to go to fit to them. Because you cannot walk on\nthe street because at the time you were wearing the ... Star, the armband.",
        "A: No. Also when you go out, you don\u2019t have to walk on the sidewalk. You have to walk with the\nhorses.",

        "A: So if they catch me, I would be dead, you know. When you got to -- for fitting -- in the middle\nof the street, when the SS goes by, you have take off your hat. So I took off the hat. I have to\ntake off a lot of times. One day, they called me over. To hell with that. Why I took off the\nmitzen, the hat. I don\u2019t know what to say. I knew my friend, he was asking me. One, two,\nyou\u2019re not my friend. So they don\u2019t want me to take off the hat. Next time I take off the hat, I\ngot the same trouble. Why didn\u2019t you take off the hat? The beating and the we were\nused already to it. But the maIn thing, I\u2019m coming home, risk my life and I brought something\nto eat. They didn\u2019t pay you but they give you what -- old bread or something like this, they give\nyou. That was good enough. We stayed in this apartment till 1942.

Then we come -- before we went in, the guy in the front desk, also\nJewish -- he comes running, screaming. You\u2019re not allowed, you cannot go in with the wife and\nthe kids! I said who\u2019s telling me I cannot go in. If you can go in, you\u2019re not even a tailor and I\ncannot go in? He said, can you go somewhere to hide? I said, we can go hide. We went to the\nruins in the back -- in the house in the back, basement \u2014",
        "A: Junk. How can you stay here? I said forget it. We\u2019re going to our room. Oh, he was --. You\nhave nothing to say, I said. We are the meisters here. We come to the room.

        "A: No, Ukrainians was later. They do the killing. So we sitting. We are thinking we are safe\nbecause we are just on inside already. No. Meanwhile, the Judenrat, non-tailors -- I don\u2019t know\nif it\u2019s an excuse or not an excuse --they come into the shop too. The SS did find out they were\nhiding in the shop.",
        "A: Yeah. Non-tailors, the big shots, everybody came in to hide in the shop. We didn\u2019t know\nbecause we were upstairs in our room, in the rooms. All of a sudden, Moishe Rafilovich\u2019s\nbrother, Meyer Rafilovich, he was a policeman, a Jewish police \u2014",
        "A: He comes up to the room, he said everybody out from the shop. Everybody out. I said we\nhave permission. He said to Moishe, his brother, everybody out because they come up, they\u2019re\ngoing to kill everybody. We still didn\u2019t go.",
        "A: Outside they\u2019re killing already. Where should we go. Meyer Furgelman, who worked for me,\nhe was there too. He comes again; they\u2019re coming and they\u2019re going to kill everybody. So we\nwent. And the minute we went out, where we were going to go in the first place.\nTape 2.",
        "A: So when we already come to this point, where the Germans, rows of SS and they send you one\nway or the other way. Mostly they go the other way, But we didn\u2019t know, right 1s good or left\nis good. But we came in front of the SS, we saw across the street, a blackboard with chalk\nwritten down numbers. We didn\u2019t know what it means or something like this. We have our\ncards from the shop that we are meisters. You don\u2019t have to show them that. Forget it. They\ndon\u2019t need any cards. They only looked at your face. They looked at your face and then you go\nright or left. Right is good or left 1s good, we didn\u2019t know. So we saw --we was staying\ntogether, the bunch without wives and kids. We saw which SS man he let through more people.\nSo we went to his row. The cars with the meister doesn\u2019t mean a thing. They looked at your\nface, go. So we went. Where did we go -- a place was a leather factory, a Jewish leather\nfactory.",
        "A: No. This was outside the ghetto. And the place, we were running. We didn\u2019t know where to go\nbut we run and we saw people stay and fight. So we went into these people here, in the leather\nfactory. was the name, the leather factory. We stayed there and then what a human\nbeing is, like an animal, we were asking which is , good or bad? What\u2019s here? We think\nalready, here you lost your wife and kids and everybody; you\u2019re asking if it\u2019s good or bad. We\nwere staying here. What went down back there, we don\u2019t know. We staying in this factory.\nBefore we come in, piles of people on the floor dead. We stay there till the light comes,\ndaylight. From this people, they always came and they took out people, even from here. Why -\n-because they took them to the streets to clean up the dead. Because the street was full of\ndeads. They have to bury them. Open up ditches and put them in. They didn\u2019t took us because\nwe were the last ones over there. When the light comes on, we start marching. Where we\nmarched, we didn\u2019t know. When we march, on the left side was a bunch of SS. Between the\nSS was also and the name Shippes maybe you heard somebody, no. Shippes, he was the\ntop. Sam and _ Fishman, an uncle of mine, they were in front. When we passed by the\nSS, Shippes saidtoS \u2014 you____ for him, he made the uniforms. He said Herr B , It takes\nyou so long to make a uniform, a suit. You see we did in a few hours, we finished our job.\nWhat can you say -- nothing. So we marched and we marched. You see the streets, you got\nsuch pictures to see.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know about my wife, nothing.",
        "A: Where did we go, you think? Back where I lived, in Zeromskiego.",
        "A: Where the shack, you know. Was an empty place in the middle and we went over there.",
        "A: Yeah. Mine parents, the girl told me, the niece, she survived. That my father could have lived\nwhen he would go without his wife. But he said he goes with his wife. So they took him.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: No, they took him from the sch from the house. They took them. You know they\ncleaned out the -- everything. They took him to -- later we find out, we did find out -- because\nthe trains were waiting over there. Far away from us. All the people who went from here, left\nhere, they went to the trains. The trains they went to Treblinka.",
        "A: Yeah. This girl told me. And my wife and kid too. And and Moishe Rafilovich.",
        "A: Yeah. So before they went into the train, they undressed the people. Because they know that\neverybody has hidden something in the clothing, which is true. The same thing with me.",
        "A: I sew it in. So everybody who goes into the train, women, men, children, undress. Naked to the\ntrains. The trains, they were rolling to Treblinka. You know when you come to Treblinka,\nthat\u2019s it.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: They shot them in the houses, in the streets, somebody hide in the house, they find them, they\nshoot them. Some people hide in a bakery, in the oven and they shoot them in the oven. They\nshoot the people who they have to go to Treblinka without going to the -- over there on the\nstreets they got killed. Was a war. So we come in, we marched till we come in where they said\nto Mr. Bowman, they did a good job, so fast, why he take so long. They come in back to the\nsch where I lived. Mine house was empty already, nobody there.",
        "A: I never went there.",
        "A: Just went out with nothing. The Polaks they took over. The Germans didn\u2019t take it. The Polaks\nwere looking for places. They took everything. They took everything, the Polaks, terrible. We\nsitting there, we cannot go nowhere till it comes an order. We have to go back to the rooms\nwhere we got before. We went up to the rooms, two rooms were taken already, taken by the\nJewish police. We cannot say nothing. They work for the SS and that\u2019s that. Young guys.",
        "A: Yeah. He moved in with us, Moishe\u2019s brother. He got two brothers. Liba and Moishe. Moishe\nRafilovich was, before the war, a soccer player. He worked for the B . He was\nplaying, I mean with the B ;",
        "A: At the time was not professional, no. For nothing.",
        "A: Before -- I think he worked in a -- because he was a player, he worked in a ceramic factory, a\nJewish ceramic factory. So did Libel, I think, his brother too. But he was a donschneider.\nListen, you cannot fight with the police. They worked for the SS and that\u2019s that. Young guys,\nalso friends. Known friends. Not friends, but a younger generation. So they left us the less\nroom, one room. How can we all fit in over there? Was Laza Malamit , Moishe Krol,\nMolishe Rafilovich, Liba Rafilovich lives there, no was different. Liba was there, but he was\nwith the police. Moishe Rafilovich, a brother-in-law, Laza Malamit , Mandelbaum -- a lot\nof people in this room. My bed still stays at the wall, the sofa -- so at least I have the sofa. We\nlived over there. We went to work and back. To work and back. The Polaks if you have\nmoney, by the wires, they supplied us with -- but you have to give them money, gold. They take\neverything, goods, materials and we worked in the shop like nothing happened, like nothing\nhappened. But at the time they give you a number. No more Itzrek Rosenblat or Moishe\nRafilovich, none of this. My number was number 21.",
        "A: No. You have to buy ourselves.",
        "A: Yes. It was established already this little arb , like a little ghetto. With the police, with\neverything. The chief of the police was , a Jewish guy. W Fishman\nwas the name, Fishman, not related. He was also in the police. We work in the shop and the\nshop -- I think second floor. Downstairs was the office. If a customer comes in and they need a\ntailor, a meister to come down to take the measurement, to take the material, wasa___\u2014, a boy, a\nyoung boy. He was running up and down ,up and down. Runs up, number 21, down. I come\ndown, a customer\u2019s there, have to take the measurement. The main thing what I did. She has a\npackage with material she brought. I opened the package like this and I knew already how\nmany yards. Why -- because if I can cut off a piece, I don\u2019t need the material. Because they got\nthe material. They didn\u2019t - _. In Jewish --. When I saw, I have enough material, I can cut\noff a sk , you know. So I knew that this is going to be -- can go to the Polaks and give\nthem the piece of sk and take some food home. But they have to go through the manager,\na German manager. Was a Polish manager over us and a German.",
        "A: Yeah. He has to give you the dates of the people, for the Germans, when they should come for\na fitting. If I saw that I have enough material to make the first fitting and take out the piece\nwhat I need to survive, I said to her, three weeks or four weeks or something, I said you can\ncome two days for it. Why -- because I have to cut a suit, a coat and the piece I go to the Polaks\nright away and I have something to eat. She was happy. We went in booths for fittings. Was a\nlot of booths, you know, for the customer. Where there was a empty booth, I went in.\nSometimes they brought something. Bread or something. We not allowed to take but allowed\nor not allowed we had to take and I made the fitting. Why -- because I want to have the piece.",
        "A: Not to the shop, to the rooms.",
        "A: This was on the Zeromskiego.",
        "A: After we returned, the room what we got before, the rooms was taken by the Jewish police.\nThey left for us one room. So we all went into the one room and the other rooms we have no\nway to _. You\u2019re not going to start with the police. So we lived in this one room. You have\nto mention all the people there? No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And we stayed in the room. The next day, they called us again. Out. Another like it was\nover there.",
        "A: Roundup.",
        "A: Like a chicken?",
        "A: We were always like in a chicken coop. Let\u2019s say if some -- the SS has a holiday or something,\nthey come in and take a few people and kill. Like a chicken coop.",
        "A: Yeah. Next day, we went in already to the one room. Next day was the same thing what\nhappened, you know. Because they haven\u2019t got -- they left too many people. So again, they\nround us up and they made that another selection. They took away people which they already\nwent through the whole thing. And I\u2019m not going to mention names \u2018cause I know whom they\ntook and they took another 200 people. To death.",
        "A: Yeah. Then we went back again. Who left over, went back to the room. Was missing a lot of\npeople but what can you do. We stayed in the room. We went next day to the shop. You have\nto go to work. Whatever happens, you have to work. Forget about everything.",
        "A: No. They didn\u2019t give us any food. We went into the shop and then we start, you know, still\ncrying and talking to each other. We tried to find out where did they go. My wife and\nRafilovich\u2019s, all the -- where did they go? The Polaks, a policeman he come in. Got in\nconnection with this police and he said he can find out. But we have to pay him. We paid once,\nwe paid twice, we didn\u2019t find out where they went. He took the money, everybody who has a\nchance to grab the money from us, they did. So we didn\u2019t find out, we didn\u2019t know. Really we\ndidn\u2019t know what happened to the people.",
        "A: We were thinking they send them away somewhere. We didn\u2019t think they went to Treblinka.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know what Treblinka is, at all.",
        "A: Oh the people in --this is a different story.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know. The minute she went away from me, from then on I didn\u2019t know what happened\nto her.",
        "A: What was, later we did find out that the trains were waiting. We heard the trains going back and\nforth that they went to Treblinka. So we start going back to the shop and working again.\nWhatever happened, we shouldn\u2019t think about it because it would be sabotage when you do\ndifferent. So we were crying and talking and we start working in the shop. Customers come in,\nGerman customers and special customers. The Kolkdeutsch, the Germans they have the right\nwhat were bumped out Germany, when they come in, they come first. Because we got the b\nalso the Germans from Radom. They have to wait. The people who were oskerb\u2014__\nfrom Germany, they lost everything. For them we have to make first.",
        "A: Germans, yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Civilians from ost from stugk __ or somewhere else.",
        "A: So we worked in the shop till when we went down to Szkolna. I think we went on the Szkolna\n1944.",
        "A: In the shop. Yeah, we worked in the shop.",
        "A: In the morning and at night we went home, in the back.",
        "A: Yeah, short. Very short.",
        "A: No heat.",
        "A: The ghetto was, no -- no water no nothing. In the shop was water. So we work and customers\ncome in and the guy came out. They give you a number. My number was 21 because no name.\nThe customer come in, I have to go down in the booth, to fit. We worked over there till 1944.\nIt was an order, Radom has to be Junenrein.",
        "A: I\u2019m still in the room. Shall I tell the story with this guy who took away from us, everything?",
        "A: Money, yeah.",
        "A: Dead.",
        "A: Because I got a Polish passport and I was thinking to go out on the Aryan, Polish side. I got\nalready where to go and I have to pay. Without money, nobody\u2019s going to take you. So I got\nthe money.",
        "A: Yeah. Everybody has a hope to escape. But to escape is also 80% dead. Because the Polaks\nthey know who\u2019s a Jew, who is not a Jew. They did know. They were looking for to get money\nfrom you.",
        "A: When we come back to this room, before I kept the money in the shop. I got a table where was\nironing and I made a double --. We got carpenters too and they make me a double place to hide\nin the shop. But the money when I went back to the room, I was hiding on this place on the\nobben on top.",

        "A: So I saw pots and pans. I said okay I\u2019m going to put over there. I cannot take with me. I need\nthe money in case I want to run away. So I put in a pot and cover it. A gold watch, a diamond\nand a lot of money. The money was sitting there. From us, from the room nobody\u2019s going to\ntake anybody\u2019s money.",
        "A: Yeah, oh 100%. We went back and forth to the shop. The shop had a lot of things. It was a\nlittle higher, a girl made a little higher they burn the table and they took a few people. No every\nday, first of all, the place to kill people was on the Zeromskiego, on mine place.",
        "A: Yeah. When somebody they said sabotage, they took them there to the wall and the Ukrainians\ncame and they killed them.",
        "A: Guns, yeah. So we sitting in the house, we come back from the shop. I was sleeping at the\nsofa, Sunday morning I wake up and I said to the rest of the people in the shop, in the room, I\ngot a bad dream that they took away from me everything. They steal everything from me.\nThey said, oh, it\u2019s minsas, stories. I said, okay. I\u2019m going to take a look. I climbed up\nover there and opened up the pot and -- nothing. Everything is gone. Nothing. I start\nscreaming, oh what I\u2019m going to do now? I have to have the money. I have a Polish passport to\nget out and now I have nothing. I was very --. They said to me Izzy, come down. They went\nlooking. Moishe Rafilovich went looking, nothing missing. Moishe Krol went looking,\nnothing missing. Laza Malamit went looking, everything is gone.",
        "A: Two.",
        "A: Yeah. First of all they haven\u2019t got so much. Everything is gone. So when I was screaming I\nopened up the door from the police, the other room. And I said, nobody took it, only this room.\nT , he was in the room with his father. He survived. He\u2019s in New York. His father he\nwants to kill me, angry. How dare you can tell that we took the money, your money. I said I\ndidn\u2019t say you took it, I said this room ---",
        "A: Right. But it\u2019s gone. So I start running. I was talking to V -Fishman, policeman. I told\nhim the story. The chief from the police, was also a friend. He talked to\nFreedman. They said they\u2019re going to search the room where the police was. So nobody has to\ngo into the room. Only me and Lasa Malamit with his girl friend. So they start searching. In\nthe other room was the same oven like in my room, the last room. This oven to heat, to put in\ncoal --. They look and look, V Fishman find my money on top of the oven. A bundle of\n500 zlotys. He called it guralis. So I have the money and I start counting. A lot is missing but I\ndidn\u2019t mind.",
        "A: The passport was in a different place. By the way, he didn\u2019t took the passport. The passport\nwas there in the pots and pans. Then they start looking, they didn\u2019t find anything else. Just the\nmoney.",
        "A: Nothing Laza\u2019s, Malamit, nothing.",
        "A: Yeah, closet. He didn\u2019t talk. He doesn\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t took it, he doesn\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t\ntalk. So we came over an idea that his sister works in the shop by a dressmaker. This girl was\na, She got one leg shorter, a cripple. The police told her ---",
        "A: The Jewish police, mostly Fishman. You better go to your brother and tell him where he was\nhiding the other money, the other gold, the other money. She went to him. He didn\u2019t talk.\nThen they said, if he\u2019s not going to talk, you\u2019re going to lose your job. If you lose your job, you\nknow you\u2019re dead. So she went again. She was crying and crying. Then they look and they\nfind my gold watch, gold pieces and some ,adiamond. Then he stopped talking again.\nShe went again and was crying to him. So he start talking again. He said Malamit\u2019s gold and\nall kind of things, he was hiding outside the rooms under the stairs down. If you go up to the\napartment. So they found ; gold. Then the police send him away to another\ncamp.",
        "A: A camp, to another camp. Outside. With a brother. Okay. One day he came back from there.\nHe run away from there, he came back here. He was stealing again by somebody else. By the\nway, back when they run away from the camp coming here to Radom, his brother got killed on\nthe way. They killed him. So he came alone. Then when he was here, the police took him and\ngive him over to the SA. When he comes to the SA he start talking that we have Polish\npassports, foreign currency, gold, do you know what means?",
        "A: Death.",
        "e 6A: SA from the SA. We decided that he better go. He doesn\u2019t have to fit, he goes for a\nfitting.",

        "A: An excuse to talk to this Foirk. So he went there. Mr. Foirk said you didn\u2019t tell me you need a\nfitting today. He said I want to make sure that everything 1s perfect. So he said to him that\u2019s\nnice. He said to him okay, schneidermeister have a wine. Melamik start crying. And he said,\nwhat happened, what Teitlebaum says and it\u2019s not true. He said don\u2019t worry.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t got anything. He said, it doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: Foirk, yeah. Doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s not your time, no. Everybody has to be killed. But\nyou\u2019re going to be the last ones to kill. He didn\u2019t say anything else but that\u2019s what he said.\nYou\u2019re going to be the last ones to be killed. Oh, okay. He came home, he told the story. So\nwe went back up to the room. We went on with our life again like we did. We worked over\nthere, we finished the uniform for Mr. Foirk. He didn\u2019t say nothing. We worked over there till -\n- in the shop -- till 1944.",
        "A: No, yeah. In the shop we worked almost ---yeah. It started in 1942, I think. Shop was opened\nin 1942. Yeah, I remember that. Then they decided to liquidate Radom, Judenrein.

Was a lot of\nplaces to go, Majdanek and all kinds of places. My brother still got his kid.",
        "A: He\u2019s still alive. He still had the kid.",
        "A: When we had to go into the shop sometimes, they stopped to search everybody, the kid went\ninto a suitcase. He carried the suitcase into the shop. When he said to the kid, he should be\nquiet, not a peep. Quiet.",
        "A: Also in --?",
        "A: With you?",
        "A: No, he was in different place. Also in the Zeromskiego. He was in the shop.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah. In the same neighborhood.",
        "A: My brother, I was friendly with the top of the shop. Mr. -- what was his name -- a Polak. He\nwas the main man over there. My brother was set up to go to P because he heard that\nover there are some kids. I couldn\u2019t tell him because I didn\u2019t know where I\u2019m going. I couldn\u2019t\ntell him that he shouldn\u2019t go because he has a kid. I couldn\u2019t tell him anything. At the last\nminute he decided to come to me and ask me Itzrek, I want to go where you go. I said I don\u2019t\nknow where I\u2019m going. Schalvitski, he was -- Polak.",
        "A: The boss, Schalvitski. So I went in to Schalvitski. I said Mr. Schalvitski, I would like mine\nbrother should go where I go. He said you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going. I said no, I don\u2019t\nbut I would like wherever I\u2019m going, he should go with me. He said it\u2019s too late. Forget it, it\u2019s\ntoo late because he signed up to go to P . He (Side B, Tape 2) Instead to P\n, they sent him to Majdanek.",
        "A: Majdanek was terrible.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t know they\u2019re going to send him to Majdanek.",
        "A: Yeah, he ended up in Majdanek.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: But after the war I did find out that from Majdanek, they sent him to Plaszow. You heard of\nPlaszow?",
        "A: A salt mine.",
        "A: So I didn\u2019t hear from him at all. We went to Skolna. The shop went -- a lot of people went to\nSkolna. We arrived in Skolna, okay. When we arrived in Skolna, we still have a suit, a coat, I\nhave a scarf. You know because I was ---",
        "A: I still have everything. And in Skolna was already a concentration camp. They were wearing\nalready the striped suits. We didn\u2019t because we worked for the German -- we have to be clean\ndressed to go for the Germans.",
        "A: We arrived at the Skolna and we formed lines and Ober was the boss of us. We\nstanding around waiting, they count us. Then H called me, like this. I went over to him.\nHe hit me once and twice over the face for nothing. I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong.",
        "A: Then he hit me again. Then from the side, the people said to me, Itzrek, take off the hand from\nthe pocket. I was holding the hand in the pocket. I took off the hand from the pocket so he\ndidn\u2019t hit me any more. Because you know, it\u2019s a concentration camp. It\u2019s not the shop\nanymore.",
        "A: Yeah, when we were counted and everything, we went into a room to undress and to shave.\nBarbers that shave the head and they start giving us the striped suits.",
        "A: I got a package. I put on the suit and we start laughing. The pants are made too long, the jacket\nis too long. Moishe Rafilovich, he got too short a package, so we start exchanging between us.\nDress, when there\u2019s something wrong, we know we\u2019re going into sewing, we\u2019re going to fix it\nourselves. So we were given a barrack where we should live. We come into the barrack, I\nalways took -- there was three beds. I always took the top.",
        "A: Yeah, because I was always a little particular in things like this. To be clean because I know\nfrom the top when somebody cleans himself, the louses come down. You know what I\u2019m\ntalking about.",
        "A: The dirt -- everything comes down. So I said I\u2019m going to take the top. So I always took the\ntop. Then we went into the shop. It was a new shop they opened up. The customers from the\nold shop, they took all the packages what we didn\u2019t finish, they took 1t with them to the new\nplace, to the Skolna. The customers they have to come, they were advised that to finish the\ngarments they should come to the Skolna. Okay. We stayed in this barrack and we went into\nthe shop. The shop was wired around where we were. I took the stuff what I have. I got -- they\nbrought all the tools with the tables over there. Then I out back in my -- what I have -- you\nknow, the gold and the \u2014",
        "A: In the table.",
        "A: Not yet.",
        "A: Over there we got special to make dresses for the German women, wholesale dresses. We\nworked on the dresses. When I was working in the shop, somebody came in and he said Yitzrek\nyour schragen is here. I said what? You know what a schragen means?",
        "A: Yeah, sister-in-law. I went out looking for her. I didn\u2019t see any schragen. Then I heard a voice.\nShe starts screaming Itzrek, it\u2019s me, Dinka. Dinka\u2019s her name. I looked at her. I didn\u2019t\nrecognize her. She looked so terrible, without hair, with a thing on the head, a cover. She\nlooked terrible. I said to her don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going to try to give her a place where to stay in\nthe barrack. I tried when we make the dresses. I tried to give her a dress. I tried to see that she\nshould have something to eat. I cannot go home to the barracks yet. So when the day was\nfinished, I met her. We talked and she told me what happened. The kid, she -- first of all, she\ntold me -- my brother got typhus.",
        "A: Yeah, in Plaszow. She managed when she went out to work, she managed to bring him a piece\nof bread sometimes.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah, with the kid. When she went to work, the kid was hiding in bed, covered up quiet.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Went down and she can only get to my brother to replace a toilet, you know. She can throw\nover to him some -- she organized some bread. The kid was hiding in the barrack. Not a peep.\nThat\u2019s what she told me. One day, they took away from the place where she worked and they\ntransferred her to me, to my camp. She comes in.",
        "A: Alone. Without the kid. She said, I don\u2019t know what happened to the kid.",
        "A: In Plaszow.",
        "A: In the barrack.",
        "A: No. They saw the kid, they killed him. What else?",
        "A: Eli was still alive when she left. But after the war, I did find out that he starved to death in\nPlaszow.",
        "A: No. So now I\u2019m on the Skolna, huh?",
        "A: Yeah, we\u2019re all together. Then the same thing happened. A transport arrived from Buzim. You\nheard of Buzim?",
        "A: When the transport arrived from Buzim, everything changed. With them came a lot of kapos.\nNot only Jewish kapos, other nationalities, kapos.",
        "A: Yeah. Because they liquidated Majdanek. They were sent here to our place. When the Buzim\narrived, start stealing. The Buzim, they were our people but ---.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if they were thieves, they were butchers and all kind of people. Listen to this; I\nwas sleeping one night on top of the barrack and I had a hand is crawling under mine -- like\npillow. Of course, you know, if you\u2019re hiding what you have under pillow, some money or\nsomething. On the Plaszow from the suit was hanging on the ceiling. I got sewed in there\ndiamond. The rest was in the shop. So when I heard the hand is crawling in and I was thinking\nwhat to do. I was thinking I\u2019m going to get up first and catch him. I got up first and I start\nscreaming and I caught an undershirt. He was pulling away a black undershirt. I have the piece\nfrom the undershirt in my hand and he\u2019s gone.",
        "A: No. I did find out.",
        "A: Yeah. I start screaming and everybody on the lower beds, everybody catch each other. He was\ncoming out from the barrack already. We was still looking for him. I have the place from the\nshirt. If you go around, where there\u2019s an empty bed, maybe he run out from the barrack or\nsomething, but no empty bed.",
        "A: So in the morning, I reported to -- the diamond from the Plaszow is gone, not hanging any more\non top. Was on the floor. So next day I went to Friedman, to Fishman, and they went to\nthe Buzim barrack looking for somebody missing a piece of the shirt which was stupid. When\nwe went in the barrack looking for the guy who was stealing, somebody came in and he said,\nthat the kapos arrived, so forget about it. They\u2019re going to liquidate us. That was not true. The\nkapos was still there. I didn\u2019t know who took it. We still were there. Then one day, they\u2019re\ngoing to liquidate the Skolna. No more Jews in Radom. So one day everybody has to go\nmarching. We went marching. There was no trains, we marched by foot. We didn\u2019t know\nwhere we going. We marched by day. At night they let us go in a tent (?) to lay down, to sleep.\nSome people, they couldn\u2019t walk any more. If they know what happen, they would walk. A car\n-- not a car -- a horse and a wagon went in the back, goes with us, went with us. The SS said\nwho cannot walk any more 1s tired, should go on the wagon. Near me was Mr. G , a little\nbit older than me and Mrs. Zucker. Her husband got killed on the sch when I told you\nwas a fire, sabotage. They killed her husband and other people. They went on the wagon.\nWhen the wagon was full, the wagon disappeared. Then he came back, empty. Some other\npeople, next time, they still went on the wagon. But later on, we saw something is not kosher.\nThe second time, the wagon disappeared. The third time, nobody went on the wagon any\nmore. Because we was sleeping on the field and then one day they said water arrived to give\nus, to drink water. It was so a mess that they start shooting. They shoot the people in the lakes.\nA lot of people. Then when they have to march again, yeah, they marched with bullets in the\nlegs. They didn\u2019t go on the wagon any more. But the last night, they were sleeping on the field\nbefore we went into Tomaszow- . It was a family -- what was the name -- Sinna I\nthink. Was a mother, a daughter, and two sons. Sinnas. When we were sleeping on the field,\nthey took off the corn already from the field. You know, was \u2014 the ground was soaked.",
        "A: They digged. They start digging. They digged a hole in the ground. They were prepared for it.\nThey digged a hole in the ground and the two Sinnas, the two brothers when they saw that it\u2019s\ngoing to be light already, we have to march again, they got in there and the daughter, the sister\nand this wife, they covered up.",
        "A: Yeah, they covered them up with dirt. They covered them up with dirt and they got paper to put\non the face and they got from bottles, the neck, the neck from the bottles to give them in the\nmouth.",
        "A: To breathe. When daylight arrived and we have to go, they were sitting on this grave. On top\nof them. Because it was dogs also, they were sitting. Then when the SS were screaming, roust\ngoing, going. So they were the last ones to leave. Nobody should step on the grave, you know,\nnothing. And they left. Two brothers were there. They survived.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, till after the war.",
        "A: Oh yeah, they were alone. Covered up and nobody saw them and nothing. They survived.",
        "A: Yeah, they are Radomen, yeah. The Sinnas, I knew them.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah, we did find out later. They took them to the woods and they killed them. They come\nback empty again.",
        "A: I know who did. He was the S --. He was in the revea, the hospitals. He got a Polish name.\nThey knew his name. He was known. Took him over there and killed him, he come back. So\nlater nobody went there. So we start working again till we arrive in Tomaszow. We arrive in\nTomaszow. They let us in, in a good factory. They made goods for, you know --. Tomaszow\nwas well known to make materials.",
        "A: Textiles, yes. A textile factory, schttuffed. We went in to this textile factory and the textile\nfactory got the roof, glass.",

        "A: Porcelain, right. We went, come into this room, everybody start choking. Gas. They\u2019re going\nto gas us here. Everybody short of breath and we need water, was a tragedy. We were 100%\nsure this roof and everything else they going to gas us here. You need water.",
        "A: Was getting a little chilly.",
        "A: You know why? Because when I was sleeping on the field, some people that took the blankets,\nrobe and ... You know some people they have -- I didn\u2019t took nothing.",
        "A: Yeah. This I have with me. And the pictures. But I haven\u2019t got what to cover up. I haven\u2019t got\nnothing. I was wearing underneath, a regular suit under the striped suit. Maybe, we always got\nin mind to run away.",
        "A: No, no. Was covered up.",
        "A: Dead.",
        "A: So we arrived in this place and then I was looking for somebody. I think 1t was some people\nthey were walking there or something. I paid a lot of money, I said, can I get some water?\nBecause everybody was choking. So I paid for it and he brought me 1n a dish, some water. I\nwasn\u2019t able to drink the water. It was all the people after me and I spilled the water. I haven\u2019t\ngot the water. And that night, one was sleeping on the other.",
        "A: On the floor. Was so terrible, you know, people they have to do something, right? Some people\ncannot hold back.",

        "A: He said nobody should worry. Same thing. You\u2019re going to get water. You\u2019re going to get a\nsoup. Then said now we\u2019re sure that we\u2019re going to be dead. No, it\u2019s true. We got water and a\nsoup. Then they separate the women from the men. There was no children any more.",

        "A: He went in deep. Right away was our coats and the shoes.",
        "A: No, they brought it. We put it on and they were asking if we have everything on the truck. This\nguy was driving, we\u2019re thinking we\u2019re going to be dead anyway, the way he is riding, so fast.\nSo we arrived in Vaihingen, back.",
        "A: Then I talked to Meyer, talked to Moishe Rafilovich, I talked to --. I said I think that now I\u2019m\ngoing to survive .If I got off from there, it\u2019s a possibility that I\u2019m going to survive.",

        "A: We talked. We saw the bombing. You see when we went out cleaning the tracks where they\nbombed and everything. We saw the English with the round marks, the bombing and the SS\nthey were running like hell. We even looked up like a song. Didn\u2019t bother us. Then when they\nbombed Stuggardt. We saw in Vaihingen, in the SS, they were running. So we stayed outside\nand looking. We saw the way they throw down the lights. The lights come before, then the\nbombing. Was like a Christmas trees, the top. For us was perfect, but the SS they were afraid.",
        "A: Yeah, we talked, you know, everybody talked a different language.",
        "A: No, no. This was a dream. We not going to survive anyway. I\u2019m still back in Vaihingen and I\nstill go up to Agelzay.",
        "A: Yeah. All of a sudden, I didn\u2019t feel good. But I didn\u2019t give in. Temperature went high but I\ndidn\u2019t give in. I knew when I was going to go to the barrack and you knew the only thing what\nhappened to you is typhus.",
        "A: And typhus is dead. I didn\u2019t give in. Then when I worked, I went home in the barrack. I\npicked up my shirt here all red. My belly was all red, spots, red spots. I knew it\u2019s typhus. I still\nwent to work because if I go into the barrack, I\u2019m dead. But it took a while, I couldn\u2019t work\nany more. They carried me in their arm so I have to go in. So I went into Moishe Goldberg\u2019s\nbarrack. Moishe Goldberg also was a friend of mine.",
        "A: Radoman, no friend. Was Usha Goldberg and Moishe Goldberg. Usha Goldberg was top\nechelon, he was a policeman, he was everything. I go into this barrack holding my shoes like\nthis. The main thing, the shoes.",
        "A: Right, in the shop. I\u2019m waiting under the door because was no room. I have to wait until\nsomebody dies. When he\u2019s out, they throw me in bed. so help me God. I went in and\nthe guy was laying in bed still. Was still alive. This guy has diarrhea.",
        "A: In the bed, yeah. He was still alive. They pulled him out by the legs. Like I see it now. You\nknow what they did with me? They throw me in.",
        "A: In the mess. I say to myself, that\u2019s it. If] would drop dead, I wouldn\u2019t mind but I always was\nconscious of to be clean. Here I lay in a mess, somebody else\u2019s mess. Not on top, on the\nbottom. Then I start looking for help. Moishe Goldberg cannot talk. He got a . He\ntook care of the room. Was also a Radoman, Friedman. I didn\u2019t know him too good. Later I\ngot to be a friend of his. I start calling. Friedman, if you can give me a sack with straw, you\nknow, and take this away. He didn\u2019t listen. I said, was his name. Also\nFriedom, like the policeman. I have some dollars, I give you some dollars. He felt, he said\nokay. I\u2019m going to put on you -- mattress. Mattress huh -- straw on top. I said, this would be\nfine. I paid him. Money can buy everything. Then I was laying and the crisis arrived. I was\nlaying again in water, top.",
        "A: From myself, no. This water comes from myself. When you have the crisis, you start\nperspiring.",
        "A: Yeah, high and then you perspire. When you survive this perspiring, you\u2019re okay. One day I\nlay again in water from myself. I felt the crisis went over and I\u2019m still alive. After that typhus,\nyou need to eat. Let\u2019s say when they give you my whole Frigidaire with another grocery store,\nnot enough. I don\u2019t know where it goes but you can eat so much, it\u2019s unbelievable.",
        "A: I called to Laza Malamit -- message. They cannot come in here. They can send me a piece of\nbread or something like this. They did, they did. Then they did find somebody by the name of\nFirdik. He went outside the walls. He brought in always food. I said to -- let him bring me\nmarmalade if it possible and an onion. Because you get scurvy, you know what means scurvot?",
        "A: Scurvy?",
        "A: Scurvot means you don\u2019t have the vitamins or lemon or --.",
        "A: A lot of people died of this. I said I need a -- he can bring me. I give him a ten dollar bill if he\ncan bring me marmalade, onion and a bread. He did. So the jar of marmalade was under the\npillow. Lice, a lot, who cares. You eat the lice. I put in my hand always in the jar and licked it\nthe marmalade. I got the onion to eat. No, I got the bread because the bread I have to hold with\nme. I\u2019m laying like this, still hungry. In the same barrack, across the street, he was a Swiss or\nother nation, he got Red Cross packages.",
        "A: No, not Jewish. When I looked at him, the way he was eating the package -- chocolate and all\nkinds of things. Oh, I cannot go down from bed. Maybe I would steal from him, I don\u2019t know.\nThen I was thinking to myself. Why he can get a package from the Red Cross and I couldn\u2019t\nget it. Unless he -- you know the question.",
        "A: No. To whom am I going to ask a question?",
        "A: And you couldn\u2019t talk to him? You couldn\u2019t buy anything from him? You were too far away?",
        "A: No, no. Then I said to myself. After the war, if I\u2019m going to survive, no Red Cross for me. I\u2019m\ngoing to hate them always and I\u2019m not going to donate a penny to the Red Cross any more. The\nJewish donating money to the Red Cross. I wouldn\u2019t. If they can give a package to him, why\nnot to me? Nobody would know. So I\u2019m laying here hungry, don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on\noutside. All of a sudden, some people, Meyer Pasternak, a lot of people, they run into the\nbarrack, to my barrack! They not allowed to go in. It\u2019s dangerous. They\u2019re hiding. They\u2019re\nhiding 1n this barrack.",
        "A: Underneath the beds, on the ceiling. You can open -- go under the roof. Because they liquidate\nVaihingen.",
        "A: They took the people from Vaihingen to Dachau. Laza Malamit went, Moishe Krol went,\nMeyer Pasternak, he\u2019s in Florida. He\u2019s a smart cookie, he didn\u2019t go. He was hiding. Then the\nSS did find out. They came with guns and they shoot in the barrack. I don\u2019t know how many\npeople got killed or what. I was laying covered up on my place.",
        "A: Yeah, in the barrack. In the ceiling, underneath, everywhere. Because they knew they were\nhiding. But still a lot of people were hiding. Next day, in the morning, just next day, people\ncome in and they brought me white bread. White bread, all kind of things! I said what\nhappened? The French army passed. He said, we are liberated.",
        "A: Yeah, the day was the fifth of April. I was liberated.",
        "A: In Vaihingen.",
        "A: Yeah, Dacha. They suffered a lot. Some dropped dead and some survived.",
        "A: He died in Vaihingen.",
        "A: I was --.",
        "A: No, he died of lungs. When I came out and then I did find out -- Moishe Rafilovish died.",
        "A: Near the end, yes. He told me -- it was a special -- was F and . They took the\ndead people in the back. Over there was an open pit, they throw him in. He told me he took\nRafilovich out there.",
        "A: A short time I was liberated before.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see him any more. Because I was with typhus.",
        "A: In the sick barrack, no. He died in the regular barrack. This barrack was only for contaminated\npeople, typhus. So when I got this bread and they told me we are liberated, I said to myself, I\u2019m\nnot going to lay in bed. I start crawling from bed down out to the field. The wire was cut\nalready, the people cut the wire and I was crawling on the field where the trucks passed, the\nFrench army. They saw me, they stopped the truck and they came down and they brought me a\nlot of stuff, packages and chocolate and bread and everything. I\u2019m laying here with all the stuff,\nI cannot carry.",
        "A: But somebody helped me to take in to the barrack. I went into the barrack and I said why am I\nsitting in this barrack already? I went out in the camp. It took maybe another hour, we still\ndidn\u2019t get out. We are afraid to get out. The French army came in. The French army came in\nand they start putting DDT on everybody. The army never bathed because they were afraid to\ngo in. They put the powder over you, all over the place. The French people start looking\naround and they went in the back and they saw how many people laying in this ditch with the\nstriped suits, a lot. They think hundreds and hundreds. Then they called the mayor from\nVaihingen, the mayor or somebody and the people come over. They should look what they did.\nOne French soldier, a Jewish, I think he was Jewish, he gives me a gun. When he gives me a\ngun, I kill him (?) The people who come to work. They brought people to work, to bury the\npeople. I never got a gun in my hand I says and I cannot kill nobody. He looks at me stupid.\nSo we were staying in this barrack and they caught the SS. Hechay, the two guys in the kitchen\nplus Machine and Bill. There what they did, their job, they cooked. They worked with the\npeople with the Jewish people. They were the top Jewish people cooking. They went home, we\nwere staying on that field to count us. They went through you, like this, and hit here in the\ntesticles. A lot of people they were no men any more. What they went through, they hate you\nall the time. Even you were hiding, holding like this, they caught them. They caught almost all\nthe SS except Miller the . One was there, a Wehrmacht, the , we called him. He\nworked also with them but he was not doing too much damage. The Hoffman.",
        "A: Yeah. Then it was a trial.",
        "A: Not in Vaihingen. It was in Rushtow.",
        "A: You heard Rushtow?",
        "A: Yes, in Baden.",
        "A: Oh, terrible kapo. Terrible. He took a manufacturer from leather from Radom, big man. He is\na - to leather. He should stay on his knees and he should scream loud that his mother\nwas a prostitute. That what he said, he should scream. He give him to drink, urine. He was\nsitting there. His wife went around to the people, we should sign for him. Nobody signed.\nWhat happened to him, I don\u2019t know. I never heard from him again. He didn\u2019t get death.\nHecker, Ros ; , 80 % of the people from the camp, SS, they got death by\nhanging. This was a tribunal from all kinds of nations. and the others, they got\nsentences, not death. Okay.",
        "A: No, when I was liberated, I wasn\u2019t too skinny. I have a picture.",
        "A: Yeah, I was okay. The only thing was bothering me was I was thinking, I\u2019m going to die, is\nhemorrhoids, bleeding. I promised myself if I\u2019m going to be liberated, the first thing I go is\noperate. This comes from family. My father got hemorrhoids too. Was very bad. I did. When\nI was liberated, I went to a hospital and I got operation.",
        "A: We still in Vaihingen. So the French army took us out from there and they cleaned up a little\ntown, a farmer\u2019s town, farmers. They sent the farmers out like the SS did to us. Out and we go\nin. We go in over there everybody got a house. There was chickens, cows, whatever you\nwanted, everything, china, was everything there.

        "A: Libel W was his name and Libel. Libel and Dovit and other butchers. When I\nwas liberated in Vaihingen, we went out. People, healthy people, and I was not so healthy but I\nwalked to town, to organize something. I went into town and I went into a basement in town.\nYou can take everything you want. I saw in this basement, English materials, the best. All kind\nof goodies there. You know what I took? An onion and eggs. The Germans they put in eggs\nfor the winter. How you call it, they put in a thing that eggs should hold, they caulked the eggs\nor something?",
        "A: In the basement. I took eggs and I took an onion. Material, who needs it? Then I organized a\nbicycle. It was on the street. When I went --.\n(Start Side B, Tape 3)",
        "A: So I organized a bicycle. I was carrying this bicycle back to the camp -- we weren\u2019t yet in this\ntown what I told you -- the French --. Dovid Winetard and Libel Winetard and another butcher,\nthey come over to me and say, he wants the bicycle. I cannot fight with them, the Buzima, I\nwas still sick. Then was over there Italic another one with another one and they said with those\ntwo Winetard, rough people. Don\u2019t touch, Itzrek. They said Itzrek is their friend. He was the\nbest donaschneider in Radom, don\u2019t touch him, leave him alone. They didn\u2019t touch me so I got\nthis bicycle. I went into the barrack with the bicycle. Then when we went into this place, this\ntown what the French army give us -- over there we got everything. On top of this, they\nbrought nurses from Paris to treat us. They made us healthy. They ordered the town, should\nbring every day meat, bread and milk for the people here. We got so much that from other\ncamps, everybody did find out. They come here and they took soap and they didn\u2019t want to go\nnowheres, they stayed with us. We stayed there for a while. The best liberation.",
        "A: They give us the best liberation. The Americans, they took the people right away to peel\npotatoes. To work. The English, the same. The Russians, forget it. But the French, they treat\nus and make us healthy. They treat us beautiful. We stayed there till one day a rabbi comes. A\nJewish rabbi.",
        "A: An American. He wants to take us over.",

        "A: Yeah, so we went to the Schausslagen. They supplied us with care packages and food, with\neverything. Had enough to eat. We stayed there. Till one day I decided to go looking for\nsurvivors. It took us Meyer Pasternak, Moishe and another guy. His name Henik,\nMoishe Henik I said already him. He was a policeman.
