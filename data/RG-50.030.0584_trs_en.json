In the meantime my\nmother cooked a very delicious lunch. And from the ponds, either we went to the \u2014\nto Orlova, to the nearest community \u2014 there was a wonderful pastry shop, so my\nfather bought pastries that we all like, especially my mother.

        "A: And geese, and a little bridge to a meadow, and I loved to go to the meadows and\npick Lilies of the Valleys, and \u2014 and forget-me-nots.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and the Polish army marched into our part of Silesia. And as Jews we had to\nvacate. I think they gave us a month to vacate. Now, to go in \u2014 deeper into\nCzechoslovakia, there was no reason to go because Germans already occupied part\nof it. So, we opted to go to Poland where my grandfather had a brother, a wonderful\nman. And we \u2014 we went to a smaller community near Krakow, Poland, and there\nwe wanted to wait for the rest of the family because we \u2014 we knew that they all will\nhave to eventually come.",
        "Q: What was the name of this community, this place?",
        "A: I-In?",

        "A: Prokocim, p-r-o-k-o-c-i-m, Proko \u2014",
        "Q: So when you had to vacate, did that mean you had to leave your store?",
        "A: We had to leave the store, the home, everything. So I do not know, because I was\nnot so interested in the arrangements, I was 10 years old in \u201938, Erik was only eight\nwhen my parents made some kind of arrangement to give the house and the store. I\ndon\u2019t know if they rented it, or what the arrangement was, to some acquaintances of\nthe baker\u2019s family. My \u2014 my best friend\u2019s family, with the understanding that if we\ncome back, it will revert to us. So we left practically everything. When we came to\nRG-50.030*0584 :\nPoland, my \u2014 my father couldn\u2019t speak Polish, none of us could. But we kids\nlearned quite fast, my father never could learn Polish.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 with anybody Polish at all when \u2014 when you still \u2014",
        "A: When they occupied? No, it went very, very quickly. The army occupied and \u2014\nvery quickly. And my grandfather was gravely ill in this time. So I remember that\nthey extended our stay, because Grandpa was dying, so we left after he died.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: In the beginning, in Poland \u2014 well, my \u2014 my mother\u2019s sister, I mentioned her,\nwith the two children, they arrived. And my mother\u2019s younger sister, whom I always\nadored, she married just \u2014 just shortly before the outbreak of the war. And she\nmarried somebody, an engineer from Ostrava, the [indecipherable] city.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: And so we waited for them, and we lived together in a building I think we rented,\nan apartment. And for a few months, we were able to go to school, Erik and I, fora\nshort time.\nRG-50.030*0584 \"",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: Of course, the language was Polish.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, it was not so easy.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what are your memories from that school?",
        "A: Not much.",
        "Q: Not much.",
        "A: Not much, because it was very short.",
        "Q: Did you remember saying goodbye to your best friend before leaving?",
        "A: Yeah, of course, you know, it was very sad to leave everything we loved. And\nthen, in September \u00b039, Poland was occupied, and people were afraid of the \u2014 of the\nGerman army, and many people ran. Whatever \u2014 packed whatever they could carry\nwith them, and ran away from the \u2014 away from the army.",
        "Q: Do you mean Jews and Poles as well?",
        "A: Yes, but mostly Jews were frightened. So, we packed our belongings and my\nmother\u2019s youngest sister, with her young husband, and my family went on a run. We\ncall it in Polish nowa(ph) chechken(ph), now on \u2014 on the run. In the meantime, my\nmother\u2019s other sister, the one with the two children, went back to Slovakia, because\nSlovakia was still at peace at this time, and he, her husband was Slovak, so they\nwent to Slovakia. And we went on the run with my mother\u2019s cousin also. And it was\nRG-50.030*0584 :\na terrible time, because the planes were coming, and we were so tired, carrying our\nbelongings. When the planes came we just hopped into some ditches, and I guess my\nparents had some money to buy food. But it was very hard for them to see us kids to\nwalk and walk and walk and not having a place to rest or wash up. So eventually my\nfather decided to talk to a Polish \u2014 a farmer, and ask him to sell us two horses and a\nbuggy.",
        "Q: And did he?",
        "A: And he did, because he thought, better to get some money now, than if the\nGermans will come and cos \u2014 confiscate this, I'll get nothing. So he sold us two\nhorses. The horses became members of our family. We just \u2014 we loved the horses.",
        "Q: How did you know that? Did your father say that he was \u2014 that this 1s what the\nfarmer told him? Or, you just supposed that this is \u2014 he was \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but I\u2014 my \u2014 my father ma \u2014 might have mentioned something. So\nafter we bought the horses, it was much, much easier. We could rest, we could \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 Just very different.",
        "Q: Do you know what direction you were going in?\nRG-50.030*0584 me",
        "A: Toward the Russian front. And I remember that one time we were \u2014 we had to\ncross a river, and the horses got stuck 1n the river, and we had to unpack some of the\nload, and we had to get up \u2014 out and push \u2014",
        "Q: The buggy.",
        "A: \u2014 the buggy. But we managed. And then, after \u2014 and I don\u2019t know how \u2014 how\nlong we were out around. I don\u2019t know exactly how long [indecipherable]. But\nagain, my father convince another farmer to take us to work for him. Then my father\nand my uncle were work with the horses on the field. My mother and my aunt were\nwhatever needs to be done around the house.",
        "Q: For someone who doesn\u2019t speak Polish, he was very, very good.",
        "A: He was \u2014 he was good, he could communicate. And ma \u2014 my mother could a\nlittle bit better with her \u2014 what she was talking to the peasants \u2014 to the coal miners.\nAnd so the farmer took us, and Erik and I took care of the cows, and I learned very\nwell how to milk cows. And again, I don\u2019t know exactly how long we were there.\nAnd then the Germans occupied Poland, and we decided, you know, let\u2019s go back\nhome.",

        "A: I guess we had rooms. I don\u2019t have exac \u2014 exact recollection of this. I just\nremember the fields and sitting in and milking the cows. And then we came home,\nand my father couldn\u2019t get any job. My uncle also, he was an engineer, but Jews\ncouldn\u2019t get easily job. So, the horses, Fuksa(ph) and Malutki(ph) \u2014",

And one \u2014 one day it was England, next it was Bolivia, next time it was some\nother country. Who will accept us? In the end we were trapped in the worst possible\nplace.",

        "Q: And why would you say it was the worst possible place?\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201c",
        "A: Because Poland was the worst possible place. One day I was walking with my\nbrother, and my cousin, who had beautiful blonde hair. He was eight years old \u2014 he\nwas nine \u2014 nine, close to 10, my \u2014 Erik also, and I was 12. I was so proud at this\ntime that I could wear the \u2014 the white band. I was \u2014 I felt so grown up. I can wear it,\nErik cannot, he was not yet 10 years old. So one day we went for a walk and a\nPolish teenager approached us, lit a match, and threw it into my cousin Walter\u2019s\nbeautiful blonde hair. I felt so responsible, I was the older \u2014 I was terrified. I put out\nthe \u2014 the fire from his \u2014 and we ran home, and from this day on, I was terrified to\nwear this white band.",
        "Q: Was this the first time you saw an \u2014 you felt anti-Semitism from Poland \u2014 from\nPoles.",
        "A: That was \u2014 maybe one time before. I had the Christian friend who took me to\nchurch once with her, and I heard some people making some anti-Semitic\ncomments, and that was the first time. And then the first really shocking experience\nwas when men, age I think 16 to 65, if I recall it correctly, had to assemble on an\nassembly place somewhere. My father and my uncle were in there and we all went\nwith him, and we waited there all day. We brought him some food, and we didn\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s going to happen. In the evening they were loaded on trucks and taking\naway. We had no idea where they went. I forgot to tell also, that during the time\nwhen my father was working with the horses and moving furniture, we had the\nRG-50.030*0584\nneighbor, also in Poland, a butcher neighbor. And he suggested to my father and my\nuncle, they should go with him out of town to buy illegal meat, so he could sell it.\nAnd my father wanted so desperately for the family to have something to live on,\nthat they agreed to do it. And they went, first of all, they were supposed to wear the\nbands, which they didn\u2019t. They were not allowed to leave the community.",
        "Q: And they did.",
        "A: And they did. Second \u2014 and thirdly, they were bringing in illegal meat. So, there\nwere dangers on so many side. When they \u2014 from the minute they left until they\ncame home, we were \u2014 this I remember so vividly, we were so afraid for their lives.\nWhen \u2014",
        "Q: Had you seen anyone \u2014 I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you \u2014 have you seen anyone at that\npoint, murdered? Or had you seen any corpses, or had you heard any stories?",
        "A: No, no, not at this time. Not at this time. It was just this terrible fear that if he\nwould be caught, he would be shot. There\u2019s no question, you know, this fear. So,\nthey went and when they were suppo \u2014 we knew approximately when they will be\nback, usually it was at night they were coming back. So we took turns waiting on the\nstreet to listen if they are coming, and when we heard the horses from far, it was\nsuch a relief. And they went \u2014 when they came home, they were s \u2014 frozen, literally.\nThe people and the \u2014 and the horses, everything was frozen, everything.",
        "Q: So you meant \u2014 it was wintertime when they had done \u2014\nRG-50.030*0584",
        "A: It was wintertime and when \u2014 I remember my \u2014 when my mother was taking my\nfather\u2019s socks off, 1t was all ice, all ice. It was a terrible time for them. Anyway, so\nmy father was taken away on trucks, and we didn\u2019t know when they will come back,\nif they will come back. Few days later, they did come back, and told us that they are\nworking \u2014 I forgot also to s \u2014 to mention that when we came back after this running,\nwe were put into ghettos. So we moved from Prokocim to Wieliczka, which was a\nwell known city in Poland, to a ghetto. When my father was taken to this \u2014 on\ntrucks, and when he came back, he said that they are working on the railroad tracks\nin Prokocim, where we used to live. So, they must have gotten permission to come\non train, because otherwise they wen \u2014 would not have been able to \u2014 to come. So,\none day they came home and they said that they heard that Jews from Wieliczka\nwill be deported. It sounded sad, but we still didn\u2019t know what deported means, and",
        "Q: So they were able to come back and forth afterwards?",
        "A: In-\u2014 right, in the evening. And they decided that first they have to save the kids,\nso first Erik and me. We couldn't go all together, because a big group would \u2014",
        "Q: Be most \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 be too dangerous. So they decided one night, the kids are going, so we walked\nthe whole night until at dawn we came to my father\u2019s \u2014 to the railroad tracks where\nFather was working, and my father hid us under a boxcar. He must have been sure\nRG-50.030*0584 oS\nthat this boxcar will not go anywhere. We were supposed to stay under the boxcar,\nnot to move, not to talk, not to whisper, until e \u2014 the evening, when my father would\ntake us out and take us into hiding. Well, I can, as a parent, I can imagine what it\nmust have been for my father having us under the boxcar, and my brother was a very\nbig rascal, so \u2014 very, very. And my father came, they took us into hiding to a Polish\nfamily. And the next day they went to get Mother and my Aunt Polly. My mother\ndecided that she has still some things to put in order and that nothing can happen so\nfast. My aunt should go and she promised she will come the next day. My aunt, of\ncourse, didn't want to leave my mother, but in the end my mother convinced her go,\nI am surely going to come the next day. The following day was too late. They\nalready \u2014 my \u2014 my father and uncle heard from some Germans who were in charge\nand liked my father and my uncle that Jews from Wieliczka are already being\nloaded on trains. My uncle somehow managed to convince the Germans to \u2014 to\ncome with him and bring some \u2014 some papers that Mother is needed to work in the\nkitchen on the railroad tracks. But they went to the trains, but they could not find\nher. Well, when we heard that Mother was taken, we were devastated, absolutely\ndevastated. The only thing we thought, well, maybe she went to another camp,\nmaybe the war will be over next week, and we will see her again.",

And, so my \u2014 we were\ntogether, and my \u2014 we were hiding in three different places, one was \u2014 I don\u2019t want\nRG-50.030*0584 _\nto talk so much \u2014 one was on a roof and it was diagonally from a police station, and\nit was in the city where we used to live, so people knew us. So my father and uncle\nused to come in the evening, take off their bands, and always watching at night so\nnobody would see them.",
        "Q: Were you like in the attic area?",
        "A: In the attic area. Another place was we were 1n a mai \u2014 on a main street, then one\nnight there was banging on the door, and we thought where somebody reported us,\nbut it happened that it was an accident between a motorcycle and a car, and they\nwere calling for help, so they were banging on the door. But everything was so\nfrightening, because \u2014 and then, the third place was the most unusual. The third\nplace, the Germans who liked my father and my uncle, offered that we can hide in\nthe storage room of the building where the German and Polish offices \u2014 officers\nwere, in the cellar.",
        "Q: These were German soldiers?",
        "A: N-N-No, German \u2014 I don\u2019t think they were Nazis, they were German overseers\non the railroad tracks, and \u2014",

        "A: They were not military, but they were \u2014 right, not military. But I don\u2019t think that\nthey were SS. I \u2014 they might have been. They might have been, but I am not sure. So\nthey offered we can hide in the cellar. The cellar, all that was in the cellar were\ncrates, huge crates like from some machines. And the entrance to this was from the\nfront of the building. No windows. No windows that \u2014 down to the cellar. So, we\ndidn\u2019t know what weather was outside, we didn\u2019t know anything. The only people\nthat knew that we are there, were our Polish neighbors, former Polish neighbor and\nI\u2019m also forgot-got to tell you that my parents were so desperate to get Erik and me\nout when there was so much fear that we\u2019ll be deported, or whatever, that the Polish\nneighbors send once their son, in the early 20s to bring Erik and me to their house to\nhide. It was before we were hiding in the other places. Wer \u2014 he came, and we were\nsitting on the train, Erik and I already, with this Polish guy, when I decided I\u2019m not\ngoing anywhere with my parent \u2014 without my parents. So I ran out of the train, of\ncourse, Erik a \u2014 behind me, and the guy behind me, and my parents were very, very\ndistraught that here \u2014 again we are here in danger, that we didn\u2019t go into hiding. So,\nthe only people that knew that we are hiding there were the Polish family, and two\npriests from a nearby church. And once in awhile they used to bring something and\nhide in the shrubs, soups, coffee, you know, in the shrubs. So, my par \u2014 my father or\nuncle took it out from under the shrubs at night. At night people were not working in\nthis building, you know. But \u2014\nRG-50.030*0584 ut",

We had\nsome bottles to urinate in, in one of the crates, and every time we heard \u2014 and it was\nquite often \u2014 Polish or \u2014 or German voices in front, talking in front of the door, we\njumped into the big crate, and we didn\u2019t breathe.",

        "A: Fine.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: But still, Poles were very anti-Semitic. If anybody would see my father going\nthere at night, we would \u2014 we would have been finished. The priests were\nwonderful, and they offered to do Aryan paper for us. And we decided maybe that\nwould be another possibility to save ourself. So somehow my father and my uncle\nobtained some hair dyeing solution. My aunt had beautiful black hair, bu \u2014 she was a\nvery pretty woman, very pretty woman. My father and my uncle could have passed\nano \u2014 as non-Jews. My uncle had blue eyes, blondish hair. My father also didn\u2019t\nhave Jewish features, yo-you know. But Erik and I and my aunt \u2014 so we decided, at\nleast my aunt, when she dyes her hair, so it will be less risky. So they brought this\nsolution, and I was \u2014 they went to work, my father and my uncle, and I was pouring\nthis solution in her \u2014 into her hair, and rubbing it in, and rubbing it in, and she \u2014 it\ndidn\u2019t do anything. She said put more, put more, put more. So I was pouring more\nand rubbing in, and suddenly her hair was coming out in chunks. And sh \u2014 I could\nsee that she was ready to scream in \u2014 you know, how painful it was, and her hair was\nburned, her skull was burned. And here I was a 12 year old kid, 13 year old kid, and\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201d\nI felt I did it to her, I did it to her. This \u2014 what could we do?

So, by the evening when they came back, her hair was\ngone, her beautiful hair was gone, and this was the end of Aryan paper. While we\nwere there, we heard about a labor camp, Jewish labor camp, in walking distance\nactually, in Prokocim. So, I think the grow \u2014 grownups might have thought, well,\nit\u2019s probably safer to survive in a ca \u2014 labor camp. Labor, it means working, so we\nwill work, and the war will be probably \u2014 few months the war \u2014 war will be over.\nIt\u2019s surely safer than in the cellar, e-every moment was really fear, fear, fear.

So, when we found \u2014 it was scary to find ourselves behind fences,\nsuddenly, not be \u2014 being trapped again, but we figured we will work, and I was\nworking in the kitchen. I had to peel potatoes.\nRG-50.030*0584 *",

We assumed that if we obey all the rules, we will\nlive.

And one day we\nwent sitting there in the evening when we heard terrible shots, and we froze, because\nwe haven\u2019t si-si \u2014 heard anything like it before.

Also, another memory I have of this camp 1s that there was a\nyoung, married woman, Mrs. Unger \u2014 Ungar, u-n-g-a-r. Her husband was also in\nRG-50.030*0584 ~\ncamp.

He was \u2014 and one night we\nwere in beds when two or three of the Nazis came in and ask, is Mrs. Ungar here?\nAnd so she said yes. So they called her, they asked her, what is your name?

I heard that this Goeth is a brutal \u2014 he 1s really a subhuman, you\nknow, brute \u2014 very, very cruel. And \u2014 but the choice was not our made, and one day\nthey liquidated Plasz\u00e9w labor camp, and we had to walk to Plasz\u00e9w camp.",

As soon as we reached the gates of Plasz\u00e9w, they separated the\nchildren from the grownups. There was a lot of crying, a lot of screaming and\nbegging and children didn\u2019t want to leave, parents didn\u2019t want to leave, and it was\nhorrible. It was just absolutely horrible.

I found myself in this room with all\nthe women, and there were big windows. And we were \u2014 the \u2014 the building was on a\nhill, and the women close to the window noticed that our men are below, ina\nbarrack below, but there was a fence between us. So the women who were near the\nwindow were calling the names of the people whom they knew, you know, that we\nrecognize some people, so there was a lot of calling, come here, you know, your\nfather, your brother, whoever. And I don\u2019t know how long it took til I \u2014 finally I was\ncalled, and my father was out. And all I s \u2014 oh, on the day when I found myself in\nthe barrack, we heard terrible machine gun fire.",

So when I came\nto the window, I ask my father, Erik? I just called Erik? And my father just did,\nyou know, like I don\u2019t know.",

And \u2014 but I had\nthis \u2014 this horrible feeling, this horrible premonition that they were our children who\nare being killed. The next day we were taken to work and we were carrying big,\nwooden boards, like for building barracks. Well, you can imagine, I was a small\nteenager. It was very difficult for me to carry the boards, and the camp was quite\nhilly. You know, up the hill, down the hill. And always when we were marching in\nthe group, we were searching for people. I always for my father. Until the second\nday or third day, I don\u2019t know exactly, because the whole thing is like a huge\nnightmare for me. Finally I saw my father\u2019s group, and he was searching for me. So\nwhen we \u2014 they were walking opposite us, so he came to me and he grabbed me, and\nI could barely recognize my father. I could barely recognize him, he \u2014 something\nterrible happened to him, I knew. So, he \u2014",
        "Q: What did he look like?",
        "A: \u2014 grabbed me, just \u2014 he age, I cannot tell you, beyond \u2014 beyond recognition. So,\nhe grabbed me and held me, and I said, Erik? And he said, not here. That\u2019s all he\ncould say, and \u2014 and you know, we couldn\u2019t talk, he had to leave. And a few days\nRG-50.030*0584 .\nlater, we were very short time in the camp, we were \u2014 we were again herded to the\nrailroad station to be shipped somewhere else. And when we were standing at the\nrailroad station, my father again managed to find me and came to me, and held me\nand said \u2014 pointed to a rock on a hill ... and said, do you see this hill? That\u2019s where\nErik is. Only when we were in the other next camp, I found out that when they shot\nthe children, they were covered with a little bit soil, but they selected 50 men to bury\nthem, and my father was among them.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And he \u2014 he could see Erik\u2019s hand, cause he had the ring. So, from there \u2014 thank\nyou \u2014 from there we went on our first train journey, and I don\u2019t have to tell you what\nthe trains were like, I\u2019m sure you heard it from many people. Packed like sardines,\npeople were crying, screaming, silent, disbelief, you know, we \u2014 resignation, well,\nyou name every feeling. No place to go to the bathroom, I \u2014 when I think of it today,\nI think how humiliating it was, you know, to be \u2014 to urinate right there, the smell,\nthe hunger, th-the thirst, everything.

        "Q: Had you had any conversations with him \u2014 when everything started, and you\nwere in Poland and things kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse, did\nhe ever sit down or \u2014 did you have any \u2014 any discussions about what was going on,\nor did he try to keep it all inside so to spare \u2014",

        "A: And by then I spoke very well Polish. I actually wrote already Polish poetry by\nthen, yeah. So we \u2014 when we came to the camp, people were ask if anybody has\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201c\nsome technical or mechanical skills. And my father, thinking quickly, thought it\u2019s\nprobably a good idea to have something, so he came forward, and they brought some\ntools to show him if he can recognize what they are, because, you know, people\nwere lying. So my father could recognize it because he saw it in the store. So, he\nwas working in a\u2014 in a workshop, and his shifts were always daytime. I was taken\nto ammunition factory, and my shifts were 12 hour shifts, one weekday, one\nweeknight. My work was extremely difficult, extremely difficult. That was probably\nmy most difficult time in camp, physically. I was given \u2014 hand a tray with hundred\npieces of ammunition, tha-that big, and I had to carve rings around the ammunition.\nMy work was standing at a huge machine, 12 hours shifts, no place to sit or rest. I\nhad to open the machine, put the \u2014 take the ammunition, put it into the machine, take\nthe other ammunition out, like two motions. Oil was dripping on the ammunition\nbecause the ammunition came out quite hot. My finger was burned to the bone, so\npainful, I \u2014 and standing 12 hour and this motion to open this big machine, it was\nunbelievable. I was so hungry, we were so hungry, so tired. I\u2014 when I talked for the\nfirst time to a group of students, and I was showing them how I opened the machine,\nI stopped talking. I forgot that I have a group of kids listening to me. I realized what\nhappened to my finger, you know, the flesh was so burned out, it grew together, but\n\u2014 the skin grew together, but the flesh completely deformed my finger. It was \u2014 it\nwas very difficult, it was clearly extremely difficult work. One \u2014\nRG-50.030*0584 *",

        "Q: What kind \u2014 yeah, what kind of \u2014 were \u2014 were these bullets, were these \u2014",
        "A: Bullets, bullets about that \u2014",
        "Q: Bullets.",
        "A: \u2014 big, and \u2014 and I had to test them through a gauge, and if it slipped through the\ngauge \u2014 it had to click into it, if you \u2014 if it went through, I had to discard the\nammunition and call a technician, you know, mechanic to \u2014 to adjust the machine.\nBut every so often I had to test it. And one time, I was so tired, I was just so, so\ntired, I cou \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stand any more, so I crouched somewhere near the machine\nfor a few minutes and I fell asleep and the German supervisor came and screamed at\nme, and \u2014 when we were \u2014 in the evening we were \u2014 we got a bowl of soup, and a\nslice of bread. We experimented with the bread. Sometimes we starved ourselves to\nkeep the bread for the next day, that if we have two slices, we\u2019ll not be so hungry.\nWe still went hungry because we \u2014 it was so painful, the hunger was so different\nfrom when we are hungry here. So different, it never went out of our mind. It was\nconstantly on our mind. One day we made crumbs, and we were hoping that if we\neat little crumbs, it will last. No matter what we did, it wasn\u2019t. So one day, we were\nstanding for soup at night and my father didn\u2019t come. We always, when I had the\nday shift, we always stood together. The prisoners always let me stand, because I \u2014 I\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201c\u00b0\nwas one of the very few children. So they always protected me, and you know, let\nme stand next to my father. And on this evening my father didn\u2019t come. So I didn\u2019t\nknow what happened to him. I took my bowl of soup and I went to his barrack. He\nwas in bed, and he said that he was too tired to come. I knew that it is impossible\nbecause we were so hungry, would have crawled, you know, to \u2014 to get this piece of\nbread. Only later I found out that he went by the camp\u2019s kitchen, and he found a\ncarrot in a trashcan, which he took for me, and they caught him and they beat him so\nterribly that he couldn\u2019t move. But he wanted to hide his pain from me. Then, one\nday, it was Yom Kippur, the holiest day, and \u2014 and people knew that I was writing,\nand so they ask me if I could read something for a \u2014 they wanted to have a special \u2014\nsome way to celebrate the holiday. I knew that my father will be at work, so I wrote\nsomething. Not a poem, just a story, my memories of Yom Kippur at home,\ncomparing it to what we have now. And it was packed, it was packed and when I\nwas reading it, I heard somebody in the back crying. And I \u2014 when I looked, I saw\nmy father. You know, I didn\u2019t know that he will be there. And then my birthday is in\nDecember, but of course, who \u2014 who wanted to think about birthday? Every day was\nthe same, we didn\u2019t know even what day it was because each day was the same.",
        "Q: December what?",
        "A: December 22\". And when we stood the line \u2014 in line for food, my father gave me\na birthday gift. I couldn\u2019t believe this. It was a comb this big, it was made of steel,\nRG-50.030*0584 a\nhe made it in the workshop. Teeth not completely even, and I thought it was the\nmost beautiful gift. I carried it with me, I slept on it, I \u2014 I didn't leave it off my side.\nI couldn\u2019t believe how he risk his life to make it. If he would have been caught for\nthis lousy, rotten carrot, then he \u2014 he was beaten like this, they would catch him. So\nI was really \u2014 I loved this comb. Then, when I finished my night shift, some of \u2014 a\nlittle bit earlier, before the men went to work the day shift, so I sneaked into my\nfather\u2019s barrack. I knew what I'll find. All the men were sleeping and my father\u2019s\nsitting next to a freestanding stove, sitting. I walked in, not talking, sat next to my\nfather ... we just held each other. And that way we shared our \u2014 our love.",
        "Q: He sounds like an amazing man, an amazing \u2014",
        "A: Our \u2014 our fear and our \u2014 our hopes. One day in December \u2014 okay \u2014 then one day\nI was working and it was almost the end of the \u2014 oh, I \u2014 I have to mention \u2014 mention\nthat once a month we were taken on trucks to Camp A, which was the main camp.\nAnd I found out that my aunt and uncle are on Camp A, and that my aunt, my\nbeautiful aunt was selected to be the housekeeper of Cuneman(ph).",
        "Q: I was going to ask you about Cuneman(ph), we hadn\u2019t talked about him yet.",
        "A: He was a hunchback.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Always walking with a dog or two, always. And my aunt was his housekeeper.\nSo, when we came to \u2014 they took us to delouse, because there was a terrible\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201d\nepidemic of typhoid in the camp, and then it was already under control, but every so\noften, they took us to delouse us, our clothes, our hair, us, to Camp A. When I came\nto Camp A, a group of people were walking there, and I looked at them and I said,\nare these human beings? Are these human beings? The people were yellow green;\ntheir eyes, their teeth, their fingernails, everything was yellow green. I said, who are\nthese people? They were people from Camp C, the worst of the camp, which the\npeople were working \u2014 working with poisonous gases, and they were dying a slow\ndeath. It was \u2014 the book I have about Skarzysko-Kamienna called, \u201cDeath Comes\nin Yellow,\u201d is because of the people. When we came to werk A, often, we have to \u2014\nthey assembled us on a big assembly place, and we had to watch executions of\nprisoners by hanging or by shooting. So, when I was \u2014 when we were supposed to\ngo to werk A, my emotions were really torn, because I was so happy to be able to\nsee my beloved aunt and uncle, but I was so afraid to see an-another execution. The\nworse were also \u2014 okay \u2014 one day I was so tired working at this huge machine, and it\nwas the end of the shift, and I was \u2014 I just didn\u2019t know what to do, I just \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014\nI was almost sleeping and working. And the obermeister came to check the\nammunition, and went to \u2014 took some of mine and it went through, and he\u2019s got,\nwas ist ein das, what is this? Then he took the next one and it went through, and he\nstarted louder, was ist ein das? And then the next one, and all of it was bad, all of it\nwas bad. How could I tell him that I just could not function? I \u2014 I \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t do\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201d\nit any more, I was so tired, and so hungry, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. So after\nthe \u2014 after a few, he took the ammunition and with every one he knocked on my hair\nand screamed, was ist ein das, was ist ein das? And then he walked away to his\noffice, which was off the machine room. After a few minutes he came back and\ncalled me. As I was walking behind him, I knew. I knew what it meant. And I could\ns \u2014I could see the silence of the \u2014 I could hear the silence of my fellow prisoners\nand I could see their tears as I was ma-marching behind him. And all I remember is\nthinking, what will it do to my father when he finds out that he had lost me too? I \u2014 I\nknew what my fate will be. I came to his office, and he looked at me and looked at\nme and looked at me and paused. And then he said, take the broom, sweep my\noffice, and go back to work. I don\u2019t know if my youth moved him, if he had maybe a\ndaughter my age. But something moved him. I also am convinced that when I was\nnot taken in Plaszow, it was because I was small and I was standing behind\nsomebody and they simply did not see me. Because there\u2019s absolutely no reason\nwhy I am here and my brother and others are dead. Th \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m convince of it,\nthat they just did not see me. And it\u2019s not because of I \u2014 because I was hiding,\nbecause I wasn\u2019t. I\u2014 you know. So \u2014 so that was my other miracle,\n[indecipherable] that I went behind him and \u2014 and he decided, go back to work. But\nwhen my father found out, he was so worried that I will not survive this camp,\nbecause it was such horrible work, that when he \u2014 when we went to see Aunt\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201d\nPauline, he \u2014 and she also, was terribly worried about me. So they decided that she\nwill talk to Cuneman(ph) to move my father and me to werk A.",
        "Q: Was it successful?",
        "A: After a few months, I was moved, but my father did not get permission. So here I\n\u2014I-\u2014J-\u2014J adored my father, so I was again torn. It was easier for me, but I was on\n[indecipherable] every minute worried about my father. The worst were the\nselection. They used to come on trucks, the Germans, and always when we heard\nthem coming on trucks, it was this fear. We had to line up and they \u2014 they walked\nand they said, du, du \u2014 you, you, you \u2014 and we never knew, should we look at them,\nshould we look up, sideways, back, which way? Should we stand crooked, crou \u2014\nyou know, never \u2014 how can we avoid du, because we knew what it meant. And the\nfirst people who were always taken were people with white hair.

But I decided that there is no way, no way anybody is going to take away my\ncomb. But what do I do? They searched us, they \u2014 we \u2014 they stripped us, we had to\ntake our clothes off, how can I keep it? So, we had wooden clogs. I started kicking\nthe ground under me, and scratching and here, with all the women around me, and I\n\u2014I kicked a hole deep enough, and I buried my comb, with the hope that when I ever\nget out, I'll find it. As long as I was in Buchenwald, I was kicking and kicking and\nwalking all around the camp, because I had no idea where I buried it. When we\narrived I didn\u2019t know the physical layout of the camp, so I was never able to find it,\nRG-50.030*0584 *\u00b0\nnever. And when I tell this story to my little students, the especially little, will you\ngo back, will you look for it, will you \u2014 I said, I was there and I didn\u2019t find it. So \u2014",

        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So-",
        "Q: In Buchenwald.",
        "A: Buchenwald was \u2014 work in Buchenwald was easier than in Skarzysko-\nKamienna. I was again in ammunition fa-factory. I was working on bombs. And \u2014\nbut it was sitting, there were 10 of us in a row, including my aunt. I had two sisters\non each side. They were older, I was the youngest, and we were cleaning with big,\nmetal rods, we were cleaning scratches inside of the bombs. I learned the most\nbeautiful poetry during this time, Polish poetry. The two sisters started one day to \u2014\njust bring something from the outside world. And I was so hungry to learn, I said,\nteach me. And so they started \u2014 I started memorizing 1n the words which we\ncouldn\u2019t pronoun \u2014 which I could not remember. Somebody smuggled a piece of\nchalk, so I wrote it on the bomb. And it \u2014 I \u2014 I just \u2014 several poems, but one was a\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201d\nvery, very long poem about the father in Lebanon, who has, I think seven children,\nand each one died of a epidemic, and he describes the death of each of his children\nand his wife. And at the end it says, where the cemetery is, there is my way\n[indecipherable], and it\u2019s a very beautiful poem. And after the war, everybody,\nfrom my friends who went to Poland, I said, please try to find the poem for me.\nAfter years, a colleague of mine in school said, Edith, I think I found the poem for\nyou. My aunt, here in Washington has the book of poetry, and the poem is in it. She\nbrought me \u2014 it was like finding a beloved friend, but I couldn\u2019t believe, 14 pages,\nthat I learned 14 pages like this, and this was not the only poem. I have it, I printed it\nseveral times and it got \u2014 and I thought no, I \u2014 impossible that I learned all of it, but\nwhen I went through all of it, the poem, I remembered that I knew every single line.\nI don\u2019t know the poem now in its \u2014 but I still remember the first. But I \u2014 it was really\n\u2014 it meant so much for me to \u2014 in this camp, also one time somebody smuggled\npieces of cloth, different pieces of cloth and needle and thread. And one of the\nwomen was a seamstress, so she made beautiful collars for us on our prisoner\u2019s\ndress. I have my prisoner\u2019s dress.",
        "Q: You have your prisoner\u2019s dress?",
        "A: It will go to the museum, but only after I [indecipherable] I'll show it to you.",
        "Q: Okay.\nRG-50.030*0584",
        "A: Okay. So, on our prisoner dresses, we had this \u2014 we knew we cannot walk out of\nthe room, but for just few seconds, we felt we had the most beautiful party dresses,\nyou know? In Buchenwald, I had a very good overseer. He must have been in \u2014\nworking in \u2014 in this ammunition company before the war. Not a Nazi. I knew that he\nfelt very sorry for me, he was a very kind man. Sometimes he brought a piece of\nbread, sometimes an apple, and he hid it, and he told me where to find it. As I told\nyou before, my mother used to sing German operettas and songs. One day he started\nsinging a song that my mother used to sing. And it was like somebody took a knife\nand went through my heart. I burst out in tears, and he came to me and asked me,\nwarum weinst du? Why \u2014 why are you crying? Well, I was so choked up that I\ncouldn\u2019t answer. The next day when he came, I ask him, please sing it. He said,\nplease tell me why did you cry? So I told him. And he tra \u2014 look at me, and he said,\nI'll never sing this song again. In this camp was \u2014 were some non-Jewish prisoners,\nthey were not the same prisoners as we were, but they were still prisoners. And there\nwas a Belgian young man, an electrician, who was working fixing something. And I\ncall him my friend, although we never spoke. We communicated with our eyes and\nour smiles. And he used to \u2014 to point where he put newspaper clippings, so I would\nknow that it\u2019s coming to the end. And I will read to you the end of \u2014 of the war,\nokay\u2019? Cause that\u2019s what I\u2019m usually \u2014",
        "Q: So, did you [indecipherable]\nRG-50.030*0584 ~",
        "A: This is my precious gift story about the comb, which was published in several pa\n\u2014 places, including this one here.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Excuse me, I\u2019m going to the bathroom. Do you want \u2014 [break]",
        "Q: I don\u2019t have to say anything then? Okay, all right. So \u2014",
        "A: Last weeks before liberation, Leipzig, Buchenwald. My father was also in\nBuchenwald.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know it.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know for a long time, but then one day some German \u2014 some Nazis came\nand said that we are allowed to write a short card to Buchenwald men\u2019s group. I\ndidn\u2019t know if my father is dead or not, but I wrote. And my aunt wrote to her\nhusband, and I got an answer back. We could all write just I\u2019m fine, I am happy, you\nknow, and \u2014 and \u2014 just few words. I gave the letters to the museum. So I knew then\nmy father was in Buchenwald.",
        "Q: And he was alive.",
        "A: And he survived. Okay, it was at the end of March or beginning of April, 1945.\nFrom newspaper clippings smuggled into the ammunition factory by a non-Jewish\nBelgian friend, we knew that the situation did not look good for the Germans. One\nevening, as we lay stretched on our plank beds, we heard sounds of shelling, gunfire\nand explosions. We knew that these were the sounds of the American front being so\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201c\"\nnear. What sweet sounds they were. Our hopes for being soon free rose high.\nUnfortunately, our euphoria was very short-lived. Around nine or 10 o\u2019clock the\nsame evening, we were ordered to assemble outside on the assembly field. I don\u2019t\nremember if we were told for what purpose. We were given some supply of food,\nand we were marched out of the camp into the darkness of the night. About 5,000\nwomen began their new journey. A journey which became known as the death\nmarch. We marched and marched. Days replaced nights. We kept marching, given\nshort periods of rest. We mar-marched in sunshine and we marched in the rain. We\nmarched through towns, and we marched through villages. No one knew where we\nwere going. Later we found out that we were walking between the American and the\nRussian front. While we were marching, we were heavily guarded by our captors.\nThey were working in shifts. Replacements for them were coming on trucks. Food\nwas delivered to them, while our was long gone. The officers among our captors\nwere driving by in comfortable cars, enjoying the sight of marching subhuman\ncreatures. Their spotless starch uniforms were highly polish \u2014 and highly pol-\npolished boots, must have been quite a contrast with the wrecks and filths we were\nin. I remember when others were given to rest, we turned the seams of our prisoners\nstriped clothes from inside out, and squashed as many lice as we could between our\nfingernails. The itching was unbearable. By now some of the events are blurred.\nOthers are more deeply engraved in my memory. I still can see half faces of the\nRG-50.030*0584 \"\nGerman civilian population, the other half hidden behind the curtain, watching as we\nmarched. What were they thinking? What did they feel? Once, taking a rest near\nwoods, we heard shots. We found out later that someone was shot trying to escape.\nHow could anyone hope to escape? Besides being so heavily guarded, we had only\nour prisoner\u2019s clothes on. How far could we go without being caught? So we kept\nmarching. We ate grass, and even this was forbidden, if a cruel guard chose to do so.\nDays and nights went by. More and more people were unable to keep walking, and\neach of us was too weak to be able to help someone else. We could hardly lift our\nown feet. How dreadful and painful it was to have to leave someone dear behind to\ndie. We came up on a desolate concentration camp. There was no movement\nanywhere. It was so eerie. Where were the people? Were they also marching, or\nwere they shipped into crematoria? When we still had strength to talk, we kept\nevaluating our situation. One terrifying thought went through our minds. We were\nfearful, and then when the Germans will realize that they have lost, they will shoot\nus anyway. We imagined that they will need our uniforms to make an easier escape.\nThere was so little hope for our survival, one way or the other. How they do it, keep\nmarching. My most vivid memories are of a situation which occurred on a farmland.\nNaturally, we were very hungry, and exhausted when others came to rest. Some\nprisoner noticed in the distance of the field, a wagon loaded with potatoes, which\nseveral farmers were about to plant. As soon as some of the women prisoner noticed\nRG-50.030*0584 \u00b0*\nit, they began running to grab some potatoes. My Aunt Polly started to run. I\ngrabbed her with the little strength I had left, and pleaded with her not to go. Just\nthen rifle fire started blasting and that women were falling everywhere. A young\nwoman, she could have been between 18 - 20 years old, was shot in the leg. She\ntried to get up, but couldn\u2019t. She was not too far from us. What pain and terror were\nreflected in her eyes. She screamed and pleaded for help. The Germans took their\ntime to kill her. We kept walking, leaving more and more people behind, often\nstepping over them. As we grew weaker and could hardly walk with our eyes open,\nletting ourselves to be pushed by the mass of people, my \u2014 my aunt and our small\ngroup of friends around us tried to reassure ourself that one or the other are still with\nus. From time to time we called each other\u2019s names in weak voices, and our\nresponses brought some relief to the others. The rest periods were welcome, but it\nwas increasingly more difficult to get up, and to keep marching. Actually, for most\nof us, 1t was impossible to get up, but as soon as a shot was fired into the helpless\nprisoners, we collected our bit \u2014 last bits of energy and kept going. One day we\nfound ourself on another farmland. There was even food for us in kettles in a huge\nbarn. After eating and some rest, we were ordered once more to get up and to\ncontinue to march. Only this time, some of us were no longer able to do so. We\nreached our limits. We had to give up. We were told that if we will not vacate this\nbarn, it will be locked and burned with us in it. It seemed that our fate was sealed.\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201c\nSome women were still able to get up and go. We found out later that they were\nshot, and that that Nazis did use their uniforms. As for us in the barn, freedom came\nin the last moment, and a Russian soldier on a motorcycle, leading the way to more\nRussian soldiers on trucks appeared and prevented the burning of the barn, with our\nliving corpses in it. I have no recollection of what I felt at the time of our liberation.\nI \u2014I don\u2019t remember if I fully comprehended that it was all over, and we were\nfinally and truly free.",
        "Q: Did you have any opportunity to sleep on those marches, or during the nighttime\nthey kept you moving?",
        "A: They kept us moving all the time, we must have slept, you know, whenever they\ntold us to rest, but \u2014 but it was more and more difficult to kept marching. We just\nhad less and less energy. We didn't eat for days.",
        "Q: Do you know where you ended up, on that farm?",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: What was the place?",
        "A: The place was called Orschatz.",
        "Q: Orschatz.",
        "A: Here \u2014 here is it.",
        "Q: In that paper that you showed me before?",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Orschatz. I see. To Orschatz, where I was liberated. And where is Orschatz, is\nit still in Germany, or is it \u2014",
        "A: Actually, Orschatz is not terribly far from Buchenwald, you know, we were\nwalking back and forth, they were marching us \u2014 the Russians came closer, so they\nmarched us toward the American front. The American toward the Russians, so we\nwere \u2014",
        "Q: I see. It was not in a line, it was 1n a circle line.",
        "A: It \u20141t was \u2014",
        "Q: And did you \u2014",
        "A: Well, when we were liberated, this is a mystery that I have not solved \u2014",
        "Q: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m so [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You want to show us something?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019ll take this off, we\u2019ll pause it for a sec \u2014 [break] Just a little bit. This is\namazing shape.\nRG-50.030*0584 \u00b0\u00b0",
        "A: This \u2014",
        "Q: Are we on? The dress? Okay.",
        "A: This dress, if you see it in the museum, it\u2019s another dress, but this dress, as I\nmention, I was working with ammunitions \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 oil \u2014",
        "Q: It must have been \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 was dripping on it, it got dirty, 1t had to be washed. This is the only thing we\nhad for spring, summer, fall and winter. In summer it was hot, in wonter \u2014 winter it\nwas extremely cold in the severe winters of Poland or Germany. Can you imagine\nwhen we had to wash it in the washroom, with a little bit soap, whatever, and we had\nto squeeze the water out, and had no energy, we were we \u2014 weak and hungry, so we\ncouldn\u2019t squeeze it completely, no place to dry. We put it on our plank beds in the\nevening, and in the morning when we were called to roll call, we had to wear it wet\nas it was, and stand in the most severe winters of \u2014 in Poland, or Germany. In a few\nsecond being outside, it turn into a sheet of ice. How did we just, you know \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m amazed.",
        "A: \u2014 die from \u2014 from this?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Just from this.\nRG-50.030*0584 \"\u00b0",
        "Q: And your number was 781?",
        "A: Right. It\u2019s quite early.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 I see all these spots that are repaired. Did they cap \u2014 happen later, after\nyou were liberated?",
        "A: I\u2014I-after liberation. But first of all, I have no recollection why I kept it, how I\nkept it, where I kept it, because the first thing when the Russian soldiers saw us, th \u2014\nin what filth we were, they stripped their shirts and they gave to the women. The\nwomen, the first thing they had, they took off this full of lice clothes and threw it\naway. So, how did I keep it?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. And then we were assigned to the German families in\nOrschatz, depending how well the family was; some people had four prisoners,\nsome had six prisoners. Where I was, we were six. And the family had to feed us,\nclothe us, and \u2014 until we started functioning as human beings.",
        "Q: And did \u2014 a couple of questions here, when they \u2014 do you remember how they\nbehaved towards you, were they \u2014",
        "A: The Germans?",

Search deep in your heart, would you have? And\nthen I said, and as one thing to survive, I said, you have to find the reason why \u2014\nwhy you want to survive. For me it was my father. So, she lived in Ohio, and one\nday she came to give seminar on suicide, and the next time she came to the seminar\non \u2014 on rape, or something, talked to young teenager. And I invited her for dinner,\nand she said, Edith, I am making you a gift. I said, why would she make gift?

I want to pay you whatever\nyou want. I want to design, I want to do it myself, you just teach me how. He read\nmy comb story, he said, I\u2019m not going to charge you, just come and do it. She \u2014 she\ncame and she \u2014 when she came the second time she gave me this little box. When I\nRG-50.030*0584 \"\nopened it, I was overwhelmed; there was a comb. And not like my father\u2019s, but I\nwas just very touched by it. And she told me how for seven weeks, twice a week she\nwent to this artisan and each afternoon she did it, and that\u2019s how I \u2014 okay, okay,\nyeah, it\u2019s \u2014",

So we hoping she will\nget better, and I, you know, I even borrowed money in Israel and rented a tiny\napartment and fixed it for them. But she died two years later, and the communists\nwere there, and \u2014",
        "Q: And there was a hundred and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they didn't let him out. So here we were separated again. It was horrible. It was\nhorrible for me. And then, after \u2014 some times later he remarried again, and then,\nRG-50.030*0584 m\nafter five years of another happy marriage, she became ill with breast cancer, and\nshe died.",
        "Q: Oh, he lost all three wives.",

        "Q: But you \u2014 did you see him again after?\nRG-50.030*0584 .",
        "A: Oh yes, we visited him, we met his \u2014 I never met his third wife, but \u2014 but with his\n\u2014 he \u2014 he met \u2014 when his third wife died, we just moved in our little house, and we\njust were a short time here in America, we have no money, but we insisted he\nshould come to visit. And by then, the communists let him because what could they\nlose? His pension they could keep, his house they could keep, you know, so \u2014 so\nthey let him, but they let him come only for three months. But if this \u2014 when this\nwas over, I was heartbroken, I was sick, I said, now he will again go there and be\nhome alone. So we extended it six more months, but I was not in a better shape\nwhen he had to leave. So we extended for another six months. But when he came,\nGeorge\u2019s mother was here. George is about half an hour by streetcar from where I\nused to be in the coal mining fr \u2014 community, and he 1s from Ostrava, from the city.\nHis parent was a law \u2014 his father was a lawyer in the city, and my father used to\nshop for our store in Ostrava, so they had many mutual acquaintances. They didn\u2019t\nknow each other, but mutual acquaintance. So, when his mother \u2014 his mother lived\n18 years with us, but at this time she was only visiting. So when she heard that my\nfather will be coming, she was visiting, so she stayed longer to meet my father. So\nwe had them for about three weeks, I think, we had both of them here. And \u2014 and\nthey knew how hard it is for me to let him go. So my cousin \u2014 my father was her\nfavorite uncle from eight siblings he had \u2014 so my mother-in-law and my cousin paid\na fare for him to come to Israel before he goes home to Czechoslovakia, so he\nRG-50.030*0584 \u00e9\nwould have something nice on his way. And it was \u2014 he had a wonderful month in\nIsrael, and then when he came home, three women were waiting for him. But he\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 he married somebody else, whom he met visiting a sick friend. So \u2014",
        "Q: Well, is there anything else you\u2019d want to add to what we\u2019ve talked about today?",
        "A: What I want to add, I know that most \u2014 most survivors have guilt feelings that\nthey survived and their loved ha \u2014 ones didn\u2019t. I never felt that way, I never felt that\nway. I always felt, I was a child and a young teenager. I haven\u2019t done anything\nwrong. My parents were wonderful people, it\u2019s not that I should have died, they\nshould have lived.",
        "Q: Yes. Exactly, exactly. By the age of 20 you had been through hell on earth, by\nthe time you went to Israel.",
        "A: And then, when I speak, you know, college students, high school students say,\nyou must hate the Germans. I said, how could I? How? I have seen what hate can do.\nHow could I be part of?

All I wanted was just a little corner\nwhere I know that nobody will come and drag me. You know, I have a nice\napartment, I have a wonderful family, and I have \u2014 I\u2019m free. Oh, and when I \u2014 when\nI walk, when I take a walk, it still comes back.",
        "Q: Did you have nightmares?",
        "A: I went through different stages. I had nightmares in the beginning, but it was\nmostly about bombing. I went through terrible \u2014 terrific bombing in Leipzig,\nterrible, when I was afraid to be separated from my aunt. And I saw my nightmares\nwere mostly that everybody went to a bunker, and I was left all alone. The bunker\nRG-50.030*0584 .\nclosed just before I reached, and then here I was in the world alone. But my husband\nsays that when we first got married, that I screamed at night. Then I had a period\nthat when I was in company, I \u2014 I was listening what people were saying, but I\nfound myself that I\u2019m somewhere else. So it was a short period. And then I had\nperiod, we have our best friends who moved with us, they\u2019re upstairs. We have been\nfriends since the first week we came \u2014 came to America, which is over 15 years. So\nwhen we \u2014 so when we \u2014 I had my next period was that we went to \u2014 to some\nwonderful restaurant and we are sitting with friends and I burst into tears, because\nhere was just so good. So I went through different periods, and then when we went,\nyou know, sometimes when we are sitting somewhere in a \u2014 so we like to go to\nAlexandria, and, you know, for lunch, and sometimes I na \u2014 I get tears in my eyes,\nhe says, again? So \u2014 so I went through different stages, but I never felt that I needed\ntherapies. You know, I just tried to deal with 1t myself. And I am very fortunate.

I\nwas always told that my mother was the most intelligent of the six, although each\none was very talented, each one had the special talent; music, painting, piano. Each\none was very talented. But my mother liked books, and my father was from\nMoravia and he was very proud that he was born near the place where the beloved\nPresident Masaryk was born.",

        "A: Right, always reading. And my father was more outdoorsy. Both of my parents\nwere very people oriented. Both loved people and people loved them, both of them.\nBut my mother was quieter. As I said, intelligent, thoughtful. My father was more\noutdoorsy. He loved gardening and this I inherited from him. Also, my memories are\nof my mother singing a lot, and she sang a lot of Germans songs, operettas and \u2014 and\nRG-50.030*0584 \"\nI still remember them so well. Although, she sang nicely and I cannot carry the tune.\nAnd m \u2014 as \u2014 my best friend was Icar(ph) and we read the same books and we\nplayed with our dolls, and they had the double seat swing in the garden, two seats\nfacing each other.

        "A: Let me just tell you that my fondest memories are, on Sundays my \u2014 my mother\u2019s\nsis-sister, the second oldest sister, which her mother was the closest, they had two\nRG-50.030*0584 \"\nchildren, and one was six months younger than my brother Erik. And on Sundays\nmy father used to take the older son, Walter, and Erik, and me for a walk, and we\nwalked to the ponds. And my father made whistles for us. In the meantime my\nmother cooked a very delicious lunch. And from the ponds, either we went to the \u2014\nto Orlova, to the nearest community \u2014 there was a wonderful pastry shop, so my\nfather bought pastries that we all like, especially my mother. Or we went to am \u2014 to\na nursery. When they got \u2014 it was Mr. S-Slama(ph). Slama(ph) means straw.",

Now, to go in \u2014 deeper into\nCzechoslovakia, there was no reason to go because Germans already occupied part\nof it. So, we opted to go to Poland where my grandfather had a brother, a wonderful\nman. And we \u2014 we went to a smaller community near Krakow, Poland, and there\nwe wanted to wait for the rest of the family because we \u2014 we knew that they all will\nhave to eventually come.",

So I do not know, because I was\nnot so interested in the arrangements, I was 10 years old in \u201938, Erik was only eight\nwhen my parents made some kind of arrangement to give the house and the store. I\ndon\u2019t know if they rented it, or what the arrangement was, to some acquaintances of\nthe baker\u2019s family. My \u2014 my best friend\u2019s family, with the understanding that if we\ncome back, it will revert to us. So we left practically everything.

        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: When they occupied? No, it went very, very quickly. The army occupied and \u2014\nvery quickly. And my grandfather was gravely ill in this time. So I remember that\nthey extended our stay, because Grandpa was dying, so we left after he died.",
        "A: In the beginning, in Poland \u2014 well, my \u2014 my mother\u2019s sister, I mentioned her,\nwith the two children, they arrived.

        "A: Yeah, of course, you know, it was very sad to leave everything we loved. And\nthen, in September \u00b039, Poland was occupied, and people were afraid of the \u2014 of the\nGerman army, and many people ran.

We\ncall it in Polish nowa(ph) chechken(ph), now on \u2014 on the run. In the meantime, my\nmother\u2019s other sister, the one with the two children, went back to Slovakia, because\nSlovakia was still at peace at this time, and he, her husband was Slovak, so they\nwent to Slovakia. And we went on the run with my mother\u2019s cousin also. And it was\nRG-50.030*0584 :\na terrible time, because the planes were coming, and we were so tired, carrying our\nbelongings. When the planes came we just hopped into some ditches, and I guess my\nparents had some money to buy food. But it was very hard for them to see us kids to\nwalk and walk and walk and not having a place to rest or wash up. So eventually my\nfather decided to talk to a Polish \u2014 a farmer, and ask him to sell us two horses and a\nbuggy.",
        "A: And he did, because he thought, better to get some money now, than if the\nGermans will come and cos \u2014 confiscate this, I'll get nothing. So he sold us two\nhorses. The horses became members of our family. We just \u2014 we loved the horses.",

I had the Christian friend who took me to\nchurch once with her, and I heard some people making some anti-Semitic\ncomments, and that was the first time. And then the first really shocking experience\nwas when men, age I think 16 to 65, if I recall it correctly, had to assemble on an\nassembly place somewhere. My father and my uncle were in there and we all went\nwith him, and we waited there all day. We brought him some food, and we didn\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s going to happen. In the evening they were loaded on trucks and taking\naway. We had no idea where they went. I forgot to tell also, that during the time\nwhen my father was working with the horses and moving furniture, we had the\nRG-50.030*0584\nneighbor, also in Poland, a butcher neighbor. And he suggested to my father and my\nuncle, they should go with him out of town to buy illegal meat, so he could sell it.\nAnd my father wanted so desperately for the family to have something to live on,\nthat they agreed to do it. And they went, first of all, they were supposed to wear the\nbands, which they didn\u2019t. They were not allowed to leave the community.",

So,\nthey went and when they were suppo \u2014 we knew approximately when they will be\nback, usually it was at night they were coming back. So we took turns waiting on the\nstreet to listen if they are coming, and when we heard the horses from far, it was\nsuch a relief. And they went \u2014 when they came home, they were s \u2014 frozen, literally.\nThe people and the \u2014 and the horses, everything was frozen, everything.\nRG-50.030*0584",

When my father was taken to this \u2014 on\ntrucks, and when he came back, he said that they are working on the railroad tracks\nin Prokocim, where we used to live. So, they must have gotten permission to come\non train, because otherwise they wen \u2014 would not have been able to \u2014 to come. So,\none day they came home and they said that they heard that Jews from Wieliczka\nwill be deported. It sounded sad, but we still didn\u2019t know what deported means, and",

So they decided one night, the kids are going, so we walked\nthe whole night until at dawn we came to my father\u2019s \u2014 to the railroad tracks where\nFather was working, and my father hid us under a boxcar.

My aunt, of\ncourse, didn't want to leave my mother, but in the end my mother convinced her go,\nI am surely going to come the next day. The following day was too late. They\nalready \u2014 my \u2014 my father and uncle heard from some Germans who were in charge\nand liked my father and my uncle that Jews from Wieliczka are already being\nloaded on trains. My uncle somehow managed to convince the Germans to \u2014 to\ncome with him and bring some \u2014 some papers that Mother is needed to work in the\nkitchen on the railroad tracks. But they went to the trains, but they could not find\nher. Well, when we heard that Mother was taken, we were devastated, absolutely\ndevastated.

Wer \u2014 he came, and we were\nsitting on the train, Erik and I already, with this Polish guy, when I decided I\u2019m not\ngoing anywhere with my parent \u2014 without my parents. So I ran out of the train, of\ncourse, Erik a \u2014 behind me, and the guy behind me, and my parents were very, very\ndistraught that here \u2014 again we are here in danger, that we didn\u2019t go into hiding. So,\nthe only people that knew that we are hiding there were the Polish family, and two\npriests from a nearby church. And once in awhile they used to bring something and\nhide in the shrubs, soups, coffee, you know, in the shrubs. So, my par \u2014 my father or\nuncle took it out from under the shrubs at night. At night people were not working in\nthis building, you know. But \u2014\nRG-50.030*0584 ut",

We had\nsome bottles to urinate in, in one of the crates, and every time we heard \u2014 and it was\nquite often \u2014 Polish or \u2014 or German voices in front, talking in front of the door, we\njumped into the big crate, and we didn\u2019t breathe.",

The priests were\nwonderful, and they offered to do Aryan paper for us. And we decided maybe that\nwould be another possibility to save ourself. So somehow my father and my uncle\nobtained some hair dyeing solution. My aunt had beautiful black hair, bu \u2014 she was a\nvery pretty woman, very pretty woman. My father and my uncle could have passed\nano \u2014 as non-Jews. My uncle had blue eyes, blondish hair. My father also didn\u2019t\nhave Jewish features, yo-you know. But Erik and I and my aunt \u2014 so we decided, at\nleast my aunt, when she dyes her hair, so it will be less risky. So they brought this\nsolution, and I was \u2014 they went to work, my father and my uncle, and I was pouring\nthis solution in her \u2014 into her hair, and rubbing it in, and rubbing it in, and she \u2014 it\ndidn\u2019t do anything. She said put more, put more, put more. So I was pouring more\nand rubbing in, and suddenly her hair was coming out in chunks.

So, by the evening when they came back, her hair was\ngone, her beautiful hair was gone, and this was the end of Aryan paper. While we\nwere there, we heard about a labor camp, Jewish labor camp, in walking distance\nactually, in Prokocim. So, I think the grow \u2014 grownups might have thought, well,\nit\u2019s probably safer to survive in a ca \u2014 labor camp. Labor, it means working, so we\nwill work, and the war will be probably \u2014 few months the war \u2014 war will be over.\nIt\u2019s surely safer than in the cellar, e-every moment was really fear, fear, fear.

And on this evening my father didn\u2019t come. So I didn\u2019t\nknow what happened to him. I took my bowl of soup and I went to his barrack. He\nwas in bed, and he said that he was too tired to come. I knew that it is impossible\nbecause we were so hungry, would have crawled, you know, to \u2014 to get this piece of\nbread. Only later I found out that he went by the camp\u2019s kitchen, and he found a\ncarrot in a trashcan, which he took for me, and they caught him and they beat him so\nterribly that he couldn\u2019t move.

        "A: December 22\". And when we stood the line \u2014 in line for food, my father gave me\na birthday gift. I couldn\u2019t believe this. It was a comb this big, it was made of steel,\nRG-50.030*0584 a\nhe made it in the workshop. Teeth not completely even, and I thought it was the\nmost beautiful gift. I carried it with me, I slept on it, I \u2014 I didn't leave it off my side.\nI couldn\u2019t believe how he risk his life to make it. If he would have been caught for\nthis lousy, rotten carrot, then he \u2014 he was beaten like this, they would catch him. So\nI was really \u2014 I loved this comb. Then, when I finished my night shift, some of \u2014 a\nlittle bit earlier, before the men went to work the day shift, so I sneaked into my\nfather\u2019s barrack. I knew what I'll find. All the men were sleeping and my father\u2019s\nsitting next to a freestanding stove, sitting. I walked in, not talking, sat next to my\nfather ... we just held each other. And that way we shared our \u2014 our love.",
        "A: Our \u2014 our fear and our \u2014 our hopes. One day in December \u2014 okay \u2014 then one day\nI was working and it was almost the end of the \u2014 oh, I \u2014 I have to mention \u2014 mention\nthat once a month we were taken on trucks to Camp A, which was the main camp.\nAnd I found out that my aunt and uncle are on Camp A, and that my aunt, my\nbeautiful aunt was selected to be the housekeeper of Cuneman(ph).",
        "A: He was a hunchback.",
        "A: Always walking with a dog or two, always. And my aunt was his housekeeper.\nSo, when we came to \u2014 they took us to delouse, because there was a terrible\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201d\nepidemic of typhoid in the camp, and then it was already under control, but every so\noften, they took us to delouse us, our clothes, our hair, us, to Camp A. When I came\nto Camp A, a group of people were walking there, and I looked at them and I said,\nare these human beings? Are these human beings? The people were yellow green;\ntheir eyes, their teeth, their fingernails, everything was yellow green. I said, who are\nthese people? They were people from Camp C, the worst of the camp, which the\npeople were working \u2014 working with poisonous gases, and they were dying a slow\ndeath. It was \u2014 the book I have about Skarzysko-Kamienna called, \u201cDeath Comes\nin Yellow,\u201d is because of the people. When we came to werk A, often, we have to \u2014\nthey assembled us on a big assembly place, and we had to watch executions of\nprisoners by hanging or by shooting. So, when I was \u2014 when we were supposed to\ngo to werk A, my emotions were really torn, because I was so happy to be able to\nsee my beloved aunt and uncle, but I was so afraid to see an-another execution. The\nworse were also \u2014 okay \u2014 one day I was so tired working at this huge machine, and it\nwas the end of the shift, and I was \u2014 I just didn\u2019t know what to do, I just \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014\nI was almost sleeping and working. And the obermeister came to check the\nammunition, and went to \u2014 took some of mine and it went through, and he\u2019s got,\nwas ist ein das, what is this? Then he took the next one and it went through, and he\nstarted louder, was ist ein das? And then the next one, and all of it was bad, all of it\nwas bad. How could I tell him that I just could not function? I \u2014 I \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t do\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201d\nit any more, I was so tired, and so hungry, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. So after\nthe \u2014 after a few, he took the ammunition and with every one he knocked on my hair\nand screamed, was ist ein das, was ist ein das? And then he walked away to his\noffice, which was off the machine room. After a few minutes he came back and\ncalled me. As I was walking behind him, I knew. I knew what it meant. And I could\ns \u2014I could see the silence of the \u2014 I could hear the silence of my fellow prisoners\nand I could see their tears as I was ma-marching behind him. And all I remember is\nthinking, what will it do to my father when he finds out that he had lost me too? I \u2014 I\nknew what my fate will be. I came to his office, and he looked at me and looked at\nme and looked at me and paused. And then he said, take the broom, sweep my\noffice, and go back to work. I don\u2019t know if my youth moved him, if he had maybe a\ndaughter my age. But something moved him. I also am convinced that when I was\nnot taken in Plaszow, it was because I was small and I was standing behind\nsomebody and they simply did not see me. Because there\u2019s absolutely no reason\nwhy I am here and my brother and others are dead. Th \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m convince of it,\nthat they just did not see me. And it\u2019s not because of I \u2014 because I was hiding,\nbecause I wasn\u2019t. I\u2014 you know. So \u2014 so that was my other miracle,\n[indecipherable] that I went behind him and \u2014 and he decided, go back to work. But\nwhen my father found out, he was so worried that I will not survive this camp,\nbecause it was such horrible work, that when he \u2014 when we went to see Aunt\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201d\nPauline, he \u2014 and she also, was terribly worried about me. So they decided that she\nwill talk to Cuneman(ph) to move my father and me to werk A.",
        "A: After a few months, I was moved, but my father did not get permission. So here I\n\u2014I-\u2014J-\u2014J adored my father, so I was again torn. It was easier for me, but I was on\n[indecipherable] every minute worried about my father. The worst were the\nselection. They used to come on trucks, the Germans, and always when we heard\nthem coming on trucks, it was this fear. We had to line up and they \u2014 they walked\nand they said, du, du \u2014 you, you, you \u2014 and we never knew, should we look at them,\nshould we look up, sideways, back, which way? Should we stand crooked, crou \u2014\nyou know, never \u2014 how can we avoid du, because we knew what it meant. And the\nfirst people who were always taken were people with white hair. And my father,\nsince Erik was killed, my father was white. So always when I heard that they saw\nsome trucks from werk A, passing by werk A, you know, with prisoners from werk\nB, I was always, my father still alive?",

And my aunt was standing over me, and two other men whom I didn't\nknow were standing over me, and my aunt was crying. And I didn\u2019t know what is\nwrong with me. And they moved me to a little place, not to the hospital, and I didn't\nknow while I was there what \u2014 what was wrong with me, but after I recovered, I\nRG-50.030*0584 ~\nfound out that I had typhoid, and it was a time when the orders came that every new\ncase must be shot immediately because the epidemic was over, and they didn\u2019t want\na new spread of e-epidemic, so every new case had to be shot. And here they didn\u2019t\nreport, and I think that Cuneman(ph) must have known that I had typhoid, I don\u2019t\nknow, but that he [indecipherable] for my aunt\u2019s sake. I don\u2019t know if my aunt had\nto pay a price for it, I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: Yes, yes, yes. But in the conteres \u2014 in contrast to Goeth, who was very handsome\nman in \u2014 in Plaszow. He was very handsome. Have you seen the movie with his\ndaughter?",

There is a\u2014a\ndocumentary with his daughter, who found out \u2014 she did not have good relationship\nwith her mother.

And she assumed that her father was on the front, that\nhe was a military \u2014",
        "A: No. She thought that he died as a soldier. So she ask her grandmother, why did\nmy mom say that I'll end like my father, that I\u2019m like \u2014 so her grandmother told her\nwhat happened, that he was executed because of the horrible things he did. So she\nstarted researching him, and found a housekeeper, a Jewish housekeeper who\nworked for her father in New Jersey.",

They searched us, they \u2014 we \u2014 they stripped us, we had to\ntake our clothes off, how can I keep it? So, we had wooden clogs. I started kicking\nthe ground under me, and scratching and here, with all the women around me, and I\n\u2014I kicked a hole deep enough, and I buried my comb, with the hope that when I ever\nget out, I'll find it. As long as I was in Buchenwald, I was kicking and kicking and\nwalking all around the camp, because I had no idea where I buried it. When we\narrived I didn\u2019t know the physical layout of the camp, so I was never able to find it,\nRG-50.030*0584 *\u00b0\nnever. And when I tell this story to my little students, the especially little, will you\ngo back, will you look for it, will you \u2014 I said, I was there and I didn\u2019t find it. So \u2014",

        "A: So-",
        "A: Buchenwald was \u2014 work in Buchenwald was easier than in Skarzysko-\nKamienna. I was again in ammunition fa-factory. I was working on bombs. And \u2014\nbut it was sitting, there were 10 of us in a row, including my aunt. I had two sisters\non each side. They were older, I was the youngest, and we were cleaning with big,\nmetal rods, we were cleaning scratches inside of the bombs. I learned the most\nbeautiful poetry during this time, Polish poetry. The two sisters started one day to \u2014\njust bring something from the outside world. And I was so hungry to learn, I said,\nteach me. And so they started \u2014 I started memorizing 1n the words which we\ncouldn\u2019t pronoun \u2014 which I could not remember. Somebody smuggled a piece of\nchalk, so I wrote it on the bomb. And it \u2014 I \u2014 I just \u2014 several poems, but one was a\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201d\nvery, very long poem about the father in Lebanon, who has, I think seven children,\nand each one died of a epidemic, and he describes the death of each of his children\nand his wife. And at the end it says, where the cemetery is, there is my way\n[indecipherable], and it\u2019s a very beautiful poem. And after the war, everybody,\nfrom my friends who went to Poland, I said, please try to find the poem for me.\nAfter years, a colleague of mine in school said, Edith, I think I found the poem for\nyou. My aunt, here in Washington has the book of poetry, and the poem is in it. She\nbrought me \u2014 it was like finding a beloved friend, but I couldn\u2019t believe, 14 pages,\nthat I learned 14 pages like this, and this was not the only poem. I have it, I printed it\nseveral times and it got \u2014 and I thought no, I \u2014 impossible that I learned all of it, but\nwhen I went through all of it, the poem, I remembered that I knew every single line.\nI don\u2019t know the poem now in its \u2014 but I still remember the first. But I \u2014 it was really\n\u2014 it meant so much for me to \u2014 in this camp, also one time somebody smuggled\npieces of cloth, different pieces of cloth and needle and thread. And one of the\nwomen was a seamstress, so she made beautiful collars for us on our prisoner\u2019s\ndress. I have my prisoner\u2019s dress.",
        "A: It will go to the museum, but only after I [indecipherable] I'll show it to you.\nRG-50.030*0584",
        "A: Okay. So, on our prisoner dresses, we had this \u2014 we knew we cannot walk out of\nthe room, but for just few seconds, we felt we had the most beautiful party dresses,\nyou know? In Buchenwald, I had a very good overseer. He must have been in \u2014\nworking in \u2014 in this ammunition company before the war. Not a Nazi. I knew that he\nfelt very sorry for me, he was a very kind man. Sometimes he brought a piece of\nbread, sometimes an apple, and he hid it, and he told me where to find it. As I told\nyou before, my mother used to sing German operettas and songs. One day he started\nsinging a song that my mother used to sing. And it was like somebody took a knife\nand went through my heart. I burst out in tears, and he came to me and asked me,\nwarum weinst du? Why \u2014 why are you crying? Well, I was so choked up that I\ncouldn\u2019t answer. The next day when he came, I ask him, please sing it. He said,\nplease tell me why did you cry? So I told him. And he tra \u2014 look at me, and he said,\nI'll never sing this song again. In this camp was \u2014 were some non-Jewish prisoners,\nthey were not the same prisoners as we were, but they were still prisoners. And there\nwas a Belgian young man, an electrician, who was working fixing something. And I\ncall him my friend, although we never spoke. We communicated with our eyes and\nour smiles. And he used to \u2014 to point where he put newspaper clippings, so I would\nknow that it\u2019s coming to the end. And I will read to you the end of \u2014 of the war,\nokay\u2019? Cause that\u2019s what I\u2019m usually \u2014\nRG-50.030*0584 ~",
        "A: This is my precious gift story about the comb, which was published in several pa\n\u2014 places, including this one here.",

        "A: Last weeks before liberation, Leipzig, Buchenwald. My father was also in\nBuchenwald.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know for a long time, but then one day some German \u2014 some Nazis came\nand said that we are allowed to write a short card to Buchenwald men\u2019s group. I\ndidn\u2019t know if my father is dead or not, but I wrote. And my aunt wrote to her\nhusband, and I got an answer back. We could all write just I\u2019m fine, I am happy, you\nknow, and \u2014 and \u2014 just few words. I gave the letters to the museum. So I knew then\nmy father was in Buchenwald.",
        "A: And he survived. Okay, it was at the end of March or beginning of April, 1945.\nFrom newspaper clippings smuggled into the ammunition factory by a non-Jewish\nBelgian friend, we knew that the situation did not look good for the Germans. One\nevening, as we lay stretched on our plank beds, we heard sounds of shelling, gunfire\nand explosions. We knew that these were the sounds of the American front being so\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201c\"\nnear. What sweet sounds they were. Our hopes for being soon free rose high.\nUnfortunately, our euphoria was very short-lived. Around nine or 10 o\u2019clock the\nsame evening, we were ordered to assemble outside on the assembly field. I don\u2019t\nremember if we were told for what purpose. We were given some supply of food,\nand we were marched out of the camp into the darkness of the night. About 5,000\nwomen began their new journey. A journey which became known as the death\nmarch. We marched and marched. Days replaced nights. We kept marching, given\nshort periods of rest. We mar-marched in sunshine and we marched in the rain. We\nmarched through towns, and we marched through villages. No one knew where we\nwere going. Later we found out that we were walking between the American and the\nRussian front. While we were marching, we were heavily guarded by our captors.\nThey were working in shifts. Replacements for them were coming on trucks. Food\nwas delivered to them, while our was long gone. The officers among our captors\nwere driving by in comfortable cars, enjoying the sight of marching subhuman\ncreatures. Their spotless starch uniforms were highly polish \u2014 and highly pol-\npolished boots, must have been quite a contrast with the wrecks and filths we were\nin. I remember when others were given to rest, we turned the seams of our prisoners\nstriped clothes from inside out, and squashed as many lice as we could between our\nfingernails. The itching was unbearable. By now some of the events are blurred.\nOthers are more deeply engraved in my memory. I still can see half faces of the\nRG-50.030*0584 \"\nGerman civilian population, the other half hidden behind the curtain, watching as we\nmarched. What were they thinking? What did they feel? Once, taking a rest near\nwoods, we heard shots. We found out later that someone was shot trying to escape.\nHow could anyone hope to escape? Besides being so heavily guarded, we had only\nour prisoner\u2019s clothes on. How far could we go without being caught? So we kept\nmarching. We ate grass, and even this was forbidden, if a cruel guard chose to do so.\nDays and nights went by. More and more people were unable to keep walking, and\neach of us was too weak to be able to help someone else. We could hardly lift our\nown feet. How dreadful and painful it was to have to leave someone dear behind to\ndie. We came up on a desolate concentration camp. There was no movement\nanywhere. It was so eerie. Where were the people? Were they also marching, or\nwere they shipped into crematoria? When we still had strength to talk, we kept\nevaluating our situation. One terrifying thought went through our minds. We were\nfearful, and then when the Germans will realize that they have lost, they will shoot\nus anyway. We imagined that they will need our uniforms to make an easier escape.\nThere was so little hope for our survival, one way or the other. How they do it, keep\nmarching. My most vivid memories are of a situation which occurred on a farmland.\nNaturally, we were very hungry, and exhausted when others came to rest. Some\nprisoner noticed in the distance of the field, a wagon loaded with potatoes, which\nseveral farmers were about to plant. As soon as some of the women prisoner noticed\nRG-50.030*0584 \u00b0*\nit, they began running to grab some potatoes. My Aunt Polly started to run. I\ngrabbed her with the little strength I had left, and pleaded with her not to go. Just\nthen rifle fire started blasting and that women were falling everywhere. A young\nwoman, she could have been between 18 - 20 years old, was shot in the leg. She\ntried to get up, but couldn\u2019t. She was not too far from us. What pain and terror were\nreflected in her eyes. She screamed and pleaded for help. The Germans took their\ntime to kill her. We kept walking, leaving more and more people behind, often\nstepping over them. As we grew weaker and could hardly walk with our eyes open,\nletting ourselves to be pushed by the mass of people, my \u2014 my aunt and our small\ngroup of friends around us tried to reassure ourself that one or the other are still with\nus. From time to time we called each other\u2019s names in weak voices, and our\nresponses brought some relief to the others. The rest periods were welcome, but it\nwas increasingly more difficult to get up, and to keep marching. Actually, for most\nof us, 1t was impossible to get up, but as soon as a shot was fired into the helpless\nprisoners, we collected our bit \u2014 last bits of energy and kept going. One day we\nfound ourself on another farmland. There was even food for us in kettles in a huge\nbarn. After eating and some rest, we were ordered once more to get up and to\ncontinue to march. Only this time, some of us were no longer able to do so. We\nreached our limits. We had to give up. We were told that if we will not vacate this\nbarn, it will be locked and burned with us in it. It seemed that our fate was sealed.\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201c\nSome women were still able to get up and go. We found out later that they were\nshot, and that that Nazis did use their uniforms. As for us in the barn, freedom came\nin the last moment, and a Russian soldier on a motorcycle, leading the way to more\nRussian soldiers on trucks appeared and prevented the burning of the barn, with our\nliving corpses in it. I have no recollection of what I felt at the time of our liberation.\nI \u2014I don\u2019t remember if I fully comprehended that it was all over, and we were\nfinally and truly free.",
        "A: They kept us moving all the time, we must have slept, you know, whenever they\ntold us to rest, but \u2014 but it was more and more difficult to kept marching. We just\nhad less and less energy. We didn't eat for days.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",

        "A: Actually, Orschatz is not terribly far from Buchenwald, you know, we were\nwalking back and forth, they were marching us \u2014 the Russians came closer, so they\nmarched us toward the American front. The American toward the Russians, so we\nwere \u2014",
        "A: It \u20141t was \u2014",
        "A: Well, when we were liberated, this is a mystery that I have not solved \u2014",

In summer it was hot, in wonter \u2014 winter it\nwas extremely cold in the severe winters of Poland or Germany. Can you imagine\nwhen we had to wash it in the washroom, with a little bit soap, whatever, and we had\nto squeeze the water out, and had no energy, we were we \u2014 weak and hungry, so we\ncouldn\u2019t squeeze it completely, no place to dry. We put it on our plank beds in the\nevening, and in the morning when we were called to roll call, we had to wear it wet\nas it was, and stand in the most severe winters of \u2014 in Poland, or Germany. In a few\nsecond being outside, it turn into a sheet of ice. How did we just, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 die from \u2014 from this?",
        "A: Just from this.\nRG-50.030*0584 \"\u00b0",
        "A: Right. It\u2019s quite early.",
        "A: I\u2014I-after liberation. But first of all, I have no recollection why I kept it, how I\nkept it, where I kept it, because the first thing when the Russian soldiers saw us, th \u2014\nin what filth we were, they stripped their shirts and they gave to the women. The\nwomen, the first thing they had, they took off this full of lice clothes and threw it\naway. So, how did I keep it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. And then we were assigned to the German families in\nOrschatz, depending how well the family was; some people had four prisoners,\nsome had six prisoners. Where I was, we were six. And the family had to feed us,\nclothe us, and \u2014 until we started functioning as human beings.",
        "A: The Germans?",
        "A: The families? They were so protective of \u2014 even the \u2014 the men, I don\u2019t know\nwhat they were doing during the war, but they protected na \u2014 us against the Russian\nRG-50.030*0584 \"\"\nsoldiers, because the Russian soldiers were drinking a lot, and ready to rape if they \u2014\neven a Skeleton, they were ready to rape. So the Germans protected us and hid us\nwhen they saw the Russians coming, they hid us somewhere. It was such a strange\ntime [indecipherable] so \u2014",
        "A: And my father was bo \u2014 liberated from Buchenwald, and of course, the first\nthought was to find us, my uncle and \u2014 they were liberated together. So they went\nfrom village to vel \u2014 village, trying to find out where the people went from this\ncamp, where we went. Until somebody told them that they spotted some people\nfrom our transport in Orschatz. So they \u2014",
        "A: They found us when we were with the German family. And that\u2019s how my father\n\u2014 yeah. But I \u2014 I have just no recollection of this. N-None, zero.",
        "A: You know what the strangest thing is? I remember going home with my father to\nour hometown.",
        "A: Yeah, right. But I don\u2019t remember the first \u2014 the initial meeting him after the war,\nand I think that 1t was because I was so afraid to think that 1t might not be true. So \u2014\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201c\u00b0",
        "A: So then, when we went home, we had no home. So we went to Icar(ph), my\nfriend\u2019s family, to the bakers, and they were in such a shock to find out what we \u2014 of\ncourse they didn\u2019t know, right \u2014 where we went, but that Mother didn\u2019t survive,\nErik didn\u2019t survive. They were \u2014 they were devastated by it, you know? And so I\nstayed with them for some time, and the people who took over our home and store\nsaid, we will vacate as soon as we can, which was really incredible, because when\nJewish people came back to Poland, they were killed by some Poles. You know,\nthey didn\u2019t want to give back.",
        "A: So, not only this, but when people in the community ca \u2014 heard that we came\nback and what happened to us, they came to my father, they said, Mr. Pick, you\nhelped us when we needed it, because when we had the store they \u2014 sometimes they\ndidn\u2019t have the money to pay and my parents put it on the book, never asked them,\nbecause they knew when the \u2014 if the people will have money, they will pay, they\ndon\u2019t have to remind them, you know? So, the people came back, she said, you gave\nus when we needed it, let us pay you back, and open this store.",
        "A: My aunt and uncle went to live in the city where my uncle came from.\nRG-50.030*0584 -\"",
        "A: But we \u2014 we had our store, we had our home back. My father said, all I want is\nthe housekeeper\u2019s room in the attic, but they said, this belongs to you, and we will\nvacate, and \u2014 and the people in the community were unbelievable. There\u2019s a plaque\non the community building naming people, and many of my family member \u2014 honor\nto their memory.",
        "A: I stayed, I went to school, I studied like crazy, because \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I wanted to go to school with my peers. But my peers went to schools for six\nyears, and I didn\u2019t. I had a little bit Polish education, you know. So fo \u2014 so I\u2014 I had\nthe \u2014 I cried awa \u2014 to the Ministry of \u2014 of Education, let me go, Ill catch up, and my\nfirst report card was four Ds, and I was crushed. But my professor [indecipherable]\nyou are sitting in this class with your peers. Give yourself credit. Next report card\nwas Cs and then I had Bs and by then end I had some As, okay. But it was tough.",
        "A: But I-I was the only Jew in the Jewish \u2014 in the \u2014 in the Czech youth movement. I\nwas the only Jew in school after the war, in business school. I was the only school \u2014\nJew in my sport organization. Yet I \u2014 I cannot tell you how the people were. Really,\nI cannot tell you. But my father remarried. And \u2014 and in spite of all, you know, that\nwe got back and that we were so welcomed and so accepted. Like, my father was \u2014\nRG-50.030*0584 \u201d\nand I were invited to every \u2014 in \u2014 in January, February, every organization has a\nball, a party. This ball, the firefighters, the policeman [indecipherable] we were\ninvited to every single one, my father and I. In spite of this, it was like being there\non a graveyard. Being there, especially, especially on the bridge \u2014 we went back \u2014\nyou know, my \u2014 my fondest memories were of the meadow, all the family and my\ngrandpa. No one was there. So, I volunteered \u2014",
        "A: I went to Israel.",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes, my \u2014 I always thought that she died, and that she perished in \u2014 in\nTreblinka, but she \u2014 from the Yad Vashem I got that she perished most likely in\nBelzec, one of the very first extermination camps.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: I went to \u2014 in 48, just after the creation. I was in the Israeli Army.\nRG-50.030*0584 m",
        "A: Under communists.",
        "A: I did. I we \u2014 I\u2014 I lived \u2014 I lived our \u2014 certainly our Jewish history \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, from the Holocaust to the \u2014 almost the creation of Israel. And \u2014 and\nwhen I was teaching, I was teaching here in the Jewish day school, and we went on a\nseminar and then we had to write our diaries. And I couldn't read, you know, and\nthey were all strangers, I couldn\u2019t tell them about \u2014 but one time we had to write our\nstepping stone of our lives. And when I was \u2014 I said that\u2019s that I can do. So, I\u2014 I was\ntelling them I was born in Czechoslovakia, I stayed there until the age of 10, and\nthen I \u2014 and we went to Poland, and then to the ghetto, and then to my first labor\ncamp, then concentration camp, and this much, and Israel. And there was such\nsilence, because nobody had this kind of \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 life as I. And after this, a young woman comes to me and said, Edie, how does\none want to survive, if there is no hope, if everything is so hopeless? So I said,\nSally, you want to talk? She said yes. So I said, let\u2019s go. We sat at a lake, and I said,\nyou talk, you talk. So she was telling me that she had \u2014 she m \u2014 she must have been\nRG-50.030*0584 \"\n35 years at this time. She s \u2014 she had a bad relationship with her parents. She said\nshe \u2014 she joined some Moonies and Roonies, you know. She married somebody, had\na horrible marriage. She was raped, she tried to commit suicide. And here I was,\nlooking, and I said, this is a nice American girl, you know, what happened to her?\nSo, after she finished telling me, I said, look Sally, I'll talk to you as a mother of\ndaughters close to your age, and also as your peer. I said, would you have listened to\nyour parents if they would have told you, don\u2019t marry this guy, don\u2019t join this\ngroup? Would you have, honestly? Search deep in your heart, would you have? And\nthen I said, and as one thing to survive, I said, you have to find the reason why \u2014\nwhy you want to survive. For me it was my father. So, she lived in Ohio, and one\nday she came to give seminar on suicide, and the next time she came to the seminar\non \u2014 on rape, or something, talked to young teenager. And I invited her for dinner,\nand she said, Edith, I am making you a gift. I said, why would she make gift? Oh, I\n\u2014my comb story was published and, you know, and my poems, my\n[indecipherable] of poems that I wrote were published. So, I sent her, and she sent\nme booklet that she had on rape, and on the \u2014 she took my comb story and took it to\nan artisan in Ohio and said, I want you to read this story. I want to pay you whatever\nyou want. I want to design, I want to do it myself, you just teach me how. He read\nmy comb story, he said, I\u2019m not going to charge you, just come and do it. She \u2014 she\ncame and she \u2014 when she came the second time she gave me this little box. When I\nRG-50.030*0584 \"\nopened it, I was overwhelmed; there was a comb. And not like my father\u2019s, but I\nwas just very touched by it. And she told me how for seven weeks, twice a week she\nwent to this artisan and each afternoon she did it, and that\u2019s how I \u2014 okay, okay,\nyeah, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I took it out, because I was talking to some people, so I was showing it to them.\nSo she \u2014 she made it for me, and I framed it and it\u2019s on my wall. In the meantime,\nshe died in a car accident, so it\u2019s really very special.",
        "A: No, unfortu \u2014 you know, I never thought that Ill separate from him ever again,\nbut I went as a military and he couldn't come with me. And he \u2014 his second wife\nbecame ill with cancer, breast cancer, during the time I left. So we hoping she will\nget better, and I, you know, I even borrowed money in Israel and rented a tiny\napartment and fixed it for them. But she died two years later, and the communists\nwere there, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they didn't let him out. So here we were separated again. It was horrible. It was\nhorrible for me. And then, after \u2014 some times later he remarried again, and then,\nRG-50.030*0584 m\nafter five years of another happy marriage, she became ill with breast cancer, and\nshe died.",
        "A: That was it. When my father went, and he would never know, he looked like \u2014\neverybody said he looks like a diploma, that his life was always good \u2014 what he\nwent through.",
        "A: He died at the age of 82.",
        "A: He died 26 years ago, something like that.",
        "A: He -",
        "A: He \u2014 he was 80 \u2014",
        "A: Oh, oh, yeah, a little bit [indecipherable]",
        "A: I think a little bit earlier [inaudible] yeah, yeah.\nRG-50.030*0584 .",
        "A: Oh yes, we visited him, we met his \u2014 I never met his third wife, but \u2014 but with his\n\u2014 he \u2014 he met \u2014 when his third wife died, we just moved in our little house, and we\njust were a short time here in America, we have no money, but we insisted he\nshould come to visit. And by then, the communists let him because what could they\nlose? His pension they could keep, his house they could keep, you know, so \u2014 so\nthey let him, but they let him come only for three months. But if this \u2014 when this\nwas over, I was heartbroken, I was sick, I said, now he will again go there and be\nhome alone. So we extended it six more months, but I was not in a better shape\nwhen he had to leave. So we extended for another six months. But when he came,\nGeorge\u2019s mother was here. George is about half an hour by streetcar from where I\nused to be in the coal mining fr \u2014 community, and he 1s from Ostrava, from the city.\nHis parent was a law \u2014 his father was a lawyer in the city, and my father used to\nshop for our store in Ostrava, so they had many mutual acquaintances. They didn\u2019t\nknow each other, but mutual acquaintance. So, when his mother \u2014 his mother lived\n18 years with us, but at this time she was only visiting. So when she heard that my\nfather will be coming, she was visiting, so she stayed longer to meet my father. So\nwe had them for about three weeks, I think, we had both of them here. And \u2014 and\nthey knew how hard it is for me to let him go. So my cousin \u2014 my father was her\nfavorite uncle from eight siblings he had \u2014 so my mother-in-law and my cousin paid\na fare for him to come to Israel before he goes home to Czechoslovakia, so he\nRG-50.030*0584 \u00e9\nwould have something nice on his way. And it was \u2014 he had a wonderful month in\nIsrael, and then when he came home, three women were waiting for him. But he\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 he married somebody else, whom he met visiting a sick friend. So \u2014",
        "A: What I want to add, I know that most \u2014 most survivors have guilt feelings that\nthey survived and their loved ha \u2014 ones didn\u2019t. I never felt that way, I never felt that\nway. I always felt, I was a child and a young teenager. I haven\u2019t done anything\nwrong. My parents were wonderful people, it\u2019s not that I should have died, they\nshould have lived.",
        "A: And then, when I speak, you know, college students, high school students say,\nyou must hate the Germans. I said, how could I? How? I have seen what hate can do.\nHow could I be part of? And forgive, I can forgive for myself, and I have done it. I\ncannot forgive for \u2014 for the rest.",

        "A: My mother ... and my father.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, it happened so long ago. When I come here, and I entertain a\nlot, I have lots of friends, when I go to the Giant and I buy, or anywhere and\n[indecipherable] always the groceries, I think God, all I wanted was\n[indecipherable] of potatoes, or a loaf of bread. All I wanted was just a little corner\nwhere I know that nobody will come and drag me. You know, I have a nice\napartment, I have a wonderful family, and I have \u2014 I\u2019m free. Oh, and when I \u2014 when\nI walk, when I take a walk, it still comes back.",
        "A: I went through different stages. I had nightmares in the beginning, but it was\nmostly about bombing. I went through terrible \u2014 terrific bombing in Leipzig,\nterrible, when I was afraid to be separated from my aunt. And I saw my nightmares\nwere mostly that everybody went to a bunker, and I was left all alone. The bunker\nRG-50.030*0584 .\nclosed just before I reached, and then here I was in the world alone. But my husband\nsays that when we first got married, that I screamed at night. Then I had a period\nthat when I was in company, I \u2014 I was listening what people were saying, but I\nfound myself that I\u2019m somewhere else. So it was a short period. And then I had\nperiod, we have our best friends who moved with us, they\u2019re upstairs. We have been\nfriends since the first week we came \u2014 came to America, which is over 15 years. So\nwhen we \u2014 so when we \u2014 I had my next period was that we went to \u2014 to some\nwonderful restaurant and we are sitting with friends and I burst into tears, because\nhere was just so good. So I went through different periods, and then when we went,\nyou know, sometimes when we are sitting somewhere in a \u2014 so we like to go to\nAlexandria, and, you know, for lunch, and sometimes I na \u2014 I get tears in my eyes,\nhe says, again? So \u2014 so I went through different stages, but I never felt that I needed\ntherapies. You know, I just tried to deal with 1t myself. And I am very fortunate. I\nloved what I was doing a-and \u2014 and we have many hobbies, and many interests both,\nfortunately, George and I. We both started painting after we retired, and \u2014",
