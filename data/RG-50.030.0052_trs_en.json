        "A: Father Francis Anthony Cegileka.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: In Grabow, the province of Poznan, Poland. But Poland under occupation of German in\n1908, we still lived under the German power.",
        "Q: Father, if you would lean back and relax. I will move my chair forward if necessary so that\nyou can hear me, but",
        "A: We have started?",
        "Q: We have started. It's important that you be comfortable.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Uh...Tell me about your family. How many people were in your family and what...",
        "A: We were 9 children, five brothers and....uh...six brothers and three sisters. And...uh...we all\nhad been educated first of all in the German schools and then since 1918, we had the\nopportunity to be taught in the Polish schools. And in my case I had to go to the college also\nand did then I studied theology in Rome, being called according to my judgment and\nconviction to the priesthood I had to study theology, philosophy and theology. And I entered\nthe Society of the Catholic Apostolite, and after the first preparation, that is to say, grammar\nschool, college...uh...after I have finished also philosophy in Poland, I was sent to Rome.",
        "Q: Could we...could we back up a little bit? I'd like to know a little more before we go into those\nyears.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: About your childhood. When you were...uh...a young boy...uh...I'd like to know a little bit\nabout what life was like for you and your parents as a young...as a young...when you were a\nyoung boy in Poland.",
        "A: You see, when I was 6 years old, then I started the grammar school. Yet in...in 1918, we..we\nare very unhappy because of the war. And my father was convoked to the army as the\nofficer because he was ordered the school, and did then in the first year of...uh... the battle\nbetween German...German and Russian soldiers, he was taken into Russian captivity already\nin 1915 and he was there, which he knew Russian of course, so his conditions of life were\nnot so difficult there. And the...the Russians have esteemed him and used him rather for the\nmore secretarial work, not handwork. In 1918, he benefited and profited by the...uh...\ndisorder because of the Russian Revolution and the __. You see, just by his judgment he\nknew what to do and came to our family in 1918 and...uh...when Poland became\nindependent, he also had to enter the Polish army. But after some months he came back\nhome and continued his business work. He was an exporter of food to greater cities, also to\nBerlin, during the occupation of Poland by Germans. And so our conditions of life were\nrather good and we had the opportunity to be developed really in the atmosphere of a loving\nfamily. And when other members, my brothers and sisters heard about the my life's decision\nthat I will go to priesthood, then they also sympathized with me and helped me really to\nreach that priesthood by their sympathy, by their prayers and so on. And\nso...and....uh...uh...in 1920, I went to the gymnasium of Naklo in Poland and...uh...there I\nwas 2 years and then transferred to Wadowice to the high school of my society. And...uh...1t\nwas in the dioceses of Krakau. And...uh...then after I had finished the high school, I entered\nthe preparatory school for priesthood and...uh...",
        "Q: What made you decide to go on and to enter the preparatory school? Why did you become a\npriest? Want to become a priest?",
        "A: You see there was in me some conviction that this is my way of life. It was not my decision,\nstrictly speaking or theologically speaking, but some preparation from above. You see, we\ndo believe 1n...uh...in our faith that all the vocations of priesthood for religious life come\nfrom God himself. And no doubt in order that this cause may mature, you may live a very\ndignified and religious also family. My parents were very faithful members of the church.\nAll my brothers and sisters too. It was really the proper atmosphere. Also helping to deepen\nmy conviction, there is my place. And did then after I finished philosophy, I was sent to\nRome to the ____ University to study theology and...uh...to get a doctor degree in\ntheology. So...uh...27 I went to Rome and for 4 years I studied there at the Gregorian\nuniversity and at 31, I received the Priestly ordination and also my doctoral degree. And I\nwent to Poland...back to Poland just to celebrate really my priesthood ordination in\nmy...uh...parish where my family lived. And then my professor who became Rector of Polish\nCatholic Mission in France, he came also for the celebration of my priesthood in my parish\nwhere he was a vicar and then invited me to come to Paris just to help in his Secretariat. My\nsuperiors have allowed, and I spent the first year of my priesthood 1n France. Then 32 came\nback to Poland and start...and taught...uh...the proper __ in minor college and then in the\nsuperior classes. It was 4...uh...24. Yes, that's nght. 24 and 28, first in the first classes of\ncolleges and then superior classes. And in 1938...uh...the Primate of Poland, Archbishop of\nPoznan who was also Director of the...uh...Polish Catholic Mission outside Poland, he was\nasked by my former professor, Director of Polish Catholic mission, that my superiors may\nhelp...may really allow me to come again to France and work there. And...uh...1 was working\nfor some time and...uh...then in 1938, my superior, former teacher of Latin, has resigned and\nthe Primate has nominated me as superior of the Polish Catholic Mission, that is to say of the\nPastoral care of all Poles in Poland. And we had there are about 50 priests who worked for\nthe Polish people only, and as a young Priest I became a Superior of them. Traveling from\nplace after place during summer. It was some days in which I remember some Polish parish\nhas celebrated some feast and so I visited also in this way the territory of France. And then\n..then when the war came, _____ to France, 1939, we have really also suffered much. And\nthen...then suffered much because...especially because Germans...Germany has occupied\nParis. And...uh... here really is my great, I would say, for for martyrdom\nbecause in...on October 26, 1940 ...uh...Gestapo came to the Polish Catholic Mission in Paris\nand told me, \"Gentleman.\u201d He didn't call me father. \"We have in possession all of your\nsermons which you delivered to the French radio to the Polish people against our German\nsystem. You will not be free anymore. This is the day that we make really the end to your\nfreedom. You come with us and we will place you in the prison of Paris.\u201d You see 26...26th\nof October 1940, I was arrested and placed then in prison in Paris. And then there I\nwas...from October 26th to November 26th, 1940. That is to say, in the Paris,\nParisian...Parisian prison.",
        "Q: Father, don't...don't worry about dates. Truly.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell...tell me why you had been arrested. The Gestapo referred to radio programs.",
        "A: You see...",
        "Q: Tell me.",
        "A: Because...because they collected my radio sermons and believed that I am great enemy of\nNazis, and they have not tolerated...you see people also in France who would say something\nagainst them, for the Nazis, for the Gestapo. You see their system was sacred. Nobody had\nthe right to offend them. And then I always remained with the same conviction.",
        "Q: What had you been saying on the radio?",
        "A: Well, that Nazism, Hitlerism is not only an enemy of Jewish people, but they are also anti-\nChristian system. That is to say, not only a system to purify Germany from Jewish\npopulation, but also to not ______ with us. It was impossible for them, but to take really under\ntheir influence the whole Catholic church. And then...so in my radio sermons, as I told you\nenlighten by the French government, I consoled the Polish people already occupied by Nazi\nGermany that Nazism really must collapse because it is not only anti-Jewish system, but\nanti-Christian and human system. Everything what was for us dignified, you see, was just\ncondemned by Nazis, rejected by Hitlerism. And do not forget I told them that the whole\nworld is not dependant of Nazis, but God 1s taking care of us. And so do not cooperate. Do\nnot get discouraged. You will suffer no doubt, but in your suffering you will find always our\nsympathy and the sympathy of the whole Europe. And because, you see, of this tax of this\napproach to Hitlerism I was not allowed to live as a free person. So they considered me as an\nEnemy No. 1. And then from Paris after 1 month of being 1n prison, I was just\ntransferred...transferred to Berlin, and on my way to ____ 1n Berlin, I was few days in\nTrier, ____, Hanover, and came to Berlin on December the 10, 1940...1940 to Berlin,\n__. And really that___\u2014\u2014~\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014satn Berlin was a place of torture. And...uh...you see no\nfreedom. Just closed in the cell and...uh...I was really free only 2 times a month to take some\npart in the ___ of all the prisoners. Twice a month I was able to leave the cell. Otherwise,\ncell was my unique, only place to live. But in...uh...the week which we called Holy Week, I\nwas really taken into the black cell, that is to say without a light, without a light, without\nwater, without anything, and there was a left there for 6 days. That is to say, imagine only\nyou have no possibility to look through the window because everything was closed. You\ndidn't have any possibility to take water or some...take some food because they didn't bring it\nto you. After this Holy Week, I was really exhausted. But this was not sufficient for them.\nYou see, they...I suppose they tried just to kill me, and they came at the end and felt...treated\nme so cruelly that I was fully exhausted and perhaps it seemed to them that I am not living\nany more, but to be sure they took me to the hospital where conditions were certainly not\neasy but better than the prison. So after some days I have recuperated and then they have\ntaken me back to the ____\u2014_. But with more normal conditions of life. That is to say, I\nhave received the regular food as other prisoners, but only with the privilege to leave for the\nPriminate twice a month. And from ____ I was from December 10, 40. On July 29, 41, I\nleft Berlin____-\u2014\u2014\u2014S\u2014S\u2014S\u2014S\u2014s arn then transferred to the camp of Sachsenhausen close to\nBerlin. And then I came to Sachenhausen on July 29th, 41, and was there to February the\n3rd, 1942. And there I was also...uh...well, what I say, exhausted. You see because the\nconditions in the camp of concentration are not easy or were not easy. Neither here nor there.\nAnd so after 3 weeks in the hospital, I was for them fit to be transported to Dachau.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's stop a moment. If you could. I want to put this down. Can we stop and pause the\ntape a moment please. Uh...Steven, are you there? Can you...we're having sawing or\nhammering of some kind coming through. Would you please?",
        "A: Okay, Father we are back on camera. You had wanted to tell us the dates of where you were\non each place.",
        "Q: But I have already told you. Yes. And we came to Sachsenhausen and in Sachsenhausen I\nwas from July 29, 41 to February, the 3rd, 1942. And then I was transferred to Dachau to the\nprisons of Kothen, Leipzig, and Nuremberg._And on February the 13th, 1942, I came to\nDachau. And...uh...finally, we shall speak about it later, on Sunday, April 29, 1945, we were\nliberated. Yes. But in Sachsenhausen, you see, the conditions were not as cruel as in Dachau.\nAnd I spent there some time just...uh...doing things as other prisoners and particularly taking\ncare of cleaning the roads and the streets in concentration camp. Deprived of any liberty!\nAnd then...then, of course, I was not beaten there as the other prisoners. And so I still was\nable to continue my life in the concentration camps. In Dachau, it was really not easy to live\nand to survive because as the renowned French politician ___ wrote in his book, he was\nalso in Dachau, and in his book, ___ Liberate Root of Liberty, he says in that book that the\nDachau for him was an organized Hell. And you see if somebody very intelligent person\nreally writes so that not only for him, but for all the people, it was really life in Hell, without\nany hope, without peace, without liberty. You have been considered just there as a\nmechanical instrument, moved here and there. And...uh...1n my case as the Polish priest, also,\nwe had to work everyday in this so called plantation. And the...the work was really not easy\nand then every day, every day the same work. And without enough food. And then with the\nspirit of persecution you see. All those Gestapo people who really tried to direct our work,\nwe our not human and..uh.. although...although they were very...uh...I would say...\nuh...against all of us. Yet we tried to avoid their discipline you see. And we did when they\nhave...when they have...uh...come to us, we tried to do our best. When they disappeared, we\njust relaxed. And so they didn't have the true judgment of our work, but when they have seen\nthat we really were not working what they have beaten us. And you see, some Gestapo\npeople were very cruel without any sense of justice and the mocked kindness. And many\npeople beaten, and the plantation had to be transferred to the so-called hospital in Dachau.\nAnd there the Gestapo men finished them. You see, there was a hospital in Dachau. I was\nthere also for...uh...some days just to heal my wounds here on the legs. And...uh...we didn't\nhave the true conditions which a sick person should have in the hospital. You see, they\ntreated us just as some living instrument and moved us here and there, also without the\nproper food. But in those conditions, it was really very important to have a firm will and\npeace of heart. How was it possible to find peace of heart in such conditions? And I\nanswered just by your faith. You see, if you believed in God, 1n his not only justice, but also\nLaw, then you knew that you are under his protection and if he permits all that suffering to\nus, it 1s also on the basis that we, the mortal priest, are co-responsible for the salvation of the\nother people. And you cannot be safe according to our gospel, but taking also part in some\nsuffering. St. Paul in his Epistles tells us that our Lord has suffered for us and they offered to\nGod that suffering, but in order that the suffering may be a stripe to us, we had to complete\nalso that suffering by giving our part. And so if you have such faith that your suffering really\ncan bring some fruit to you, to your brethren, then you have found also energy and strength\nto survive. And...uh...we say very often that suffering can break or make you. It can break\nyou if you see nonsense in the suffering, but if you find out that there is some value also of\nsuffering and because of this in the popular language, we say that it can make you...it can\nmake you stronger. The more so stronger if you are a believer. If you think that everything 1s\nunder the divine control. And in this faith and tn this spirit you can really energize also your\nbody and bring more peace for your daily life.",
        "Q: How did that help you in Dachau? What was in...in Dachau, how did your faith help you.\nWhat...what kind of things did you do in Dachau?",
        "A: You see, it was really...very great danger to lose faith in Dachau. If your faith was not firm.\nWhy? Because the German Bishop have received from Himmler the privilege that he has\nalso given to the German priest a chapel, and they had the possibility to have their prayers,\ndevotions, masses, and so on, but under one condition: no one accept German priests were\nallowed to take part all of the devotions performed in the chapel. But here the danger for\nsome people...you see some people really intended, not only priests but lay people, intended\nto go to the chapel and pray a little. But there was a custodian, the priest, who according to\nthe order of Gestapo was not allowed to...any body to enter a chapel. And so the lay people\nsaid, \"Well, how can I believe if this minister of God 1s so cruel just not to allow me to go to\nthe chapel for a spiritual comfort? and obeys rather a Gestapo order and not God's way. We\nhave to answer, \"There are also ____ people among the priest who act not according to their\nconscious, but according to the order received from the civil authority.\u201d But in order to\nreplace for our use chapel here and there when we were not specially...specially controlled\nby Gestapo, we formed really little group of people, and consoled each other and prayed\nwith each other and so some little common utarian groups have been formed. And also it\nwas...uh..for us also a joy when some priest custodian, not allowing according to the order of\nGestapo enter the chapel to...not German priest, that he has just closed his eyes and allowed\nus to enter. And then so from time to time it was also for us a spiritual consolation to pray\nand this chapel was reserved only for German priests and...uh...well some priests were so\nfriendly to us that they also brought to us some part of the Holy whole. You know what it\nmeans? Yes. And so we were...uh...also not only consoled by strength you see, by this\nsacramental help and assistance. So you must say that the German priests tried to help us\nalso, but too many were fearful and fearful...and...for example, to such an extent, that they\nsay, \"No, I will not do it. I cannot.\u201d When I was really in Berlin in the hospital after this\ntorture of the Holy Week then some men who took care of us sick people...uh...he, knowing\nthat I am priest, said, \"Well, 1f you so wish I can prepare for you perhaps the possibility to\nsay Mass.\u201d And I said, \"I would be so grateful to you, but you must ask the priest, the\nchaplain to give you all the instruments and say...for saying Mass. I approached the prison,\nsay Father and told him, \"Father,\" I have all the opportunities for saying Mass here without\nbeing controlled by anybody in some secret place. Will you be so kind and give me\neverything that is necessary for celebrating.\u201d\u2019 And he said, \"Father, I am too afraid. Do you\nthink that I should expose myself to go to Dachau?\" \"Never mind.\u201d You see, we had also\nsuch sadness, such opportunities that on the one hand you had the possibility to be\nstrengthened spiritually. On the other hand, fearful people who could help you and that\nchaplain was really...I would say very cranky even. He feared too much the Gestapo, and\neven Dachau. If really somebody is 1n the need spiritual...spiritual need I should help him,\nalso if I will be exposed to some suffering. We all are members of one family. And members\nwhich should help one another. And so this spirit you see of common utarian sympathy\nassistance was lacking also in Dachau, but as a rule we must say that all the priests except\nthose that were in the German block for priests...uh...with some exception of course...all\nother priests tried to help each other. And...uh...so in this case, we can also understand why\nwe have survived being helped, assisted by others, although not materially but spiritually. By\nthis assistance, we really received new energy for survival. So then after many months...you\nsee, at the end of 1944, we have received the privilege to receive packages from our parents.\nAnd then really we have received many packages our families. They tried to do their best in\norder to send us packages with the necessary...uh...food in order to strengthen us. And as a\nrule, Gestapo has allowed us to accept to receive all the packages and so from October 1944\ntil the end of the concentration camp on Sunday, 29th, we really became stronger people.\nAnd we may say prepared for liberty not to go from concentration camp even to hospital or\nto some other institution. So packages sent us by our parents really were a great blessing for\nus. And one thing, we priests, Polish priests, noticed that packages sent by our Mothers came\nintact without corruption. And then from other members of families, here and there there was\nfood and damage by this or other conditions. And so one idea came to a priest and he\ncomposed a beautiful song in honor of our mothers and we sang, you see, this song, really\ngiving not only our thanks but expressing our deepest affection to our mothers to our family\nalso, but especially to our mothers. And so we, on this occasion, started also our psychology,\nand came to conclusion that really love for a mother is the deepest mother besides the love\nfor a God. And then also this renewal I would say of that...uh...uh...love for our mother, with\nthe food, really made us more normal people. And...uh.. when I was also in Dachau\nin...uh...1n the hospital for some days, one priest was dying and called, \"Mother,\" in such\ndespair. \"My dearest Mother.\u201d I approached him and told him, \"Father, be consoled. You\nwill find the blessed mother in Heaven.\u201d And he said, \"Father, do you understand the deep\nlove of a dying person fora mother?\" And I said, \"Well, I was not in this state of dying yet,\nbut I understand that Mother really counts as the great consolation in the last moment of\nlife.\u201d You see, we perhaps have not realized enough what great really strength is our love for\na mother, and the love of Mother for us. Mother lives for her children. Not always children\nlive for their mothers. But our suffering, for example, in this case in Dachau really renewed\nin us the worthiness. There is no greater love after our love for God, than the love for our\nmother which is not always developed, but different occasions can really develop to such an\nextent that it will become strength and renewed energy for us. So then came the blessed day\nof...uh...April 29.",
        "Q: Can we hold it a minute. I would like not to get to the liberation yet. I would like to go back\nfor a moment.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You have mentioned being in the hospital several times. Could you tell us about the events\nthat led up to your being in the hospital and you told me an extraordinary story before. Tell\nus about that.",
        "Q: You see, when we speak of the hospital in Dachau or in Sachsenhausen then we should not\nbelieve that the name of hospital was identical with the conditions of a civilized hospital.\nYou were there only an instrument...uh...which really received here...here and there some\ncare, but most minimal. When you came to hospital, then all the people who took care of the\nsick people believed you came here to die. And so if you didn't have the interior strength and\nthe...the hope to survive, the little food which you have received was not able to help you to\nsurvive that. And so many people really died there and how many? Well, for example, in\nDachau 868 Polish priests perished. Eight hundred sixty eight, and 3 of them...200 of them in\nthe medical experiments, by torture in the prison __. And the Polish clergy Dachau order no.\nclergy of ordination, we were 1,718 numbers....1,718. And as I already told you, 868\nwere...died, and was martyred, of course. And...uh...then we must say that the...uh...priests\nslowly...at the end of 1944 received really some better conditions of life to such an extent\nthat they have received also a permission that a French Bishop who was there also in Dachau\nhas ordained a gentleman deacon to the priesthood. You see, unheard...",
        "Q: Did you see the ordination?",
        "A: Yes, I...we did. Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Please. Put...put that down.",
        "A: And it was Karla Lisner, Deacon Karl Lisner. He was ordained by the French Bishop.",
        "Q: Tell us about that ordination as you saw it.",
        "A: Well, for us it was great day not only because we witnessed the ordination of that Karl\nLisner, but because we really....uh...have...have experienced some spiritual atmosphere. You\nsee, when you are deprived of any spiritual assistance and help and ordinary conditions of\nhuman dignified life, when you take part in such a great ceremony then you are liberated\nreally and strengthened. And perhaps in our materialistic times, we do not realize...uh...what\nkind of help and assistance we are losing, becoming indifferent to all the religious exercises\nand so on. In that...in that...uh...concentration camp when, for example, such occasions\nhappened that we had the possibility to assist during the Mass or before the Moment in the\nchapel or in this case, to be witnesses of the ordination. Oh, this was really a day of great\nspiritual elevation.",
        "Q: The Germans permitted this ordination?",
        "A: You see, it was already...already 1944, as I said. He was ordained...ordained by the bishop in\nDecember 44, and from October 1944, we had already better conditions because of food we\nhave received from our families. So this 1s the case.",
        "Q: You had started...we sort of got off the track a little bit to tell about your experience in the\nhospital. How did you come to be in the hospital in the first place?",
        "A: You see, because work in...1n the plantation, I collapsed out of exhaustion. And so I was\nunable to walk, to move. So the so-called Kapo, you see of that group of people in which I\nalso worked, ordered some people to bring some...uh...uh...car that I may be transferred to\nthe hospital. And so I suppose that the reason, the only reason was the exhaustion.\nAnd...uh...I didn't...didn't get much medical help, but I had the possibility to relax, to be free\nfrom the work. And did then also after some days, the possibility to approach the other\nprisoners also sick and console and strengthen them. And so in some case, it was not only a\nblessing for me to be there in the hospital but also for those who needed also some advice,\nsome help, some encouragement and so on because many sick people out of exhaustion, of\nbeing deprived of any assistance, help and encouragement died. Or if they didn't die, they die\nyet, then they were more murdered and burned in the crematorium.",
        "Q: You had said also you were in the hospital another time for your legs.",
        "A: Yes. That's right.",
        "Q: Could you tell us about that?",
        "A: Uh...This was just only some hour in which I was there. There had seen what happened and\ngiven me some...uh...I would say means to stop the blood and so on and to cover all the\nwounds. I was there really for some hours to get some help, some assistance, but you see if\nyou...if you did then have some inner strength and I would say...uh...desire to survive and to\novercome all sufferings...also the very little sickness would you suffer, brought you to\ncrematorium. You see when you speak of Dachau, then you just cannot think of normal\nconditions of human life. The more so of the proper conditions in the hospitals. They had to\nreopen also hospitals you see because well the human eye needed it and international opinion\nalso. So many, so many, I would say, people knew about all these things and conditions in\nthe concentration camps, then they just try also to visit or show here we also hospital we care\nof the sick people, but the visitors didn't have any possibility to talk with us, to speak to us,\nto ask how do you feel. And on the day if some visit was...uh...really programmed in the\nhospital, then they have prepared better food, for the eyes you see. But really inhuman\nconditions.",
        "Q: Tell us about that. Were you...uh...ever beaten and tortured in Dachau?",
        "A: You see, not tortured but perhaps not taken care of. This was the case. And so, for example,\nif...1f I was weak because of exhaustion, then they have not tortured me there in Dachau.\nPerhaps because I was priest. But they didn't assist me. You had to just take care of yourself.\nAnd other people if they really were sick, they became victims of torture. Many, many\npeople really just disappeared because the Gestapo inflicted such great and did suffering to\nthem that they had to finish their life. So conditions which were not human you see, and\nbecause of this you can understand why the many also writers, as [have quoted____, the\nFrench writer, why they have spoken of Dachau as of the organized Hell. And many people\nreally died and tortured in Dachau. I told you about, for example, Polish priest. We were\nthere 1,718 and 868 perished. That is to say, died. And...uh...300 of them..uh..died because\nof tortured suffered in the medical experiments. The doctors tried to see what they can\nexpect from...from...uh..., for example, if the tortured such person to such an extent or\nanother one. You see, we are experimental people. And...uh...we must say that... uh...the\nGerman priest were rather more protected than we, the priest of other nationalities and the\nmore so lay people. But some people knew how to organize also their lives and survive in\nbetter conditions. This is the case. And so then came the day of liberation.",
        "Q: At this point, we pause. We need to pause here and we will change tapes and then we will\ntalk about liberation.\nTAPE #2",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Let us go back. If you would put that down. I would like to ask you now that the tape is on.",

        "Q: The questions I asked I asked you when the tape was off.",
        "A: Yes. Yal.",
        "Q: Uh...Could you tell me first, please, how you went about...uh...saying confession in Dachau.",
        "A: You see.",
        "Q: Yes. You're on.",
        "A: We heard confession just by walking with some person who asked us for this privilege or we\nwere hidden in some corner of the concentration camp because to hear confessions...you see\nit was really for the Gestapo some cause of a torture, and we tried to help the people that\nreally in such way that these are ____ became the victims of torture. And, also, during the\nwork when we were not controlled by Gestapo, some people came to us and...uh...working a\nlittle, we have heard their confession and of course, tried to help them, strengthen them, to\ndeepen their faith, confidence. And then, you see, one thing that you can communicate with\nanother person and share, things which are great interest for you is most helpful, particularly\nin such conditions in which we lived in...11 Dachau. And...uh...because of this we must say\nand repeat again that suffering can break, but also make you. Through suffering you can\nbenefit so much that you can have an idea of it only after you finish your way of the cross.\nAnd...uh...this is really so that we may open our eyes more fully to the mysteries of our life,\nto the mysteries of our destiny, and then in our Christian life to complete what 1s wrong thing\nof the suffering of Christ for us. YOu see, Christ, according to our faith, has paid the\nmajority of the price for the ticket to Heaven, but on the condition that we also give our part\nthat the price may be made fuller. If we are not interested in it, then the precious suffering of\nChrist for us, for you, for...a person 1s lost.",
        "Q: In Dachau, how did you help comfort people? Was this legal and open in the daytime or did\nyou have to do it illegally and secretly?",
        "A: Uh...Secretly. It was not allowed legally to bring to the people some religious comfort. You\nsee, Nazi's most really diabolical system, trying to finish with faith, with religion and\nannilihate, everything what was not Hitlerism. It's a totalarian system, and then anti-Christian\namong the religious and no doubt that the Jewish people suffered really many losses but it\nwas also and so because for Hitler, Judaism was a religion and then after finishing Judaism,\nthey would like to finish Christianity. But they didn't have the possibility of it. You see there\nwas a diabolical system.",
        "Q: How did you go about trying to bring comfort? What did you do?",
        "A: Well, you see, first of all, then we have offered to them a promise to help if we can and this\nare another case because they came to also with some difficulties in their work, in their lives.",
        "Q: The other prisoners you mean?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yal.",
        "A: And so if you can help me, well how and this way or anther. And then particularly to...they\ncame to receive some spiritual help, spiritual assistance that is to say to revive their faith that\nwe live not only here on earth. This is only prelude to our eternal happiness, which we\nshould deserve also by our suffering. And...uh...for some people there was also the question,\n\"Why should a God permit such suffering?\" You see, why? He is God. And so we had to\nexplain to them that suffering, as such, 1s a part of our life. That Hitler has brought to us such\nreally tremendous suffering, it 1s really his guilt, his responsibility and for us, and the patient\nto suffer it as much as we can for our greater and ____. You see nothing happens in the\nhistory of humankind without the permission of the ____ of the divine providence. Nothing\ncan happen. And so we must say, \"But why God permits sufferings?\" Well, this is for the\ncure. We should really admit it that sometimes we come in our life to such better\ndevelopment that no other medical, physical or spiritual, can be helpful to us except suffering\nbecause in the days and or hours of sufferings we really came to the better...uh...recognitions\nof our conditions of life. And there is also an importunity for the renewal of our faith.\nAnd...uh...uh...the opportunity to strength our whole. My suffering will be rewarded there.\nHere is a temporary only pilgrimage for me. There will be eternity. And so your faith, you\nsee, was the greatest help in overcoming your suffering, despair, and to collapse. Without\nyour spirit strength, it was impossible just not to collapse. Our body has very limited energy\nand if that body is not energized by our spirit and some reasonable explanation of your\nposition or your suffering, then there is no hope of survival.",
        "Q: Did you come into contact with non-Christians while you were in Dachau?",
        "A: Uh...Very rarely, because you see that they had separated the Jews and...uh...other Muslims,\nif they were there, from us. And it was only accidentally that we met, for example, some\nJews or some Muslims. And otherwise you see Christian people were not so limited in their\nliberty to communicate as we with non-Christians.",
        "Q: Alright. You had started to tell us you...what happened as liberation approached.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What.",
        "A: You see then in April we all remained in 45...we already heard of the victory of anti-\nGerman...uh...German soldiers, in the battlefields, and it was for us also a great help and\nassistance for strengthening our bodies, our minds, and our lives. But slowly in April...in\nApril, we noticed that German soldiers really are collapsing on the front, receiving here or\nthere some information and then we have also heard that the American soldiers are\napproaching ____and so also Dachau. And...uh...some movement...uh...of the Gestapo people\nin Dachau on April 28 told us that really the American army is approaching. And you see all\nthe Gestapo people and controllers of our blocks left their place and we remained alone\nwithout indigilence. So we left our blocks, not going to work, and tried to come to the big\npublic place of our official reunions. And that's one moment this approaching one soldiers to\nthe tower and slowly, the Germans soldiers you see do not defend him to enter the\nconcentration camp knowing that they are lost already. So the first soldier, American soldier\nyou see, who came there to Dachau was a lady, and she was Miss. Margaret Higgins of\nWashington Post or New York Times, and she was such tremendously benevolent lady. We\ndidn't recognize her as a lady and so everybody has kissed her and embraced her. She also\nand finally reunion, but finally, she said, \"I am a lady in the sold...in the soldier's uniform,\"\nbut don't fear. I am here just to help you as much as I can. And so we sang hymns of her\nthanksgiving to that lady. For us at that time, the great liberator. That is to say she came to us\nreally as the representative of the American army, and after our first congratulations and\nsongs of Hallulah...uh...other American soldiers entered Dachau and what did they do?\nBrought many cars of food. And so we all have been invited to come and take as much as we\nonly wished. It was a glorious day. And you see for some people it was the dangerous day\nbecause they had eaten too much and collapsed. You just cannot change your system, you\nsee, so rapidly. But you just...uh...uh... should admit one thing. That your body is just asking\nyou to fill 1t with food and food. If you have not guided your knowledge and with your mind,\nwell you have taken too much. And then after the glorious day, we have...uh...received also\nthe permission to prepare ourselves for leaving...uh... Dachau. And what that means, you\nhave disposal to ask. And the...the French...French... uh...Consul from Paris sent really\nto...uh... Dachau some cards and in one card they have invited me also to join them, the\nParisians, and come back to Paris. And so it was a victorious day. And because of the\npackages which I have received from my family as other prisoners do, I was strong enough\njust to take again my office of Director of Polish Catholic Mission and function there and\nliberate the priest who helped...suffered for me with great, really willingness to do whatever\nhe was able to do. And so already at..uh...uh...I...1 would say...at the end of Spring we really\nhave recuperated fully and continued our work. Some people still trying to find means, for\nexample, the Poles to come back to Poland; other group to Italy and so on. I was personally\nin this good position that I was stable to reach Paris...uh...some 3 or 4 days after liberation\nand..uh...live my normal life. But having possibility I tried to use them to bring also help to\nother people in Dachau and help them or assist them in their return to their places. And so\nFriday was the end of our real remarkable which for men became only torture one after the\nother, and many really ...uh...died and didn't survive to experience the date of liberation.\nSuch 1s the case.",
        "Q: Indeed. If you're are in Paris and your story is not over.",
        "A: Not over.",
        "Q: You're in Paris and you, I gather, was not in quite Paris either. The Communists didn't like\nyou you told me.",
        "A: Yes. You see...",
        "Q: Tell me.",
        "A: I continued my work for two years. But being free and...uh..1n agreement with the French\ngovernment, I tried to purify the Polish parishes in France from any Communistic influence.\nAnd...uh...to such an extent slowly...uh...uh...the General Council of Polish Communistic\nGovernment, you see, went to...uh...uh...the First Minister of French\nGovernment...uh...saying that I am just intolerable, that I persecute the peaceful people. And\nSO Some person was sent to me just to find out what is the matter. And I told him, \"Well, you\nsee, such is the case that we were not only against the Nazis, but also against Communist.\nAnd for us Communists was also intolerable. And there are so many, so many communistic\ndelegates from Russia to Polish groups that I had to defend our Polish citizens against this\ninfiltration of communistic sick... sickness.\u201d\u2019 And then I really never allowed to infiltrate in\nour Polish organization...we never allowed the communists to really bring to them some\ndamage. And I have received the answer of the communist...the French government\ncongratulations. Yes. The former anti-really to hide the people that they may not become\nvictims of communists, but now you see the...no photographs here. The communists...the\ncommunists after they have not received any help from ...from French government and to\npacify me, they went to the upper story to delegate. And what did they do? They told him,\n\"Your Excellency. Certainly Christianity can develop only in peaceful conditions of co-\nliving and that this present ____ and you must correct him or even dismiss him.\u201d And so\nafter the...uh...uh... communistic country left, the upper story delegates, the delegate of\ndelegate, the future Pope...uh...jumped when he heard, call me and asked, \"Father, what is\nthe matter? I have received here so many accusations that you do not allow the people to live\nin peace and calm.\u201d And I said, \"Of course. We must now purify our ranks from\ncommunistic...communistic influence.\u201d \"And what about your relationship with the Polish\ngovernment?\" \"I do not acknowledge the communistic government and the Consul General\nwho...uh...calls himself Polish General Consul, is for me not any representative of Polish\ngovernment because this Polish government is fully and entirely strange to our\nPolish...uh...people. And I will never allow to...the communists to infiltrate our Polish\nranks.\u201d And he said, \"Well, you are responsible for your conditions of life, but try only not to\noffend them.\u201d And I said, \"Well, the...these communists personally will never be offended by\nme in my conversation, in my repression, and so on.\u201d And I told the ___ delegate, \"If the\ncommunistic consul general comes to our church...uh...to the Polish church, I will accept him\nreally as the faith will. I will also hear his confession. And so be sure that in the matter of\nreligion, those communists will not be persecuted. If they would like to become really\nfaithful to the church, they will have all the opportunities barred to bring the communistic\npoison to our Polish ranks will be excluded, but you see when the communistic ambassador\ndidn't succeed to pacify me, going to the French government, and then...uh...to the upper\nstory...to delegate, they went to the Provincial Superior of my Province in Warsaw. And they\nsaid, \"If you do not dismiss Father Cegielka from the office of the Superior of Polish\nCatholic Mission, we will close your houses. And the Provincial answered, \"He is not\nsubject to me in his office. He was nominated by the Cardinal ____, the Prime of the\nPoland. And so I have no power. I cannot do anything.\u201d And so the communists have\nunderstood that he cannot do anything and cannot just send me away from my office. So\nthey went to the General and said, \"If you do not dismiss this man from the office in Paris,\nthat will be end of...uh...many priests in Poland.\u201d And so the General...the General",
        "Q: The General of your order?",
        "A: Yes. The General wrote to me saying, \"Father, you see I have received such bad news that\nthey will close many things which are dear to us. Our schools, institution, and so on. And\nperhaps it would be advisable that you will ask the Primate to...uh...free you from that\noffice.\u201d And so because it was the interest of the society which I belonged, I asked Primate\njust to free me from this office and he...he recetved...has written me letter, \"Father, with great\nreally sadness, I must really give you the possibility to leave your office of the Polish...of the\nDirector of the Polish Catholic Mission, but I take this with a great sorrow because you are\nneeded so much here.\u201d So after he wrote me this letter, I really asked him to nominate his\nsuccessor. And he said the best thing would be that he who has helped the Polish mission\nduring your concentration camp, may now take that...uh...office instead of your _. You see\nthis was the case of the decision to send me to honorary camp. That is to say I was unable to\ngo back to Poland. Unable also to work in France because they would...they communists\nwould have suspicioned that I just had left...left my office, but still not being officially called\nDirector, I still infiltrate all the possibility...possibility sections and bring...bring really for\nthem great losses. So the General asked me to come to Rome for some months. I was helping\nhim a little here and there, and then from America he has received some petitions\nfrom...uh...congregations of Sisters to send some priest to America who would give them\nretreats. You know what a treat is? Yes. And so he asked me whether I would go. \"Of\ncourse, if you wish.\u201d And so I came to America. And being here, I was invited...uh...to give\nretreats in many places so I was traveling from place to place. I was even asked to come to\nSouth Africa. Twice I was there. And to Canada. And always busy, busy ___. And after\n20 years of giving retreats, you see, I had to...uh...relax because of the constant traveling and\nin 1968, I received the position of Proper Sorrow, of college person___\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_ and then in\nPhiladelphia was teaching, and teaching the students in colleges. I was also composing a\nspecial manuals, you see, to help them just not only to hear, but to read and when they read\nthe material which we have explained to them and really accept some Christian education\nand Christian philosophy in college. And...uh...during the last years of my teaching, I\nreceived some special privilege. That is to say, in 72 and something 70, I was nominated as\noutstanding educator of America, a honor for me. Yes. And...uh...then I had to stay with my\nsociety ____, and I now am the Director of Infant Jesus Shrine. That is to say some charter\nto which come pilgrimages...uh...and get also some spiritual help.

        "Q: But I have already told you. Yes. And we came to Sachsenhausen and in Sachsenhausen I\nwas from July 29, 41 to February, the 3rd, 1942. And then I was transferred to Dachau to the\nprisons of Kothen, Leipzig, and Nuremberg._And on February the 13th, 1942, I came to\nDachau. And...uh...finally, we shall speak about it later, on Sunday, April 29, 1945, we were\nliberated. Yes. But in Sachsenhausen, you see, the conditions were not as cruel as in Dachau.\nAnd I spent there some time just...uh...doing things as other prisoners and particularly taking\ncare of cleaning the roads and the streets in concentration camp. Deprived of any liberty!\nAnd then...then, of course, I was not beaten there as the other prisoners. And so I still was\nable to continue my life in the concentration camps. In Dachau, it was really not easy to live\nand to survive because as the renowned French politician ___ wrote in his book, he was\nalso in Dachau, and in his book, ___ Liberate Root of Liberty, he says in that book that the\nDachau for him was an organized Hell. And you see if somebody very intelligent person\nreally writes so that not only for him, but for all the people, it was really life in Hell, without\nany hope, without peace, without liberty. You have been considered just there as a\nmechanical instrument, moved here and there. And...uh...1n my case as the Polish priest, also,\nwe had to work everyday in this so called plantation. And the...the work was really not easy\nand then every day, every day the same work. And without enough food. And then with the\nspirit of persecution you see. All those Gestapo people who really tried to direct our work,\nwe our not human and..uh.. although...although they were very...uh...I would say...\nuh...against all of us. Yet we tried to avoid their discipline you see. And we did when they\nhave...when they have...uh...come to us, we tried to do our best. When they disappeared, we\njust relaxed. And so they didn't have the true judgment of our work, but when they have seen\nthat we really were not working what they have beaten us. And you see, some Gestapo\npeople were very cruel without any sense of justice and the mocked kindness. And many\npeople beaten, and the plantation had to be transferred to the so-called hospital in Dachau.\nAnd there the Gestapo men finished them. You see, there was a hospital in Dachau. I was\nthere also for...uh...some days just to heal my wounds here on the legs. And...uh...we didn't\nhave the true conditions which a sick person should have in the hospital. You see, they\ntreated us just as some living instrument and moved us here and there, also without the\nproper food. But in those conditions, it was really very important to have a firm will and\npeace of heart. How was it possible to find peace of heart in such conditions? And I\nanswered just by your faith. You see, if you believed in God, 1n his not only justice, but also\nLaw, then you knew that you are under his protection and if he permits all that suffering to\nus, it 1s also on the basis that we, the mortal priest, are co-responsible for the salvation of the\nother people. And you cannot be safe according to our gospel, but taking also part in some\nsuffering. St. Paul in his Epistles tells us that our Lord has suffered for us and they offered to\nGod that suffering, but in order that the suffering may be a stripe to us, we had to complete\nalso that suffering by giving our part. And so if you have such faith that your suffering really\ncan bring some fruit to you, to your brethren, then you have found also energy and strength\nto survive. And...uh...we say very often that suffering can break or make you. It can break\nyou if you see nonsense in the suffering, but if you find out that there is some value also of\nsuffering and because of this in the popular language, we say that it can make you...it can\nmake you stronger. The more so stronger if you are a believer. If you think that everything 1s\nunder the divine control. And in this faith and tn this spirit you can really energize also your\nbody and bring more peace for your daily life.",

        "Q: Can we hold it a minute. I would like not to get to the liberation yet. I would like to go back\nfor a moment.",
        "Q: You have mentioned being in the hospital several times. Could you tell us about the events\nthat led up to your being in the hospital and you told me an extraordinary story before. Tell\nus about that.",
        "Q: You see, when we speak of the hospital in Dachau or in Sachsenhausen then we should not\nbelieve that the name of hospital was identical with the conditions of a civilized hospital.\nYou were there only an instrument...uh...which really received here...here and there some\ncare, but most minimal. When you came to hospital, then all the people who took care of the\nsick people believed you came here to die. And so if you didn't have the interior strength and\nthe...the hope to survive, the little food which you have received was not able to help you to\nsurvive that. And so many people really died there and how many? Well, for example, in\nDachau 868 Polish priests perished. Eight hundred sixty eight, and 3 of them...200 of them in\nthe medical experiments, by torture in the prison __. And the Polish clergy Dachau order no.\nclergy of ordination, we were 1,718 numbers....1,718. And as I already told you, 868\nwere...died, and was martyred, of course. And...uh...then we must say that the...uh...priests\nslowly...at the end of 1944 received really some better conditions of life to such an extent\nthat they have received also a permission that a French Bishop who was there also in Dachau\nhas ordained a gentleman deacon to the priesthood.

And did then after I finished philosophy, I was sent to\nRome to the ____ University to study theology and...uh...to get a doctor degree in\ntheology. So...uh...27 I went to Rome and for 4 years I studied there at the Gregorian\nuniversity and at 31, I received the Priestly ordination and also my doctoral degree. And I\nwent to Poland...back to Poland just to celebrate really my priesthood ordination in\nmy...uh...parish where my family lived. And then my professor who became Rector of Polish\nCatholic Mission in France, he came also for the celebration of my priesthood in my parish\nwhere he was a vicar and then invited me to come to Paris just to help in his Secretariat. My\nsuperiors have allowed, and I spent the first year of my priesthood 1n France. Then 32 came\nback to Poland and start...and taught...uh...the proper __ in minor college and then in the\nsuperior classes. It was 4...uh...24. Yes, that's nght. 24 and 28, first in the first classes of\ncolleges and then superior classes. And in 1938...uh...the Primate of Poland, Archbishop of\nPoznan who was also Director of the...uh...Polish Catholic Mission outside Poland, he was\nasked by my former professor, Director of Polish Catholic mission, that my superiors may\nhelp...may really allow me to come again to France and work there. And...uh...1 was working\nfor some time and...uh...then in 1938, my superior, former teacher of Latin, has resigned and\nthe Primate has nominated me as superior of the Polish Catholic Mission, that is to say of the\nPastoral care of all Poles in Poland. And we had there are about 50 priests who worked for\nthe Polish people only, and as a young Priest I became a Superior of them. Traveling from\nplace after place during summer. It was some days in which I remember some Polish parish\nhas celebrated some feast and so I visited also in this way the territory of France. And then\n..then when the war came, _____ to France, 1939, we have really also suffered much. And\nthen...then suffered much because...especially because Germans...Germany has occupied\nParis. And...uh... here really is my great, I would say, for for martyrdom\nbecause in...on October 26, 1940 ...uh...Gestapo came to the Polish Catholic Mission in Paris\nand told me, \"Gentleman.\u201d He didn't call me father. \"We have in possession all of your\nsermons which you delivered to the French radio to the Polish people against our German\nsystem. You will not be free anymore. This is the day that we make really the end to your\nfreedom. You come with us and we will place you in the prison of Paris.\u201d You see 26...26th\nof October 1940, I was arrested and placed then in prison in Paris. And then there I\nwas...from October 26th to November 26th, 1940. That is to say, in the Paris,\nParisian...Parisian prison.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You see...",
        "A: Because...because they collected my radio sermons and believed that I am great enemy of\nNazis, and they have not tolerated...you see people also in France who would say something\nagainst them, for the Nazis, for the Gestapo. You see their system was sacred. Nobody had\nthe right to offend them. And then I always remained with the same conviction.",
        "A: Well, that Nazism, Hitlerism is not only an enemy of Jewish people, but they are also anti-\nChristian system. That is to say, not only a system to purify Germany from Jewish\npopulation, but also to not ______ with us. It was impossible for them, but to take really under\ntheir influence the whole Catholic church. And then...so in my radio sermons, as I told you\nenlighten by the French government, I consoled the Polish people already occupied by Nazi\nGermany that Nazism really must collapse because it is not only anti-Jewish system, but\nanti-Christian and human system. Everything what was for us dignified, you see, was just\ncondemned by Nazis, rejected by Hitlerism. And do not forget I told them that the whole\nworld is not dependant of Nazis, but God 1s taking care of us. And so do not cooperate. Do\nnot get discouraged. You will suffer no doubt, but in your suffering you will find always our\nsympathy and the sympathy of the whole Europe. And because, you see, of this tax of this\napproach to Hitlerism I was not allowed to live as a free person. So they considered me as an\nEnemy No. 1. And then from Paris after 1 month of being 1n prison, I was just\ntransferred...transferred to Berlin, and on my way to ____ 1n Berlin, I was few days in\nTrier, ____, Hanover, and came to Berlin on December the 10, 1940...1940 to Berlin,\n__. And really that___\u2014\u2014~\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014satn Berlin was a place of torture. And...uh...you see no\nfreedom. Just closed in the cell and...uh...I was really free only 2 times a month to take some\npart in the ___ of all the prisoners. Twice a month I was able to leave the cell. Otherwise,\ncell was my unique, only place to live. But in...uh...the week which we called Holy Week, I\nwas really taken into the black cell, that is to say without a light, without a light, without\nwater, without anything, and there was a left there for 6 days. That is to say, imagine only\nyou have no possibility to look through the window because everything was closed. You\ndidn't have any possibility to take water or some...take some food because they didn't bring it\nto you. After this Holy Week, I was really exhausted. But this was not sufficient for them.\nYou see, they...I suppose they tried just to kill me, and they came at the end and felt...treated\nme so cruelly that I was fully exhausted and perhaps it seemed to them that I am not living\nany more, but to be sure they took me to the hospital where conditions were certainly not\neasy but better than the prison. So after some days I have recuperated and then they have\ntaken me back to the ____\u2014_. But with more normal conditions of life. That is to say, I\nhave received the regular food as other prisoners, but only with the privilege to leave for the\nPriminate twice a month. And from ____ I was from December 10, 40. On July 29, 41, I\nleft Berlin____-\u2014\u2014\u2014S\u2014S\u2014S\u2014S\u2014s arn then transferred to the camp of Sachsenhausen close to\nBerlin. And then I came to Sachenhausen on July 29th, 41, and was there to February the\n3rd, 1942. And there I was also...uh...well, what I say, exhausted. You see because the\nconditions in the camp of concentration are not easy or were not easy. Neither here nor there.\nAnd so after 3 weeks in the hospital, I was for them fit to be transported to Dachau.",
        "A: Okay, Father we are back on camera. You had wanted to tell us the dates of where you were\non each place.",
        "A: You see, it was really...very great danger to lose faith in Dachau. If your faith was not firm.\nWhy? Because the German Bishop have received from Himmler the privilege that he has\nalso given to the German priest a chapel, and they had the possibility to have their prayers,\ndevotions, masses, and so on, but under one condition: no one accept German priests were\nallowed to take part all of the devotions performed in the chapel. But here the danger for\nsome people...you see some people really intended, not only priests but lay people, intended\nto go to the chapel and pray a little. But there was a custodian, the priest, who according to\nthe order of Gestapo was not allowed to...any body to enter a chapel. And so the lay people\nsaid, \"Well, how can I believe if this minister of God 1s so cruel just not to allow me to go to\nthe chapel for a spiritual comfort? and obeys rather a Gestapo order and not God's way. We\nhave to answer, \"There are also ____ people among the priest who act not according to their\nconscious, but according to the order received from the civil authority.\u201d But in order to\nreplace for our use chapel here and there when we were not specially...specially controlled\nby Gestapo, we formed really little group of people, and consoled each other and prayed\nwith each other and so some little common utarian groups have been formed. And also it\nwas...uh..for us also a joy when some priest custodian, not allowing according to the order of\nGestapo enter the chapel to...not German priest, that he has just closed his eyes and allowed\nus to enter. And then so from time to time it was also for us a spiritual consolation to pray\nand this chapel was reserved only for German priests and...uh...well some priests were so\nfriendly to us that they also brought to us some part of the Holy whole. You know what it\nmeans? Yes. And so we were...uh...also not only consoled by strength you see, by this\nsacramental help and assistance. So you must say that the German priests tried to help us\nalso, but too many were fearful and fearful...and...for example, to such an extent, that they\nsay, \"No, I will not do it. I cannot.\u201d When I was really in Berlin in the hospital after this\ntorture of the Holy Week then some men who took care of us sick people...uh...he, knowing\nthat I am priest, said, \"Well, 1f you so wish I can prepare for you perhaps the possibility to\nsay Mass.\u201d And I said, \"I would be so grateful to you, but you must ask the priest, the\nchaplain to give you all the instruments and say...for saying Mass. I approached the prison,\nsay Father and told him, \"Father,\" I have all the opportunities for saying Mass here without\nbeing controlled by anybody in some secret place. Will you be so kind and give me\neverything that is necessary for celebrating.\u201d\u2019 And he said, \"Father, I am too afraid. Do you\nthink that I should expose myself to go to Dachau?\" \"Never mind.\u201d You see, we had also\nsuch sadness, such opportunities that on the one hand you had the possibility to be\nstrengthened spiritually. On the other hand, fearful people who could help you and that\nchaplain was really...I would say very cranky even. He feared too much the Gestapo, and\neven Dachau. If really somebody is 1n the need spiritual...spiritual need I should help him,\nalso if I will be exposed to some suffering. We all are members of one family. And members\nwhich should help one another. And so this spirit you see of common utarian sympathy\nassistance was lacking also in Dachau, but as a rule we must say that all the priests except\nthose that were in the German block for priests...uh...with some exception of course...all\nother priests tried to help each other. And...uh...so in this case, we can also understand why\nwe have survived being helped, assisted by others, although not materially but spiritually. By\nthis assistance, we really received new energy for survival. So then after many months...you\nsee, at the end of 1944, we have received the privilege to receive packages from our parents.\nAnd then really we have received many packages our families. They tried to do their best in\norder to send us packages with the necessary...uh...food in order to strengthen us. And as a\nrule, Gestapo has allowed us to accept to receive all the packages and so from October 1944\ntil the end of the concentration camp on Sunday, 29th, we really became stronger people.\nAnd we may say prepared for liberty not to go from concentration camp even to hospital or\nto some other institution. So packages sent us by our parents really were a great blessing for\nus. And one thing, we priests, Polish priests, noticed that packages sent by our Mothers came\nintact without corruption. And then from other members of families, here and there there was\nfood and damage by this or other conditions. And so one idea came to a priest and he\ncomposed a beautiful song in honor of our mothers and we sang, you see, this song, really\ngiving not only our thanks but expressing our deepest affection to our mothers to our family\nalso, but especially to our mothers. And so we, on this occasion, started also our psychology,\nand came to conclusion that really love for a mother is the deepest mother besides the love\nfor a God. And then also this renewal I would say of that...uh...uh...love for our mother, with\nthe food, really made us more normal people. And...uh.. when I was also in Dachau\nin...uh...1n the hospital for some days, one priest was dying and called, \"Mother,\" in such\ndespair. \"My dearest Mother.\u201d I approached him and told him, \"Father, be consoled. You\nwill find the blessed mother in Heaven.\u201d And he said, \"Father, do you understand the deep\nlove of a dying person fora mother?\" And I said, \"Well, I was not in this state of dying yet,\nbut I understand that Mother really counts as the great consolation in the last moment of\nlife.\u201d You see, we perhaps have not realized enough what great really strength is our love for\na mother, and the love of Mother for us. Mother lives for her children. Not always children\nlive for their mothers. But our suffering, for example, in this case in Dachau really renewed\nin us the worthiness. There is no greater love after our love for God, than the love for our\nmother which is not always developed, but different occasions can really develop to such an\nextent that it will become strength and renewed energy for us. So then came the blessed day\nof...uh...April 29.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I...we did. Yes.",
        "A: And it was Karla Lisner, Deacon Karl Lisner. He was ordained by the French Bishop.",
        "A: Well, for us it was great day not only because we witnessed the ordination of that Karl\nLisner, but because we really....uh...have...have experienced some spiritual atmosphere. You\nsee, when you are deprived of any spiritual assistance and help and ordinary conditions of\nhuman dignified life, when you take part in such a great ceremony then you are liberated\nreally and strengthened. And perhaps in our materialistic times, we do not realize...uh...what\nkind of help and assistance we are losing, becoming indifferent to all the religious exercises\nand so on. In that...in that...uh...concentration camp when, for example, such occasions\nhappened that we had the possibility to assist during the Mass or before the Moment in the\nchapel or in this case, to be witnesses of the ordination. Oh, this was really a day of great\nspiritual elevation.",
        "A: You see, it was already...already 1944, as I said. He was ordained...ordained by the bishop in\nDecember 44, and from October 1944, we had already better conditions because of food we\nhave received from our families. So this 1s the case.",
        "A: You see, because work in...1n the plantation, I collapsed out of exhaustion. And so I was\nunable to walk, to move. So the so-called Kapo, you see of that group of people in which I\nalso worked, ordered some people to bring some...uh...uh...car that I may be transferred to\nthe hospital. And so I suppose that the reason, the only reason was the exhaustion.\nAnd...uh...I didn't...didn't get much medical help, but I had the possibility to relax, to be free\nfrom the work. And did then also after some days, the possibility to approach the other\nprisoners also sick and console and strengthen them. And so in some case, it was not only a\nblessing for me to be there in the hospital but also for those who needed also some advice,\nsome help, some encouragement and so on because many sick people out of exhaustion, of\nbeing deprived of any assistance, help and encouragement died. Or if they didn't die, they die\nyet, then they were more murdered and burned in the crematorium.",
        "A: Yes. That's right.",
        "A: Uh...This was just only some hour in which I was there. There had seen what happened and\ngiven me some...uh...I would say means to stop the blood and so on and to cover all the\nwounds. I was there really for some hours to get some help, some assistance, but you see if\nyou...if you did then have some inner strength and I would say...uh...desire to survive and to\novercome all sufferings...also the very little sickness would you suffer, brought you to\ncrematorium. You see when you speak of Dachau, then you just cannot think of normal\nconditions of human life. The more so of the proper conditions in the hospitals. They had to\nreopen also hospitals you see because well the human eye needed it and international opinion\nalso. So many, so many, I would say, people knew about all these things and conditions in\nthe concentration camps, then they just try also to visit or show here we also hospital we care\nof the sick people, but the visitors didn't have any possibility to talk with us, to speak to us,\nto ask how do you feel. And on the day if some visit was...uh...really programmed in the\nhospital, then they have prepared better food, for the eyes you see. But really inhuman\nconditions.",
        "A: You see, not tortured but perhaps not taken care of. This was the case. And so, for example,\nif...1f I was weak because of exhaustion, then they have not tortured me there in Dachau.\nPerhaps because I was priest. But they didn't assist me. You had to just take care of yourself.\nAnd other people if they really were sick, they became victims of torture. Many, many\npeople really just disappeared because the Gestapo inflicted such great and did suffering to\nthem that they had to finish their life. So conditions which were not human you see, and\nbecause of this you can understand why the many also writers, as [have quoted____, the\nFrench writer, why they have spoken of Dachau as of the organized Hell. And many people\nreally died and tortured in Dachau. I told you about, for example, Polish priest. We were\nthere 1,718 and 868 perished. That is to say, died. And...uh...300 of them..uh..died because\nof tortured suffered in the medical experiments. The doctors tried to see what they can\nexpect from...from...uh..., for example, if the tortured such person to such an extent or\nanother one. You see, we are experimental people. And...uh...we must say that... uh...the\nGerman priest were rather more protected than we, the priest of other nationalities and the\nmore so lay people. But some people knew how to organize also their lives and survive in\nbetter conditions. This is the case. And so then came the day of liberation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Yal.",
        "A: You see.",
        "A: We heard confession just by walking with some person who asked us for this privilege or we\nwere hidden in some corner of the concentration camp because to hear confessions...you see\nit was really for the Gestapo some cause of a torture, and we tried to help the people that\nreally in such way that these are ____ became the victims of torture. And, also, during the\nwork when we were not controlled by Gestapo, some people came to us and...uh...working a\nlittle, we have heard their confession and of course, tried to help them, strengthen them, to\ndeepen their faith, confidence. And then, you see, one thing that you can communicate with\nanother person and share, things which are great interest for you is most helpful, particularly\nin such conditions in which we lived in...11 Dachau. And...uh...because of this we must say\nand repeat again that suffering can break, but also make you. Through suffering you can\nbenefit so much that you can have an idea of it only after you finish your way of the cross.\nAnd...uh...this is really so that we may open our eyes more fully to the mysteries of our life,\nto the mysteries of our destiny, and then in our Christian life to complete what 1s wrong thing\nof the suffering of Christ for us. YOu see, Christ, according to our faith, has paid the\nmajority of the price for the ticket to Heaven, but on the condition that we also give our part\nthat the price may be made fuller. If we are not interested in it, then the precious suffering of\nChrist for us, for you, for...a person 1s lost.",
        "A: Uh...Secretly. It was not allowed legally to bring to the people some religious comfort. You\nsee, Nazi's most really diabolical system, trying to finish with faith, with religion and\nannilihate, everything what was not Hitlerism. It's a totalarian system, and then anti-Christian\namong the religious and no doubt that the Jewish people suffered really many losses but it\nwas also and so because for Hitler, Judaism was a religion and then after finishing Judaism,\nthey would like to finish Christianity. But they didn't have the possibility of it. You see there\nwas a diabolical system.",
        "A: Well, you see, first of all, then we have offered to them a promise to help if we can and this\nare another case because they came to also with some difficulties in their work, in their lives.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And so if you can help me, well how and this way or anther. And then particularly to...they\ncame to receive some spiritual help, spiritual assistance that is to say to revive their faith that\nwe live not only here on earth. This is only prelude to our eternal happiness, which we\nshould deserve also by our suffering. And...uh...for some people there was also the question,\n\"Why should a God permit such suffering?\" You see, why? He is God. And so we had to\nexplain to them that suffering, as such, 1s a part of our life. That Hitler has brought to us such\nreally tremendous suffering, it 1s really his guilt, his responsibility and for us, and the patient\nto suffer it as much as we can for our greater and ____. You see nothing happens in the\nhistory of humankind without the permission of the ____ of the divine providence. Nothing\ncan happen. And so we must say, \"But why God permits sufferings?\" Well, this is for the\ncure. We should really admit it that sometimes we come in our life to such better\ndevelopment that no other medical, physical or spiritual, can be helpful to us except suffering\nbecause in the days and or hours of sufferings we really came to the better...uh...recognitions\nof our conditions of life. And there is also an importunity for the renewal of our faith.\nAnd...uh...uh...the opportunity to strength our whole. My suffering will be rewarded there.\nHere is a temporary only pilgrimage for me. There will be eternity. And so your faith, you\nsee, was the greatest help in overcoming your suffering, despair, and to collapse. Without\nyour spirit strength, it was impossible just not to collapse. Our body has very limited energy\nand if that body is not energized by our spirit and some reasonable explanation of your\nposition or your suffering, then there is no hope of survival.",
        "A: Uh...Very rarely, because you see that they had separated the Jews and...uh...other Muslims,\nif they were there, from us. And it was only accidentally that we met, for example, some\nJews or some Muslims. And otherwise you see Christian people were not so limited in their\nliberty to communicate as we with non-Christians.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You see then in April we all remained in 45...we already heard of the victory of anti-\nGerman...uh...German soldiers, in the battlefields, and it was for us also a great help and\nassistance for strengthening our bodies, our minds, and our lives. But slowly in April...in\nApril, we noticed that German soldiers really are collapsing on the front, receiving here or\nthere some information and then we have also heard that the American soldiers are\napproaching ____and so also Dachau. And...uh...some movement...uh...of the Gestapo people\nin Dachau on April 28 told us that really the American army is approaching. And you see all\nthe Gestapo people and controllers of our blocks left their place and we remained alone\nwithout indigilence. So we left our blocks, not going to work, and tried to come to the big\npublic place of our official reunions. And that's one moment this approaching one soldiers to\nthe tower and slowly, the Germans soldiers you see do not defend him to enter the\nconcentration camp knowing that they are lost already. So the first soldier, American soldier\nyou see, who came there to Dachau was a lady, and she was Miss. Margaret Higgins of\nWashington Post or New York Times, and she was such tremendously benevolent lady. We\ndidn't recognize her as a lady and so everybody has kissed her and embraced her. She also\nand finally reunion, but finally, she said, \"I am a lady in the sold...in the soldier's uniform,\"\nbut don't fear. I am here just to help you as much as I can. And so we sang hymns of her\nthanksgiving to that lady. For us at that time, the great liberator. That is to say she came to us\nreally as the representative of the American army, and after our first congratulations and\nsongs of Hallulah...uh...other American soldiers entered Dachau and what did they do?\nBrought many cars of food. And so we all have been invited to come and take as much as we\nonly wished. It was a glorious day. And you see for some people it was the dangerous day\nbecause they had eaten too much and collapsed. You just cannot change your system, you\nsee, so rapidly. But you just...uh...uh... should admit one thing. That your body is just asking\nyou to fill 1t with food and food. If you have not guided your knowledge and with your mind,\nwell you have taken too much. And then after the glorious day, we have...uh...received also\nthe permission to prepare ourselves for leaving...uh... Dachau. And what that means, you\nhave disposal to ask. And the...the French...French... uh...Consul from Paris sent really\nto...uh... Dachau some cards and in one card they have invited me also to join them, the\nParisians, and come back to Paris. And so it was a victorious day. And because of the\npackages which I have received from my family as other prisoners do, I was strong enough\njust to take again my office of Director of Polish Catholic Mission and function there and\nliberate the priest who helped...suffered for me with great, really willingness to do whatever\nhe was able to do. And so already at..uh...uh...I...1 would say...at the end of Spring we really\nhave recuperated fully and continued our work. Some people still trying to find means, for\nexample, the Poles to come back to Poland; other group to Italy and so on. I was personally\nin this good position that I was stable to reach Paris...uh...some 3 or 4 days after liberation\nand..uh...live my normal life. But having possibility I tried to use them to bring also help to\nother people in Dachau and help them or assist them in their return to their places. And so\nFriday was the end of our real remarkable which for men became only torture one after the\nother, and many really ...uh...died and didn't survive to experience the date of liberation.\nSuch 1s the case.",
        "A: Not over.",
        "A: Yes. You see...",
        "A: I continued my work for two years. But being free and...uh..1n agreement with the French\ngovernment, I tried to purify the Polish parishes in France from any Communistic influence.\nAnd...uh...to such an extent slowly...uh...uh...the General Council of Polish Communistic\nGovernment, you see, went to...uh...uh...the First Minister of French\nGovernment...uh...saying that I am just intolerable, that I persecute the peaceful people. And\nSO Some person was sent to me just to find out what is the matter. And I told him, \"Well, you\nsee, such is the case that we were not only against the Nazis, but also against Communist.\nAnd for us Communists was also intolerable. And there are so many, so many communistic\ndelegates from Russia to Polish groups that I had to defend our Polish citizens against this\ninfiltration of communistic sick... sickness.\u201d\u2019 And then I really never allowed to infiltrate in\nour Polish organization...we never allowed the communists to really bring to them some\ndamage. And I have received the answer of the communist...the French government\ncongratulations. Yes. The former anti-really to hide the people that they may not become\nvictims of communists, but now you see the...no photographs here. The communists...the\ncommunists after they have not received any help from ...from French government and to\npacify me, they went to the upper story to delegate. And what did they do? They told him,\n\"Your Excellency. Certainly Christianity can develop only in peaceful conditions of co-\nliving and that this present ____ and you must correct him or even dismiss him.\u201d And so\nafter the...uh...uh... communistic country left, the upper story delegates, the delegate of\ndelegate, the future Pope...uh...jumped when he heard, call me and asked, \"Father, what is\nthe matter? I have received here so many accusations that you do not allow the people to live\nin peace and calm.\u201d And I said, \"Of course. We must now purify our ranks from\ncommunistic...communistic influence.\u201d \"And what about your relationship with the Polish\ngovernment?\" \"I do not acknowledge the communistic government and the Consul General\nwho...uh...calls himself Polish General Consul, is for me not any representative of Polish\ngovernment because this Polish government is fully and entirely strange to our\nPolish...uh...people. And I will never allow to...the communists to infiltrate our Polish\nranks.\u201d And he said, \"Well, you are responsible for your conditions of life, but try only not to\noffend them.\u201d And I said, \"Well, the...these communists personally will never be offended by\nme in my conversation, in my repression, and so on.\u201d And I told the ___ delegate, \"If the\ncommunistic consul general comes to our church...uh...to the Polish church, I will accept him\nreally as the faith will. I will also hear his confession. And so be sure that in the matter of\nreligion, those communists will not be persecuted. If they would like to become really\nfaithful to the church, they will have all the opportunities barred to bring the communistic\npoison to our Polish ranks will be excluded, but you see when the communistic ambassador\ndidn't succeed to pacify me, going to the French government, and then...uh...to the upper\nstory...to delegate, they went to the Provincial Superior of my Province in Warsaw. And they\nsaid, \"If you do not dismiss Father Cegielka from the office of the Superior of Polish\nCatholic Mission, we will close your houses. And the Provincial answered, \"He is not\nsubject to me in his office. He was nominated by the Cardinal ____, the Prime of the\nPoland. And so I have no power. I cannot do anything.\u201d And so the communists have\nunderstood that he cannot do anything and cannot just send me away from my office. So\nthey went to the General and said, \"If you do not dismiss this man from the office in Paris,\nthat will be end of...uh...many priests in Poland.\u201d And so the General...the General",
        "A: Yes. The General wrote to me saying, \"Father, you see I have received such bad news that\nthey will close many things which are dear to us. Our schools, institution, and so on. And\nperhaps it would be advisable that you will ask the Primate to...uh...free you from that\noffice.\u201d And so because it was the interest of the society which I belonged, I asked Primate\njust to free me from this office and he...he recetved...has written me letter, \"Father, with great\nreally sadness, I must really give you the possibility to leave your office of the Polish...of the\nDirector of the Polish Catholic Mission, but I take this with a great sorrow because you are\nneeded so much here.\u201d So after he wrote me this letter, I really asked him to nominate his\nsuccessor. And he said the best thing would be that he who has helped the Polish mission\nduring your concentration camp, may now take that...uh...office instead of your _. You see\nthis was the case of the decision to send me to honorary camp. That is to say I was unable to\ngo back to Poland. Unable also to work in France because they would...they communists\nwould have suspicioned that I just had left...left my office, but still not being officially called\nDirector, I still infiltrate all the possibility...possibility sections and bring...bring really for\nthem great losses. So the General asked me to come to Rome for some months. I was helping\nhim a little here and there, and then from America he has received some petitions\nfrom...uh...congregations of Sisters to send some priest to America who would give them\nretreats. You know what a treat is? Yes. And so he asked me whether I would go. \"Of\ncourse, if you wish.\u201d And so I came to America. And being here, I was invited...uh...to give\nretreats in many places so I was traveling from place to place. I was even asked to come to\nSouth Africa. Twice I was there. And to Canada. And always busy, busy ___. And after\n20 years of giving retreats, you see, I had to...uh...relax because of the constant traveling and\nin 1968, I received the position of Proper Sorrow, of college person___\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_ and then in\nPhiladelphia was teaching, and teaching the students in colleges. I was also composing a\nspecial manuals, you see, to help them just not only to hear, but to read and when they read\nthe material which we have explained to them and really accept some Christian education\nand Christian philosophy in college. And...uh...during the last years of my teaching, I\nreceived some special privilege. That is to say, in 72 and something 70, I was nominated as\noutstanding educator of America, a honor for me. Yes. And...uh...then I had to stay with my\nsociety ____, and I now am the Director of Infant Jesus Shrine. That is to say some charter\nto which come pilgrimages...uh...and get also some spiritual help. So this would be the end.\nThank you so very kindly.",
