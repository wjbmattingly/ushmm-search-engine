And so I remember some of these \u2014 these things, you\nknow. But I don\u2019t remember the daily \u2014 daily, you know, life or something from\nthat. I knew that I could walk by myself, and \u2014",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And because he was in \u2014 in a different unit in \u2014 over there, he had to wear this\ncape. And he\u2019s walking in his uniform, with the cape on. So, I remember that.",

        "A: Yes, of course.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: What kind of a person was he?",

        "Q: Well, some people \u2014 yeah, one can\u2019t have much. But is he someone that you\nwere in awe of, or afraid of, or was he very warm? Those sorts of thi \u2014 memories.",
        "A: No, I was never afraid of my father.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I suppose wa \u2014 once he started wearing the military uniform, you know, I\nwas quite impressed. Because Polish military uniforms were very elegant, you\nknow, with the \u2014 with the high boots \u2014",
        "Q: Boots.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, and things, and so he \u2014",
        "Q: He must have cut quite a figure.",
        "A: He quite \u2014 that\u2019s him.",
        "Q: That\u2019s him? And can you focus in on that? Let\u2019s focus in on that picture. Such a\nyoung man, truly.",
        "A: Yes. But \u2014 so he \u2014 he cut quite a figure in the \u2014 in the uniform.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Did that mean you wanted to be \u2014 to grow up and be that way too, or did that\nthought not occur to you?",
        "A: It didn\u2019t occur to me at that time, but en \u2014 and later on I n \u2014 actually never did.\nAnd my military career 1s something else, and I\u2019Il talk about it later on.",
        "Q: Okay. All right. All right, so then, let\u2019s turn to your mother. While I\u2019m at \u2014 while\nI\u2019m at it, what \u2014 what are your first memories of your mother, as a little boy before\nthe war?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really have any particular memory because she was \u2014 she\nwas with me all the time. I suppose when \u2014 when she took me to kindergarten, and\nit would just \u2014 just happen to be that in the \u2014 1n the building that we lived in, the\nkindergarten was just across the street. And so she took me there, and I remember\nher at that time. But, otherwise I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember hearing any park \u2014 particular\nthing from \u2014 from those days, that \u2014 she was there all the time. She was helping,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Again, Pll ask the same type of question. What kind of personality did she have?\nWas she outgoing, was she more reserved?",
        "A: I suppose you could say that she was both. Sometimes she could be very\noutgoing and sometimes she would withdraw into herself. But she was very active.\nBefore the war she \u2014 I don\u2019t know how it happened, but \u2014 but she became part of a\nJanuary 21, 2015\nwomen\u2019s movement of some sort. And it was also kind of a mi-military thing. And\nso these women were head \u2014 were having camps every year. And I remember that\nwe were went with my mother to those \u2014 those camps, and she was working in th \u2014\nas a quartermasters at \u2014 at the camp. And so she was quite \u2014 quite active during\nthose days, and I suppose she was very happy, because you know, she would do\nsomething, so, you know, very useful. And one of these camps was \u2014 was in the\narea where the president of Poland came to visit. And I remember seeing him at\nthat time, in nine \u2014 1937, probably.",
        "Q: So it wouldn\u2019t have been Marshall Pilsudski, he had already died.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, he was gone, right. But 1t was \u2014 no, no, it wasn\u2019t\nWojohosky(ph). No. Nn \u2014 he was never president. But anyways, so \u2014",
        "Q: But that\u2019s quite impressive.",
        "A: So I was \u2014 I was quite impr \u2014 because you know, the ceremony and everything\nelse, he \u2014 you know, and so thi \u2014 all the women from the camp were over there,\nthat\u2019s why I \u2014 I [indecipherable] that\u2019s why I came, you know, there too. So that \u2014\nthat I remember.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 I mean, you were a little boy, so you know, again, it\u2019s like you said, how\nmuch can one really say, but your \u2014 did your parents talk about the things that were\nimportant to them? And [Il say what I mean, like did you have a sense of whether\nJanuary 21, 2015\nthey were religious people, or whether they were, I would assume, quite patriotic\npeople? But what sort of stories do you remember hearing from them, and the \u2014 the\nthings that they did at home\u2019? What \u2014 what were those pillars of \u2014 of identify, I\nguess one would say.",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 I do remember s-stories that my mother would tell me about \u2014 about\nher father.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Who traveled when he was \u2014 when he was a young man, he \u2014 he was edu \u2014 being\neducated in \u2014 in Saint Petersburg in \u2014 in a medical school. And then he traveled,\nand he traveled through the areas through which we traveled later.",
        "Q: So you mean through the areas of Russia?",
        "A: Right. And the \u2014",
        "Q: And so you\u2019d hear stories about those things.",
        "A: And I remember too, this particular one, that he was \u2014 he was in \u2014 in \u20141n\nTashkent(ph), and that\u2019s where we went through also. And so it was, you know, an\nunusual story that the second and third generations went the same way. Slightly \u2014 in\nslightly different circumstances of course, because he went as a free man, and we\ndid not.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: But that I remember.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 was there a sense of patriotism at home?",
        "A: Yes. I think all the time, and \u2014 and especially with \u2014 with Father in the military\nuniform also. It was \u2014 1t was always present. I can\u2019t recall any particular talks about\nit, but \u2014 but you know, they \u2014 they lived through the period when Poland was born,\nso for them it was very important. And they were patriots, both of them.",
        "Q: What about church? Did they go to church regularly?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, we \u2014 we went to church, and I \u2014 I remember \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the\nname of the church, but I no \u2014 remember where it was. And when \u2014 when we lived\nin the military block, I know.",
        "Q: Now again, this is probably not fair \u2014 a \u2014 a fair question to somebody who was\nsix and seven years old at the time, but I\u2019m curious. In L\u00e9dz, which is a rather large\ncity, there were \u2014 there was a large Jewish population as well. And did you know of\n\u2014 did you know that there were people who were Jews? Did you have any Jews who\nwere neighbors? Did that \u2014 did the Jewish world ever, in any way, come across into\nyour world?",
        "A: Ino \u2014I don\u2019t go, I\u2014 you know, I \u2014 but \u2014 but yes, I \u2014 I knew that it\u2019s a\nmultinational, because there was not only Jews, but there were Poles, the Germans,\nJanuary 21, 2015\nthe Russians. It was very international city, because it was an industrial city and the\n\u2014 the \u2014 you know, with all kinds of \u2014 of people.",
        "Q: So it was multi-ethnic.",
        "A: But \u2014 right, but I don\u2019t remember any kind of a anti-something, an anti-\nsomebody talks, because my mother was going with \u2014 with girls that were of\nGerman origin and I\u2019m sure they went with the \u2014 with the Jewish girls, and then so\n\u2014 but I don\u2019t remember particular that \u2014 like if there was a Jew that was visiting us,\nfor example, no.",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m thinking, did you ever go to streets that were \u2014 maybe the baker, or\nthere would be a tailor, or you would see like streets that would be particularly, you\nknow, more Jewish, in the Jewish section of town, or \u2014 or neighbors who might be\naround. That \u2014 that sort of question.",
        "A: Mm, no, I \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t recall. And I\u2019m sure, because they were all over the place.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, but it \u2014 1t did \u2014 it didn\u2019t strike me in particular because \u2014 I guess because\nthere was no distinction in \u2014 1n the way that no, they\u2019re something else, you know.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nSo in \u2014 in \u2014 in my mind there was \u2014 there was no some kind of a predetermined love\nor hatred of somebody else. I think it \u2014 it was just natural to me.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you know \u2014 did you have a sense \u2014 now again, this may not be a fair\nquestion because I\u2019m asking it of somebody who was seven at the time, but did you\nhave a sense that there were others, people who were not Polish in the city, or is that\nsomething you learned or knew about later? When you say that Lodz was a multi-\nethnic place, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m sure I have seen all kinds of people in the streets.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You know. And \u2014 and because the Jews at that time were dressing in a distinct\nway, you know, so you could recognize them. And they \u2014 m-most of them wore\nbeards, you know, and things like that. And I\u2019m sure I have seen hundreds of them.\nBut I \u2014 it did not impress me in any particular way that this, oh my goodness, 1s\nsomething else. So it \u2014 and \u2014 and that\u2019s the way I am, I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very accepting\nperson. Besides, I\u2019ve seen many people of all kinds of things, so \u2014 and we'll talk\nabout it later [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yes, yes. Describe a little bit about the city itself, again, through your eyes. You\ntold us that, you know, you were in a military barracks \u2014 that that \u2014 not a barracks,\nbut an apartment \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 that your parents moved to. And was it \u2014 were you in a section of the city that\nwas in the center, or in the outskirts, and what did it look like?",
        "A: Well, I cannot tell that [indecipherable] exactly, and I did visit it later when I\nwas in Poland. But no, it wasn\u2019t a \u2014 in the middle of the city, but 1t was just a little\nbit away.",
        "Q: Outside, mm-hm.",
        "A: But we had the very good connection by \u2014 by rail, you know, in the \u2014 what do\nyou call it, the trams?",
        "Q: The trams, mm-hm.",
        "A: Right. And so, I remember having to use two or three trams to get to my \u2014 my\naunt\u2019s place. So \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Your father\u2019s sister.",
        "A: No, my mother\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Oh, your mother\u2019s sister, okay.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s sister. And I don\u2019t remember where my \u2014 my mo \u2014 father\u2019s family\nlived. You know, my grandfather. But I do remember that they \u2014 he was working in\na \u2014 ina factory, and most of the industry in Poland was \u2014 was the textile industry.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nVery highly developed textile industry. And so he was working as a maintenance\nman in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the factory.",
        "Q: That would have been your grandfather?",
        "A: My grandfather on my father\u2019s side.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So [\u2014I remember him. My grandmother died, and I do remember that she was,\nyou know, in \u2014 in Poland there are no places where you could put the people like \u2014\nlike a \u2014 funeral homes. So basically the person lied in the house for three days\nbefore the \u2014 the person was buried. And I remember seeing her in the \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: Was that a shocking thing? You know, you had seen her alive, and now she\nwasn\u2019t any more, and you were a child, or was that something strange for you?",
        "A: Well, \u2019m\u2014 I\u2019m a-\u2014I\u2019m sure it was, I\u2014I don\u2019t recollect it right now. But seeing\nyour grandmother laying there and not moving, you know, 1-it\u2019s a shock to any\nchild.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And you know \u2014 but it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s so strange that I remember that she was laid out,\nand that was natural thing, this was the thing to do.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And in fact, it was \u2014 you couldn\u2019t think of anything else, because she belonged\nhere, so therefore she goes from here, you know, to the \u2014 to the burial ground. And\ntha \u2014 that \u2014 that I recall. And I do not recall the \u2014 the funeral of my grandfather, or\nmy \u2014 my mother\u2019s mother at all, because we were not there.",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s turn now to the place that your father is sent in April 1939. What kind\nof a place was this? What was it called?",
        "A: It was a small town in the mountain area, very beautifully located, that I \u2014 that I\nremember. And I \u2014 and I remember when other \u2014 when we were \u2014 when we were\ntraveling, I remember when we went into the train to \u2014 to start the journey. And so\nhe had rented a \u2014 a \u2014 part of a villa on a hill. So in order to \u2014 to go to the town, you\nhad to go down the hill and \u2014 and th \u2014 and walk to the town, because it wasn\u2019t too\nfar away. So that \u2014 that I do remember, and it was really a \u2014 a beautiful, beautiful\narea \u2014",
        "Q: It sounds so pretty.",
        "A: \u2014 with the mountains across, you know, you could see the hills.",
        "Q: This the Carpathian?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes. And, you know, we didn\u2019t have time to travel and visit and anything else,\nbecause we only had two months there. But \u2014 but I do remember \u2014 I si \u2014I still \u2014 I\nstill can see the view, you know, of the \u2014 of the mount \u2014 of the hills, because they\nare not very \u2014 very tall. But of the hills that were \u2014 that were across the way from \u2014\nfrom our apartment.",
        "Q: Well, that was, you know, the summer of 1939. And was there any sense in your\nworld that people were getting more nervous, or was it a beautiful summer?",
        "A: As far as I was concerned, it was a beautiful summer. My \u2014 my father, you\nknow, worked and I \u2014 I do remember, I think that \u2014 that he took us on one of the \u2014\nhe had to visit the camp where he was training th-the kids, and \u2014 and we did go with\nhim to \u2014 to visit that. I don\u2019t recall the details, but then I remember that we went.\nAnd you know, it \u2014 the \u2014 the area, which of course loc-located in \u2014 in the part where\nmany people were Ukrainian, White Russians, Jews \u2014 again, you know, because\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the way it was in Poland, all \u2014 all over the place. And that I\nremember. And I \u2014 and I remember our \u2014 our apartment very well.",
        "Q: The villa.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And in the villa \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And you \u2014 you were \u2014 we were renting so-somebody was the owner of the villa,\nand downstairs was a lawyer that had an apartment and we had the one upstairs.",
        "Q: Tell me about it. What did it look like, this apartment. It sounds beautiful.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 we had \u2014 we had the \u2014 the living/dining area, and the \u2014 and the\nbedroom for my po \u2014 for my parents. And the little \u2014 little place where \u2014 where I\nlived. And then \u2014 and the kitchen. So it wasn\u2019t very bag \u2014 big, but \u2014 but it had \u2014 had\nthe balcony, so you could go on the balcony. And we brought all the furniture of\ncourse, from \u2014 from which when we moved. So it was very nicely furnished, and\nmy mother was quite happy. I don\u2019t remember how we were going to the \u2014 to \u2014 for\nthe supplies for example, was the nearest \u2014 nearest shop or something \u2014",
        "Q: Grocery store.",
        "A: \u2014 grocery store, but \u2014 but apparently everything was fine, and \u2014",
        "Q: Was it a \u2014 were \u2014 was it a residential area where there were other villas right\nnext to it?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, it was \u2014 as I said, it was located on the hill, overlooking the town, and \u2014 and\nvery, very, very nice.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Would you think that \u2014 would you be able to say whether it was a well-to-do\narea of this town?",
        "A: That I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think so, because my father was just living off of the\nmilitary pay, and it wasn\u2019t that much. But \u2014 but apparently the apartment was\naffordable, and you know, th-the owner had built the \u2014 the villa several years ago,\nand my father apparently found a space, and that\u2019s where we moved in.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And the name of the town again was?",
        "A: Dolina(ph).",
        "Q: Dolina(ph), mm-hm. So, any other sort of memories from the summer of \u00b039,\nafter you moved there?",
        "A: No, not until \u2014 not until my father was ordered to go back to his unit.",
        "Q: So tell us about that. Did you \u2014 oh, excuse me \u2014 September 1\u201c, 1939, did your\nparents have a radio at home?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So how did you learn that there was going to be a war, or that there was a war?",
        "A: My father must have learned through this \u2014 through the office.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because I don\u2019t remember exactly when, but several days later, he was ordered\nto go back. And I remember taking \u2014 you know, taking him to the train, oh \u2014 and\nJanuary 21, 2015\nhim standing \u2014 him dressed up in unit \u2014 mili \u2014 uniform, and saying goodbye to us,\nand I remember his picture, it was the last, you know, picture of him being in a\nuniform.",
        "Q: You mean, your \u2014 the picture in your mind.",
        "A: In my mind, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. I forgot to ask this before, but as far as you could tell, were your parents\nclose to each other? I know, it \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s a difficult question to ask, because you know, what \u2014 what does a seven year\nold know about \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 what their parent \u2014 but they \u2014 I don\u2019t remember ever of them arguing or \u2014 or\nyelling at each other or anything like that, no.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Okay.",
        "A: It was \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: A peaceful home.",
        "A: A peaceful foam, yes, that\u2019s very good.",
        "Q: So, when you said he was ordered back, where was he ordered back to? Was it\nLodz?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t know it was [indecipherable] that he was not reassigned, but you\nknow, of course, it\u2019s several months, you know, that it \u2014 but he was reassigned to go\nto his regiment, and it was 27\" regiment of \u2014 in the army. And so he left, maybe\ntwo or three days after the war broke out.",
        "Q: So, early September.",
        "A: Early September. And by that time I \u2014 and I do remember when later on there \u2014\nthere was a lot of mil \u2014 you know, people and military, they were moving out to \u2014 to\ngo to the border and go to Romania and go to \u2014 to Hungary. So I remember these\ntransports and transports and transports of people on the \u2014 on the \u2014 you know, horse\ndriven carts, and military walking. Thousands of people just moving out. That I \u2014\nthat I\u2019m \u2014 that was even before \u2014 on the \u2014 of cour \u2014 of course before the Russians\ncame in.",
        "Q: So tell me, Dolina(ph), it \u2014 was it close to the border of Romania and\nHungary? And was it close to the border of Soviet Ukraine? How \u2014 was it is \u2014 a\nborderish area. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say.",
        "A: Yes, it must have been about, you know, maybe 50 - 60 kilometers from the\nSoviet Union.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And about the same thing from \u2014 from the other borders. Because you seen that\nPoland was like this, and this thing goes straight over here, you know. So it was \u2014 it\nwas called Do-Dolina(ph) Koa(ph) Stanislawowa (ph), and the Stanislaw6wa(ph)\nwas largest city.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And now it\u2019s called Ivana(ph) Petrowsk(ph) in \u2014 you know, in the Ukrainian.\nSo apparently it wasn\u2019t too far away because people who were just walking, you\nknow, within walking distance from the borders.",
        "Q: And you would see this on your street, where you lived, or would you \u2014",
        "A: No, down below.",
        "Q: Down below.",
        "A: Down below because the main st \u2014 main road was going through there.",
        "Q: Could you see that from your house?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The balcony of your house \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 you could see all the movement.",
        "A: All the transports were walking, you know. And \u2014 and of course at that time we\ndidn\u2019t know what happened with my father at all, because when the Germans\nJanuary 21, 2015\nattacked, of course they\u2019re moving very fast, and the Russians \u2014 on the 17\" of\nSeptember the Russians came in. And my father came back to us after the Russians\nhave occupied our area. And he was wounded. A shrapnel had hit him in the leg,\nand so he was wounded, and he came. I don\u2019t know how, but at that time the border\nwas still kind of fluid.",
        "Q: Permeable, mm-hm.",
        "A: And so he had the chance to \u2014 to escape from \u2014 because his unit was destroyed,\nbit \u2014 be \u2014 by \u2014 by the time he go \u2014 he got there, it \u2014 it was gone. So \u2014 and complete\ndisorder was \u2014 was in charge of everything. And so he managed to come back to us.\nAnd he was wounded, and \u2014 and I remember that somehow they found out that he\ncame back. And the Russian military people came in, and they saw him, and they\nsaw him being wounded, and they said, well, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll send you a doctor. And\nthe Russian doctor came in and was tending to his wound. But my fa \u2014",
        "Q: Was this the fir \u2014 was this the first time you saw any of the Russian soldiers, or \u2014\nor Russian military [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I\u2014 no, we saw them also coming in.",
        "Q: You also saw them coming in.",
        "A: We saw come \u2014 coming in, and they were not very impressive, because they \u2014\nthey we \u2014 they kept, you know, kind of goofy looking boots on it, you know, and \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015\nand th-th-th \u2014 they were not just like, you know, Polish military. They were not\nreally very well dressed, but there were plenty of them, so \u2014 and they were armed.\nSo that I remember, their \u2014 their coming over, you know, transporting \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 themselves into \u2014 into Poland. And then ma \u2014 somehow, I don\u2019t know, they alt\n\u2014 already the underground system must have started, because my father decided that\nhe\u2019s not going to be waiting until she \u2014 he 1s well, so they can take \u2014 take him \u2014 you\nknow, the Russians can take him. So he decided to escape.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And he left us, and went toward the border, and there must have been some kind\nof, you know, group of people that was being formed, and apparently they were just\ncaught on the border.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And he was brought back into our town, which of course we didn\u2019t know. But\nsometime later, his barber, who was a Jew, came to my mother and he said, you\nknow, my \u2014 my cousin is working as a guard 1n \u2014 1n the jail, and he told me that\nyour husband is in jail. And he also said that if we wanted to visit him, he will\npermit us to get in, provided it\u2019s four o\u2019clock in the morning.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: So, we did go, and \u2014",
        "Q: You too, as well, even though you\u2019re a young boy?",
        "A: Yes, SO \u2014 SO we went and \u2014 and he brought my father out from I don\u2019t know\nwhere, and this was the last time we saw him.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: So, it must have been some time in October.",
        "Q: What did he look like?",
        "A: Of course, he was no \u2014 no military uniform, he was dressed up in some kind of a\n\u2014 maybe jail uniform or something, but \u2014 but I don\u2019t exactly remember ama \u2014 as\nthat, you know. But this was the last time we saw him, and as I said, it was probably\nthe \u2014 towards the end of 1939. And then we were told that all the prisoners were\nbeing transported away from \u2014 from Dolina(ph). And several weeks later my\nmother went to Stanistaw6wa(ph), to the larger town, to inquire about what\nhappened with him. And of course, nobody knew anything about it. You know, and\nof course they did, but they didn\u2019t. So this was the last time I saw my father, was \u2014",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 you \u2014 when you went and you saw him then, you didn\u2019t know it was\nthe last time, and your mother didn\u2019t know it was the last time.",
        "A: No, of course not, of course not, because we \u2014 no, we know, you know,\nsomebody\u2019s in jail, who knows what \u2014 what happens. And \u2014 but \u2014 so we didn\u2019t\nJanuary 21, 2015\nexpect him \u2014 but sometime in the beginning of March of 1940, the transport\noccurred, and he was taken out.",
        "Q: Also, you say he must have been in jail for several months before \u2014",
        "A: Before he was \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 he was taken out \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 taken away. Do you remember his demeanor when you saw him? Did you \u2014\nyou know, did \u2014 do you remember anything of what he said, or your mother said, or\nhow long the meeting lasted?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember the \u2014 the \u2014 the words that were exchanged, but it lasted\nabout 15 - 20 minutes, no longer than that, because you know, the \u2014 th-the fellow\nthat was the to \u2014 that permitted that, was taking a very great risk.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because if the \u20141f the NK VD would come in and just \u2014",
        "Q: And find it.",
        "A: \u2014 find it, he \u2014 he would really suffer.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, so \u2014 so it was very brave on \u2014 on his part, and very kind on the part\nof my father\u2019s barber to even come up with this idea.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, so we were grateful for that, but 1t was the last time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and after that we \u2014",
        "Q: What did \u2014 how did your mother live? I mean, how did you \u2014 did you have any\nsavings, did she \u2014 or were you spared from these types of day to day worries, where\nwill the food come from, how will we get by, or things like that?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure that that\u2019s wa \u2014 that\u2019s the way it was, because you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the\npay stopped, of course, everything just was ruined. So \u2014 but it \u2014 I don\u2019t recall that\nshe would be going and selling some of the things like it happened later. But \u2014 but\nthis 1s, apparently she \u2014 they must have had some money. And \u2014 but you know, then\nthe Polish zloty had been exchanged, taken out, and the Russian ruble came in and\n\u2014 and all that, and I really don\u2019t know how \u2014 how that happened, but it was just\nseveral months that we lived, because we \u2014 when the Russians came in it was\nSeptember 17\", and when we were deported, it was April 13\". So it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: So your father \u2014 your \u2014 she finds out that he is \u2014 he is taken away, some time\naround March \u2014 February or March \u2014",
        "A: Something \u2014",
        "Q: 1940?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And she doesn\u2019t know anything else. Did you go to school during those months,\nor was there \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 no school?",
        "A: No, I did not. Every \u2014 ev \u2014 no, everything was just \u2014 just \u2014 the whole thing was\nshut.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You know, and the Russians were taking over, and no, I did not go to, like\nsecond grade at all.",
        "Q: Did you vi\u2014 you and your mother, did you venture out of your apartment, or did\nyou pretty much stay at home during those months?",
        "A: No, I remember we went \u2014 we went into town, and must have been to \u2014 to get\nsome supplies or something, but I don\u2019t exactly remember what stop \u2014 you know,\nwhat store we stopped, or something like that. But \u2014",
        "Q: Did the town look \u2014 did \u2014 did you notice anything in the town, were there a lot of\nsoldiers around, was it \u2014 the atmosphere and things like that, do you remember\nanything about that?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No, but you know, y-yo-you could feel that it was not the same. Then \u2014 and then\nof course, th \u2014 right then from the very beginning, the \u2014 the kind of terror started,\nwhere you wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to anybody freely. You \u2014 you would \u2014 you\nknow, it was \u2014 it \u2014 you could feel that everybody is kind of backing off, you know,\nI\u2019m not going to say anything, and you know, that\u2019s the way it was, because you\ncouldn\u2019t trust anyone any more. And of course, like everywhere else, there were \u2014\nthere were a lot of communists, Polish communists or Ukrainian communists or\nJewish communists. And those people would \u2014 did go into cooperation, so you\nalready didn\u2019t know who you can trust. We apparently trusted my \u2014 you know, the\nlandlord, because then he didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t kick us out or anything like that, so, you\nknow, must have been a very kind and good person to permit that. But, other than \u2014",
        "Q: Did you go to church? Do you remember going to church during these months?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember at all. I don\u2019t remember. And I don\u2019t even know \u2014 I don\u2019t\neven remember what kind of church we went to in \u2014 you know, before that, but \u2014\nbecause I don\u2019t recall \u2014 recall that there was \u2014 there would have been church close\nto where we lived. It must have been somewhere else.",
        "Q: I asked, I mean not only for, you know, whether this keeps up traditions or so on,\nbut sometimes in such moments, that\u2019s where people gather, and they feel safer\ndoing it, even if they may not speak to one another.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sure \u2014 I am sure we did attend the masses got \u2014 but I don\u2019t recall\nseeing \u2014 you know, being any \u2014 any church at the time, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s demeanor like during these \u2014 these months? Did she\nseem to change for you, or not so much?",
        "A: No, I\u2014I- she was apparently a strong character. And so somehow she accepted\nthat, you know, and when she was born and \u2014 until 1914, that part of Poland was\nunder Russian occupation, all \u2014 you know. And so she was not shocked by \u2014 by,\nyou know, being under Russians again somehow.",
        "Q: So L\u00e9dz had been under \u2014 had been under the Russian occupation, earlier in the\ncentury?",
        "A: In \u2014 wha \u2014 1n it \u2014 in \u2014 before the first World War, yes.",
        "Q: That is par \u2014 part of the tsarist empire?",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay, so she was \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the first time she saw Russian soldiers. Or\nsoldiers.",
        "A: Right. Different \u2014 different ones, different uniforms and you know, different\ngovernment kind of thing, but \u2014 but she was familiar with that.",
        "Q: Did she speak Russian?",
        "A: No, she did not. Even \u2014 even \u2014 you know, she probably some few words.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Excuse me. [technical interruption] Okay, where were we? We were talking\nabout your mother, and her knowledge of Russian, or lack of it and so on, and that\nshe was not unfamiliar.",
        "A: Right, but \u2014 but she \u2014 I don\u2019t know, maybe she was just simply not the type to\nlearn other languages. She did learn some sp \u2014 some French, and \u2014 when she was in\nschool, but apparently she had enough to get by when we were finally required to\nspeak Russian. But \u2014 but she did not become fluent, you know. Probably enough\nwords to \u2014 to get by. And the Russians and Polish are very similar, so you could\nreally understand without having to really learn the language. And that\u2019s the way\nshe was.",
        "Q: Okay. So your contact w-with the Russian military authorities sounds like it was\nrather minimal. It was when they came \u2014 the doctor came to look at your father\u2019s\nwound, and then your father left, and \u2014 I should say Soviet military authorities, not\nRussian military authorities.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And then it was when you visit him in \u2014 in prison that one time. Had it \u2014 had\nsoldiers, or had any, from the occupying military authority been down your street or\nin your home in, you know, after that, before \u2014 before April?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No. Becau \u2014 you know that when they found out that my father was going \u2014 was\nout \u2014",
        "Q: Gone.",
        "A: \u2014 they \u2014 I don\u2019t remember that somebody came in to inquire about what\nhappened, that my mother was beaten, or something like that. Somehow we \u2014 we\nwere lucky enough to avoid that kind of contact.",
        "Q: All right. So what happens in April? And what date in April?",
        "A: Then we \u2014 then the first deportation from the Polish territories occurred in \u2014 1n\nFebruary \u2014 in February. And so we were aware of the fact that people were being\ndeported. And of course, you never knew who was going to be the next one. But\nthen on\u2014 on April 13\" at night, another \u2014 three o\u2019clock, four o\u2019clock in the morning\nor something like that, a banging sounded at the door, and the Russian troops came\nin, and th \u2014 we were ordered to pack within half an hour, and we\u2019re being taken\naway. So \u2014",
        "Q: And you were woken up from sleep?",
        "A: Yes, and this is \u2014 this is the standard normal way that those units operated.\nBecause you were asleep, you were drowsy, you know, you \u2014 you don\u2019t \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t resist because you were not organized yet. And so this was the standard\nway that they would come in in the morning. And so we \u2014 my mother packed\nJanuary 21, 2015\nwhatever she could into a match \u2014 kind of box, and we were then taken to the \u2014 to\nthe railroad station in \u2014 in Dolina(ph).",
        "Q: And how were you taken?",
        "A: By \u2014 by horse driven cart.",
        "Q: Okay. Were you the only ones in the cart?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see, so the neighborhood, nobody from downstairs, nobody from across the\nstreet. You were the only ones?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I \u2014 from \u2014 from \u2014 from \u2014 within the nearest \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 area. And we were taken over to the \u2014 to the station and loaded on the \u2014 no, I\ncall it cattle car, it was just a regular, you know, railroad car that how was \u2014 inside\nwas divided into two areas. The middle was open, and then on \u2014 the other two they\nhad the \u2014 they had the lower level and they had another level where we \u2014 they\nwould put the people on.",
        "Q: So there was like bunkbeds inside the \u2014",
        "A: Like a \u2014 like a bu \u2014 like a bunk, but it was just a whole solid floor across the\nwhole thing. And \u2014 and so they loaded the entire thing, I don\u2019t know how many, 60\npeople, I think were just like \u2014 we\u2019re just packed, you know. And the doors were\nJanuary 21, 2015\nshut, and in the, you know, several hours laters, this \u2014 the train started and we\nstarted moving towards the \u2014 the Soviet border.",
        "Q: Did you know that at the time?",
        "A: Which way we were going?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you have one of those bunks, were you standing up, were you\nsitting down, were you \u2014",
        "A: I think we were \u2014 we were on the lower floor.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so th \u2014 and \u2014 and a \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, the only facility that was in the\nthing was \u2014 was a hole in the \u2014 in the floor where you could go and do your\nwhatever \u2014 things. And so we were taken, and it took couple days, I suppose.\nBecause you know, those \u2014 those transports, they are not \u2014 they stopped for military\nand this and that, and they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t care how long it takes for them to\ntravel. So, a-after a couple days we had to be relo \u2014 reloaded into the Russian train.",
        "Q: Tell me \u2014 tell me this, the \u2014 the atmosphere within the cattle car, were people\nsilent? Were they crying, were they talking, were they \u2014 what was \u2014 what was going\non? Did anybody say anything?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall, but I\u2019m sure they did talk ab-about it, you know, and \u2014 but there\nweren't any c-cries, any yellings, or anything like that. It was rather quiet, because\neverybody was s-so scared \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 that you \u2014 you know, I mean all of a sudden you\u2019re taken away \u2014 everything is\nyou \u2014 y-you in completely different world. This is what you have, and that\u2019s all?\nAnd so it wasn\u2019t something that the people start sa \u2014 you know, telling jokes, and\nlaughing, you \u2014 you know. It was \u2014 it was rather silent. And I remember when \u2014\nwhen we came to the border, and we had to move to the Russian trains, because the\nRussian railroad system was wired in Polish. So th \u2014 we couldn\u2019t use Polish trains\nany more. So we were reloaded, and kept going east. And then realized that we are\nbeing sent, you know, into the territory of the so \u2014 Soviet Union. So it \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember how it \u2014 how long it took, but it probably took several weeks for us to\nfinally travel almost to \u2014 to the Ural Mountains, just a \u2014 towards the \u2014 towards the\n\u2014 with \u2014 on the south of the Ural Mountains, and \u2014 and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and the\nsteppe begins, the \u2014 the plains.",
        "Q: Did you have any \u2014 I mean, how did you eat? Did they give you any food, any\nwater?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes, we were ti\u2014 we were fed apparently, you know, the \u2014 the famous Russian\nthing that you can get on a train. It\u2019s called kipiatok, the hot water \u2014 the boiling\nwater from the \u2014 from the engine. So they would open and said okay, okay, go and\nget kipiatok. So everybody went, you know, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did people have cups with them? In \u2014 did you \u2014",
        "A: You \u2014 if y-you better had something on your own. So that was the only liquid\nthat we were given, and they apparently must have stop on their own \u2014 on the \u2014 on\nthe way wherever they stopped, to give us some bread. And in general, in Russian \u2014\nin Russia that\u2019s what you \u2014 if you\u2019re lucky, you eat bread, not like this one 1n here,\nbut \u2014 but you were lucky if you \u2014 if you got, you know, a hundred grams of bread a\nday. And that\u2019s the way we were fed.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 were \u2014 did everybody survive the three weeks?",
        "A: Yes. Which was very different from the first deportation, where people were\ndeported in the middle of the winter. And in that time, many old people, many\nchildren have died o-of \u2014 just froze to death. I-In our case no, because it was \u2014 you\nknow, already spring.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t remember the cold \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 particularly.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No, no, no, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t that, because no, it was just normal spring\ntemperatures already. So we were not freezing and \u2014 an-and it was cold, but we\nwere not freezing.",
        "Q: Did your mother say anything to you during this transport, at \u2014 during the time\nyou\u2019re in the cattle car that you remember? I\u2019m sure you spoke, I\u2019m sure you talked.",
        "A: Oh sure, n-no, I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember any particular \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 like I suppose she must have talked to m \u2014 told me that don\u2019t worry, everything\nis going to be fine, but I don\u2019t recall this, as a particular, you know, moment of my\nlife.",
        "Q: Did you know anybody else prior \u2014 I mean, there were other people on the \u2014 on\nthe cattle car, did you recognize anybody?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, they were all strangers?",
        "A: They were all stranger, y-you know, you were [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You were just [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 and you know, after being two months, you know, in an \u2014 in a new area.",
        "Q: Right.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: But \u2014 but you mir \u2014 you make friends right there, you\u2019re beginning to talk to\npeople and \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, so tell me what happened after that?",
        "A: Okay, and then after \u2014 after traveling for some time, we were unloaded in\nKostanay, which is a capital city of the Kazakhstan, Kazakh Republic. And we\nwere transported to a \u2014 to a kolkhoz, which is \u2014",
        "Q: What\u2019s a kolkhoz?",
        "A: Kolkhoz is a \u2014 is a farm run by the government.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s a\u2014 you know, there was no pra \u2014 private property, there was just a \u2014 when\nthe revolution happened, they took the mi \u2014 the land from the landlords, and from\nthe people and made them into units, which are large administrative units called in \u2014\nI think our case, kolkhoz.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we would \u2014 we put in a \u2014 in a \u2014 the village, and in \u2014 into the house of a \u2014 of\na Ukrainian couple that was deported during 1930s.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: When \u2014 when the \u2014 you know, the Russians started the killing of the Ukrainians,\nand they just simply starved them to death. And I think it was just like nine million\npeople di \u2014 that starved to death, because they started rebelling against the, you\nknow, Russians taking their soil, their land, their \u2014 their things. So they became a\npart of this group that lush \u2014 Russians, as they say, pacified them by transporting\nthem into the Kazakhstan. So \u2014 so they fully realized what we went through,\nbecause they went through it. So they were very kind, very friendly, you know, and\n\u2014 and opened their house for us.",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t that interesting, given that there had been tension and conflict between\nUkrainians and Poles historically \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 particularly in the border regions. And it\u2019s \u2014 kind of \u2014 feels almost like grace,\nthat you \u2014 your destiny brings you to a place where you have people who\nunderstand what you\u2019re going through.",
        "A: Right, you know, and in \u2014 and I \u2014 I don\u2019t to \u2014 I don\u2019t think there was any\nRussian normal person that did not go to some kind of something like that. And\nthen ta \u2014 so, we were there for several months, and my mother was working cutting\npeat.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And how do you \u2014 what does that mean, cutting peat?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Well, you know \u2014 you know what peat is, 1t was \u2014 it\u2019s a\u20141t\u2019s a\u2014 like a\u2014hm. A\ngrowth of \u2014 of \u2014 of a thing \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 like the growth 1s so thick, that 1t \u2014 it forms about a size like that, you\nknow. And once you try \u2014 once you cut it into \u2014 into like squares, and then it gets\ndried up.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then you can burn it.",
        "Q: So it can be used for heating.",

        "Q: And for fuel.",
        "A: Right.",

My son,\nwho is in the military is coming to visit us, and please, for heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t say\nanything against the Soviet government, because he\u2019s going to report you, and he\u2019s\nJanuary 21, 2015\ngoing to report us, and all of us are going to be taken away.

        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: So, you know, that \u2014 this \u2014 th-this \u2014 that\u2019s the way the system worked. That you\nnever \u2014 you \u2014 you never knew \u2014 you couldn\u2019t form any kind of units, like you\nknow, people getting together and thinking and whispering and thing, because you\nwere afraid of your neighbors, of course, but you were also afraid of your own\nchildren, because the propaganda was such strong thing, they said it \u2014 if they \u2014 if he\nheard them talking something about the Soviet Union [indecipherable]\ngovernment, they would a \u2014 a \u2014 have \u2014 against it. They were \u2014 there were people to\nbe \u2014 get in river \u2014 get rid of because you know [indecipherable]",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, and so that\u2019s the whole system worked, 1t worked on the basis of\ncomplete distrust to each other. And \u2014",
        "Q: So that makes it even more remarkable that you \u2014 you were able to form this\nbond with these people, because they had gone through enough that they reached\nJanuary 21, 2015\nout to you, or you reached out to them, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how, but \u2014 but in that\natmosphere.",
        "A: Right, but what \u2014 apparently they \u2014 well, the \u2014 first of all, they knew that we\u2019re\nnew, so we are not part of the system, you know. And \u2014 and the other thing was that\nall of a sudden they realized that they had gone through that, and they may as \u2014 may\nas well open their hearts to people that are going through it right now, you know,\nand so it was \u2014 it was really very nice. But we weren\u2019t there too long.",
        "Q: I see. What happened?",
        "A: And then we were transferred \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, by the way, did the son \u2014 did the son come and did you meet him? Did you\nremember that \u2014 anything about that?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that, but \u2014 but he \u2014 he was going to come right \u2014 right\naway, SO \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A:\u2014so you know, so she \u2014 he must have come.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And you know, then everybody was quiet and \u2014",
        "Q: Right.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 everything was fine. The \u2014 the \u2014 the system is wonderful, and you know, and\nyou have to do anything to survive. So everybody \u2014 they didn\u2019t know exactly what\nto do, what to say, and how to, you know, say hello for the Soviet Union, you\nknow, Batka(ph) Stalin, and \u2014",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: Father Stalin. He was father of the whole Fatherland. So, you know. And it\u2019s\nreally strange that within few years \u2014 because the revolution was in 1917, and that\nwithin few years, it\u2019s to \u2014 what, 20 years, and you could \u2014 you could create such a\nsystem of oppression, that \u2014 of mistrust, of \u2014 of fear. And \u2014 and s \u2014 and many times\nyou didn\u2019t have to say anything. It\u2019s just that you happened to be in the wrong place\nin the wrong time. And you were just arrested.",
        "Q: So this \u2014 this knowledge \u2014 you were seven years old. Did you feel this\nautomatically? Is this something your mother warned you about, so that \u2014 you\nknow, don\u2019t talk here, don\u2019t talk there. How did you know this, as a seven year old\nboy?",
        "A: Well, that \u2014 I was listening to \u2014 to \u2014 to the Ukrainian woman telling my mother\nabout it, and so this \u2014 this is \u2014 it \u2014 1t just becomes natural. You c \u2014 you c \u2014 you\ncould feel this happening, you know, and so everybody just simply shuts up.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And \u2014 and a\u2014 and I d\u2014I didn\u2019t tell you that, but \u2014 but when we were being\ndeported, my \u2014 my little dog Tito, the chocolate eater, the Russian officer that was\nin charge throws it at me and he says [Speaks Russian]. Take \u2014 take your \u2014",
        "Q: Take your dog.",
        "A: \u2014 do-dog with you. And so he was deported with us to the \u2014 to the Soviet Union,\nand \u2014",
        "Q: There was a dog in the cattle car?",
        "A: Yes, a little dog in the \u2014 and the dog is \u2014 dog was about like this. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014\nit\u2019s a kind of a dog that apparently comes from India, but, you know, thousands of\nyears ago. And he was simply a house dog. And when we ended up 1n a \u2014 ina \u2014\nafter being taken away from this kolkhoz and put in another one, which \u2014 which\nwas a\u2014acattle farm \u2014 no, I\u2019m sorry, no, this was the kolkhoz yet. My mother was\ngoing on \u2014 on to this \u2014 cutting this \u2014 this peat. And he run after her one time, and\nthen he c \u2014 he run away and come \u2014 comes back after a while, jumping at my\nmother and \u2014 and you know, and \u2014 and howling and taking, you know, just come\nwith me, you know. So \u2014 so she goes with him into the steppe, and she sees a\u2014a\nbig rabbit, killed. And killed by this little dog. And what happened in \u2014 in all these\ngenerations of being house pet, in \u2014 in circumstances like this, his past comes to\nhim. Because apparently these dogs were used to kill the snakes.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: And they\u2019re little \u2014 little dog, half of the \u2014 of the rabbit, jumps at the rabbit,\ngrabs him here by the throat and kills him one \u2014 once [indecipherable]. And then \u2014\nwhy did he realize that my mother will be very happy to take this, I don\u2019t know. But\nshe came in and \u2014 and we had the feast that evening.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s amazing and I\u2019m also amazed that the\ncattle car people didn\u2019t eat your little dog, cause everybody\u2019s hungry.",
        "A: He was not much to eat, you know, so the \u2014 wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t even feed one\nperson, so probably that\u2019s why he survived. And he survived through the \u2014 all \u2014 all\nour being in Russia, and we took him back, you know, we took him to Teheran,\nand I\u2019Il tell you that later.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. So he got some of your crumbs of bread when you were in the cattle\ncar, and that allowed him to survive, too.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Wow. Okay. So your mother is then transferred. How \u2014 do military authorities,\nor the local authorities \u2014",
        "A: No, the \u2014 the \u2014 the loc \u2014 loc \u2014 local ter \u2014 authorities just loaded us up and you\nknow, send us to another area, and that area was \u2014 it was a f \u2014 a farm that was\ndedicated to raising cattle.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so all of a sudden from peat digger, she becomes a cattle rise \u2014 raiser. She\nhad a group of 30 calves that she had to take into the steppe, feed, you know.",
        "Q: So, shepherdess.",
        "A: Shepherdess, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so she \u2014 she was doing that for the rest of the stay up north.",
        "Q: For a city girl.",
        "A: For a city girl who \u2014 person that was taking care of, you know, camps an-and\nthings like that. But that \u2014 that was normal, and 1-1f \u2014 in \u2014 in Russia there is a\nsaying that [speaks Russian]",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What does that mean?",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t eat. So \u2014 so everybody had to work.",
        "Q: What about you?",
        "A: No, I was too small. But then wa \u2014 once we were transferred to the other\nlocation, and it was already getting into the time when the \u2014 when the schoolyear\nbegins, I was assigned to go to the Russian school.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: So this is half a year. If you\u2019re leaving in April, if you\u2019re deported in April 13\",\n1940, you spend a couple of months in the first place, and then several months in\nthe second, and \u2014",
        "A: End of September came around \u2014",
        "Q: And then September comes around.",
        "A: \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and I was \u2014 and I was \u2014 I was put to school, and I \u2014 again for\nthe fir \u2014 to the first grade, because I, you know, didn\u2019t know Russian at all. And \u2014\nbut for a kid to learn is much faster, and so I \u2014 I went to school, and apparently I\nwas very good, because I have \u2014 I got a diploma.",
        "Q: You got a diploma?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see the diploma.",
        "A: Oh yes, I have \u2014 I have a diploma that I was given after graduation \u2014 after\ncompleting the first grade.",
        "Q: So that would have been a regular school year, September to May or June or\nsomething.",
        "A: Something like that. And this is my diploma.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness. Got that?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And it \u2014 and this [speaks Russian] or diploma, because I \u2014 I graduated as \u2014 as a\n\u2014 one of the first students. I had \u2014 everything was very good, and so Batchka(ph)\nStalin, Lenin gave me this in appreciation.",
        "Q: Well, were you proud of it as a young child, or did you already feel a sarcasm\nthere?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: IL already knew what it was all about.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "A: So somehow I am \u2014 I managed to save them, and you know, this is really \u2014 the\nonly thing that I remember, that proves that \u2014 that I was deported to the Soviet\nUnion.",
        "Q: You never had any other kind of \u2014 of \u2014",
        "A: Documents, passports or something like that? I \u2014 I don\u2019t think so. I do \u2014 I don\u2019t\nrecall seeing anything that my mother had.",
        "Q: Now, when those soldiers came to deport you, did they in \u2014 you know, back in\nDolina(ph), did they say why? Did they say, you\u2019re enemies, or did they just say,\npack up you\u2019re leaving?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s all. They just simply do not discuss these things. It\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: No reason given.",
        "A: \u2014 no reason given, just pack up and go. And so, you know \u2014 but I\u2014- \u2019m-\u2014 ina\nway I\u2019m glad that I \u2014 that I went to school, because I still remember a lot of\nRussian. I cannot \u2014 I cannot just talk too much, because you know that, after years\nof not using it. But \u2014 but \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult for me to \u2014 to read, but after a\nwhile I can \u2014 I can begin to read, you know, and so like [indecipherable] just, you\nknow, it comes out. But \u2014 but it\u2019s \u2014 but it isn\u2019t \u2014 oh, and this is \u2014 this is [speaks\nRussian] the national \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, commissariat of education.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: So, you know, I\u2019m very proud of this.",
        "Q: Well, actually, I think it\u2019s something very much to be proud of, for a child that is\ntraumatized like that, to still be able to perform in school to such \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and I di \u2014 passed grades, so \u2014",

        "A: Well, you know, it wa \u2014 it was \u2014 I\u2019m glad yat \u2014 that I did, that I didn\u2019t waste my\ntime, that I have learned basics to the point where \u2014 I'll tell you later, probably, this\nwas useful for me when I was in U.S. Army.",
        "Q: No kidding. No kidding. Okay, we\u2019ll talk about that.",
        "A: Okay. Anyway, so th-the rest of the time that we spent in 1941 \u2014",
        "Q: So where did you \u2014 excuse me \u2014 you \u2014 you moved to this other place where she\nbecomes \u2014 she starts herding cattle. Your living circumstances, were you \u2014 tell me a\nlittle about that.",
        "A: Well, we lived in a \u2014 in a\u2014 a barrack.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: That we were assigned, I think we were like three families in \u2014 1n one room in a\nbarrack. And s \u2014 it was just the place for you to put down for night. And because\nmy mother was working, so she was entitled to \u2014 to some kind of a ability to get\nfood, you know, from the local store.",
        "Q: Were you hungry during these times, during these months?",
        "A: Most of the people in the Soviet Union are hungry. If you survive on a piece of\nbread that\u2019s about that size, you know, of loaf of bread, and maybe little bit of\nvegetables, or something that, you know, that come out your way, yes, you are\nhungry all the time. Maybe you\u2019re not starving, but you know, you don\u2019t \u2014 you\ndon\u2019t \u2014 and there\u2019s not much \u2014 not \u2014 not mu-much else to eat. And you just \u2014 so you\njust simply feed yourself with th-the least things that you can get. And it \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 ina\nway it\u2019s good because you don\u2019t have to spend your time cooking things, you know.\nBut \u2014",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a far cry from Tito eating candies off of a Christmas tree.",
        "A: Yes, it was a ver \u2014 a very far cry. But Tito was wi-with us, and he \u2014 he became a\n\u2014a protector dog of the cattle. Because I remember one time the \u2014 the wolves came\ninto the village, you know, to see if they can get one of those calves, you know.\nAnd it was in \u2014 in the evening and I remember the whole village came out with \u2014\nwith you know, something to bang on and trying to get those \u2014 those wolves out.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nAnd my dog run out and he started after them. And since they never saw anything\nlike that in their lives, they got scared. So they started escaping and he run after\nthem. And I said to myself, well, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the end of Tito. Well, after couple\nhours he comes back, he\u2019s \u2014 his mouth full of \u2014 of you know, wolves\u2019 \u2014",
        "Q: Fur?",
        "A: \u2014 wolves\u2019 fur. So apparently he was chasing them and \u2014 and biting them, and he\nchased them away. So he became a hero of \u2014 of the \u2014 of the farm. So \u2014 he had quite\na life.",
        "Q: Was sort of like, you know, in Shakespeare when he wrote \u201cRomeo and\nJuliet,\u201d and it was a tragedy, he\u2019d introduce some comic relief. So here is Tito, he\u2019s\nthe comic relief.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. And so, you know, all the people in the village really\nliked him, you know, and all that kind of stuff. And he survived until later. And I'll\ntell you about that.",
        "Q: Okay. So, during this time, do you know whether your mother was able to\ninquire about your father, or not even?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, not at \u2014 not at all.",
        "Q: Not at all.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No, because the system is such that once you \u2014 you become arrested, you are lost\nto your family. You just simply, you know \u2014 and you don\u2019t want to \u2014 anybody to\nknow, because then you became a \u2014 a\u2014 an enemy of the people. So, you know \u2014 but\neverybody knew, of course, that we are the enemies, because once we were\ndeported, that means that you are the enemy. And \u2014 but \u2014 but \u2014 but the locals were\nunderstanding. They knew, because they went through the same thing themselves.",
        "Q: Even in the second place?",
        "A: Ena \u2014 even in the second place. It was \u2014 some of the people were there, you\nknow, the same way, and the only other thing that I remember, other than just \u2014 just\ngoing to school is that one time a Russian, whoever, one of the representatives came\nin to me and he said, you know, we \u2014 we lost a couple horses, they escaped, they\nrun away into the steppe and they probably went to this other vil \u2014 you know, place.\nAre you willing to \u2014 to go after them and bring them back? And of course I said\nyes, of course. So they gave me a horse, and they say okay, you go that \u2014 that\ndirection, and that \u2014 that village is over there. And somehow I managed to go there.",
        "Q: You\u2019re eight years old.",
        "A: Eight years old. And to bring those two horses back. And in the meantime my\nmother almost had a heart attack, because they told her do \u2014 what they did. And you\nJanuary 21, 2015\nknow, to get lost in the steppe is no problem at all. But somehow, I don\u2019t know\nhow, I managed to come back.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So not only my dog was a hero, but I was a hero also.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 when you were in the cattle car, and you started talking to people, do\nyou remember anything about any of those people, what kind of people they were,\nwhether they were all military families, or some professions, or \u2014",
        "A: No, they\u2019re \u2014 they were a congregation of all kinds of people. Because you\nknow, anybody that worked for the polis \u2014 Polish government was naturally a \u2014 a\u2014",
        "Q: An enemy.",
        "A: \u2014an enemy. So they \u2014 they had professors, they had teachers, they had, you\nknow, simple people who were in the army, you know, for example, you know, just\n\u2014 just being a private in the army. But it was in the army of the \u2014 of the enemy of\nthe \u2014 of the Soviet Union, so \u2014",
        "Q: And when you were in both places, I get the impression that your contact,\nactually, with official authorities was rather minimal. They weren\u2019t part of your\ndaily life, but they controlled your lives.",
        "A: Right, because you know, th-the \u2014 the thing is that \u2014 that once you get deported\ninto these vast territories, you \u2014 you \u2014 you can be physically free, because you\u2019re\nJanuary 21, 2015\nnot going to go away anywhere, because it 1s just simply impossible to escape. And\nI read many books later on, that \u2014 it\u2019s the same thing is written in \u2014 in many books\nor people that were actually in jail, they were \u2014 they were, you know, under \u2014 under\nthe \u2014 the supervision of the \u2014 of the military and things. And \u2014 but they were free to\nmove about, because they didn\u2019t c \u2014 there was no way you can escape. Because you\nknew that once you walked away into the \u2014 into the steppe, you\u2019re dead. And if\nyou\u2019re not going to just die because of hunger, you \u2014 th-the wolves are going to get\nyou.",
        "Q: Tell ma \u2014 you know, for those of us, and I\u2019m one of them, who \u2014 I\u2019ve never been\nin a steppe. What does a steppe look like?",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it-it\u2019s a just vast space, flat.",
        "Q: Anything grows in it?",
        "A: Just a \u2014 just weeds, just, the s \u2014 you know, grass. No trees. Just simply no trees,\njust flat as you \u2014 as far as you can go. Just like sometimes it feels here in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014\nin \u2014 even in Illinois, except here they are, you know, they\u2019re farms. But over there\njust simply, what it probably was here a couple hundred years ago, just plain full of\ngrasses.",
        "Q: And probably small animals.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And some \u2014 some small animals, some wolves, you know, things. And in the\nmiddle of those \u2014 of those things, there were these locations of different farms, and\nlike this one that we went \u2014 that we were, the \u2014 the cattle farm. Or there were \u2014\nthere were both the grown-up cattle and the calves, you know, and so \u2014",
        "Q: You might have \u2014 you might have mentioned it before, but tell me again the\nname of the first place you were at, with the Ukrainian couple, and the second\nplace.",
        "A: The first place I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But \u2014 but the second one I \u2014 I even know the address. [speaks Russian]. The\nfirst \u2014 the farm number one, Krabawick(ph) was \u2014 was a little town that was like a\nc\u2014acounty seat.",

        "A: So, that I remember. The little [indecipherable] I don\u2019t remember what its name\nwas.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: So, you were there at least through the school year. What about the summer of\n1941? Where \u2014 in June 1941, the Soviet Union is attacked by Nazi Germany. Did\nyou find out about that in this remote, remote place?",
        "A: Apparently yes, later on, because you know the \u2014 th-the newspapers would\narrive there from time to time, and th-they would learn from the Russians we would\n\u2014 we would find out. But it wasn\u2019t until later, of course, that it came to us somehow,\nyou know, through word of mouth or whatever, is that \u2014 that there \u2014 once the\nRussians were attacked, and the Germans were moving very rapidly, th-the\nRussians somehow managed to make contact with the \u2014 with the west, with the\nBritish and the Americans. And they formed a ali-alliance all of a sudden. And so,\nbecause they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t have enough equipment, you know, so the \u2014 so the\nBritish and the Americans started supplying them with \u2014 with the military\nequipment. And at that time, of course, the \u2014 the relationships between the Soviet\nUnion and the Polish government was broken in 1939, and we didn\u2019t have any mu \u2014\na-any diplomat relations with \u2014 with them at all.",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 explain how there could be a Polish government, where was it?",
        "A: Well, in \u20141n 1939, as I told you, there were people, hundreds of people,\nthousands of people moving out of Poland, going \u2014 going south. The Polish\ngovernment also left. And from \u2014 from Hungary they were then transported to\nJanuary 21, 2015\nFrance, and they f \u2014 reformed as a \u2014 as a new government representing different\npolitical parties. Then es-established this \u2014 themselves in France, and they started\nbuilding up Polish military, because there were a lot of people that were escaping.\nAnd that \u2014 they somehow managed to escape then from \u2014 from \u2014 from Romania\nand from Hungary, where they were \u2014 they were interned, because those countries\nwere \u2014 were in \u2014 were \u2014 what do you call it? Were not participating in war, they\nwere \u2014 they were neutral. So they \u2014 by the thousands they just run different ways.\nYou know, the \u2014 the roads opened to Italy and \u2014 and all kinds of places.",
        "Q: So this is where your father had hoped to be able to land.",
        "A: That\u2019s what he was hoping, that he\u2019s going to \u2014 to end up. And so they formed\nmilitary units in France. And then, of course, when France was attacked, they did\ngive up even sooner than \u2014 than Poland did. And since we had an alliance with \u2014\nwith the British, the British had evacuated Polish troops from France, into\nEngland. And this \u2014 so the Polish government had reestablished itself in England,\nand upon British insistence, the Soviet Union, because I don\u2019t know exactly what \u2014\nwhat was the \u2014 the \u2014 the words, but they said, you know, okay, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll qui \u2014\ngive you equipment, but you know, you got \u2014 you \u2014 you telling us to open the\nsecond front, you know, we not quite ready yet. But you have thousands of Polish\ntroops in the Soviet Union prisons. Why don\u2019t you release them, and you\u2019ll have\nJanuary 21, 2015\nready troops, you know. So somehow they managed to reestablish relationship with\nthe Polish government in \u2014 in London.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s the Americans and the British who are saying this to the Soviets?",
        "A: Right. They said, you know, wis\u2014we\u2019ll help you, but \u2014 but you know, you\nsaying that you don\u2019t have enough troops, and blah-blah-blah-blah, this or this. But\nyou know, you have \u2014 you have maybe couple hundred thousand troops that you\nhave arrested when you came into Poland. Because that\u2019s what happened, you\nknow, because the units that were located in \u2014 1n the east, they were all, you know,\ntaken over by the Russians, and by the thousands they were deported to Russia.\nAnd as you probably know, the \u2014 the \u2014 many of the officers and \u2014 and a \u2014 and a --\nleading classes, like judges and teachers and things, they were \u2014 they were arrested\nby the thousands by the Soviets. And \u2014 and then the Polish officer corps, at \u2014 at\nleast they know about 20,000 that were killed in Katyn, which was several times\nwhere they decided to liquidate the Polish military prisoners of war, which was\nagainst, you know, the Geneva Conference, of course. But they killed 14,000 that\nwas known, that \u2014 that were \u2014 that \u2014 that were killed.",
        "Q: Do you think your father might have been amongst them?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think so, because those were the officers\nthat were \u2014 that were arrested as \u2014 as they gave themselves up to \u2014 to the Russians.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nBecause you know, Poland ha \u2014 had a \u2014 had a \u2014 a pact of \u2014 of military help. And of\ncourse when the Germans and the Russians reestablished their pact, th-the Russians\njust liquidated that \u2014 that pact, so th-th-the officers that were arrested, you know, in\nthe \u2014 in the military, they were in mi-military uniforms, they were in the units. So\nthe troops were sent, you know, into exile, but the officers were put in the \u2014 in a\u2014 in\nthe prisons.",
        "Q: Let me go back a little bit. When you were talking about the first days of the\nwar, and the Germans overri \u2014 overrunning Poland very, very quickly. And then\nSeptember 17\" the Soviet army marching in. Were you surprised to see the Soviet\narmy? Did anybody \u2014 I mean, did anybody expect to see them? How did they kn \u2014",
        "A: Th-Th-They \u2014 they came in and they were actually saying that they are helping\nus. They are liberating us.",
        "Q: From?",
        "A: From the possibility of being taken over by the Germans. And then \u2014",
        "Q: So that was \u2014 that was what officially was being spoken?",
        "A: This what \u2014 what \u2014 what was telling people on the street, you know. And\nbecause we didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, th-they didn\u2019t let know that they had the Stalin li-\nlibben \u2014 Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, which they signed in August.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: So tell \u2014 I mean, this 1s all stuff outside of your own specific experience. But to\nput it in some context, can you explain a little bit about that pact?",
        "A: Well, as I said, th-the \u2014 the Russian and Poland had non-aggression pact \u2014",
        "Q: Russia and Poland, mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 for the \u2014 for the 10 years, and so we did not expect that the Soviets would\nmove. But the Hitler and \u2014 and Stalin signed a pact, called the Ribbentrop-\nMolotov Pact.",
        "Q: And what \u2014 what are those names? Mili \u2014",
        "A: Ribbentrop was a German repres-representative of \u2014 of the government, and the\nMolotov was the \u2014 the Russian like min \u2014",
        "Q: Soviet.",
        "A: \u2014 Soviet \u2014 Soviet minister of mili \u2014 of the military affairs. And so they signed a\npact where the \u2014 the Russians told the Germans that they are \u2014 they will attack\nPoland from the \u2014 from the east. And they pre-assigned the border, which they are\ngoing to divide Poland into \u2014 into, you know, into two parts. And so, on September\n17\", they just simply moved.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And \u2014 and so the \u2014 all the Polish military were, you know, surprised as to what\u2019s\ngoing on. We have pact of non-aggression with you, and \u2014 and so that\u2019s what\nhappens.",
        "Q: So, in other words, they had the pact. There were several pacts going on. There\nwas a Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, and there was a surprise on the side of the\nPoles when they see the Soviets there, because what happened to our pact? Then\nthere is the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was signed \u2014",
        "A: Which kind of canceled \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 canceled that one.",
        "A: \u2014 canceled the Polish \u2014 Polish-Russian pact.",
        "Q: And that one is when Nazi Germany and Soviet Union agree not to fight each\nother, and divide Poland.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And then when the Soviets march in, they tell people \u2014 locally, the word on the\nstreet is that we\u2019re here to save you from the Germans.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. All right.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: We are here to help you. And so, you know \u2014 and the \u2014 and then the \u2014 once the \u2014\nthis became and \u2014 and they came in to Poland and \u2014 and all that, I remember they\nwere al-always saying [speaks Russian]",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: We are friends with Germany.",
        "Q: They would say that?",
        "A: They would s \u2014 the military, you know, people that \u2014 well, the authorities, were\nsaying that they are friends of the Germans.",
        "Q: And yet they\u2019re saving you from German occupation.",
        "A: Right. Well, because they took over, you know, that \u2014 that \u2014 and that they \u2014 you\nknow, several months after they \u2014 they took over, even before we were deported,\nthey had elections. And 99.9 percent of Poles voted for those territories to become\nparts of the Soviet Union. O-On paper, of course.",
        "Q: Did your mother have to vote in those elections?",
        "A: Everybody had to vote. And it didn\u2019t make any difference how you voted,\nbecause the percentage came out 99.9 anyway. So \u2014",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s go back to the address of the place that you were, which I could not\nrepeat for the life of me. And in June 1941, the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union,\nJanuary 21, 2015\nand somehow world \u2014 word must filter to your village that \u2014 that now \u2014 you know,\nthere is an attack, the Soviet Union is at war on its own territory.",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s not [indecipherable] yet, but they were \u2014 they just moved to \u2014 to\nwest \u2014",
        "Q: Eastern.",
        "A: \u2014 the eastern part of Poland, and then it\u2019s a military \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But apparently this is what \u2014 this 1s what \u2014 what happened, and as I said the \u2014\nthey would receive from y \u2014 from time to time the newspapers, and all of a sudden\nne \u2014 you know, the newspaper just turned out to write like that. Because once we\nwere friends, and now we\u2019re the enemies. And so, somehow this kind of\ninformation got leaked into \u2014 into our areas. But it didn\u2019t make any \u2014 any\ndifference, until later on, when the re \u2014 when the relations were reestablishment\nbetween the Polish and the Russian government. And when the Russian issued a \u2014 a\ndocument, which made us back free citizens, with ability to move on the territory of\nthe Soviet Union.",
        "Q: And when did you find out about this? How did \u2014 did somebody come to the \u2014\nthe barracks that you and your mother lived in, one day, and say you\u2019re free now,\nyou can move about the Soviet Union?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how it happened, of course you know. But \u2014 but this is \u2014 I know\nthat later on from \u2014 from reading, that this is what happened, 1s that \u2014 that all of a\nsudden, even the people in our \u2014 1n our little community have realized that now they\ncan move about.",
        "Q: But \u2014 but \u2014 okay, now I\u2019m going back to your life and your mother\u2019s life and\nyour experiences. How did this happen with the two of you? Was there a moment\nwhen you found out, and do you remember that moment?",
        "A: Oh. I remember \u2014 one \u2014 one thing I remember is that after that happened, is that\nall of a sudden the older \u2014 the people that were located within \u2014 within the territory\nthat we were in, somehow they discovered that the Polish army is being formed, in\nthe southern states of the Soviet Union. And so everybody started moving south.",
        "Q: So in other words, you knew that you could \u2014 all right, I think I\u2019d like to stop\nhere now, though \u2014 [break]\nEnd of File One\nJanuary 21, 2015\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Mr. Witold Pawlikowski, on January 21\u2018, 2015. And before the\nbreak, Mr. puli \u2014 Pawlikowski, we were talking about the moment, or let\u2019s say the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the time when you and your mother learned of the agreement that the Polish\ngovernment in exile made with the Soviet Union, and what was going on, you\nknow, in those \u2014 in those immediate days and months. Before we get to that, I want\nto know, did your \u2014 did you make friends, did your mother make friends with other\nPoles while \u2014 or other people while she was in the Soviet Union? You had\nmentioned before that people were very distrustful, and kept a distance between\nthemselves. Was there ever any exception to that, when people bridged the gap?",
        "A: Well, in a way, but you know, it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a friendship. You just\ndon\u2019t develop friendship all of a sudden like that. It was \u2014 1t \u2014 it was a\u2014 a kind\nfeelings towards us, und-understanding feelings, that they know what we\u2019re going\nthrough because they have been through it.",
        "Q: That means the locals who were there.",
        "A: Right. And \u2014 and \u2014 but it\u2019s very gi \u2014 difficult to call friendship, if you\u2019re there\nfor three or four months and you move somewhere else, you know. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not th\nJanuary 21, 2015\n\u2014 not the same thing as you develop friendships over a long period of time. But it\nwas g-good relationships, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "Q: And what about other deportees. Di \u2014 do you get to meet or get to know, in any\nway become close to other deportees?",
        "A: Yes. The-These \u2014 these were \u2014 these were your \u2014 your people, and so, you know,\nand \u2014 and since we are in the same village, and well, like I said beginning that we\nlived in with two other families in there. So \u2014 so you developed this kind of\nfriendship. Which lasts \u2014 I have friends now that \u2014 that I \u2014 not too many, I \u2014I\nhaven\u2019t \u2014 those that I met in the Soviet Union, they all went different ways. But the\nones later on in Teheran and Iran, I \u2014 I ha\u2014 I maintain friendship with those\npeople until now. And I \u2014 I remember an \u2014 an incident when I was working for steel\n\u2014U:S. Steel Corporation, and I was traveling throughout the United States, and I\n\u2014 so I\u2014I went \u2014 I was going to Cleveland, and I told my boss, I \u2014 I said that\u2019s\ngreat, because I have a friend in Cleveland. And then a few months later, I-I was\ngoing to Philadelphia, and I said, oh, it\u2019s terrific, I have a friend in Philadelphia.\nAnd then I\u2019m going to San Francisco, and he says, if you tell me that you have a\nfriend in San Francisco, I won\u2019t believe it. And I said, but I do. So he said, how in\nthe heck could you guys do that? Well, you know, I have a friend that I just talked\nto just recently who \u2014 who lives in \u2014 in Argentina. I have friends in Australia.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nThat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the way \u2014 what happens, you know, that those people spread around\nall over the place. I have fre \u2014 friends in Canada that \u2014 that we visit, and we \u2014 we\nkeep the \u2014 those friendships.",
        "Q: You mentioned something to me earlier, that your mother also developed such\nfriendships. That there was a lady in particular who was her best friend.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about her?",
        "A: We-\u2014 we \u2014 we were in the same collective farm, and she was there with her\nmother.",
        "Q: Who was this lady?",
        "A: Her \u2014 her name was Leila. She was a Polish Jewess, and my mother had\ndeveloped close friendship with her, and then when we \u2014 we left, she went to\nEngland sooner than we did, because her brother was in the Polish army.",
        "Q: So she was Jewish, and she had been deported as well.",
        "A: She wa \u2014 she was deported as well, with her mother. And so when \u2014 when \u2014 after\nyears that we haven\u2019t seen her, because she was already in England, when we\nfinally ended up in England, she \u2014 she ca-came to visit us, and then I was moving\nto London from the little town that \u2014 up in the \u2014 almost on the Scottish border. And\nso she accepted me there, I was with \u2014 with her for some time.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Oh, so you lived with her, then?",
        "A: I lived with her, and then after years, you know, after I came here, and I was in\nthe army again, and we f\u2014 with a friend mi \u2014 of mine, we \u2014 we went to visit\nLondon, and we went to visit her. And at that time she was working for a very\nexclusive nightclub.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: And she invited us and \u2014 and we met Mr. Errol Flynn.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness. And \u2014",
        "A: So \u2014so, you know, these friendships last a lifetime, because you had something\nin common.",
        "Q: You had this experience that you\u2019d gone through.",
        "A: Yes. Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you ever meet her brother, who was in the Polish army?",
        "A: Yes, and he moved to the United States, he lived somewhere in the \u2014 1n the west\ncoast, and he\u2019s gone by now.",
        "Q: And do you know much about their story, where they were from? Where she \u2014\nwhat town she was from in Poland?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No, I-",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t, no. But she was very close with my mother an-and I \u2014 I have a picture.",
        "Q: Okay. Maybe you\u2019ll show me later. Okay, terrific. So, there you are \u2014",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable] her last name was Yolis(ph).",

        "A: Right.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Okay. So \u2014 so yes, so your mother and other people in \u2014 you know, who were \u2014\nwho were deported from Poland learn about this agreement where you\u2019 re free to\nmove, yes?",
        "A: Right, and \u2014 and how did it come and all way to this little godforsaken place, I\ndon\u2019t know, but we found out that there is an agreement, and that by this agreement\nall the Poles are released from the prisons, and then the Polish army is being\nformed. So when \u2014 when this group of Poles in our village and o-other places heard\nthat, they all got together and they decided to move south towards where the army\nwas being formed.",
        "Q: So how were you going to do that? How did they do that?",
        "A: We were transported to \u2014 to this \u2014 to the railroad station, I don\u2019t know how, how\nthey managed this I have no idea, but the transport was formed and we were moved\nto the railroad station, loaded on a train. And the train, I think it was like six weeks\nthat we were on the train. Again, the cattle car, and so we were moving from one\nplace to another, until we went to \u2014 through Tashkent(ph), the place that my\ngrandfather was \u2014 was in, and we went through Bukhara(ph) and I \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nhow many other places.",
        "Q: Was \u2014 was the cattle car different than the first cattle car?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 it was slightly bigger, because of \u2014 of the railroad system of \u2014 in \u2014\nin the Soviet Union. But the \u2014 the \u2014 you know \u2014",
        "Q: The slats were the same.",
        "A: The slats were the sa \u2014 the same. Except for more people.",
        "Q: And I take it they weren\u2019t closed then, and \u2014 and you weren\u2019t locked into these\ncattle cars.",
        "A: No, we were not locked any more.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, because we were free citizens to move about. Which is, you know, very\nunusual in the Soviet Union. And so, in traveling all these \u2014 these distances, we\nfinally ended up where they decided to unload us because the railroad wheels were\nbeing abused, you know, so we had to discharge. And they moved us to a kolkhoz\ncalled Frumza(ph).",
        "Q: So this was a collective farm called Frumza(ph)?",
        "A: It was a collec \u2014 collective farm called Frumza(ph), and is \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t far\naway, maybe 20 kilometers from what they call now Almaty(ph).",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: Or Almata(ph).",
        "Q: Almata(ph), mm-hm.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And so we\u2019re unloaded there, and put in a kolkhoz, and then we found out that a\npart of the division is being formed in \u2014 in alna \u2014 Almata(ph). And we were with\nthis other woman and her son, and both my mother and she became ill with typhoid\nfever, and she died.",
        "Q: The other lady died?",
        "A: The other lady died. The son was 15 or 16 at that time, older than I was, and so\nmy mother, you know, took care of him. And my mother almost died also, but she\nwas \u2014 and she was \u2014 she was \u2014 she told me later on she was moved from the room,\ninto the hallway, and this \u2014 the \u2014 the nurses said uzha(ph) konshied(ph). She\u2019s\nfinishing up. And \u2014 and then my mother said no. I have a son. And then she\nrecovered. And so, what happened that this \u2014 this \u2014 this lady\u2019s husband was in a \u2014 in\na Polish military unit, a corps of engineers, and he escaped and was in \u2014 in\nPalestine. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did she know that, or \u2014",
        "A: And she knew that, and he had also her addresses from \u2014 from the Soviet Union.\nSo he discovered that his best friend is in a unit that is being formed in Almata(ph).\nAnd his friend came to pick us up \u2014 pick them up and take them to where the\nmilitary was. And she was gone already, so instead, we were taken, and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: And the boy.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 and the boy. And \u2014",
        "Q: What was his name? Do you remember?",
        "A: Janusz.",
        "Q: And his last name?",
        "A: Sohachewski(ph).",
        "Q: Sohachewski(ph).",
        "A: Sohachewski(ph). And when \u2014 when \u2014 when we came to Teheran his father\ntook him and brought him to \u2014 to Palestine, and enrolled him in \u2014 in the Polish like\norganization of \u2014 like a mil \u2014 paramilitary organization. And then, of course he went\nto England, and he lives in England [indecipherable] right now, and we keep in\ntouch.",
        "Q: Amazing. Amazing.",
        "A: So, you know, he\u2019s just like my older brother.",
        "Q: Did you have hopes of maybe finding out about your father when the Polish\nmilitary unit was formed?",
        "A: Right. My \u2014 my \u2014 my mother had written to the Polish Red Cross, and the\ninternational Red Cross and I \u2014 somewhere she has a \u2014 a document which 1s \u2014 it\nappears that your husband has died on the territory of the Soviet Union. And that\u2019s\nthe only thing we have.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "A: But there \u2014 there\u2019s no record of when and how, of what causes \u2014 was it his wo \u2014\nyou know, re \u2014 reworking of the wound, or was he killed? We don\u2019t know. Because\nthis kind of documentation you simply do not get from that system. There, nobody\nknows anything. And as \u2014 it\u2019s much easier that way. And you know, it \u2014 to me,\nright now, it doesn\u2019t make any difference. I know that he perished. So what else can\nyou do? But, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something that you have to live with, and\nsomething that you must realize, that this is what happened, that you have gone\nthrough some unusual circumstances, and \u2014 and you have to live, because if you\ndon\u2019t, if you think about it all the time, you can really hurt yourself quite a bit. So\nthat\u2019s why me \u2014 maybe I have forgotten some of these things, maybe purposely, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: That\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: But you know \u2014 but it\u2019s one of those \u2014 those things, and what difference does it\nmake where he 1s, and if I \u20141f I could find his grave or something? It\u2019s 50 some\nyears, you know, he\u2019s gone. And you know, I \u2014 I d\u2014I know he\u2019s gone and I know\nthat he\u2019s perished at the \u2014 you know, in the territories of the Soviet Union and \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s it.",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s satisfactory to me.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Did you find that when you were s \u2014 when you were already \u2014 had you already\nleft the Soviet Union, or before, your mother?",
        "A: Yes, I think it was already in \u2014 1n Teheran that she found out, right. And we\nhave never \u2014 there was nev \u2014 never a trace of him, you know, somebody coming out\nthat knew him from the prison or something. Nothing. Just gone. So I \u2014 I suppose\nhe must have died soon after he was deported, you know, and probably from the\nwound, because it wasn\u2019t healed, at that time.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your journey from Almata(ph) to actually leaving the\nSoviet Union. What was that like?",
        "A: Well, first of all, you know, once we were under the protection of \u2014 of the\nmilitary, we began to be fed.",
        "Q: The Polish military. Even though \u2014 even still in Kazakhstan?",
        "A: In\u20141in \u2014 still in \u2014 in Uzbekistan because Almaty(ph) is in \u2014",
        "Q: Uzbekistan.",
        "A: \u2014 Uzbekistan.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 so our survival was \u2014 the possibility of survival was much, much\nbetter terms. And then, as I said before, the \u2014 the Russians didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to arm\nthe Polish military, because it was \u2014 you know, something that they just don\u2019t do.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nYou do not arm the enemies, who become now friends, and so \u2014 so they were still\nasking Americans and British to open up the front, and \u2014 and they said, well you\nhave \u2014 you have the Polish army, you have over 100,000 troops, you know, why\ndon\u2019t you arm them? Oh, we don\u2019t have anything to do. So the British said, well,\nthen you release them. Let us take care of them, let us arm them, and they can\nbecome a part of the second front when we finally open it. So, by miracle I suppose,\nUncle Stalin decided that yes, okay, we will do that. And we were released. And so\nmilitary started moving [indecipherable] troops.",
        "Q: So the first \u2014 the first thought had not been to release all of \u2014 not \u2014 not allow\nanybody to leave the territory, but just grou \u2014 regroup and form a military unit.",
        "A: That\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what even the Poles wanted to do, because of what \u2014 they\nwanted to fight for Poland, you know, as when the Russians are \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 going to start pressing westward, they will part of the \u2014 of that system. But the\nRussians didn\u2019t trust them, because they were all anti-Soviet. Many of them had \u2014\nhad fought in the \u2014 in the war of 1920, when the Soviets started pushing into\nPoland, and were defeated, luckily. So \u2014 so the \u2014 all these troops were enemies.",
        "Q: And also the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, nobody knew about Katyn yet. Nobody knew at\nthat point.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No. Not \u2014 not yet.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No. And so \u2014 so the \u2014 the relationship was lukewarm at best. And I suppose they\nreally wanted to get rid of those people too, because there \u2014 there would \u2014 you\nknow, there would \u2014 th-they were like a \u2014 like \u2014 like a foreign organism within the\nsystem, you know, and th-there were \u2014 there were \u2014 y-you know \u2014 I \u2014 I remember\nthere\u2019s a little story that one of the units, I don\u2019t know which one it was, because I\nhad it \u2014 I heard a story about it. But they were being formed and a \u2014 and then local\npeople have come to \u2014 to this unit, and they said, do you \u2014 do you \u2014 do you play this\n\u2014 this hymn that \u2014 that is being played by \u2014 by the trumpet? And \u2014 and guy says\nwhat \u2014 oh, what a \u2014 what a di \u2014 this single trumpeteer sings this song, you know, di\n\u2014 plays this song. And all of a sudden this \u2014 this guy realizes that in the city of\nKrakow there is a \u2014 there is a\u2014 a church with a \u2014 with a spire on it. And in \u20141n 14\n\u2014 in 1200 some, when \u2014 when the Tartars and \u2014 and Turks s-started moving towards\nPoland, they came to that town. And the guy being at the top of the \u2014 of \u2014 of the \u2014\nof the tower, he saw it. And so he played th-the hymn to warn the city to close the\ngates and \u2014 and protect itself. And \u2014 which we did. And then \u2014 their \u2014 their attack\nwas repursed \u2014 repursed, and then they had to go back, and we chased them away.\nAnd \u2014 and they remembered this story being told over generations, because you\nJanuary 21, 2015\nknow, from \u2014 that if they hear that flo \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that hymn again, they will\nbecome free.",
        "Q: So the local people came to a Polish army unit \u2014",
        "A: To ask that they play this \u2014 this \u2014",
        "Q: Trumpet.",
        "A: \u2014 that they can be free \u2014 free. Well, of course it took another 50 years, but they \u2014\nthey\u2019re free now.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So these \u2014 these stories do happen and \u2014 and I \u2014 I had it in a book and I don\u2019t\nknow what happened with the book, but \u2014 but it was written, yeah.",
        "Q: And you heard it \u2014 and you heard it then, when you \u2014",
        "A: After we left.",
        "Q: After you left.",
        "A: After we left, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because it \u2014 you know, it would be written and all that kind of stuff. But can you\nimagine now, from 1200 something, to have it believe that something like that, if \u2014\nif this \u2014 this trumpet is played again in our town \u2014",
        "Q: We can \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 we\u2019 ll \u2014 we\u2019ll be free.",
        "Q: We can \u2014 we can [indecipherable] yeah. We can be free. Did you travel then,\nfrom this place to \u2014 by train, or by horse driven carriage, or \u2014",
        "A: No, we were \u2014 we were loaded on the train \u2014 because it was, you know, quite far\neast. So, together with the military we were loaded on trains, and we were then sent\nall the way to \u2014 to the Caspian Sea, to the par \u2014 port of Krasnovodsk.",
        "Q: Krasnovodsk.",
        "A: Mm-hm. And then we were loaded on the ship, and went south to the port of\nBaclevy(ph), which is already on \u2014 on the \u2014 on the Persian territory.",
        "Q: What do you remember on the ship crossing over?",
        "A: It was packed with people.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Just a \u2014 people were sitting on \u2014 on the \u2014 on the \u2014 not only all the \u2014 th-the \u2014 the \u2014\nin-inside the ship, but also on \u2014 on the decks. They\u2019re just packed the people wer \u2014\nas much as \u2014 as they could. So \u2014",
        "Q: Your mother and your \u2014 yourself were together?",
        "A: Yes, we were together. And it was \u2014 1-1t \u2014 it happened right before Easter of\n1942. So, the Easter of 1942, we celebrated as free people.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: So, when you left \u2014 so, in other words, it was like a \u2014 a two year saga. You had\nbeen deported on April 13\", 1940, and two years later you\u2019re on this boat, leaving\nthe Soviet Union.",
        "A: Right. Right.",
        "Q: Now, were you had been deported to, you know, that second place, were there\nothers that couldn\u2019t \u2014 that weren\u2019t free? I mean, was it only Polish deportees who\nwere \u2014 or deportees from Poland who were in this cattle breeding, or cattle herding\ntown, or were there deportees from other countries that were also there?",
        "A: No, just \u2014 just \u2014 just Poland.",
        "Q: So, all the Poles more or less left that place.",
        "A: Ay \u2014 ma \u2014 those that had the guts enough to say, we are going. But there were\nsome that had little, you know, a little \u2014 started little gardens and th-they put the\nvegetables on there, something like that. And some decided to stay. And out of over\na million and a half of people that were \u2014 that were deported to the Soviet Union\nduring the \u2014 at the time, only couple hundred thousand people have moved away.\nThe rest of them either died, or had to wait until 1953 to return to Poland.",
        "Q: Right, I see.",
        "A: Luckily, we were not one of them.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Okay, I wanted \u2014 thank you for filling that in, cause I wanted to get a sense of\nthe scope, and that\u2019s what you gave me right now, is that a million and a half people\nhad been deported from these eastern territories of Poland.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And only a couple of hundred thousand were able to leave. Now, did you have to\nhave a military connection in order to be able to leave the country? Because this\nwas \u2014 the whole purpose was to regroup, and \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I-\u2014TI think so. And this \u2014 and \u2014 and I think, luckily for us, because we were\nconsidered to be military family, just the same like \u2014 like this friend of mine,\nJanusz, we were able to leave.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Some of them probably not. I don\u2019t know all the stories, you know, how it \u2014 how\nit happened, but \u2014 but that\u2019s what happened to us.",
        "Q: Okay. And on this ship, did people feel like they could talk freely? Were they\ntalking all the time, were \u2014",
        "A: All the time. Well, you \u2014 you can imagine the stories that \u2014 that the people were\nsaying, and \u2014 and you know, then we\u2019re dropped in \u2014 in Baclevy(ph) in \u2014 in \u2014 on \u2014\non the shore, and the British had already the tents prepared. The camp \u2014 camp\nalready was being formed.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Was it the \u2014 excuse me, was it the Soviets who had \u2014 were commandeering the\nship, or was it \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It was a\u2014",
        "A: Oh, right, it was a Soviet ship, yes.",
        "Q: It was a Soviet ship \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and so Soviet officials?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And, did they treat you any differently now that you were, you know,\nleaving the country, or were they distant, or were they rude? What were they were\nlike?",
        "A: Oh yeah, they were always distant.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because you are afraid that if you get too close to someone, that someone, like I\ntold you about the son \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 may tell them that they are too friendly with us, for example, you know. So no,\nthey were \u2014 they were a distance away. They did their duties, whatever they were\nJanuary 21, 2015\ntold to do, they were doing. So they \u2014 they were to transport all this Polish cattle,\nthat was fine with them, and you know, they did their \u2014 their duties as a seamen.\nBut, you know, we were on the ship only, I think two or three days, so \u2014",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: \u2014 this is a shi \u2014 it\u2019s a short distance.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because Caspian Sea is a lake, huge lake, but it\u2019s called sea.",
        "Q: The Caspian Sea, yeah. So you\u2019re dropped on the shore in Baclevy(ph).",
        "A: We dropped on the shore in Baclevy(ph) and we spent Easter there, and \u2014 and\nthe first thing you \u2014 you had to do 1s to attend, or to go to \u2014 to be washed, and all\nyour things were to be given up, because lice was in everybody\u2019s clothing. And not\njust lice, hundreds of them. I remember one time sitting down and \u2014 and killing 200\nof them in one time. Just, ck, ck, ck, you know.",
        "Q: This was in the Soviet Union [indecipherable]",
        "A: This was Soviet Union. So that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s why we had to give up all our clothing,\nand they were just burned.",
        "Q: Well here \u2014 I didn\u2019t ask this before, but let me ask 1t now. You mentioned that\nwhen you were in the cattle car, in your first deportation, there was only a hole in\nthe ground for people to take care of their natural functions.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Were you ever able to take a shower? I mean, this 1s \u2014 it\u2019s such a naive question,\nbut I wondered.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Wer \u2014 no.",
        "A: No. No, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 you \u2014 you are being transported, you di \u2014 never knew\nwhen you\u2019re going \u2014 you know, you\u2019ve made a stop. Some people would go away,\nyou know, to find some, I don\u2019t know, food or something like that. They come back\nand they\u2019re \u2014 and they\u2019re \u2014 the train was gone. And that\u2019s why yo \u2014 a lot of families\nwere lost. That\u2019s why there were a lot of children that were without the parents,\nbecause either they died, or they simple \u2014 there were incidents like that, where the\nmother was left over, standing in the car, and you know, the train was gone. So, of\ncourse the \u2014 there was no time for washing.",
        "Q: So what about when you got to where \u2014 to the first place, the kolkhoz. Was there\n\u2014 was there \u2014 what were the hygienic facilities like there? Okay.",
        "A: There \u2014 there \u2014 there \u2014 there usually was always a banyo(ph) what they called,\nor bath, probably bath, you know, where you could take the shower. But taking\nshowers wasn\u2019t a weekly occurrence, you know, because they would be closed, and\nJanuary 21, 2015\n\u2014 or \u2014 or you were working, or something like that. So you \u2014 you just had to wash in\na little bowl.",
        "Q: A basin.",
        "A: Yeah, and that\u2019s the way it was, so basically the \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 we started being\ncivilized when we ended up in \u2014 in Baclevy(ph).",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We were cleaned up, issued new clothing, and we spend there, I think about two\nweeks. And then we were taken by \u2014 and my doggie, by the way, was with us all the\ntime. Tito was there. And so, in about two weeks, we were loading \u2014 loaded on a \u2014\non a trucks that were driven by the Iranians, and we were taken by these trucks, on a\nterrible road which was climbing all the \u2014 all over the mountains, across the\nmountains, and in \u2014 into the Teheran, which is located on \u2014 on the plains, on the \u2014\non the south side of the \u2014 of the range of mountains. And at that time, they were\nalready forming camps. And like in Teheran there were three civilian camps, and a\nmilitary camp. So we were in camp number two, and we stayed there for about two\nyears.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: Right, and by \u2014 my mother then found a job again as a \u2014 as part of a\u2014 ofa\nquartermaster of the \u2014 of the camp. So she was working in the camp, and right away\nJanuary 21, 2015\nthey reinstituted the schooling system. And the \u2014 the camp in which we were was\nactually an unfinished factory, tha \u2014 with number of buildings that were built by the\nGermans, because Germans had the very good relationship with the Iranians before\nthe war. And when the war broke out, th-the Russians, the British and the\nAmericans oc-occupied the country. Maybe it \u2014 it\u2019s strong wor-word to use, but\nthey moved their military forces \u2014",
        "Q: Into Iran.",
        "A: \u2014 into Iran to protect the \u2014 the oil fields, because they didn\u2019t want to give to the\nGermans. So, at that time, you know, we \u2014 all these three militaries were present in\n\u2014 in Teheran.",
        "Q: What about \u2014 I mean, how much interaction did \u2014 did you and your mother have\nwith any of the British authorities? Was there any interaction? Did they appear in\nyour lives at all, or \u2014",
        "A: No, th-there were \u2014 they \u2014 they had administration of the camp, was given to the\nPolish \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 administration. So the British were just on the outside, you know, and we did\nnot have anything to do with them.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: So, the hu \u2014 the people who were in the camp \u2014when you say you were there two\nyears, your \u2014 you\u2019re a child. In 1942 you\u2019re 11 years old, right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you stay there until you\u2019re 13 years old. Now \u2014 approximately.",
        "A: Appr \u2014 right.",
        "Q: What happened to \u2014 on that boat coming over, there must have been fighting age\nyoung men. I mean, the whole purpose of releasing people from \u2014 from the Soviet\nUnion, was to be able to form these military units. What happened to them, where\ndid they go?",
        "A: All \u2014 all \u2014 all the young men that \u2014 that were in the \u2014 in the military age, they\nwere taken into the army, or the \u2014 they volunteered for the army. And they were\nmoved to Iraq. So the Polish military training bases were formed in Iraq. And not\nonly that, but they were also used to protect the airf \u2014 th-the oil fields in Iraq. So\nthey \u2014 they were there until 1943, I think. And then they w \u2014 they were moved to\nEgypt, and from Egypt were the second front bes \u2014 being opened in Italy, was\nbeing invaded by the allied forces. They participated in \u2014 in that campaign.",
        "Q: So who \u2014 when you were in this camp in Teheran for those two years, who were\nthe other people in the camp with you? What kind of people were they? Children?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No, there were a lot of children, and of course, as I said before, there were a lot\nof orphans, an-and this \u2014 this \u2014 th-the \u2014 the camps in \u2014 in Teheran were transitory\ncamps. So the people from there were being transported everywhere: to \u2014 to Africa,\nto India, to Mexico. So there were \u2014 as the people were coming in, so were people\nwere leaving all the time, so \u2014",
        "Q: So if you were a child, or you were just, you know, a \u2014 a young family, I would\ntake it they were not military people, cause the military guys, I mean, the young\nmen were in different places \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 they were somewhere else.",
        "A: Right. They \u2014 so they all \u2014 this \u2014 so camp number \u2014 camp number one was the\nmili \u2014 no, camp number four was the military camp. But it was very small camp,\nbecause this was also a transitory camp. And so wi \u2014 whoe \u2014 whatever unit came in\nfrom \u2014 from the Soviet Union, they were just processed and moved to where the\ntraining actually had to start, because they had to retrain. Many of them were\nyoung, and th-they didn\u2019t have any service. So they were do \u2014",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 in \u2014 back in Dolina(ph), right?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Right, right. Except now they are \u2014 they are not 14 - 17, they were \u2014 they were,\nyou know, ready to go into the military.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so these units were trained until 1943, I think, where they were then made\nready for \u2014 for military service.",
        "Q: Were there any transports that came after you, from the Soviet Union that is \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, yes \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 their ka \u2014 they kept coming, and so my mother would \u2014 would receive those\nthen, and put them in the different places where they had \u2014 they \u2014 not all of them\ncould live in those buildings, and so there were also tents, that the British had given\nus. And so there were \u2014 there \u2014 there was a kitchen and, you know, the \u2014 everybody\nwas being fed from the \u2014 the kitchen, and there were the facilities. American gifts\nwere coming, because at the time a lot of people were donating things. So our\nclothing was \u2014 was American clothing, because that\u2019s what we have gotten from \u2014\nfrom them. And as I mentioned to \u2014 then we started school. And there were \u2014 there\nwere no books, so every had \u2014 everything had to be written. You had to remember\nfrom what \u2014 what the teacher was telling you.",
        "Q: Wow.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Because we had no books. But \u2014 but \u2014",
        "Q: Did you show your certificate from the first grade?",
        "A: No. But they also formed scouting organizations in the \u2014 and I jon \u2014 joined the\nscouting. And, so actually, normal life.",
        "Q: I mean, from your description of it, my impression is that it sounds to me, if you\ntake away all of the uncertainty of life, and knowing that this 1s transitory, and that\nit will end \u2014 it also sounds like a wonderful place to not be alone, that there will be\npeople there, that you \u2014 you can talk to them, that you could meet other kids, that\nyou could make friends, that \u2014 you know \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, you know, yes. And \u2014 and on \u2014 in so \u2014 but we had, you know, we \u2014 of\ncourse we\u2019re free to go, so we could go to town. And since my mother started\nworking we had some, you know, some of money, and we were able to go to town.\nAnd the \u2014 the Persians, who are very friendly \u2014 nothing like happens right now \u2014\nand so we \u2014 we really started living a normal life. We went to movies, American\nmovies that were being played at \u2014 at that time. And it lasted until about 1943,\nsomething like that, and then they started liquidating the camps because all the\npeople were moved away to different \u2014 different locations. And my mother then\nreceived a \u2014 a proposal to go into town and work for the Polish unit that was taking\ncare of the \u2014 of the refugees and things. And so we moved into the city of Teheran.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nWe rented actually, an apartment \u2014 a \u2014 a room 1n the \u2014 in a \u2014 in Teheran itself, and\nmy mother was working and I started to go \u2014 and I was going to school, and \u2014",
        "Q: Still a Polish school.",
        "A: \u2014to a Polish school. And we lived not too far away from another friend of ours\nthat is right now in San Francisco, and we had great time, because \u2014 because we\nwere \u2014 the \u2014 the camp in which actually the sc \u2014 because the \u2014 they kept liquidating\nthe schools, and finally ne \u2014 and \u2014 and that was camp number three. And that was\nlocated in the mountains, very beautiful area. And we\u2019d have a bus that would take\nus there, and in the evening we would be driven back again. And so I went through\n\u2014 through the grade school, and in \u2014 in 1945, when we moved to 1 \u2014 to Lebanon, I\nwas already in first grade of high school.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: As 13 -14 \u2014 well, right on \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, 13 - 14\u2014-",
        "Q: \u2014 right on schedule.",
        "A: Right. Right on schedule, I was 14. And so I remember that, you know, we had \u2014\nwe had great time, because several of us lived in \u2014 in a city by then, and we c \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015\ncould get together, go to the movies, and \u2014 and you know, and visit the bazaars, and\n\u2014and really had great time.",
        "Q: It sounds like exotic, and adventurous, right?",
        "A: Absolutely, yeah, show my \u2014 my [indecipherable]. But absolutely adventurous,\nbecause we were \u2014 we were taken one time to visit the Shah\u2019s palace.",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "A: And I also remember that we were returning one time, and I don\u2019t know what \u2014\nhow \u2014 how was it, but we decided to walk. It wasn\u2019t that far away, so we were\nwalking on \u2014 on the road towards Teheran, and here comes the Shah. So we waved,\nyou know, and all that stuff, and he \u2014",
        "Q: Was he in a motorcade?",
        "A: Yes, in \u2014 in a limousine, you know, motorcades and all that kind stuff. So \u2014 and\nhe must have realized that \u2014 who we are, because he wa \u2014 you know, waved back.\nSo, you know, he \u2014 then \u2014 then we absolutely felt like free people. A-And our \u2014 our\n\u2014 our wrong [indecipherable] was over. And so \u2014 so \u2014 you know, then, towards the\nend of \u2014 almost at the end of the war, in July of 1945, because everything was being\nliquidated and, you know, the British and the Americans were going to move out of\nthere too, we were taken by train to Baghdad in Iraq. And there we had to stay for\n100January 21, 2015\ntwo weeks because something happened with our visa, transitory visa through \u2014\nthrough one of the countries.",
        "Q: So this is from Teheran to Baghdad.",
        "A: To Baghdad.",
        "Q: And then after that, Lebanon?",
        "A: And then from \u2014 from Baghdad we went to Lebanon, and we went in \u2014 in\nbuses, all the way to \u2014 to Beirut.",
        "Q: How long did that take?",
        "A: A couple days. It was \u2014 it was quite the trip.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you saw through the buses, and what kind of landscape \u2014",
        "A: Sand and sand and sand. It was a real desert. Until we came to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nLebanon. And Lebanon 1s \u2014 1s beautiful. It\u2019s green, you know, the \u2014 the mountains\nare \u2014 are beautiful, and so it was completely different land \u2014 you know, landscape\nonce we entered the territory of Lebanon. So from \u2014 from bay \u2014 from Baghdad I\nremember that we had an opportunity to visit the \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the\nmarketplaces, the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, and it was \u2014 it was really quite an experience,\nand I \u2014 I don\u2019t know where I have it, but I bought myself a \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 one of these\nknifes, you know, that you \u2014",

        "A: Yes, the curved knife, I still have it. So \u2014",
        "Q: Was this a \u2014 all of these journeys, from Teheran to Baghdad to now Beirut,\nthis was all under the aegis of Polish authorities, and they in turn were under the\naegis of the British authorities?",
        "A: No, this was already beginning of the international ref-refugee organization.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because that was the end of the war, and all of a sudden they had refugees all\nover Europe, so they formed this international refugee organization, and they took\nover the administration.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So, once we moved to \u2014 to Beirut, and we stayed couple \u2014 couple weeks in \u2014 in\na transitory camp in Beirut itself, and then we were moved to a small town called\nGhazir(ph), just north of \u2014 of Beirut, in the mountains. And at that time we were\ngiven some substis \u2014 subsistence money so we could go on our own. So we became\nself-sufficient, and we had to supply ourselves with food and \u2014 and \u2014 and, you\nknow, and clothing and \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and in Lebanon, the \u2014 one of the \u2014 as I understand, one of the agreements\nwith the Lebanese government was that the people that are coming in are not going\nto become part of the economy of the \u2014 of Lebanon. But they are \u2014 they are going\nto be self-sufficient. So \u2014 so that\u2019s we \u2014 that\u2019s why we are needing the subsistence,\nSO we can live on our own.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay there?",
        "A: Until 1950.",
        "Q: Oh, you were there for five years?",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Also in Lebanon.",
        "A: Right, but it \u2014 this was \u2014 this wa \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 after people started leaving there,\ntoo, they started liquidating different camps, and so we had to move from Ghazir,\nwhich is in the mountains, to Zouk(ph), which was on the bay. And so this is 1948,\nplus two years, 1950.",
        "Q: So, in \u2014 when you lived in these places, were you also in an enclosed\ncommunity, or did you live in town, having your own rooms, or \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, we had \u2014 we \u2014 yes, we rented rooms. So we were really on our own.",
        "Q: Were there many Polish people there?\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes, well, en-enough to \u2014 to form several schools. Like there was one in \u2014 in\nGhazir, there was one in Zouk and there was one in \u2014 1n the mountains on the other\nside of Beirut. And t-then they started liquidating, and everything was then put into\n\u2014into Zouk.",
        "Q: Did you also have much contact with local people? Lebanese?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes, you know, I \u2014 in a way that th-they were friendly people, and th-\nthey were \u2014 they were really amazingly capable of learning languages, because you\nknow, they had a long history of being traders. And so this \u2014 so this became a\nnatural with them. So most of the people that had any \u2014 any shops in like \u2014 in\nGhazir, they s \u2014 they spoke adequate Polish to tell you that, for example, they\nwould c-call, pig missus, pig missus. It wasn\u2019t that the missus was a pig, but they\nkilled the pig, and they were selling the meat. So \u2014 so \u2014 but \u2014 but they were very,\nvery nice, very polite, and a friend of mine who lives in Australia was telling me\nyears later that she moved to Australia and \u2014 and she met a \u2014 an Arab from \u2014 from\nGhazir. And so she \u2014 the \u2014 he emigrated after her, and they got married in \u2014 in\nAustralia. And then years later, in \u2014 in 1980s or something like that, the three\nsisters that \u2014 that lived there decided to make a round world trip. And they went\nfrom \u2014 they went from Australia, first stop was Lebanon. And they were walking\non the streets of this town of Ghazir and an Arab comes to them, and of course they\n106January 21, 2015\nla \u2014 they look different. And so the \u2014 he says, what are you ladies doing in here?\nAnd my friend says, well, I\u2019m the wife of, you know, this \u2014 this [indecipherable]\nyou know, we are Polish, we lived here. Oh, you are Polish. So you \u2014 stands at\nattention, and starts singing Polish national anthem.",
        "Q: Oh good God.",
        "A: He remembered, all these years. So they are \u2014 they\u2019re really fantastic people.\nAnd \u2014 you know, and we never, never had anything that we would be afraid of. We\nlived among them, being scout, we \u2014 we went on \u2014 on the trips, you know, just\nwalking trips around Lebanon, and we never had any problem at all.",
        "Q: Did you ever pick up the local language?",
        "A: Some. Yo-You know enough to kind of get \u2014 get along it, and \u2014 but of course,\nover the years of not using it, it \u2014 it \u2014 it just disappears. I just remember Leban \u2014\nLebanese national anthem.",
        "Q: You remember \u2014 so if you were to walk around, you\u2019d be able to sing it.",
        "A: But \u2014 but you know, it \u2014 they were really very friendly people and they were \u2014\nafter the first World War they were under what they called French protectorate. So\nall \u2014 almost everyone spoke French. There was also American university in \u2014 1n \u20141n\npa \u2014 in \u2014 in \u20141n Beirut, and some of our older members of the school went to study\nin there, and \u2014 but then, you know, towards the \u2014 the 1950 \u2014\n107\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: What did your mother do for the five years? How did she support herself?",
        "A: Well, she was \u2014 she \u2014 you know, we were \u2014 we were given the money, but she\nstarted working for, you know, with the school, doing all kinds of things, being able\nto paint, you know, she would \u2014 she would take care, and she was really taking care\nof like a \u2014 like a club for children, and they were dancing, and things like that. So\nshe was busy all the time. You know, she \u2014 she had things to do.",
        "Q: Did you ever see her, in all of those years, those 10 years, did you ever see her\ndespair?",
        "A: No. I think after you go through something like that, you could have done all the\ndesperation in two years. The rest of it was a wonderful life, basically. You know,\nof course you didn\u2019t know anything about your husband, you were lonely, no\nfamily, and \u2014 but there are people like you that became, you know, part of your\ncircle. And so she never despaired, and \u2014 and | think she \u2014 she was \u2014 she was too\nbusy to \u2014 to think. And then besides, she could \u2014 she could, you know, embroider,\nso she would embroider. She wrote poems, which \u2014 which I have, you know. And\nso she was quite a positive type of person. So \u2014 so anyway, so after \u2014 after all this\nwas done and \u2014 and told her that \u2014 that they were trying to relocate the people as\nsoon as possible so they can start normal life, because this was not a normal life.",
        "Q: Right.\n108\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: So finally in \u2014 1n a \u2014 in 1950, towards the \u2014 the end of 1950, in July in fact, Her\nMajesty the queen decided to accept us as \u2014 as being capable of going to the\nterritory of the \u2014 of Great Britain.",
        "Q: Had you been trying for a long time? Had your mother been trying?",
        "A: No, no, this was all done between the Polish government and the British. They \u2014\nthey realized that they have to remove those people from Lebanon because they\nhad \u2014 they had an agreement that they won\u2019t work. So what do you \u2014",
        "Q: Well that can\u2019t happen forever.",
        "A: No, that can\u2019t happen forever. So they decided that the best way is to simply\nbring them to \u2014 to real life. Really real life, not what we have for life for the last\nnumber of years. So, we were load \u2014 loaded on the shi \u2014 on the military ship.

        "Q: Did you speak any English at that point?",
        "A: Yes. Oh, by the way, I\u20141I\u2014 we did learn English in Lebanon. We had the\nLebanese professor who was teaching us. So I-I \u2014 I cannot say I was fluent, but I\nwas capable of communicating quite well \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: \u20141n\u20141n English. Not with a British accent, of course, but \u2014 but nevertheless,\nenough to be able to move about England with no problem. And so, when I moved\nto London, I was with Rilka(ph) for a little while, and then she arranged for me to\ngo to a youth hostel, and I was working in a youth hostel. So I started looking for\njob and \u2014 and the \u2014 the guy said, well, there\u2019s something that you can \u2014 you can do,\nthere is some factory that you can go in. So I went for an interview and the\ngentleman that was interviewing me, he said, what do you want to do in life? And I\nsaid, what \u2014 I would like to be an engineer. And he says, oh, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m looking\nfor a worker, not for an engineer. So \u2014",
        "Q: So it sounds like it was a trick question.",
        "A: I suppose. But \u2014 so I was \u2014 I was \u2014 I had to go back, and they said, you know,\nthere is \u2014 there is a \u2014 an office of a \u2014 of a\u2014 a Polish American, who was born in \u2014 in\nUnited States, but was educated in Poland. He became an engineer, and he worked\nin the Polish corps of engineer in \u2014 when \u2014 during the campaign in \u2014 in Italy, and\nthere he met a British engineer who was working for the British corps of engineers,\nand they formed fre \u2014 friendship, and they decided that they liked each other so\nmuch that ti \u2014 after \u2014 after the war, they opened an office. And that office was to\nconvert many of the residences of London into flats.",
        "Q: Oh wow.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: So they were doing this kind of work, and when I \u2014 when I went for an\ninterview, the gentleman said yes \u2014 and because I \u2014 and when I graduated from high\nschool, there was an Polish engineer who taught the boys the drafting. So I knew\nabout eng-engineering drawings, I knew about drafting, I know about, you know,\nthings. And so he gave me the opportunity to work for them, as my first engineering\njob.",
        "Q: Oh, how wonderful.",
        "A: And it was really fantastic, because, you know \u2014 but my mother told me in the\nbeginning of my career that, just remember to \u2014 when you work for someone, take a\nletter of recommendation from the person. And so they \u2014 so I\u2014 when I was in\nLondon mat \u2014 from \u2014 I think from September or something like that, and we left for\nthe United States in the beginning of February \u2014",
        "Q: Which year?",
        "A: \u2014 of 1951. So we were in England only several months. And what happened is\nthat my mother had ta \u2014 three uncles. My \u2014 my grandmother came from a family of\n12.",
        "Q: See, I hadn't that far \u2014 back enough, when I was asking you about your parents,\nyour grandparents and so on, I didn\u2019t ask how many children were in those families,\nor that generation.\n112\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s my \u2014 my grandmother had \u2014 had 11 siblings.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: And \u2014 and three of those siblings, all boys, escaped to the United States in \u2014\nbefore the beginning of the second war \u2014 or the first World War. Because, when\nyou are drafted into the Russian army, your career lasted 25 years, so all your life,\nbasically. And so they didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to do that, and these \u2014 they \u2014 they came to\nthe United States, and one of them settled in Baltimore, and the other one settled\nin \u2014 in Ohio, and the third one somewhere in Ohio also. And when we \u2014 when we\nleft Russia, my mother somehow reestablished contact with him, and \u2014 Uncle\nMiczestaw(ph) and he asked her, couple years later, if we would be wanting maybe\nto emigrate to the United States, and my mother said yes. But in those days, they \u2014\nthey had the visa \u2014 no-not the visa, but they had like every nationality had a number\nof places assigned.",
        "Q: A quota.",
        "A: A quota.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so she \u2014 the Polish quota was always, you know, taken up. So we just\nsimply waiting all this period, from, you know, we \u2014 we started doing this in\nTeheran, and he had to write the affidavits and all that kind of stuff \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s like six or seven years.",
        "A: Yes, and it still would have taken longer time, but the American government had\npassed a special law that permitted 18,000 military families to come to the United\nStates for set \u2014",
        "Q: Polish military families.",
        "A: Right, from \u2014 from the second Polish corps, to \u2014 to [indecipherable] units to \u2014\nto immigrate to the United States. And si \u2014 again, since my father was counted as a\nmilitary, we were given the opportunity \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me to interrupting here, but you \u2014 I \u2014 I take it that your mother didn\u2019t\nhave many documents with her. Did she have a document that said that her \u2014 that\nyour father was in the military, or were there other ways they could substantiate\nthat?",
        "A: No, she \u2014 there was \u2014 there was something that yes, she \u2014 she had the\nsubstantiation. Cause we \u2014 we do have some documents of \u2014 of my father, and I \u2014\nsee the \u2014 here\u2019s the \u2014 the \u2014 the certificate, he graduated from the \u2014 from the officers\u2019\nschool.\n114\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: If you could hold that up just a little bit like that. Can you zero in on it? Yeah,\ngot it? Okay. Okay, thank you.",
        "A: You know, so \u2014",
        "Q: So she had documentation.",
        "A: So, she had the documentation and you know, several other things that \u2014 that she\nhad, you know, so she could prove that my father was \u2014 was in the military. And so\nwe were \u2014 we were granted the visa, as part of the 18,000 permissions. And so on \u2014\non February \u2014 beginning of February, we were loaded onto one of Her Majesty\u2019s\nships, and shipped from Liverpool to London \u2014 to \u2014 to New York. So the trip\nlasted, I think about 14 days or something like that. So we arrived in New York on\nFebruary 14\" \u2014",
        "Q: Nineteen \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Valentine\u2019s Day, and everybody was, you know, saying, oh, Happy\nValentine, and we didn\u2019t know what \u2014",
        "Q: What it was.",
        "A: So it was. But we learned. And my \u2014 my \u2014 my mother\u2019s uncle\u2019s wife had family\nin \u20141n New York. So they came out to take us from the ship. And I still have a\nbusiness card of the cousin, that he showed them to \u2014 so he took us \u2014 he took us to\nhis home, and we stayed in New York for several days. And \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: Do you remember \u2014 do you remember any first impressions?",
        "A: Yeah, I remember Statue of Liberty.",
        "Q: You do? Yeah. So you went through Ellis Island?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t, we \u2014 I don\u2019t know why, maybe because we came from England\nor something, but we were \u2014 the re \u2014 released directly into his care.",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: And so he took us from the \u2014 from the \u2014",
        "Q: Pier.",
        "A: \u2014 pier, he took us to \u2014 to his house.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And permitted us to kind of release a little bit after the \u2014 after the trip. And then\nloaded us on the \u2014 on the train and shipped us to Ohio.",
        "Q: To Ohio, so you didn\u2019t even go to Baltimore?",
        "A: No. No, we went directly to Ohio, and my uncle picked us up at the train station\nin \u2014 across the border for \u2014 in \u2014 1n Pittsburgh.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: In Pittsburgh, and then he took us bri \u2014 by car to his house, and we st \u2014 we were\nstaying with them. Unfortunately, the first experience was not the most satisfactory,\nbecause after about four months \u2014 and I started working in \u2014 in ice cream factory, I\nwas making the Popsicles. But this was my \u2014 my first job. And after about four\nmonths, my uncle called my mother and he says, you know, my wife, your aunt, and\nyou just don\u2019t seem to be getting too well together. So, he says, you know, you \u2014\nyou have to leave.",
        "Q: Oh dear. Oh dear.",
        "A: So, we started looking for a place, you know, since I was already employed. We\nstarted looking for a place, but then my mother decided to call the uncle that lives in\n\u2014 lived in Baltimore, and maybe they could just take us for, you know\n[indecipherable] four months, you know, just a new country, everything \u2014 so wi \u2014\nthe cousin came in and she looked us over, and she decided we\u2019re okay, and so \u2014",
        "Q: That must have been hard.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: That must have been hard.",
        "A: Well, ya \u2014 hey, once you go through \u2014",
        "Q: Go through Siberia, right.",
        "A: \u2014 hell, it\u2019s \u2014 nothing.\n117\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "Q: I know. Okay, fine, okay.",
        "A: And so, w-we moved to Baltimore, and we stayed with them, I think about a\nmonth maybe, maybe less. And my \u2014 my cousin says, you know, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhat to do with you, you know, wh-what am I do \u2014 we don\u2019t even know how to\nhelp you completely two different worlds.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know. And so she says, but you know, but there is \u2014 there is a Polish priest\nthat went through German concentration camp. He is working 1n the parish right\nhere. Maybe we take you there, and maybe you can \u2014 maybe you can find a better\ncommunication with him, maybe he can help you better than \u2014 than I. So she took\nus \u2014 she took me there, and we \u2014 I met the priest.",
        "Q: Do you remember whos \u2014 what his name was?",
        "A: I have it written down somewhere, but I \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014\nA2: Fillipovich(ph).",
        "A: Oh, Father Fillipovich(ph).\nA2: Father Fillipovich(ph). [indecipherable]",
        "A: Fillipovich(ph). He was \u2014 he was really \u2014 you know, he went through different\nkind of [indecipherable].",
        "Q: Right.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And so he understood. And he said, you know, since you were working as a\ndraftsman, we are \u2014 we are running a \u2014 a bazaar here, you know, and there is a\ngentleman that \u2014 that works for Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Maybe he can help\nyou. So the next day I\u2014 I came in and he to \u2014 introduced me to the guy, and the guy\nsays well \u2014 he was \u2014 he was Polish, second generation, I think, but he spoke Polish\nand he says well, let me see if there is something I can do. And so he gave me the\naddress. The next day I went by train or something to what they call the Sparrows\nPoint. Sparrows Point was where they had the shipyards, and \u2014 and the \u2014 the \u2014 you\nknow, regular steel company thing. And so I \u2014 I \u2014 I talked to the \u2014 to the gentleman\nthat was in charge of engineering office. I showed him my document from \u2014 from\nEngland.",
        "Q: Your letter of recommendation.",
        "A: My letter of recommendation. And the next day they \u2014 the fellow says, you\nknow, you can \u2014 you can come and start working. So \u2014 so within couple days I \u2014 I\nwas already employed [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What a relief.",
        "A: \u2014 in what I wanted to do, you know, so it just fantastic. And when I \u2014 when I\ncame back, my aunt says, your mother isn\u2019t here any more. She rented an apartment\nJanuary 21, 2015\nand she \u2014 she\u2019s waiting for you with \u2014 with supper, so you better go over there. So I\n\u2014 from that point on we were \u2014",
        "Q: On your own.",
        "A: \u2014 on \u2014 independent, on our own. Which was, of course, the best thing that could\nhappen to anyone. We \u2014 we kept a very good relationship with \u2014 with \u2014 with the\nuncle. And so I still maintain a relationship with \u2014 with his grandchildren, you\nknow, talk to each other and things. And I \u2014 and I started working at Sparrows\nPoint of the Bethlehe-Bethlehem Steel Corporation. And had a fantastic\nexperience, because you know, it\u2019s something that \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s what you wanted to do.",
        "A: \u2014 some \u2014 wanted to do, I wanted to do the engineering. And so, soon as possible,\nI \u2014I signed up for the civil engineering studies, the evening of course, at Johns\nHopkins University in Baltimore. So I\u2019d work, come back from work, go to\nschool. And I completed quite a number of courses, and then in 19 \u2014 middle \u2014\ntowards the end of 1954, I got the papers from U.S. military that I\u2019m being drafted.",
        "Q: Were you a citizen yet?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s another story.\n120January 21, 2015",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, I was finally drafted in the beginning of 1955, and after \u2014 after the basic\ntraining of eight weeks, our regiment was shipped to Germany. Because at that\ntime, the regiment that was there \u2014 and it was \u2014 they had the \u2014 the duties of \u2014 of \u2014 of\n\u2014 of watching the border.",
        "Q: East-west border?",
        "A: East-west border, yes. And that regiment stayed there as \u2014 as \u2014 regiment as a,\nyou know, unit, all the time from the be \u2014 the end of the war until 1955, beginning.\nAnd then they decided to exchange the units, move second regiment back to sh \u2014 to\n\u2014 to the United States, and us, as a whole regiment, ship over there. So we were\nshipped as a regiment to Germany. And since I got the job as a \u2014 as a regimental\ndraftsman, of course, I was in a headquarters of the regiment in \u2014 in Nuremberg,\nwhereas the \u2014 the battalions were sh \u2014 were s-stationed around the border. So it was\n\u2014 it was interesting because it was different kinds of draftsmanship.",
        "Q: What were you doing?",
        "A: Doing military plans when they they were doing their, you know, their exercises,\nI had to \u2014 to \u2014 to document where they\u2019re going to be, and what time, and what\nunits and all that kind of stuff. It got to be [indecipherable]. So I worked \u2014 I was\nworking there. And I remember one \u2014 one time, the sergeant of \u2014 of the S-2 section,\nJanuary 21, 2015\nwhich is the intelligence section, comes to \u2014 to \u2014 to the room that I was occupying,\nand he looks at me, and he looks at \u2014 at the \u2014 the plans that I am working on, and he\nsays, are you a U.S. citizen? And I said no. So he said, oh my God. He runs to the\ncolonel, tells him the story, and the colonel does whatever necessary, and within\ntwo weeks, I was shipped to Frankfurt, Germany, where the American consulate\nwas, with two sergeants that swore that they knew me since.",
        "Q: And they had never seen you before, huh?",
        "A: No. And I was given the U.S. citizenship. So \u2014 so \u2014 so when I came back from\nthe army, I was, you know, I was already \u2014",
        "Q: A USS. citizen.",
        "A: \u2014 a registered citizen. And \u2014 and it really helped me quite a bit because sometime\nlater the same sergeant comes in and he says, do you speak a little Russian? And I\nsaid yes, I do. And he says, oh, would you like to go to a refresher course in\nRussia\u2019? And I say yes, of course. So I was shipped, for three weeks of Russian\nrefresher course, in Oberammergau, Germany, and you probably know\nOberammergau is a place where every 10 years they give the \u2014 the Easter thing.",
        "Q: The Passion Play.",
        "A: Passion Play.",
        "Q: Yeah.\n122January 21, 2015",
        "A: And it is a beautiful, beautiful town where everybody there is a sculptor. They\nsculpt, you know, in wood. So I spent three weeks with \u2014 with the military\nintelligence refresher course. And it was amazing experience for me because the \u2014\nthe people that were with me, they were from \u2014 you know, from private through\nmajor.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And all of them went through the army school of languages, and they want \u2014 an-\nand you know all these people were going \u2014 if necessary were going to be used as\ninterrogators of the prisoners of war. So their basic Russian was based on the\nmilitary requirements, you know, in other words, what \u2014 what do you ask, you\nknow \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 and all that kind of stuff. So they \u2014 they had to maintain their skill. So they\nwere there and the first few days, you know, they were way ahead of me. And then,\nall of a sudden, s-s-started clicking, you know.",
        "Q: Your first grade.",
        "A: My first grade started clicking back. And by the time we were e \u2014 we were\nfinished, I was way ahead of them, because my pronunciation was [indecipherable]\nbetter than th-theirs. And \u2014 and you know, I had the opportunity to \u2014 to visit that\n123January 21, 2015\nwonderful place, and I \u2014 since they were doing all these kind of things that my\nmother always told \u2014 told me that, you have to have, in your house, you have to\nhave a picture of Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so I had that remembrance, so I went to one of the sculptors, and I said, did\nyou ever make the sculpture of Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus? And he says, no,\nbut that\u2019s interesting. He says, come, come, come, come. So he took me to his \u2014 to\nhis workplace, and he starts pulling out the books, trying to figure out, you know.\nAnd he finds a \u2014 a picture of lady \u2014 Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus. And he says,\nyou know, Pll \u2014PIl\u2014TIl put you on rock \u2014 o-on the rock and \u2014 and\n[indecipherable] this, and she\u2019s going to be feeding baby Jesus. Is that \u2014 is that\nwhat you want? Excuse me, ca-can you sneak out and go and get that sculpture?",
        "Q: Can you cut the panel, please? [break] And so, what\u2019s that?",
        "A: So this 1s the \u2014 this is the sculpture that he made.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.",
        "A: And \u2014 and th-there are only two of those like that. One painted, and the other one\njust as in wood. And he sent me both, to \u2014 to the \u2014 to \u2014 to Nuremberg, and he says,\nwhich one do you want? And I bought both, and the other one I send to my cousin\nin Poland. So they have that.\n124January 21, 2015",
        "Q: Oh, my gosh.",
        "A: But \u2014 but all \u2014 you know, the only thing that he showed me was this po \u2014 upper\npart. And the rest of it, with her putting her li \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: [indecipherable] on doing \u2014 and doing, that was all she \u2014 all his interpretation.\nAnd so, this 1s what \u2014 what I remember from Oberammergau.",
        "Q: From Oberammergau. Well, thank you for sharing that. That \u2014 did you explain\nto the people where you were taking the Russian refresher course that \u2014 how you\ncame to know Russian to begin with?",
        "A: Yes. But, you know, that \u2014 basically, you know, I \u2014 I found out that most\nAmericans are not interested in that, because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s so far away from their\nbackground, from their pe \u2014 that you s-simply do not understand, that how in the\nheck \u2014 excuse me \u2014 my English \u2014 you can come to somebody\u2019s home at two o\u2019clock\nin the morning and take him away, and leave everything \u2014 you know, you leave\neverything behind. It was just in \u2014 incomprehensible. And so there \u2014 they were not\ninterested. And so therefore, you know, I just kept it to myself, and I don\u2019t have\nanything against it, because it is so different. You know, how do you explain to \u2014 to\npeople that never experienced any kind of a \u2014 of [indecipherable] with authorities,\nthat somebody can come to your house at two o\u2019clock in the morning and take you\nJanuary 21, 2015\naway, leave all your things behind, and, you know. But \u2014 but I explained to \u2014 to this\n\u2014 to these guys, and they accepted what it was.",
        "Q: Was there a reason why they would have wanted you to take this Russian\nrefresher course? Did they have anything in mind for you?",
        "A: Well, because I was wer \u2014 working for the regiment.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the regiment was on the border, so they needed people that were familiar\nwith the language, just in case \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 1f some \u2014 something should happen, each unit had a translator that could\ninterrogate the people. And here\u2019s a guy that not only that experienced being there \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 and knowing the people. And so I was very grateful. But then I suffered some\n\u2014 somehow, later on, because whenever we would go to Canada, and I take my\ncitizenship papers with me, I was always stopped on the border, and I \u2014 and there\nwas also a telephone call made to Washington, because my \u2014 my paper, my \u2014 my\ncitizenship paper is not the normal thing. It does not have my photograph, it does\nnot have sig \u2014 signature of \u2014 of \u2014 of a judge. It has a signature of Consul General of\nthe United States and Frankfurt, Germany, and it just doesn\u2019t sound normal. So \u2014\n126January 21, 2015",

        "A: So, you know, a-all these experiences add up to \u2014 to a\u2014 I would say a rather\ninteresting life, if you want to call it that way. And then, when I was drafted into the\narmy, I decided to move my mother to Chicago, because here we \u2014 we have many\nmore friends and people that we \u2014 acquaintances that we had from the past. And so\nI moved her, and then I went back and was drafted. And when I was released I came\nback, and I restarted my studies at Illinois Institute of Technology, and I started\nworking as a draftsman for engineering firms. And my first firm of employment\nwas a fi \u2014 was a firm of \u2014 in \u2014 in which our chief engineer was Lithuanian. And\nmost of the draftsmen were lith \u2014 were Lithuanians.

And of course, the Anders\u2019\nArmy was a traitor. So \u2014 but it was \u2014 it was, you know, an interesting experience,\nbecause I already had something to show. That not only that I did get the document\nfrom \u2014 from the army that I worked as a draftsman, so \u2014 and when I \u2014 when I came\nto the \u2014 to \u2014 to Chicago, I started working for several firms, and the wa \u2014 and again\nfor U.S. Steel Corporation, because th \u2014 I was already with experience from \u2014\nfrom \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 from Baltimore, from Bethlehem Steel. And I worked in different engineering\nfirms until 1978.

And so I went for an interview, and because my background was civil\nengineering, and it was also in \u2014 in \u2014 1n dams, because the last firm that I was\nworking for was a firm of Dr. Bauer(ph), who had, you know, his doctorate in\n128January 21, 2015\nhydraulics, and so I worked on \u2014 on things. And so I was accepted. And so in 1978\nuntil 2008, for 30 years, I worked for U.S. un-unit.

You\nknow, but there are hundreds of dams that are run not only by the Corps of\nEngineers, but also by private industry, where they have, you know, hydraulic\nfacilities. And because they \u2014 they are using the waters of the United States, they\nare obligated to take a license and to fulfill the requirements, and we would go and\nvisit and see if everything is okay, and if not, we would write down what we find\nthat is \u2014 needs to be repaired, and they were obligated to do that. So, it was \u2014 it was",
        "Q: Sounds like an interesting \u2014 interesting job.",
        "A: Oh \u2014 oh, it was \u2014 it was very interesting, and you never get tired, because you\nknow, a dam is a dam and a\u2014 a\u2014 and a plant 1s a plant. No, it\u2019s not.

And most of them were to\nliquidate people that were undesirables, which was Poles, and the Jews, and there\nwas \u2014 there was a story about this transport that was being taken in one of the\ncamps, and the people were led into the camp, and there was a \u2014 a Jewish mother,\nand four or five year old little boy. And they were walking in and \u2014 and at the gate\nstands the \u2014 the Gestapo officer, dressed up in beautiful uniform, with the ha \u2014 with\nthe hat and \u2014 and the long boots, and \u2014 and \u2014 and the [indecipherable] you know,\n140January 21, 2015\nthat he was kind of hitting his \u2014 his leg with it. And he was \u2014 for the boy it was \u2014 it\nwas a marvelous, wonderful figure. So the boy just pulls away from his \u2014 from his\nmother\u2019s hand and runs to the officer and offers him the only thing that he has in\nlife, an apple. And the officer smiles at the child, takes the apple, bends over, grabs\nhim by the hands and \u2014 and kills him on the spot. How do you explain that? How do\nyou explain the fact that pole \u2014 no, hun \u2014 thousands of Polish officers were\nmurdered by NKVD, by killing them with a bullet in his \u2014 in the back of their head?\nYou know, it was just a very simple thing, right. Next, next. Then you go home, you\nhave supper. You put your child on \u2014 on your lap, tell him the story. And next day\nyou go and do the same thing. Impossible to believe that human beings are capable\nof that. Am I to \u2014 to \u2014 to remember all these things all the time, and accuse all the\npeople of the \u2014 being possible to do that? No, it \u2014 1t was circumstances. But\ncircumstances like that, there are hundreds of them, you know, that people can be\ncapable of such barbarity, and it \u2014 in a civilized nation. You know, to \u2014 to kill six\nmillion Jews? To have special concentration camps that you just do nothing but\ndaily, you know, take them to the bathroom \u2014",
        "Q: Death rooms.",
        "A: \u2014 to \u2014 to the \u2014 to ta \u2014 basically take the shower, and instead of water coming out,\na gas comes out of the shower things, and you \u2014 and you kill them by the hundred.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nYou know, and all in the name of an idea that \u2014 that these are bad people, and that\nyou have to get rid of them because \u2014 because you are looking for lebensraum,\nwhich is the space, you know, living space, the Germans were doing it. They were\ngoing to liquidate the Poles, and they were going to liquidate the Russians, because\nthey were going to take over all this territory and form a thousand year old Reich,\nyou know.",
        "Q: The idea.",
        "A: That was the idea. And \u2014 and many of them went for it. And then when I was in\nGermany in \u2014 in \u2014 in 1955 or \u201956, it was all gone. They were all back to normal\npeople, you know, and you \u2014 nobod \u2014 nobody knew. They just didn\u2019t know that\nsomething like that was happening. Which is, of course, something else. But \u2014 but \u2014",
        "Q: Well, from what you say, it sounds like we\u2019re veering between the need to go\nforward, and the need to remember, but not to dwell on what you remember. Is that\nright?",
        "A: Yes, you \u2014 you \u2014 you have to remember. And that\u2019s why I think the Holocaust\nMuseum d-does a wonderful thing, and I\u2019m so grateful that they extended their\nwillingness to come to places like \u2014 like my home. Yes, you must, but not that you\nhave to, you must remember that. And you must teach that to the next generation, so\nthey don\u2019t repeat that kind of mistake. And I think, if we learned any lessons, then\n142January 21, 2015\nmaybe the sacrifices will bear fruit. But the \u2014 the only thing we have to do is to\nmake sure that somehow we convey it to other generations, you know, and they\nremember that human beings are capable of these unbelievable atrocities, all in the\nname of some idiotic idea, or \u2014 or in the name of Bachkastani(ph), who \u2014 who\nkilled his own \u2014 he had the problems in the beginning of \u2014 of the \u2014 of the war when\nhe waged war against Germany, because before, in the 30s, he killed all the\nofficers\u2019 staff.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about Stalin, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, you know. And so \u2014 so, you know, because you don\u2019t trust anyone, even\nthe people that were with you all this time, helping you to get to the top of the pile,\nand then you kill them because you mistrust them.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and I think this is the si \u2014 this is the something that \u2014 that will \u2014 we should\nbe able to convey to other generations, that you know, please don\u2019t become one of\nthose. Be a human being. Be a loving human being and \u2014 and don\u2019t persecute your\nbrothers.",
        "Q: Well, thank you. Thank you for sharing your story with us today. Thank you for\nthe energy and the time and the attention, and we\u2019re very, very grateful.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Well, tha \u2014 and thank you for coming, because, you know, I \u2014 I \u2014 I wasn\u2019t going\nto disclose this, what I have disclosed to you.",
        "Q: I appreciate that you have. I appreciate that you have.",

        "Q: And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Mr. Witold Pawlikowski on January 19 \u2014 excuse me, January 21\u201c, 2015.\nOkay, so Mr. Pawlikowski, now I want to talk to you a little bit about the\ndocuments here that you have on your lap. Have you ever seen anything like this\nbefore?",
        "A: No, I haven\u2019t. Because I d \u2014 apparently these were filled out by my mother\nsomewhere. I don\u2019t rem \u2014 I don\u2019t see the date. But it says that it\u2019s a displaced\nperson registration record, which \u2014 which shows the registration number, and my\nmother\u2019s name, place of birth, religion, the father\u2019s name, mother\u2019s name and last\nplace of residency in Poland. And okay, thank you.",
        "Q: And there\u2019s one for her and I believe one for you as well.",
        "A: There\u2019s one for me, which is \u2014 which is I\u2019m really grateful for that, but this a \u2014\ncause I didn\u2019t even know that \u2014 that something like that exists.\n144January 21, 2015",
        "Q: The third page is part of the listing in the list on the [indecipherable] boat that\nyou took to the United States. Your names are down there.",
        "A: Right, my names are \u2014 are here, and my mother\u2019s birthdate and place of birth,\nand \u2014 international ref \u2014 refugee organization travel documents are issued in Beirut.\nSo this is the \u2014 the register of the \u2014 on the ship that \u2014 that \u2014 which we took to \u2014 to\nthe United States, which is really something. You know, they just simply didn\u2019t\nshare these documents with us, you know. Maybe they would have if we asked for\nit, but \u2014 and \u2014 and these are also some registration cards.",
        "Q: For you and for her?",
        "A: Date was 4-9-1950. So this was when we apparently are leaving Lebanon to go\nto England. Yes, last occasion Beirut, Lebanon, and destination England, on SS\nOxfordshire.",
        "Q: You know, it\u2019s interesting that I fou \u2014 I got those documents after I got the\nquestionnaire that you filled out. And as I was looking through them I said, this\nconfirms everything that you told me in the questionnaire, everything that you\nwrote in the que \u2014 now, one wouldn\u2019t doubt it, 1t\u2019s simply \u2014",
        "A: You do have documentation of it.",
        "Q: We do have documentation.",
        "A: Right.\n145January 21, 2015",
        "Q: Yeah. So what does it say? Does it \u2014 does it have a meaning for you when you\nsee something like this, 60 \u2014 70 years after the event?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s just like what you said. It \u2014 it really shows the documentation that I did\ngo through those things. It\u2019s not only the Stalin\u2019s picture that I have to show you,\nbut \u2014 but there is actually documentation. Of course, we don\u2019t have any\ndocumentation from the Soviet Union, but \u2014 but this is \u2014 is a\u2014 a wonderful thing,\nand this \u2014 this is application for assistance, whatever that was. And it was 1947, so\nwe were in Lebanon at that time. And this must be the \u2014 when international refu \u2014\nrefugee organization had taken over, and my mother had to fill this out. So \u2014 and\nthis also is a recommendation from England, from the Polish hostel in Lothian(ph)\nPark, Pendred(ph) Cumberland, that my mother has left the camp to go to a\nhostel in Liverpool, and was due to sail for USA on the following day. So this is\nconfirmation that we did travel on Her Majesty\u2019s \u2014 because Her Majesty paid for\nthe trip.",
        "Q: Ah, to the United States?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What would you say to other people? Would you say that it is worth them\nmaking an effort to find out th \u2014 you know, about such documents?\n146January 21, 2015",
        "A: Oh yes, I would say this \u2014 this is fantastic, and I\u2014 you know, maybe it is my\nfault, maybe I could have inquired myself, but \u2014",
        "Q: But you may never have known of its existence.",
        "A: But [indecipherable] of the existence of something like that, you know. I mean,\nsomething that says that she left in feb \u2014 second February for the Danfield Lane\nHostel in Liverpool, and then \u2014 you know, and \u2014 and this is the international\nrefugee organization which \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I have to read it, but \u2014",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: \u2014 but it\u2019s a statement of my mother, that she had to sign, that she waives and\nsurrenders any rights and claims of demands of any blah-blah-blah, whatever.",
        "Q: Some official language there.",
        "A: Some official language that I would be glad to \u2014 to read, but you know, we are\nreally grateful to \u2014 to \u2014 to the fact that such an organization was formed, and helped\nnot thousands, but millions of people to go back and to start life again, in a normal\nlife. Not the place where you see somebody hitting a child\u2019s head on the \u2014 on the\npavement, but normal life, and you can appreciate that and \u2014 and you know, that\u2019s\nwhy I want \u2014 when I came to the United States, I tried to every \u2014 you know, to \u2014 to\ndo everything I can not to go against the law. I was never arrested. I did not use\ndrugs, because life was too dear to me. And I \u2014I think that\u2019s important to know,\n147January 21, 2015\nthat you just live once, and you live for a very short period of time, and it is much\nsimpler to live a simple life, a normal life, where you have family, where you have\n\u2014 you go to church, where you worship, where you remember that it \u2014 1t was not\nyour doing that you were saved, it was something else. And then I think it\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s\nvery important how, even though you have no proof, cause you \u2014 cause you been\njust, you know, right place in the right time, but something else.",
        "Q: I understand.",
        "A: And I \u2014 and I think it\u2019s 1m-important to \u2014 to know and to acknowledge it, and to\nthank God for \u2014 for this gift of life. And now, being grandfather, you know, and\nhaving a ni \u2014 a young lady that, you know \u2014 where\u2019s \u2014 where\u2019s my painting?\nWhere\u2019s my painting, grandchild\u2019s pa-painting?

        "Q: Did that mean you wanted to be \u2014 to grow up and be that way too, or did that\nthought not occur to you?",
        "Q: Okay. All right. All right, so then, let\u2019s turn to your mother. While I\u2019m at \u2014 while\nI\u2019m at it, what \u2014 what are your first memories of your mother, as a little boy before\nthe war?",
        "Q: Again, Pll ask the same type of question. What kind of personality did she have?\nWas she outgoing, was she more reserved?",

        "Q: What about church? Did they go to church regularly?",
        "Q: Now again, this is probably not fair \u2014 a \u2014 a fair question to somebody who was\nsix and seven years old at the time, but I\u2019m curious. In L\u00e9dz, which is a rather large\ncity, there were \u2014 there was a large Jewish population as well. And did you know of\n\u2014 did you know that there were people who were Jews? Did you have any Jews who\nwere neighbors? Did that \u2014 did the Jewish world ever, in any way, come across into\nyour world?",
        "Q: So it was multi-ethnic.",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m thinking, did you ever go to streets that were \u2014 maybe the baker, or\nthere would be a tailor, or you would see like streets that would be particularly, you\nknow, more Jewish, in the Jewish section of town, or \u2014 or neighbors who might be\naround. That \u2014 that sort of question.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you know \u2014 did you have a sense \u2014 now again, this may not be a fair\nquestion because I\u2019m asking it of somebody who was seven at the time, but did you\nhave a sense that there were others, people who were not Polish in the city, or is that\nsomething you learned or knew about later? When you say that Lodz was a multi-\nethnic place, and \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yes, yes. Describe a little bit about the city itself, again, through your eyes. You\ntold us that, you know, you were in a military barracks \u2014 that that \u2014 not a barracks,\nbut an apartment \u2014",

        "Q: Okay. So your contact w-with the Russian military authorities sounds like it was\nrather minimal. It was when they came \u2014 the doctor came to look at your father\u2019s\nwound, and then your father left, and \u2014 I should say Soviet military authorities, not\nRussian military authorities.",

        "Q: \u2014 particularly in the border regions. And it\u2019s \u2014 kind of \u2014 feels almost like grace,\nthat you \u2014 your destiny brings you to a place where you have people who\nunderstand what you\u2019re going through.",

        "Q: An enemy.",
        "Q: And when you were in both places, I get the impression that your contact,\nactually, with official authorities was rather minimal. They weren\u2019t part of your\ndaily life, but they controlled your lives.",
        "Q: Tell ma \u2014 you know, for those of us, and I\u2019m one of them, who \u2014 I\u2019ve never been\nin a steppe. What does a steppe look like?",

        "Q: Wa \u2014 explain how there could be a Polish government, where was it?",
        "Q: So this is where your father had hoped to be able to land.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s the Americans and the British who are saying this to the Soviets?",
        "Q: Do you think your father might have been amongst them?",
        "Q: Let me go back a little bit. When you were talking about the first days of the\nwar, and the Germans overri \u2014 overrunning Poland very, very quickly. And then\nSeptember 17\" the Soviet army marching in. Were you surprised to see the Soviet\narmy? Did anybody \u2014 I mean, did anybody expect to see them? How did they kn \u2014",

        "Q: So tell \u2014 I mean, this 1s all stuff outside of your own specific experience. But to\nput it in some context, can you explain a little bit about that pact?",

        "Q: Soviet.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So, in other words, they had the pact. There were several pacts going on. There\nwas a Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, and there was a surprise on the side of the\nPoles when they see the Soviets there, because what happened to our pact? Then\nthere is the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was signed \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 canceled that one.",
        "Q: And that one is when Nazi Germany and Soviet Union agree not to fight each\nother, and divide Poland.",
        "Q: And then when the Soviets march in, they tell people \u2014 locally, the word on the\nstreet is that we\u2019re here to save you from the Germans.",
        "Q: Okay. All right.",
        "Q: What does that mean?",

        "Q: And yet they\u2019re saving you from German occupation.",
        "Q: Did your mother have to vote in those elections?",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s go back to the address of the place that you were, which I could not\nrepeat for the life of me. And in June 1941, the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union,",
        "Q: Eastern.",
        "Q: Right.",

Before we get to that, I want\nto know, did your \u2014 did you make friends, did your mother make friends with other\nPoles while \u2014 or other people while she was in the Soviet Union?

I suppose when \u2014 when she took me to kindergarten, and\nit would just \u2014 just happen to be that in the \u2014 1n the building that we lived in, the\nkindergarten was just across the street. And so she took me there, and I remember\nher at that time. But, otherwise I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember hearing any park \u2014 particular\nthing from \u2014 from those days, that \u2014 she was there all the time. She was helping,\nyou know.",
        "A: I suppose you could say that she was both. Sometimes she could be very\noutgoing and sometimes she would withdraw into herself.

And it was also kind of a mi-military thing. And\nso these women were head \u2014 were having camps every year. And I remember that\nwe were went with my mother to those \u2014 those camps, and she was working in th \u2014\nas a quartermasters at \u2014 at the camp. And so she was quite \u2014 quite active during\nthose days, and I suppose she was very happy, because you know, she would do\nsomething, so, you know, very useful. And one of these camps was \u2014 was in the\narea where the president of Poland came to visit. And I remember seeing him at\nthat time, in nine \u2014 1937, probably.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, he was gone, right. But 1t was \u2014 no, no, it wasn\u2019t\nWojohosky(ph). No. Nn \u2014 he was never president. But anyways, so \u2014",

So that \u2014\nthat I remember.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nthey were religious people, or whether they were, I would assume, quite patriotic\npeople? But what sort of stories do you remember hearing from them, and the \u2014 the\nthings that they did at home\u2019? What \u2014 what were those pillars of \u2014 of identify, I\nguess one would say.",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 I do remember s-stories that my mother would tell me about \u2014 about\nher father.",
        "A: Who traveled when he was \u2014 when he was a young man, he \u2014 he was edu \u2014 being\neducated in \u2014 in Saint Petersburg in \u2014 in a medical school. And then he traveled,\nand he traveled through the areas through which we traveled later.",
        "A: Right. And the \u2014",
        "A: And I remember too, this particular one, that he was \u2014 he was in \u2014 in \u20141n\nTashkent(ph), and that\u2019s where we went through also. And so it was, you know, an\nunusual story that the second and third generations went the same way. Slightly \u2014 in\nslightly different circumstances of course, because he went as a free man, and we\ndid not.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: But that I remember.",
        "A: Yes. I think all the time, and \u2014 and especially with \u2014 with Father in the military\nuniform also. It was \u2014 1t was always present. I can\u2019t recall any particular talks about\nit, but \u2014 but you know, they \u2014 they lived through the period when Poland was born,\nso for them it was very important. And they were patriots, both of them.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, we \u2014 we went to church, and I \u2014 I remember \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the\nname of the church, but I no \u2014 remember where it was. And when \u2014 when we lived\nin the military block, I know.",
        "A: Ino \u2014I don\u2019t go, I\u2014 you know, I \u2014 but \u2014 but yes, I \u2014 I knew that it\u2019s a\nmultinational, because there was not only Jews, but there were Poles, the Germans,\nJanuary 21, 2015\nthe Russians. It was very international city, because it was an industrial city and the\n\u2014 the \u2014 you know, with all kinds of \u2014 of people.",
        "A: But \u2014 right, but I don\u2019t remember any kind of a anti-something, an anti-\nsomebody talks, because my mother was going with \u2014 with girls that were of\nGerman origin and I\u2019m sure they went with the \u2014 with the Jewish girls, and then so\n\u2014 but I don\u2019t remember particular that \u2014 like if there was a Jew that was visiting us,\nfor example, no.",
        "A: Mm, no, I \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t recall. And I\u2019m sure, because they were all over the place.",
        "A: So, but it \u2014 1t did \u2014 it didn\u2019t strike me in particular because \u2014 I guess because\nthere was no distinction in \u2014 1n the way that no, they\u2019re something else, you know.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nSo in \u2014 in \u2014 in my mind there was \u2014 there was no some kind of a predetermined love\nor hatred of somebody else. I think it \u2014 it was just natural to me.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m sure I have seen all kinds of people in the streets.",
        "A: You know. And \u2014 and because the Jews at that time were dressing in a distinct\nway, you know, so you could recognize them. And they \u2014 m-most of them wore\nbeards, you know, and things like that. And I\u2019m sure I have seen hundreds of them.\nBut I \u2014 it did not impress me in any particular way that this, oh my goodness, 1s\nsomething else. So it \u2014 and \u2014 and that\u2019s the way I am, I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very accepting\nperson. Besides, I\u2019ve seen many people of all kinds of things, so \u2014 and we'll talk\nabout it later [indecipherable]\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, I cannot tell that [indecipherable] exactly, and I did visit it later when I\nwas in Poland. But no, it wasn\u2019t a \u2014 in the middle of the city, but 1t was just a little\nbit away.",
        "A: But we had the very good connection by \u2014 by rail, you know, in the \u2014 what do\nyou call it, the trams?",
        "A: Right. And so, I remember having to use two or three trams to get to my \u2014 my\naunt\u2019s place. So \u2014",

And so he was working as a maintenance\nman in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the factory.",
        "A: My grandfather on my father\u2019s side.",
        "A: So [\u2014I remember him. My grandmother died, and I do remember that she was,\nyou know, in \u2014 in Poland there are no places where you could put the people like \u2014\nlike a \u2014 funeral homes. So basically the person lied in the house for three days\nbefore the \u2014 the person was buried. And I remember seeing her in the \u2014 you know.",
        "A: Well, \u2019m\u2014 I\u2019m a-\u2014I\u2019m sure it was, I\u2014I don\u2019t recollect it right now. But seeing\nyour grandmother laying there and not moving, you know, 1-it\u2019s a shock to any\nchild.",
        "A: And you know \u2014 but it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s so strange that I remember that she was laid out,\nand that was natural thing, this was the thing to do.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And in fact, it was \u2014 you couldn\u2019t think of anything else, because she belonged\nhere, so therefore she goes from here, you know, to the \u2014 to the burial ground. And\ntha \u2014 that \u2014 that I recall. And I do not recall the \u2014 the funeral of my grandfather, or\nmy \u2014 my mother\u2019s mother at all, because we were not there.",

And I \u2014 and I remember when other \u2014 when we were \u2014 when we were\ntraveling, I remember when we went into the train to \u2014 to start the journey. And so\nhe had rented a \u2014 a \u2014 part of a villa on a hill. So in order to \u2014 to go to the town, you\nhad to go down the hill and \u2014 and th \u2014 and walk to the town, because it wasn\u2019t too\nfar away.

        "A: Yes, yes.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes. And, you know, we didn\u2019t have time to travel and visit and anything else,\nbecause we only had two months there.

And by that time I \u2014 and I do remember when later on there \u2014\nthere was a lot of mil \u2014 you know, people and military, they were moving out to \u2014 to\ngo to the border and go to Romania and go to \u2014 to Hungary. So I remember these\ntransports and transports and transports of people on the \u2014 on the \u2014 you know, horse\ndriven carts, and military walking. Thousands of people just moving out. That I \u2014\nthat I\u2019m \u2014 that was even before \u2014 on the \u2014 of cour \u2014 of course before the Russians\ncame in.",
        "A: Yes, it must have been about, you know, maybe 50 - 60 kilometers from the\nSoviet Union.",
        "A: And about the same thing from \u2014 from the other borders. Because you seen that\nPoland was like this, and this thing goes straight over here, you know. So it was \u2014 it\nwas called Do-Dolina(ph) Koa(ph) Stanislawowa (ph), and the Stanislaw6wa(ph)\nwas largest city.",
        "A: And now it\u2019s called Ivana(ph) Petrowsk(ph) in \u2014 you know, in the Ukrainian.\nSo apparently it wasn\u2019t too far away because people who were just walking, you\nknow, within walking distance from the borders.",
        "A: No, down below.",
        "A: Down below because the main st \u2014 main road was going through there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: All the transports were walking, you know. And \u2014 and of course at that time we\ndidn\u2019t know what happened with my father at all, because when the Germans\nJanuary 21, 2015\nattacked, of course they\u2019re moving very fast, and the Russians \u2014 on the 17\" of\nSeptember the Russians came in. And my father came back to us after the Russians\nhave occupied our area. And he was wounded. A shrapnel had hit him in the leg,\nand so he was wounded, and he came. I don\u2019t know how, but at that time the border\nwas still kind of fluid.",
        "A: And so he had the chance to \u2014 to escape from \u2014 because his unit was destroyed,\nbit \u2014 be \u2014 by \u2014 by the time he go \u2014 he got there, it \u2014 it was gone. So \u2014 and complete\ndisorder was \u2014 was in charge of everything. And so he managed to come back to us.\nAnd he was wounded, and \u2014 and I remember that somehow they found out that he\ncame back. And the Russian military people came in, and they saw him, and they\nsaw him being wounded, and they said, well, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll send you a doctor. And\nthe Russian doctor came in and was tending to his wound. But my fa \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2014 no, we saw them also coming in.",
        "A: We saw come \u2014 coming in, and they were not very impressive, because they \u2014\nthey we \u2014 they kept, you know, kind of goofy looking boots on it, you know, and \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015\nand th-th-th \u2014 they were not just like, you know, Polish military. They were not\nreally very well dressed, but there were plenty of them, so \u2014 and they were armed.\nSo that I remember, their \u2014 their coming over, you know, transporting \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 themselves into \u2014 into Poland. And then ma \u2014 somehow, I don\u2019t know, they alt\n\u2014 already the underground system must have started, because my father decided that\nhe\u2019s not going to be waiting until she \u2014 he 1s well, so they can take \u2014 take him \u2014 you\nknow, the Russians can take him. So he decided to escape.",
        "A: And he left us, and went toward the border, and there must have been some kind\nof, you know, group of people that was being formed, and apparently they were just\ncaught on the border.",
        "A: And he was brought back into our town, which of course we didn\u2019t know. But\nsometime later, his barber, who was a Jew, came to my mother and he said, you\nknow, my \u2014 my cousin is working as a guard 1n \u2014 1n the jail, and he told me that\nyour husband is in jail. And he also said that if we wanted to visit him, he will\npermit us to get in, provided it\u2019s four o\u2019clock in the morning.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: So, we did go, and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, SO \u2014 SO we went and \u2014 and he brought my father out from I don\u2019t know\nwhere, and this was the last time we saw him.",
        "A: So, it must have been some time in October.",
        "A: Of course, he was no \u2014 no military uniform, he was dressed up in some kind of a\n\u2014 maybe jail uniform or something, but \u2014 but I don\u2019t exactly remember ama \u2014 as\nthat, you know. But this was the last time we saw him, and as I said, it was probably\nthe \u2014 towards the end of 1939. And then we were told that all the prisoners were\nbeing transported away from \u2014 from Dolina(ph). And several weeks later my\nmother went to Stanistaw6wa(ph), to the larger town, to inquire about what\nhappened with him. And of course, nobody knew anything about it. You know, and\nof course they did, but they didn\u2019t. So this was the last time I saw my father, was \u2014",
        "A: No, of course not, of course not, because we \u2014 no, we know, you know,\nsomebody\u2019s in jail, who knows what \u2014 what happens. And \u2014 but \u2014 so we didn\u2019t\nJanuary 21, 2015\nexpect him \u2014 but sometime in the beginning of March of 1940, the transport\noccurred, and he was taken out.",
        "A: Before he was \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember the \u2014 the \u2014 the words that were exchanged, but it lasted\nabout 15 - 20 minutes, no longer than that, because you know, the \u2014 th-the fellow\nthat was the to \u2014 that permitted that, was taking a very great risk.",
        "A: Because if the \u20141f the NK VD would come in and just \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 find it, he \u2014 he would really suffer.",
        "A: You know, so \u2014 so it was very brave on \u2014 on his part, and very kind on the part\nof my father\u2019s barber to even come up with this idea.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: You know, so we were grateful for that, but 1t was the last time.",
        "A: And \u2014 and after that we \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m sure that that\u2019s wa \u2014 that\u2019s the way it was, because you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the\npay stopped, of course, everything just was ruined. So \u2014 but it \u2014 I don\u2019t recall that\nshe would be going and selling some of the things like it happened later. But \u2014 but\nthis 1s, apparently she \u2014 they must have had some money. And \u2014 but you know, then\nthe Polish zloty had been exchanged, taken out, and the Russian ruble came in and\n\u2014 and all that, and I really don\u2019t know how \u2014 how that happened, but it was just\nseveral months that we lived, because we \u2014 when the Russians came in it was\nSeptember 17\", and when we were deported, it was April 13\". So it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Something \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I did not. Every \u2014 ev \u2014 no, everything was just \u2014 just \u2014 the whole thing was\nshut.",
        "A: You know, and the Russians were taking over, and no, I did not go to, like\nsecond grade at all.",
        "A: No, I remember we went \u2014 we went into town, and must have been to \u2014 to get\nsome supplies or something, but I don\u2019t exactly remember what stop \u2014 you know,\nwhat store we stopped, or something like that. But \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No, but you know, y-yo-you could feel that it was not the same. Then \u2014 and then\nof course, th \u2014 right then from the very beginning, the \u2014 the kind of terror started,\nwhere you wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to anybody freely. You \u2014 you would \u2014 you\nknow, it was \u2014 it \u2014 you could feel that everybody is kind of backing off, you know,\nI\u2019m not going to say anything, and you know, that\u2019s the way it was, because you\ncouldn\u2019t trust anyone any more. And of course, like everywhere else, there were \u2014\nthere were a lot of communists, Polish communists or Ukrainian communists or\nJewish communists. And those people would \u2014 did go into cooperation, so you\nalready didn\u2019t know who you can trust. We apparently trusted my \u2014 you know, the\nlandlord, because then he didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t kick us out or anything like that, so, you\nknow, must have been a very kind and good person to permit that. But, other than \u2014",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember at all. I don\u2019t remember. And I don\u2019t even know \u2014 I don\u2019t\neven remember what kind of church we went to in \u2014 you know, before that, but \u2014\nbecause I don\u2019t recall \u2014 recall that there was \u2014 there would have been church close\nto where we lived. It must have been somewhere else.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sure \u2014 I am sure we did attend the masses got \u2014 but I don\u2019t recall\nseeing \u2014 you know, being any \u2014 any church at the time, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No, I\u2014I- she was apparently a strong character. And so somehow she accepted\nthat, you know, and when she was born and \u2014 until 1914, that part of Poland was\nunder Russian occupation, all \u2014 you know. And so she was not shocked by \u2014 by,\nyou know, being under Russians again somehow.",
        "A: In \u2014 wha \u2014 1n it \u2014 in \u2014 before the first World War, yes.",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: Right. Different \u2014 different ones, different uniforms and you know, different\ngovernment kind of thing, but \u2014 but she was familiar with that.",
        "A: No, she did not. Even \u2014 even \u2014 you know, she probably some few words.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Right, but \u2014 but she \u2014 I don\u2019t know, maybe she was just simply not the type to\nlearn other languages. She did learn some sp \u2014 some French, and \u2014 when she was in\nschool, but apparently she had enough to get by when we were finally required to\nspeak Russian. But \u2014 but she did not become fluent, you know. Probably enough\nwords to \u2014 to get by. And the Russians and Polish are very similar, so you could\nreally understand without having to really learn the language. And that\u2019s the way\nshe was.",
        "A: Right.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No. Becau \u2014 you know that when they found out that my father was going \u2014 was\nout \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they \u2014 I don\u2019t remember that somebody came in to inquire about what\nhappened, that my mother was beaten, or something like that. Somehow we \u2014 we\nwere lucky enough to avoid that kind of contact.",
        "A: Then we \u2014 then the first deportation from the Polish territories occurred in \u2014 1n\nFebruary \u2014 in February. And so we were aware of the fact that people were being\ndeported. And of course, you never knew who was going to be the next one. But\nthen on\u2014 on April 13\" at night, another \u2014 three o\u2019clock, four o\u2019clock in the morning\nor something like that, a banging sounded at the door, and the Russian troops came\nin, and th \u2014 we were ordered to pack within half an hour, and we\u2019re being taken\naway. So \u2014",
        "A: Yes, and this is \u2014 this is the standard normal way that those units operated.\nBecause you were asleep, you were drowsy, you know, you \u2014 you don\u2019t \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t resist because you were not organized yet. And so this was the standard\nway that they would come in in the morning. And so we \u2014 my mother packed\nJanuary 21, 2015\nwhatever she could into a match \u2014 kind of box, and we were then taken to the \u2014 to\nthe railroad station in \u2014 in Dolina(ph).",
        "A: By \u2014 by horse driven cart.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I \u2014 from \u2014 from \u2014 from \u2014 within the nearest \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 area. And we were taken over to the \u2014 to the station and loaded on the \u2014 no, I\ncall it cattle car, it was just a regular, you know, railroad car that how was \u2014 inside\nwas divided into two areas. The middle was open, and then on \u2014 the other two they\nhad the \u2014 they had the lower level and they had another level where we \u2014 they\nwould put the people on.",
        "A: Like a \u2014 like a bu \u2014 like a bunk, but it was just a whole solid floor across the\nwhole thing. And \u2014 and so they loaded the entire thing, I don\u2019t know how many, 60\npeople, I think were just like \u2014 we\u2019re just packed, you know. And the doors were\nJanuary 21, 2015\nshut, and in the, you know, several hours laters, this \u2014 the train started and we\nstarted moving towards the \u2014 the Soviet border.",
        "A: Which way we were going?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: I think we were \u2014 we were on the lower floor.",
        "A: And so th \u2014 and \u2014 and a \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, the only facility that was in the\nthing was \u2014 was a hole in the \u2014 in the floor where you could go and do your\nwhatever \u2014 things. And so we were taken, and it took couple days, I suppose.\nBecause you know, those \u2014 those transports, they are not \u2014 they stopped for military\nand this and that, and they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t care how long it takes for them to\ntravel. So, a-after a couple days we had to be relo \u2014 reloaded into the Russian train.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall, but I\u2019m sure they did talk ab-about it, you know, and \u2014 but there\nweren't any c-cries, any yellings, or anything like that. It was rather quiet, because\neverybody was s-so scared \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that you \u2014 you know, I mean all of a sudden you\u2019re taken away \u2014 everything is\nyou \u2014 y-you in completely different world. This is what you have, and that\u2019s all?\nAnd so it wasn\u2019t something that the people start sa \u2014 you know, telling jokes, and\nlaughing, you \u2014 you know. It was \u2014 it was rather silent. And I remember when \u2014\nwhen we came to the border, and we had to move to the Russian trains, because the\nRussian railroad system was wired in Polish. So th \u2014 we couldn\u2019t use Polish trains\nany more. So we were reloaded, and kept going east. And then realized that we are\nbeing sent, you know, into the territory of the so \u2014 Soviet Union. So it \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember how it \u2014 how long it took, but it probably took several weeks for us to\nfinally travel almost to \u2014 to the Ural Mountains, just a \u2014 towards the \u2014 towards the\n\u2014 with \u2014 on the south of the Ural Mountains, and \u2014 and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and the\nsteppe begins, the \u2014 the plains.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes, we were ti\u2014 we were fed apparently, you know, the \u2014 the famous Russian\nthing that you can get on a train. It\u2019s called kipiatok, the hot water \u2014 the boiling\nwater from the \u2014 from the engine. So they would open and said okay, okay, go and\nget kipiatok. So everybody went, you know, and \u2014",
        "A: You \u2014 if y-you better had something on your own. So that was the only liquid\nthat we were given, and they apparently must have stop on their own \u2014 on the \u2014 on\nthe way wherever they stopped, to give us some bread. And in general, in Russian \u2014\nin Russia that\u2019s what you \u2014 if you\u2019re lucky, you eat bread, not like this one 1n here,\nbut \u2014 but you were lucky if you \u2014 if you got, you know, a hundred grams of bread a\nday. And that\u2019s the way we were fed.",
        "A: Yes. Which was very different from the first deportation, where people were\ndeported in the middle of the winter. And in that time, many old people, many\nchildren have died o-of \u2014 just froze to death. I-In our case no, because it was \u2014 you\nknow, already spring.",
        "A: No.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No, no, no, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t that, because no, it was just normal spring\ntemperatures already. So we were not freezing and \u2014 an-and it was cold, but we\nwere not freezing.",
        "A: Oh sure, n-no, I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember any particular \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 like I suppose she must have talked to m \u2014 told me that don\u2019t worry, everything\nis going to be fine, but I don\u2019t recall this, as a particular, you know, moment of my\nlife.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They were all stranger, y-you know, you were [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 and you know, after being two months, you know, in an \u2014 in a new area.",
        "A: But \u2014 but you mir \u2014 you make friends right there, you\u2019re beginning to talk to\npeople and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Okay, and then after \u2014 after traveling for some time, we were unloaded in\nKostanay, which is a capital city of the Kazakhstan, Kazakh Republic. And we\nwere transported to a \u2014 to a kolkhoz, which is \u2014",
        "A: Kolkhoz is a \u2014 is a farm run by the government.",
        "A: It\u2019s a\u2014 you know, there was no pra \u2014 private property, there was just a \u2014 when\nthe revolution happened, they took the mi \u2014 the land from the landlords, and from\nthe people and made them into units, which are large administrative units called in \u2014\nI think our case, kolkhoz.",
        "A: And we would \u2014 we put in a \u2014 in a \u2014 the village, and in \u2014 into the house of a \u2014 of\na Ukrainian couple that was deported during 1930s.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: When \u2014 when the \u2014 you know, the Russians started the killing of the Ukrainians,\nand they just simply starved them to death. And I think it was just like nine million\npeople di \u2014 that starved to death, because they started rebelling against the, you\nknow, Russians taking their soil, their land, their \u2014 their things. So they became a\npart of this group that lush \u2014 Russians, as they say, pacified them by transporting\nthem into the Kazakhstan. So \u2014 so they fully realized what we went through,\nbecause they went through it. So they were very kind, very friendly, you know, and\n\u2014 and opened their house for us.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right, you know, and in \u2014 and I \u2014 I don\u2019t to \u2014 I don\u2019t think there was any\nRussian normal person that did not go to some kind of something like that. And\nthen ta \u2014 so, we were there for several months, and my mother was working cutting\npeat.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Well, you know \u2014 you know what peat is, 1t was \u2014 it\u2019s a\u20141t\u2019s a\u2014 like a\u2014hm. A\ngrowth of \u2014 of \u2014 of a thing \u2014",

And since they never saw anything\nlike that in their lives, they got scared. So they started escaping and he run after\nthem.

        "A: \u2014 wolves\u2019 fur. So apparently he was chasing them and \u2014 and biting them, and he\nchased them away. So he became a hero of \u2014 of the \u2014 of the farm. So \u2014 he had quite\na life.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. And so, you know, all the people in the village really\nliked him, you know, and all that kind of stuff. And he survived until later. And I'll\ntell you about that.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, not at \u2014 not at all.\nJanuary 21, 2015",

        "A: No, they\u2019re \u2014 they were a congregation of all kinds of people. Because you\nknow, anybody that worked for the polis \u2014 Polish government was naturally a \u2014 a\u2014",
        "A: \u2014an enemy. So they \u2014 they had professors, they had teachers, they had, you\nknow, simple people who were in the army, you know, for example, you know, just\n\u2014 just being a private in the army.

        "A: Right, because you know, th-the \u2014 the thing is that \u2014 that once you get deported\ninto these vast territories, you \u2014 you \u2014 you can be physically free, because you\u2019re\nJanuary 21, 2015\nnot going to go away anywhere, because it 1s just simply impossible to escape. And\nI read many books later on, that \u2014 it\u2019s the same thing is written in \u2014 in many books\nor people that were actually in jail, they were \u2014 they were, you know, under \u2014 under\nthe \u2014 the supervision of the \u2014 of the military and things. And \u2014 but they were free to\nmove about, because they didn\u2019t c \u2014 there was no way you can escape.

        "A: And some \u2014 some small animals, some wolves, you know, things. And in the\nmiddle of those \u2014 of those things, there were these locations of different farms, and\nlike this one that we went \u2014 that we were, the \u2014 the cattle farm. Or there were \u2014\nthere were both the grown-up cattle and the calves, you know, and so \u2014",
        "A: The first place I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: But \u2014 but the second one I \u2014 I even know the address. [speaks Russian]. The\nfirst \u2014 the farm number one, Krabawick(ph) was \u2014 was a little town that was like a\nc\u2014acounty seat.",
        "A: And Kostanay was the \u2014 the capital.",

        "A: Apparently yes, later on, because you know the \u2014 th-the newspapers would\narrive there from time to time, and th-they would learn from the Russians we would\n\u2014 we would find out. But it wasn\u2019t until later, of course, that it came to us somehow,\nyou know, through word of mouth or whatever, is that \u2014 that there \u2014 once the\nRussians were attacked, and the Germans were moving very rapidly, th-the\nRussians somehow managed to make contact with the \u2014 with the west, with the\nBritish and the Americans. And they formed a ali-alliance all of a sudden. And so,\nbecause they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t have enough equipment, you know, so the \u2014 so the\nBritish and the Americans started supplying them with \u2014 with the military\nequipment. And at that time, of course, the \u2014 the relationships between the Soviet\nUnion and the Polish government was broken in 1939, and we didn\u2019t have any mu \u2014\na-any diplomat relations with \u2014 with them at all.",
        "A: Well, in \u20141n 1939, as I told you, there were people, hundreds of people,\nthousands of people moving out of Poland, going \u2014 going south. The Polish\ngovernment also left. And from \u2014 from Hungary they were then transported to\nJanuary 21, 2015\nFrance, and they f \u2014 reformed as a \u2014 as a new government representing different\npolitical parties. Then es-established this \u2014 themselves in France, and they started\nbuilding up Polish military, because there were a lot of people that were escaping.\nAnd that \u2014 they somehow managed to escape then from \u2014 from \u2014 from Romania\nand from Hungary, where they were \u2014 they were interned, because those countries\nwere \u2014 were in \u2014 were \u2014 what do you call it? Were not participating in war, they\nwere \u2014 they were neutral. So they \u2014 by the thousands they just run different ways.\nYou know, the \u2014 the roads opened to Italy and \u2014 and all kinds of places.",
        "A: That\u2019s what he was hoping, that he\u2019s going to \u2014 to end up. And so they formed\nmilitary units in France. And then, of course, when France was attacked, they did\ngive up even sooner than \u2014 than Poland did. And since we had an alliance with \u2014\nwith the British, the British had evacuated Polish troops from France, into\nEngland. And this \u2014 so the Polish government had reestablished itself in England,\nand upon British insistence, the Soviet Union, because I don\u2019t know exactly what \u2014\nwhat was the \u2014 the \u2014 the words, but they said, you know, okay, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll qui \u2014\ngive you equipment, but you know, you got \u2014 you \u2014 you telling us to open the\nsecond front, you know, we not quite ready yet. But you have thousands of Polish\ntroops in the Soviet Union prisons. Why don\u2019t you release them, and you\u2019ll have\nJanuary 21, 2015\nready troops, you know. So somehow they managed to reestablish relationship with\nthe Polish government in \u2014 in London.",
        "A: Right. They said, you know, wis\u2014we\u2019ll help you, but \u2014 but you know, you\nsaying that you don\u2019t have enough troops, and blah-blah-blah-blah, this or this. But\nyou know, you have \u2014 you have maybe couple hundred thousand troops that you\nhave arrested when you came into Poland. Because that\u2019s what happened, you\nknow, because the units that were located in \u2014 1n the east, they were all, you know,\ntaken over by the Russians, and by the thousands they were deported to Russia.\nAnd as you probably know, the \u2014 the \u2014 many of the officers and \u2014 and a \u2014 and a --\nleading classes, like judges and teachers and things, they were \u2014 they were arrested\nby the thousands by the Soviets. And \u2014 and then the Polish officer corps, at \u2014 at\nleast they know about 20,000 that were killed in Katyn, which was several times\nwhere they decided to liquidate the Polish military prisoners of war, which was\nagainst, you know, the Geneva Conference, of course. But they killed 14,000 that\nwas known, that \u2014 that were \u2014 that \u2014 that were killed.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think so, because those were the officers\nthat were \u2014 that were arrested as \u2014 as they gave themselves up to \u2014 to the Russians.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nBecause you know, Poland ha \u2014 had a \u2014 had a \u2014 a pact of \u2014 of military help. And of\ncourse when the Germans and the Russians reestablished their pact, th-the Russians\njust liquidated that \u2014 that pact, so th-th-the officers that were arrested, you know, in\nthe \u2014 in the military, they were in mi-military uniforms, they were in the units. So\nthe troops were sent, you know, into exile, but the officers were put in the \u2014 in a\u2014 in\nthe prisons.",

        "A: This what \u2014 what \u2014 what was telling people on the street, you know. And\nbecause we didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, th-they didn\u2019t let know that they had the Stalin li-\nlibben \u2014 Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, which they signed in August.\nJanuary 21, 2015",

And they pre-assigned the border, which they are\ngoing to divide Poland into \u2014 into, you know, into two parts. And so, on September\n17\", they just simply moved.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: And \u2014 and so the \u2014 all the Polish military were, you know, surprised as to what\u2019s\ngoing on. We have pact of non-aggression with you, and \u2014 and so that\u2019s what\nhappens.",
        "A: Which kind of canceled \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 canceled the Polish \u2014 Polish-Russian pact.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: We are here to help you. And so, you know \u2014 and the \u2014 and then the \u2014 once the \u2014\nthis became and \u2014 and they came in to Poland and \u2014 and all that, I remember they\nwere al-always saying [speaks Russian]",
        "A: We are friends with Germany.",
        "A: They would s \u2014 the military, you know, people that \u2014 well, the authorities, were\nsaying that they are friends of the Germans.",
        "A: Right. Well, because they took over, you know, that \u2014 that \u2014 and that they \u2014 you\nknow, several months after they \u2014 they took over, even before we were deported,\nthey had elections. And 99.9 percent of Poles voted for those territories to become\nparts of the Soviet Union. O-On paper, of course.",
        "A: Everybody had to vote. And it didn\u2019t make any difference how you voted,\nbecause the percentage came out 99.9 anyway. So \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015\nand somehow world \u2014 word must filter to your village that \u2014 that now \u2014 you know,\nthere is an attack, the Soviet Union is at war on its own territory.",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s not [indecipherable] yet, but they were \u2014 they just moved to \u2014 to\nwest \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the eastern part of Poland, and then it\u2019s a military \u2014",
        "A: But apparently this is what \u2014 this 1s what \u2014 what happened, and as I said the \u2014\nthey would receive from y \u2014 from time to time the newspapers, and all of a sudden\nne \u2014 you know, the newspaper just turned out to write like that. Because once we\nwere friends, and now we\u2019re the enemies. And so, somehow this kind of\ninformation got leaked into \u2014 into our areas. But it didn\u2019t make any \u2014 any\ndifference, until later on, when the re \u2014 when the relations were reestablishment\nbetween the Polish and the Russian government. And when the Russian issued a \u2014 a\ndocument, which made us back free citizens, with ability to move on the territory of\nthe Soviet Union.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how it happened, of course you know. But \u2014 but this is \u2014 I know\nthat later on from \u2014 from reading, that this is what happened, 1s that \u2014 that all of a\nsudden, even the people in our \u2014 1n our little community have realized that now they\ncan move about.",
        "A: Oh. I remember \u2014 one \u2014 one thing I remember is that after that happened, is that\nall of a sudden the older \u2014 the people that were located within \u2014 within the territory\nthat we were in, somehow they discovered that the Polish army is being formed, in\nthe southern states of the Soviet Union. And so everybody started moving south.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: Well, in a way, but you know, it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a friendship. You just\ndon\u2019t develop friendship all of a sudden like that. It was \u2014 1t \u2014 it was a\u2014 a kind\nfeelings towards us, und-understanding feelings, that they know what we\u2019re going\nthrough because they have been through it.",
        "A: Right. And \u2014 and \u2014 but it\u2019s very gi \u2014 difficult to call friendship, if you\u2019re there\nfor three or four months and you move somewhere else, you know. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not th\nJanuary 21, 2015\n\u2014 not the same thing as you develop friendships over a long period of time. But it\nwas g-good relationships, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "A: Yes. The-These \u2014 these were \u2014 these were your \u2014 your people, and so, you know,\nand \u2014 and since we are in the same village, and well, like I said beginning that we\nlived in with two other families in there. So \u2014 so you developed this kind of\nfriendship. Which lasts \u2014 I have friends now that \u2014 that I \u2014 not too many, I \u2014I\nhaven\u2019t \u2014 those that I met in the Soviet Union, they all went different ways. But the\nones later on in Teheran and Iran, I \u2014 I ha\u2014 I maintain friendship with those\npeople until now. And I \u2014 I remember an \u2014 an incident when I was working for steel\n\u2014U:S. Steel Corporation, and I was traveling throughout the United States, and I\n\u2014 so I\u2014I went \u2014 I was going to Cleveland, and I told my boss, I \u2014 I said that\u2019s\ngreat, because I have a friend in Cleveland. And then a few months later, I-I was\ngoing to Philadelphia, and I said, oh, it\u2019s terrific, I have a friend in Philadelphia.\nAnd then I\u2019m going to San Francisco, and he says, if you tell me that you have a\nfriend in San Francisco, I won\u2019t believe it. And I said, but I do. So he said, how in\nthe heck could you guys do that? Well, you know, I have a friend that I just talked\nto just recently who \u2014 who lives in \u2014 in Argentina. I have friends in Australia.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nThat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the way \u2014 what happens, you know, that those people spread around\nall over the place. I have fre \u2014 friends in Canada that \u2014 that we visit, and we \u2014 we\nkeep the \u2014 those friendships.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We-\u2014 we \u2014 we were in the same collective farm, and she was there with her\nmother.",
        "A: Her \u2014 her name was Leila. She was a Polish Jewess, and my mother had\ndeveloped close friendship with her, and then when we \u2014 we left, she went to\nEngland sooner than we did, because her brother was in the Polish army.",
        "A: She wa \u2014 she was deported as well, with her mother. And so when \u2014 when \u2014 after\nyears that we haven\u2019t seen her, because she was already in England, when we\nfinally ended up in England, she \u2014 she ca-came to visit us, and then I was moving\nto London from the little town that \u2014 up in the \u2014 almost on the Scottish border. And\nso she accepted me there, I was with \u2014 with her for some time.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: I lived with her, and then after years, you know, after I came here, and I was in\nthe army again, and we f\u2014 with a friend mi \u2014 of mine, we \u2014 we went to visit\nLondon, and we went to visit her. And at that time she was working for a very\nexclusive nightclub.",
        "A: And she invited us and \u2014 and we met Mr. Errol Flynn.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: So \u2014so, you know, these friendships last a lifetime, because you had something\nin common.",
        "A: Yes. Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, and he moved to the United States, he lived somewhere in the \u2014 1n the west\ncoast, and he\u2019s gone by now.",
        "A: No, I-",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t, no. But she was very close with my mother an-and I \u2014 I have a picture.",

        "A: Y.",
        "A: Oh, and well, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll tell that story later. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Right, and \u2014 and how did it come and all way to this little godforsaken place, I\ndon\u2019t know, but we found out that there is an agreement, and that by this agreement\nall the Poles are released from the prisons, and then the Polish army is being\nformed. So when \u2014 when this group of Poles in our village and o-other places heard\nthat, they all got together and they decided to move south towards where the army\nwas being formed.",
        "A: We were transported to \u2014 to this \u2014 to the railroad station, I don\u2019t know how, how\nthey managed this I have no idea, but the transport was formed and we were moved\nto the railroad station, loaded on a train. And the train, I think it was like six weeks\nthat we were on the train. Again, the cattle car, and so we were moving from one\nplace to another, until we went to \u2014 through Tashkent(ph), the place that my\ngrandfather was \u2014 was in, and we went through Bukhara(ph) and I \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nhow many other places.",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 it was slightly bigger, because of \u2014 of the railroad system of \u2014 in \u2014\nin the Soviet Union. But the \u2014 the \u2014 you know \u2014",
        "A: The slats were the sa \u2014 the same. Except for more people.",
        "A: No, we were not locked any more.",
        "A: No, because we were free citizens to move about. Which is, you know, very\nunusual in the Soviet Union. And so, in traveling all these \u2014 these distances, we\nfinally ended up where they decided to unload us because the railroad wheels were\nbeing abused, you know, so we had to discharge. And they moved us to a kolkhoz\ncalled Frumza(ph).",
        "A: It was a collec \u2014 collective farm called Frumza(ph), and is \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t far\naway, maybe 20 kilometers from what they call now Almaty(ph).",
        "A: Or Almata(ph).",
        "A: And so we\u2019re unloaded there, and put in a kolkhoz, and then we found out that a\npart of the division is being formed in \u2014 in alna \u2014 Almata(ph). And we were with\nthis other woman and her son, and both my mother and she became ill with typhoid\nfever, and she died.",
        "A: The other lady died. The son was 15 or 16 at that time, older than I was, and so\nmy mother, you know, took care of him. And my mother almost died also, but she\nwas \u2014 and she was \u2014 she was \u2014 she told me later on she was moved from the room,\ninto the hallway, and this \u2014 the \u2014 the nurses said uzha(ph) konshied(ph). She\u2019s\nfinishing up. And \u2014 and then my mother said no. I have a son. And then she\nrecovered. And so, what happened that this \u2014 this \u2014 this lady\u2019s husband was in a \u2014 in\na Polish military unit, a corps of engineers, and he escaped and was in \u2014 in\nPalestine. And \u2014",
        "A: And she knew that, and he had also her addresses from \u2014 from the Soviet Union.\nSo he discovered that his best friend is in a unit that is being formed in Almata(ph).\nAnd his friend came to pick us up \u2014 pick them up and take them to where the\nmilitary was. And she was gone already, so instead, we were taken, and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and the boy. And \u2014",
        "A: Janusz.",
        "A: Sohachewski(ph).",
        "A: Sohachewski(ph). And when \u2014 when \u2014 when we came to Teheran his father\ntook him and brought him to \u2014 to Palestine, and enrolled him in \u2014 in the Polish like\norganization of \u2014 like a mil \u2014 paramilitary organization. And then, of course he went\nto England, and he lives in England [indecipherable] right now, and we keep in\ntouch.",
        "A: So, you know, he\u2019s just like my older brother.",
        "A: Right. My \u2014 my \u2014 my mother had written to the Polish Red Cross, and the\ninternational Red Cross and I \u2014 somewhere she has a \u2014 a document which 1s \u2014 it\nappears that your husband has died on the territory of the Soviet Union. And that\u2019s\nthe only thing we have.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: But there \u2014 there\u2019s no record of when and how, of what causes \u2014 was it his wo \u2014\nyou know, re \u2014 reworking of the wound, or was he killed? We don\u2019t know. Because\nthis kind of documentation you simply do not get from that system. There, nobody\nknows anything. And as \u2014 it\u2019s much easier that way. And you know, it \u2014 to me,\nright now, it doesn\u2019t make any difference. I know that he perished. So what else can\nyou do? But, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something that you have to live with, and\nsomething that you must realize, that this is what happened, that you have gone\nthrough some unusual circumstances, and \u2014 and you have to live, because if you\ndon\u2019t, if you think about it all the time, you can really hurt yourself quite a bit. So\nthat\u2019s why me \u2014 maybe I have forgotten some of these things, maybe purposely, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: But you know \u2014 but it\u2019s one of those \u2014 those things, and what difference does it\nmake where he 1s, and if I \u20141f I could find his grave or something? It\u2019s 50 some\nyears, you know, he\u2019s gone. And you know, I \u2014 I d\u2014I know he\u2019s gone and I know\nthat he\u2019s perished at the \u2014 you know, in the territories of the Soviet Union and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s satisfactory to me.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes, I think it was already in \u2014 1n Teheran that she found out, right. And we\nhave never \u2014 there was nev \u2014 never a trace of him, you know, somebody coming out\nthat knew him from the prison or something. Nothing. Just gone. So I \u2014 I suppose\nhe must have died soon after he was deported, you know, and probably from the\nwound, because it wasn\u2019t healed, at that time.",
        "A: Well, first of all, you know, once we were under the protection of \u2014 of the\nmilitary, we began to be fed.",
        "A: In\u20141in \u2014 still in \u2014 in Uzbekistan because Almaty(ph) is in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Uzbekistan.",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 so our survival was \u2014 the possibility of survival was much, much\nbetter terms. And then, as I said before, the \u2014 the Russians didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to arm\nthe Polish military, because it was \u2014 you know, something that they just don\u2019t do.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nYou do not arm the enemies, who become now friends, and so \u2014 so they were still\nasking Americans and British to open up the front, and \u2014 and they said, well you\nhave \u2014 you have the Polish army, you have over 100,000 troops, you know, why\ndon\u2019t you arm them? Oh, we don\u2019t have anything to do. So the British said, well,\nthen you release them. Let us take care of them, let us arm them, and they can\nbecome a part of the second front when we finally open it. So, by miracle I suppose,\nUncle Stalin decided that yes, okay, we will do that. And we were released. And so\nmilitary started moving [indecipherable] troops.",
        "A: That\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what even the Poles wanted to do, because of what \u2014 they\nwanted to fight for Poland, you know, as when the Russians are \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 going to start pressing westward, they will part of the \u2014 of that system. But the\nRussians didn\u2019t trust them, because they were all anti-Soviet. Many of them had \u2014\nhad fought in the \u2014 in the war of 1920, when the Soviets started pushing into\nPoland, and were defeated, luckily. So \u2014 so the \u2014 all these troops were enemies.",
        "A: No. Not \u2014 not yet.",
        "A: No. And so \u2014 so the \u2014 the relationship was lukewarm at best. And I suppose they\nreally wanted to get rid of those people too, because there \u2014 there would \u2014 you\nknow, there would \u2014 th-they were like a \u2014 like \u2014 like a foreign organism within the\nsystem, you know, and th-there were \u2014 there were \u2014 y-you know \u2014 I \u2014 I remember\nthere\u2019s a little story that one of the units, I don\u2019t know which one it was, because I\nhad it \u2014 I heard a story about it. But they were being formed and a \u2014 and then local\npeople have come to \u2014 to this unit, and they said, do you \u2014 do you \u2014 do you play this\n\u2014 this hymn that \u2014 that is being played by \u2014 by the trumpet? And \u2014 and guy says\nwhat \u2014 oh, what a \u2014 what a di \u2014 this single trumpeteer sings this song, you know, di\n\u2014 plays this song. And all of a sudden this \u2014 this guy realizes that in the city of\nKrakow there is a \u2014 there is a\u2014 a church with a \u2014 with a spire on it. And in \u20141n 14\n\u2014 in 1200 some, when \u2014 when the Tartars and \u2014 and Turks s-started moving towards\nPoland, they came to that town. And the guy being at the top of the \u2014 of \u2014 of the \u2014\nof the tower, he saw it. And so he played th-the hymn to warn the city to close the\ngates and \u2014 and protect itself. And \u2014 which we did. And then \u2014 their \u2014 their attack\nwas repursed \u2014 repursed, and then they had to go back, and we chased them away.\nAnd \u2014 and they remembered this story being told over generations, because you\nJanuary 21, 2015\nknow, from \u2014 that if they hear that flo \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that hymn again, they will\nbecome free.",
        "A: To ask that they play this \u2014 this \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that they can be free \u2014 free. Well, of course it took another 50 years, but they \u2014\nthey\u2019re free now.",

        "A: After we left.",
        "A: After we left, yes.",
        "A: Because it \u2014 you know, it would be written and all that kind of stuff. But can you\nimagine now, from 1200 something, to have it believe that something like that, if \u2014\nif this \u2014 this trumpet is played again in our town \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",

So they \u2014 they were to transport all this Polish cattle,\nthat was fine with them, and you know, they did their \u2014 their duties as a seamen.\nBut, you know, we were on the ship only, I think two or three days, so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 this is a shi \u2014 it\u2019s a short distance.",
        "A: Because Caspian Sea is a lake, huge lake, but it\u2019s called sea.",
        "A: We dropped on the shore in Baclevy(ph) and we spent Easter there, and \u2014 and\nthe first thing you \u2014 you had to do 1s to attend, or to go to \u2014 to be washed, and all\nyour things were to be given up, because lice was in everybody\u2019s clothing. And not\njust lice, hundreds of them. I remember one time sitting down and \u2014 and killing 200\nof them in one time. Just, ck, ck, ck, you know.",
        "A: This was Soviet Union. So that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s why we had to give up all our clothing,\nand they were just burned.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. No, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 you \u2014 you are being transported, you di \u2014 never knew\nwhen you\u2019re going \u2014 you know, you\u2019ve made a stop. Some people would go away,\nyou know, to find some, I don\u2019t know, food or something like that. They come back\nand they\u2019re \u2014 and they\u2019re \u2014 the train was gone. And that\u2019s why yo \u2014 a lot of families\nwere lost. That\u2019s why there were a lot of children that were without the parents,\nbecause either they died, or they simple \u2014 there were incidents like that, where the\nmother was left over, standing in the car, and you know, the train was gone. So, of\ncourse the \u2014 there was no time for washing.",
        "A: There \u2014 there \u2014 there \u2014 there usually was always a banyo(ph) what they called,\nor bath, probably bath, you know, where you could take the shower. But taking\nshowers wasn\u2019t a weekly occurrence, you know, because they would be closed, and\nJanuary 21, 2015\n\u2014 or \u2014 or you were working, or something like that. So you \u2014 you just had to wash in\na little bowl.",
        "A: Yeah, and that\u2019s the way it was, so basically the \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 we started being\ncivilized when we ended up in \u2014 in Baclevy(ph).",
        "A: We were cleaned up, issued new clothing, and we spend there, I think about two\nweeks. And then we were taken by \u2014 and my doggie, by the way, was with us all the\ntime. Tito was there. And so, in about two weeks, we were loading \u2014 loaded on a \u2014\non a trucks that were driven by the Iranians, and we were taken by these trucks, on a\nterrible road which was climbing all the \u2014 all over the mountains, across the\nmountains, and in \u2014 into the Teheran, which is located on \u2014 on the plains, on the \u2014\non the south side of the \u2014 of the range of mountains. And at that time, they were\nalready forming camps. And like in Teheran there were three civilian camps, and a\nmilitary camp. So we were in camp number two, and we stayed there for about two\nyears.",
        "A: Right, and by \u2014 my mother then found a job again as a \u2014 as part of a\u2014 ofa\nquartermaster of the \u2014 of the camp. So she was working in the camp, and right away\nJanuary 21, 2015\nthey reinstituted the schooling system. And the \u2014 the camp in which we were was\nactually an unfinished factory, tha \u2014 with number of buildings that were built by the\nGermans, because Germans had the very good relationship with the Iranians before\nthe war. And when the war broke out, th-the Russians, the British and the\nAmericans oc-occupied the country. Maybe it \u2014 it\u2019s strong wor-word to use, but\nthey moved their military forces \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 into Iran to protect the \u2014 the oil fields, because they didn\u2019t want to give to the\nGermans. So, at that time, you know, we \u2014 all these three militaries were present in\n\u2014 in Teheran.",
        "A: No, th-there were \u2014 they \u2014 they had administration of the camp, was given to the\nPolish \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 administration. So the British were just on the outside, you know, and we did\nnot have anything to do with them.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Appr \u2014 right.",
        "A: All \u2014 all \u2014 all the young men that \u2014 that were in the \u2014 in the military age, they\nwere taken into the army, or the \u2014 they volunteered for the army. And they were\nmoved to Iraq. So the Polish military training bases were formed in Iraq. And not\nonly that, but they were also used to protect the airf \u2014 th-the oil fields in Iraq. So\nthey \u2014 they were there until 1943, I think. And then they w \u2014 they were moved to\nEgypt, and from Egypt were the second front bes \u2014 being opened in Italy, was\nbeing invaded by the allied forces. They participated in \u2014 in that campaign.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: No, there were a lot of children, and of course, as I said before, there were a lot\nof orphans, an-and this \u2014 this \u2014 th-the \u2014 the camps in \u2014 in Teheran were transitory\ncamps. So the people from there were being transported everywhere: to \u2014 to Africa,\nto India, to Mexico. So there were \u2014 as the people were coming in, so were people\nwere leaving all the time, so \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right. They \u2014 so they all \u2014 this \u2014 so camp number \u2014 camp number one was the\nmili \u2014 no, camp number four was the military camp. But it was very small camp,\nbecause this was also a transitory camp. And so wi \u2014 whoe \u2014 whatever unit came in\nfrom \u2014 from the Soviet Union, they were just processed and moved to where the\ntraining actually had to start, because they had to retrain. Many of them were\nyoung, and th-they didn\u2019t have any service. So they were do \u2014",
        "A: Right.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Right, right. Except now they are \u2014 they are not 14 - 17, they were \u2014 they were,\nyou know, ready to go into the military.",
        "A: And so these units were trained until 1943, I think, where they were then made\nready for \u2014 for military service.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 their ka \u2014 they kept coming, and so my mother would \u2014 would receive those\nthen, and put them in the different places where they had \u2014 they \u2014 not all of them\ncould live in those buildings, and so there were also tents, that the British had given\nus. And so there were \u2014 there \u2014 there was a kitchen and, you know, the \u2014 everybody\nwas being fed from the \u2014 the kitchen, and there were the facilities. American gifts\nwere coming, because at the time a lot of people were donating things. So our\nclothing was \u2014 was American clothing, because that\u2019s what we have gotten from \u2014\nfrom them. And as I mentioned to \u2014 then we started school. And there were \u2014 there\nwere no books, so every had \u2014 everything had to be written. You had to remember\nfrom what \u2014 what the teacher was telling you.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Because we had no books. But \u2014 but \u2014",
        "A: No. But they also formed scouting organizations in the \u2014 and I jon \u2014 joined the\nscouting. And, so actually, normal life.",
        "A: Oh yes, you know, yes. And \u2014 and on \u2014 in so \u2014 but we had, you know, we \u2014 of\ncourse we\u2019re free to go, so we could go to town. And since my mother started\nworking we had some, you know, some of money, and we were able to go to town.\nAnd the \u2014 the Persians, who are very friendly \u2014 nothing like happens right now \u2014\nand so we \u2014 we really started living a normal life. We went to movies, American\nmovies that were being played at \u2014 at that time. And it lasted until about 1943,\nsomething like that, and then they started liquidating the camps because all the\npeople were moved away to different \u2014 different locations. And my mother then\nreceived a \u2014 a proposal to go into town and work for the Polish unit that was taking\ncare of the \u2014 of the refugees and things. And so we moved into the city of Teheran.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nWe rented actually, an apartment \u2014 a \u2014 a room 1n the \u2014 in a \u2014 in Teheran itself, and\nmy mother was working and I started to go \u2014 and I was going to school, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014to a Polish school. And we lived not too far away from another friend of ours\nthat is right now in San Francisco, and we had great time, because \u2014 because we\nwere \u2014 the \u2014 the camp in which actually the sc \u2014 because the \u2014 they kept liquidating\nthe schools, and finally ne \u2014 and \u2014 and that was camp number three. And that was\nlocated in the mountains, very beautiful area. And we\u2019d have a bus that would take\nus there, and in the evening we would be driven back again. And so I went through\n\u2014 through the grade school, and in \u2014 in 1945, when we moved to 1 \u2014 to Lebanon, I\nwas already in first grade of high school.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah, 13 - 14\u2014-",
        "A: Right. Right on schedule, I was 14. And so I remember that, you know, we had \u2014\nwe had great time, because several of us lived in \u2014 in a city by then, and we c \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015\ncould get together, go to the movies, and \u2014 and you know, and visit the bazaars, and\n\u2014and really had great time.",
        "A: Absolutely, yeah, show my \u2014 my [indecipherable]. But absolutely adventurous,\nbecause we were \u2014 we were taken one time to visit the Shah\u2019s palace.",
        "A: And I also remember that we were returning one time, and I don\u2019t know what \u2014\nhow \u2014 how was it, but we decided to walk. It wasn\u2019t that far away, so we were\nwalking on \u2014 on the road towards Teheran, and here comes the Shah. So we waved,\nyou know, and all that stuff, and he \u2014",
        "A: Yes, in \u2014 in a limousine, you know, motorcades and all that kind stuff. So \u2014 and\nhe must have realized that \u2014 who we are, because he wa \u2014 you know, waved back.\nSo, you know, he \u2014 then \u2014 then we absolutely felt like free people. A-And our \u2014 our\n\u2014 our wrong [indecipherable] was over. And so \u2014 so \u2014 you know, then, towards the\nend of \u2014 almost at the end of the war, in July of 1945, because everything was being\nliquidated and, you know, the British and the Americans were going to move out of\nthere too, we were taken by train to Baghdad in Iraq. And there we had to stay for\n100January 21, 2015\ntwo weeks because something happened with our visa, transitory visa through \u2014\nthrough one of the countries.",
        "A: To Baghdad.",
        "A: And then from \u2014 from Baghdad we went to Lebanon, and we went in \u2014 in\nbuses, all the way to \u2014 to Beirut.",
        "A: A couple days. It was \u2014 it was quite the trip.",
        "A: Sand and sand and sand. It was a real desert. Until we came to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nLebanon. And Lebanon 1s \u2014 1s beautiful. It\u2019s green, you know, the \u2014 the mountains\nare \u2014 are beautiful, and so it was completely different land \u2014 you know, landscape\nonce we entered the territory of Lebanon. So from \u2014 from bay \u2014 from Baghdad I\nremember that we had an opportunity to visit the \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the\nmarketplaces, the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, and it was \u2014 it was really quite an experience,\nand I \u2014 I don\u2019t know where I have it, but I bought myself a \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 one of these\nknifes, you know, that you \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 you See [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, the curved knife, I still have it. So \u2014",
        "A: No, this was already beginning of the international ref-refugee organization.",
        "A: Because that was the end of the war, and all of a sudden they had refugees all\nover Europe, so they formed this international refugee organization, and they took\nover the administration.",
        "A: So, once we moved to \u2014 to Beirut, and we stayed couple \u2014 couple weeks in \u2014 in\na transitory camp in Beirut itself, and then we were moved to a small town called\nGhazir(ph), just north of \u2014 of Beirut, in the mountains. And at that time we were\ngiven some substis \u2014 subsistence money so we could go on our own. So we became\nself-sufficient, and we had to supply ourselves with food and \u2014 and \u2014 and, you\nknow, and clothing and \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Stopped.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And \u2014 and in Lebanon, the \u2014 one of the \u2014 as I understand, one of the agreements\nwith the Lebanese government was that the people that are coming in are not going\nto become part of the economy of the \u2014 of Lebanon. But they are \u2014 they are going\nto be self-sufficient. So \u2014 so that\u2019s we \u2014 that\u2019s why we are needing the subsistence,\nSO we can live on our own.",
        "A: Until 1950.",
        "A: Five years. Yes, so I graduated, and I graduated from, you know Polish \u2014 Polish\neducational system is divided into high school, and [indecipherable]. And high\nschool lasted for years, and then [indecipherable] la-la \u2014 was the other \u2014 the other\ntwo years. And \u2014\n103\nJanuary 21, 2015",

        "A: Right. Tha \u2014 this was \u2014 it was issued by the \u2014 by the division of \u2014 of \u2014 like \u2014 like\na \u2014 like education department of the Polish [indecipherable] in Beirut, on 25\" of \u2014\nof April, 1950. So \u2014",
        "A: Right. So I\u2014I did get some okay thing. Good \u2014 good, and some, you know,\n[indecipherable] what do you call this, like in high school, the \u2014 this \u2014 the \u2014 the\nbest sta \u2014",
        "A: Excellent.",
        "A: Very good, so even from \u2014 from chemistry, technical wri \u2014 thing. Geometry. I\nhad a very good [indecipherable]. That\u2019s what forces me to go into engineering in\nschool.\n104January 21, 2015",
        "A: Oh, and this is \u2014 this is the \u2014 this is when I graduated from \u2014 from four years of\nhigh school.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: 1948.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right, but it \u2014 this was \u2014 this wa \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 after people started leaving there,\ntoo, they started liquidating different camps, and so we had to move from Ghazir,\nwhich is in the mountains, to Zouk(ph), which was on the bay. And so this is 1948,\nplus two years, 1950.",
        "A: Oh no, we had \u2014 we \u2014 yes, we rented rooms. So we were really on our own.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes, well, en-enough to \u2014 to form several schools. Like there was one in \u2014 in\nGhazir, there was one in Zouk and there was one in \u2014 1n the mountains on the other\nside of Beirut. And t-then they started liquidating, and everything was then put into\n\u2014into Zouk.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes, you know, I \u2014 in a way that th-they were friendly people, and th-\nthey were \u2014 they were really amazingly capable of learning languages, because you\nknow, they had a long history of being traders. And so this \u2014 so this became a\nnatural with them. So most of the people that had any \u2014 any shops in like \u2014 in\nGhazir, they s \u2014 they spoke adequate Polish to tell you that, for example, they\nwould c-call, pig missus, pig missus. It wasn\u2019t that the missus was a pig, but they\nkilled the pig, and they were selling the meat. So \u2014 so \u2014 but \u2014 but they were very,\nvery nice, very polite, and a friend of mine who lives in Australia was telling me\nyears later that she moved to Australia and \u2014 and she met a \u2014 an Arab from \u2014 from\nGhazir. And so she \u2014 the \u2014 he emigrated after her, and they got married in \u2014 in\nAustralia. And then years later, in \u2014 in 1980s or something like that, the three\nsisters that \u2014 that lived there decided to make a round world trip. And they went\nfrom \u2014 they went from Australia, first stop was Lebanon. And they were walking\non the streets of this town of Ghazir and an Arab comes to them, and of course they\n106January 21, 2015\nla \u2014 they look different. And so the \u2014 he says, what are you ladies doing in here?\nAnd my friend says, well, I\u2019m the wife of, you know, this \u2014 this [indecipherable]\nyou know, we are Polish, we lived here. Oh, you are Polish. So you \u2014 stands at\nattention, and starts singing Polish national anthem.",
        "A: He remembered, all these years. So they are \u2014 they\u2019re really fantastic people.\nAnd \u2014 you know, and we never, never had anything that we would be afraid of. We\nlived among them, being scout, we \u2014 we went on \u2014 on the trips, you know, just\nwalking trips around Lebanon, and we never had any problem at all.",
        "A: Some. Yo-You know enough to kind of get \u2014 get along it, and \u2014 but of course,\nover the years of not using it, it \u2014 it \u2014 it just disappears. I just remember Leban \u2014\nLebanese national anthem.",
        "A: But \u2014 but you know, it \u2014 they were really very friendly people and they were \u2014\nafter the first World War they were under what they called French protectorate. So\nall \u2014 almost everyone spoke French. There was also American university in \u2014 1n \u20141n\npa \u2014 in \u2014 in \u20141n Beirut, and some of our older members of the school went to study\nin there, and \u2014 but then, you know, towards the \u2014 the 1950 \u2014\n107\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Well, she was \u2014 she \u2014 you know, we were \u2014 we were given the money, but she\nstarted working for, you know, with the school, doing all kinds of things, being able\nto paint, you know, she would \u2014 she would take care, and she was really taking care\nof like a \u2014 like a club for children, and they were dancing, and things like that. So\nshe was busy all the time. You know, she \u2014 she had things to do.",
        "A: No. I think after you go through something like that, you could have done all the\ndesperation in two years. The rest of it was a wonderful life, basically. You know,\nof course you didn\u2019t know anything about your husband, you were lonely, no\nfamily, and \u2014 but there are people like you that became, you know, part of your\ncircle. And so she never despaired, and \u2014 and | think she \u2014 she was \u2014 she was too\nbusy to \u2014 to think. And then besides, she could \u2014 she could, you know, embroider,\nso she would embroider. She wrote poems, which \u2014 which I have, you know. And\nso she was quite a positive type of person. So \u2014 so anyway, so after \u2014 after all this\nwas done and \u2014 and told her that \u2014 that they were trying to relocate the people as\nsoon as possible so they can start normal life, because this was not a normal life.\n108\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: So finally in \u2014 1n a \u2014 in 1950, towards the \u2014 the end of 1950, in July in fact, Her\nMajesty the queen decided to accept us as \u2014 as being capable of going to the\nterritory of the \u2014 of Great Britain.",
        "A: No, no, this was all done between the Polish government and the British. They \u2014\nthey realized that they have to remove those people from Lebanon because they\nhad \u2014 they had an agreement that they won\u2019t work. So what do you \u2014",
        "A: No, that can\u2019t happen forever. So they decided that the best way is to simply\nbring them to \u2014 to real life. Really real life, not what we have for life for the last\nnumber of years. So, we were load \u2014 loaded on the shi \u2014 on the military ship. And\nyou know, on a transport ship in Beirut, and moved across the Mediterranean Sea\nand up north to \u2014 to Great Britain, and we were unloaded with \u2014 in the \u2014 the port\nof Hull, h-u-l-l, and then transported to a military camp, a post-military camp in\nnorthern England, on the border with Scotland.",

And there was a \u2014 the Polish [indecipherable] units\nformed a \u2014 like a \u2014 like a organization, and one of those things that they were doing\nwas \u2014 was employment. And so I went to their employment office and \u2014",
        "A: Yes. Oh, by the way, I\u20141I\u2014 we did learn English in Lebanon. We had the\nLebanese professor who was teaching us. So I-I \u2014 I cannot say I was fluent, but I\nwas capable of communicating quite well \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",

And so, when I moved\nto London, I was with Rilka(ph) for a little while, and then she arranged for me to\ngo to a youth hostel, and I was working in a youth hostel. So I started looking for\njob and \u2014 and the \u2014 the guy said, well, there\u2019s something that you can \u2014 you can do,\nthere is some factory that you can go in. So I went for an interview and the\ngentleman that was interviewing me, he said, what do you want to do in life? And I\nsaid, what \u2014 I would like to be an engineer. And he says, oh, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m looking\nfor a worker, not for an engineer. So \u2014",
        "A: I suppose. But \u2014 so I was \u2014 I was \u2014 I had to go back, and they said, you know,\nthere is \u2014 there is a \u2014 an office of a \u2014 of a\u2014 a Polish American, who was born in \u2014 in\nUnited States, but was educated in Poland. He became an engineer, and he worked\nin the Polish corps of engineer in \u2014 when \u2014 during the campaign in \u2014 in Italy, and\nthere he met a British engineer who was working for the British corps of engineers,\nand they formed fre \u2014 friendship, and they decided that they liked each other so\nmuch that ti \u2014 after \u2014 after the war, they opened an office. And that office was to\nconvert many of the residences of London into flats.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: So they were doing this kind of work, and when I \u2014 when I went for an\ninterview, the gentleman said yes \u2014 and because I \u2014 and when I graduated from high\nschool, there was an Polish engineer who taught the boys the drafting. So I knew\nabout eng-engineering drawings, I knew about drafting, I know about, you know,\nthings. And so he gave me the opportunity to work for them, as my first engineering\njob.",
        "A: And it was really fantastic, because, you know \u2014 but my mother told me in the\nbeginning of my career that, just remember to \u2014 when you work for someone, take a\nletter of recommendation from the person. And so they \u2014 so I\u2014 when I was in\nLondon mat \u2014 from \u2014 I think from September or something like that, and we left for\nthe United States in the beginning of February \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of 1951. So we were in England only several months. And what happened is\nthat my mother had ta \u2014 three uncles. My \u2014 my grandmother came from a family of\n12.\n112\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s my \u2014 my grandmother had \u2014 had 11 siblings.",
        "A: And \u2014 and three of those siblings, all boys, escaped to the United States in \u2014\nbefore the beginning of the second war \u2014 or the first World War. Because, when\nyou are drafted into the Russian army, your career lasted 25 years, so all your life,\nbasically. And so they didn\u2019t want to \u2014 to do that, and these \u2014 they \u2014 they came to\nthe United States, and one of them settled in Baltimore, and the other one settled\nin \u2014 in Ohio, and the third one somewhere in Ohio also. And when we \u2014 when we\nleft Russia, my mother somehow reestablished contact with him, and \u2014 Uncle\nMiczestaw(ph) and he asked her, couple years later, if we would be wanting maybe\nto emigrate to the United States, and my mother said yes. But in those days, they \u2014\nthey had the visa \u2014 no-not the visa, but they had like every nationality had a number\nof places assigned.",
        "A: A quota.",
        "A: And so she \u2014 the Polish quota was always, you know, taken up. So we just\nsimply waiting all this period, from, you know, we \u2014 we started doing this in\nTeheran, and he had to write the affidavits and all that kind of stuff \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",

And so\nwe were \u2014 we were granted the visa, as part of the 18,000 permissions. And so on \u2014\non February \u2014 beginning of February, we were loaded onto one of Her Majesty\u2019s\nships, and shipped from Liverpool to London \u2014 to \u2014 to New York.

        "A: In Pittsburgh, and then he took us bri \u2014 by car to his house, and we st \u2014 we were\nstaying with them. Unfortunately, the first experience was not the most satisfactory,\nbecause after about four months \u2014 and I started working in \u2014 in ice cream factory, I\nwas making the Popsicles. But this was my \u2014 my first job. And after about four\nmonths, my uncle called my mother and he says, you know, my wife, your aunt, and\nyou just don\u2019t seem to be getting too well together. So, he says, you know, you \u2014\nyou have to leave.",
        "A: So, we started looking for a place, you know, since I was already employed. We\nstarted looking for a place, but then my mother decided to call the uncle that lives in\n\u2014 lived in Baltimore, and maybe they could just take us for, you know\n[indecipherable] four months, you know, just a new country, everything \u2014 so wi \u2014\nthe cousin came in and she looked us over, and she decided we\u2019re okay, and so \u2014",

Sparrows Point was where they had the shipyards, and \u2014 and the \u2014 the \u2014 you\nknow, regular steel company thing.

        "A: \u2014 in what I wanted to do, you know, so it just fantastic. And when I \u2014 when I\ncame back, my aunt says, your mother isn\u2019t here any more. She rented an apartment\nJanuary 21, 2015\nand she \u2014 she\u2019s waiting for you with \u2014 with supper, so you better go over there. So I\n\u2014 from that point on we were \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 some \u2014 wanted to do, I wanted to do the engineering. And so, soon as possible,\nI \u2014I signed up for the civil engineering studies, the evening of course, at Johns\nHopkins University in Baltimore. So I\u2019d work, come back from work, go to\nschool. And I completed quite a number of courses, and then in 19 \u2014 middle \u2014\ntowards the end of 1954, I got the papers from U.S. military that I\u2019m being drafted.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That\u2019s another story.\n120January 21, 2015",
        "A: So, I was finally drafted in the beginning of 1955, and after \u2014 after the basic\ntraining of eight weeks, our regiment was shipped to Germany. Because at that\ntime, the regiment that was there \u2014 and it was \u2014 they had the \u2014 the duties of \u2014 of \u2014 of\n\u2014 of watching the border.",
        "A: East-west border, yes. And that regiment stayed there as \u2014 as \u2014 regiment as a,\nyou know, unit, all the time from the be \u2014 the end of the war until 1955, beginning.\nAnd then they decided to exchange the units, move second regiment back to sh \u2014 to\n\u2014 to the United States, and us, as a whole regiment, ship over there. So we were\nshipped as a regiment to Germany. And since I got the job as a \u2014 as a regimental\ndraftsman, of course, I was in a headquarters of the regiment in \u2014 in Nuremberg,\nwhereas the \u2014 the battalions were sh \u2014 were s-stationed around the border. So it was\n\u2014 it was interesting because it was different kinds of draftsmanship.",
        "A: Doing military plans when they they were doing their, you know, their exercises,\nI had to \u2014 to \u2014 to document where they\u2019re going to be, and what time, and what\nunits and all that kind of stuff. It got to be [indecipherable]. So I worked \u2014 I was\nworking there. And I remember one \u2014 one time, the sergeant of \u2014 of the S-2 section,\nJanuary 21, 2015\nwhich is the intelligence section, comes to \u2014 to \u2014 to the room that I was occupying,\nand he looks at me, and he looks at \u2014 at the \u2014 the plans that I am working on, and he\nsays, are you a U.S. citizen? And I said no. So he said, oh my God. He runs to the\ncolonel, tells him the story, and the colonel does whatever necessary, and within\ntwo weeks, I was shipped to Frankfurt, Germany, where the American consulate\nwas, with two sergeants that swore that they knew me since.",
        "A: No. And I was given the U.S. citizenship. So \u2014 so \u2014 so when I came back from\nthe army, I was, you know, I was already \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 a registered citizen. And \u2014 and it really helped me quite a bit because sometime\nlater the same sergeant comes in and he says, do you speak a little Russian? And I\nsaid yes, I do. And he says, oh, would you like to go to a refresher course in\nRussia\u2019? And I say yes, of course. So I was shipped, for three weeks of Russian\nrefresher course, in Oberammergau, Germany, and you probably know\nOberammergau is a place where every 10 years they give the \u2014 the Easter thing.",
        "A: Passion Play.\n122January 21, 2015",
        "A: And it is a beautiful, beautiful town where everybody there is a sculptor. They\nsculpt, you know, in wood. So I spent three weeks with \u2014 with the military\nintelligence refresher course. And it was amazing experience for me because the \u2014\nthe people that were with me, they were from \u2014 you know, from private through\nmajor.",
        "A: And all of them went through the army school of languages, and they want \u2014 an-\nand you know all these people were going \u2014 if necessary were going to be used as\ninterrogators of the prisoners of war. So their basic Russian was based on the\nmilitary requirements, you know, in other words, what \u2014 what do you ask, you\nknow \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and all that kind of stuff. So they \u2014 they had to maintain their skill. So they\nwere there and the first few days, you know, they were way ahead of me. And then,\nall of a sudden, s-s-started clicking, you know.",
        "A: My first grade started clicking back. And by the time we were e \u2014 we were\nfinished, I was way ahead of them, because my pronunciation was [indecipherable]\nbetter than th-theirs.

        "A: And so I had that remembrance, so I went to one of the sculptors, and I said, did\nyou ever make the sculpture of Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus? And he says, no,\nbut that\u2019s interesting. He says, come, come, come, come. So he took me to his \u2014 to\nhis workplace, and he starts pulling out the books, trying to figure out, you know.\nAnd he finds a \u2014 a picture of lady \u2014 Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus. And he says,\nyou know, Pll \u2014PIl\u2014TIl put you on rock \u2014 o-on the rock and \u2014 and\n[indecipherable] this, and she\u2019s going to be feeding baby Jesus. Is that \u2014 is that\nwhat you want? Excuse me, ca-can you sneak out and go and get that sculpture?",
        "A: So this 1s the \u2014 this is the sculpture that he made.",
        "A: And \u2014 and th-there are only two of those like that. One painted, and the other one\njust as in wood. And he sent me both, to \u2014 to the \u2014 to \u2014 to Nuremberg, and he says,\nwhich one do you want? And I bought both, and the other one I send to my cousin\nin Poland. So they have that.\n124January 21, 2015",
        "A: But \u2014 but all \u2014 you know, the only thing that he showed me was this po \u2014 upper\npart. And the rest of it, with her putting her li \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] on doing \u2014 and doing, that was all she \u2014 all his interpretation.\nAnd so, this 1s what \u2014 what I remember from Oberammergau.",
        "A: Yes. But, you know, that \u2014 basically, you know, I \u2014 I found out that most\nAmericans are not interested in that, because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s so far away from their\nbackground, from their pe \u2014 that you s-simply do not understand, that how in the\nheck \u2014 excuse me \u2014 my English \u2014 you can come to somebody\u2019s home at two o\u2019clock\nin the morning and take him away, and leave everything \u2014 you know, you leave\neverything behind. It was just in \u2014 incomprehensible. And so there \u2014 they were not\ninterested. And so therefore, you know, I just kept it to myself, and I don\u2019t have\nanything against it, because it is so different. You know, how do you explain to \u2014 to\npeople that never experienced any kind of a \u2014 of [indecipherable] with authorities,\nthat somebody can come to your house at two o\u2019clock in the morning and take you\nJanuary 21, 2015\naway, leave all your things behind, and, you know. But \u2014 but I explained to \u2014 to this\n\u2014 to these guys, and they accepted what it was.",
        "A: Well, because I was wer \u2014 working for the regiment.",
        "A: And the regiment was on the border, so they needed people that were familiar\nwith the language, just in case \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1f some \u2014 something should happen, each unit had a translator that could\ninterrogate the people. And here\u2019s a guy that not only that experienced being there \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and knowing the people. And so I was very grateful. But then I suffered some\n\u2014 somehow, later on, because whenever we would go to Canada, and I take my\ncitizenship papers with me, I was always stopped on the border, and I \u2014 and there\nwas also a telephone call made to Washington, because my \u2014 my paper, my \u2014 my\ncitizenship paper is not the normal thing. It does not have my photograph, it does\nnot have sig \u2014 signature of \u2014 of \u2014 of a judge. It has a signature of Consul General of\nthe United States and Frankfurt, Germany, and it just doesn\u2019t sound normal. So \u2014\n126January 21, 2015",
        "A: So it was \u2014 it was always checked, and finally I decided, what am I doing, why\ndon\u2019t I just get a passport and be done with it.",
        "A: And I did and ever since then I was \u2014 it was okay.",
        "A: So, you know, a-all these experiences add up to \u2014 to a\u2014 I would say a rather\ninteresting life, if you want to call it that way. And then, when I was drafted into the\narmy, I decided to move my mother to Chicago, because here we \u2014 we have many\nmore friends and people that we \u2014 acquaintances that we had from the past. And so\nI moved her, and then I went back and was drafted. And when I was released I came\nback, and I restarted my studies at Illinois Institute of Technology, and I started\nworking as a draftsman for engineering firms. And my first firm of employment\nwas a fi \u2014 was a firm of \u2014 in \u2014 in which our chief engineer was Lithuanian. And\nmost of the draftsmen were lith \u2014 were Lithuanians.

        "A: No.\n127January 21, 2015",
        "A: No, no, and interesting thing is that \u2014 that once the Polish army had left Soviet\nUnion, the Soviet Union formed another army, which was the \u2014 an \u2014 a new\ngovernment \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of Lublin, and a new army. And that army fought with the Soviet Union, and\na \u2014 you know, participated in the liberation of Poland. And of course, the Anders\u2019\nArmy was a traitor. So \u2014 but it was \u2014 it was, you know, an interesting experience,\nbecause I already had something to show. That not only that I did get the document\nfrom \u2014 from the army that I worked as a draftsman, so \u2014 and when I \u2014 when I came\nto the \u2014 to \u2014 to Chicago, I started working for several firms, and the wa \u2014 and again\nfor U.S. Steel Corporation, because th \u2014 I was already with experience from \u2014\nfrom \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 from Baltimore, from Bethlehem Steel. And I worked in different engineering\nfirms until 1978. And in \u201978, I\u2014I read an advertisement in a civil engineering\nmagazine, a re \u2014 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had been looking\nfor personnel. And so I went for an interview, and because my background was civil\nengineering, and it was also in \u2014 in \u2014 1n dams, because the last firm that I was\nworking for was a firm of Dr. Bauer(ph), who had, you know, his doctorate in\n128January 21, 2015\nhydraulics, and so I worked on \u2014 on things. And so I was accepted. And so in 1978\nuntil 2008, for 30 years, I worked for U.S. un-unit. And that was really fantastic\nexperience, too, because we \u2014 there were five offices like that, and Chicago office\nhad the Middle East \u2014 the mi\u2014 mi \u2014 middle west.",
        "A: And so we had, you know, a number of dams. And so, all these thir \u2014 30 years\nthat I worked, I haven\u2019t visited all the \u2014 all the dams.",

And most of them were to\nliquidate people that were undesirables, which was Poles, and the Jews, and there\nwas \u2014 there was a story about this transport that was being taken in one of the\ncamps, and the people were led into the camp, and there was a \u2014 a Jewish mother,\nand four or five year old little boy. And they were walking in and \u2014 and at the gate\nstands the \u2014 the Gestapo officer, dressed up in beautiful uniform, with the ha \u2014 with\nthe hat and \u2014 and the long boots, and \u2014 and \u2014 and the [indecipherable] you know,\n140January 21, 2015\nthat he was kind of hitting his \u2014 his leg with it.

So the boy just pulls away from his \u2014 from his\nmother\u2019s hand and runs to the officer and offers him the only thing that he has in\nlife, an apple. And the officer smiles at the child, takes the apple, bends over, grabs\nhim by the hands and \u2014 and kills him on the spot. How do you explain that? How do\nyou explain the fact that pole \u2014 no, hun \u2014 thousands of Polish officers were\nmurdered by NKVD, by killing them with a bullet in his \u2014 in the back of their head?\nYou know, it was just a very simple thing, right. Next, next. Then you go home, you\nhave supper. You put your child on \u2014 on your lap, tell him the story. And next day\nyou go and do the same thing. Impossible to believe that human beings are capable\nof that. Am I to \u2014 to \u2014 to remember all these things all the time, and accuse all the\npeople of the \u2014 being possible to do that? No, it \u2014 1t was circumstances. But\ncircumstances like that, there are hundreds of them, you know, that people can be\ncapable of such barbarity, and it \u2014 in a civilized nation.

They were all back to normal\npeople, you know, and you \u2014 nobod \u2014 nobody knew. They just didn\u2019t know that\nsomething like that was happening. Which is, of course, something else.
