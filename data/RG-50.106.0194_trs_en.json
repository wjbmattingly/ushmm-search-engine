        "A: Not at all, not at all. Until the, there was like a big parade staged by the government. And they\nhad, they had soldiers singing and you know about victory and what not and that they were\nmarching with the cannons that were driven by horses and cows and all that. It was a very\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011\nprimitive. Today it would be laughable. But they felt very strong and mighty. They never\nsuspected that they would be, that you know taken over by anybody.",
        "Q: And that would have been when, in 41?",
        "A: No this would have been already in 1940. And my mother got very panicky about this whole\nthing because some rumors. They must have gotten of people being taken out of their homes and\nto places unknown you know. And she had family. She had cousins all over Yugoslavia. They\nwere not taken from Yugoslavia. The right then and there but she heard rumors and so she took it\nseriously and she said my children and I are going to my father. He says you settle your business\nand we are going to, and you will join us. And we started going towards the west, towards west.",
        "Q: Towards the coast?",
        "A: Towards the coast.",
        "Q: But your parents must have been aware for example of what was happening in 1938 with the\nannexation of Austria by the German Reich. Was that \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s possible, yes it\u2019s possible that they knew. Maybe they saw it in the newspaper. Maybe\nthey said oh well it\u2019s not us so it\u2019s whatever you know. And life just went on.",
        "Q: So when did your mother decide that it was time to leave?",

        "Q: Where were you when the war broke out in Yugoslavia?",
        "A: We were away from Belgrade. We were never there when they came to bomb the city. The\nGermans came unannounced, obviously. That was their way. They never declared war on the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011\ncountry. They just came with the airplanes and they bombed them and then we just had to pick\nup the pieces. I mean news. Find out who was hit and who wasn\u2019t hit, but we were away.",

My mother wanted to go away and so we went with her.",
        "Q: Was the notion that there was a threat to you because you were Jewish or that there was a\ngeneral threat to people in Yugoslavia?",
        "A: It was mostly a general threat.",

        "A: Nobody. They looked at my mother as though she was crazy to leave. And all the way she\nhad family. She had family in Sarajevo and in some other cities, not such a close family. She\nwould stop there and she would tell them that they should leave. They should go. And they said\nyou are crazy. There is no, no need to worry to get panicky about it. And so we went and they\ndid not survive.",

        "Q: What did he do to protect his factory while he would be away?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. I know that he tried to get some money so that we would\nhave, we would have some money with us.",
        "Q: So he tried to sell it?",
        "A: Possibly. Or he told his brother to sell it because his brother was not going anyplace and he\nwas married to a Gentile woman and they had a baby. They were afraid. They said how can we\ngo, you know. We had, wouldn\u2019t have milk, wouldn\u2019t have you know a lot of things that today\npeople wouldn\u2019t worry about, they were concerned.",
        "Q: What happened to them?",
        "A: He was killed not her, not the girl.",
        "Q: And the baby survived too?",
        "A: The baby survived til she killed herself years later. Yeah, it was a tragic thing. She didn\u2019t\nknow where she belonged. She didn\u2019t know. Her mother tried to be married and it wasn\u2019t good.\nShe married a drunken guy you know. And my parents stayed in touch with them and told them\nto sell whatever they found that was \u2014 we had nice things at home. We were not that poor, poor\nyou know, we had nice, nice paintings. Nice and they told her she should sell and use the money\nfor her needs. And Melita, that\u2019s the girl\u2019s name. she grew up in that kind of an atmosphere.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011\nHer, after her mother remarried, didn\u2019t work out and the stepfather was probably not so nice to\nher and that, that thing broke off. And they survived. They lived til she killed herself.",
        "Q: Which was when?",
        "A: That was when she was already in her 20s.",
        "Q: So after the war?",
        "A: After the war, yes. In fact she was already married and she had a daughter. Yes, she was\nmarried to a Gentile man and eventually that marriage didn\u2019t work out and I think that everybody\nwas messed up by the circumstances. She missed her father terribly and she didn\u2019t know where\nshe belonged, whether she was Jewish or what, you know. And her daughter was very smart and\nall that. She was in touch with us for quite a while and then she was so self-conscious of her\nEnglish that she stopped writing us and she could write. She could write and keep in touch. That\nwas Ragena.",

        "A: We didn\u2019t have a plan. We were just going you know. Wherever the train would take us, they\nwould, we stop, wherever we would be closest to the ships going to Italy. And at the time there\nwas one town there that I don\u2019t even recall the name and from there we encountered the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011\nUstashes, who searched us thoroughly but not that they didn\u2019t search the children. And my\nmother had made because you know the bank notes, the Yugoslav bank notes were huge. In\norder to have anything there you had to really hide them somehow. And we had those things on\nus and so did my brother, my sister. They only searched the grownups and they had nothing on\nthem so they had nothing to take. And they eventually let us go.",
        "Q: But they were not looking for Jews in \u2014",
        "A: They were. And there they were.",
        "Q: And your parents had fake papers or \u2014",
        "A: No, no we didn\u2019t have fake papers. I don\u2019t know how did that, maybe they paid off\nsomebody. You know it\u2019s possible but I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. They kept us from all\nthat kind of -- well I was ten and a half. You know today we tell our kids much more than they\nused to.",
        "Q: So where did you stop on the way to Dubrovnik? You stopped in Sarajevo with your family.",
        "A: Just passing through, passing through and I don\u2019t know how that was done because we didn\u2019t\nhave a car. We just had to go by train.",

        "Q: So Italy was considered safe at the time?",
        "A: Italy was our, you know our next stop. That\u2019s what we felt, we felt that it was safer going in\nthat direction than in the opposite direction so \u2014",
        "Q: Do you have any ideas why?",
        "A: No that\u2019s a good question. That\u2019s a good question.",
        "Q: Was there may be a plan to go to Palestine at all or to go to America?",
        "A: No, no, no, no absolutely not no. Italy was the final destination.",
        "Q: So how did you get to Italy?",
        "A: Well the ship. There was a ship going from the coast, the Dalmatia coast to the, you know the\nAdriatic. We crossed the Adriatic and we were there and they said what do you expect to, we\nshould do with you. We don\u2019t, we can\u2019t let you in. you\u2019re not \u2014",

        "Q: Did you have a visa for Italy?",
        "A: Nothing. We, as far as I know we didn\u2019t have anything. What my mother had I don\u2019t know.\nWell\u2014and she never, we never spoke about it. We never asked questions unfortunately. And\nthat\u2019s how it was.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of the town in Italy where you \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",
        "A: Yes we stayed in, they eventually brought us to Vicenza. In Vicenza in the Veneto region. We\nwere able to rent an apartment.",
        "Q: But tell us before how you got into Italy because that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: That, I don\u2019t even know.",
        "Q: You said you didn\u2019t have any visas or possibly not.",
        "A: They let us go. They took, they had my parents sign all kinds of things. They had my parents\ngive up all the money that they had for their safe keeping.",
        "Q: So that was the Italian authorities when you arrived?",
        "A: The Italian authorities. They were holding, though that money was not stolen from us. It was\ntaken with the idea that we could not be on the government expense but we were just, they would\ngive us what we needed for every day you know. That. And \u2014",
        "Q: That was in Vicenza or?",
        "A: That was prior to Vicenza. It was still prior to Vicenza, still on the border line with Fiume\n[ph] . It was I think few, near Rijeka. That\u2019s what it was.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s where you went. From Dubrovnik you went to Rijeka.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s where you crossed?",

        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know whether money did it. Whether, whatever. We were not alone.\nYou know we were a group of maybe 50, 75 people.",
        "Q: So who were the other people?",
        "A: The other people. Some that we knew, that my parents knew and we didn\u2019t but apparently\nthey were all leaving.",

        "Q: Did you have to report in Vicenza regularly to the police authorities?",
        "A: No. I think I suspect that maybe my father had to sign something or where we had to report\nwas in Sandrigo. We stayed in Vicenza for maybe less than a year because I know they had a\nterrible winter that we didn\u2019t experience in Belgrade. We came out with all those things, geloni,\nwhat they called geloni. I remember so it had to be winter time. They gave us some, what do you\ncall it cards to buy food.",

I tell you the\ntruth. We had fun. I used to go to the marketing such as it was. And my mother on the fourth or\nfifth floor threw us always a basket down which we filled. She pulled it up and then you know it\nwas a kind of leisurely, leisurely life. The place was enclosed by a big gate. This is what, in Italy\nthey have a lot of, had a lot of such places. In that when you walked in there was a fountain.\nYou know that\u2019s where the people used to get their water. And then it was this long stairway\ngoing up. And we brought our water and we did all these things. And she was good to us. And of\ncourse she was alone and I guess money was, helped her.

        "A: No.",
        "Q: You were the only one who went to Vicenza?",
        "A: We were the only one as far as I know. I don\u2019t remember anybody else. Eventually when we\ngo back to Sandrigo we were able to find out what happened to some of our others. They were in\nFerramonte, which was down south in a camp. But not, it wasn\u2019t a concentration camp. It was\njust a camp where people were living in little homes like. You know but nothing, nothing\nhorrible. They were just there, detained you know.",

        "A: No, not allowed to go to school. We were not allowed to go to a movie. All that what it was,\nbut it wasn\u2019t a big hardship. I mean we welcomed the freedom, the kids were, we couldn\u2019t go\ntraveling around but you know we made, we met the people and we made some acquaintances.\nNot friendships, you couldn\u2019t really.",
        "Q: Did your parents make an effort to learn Italian?",
        "A: Yes, yes and we did too. And I remember that I used to, my favorite word was Capisco,\nCapisco. I always said Capisco. I could tell them that I did understand what they were saying.\nYou know. I was very proud of learning the new language.",
        "Q: Were you afraid at all during that time?",
        "A: No. No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",
        "Q: Were your parents concerned?",
        "A: They were not settled there. They would always tell us you know don\u2019t go there because this\nis just a temporary thing. Don\u2019t think that this is where we\u2019re staying. This is a temporary thing.\nSomeday we\u2019re going to go home. That\u2019s what they felt, that we, so they tried to keep us, keep a\nlow profile you know until things got resolved. But no big fear of being Jewish. What we did\nfind over there which was very interesting for us was the Ballilla [Fascist Youth].",
        "Q: What\u2019s that?",

        "A: In the street, marching and we looked at them and we realized, we asked questions you know.\nFrom the \u2014 and that\u2019s who they were. And they were different groups. You know. The little ones\nand they had, you could distinguish them by the color of their uniform or whatever. And that\nwas kind of at the time I didn\u2019t know. You know I mean I took it for what it was. We didn\u2019t have\nit in Belgrade, obviously. So later on of course you could tell that this is what 1t was. Just a brain\nwashing situation. This is what you get the children. You get \u2014",
        "Q: Was there, were there any controls in the street? Were you ever asked to identify yourselves\nor \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no, that\u2019s why there was \u2014",
        "Q: So being Jewish was not a problem?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",
        "A: Not at all, not at all. The only time when being Jewish was possibly something there in\nSandrigo because there were only Jews being detained there. You know. We were all Jews. The\ngroup was all Jewish.",
        "Q: How did you decide to go to Sandrigo? How did that happen?",
        "A: They told us to, that this is where we are going.",

        "Q: How did your parents accept the news of being moved again to another place?",
        "A: Fine. We learned to pack fast you know. Packing, unpacking. We used to make a joke about\nit because it was forever packing and unpacking. We didn\u2019t know what was going on. No it\nwasnt.",

        "Q: So you were in Vicenza from autumn 1940 until March 1942.",
        "A: Well on the west coast of Yugoslavia waiting for this boat that, it took a while. Because I\nremember by the trees. Because we rented an apartment there and the lady had orange trees, the\nwild oranges in her yard from that year and they were already out you know so I guess it was\npast spring and all that. The time was going. We were playing and we were waiting.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",
        "Q: So you left Belgrade a little bit earlier than we thought. You left Belgrade then in early\nsummer and then you spend the summer in Dubrovnik?",

        "Q: Was it dangerous to be outside?",
        "A: Maybe. We didn\u2019t realize. Maybe it was. Because we had our documents whatever you\nknow they told us that this is well you respond to this name. And that was it. And you know by\nthen we already learned language. We were speaking the language and all but did the Germans\nknow whether the Italian was correct or not. They didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t care about that. My\nbrother was very, because he was rebellious. He wanted out you know.

He was a journalist for the Corriere della Sera [an important newspaper\nin Italy]. He was coming home and suddenly they threw grenade from the window on a truck\nwith Germans and they did a lot of damage. They killed a lot of people. So the Germans closed\nthe street on both ends. And everybody that was walking there, took them into basement. They\nbeat them up. They interrogated them. And first they pushed them down the stairs. Not letting\nthem even walk properly.

The, president\nRoosevelt made an offer that 1000 displaced people are welcome to come to the United States,\nprovided they sign papers that at the end of the war they\u2019re going to go back to their countries.\nSo we figured what the world can we lose. We are just going to do it. We\u2019ll go and my brother\nwas not going to go. Because he had to go back to Yugoslavia. He was not going to face his\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011\nfriends telling them that he was being, you know sheltered by his parents like a baby. You know\nhe had all these fancy ideas. You know he was young and idealistic and what have you. He was\nnot going to go and we were not going to go without him. So we waited for him to finally he,\nthey spent many, many nights talking and arguing with him and what not and he was decided\nthat he was going to go. In fact he wanted my sister to go because she was, she had learned how\nto sew. In the meantime in Sandrigo she had learned. And he feel that they will probably be\nneeding that and my mother was absolutely not going to let anybody else go you know. So he\nwent down, he went down to Bari which is all the way down south.",

They were\nstill doing you know the partisans were always doing something and getting the cars, getting the\ntrains, the bridges, the whatever they were doing and they were, we inquired about him because\nfor a while he was corresponding with us and he would tell us after a while he told us to get in\ntouch with uncle, uncle Bata. Uncle Bata was our uncle in the United States. He made us\nunderstand that we should not come back, that we should go because the partisans, while they\ndid a lot of good, they had a Jewish group and they had a non-Jewish group. And they were not\nreally looking very kindly at the Jews. I think that there were books written about that. You\nprobably \u2014 so he must have felt some of that, he maybe even tried to make his way back.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",

I think it was all the\nway down, yeah that was in Bari and then he was sent to someplace to the mountains and over\nthere when he got there he got the reality of things. And he started telling us to get in touch with\nuncle such and such without mentioning you know. And then we tried to find, we didn\u2019t hear\nfrom him. And we tried to find out where he is.

        "A: That was prior to Vicenza. It was still prior to Vicenza, still on the border line with Fiume\n[ph] . It was I think few, near Rijeka. That\u2019s what it was.",

        "A: No. I think I suspect that maybe my father had to sign something or where we had to report\nwas in Sandrigo. We stayed in Vicenza for maybe less than a year because I know they had a\nterrible winter that we didn\u2019t experience in Belgrade. We came out with all those things, geloni,\nwhat they called geloni. I remember so it had to be winter time. They gave us some, what do you\ncall it cards to buy food.",

I tell you the\ntruth. We had fun. I used to go to the marketing such as it was. And my mother on the fourth or\nfifth floor threw us always a basket down which we filled. She pulled it up and then you know it\nwas a kind of leisurely, leisurely life. The place was enclosed by a big gate. This is what, in Italy\nthey have a lot of, had a lot of such places. In that when you walked in there was a fountain.\nYou know that\u2019s where the people used to get their water. And then it was this long stairway\ngoing up. And we brought our water and we did all these things. And she was good to us. And of\ncourse she was alone and I guess money was, helped her.

They were in\nFerramonte, which was down south in a camp. But not, it wasn\u2019t a concentration camp. It was\njust a camp where people were living in little homes like. You know but nothing, nothing\nhorrible. They were just there, detained you know.",
        "A: No, not allowed to go to school. We were not allowed to go to a movie. All that what it was,\nbut it wasn\u2019t a big hardship.

This is a temporary thing.\nSomeday we\u2019re going to go home. That\u2019s what they felt, that we, so they tried to keep us, keep a\nlow profile you know until things got resolved. But no big fear of being Jewish. What we did\nfind over there which was very interesting for us was the Ballilla [Fascist Youth].",
        "A: Those are the little children are brain washed in uniform, marching for Duce and for you\nknow and they were the fascists. They were taught to become fascists.",

The little ones\nand they had, you could distinguish them by the color of their uniform or whatever. And that\nwas kind of at the time I didn\u2019t know. You know I mean I took it for what it was. We didn\u2019t have\nit in Belgrade, obviously. So later on of course you could tell that this is what 1t was. Just a brain\nwashing situation. This is what you get the children. You get \u2014",

        "A: Well on the west coast of Yugoslavia waiting for this boat that, it took a while. Because I\nremember by the trees. Because we rented an apartment there and the lady had orange trees, the\nwild oranges in her yard from that year and they were already out you know so I guess it was\npast spring and all that. The time was going. We were playing and we were waiting.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",

And I am surprised myself that it was only a year and a half, March\nbeing third and the September being nine so that\u2019s six months there. Plus a year. So we were\nthere only a year and a half. And it seemed like such a, because we practically befriended people\nof the population. I don\u2019t remember anybody else. I don\u2019t remember Lino Chiampesan\nunfortunately because only my father had to go there and sign in. Daily.",
        "A: It was a home. It was a beautiful, beautiful house. This lady had nobody but her son there.\nHer husband was in the army. See all the men were gone and it was on two flights. There were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011\nbedrooms. We shared the bedroom with, as children, we were three in the bedroom. And my\nparents had another bedroom. And there was a bath. And then downstairs. That was upstairs.\nAnd downstairs they had the salotti, you know the, and it was nice. And my mother did all the\ncooking and all the everything. Eventually she get other woman to help her do the wash. You\nknow they were cooking the water. They were boiling it and what not. Outside there was a lot\nof, a lot of vegetables were growing outside. But they wasn\u2019t ours. I mean it wasn\u2019t for us. So if\nshe, if the landlady brought us some that was welcome you know but it was there. And we\nbefriended the, a family. Mr. Giovani mentions Antonietta Bozzetto. Well she was older than\nwe were. She was about four or five years older. And she took charge of us because we had to\nlearn everything. How to ride a bicycle, how to smoke a cigarette and we do it. That was my, my\nsister not but I was the one that went into all of that.",
        "A: In the evening, I smoked a cigarette. She offered me a second one and I got so sick and I was\nafraid to go home. I said oh my god my mother is going to kill me. And you know it was a cure\nbecause I never touched a cigarette.",

And\nthey blew up the ship and they never told her. So she was waiting for him. My aunt Ella\u2019s\nhusband was taken prisoner and sent to Switzerland and he spent a long time in Switzerland. So\nshe, you know she was pretty much alone with her little boy, who by the way is in Argentina. He\nis my cousin in Argentina. So these were mostly the people. The rest of the people that I don\u2019t\nknow the people that he mentions except for the Deleon. The Deleon people, they were two\nyoung men who took charge of us and they made a school for us. And for their younger brother.\nSo we were in fact when he wrote to me from Australia, he said you remember that we were a\nschool of four. He mentioned the names and I don\u2019t remember him. I remember the, his older\nbrothers you know. It was Elly and what was the other guy\u2019s name, Deleon. Anyway they were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011\nall there. They were more even older than my brother you know. And my brother didn\u2019t take any\nlessons because he considered himself already grown up you know. So it was just for my sister,\nme, my cousin Anita and their brother. So we were just four kids in that class and we were\nlearning you know the basic things. And they would guide us to books that we should read which\nwas very nice, because we did a lot. I don\u2019t know how we got the books because we were not\nallowed to go into a library or anything. You know it wasn\u2019t the aim wasn\u2019t to educate us. It was\njust to keep us there you know until things were resolved.",

        "A: Italian sure. Well they didn\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t know the Italian language that well. I mean\nwe all had to pick it up. But maybe some history, some geography, stuff like that.

He was six years older than I, so when I,\nhe was 16, 17 you know when I was there. And little by little he got enthused about going to help\nthe partisans over there.

        "A: I believe that he had a high position in the city hall there. I, in fact I thought that even that he\nwas the mayor, but I don\u2019t know that that he was the mayor.",

        "A: Mostly my mother, my father and my brother and sister and my, my grandpa you know that.\nAnd if the others were you know, because you, there was a surge for the railroad. Everybody was\nin a different place. You didn\u2019t know you hoped that everybody made it and they all made it.\nWe got to Rome and we couldn\u2019t get out of the station because there was the curfew.

        "A: They were outside the station with a car and they couldn\u2019t come in and we couldn\u2019t go out.\nYou know. So it was a, at that point we were a little bit afraid. We didn\u2019t know what was going\nto happen. You know. But mostly because we knew that somebody was waiting for us. We said\noh my god you know everything. But not because of what was going on. You see we were not,\nwe did not get this feeling that, that people were getting killed. That\u2019s what\u2019s so amazing and,\nand there were concentration camps all around us and we didn\u2019t know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",

They were all running home and I\ndon\u2019t know what they did and how they you know what the, what they had to say to each other,\nthe Germans and the Italians. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy, nice. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: They found us. They, they saw us. They found us. I guess they decided on some kind of a\ndistinguishing mark or something and they took this one, Doria men, took us to the Flaminia\nsection of Rome and the other his brother, took them. They happened to live. One lived at the\nentrance of Rome and one at the exit of Rome. So that was just the way it was. And \u2014",

It was an old building you know with an apartment that\nwas, it was ok. You know I mean it was much better than a lot of people had it, much better \u2019m\nsure. And he took the five of us and my grandfather and the second, second wife. Seven and I\nthink that\u2019s all he was able to take. Seven. The other guy took as many.

        "A: We had to be outside simply to, to get the, the what we needed you know.",
        "A: Maybe. We didn\u2019t realize. Maybe it was. Because we had our documents whatever you\nknow they told us that this is well you respond to this name. And that was it. And you know by\nthen we already learned language. We were speaking the language and all but did the Germans\nknow whether the Italian was correct or not. They didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t care about that. My\nbrother was very, because he was rebellious. He wanted out you know. He wanted, so and he\nwas glued to the radio and listening to that and, and eventually, eventually when all this was, we\nsaw the Germans leave.",

He was a journalist for the Corriere della Sera [an important newspaper\nin Italy]. He was coming home and suddenly they threw grenade from the window on a truck\nwith Germans and they did a lot of damage. They killed a lot of people. So the Germans closed\nthe street on both ends. And everybody that was walking there, took them into basement. They\nbeat them up. They interrogated them. And first they pushed them down the stairs. Not letting\nthem even walk properly. And they did a lot of damage to our Doria guy. Yeah the good ones\nget it you know.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know but I know that from the ghetto. Rome had a ghetto that they took them all and\nthey took them to, north, where there was a concentration camp. And from there they put them\non trains and they took them to Auschwitz.",

The, president\nRoosevelt made an offer that 1000 displaced people are welcome to come to the United States,\nprovided they sign papers that at the end of the war they\u2019re going to go back to their countries.\nSo we figured what the world can we lose. We are just going to do it. We\u2019ll go and my brother\nwas not going to go. Because he had to go back to Yugoslavia. He was not going to face his\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011\nfriends telling them that he was being, you know sheltered by his parents like a baby. You know\nhe had all these fancy ideas. You know he was young and idealistic and what have you. He was\nnot going to go and we were not going to go without him. So we waited for him to finally he,\nthey spent many, many nights talking and arguing with him and what not and he was decided\nthat he was going to go. In fact he wanted my sister to go because she was, she had learned how\nto sew. In the meantime in Sandrigo she had learned. And he feel that they will probably be\nneeding that and my mother was absolutely not going to let anybody else go you know. So he\nwent down, he went down to Bari which is all the way down south.",
        "A: Yeah he was joining the group that was recruiting the young men to go and be in the hills\nthere. You there you know with the partisans. And to fight the Germans because Tito was not in\ncharge yet.",
        "A: The war was ended. Italy but the Germans were still in our country.",
        "A: Possibly that\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. They were still doing damage to the Germans. They were\nstill doing you know the partisans were always doing something and getting the cars, getting the\ntrains, the bridges, the whatever they were doing and they were, we inquired about him because\nfor a while he was corresponding with us and he would tell us after a while he told us to get in\ntouch with uncle, uncle Bata. Uncle Bata was our uncle in the United States. He made us\nunderstand that we should not come back, that we should go because the partisans, while they\ndid a lot of good, they had a Jewish group and they had a non-Jewish group. And they were not\nreally looking very kindly at the Jews. I think that there were books written about that. You\nprobably \u2014 so he must have felt some of that, he maybe even tried to make his way back.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",

I think it was all the\nway down, yeah that was in Bari and then he was sent to someplace to the mountains and over\nthere when he got there he got the reality of things. And he started telling us to get in touch with\nuncle such and such without mentioning you know. And then we tried to find, we didn\u2019t hear\nfrom him. And we tried to find out where he is. And somebody answers from the authorities in\nthe partisans that he went to, back to his family, to his parents.",

        "A: Right well we couldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t find him. We couldn\u2019t, so what happened was that\neventually we left Rome. We couldn\u2019t any more avail ourselves of the offer and we had to, we\nstarted making papers to come here, different way you know with get a permit, get the what do\nyou call it \u2014",

They were\nlike pick-up truck that had seats for around, the seats were made of the cans of gasoline because\nyou couldn\u2019t stop and get gasoline so those were your seats you know, probably ready you know\nso that you didn\u2019t have to look for a place to gas up. It was there. And they brought us back to\nSandrigo. We wanted to get our stuff. We had some stuff left because going like this, the way we\nwent you know we hardly had any of our, some clothing and that\u2019s about it. But we had books.\nWe had stuff that the \u2014 and everything was eaten by rats. You know because they kept them\nsomeplace so that was nothing. Eventually and I don\u2019t even remember whether we saw\nAntoinetta at that time. Probably did, I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: We traveled to Milano, from Sandrigo, sitting outside, my husband. Sitting on crates that\nwere full of chicken, live chickens that were going from Sandrigo to Milano you know. They\nused to bring the chickens over. There was a camion, but this was a bigger camion. And we\nwere sitting. And they put the blanket there and we were sitting there and I don\u2019t know how it\nwas but we made it there. And there we had no direction at all. We just went. We asked there,\nthey told us when we passed we could find an apartment. And then they found an apartment and\nthat\u2019s where we went. It was nice, nice house in the Allee of Margaritas, something or another. I\nforgot even the address. And we stayed there.",

        "A: My sister was able to sew. You know she was, she learned to sew in Sandrigo and she\nbecame very proficient in that. But she didn\u2019t like it particularly. She didn\u2019t care for that, so\neventually she met somebody and in Milano we used to meet people in the coffee shop, in a\ncoffee place. Where they used to have meals there like (unintelligible). And we went with our\nmother and somebody. There was a group of guys and they saw her. She was always very nice\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011\nlooking. I don\u2019t know if you saw the picture. My sister. I think that she, she sent us a picture of\nus. This is my sister and this is me. And this is my sister again and I wasn\u2019t in this picture. And\nthis, I believe it was in the Anthonia eta Botseta [ph] and she was there and she was the only\none that we no, this is not the same one. No this is not the same one. Couldn\u2019t have been, no.",
        "A: When?",

There wasn\u2019t happy news you\nknow, but why would they keep it from us so, so we, we lived without any fear. We didn\u2019t\nexpect anything.",
        "A: Ok. After the war we were coming to Milano and all that. We didn\u2019t know. Yes my mother\nwould talk to her friends and all that. Oh, oh, oh you know. We didn\u2019t know who they were\ntalking. They figured, we figured that ok they were you know they, that didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t care\nyou know. We didn\u2019t know these people but we didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. It wasn\u2019t our, our\npeople were all, our family was in already by then in Argentina.",

        "A: Oh my god, yes. Yes. Yes, oh definitely.",
        "A: Oh definitely, not because he was Jewish, but that probably didn\u2019t help because there was an\nantagonism between the you know, but not we did not feel that in Belgrade, during, before the\nwar. We didn\u2019t feel that.",
        "A: No, but we had nothing, nothing to go back to any more you know. And my father\u2019s brother\nwas in the, he had accepted the offer from Roosevelt and he went to the United States. And they\nput him in Oswego. You heard about that. They were all there in Oswego. It was a concentration\ncamp but not like, nothing like what the Germans had. It was just a place a waiting time til things\nwere settled in Europe and when that time came, nobody wanted to go back. Because these were\nmostly Jews who had lost families, had lost so who, who were they going to go back to you\nknow?",

Not the skyscrapers but it was\nbuilt up you know. So it was, but it was very interesting. And our uncle was waiting for us.",
        "A: Well to tell you the truth, I didn\u2019t like to coming here.",

        "A: In Milano. So I hated, he was Jewish it so happened you know. That was, I wasn\u2019t looking\nfor anybody one way or the other but this is what happened. And so I was anxious to write to\nhim and to get letters and then stuff like that and that\u2019s as far as it went.",
        "A: No. He didn\u2019t have, he had his father. His mother was somehow killed. I don\u2019t know how.\nHe never told me how. And I just remember that he said that he swore that if she doesn\u2019t come\nback he would never dance again. You know that he would take like an oath never dancing\nagain. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. I understand that several letters came from him and\nmy mother intercepted them. She wanted to put an end to this. And she did. You know. Mothers\ntoday wouldn\u2019t have done it but in those days they did a lot of things to interfere. And she was\npretty dominating that way and she was strong. She was strong because that\u2019s what we basically\nsaved our lives because she was going.",
        "A: She had met somebody in Milano who was going to come also.",

All\nthese chairs were opening up into beds, you know. So in the morning everybody had to scurry\nout and close it because the patients were coming. The patients were coming into the other part\nof the house. And everything has to -- all the cleaning fluids were out, all the dusting things\nwere out. We were all busy cleaning his place and all that. And he had a daughter. He has a\ndaughter.",
        "A: Very little. Very little because they sent us to take English lessons. And so we had a teacher\nin Milano who spoke, who was educated in England so to get, you know never figured that when\nwe come here we would never understand a word because of the different \u2014 but we knew we had,\nwe knew some English.",
        "A: Oh, two, three years I think it took, yes. But I found a job as a secretary in an Italian place. I\nalways looked for jobs like that because I didn\u2019t want to leave, to forget Italian. And I had, I was\nable to take shorthand 1n Italian and in English because the first thing I did here was to join the\nY. They had lessons, they were giving lessons in Gregg shorthand. I didn\u2019t know the language\nbut I was taking the sound and working it that way. It worked out somehow, you know. And I\nwas able to get, well at first I was in a factory. I don\u2019t know there were, something is flying here,\nright did you see it. They were making buttons or something. I don\u2019t know any more. And there,\nthe women, the people were very what, very primitive you know. And certain words I knew\nbecause I had already customs and stuff like that you know. I knew about the things like this. So\nI would try to tell them that 1t was misspelled if they were writing a letter or something and they\nlooked at me like you know better. You know. Anyway.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",
        "A: No, no, no, no. With our uncle, we didn\u2019t stay long after that. We took an apartment that was\nfurnished, also in Brooklyn and from there we got into Manhattan and there we had an apartment\nin Manhattan that was unfurnished.",

They had met also through a thing like that you know with\nthe going through prisons, going to you know it was a crazy, crazy period you know where\neverybody was in, either in prison or going to prison or coming out of prison. For no reason.",
        "A: [had met a girl, a woman on the ship that was very sweet and all that but then, when I learned\nthe language better and all that I realized that I had nothing in common. We had nothing to talk\nabout. We saw each other a couple of times and that was it. For the rest I didn\u2019t have just trying\nto think. Not, not, you know you couldn\u2019t make friends just like that.",
        "A: There were salons. There were places like that. And my parents had joined them and all that,\nbut we didn\u2019t want anything like that. We wanted to learn the American way you know. To meet\nAmerican people you know. We wanted to, to fit in. You know. You didn\u2019t want to carry the old\nbaggage anymore. You know you wanted to sort of fit in. That was our, our aim was to become\ncomfortable in this new society.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",
        "A: Yes. Always. Always, yes.",
        "A: I still do sometimes. Yes. Yes, I still do, but mostly English we speak now because we are\nmore comfortable with English. Italian I am losing already because for many years I worked for\nItalian companies. And I liked it.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. So I mean oh yeah, this we did, I remember, yes.",
        "A: Well the atrocities, the atrocities really hit me hard and but then I had my husband. He will\ntell me about it now. He didn\u2019t speak about it for many years. You know but details I got from\nhim.",

        "A: We were focusing on our settling here and I was a little bit still attached. I had a lot of records\nfrom Italy. I was holding on to Italy, you know. It\u2019s not to Yugoslavia, because I was very\nyoung and I didn\u2019t have that kind of an attachment to Yugoslavia, but Italy yes.",
        "A: Well it, we were listening to this thing and they were emphasizing the fact that they were\nfollowing orders, right. And that was their defense, That they were just following orders. Right.\nThat was, was there anything else that I probably missed half of it.",
        "A: They were a lot but --",
        "A: I was listening but I wonder if I connected it with reality or with the movie. you know\nbecause it wasn\u2019t, to me it was all something that, that didn\u2019t happen or it happened but \u2014 some,\nit bypassed us.",
        "A: To others. To others. And we had always met nice people in Italy you know. Nobody ever\nmade us feel like \u2014",

        "A: No, no because we always took tours. So we were there in Milano which I wanted to see a\nlittle more. In Rome we were there, we landed in Rome and then we made our way to the, to the\nhotel. And everything was on strike. We had to make our room. I mean the place was really,\nand then we went to Florence for the first ttme which was lovely. And Florence they bombed our\nbus. You know the civil, they were against the people that were, the tourists and that was a big\nincome for the, for Italy.",

He was really a good guide and all that. And he said you know should Tito die,\nshould anything happen to Tito while we are on this, [Il put you on the, I\u2019Il take you to the\nnearest airport and put you on the plane. Because he says, after that it\u2019s going to be bedlam and\ndo you know, he was right. Because nobody likes anybody in Yugoslavia. And they didn\u2019t just\nhate the Jews. They hated each other.",
        "A: Yes, we lived And the factory we couldn\u2019t visit. But we went over there where we, where we\nthat I describe in yes, so it was, it was sectioned, 1t was sectioned. The communist, it was too big\nfor one family. You know this only rich people lived like this. We had a servant for the speak\nyou know off the kitchen there was a little room and they had their bathroom and that was only\nto be considered luxury so that was already an apartment for the communists, for their family.\nAnd they made the whole thing into three or four apartments. We went to the door, we rang the\ndoorbell and the woman finally opened up. And I said you know I\u2019m very really sorry to bother\nyou but you know I used to, we used to live here. We were there with my sister and my brother\nin law. And -- So just come in, must come in you know and I started crying you know. It was a\nlittle bit over --",
        "A: Nothing, they didn\u2019t make a fuss on us. They couldn\u2019t receive us. She only had this one room.\nyou know they have given up the room. They looked at us. They didn\u2019t know what was going on\nand I say I used to live here and \u2014",

        "A: No, no, no we were not too far from the Kalimantan. In fact we used to, my school was right,\nnot far from the Kalimantan also, but we went to see my school and it seemed so small by\ncomparison. Well I was little at the time. We went to the Kalimantan. My cousin was there. The\none who killed herself, Melita. She was there. She took us around. She wanted to bring us to the\nKalimantan because of the restaurant there. They semachichin what not you know. And they\nhad run out of semachichin.

        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know that there was a Jewish community in the end. We went with my, she took\nus to the synagogue. To the Ashkenazi synagogue. Because I understand that our synagogue\nwas completely ruined. They used it as a stable or something.",
        "A: No. And I don\u2019t know why. You know I tried to stay in touch with that boyfriend of mine\nand then there was a girl upstairs from us. Titsiana, forgot her last name. Titsiana. She was very\nfond of me and I was very fond of her. She was older than I was. But who else did I --?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",

        "A: This 1s it. That completes it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 11, 2011",
        "A: I think that ours was a happy, happy story and happy ending, considering what other people\nwent through. I think we were awfully lucky. And you know the older I get and the more stories\nI hear from all around of Jews that were in France, or in wherever they went you know it\u2019s just a\nhorror story of more and more you know. And here we, it was just like being on vacation, like a\nlong vacation. Sure we lost, we lost all this time from going to school and so we had to sort of\npick up things as we went along. Some things I suppose we picked up and some we never will\nbut school is not only going to the building right. You learn as you meet people and it\u2019s a\ncontinuous learning process. I learned a lot from my husband because he really went through the\nnitty gritty, he went through the whole thing. How he survived that\u2019s a miracle. Because he was\nin camp from the beginning of the war to the end of the war. He lost his brother. He lost his\nfamily, he lost all of them. With the exception of those who, cousins you know he lost\neverybody. Well Poland was really, he comes from Poland.\n"

The interview is conducted by Hannah Starman. Thank you very much\nfirst of all for granting us this opportunity to hear your experience and I understood you wanted\nto make a statement.\nMatilde Neuwirt: Yes and I want to thank you and tell you that you are very welcome to give me\nthis opportunity. So I will, I want to say this. I want to express my sincere thanks to MrGiovanni\nChiampesan for his efforts, considerable efforts in locating me. And reviving memories that are\nvery precious and the beautiful part of my growing up years in Italy at the very incredibly tragic\ntime for most Jews. Also many, many thanks to Ms. Hannah Starman who is making it possible\nfor me to speak and retell the events belonging to my childhood, childhood years in Italy. 1940\nthrough 1949. During and after the war, as well as starting a new life in the USA. Now that I\nknow from Mr. Giovanni Chiampesan that it was his father Leno who made it possible for the\nJews in Sandrigo to escape before the Nazis came in. By supplying us with documents stating\nthat we were Christians born in Italy, my eternal gratitude goes to Mr. Lino Chiampesan for\nsaving our lives at great peril to himself. In recalling the events in chronological order, I will\nmention other people who opened their homes and hearts and decided to help this relatively\nsmall group to escape the evil Nazi intentions. In particular the Daria family, two brothers and a\nsister and they all took part in this effort.\nHannah Starman: So this is the interview with Matilde Neuwirt, the second part. So tell us about\nyour childhood and your parents.\nMatilde Neuwirt: I was born in Belgrade, Serbia on December 26, 1930. My parents, Solchi\nmother and Bugich father were born 1n the same area on 1897 my father. In 1905 my mother. I\nhad a brother born in Vienna. His name is Yosef Bubi and sister Dolly born 1924 and my brother",
