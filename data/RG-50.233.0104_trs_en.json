        "INTERVIEW WITH DR. JANINA PROT",
        "APRIL 1, 1992",
        "LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS\nDr. Prot, could you please tell me your name and the date of your birth and the place of birth.\nPlease don't call me Dr. Prot, my name is Jana. It is my nickname and my full name is Janina and\nmy last name is Prot. Oh, they don't work. I was born on February 8, 1926 in Poland, in a small\ntown named Nowe Miasto, near Warsaw.\nCould you tell me about your childhood, what was it like growing up in your town, and what was\nyour family like, did you have brothers and sisters? What did you like to do? Anything you can\nremember about that time.\nWell I can remember plenty. I grew up mostly in Warsaw. But in my childhood I changed my\nplace of living because my parents were divorced, and part of my childhood I spent with my father\nand part with my mother. I have a brother who is two years younger and for some time, before the\nwar, we were separated, because he was with my mother, I was with my father. There were plenty\nof family problems. My father had some kind of high position in Poland.\nWhat did he do?\nHe was a director of a big factory of munitions and explosive materials in Poland. I was living with\nhim near Radom in a small town Pionki which was near a big factory. We lived in a big house with\na big garden. I didn't go to school.\nYou didn't?\nNo, in Pionki was a small country-like elementary school, and my father did not want to send me to\nthis kind of school because the education was not too good. So, I was taught at home with two\nother girls with a private tutor and we had lessons at home. In the afternoon I had to do my\nhomework, as all children. Once a year I had to take some small exam, it was a government\nrequirement that I have enough education to start another class. This way I practically never went to",
        "school except the last year before the war, when we moved to Warsaw and I started with they call in\nPoland \"Gymnasium\"--a junior high.\nCould you tell me about your religious life in your home, or respective homes with your parents?\nNow we have started one of the complicated parts of my life. My parents converted to Catholicism\nbefore I was born. Most of my family were completely, as they say, \"assimilated\" family. They\nnever feel they have too much to do with Jewish habits. My father, I think, was the biggest Polish\npatriot that I ever met in my life, and I think almost everybody on my father's side, probably in the\n20's, after the first war, converted to Catholicism or to Protestantism. Not in my mother's family.\nMy mother was, I think, only one. So I grew up as a Catholic girl. My parents were not very\nreligious in any religion but officially they were Catholic, and I was brought up with other children,\nso they wanted me probably to be the same as the other girls. I was baptized, and I went to First\nCommunion being, I think, 8 years old. I didn't know that I am Jewish. We never talk about it at\nhome. I knew that we are a little different and it was hard for me to figure out what is really\ndifferent. I knew that we are different than the other people. My parents never went to the church.\nBut if I wanted to go to the church with the other girls or if I wanted to go to the church with a\nservant, it was permitted; it was fine. I really discovered who am I when the war started and we all\ndiscovered that we are not Poles anymore, that we are Jews and we are treated as Jews by\neverybody around.\nBut otherwise, people didn't know, or they did know?\nOh, yes, of course, everybody knew. It was some kind of thing that tactful people don't talk about.\nWe are living between educated, intellectual people and many of them have what they call in\nPoland, mixed marriages. One of them was Jew, one of them was Pole, and almost everybody has\nsome grandmother who is a Jew. And probably until late 30's I don't know if my father really felt a\nbig antisemitism. I think later something started, because I remember that about '38 or the\nbeginning of '39 he started to talk that he would like to quit his job, which was very well paid, and\nalso I think he enjoyed what he was doing. I never had an opportunity to ask him; I was a child.\nAnd personally, I was living in some kind of isolated area, I didn't go to school, I was living with\nmy father being taught at home. It was practically not even possible to be exposed to the Polish\nantisemitism. I knew that it existed; I knew it was something really bad, but I never took it\npersonally. I grew up in very liberal house. It was bad to be antisemitic, 1t was bad to think that\nblack people are different and all people should be equal. You can imagine how it is.\nAlso, I imagine you didn't have too many black people.",
        "No, no, but there was this kind of feeling in the house. People are equal.\nCan I ask you more about your childhood. Do you remember if you had any interest or hobbies, or\nmusic, or things that you pursued or enjoyed to do?\nI don't think so. I was a very unhappy, socially isolated child. I was unhappy because my parents\nwere divorced.\nHow old were you when they were divorced?\nI was about 4 years old. And they were constantly fighting to have the children. My father wanted\nto have both of us and my mother, of course wanted to have both of us. And we were constantly for\ndifferent reasons, switched from one parent to the other. My mother was a very tense, nervous,\nanxious, neurotic person. I was much more happy with my father. But my mother, when I was with\nher for vacation, was constantly telling me, \"How come you are with your father, you should be\nwith your mother. You are a girl, and children should stay with mother,\" and so on and so on. I\nwas really a very shy, unhappy and frustrated child. I was a very good student and I was reading\nbooks from age 5. I had times I was reading two books per day. Everyone was looking and saying,\n\"What sort of wonderful child, reading and reading and reading.\" No, it was my escape--not to be\nexposed to the family problem, not to play with children where they could ask me, where is your\nmother? I always had very strong feelings that I am different. It was a very difficult childhood.\nWas this up through your teenagerhood?\nNo, I was a teenager during the war. I was also unhappy but in a different way. The war started\nwhen I was 13, and just before the war I moved to Warsaw, with my brother to my mother's\napartment and we stayed with her.\nCan you tell me when you found out you were Jewish?\nI remember one talk with a maid. I was probably 7 years old, I wanted to go with her to the church.\nMy grandmother, my paternal grandmother, was living with us when I was with my father. I really\ndidn't like her, she was very victorian, very rigid and stiff and constantly trying to correct my\nbehavior. I remember telling the maid, \"I know why she doesn't want me to go to the church--\nbecause she is Jewish.\" And I remember the maid looking around and didn't know what to say. So",
        "I knew there was something around. I cannot clearly tell you when I found out, probably I was\nabout 12, but still the people didn't talk about it. It was full denial. Of course, immediately after the\nwar, we all find out who we are. Nothing more, nothing less, but the Jews...\nAfter the war?\nWhen the war started.\nDo you want to talk about that a little, where were you, what was going on, what did you end up\ndoing?\nWar started, as you know, September 1, '39. I came from vacation, the last vacation I spent with my\nfather, to Warsaw. The war started and we moved from our apartment which was on the north part\nin Warsaw in Bielany to the huge apartment of my aunt who was a sister of my father. For a reason\nI was never able to understand, everybody had the feeling that it was more safe to be in the\ndowntown Warsaw than all around. Life showed that it was completely different. And then it was\nthe siege of the Warsaw. We stayed all time with the apartment of my aunt and her husband and her\ndaughter which was 10 years older at this time and also their daughter-in-law because the son, my\ncousin was in the army, an officer in the army. So his wife was in this big apartment and her three-\nmonths-old child. It was a 7 or 8 room apartment in downtown Warsaw. And September 25, it\nwas the worst bombardment of Warsaw. And one of the first bomb drop on this house. My cousin\nwas killed at the place, wife of my cousin and three-month-old baby was killed and her mother was\nkilled. Four people were killed, being about, I don't know, five yards from me. Soon the house\ncollapsed and we stayed in the basement of the collapsed house. We survived--my aunt, her\nhusband, my mother, my brother, and myself. The first phase of the war finished, Warsaw gave up,\nit was September 29 or 30, and we went back to our apartment on the north part of the Warsaw. It\nwas not badly destroyed, no glass in the windows, but otherwise it was the same as before. Then we\ndiscovered that we don't have any money. My father disappeared, we knew he was in the army, we\ndid not know if he was killed or what has happened. And, also, I think my mother knew that the\npressure against Jews had started. I think in October or November of 1939, it was the order that the\nJews had put the armband with the Star of the David. Of course we didn't. We are in complete\ndenial that we are not, we are not Jews, but we knew that we are. And I think the landlords, owner\nof the house where we were living, he probably knew it. People knew of these kinds of things. So\nwe are hanging around, not having too much money, even to buy bread. In November '39, my father\nshowed up from the army. He knew very well that he could not stay in Poland for many reasons.\nHe started immediately to try to go through the green border, illegally, to Hungary. Finally, he went\nto Hungary at the end of December 1939 and from Hungary to France and from France to England\nand I never saw him again. So the last time I saw him it was for a brief time in December or",
        "November 1939. And we decided to move from Warsaw to some kind of convent which was near\nWarsaw and my mother had good friends there.\nCould you tell me a little bit about this convent?\nIt was an interesting place. The convent was of Franciscan Sisters. It was organized by Mother\nCzacka. The congregation was quite liberal and plenty of people from Catholic-Polish aristocracy\nfrom intellectual circles, they stick to this convent--it was what they call French Catholicism. The\nSisters were running schools and workshops for blind children. Mother Czacka, the Mother\nSuperior, was blind herself. Some Jewish intellectuals were also connected with this convent. Two\nnuns in high position were of Jewish origin--they converted. My mother knew some of them before\nthe war and was very friendly with them. In December, 1939, they invited us to stay there. They\ncould not give us so much as an apartment, but I got a room and my mother could help with the\ngarden, which she loved to do and I can go to school. Whatever, I don't think we had a clear plan on\nwhat we would be doing. I think everyone hoped that the war would be finished in one year. So we\nwould survive one year. Nobody expected what really happened.\nSo, in the very end of 1939 we pack our belongings with very few of our furniture, some basic\nthings and moved to Laski, which was 10 kilometers north of Warsaw. We stayed in a small\napartment, my mother was working helping in the garden; or sometimes in the kitchen whatever\nwas needed. My brother stayed mostly home and for the first year I was simply helping--I\nremember working in the kitchen or in the washroom or doing whatever needs to be done. I was\nbored to death, 1t was nothing to do, nothing to read, it was no people in my age, I was not allowed\nto go, of course, to Warsaw or any other place. Probably here is the good place to say that I did not\nlook like a Polish girl. I had very black hair, black eyes, rather dark skin and obviously, it was\ndifficult for me to walk on a Warsaw street, not being asked, \"Hey, stop, you are Jewish?\" or \"Are\nyou a Jew?\" My brother didn't look like a Polish child either with curly black hair, but he was not\ncircumcised, and this way it was easier to save him than it was to save me. My mother, if we were\ntalking how we looked--she looked wonderful, she absolutely didn't look Jewish; nobody ever\nsuspected that she was Jewish. She had a small, very pretty face, completely grey hair and she did\nnot have any problem when she was walking around. The difficulty was our documents. We keep\nour name Prot because it doesn't have any Polish, Jewish or any other meaning, but my mother's\nmaiden name is Dajches. She was Zosia Dajches. So all our documents were changed and my\nmother's maiden name was given Kossouth, what is a typical Hungarian name and it was given in\nthis goal so that if someone was asking during the war, \"Oh, you look somewhat strange, you look\nJewish, you have so black hair\" I was telling immediately, \"Oh, yes, I have black hair because my\ngrandmother was Hungarian, you know. My mother's name is Kossouth.\" And the documents were\nchanged with the help of the nuns, where we stayed and I think it were very good documents. We\nhad baptismal documents. It was filled out in church's books, so it was possible to check that it is\nnot false. Some priests were able to do this if they wanted to false the records in church books. So,\nwe had not too bad documents for the war. Do you want to know what happened to me later?",
        "Yes, if you want to give this straight narrative -- you were in the convent..\nThen--I am in the convent, 1t was about 1940. All this year we stayed together, my mother, my\nbrother and myself. It was very hard, it was very poor, it was not enough food. We did not have\nenough clothes, but we felt quite safe. In 1940, it was the feeling that the war would not finish so\nquickly. I tried to press my mother very badly that I would like to go back to school, and I begged\nher to go back to Warsaw because I want to go to school, to my gymnasium and it is not possible for\nme to lose so much time. My mother had friends in Warsaw and they agreed to take me and to stay\nwith their children and I would be able to live with them and go to school. I moved with them--I'm\nsure they knew who am I. I am quite sure. Of course, we never talk about it. It was some kind of\nagreement that it would be complete denial. They don't know I am Jewish. I have all my\ndocuments, I am a Polish girl with a Polish name, I am Catholic. It was very helpful that I knew\nCatholic religion very well and of course, all prayers. It was no problem for me to go to the church\nand I knew how to behave during the Mass. It was a big help. I went to school and it was difficult\nfor the first year and then the next year, how it was? It was about 1941 I stayed with these friends\nfor about half a year and then I was quite unhappy with their children. It was very cold, it was\nsomewhat dirty and I was hungry all the time and my mother decided that I am big enough--I was\nabout 14 or 15--that I could live alone. She arranged another place, because no one had money for a\nroom, but through some friends that found an older woman who wanted to have some company and\nshe rented me a bed in her room. It was in Zoliborz, it was more close to my school and I stayed\nwith her. She was a nice woman and I was going to school. Remember, I had to cook for myself, I\nhad to feed myself and it was absolutely nothing to eat. I was awfully, terribly hungry all day long.\nI had only this rationed which was possible to buy. Of course, you could buy all kinds of things\nduring the war on the black market, but I didn't have any money. So, for dinner I cooked some kind\nof kasha and I ate the piece of bread for breakfast, and this kasha that I cooked with water, I ate in\nthe afternoon. I remember being very, very hungry. Now I have to move back a little bit. The\nghetto was organized much earlier, but it was more south from the part of the town where I was\nliving, and I avoid very much going to the downtown. I was living in the north part of Warsaw-\nBielany and later in Zoliborz. The school was in Zoliborz, and I practically never go downtown\nbecause it was very unsafe. The few times that I went, I saw the wall of the ghetto and the streetcar\nwas going through the ghetto. It was a big ghetto and a small ghetto connected by a wooden bridge.\nThe streetcar was going through ghetto, not stopping of course. And I remember on one of my trips\nthrough the ghetto, it was probably in 1941, I took the streetcar and then it was possible to see the\nstreets through the streetcar windows. And then I saw dead people lying on the streets. This I\nremember, dead boys and children covered with newspaper. I didn't know what to do, I didn't know\nto look, or not to look, or what to do. This I remember very clearly.\nDid people talk about when the streetcar went through the ghetto? No one said a word?",
        "No. Windows were blocked in some towns. If you see the movie Europa, Europa--I'm sure you\ndid--he's looking through some kind of scratch. If I remember correctly, the windows were not\nblocked in this streetcar that I took, and shortly after this 1t was some change in the relationship\nbetween big ghetto and small ghetto. I think small ghetto was liquidated and the streetcar was not\ngoing anymore through ghetto. Only along the wall that we see the Port Brama-entrance with\nPolish and German police. At this time, sometime you are able to see Jews on the street going to do\nsome work in the town. Of course with German soldier or police with guns. Sometimes we saw\nthis small group of Jews out of the ghetto. I think it was about 1941-42. Also, this was probably in\n1941, I was inside the ghetto only once during the war. Should I tell you the story about what\nhappened?",
        "Yes, please.",
        "I went downtown Warsaw with some other children of my friends who were half-Jewish and half-\nPolish. We were very stupid. We tried to change streetcar near the ghetto wall which was the most\ndangerous place, because the people hanging around we call, in Poland, szmakownik. Do you know\nwhat is szmakownik? Informers. The people who pick you up in the street and \"Oh, you are Jew,\nand give us money. If not, we are going to the police.\" So we stop there on the street, at the\nstreetcar stop near the ghetto entrance and, of course, immediately they pick us. My friend was a\nlittle older, I was about 14 and she was, I think, 16. They took us to the police station at the\nentrance to the ghetto, and inside the ghetto to some kind of, I remember, big room and they started\nto ask us for documents and what we are doing. You are Jews and how come we are out of the\nghetto. We are sitting and I keep telling them, \"We are not Jews, absolutely not. This is a mistake.\nPlease let us go, it is a mistake.\" I do not know how, I and the other girl, how we had the nerve to\ntell that. In some moment it came this, I remember very clearly, some older man, a Jew with a band\non his arm, and he came to me and asked me \"Why you don't have a band?\" So I said, \"I am not\nJewish; there is no reason for me to have an armband.\" Oh, how come, you are Jewish, it's enough\nto look at you. You are Jewish and I don't understand, but if you will give me some money I can\nhelp you. Do you have parents? I can call them where you are. I can help you if you give me some\nmoney. It was clear that he was working with the police and I look at him and I told him very\nfirmly, \"I am not Jewish and please go away and leave me alone.\" He went away, and then the\nPolish policeman came and asked me about documents. I did not have enough because I don't have\nyet Kennkarte; the Kennkarte was given when you were 16. I found a small piece of paper, from\nschool what I was attending one year before the war. It was a Catholic school. I show him this and\ntold him \"Do you think if I would be Jewish, I would be going to Catholic school before the war?\"\nHe looked at us and he let us go. He pushed us through the entrance and we took the streetcar.\nSince then I knew very well I have to keep far away from this place. In 1942, I was still going to\nschool and was living with this woman but I started to have problems at this time. I think the\nwoman did not know who I am, but I remember a few times they picked me on the street, this\nPolish informer, they told me \"oh, you are Jewish, go with us.\" Mostly I tried to tell them, \"No I am\nnot, go away.\" Because I knew that once I would tell them, \"Yes\", or if I would give them some",
        "money, it would be the end. And some people, even in school, they asked me, some girls they ask\nme, Why you look so Jewish and I always tell the story: \"Well, I have black hair because I am\nHungarian descendent.\" But it was, I don't know how to tell you, it started to be as I was constantly,\nday and night, twenty-four hours on the stage. That I am playing somebody that I am not. When in\nthis situation, somebody pick you up on the street frequently, the Jewish people became very\nconfused. You could see fear on their faces. I learn not to have it on my face. I learn when they\npick me up to smile and say,\"Ha, ha, how funny.\" But I remember psychologically I was somewhat\nexhausted. It was denial and denial and it was no one with whom I could talk openly. Absolutely\nnobody. Because even it was some friends I would be with and I knew that they know, but it was\ntaboo. We never talk about it; never admit that they know; never talk about this problem. You\nmight think it is funny, but time to time when my mother visited me, we never talked about it! It\nwas denial between my mother and myself. It was something that we never, never talk about. My\nmother always told me, remember you are Hungarian, and I knew why she was saying this, but it\nwas impossible to say, \"We'll talk about it.\" Talk about what has happened to the rest of the family?\nNever, never. To make things more complicated, at this time my mother had to move from this\nconvent where she was staying with my brother. I think it was 1942, and one day they told her that\nthere are some informers telling the police that she is Jewish and that my brother is a Jew, and they\ntold them if they did not go away in a few hours, they will be taken to the police. So my mother\ntook my brother, leaving everything absolutely behind, I think she took some clothes with her and\nas much money as they had, as they had not too much, of course, and they went by foot to Warsaw\nand then I know from her stories, she did not have any place to go. She was walking on the street in\nWarsaw, keeping by hand this very Jewish-looking boy. She did not have anyplace to go, and it\nwould be curfew in a few hours. It was in summer, 1942, it became the evening and you cannot\nstay on the street. It was some small hospital, in downtown Warsaw run by nuns. My mother\nknocked to the door of this small hospital. The nun opened and my mother told the nun, \"This boy\nis very sick and he has to be in the hospital right now.\" The nun, of course, did not want to take him\nand my mother almost forced herself into--I told you my mother always looked very elegant--and\ntold her, \"I am very sorry, dear nun, but he has appendicitis and has to be operated on now.\" So the\nnun did not know what to do, but she opened the door and put my brother to the bed. The next day,\nI don't know if the doctor was seeing him or not. My mother left him with the nun as a very sick\nchild in the bed, and went around Warsaw to find a place where they can take him. I think some\nfriends took him for a few days, and then he was placed in an orphanage with the children of the\nPolish officers who perished during the war. It was special organization helping this kind of\nchildren named R. G. O., Rada Gto'wna Opiekun'esa. They had some houses where they took\nchildren who did not have fathers. So my brother remained in the orphanage, my mother took a job\nas a helper of sick woman with children, or a tutor of children, or a live-in maid. I was going to\nschool and living with this old woman but quickly it started also to be impossible. I think somebody\ninformed her, she said I could no longer stay with her without giving me clear reason. During this\ntime, think it was 1942, some children from ghetto were running the streets of Warsaw and begging\nfor bread. You could see them on the street running in schmattas, very hungry mostly without hair.\nThey had some kind of cans and they bang on these metal cans making noise and some, not all the\npeople, are throwing food to these cans. It was in winter, 1941-42. The children were dying from\nhunger. When the Germans see them, they shoot them simply on the street. In this apartment",
        "building where I was living with this woman--she was going to work and I was back from school\nabout 3:00 in the afternoon--it was a child sleeping on the stairs, with this big noisy can. He was\nbanging on this can asking the people to throw some _ I throw some food, some bread, and he\nremember what I did and the next day he showed again. He was on my door, banging on this can. I\ndon't know if you could understand my situation--how terribly dangerous it was to have a Jewish\nchild at the door. I open the door and I again throw some food. I really didn't know what to do. I\nwas dying that the neighbors will open the door and then it would be a horrible situation for me. He\ncame again and then he came again. But I was in fear of this poor child. I never had this kind of\nfear; I was sitting at home and almost praying to God not to send this child anymore, because I did\nnot know what to do; open the door or not open the door. At this time me mother really didn't know\nwhat to do with me. Summer, 1942, started, my mother's friends found some friends near Lowicz.\nIt was an agriculture school for the peasant girls and they sent me over there so I can help and work\nin the fields. They agreed to take me. That means that I would have a bed and food and then I can\nwork. And I went there knowing that I don't have anyplace to go, nobody doesn't want to take me.\nI started to work and I was terribly unhappy, but I was unhappy all the time, it was nothing new. I\nwas only one girl with dark hair between this Polish peasant, very simple girls sleeping in these big\nrooms with more than twenty beds. I had one bed between them and I was working in the fields or\ntaking care of cows, garden, or taking out weeds. I learned a lot. The girls never suspected that I\ncould be Jewish. They were simple and it was too far from their imagination. I was going with\nthem to the church and they were surprised that I have different hobbies and different clothes. They\nasked me thousands of naive questions as what for I am reading books.",
        "Where did you get books at this time?",
        "They had some small library. It was very boring, as I knew almost everything, but you know, I still\nwas reading in the evenings. I think the director of the school, he probably knew very well who am\nI, but they played they did not know. It was again some kind of denial. I had my documents and\nthis time I had Kennkarte. As you can see, it was general agreement that I am not Jewish. I stayed\nthere quite a long time. I didn't go back to Warsaw, I did not go back to school. It was not possible.\nI was working, I was very exhausted, very lonely, there was absolutely nobody to talk. I was still\nonly 16. I got hepatitis and I was very sick. Of course, I was not seen by any physician. I was\nlying in bed with high fever, as yellow as lemon. After hepatitis, as I understand now, but not at this\ntime, I had very deep depression. I was unable to do anything physically or mentally. I was sitting\nin the corner of the room and I was even unable to read. I was staring by window. I did not want\nanyone to talk to me and I didn't want to answer. It was for about three or four weeks and\neverybody was surprised what is going on. They think I am going crazy. After this time I went\nback to work. I was very weak and everybody was laughing because I cannot work too much.\nThey told me I was lazy. Believe me, I wasn't lazy, I was sick. But I was dragging my foot. One of\nthe girls in school got typhoid fever and they decided I was the best person to take care of her. They\nput us together in the small room. I had always some kind of nursing capability. I was interested in\nmedicine. I was taking care of her and she was so sick that they took her in the hospital and she",
        "died. It was December 1942, yes 1t was December. I remember I was still not very healthy and I\nwent to bring water from the well. It was a very windy day and I had long hair which I combed\nnicely back and put them together, but it was in the morning and my hair, I think, was down and it\nwas windy and my hair was waving. Suddenly the car with Germans came to the school for\nsomething--they were coming frequently. I was always hiding someplace when I saw that the car is\ncoming. And just as I was taking this water the car with the Germans came and they look at me and\nthey immediately went to the director of the school and they asked him what this Jewish girl is\ndoing here? So he said that I could not stay there any longer. 'You have to go, you have to go now.\nSome way, I don't remember how, I informed my mother, I had my mother's address, I don't\nremember. It was possible to call, probably, I don't know. My mother came next week and she\npicked me up and it was the end of my stay in this school. I went with her to Warsaw and I stayed\nwith my very good friends. They were parents of my friend from school, Sophia Kielan, with\nwhom I am still very friendly. I was good friends with both sisters, Zofia and Christina, and the\nparents agreed to take me to their home. It was just the beginning of 1943, and I started again to go\nto school. I tried to catch all that they learned during the last six months. For all my war time, it\nwas probably the best time. I was treated as a third daughter. I think they like me and I treat them\nas my parents. Of course, they knew and I knew that they know. I had all my papers, I had\ndocuments, I had my Kennkarte, I have big beautiful picture of my first communion. It was very\nimportant that I have it. I stayed with them until May 1943.",
        "Does that mean after ghetto uprising?",
        "Yes. The time was very difficult for the Jews. It was plenty of informers. It was very difficult to be\non the street. Many times they stop me; still sometimes I had to go to downtown Warsaw. I had to\npretend that I was a \u2018normal person\u2019; that I am moving around as everybody else. I didn't mention\nbefore--but I cannot talk about everything at the same time--I was in the Polish underground\nmovement, from age 14 or 15. I was involved with my friends, Sophia and Christine Kielan. I was\nin Polish underground army youth organization, which was Szare Szeregi, grey tows. We had our\nmeetings and we had some underground activities. It was a danger, but for me it was also some\nkind of protection. I don't know if you understand why. Unfortunately, I did not only fear the\nGermans, I fear, above all, the Poles. The Germans were not dangerous for me directly; indirectly,\nyes. But directly it was the Poles, somebody on the street, or ex-friends, or someone who knew who\nwas my father, or they stopped me because they recognized me, or some neighbors, or concierge.\nBeing in the Polish underground movement created some kind of protection. I am with Polish\nyouth, I am in the underground movement and cannot be Jewish. We had our meetings; we had\nsmall different tasks. I remember they gave me a Polish underground newspaper called Biuletyn\nInformacyjny. They gave me a bunch of them, I don't know, twenty or more and they asked me to\ndeliver to different houses. It was what the young people were doing. I didn't want to take it; I\ndidn't want to take it not because I didn't want to, but my danger was my face. I didn't want because\nif they pick me up with the underground materials who knows what I will tell if they will start to\nbeat me up. But I didn't want to tell them that I didn't want to take it. Everybody will be thinking,",
        "why not? Of course, it was out of the questions to tell them--what was most simply--\"Look at me.\nDo you really want me to walk on the street with this kind of look with underground material?\" So\nyou can see it was constant struggle how to avoid this kind of involvement. I remember one other\nscene. I was going to school with my friend, Sophia, and her mother gave us some small lunch with\nus, piece of bread, we had in the pocket. We walk. It was not very far from the home and there was\na Jewish child sitting with a can, this completely emaciated child sitting with this can and banging,\nhalf dead looking. We both took our lunch from our pocket and throw away to his can. This Polish\nwoman noticed it and started to run after us screaming \"You dirty Jewish helpers.\" She was very\nangry that we gave this piece of bread to the Jewish child. Now let's talk about the Jewish uprising.\nThe uprising started just before Easter. I think it started on Thursday and from the place that we\nwere living--it was fifth floor, the window faced to the south--we could see the flames and even\nwhen it was quiet at night, it was no street movement, you can hear people screaming. And then, of\ncourse, smoke, and constant guns shot. We all tried not to go near the ghetto. It was very\ndangerous at this times, as was many times described. And then I remember a few days after the\nghetto uprising started, it was Easter breakfast in the house of our friends. I think they have a hard\ntime with me too, because all the relatives started to tell them--why do you keep this strange-\nlooking girl; we are sure she is Jewish, and so on and so on. But it was a big breakfast and the\nrelatives and friends were invited and we were sitting at the table and eating and the windows are\nopen and you can see the smoke and hear the guns. It was hard for me to take it. It was some\nfeelings that I am not in the right place, that probably I should be over there, not here. And some of\nthese people sitting in the room, I remember, saying, 'Good that the Germans are doing for us the\ndirty work.\u2019 It is a poem by Czestaw Mitosz, do you know Campo dei Fiori? As I told you it was\nnot good to go near the ghetto at this time, but I went once or twice and I remember that on the Platz\nKrasinski, it was a small some kind of carnival. It was music and the people are going on the\ncarousel and it was beautiful weather and it was the wall of ghetto, and shooting and smoke and\nscreaming, and here people were playing. It was described in Mitosz poem and it was this way as\nhe described. Czestaw Mitosz: Compo dei Fiori.",
        "... The bright melody drowned the salvos from the ghetto wall, and couples were flying high",
        "in the cloudless sky. At times wind from the burning would drift dark kites along and riders",
        "on the carousel caught petals in mid-air...\nYou want to hear what happens to me later. I finish school at this time, I finish gymnasium, and we\nhad some kind of examination and matura. I do not go into detail because it has nothing to do with\nmy personal story, Jewish story. Gymnasium was not existing during the war and we had what they\ncall komplety. It was an underground school and we move from one house to another and teachers\nwere coming and this way I finished gymnasium, with small groups of other girls and in May, 1943\nwe had to take matura, high school diploma exam. Both my friends went to underground university\nwhich was also active during the war in Warsaw, and I decided to go to the school for nurses. At\nthis time I knew that I want to be a physician. So I decided to go to school for nurses. It was a very\ngood school in Warsaw. It was run by a woman, Mrs. Romanowski; I remember her. And she\ndecided to take me even though I was below the age. You have to be 17 to be admitted and I was\nsixteen and a half. She agreed to take me as a student. We were working in the hospital in the",
        "morning and in the afternoon we had lessons. It was a dormitory on the last floor; one room for four\ngirls and we were able to live there--also very poor food, but at least it was something to eat. This\nway I was all set, I can tell, because I was able to stay there. Also it was safer because I had a nurse\nuniform with some kind of a white hat and I feel that I did not look so different in this. My hair was\npulled back; my uniform was all white and I was always careful to be extremely clean and in order.\nYou know it was very important not to look neglected. What was very strange, the directress of the\nschool, I think, she knew very well who am I. I think some people called her and ask her to take\nme. At first she agreed to take me even though I was below the age. And second, every new pupil\nhas some kind of task to do in school. For instance, keep the bathrooms clean or keep the corridors\nclean or clean the table after breakfast. They gave me a chapel. I was in charge of chapel. What\nwas not so very easy because I had to get up very early, 5:30 in the morning, and clean the chapel\nand put the flowers and then help the priest with Mass. After Mass, you don't know this because it\nis completely different now, the priest was going to give Communion to the sick people in the\nhospital. And I was the one going before the priest with a candle and a small bell making noise and\nto show him who wanted to have Communion. That was my task for every day morning.",
        "Where was your mother at this time?",
        "My mother was working for some people with problems. I remember, in one house, the woman had\ncancer and she had small children and my mother was helping. She never had any specific problem\nas a Jewish woman. We had also other problems: we didn't have any money, we didn't have an\napartment. My brother stayed in the orphanage. He had problems because he looked too dark; he\nhad curly, dark hair. At this time, I think he knew that he was not circumcised and he knew that he\ncan prove he is not Jewish. I stayed in the nurses' school until 1944, when it starts the Warsaw\nuprising. I was still in the Polish underground movement and still had to take some orders from\nthem--we were soldiers. So, when Warsaw uprising started I had to go to my unit; I was two\nmonths in the army. I was useful after one year's nursing school. I was with a paramedics group; it\nwas four or five girls in this group. We stayed two months together, being almost killed many,\nmany times, but at this time, at least, I was no different than the other people; we were all fighting\nwith Germans. But it was not also so easy, I remember when the Polish soldiers from uprising were\nleaving Stare Miasto and going through sewerage and they are taking them in the night through the\nopenings in the street. One of the girls told me later that when they were taking her out--she had\nvery black hair like I had but I don't think she was Jewish--one of the people helping her said, \"Why\nshould we help you, you are Jewish\", and pushed her away. Of course other people said, \"No, no,\nshe is with us.\" But mostly at this time it was not important how do you look, everyday we could be\nkilled, not once, but many times. The uprising finished in end of September 1944, and we were\ntaken to a camp, to Pruszkow. It was a big camp and most of the people were taken to Germany.\nWe went with my friend Sophia and her mother from Warsaw to Pruszkow. Then we were taken to\nthe train; the train was going very slowly through the station and we jumped from the train. The\ntrain was open, they didn't have a roof, if somebody helped you, you could jump over. Then I\nstayed with them in their friend's house. I was very sick, I had pneumonia. We all had louse, we",
        "were very dirty, probably not eating for many days. Even I don't remember, I think I was not\ncompletely conscious. The people were very nice, they gave us baths and clean clothes. Our\nclothes were only to be burned; they were so dirty and louse-infested. I have some kind of foggy\nmemory of this place. I stayed through October, 1944, and in November, my mother find that I\nsurvived, and she survived and my brother survived. They were in a completely other part of the\ntown; we did not know about each other for more than three months. My mother came and she took\nme away to some big house for displaced persons from Warsaw, near Krakov. It was terribly dirty\nplace and we were happy if we had one small bed for two people. Everybody sleeps two people on\none bed, or if it was worse, three people on the bed. We were very hungry, there was a small\namount of food and the people were very unpleasant for us. And on the end of November, I went to\nKrakov myself and I found myself a job in a small chronic hospital for old and displaced people.\nThey were very short with any help and they took me immediately when I told them I finished one\nyear of nursing school. It was the most terrible place that I ever worked, but at least I was able to\nsurvive. I was living in a small room with another woman and they gave us some food twice a day,\nand we knew the war would finish soon. And war finished for us, in January 1945. I was working\nover there for two months.\nWho liberated you?\nThe Soviets, of course. The war finished and immediately when the university opened in Krakov, I\nwanted to go to Medical School in Krakov, I was not admitted. They told me that I didn't finish\nhigh school. I had some small proof of my final exams but they said it was not enough. In fall,\n1945, I moved from Krakov with my mother and my brother to Ntoctaw--Breslau in Silesia. It was\nan easy town for some reason--it was easy to have an apartment. The town was destroyed, but still\nthere were some good houses. The Germans were sent to Germany as displaced persons. And we\ngot some nice apartment and I was admitted to medical school and my brother went to gymnasium\nand my mother got a job as a librarian in the Polytechnical School in Ntoctaw. So we started some\nkind of normal life. We were very poor, of course. My mother's salary was very low and it was\ndifficult for us to live. I had some strange jobs during my years at medical school, trying to make a\nlittle money. My father was helping a little--my father was in England sending some parcels,\nsometimes with food and sometimes with something what we could sell. And this way we survived\nand I finished medical school and I stayed in Poland. I was married, I had children and I left Poland\nin 1971.\nI want to thank you very much for your very candid...\nBut I think I should add, I almost feel obligated to add what has happened to other members of my\nfamily. The family on my father's side, they mostly converted before the war and nobody, or almost\nnobody went to ghetto. They stayed on the Polish side and they had a very difficult time. They",
        "were wealthy and if you had money, of course it was easier to survive. But, also, you were under\nconstant attention of informers that are coming to the house and telling, \"Well, give us some money,\nyou Jew, give us some money. If not we will go to the Gestapo and the police.\" We were so poor\nand it was so obvious that we don't have any money that the informers did not pay much attention to\nus because we were not attractive for them. So one of my aunts always said we survived the war\nbecause you were too poor to be of interest for anybody. And, some of them survived and some of\nthem they were given by informers to police and Gestapo and they were killed. In my mother's\nfamily, almost everyone was killed. They never converted, they were Jewish and everybody knew\nthey were Jewish. They never changed their name--their name was Dajches and they all perished in\nAuschwitz. I gathered all the names for Yad Vashem. It was more than twenty people.\nI'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything else you would like to add, any episodes you didn't recount\nto me, or anything else you would like to say to me at this point?\nI think only that 1t can be said much better than I did. I try to keep on facts. I think, basically, that's\nall. Thank you.",
