        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: It\u2019s nice to see you finally.",
        "A: I\u2019m happy to be here.",
        "Q: Thank you. Wh-What is your name?",
        "A: Well, if you want to know how they baptized me, it was Berendina Roelofina Hendrika\nEman. And I was only five pounds, I think that\u2019s a crime to a baby.",
        "Q: Five pounds?",
        "A: Yeah. I think that\u2019s a crime to a baby. But my mom lost her mother when she was 11, and\nthen she got a stepmother who brought them up, they had five kids, and they got still\nfrom the second marriage. So she thought when I was born, and she didn\u2019t think she\nwould get -- I was seven years after the other kids. Sh -- I thought I would be the last one,\nso she named me after her stepmother, Berendina. And then she thought, \u201cI should honor\nmy real mother, too, Roelofina.\u201d And out of that second marriage she had a baby sister\nthat she adored, Hendrika, so I\u2019m stuck with thro -- three names.",
        "Q: So how did Diet come?",
        "A: Now, then -- in the Netherlands, little kids always the name ends in an E, that means\nyou're little, that -- they chop that off 1 -- 1f you\u2019re big. But they called me Dinie,\nBerendina, Dinie, chopped off. And then, to their big surprise, 13 months later there came\na little brother, and we were always together, and one day an aunt picked me up, and I\nwas away the whole day, and he was crying the whole day, and he just started talking,\nDietdee, Dietdee, Dietdee, and they didn\u2019t know what -- what he wanted. But when I was\nbrought back, Dietdee, and then they knew he called me Dietdee, so then I was Dietdee,\nand then it was they co -- chopped off -- you know, so --",
        "Q: They chopped off the E.",
        "A: -- and -- Diet, and when you write it our way, here they call me Diet, so -- because that\u2019s\nhow you write it.",

        "A: Now -- in the -- in the Netherlands --",
        "Q: In the Netherlands.",
        "A: -- it\u2019s an E, that\u2019s how you say the E, Diet.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019ve had a number, although I don\u2019t want the stories associated with it, but\nyou \u2019ve had a number of -- of false names.",
        "A: Oh yeah, a whole bunch.",
        "Q: Yes, ho-how many did you have, three, four?",
        "A: Yeah, I think -- it depends with which group, if I thought that my name was getting -- but\nall of us in the Resistance had false names.",
        "Q: False names.",
        "A: And with some I was Toos, and with some I was Dinako, that 1s another abbreviation.\nAnd then I left there, and I was -- I was nearly arrested on the name of ar -- I had to find\nanother name again, that they knew my false name.",
        "Q: That\u2019s when you became --",
        "A: And then I thought -- the guy who made the false papers, he said, \u201cWhat do you want to\nbe your name?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, Ill take the name of the queen, Wilhemina.\u201d And that\u2019s the\nname I was arrested on, so --",
        "Q: Right, right. I want to know something about your family. You had three siblings, yes?",

        "Q: And Albert?",
        "A: Albert is the youngest.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And Stephana, Fanny?",
        "A: Stephanie, yeah, Fanny, they say Stephanie. No, in the Netherlands you say Stephana, but\nhere it would be Stephanie, and then I had a brother after that, and he had an old Dutch\nname, Arjen, A-r-j-e-n, Arjen, it\u2019s a beautiful old Dutch name. So they had both of one\nname, and then Albert came, and he only has one, and I am stuck with those three.",
        "Q: And what was the difference in age between you and Fanny, and --",
        "A: My oldest sister was eight years older, and then -- so seven years with my other brother.",
        "Q: Right. And what was your father\u2019s name?",
        "A: Gerrit, G-e-r-r-i-t, Gerrit.",
        "Q: Herrit with a G.",

        "A: Johanna Maria.",
        "Q: Johanna Maria, that\u2019s beautiful.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what did you father do?",
        "A: He had an interior decorating business, he was wallpapering, and floor covering, and he\nhad a man who did all the upholstery, and he did everything in interior decorating, and he\nhad people working for him, and he loved it, because I remember in -- when he was in his\n80\u2019s -- you know, loads of people say that you die -- if I would come back, I would be\nsomething different. And I said -- Father was in his 80\u2019s, I said, \u201cDad, if you would come\nback?\u201d He said, \u201cI would go exactly the same.\u201d",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: He loved his work. And he was recommended by a very well known architect, and that\narchitect worked for the lower nobility, you know, we still had dukes, and earls, and\nwhatever. And he always recommended my dad, so he had [indecipherable] royal library,\nmy father always had. In the summer they closed it, they had to check the curtains and\neverything, so -- he had a good business.",
        "Q: So he 0 -- he owned the business?",
        "A: Y -- he started it as a young guy, and just --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- because he loved his work, so he gave quality --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- work, and they recommended.",
        "Q: And did your mother work as well?",
        "A: Mom took the phone calls, but Mom -- she had four kids, and at the time you ha -- didn\u2019t\nhave laundry machines, or you didn\u2019t have all the stuff we have, so it was a full time job.",
        "Q: Were you comfortable financially during this time?",
        "A: We had -- we were not wealthy, but we were comfortable, we never had -- except for the\nwar, hunger, or whatever. No, it was -- we had a good life.",
        "Q: Did you want --",
        "A: They sent us -- we had music lessons, and you know, that --",
        "Q: You played piano, didn\u2019t you?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I was not very talented, but Mom insisted all four of us had to take -- my\nbrother is really good, he can play any instrument he sees. He could be a professional\ncellist.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: He plays beautiful, oh. And that was his life, but you know, then he wanted to go\nprofessional, but people said to him -- now, he studied for fun six hours a day, forget it. I\nmean, I thought an hour study every day at piano was already long enough, after all the\nschoolwork. But he just loved it. And -- but they said, \u201c\u201cNow it is your love, and then it\nbecomes your work.\u201d So then he went for awhile in Father\u2019s business, but he didn\u2019t like\nit. And he is now -- he studied psychology, and then he married a girl that got a job in\nSweden, in a -- in -- she was dietician, and Anthroposophy, that is the study of Rudolph\nSteiner, they believe in reincarnation, and that is what they are. And then he went to work\nthere, and it\u2019s all what he knew. He made -- now he -- he got higher up, and higher up,\nand then a father of a kid -- they -- they had lots of kids from other countries, in\nScandinavia Anthroposophy is very big, and there was a Danish girl there, and at one\npoint there was trouble in Sweden, he was in Sweden, and they -- th -- they were\n[indecipherable] to him, and he said, you know, you start something like this in Denmark,\nand he did. And he started with six kids, and now it\u2019s one of the biggest things, and the\ngovernment asks, take our kids, take our kids, and it has grown. But he has only the very\nseverest mentally handicapped children, who miss a part of their brain. And they have\ntaught them everything. I mean, it\u2019s as in the Bible, everybody has a gift, and those kids\njust as well. And one is musical, and another one can paint, and another one have[\nindecipherable] things, silversmithing, they do everything. And they have an artist staff,\nand my brother directs, and I couldn\u2019t believe it. There\u2019s -- the -- the television theme,\nand the radio themes [indecipherable] were playing for us. They do not Mary had a little\nlamb, but they do the children\u2019s symphony of Haydn, and none of those kids can read a\nnote of music, I said, \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d He says, \u201cCome along.\u201d And then he has a\nteacher who plays flute, and the kids who want to play flute, look, and they play and they\nmake a few mistakes when the teacher is playing, and the second time they do much\nbetter, and the fourth time they playing without any mistake, and so all the instruments,\nand then they do it together. No, it\u2019s terrific, what he does.",
        "Q: Te -- tell me about your parents, what were they like as people, and being your mother\nand father?",
        "A: My father had a terrific sense of humor. And he was such an honest businessman. I only\nhad very good examples, because you know, when the war broke out, the Germans took\neverything to Germany, but my father had a big supply of drapes, and whatever, he had a\nbig supply. And then all the others, you know, they raised their prices, they could just\ndouble it, or what. My father said, \u201cI\u2019ve worked 30 years for those people,\u201d and he just\nput his normal thing. So I saw that he was not out for money, he was for honesty, and he\nloved his customers. And Mom, Mom was his sweetheart, and the -- I mean, it was a real\n-- they were 64 years married when they finally died, and --",
        "Q: 64 years?",
        "A: Yeah, 64 years. And I can only say she was always, you know, benda -- baker came at the\ndoor, and the milkman came at the door, and the man for the benzena -- you had those\nlittle things, or whatever, it\u2019s not gasoline, kerosene, came at the door, and then in the\nwar, there were no cars, I mean it was with a horse and a -- and a cart, and when it was\nice cold, Mom always said, do you want a cup of hot coffee, or hot chocolate, or\nsomething. So I had good examples.",
        "Q: So did you spend a lot of time with your parents, were they with you a lot?",
        "A: Father was very busy, because in the spring especially, everybody wanted Eman,\nsometimes that he left the house at six, and came home at 10. So we always had our hot\nmeal in the evening, if Father would be home. But he tried every time -- it\u2019s his own\nbusiness, it\u2019s difficult to break out, but I remembered it for a long time when we were\nearly teeners, that he tried always to be home Friday or Saturday night, and then we did\ngames and things, and we could invite our friends.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And the other -- our house was always the center of young people, and we had an organ,\nand the piano, and the cello, so there was a lot of classical music.",
        "Q: You had an organ and a piano?",
        "A: Piano, and --",
        "Q: An upright piano, or a --",
        "A: An upright piano, it was a very [indecipherable] Steinbach. And the organ, that were\nthose Dutch, little -- that you still had to --",
        "Q: That worked with the foot, yes.",
        "A: So -- but we had that, and we all had to learn music, oh.",
        "Q: So you -- you would say your childhood was a very joyous one?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you were close with your --",
        "A: Parents. Now, when you are early teen, you know, you get rebellious --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- and you -- you -- and I remember that if we had a mood, you know, if you came down,\nand you are in a bad mood, and Mom would just kindly say, \u201cOh, we don\u2019t loo -- want to\nlook at that face. Go back to your room, and come back when you can have a\n[indecipherable] face.\u201d And then you got back and you say, \u201cWhat am I doing\n[indecipherable] thing? It was very -- you know, but when you a teenager, you sometimes\nbecome difficult.",
        "Q: Yes. And school, did you like school?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: I was a straight A student, it came all easy, yeah.",
        "Q: Really? It came easy to you?",
        "A: And mostly this in languages or what we call [indecipherable], what 1s it? Sciences. But I\ncould -- I -- I think that God gave me a good speller. Brains [indecipherable] brains, it\nwas all very easy.",
        "Q: Did you have favorite subjects? Was language it -- were --",
        "A: The languages were my favorite, yeah.",
        "Q: Was your favorite.",
        "A: And we had -- it was like I told you, every day an hour in each language, French,\nGerman, English and Dutch, and for the finals you had to -- to read 10 books in each\noriginal language, so 10 in French, and -- and you had to memorize three poems, and not\nMary had a little lamb, but of Longfellow, or something, in each language.\n[indecipherable] from the Germans. And our exams were not [indecipherable] the school,\nthey had -- you had the parochial schools, the Christian schools, and the public schools.\nAnd I lived in The Hague, and when it was exam time, it was June, then -- or July, then,\nthis section of The Hague, whatever school you were, had to come to a big gimnasium,\nand there were all tables, and the papers were face down, and government guys from the\nDepartment of Education, they were walking -- you were not to talk, you were not\nallowed to go to the bathroom. The bell rang, and then you could turn your paper, and\nthen you had so much time for that subject.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And you enter the next subject. And you have two days in writing, and then one day oral,\nand the oral was three weeks later, mostly, after the [indecipherable]. And it was also for\ngovernment guys, [indecipherable] and then you came in the gym, and there were all little\nround tables, three guys sitting, French, English, German, math, geometry, geography,\nand history, and then each half an hour. And you came to the French table, and then they\nsaid, \u201cWhich books have you read?\u201d So you have to sh -- in French, and then you have to\nshow it. And they said in French, tell that and that episode out of that and that book. And\nyou had to do it in French, which is very hard, you know? And so we\u2019re -- and then this\npoem, and then you have to recite the poem. So [indecipherable]",
        "Q: I realize I forgot to ask you two questions. One, what\u2019s the date of your birth?",
        "A: April 30\", 1920.",
        "Q: 1920. And you were born in The Hague?",
        "A: In The Hague. And that was also the birthday of our crown princess, Juliana. So -- and\nthen all the flags were out, and the schools were closed, and every morning there were\nparades, and my Mom always told me, \u201cThat\u2019s for you.\u201d You know, it was the big\ndisappointment when I found out it was for Juliana. But I was still happy that I was born\non her birthday, so --",
        "Q: That\u2019s funny. Tell me from -- I read your autobiography, and the place of religion in your\nlife is really extremely significant, or maybe it\u2019s just God, I don -- I don\u2019t quite know\nhow to --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So if you can tell me about your - the way in which you were raised in terms of religion.",
        "A: Now, we went to church, and our denomination, Christian Reformed has two services,\nbut my parents said one time we want you to go, the second time, you may. So there was\nno to force like some parents do. And they always, you know, you went to catechism, and\nyou learned the Bible, and it was really a life thing, you know, and you had to -- and I\nstill think, I mean words are cheap, but then you have to do, and that\u2019s why I went -- we\nall went in Rothenberg, and I\u2019m really proud because after the war, years later, I had to\ngo -- in the Netherlands after the war, the queen made a new department, like you have\nhere, agriculture, and to -- now whatever, all the departments. And our queen said we\nhave a department of war documentation. And usually th-they still were looking for\nwitnesses, and by chance they found me in America, and I could help a little bit, so I was\nasked to come to the Netherlands, and I spoke to the big shot from this war\ndocumentation, and he told me that our denomination, Christian Reformed, and it\u2019s really\nsmall, were the highest in resistance, and also had given most of their lives. And I think\nwe are very principled. And sometimes it goes to the -- too stiff, you know, that -- but\nthat you have to want. But it was really [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Is -- is Christian Reformed a part of a -- the Protestant religion, or 1s it --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It is?",
        "A: The Reformed -- the state church in the Netherlands is Reformed, and then automatically,\nlike in England, the queen and the king are the head of the church. And at one point, I\nthink in the 1800\u2019s, there were people who said yeah, but if you are born a king or a\nqueen, doesn\u2019t make you a Christian. So they said, well, that\u2019s not right. And then there\nwere other things, a few more, I don\u2019t know exactly what, so they separated from -- but\nit\u2019s very close, it\u2019s only that -- you know, the [indecipherable] and we have been very\nlucky, because our fe -- our royal family are Christians and they are always members of\nthe Reformed church. But it\u2019s very close to the Reformed church, but it\u2019s smaller.",
        "Q: But Christian Reform is not the Reformed church, it\u2019s a different --",
        "A: It is a branch --",
        "Q: A branch --",
        "A: -- that broke off from the Reformed church.",
        "Q: And how would you characterize Christian Reform, and ho-how does one differentiate\nthat from --",
        "A: Now, they are very biblical. See, because I know here in America the Baptists honor the\nNew Testament, because they say that\u2019s the time that Jesus was born. But the Christian\nReformed see it, it was a fulfillment of the Old Testament, or the Torah, as the Jewish\npeople say. So we had really to study the whole Bible, and at our meals, I mean every\nday, and Father always started each meal with prayer, because if you read the Bible,\nwhen Jesus ate, it always said, \u201cAnd Jesus, looking up, thanked God for the meal,\u201d and\nthen he started eating. So, I mean, it\u2019s practically putting up, and I remember that our\nbreakfast could be that we had to go out in -- in -- you know, my brother, maybe to leave\nearlier for school, and Father sometimes left at six, but the [indecipherable] meal was\nalways that we sat at the table. And then my brother, who is the cellist, is studying, and\nwe -- we had a I-large house, and he was on the third floor, in the music room. And then\nwe all sat at table and Father wanted to say a prayer, and Albert wasn\u2019t there. So they go\nout, \u201cAlbert, you have to come, Father 1s sitting.\u201d You know, I felt like [indecipherable].\nAnd then he did the few, and he forgot it, and we had to call him again, so -- but then, we\nhad had our hot meal, and then Father always pulled the Bible out and read a small part\nof the Bible. He skipped what I call the dull part, you know, this one begat that, begat\nthat, begat that --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But -- so we knew the Bible, and every [indecipherable] it was a sacrifice that they sent\nus to the Christian school, they said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t support it, they don\u2019t.\u201d So every\nMonday morning, had to learn the psalm that you had Sunday. The parents were\n[indecipherable] if the kids [indecipherable] for Monday morning, you had to say your --\nwhat you had to memorize. And looking back, you know, then you hated it, but in the\ncamp, and in the prison --",
        "Q: It helped.",
        "A: You -- it -- I knew so many things by heart, and it came, and it was such a strength, and a\nhope for me. I\u2019m really grateful for that.",
        "Q: But when you were growing up, you were not always so --",
        "A: No, sometimes you thought, oh, you know -- but -- and -- and you had pastors who could\nkeep your attention, and some your -- I remember that I -- we had a church that had a\nroof, an all wooden, beautiful wood, and then they [indecipherable] just to decorate it,\nand I was counting.",
        "Q: You were counting.",
        "A: Yeah, that was -- if it was not an interesting sermon, but I think orchids do that.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you had a big house. How -- how big, because the -- the houses that I\nsaw, at least in Amsterdam --",
        "A: No, no, th-they -- 1t was when we lived in The Hague, my Mom -- my Mom\u2019s father was\na pilot in -- a pilot at sea, you know, to bring the ships in. And he was always at sea, and\na lot of our family were seafarers. So I think Mom brought a bit, and she always wanted\nto meet, but that\u2019s not good for a business. So then I think we moved west from a house\nto a bigger house, and that was very interesting, it was all -- it had steps, and then a\nplatform, and then there were two doors, and the right one was ours. But on the other\nside, where the street was, it had steps down, and there was souterrain, and -- it\u2019s called.\nAnd then you had -- came in the -- the lower floor, and there was Father\u2019s work store, and\nthere was a big family kitchen like the farmers have, and the -- behind it was a -- a yard.\nAnd we had -- they made a little pond in it, and we had little goldfishes. And then the\nfirst floor had in front, the room where the organ and the piano were, and in the back, the\nliving room. The second floor was Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s bedroom, and the room where\nmy Father received his customers, and then the floor up there, there were the girl\u2019s\nbedroom, and the boy\u2019s bedroom, and there was an attic. So it was more height, you\nknow?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then, at the end of the yard, there was a ya -- what do you call it? It was not a river, it\nwas much smaller, but it was a little stream, and behind that there was a big -- how you\ncall it here, now? [indecipherable], a big -- I think this is called a kaserne. All -- the\ncavalry, the horses were there, and that was a --",
        "Q: A barracks?",
        "A: Armory, armory.",
        "Q: Oh, ah.",
        "A: And that was where we loved it, because it was, you know, open, and space, and trees.\nBut in the morning, he [indecipherable] from the [indecipherable] and then -- and\nsometimes you heard the horses, I loved it, oh.",
        "Q: Did you have pets?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: We had two -- we had two cats, and a dog. And later I got two turtles, one was called Ole\nTuft, that\u2019s a Norwegian name, and the other one, was [indecipherable] the time of\nEthiopia was Haile Salas.",
        "Q: And so you called it Haile Salas? Yes?",
        "A: And I think I was nine, and I was always brushing the dog, and also push -- polishing his\nteeth, and anyway -- and I felt so neglectful that I never did anything for those turtles, and\nwhen I called them, they stuck their neck out, and they had -- so I took furniture polish,\nand I polished them, and they were so beautiful shiny, and three days later they were\ndead, and my father said that I had clogged up all their pores.

        "Q: Better in death, that\u2019s -- were most of your friends of the same religious denomination\nthat you --",
        "A: We lived in that street, and we were all teeners, and we had such a fun [indecipherable].\nA little bit further lived a family with three boys, and we were all -- so you had -- yeah, in\nGermany, the stuff was getting -- is Hitler, so one of the boys then turned out to be a\nNazi, and the oldest was a Communist, and the in-between was in-between. And so they\nwere different, and of course, was another couple, a young girl, and her brother, her older\nbrother, Paul and Jopie and they -- they were nothing, and now they were just --",
        "Q: In -- in The Hague, were there -- were there many Jews living in The Hague?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: There were. Jewish population.",
        "A: We had a large Jewish quarter, with synagogues, and very beautiful old synagogue there\nwas, there were a lot of Jewish people. But you know, that is the beautiful thing of the\nNetherlands. In [indecipherable] they were persecuted in Portugal and Spain, and they\nwere killed and burned by the Inquisition. And in England you can read the books, that\nthey look down upon the Jews. Germany definitely, Austria definitely, France also a little\nbit. And [indecipherable]. So they came, and in those years, loads of them came to the\nNetherlands, and they said -- you know. And so we had loads of German Jews, and -- no,\nof Dutch Jews who had been there for centuries.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So they were -- they were very integrated in the --",
        "A: Very integrated -- because I was working at a bank later, when I had my first job next to\nHerman and [indecipherable] -- he was Jewish, but later he told me he didn\u2019t even know\nit, his parents didn\u2019t do anything on their religion. But we had so many Jewish people,\nand y -- that didn\u2019t make any difference.",
        "Q: And did you grow up, and have friends who were -- who were Jewish kids?",
        "A: Who were not Christians, yeah.",
        "Q: And there was not -- there was not a problem between --",
        "A: You didn\u2019t even think about it.",
        "Q: Right, uh-huh.",
        "A: They were your friends, or they were not your friends --",
        "Q: Right, that\u2019s --",
        "A: -- you liked them, or you did not like them, but it was the only [indecipherable], you\nknow, it was no difference, that was --",
        "Q: So, when you were 13 years old, and Hitler comes to power in Germany, are you -- are\nyou very conscious politically at that age, or is --",
        "A: No, at 13, not really.",
        "Q: No. So --",
        "A: And then Hitler was in the beginning, you know, he started in Bavaria, and so on, and we\nheard about it, and we really thought well, a big screamer. We already knew he had a big\nmouth, and he was always screaming.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But then h-he grew in power, and then when Hindenburg gave over, I mean then he was\nthe boss, and then we realized. But I -- then we started to realize, but still not to the extent\nthat it really --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- we really were made aware by the danger -- we heard that the Hitler youth was, and I\nwas [indecipherable] vacation, I think was 15 or 16, at the eastern part of the Netherlands,\nwe were somewhere at the farm, and that we learned -- we had lots of friend -- with my\ntwo girlfriends, and we were biking, and the border was not controlled, it was close to the\nborder, and we met a couple of German kids, germ -- and they were in the Hitler youth,\nand they were fanatic, and fanatic. And I was surprised, I thought aw, you know. But my\ngirlfriends were open for it, they listened, and they were very impressed. And then later,\nin \u00b038, so it was maybe two years later, you know it, that Kristallnacht, that those -- and\nin the he -- at that time, I remember in the papers, they pretended that it was a\nspontaneous uprising of the young people against those Jews who are doing all this\ncriminal whatever.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But it wasn\u2019t, it was very organized, but [indecipherable] later -- that turned out later that\nthey found that. So, and then yeah, they killed so many Jews, and they took prisoners,\nand they burned the synagogues, and that is when really we were aware of the danger of\nthe Nazi [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So it was 1938 when you became --",
        "A: \u00b038. November nine was the Kristall --",
        "Q: Right, right, but a year before that, somebody comes and lives with your parents --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- a person who becomes very significant to you. Can you tell us about it?",
        "A: That was funny, because my parents always tried to help everybody, and what do you call\nit in the church, the guy that takes care that the ha -- is clean, and whatever, the janitor --",
        "Q: Janitor?",
        "A: -- or whatever. He didn\u2019t clean himself, but that was a couple without kids, and they once\nin awhile came to visit us. They had no children, and my parents invited them now and\nthen. So one day they ask if he wanted to come, and he talks to my parents, and he said,\n\u201cT have a friend, a Friesian,\u201d they were often [indecipherable] and they\u2019re very proud, and\nhe says, \u201cAnd he lost his wife, and he has 10 kids, and now the oldest has gotten a job in\nThe Hague,\u201d with -- they start with paying so little. See, now the kids go either in the\ndorms, or in an apartment or something. But there was no way at that time. So he asked if\nthat guy could come in our house, and my mother said, \u201cI can\u2019t have a boarder.\u201d She had\n[indecipherable], the phone was always ringing, and people came that they wanted to talk\nto my dad, and she was very busy, and you had no laundry machines, no nothing. So she\nsaid, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d And then he said oh, but -- well, you know. So in the end, my father\nsays, \u201cI need to talk to Wilmer, that\u2019s her decision. She has a,\u201d -- and then in the end my\nmom said, \u201cI can\u2019t have a boarder, but I can have another child.\u201d So he ca -- and I was so\nfurious because The Hague is very old city, and you know, the -- the houses at that time\ndidn\u2019t have a shower and a bathroom. I mean, you had a toilet, but that -- you had\neverywhere those -- what do you call 1t, those basins when -- where you washed yourself,\nand Saturday night you could either go to a public bathhouse, that you had to pay, or you\ncould wash yourself from top to toe, but that was -- at that time, it was 1938 and so. And\nthen, with my brothers, my -- at that time, in \u00b038, my oldest brother had already left for\nIndonesia, he -- he was in the Air Force. Anyway, you ran in your house 1n your\nunderwear, and in your slip, and whatever, and that were your brothers, but if you have a\nstrange guy, you have to put your gown on, and it\u2019s totally different. So I just hated it, to\nhave -- and he had a nice -- I didn\u2019t want an intruder in the house. And then I was so\nangry, I think, that I didn\u2019t speak to my mom for days. And then she said I am so angry\nabout it [indecipherable], I hate it. And I thought, well, I\u2019m going to dislike this guy, I\nmean, he\u2019s an intruder in our house, and I thought -- his name was Hein, now that is a\nfarmer\u2019s name, I hated it. And I thought in -- in the Netherlands -- in here it is beautiful,\nbut in the Netherlands it was horrible if you had red hair. Then they called you carrot top,\nor all the lighthouses had red -- or a lighthouse. So the kids really unmercifully\n[indecipherable], and mostly they had freckles, of course. And then you\u2019ll see he has a\nred hair, and freckles, and boo -- and I was so -- I thought, well, I don\u2019t like him. And\nthen, he would --",
        "Q: Wait a minute, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to have to continue this after we stop the\ntape.",
        "A: Okay. That he broke your heart?",
        "Q: Yes.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: So we were talking about Hein coming to your house.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: What -- what -- his name is Hein, and his last name?",
        "A: H-e-i-n, Hein. And --",
        "Q: It\u2019s Hein.",
        "A: -- in -- in Dutch we say Hein. And I think like in German, you have Heinrich, you know?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: That\u2019s a German name, so this is -- and it\u2019s a name in Friesland, that\u2019s in the northern\npart, and he was from there.",
        "Q: And his last name?",
        "A: Sietsma, S-1-e-t-s-m-a, Sietsma.",
        "Q: Sietsma.",
        "A: All the Friesian names end of ma or sta. That\u2019s so funny -- in that province there.",
        "Q: Really? Huh. So, did you adjust after a few days to his being there, or did it take you a\nwhile to?",
        "A: I remember that I said I\u2019d -- he would come on a Saturday afternoon, I said, \u201cI won\u2019t be\nhome.\u201d And Mom said, \u201cI have to do a few -- a little bit of shopping, but Ill see he\nwould come late in the afternoon.\u201d And I\u2019m home alone, and the doorbell rings, and there\nstands this handsome guy. But then it was Hein, I had to open him, and I was alone home,\nand I hated him. And I\u2019d made up my he -- my mind that I would hate him. So, even if he\nlooked very nice, I hated him, because that is what I had decided. And I wasn\u2019t nice to\nhim at all, and he fell in love with me, and he told my mom. And then later he made\nfriends at the office, and he went to a study group from my church, young men, so then\nthree of them rented an apartment, so he was -- I don\u2019t know, maybe half a year in our\nhouse. But my parents got to love him like a son, and I tolerated him, because I\u2019d made\nup my mind. You know how stubborn you can be.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then when the war -- when he -- they were all mobilized, you know, when the threat\nin \u201939 came, and the end of \u201938, so -- and he had to be at the river, the IJssel, that goes\nparallel with the German border. And there were bunkers near the water, so -- oh, and\n[indecipherable] and they were often there. And because he had been so long 1n our\nhouse, our family wrote him that was the only thing they had. See, now they have those\nnice military homes where they can go for reading a paper, and play piano, and do card\ngames, there was nothing. They slept in [indecipherable] and everybody was mobilized,\npeople with businesses, and there was nothing. So I remember that in the pulpit, and in\nthe papers, it said open your house for the military, and invite them. So with that -- that\narmory right behind our house, Momma wrote a note, Christian family with organ and\npiano, somebody wants to come is welcome, for in the evening, reading the papers, or --\nand then the two Friesians came, and they later told that they quick had taken the paper\noff. So they became like brothers, and Hein was there alone on that -- so we wrote him all\nthe time. And then I had also to write my little note. Father wrote, Mother wrote, Albert\nwrote, my sister wrote. So I -- and then you have here only one word, dear. I-If you write\na business letter you start dear, but also if you love somebody, but we have different\nwords. So the first letters that I wrote was Beste, that is distance, you know, Beste. And\nthen I remember when it really got dangerous, I all of a sudden thought, \u201cOh my God, if\nhe gets hurt or killed,\u201d and then I realized I loved him, but it -- it was really -- and I\nthought -- but in the Netherlands, you know, I think the girls right now, they go after the\nboys, but you didn\u2019t do that back then. And I loved this -- stupid, idiot, I was -- and all\nmy girlfriends were in love with him, and I thought oh, this is terrible, I -- and I told my\nmom, she said, \u201cWell, he was in love with you, he told me.\u201d But then she had told him,\nshe\u2019s not yet ready for it, because -- this is crazy, I -- I really don\u2019t dare to tell this, but I\nmust have been 17, and he came in our house, and I had those two girlfriends, and my\nbrother and his friends, and I was a tomboy. And then Saturday afternoons when we had\noff from school, we often had school Saturday mornings still, we went on our bikes\noutside The Hague, and we have so many canals, and ditches, and trees everywhere, and\nwe had the greatest fun that we took a run, and then tried to jump a ditch. And every time\na rider went in the [indecipherable] always one of us would fall in. You --",
        "Q: You mean, with the bicycle? You would try to run a ditch?",
        "A: No, no",
        "Q: Oh, you would run --",
        "A: We put the bicycles on the meadow, and then we took a run --",
        "Q: And then you -- I see.",
        "A: -- and jump. And we climbed trees, and we had so much fun, we play -- I don\u2019t know, I\nthink I was very late that I was mature. But anyway, then Hein ask me all the time, Hein\n[indecipherable] let\u2019s go for a bike ride, let\u2019s go for -- to the dunes, or something. And,\nno I -- I didn\u2019t like him, you know, that was my -- so one Saturday afternoon, my friends\nall had to go to their grandmother in the city, that they could go on a bike, but it was\nmaybe two hours. So they weren\u2019t there, and Hein asked again, and oh well -- well, I\u2019ve\nnothing better to do. So I went, and I told the girls, he asked me again to bike -- go\n[indecipherable]. So then they asked me when I came back, how was it. I said, \u201cSo\nboring, we never climbed a tree.\u201d But he was I think 18, close to 19 and was much more\nmature. So that was the only thing, and then when I realized this, then he -- he wrote us\nback, and then one day I got a letter, and it was directed to me, and then he wrote, \u201cMy\nnext leave, I want come to The Hague.\u201d And he had been before, but it was always for\nthe family, you know. He said, \u201cAnd this time it\u2019s not for the family, it\u2019s just for you.\u201d\nAnd I was happy as possible. So then he came, and then it clicked.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: With [indecipherable]. He was a wonderful person, always living for others, and thinking\nthat he was so selfish.",
        "Q: Were you working in -- in the bank in 1937? [indecipherable]",
        "A: It was a big, beautiful old bank in the center of the city, and I was -- I had there, with the\ninformational section.",
        "Q: And was that the same time that you met Hein?",
        "A: That I met --",
        "Q: Or was that afterwards?",
        "A: No, I was -- I stayed there shur -- they paid very little. And then I got an offer to work\nsomewhere else, and they paid better, so -- and I took those Spanish lessons, because see,\nthat degree was four years, and I can -- languages come fast, and you just sit in your\nclass, and you have a couple [indecipherable] you back. So I found a profess -- professor\nwho said, \u201cI\u2019ll prepare you for that exam,\u201d -- I asked him. I said, \u201cThen load me up with\nhomework, and I come once a week, an hour that you can check, and whatever.\u201d And I\nhad to pay him, I think three quarter of my salary, but I did it with -- just within two\nyears. So -- and that was worth it. And then I still took another exam, but I needed -- with\nmoney for my -- because I had hardly any left for myself with pocket money, so when\nthey offered this -- it was -- with the other one, was a government job, and it was for the\nfather of a youth friend of mine, who lived three years across from me. So she said, \u201cMy\nfather needs a secretary,\u201d so then I went, and they paid better. But the war days, I was in\nthe bank.",
        "Q: During the war?",
        "A: Right, days of the war.",
        "Q: During the first five days of the war?",
        "A: We had -- well, see we fought. Denmark didn\u2019t get one bullet. And Sweden let them go\nthrough and attack Norway. Norway fought. And Belgium didn\u2019t have an army.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I -- we later learned that Hitler had like all travel agents [indecipherable] you know,\n[indecipherable], from us go 10 days to Europe, Wednesday morning for the Netherlands,\nWednesday afternoon for France, Tuesday for Switzerland, and so. And Hitler made a\nschedule for the war, and he had given Monday for the Netherlands, but he forgot that we\nare very stubborn, and we fought five days.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In the afternoon of the fife -- fir -- fifth day, they bombarded the open city of Rotterdam\nin the center, where there was nothing military. Hospitals, museums, churches,\ncathedrals. And thousands died , and it was -- and then their general said to our general,\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t surrender [indecipherable] to The Hague, I\u2019m [indecipherable].\u201d\u2019 And he\nsurrendered after five days.",
        "Q: So -- right.",
        "A: But those five days of the war, I was in that bank.",
        "Q: In the bank. So you\u2019ve known Hein now for three years, when the war comes in 1940 to\nthe Netherlands [indecipherable]",
        "A: Two and a half years, it came at the end of the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So -- right. So you essentially, within six or eight months, you realize you\u2019re in love with\nthis guy. And this is the first time you\u2019ve had a boyfriend, am I right?",
        "A: Now, you had -- you know, when we went -- playing robbery so-called, you had friends,\nbut that was nothing, you know, you didn\u2019t kiss or anything, but --",
        "Q: This was serious.",
        "A: -- but that was just special friend. I remember that there was a guy that I was at that\nChristian high school that was quite far away, and it was 45 minutes on the bike to go\nhome, and then all of us [indecipherable] and I saw Tim from our street, and biking next\nto me. \u201cOh, how nice to see you here. I had to go here,\u201d and so -- like it was casual, but\nhe came then, maybe they are 15 or 16, that was -- you know, the -- Tim was my friend,\nbut nothing else. But if he -- you know, we had -- we did funny -- fun games, and if there\nwas a fair, like a country fair, or so, you went with the whole group, and then --",
        "Q: Right. But this was quite different?",
        "A: Yeah, that was different. This was [indecipherable] just --",
        "Q: Were the girlfriend jealous because it was clear that he was in love with you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I bet.",

        "Q: So he was whe -- he was 1n your house for about six months, and then he was in an\napartment in The Hague?",
        "A: An apartment with his two friends.",
        "Q: And did you end up seeing each other a great deal at that point?",
        "A: It was so funny, because one was from another city, Zwollen, and if his girlfriend came\nover, and he was engaged, but it was no proper -- so they always -- the girlfriend from --\nthey [indecipherable] slept in our house, my mom was always -- it was really like the\nholiday, and we never knew. And the other one had a girlfriend who lived in The Hague.\nAnd we three girls are dear, dear friends. We hit it off so right. So we were mostly with\nthe whole group, and I\u2019m still now -- the two other guys died, later, from old age. But for\nall those years I was their friend.",

        "Q: She said that to you?",
        "A: They both --",

        "A: She was engaged.",
        "Q: -- right?",
        "A: And -- and she would have gotten married the year of the war, in September. And they all\nwere drafted, and her fiance had -- had signed a contract that if he went so many years in\nthe -- like here they do sometimes, and then you get free university study, so he had\nsigned up. And he was just ready to get out, and then the war broke out, a-and -- so he\nwas -- had to stay in that service, and he was assigned to a small airport, Ypenburg, just\noutside The Hague. And then the morning of the war, Hitler had the evening before given\na big speech, and I had heard it as ma -- and I knew German. And he said -- because by\nthat time, they had taken -- France was already occupied, because they had been able to\nhold it in ?39. And then he had taken Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, that was\nbeginning of the second World War, they had marched through Sweden, Norway. So\nonly that sliver of the Netherlands, and Belgium were not occupied by [indecipherable]\nFranco was Nazi, whole Europe was Nazi. So we were very, very nervous, and -- and\nHitler said, \u201cI know that the Dutch are scared, they don\u2019t have to be. They are very\nunimportant, and I don\u2019t need that piece of land.\u201d And then he said, \u201cAnd they were not\nin the first World War, and I will respect their neutrality.\u201d That were his literal words.\nAnd while he was saying that, at nine PM, his troops were already marching to our\nborders, and to our bridges, so he was a big, fat liar. And I think that that made me so\nfurious that I thought, \u201cHow did he have the guts to say this on the radio while he knew\nthis,\u201d -- from -- that made me so mad. And then, five days later, when they came in, with\ntheir goosestep, and their helmets, and their tanks, and their proud faces -- I remember\nthat they marched in [indecipherable] out standing the bank, and the tears were streaming\ndown our cheeks. And that\u2019s when I made my vow, I\u2019Il never, never speak one word of\nGerman. We have not invited them. And then -- and we saw what they were doing to our\nJewish people. I got really to -- to hate the Nazi system.",
        "Q: Did you not expect the Germans to come into the Netherlands, in spite of the fact that\nthey had attacked Poland, and they had gone into the other European --",
        "A: I think that our government -- I, as a girl of 19 didn\u2019t think so, because we hadn\u2019t been in\nthe first World War. But I later had, and it was nearly hilarious, that our government was\nbringing itself in [indecipherable] to stay neutral. So they had built bunkers towards\nGermany. So they built a few bunkers along the coast against [indecipherable]. You\nknow, it\u2019s really laughable when you think about it, that they were trying to be -- to be\nneutral, but --",
        "Q: Neutral. So it must have been a big shock to you after you heard Hitler\u2019s speech, when\nyou saw the troops come in.",
        "A: Yeah, I remember that night. See, in the Netherlands at that time it was so funny, because\nyou know, the -- the one -- like I say, it was really, the housewife was missing, because\neverything was made from scratch, now we go to the store. You had a store to go for your\nmeat, a store for your veggies, a store for this, for your tha -- dairy. So it took you time,\nan household was a whole day of work. And Monday was always laundry day, and all the\nwomen in the Netherlands, and Tuesday, I think they do -- did the ironing, and\nWednesday, in most houses, they did the living room, and on Thursday -- but Thursday\nwas always the day that -- well, there were no vacuum cleaners, but everybody had rug\nbeaters, and everywhere you heard bing, bang, bung. They hung it over things in the yard,\nand then they beat the rugs. And I remember that I woke up that night, and it was pitch\ndark, and I heard a noise like beating, but very fast. And half asleep, I thought, which\nidiot 1s beating the rugs in the middle of the night? And [indecipherable] it\u2019s much fast --\nand then I heard my parents stir in their bedroom, they must have heard it, too. And we\ngot up, and we went outside, and over our head was a battle between planes, and\nshooting. So then we went back in the house, and turned the radio on, and we heard that\nthey had invaded our country. And then the next morning, yeah, we are so faithful in all\nwe do, and I remember, here we were at war, and then Adriaan was killed -- I mean,\nAdriaan was the fianc\u00e9 of my sister, because [indecipherable], and we didn\u2019t know that,\nso he was one of the first ones who was shot, and killed, the early morning of May 10\".\nAnd I step on my bike and I went to my office. And I\u2019m in a big street, what then was a\nbig street, I was now in The Hague, and that wasn\u2019t so big, but it was still a light street.\nAnd I was stopped by Dutch police. And I thought, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d And they said, \u201cSay\nScheveningen.\u201d And I said it, that was the city where -- where Milosevic 1s now in the\nprison. And then I had to say Schapenscheerder. I don\u2019t know if you can say that.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: But that is the guy who shears the sheep. And the Germans couldn\u2019t say those words.\nAnd then I could say it, and then they let me go, and they said, \u201cThey are everywhere as\nspies among us.\u201d Because about a year and a half before the war, two years, you could\nget -- the families could get a German maid so cheap, and they lived in your house. But\nall those German maids, a lot of them were spies. And for a long time, every time from\nan air base, or an army base, or whatever, uniforms had disappeared. And they -- it was\nstill -- now you don\u2019t see it any more. I mean, in Vietnam, and in Korea, you don\u2019t see\nthe enemy, they just measure, and I -- shoot a bit farther, or lower, they [indecipherable],\nbut at that time they still saw each other, and our guys didn\u2019t shoot at the whole groups if\nthey came in our country our own uniforms, so it was, oh, I remember, I was so mad, and\nI still -- I think I have that, that if I see injustice, my hair goes up.",
        "Q: Did you have a fi -- a -- a fairly large army, or a very small army?",
        "A: No, small.",
        "Q: Very small.",
        "A: Small, was small.",
        "Q: And when was Hein drafted into the army, in \u201939, or f -- or -- or \u201940?",
        "A: I think the very end of 38, or the beginning of \u201939, I\u2019m not sure, but 1t was around that\ntime.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So he was in the army about a year before the --",
        "A: Yeah. And then he was pulled back, and he was in place called Ede, and I remember that\nAscension day, that\u2019s the day [indecipherable] really was at that church, you know, it\u2019s\n[indecipherable] any more, but he said come here, and that was in the middle, and there is\na little -- we are so flat, we have only -- but there is what we call the grebbeberg, that\u2019s\nanother word you can\u2019t say, but that was a little hill, and that was in the middle. And I\nwas so happy that he wasn\u2019t at the border any more, I thought that\u2019s the first thing. And\nso that day we spent, and he got from a friend a motorbike, and I was scared stiff, and he\nhad a good day, and then I went back to The Hague. And then a few days later, the war\nwas --",
        "Q: War\u2019s on.",
        "A: So then I found -- and I was worried stiff because the most were killed at the grebbeberg,\nand I didn\u2019t know what had happened to him. And I have it with me, then I got a\nsmudged card, a post card, I think dated May 13\", or was in the middle of the war days,\nand it came from Rotterdam. And he had moved [indecipherable], I didn\u2019t know that,\nfrom Ede to Rotterdam, and he was in that bombardment.",
        "Q: He was?",
        "A: He was. He was in that bombardment [indecipherable]. I didn\u2019t know it.",
        "Q: So I guess it was a good thing that you didn\u2019t know it.",
        "A: No, oh --",
        "Q: You were worried enough as it was.",
        "A: Oh, it was horrible.",

        "Q: Diet, your brother Arjan, your older brother had joined the army and was in Indonesia?",
        "A: He was a reserve officer in the Netherlands, where they all, after their training they wer --\nhad jobs. And he had -- it was a time of unemployment -- that was also to promote -- that\nHitler had so much success, there was such an unemployment everywhere, and he had a\njob, but very dull, and then at one point he got a letter that reserve officers were asked,\nvolunteers if they wanted to go to Indonesia. And he had such a boring job, so he went,\nand he was in the air force. And he was shot down when the Japs came in, and he had a\nbig piece of shell in his hip, and they took it out, and stitch it up, and they thought he\nnever walks again. So they put him in the hospital, and they really didn\u2019t watch him,\nbecause he couldn\u2019t walk, he was heavily wounded. But then it healed, and he had his -- I\ndon\u2019t know, I guess his [indecipherable] or whatever, and he practiced at night, because\nhe wasn\u2019t watched. And then at one time he escaped. And later I heard he had told other\npeople, \u201cI know that my little sister in the Netherlands [indecipherable] in the resistance.\u201d\nHe knew me, and he was a lot like I was. And I always thought, if he can do anything,\nhe\u2019 ll do it. And it\u2019s true, he found a lot of his guys again, and then around the city of\nBrondong, they did whatever they could, resistance. But then he was hiding in Kampong,\nthat\u2019s where the Indonesians live, their villages, and the settlement. But somebody knew\nthat, and they betrayed him, and he was arrested again, and then he was tortured to death,\nwe later heard. But he was really tortured to death by -- in a terrible, terrible prison, the\nSukamiskin. And nobody who went in there ever came out alive.",
        "Q: So he was captured twice, he escaped the first time?",
        "A: He was shot down first.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then he was captured after he --",
        "Q: So do you know about when that happened [indecipherable]",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know really the date. We don\u2019t know the date --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but we heard it from the Red Cross. And we had an uncle there, with his whole family,\nhe was a professor at the museum in Brondong. And that was his home. And this uncle\nhad a daughter who was studying in the Netherlands for teacher, and at that time the\n[indecipherable] was six years, because you had to go by boat, there were no planes, you\nhad to go by boat through the Suez Canal, that took six weeks. So that daughter in the\nNetherlands didn\u2019t have a home, so every vacation, Easter, Christmas, New Year, she\nwas in our house, she was like another sister. But when my brother went there, he had\nreversed it, it was his home there, his -- and they -- there were two other girls, and they\nwere there. They went later in those horrible camps, but they told us what happened.",
        "Q: And when did you find out about this, after the war?",
        "A: After the war. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: After the war, so you di -- you had no idea whether he was okay, or he wasn\u2019t okay --",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- the whole time.",
        "A: The only thing that you could once in awhile do was via the Red Cross, send a letter to\nnon-occupied, or allied countries, but it was heavily censored.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We'd never got to Indonesia, no it was no way.",
        "Q: So that was very tough on your family, I would imagine.",
        "A: Yeah, first my older sister, then my brother, then me. [indecipherable] mother.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Having the [indecipherable] couldn\u2019t help.",
        "Q: Right. What did you think when the queen and the government left the country, and went\nto England, at first?",
        "A: We were so disappointed, and so sad, and so furious. I have Hein\u2019s diary, he was furious.\nAnd we all felt -- you say the father of the fatherland we call the kings. She was the\nmother of -- and we said, which mother leaves her children alone when they\u2019re in\ntrouble? That\u2019s when you have to be there. And we loved th-the Belgian king, he stayed,\nand he stayed with his people. And you know what? The queen left with the whole\ngovernment, and they left us, and they fled, and they were [indecipherable] no, because\nthose ministers left their wives, and children in the Netherlands. It was really our\ngovernment that went to England. So that was our official government. And then the very\nserious Christians, you have obey what God says in the Bible. And in the time of Jesus,\nthey were occupied by the Romans.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s -- so a lot of denominations decided this is what God gives us, we have to obey\nHitler. But we thought further, and we thought, well, our official government, and our\nqueen -- all the hoyal -- royal families always crowned by the grace of God. It\u2019s a very\nserious ceremony when they are crowned. And our government was in England, so we\nfelt that we had total freedom, and yet obey what they told us. And later they told several\nunderground to blow up that munition, blow up that bridge, and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So did you wait? I mean, how long did it take you to decide that when the --",
        "A: Maybe a few months.",
        "Q: A few months.",
        "A: Because see, we also heard that we were a very wealthy country. They paid very low\ntaxes because we had Indonesia, with rich, rich, it\u2019s got everything, copper, tin, pewter,\nyou call that. And rubber, and oil. So that we had -- the royal family of the Netherlands\nwas considered one of the wealthiest in the Netherlands, too. They had [indecipherable]\nthat they could take our national treasury, but they took all the gold bars to England, so\n[indecipherable] found nothing, and then -- no, we -- and then the Belgian king, he had\nseveral palaces, they always had several, and then, okay, you stayed here, you go to\nLarpen, I think it was called, and it was a big, big garden, giant garden, with a wall\naround it, and you could never speak to these people. So did he serve them? No. I mean,\nour queen did really the wisest what she could do. So then that took some all months\nbefore they realized it.",
        "Q: And how were they communicating back? Did they --",
        "A: The government?",
        "Q: Yes, well from England.",
        "A: There were secret sendlers with the Netherlands, and so on. And our ministers were all\nthere. But then later -- see, in the beginning, the resistance, you don\u2019t know where to\nStart.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, you don\u2019t know. And that were all really little groups decided something has to\nbe done, and when they did, sometimes they [indecipherable] and very much later, years\nlater, they got together, and they formed the L.O., the Landelijke Organisatie, the\n[indecipherable] and they asked us also to be a member, but we thought was danger in\nbeing in a large group, and we had -- we were self-sufficient, we had stolen all the stuff.\nSo we said no. We knew all the people we worked with, and we trusted them, and we\ndidn\u2019t take part. But that\u2019s --",
        "Q: So tell me how --",
        "A: -- that secret sendler.",
        "Q: Did -- when -- when you saw the Germans come in, did you very quickly think in your\nhead, we have to do something, or did it take -- did it take time for you to --",
        "A: No, I remember when they marched in, I thought we have to do anything to get them out.\nBut you didn\u2019t know what yet. But you hated them.",
        "Q: Right. And did you talk with friends immediately, or --",
        "A: Now, then it happened that they started slowly, and I later read that Hitler had told Zize\nIngort, who we got as governor, and that was his reward, that he had betrayed Austria,\nand that Hitler had told him, the Dutch are Aryers, blue-eyes, blonde hair, that was his\nideal, and treat them with gloves, because they might want to be a province of Germany.\nNow, when I read that, I laughed so hard, I thought he has forgotten one national trait\nhere, very stubborn. And that was -- in a marriage it can be a problem, but here it was\ngood, so what Hitler told us to do, we didn\u2019t want to do, simply. So now -- and then s --\nbe -- as punishment, because we didn\u2019t obey, we got curfew. Now, we don\u2019t like to be\ntold to be home from 11 to six, so that was the first thing that [indecipherable] us all.\nThen all the transp -- nobody had a car, and that was not poverty, only businesses like\nSears, or whatever, had cu -- big trucks, but for the rest, nobody had a car. So we had\ntrams, terrific connections in -- in the city, and in all those buses. And it was a few\npennies, they went every three, four minutes, or you hopped on the tram, stepped over on\nthe bus, and there you were. That was the whole -- and then the [indecipherable], of\ncourse [indecipherable]. But all of a sudden the Jewish people weren\u2019t allowed to use\nthose any more. And then they started -- the Jewish people weren\u2019t allowed to visit the\nnon-Jews, so Herman couldn\u2019t come any more. And we couldn\u2019t visit Jewish people. And\nthey were telling us then -- because they were telling all lies over the papers, and over the\nradio, we di-didn\u2019t even bother any more, we turned BBC, that was the only -- that was\nforbidden. And if you still listened, you won\u2019t be -- I always tell the kids here, you\n[indecipherable] half the year to jail if you caught you listening to the BBC. Now, it\u2019s\nridiculous to go half a year -- and then we still listened, so we had to hand the radios in,\nand it went. So I mean, we got more and more irritated in the [indecipherable] so and so,\nso have to get out of this country. But then, you\u2019d still didn\u2019t know what to do, till\nHerman called me one day, and he said, \u201cDiet, I want to see you.\u201d I said, \u201cTo heck with\nHitler, you come to our house.\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t dare.\u201d Anyway [indecipherable] to my\nhouse, either. And then we met somewhere, and that was when the Jewish people started\nto get those papers, you have to leave your house, leave everything behind, and it was\nalways in the curfew, hours that we Dutch couldn\u2019t do a thing. And then --",
        "Q: So the Jews would have to be out during curfew to go to Westerbork? They would be\nsent to Westerbork?",
        "A: Dee -- that was always during the curfew.",
        "Q: So that no one else would be around?",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t be in the street --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- and we couldn\u2019t make a big riot. And they were allowed -- and you know that from all\nyour interviews, they were only allowed to take a little suitcase for each member, with a\nchange of clothing, a fork, knife, spoon, cup, and a blanket.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now, I mean, if you think -- and that still makes me now furious, you know, but you\nthink, they have a right to be there. Some of them were there since 1500. They had\nworked, they had done, they had earned their house, they have worked hard, and you\nhave not only in money value, but you have things that are handed down from family\ntradition, and kids who have pets. I mean, they had to leave everything behind, and I was\nsaying, what was their crime? Their crime was that they were born Jewish. And is that a\ncrime? I mean, I would say, that\u2019s what God decides, the color of your skin. I could have\nbeen born in Nigeria and be pitch black. I mean, you have nothing to say in that. So it\nwas such a terrible injustice, we had never seen anything like that. And I think now the\npeople was really -- are getting kind of -- you know, it\u2019s just the fact that I\u2019ve seen -- it\u2019s\nso horrible. And that night I saw Hein, and I told him, and Hein had read the book that\nHitler wrote, Mein Kampf. And then he said, oh he [indecipherable] because remember --\nand I forgot to tell him that you know that, the night that they invaded our country, that --\nthere was no place in Europe any more, there was no place. Many of those German Jews\ncommitted suicide. And the next day, I wished I had kept those papers, your heart broke,\nobituaries of father, mother, children, all the ages, they had all the German Jewish\n[indecipherable] and they committed suicide. And that was so horrible. And then -- then\nHein and I talked, we said, oh, and [indecipherable] Hitler hates them, he\u2019s going to do\nsomething terrible, but we still didn\u2019t know that they would be killed.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re not hearing anything from Europe, because by then they\u2019d attacked Russia, and\nthey start killing Jews. But you haven\u2019t heard anything.",
        "A: Was that in \u201940? \u00b041?",
        "Q: No. No, no, 42.",
        "A: No, this is later. But this was -- I think that the Jewish people got their notice the very end\nof \u00b041, beginning of \u00b042.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we had not heard anything about that, that came later, that\u2019s I think June. The -- this\nwas that Herman had to leave, and then we said that can\u2019t happen, but what could you\ndo? I mean, I was twen --",
        "Q: So let -- let me go back for a moment. There\u2019s a big strike in 1941, the worker\u2019s strike in\nFebruary.",
        "A: In Amsterdam.",
        "Q: In Amsterdam. Did -- di -- you had heard about this?",
        "A: We heard that later, but 1t was, of course not in the papers, although they shot a lot of\npeople, because like here you have now Rumsfeld, and Cheney, and so -- that when they\nmarch in our country and they weren\u2019t obeying the right way to do things, and we heard -\n- | later heard we were the only country where they did it -- all our own mayors and\ngovernment people are kicked out and all replaced by Nazis. And so [indecipherable] by\nGermans. So that was already unusual. And also they took right away, 70 of our top guys,\nand they were put in a prison, but it was a big monastery in Bravong. And that\u2019s -- it had\n-- it was from the middle age, had meter thick walls. And that\u2019s -- and they were\nhostages, and they told us, if you do anything, those guys will be shot. And they were.\nSome of them -- so they did, because several of them were shot.",
        "Q: I see. So you -- you have this -- the Germans come in, so talk between 1940 and \u201942. So\non the one hand, you\u2019re saying that the -- the Dutch hate the fact that they\u2019re there, want\nthem out, and at the same time, it\u2019s very difficult to know what you do when you have\nsuch a force as the Germans were. So you\u2019re caught in this dilemma.",
        "A: You -- we didn\u2019t know first what to do.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But, you know, when this happen, that Herman told me he had to leave, and that\u2019s where\nmy religion and Hein\u2019s religion came out in the first place. They were the con -- the\npeople that God had chosen to bring forth Jesus, the Messiah, it was for us. In the second\nplace, it says in the Bible, who touches them, and even if they believe that Jesus is the\nMessiah [indecipherable] they are the apple of God\u2019s eye, and who touches them, touch --\ntouches God\u2019s eye. And then also, we thought 1t was such an injustice, and Jesus said, do\nunto others what you want others to do unto you. So we felt we had to help, but we didn\u2019t\nknow what to. And Hein had read that book, and then we got talking, he said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s\nterrible,\u201d he said, \u201che\u2019ll go and do something terrible.\u201d And then all of a sudden Hein\nsays, \u201cI have an idea.\u201d His father was principal, out in the country, in farming\ncommunity, and they were all Christians, and all Christian area there. And all those kids\nhad -- from the farms, came to his school, and Hein was the oldest of 10 kids\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, [indecipherable] that he was born, probably. He was born\nin the other place, but he lived there his whole life. And those farmers gave him all those\nyears, the eggs, and they bought the eggs, butter, everything. So Hein knew all those\nfarmers, and also from the kids who came to school. And Hein says to me, \u201cYou know\nwhat? If I hop on the train, and ask any of those farmers if they will take Herman till the\nwar is over, I\u2019m sure they do it.\u201d And we thought, at that time, that was [indecipherable]\ntimes, the war would last a year, maybe a year and a half. So -- and then I called Herman,\nand I said, \u201cHerman, we have an idea.\u201d And I met him again. And he said, \u201cYes, please.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cAnd can you do my sister, too, Rosa, she is so scared.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat about\nyour parents?\u201d Because I knew -- he said no, my parents say -- and this is really ironic,\n\u201cGermany is an -- an civilized country, and it won\u2019t be so bad, we probably have to work\nhard, and how long will the war will last,\u201d -- we all thought 1t would be short -- and then\ncome back. And they did not want to go in hiding, and not be a bother to others. But\nHerman said he was dating a Jewish girl, and the father had already died, thanks to the\nGermans, and the mo -- she was an only child, and he says, \u201cAda is scared, and her\nmother is scared.\u201d So that was four. And then all of a sudden, they spread the news, and I\nthink within two or three weeks we have a list of over 60. And we -- Hein went to the\nfarms, and they didn\u2019t know me then, but he went, and they all said, \u201cSure, sure, send\nthem, send them.\u201d And that\u2019s how it started.",
        "Q: So how come people were so willing, di -- were the -- the Nazis not in the north? Were\nthey not occupying Friesland?",
        "A: They were.",
        "Q: They were there. And then but --",
        "A: But that was in hiding. And we didn\u2019t bring them to Friesland, we bought them to the\nmiddle of the country Nijkerk, that is -- I don\u2019t know if you have a map --",

        "A: And there, see our country, the south [indecipherable] 1s mostly Catholics, and they did it,\ntoo, and north of [indecipherable] are mostly the Protestant. And -- so -- and Hein knew\nall those people, and they were all from -- I didn\u2019t know they sent their children to the\nChristian schools, and so -- and they were --",
        "Q: And they didn\u2019t hesitate?",
        "A: No. They thought it was just normal, nobody -- I really -- I can still not understand why\nhere in America, I feel sometimes very uncomfortable because I tell here my story, and\nyou all think it\u2019s terrific. And Pll tell you, I wouldn\u2019t dare to tell my story in the\nNetherlands, they would shrug their shoulders and say so what, you did it\n[indecipherable]. No, honest, I thought everybody I met at that time was in the resistance,\nso I thought the whole Netherlands was in the resistance. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But that\u2019s not true.",
        "A: No, because this high government guy later told me, he says that in the first place, that\nour denomination was the most. And then he asked me, \u201cWho do you think is the second\ngroup?\u201d And I thought, well we have the same [indecipherable] maybe you know the\nCommunists. And that\u2019s true, you have to be on fire for what you believe --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and they were. So that is really interesting. You know, we didn\u2019t think it was so\nspecial, you know? It was just what you had to do.",
        "Q: But you knew it was dangerous. And certainly the farmers had to know it was dangerous,\nbe --",
        "A: Now, they -- you know, in the beginning, we didn\u2019t know how far -- who the Gestapo\nwas.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, you did not realize how -- but then you found out also, that they had officially black\nuniforms, and they were men and women, and all ages, and most of them didn\u2019t wear the\nblack uniform, they were dressed like you and I. So you had to really watch out what you\nsay, to whom, because I could say to -- well, for instance, the -- for the first time executed\n18 guys. Now we were shocked, shocked. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve read that poem of -- oh,\nthat is so beautiful, the 18 -- that was a -- a -- a poet who was shot the next morning. I can\nnever read it without starting to cry. But when that happened, you know, we were so\nshocked, and then we realized you had to watch out if you said to another girl, isn\u2019t that\nhorrible from the 18 guys, and she was a Nazi [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: -- you didn\u2019t know the person real good [indecipherable] terrible things like that.",
        "Q: Did you have to worry about some of your friends?",
        "A: Well, me?",
        "Q: Or people you thought you were f -- who -- who you thought were friends? That must\nhave --",
        "A: I found that out because this -- there were two girls that we always went jumping over the\nditches, they were from my church, and they were -- one was my age, one was a year\nyounger, and their brother was a year younger again, Daniel, and we were all -- and then\nmy brother was friends with Daniel, and we were as a whole group together. And we\nwent together to catechism, went to church, and to everything. And it was the habit after\nchurch that the parents -- my parents had friends, and they came one Sunday to our house\nfor coffee, and then the other Sunday there. But those friends and I we s -- we played\npiano quartre main, four hands, and so one Sunday it was in their house, and we had fun,\nand until dinnertime, and the next Sunday in our house. And when I -- I think I told you\nthat there -- there was nothing for the soldiers, that they had invited the pulpits and so\ncome to our house, so we had Dutch soldiers. And they were like brother and sister, and I\nsaid, \u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d And they said no, we have five kids, it\u2019s too busy, we\ndon\u2019t do it. And the first Sunday after the war it was in our house, and the second Sunday\nI went to their house, and I couldn\u2019t believe it. You had to go up the stairs, and then over\nthe piano was a big portrait of Hitler. And you had those doors that were gliders, that\nopened -- they had double doors, and I heard in the other room German speaking, and I\nlook, and I see German soldiers. So then I knew that they were all Nazi. And I had right\naway, after the war, I\u2019m always a fanatic, I bought a little flag, and like now you see over\n[indecipherable] after 11/7, that I put it on my [indecipherable]. And I was so shattered\nwhen I saw that, and I said to them, \u201cAs long as this hangs in this house, I can\u2019t set a foot\nhere.\u201d And I turned around and I went downstairs to get my bag. And I think Daniel had\ntold me, the flag of my reich, so he didn\u2019t even feel Dutch any more. And I heard later\nthat Daniel fought at the [indecipherable], so he was not just in name, and both the girls\nwent to Germany and served there with [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: [indecipherable] m-mice, very [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Now, were they in the Malakka Club?",
        "A: They were also in that group, yeah.",
        "Q: In -- in that club, at first [indecipherable]",
        "A: We had such a fun -- I couldn\u2019t be -- I wrote a letter to them, I\u2019ve never mailed it, I wrote\nit in my diary, but I was shattered, absolutely shattered. I couldn\u2019t believe it. But see, then\nlater I realized when we met those Nazis [indecipherable] at the border, they were\n[indecipherable]. And my brother later said, \u201cDiet, you guys never s -- talked politics, but\nI was in dan -- Daniel\u2019s room, and he had a lot of stuff from Germany [indecipherable]\u201d\u2019.\nSo my brother was not surprised.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I never knew, never talked about it. And we had [indecipherable], and many pastors\nwho spoke out on the pulpit, and priests, too, were arrested.",
        "Q: Right. Now, the Dutch government opened Westerbork as a refugee camp because there\nwere so many refugees coming in.",
        "A: The Nazi Dutch.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes. And this was when? In 1939, in 1940?",
        "A: No, it was after the war.",
        "Q: It was after the war.",
        "A: Because before it was really a camp for -- see, there was such an unemployment, and\npeople got their money, but they wanted them to do something. And so they had several\nwork camps, that the guy who got money from the government could do something\nuseful, let\u2019s say in a very watery place, they were really filling with earth that 1t could be\nused for growing stuff or something, you have so many more -- more s -- more\n[indecipherable] or something. And so the -- 1t was originally a work camp for the -- for\nthe --",
        "Q: For refugees?",
        "A: -- people who were getting welfare.",
        "Q: But --",
        "A: And then they had leave, and they could go home. Then they are rebuilding\n[indecipherable], and only that [indecipherable] or many more of those worked, and\n[indecipherable] and whatever.",
        "Q: And so when does it become a place where they send Jews, after the war?",
        "A: Where they sent the Jews?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I think that might have been the end of \u201940, when then they started telling them to go to\nGermany, and they didn\u2019t go. And that was also th -- because the Jews from The Hague\nhad to report to a big station in The Hague, and they went in [indecipherable] but then,\nlike me with Herman, and so there were a bunch who didn\u2019t go, and others in the area\nwhere that camp was, I think they were told to go there. And then twice a week\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: And what -- did Herman say what he was afraid of? Why wouldn\u2019t he go to Westerbork?\nDid he have a sense that something terrible was going to happen?",
        "A: Yeah, th-that the German Jews committed suicide [indecipherable] that told us a lot. And\nwe had over the years heard about the Kristallnacht, so we knew that Hitler -- it was not\njust any more words, before we thought it\u2019s a big mouth, and words, but now they were\ndoing.",
        "Q: But you still don\u2019t know that they\u2019re killing Jews?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No idea?",
        "A: I really think I found that out after the war.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So no rumors even coming through?",
        "A: We heard that there were -- no, that it was very bad, and that many people died, but we\nthought of hunger, and of dysentery, and of sicknesses. But that they were systematically\nkilled --",
        "Q: You had no idea.",
        "A: But I read a lot of books, and I think this is [indecipherable] Mila 18, that they think that\npeople escaped [indecipherable], and I just got a few weeks ago, and I was shattered, and\nthat was from a man, a real man, maybe you -- oh, what was his name, Kurt something,\nand he was [indecipherable] Christian in Germany, and he hated it, and he had to be a mi\n-- of the party, a member of the party to get a job, and he spoke out, and he was kicked of\nthe party. And he got more and more [indecipherable] of the evil of the Nazi system. And\nyet, how can I actually do something?

        "A: Oh. And you ne -- he even got to the Pope, and the Pope didn\u2019t do a thing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I think they got messages to England, to America, and nobody believed them. I can\u2019t\nbe -- oh.",
        "Q: Do you remember before Herman gets his letter that Jews had to wear a star. Do you\nremember seeing --",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s what -- at the same time that they weren\u2019t allowed to use the -- the trams,\nand the trains and everything any more.",
        "Q: Right. So it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s difficult for people to understand how restricted life not only\nbecame for you, but even more so for the Jews, they couldn\u2019t go to parks, they couldn\u2019t\ngo to -- be on the tram, except -- they couldn\u2019t even go on the tram at all, right?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: N-No. And they weren\u2019t allowed to go in parks, to concerts, they weren\u2019t allowed\nanywhere, except they weren\u2019t allowed t-to shop in the big stores, only their own Jewish\nstores, which of course got hardly any in supply.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No, it was really -- it was terrible. But later [indecipherable] I c -- I could identify with\nwhen they were looking for me, you know, that you couldn\u2019t go here and there, and\nwhatever, so -- I don\u2019t know. Oh, it was a terrible thing, and that really happened.",
        "Q: What are you seeing in your eyes, right now?",
        "A: Well, I can\u2019t understand really, that one human being can do [indecipherable] to another\nhuman being I mean, how hard would you have gotten inside? And then I heard that\nthose [indecipherable] Germans who -- because here you are in a country where there is\njustice, 1t mightn\u2019t always be carried out like we want to, and we\u2019ve made mistakes, but\nthe idea is a judge has to give a sentence that\u2019s according to [indecipherable], and here --\nand we can\u2019t understand it, you were totally dependent on the guy who did your hearing,\non his mood. If he had -- that morning had burned toast, he might sentence everybody to\ndeath that day. I mean, you were totally in their hands, and you had no -- there were no\nright, there was no right. It\u2019s so terrible. And that you always have to watch out what you\nsay, to whom you say it. It\u2019s against anything that\u2019s freedom. It\u2019s terrible.",
        "Q: We have to change the tape.",
        "A: Okay, you got a [indecipherable] again.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: When Herman came to you, and you and Hein talked about what to do, you had already\nstarted a group of some kind, right?",
        "A: We were --",
        "Q: Or the -- actually the HEIN group --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- although it\u2019s not have anything to do with --",
        "A: No, we were the -- I -- in the office where I worked, there was ma -- one man who was\nreally fanatic patriot, and you know, I know what he did is -- we listened to the BBC\nnews, and we took shorthand, and we typed it out and spread it, that\u2019s what we felt we\ncould do for the people who were scared and handed in their radios. And also, I know\nthat this guy always took part of the Bible, and say, read that, and it was always from the\nOld Testament, you know, punishment, people who attacked Israel. So it was kind of a --\na stimulants, you know, y -- we do God\u2019s will, because in the Old Testament was --\nanyway it was the -- we were with a group, and there was an other man, and he was\nmarried to a Jewish lady, and he never -- that was the uncle of Herman, and he was also\nstarting to be interested in helping those people.",
        "Q: Is that Ben?",
        "A: His name was Uncle Frits.",
        "Q: Uncle Frits.",
        "A: He\u2019s probably -- Ohm Frits, he\u2019s --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. That\u2019s F-r-1-t-s, yes?",
        "A: Yeah, and he was -- we -- we were discussing what can we do, but till that time, really,\nthe only thing we felt is spread the ne -- noi -- news of the BBC. But then, when they\nstarted on our Jews, n -- we knew was more important stuff to do. We still did that, but\nwhen we hid the Jews -- but then, it became difficult because an -- at the same time,\nbecause the Germans were occupying all Europe, and they had also drafted the women,\nthey might be the first. But in Germany itself were only very old people, and very young\npeople. And the war industry was going full blast, and the fields need to be worked, and\nthere were no of that age group. So then, in all the occupied countries, you might have\nheard that in Norway, and in France probably too, but was always a handsome young\nman, with beautiful white teeth, blonde hair, big, blue eyes, come to Germany, terrific\npay. And that was on the walls, and in the papers everywhere. And there was a lot of\nunemployment, but we didn\u2019t want to go to Germany. And then, at the same time, that\nwas when they started on the Jewish people, and because the people didn\u2019t go to\nGermany, because we didn\u2019t want to go to the country where -- a few will always go, for\nmoney, you know, but that\u2019s a small percentage. And then they got mad, and they said\nokay, you didn\u2019t come when we invited you, now it\u2019s forced labor. And every male\nbetween 16 and 45 had to go, except from the Catholic church, a priest, and from the\nProtestant church, the pastors, and some teachers didn\u2019t have to go, but a bunch had to\ngo, because what they did, the people didn\u2019t go, and then they surrounded, for instance, a\nhigh school. Now, there are always boys of 16 - 17. So they went in the morning happily\nto school and never came home, they were sent to Germany. And the universities were all\nin that age group, so they were surrounded, and we had many Jewish professors, they\nhave brains, and they were very beloved, and they were kicked out of their jobs, they\nweren\u2019t allowed to have their jobs any more, so their students went on strike, and all --\nthey were -- so all the students, if they were -- they surrounded the university, and they\nwere -- so then everything closed. And so only girls went to school, and the university\nwere closed, also out of protest, strike. So some of the teachers had to go to -- and then\nthey still didn\u2019t want to go, so a lot -- just think that in America, every male between 16\nand 45 has to go in hiding, and that\u2019s what happened. And they went in hiding, but a\nsmall group didn\u2019t know where to go, mostly somewhere in your circle of family or\nfriends, there is somebody where you can go and hide. But those guys couldn\u2019t come in\nthe street any more, because you didn\u2019t know if you saw a young man or a woman that\nthey were Gestapo, so they were -- they really had to go in hiding. But the thing was,\nbecause nobody went to Germany to work there, in the fields -- there was hunger in\nGermany, and they loaded in all the countries the trains full, and the food went all to\nGermany, and we had very little. So they started a ration system with coupons, I have\nsome in my -- you probably have seen them. But anyway -- but the only way you got the\ncoupons, and they lasted a month -- it was about a card this size, and it was so little, a\nGerman guy with an appetite wouldn\u2019t even have anything to eat. And it was very little,\nbut you only got it when you went to those offices. And there were Dutch people working\nbut the supervision all was kicked out, and all replaced by Germans. And you only got\nyour new card -- your new sou -- coupons if you showed your I.D. So those young men\nbetween 16 and 45 never could get coupons again. And the farmers, because you know in\n[indecipherable] they helped their own group, they did not help others, really, only the\ndental family -- the dentist family. But many, Corrie ten Boom, were hiding Jewish\npeople, and many groups were hiding, many. Catholics, and Protestants, and\nCommunists, everybody. So, but those guys -- the farmers had already -- who dared to,\nhad taken Jews, but then we had to go to villages and cities and say, will you take a\nDutch guy. And that was considered less dangerous than taking a Jewish person. But they\ntold us we can\u2019t, because we know they don\u2019t get ration cards, and my own kid is asking\nfor another slice of bread we can\u2019t give him, and a potato. We can\u2019t feed an extra mouth.\nIf you don\u2019t have ration cards, then they don\u2019t get it. And then from some other group,\nyou know, at that time -- now people travel, but at that time, if a farmer and his wife lived\nhere, and they had two sons, then they got farms close by. They all stayed close by. And\nnobody traveled, and all the mail they got might have been a bank statement, and a per --\nsomething of their church, but they didn\u2019t get any other mail. And here we also made a\nbig mistake, we put a father and mother here, and a son there, and a daughter there, and\nthey started writing each other. And that was for the mailman who delivered it, and the\nsecond letter, or the third letter, you have somebody here? And that was suspicious. And\nthen, this was big news, there was no television at that time, the radio was va -- so Farmer\nso and so gets all the time mail, so then they maybe think, do you have somebody, you\nget all the time mail, I hear from the mailman. So they got scared, and some were\narrested, farmers, and they have --",
        "Q: Some of the farmers were arrested?",
        "A: Yeah, because they had also a side -- see they -- we had such a well registered country,\nevery family in every village, in wherever you lived, had a card system in every town\nhall. And if a baby was born, the father had to go to the town hall, and say there\u2019s a new\nbaby, this name and that and that, and that went in a card system. And if somebody died,\nyou had to go, a card was taken out. If a whole family moved to another city, that -- you\nhad to report it, and the whole -- but that card system, at that time -- now they can\u2019t do it\nany more, but everything was on it. Your faith, your religion, your job, your whatever\nyou were, your age. So they had all the Jewish fing -- on their fingertips, that they knew\nexactly how many Jews we had. And of course, then they saw that they were not showing\nup in the amount they had to show up, so they got mad. And everywhere, like -- with --\nfor the labor, there were signs, if you help a Jew, you -- you will be treated as a Jew. So\nthen the farmers -- and some were betrayed because of the mail, and they got scared,\nbecause the I.D.s, the identification cards that we all had to have the end of \u201944, the\nbeginning of \u00b041, that had a big, fat, black J printed on it, too. And they had gone to the\nfarms with this thing, and then the farmers came to us, and they said, Diet -- or, I had fal -\n- the false name then, \u201cDiet, can you get us I.D.s without a J, be -- if there ever is a raid\non our farm, that we can say, we didn\u2019t know they were Jewish, we thought they were\ncity people who were hungry, came here for being -- for better food.\u201d And then the\npeople in the city said, \u201cWe will take the Dutch guys if you had ration cards.\u201d And then\nwe were in a bind, because you know, by that time, I think we had hidden about 80\nJewish people all over. And this -- the farmers were scared. We got together, we were a\nreal small group, and we knew all each other from long ago, and we were a Christian\ngroup, and we went on our knees, and we prayed to God, and we had -- Lord, we can\u2019t\njust now say good luck and find your own way. We have to go on, but now we don\u2019t\nknow what to do any more. And I remember I always was jealous of Moses, he got a\nmanna from he -- and he got water from the rock, but the heavens did not open, and we\ndid not get a whole bunch of cards. And then the only way to get it was to take it,\nbecause, you know, there was no other way out, and it was really life and death for those\npeople. So then, after praying, it became clear to us, we had to do a robbery on the\nGerman offices. Until that time, if you treated -- helped a Jew, you were treated as a Jew,\nbut if you did a robbery on the German office, that was the death penalty. And when I\nspeak for high schools, or universities, I always say when I say this, \u201cThis is not advice\nkids,\u201d I said, \u201cbut 1f you do an ar -- a robbery, you better have arms, and revolvers.\u201d And\nth-the British had, over our lakes, dumped at night, you know, big containers full of -- we\nhad weapons, the resistance, but having a weapon was the death penalty. So then it really\nbecame dangerous, and there were a few brave guys that were called the knockploegs, k-\nn-o-c-k ploeg. And they volunteered to do that, every month again. And we found always\na village, or a somewhere, where we knew somebody was working, sa -- a Dutch person\nwas good, and that we can make a dra -- a drawing, where are the guards [indecipherable]\na guard, how many, is -- how is it locked, you know, that they had to shoot it open. But\nthat -- before they went in, that they knew the whole situation. And then before --",

They were decimated, we were decimated, and then together, but we always kept\ncontact, but -- from the Zwijndrecht group, they did a lot in spying, and they got really\norder from England to blow up munitions stuff and so.",
        "Q: Right. Now, when you brought people to the farms, did you expect somehow everything\nwould be okay?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t? Because you had an enormous amount of work to do in terms of --",
        "A: Oh, I remember I had once to bring a very Orthodox Jews from The Hague to Duchorn,\nthat is a village outside Apeldoorn. I had -- the man could have been, you know, in\nchildren\u2019s Bibles, you see Father Abraham, real Jewish looking, oh he looked like that.\nWas written all over him Jew. And of -- in the first place, the stem had to -- star had to go\nout. And this man was Orthodox, and later I learned he had his Tallit, you know, his\nprayer thing 1n his pocket and he lost it, and he wanted to go back for it, oh. I had to twice\nchange trains. Miracles happened, because I had to bring him, his wife, and his 16 year\nold son first to Utrecht, there we had to switch to a train to Amersfoort. In Amersfoort we\nhad to switch to a train to Apeldoorn, and then we had to walk I don\u2019t know how many\nmiles to a -- a hotel that was in the woods, and the people had -- nobody had money any\nmore, so they were totally broke, they had nothing. So Hein and Ab went there, and they\nsaid -- they first sends them out if they were good, and they were good, you know, that\nthey were por the Netherlands, and not Nazi. And they said, well we can give you\ncustomers, and we will pay for that, and they have the ration cards and everything. And it\nwas so isolated, so we could bring a whole lot of Jewish people there, but on a Sunday. I\nwas still working in my office, I had to bring this guy. And he had a suitcase so heavy,\nthat I don\u2019t know -- have you ever read that an accident happens, and that it was in the --\nin the paper some time ago, and it has happened several times, and that one woman 1s\nunder the car, and the other woman passed, and it was life or death and she lifted the car,\nhave you ever heard of such thing?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Now, I said a prayer. I couldn\u2019t get that suitcase, I said, \u201cGod, this is all they have in this\nright world,\u201d and I could lift that suitcase, I don\u2019t know how. And then in -- then we si --\nwent from one train to the other, the guy loses his Tallit, and he wanted to go back, I said\n-- I told him beforehand, I said, \u201cListen, you sit here.\u201d Martin, his son had to sit there, and\nhis wife there, and I am there. I said, and if you are -- I gave him a newspaper, I said,\n\u201cThe whole trip, keep that in front of your face, because that is,\u201d -- and I said, \u201cif you are\narrested there is no point that [indecipherable] and I go on with your wife and son.\u201d But\nthese were horrible things. And we got there, oh, and then I went to my sister, and we had\nto walk, and we walked into the woods, oh, no, and another night they had told that if I\ncame at 11 PM at the certain station, again Amersfoort, there would be a cab, or a car,\nand two elderly people, and there was nobody. Oh, no, no, it was -- it was more a miracle\nif it went all right. It was a miracle.",
        "Q: I would imagine it was, because you have people\u2019s lives in your hands all the time. How\ndid you bring -- let\u2019s just talk about Herman for a moment. Herman gets a card to go to\nWesterbork. How many days does he have? A few days?",
        "A: He had quite awhile.",
        "Q: He did have?",
        "A: Because then he was really not ready, and he told Rosa, and I still see Rosa all the time,\nshe is a sweetheart, she\u2019s now -- she\u2019s a few years older than I am. And she says I -- just\nwhen I heard it I said, I will go. And so she was really the first one, although we had\noffered it to Herman, and she went alone to Amersfoort, and there they picked her up and\nbrought her to the farm. And she was there a long time, but then became the -- she sor --\nshe was wandering a lot, and then here, and then there, and she was really half dating a\nnon-Jewish guy, and later she was in the part in Zwijndrecht. But she said, \u201cWhen I\nclosed the door behind me, I really had no idea that I never s -- would see my parents\nagain, and how dangerous it would be.\u201d You know we -- we -- we all underestimated the\ndanger, I think, and maybe it was a good thing.",
        "Q: Maybe, because maybe you wouldn\u2019t have done it if you really knew the danger.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I don\u2019t know. I think later we were willing to [indecipherable] so that we will\nbe [indecipherable] they were looking for me under two names. And then I was arrested\non my third name, and I knew if they found out who I really was, was the end. And you\nknow, I can honestly say, and this sound crazy, I have three times I -- that I thought it\u2019s\nthe end of my life, and I was so young, and at home my wedding dress was hanging. And\nI think you get a special grace from God, you can say it\u2019s okay. And that\u2019s a way when\nit\u2019s over, because sometimes I thing now I\u2019m not as close to God as I was then, but I\nthink when it\u2019s my time, I'll get it again. You know, it\u2019s -- but I think when you really\nfeel you have to, you want to live like God wants you to live, that\u2019s -- and you just do it\nand trust. Well, it\u2019s not always easy to do the right things, that\u2019s what I tell the young\nkids when I go to schools and universities, that whole life\u2019s making choices. You every\nday will do a fork in the road, and I say pick the right road. And that might ask sacrifices.\nAnd I had to speak for the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, about two and a half\nyears ago, or three years ago, and I said to those guys, I said, \u201cIn the profession you have\nchosen, it might easily be that you have to make the highest sacrifice, your life.\u201d And I\nthink, who knows now [indecipherable] how many of those guys have already given that\nsacrifice.",
        "Q: But your belief in God during that wartime period when you started --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- was absolutely essential to you.",
        "A: I can tell you, if I had [indecipherable] Psalms, oh, David went through everything in this\nlife. And when I read those Psalms you know, I thought oh, I don\u2019t know, there is a\nPsalm 27, the lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear, and I thought, yeah,\nthat\u2019s scary. I was fee -- and then it said, when an army comes against me -- because\nDavid was fleeing for Saul, and then he wrote it, and he said, when an army comes up\nagainst me, he will put me on a rock, and he will hide me [indecipherable] and I also, I\nalways knew that\u2019s what God is doing with me, I mean really I shouldn\u2019t be sitting here,\nso many of my friends were killed, so I feel that I was spared for a purpose, and you have\nto find a purpose, and have the time all to see the purpose.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I have to try.",
        "Q: Did you read the Bible during this period, or did you know so much?",
        "A: No, you did -- not allowed to have anything, so it\u2019s good that in our church we had -- we\nwent to the Christian school, and every Monday morning we had to learn a little part of\nthe Psalms, so Monday -- Su-Sunday night, I could easily learn, so my parents didn\u2019t\nhave to bother, but later I was -- you know, we hated all that we had to do that. And\n[indecipherable], oh, what a lucky thing because it came all back to me.",
        "Q: It came back.",
        "A: You know, I -- I -- I would have gone absolutely -- I think I would have been in\n[indecipherable] in an institution if I [indecipherable]",
        "Q: If you didn\u2019t have the --",
        "A: Because later, in that concentration camp [indecipherable] it was impossible.",
        "Q: So Diet, tell me -- I don\u2019t know, th-there wasn\u2019t a normal day, but once the people, th --\nthese Jewish families are put, either singly or together, on a farm, then what is your\nresponsibility, and the responsibility of your group? What did you have to do?",
        "A: Now, we brought the mail along, because that was what they were living on, the mail\nfrom their children, we -- so, because the po --",
        "Q: So they didn\u2019t go through the normal mail system because it was too dangerous?",
        "A: No, because that was so suspicious for the mailman, and then also, the Gestapo opened if\nthey thought that somebody is suspicious, they opened the mail, so that was double. And\nI had to see that every month, even if it was at the farm, the food was scarce, and bad, so\nthey still wanted raf -- the ration cards, so after the robberies, we had to see every month,\nwith every Jewish, and if it was very poor people, we gave them two cards or so. And we\nhad to, if an address became unsafe, you had to find another place and transport them.\nAnd that one Jewish guy, who was our falsifier, in normal life he had been a draftsman,\nand he was terrific, he falsified everything, so he had a room with his wife --",
        "Q: Is this Ben?",
        "A: [indecipherable] where I later was a lot.",
        "Q: Wha -- what was his name? Was it --",
        "A: His name was Uncle Ben.",
        "Q: Ben, uh-huh.",
        "A: Uncle Ben, yeah. Kanis was their last name. And he was very good, and I was often\nthere, because this one had to have a new paper, and that one had to new paper, so we\nwere constantly busy. And at the farms, you know, that was very smart because they had\nlittle kids. And the neighbors, the doors were always open, you walk in and out. So the\nlittle kids were told to say, neighbor, we have buurman, that\u2019s the man, and buurvrouw,\nthat\u2019s the woman, you say here neighbor. But it was just so if the little kids talked about\nthe neighbors, the -- the real neighbors didn\u2019t really -- were not surprised because they\nthought, oh, they\u2019re talking about that -- you know, you had to think of everything when\nyou had little kids.",
        "Q: How often would you go to these farms?",
        "A: At least once a month, but mostly more. And because you know, for the cards, but at\nsome -- and also, I was allowed to sleep there, so even if I had nothing to do there, but I\nwas in that area, then I could always sleep in, on the bed somewhere [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Was it easier for a woman to be traveling around doing this?",
        "A: Yeah, the men could always be stopped for the forced labor. And so after the first\nrobbery, because all our men were in that age group --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- Hein was, I think, 22 probably, his brother was a year younger, 23, and Ab was in his\n30\u2019s. So they would right away have been -- so, but after the first robbery, we could give\n-- all the Jews went without a J, and Uncle Ben was working like crazy. And all our guys\ntook also new, and they were all pastors, so we --",
        "Q: They were all pastors.",
        "A: Because they didn\u2019t have to go to Germany. So then, when they were stopped in the train,\nand it happened regularly, they were pastors, so then they could go on.",
        "Q: So if there were 15 people in your group, did all 15 go around giving out these -- the\nration cards, and the I.D. papers?",
        "A: Well, I worked mainly in -- in Felmaloond, around Amersfoort and Utrecht. But in the\nsouth they had other things too, because they were really -- yeah, I know that there they\ngot orders from England, that was a secret sender that they had to blow up a munition\ndepot, or a bridge, or something. So they did also Jewish people, but they -- they spread\nit. Some they [indecipherable] and that was --",
        "Q: But that -- this was a totally different group, that wasn\u2019t your group?",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: Or sabotage.",
        "A: And when we were in the beginning, they asked us -- they asked us tha -- Hein had to go\nright away in hiding in 1940 already. And he was put in a house, and the girl was\nengaged, they said, to an Italian. And then all of a sudden another guy said that Italian 1s\npro-Nazi, that\u2019s dangerous. So then they brought Hein to another house, and that guy --\nanyway, they said that Italian was dangerous, and they asked us -- that was a Communist\ngroup, and they asked us to stab him on a dark night in the back, and kill him, and throw\nhim in a canal. And we were not convinced that you have to be -- I could do -- I couldn\u2019t\ndo it, but I could let a guy from the -- who had the guns, I could ask him, and then they\nwill do it. But I wasn\u2019t convinced that he was such a traitor. But later they asked me in\nthe German interview, if you absolutely had known that\u2019s a traitor, and he asked, \u201cCould\nyou then have?\u201d I said, not myself, but then I -- if I [indecipherable] you, he would betray\na lot of people, and had betrayed, then I could say yes [indecipherable |",
        "Q: So you could get someone else to kill him?",
        "A: Because ho-how many lives would be saved then, you know?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So. No, I -- I just wanted to -- but 1t had to be done now and then. It\u2019s terrible.",
        "Q: Were you working at the same time you were in the resistance?",
        "A: No, in \u201943, H-Hein asked me, I think the end of \u201942, he says -- in The Hague, he says, \u201cI\nhave met a guy, and he is also with a group.\u201d He said, \u201cand he has an address ra -- that is\ndesperate,\u201d and he says to me, \u201cdon\u2019t you go there.\u201d He says, \u201cbut it\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d it\nwas in the heart of The Hague, he says, \u201cand they won\u2019t even let you in that house, you\nhave to have a password.\u201d So he give me the password. So I went there with it -- the\npassword, and if you think that we had two you -- Jews on this farm, and one there, and\none there, all spread out, and I remember I had to go up the stairs, and I say the password,\nand they let me in, and that was a house, a little apartment in the middle of a big\napartment house, and it was built for one person, one living room, one bedroom, a shower\nand a bath, a kitchen -- small kitchen, and a hall, that is all. And this woman, that was in\nher 40\u2019s -- in her 50\u2019s, Mies, Mies was her name. And she had 27 Jews in that apartment.",

And I said, \u201cYou will be arrested.\u201d I said, \u201cDo you know\nyour neighbors, are they Nazis?\u201d She said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And then when I talked to her,\nI saw she had a warm heart, she had to help, but she did not use her gray matter. And she\ndidn\u2019t see the danger, and she -- her father was a Dutch guy, and her mother was from\nIndonesia.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: She\u2019s playing music, and people are dancing. Now how did -- how -- why were you sent\nto her house?",
        "A: Because Hein asked me, and Hein had met the guy who brought all the Jews there.",

        "A: And I got back the next time, and she had eight new ones, 15. And a few weeks later she\nhad again in the 20\u2019s. And I thought, this 1s desperate, and I said to her, \u201cMies, I\u2019m scared\nto come here, because if there,\u201d -- I said, \u201cyou will be arrested, there\u2019s no doubt in my\nmind.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd you know,\u201d -- when you were arrested, what the Gestapo did 1s they\ndidn\u2019t just take you away. They let you sit there, and of course you were part of a group,\nand with a revolver near your head, if the phone rang you had to take it, and just pretend\nthat there was nothing, and the next one would come, and the next one. So I knew about\nit. I said, \u201cListen, I'll give you one word, potato,\u201d or something, or sugar, something\neasy, I said, \u201cand I call you a few minutes before I come here, every time. I\u2019m scared.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cOne day the Gestapo sits here, and I walk in their open arms.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd I won\u2019t\n-- that if you answer me that you use this word,\u201d -- I can\u2019t remember what I gave her, but\nsomething very simple. I says, \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t say that word, I\u2019m not coming. That\nmeans for me the Gestapo is here.\u201d But I wasn\u2019t there, but Bram was there, and Bram was\nthat guy who had brought all the Jews there, and he was just bringing a big bag with\npotatoes and food, and he had asked Hein, he said, \u201cI know that Diet doesn\u2019t want to give\nher name to,\u201d -- Mies didn\u2019t know anything. I said, \u201cMies, I don\u2019t tell you what,\u201d -- she\nwanted to know who I was, said call me Toos. Where do you live? I said, \u201cI\u2019m not telling\nyou.\u201d I said but -- she said, \u201cBut if I need you, what can -- how can,\u201d -- I said, \u201cIll call\nyou the moment I get up in the morning. I\u2019Il call you an hour before my lunch break, and\nI could come here on my bike in my lunch break,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019Il call you two or three\nhours before curfew, and if you need me, I\u2019Il be here.\u201d I was there for weeks on end, I\ndon\u2019t know, months maybe, four or five times a week. The old Jew of -- in her eight -- in\n-- in his 80\u2019s, died. Can you imagine, how you have to bury that guy, I think it\u2019s in the\nbook. But I tol -- Hein was fortunately in The Hague, because he was often not there. He\nsaid, \u201cOh, I'll take care of it.\u201d So they wrapped him in a rug, and everybody was\nchanging, your beautiful crystal -- what do you do with crystal, you need to eat, so they\nwent to the farmers and exchanged it for grain, or whatever, and so when Hein and his\nfriend carried that rug out, the neighbors must have thought, oh he\u2019s exchan -- getting a\nrug for potatoes, or so.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they had a hand car, and they pushed it.

That man was good and he had a big -- a walled garden, and we were --\nthey were allowed to bury him in the back of that garden [indecipherable] and after the\nwar you can bury him in a Jewish cemetery, because the Jewish people like that. And I\nnever asked him, and I had such a conscience trouble when Hein never came back, I\nthought, oh, I should have asked him. And when I spoke to that Dutch guy from the\nresistance, he says, \u201cDo you have questions,\u201d because he had questions about a traitor,\nand I knew something about it. And I said, \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cthat Jewish guy,\u201d -- and he\nsaid, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he was buried in the Jewish cemetery,\u201d so that was good that I know\nthat. But then -- then she had so many, and one day Bram was there, and they were all\narrested.",
        "Q: They were all arrested?",
        "A: They were all arrested, and I made my phone call, and I had told Mies, she had -- she let\nthem use the phone, I said, \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t. You -- you\u2019re living as a lady alone in\nyour 50\u2019s, and you answer the phone.\u201d I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t -- you\u2019re too -- too dangerous.\u201d\nSo she had obeyed that, and I dialed and a man answered, and it was 11, so I thought an\nhour before my lunch time, I thought there she goes again. So I hung up, I didn\u2019t say a\nword. And then around two o\u2019clock I phoned, and a man answered. At three o\u2019clock I\nphoned, a man answered. I thought, this is not good. So I took one of my coupons, and I\nwent to a store across, a food store, and I thought, if that has happened, I knew how they\ndid it, big trucks with guys with machine guns, and helmets, and the house surrounded,\nand so on. And I thought that will be the topic of conversation there. So I took my bread\ncoupon, and I went there with money, and sure enough they were all talking about that\nthere are -- they were all arrested, and Bram, too. And then Hein and I -- I didn\u2019t dare to\nsleep at home, because I had never given Mies where I was, but I did not know that Bram\nhad been there, see? I\u2019d never met Bram. I didn\u2019t know",
        "Q: But he knew you?",
        "A: He never met me, but he had my father\u2019s phone number.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because Hein had asked, if there is an emergency, how can I reach you [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And Hein had given Bram only my phone number --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- but he had never met, and he didn\u2019t know where I lived, he only had my phone\nnumber. But he was the only one, so it must have been him. But anyway, that night I\nthought well, I don\u2019t know where I slipped up with Mi-Mies that she still found out\nwhere I was, so I didn\u2019t sleep home, and I let Hein know, and he slept somewhere else.\nAnd this went on for maybe 10 days, and nothing happened, so I moved back home. And\nthen co --",
        "Q: Was that the first time that you left the house --",
        "A: That I slept --",
        "Q: Elsewhere.",
        "A: -- | went regularly to the office, but I didn\u2019t sleep at home.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- because I thought, you know, I can\u2019t take the risk. And when weeks later, Hein\nand I had decided we would get married, and we took out our wedding license, and then\nyou have to go again to the town hall, so on my card was written took out a wedding\nlicense with Hein Sietsma, on his card, Diet Eman. And also, it was very strange, that\nwas May \u201943, May fourth, and I had a real feeling -- our love had grown so much, but\nsomething in my heart said, \u201cAnd you\u2019ll never marry him.\u201d Strange, huh? Very strange.\nAnd I thought -- I can\u2019t see that we ever would break off, but -- and I didn\u2019t dare to tell\nhim. And then, a few weeks later, we had just taken out our wedding license, and that --\nthe town hall in The Hague was a big, very [indecipherable] with marble steps, and I\nthink that by that time, I had told him. I said, \u201cWell, it must be true, but,\u201d I said, \u201cI\nalways had the feeling we would never get married.\u201d And [indecipherable] there is only\none thing, either you die, or I die. He said, \u201cDo you have that feeling?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d I\ndidn\u2019t dare to say -- I didn\u2019t know what, but 1t was somewhere -- subconscious. And\nwhen we walked down those marble step, and he had bought me a big bunch of red roses,\nand I had them in this arm, and he had my arm, and in his left hand he had the papers that\nwe will get married in September, because then you got coupons for [indecipherable] and\nfor some [indecipherable]. And I remember that he take my [indecipherable] and he said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you still now believe it?\u201d And I said, \u201cNow I believe it.\u201d And inside a voice was\nscreaming no, no [indecipherable] it was so strange, it -- it\u2019s scary. Anyway --",
        "Q: Was this before or after the bicycle trip where you heard this voice?",
        "A: It was before.",
        "Q: It was before the bicycle trip. So this happened --",
        "A: In \u00b043.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It started slowly to -- inside. Strange, huh?",
        "Q: That -- that 1t wouldn\u2019t -- it wouldn\u2019t happen.",
        "A: [ -- I -- I\u2019m really scared when I have those feelings. Some time ago, I had a terrible\nfeeling -- that same feeling, so had me like a stone, and it concerned my kids. And then --\nmy daughter doesn\u2019t ever want to upset me, and a week later I found out that she had to\nhave a biopsy, she had done a pap test, and it was not good, and she had to biopsy. And\nthat was -- that I -- it turned out that they don\u2019t really know, so she has to have another\ntest, and these doctors [indecipherable] she goes to another one. But it\u2019s very strange, and\nyou know from the book that the night that Hein died --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s horrible.",
        "Q: It\u2019s horrible. [indecipherable]",
        "A: And only with big things in my life, I have that.",
        "Q: Not small?",
        "A: No, not little things.",
        "Q: And then on a bicycle trip you heard a voice, and what did the voice say?",
        "A: Twice. The voice said, Kijk nog mar goed naar hem. Have a -- have a good look at him.\nStrange, huh?",
        "Q: Very strange.",
        "A: It\u2019s scary. It\u2019s scary. On the other hand, I think that God may be preparing me\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: It was what?",
        "A: That God maybe prepares me for something that\u2019s coming, I don\u2019t know. But anyway,\nthen we went home, and then a few weeks later, that\u2019s when Mies was arrested, and that I\ndidn\u2019t sleep home. But then, after that, when they -- my father wrote of my brother -- he\nhad false papers that he was in the food supply. He opened the door, and there were two\nGestapo guys, but he didn\u2019t know it. First they pretended that they needed me for\nsomebody who needed to go in hiding, but my brother didn\u2019t fall for that, because they\ndidn\u2019t come to your door and ask for a place. So then -- and one didn\u2019t even speak good\nDutch, he was German. And then, in the end they said, \u201cWell, where does she work, we\nneed to speak to her, and it\u2019s very urgent.\u201d And he had to [indecipherable] where I\nworked. So the moment they had left, they called me and they said that two guys, they\ncan\u2019t speak good Dutch, and they were needing to speak to me, and it must be Gestapo.\nSo I picked up my purse, and you know, I always think before you ask your boss, may I\ngo to the dentist, I\u2019ll be back in an hour. And I worked for the father of my pi -- young\ngirlfriend, who -- when we were young, and I knocked at his door, and I said, \u201cI have to\nleave, and I\u2019Ill see you after the war.\u201d So I picked up, and I never went home again. And\nthat was May, 43. So for two years, till the end of the war, because the Gestapo came all\nthe time to my parent\u2019s house, I couldn\u2019t go home any more.",
        "Q: So then what do you do? You leave your -- you -- you leave your office, where do you\ngo?",
        "A: I went straight to Hein\u2019s office, because then they knew about him, too, we had taken out\na wedding license. So then he went, and he --",
        "Q: He\u2019s working at Shell, still?",
        "A: He was working at Shell. And he went to Ab, the other leader, and I went first to some\nfriends, and then later -- my sister had just had a baby, she was married, and they never --\nthey were so busy, so she says to -- I -- I went there on my bike, and she says, \u201cOh, can\u2019t\nyou stay here four or five days, and take care of the kids?\u201d The young kids. And then my\nhusband and I can go out and have some time for ourselves. So I stayed there I think a\nweek. And then the guy where we always had the meetings, the patriot from our country -\n- from our office. I was in The Hague with another address and I saw him, and his wife\nsaid, \u201cMy sister in Eindhoven needs a maid, and she\u2019s very difficult, and she goes\nthrough maids like nothing. I can ask her if you can be there.\u201d And I\u2019d never been in that\nsetting, so I thought, hey that\u2019s totally no connection. They might still connect my sister.\nSo anyway, then she said oh yeah, she needed a maid. And she had three kids, and the\nyoungest had a -- I\u2019ve forgotten the name, here, or tosis or something. He had that he had\nto measure od -- my friend [indecipherable] from the office had a son who was mentally\nretarded. And they found out as a little kid he should have had loads and loads of fat, and\nbutter. But it was a d -- a disease that they had just discovered, and the kid of this sister\nhad that same disease. So every day on how you weigh the mail, the -- the envelopes, so\nmuch grams of grease and fat and butter he had to eat. And very little other things, so\nmuch bread. But it was all measured. So she had her hands full, and she was -- she had a\ngood sense of humor, but she was a difficult woman, and that\u2019s why she went through so\nmany maid. But that little boy\u2019s name was Rudy, and he was three years old, and he was\na sweetheart. And I had to take care of him, and it was terrible because it was so\nimportant that he got all that fat, and he never got mentally retarded if he had -- if he\nvomited, I had to scoop it up and feed it again to him. And his mother couldn\u2019t get it in,\nbut I did all crazy things with him, and then he started laughing, and he ate it. So -- but I\nwas there a long time, and she was very difficult. And I was not a maid, you know, I had\nnever -- when I left my home I didn\u2019t even know how to boil a potato. So the --",
        "Q: So were you -- were you required to cook, as well?",
        "A: Well, she did the cooking, but I had to clean and do the whole thing, so -- but I learned\nthere a lot, and later on the farms I learned so much, oh --",
        "Q: But just [indecipherable]",
        "A: I started out there --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have your real name then?",
        "A: No, then I was Dineke de Jong, that was -- but I didn\u2019t go because I knew one family\nthere whose son was also in the resistance, but I didn\u2019t -- for them, that they were in risk\nthat they had somebody in hiding, so I never went to that church or anything. But I\nremember it was a very close by, it was on the [indecipherable] in Eindhoven, and there\nwas -- at the other end of that plane is a plaza, and a park with trees, and there was a\nCatholic church. And sometimes I was so deep down in the dumps that I just -- and the\nCatholic church are always open. Oh [indecipherable]. But anyway, I was there a long\ntime, and --",
        "Q: Were you also working as -- 1n the resistance, or were you just being a maid?",
        "A: No, this was just -- I was there several months. No, I was just a maid.",

        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yeah. So I got mail from him. And I also send him mail that he gave to other guys from\nour group, and some of them were in The Hague, and not being looked for, so my parents\ngot always, every 10 or 12 days, a note in my handwriting, that they knew I was alive, but\nI did not let them know where I was.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was much better. And I did also not write neither father and mother, of course you\ndidn\u2019t.",

        "Q: Rudy?",
        "A: It was Eindhoven, yeah, and that was so often bombarded because that\u2019s where Phillips\nis, you know, and that was the war industry then --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: -- so and I had my order, I slept on the same floor as Rudy, so if Rudy -- if there was a\nbombardment, we all had to go down, then I took care of Rudy, and they had the two\nother kids. But then one time I got a letter from Hein, and it said, \u201cDiet, we haven\u2019t seen\neach other in such a long time, let\u2019s go to Amsterdam, to friends of ours, and let\u2019s meet.\u201d\nAnd it was a city just outside Duga, so he would come from Friesland, I would -- and the\ntrain would be four or five minutes that we will change trains and go to Amsterdam. And\nit was a s -- it was -- I had to meet him on Saturday, and on Sunday we would be\ntogether. And that lady, I was really the maid to her, and she says, \u201cYou can\u2019t go, because\nSunday after church I\u2019ve invited this lady, and you have to serve coffee.\u201d So I couldn\u2019t go\nfor serving coffee, that stupid hour that I couldn\u2019t see Hein. So I said, \u201cHe won\u2019t take\nthat,\u201d because I know -- I knew him, I says, \u201cHe will be furious.\u201d \u201cOh, how childish.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cNo, he counts on me, and there\u2019s no time to reach him.\u201d I couldn\u2019t reach him\nanyway, he\u2019s traveling. She said, \u201cWell, then you can go to the city,\u201d it was called\nSonnhooven, \u201cand you can tell him that you can\u2019t come in, you have to come back.\u201d\n[indecipherable].

So I take the train -- I never forget it, I came in Sonnhooven, and Hein came out of\nhis train, and there was the train to Amsterdam, and he had three or four minutes, and he\ngrabs my hand, he says dos -- I said, \u201cNo I can\u2019t go.\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cCome on, you can tell me\nlater.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t go.\u201d And I pulled back, and oh, he was furious, furious. And he\nsaid, \u201cFor that stupid coffee,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going away there,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019Il find\nanother address, you\u2019re going away.\u201d And I felt so bad because after all, they had taken\nme when I was in big trouble, and I had gotten to love Rudy, and then Hein says to me,\n\u201cDiet, we need you really full time, it\u2019s getting more and more busy.\u201d So I went back to\nEindhoven, and she said, \u201cAnd what?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, like I told you, he was furious, and I\nhave to leave here.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d And they couldn\u2019t believe it, and then they were trying to --\nI said, \u201cNo, they say that they need me.\u201d And that was very hard, and I left, and I\u2019ve\nnever seen Rudy again, none of them.

        "Q: You were --",
        "A: On the spot, you were killed",

That was a give-away\nthat there were allies, so I thought, I can\u2019t stay here, and I told them. And then Hein\nfound another place on this farm, with co -- with Lozeman.

So I se -- but I could go for my work, but I\nsaid, \u201cYou tell me, I can arrange it myself, which date you really need me.\u201d And you got\nso little soap, so every three weeks you did a laundry, and at that time the people changed\nonly once a week their underwear.

So then I always was there on Monday.\nAnd then the farmer woke me up at quarter to five. And they had a well and a pump on\nthat deel. The deel is the connection to the farm where in winter all the stables are and the\ncows are, and the horse has a stable.

And you had to get\n-- keep it wet, so I started in those months, I started always quarter to five, and then when\nthey had breakfast at 7:30, they called me for breakfast, and they called me at 10, or\nquarter after for a cup of coffee, and they called me for lunch. And then in the evening I\nwas maybe -- especially in the months that I had to keep that stuff white, maybe at 5:30.\nIt was all by hand, you know.",
        "Q: Wow",
        "A: So I learned it, and that saved my life later in the camp, that I -- all my false paper was in\nthere, and that they let me do the laundry.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: If that happened right after that they came [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right. We\u2019re gonna stop the tape now, and take a break.",
        "A: Good. That 1 --\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: Okay Diet, I wanted to stop the flow of the interview for a moment because you brought\nsome artifacts. Can you hold this and explain what this is and show us what this 1s?",
        "A: Now, there was curfew, and every city in the Netherlands was what they called\nverduisderd, everywhere curtains. And every street had a su -- supervisor who lived there,\nand by the Germans he was told, every night you have to walk around -- they were\nallowed even after curfew, to see if any light would shine out. So everybody had dark\ncurtains. But if you had to go somewhere in winter, and on nights that was no moon or\nsnow, you would bump in people, you didn\u2019t see them, you didn\u2019t hear them. So\neverybody had this, and it was a dynamo, and that they called it knijpkat. Your -- ca --\nthis is knijp, you press. And then you saw everywhere a little -- this was very little, so\nthen you had light where you stepped, if you would step in a hole, you could break your\nankle. But it was funny when you walked, or funny -- 1t was not so funny, but your -- you\ndidn\u2019t see people, but you heard everywhere in the dark the -- this noise, and then you\nknow it. So I always kept it, it was kind of funny.",
        "Q: So almost everyone --",
        "A: Everybody had --",
        "Q: -- in the nether -- had one, because you couldn\u2019t go --",
        "A: -- one, yeah, because if you went out -- 1n winter it was dark at five, so even at seven or\neight if you went out. 11 o\u2019clo -- 11 was curfew.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But you had to have this, because that was the only way -- you know, and now the streets\nare so even, but then you could easily fall, and there were holes, and nothing was\nrepaired, so you could easily break an ankle, or fall terribly. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: How does that work?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: How does that work? Is it --",
        "A: Well, it is a dynamo, because the bikes had that, too. They had that on their front thing,\nand the line -- so you produce your own, it -- it\u2019s a dynamo, I don\u2019t know. Dynamo you\nsay, I think.",
        "Q: Dynamo. It\u2019s fabulous.",
        "A: Yeah. But the bulb might be gone, or that there\u2019s still some --",
        "Q: No, it comes out just a tiny bit.",
        "A: Some light comes out?",
        "Q: If you do it -- if you do it hard enough, you can see it.",
        "A: Well, the bulb might be out.",
        "Q: And then there\u2019s something else that you stole. Explain -- explain [indecipherable]",
        "A: And I feel good about it.",
        "Q: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "A: They entered, in the beginning of the war, our houses. They just -- the doorbell ring, they\npushed you to the side, marched in, took everything of copper, brass, metal, and they just\nmelt it for their bullets. So in our house [indecipherable] we were warned, so we had\neverything -- we had beautiful brass stuff from Indonesia, engraved, so you put it -- there\nwas no plastic yet, that you put it in now. Now, rubber sheeting, what the hospitals had to\ncover the bed, and that went all in the gardens under the ground. So there it was, so they\ndidn\u2019t catch much. But I was in the train, and I was seeing this were the ashtrays that\nwere welded in the trains, here you see that. So I figured that are about six bullets, and\nthey\u2019ll probably one of these days take that off, so I thought Ill be ahead of you. I had to\nmake a very long train trip, and they crammed us 1n a few wagons, and then they had\nloads of wagons where one German soldier was sitting and a big sign, forbidden for\nothers, only for the German army. But when I was standing there so long, and I got more\nand more mad. So I was standing pushed against one of those, and I don\u2019t know how I\ndid that, probably my fury, but in the end I pulled it off.",
        "Q: So you pulled this off?",
        "A: I pulled it off, I wrung it off, I don\u2019t -- so I saved six bullets.",
        "Q: And where did you keep this, so that you could get it after the war? Do you rememb --\nyou -- do you --",
        "A: No. I mean, this was -- they wouldn\u2019t search your house for this, even if they had come\nand they found [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So do you think you brought it back to your parents house?",
        "A: If it happened when I was still home, yes, and otherwise where I was hiding.",
        "Q: Otherwise it was someplace else.",
        "A: But this was not dangerous stuff, if you had stolen documents or some, but this -- I think\nthat they never have put two and two together, that somebody in their fury had bothered\nsix bullets.",
        "Q: But you must have felt good just to do that, yeah?",
        "A: Oh, very good.",
        "Q: Very good. Do you know other people who were doing similar kinds of things? These\nlittle --",
        "A: No, I know that if a Gestapo guy, or a German soldier came, you watched in the s --\nwalked in the street, and he was coming that, then you crossed the street, like that they\nwere poison or something. And I know people who spit on this -- on the thing. They --",
        "Q: Spit on the ground?",
        "A: When they saw a German soldier. And I know that one time a soldier came and asked me\nto go to Scheveningen, and there was a big battalion, and I knew it was there, but I didn\u2019t\nwant to help them, so I said, oh yeah, there, and I sent him 90 to 180 degrees the other\nway. [indecipherable]. Anything that you could do against them, we did. Terrible, hey?",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s a great story. Now, things start to get very rough, personally, in 1944.\nYou\u2019re in a bike trip with Hein with -- when you hear this voice, after you\u2019ve had this\npremonition that\u2019s he\u2019s going to be arrested. And it\u2019s o-only a few days later, after the\nbike trip, that he does get --",
        "Q: It was April 23, \u201944. And they were a whole year looking for us. And Hein wrote me a\nletter, and he said, be Saturday night at that and that farm, and I then I think I told you\nthis morning that went to church together, and then we had dinner at that leader -- the\nother leader, there were two, and he was a farmer, so they got up in the morning and they\nwanted to take a nap. And then Hein said, We -- we going on a bike ride, and it was\nbeautiful spring weather, and all the fruit trees had their pink blossoms. And we were\nalone on that, and Hein pulled his Bible out, and he read from John 14, and that is in my\nFather\u2019s house, I have many mansions, and I don\u2019t know, I still remember that. And then\nhe told me everything about the work, because I knew only my little part, and I didn\u2019t\nwant to know more, because I thought, if you are arrested, and they start torturing you,\nyou can\u2019t say I'll keep my mouth shut, you can\u2019t say that. And I -- but he said -- I said,\n\u201cHein, don\u2019t tell me, I don\u2019t want to know what the others do.\u201d He said, \u201cSomebody has\nto know the whole thing,\u201d he said, \u201cfor in case that Ab or I,\u201d -- and I listened to him, and\nthen he brought me that evening to the farm of\nAlie, and we were alone on that country road, and there was nothing, only those beautiful trees\nthat are in the distance. And I heard clearly a voice, and I s -- can\u2019t explain it. And that\nvoice said in Dutch to me, Kijk nog mar goed naar hem. That\u2019s in English, have a good\nlook at him. And I thought this is ridiculous, that 1s a thought that comes in my head, but\nI heard it again, twice. And then I started looking at him, and he was far over six feet, so I\n[indecipherable] and I looked up, and he started laughing. He said, \u201cWhat are you staring\nat me?\u201d And I didn\u2019t dare to tell him, and I said, \u201cNothing.\u201d And he brought me to the\nfarm, and that was the last time I saw him. And three days later he was in Friesland, and\nhe was inspected in the train like many people, but men especially. And they saw that he\nwas a pastor, so he was safe. But then they searched him, and they found a lot of stuff\nwhat he had there. So he was put in a prison. But we felt -- and I -- you saw those\ncoupons, and those I.D.s, those identification cards. And when we stole them, if that was\nfound in a large quantity, you got shot. I mean, that was the end of your life. So we felt,\nall the farmers, and the people who gave us a bed, were already ru-running a risk. It could\nbe that three in the night there\u2019s the doorbell, and they look for us. So we always had to\nfind a way out, in the back door or through a window, but you know where we would go.\nBut we did not want to bring all this danger stuff in those homes, because it could be that\nI could get out, but that the papers stayed there, and that the people would be shot. So we\nhad rented a P.O. box somewhere, and Hein smuggled a note out, because we wrote each\nother, and then we gave the letters to others, and keep them till after the war. But the last\nletter we always kept, it was kind of, you know, close to our heart.",
        "Q: You mean, you -- you -- you kept the last one before you got the next one?",
        "A: Yeah, before the next. And so he had my fath -- last letter, with my false name. And they\nfound that, and they started looking for me.",
        "Q: And which false name was that?",
        "A: That was Dineke de Jong.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And they were looking for me, so he smuggled a note out, and it reached us, also by a\nmiracle of God, because that was so much work, he couldn\u2019t send it straight, and he had\nto trust a guard, it was a Dutch guy. And the underground hated the Dutch people,\nespecially the police who stayed and worked for the Germans. And sometimes by the --\nby the Communists they were killed. Those adulterators, they helped the Germans. But\nthis guy had stayed to help. And for some reason or another, that Hein smuggled that note\nout via this guy, and 1 -- it came via, via, via, through lots of searching, and underground\ndid that -- man delivered it to the underground, and they found Ab, the other leader. And\nthen it said, \u201cEmpty the P.O. box, and don\u2019t use it any more,\u201d because he had a key, and\nhe would be afraid that he will be tortured, and if the other kept on sending, that would be\nheavy for him, with his hearing. And he said, \u201cAnd let Diet take another name, they know\nnow her false name.\u201d So then they were looking twice for me, my real name, and this\nname. So it was getting -- the net was getting closer. And then he said, And let her warn\nall the guys, and then bring the documents from the -- from the thing to The Hague, and\nhe mentioned a nickname that we called this guy. And so I knew what he meant. So I got\nmy other pe -- identification card again, and then the man asked me what name do you\nwant to have now, because he had made so many. So I says, \u201cWell, the name of our\nqueen, Wilhemina,\u201d and then I just heard the name Laarman -- Laarman. And then he\nsaid, \u201c\u201cWhere do you want to be born?\u201d And there was no time to put one in that town hall\nanywhere, and then you had to smudge it. I says well, make it Surinam, Paramibo is the\ncapital, and that\u2019s Dutch territory, and they can\u2019t check that, there was no mail there, they\nwere free. So -- and then he said, \u201cWhat job?\u201d And that was a problem, because I\ncouldn\u2019t say secretary, because if they said where do you work, there was no Willie\nLaarman, I couldn\u2019t say nurse, I couldn\u2019t say teacher. So I said maid. And there was an\nelderly couple in there, had said, \u201c\u201cWe would love to help, but we don\u2019t know how, we are\nso old.\u201d So I went to them, I said, \u201cNow you can help. If I am arrested, you vouch that I\nam your maid.\u201d And they said okay. So I was the maid Willie Laarman. And then I had\nall that stuff from the -- from the thing on my -- in an envelope in my blouse, and I had\nwarned all the guys, and I had lunch with one of them, in Zwijndrecht, and then I had to\ngo to The Hague, and that was a short trip, only one stop in Rotterdam, and they -- this\nwas in May \u00b044, they had -- were a whole year looking for me already, and the Gestapo\nstill coming to our house, so they had never given up. And then it turned out -- and that\nwas so terrible, because normally if they thought you help Jews they came four or five\ntimes, and then they thought -- there were so many, then they gave up, but they never\ngave up. And we had a spy in the headquarters of the Gestapo that was -- and he worked\nfor us, and he looked in our files, and he found out that Mies had kept a diary, and they\nhad found that diary, and in it said Toos brought 27 ration cards. Toos brought 27 I.D.s.\nToos -- and Hein had been there also, but not so often because he was in other parts. And\nhe had given the name Dick. Dick did this, Dick -- so they were looking for Toos and\nDick that they knew were doing the robberies, or part of the robberies. And that Jewish\ndeal wasn\u2019t even important for them, they wanted that, that\u2019s why they never gave up for\ntwo years. So we knew that they knew everything about us. But they didn\u2019t know who\nToos was. And then I found out that that Bram had been there, and Bram had been, not\ntoo long before that married, and his bride was crying his ide -- her eyes out. And later I\nheard that she paid the Gestapo 5000 guilders. And they told him, you go to Germany,\nand your bride is crying at home. And then, I have no proof, but he was the only one who\nknew who the phone number was, so he gave the phone number to the Gestapo, and he\nwas freed soon after that. But I\u2019ve never seen him, and I -- I don\u2019t know, the guy started\nout good, that he wanted to help Jews, so I didn\u2019t want to make a big fuss out of that. And\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the book, he\u2019s now -- I heard that he died. I checked later out, and I\ndidn\u2019t want to go there, because I thought if he knows what that mentioning of that\nphone, for -- had for results, he would live this terrible remorse or something, so I\u2019ve\nnever made any. But he was the only one who knew my phone number.",
        "Q: Diet, let me ask you a question. If the Gestapo went to your parent\u2019s house, did they say,\ngive us pi -- a photograph?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t. They never asked for it. So they had no idea what you actually looked like?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, unless that there was anything in the town hall. But they had no idea, so\nthat is a lucky. But I had changed my hairdo, and I did different color glasses, you know,\nframes, so when they were after me, I always, for the new I.D. --",
        "Q: Looked different.",
        "A: I looked a bit different.",
        "Q: Cause that just struck me, that if they came to your house --",
        "A: No, no, I was thinking, now, in this time, from DNA, and from every -- I wouldn\u2019t have a\nchance.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t have a chance, not a chance.",
        "Q: Well, only if they found you, and could check.",
        "A: No, but I think they would much easier find me.",
        "Q: Find you. Maybe so.",
        "A: And with the TV, and with all the -- you know, that they ask for in this guy, and the 10\nmost wanted, and whatever. No, I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a miracle.",
        "Q: Right. So, you\u2019re under the name Willie.",
        "A: Willie Laarman. And then I said in the train -- and there was so little fuel, before they\nwent every how -- hour, and now they went a few times a day. And the train was nearly\nempty, so I knew I would have to wait a long time, so I had a book, and I had a window\nseat, and I start reading. And I still remember the title of the book, Toen De Herten\nRiepen, \u201cWhen the deer called out.\u201d And anyway --",
        "Q: When the deer called?",
        "A: When -- yeah, th-that -- in the woods, you know. Anyway, I was reading that, and then\nslowly the train filled, and after maybe an hour and a quarter, it start slowly going, and I\nlook out of the window, and I felt my heart stop. Six gest -- the trains had those steps\nthen, you know, and six guys stepped on that, opened the doors, Gestapo. Four in\nuniform, and two in civil, but they had the insignia that I knew that was German Nazi.\nAnd then -- several of my group had been arrested, and one got out by pretending he was\na black marketeer. Then they gave you a sentence, but everybody wants to make a buck,\nand that was not so serious resistance, and he had gotten out. And he had told us, if you\never are arrested, don\u2019t show how scared you are, don\u2019t show it, they get their kicks out\nof the [indecipherable]. So how -- don\u2019t -- he gave us that advice. So I thought, I\u2019Il stay\nquiet, stay quiet, and then I thought the headquarters of the Gestapo is in The Hague, and\nthis train is going there, maybe they just have to report, I don\u2019t get nervous. And then\nthey split out, six wagons, six guys, and they started inspecting everybody\u2019s I.D. And I\nhad a real one from the last robbery, but still, you know, and all this stuff here, and they\nwere a year long coming to my parent\u2019s house. I was scared stiff. Oh, I was so scared.\nAnd -- but I wasn\u2019t allowed to show it. So -- but the interesting thing was he started, and\nhe takes an I.D., and he looks and gives it back. And it went so fast, and then he came to\nme. And my heart was pounding.",
        "Q: Yeah, I was wondering, is that --",
        "A: Oh, it was -- I thought he must hear it. It was pounding, and I didn\u2019t dare to look at him,\nbecause you know, I didn\u2019t know if I was blushing, or that I was very pale. I -- it was so\nterrible, so I looked like in my book that it was very interesting, but I couldn\u2019t see a word,\neverything was dancing. And I gave him my I.D., and everybody got it back night away,\nand I didn\u2019t got it back. And then he said in German to me, \u201cWann haben sie das\nbekommen?\u201d When did you get it? And I wasn\u2019t going to speak German, but I knew what\nhe said. I said -- and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t speak der -\n- ger -- German, can you speak Dutch?\u201d And he went on and on, and he was screaming,\nand I heard what he was saying, and he want to know when I had gotten this. And then an\nother traveler [indecipherable] speak, he says, \u201cHe wants to know the date you got it.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cOh, that\u2019s on it.\u201d And -- but you know, and the other five hadn\u2019t found anything,\nand they all came in this compartment, and they gave one look at my I.D., and they burst\nout laughing. And after the war -- I never knew till after I got out what had gone. They\nhad printed -- and you saw the copy, in deep purple, and it had all the data, and a\nbackground like money that you can\u2019t falsify, but one of the little things was nationality\nDutch. And that was printed in deep purple. But everybody 14 and over had to go and get\nthat I.D., so in the beginning we had I think about nine million inhabitants, and a lot --\nmillions over 14, so they had handed out millions. And after that -- that was in the end\n\u2019A40 -- beginning of \u201941, they handed out to everybody who turned 14, then you had to go.\nAnd in *43, they ran -- ran out, they had no more. And they printed exactly the same,\neverything, except those to -- two little words nationality Dutch, instead of deep purple,\nin black. And if you don\u2019t know it, you could barely see it. And I had one of the last\nrobbery, and it was a black one, so that was printed in \u201943, but the guy who made the\nfalse papers, wrote automatically I think \u201942 or something. If he had done a duplicate that\nI'd lost it \u00b043, I would have been okay. But on that I was arrested, and later that man from\nthe government, he said, \u201cOh, you had a black -- you had a black nationality.\u201d He said so\nmany were arrested. So then the underground started to check and found that. So after\nthat they did those all duplicate, and later date, but I was one of the victims.",
        "Q: Did -- did the underground figure it out, what happened?",
        "A: Yeah, after --",
        "Q: Yeah, they figured it out.",
        "A: The -- there were so many arrested, relatively, you know. So they knew there was\nsomething, and then they went over that. It was really -- I always think it was nearly like\na chess game. You do this, we do that, you do this. And here they had a smart\n[indecipherable]. So --",
        "Q: So they look at this, they\u2019re laughing, and now what do they do, do they search you?",
        "A: And then the train stops in Rotterdam.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And it\u2019s a big station, one of the biggest in the Netherlands, and they said out, and they\nhad a little office there, and they looked through my little [indecipherable] and I had\nsome data, but I had made my own shorthand that nobody else could read, and this -- oh,\nthis is spy material. I said no, and then they wanted to know -- they said, \u201cWell, if you\ndon\u2019t talk,\u201d and I s -- I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying, I d -- I don\u2019t understand\nGerman.\u201d They said, \u201cOkay, you go to the headquarters.\u201d And that is where they did this\nstuff, so I was really scared. Back to the station, and it was a chilly day, it was May\neighth, \u00b044, and it was drizzle -- like now, drizzle and rain. And we have many benches\non this -- on the station and everywhere, but nobody was sitting, because it was so chilly,\nso they were all walking. And it was crowded, because there were so many -- so few\ntrains, and many people. And they said to me, \u201cSit here.\u201d And then the leader of the\ngroup, he had a higher rank, he was standing here, kind of facing the other five, and the\nother five were in a horseshoe, five facing me. And I thought this is the end of my life,\nbecause now I go to prison, and I knew you had to undress, and then when my blouse, I\nhad buttons, you know, I thought, when they find that [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You had all the papers --",
        "A: I had all the papers from the robbery there.",
        "Q: In your bra.",
        "A: I had it in my bra, and it was stolen I.D.s, and there were two pilots who wanted to get to\nEngland, and they were in that age group, so we had to give them also the papers. And\nthere was a way to get back to England via Belgium, France, over the Pyrenees to\nPortugal, and then a submarine would pick them up. And we have helped sa -- several,\nand when they were in England they gave secret code that we knew they were there. But -\n- and for those guys, if they were stopped, they couldn\u2019t speak Dutch. And so they had\nthe Dutch papers, and if you had like the -- where the Jew was the J, if you had a big scar,\nor at that time you still had people with what they call that -- those red -- now they can\nwith ice get that off when you\u2019re a new baby, but at that time it was called a veinflak. It\u2019s\na big thing that -- a scar of thing, and everything special. So on that -- for those guys we\nalways wrote deaf and dumb. And we said, \u201cIf you are arrested, don\u2019t say a word, and\nyou don\u2019t hear.\u201d",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So -- but we got many back to England. And then -- but you know, I was brought in, I\nwas sitting there, and I was praying there was [indecipherable] for those, and there were\n500 guilders because by -- it was towards the end, and many Jewish people didn\u2019t have\nmoney any more. And in the cities we had to pay the people something that they could\nbuy the food, you know, and the Jewish people were so eager also, collecting money\nfrom people who didn\u2019t dare to do dangerous things, but were willing to contribute, so it\nwas a busy time. And then they --I -- I was praying to God, I thought, oh, this is the end\nof my life, when I go to prison I have to undress, and they find that, and Pll be shot\n[indecipherable]. And I thought of my wedding dress hanging at home, and the -- all the\nexpectations we had. And I was praying to God, and pleading. I said, \u201cWe are helping\nyour people, and then,\u201d -- and I says, \u201cYou are Almighty,\u201d and I was really pleading with\nGod, I said, \u201cYou are Almighty, can you give a moment that all people don\u2019t look at me,\nand that I can get rid of that envelope.\u201d Then I\u2019m still in a bind, they are looking\n[indecipherable] then I had a chance, but here I have no chance. And then I always say,\nhumanly speaking, when five people are watching you, what are your chance that all five\ndon\u2019t look? You can say zero. If it was one he could be looking another way, if there are\ntwo, they could be looking. But five? And I always say it says in the Bible with God, and\nwith God all things are possible. And the guy who was standing here, he had a raincoat of\nstuff we had never seen. And at that time the fashion was that all the raincoats were made\nof gabardine, and only pockets here in the side. Nobody ever had -- and inside pockets\nhad never -- in no coat, you had not have it happen. And he had a shiny coat, it was a\nmilitary coat, battleship gray. And one of the Germans, I heard him say, \u201cIs that that new\nmaterial? Is it really waterproof?\u201d It was the first plastic, plastic had just been found out.\nAnd then another, I heard all what they said, said, oh, and how nice, it had two big\nstitched on pockets. Those pockets, that is handy, that had never -- and this tall guy said,\nhe said, \u201cYou think that is handy?\u201d He said, \u201cThis coat has pockets on the inside.\u201d Now,\nthey had never -- and they all said, \u201cOn the inside?\u201d He said yeah, and he opens his coat,\nright, and he was over six feet, and all the five heads went in the raincoat to admire.",
        "Q: So how did you get out the --",
        "A: I had opened my blouse --",
        "Q: Already?",
        "A: I -- I needed -- yeah, when I started praying, I\u2019d opened the blouse.",
        "Q: So you were ready.",
        "A: And I had only to grab it and throw it.",
        "Q: And where did you throw it?",
        "A: Well, there were loads of people walking, hundreds were walking up and down, this\ncould be anybody\u2019s. So then they would have had to arrest the whole station. And\nwhoever found this was lucky, he had the ration cards, he had 500 guilders --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and the rest he can have thrown away, but --",
        "Q: But these guys didn\u2019t find this? They didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No, because they didn\u2019t know I had it on me, of course, so they didn\u2019t even look. And\nthen I wanted to get away from it, so I said -- and one guy could speak a bit Dutch, I said,\n\u201cTam so chilly.\u201d And I was. I said, \u201cCan we stand in that tunnel?\u201d Because there were\ntunnels that go to the next platform, and I heard him say to the other, \u201cLet me alone with\nher, [Il get it out.\u201d I thought, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what you think.\u201d But I didn\u2019t know any of\nwhat he said. So we stand in the tunnel, and you -- when you are so long in that work,\nyou get really a look at people, that you -- and I saw he was very vain, and so I started the\nconversation, and he could speak some Dutch. I said, \u201cNow, when you go through those\ntrains, what are you looking for?\u201d Like I was [indecipherable]. He said, \u201cOh, for spies.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cFor spies?\u201d I said, \u201cAnd -- and who -- how do you find them?\u201d And he start -- he\nsaid, \u201cYeah, two days ago we had a guy, and he had all secret films, and,\u201d -- I said,\n\u201cWhat did you do? Shoot him?\u201d He said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cHe tried to run away.\u201d I said,\n\u201cAnd what did you [indecipherable] shoot him?\u201d He said, \u201cNo.\u201d I said, \u201cI can run hard.\nMay I run away\u201d\u201d I said to him, \u201cDo I get a head start?\u201d So I was joking, like I wasn\u2019t\nnervous at all. And I talked the whole time, and then the train pulled up, and he had this\nbig head, and he had [indecipherable] didn\u2019t have a word [indecipherable]. And then I\nheard him again say to the others, \u201cLeave me alone with her in the apartment, I -- in the\ncompartment, I get it out.\u2019 And I went on in the train. But then -- oh, I ran from one fear\nand another, I -- later when I looked back, I thought, oh God, I should have cracked up.\nBecause the train ended, and there -- then we had to take a tram to Scheveningen, and\nthat was line eight, and it was around five o\u2019clock, and that tram went exactly past the\nbank where I had worked, and the people left at five. And I thought, oh God, if any of\nthem -- and it\u2019s raining, hops on, say hi Diet, I\u2019m sunk.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I -- from one fear and another. And I wanted also to know the people, and because they\nhad -- the uniformed people left, and the two in civil, with the insignias on -- and I was\nsuch [indecipherable], and they left me. So we sit in the tram, and then you had a conduct\n-- conductor who collected the money. So he came to me, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m not paying.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cYou have to.\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cThen I throw you off the tram.\u201d I said,\n\u201cPlease,\u201d because I sit he -- I said, \u201cI\u2019m sitting here very much against my will.\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cWhat?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, those two guys,\u201d \u201cthey have put me here.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, those two guys,\u201d and they had -- said, \u201cthey have put me here.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cOh, la -- you\u2019re fur [indecipherable] you got -- you\u2019re arrested?\u201d I said yes. So\nthe whole tram knew that they were two Germans, and that they were arresting me, and I\nthought, if the tram gets in a jam, they probably help me that I can shoot out of it\n[indecipherable] to -- to the prison -- off to the headquarters of the Gestapo. And there I\nhad to sit for hours, because you had those special cars that they arrest people, and they\nhave a special name, betsies, or something, I don\u2019t know what. But anyway, there was not\none, they were out to collect Jews, and whatever, they had to sit there for hours.",
        "Q: We\u2019re gonna -- we\u2019re gonna have to change the tape.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: Okay. Diet, so you\u2019re waiting in the prison, and how come they\u2019re making you wait, do\nyou think? Do you know?",
        "A: In that -- they -- in that building of the Gestapo, the headquarters, I had to wait because\nthey were -- they had big, black yar -- cars that they brought you to prison and arrested\nyou apart from if they had the whole group, they did it on trucks with machine guns. But\nthey were wal -- waiting for [indecipherable] because they were doing raids in The\nHague, and arresting people, probably Jewish people. So I had to wait a couple of hours,\nand then they brought me to the prison. And it was the same arrogant guy who was in the\ntrain. And he could speak Dutch, and I remember that in that car he says to me, \u201cYeah,\nnow I can\u2019t help you, you\u2019re a young girl, and I feel so sorry that you go to prison now,\nbut you didn\u2019t tell any, now you have to go to prison,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you still tell me\nhow you got this paper,\u201d he says, \u201cthen you get very special pr -- treatment in -- in the\nprison. You get -- may choose every day what you want to eat, and you get every time\nwith your meal a glass of wine.\u201d And I thought, how stupid does he think I am? I -- I\nknew definitely that wasn\u2019t true. I mean, how stupid? So I just played along, and I said,\n\u201cYeah, real -- really?\u201d And you know, in Dutch? And he says yes. I said, \u201cMay I even\nchoose appelmoes?\u201d Was applesauce, and that\u2019s -- it\u2019s such a stupid word, appelmoes,\nand I thought that he would then realize. He said, \u201cOh yeah, you may choose appelmoes.\u201d\nWell, I said, \u201cI -- I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- I have this paper, and I don\u2019t know.\u201d So anyway,\nthen we came to the -- the prison, where Milosevic is now, that\u2019s a big prison for\ncriminals. But it had a big, high wall, and it had a small side door, and it\u2019s round, and it\u2019s\nstill there. And -- and there was a bell that you can press, and they stood there, and they\nhad told me, don\u2019t show that you\u2019re ascared, you know, and we were standing there, and\nhe said, \u201cYou can still tell me, I haven\u2019t yet pressed, you can still tell me.\u201d And then I\ntook his thumb, and I pressed it. And he gave me a whack. But then I was brought in, and\nhe disappeared, and I had to stand for a long time in a corridor, and on one side are all\ncells. And I had to face the wall, and stood there for a long time, and out of the cells I\nheard all voices, and they said, \u201cWhat is the news from the outside world, what is the\nnews from the outside world?\u201d But I didn\u2019t know if these were Gestapo guys who wanted\nto check, so I -- I feel always guilty, because if they were real prisoners, I thought I\nshould have told, but I didn\u2019t want to take the chance. And then they brought me, it had\nmany corridors, A, B, C, D, and I was in corridor A, in cell six, some that -- the\nhandkerchief, I think it was six or eight. And they put me in, and it was three meter, now\nthat\u2019s a little bit longer than three yards, and two meter, right? And it had -- I didn\u2019t know\nthat -- a drum in the corner, and only one cot, and it was meant for one person, so small.\nAnd very high window with bars. And I was number five, there were four others. And\nthere was an old Jewish lady, Mrs. Spire, and she had the cot, and we slept on stone, on\nthe floor. It -- it was a prison for criminals, so I didn\u2019t know what are the other women,\nyou know, they could be criminals, they could be [indecipherable] they could be\nanything, but the Jewish lady I knew was okay. And I had been the whole day in the he\ntrain, telling all the guys, and I had been sitting at that station, and then 1n the\nheadquarters of the Gestapo, and then I had to go so urgent bathroom, so I said to those\nladies, how -- \u201cWhat do you do? I have to go bathroom?\u201d And I thought that they say,\nwell you have to go -- knock at the door and then they bring you to a toilet. And they\nturned around, and they pointed at this little drum. And I -- you know -- that this was the\ntime now you go camping, and women shower together, and there is no -- but this was\n1944, and everything was so proper. And I thought, I\u2019m not going on a thing with those\nwomen that I\u2019ve never seen. But you know, I couldn\u2019t hold it until after the war, so at one\npoint my pride went out of the window, and I had to go on the tippultum, and that\u2019s what\nit was called. Oh goody.",
        "Q: So, had they questioned you at the Gestapo headquarters or not?",
        "A: They asked me all questions, but I couldn\u2019t speak German, so --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t ge --",
        "Q: So are -- are you beginning to play someone very dumb?",
        "A: I started then, because first you know, I was kind of that I didn\u2019t answer, I was -- and that\nI pushed, I thought it was kind of -- when you\u2019re going to -- but then I thought, hey, I\nhave to do dumb. And then I never spoke German already, but then I really pretended,\nand when they ask me I shrug my shoulders. And I think later that saved me. I think that\nthey let me out that they had -- they didn\u2019t have trains any more because the queen has\nspoken from England, and said that all the people who worked for the railroad had to go\nin hiding, too. So all the Jews were in hiding orway, all the men between 16 and 45, and\nnow all the railroad, and the queen said, and their families have to go in hiding, too,\nbecause in \u201944, the end -- they were so mean, if they came to arrest a man and he wasn\u2019t\nhome, they took his wife, the children, the baby. If you were pregnant they took you. And\nthen the man came back and was shot, so it was a crazy world, and there were not enough\ntrains any more. So -- but we were brought there.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re in a cell with four other women?",
        "A: I\u2019m in a cell with those other four women. And then I was so lucky, because the Jewish\nlady was brought out, and every Tuesday, and every Thursday night my heart broke\nbecause then they had rounded up the Jews, put them in the prison, and then they\nseparated the men and the women, and the children. Oh. And then you heard them,\n[indecipherable] mama -- mama. It was terrible, terrible. And then --",
        "Q: What were they doing every Tuesday and Thursday, were -- they were sending the Jews\nout to Westerbork?",
        "A: Then they -- all the people that they had arrested were brought to Westerbork.",
        "Q: And then they were deported from Westerbork, right? So who were these other three\nwomen with you, do you know?",
        "A: Now, the Jewish lady was taken out",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then an other young woman came in. But see, this was 1n the dunes, in The Hague.\nThat prison is right on the edge of the dunes, and in the dunes, that was sperrgebiet, it\nwas forbidden territory. And they have made many bunkers [indecipherable] to England,\nand there was also the place of execution, and that was known Waalsdorp. And I\u2019Il spell\nthat later with Elizabeth. But that was the place of execution, and they had already\nexecuted so many people, but you couldn\u2019t get there. And then --",
        "Q: Did you hear it?",
        "A: No, it was farther in the dunes, no --",
        "Q: You couldn\u2019t hear it, so -- I see.",
        "A: -- it was farther in the dunes, but we knew it, that was the place of execution. But it was\nright on the border of the koshda dunes, and then the osh -- the North Sea. And at the -- in\nthe morning we got that rusty cup, we had to stick that out, and they poured 1n a -- in the\ndoor was a little thing that they could open, and then you had to come, and the -- often it\nwas bohoi -- boiling hot brown water, 1t wasn\u2019t coffee, they poured over your hands, that\nyou burned, but it was all you get, and at lunchtime -- anyway, there was nothing except\nthat -- but that young girl came in, she was I think 22 or 23, about my age. And when the\nallies flew over, because they dropped bombs sometimes, if they knew that they were\nbuilding something [indecipherable] and that has to be, I mean, but it is scary if you\u2019re\nsitting in the cell and you hear bombs falling close by. But we knew that we would never\nget in -- gotten free without sacrifices, and if it was us, so be it. But we always, when we\nheard our friends in the sky, that were our hope, you know, and then everybody went,\nbecause there was a cell left, and right, and in the back. And then you went to the hole,\nand you started knocking, and knocking, and knocking. And they did it, and with a whole\nbunch, but the whole prison was nearly trembling like it was our friends are in the sky,\none day we will all be free. And this happened when she was there, but this girl comes in,\nI can\u2019t remember her name.",
        "Q: Is it Sonia?",
        "A: No, that was not Sonia, no that was another one. She wanted to, with her beauty to -- to\n[indecipherable] she was Jewish. [inaudible]. Anyway, this girl comes in, and --",
        "Q: Barzilai is her last name?",
        "A: Barzilai, yeah, Sonia Barzilai, I felt so sorry for her.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. But -- so this is another woman?",
        "A: Yeah, this was a young girl, and she comes in, and here we are -- she was the fifth one,\nand she comes up to me when we had introduced ourself, and she says to me, \u201cYou\nknow, I know that Pll be out very soon. Do you have a message for the outside world?\u201d\nAnd I thought, \u201cThat is crazy, why doesn\u2019t she ask the others also?\u201d",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so that was already fishy. And all the time she came to me, and I thought -- and I\nsaid, \u201cListen,\u201d I said, \u201cyou both -- you all know, when you are here, you never know that\nyou\u2019re out in a few days, it\u2019s impossible. You don\u2019t know how long.\u201d And then in the end\nshe said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m engaged to a German, but he is a good German.\u201d I thought that for\nme there are no good Germans at the moment. I thought -- and she said, \u201cNo, but he -- I\nknow he gets me out.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I have no family here, and I\u2019m just a maid and\nthe people where I am, they don\u2019t really care for me, they only care now that the laundry\nisn\u2019t being done.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd I -- now I have no -- nobody who is interested in me.\u201d So I\ndidn\u2019t bite. But then the next night, the allies flew over and dropped a bomb real close by,\nSO we run to our walls. And she ran to the front door where the guards were, and she\n[indecipherable], \u201clet me out, let me out [indecipherable] allies, and let me out, you know\nI don\u2019t belong here.\u201d So she was planted. And I see everywhere God\u2019s hand, because this\nwas at the very beginning of my -- of my prison time, so I knew don\u2019t trust anybody. It\u2019s\nthe lesson I got.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t remember her name?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Don\u2019t remember her name. And then I -- she was there so short, just two or three days.\nAnd then we were brought -- the invasion came, and then they got very nervous, and we\nwere all loaded in -- 1n trains, and in -- in -- really in trucks. And see, Corrie and Betsie\nten Boom, you\u2019ve heard that name, of course, too. But they came from another city,\nHaarlem, and I never heard of them, we didn\u2019t know what they were doing. But we were\nfrom The Hague, a lot of us --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and we were driven in the dunes. And when you came out of the prison, you came on\nthe long lane that was called the van Alke madelaan, and the city, and the railroad\nstations were to the right. And to the left was only the dunes and the place of execution.\nAnd they drove us to the left, so the Dutch -- the Hague people thought we are going to\nbe executed, and I thought so, too. So you had to prepare yourself for being shot. And I\nknow that several -- there were so many, there were 1800 I heard later. So we were in\nloads of trucks. And some of The Hague people were so scared they jumped out, and\nthere were soldiers sitting with machine gun -- with mi -- mitarios machine guns, I think\nyou called it. There was no point, a-and I don\u2019t know, we have dunes in Michigan the\nGreat Bear dunes, you can\u2019t run in dunes, it\u2019s sand, and it goes up, there was no way, it\nwasn\u2019t practical, so we went there. But then later my father told me -- he was born in\n1883, that when there were no cars yet, and there were a couple of very expensive hotels,\none was the Oranje Hotel, the Orange Hotel, and development people came to the big\nstation, and for those people, there were no cars yet, and they -- they didn\u2019t have any\nsuitcases, especially not this [indecipherable], they had big trunks for [indecipherable].\nSo they had made a side branch with a little train that came to flu -- near the hotels. But\nover the decades, that was totally covered with sand, and some of the Nazi Dutch people\nmust have known that, so ha -- they had unearthed that station, and they were afraid to\nship us from in The Hague itself, they thought -- and -- they did it in Amsterdam, and\nthere was a big riot, and a fight, that the underground wanted to liberate the people from\nthere. So they avoided that, and they brought us there in the dunes, so we were not shot,\nwe were loaded in trains. Crammed in trains, and I was in the same compartment with\nCorrie and Betsie ten Boom, so that was the first time, and you know that story, of\ncourse, maybe you\u2019ve read, \u201cThe Hiding Place,\u201d and some other --",
        "Q: I did, but summarize it a little bit. They --",
        "A: -- of the [indecipherable]. And they were in their 50\u2019s, so I thought at that time they were\nold ladies. And they were each in a cell because they thought that Corrie had tee --\ntuberculosis. And their old father, he was a very wonderful Christian, and he was a very\ndistinguished gentleman, very well known in Haarlem, they had an exclusive watch story\n-- s-S-store, and when all the Jews had to wear a star, he went too. He said, \u201cThey are my\npeople, and I am a Christian,\u201d and he wore the star. But they were arrested\n[indecipherable]. So -- and their old father had just died in that prison, so they met each\nother, and Corrie and Betsie met each other then, on that trip. They were sitting hand in\nhand and crying, and then I heard their story from the other prisoners. And then the train\nwas also black, when -- you know, curtains, that not a light shown, and we didn\u2019t know\nwhere we were going. But the noise changed, we went -- so I knew, I thought if we got in\nGermany, the chances for survival would pfft. And if we stay in the Netherlands, and in\nthe south you had a -- a Vught, and in the middle you had Amersfoort, Camp Amersfoort.\nSo we didn\u2019t know where we were going, it was dark and all the curtains were down, it\nwas night. And then all of a sudden, the whole noise changed, and it was so -- and then I\nknew we were going south, that we were going -- because -- you saw on the map the\ncities of Zwiyndrecht and Doordrect, but there is a big, big river, and that\u2019s called at\nHollands Diep, and that is so big, and there is a large bridge over it, and we were going\nover that bridge, and I had done that many times on my bike. And then I knew that we\nwere going to Vught. And at one point there was a toilet, and everybody stood in line to\ngo to the toilet. And when it was quiet, that there was nobody, I see a girl go in, and I see\nthat she -- there was a window, and that was also -- but I saw that she took the black\ncurtain up, and there was glass, and you could open that, and I thought that she had\nopened it, but there were soldiers with machine guns on the roof of the train, and I\nthought she knows this area, and I thought she\u2019s trying to escape. But if somebody goes\nin -- so I stood at the door like I would be the next one. I thought Pll give her a chance.\nAnd then at one point, we went through a wooded area, very curvy so the train had to go\nslow. And I saw her jump. So then she jumped out of that window, and she rolled -- I\ndon\u2019t know, we went further, but the train went slow, so I said a prayer that she would\nmake it safe. And then I went to the bathroom, I didn\u2019t have to go, but I had given her the\nchance. So I went back, and we came in the camp, and then they counted, all -- eight\nprisoners had escaped on that trip, so --",
        "Q: Eight?",
        "A: Eight. So I knew one of them, I hope that she survived. But I felt really great. And then\nwe were brought in that -- was in the night, I think we arrived at two o\u2019clock in the\nwoods. We had to get out. There were all soldiers with helmets, and bayonets and\nscreaming --",
        "Q: Did they do something because they knew that there were eight escapees? Were they --",
        "A: Well, this was when we -- they count us inside, we weren\u2019t yet in the camp. But you\nknow, the train with prisoners came, so then there are soldiers, and we were 80\n[indecipherable] prisoners, so they were [indecipherable] warned that we would be\npunished. They didn\u2019t have [indecipherable] for us. What was unexpected was the day of\nthe invasion.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then --",
        "Q: Did they care that there were eight people who escaped? They didn\u2019t care?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, they were furious, they -- all the time we had role call, or something, and\ncounting --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know if they ever found out who, because it was a chaos with the invasion,\nyou know, the -- and then we were -- and there were big Dobermans, and we were pushed\ninto the camp, and then we were in di --",
        "Q: There were Dobermans? Dogs?",
        "A: Doberman dogs, and soldiers, so they -- I mean, you didn\u2019t get a chance to escape, they\nwere [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- and guys had bayonets and guns, and whatever. And later we went in a barrack number\nfour, and that was really a camp within a camp, because see now, if you had three or four\nof one case, they kept you in different cells that you couldn\u2019t agree you\u2019ll say this or that.\nBut now we were just mashed together, and they [indecipherable] guards, and we weren\u2019t\nallowed to say one word to each other. And then we were all brought to a separate\nbarrack, the women number 75, and the men were brought somewhere else. And for days\nwe couldn\u2019t speak to each other. Day and night that we were not allowed to say a word to\neach other, till they had quick interrogated the keepall -- the people from the same cases.\nAnd then after a couple of weeks, I think, then they stayed the whole day with us, the\nfemale guards, and on the four corners were four S.S.\u2019s, and the S.S.\u2019s were the volunteer\nHitler elitengrup, and they -- they had their awesome -- you know, the swastika is from\nthe Nazis, but the S.S. had the wolfs angel, they had that sign like that. And they -- on\neach corner were always S.S.\u2019s in every barrack, four. And this was May, June, July,\nAugust. And I remember it was very hot, and we have nothing there. We got cots, and\nvery thin mattresses, and three high in long rows, of course, like in all the barracks. And\nthen the only thing we had -- there was a washroom -- washroom, and that had drofs and\na pipe, and faucets. But that was all, we had no soap, no shampoo, no towels, no toilet\npaper, no nothing. And I was arrested in my clothes, so if I wanted to wash any of my\nunderwear, then I must [indecipherable] it out till it had dried [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So there was -- there was no uniform, you could just wear clothes?",
        "A: Not yet, later --",
        "Q: Later there was.",
        "A: -- later I got a prison dress, but --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- [had no clean underwear, or anything, I was arrested with what I had worn. So that\nwas very hard. And then, because they checked us, and the other girl had to make the\ntwine, and I was picked out there, \u201cOh, you\u2019re a maid, you have to do the laundry,\u201d of\nthose guards, and from a whole bunch of guards, and I got two other girls to help me, but\nI was the maid, so I have to be the leader. And on the -- on their shirts they had that wolfs\nangel embroidered, and I hated that more than the swastika. And this women -- the\nguards, they had to take turns, and there we stood, three, and it was all [indecipherable]\nstuff, because there were no laundry machines. So then -- sometimes they got so bored,\nyou know, to sit there and see those three girls the whole day, and they locked us up and\nthey went away for a beer, or a coffee, or whatever. And when they were gone -- and\ndon\u2019t forget, I was in my early 20\u2019s then, and then we took that sh-shirt and undershirt,\nwith that hated swastika on -- no, the -- the wolfs angel, and we got a nice big gob of\nsaliva, bull\u2019s-eye. And this -- but every day when we were alone, and every day we went\na little bit back, and we got so good in aiming. It was really -- and later, you know, Corrie\nten Boom asked me later to be with her, and help her to arrange a home for the Jewish\npeople who now had nobody, she had a home for. Cases that didn\u2019t go to sanitortum\n[indecipherable]. So she had that, and I helped her those six weeks. And she had a friend\nwho was a psychiatrist, and he wanted to talk to her. At that time, if you went to a\npsychiatrist, they thought you were nuts, you know, that was -- so no, we didn\u2019t want it,\ndidn\u2019t need it. But he was so interested, so in the end we said okay, and then I asked him,\nI said, \u201cYou must think that we were crazy, that we got such a kick out of spitting on that\n-- on that horrible thing that we hated while our lives were at stake.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cthey tried to break your spirit, and they couldn\u2019t, so that was a good thing.\u201d\nBecause if we had been naughty, we had to stand there, appel had -- now that is horrible -\n- it -- 1t doesn\u2019t sound horrible, but you had to stand, marble, you know, with your thing\nhere at the side, and you weren\u2019t allowed to move. And you know, after seven minutes\nyou start swaying, and they fainted left and the right, and then all those guards were\nsitting there and laughing. And we put a smile on our face when they made us do that.\nLike we got those delicious cookies, like they had given us something nice and we stood\nthere, and we fainted left and right, and they got mad at us. And I remember that they\nsaid, \u201cDie Hollandische weiber sind schlimmer wie die Polakken.\u201d The Dutch -- and then\nweiber is a degrading word, here weif is a normal word, but it\u2019s a degrading word, you ha\n-- the Dutch women were worse than the Polakken, than the Polish. That was\n[indecipherable] and then they yelled at [indecipherable] like they had given us a great\ncompliment, you know, like [indecipherable] you are perfect, and we stood there, and\nthey were furious, but that were all our little fun thing.",
        "Q: Why -- why was that insignia of the S.S. wor --",
        "A: The wolfs angel?",
        "Q: The wolfs ang -- wolfs angel, why was that worse to you than the swastika, do you think?",
        "A: Because the swastika was the general Nazi thing, but this was volunteers, and they were\ntrained in cruelty. They could blindly obey, and they were trained -- I read that when they\nstarted -- they are volunteers, so they signed up for this, then they got an -- a new puppy,\na -- a German Shepherd puppy, and I don\u2019t know if the training was two or three years,\nbut at the final exam, now dog is your friend, and they had just [indecipherable] to kill\ntheir dog. That -- they could do anything. And I heard [indecipherable] from another\nfriend of mine, who went through so many camps, and he was later the head editor of a\nvery high standing Dutch magazine that came, The Alsafeer, that\u2019s one of\n[indecipherable] and he went through so many camps, and if he saw a scrap of paper, he\nwrote something down, and he put it in cracks from in the wall, or whatever, and after the\nwar, he picked it all up, and he wrote a book, \u201cNacht und Nebel,\u201d [indecipherable]. I\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard about it. And they volunteered. I mean, what they did fi --\nthey said, kill this prisoner, and they were free to do it. They hung them, and then they\nwere nearly dead, they got them down that they could breathe again, they did that\nsometimes three times with the same -- now is that cruelty? I mean -- no, I hated that sign\nmore because that was volunteers who did that.",
        "Q: Now, when you\u2019re in Vught, you can\u2019t tell any of these women who you really are, so\nyou not only have to be hiding from the Germans who are going to question you, but you\nhave no -- you\u2019re totally alone.",
        "A: I was totally alone, and you know, I scraped in the wall of the prison, because they took\neverything away, but that was the time of the bobby pins, and they had not taken my\nbobby pin, and all the other women did -- to keep the date [indecipherable] so all the\nothers did one, two, three, four, five, that -- from the days that they were -- so I didn\u2019t\nhave to do that. But the very last word our Jesus said before he went back to heaven was,\nlo, Iam with you always. And I scared that in the wall, and I thought I\u2019m never alone. So\n-- and that\u2019s what I had to cling to. And I never felt alone, I knew He was always there. I\ntrusted. Yeah, that was -- but it was a very rough time and in the end, I\u2019ve got two people\nthat I\u2019ve trusted. And that was -- one was a Catholic girl, she was in about the same\nsituation, I don\u2019t know how I got to trust her. And the other was a lady, and her name was\nMrs. Verschoor. And she was in her 40\u2019s, and the suffering was engraved on her face. It\u2019s\nso intense sad, and it really struck me. And I asked others, \u201c\u201cWhat is the matter? What is\nthis hurt?\u201d And they told me she had only one daughter, Yoka, and the girl was 18,\nstudying at the university, and she had helped pilots all the time escape, and she was\narrested, you heard her name [indecipherable] Yoka Verschoor. And she was arrested,\nand she was nacht und nebel and it was that you disappear, nobody knew any more. So\nMrs. Verschoor did not. And then somebody said yeah, and they lived in Paramibo, and\nthat struck a chord because on my false papers I was born in Paramibo. And one day --\nwe were 175 women in the camp, and there was a very famous film star. Like here,\neverybody knew Judy Garland, something similar, Ennie Meunier. And she was -- and\nEnnie was there, now, why the heck is Ennie Meunier in this camp? And I asked others,\nand they said she is engaged to a German. So right away [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s the matter. So one day Ennie Meunier hears that I was born in Paramibo, and I\ndidn\u2019t know a thing about Paramibo. I knew much about Indonesia because so much of\nmy family and my brother, so many had been there. But I didn\u2019t know a thing about\nParamibo. And she come, \u201cHi Willie, I hear you were born in Paramibo.\u201d And I said yes.\nAnd she said, \u201cWhere did you live?\u201d A street -- I had no idea about a street name, but we\nall had diarrhea, and then you could run away. I said, \u201cOh, I'll talk to you later.\u201d And I\nran away to the bathroom, and then afterward I avoided her like the plague, because I\nknew -- oh no, she says to me, \u201cWe were on [indecipherable], I mean, we were there, did\nyou see me,\u201d in a big play. I said, \u201cNo, my father was just on leave, he hated it so much\nto miss that.\u201d Because in a small Dutch community, that\u2019s a big thing. And she said,\n\u201cOh.\u201d And then she asked me where I lived, and I thought oh no, so I ran away and\npretended I had diarrhea. And then oh, she comes back, and what do I say, and if she\u2019s\nengaged to a German -- who is engaged to a German during this time? So I was really\nscared. And then I had heard that Mrs. Verschoor had lived there, and we all had diarrhea\nbouts, and then you were allowed -- they were allowed to leave their paper stuff, and I\nhad to go. So I saw that Mrs. Verschoor ran to the bathroom, and there were 10 on a row,\nand we had to go in groups, and were watched by a female guard. Anyway, Mrs.\nVerschoor runs, so I run, and I sat next to her, and --",
        "Q: Hold that. We\u2019re going to stop the tape, and we\u2019ll start --",
        "A: [indecipherable] back?",
        "Q: Yes, we\u2019re going to stop, and start at the next tape.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "Q: Diet, we left off when you went into the latrine to --",
        "A: Oh yeah, and then I asked this lady, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me any questions, but tell me\nanything about Paramibo.\u201d And I said, \u201cA street, where do people live, regular people.\u201d\nShe says, \u201cHeerenstraat,\u201d and she told me all about it. So that was -- and then after the\nwar I went to her house. She got out and her daughter got out. And, well -- so I know\nthat. But that helped me, and when Ennie Meunier then came, I knew something.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t afraid when she came any more?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t like it, but at least I had answers, you know. But I -- anybody who had\nanything to do with Germans, I stayed really away, and the -- like you say, I was very\nlonely there, because I couldn\u2019t trust anybody I didn\u2019t know. But there was one girl, and\nshe was go -- when we were called out for hearings, we were scared stiff because that\nwas life or death again, you know. And it all depended on the mood of the guy who\ninterrogated you. And we knew it was in a little building, and there was one girl, and she\nwas called out twice a week at least, and mostly around two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and\nI told you -- this May, June, July, August, beautiful day, summer, and she was never\nnervous when she went. And she stayed awake for hours, she came mostly back around\nfive. And she had a couple of tan shades darker. So I thought, you are not in that little\nbuilding of the hearings. I thought, you are a spy, you are planted here. Because I knew\nthey had done that in prison, but from her I knew it. So I was afraid for the spies,\n[indecipherable] but her, I had already pinned down. And another thing happened, and\nthat was kind of funny. One time a big filling fell out of my tooth. And you stick all your\ntongue in that when there is a hole. And what do you do? So one night one of the girls\nwakes up screaming, screaming. And so we went to the guys at the corners, because we\ndidn\u2019t know they had -- by that time we were there so long they locked us in, and there\nwas four guys, and the windows were all open because we -- I think we stunk, because\nwe had -- never had soap or shampoo. But anyway, those guys, we were warned, and then\nthey [indecipherable] there came an ambulance, and they took her away. And I thought,\n\u2018What happens now to her when she is,\u201d -- I thought [indecipherable] kill her, or what\nAnd they said, \u201cNo, there is a hospital here.\u201d And that\u2019s all prisoners, the doctors, the\nnurses, [indecipherable] everybody is a prisoner except the leaders are Germans. And I\nsaid, \u201cIs there also a dentist?\u201d They said, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s also a dentist.\u201d And by that time\nwe had all had our prison dresses, and if you had had a hearing it was navy blue, gray,\nnavy blue, gray, and it had pockets. And if you had had your hearing, then you were\nclassified, and you got a triangle, and you probably know about that, but when you were\na political prisoner you got a red triangle. If you were a murderer you had a green\ntriangle, if you were gay you had a pink triangle, and I think the Jehovah Witnesses had\nsilver, gray, or something. But that was after your hearing. And Corrie and Betsie had\nalready been called out. And so I heard that there was a dentist, and I asked permission --\na boring life, you know, every day the same, and we were hardly ever marching, because\nwe weren\u2019t allowed to go outside. And so then I said, \u201cCould I go to the dentist?\u201d And\nwith eight other prisoners, we were brought by a soldier with a machine gun to the\ndentist. So we walked through that camp, and it was in a little building that was -- I think\nnext to the hospital, but I didn\u2019t know, we came through a door. And we had eight of us\nto sit on a bench, and I saw that the dentist had a green triangle, and he was a Greek, but\nhe spoke fluent English. And he -- and he had a green triangle, so he was a murderer, but\nI thought, well, maybe he has killed a German, and then you know, for me he is a good\nmur-murderer, yeah. It\u2019s terrible that I say that, but you know, you didn\u2019t know what -- so\nanyway, it was my turn, and I -- but this city where this Camp Vught was so close to the\nPhilips factories, and all the young men had been sent to Germany, and the top guys, who\nwere necessary, they had been exemptioned to go to Germany. But they said to the\nGermans, we need Dutch people -- we need people to work here, we need laborers to do\nthe work, why don\u2019t you send some busloads of those prisoners every day? And then they\nwere fed terrific by those Dutch guys, and Philips makes radios, there was no TV yet, so\nthe Germans couldn\u2019t constantly watch, so those prisoners who worked there, they loved\nit, they got food from the Dutch, and if any of the German was gone, they put the BBC\non, so they heard all the latest news. And they told it in the camps, so that dentist knew\nall the latest news. So it was my turn, and he starts drilling, and he said, \u201cWould you like\nto know the latest news?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, please.\u201d So he told me they were marching up at\nItaly, and it was going so good for us, so there was hope, you know. And then when my\nturn was over -- he did the temporarily filling in it, so I had to sit back on that bench, and\nthe next one -- but that German had to watch us, but also the dentist and the patient, so he\nwas slowly walking up and down, and up and down. And I was sitting at the corner, and\nhere was a door. And the door started slamming. And that\u2019s such an irritating noise, so I\nclosed it [indecipherable] and a moment later it was slamming again, and I thought, that\nis not coincident, so I kept my eye on it, and when the German had gone this, and was\nwith his back to door -- the door opens a little slight, and a hand came up, so high piled\nwith bread, much nicer bread than we had outside. And was margarine on it. So I grabbed\nit, but the German could come back, so what do you do? I gave all the girls one, and was\nno time to eat, so it goes here, that\u2019s where you stuff everything. And then the German\nwalked again, and the hand came again, and we went in [indecipherable] and we went\nback to the barrack [indecipherable] down, and it was really funny. And we knew the\nnews. So the next time -- the temporary, he did that three or four times, and then he said,\n\u201cNow I have to put a real one in.\u201d And I was so sorry, I thought no news, no bread,\nbecause we shared it with those eight girls, especially w-we thought were going to die.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I was so sad, and he says to me, \u201cBut I can drill a hole in a good one,\u201d and he said,\n\u201cT won\u2019t touch a nerve.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, please.\u201d And he did several of my good ones, and I\nwas there for weeks. And you won\u2019t believe this -- so then 1n the end, I think that he was\n-- and we heard heavy artillery in the distance, and that was your general -- we didn\u2019t\nknow it was, but we knew they were our friends the liberators. And the Nazis got terrible\nnervous, and these were our friends, and they didn\u2019t want anybody of this camp ever to\nbe liberated. And then they started, every sunset my barrack was right on the edge of the\ncamp, and there was water, and they said there was electricity so you can\u2019t escape, and\nthey said there is a mine field. And then you had that fence with the towers and machine\nguns, and then there were the woods. And the machine guns were every time at sunset,\nand it was in the woods close by that we could hear it. And one day I\u2019m doing the\nlaundry, and there were two clothes -- and all clothes, and 1t was covered with blood. And\none woman from the guards -- I remember it, you were never alone, and you longed to be\nalone for a moment, and think and pray. And I had to clean the little room where the\nguards were always sitting, and there was a [indecipherable] and I was very softly\nhumming a -- a hymn that was really consoling to me, and this woman came in. And she\ncould have yelled at me, because you weren\u2019t allowed to sing. And she said to me, and\nthat\u2019s German again, I have to spell it, \u201cSie singen wie ein Heidelarche.\u201d You sing like a\nheather lark. And I was really sad, and I didn\u2019t have a beautiful voice, but I knew that she\nwas not the cruelest, you know, she had some soft. And she was just on duty, so -- and\nshe could speak a little bit Dutch, they all could. So I said to her, \u201cWhat is this, all this\nblood?\u201d And you know, I had to soak it, and blood has to go in cold water, in troughs\nwhere we had to wash ourself. And it was horrible. And she said, \u201c[indecipherable] two\nguys who have been on a motorbike, they had an accident, in the hospital, and they come\nout and need their clothes,\u201d so I washed them. Two days later, I got 12 sets of bloody\nunderwear and clothes. And that whole 12 was filled with blood, and all the 12, and I\nthought this is not just something. So I went to that spy, and they all did kind of pitiful to\nme, they thought you\u2019re a border case, you\u2019re not all [indecipherable], and they said --\nHanny Janssen was her name. I said, \u201cHanny, I have to wash all clothes, you know, that -\n- that\u2019s hard to do every day, but now it\u2019s all bloody. What would that be?\u201d I did real\nstupid. She said, \u201cOh, that are guys who are, every sunset when you hear the machine\nguys, are executed. They are traitors.\u2019 And it were our Dutch guys. And you know, they\ndragged you from one camp to another. And the next day I got 36 of those bloody\nclothes, and that trough was filled with Dutch blood. It was so horrible. And I didn\u2019t\nknow if Hein had been brought [indecipherable] Ab and I started to look always when I\nhad to wash those clothes, for names. And I was shattered, and I don\u2019t know, I -- I\ncracked up, because also we had buried weapons in my parents house, under the roses,\nunder the bushes, and I didn\u2019t know anything. I thought, if they all the time come and\nsearch, and they dig up the yard, and they find the weapons, they\u2019ve shot my parents. I\nreally -- I thought my -- I thought I was absolutely going crazy, I didn\u2019t know any more.\nAnd if I didn\u2019t have my faith, I would have -- I was -- I cracked up. I was -- the next\nmorning I couldn\u2019t get up, I was paralyzed for three days. And they sent the camp doctor,\nand he kicked the bed, he said, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\u201d But I was so weak that\nthen they don\u2019t me -- me -- they didn\u2019t make me do the laundry any more, they gave me a\nbroomstick, and I had to sweep. And then I started hating them so much, you know. We\nsay I hate this, or I thi -- old President Bush hated broccoli. And I think you don\u2019t know\nwhat hated is. With every molecule in my body, hated those Nazis for what they were\ndoing. And I was so angry with God. I thought, you are there in heaven, these are your\npeople that they\u2019re killing. They\u2019re killing my people, and you can stop this, and you\ndon\u2019t do a thing. And I was praying God\u2019s damnation on the whole bunch. I was still\npraying, but I was praying horrible prayers, only God\u2019s damnation. God [indecipherable]\nthis or that. And just then, there was one girl that I -- I said I trusted too, apart from Mrs.\nVerschoor, and her name was Freddy, and Freddy was a Catholic. And just in all this\nstuff that you heard, that was your General Patton, who was getting closer, and closer by\n-- and just in [indecipherable] of my hearing, and I had -- all those months I had trouble\nwith you may not give false witness, 1t was one of the things what was in the Bible, a\nstory of a spy, Rayhab, and she lied, and she was not punished by God, but she was\nblessed [indecipherable] Jesus. So when I thought of that, because I knew the Bible from\nthat -- I thought, oh that\u2019s God permission, so I said, oh let -- okay lord, I consider that I\nhave your permission to lie, and now give me a good story. And for months I was praying\nif they had interrogated me then, I wouldn\u2019t know what to say. But every day I\u2019d work on\nthat story when I went to bed. And I was born -- I thought, as little ballast as you can\nhave. So you have a father, no he has died. You have a mother? She has died. No brothers\nand sisters. Because if you -- three months later, I didn\u2019t know how long I would have to\nsay it, you have to tell the story exactly the same, the same dates. So it was really a matter\nof life and death. And just when this all happened, I had my story ready, but I was\nrepeating it every night, you know, because sometimes they shook you up at two in the\nnight, and you had the hearing that -- in your sleep, or half asleep you may say the wrong\nthing. And Freddy saw that I was called out for my hearing, and she knew that was life or\ndeath for everybody, except for this Hanny Janssen, and the officer from the Gestapo\ncame for the hearing, had to sign me out. And she pretended that she had diarrhea, and\nshe stormed from her twine making, past me, and while he was signing me out she\nwhispered in my ear. I\u2019m going to storm the gates of heaven for you. And you know, me\n-- I say to friends, Pll pray for you, but this was so much stronger, I don\u2019t know if you\nknow that story -- the gay guard at -- that comic, you know, you see him with a ram\ngoing. And you know something, another second miracle happened apart from the rain\ncoat. I walked out with that man, and we had to walk maybe eight minutes, or 10 minutes\nto the main building of the hearings. And because I knew the Bible, and I was bombarded\nwith God\u2019s promises. And one of them 1s, not a har -- hair of your head will be harmed\nwithout the will of your heavenly father. So they couldn\u2019t even touch a hair of my head\nwithout Him. And the second one is something that you don\u2019t need every time, but it said\nalso, do not fear be -- if you have to appear before authorities and kings, I will give you\nthe words. God promised me. And I said, okay Lord -- like Tevye on this \u201cFiddler on the\nRoof,\u201d you know, he was always talking to God, I said, \u201cI have broken many promises,\nbut this is a promise, and I hold you to your word. But you just have to give me the\nwords.\u201d And I walked in that building, and in that room, and there were a whole bunch of\nNazi -- very high Nazis sitting behind the table, S.S.\u2019s. I knew their ranks, and I saw their\nmedals. I think about seven at a green table. And I told you about the bad food we had,\none slice of bread in the morning, one in the evening, and that was [indecipherable], then\nthe line leaves. But once a month we got a package from the Red Cross, and that has a\nsandwich, and that had a little bit of toilet paper, and 1t had a square inch of pure lard.\nAnd they had put some soy sauce in, so we scrape every day a bit of that. But because of\nthat bad food, we had all gotten phlegmones, I don\u2019t know if you know what that --\npeople in the first World War in the ditches in Belgium and France had it. It started as an\nitch, and then you got hives, and then they became so big like strawberries, and you\nalways had them in your face. And your whole face was out of shape, and in the end your\nskin couldn\u2019t hold it any more, and it burst open, and green pus was dripping down. And\nwe all had that on our faces, most of us, and it was terrible. And then it was the fifth\nmonth, I\u2019ve never had shampoo, so can you imagine your hair greasy, just cold water, no\ntowels. And we looked a mess, and we have no mirrors, but you saw how the others -- so\nthere I was sitting with those seven well fed guys across from me, and 15 minutes before,\nI\u2019d wished them all death. And I looked at them, and I thought, there you sit, you seven,\nand you think that you can decide about my life. You can\u2019t even touch a hair of my head\nif God doesn\u2019t let you. And I thought you totally on the wrong side, the -- and actually,\nthe most strange thing, I could feel pity for them. They thought they had it all, and they\nhad nothing. And then they ask -- started asking me questions, but stupid really had done\nso stupid in those months, and I\u2019d never said one gerd of German, one word. So I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d So they called the translator, and he had to sit there,\nthen they asked him the questions, but I knew it already, and then me, so it gave me twice\nthe time to think. And then in the end, the leader -- he had the highest rank, and he was in\nhis 50\u2019s, and he said, \u201cI have done nothing in my life but hearings, and I have developed\na sixth sense,\u201d he says, \u201cand I can\u2019t,\u201d -- and I was so afraid that I had slipped up\nsomewhere, you know, because it was very important. But he said, \u201cI can\u2019t put a pin in\nyour story, [indecipherable],\u201d -- he said, \u201cbut my sixth sense tells me it\u2019s all baloney.\u201d\nAnd I told him, because they said I was early 20, so my father must have been in his 40\u2019s.\nAnd they said, \u201cWhat did your father there?\u201d I thought everywhere before I thought a --\ntaxes. I said, \u201cHe worked for the taxes,\u201d because that\u2019s everywhere, in every country, you\nknow. And then he said, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d I said he died, but of course he must have been\nyoung. He said, \u201c\u201cWhat did he die of?\u201d I said he was bitten by a snake. [indecipherable].\nAnd then they asked me the date, and they have the big Sinter Klass on December five,\nso my father had died on December five. And then, and your mother? She has died, too. I\n-- I felt like I was killing my own parents. And they said, \u201cWhat did she die of?\u201d I said,\n\u2018She had a very weak heart, and when Father was brought home there, she died.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d \u201c10 days later, 15\",\u201d so I thought I could remember that. So they asked all\nquestions, but then in the end they started -- and I heard every word, they started\ndiscussing my case in front of them. And they said, \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t look like a maid, she\nlooks more like a secretary, or a teacher.\u201d And then I heard another one say, \u201cWell, we\ncan check that.\u201d And I thought, how can you ever check -- I -- I had no idea what it was.\nAnd then they brought me -- see, that was the good thing, that I -- that they thought I\ndidn\u2019t know German. And then they brought me a magazine and a pad, and a pencil, and\nsaid, \u201cCopy that.\u201d And I thought -- I think your brains work 200 percent when you\u2019re -- it\nwas life or death again. And I thought, why are they with this? And then it dawned on\nme, when you were a maid, by law you had to go through sixth grade, and then you could\ngo, and mostly you were from poor families, and you were farmed out to a wealthy lady\nwhere -- or couple, that you had to have the etic -- but you don\u2019t write, you write -- and\nwe had one hour, and some schools two hours of penmanship. And if you see those\nclassrooms, the capital A, the small a, the ca -- so that is what your handwriting was\nwhen you leave. But if you\u2019re a secretary, and you take dictation, you start -- so I\nthought, that is the trap they put up for me. So I sat there, and I hold [indecipherable]\nwith my tongue sticking out like it was really unusual work. And then they brought me\nback to the barrack. And then the noise of the a-allies came sh -- all the time closer, and\nthey got more and more nervous. And then I remembered one of the women one time\nsays to me -- I was called Willie. \u201cWillie, if you can choose what day you go out of\nprison, what would you choose?\u201d And I says, \u201cIf I would choose, I want to go in the\nradiant sunshine, when the world looks so happy.\u201d I said, \u201cOn a Saturday morning, and\ntake a soak bath, and shampoo, and take care of all that stuff on my face, clean\nunderwear, clean clothes, and Sunday go to church and thank God for freedom,\u201d I said,\n\u201cwith capital letters. We always take it for granted, but it\u2019s a gift.\u201d I said, \u201cBut if it pours,\nand it\u2019s Monday morning, Ill go too.\u201d And you know, this is so miraculous, two weeks\nlater, on a radiant Saturday morning, I was called out by the Hauptmachtmeisterin, she\nwas the highest, and she was a real mean woman. And she\u2019s, \u201cWillie, you\u2019ll go to\nGermany.\u201d And the little voice here said, \u201cYou\u2019re going home.\u201d And that\u2019s when I put\nthe belt on, and I left sweaters I had with the eight girls, and I knew in my heart I was\ngoing out. And I was let out with another girl, Ansje. And Ansje didn\u2019t know it, but her\nhusband had been executed. And Ansje, when we had to stand at attention, you know,\nhad always fainted the first. And she was married for eight or nine years, and they wanted\nso much to have a baby, and in the camp she found out she was pregnant, so she fainted\nall the time. And her husband didn\u2019t know it, but he had been executed. But when she\nwas let out she didn\u2019t know she was a widow. And they let us out at the total different\ngate than where they had brought us in. And there we stood. And they had been so cruel\nwith many things. They once said to me that I could take a shower in Scheveningen, and\nthen I was there, and I hadn\u2019t had any water -- I mean, that little pail with cold water, and\nwhen I stood there, and I\u2019d undressed, and I wanted to [indecipherable] ready, I\u2019d never\n[indecipherable]. So they did all cruel things to make you happy for something, and\nthey\u2019d -- so we were afraid that the gates would open again and say, \u201cOkay, all a big\nmistake, back in.\u201d\u2019 And we wanted to get away, but we were so [indecipherable] nervous.\nAnd there was nothing. It was a lot of sand, it was very arid, and in the distance were\ntrees but you saw two wheels from a cart, and you saw some horse manure. And this was\nthe end of \u201944, and [indecipherable] our whole country does nothing any more. If you\nsaw a Store, there wouldn\u2019t be a rubber band, there wouldn\u2019t be a paper clip, there\nwouldn\u2019t be anything. And the farmers didn\u2019t get fertilizer, and this is an arid part, so\nthey collected all the manure from their pigs, their chickens, their cows, from everything,\nand it went in a pit, and then they pumped it up, and they put it in the moving cart, and\nspread it over the field, and they did that regularly. So they never scrubbed that cart wi --\nfor a few days later they filled it again. But this was the end of \u201944, so you can -- and we\nsaw -- where we were standing there, and we said, shall we go left or right, we want to\nget away from here, but we didn\u2019t want to walk miles for nothing, you know, so we --\nand then we saw a little dot. We said, \u201cLet\u2019s see what that 1s.\u201d So we started walking, and\nit was a farmer who was going to spread all that manure, and that cart was filled to the\nbrim with you know what, and stinking, and he was walking next to it because there was\na shelf or something, that -- where you could sit on behind the horse, but it was caked on\neverywhere. And he was walking next to his horse. And he\u2019s, \u201cHi girls, you just came out\nof the camp?\u201d And we said yes. And he didn\u2019t know if he should offer us a ride because\nthen we had to sit on that dried stuff. And he said, would you -- would you -- but\n[indecipherable] 1t was a Cadillac, and we said, \u201cYes, please.\u201d He said, \u201cHop on.\u201d And I\nthink that was such a glorious exit out of that prison, and the concentration camp, on the\ntop of a manure cart. And I think like [indecipherable] God in heaven was having a little\nfun, that he had [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Now, now, let me go back a little bit. What was it about this Catholic woman saying that\nshe would storm the gates of heaven for you that brought you out of your anger against\nGod? What do you think --",
        "A: I -- I really don\u2019t know it, but I think she made me think that she was praying for me, and\nthat I then thought hatred is not really good. It -- you know, I -- to be honest, I hated now\nthe German again, and I had the same problem, it took me months and months. But if you\nstart hating somebody, it eats you. Then you have to, but you need very much strength\nand prayer to overcome that because you know, and I think that she really shocked me in\nthat I thought she is praying for me, and that I then thought of all God\u2019s promises. I mean\n-- and He keeps His promises, I break them often, by not even th --",
        "Q: But you were sure, in spite of the fact that you were accusing God of not doing anything,\nbecause all these horrible things were happening, and that was true, and on the other hand\nyou believed God would protect you. Did you -- do you think --",
        "A: Well, protect -- I -- I knew -- see, after the war, there were things that -- I had a long time\na lot of trouble, because more than half of our friends were killed. And then I heard that\nthere was a session of grief, you know?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And that were so many steps, and that man who led it, he was a psychologist or whatever,\nand he said, if you miss one of those steps, you cannot be whole. And as a matter of fact,\nthen I he -- what he said, I missed the anger against God for -- for my life, because I\nthought, God didn\u2019t force us, we did it out of our own free will. So that part I can\u2019t be\nangry with God, because, you know, if we hadn\u2019t done it, this mightn\u2019t have happened.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: Now, when your -- when you left your house in the time, there were no tissues. The last\nthing your Mom always yelled when you were at the door, do you have your\nhandkerchief, because it\u2019s terrible. And when I was arrested I had my handkerchief. And\nthen when I was in Vught, somebody had the needle, and they got the idea, and I did it\ntoo then, and we could borrow and from each other clothes we took threads, so we -- you\njust pulled it out. And so here I embroidered -- and every night you could have the needle\nfor about seven minutes, and then [indecipherable] your blanket, so that you did. And\nhere I did the date that I was arrested, and then here it must have been from somebody\nstuck in Scheveningen, that was the prison. And then this was -- if you looked up -- high\nup, there was this window, and I was there in the A corridor, cell 306. And this was the\ncribbiltong, where you had to go in your bathroom. And this was quarter to six every\nmorning. And then they wanted to call Dutch, but they said, allemaal upschtaan,\neverybody gets up.

And then here, we\ngot once a month the package of the Red Cross, so I did long live the Red Cross. And\nhere we made our own camp song, Wijlaten demoedniet zakken. And at this -- we don\u2019t\nlet our courage go, we keep our heads up, even if they have us now, keep courage, Dutch\nwomen, keep courage, Dutch women. And we made our own melody, so we sang that all\nthe time.",

Keep\ncourage, even if you feel [indecipherable] and here\u2019s [speaks Dutch] that\u2019s to God, and\nhere I have a big question mark, will I get out, and if so when.

        "Q: Well, would you just hold it up for a moment like that? Yes. It\u2019s wonderful. And you\ntook that with you when you left Vught?",

        "Q: Interesting. And then I have something else that you should explain to everybody,\nbecause before you left -- explain what this is, please.",
        "A: Now, I had to do the laundry, because that\u2019s in -- but all the other women had to do\nsomething, and like I say, there was nothing any more in the Netherlands, so all those\nother women had to sit on long tables, that was also the tables where we had to eat, and\non benches, and they had a rusty cup for themself, and 1t was water in it, and they got\nlong strips of brown paper, and you know, when you go shopping, for food shopping,\nthen you get those big brown bags, that type of paper. And they got long strips, and they\nhave to dump that in the water in strips, and then wind it. And they had every day to do\n60 meters [indecipherable] little bit, I think 70 yards or so. And that was then dried, and\nwhen it was dry it was rolled in rolls, and they sold it as twine. And then I was arrested in\nthe train, and I had only the one panty on, I had no other clothes, so one time the elastic\noff my panty broke, and at that time it was -- the elastic was like through a loop, you\nknow -- now they stitch it on, but that wasn\u2019t then. So there I was, and I had no panty. So\nI said to the girls who were making that twine, \u201cCan you bring me some of that?\u201d And I\nwind it, and that\u2019s stiff and hard and I can get it through and tie it. So they did, but they\nbrought me so much. But -- and there was nothing, so that was very precious, and then I\nhad done that with my panty, and I thought what can I do with the rest? And there were\neight girls that I thought they won\u2019t get out, they won\u2019t survive. They were so sick, and\nTB, and everything. That were also the eight that we gave that bread to. And I thought,\nyou know what, I\u2019m going to their parents. I had deep down the feeling one day I will -- I\nhave those crazy fore-feelings, you know? And I had the feeling, you will get out, you\nwill get out. So I asked them where do you live? And I wrote all the eight addresses\ndown, and their names. And then I made it slightly wet, and I wound it, but I had so\nmuch, so I didn\u2019t want to have it just as one -- so then, I think without knowing it, I might\nhave done the first macram\u00e9. And I made this belt, it was in August \u201944, I would say. But\nhow do you close it? So then I did those loops, and one a bit smaller than the other one.\nAnd out of somebody\u2019s socks, we -- I pulled wool, and then -- so when I was let out, I\nhad this around my waist, and I was planning to go to all those eight parents, they lived in\ndifferent cities. But I had all the addresses in my head, so I never had to open it. So this is\nthe real thing. But you know, it\u2019s paper, and now it\u2019s getting too dry. The other day I wet\nit just a little bit, but 1t\u2019s breaking here, and I feel so bad. But really, I think 60 years later,\nit must have bleached up, but the names should still be in here. But I still know several.\nRandy Polner was one of them.",
        "Q: Did you --",
        "A: Nora Domart, \u201932 Amsterdam, and I went there. And a few years ago, I went back to see\nif her family still lived there, but they didn\u2019t. But there was another guy who did TV like\nyou do, and they were kind of interested.",
        "Q: So did you go to all of these eight?",
        "A: I went to all those parents, and I told where they were, and that we hoped that they make\nit out. But at least you know something then --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- because see, Corrie ten Boom, Corrie and Betsie were -- had the hearing, and then you\nwent to the other camp, and that was much easier. We were not allowed anything. And\nthere Corrie and Betsie [indecipherable] some months you were allowed to write, it was\ncensored, and then some mon-months you were allowed to receive mail. You could\nreceive one package a month. And you had a working day, but when it was over, you\nwere allowed outside in the camps, free to visit others, in other barracks. Now, we were\nnever -- we were now and then marched through a little street, up down, up down, that\nwas all -- and then back, because we were really the ones who hadn\u2019t had a hearing. And\nI did another terrible thing, that Hanny Janssen, the traitor, I heard from somebody --\nyeah, I have to tell this too, because it\u2019s really hilarious. I heard that she was really a\nprostitute, and she had started an affair with one of those SS\u2019s on the corner, a young,\nhandsome guy, Hans. And somebody told me, \u201cHanny climbs out of the barrack late, out\nof window, and then she\u2019s the whole night with this Hans, [indecipherable] and then\ntowards the morning she climbs back.\u201d And then -- and she was a prisoner, and we had to\nstand appel. And then they came back, and the man in charge of the appel -- you had the\nweek that you were the stubealteste, that\u2019s the outchder from the -- in time then. So one\ntime it was my turn to be stubealteste, and [indecipherable] I have a real mean streak in\nme, and I\u2019m not sorry for it. And anyway, when I heard that, I said to the girl who told\nme, I said, I know something. So then when it was my turn in the morning to tell the\nguards who locked us up and went away then by that time, they weren\u2019t day and night\nwith us any more, but the guards were there. And I locked all the windows from the\nbarrack. And Hanny wanted to climb in in the morning, and she couldn\u2019t, there was no\nwindow open. And then she had to disappear in the woods, because, you know, she\n[indecipherable] missing, but she was a prisoner. So then -- and they all thought that I\nwas so stupid, so then the guards came in and they had to say hundred sev -- 185\nprisoners, eight in bed, and so many. And then you had to say who were sick or new sick\nones. And I said -- and I did real stupid, I said, \u201cI know there should be 175 women, but I\ncan only count 174, but I\u2019m probably wrong.\u201d But they started counting, and she was\nmissing. And then it was daylight, so she couldn\u2019t come back. And then oh, there was --\nand she was missing. And then later, the rumor went Hanny Janssen had tried to escape,\nbut that wasn\u2019t true, and she had to go a month to the bunker, so we were a month\nwithout her, and she never knew who -- but then after the war, two guys from the -- from\nthe ger -- from our police came when I was studying nursing, and they came to the\nhospital where I worked, and they were from the -- the political police, you know, who\nwere checking on all traitors. And they said, \u201cYou were in Vught, did you know a girl by\nthe name of Hanny Janssen?\u201d I said yes. \u201cWhat did you think of her?\u201d I said, \u201cI think she\nwas a spy.\u201d \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause with -- she was called out all the\ntime, she was never nervous, she had a tan when she came back. She was very talkative,\nso she had had wine or beer.\u201d And I said, \u201cI had just drawn my own conclusion.\u201d And I\ntold what I had done. And then they told me it was true. But they told me that she was in\nRotterdam a prostitute for the very high Germans, and they had uniforms, and the top\nofficers went to her. And England found that out, and then they asked -- and there were a\nlot of volunteers, and like a son of a consul, or an ambassador who grew up in Germany,\nwas fluent in German, and went to school, they probably spoke the dialect. And they\nfound one guy who was willing to take a very high imitated German uniform, and they\ndropped him off over the Netherlands in the night, out of the plane, he had to jump. And\nhe had to worm his way into her circle of friends, and he did. And in the end he became\nengaged to her. But he was very broadminded, she could see her other friends, and in bed\nshe got so many secrets from -- and he asked questions, general, you know. And she\nfound it out, and that went all back to England, till one day -- 1t was such a secret that\nthey had to narrow it down and it pointed to her. But England had more on this guy, so he\ndisappeared, her fianc\u00e9 disappeared. But then the Germans were with a terrible problem,\nwas she really pro-German and a victim, what she was, or was she planted by England?\nSo they didn\u2019t know what to do with her, so they put -- I don\u2019t know if they asked me to,\nso I think that she --",
        "Q: They imprisoned her?",
        "A: Pardon me?",

        "A: The camp?",
        "Q: Yes, in this manure truck, where did you go?",
        "A: I went -- first of all to The Hague, and I went to close friends of my parents, we played\nbridge or something once a week. And I wanted to know if they were still alive. But they\nlived far away from where my parents, quite a distance. And I thought, you know, that\nmy parents -- they were so wise, because so many people in the underground were\narrested, that a friend saw them and said I\u2019ve seen so and so, and that week -- and then\nthe person was arrested. Because friends who thought it was interesting to say when they\nwere looking for you, I\u2019ve seen them. And I rang the bell there, and I thought they say,\n\u201cHi Diet, there you are, and your parents don\u2019t know.\u201d Because I had disappeared, they\nnever got those notes any more. And they s -- \u201cHi, I am here.\u201d And nothing exciting. And\nI said, \u201cHow are father and mother?\u201d They said fine. And then I said, \u201c come out of\nVught.\u201d My parents had given the story that I was -- I had my wedding license, and my --\nand I didn\u2019t know how to boil a potato, and Hein had 10 kids there in that family. My\nparents had all the time said when there is -- where is Diet, where is Diet, she -- \u201cOh, she\ndoesn\u2019t know anything about the household and she\u2019s learning it at Hein\u2019s parents that\nshe knows the household. So they did not know it. And then I told them, and they went to\nmy parent\u2019s house. And then I did the dangerous thing. We lived very close to a corner,\nbut in our street were a few Nazis. And I said, \u201cOh, I want to see my parents.\u201d You know,\nI really thought they might have been shot, so I wanted to see them. [indecipherable],\n\u201cCan you go to our parent\u2019s house, and tell them to leave the door open, and then I go on\nthe corner, and I look. If nobody is there, and I shoot in the house.\u201d And that\u2019s what\nhappened. And then Mom was so happy, because they had really thought I was dead, they\nhadn\u2019t heard. And when -- she was helping, I told you, the baker and the milkman came\nto the house always, and she was just helping the milkman, and then my father came\nhome, but she didn\u2019t want to say Diet is home, you know, because that was dangerous. So\nmy father walks in, and I had -- we had kind of a long house at that time, so I had -- when\nthe doorbell rang, I had gone to the back, because then if there was danger, I would climb\nover the wall from the rosebushes, and in an alley disappear. So I was in the back. And\nthen my father came to the back, and he sees me, and he turns around, and walks in a side\nroom. And oh, he is furious at me that I caused him so much trouble. So I followed him,\nand that was the first time in my life I saw him crying. And he was so happy. So then I\nstayed only till it was dark, and then I left, and found the underground. And then I went\nto all the guys, to Aalt and Alie, and Ab had been arrested. No, Ab at that time hadn\u2019t yet\nbeen arrested, the other leader. And I went also to my sister and her husband. So I went to\nall, and then they said we need you, so many have been a -- arrested. And then a guy, this\n[indecipherable] troop was also helping, because so many were arrested. And that -- tho -\n- they were more in, really, you know, munition things and so. And one of them, a spy\nhad to go all the time on dangerous missions. And it was -- we had -- he has false papers.\nBut it was safer if he had a woman with him, so we had false papers that I was his wife,\nand then he prin -- it tell you that we were daily laborers, and helping with farms. So I\nwent many times with him over the rivers, and through territory where you really weren\u2019t\nallowed, but that we say we have to work for that farmer, and showed our false papers,\nand so -- and then he was really in spying, so he asked. \u201cCan you work for us while you\nwalk from The Hague to Amster-Amsterdam?\u201d I saw troop movements and everything,\nand where they are building fort and quarters, and so then that\u2019s that stuff that they gave\nme for instructions, and I did that till the end of the war.",
        "Q: And who was taking care of all the Jews who were still in hiding?",
        "A: I did too, in between.",
        "Q: You did that also?",
        "A: Because he had often to go to other parts of the Netherlands, but if he needed somebody,\nI went with him, but I went full time, like [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And it was December of \u201944 that Ab was arrested?",
        "A: Ab was in December because --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- that family where they had the pilots, that had leaked out, and he got a message from\nthe good police -- there were -- there were bad police and good police, you -- your house\nwill be raided, they suspect you. So he disappeared -- he disappeared and went in hiding.\nAnd Ab was arrested, that Ab also had heard the other leader that they were going to\narrest him, because you\u2019ve got mostly warned by the good police, and he went to warn\nhim. But the guy, Dries Klooster had already disappeared and gone in hiding. And just\nwhen Ab was there to warn Dries, the police came, and he was arrested.",
        "Q: He was arrested, so both of them were arrested.",
        "A: And he never came back.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And the sad case was with Klooster, and that was another question mark to God. I mean,\nhe was hiding at the farm, in the little village, it\u2019s really a -- a settlement, was called\n[indecipherable] one, two, three. And when the allies came, and that were in this case the\nCanadians, they came from the east, after the battle of Ironham, and the whole thing, and\nthen they were marching up. And they wanted to cut off the Germans, and they marched\nup, and then they were really shelling. When they want to advance, they shell, so we said\nthree days and was shell fire in the -- I was with Aalt and Alie at that farm, and Dries was\nnot too far, maybe a few kilometers, but the shells were falling everywhere. And one\nshell hit that farm.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he was killed. And I was liberated on Hitler\u2019s birthday by the Canadians, so I got the\nbiggest present.",
        "Q: April 20\", 1945.",
        "A: April 20. And the rest of the country was later, but we were really by fighting. When I\ncame out after three day, you -- you thought day and night you heard the shells fall, and\nthat was so horrible, boom, boom, boom, and you didn\u2019t know if it would be on your\nroof, and that it would hit you. And we don\u2019t have big basements because we are such a\nwater country, if you go a bit deeper, you\u2019re in the water. So we sat there, and then after\nthree days and three nights it was quiet, and that was even spookier than when it got all\nabsolute quiet. And you know, like Noah, that we let a dove out to see, and somebody\nhad to go out, what happened. And the Jewish people couldn\u2019t go, and the farmer and his\nwife and two little babies, and she was pregnant, she couldn\u2019t go, and the -- so I felt I was\nthe one who had to go, and I came out, and on the road in the distance, I saw all tanks,\nand that were the allies, the Canadians. Oh, and it -- and I ran towards them, but then I\nthought, no, that is selfish, I have to go back to the farm, the Jews had been all the time,\nyears in that little room that they can -- and I turn around, and we have so much water, so\nthere was kind of a small river, and it had all those weeping willows. And I had heard that\nin Italy more allies died by snipers than really in battle. And when I ran back to the farm,\nI see three Germans in camouflage in the water, and there\u2019s no -- their daggers between\ntheir teeth, and their guns up, and they were walking away from the allies, under the\nweeping willows. And they saw that I had seen them, and I thought, oh my goodness,\nthey are not planning to surrender, otherwise they would have gone the other way. So I\nwent -- I went back, I thought, now I have to go to the allies, but I was afraid that they\nwould shoot me in my back. I zigzagged to tho -- to those Canadian tanks and I said,\n\u201cThere are snipers.\u201d And they turned around, and then they went there, three tanks, and\neach took one of the Germans like -- really like [indecipherable], and then I said there\nthey are. And I said that\u2019s when I won the war, I was triumphant.",
        "Q: Now tell me something, did any of the Jews that you -- your group was hiding, did any of\nthem get caught? Nobody got caught?",
        "A: From our original group, never. The group from Mies that we helped, yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: The whole group. And --",
        "Q: But not the original group of 60?",
        "A: No, they all got through. Miracle.",
        "Q: Really a miracle.",
        "A: But if we knew that a thing was getting unsafe, we had -- you know, there was one -- you\nknow, Esso, that is that very wealthy oil -- a son of them, Hans von Esso, and his sister\nAlie, and I was somewhere, and this Hans from Esso came to us for an address. And I\nnever forget, I was at Yen, that was another one of our group in The Hague, and he saw\nme, and Yen said she brings all the Jewish people to the -- to [indecipherable] to that\narea. And he stuck his hands in his pockets, and he held it out, and it was full with\ndiamond and emeralds, and he, \u201cPlease, find me a place.\u201d I said, \u201cYou can put that away,\nthat doesn\u2019t do anything. I help -- the forest and whatever, if we find a place.\u201d And then -\n- but this was so far in the war, I think they had been somewhere else, where it wasn\u2019t\nsafe, and he had real trouble finding a place. And then he found something, but he asked\nfor his sister Alie, she was beautiful, and younger than he was. And we found a place at\nthis very poor farm, so poor, it was really the married daughter of the farmer where we\nhad Herman. And she was a sloppy household, where they had a bunch of babies. And\nyou know she was -- so that was the only place, and it was so poor, and she had to sleep\nin the hay. And Rosa was at that time at an address [indecipherable] safe, so Rosa was\nthere, too, and Rosa got scabies, you know, that\u2019s really from dirt. And Alie got it too.\nAnd Rosa went to -- back to Arlington when it was safe, and there she was, you know,\nbath and what -- boil the clothes, and so -- but Alie couldn\u2019t take it any more because\nRosa told me later, she said, \u201cThat wife of that farmer was so filthy,\u201d they had on the\ntable a piece of oilcloth or something, and then she said, \u201cthat\u2019s where we had to eat, they\ndidn\u2019t have any tablecloth,\u201d or whatever. So -- but she changed the dirty diaper of the\nbaby there too, on that table, and sometimes didn\u2019t clean, so it was a filthy house. And\nthen Alie, who came from such a wealthy family, and probably had lots of servants, she\ncouldn\u2019t hack it any more, and she went back into her other [indecipherable] and she was\narrested, and she was killed. And I think oh, that poor Allie, if she had only had held out,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because the camps might have been just as dirty. Hans came through [indecipherable].\nNo, we were very fortunate.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re not so fortunate personally, because --",
        "A: I have to look at it this way. We were four, really five years in this war, and if you think\nthat more then two and a half year, every month we had to do those robberies. And they\nwere only once [indecipherable] and you always prayed beforehand if God would protect\neverybody, also the enemy, where the Dutch people were [indecipherable] and I think\nGod is almighty, and Hein was killed in the end of January \u00b045, the war was over. I was\nfree in April [indecipherable] I just know that God [indecipherable] have protect\n[indecipherable]. So I figured -- and so many didn\u2019t come back, and I was spared three\ntimes that I thought this is the end, when I were driven in the dunes, when I had my\nhearing, when I was arrested with all that stuff. So then, I think God still has something\nfor me to do, and I have to find it. And now that I look back I see it, because it\u2019s telling\nthe young people in the universities, and you don\u2019t know a thing here in America. I had\nto speak for Yad-Vashem, I got [indecipherable] later from -- and I met that rabbi, what\u2019s\nhis name? Mordechai Paldiel, have you heard his name?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I mean, he is -- really became a friend of mine. And then they asked me to speak for\nYad-Vashem as a fundraiser, they want to build the school next to the museum, and they\ninvited in, I\u2019d learned, a very wealthy [indecipherable] a very wealthy Jewish people, and\nI had to speak, and then they all got a book, and need to write a fat check, and so on. But\nI mean, I met them, and I think well, I have a purpose, you know? And they say, go along\nwith -- tell, tell, tell, and that\u2019s what I do. And they do that now with teachers, that they\nover the whole world make [indecipherable], and there was in Canton, in Ohio, there is\nMalone College, that\u2019s a liberal arts, Malone College, and there\u2019s a large Jewish group,\nand they ask me -- they started -- I think that\u2019s now about eight years ago, in the summer\nwhen the college is closed, they have a week long that it\u2019s a whole Holocaust week. And\nthe rabbis, and the people [indecipherable] they had then one survivor of Auschwitz, an\nold man, and they had a Jewish lady who was hiding, a Polish Jewish lady. They had the\nPolish lady who had taken Jews in, and they wanted me then to come, and I\n[indecipherable] the whole week, and you know, I was really surprised. The first year\nthey told me they had 12 people, and now there were 45, so this was the third year, and\nnow I hope it grows. But those teachers, that is good, they go back to their schools and\ntalk. Because I -- one lady there, they asked -- I mean, she says, \u201cWhen I was in college,\nmy prof told me the Holocaust never happened, and it\u2019s a sob story that the Jewish people\ndo just to get pity.\u201d So can you imagine that you say that to a class of students? So I feel I\nhave to go. I have to go and then like I was those 10 years in Venezuela, that was a\nhealing time away from everything, no talking about it, nothing. Because when my\nfriends from Venezuela, we only 18 Dutch families, and I knew them all because those\nwomen married mostly, they ha -- they were engaged, and then they got this great job\nafter the war from Shell, so they quick got married and they had their first baby their, and\nthe doctors only spoke Spanish, and they were scared stiff, because [indecipherable] they\nwere expecting their first baby, so I was called out for every delivery, and they all\nbecame my friends, and they were like brothers and sisters. And I still have contact with\nthem. But you know, that was such a healing time, and I never talked about the war. And\nthen when the book came out later, they said, \u201c\u201cWe were 10 years with you, and you never\nsaid it.\u201d But I think that was the good thing that I was away from all memories there.",
        "Q: We have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10",
        "Q: How did you find out about Hein? I mean --",
        "A: Well, his father -- of course we weren\u2019t married, he got a notice from the Red Cross, and\nthat notice said that he had died in Dachau on March nine. So he let me know, and I right\naway said, \u201cIf he has died, 1t was January 20.\u201d And the father really got angry with me,\nbut that was the night I couldn\u2019t sleep, and that I was pacing that big room at that farm.\nAnd I had to sleep in a double bed with a girl in her -- a few years older than I was, if I\nslept there. And it was so cold, and there was no heating, and she said, \u201cWillie, come in\nin bed, it\u2019s so cold.\u201d And I said to her, \u201cThere is something with Hein,\u201d it was that\nhorrible feeling again that I got. I said, \u201c\u201cWhat is today the date?\u201d She said, \u201cJanuary 20.\u201d\nI said, \u201cWhen he comes back, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very, very sick, and that I have to ask him if\nhe was sick.\u201d And that was the night he died, and I heard that later. And the Red Cross\nsay nine, but when other people were let out, some survivors and they -- I -- I me -- I met\nthem, and they said Hein was taken out of the barrack on January 20 in the evening, and\nnever came back. But he was very weak, and he had [indecipherable] where you couldn\u2019t\nwork any more, So --",
        "Q: This was your biggest tragedy. This was your biggest tragedy, yeah?",
        "A: It was terrible, and I know that I made it so difficult for the guy who came to tell me.\nThat was the father of one of those guys that Henk had mentioned to me [indecipherable]\nwas arrested, Dekker was his last name, and he was in the town hall, or town city, or\nsomething in -- in Eindhorf also, and he had to go to The Hague, and Hein\u2019s father wrote\nme the letter that Hein had died. And I was so happy that we were free, and this terrible --\nand the Jewish people could come back, but there was also a fear, there were too many in\nGermany, who comes back, who co -- doesn\u2019t come back. So you were mixed, you didn\u2019t\ndare to be really happy because you didn\u2019t know anything. And then this man came back\nand rang the bell, and I opened the door, and I said, \u201cOh, Mr. Dekker,\u201d and his son had\ncome back, and I said, \u201cHow nice to see you.\u201d I said, \u201cOh how wonderful that we are free\nand now waiting for our guys to come back.\u201d And I was so bubbly. And then he said to\nme, \u201cYeah, but some won\u2019t come back.\u201d And so he wanted to push me a bit down, you\nknow, and I -- yeah but -- and I was just bubbling, and then I got that letter.

We just\npassed Rijssen,\u201d and that is the last city in the Netherlands. \u201cI think that trip will be quite\nlong. Darling, don\u2019t count on seeing each other again soon. I have the feeling that it will\ntake at least a year. But we are with friends here altogether, and you will soon be in free\ncountry, so we have many reasons to be optimistic. And here we see again that we do not\ndecide our lives. Dieneke,\u201d -- that was his nickname for me -- \u201ceven if we won\u2019t see each\nother on earth again, we will never be sorry for what we did, and that we took this stand.\nAnd know, Diet, that of every last human being in this world, I loved you the most. And\nit\u2019s still my great desire that we be -- will become a happy family someday.\u201d And then he\nends with the words, \u201cOmnia vincit amor.\u201d That is Latin for love conquers all. And you\nknow, when we got engaged, it was on the tram in Amsterdam. We had our rings, and --\nbecause we had ordered our rings, and what we wanted engraved. And then he came\nhome, there was a manila envelope and he was on list to go to England, and then he\nfound that manila envelope, and he said, \u201cDiet, these are my instructions to go to\nEngland,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have to leave right away,\u201d and it was a Saturday afternoon, we\nhad just ordered our rings and what we wanted inscribed, and he said, \u201cAnd I may not tell\nyou where I go and what I do, but I go tonight to England.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you remember,\u201d\n-- | didn\u2019t know Amsterdam [indecipherable] he said, \u201cDo you remember where we\nordered the rings?\u201d I said [indecipherable]. He said, \u201c\u201cGo there, pick them up,\u201d -- he had\npaid for it and for the engraving, he says -- and there was a tramway that go to the main\nstation, the central station, and it was line two. He says -- and the tram mostly had three\nor two or three carriages, and there was a balcony that was open where you step on, and\nthen you went inside. And he said, \u201cHop on the last balcony of the last car, and then after\ntwo stops, I\u2019ll hop on too. I have to ta -- get a few things.\u201d So I ran to that store, and I got\nour rings and the guy said, \u201cI haven\u2019t engraved,\u201d I said, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d So I hopped on\nthe tram, on the last cart, and two stops later he came, and he gave me his ring, and I gave\nhim my ring, and that was our engagement, on the back balcony of the -- and then we had\nit engraved later, it -- he was in very big danger, it was a dangerous trip, and he never got\nto England. But at that time, in the beginning we thought that\u2019s where you can be useful -",

But then we have\nengaged on the [indecipherable] and his name and the morning, it was another\npremonition, the morning -- the day that I was arrested -- I had always that ring on, and I\ntook it off, and I said to Alie from the farm, I said, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be arrested.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cWillie, you are nervous, and,\u201d -- Hein had just been arrested then, maybe. I said, \u201cI\nknow I\u2019m nervous,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I have such a strong feeling that I\u2019ll be arrested today.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWill you take this ring till after 1 come back,\u201d because his name was in the\nring, and so then they could say it was Hein. So I gave her the ring, and it was really\nfunny, because I had all white underwear, but I had se -- one set black, and I thought\nwhen you are in prison, and you can\u2019t wash it, and it gets dirtier and dirtier, it -- I thought\nPll put my black one on, it get also dirty, but you don\u2019t see it. I put my black underwear\non, and I knitted [indecipherable] with the cable stitch, and I thought that is nice and\nsolid, and that\u2019s how I went on that trip, and on that trip I was arrested.

And I had a horrible\ntime, but I wanted to see it, and in the end Schindler\u2019s changed because he -- later he\u2019s\nvery sorry that he didn\u2019t save more. And when I walked out of that theater, the only thing\nI said, \u201cThank you God, I did something.\u201d Because I thought, if now I would have seen\nthat movie, I thought you were there. You were young, but you were an adult, 20 year a --\nan adult. And I thought, you were there, and this happened all around you, and you didn\u2019t\ndo anything. I don\u2019t know if I -- and that\u2019s what I tell the young people, I said, \u201cMake the\nright choices,\u201d I said, because -- and I tell them this, I said, \u201cIf I now -- you can\u2019t go back\nand do it over.\u201d",

        "A: -- and -- Diet, and when you write it our way, here they call me Diet, so -- because that\u2019s\nhow you write it.",

        "A: -- it\u2019s an E, that\u2019s how you say the E, Diet.",
        "A: Oh yeah, a whole bunch.",
        "A: Yeah, I think -- it depends with which group, if I thought that my name was getting -- but\nall of us in the Resistance had false names.",
        "A: And with some I was Toos, and with some I was Dinako, that 1s another abbreviation.\nAnd then I left there, and I was -- I was nearly arrested on the name of ar -- I had to find\nanother name again, that they knew my false name.",
        "A: And then I thought -- the guy who made the false papers, he said, \u201cWhat do you want to\nbe your name?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, Ill take the name of the queen, Wilhemina.\u201d And that\u2019s the\nname I was arrested on, so --",
        "A: Yes. Two much older, that were the big ones, and we were the little ones.",
        "A: Albert is the youngest.",
        "A: Dietdee, yeah.",

        "A: We are very close, still.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Stephanie, yeah, Fanny, they say Stephanie. No, in the Netherlands you say Stephana, but\nhere it would be Stephanie, and then I had a brother after that, and he had an old Dutch\nname, Arjen, A-r-j-e-n, Arjen, it\u2019s a beautiful old Dutch name. So they had both of one\nname, and then Albert came, and he only has one, and I am stuck with those three.",
        "A: My oldest sister was eight years older, and then -- so seven years with my other brother.",

        "A: He had an interior decorating business, he was wallpapering, and floor covering, and he\nhad a man who did all the upholstery, and he did everything in interior decorating, and he\nhad people working for him, and he loved it, because I remember in -- when he was in his\n80\u2019s -- you know, loads of people say that you die -- if I would come back, I would be\nsomething different. And I said -- Father was in his 80\u2019s, I said, \u201cDad, if you would come\nback?\u201d He said, \u201cI would go exactly the same.\u201d",
        "A: He loved his work. And he was recommended by a very well known architect, and that\narchitect worked for the lower nobility, you know, we still had dukes, and earls, and\nwhatever. And he always recommended my dad, so he had [indecipherable] royal library,\nmy father always had. In the summer they closed it, they had to check the curtains and\neverything, so -- he had a good business.",

        "A: We had -- we were not wealthy, but we were comfortable, we never had -- except for the\nwar, hunger, or whatever. No, it was -- we had a good life.",
        "A: They sent us -- we had music lessons, and you know, that --",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I was not very talented, but Mom insisted all four of us had to take -- my\nbrother is really good, he can play any instrument he sees. He could be a professional\ncellist.",
        "A: He plays beautiful, oh. And that was his life, but you know, then he wanted to go\nprofessional, but people said to him -- now, he studied for fun six hours a day, forget it. I\nmean, I thought an hour study every day at piano was already long enough, after all the\nschoolwork. But he just loved it. And -- but they said, \u201c\u201cNow it is your love, and then it\nbecomes your work.\u201d So then he went for awhile in Father\u2019s business, but he didn\u2019t like\nit. And he is now -- he studied psychology, and then he married a girl that got a job in\nSweden, in a -- in -- she was dietician, and Anthroposophy, that is the study of Rudolph\nSteiner, they believe in reincarnation, and that is what they are. And then he went to work\nthere, and it\u2019s all what he knew. He made -- now he -- he got higher up, and higher up,\nand then a father of a kid -- they -- they had lots of kids from other countries, in\nScandinavia Anthroposophy is very big, and there was a Danish girl there, and at one\npoint there was trouble in Sweden, he was in Sweden, and they -- th -- they were\n[indecipherable] to him, and he said, you know, you start something like this in Denmark,\nand he did. And he started with six kids, and now it\u2019s one of the biggest things, and the\ngovernment asks, take our kids, take our kids, and it has grown. But he has only the very\nseverest mentally handicapped children, who miss a part of their brain. And they have\ntaught them everything. I mean, it\u2019s as in the Bible, everybody has a gift, and those kids\njust as well. And one is musical, and another one can paint, and another one have[\nindecipherable] things, silversmithing, they do everything. And they have an artist staff,\nand my brother directs, and I couldn\u2019t believe it. There\u2019s -- the -- the television theme,\nand the radio themes [indecipherable] were playing for us. They do not Mary had a little\nlamb, but they do the children\u2019s symphony of Haydn, and none of those kids can read a\nnote of music, I said, \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d He says, \u201cCome along.\u201d And then he has a\nteacher who plays flute, and the kids who want to play flute, look, and they play and they\nmake a few mistakes when the teacher is playing, and the second time they do much\nbetter, and the fourth time they playing without any mistake, and so all the instruments,\nand then they do it together. No, it\u2019s terrific, what he does.",
        "A: My father had a terrific sense of humor. And he was such an honest businessman. I only\nhad very good examples, because you know, when the war broke out, the Germans took\neverything to Germany, but my father had a big supply of drapes, and whatever, he had a\nbig supply. And then all the others, you know, they raised their prices, they could just\ndouble it, or what. My father said, \u201cI\u2019ve worked 30 years for those people,\u201d and he just\nput his normal thing. So I saw that he was not out for money, he was for honesty, and he\nloved his customers. And Mom, Mom was his sweetheart, and the -- I mean, it was a real\n-- they were 64 years married when they finally died, and --",
        "A: Yeah, 64 years. And I can only say she was always, you know, benda -- baker came at the\ndoor, and the milkman came at the door, and the man for the benzena -- you had those\nlittle things, or whatever, it\u2019s not gasoline, kerosene, came at the door, and then in the\nwar, there were no cars, I mean it was with a horse and a -- and a cart, and when it was\nice cold, Mom always said, do you want a cup of hot coffee, or hot chocolate, or\nsomething. So I had good examples.",
        "A: Father was very busy, because in the spring especially, everybody wanted Eman,\nsometimes that he left the house at six, and came home at 10. So we always had our hot\nmeal in the evening, if Father would be home. But he tried every time -- it\u2019s his own\nbusiness, it\u2019s difficult to break out, but I remembered it for a long time when we were\nearly teeners, that he tried always to be home Friday or Saturday night, and then we did\ngames and things, and we could invite our friends.",
        "A: And the other -- our house was always the center of young people, and we had an organ,\nand the piano, and the cello, so there was a lot of classical music.",

Go back to your room, and come back when you can have a\n[indecipherable] face.\u201d And then you got back and you say, \u201cWhat am I doing\n[indecipherable] thing? It was very -- you know, but when you a teenager, you sometimes\nbecome difficult.",

And our exams were not [indecipherable] the school,\nthey had -- you had the parochial schools, the Christian schools, and the public schools.\nAnd I lived in The Hague, and when it was exam time, it was June, then -- or July, then,\nthis section of The Hague, whatever school you were, had to come to a big gimnasium,\nand there were all tables, and the papers were face down, and government guys from the\nDepartment of Education, they were walking -- you were not to talk, you were not\nallowed to go to the bathroom. The bell rang, and then you could turn your paper, and\nthen you had so much time for that subject.",
        "A: And you enter the next subject. And you have two days in writing, and then one day oral,\nand the oral was three weeks later, mostly, after the [indecipherable]. And it was also for\ngovernment guys, [indecipherable] and then you came in the gym, and there were all little\nround tables, three guys sitting, French, English, German, math, geometry, geography,\nand history, and then each half an hour. And you came to the French table, and then they\nsaid, \u201cWhich books have you read?\u201d So you have to sh -- in French, and then you have to\nshow it. And they said in French, tell that and that episode out of that and that book. And\nyou had to do it in French, which is very hard, you know? And so we\u2019re -- and then this\npoem, and then you have to recite the poem. So [indecipherable]",

But I was still happy that I was born\non her birthday, so --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Now, we went to church, and our denomination, Christian Reformed has two services,\nbut my parents said one time we want you to go, the second time, you may. So there was\nno to force like some parents do. And they always, you know, you went to catechism, and\nyou learned the Bible, and it was really a life thing, you know, and you had to -- and I\nstill think, I mean words are cheap, but then you have to do, and that\u2019s why I went -- we\nall went in Rothenberg, and I\u2019m really proud because after the war, years later, I had to\ngo -- in the Netherlands after the war, the queen made a new department, like you have\nhere, agriculture, and to -- now whatever, all the departments. And our queen said we\nhave a department of war documentation. And usually th-they still were looking for\nwitnesses, and by chance they found me in America, and I could help a little bit, so I was\nasked to come to the Netherlands, and I spoke to the big shot from this war\ndocumentation, and he told me that our denomination, Christian Reformed, and it\u2019s really\nsmall, were the highest in resistance, and also had given most of their lives. And I think\nwe are very principled. And sometimes it goes to the -- too stiff, you know, that -- but\nthat you have to want. But it was really [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The Reformed -- the state church in the Netherlands is Reformed, and then automatically,\nlike in England, the queen and the king are the head of the church. And at one point, I\nthink in the 1800\u2019s, there were people who said yeah, but if you are born a king or a\nqueen, doesn\u2019t make you a Christian. So they said, well, that\u2019s not right. And then there\nwere other things, a few more, I don\u2019t know exactly what, so they separated from -- but\nit\u2019s very close, it\u2019s only that -- you know, the [indecipherable] and we have been very\nlucky, because our fe -- our royal family are Christians and they are always members of\nthe Reformed church. But it\u2019s very close to the Reformed church, but it\u2019s smaller.",
        "A: It is a branch --",
        "A: -- that broke off from the Reformed church.",
        "A: Now, they are very biblical. See, because I know here in America the Baptists honor the\nNew Testament, because they say that\u2019s the time that Jesus was born. But the Christian\nReformed see it, it was a fulfillment of the Old Testament, or the Torah, as the Jewish\npeople say. So we had really to study the whole Bible, and at our meals, I mean every\nday, and Father always started each meal with prayer, because if you read the Bible,\nwhen Jesus ate, it always said, \u201cAnd Jesus, looking up, thanked God for the meal,\u201d and\nthen he started eating. So, I mean, it\u2019s practically putting up, and I remember that our\nbreakfast could be that we had to go out in -- in -- you know, my brother, maybe to leave\nearlier for school, and Father sometimes left at six, but the [indecipherable] meal was\nalways that we sat at the table. And then my brother, who is the cellist, is studying, and\nwe -- we had a I-large house, and he was on the third floor, in the music room. And then\nwe all sat at table and Father wanted to say a prayer, and Albert wasn\u2019t there. So they go\nout, \u201cAlbert, you have to come, Father 1s sitting.\u201d You know, I felt like [indecipherable].\nAnd then he did the few, and he forgot it, and we had to call him again, so -- but then, we\nhad had our hot meal, and then Father always pulled the Bible out and read a small part\nof the Bible. He skipped what I call the dull part, you know, this one begat that, begat\nthat, begat that --",
        "A: But -- so we knew the Bible, and every [indecipherable] it was a sacrifice that they sent\nus to the Christian school, they said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t support it, they don\u2019t.\u201d So every\nMonday morning, had to learn the psalm that you had Sunday. The parents were\n[indecipherable] if the kids [indecipherable] for Monday morning, you had to say your --\nwhat you had to memorize. And looking back, you know, then you hated it, but in the\ncamp, and in the prison --",
        "A: You -- it -- I knew so many things by heart, and it came, and it was such a strength, and a\nhope for me. I\u2019m really grateful for that.",
        "A: No, sometimes you thought, oh, you know -- but -- and -- and you had pastors who could\nkeep your attention, and some your -- I remember that I -- we had a church that had a\nroof, an all wooden, beautiful wood, and then they [indecipherable] just to decorate it,\nand I was counting.",
        "A: Yeah, that was -- if it was not an interesting sermon, but I think orchids do that.",
        "A: No, no, th-they -- 1t was when we lived in The Hague, my Mom -- my Mom\u2019s father was\na pilot in -- a pilot at sea, you know, to bring the ships in. And he was always at sea, and\na lot of our family were seafarers. So I think Mom brought a bit, and she always wanted\nto meet, but that\u2019s not good for a business. So then I think we moved west from a house\nto a bigger house, and that was very interesting, it was all -- it had steps, and then a\nplatform, and then there were two doors, and the right one was ours. But on the other\nside, where the street was, it had steps down, and there was souterrain, and -- it\u2019s called.\nAnd then you had -- came in the -- the lower floor, and there was Father\u2019s work store, and\nthere was a big family kitchen like the farmers have, and the -- behind it was a -- a yard.\nAnd we had -- they made a little pond in it, and we had little goldfishes. And then the\nfirst floor had in front, the room where the organ and the piano were, and in the back, the\nliving room. The second floor was Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s bedroom, and the room where\nmy Father received his customers, and then the floor up there, there were the girl\u2019s\nbedroom, and the boy\u2019s bedroom, and there was an attic. So it was more height, you\nknow?",
        "A: And then, at the end of the yard, there was a ya -- what do you call it? It was not a river, it\nwas much smaller, but it was a little stream, and behind that there was a big -- how you\ncall it here, now? [indecipherable], a big -- I think this is called a kaserne.

        "A: And I think I was nine, and I was always brushing the dog, and also push -- polishing his\nteeth, and anyway -- and I felt so neglectful that I never did anything for those turtles, and\nwhen I called them, they stuck their neck out, and they had -- so I took furniture polish,\nand I polished them, and they were so beautiful shiny, and three days later they were\ndead, and my father said that I had clogged up all their pores. But I think they were\nbeautiful in their deaths.",
        "A: We lived in that street, and we were all teeners, and we had such a fun [indecipherable].\nA little bit further lived a family with three boys, and we were all -- so you had -- yeah, in\nGermany, the stuff was getting -- is Hitler, so one of the boys then turned out to be a\nNazi, and the oldest was a Communist, and the in-between was in-between.

And in England you can read the books, that\nthey look down upon the Jews. Germany definitely, Austria definitely, France also a little\nbit. And [indecipherable]. So they came, and in those years, loads of them came to the\nNetherlands, and they said -- you know. And so we had loads of German Jews, and -- no,\nof Dutch Jews who had been there for centuries.",
        "A: Very integrated -- because I was working at a bank later, when I had my first job next to\nHerman and [indecipherable] -- he was Jewish, but later he told me he didn\u2019t even know\nit, his parents didn\u2019t do anything on their religion.

And I was surprised, I thought aw, you know. But my\ngirlfriends were open for it, they listened, and they were very impressed. And then later,\nin \u00b038, so it was maybe two years later, you know it, that Kristallnacht, that those -- and\nin the he -- at that time, I remember in the papers, they pretended that it was a\nspontaneous uprising of the young people against those Jews who are doing all this\ncriminal whatever.",
        "A: But it wasn\u2019t, it was very organized, but [indecipherable] later -- that turned out later that\nthey found that.

        "A: -- or whatever. He didn\u2019t clean himself, but that was a couple without kids, and they once\nin awhile came to visit us. They had no children, and my parents invited them now and\nthen. So one day they ask if he wanted to come, and he talks to my parents, and he said,\n\u201cT have a friend, a Friesian,\u201d they were often [indecipherable] and they\u2019re very proud, and\nhe says, \u201cAnd he lost his wife, and he has 10 kids, and now the oldest has gotten a job in\nThe Hague,\u201d with -- they start with paying so little. See, now the kids go either in the\ndorms, or in an apartment or something. But there was no way at that time. So he asked if\nthat guy could come in our house, and my mother said, \u201cI can\u2019t have a boarder.\u201d She had\n[indecipherable], the phone was always ringing, and people came that they wanted to talk\nto my dad, and she was very busy, and you had no laundry machines, no nothing. So she\nsaid, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d And then he said oh, but -- well, you know. So in the end, my father\nsays, \u201cI need to talk to Wilmer, that\u2019s her decision. She has a,\u201d -- and then in the end my\nmom said, \u201cI can\u2019t have a boarder, but I can have another child.\u201d So he ca -- and I was so\nfurious because The Hague is very old city, and you know, the -- the houses at that time\ndidn\u2019t have a shower and a bathroom. I mean, you had a toilet, but that -- you had\neverywhere those -- what do you call 1t, those basins when -- where you washed yourself,\nand Saturday night you could either go to a public bathhouse, that you had to pay, or you\ncould wash yourself from top to toe, but that was -- at that time, it was 1938 and so. And\nthen, with my brothers, my -- at that time, in \u00b038, my oldest brother had already left for\nIndonesia, he -- he was in the Air Force. Anyway, you ran in your house 1n your\nunderwear, and in your slip, and whatever, and that were your brothers, but if you have a\nstrange guy, you have to put your gown on, and it\u2019s totally different. So I just hated it, to\nhave -- and he had a nice -- I didn\u2019t want an intruder in the house. And then I was so\nangry, I think, that I didn\u2019t speak to my mom for days. And then she said I am so angry\nabout it [indecipherable], I hate it. And I thought, well, I\u2019m going to dislike this guy, I\nmean, he\u2019s an intruder in our house, and I thought -- his name was Hein, now that is a\nfarmer\u2019s name, I hated it. And I thought in -- in the Netherlands -- in here it is beautiful,\nbut in the Netherlands it was horrible if you had red hair. Then they called you carrot top,\nor all the lighthouses had red -- or a lighthouse. So the kids really unmercifully\n[indecipherable], and mostly they had freckles, of course. And then you\u2019ll see he has a\nred hair, and freckles, and boo -- and I was so -- I thought, well, I don\u2019t like him. And\nthen, he would --",

        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: H-e-i-n, Hein. And --",
        "A: -- in -- in Dutch we say Hein. And I think like in German, you have Heinrich, you know?",
        "A: That\u2019s a German name, so this is -- and it\u2019s a name in Friesland, that\u2019s in the northern\npart, and he was from there.",
        "A: Sietsma, S-1-e-t-s-m-a, Sietsma.",

        "A: I remember that I said I\u2019d -- he would come on a Saturday afternoon, I said, \u201cI won\u2019t be\nhome.\u201d And Mom said, \u201cI have to do a few -- a little bit of shopping, but Ill see he\nwould come late in the afternoon.\u201d And I\u2019m home alone, and the doorbell rings, and there\nstands this handsome guy. But then it was Hein, I had to open him, and I was alone home,\nand I hated him. And I\u2019d made up my he -- my mind that I would hate him. So, even if he\nlooked very nice, I hated him, because that is what I had decided. And I wasn\u2019t nice to\nhim at all, and he fell in love with me, and he told my mom. And then later he made\nfriends at the office, and he went to a study group from my church, young men, so then\nthree of them rented an apartment, so he was -- I don\u2019t know, maybe half a year in our\nhouse. But my parents got to love him like a son, and I tolerated him, because I\u2019d made\nup my mind. You know how stubborn you can be.",
        "A: And then when the war -- when he -- they were all mobilized, you know, when the threat\nin \u201939 came, and the end of \u201938, so -- and he had to be at the river, the IJssel, that goes\nparallel with the German border. And there were bunkers near the water, so -- oh, and\n[indecipherable] and they were often there. And because he had been so long 1n our\nhouse, our family wrote him that was the only thing they had. See, now they have those\nnice military homes where they can go for reading a paper, and play piano, and do card\ngames, there was nothing. They slept in [indecipherable] and everybody was mobilized,\npeople with businesses, and there was nothing. So I remember that in the pulpit, and in\nthe papers, it said open your house for the military, and invite them. So with that -- that\narmory right behind our house, Momma wrote a note, Christian family with organ and\npiano, somebody wants to come is welcome, for in the evening, reading the papers, or --\nand then the two Friesians came, and they later told that they quick had taken the paper\noff. So they became like brothers, and Hein was there alone on that -- so we wrote him all\nthe time. And then I had also to write my little note. Father wrote, Mother wrote, Albert\nwrote, my sister wrote. So I -- and then you have here only one word, dear. I-If you write\na business letter you start dear, but also if you love somebody, but we have different\nwords. So the first letters that I wrote was Beste, that is distance, you know, Beste. And\nthen I remember when it really got dangerous, I all of a sudden thought, \u201cOh my God, if\nhe gets hurt or killed,\u201d and then I realized I loved him, but it -- it was really -- and I\nthought -- but in the Netherlands, you know, I think the girls right now, they go after the\nboys, but you didn\u2019t do that back then. And I loved this -- stupid, idiot, I was -- and all\nmy girlfriends were in love with him, and I thought oh, this is terrible, I -- and I told my\nmom, she said, \u201cWell, he was in love with you, he told me.\u201d But then she had told him,\nshe\u2019s not yet ready for it, because -- this is crazy, I -- I really don\u2019t dare to tell this, but I\nmust have been 17, and he came in our house, and I had those two girlfriends, and my\nbrother and his friends, and I was a tomboy. And then Saturday afternoons when we had\noff from school, we often had school Saturday mornings still, we went on our bikes\noutside The Hague, and we have so many canals, and ditches, and trees everywhere, and\nwe had the greatest fun that we took a run, and then tried to jump a ditch. And every time\na rider went in the [indecipherable] always one of us would fall in. You --",
        "A: No, no",
        "A: We put the bicycles on the meadow, and then we took a run --",
        "A: -- and jump. And we climbed trees, and we had so much fun, we play -- I don\u2019t know, I\nthink I was very late that I was mature. But anyway, then Hein ask me all the time, Hein\n[indecipherable] let\u2019s go for a bike ride, let\u2019s go for -- to the dunes, or something. And,\nno I -- I didn\u2019t like him, you know, that was my -- so one Saturday afternoon, my friends\nall had to go to their grandmother in the city, that they could go on a bike, but it was\nmaybe two hours. So they weren\u2019t there, and Hein asked again, and oh well -- well, I\u2019ve\nnothing better to do. So I went, and I told the girls, he asked me again to bike -- go\n[indecipherable]. So then they asked me when I came back, how was it. I said, \u201cSo\nboring, we never climbed a tree.\u201d But he was I think 18, close to 19 and was much more\nmature. So that was the only thing, and then when I realized this, then he -- he wrote us\nback, and then one day I got a letter, and it was directed to me, and then he wrote, \u201cMy\nnext leave, I want come to The Hague.\u201d And he had been before, but it was always for\nthe family, you know. He said, \u201cAnd this time it\u2019s not for the family, it\u2019s just for you.\u201d\nAnd I was happy as possible. So then he came, and then it clicked.",
        "A: With [indecipherable]. He was a wonderful person, always living for others, and thinking\nthat he was so selfish.",
        "A: It was a big, beautiful old bank in the center of the city, and I was -- I had there, with the\ninformational section.",
        "A: That I met --",
        "A: No, I was -- I stayed there shur -- they paid very little. And then I got an offer to work\nsomewhere else, and they paid better, so -- and I took those Spanish lessons, because see,\nthat degree was four years, and I can -- languages come fast, and you just sit in your\nclass, and you have a couple [indecipherable] you back. So I found a profess -- professor\nwho said, \u201cI\u2019ll prepare you for that exam,\u201d -- I asked him. I said, \u201cThen load me up with\nhomework, and I come once a week, an hour that you can check, and whatever.\u201d And I\nhad to pay him, I think three quarter of my salary, but I did it with -- just within two\nyears. So -- and that was worth it. And then I still took another exam, but I needed -- with\nmoney for my -- because I had hardly any left for myself with pocket money, so when\nthey offered this -- it was -- with the other one, was a government job, and it was for the\nfather of a youth friend of mine, who lived three years across from me. So she said, \u201cMy\nfather needs a secretary,\u201d so then I went, and they paid better. But the war days, I was in\nthe bank.",
        "A: Right, days of the war.",

        "A: And I -- we later learned that Hitler had like all travel agents [indecipherable] you know,\n[indecipherable], from us go 10 days to Europe, Wednesday morning for the Netherlands,\nWednesday afternoon for France, Tuesday for Switzerland, and so. And Hitler made a\nschedule for the war, and he had given Monday for the Netherlands, but he forgot that we\nare very stubborn, and we fought five days.",

And they all\nwere drafted, and her fiance had -- had signed a contract that if he went so many years in\nthe -- like here they do sometimes, and then you get free university study, so he had\nsigned up. And he was just ready to get out, and then the war broke out, a-and -- so he\nwas -- had to stay in that service, and he was assigned to a small airport, Ypenburg, just\noutside The Hague. And then the morning of the war, Hitler had the evening before given\na big speech, and I had heard it as ma -- and I knew German. And he said -- because by\nthat time, they had taken -- France was already occupied, because they had been able to\nhold it in ?39. And then he had taken Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, that was\nbeginning of the second World War, they had marched through Sweden, Norway. So\nonly that sliver of the Netherlands, and Belgium were not occupied by [indecipherable]\nFranco was Nazi, whole Europe was Nazi. So we were very, very nervous, and -- and\nHitler said, \u201cI know that the Dutch are scared, they don\u2019t have to be. They are very\nunimportant, and I don\u2019t need that piece of land.\u201d And then he said, \u201cAnd they were not\nin the first World War, and I will respect their neutrality.\u201d That were his literal words.\nAnd while he was saying that, at nine PM, his troops were already marching to our\nborders, and to our bridges, so he was a big, fat liar. And I think that that made me so\nfurious that I thought, \u201cHow did he have the guts to say this on the radio while he knew\nthis,\u201d -- from -- that made me so mad. And then, five days later, when they came in, with\ntheir goosestep, and their helmets, and their tanks, and their proud faces -- I remember\nthat they marched in [indecipherable] out standing the bank, and the tears were streaming\ndown our cheeks. And that\u2019s when I made my vow, I\u2019Il never, never speak one word of\nGerman. We have not invited them. And then -- and we saw what they were doing to our\nJewish people. I got really to -- to hate the Nazi system.",
        "A: I think that our government -- I, as a girl of 19 didn\u2019t think so, because we hadn\u2019t been in\nthe first World War. But I later had, and it was nearly hilarious, that our government was\nbringing itself in [indecipherable] to stay neutral. So they had built bunkers towards\nGermany. So they built a few bunkers along the coast against [indecipherable]. You\nknow, it\u2019s really laughable when you think about it, that they were trying to be -- to be\nneutral, but --",
        "A: Yeah, I remember that night. See, in the Netherlands at that time it was so funny, because\nyou know, the -- the one -- like I say, it was really, the housewife was missing, because\neverything was made from scratch, now we go to the store. You had a store to go for your\nmeat, a store for your veggies, a store for this, for your tha -- dairy. So it took you time,\nan household was a whole day of work. And Monday was always laundry day, and all the\nwomen in the Netherlands, and Tuesday, I think they do -- did the ironing, and\nWednesday, in most houses, they did the living room, and on Thursday -- but Thursday\nwas always the day that -- well, there were no vacuum cleaners, but everybody had rug\nbeaters, and everywhere you heard bing, bang, bung. They hung it over things in the yard,\nand then they beat the rugs. And I remember that I woke up that night, and it was pitch\ndark, and I heard a noise like beating, but very fast. And half asleep, I thought, which\nidiot 1s beating the rugs in the middle of the night? And [indecipherable] it\u2019s much fast --\nand then I heard my parents stir in their bedroom, they must have heard it, too. And we\ngot up, and we went outside, and over our head was a battle between planes, and\nshooting. So then we went back in the house, and turned the radio on, and we heard that\nthey had invaded our country. And then the next morning, yeah, we are so faithful in all\nwe do, and I remember, here we were at war, and then Adriaan was killed -- I mean,\nAdriaan was the fianc\u00e9 of my sister, because [indecipherable], and we didn\u2019t know that,\nso he was one of the first ones who was shot, and killed, the early morning of May 10\".\nAnd I step on my bike and I went to my office. And I\u2019m in a big street, what then was a\nbig street, I was now in The Hague, and that wasn\u2019t so big, but it was still a light street.\nAnd I was stopped by Dutch police. And I thought, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d And they said, \u201cSay\nScheveningen.\u201d And I said it, that was the city where -- where Milosevic 1s now in the\nprison. And then I had to say Schapenscheerder. I don\u2019t know if you can say that.",
        "A: But that is the guy who shears the sheep. And the Germans couldn\u2019t say those words.\nAnd then I could say it, and then they let me go, and they said, \u201cThey are everywhere as\nspies among us.\u201d Because about a year and a half before the war, two years, you could\nget -- the families could get a German maid so cheap, and they lived in your house. But\nall those German maids, a lot of them were spies. And for a long time, every time from\nan air base, or an army base, or whatever, uniforms had disappeared. And they -- it was\nstill -- now you don\u2019t see it any more. I mean, in Vietnam, and in Korea, you don\u2019t see\nthe enemy, they just measure, and I -- shoot a bit farther, or lower, they [indecipherable],\nbut at that time they still saw each other, and our guys didn\u2019t shoot at the whole groups if\nthey came in our country our own uniforms, so it was, oh, I remember, I was so mad, and\nI still -- I think I have that, that if I see injustice, my hair goes up.",

And he had such a boring job, so he went,\nand he was in the air force. And he was shot down when the Japs came in, and he had a\nbig piece of shell in his hip, and they took it out, and stitch it up, and they thought he\nnever walks again.

        "A: Now, then it happened that they started slowly, and I later read that Hitler had told Zize\nIngort, who we got as governor, and that was his reward, that he had betrayed Austria,\nand that Hitler had told him, the Dutch are Aryers, blue-eyes, blonde hair, that was his\nideal, and treat them with gloves, because they might want to be a province of Germany.\nNow, when I read that, I laughed so hard, I thought he has forgotten one national trait\nhere, very stubborn. And that was -- in a marriage it can be a problem, but here it was\ngood, so what Hitler told us to do, we didn\u2019t want to do, simply. So now -- and then s --\nbe -- as punishment, because we didn\u2019t obey, we got curfew. Now, we don\u2019t like to be\ntold to be home from 11 to six, so that was the first thing that [indecipherable] us all.\nThen all the transp -- nobody had a car, and that was not poverty, only businesses like\nSears, or whatever, had cu -- big trucks, but for the rest, nobody had a car. So we had\ntrams, terrific connections in -- in the city, and in all those buses. And it was a few\npennies, they went every three, four minutes, or you hopped on the tram, stepped over on\nthe bus, and there you were. That was the whole -- and then the [indecipherable], of\ncourse [indecipherable]. But all of a sudden the Jewish people weren\u2019t allowed to use\nthose any more. And then they started -- the Jewish people weren\u2019t allowed to visit the\nnon-Jews, so Herman couldn\u2019t come any more. And we couldn\u2019t visit Jewish people. And\nthey were telling us then -- because they were telling all lies over the papers, and over the\nradio, we di-didn\u2019t even bother any more, we turned BBC, that was the only -- that was\nforbidden. And if you still listened, you won\u2019t be -- I always tell the kids here, you\n[indecipherable] half the year to jail if you caught you listening to the BBC. Now, it\u2019s\nridiculous to go half a year -- and then we still listened, so we had to hand the radios in,\nand it went. So I mean, we got more and more irritated in the [indecipherable] so and so,\nso have to get out of this country. But then, you\u2019d still didn\u2019t know what to do, till\nHerman called me one day, and he said, \u201cDiet, I want to see you.\u201d I said, \u201cTo heck with\nHitler, you come to our house.\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t dare.\u201d Anyway [indecipherable] to my\nhouse, either. And then we met somewhere, and that was when the Jewish people started\nto get those papers, you have to leave your house, leave everything behind, and it was\nalways in the curfew, hours that we Dutch couldn\u2019t do a thing. And then --",
        "A: Dee -- that was always during the curfew.",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t be in the street --",
        "A: -- and we couldn\u2019t make a big riot. And they were allowed -- and you know that from all\nyour interviews, they were only allowed to take a little suitcase for each member, with a\nchange of clothing, a fork, knife, spoon, cup, and a blanket.",
        "A: Now, I mean, if you think -- and that still makes me now furious, you know, but you\nthink, they have a right to be there. Some of them were there since 1500. They had\nworked, they had done, they had earned their house, they have worked hard, and you\nhave not only in money value, but you have things that are handed down from family\ntradition, and kids who have pets. I mean, they had to leave everything behind, and I was\nsaying, what was their crime? Their crime was that they were born Jewish. And is that a\ncrime? I mean, I would say, that\u2019s what God decides, the color of your skin. I could have\nbeen born in Nigeria and be pitch black. I mean, you have nothing to say in that. So it\nwas such a terrible injustice, we had never seen anything like that. And I think now the\npeople was really -- are getting kind of -- you know, it\u2019s just the fact that I\u2019ve seen -- it\u2019s\nso horrible. And that night I saw Hein, and I told him, and Hein had read the book that\nHitler wrote, Mein Kampf. And then he said, oh he [indecipherable] because remember --\nand I forgot to tell him that you know that, the night that they invaded our country, that --\nthere was no place in Europe any more, there was no place. Many of those German Jews\ncommitted suicide. And the next day, I wished I had kept those papers, your heart broke,\nobituaries of father, mother, children, all the ages, they had all the German Jewish\n[indecipherable] and they committed suicide. And that was so horrible. And then -- then\nHein and I talked, we said, oh, and [indecipherable] Hitler hates them, he\u2019s going to do\nsomething terrible, but we still didn\u2019t know that they would be killed.",
        "A: Was that in \u201940? \u00b041?",
        "A: No, this is later. But this was -- I think that the Jewish people got their notice the very end\nof \u00b041, beginning of \u00b042.",
        "A: And we had not heard anything about that, that came later, that\u2019s I think June. The -- this\nwas that Herman had to leave, and then we said that can\u2019t happen, but what could you\ndo? I mean, I was twen --",
        "A: In Amsterdam.",
        "A: We heard that later, but 1t was, of course not in the papers, although they shot a lot of\npeople, because like here you have now Rumsfeld, and Cheney, and so -- that when they\nmarch in our country and they weren\u2019t obeying the right way to do things, and we heard -\n- | later heard we were the only country where they did it -- all our own mayors and\ngovernment people are kicked out and all replaced by Nazis. And so [indecipherable] by\nGermans. So that was already unusual. And also they took right away, 70 of our top guys,\nand they were put in a prison, but it was a big monastery in Bravong. And that\u2019s -- it had\n-- it was from the middle age, had meter thick walls. And that\u2019s -- and they were\nhostages, and they told us, if you do anything, those guys will be shot. And they were.\nSome of them -- so they did, because several of them were shot.",
        "A: You -- we didn\u2019t know first what to do.",
        "A: But, you know, when this happen, that Herman told me he had to leave, and that\u2019s where\nmy religion and Hein\u2019s religion came out in the first place. They were the con -- the\npeople that God had chosen to bring forth Jesus, the Messiah, it was for us. In the second\nplace, it says in the Bible, who touches them, and even if they believe that Jesus is the\nMessiah [indecipherable] they are the apple of God\u2019s eye, and who touches them, touch --\ntouches God\u2019s eye. And then also, we thought 1t was such an injustice, and Jesus said, do\nunto others what you want others to do unto you. So we felt we had to help, but we didn\u2019t\nknow what to. And Hein had read that book, and then we got talking, he said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s\nterrible,\u201d he said, \u201che\u2019ll go and do something terrible.\u201d And then all of a sudden Hein\nsays, \u201cI have an idea.\u201d His father was principal, out in the country, in farming\ncommunity, and they were all Christians, and all Christian area there. And all those kids\nhad -- from the farms, came to his school, and Hein was the oldest of 10 kids\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, [indecipherable] that he was born, probably. He was born\nin the other place, but he lived there his whole life. And those farmers gave him all those\nyears, the eggs, and they bought the eggs, butter, everything. So Hein knew all those\nfarmers, and also from the kids who came to school. And Hein says to me, \u201cYou know\nwhat? If I hop on the train, and ask any of those farmers if they will take Herman till the\nwar is over, I\u2019m sure they do it.\u201d And we thought, at that time, that was [indecipherable]\ntimes, the war would last a year, maybe a year and a half. So -- and then I called Herman,\nand I said, \u201cHerman, we have an idea.\u201d And I met him again. And he said, \u201cYes, please.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cAnd can you do my sister, too, Rosa, she is so scared.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat about\nyour parents?\u201d Because I knew -- he said no, my parents say -- and this is really ironic,\n\u201cGermany is an -- an civilized country, and it won\u2019t be so bad, we probably have to work\nhard, and how long will the war will last,\u201d -- we all thought 1t would be short -- and then\ncome back. And they did not want to go in hiding, and not be a bother to others. But\nHerman said he was dating a Jewish girl, and the father had already died, thanks to the\nGermans, and the mo -- she was an only child, and he says, \u201cAda is scared, and her\nmother is scared.\u201d So that was four. And then all of a sudden, they spread the news, and I\nthink within two or three weeks we have a list of over 60. And we -- Hein went to the\nfarms, and they didn\u2019t know me then, but he went, and they all said, \u201cSure, sure, send\nthem, send them.\u201d And that\u2019s how it started.",
        "A: They were.",
        "A: But that was in hiding. And we didn\u2019t bring them to Friesland, we bought them to the\nmiddle of the country Nijkerk, that is -- I don\u2019t know if you have a map --",
        "A: -- but I have a map of the Netherlands.",
        "A: It\u2019s a bit east of Amersfoort.",
        "A: And there, see our country, the south [indecipherable] 1s mostly Catholics, and they did it,\ntoo, and north of [indecipherable] are mostly the Protestant. And -- so -- and Hein knew\nall those people, and they were all from -- I didn\u2019t know they sent their children to the\nChristian schools, and so -- and they were --",
        "A: No. They thought it was just normal, nobody -- I really -- I can still not understand why\nhere in America, I feel sometimes very uncomfortable because I tell here my story, and\nyou all think it\u2019s terrific. And Pll tell you, I wouldn\u2019t dare to tell my story in the\nNetherlands, they would shrug their shoulders and say so what, you did it\n[indecipherable]. No, honest, I thought everybody I met at that time was in the resistance,\nso I thought the whole Netherlands was in the resistance. [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, because this high government guy later told me, he says that in the first place, that\nour denomination was the most. And then he asked me, \u201cWho do you think is the second\ngroup?\u201d And I thought, well we have the same [indecipherable] maybe you know the\nCommunists. And that\u2019s true, you have to be on fire for what you believe --",
        "A: -- and they were. So that is really interesting. You know, we didn\u2019t think it was so\nspecial, you know? It was just what you had to do.",
        "A: Now, they -- you know, in the beginning, we didn\u2019t know how far -- who the Gestapo\nwas.",
        "A: No, you did not realize how -- but then you found out also, that they had officially black\nuniforms, and they were men and women, and all ages, and most of them didn\u2019t wear the\nblack uniform, they were dressed like you and I. So you had to really watch out what you\nsay, to whom, because I could say to -- well, for instance, the -- for the first time executed\n18 guys. Now we were shocked, shocked. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve read that poem of -- oh,\nthat is so beautiful, the 18 -- that was a -- a -- a poet who was shot the next morning. I can\nnever read it without starting to cry. But when that happened, you know, we were so\nshocked, and then we realized you had to watch out if you said to another girl, isn\u2019t that\nhorrible from the 18 guys, and she was a Nazi [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- you didn\u2019t know the person real good [indecipherable] terrible things like that.",
        "A: Well, me?",
        "A: I found that out because this -- there were two girls that we always went jumping over the\nditches, they were from my church, and they were -- one was my age, one was a year\nyounger, and their brother was a year younger again, Daniel, and we were all -- and then\nmy brother was friends with Daniel, and we were as a whole group together. And we\nwent together to catechism, went to church, and to everything. And it was the habit after\nchurch that the parents -- my parents had friends, and they came one Sunday to our house\nfor coffee, and then the other Sunday there. But those friends and I we s -- we played\npiano quartre main, four hands, and so one Sunday it was in their house, and we had fun,\nand until dinnertime, and the next Sunday in our house. And when I -- I think I told you\nthat there -- there was nothing for the soldiers, that they had invited the pulpits and so\ncome to our house, so we had Dutch soldiers. And they were like brother and sister, and I\nsaid, \u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d And they said no, we have five kids, it\u2019s too busy, we\ndon\u2019t do it. And the first Sunday after the war it was in our house, and the second Sunday\nI went to their house, and I couldn\u2019t believe it. You had to go up the stairs, and then over\nthe piano was a big portrait of Hitler. And you had those doors that were gliders, that\nopened -- they had double doors, and I heard in the other room German speaking, and I\nlook, and I see German soldiers. So then I knew that they were all Nazi. And I had right\naway, after the war, I\u2019m always a fanatic, I bought a little flag, and like now you see over\n[indecipherable] after 11/7, that I put it on my [indecipherable]. And I was so shattered\nwhen I saw that, and I said to them, \u201cAs long as this hangs in this house, I can\u2019t set a foot\nhere.\u201d And I turned around and I went downstairs to get my bag. And I think Daniel had\ntold me, the flag of my reich, so he didn\u2019t even feel Dutch any more. And I heard later\nthat Daniel fought at the [indecipherable], so he was not just in name, and both the girls\nwent to Germany and served there with [indecipherable]",
        "A: [indecipherable] m-mice, very [indecipherable]",
        "A: They were also in that group, yeah.",
        "A: We had such a fun -- I couldn\u2019t be -- I wrote a letter to them, I\u2019ve never mailed it, I wrote\nit in my diary, but I was shattered, absolutely shattered. I couldn\u2019t believe it. But see, then\nlater I realized when we met those Nazis [indecipherable] at the border, they were\n[indecipherable]. And my brother later said, \u201cDiet, you guys never s -- talked politics, but\nI was in dan -- Daniel\u2019s room, and he had a lot of stuff from Germany [indecipherable]\u201d\u2019.\nSo my brother was not surprised.",
        "A: But I never knew, never talked about it. And we had [indecipherable], and many pastors\nwho spoke out on the pulpit, and priests, too, were arrested.",
        "A: The Nazi Dutch.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, it was after the war.",
        "A: Because before it was really a camp for -- see, there was such an unemployment, and\npeople got their money, but they wanted them to do something. And so they had several\nwork camps, that the guy who got money from the government could do something\nuseful, let\u2019s say in a very watery place, they were really filling with earth that 1t could be\nused for growing stuff or something, you have so many more -- more s -- more\n[indecipherable] or something. And so the -- 1t was originally a work camp for the -- for\nthe --",
        "A: -- people who were getting welfare.",
        "A: And then they had leave, and they could go home. Then they are rebuilding\n[indecipherable], and only that [indecipherable] or many more of those worked, and\n[indecipherable] and whatever.",
        "A: Where they sent the Jews?",
        "A: I think that might have been the end of \u201940, when then they started telling them to go to\nGermany, and they didn\u2019t go. And that was also th -- because the Jews from The Hague\nhad to report to a big station in The Hague, and they went in [indecipherable] but then,\nlike me with Herman, and so there were a bunch who didn\u2019t go, and others in the area\nwhere that camp was, I think they were told to go there. And then twice a week\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, th-that the German Jews committed suicide [indecipherable] that told us a lot. And\nwe had over the years heard about the Kristallnacht, so we knew that Hitler -- it was not\njust any more words, before we thought it\u2019s a big mouth, and words, but now they were\ndoing.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I really think I found that out after the war.",
        "A: We heard that there were -- no, that it was very bad, and that many people died, but we\nthought of hunger, and of dysentery, and of sicknesses. But that they were systematically\nkilled --",
        "A: But I read a lot of books, and I think this is [indecipherable] Mila 18, that they think that\npeople escaped [indecipherable], and I just got a few weeks ago, and I was shattered, and\nthat was from a man, a real man, maybe you -- oh, what was his name, Kurt something,\nand he was [indecipherable] Christian in Germany, and he hated it, and he had to be a mi\n-- of the party, a member of the party to get a job, and he spoke out, and he was kicked of\nthe party. And he got more and more [indecipherable] of the evil of the Nazi system. And\nyet, how can I actually do something? And he signed up with the SS, but every job that\nhe had done -- I [indecipherable] to give you the name, because it\u2019s --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Oh. And you ne -- he even got to the Pope, and the Pope didn\u2019t do a thing.",
        "A: And I think they got messages to England, to America, and nobody believed them. I can\u2019t\nbe -- oh.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s what -- at the same time that they weren\u2019t allowed to use the -- the trams,\nand the trains and everything any more.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: N-No. And they weren\u2019t allowed to go in parks, to concerts, they weren\u2019t allowed\nanywhere, except they weren\u2019t allowed t-to shop in the big stores, only their own Jewish\nstores, which of course got hardly any in supply.",
        "A: No, it was really -- it was terrible. But later [indecipherable] I c -- I could identify with\nwhen they were looking for me, you know, that you couldn\u2019t go here and there, and\nwhatever, so -- I don\u2019t know. Oh, it was a terrible thing, and that really happened.",
        "A: Well, I can\u2019t understand really, that one human being can do [indecipherable] to another\nhuman being I mean, how hard would you have gotten inside? And then I heard that\nthose [indecipherable] Germans who -- because here you are in a country where there is\njustice, 1t mightn\u2019t always be carried out like we want to, and we\u2019ve made mistakes, but\nthe idea is a judge has to give a sentence that\u2019s according to [indecipherable], and here --\nand we can\u2019t understand it, you were totally dependent on the guy who did your hearing,\non his mood. If he had -- that morning had burned toast, he might sentence everybody to\ndeath that day. I mean, you were totally in their hands, and you had no -- there were no\nright, there was no right. It\u2019s so terrible. And that you always have to watch out what you\nsay, to whom you say it. It\u2019s against anything that\u2019s freedom. It\u2019s terrible.",
        "A: Okay, you got a [indecipherable] again.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: We were --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, we were the -- I -- in the office where I worked, there was ma -- one man who was\nreally fanatic patriot, and you know, I know what he did is -- we listened to the BBC\nnews, and we took shorthand, and we typed it out and spread it, that\u2019s what we felt we\ncould do for the people who were scared and handed in their radios. And also, I know\nthat this guy always took part of the Bible, and say, read that, and it was always from the\nOld Testament, you know, punishment, people who attacked Israel. So it was kind of a --\na stimulants, you know, y -- we do God\u2019s will, because in the Old Testament was --\nanyway it was the -- we were with a group, and there was an other man, and he was\nmarried to a Jewish lady, and he never -- that was the uncle of Herman, and he was also\nstarting to be interested in helping those people.",
        "A: His name was Uncle Frits.",
        "A: He\u2019s probably -- Ohm Frits, he\u2019s --",
        "A: Yeah, and he was -- we -- we were discussing what can we do, but till that time, really,\nthe only thing we felt is spread the ne -- noi -- news of the BBC. But then, when they\nstarted on our Jews, n -- we knew was more important stuff to do. We still did that, but\nwhen we hid the Jews -- but then, it became difficult because an -- at the same time,\nbecause the Germans were occupying all Europe, and they had also drafted the women,\nthey might be the first. But in Germany itself were only very old people, and very young\npeople. And the war industry was going full blast, and the fields need to be worked, and\nthere were no of that age group. So then, in all the occupied countries, you might have\nheard that in Norway, and in France probably too, but was always a handsome young\nman, with beautiful white teeth, blonde hair, big, blue eyes, come to Germany, terrific\npay. And that was on the walls, and in the papers everywhere. And there was a lot of\nunemployment, but we didn\u2019t want to go to Germany. And then, at the same time, that\nwas when they started on the Jewish people, and because the people didn\u2019t go to\nGermany, because we didn\u2019t want to go to the country where -- a few will always go, for\nmoney, you know, but that\u2019s a small percentage. And then they got mad, and they said\nokay, you didn\u2019t come when we invited you, now it\u2019s forced labor. And every male\nbetween 16 and 45 had to go, except from the Catholic church, a priest, and from the\nProtestant church, the pastors, and some teachers didn\u2019t have to go, but a bunch had to\ngo, because what they did, the people didn\u2019t go, and then they surrounded, for instance, a\nhigh school. Now, there are always boys of 16 - 17. So they went in the morning happily\nto school and never came home, they were sent to Germany. And the universities were all\nin that age group, so they were surrounded, and we had many Jewish professors, they\nhave brains, and they were very beloved, and they were kicked out of their jobs, they\nweren\u2019t allowed to have their jobs any more, so their students went on strike, and all --\nthey were -- so all the students, if they were -- they surrounded the university, and they\nwere -- so then everything closed. And so only girls went to school, and the university\nwere closed, also out of protest, strike. So some of the teachers had to go to -- and then\nthey still didn\u2019t want to go, so a lot -- just think that in America, every male between 16\nand 45 has to go in hiding, and that\u2019s what happened. And they went in hiding, but a\nsmall group didn\u2019t know where to go, mostly somewhere in your circle of family or\nfriends, there is somebody where you can go and hide. But those guys couldn\u2019t come in\nthe street any more, because you didn\u2019t know if you saw a young man or a woman that\nthey were Gestapo, so they were -- they really had to go in hiding. But the thing was,\nbecause nobody went to Germany to work there, in the fields -- there was hunger in\nGermany, and they loaded in all the countries the trains full, and the food went all to\nGermany, and we had very little. So they started a ration system with coupons, I have\nsome in my -- you probably have seen them. But anyway -- but the only way you got the\ncoupons, and they lasted a month -- it was about a card this size, and it was so little, a\nGerman guy with an appetite wouldn\u2019t even have anything to eat. And it was very little,\nbut you only got it when you went to those offices. And there were Dutch people working\nbut the supervision all was kicked out, and all replaced by Germans. And you only got\nyour new card -- your new sou -- coupons if you showed your I.D. So those young men\nbetween 16 and 45 never could get coupons again. And the farmers, because you know in\n[indecipherable] they helped their own group, they did not help others, really, only the\ndental family -- the dentist family. But many, Corrie ten Boom, were hiding Jewish\npeople, and many groups were hiding, many. Catholics, and Protestants, and\nCommunists, everybody. So, but those guys -- the farmers had already -- who dared to,\nhad taken Jews, but then we had to go to villages and cities and say, will you take a\nDutch guy. And that was considered less dangerous than taking a Jewish person. But they\ntold us we can\u2019t, because we know they don\u2019t get ration cards, and my own kid is asking\nfor another slice of bread we can\u2019t give him, and a potato. We can\u2019t feed an extra mouth.\nIf you don\u2019t have ration cards, then they don\u2019t get it. And then from some other group,\nyou know, at that time -- now people travel, but at that time, if a farmer and his wife lived\nhere, and they had two sons, then they got farms close by. They all stayed close by. And\nnobody traveled, and all the mail they got might have been a bank statement, and a per --\nsomething of their church, but they didn\u2019t get any other mail. And here we also made a\nbig mistake, we put a father and mother here, and a son there, and a daughter there, and\nthey started writing each other. And that was for the mailman who delivered it, and the\nsecond letter, or the third letter, you have somebody here? And that was suspicious. And\nthen, this was big news, there was no television at that time, the radio was va -- so Farmer\nso and so gets all the time mail, so then they maybe think, do you have somebody, you\nget all the time mail, I hear from the mailman. So they got scared, and some were\narrested, farmers, and they have --",
        "A: Yeah, because they had also a side -- see they -- we had such a well registered country,\nevery family in every village, in wherever you lived, had a card system in every town\nhall. And if a baby was born, the father had to go to the town hall, and say there\u2019s a new\nbaby, this name and that and that, and that went in a card system. And if somebody died,\nyou had to go, a card was taken out. If a whole family moved to another city, that -- you\nhad to report it, and the whole -- but that card system, at that time -- now they can\u2019t do it\nany more, but everything was on it. Your faith, your religion, your job, your whatever\nyou were, your age. So they had all the Jewish fing -- on their fingertips, that they knew\nexactly how many Jews we had. And of course, then they saw that they were not showing\nup in the amount they had to show up, so they got mad. And everywhere, like -- with --\nfor the labor, there were signs, if you help a Jew, you -- you will be treated as a Jew. So\nthen the farmers -- and some were betrayed because of the mail, and they got scared,\nbecause the I.D.s, the identification cards that we all had to have the end of \u201944, the\nbeginning of \u00b041, that had a big, fat, black J printed on it, too. And they had gone to the\nfarms with this thing, and then the farmers came to us, and they said, Diet -- or, I had fal -\n- the false name then, \u201cDiet, can you get us I.D.s without a J, be -- if there ever is a raid\non our farm, that we can say, we didn\u2019t know they were Jewish, we thought they were\ncity people who were hungry, came here for being -- for better food.\u201d And then the\npeople in the city said, \u201cWe will take the Dutch guys if you had ration cards.\u201d And then\nwe were in a bind, because you know, by that time, I think we had hidden about 80\nJewish people all over. And this -- the farmers were scared. We got together, we were a\nreal small group, and we knew all each other from long ago, and we were a Christian\ngroup, and we went on our knees, and we prayed to God, and we had -- Lord, we can\u2019t\njust now say good luck and find your own way. We have to go on, but now we don\u2019t\nknow what to do any more. And I remember I always was jealous of Moses, he got a\nmanna from he -- and he got water from the rock, but the heavens did not open, and we\ndid not get a whole bunch of cards. And then the only way to get it was to take it,\nbecause, you know, there was no other way out, and it was really life and death for those\npeople. So then, after praying, it became clear to us, we had to do a robbery on the\nGerman offices. Until that time, if you treated -- helped a Jew, you were treated as a Jew,\nbut if you did a robbery on the German office, that was the death penalty. And when I\nspeak for high schools, or universities, I always say when I say this, \u201cThis is not advice\nkids,\u201d I said, \u201cbut 1f you do an ar -- a robbery, you better have arms, and revolvers.\u201d And\nth-the British had, over our lakes, dumped at night, you know, big containers full of -- we\nhad weapons, the resistance, but having a weapon was the death penalty. So then it really\nbecame dangerous, and there were a few brave guys that were called the knockploegs, k-\nn-o-c-k ploeg. And they volunteered to do that, every month again. And we found always\na village, or a somewhere, where we knew somebody was working, sa -- a Dutch person\nwas good, and that we can make a dra -- a drawing, where are the guards [indecipherable]\na guard, how many, is -- how is it locked, you know, that they had to shoot it open. But\nthat -- before they went in, that they knew the whole situation. And then before --",
        "A: That -- were three guys who did it for all groups.",
        "A: Well, later -- I knew three --",
        "A: But I -- there were more, and one later was arrested, and he was terrible tortured. And I\nthink then somebody else, you know --",
        "A: -- there were many guys who were willing to do that.",
        "A: Hein?",
        "A: For the farmers, yeah, all people --",
        "A: He went to those farmers, and then he had his best friend Ab, they were our two leaders,\nand Ab was eight years older. And he had a job, he was a representative for a grain\ncompany, and Ab knew a whole other bunch of people. See, Hein knew the parents of the\nchildren, but Ab knew all his customers, and he had a big territory.",
        "A: So he knew many places, and --",
        "A: Albert van Meerveld.",
        "A: And was a street in his village in Barneveld named after him, he was also killed. And --",
        "A: Ab -- were the two leaders of our group.",
        "A: Now later, see, they were -- some were arrested --",
        "A: -- and later we were around 15.",
        "A: And we had two places, Nijkerk and Barneveld, it was the ones that -- was Zwijndrecht,\nnear Dorduf that was the other group. And we met each other, and then we kind of\nmerged. They were decimated, we were decimated, and then together, but we always kept\ncontact, but -- from the Zwijndrecht group, they did a lot in spying, and they got really\norder from England to blow up munitions stuff and so.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Oh, I remember I had once to bring a very Orthodox Jews from The Hague to Duchorn,\nthat is a village outside Apeldoorn. I had -- the man could have been, you know, in\nchildren\u2019s Bibles, you see Father Abraham, real Jewish looking, oh he looked like that.\nWas written all over him Jew. And of -- in the first place, the stem had to -- star had to go\nout. And this man was Orthodox, and later I learned he had his Tallit, you know, his\nprayer thing 1n his pocket and he lost it, and he wanted to go back for it, oh. I had to twice\nchange trains. Miracles happened, because I had to bring him, his wife, and his 16 year\nold son first to Utrecht, there we had to switch to a train to Amersfoort. In Amersfoort we\nhad to switch to a train to Apeldoorn, and then we had to walk I don\u2019t know how many\nmiles to a -- a hotel that was in the woods, and the people had -- nobody had money any\nmore, so they were totally broke, they had nothing. So Hein and Ab went there, and they\nsaid -- they first sends them out if they were good, and they were good, you know, that\nthey were por the Netherlands, and not Nazi. And they said, well we can give you\ncustomers, and we will pay for that, and they have the ration cards and everything. And it\nwas so isolated, so we could bring a whole lot of Jewish people there, but on a Sunday. I\nwas still working in my office, I had to bring this guy. And he had a suitcase so heavy,\nthat I don\u2019t know -- have you ever read that an accident happens, and that it was in the --\nin the paper some time ago, and it has happened several times, and that one woman 1s\nunder the car, and the other woman passed, and it was life or death and she lifted the car,\nhave you ever heard of such thing?",
        "A: Now, I said a prayer. I couldn\u2019t get that suitcase, I said, \u201cGod, this is all they have in this\nright world,\u201d and I could lift that suitcase, I don\u2019t know how. And then in -- then we si --\nwent from one train to the other, the guy loses his Tallit, and he wanted to go back, I said\n-- I told him beforehand, I said, \u201cListen, you sit here.\u201d Martin, his son had to sit there, and\nhis wife there, and I am there. I said, and if you are -- I gave him a newspaper, I said,\n\u201cThe whole trip, keep that in front of your face, because that is,\u201d -- and I said, \u201cif you are\narrested there is no point that [indecipherable] and I go on with your wife and son.\u201d But\nthese were horrible things. And we got there, oh, and then I went to my sister, and we had\nto walk, and we walked into the woods, oh, no, and another night they had told that if I\ncame at 11 PM at the certain station, again Amersfoort, there would be a cab, or a car,\nand two elderly people, and there was nobody. Oh, no, no, it was -- it was more a miracle\nif it went all right. It was a miracle.",
        "A: He had quite awhile.",
        "A: Because then he was really not ready, and he told Rosa, and I still see Rosa all the time,\nshe is a sweetheart, she\u2019s now -- she\u2019s a few years older than I am. And she says I -- just\nwhen I heard it I said, I will go. And so she was really the first one, although we had\noffered it to Herman, and she went alone to Amersfoort, and there they picked her up and\nbrought her to the farm. And she was there a long time, but then became the -- she sor --\nshe was wandering a lot, and then here, and then there, and she was really half dating a\nnon-Jewish guy, and later she was in the part in Zwijndrecht. But she said, \u201cWhen I\nclosed the door behind me, I really had no idea that I never s -- would see my parents\nagain, and how dangerous it would be.\u201d You know we -- we -- we all underestimated the\ndanger, I think, and maybe it was a good thing.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I don\u2019t know. I think later we were willing to [indecipherable] so that we will\nbe [indecipherable] they were looking for me under two names. And then I was arrested\non my third name, and I knew if they found out who I really was, was the end. And you\nknow, I can honestly say, and this sound crazy, I have three times I -- that I thought it\u2019s\nthe end of my life, and I was so young, and at home my wedding dress was hanging. And\nI think you get a special grace from God, you can say it\u2019s okay. And that\u2019s a way when\nit\u2019s over, because sometimes I thing now I\u2019m not as close to God as I was then, but I\nthink when it\u2019s my time, I'll get it again. You know, it\u2019s -- but I think when you really\nfeel you have to, you want to live like God wants you to live, that\u2019s -- and you just do it\nand trust. Well, it\u2019s not always easy to do the right things, that\u2019s what I tell the young\nkids when I go to schools and universities, that whole life\u2019s making choices. You every\nday will do a fork in the road, and I say pick the right road. And that might ask sacrifices.\nAnd I had to speak for the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, about two and a half\nyears ago, or three years ago, and I said to those guys, I said, \u201cIn the profession you have\nchosen, it might easily be that you have to make the highest sacrifice, your life.\u201d And I\nthink, who knows now [indecipherable] how many of those guys have already given that\nsacrifice.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: I can tell you, if I had [indecipherable] Psalms, oh, David went through everything in this\nlife. And when I read those Psalms you know, I thought oh, I don\u2019t know, there is a\nPsalm 27, the lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear, and I thought, yeah,\nthat\u2019s scary. I was fee -- and then it said, when an army comes against me -- because\nDavid was fleeing for Saul, and then he wrote it, and he said, when an army comes up\nagainst me, he will put me on a rock, and he will hide me [indecipherable] and I also, I\nalways knew that\u2019s what God is doing with me, I mean really I shouldn\u2019t be sitting here,\nso many of my friends were killed, so I feel that I was spared for a purpose, and you have\nto find a purpose, and have the time all to see the purpose.",
        "A: I have to try.",
        "A: No, you did -- not allowed to have anything, so it\u2019s good that in our church we had -- we\nwent to the Christian school, and every Monday morning we had to learn a little part of\nthe Psalms, so Monday -- Su-Sunday night, I could easily learn, so my parents didn\u2019t\nhave to bother, but later I was -- you know, we hated all that we had to do that. And\n[indecipherable], oh, what a lucky thing because it came all back to me.",
        "A: You know, I -- I -- I would have gone absolutely -- I think I would have been in\n[indecipherable] in an institution if I [indecipherable]",

        "A: No, because that was so suspicious for the mailman, and then also, the Gestapo opened if\nthey thought that somebody is suspicious, they opened the mail, so that was double. And\nI had to see that every month, even if it was at the farm, the food was scarce, and bad, so\nthey still wanted raf -- the ration cards, so after the robberies, we had to see every month,\nwith every Jewish, and if it was very poor people, we gave them two cards or so. And we\nhad to, if an address became unsafe, you had to find another place and transport them.\nAnd that one Jewish guy, who was our falsifier, in normal life he had been a draftsman,\nand he was terrific, he falsified everything, so he had a room with his wife --",

        "A: Uncle Ben, yeah. Kanis was their last name. And he was very good, and I was often\nthere, because this one had to have a new paper, and that one had to new paper, so we\nwere constantly busy. And at the farms, you know, that was very smart because they had\nlittle kids. And the neighbors, the doors were always open, you walk in and out. So the\nlittle kids were told to say, neighbor, we have buurman, that\u2019s the man, and buurvrouw,\nthat\u2019s the woman, you say here neighbor. But it was just so if the little kids talked about\nthe neighbors, the -- the real neighbors didn\u2019t really -- were not surprised because they\nthought, oh, they\u2019re talking about that -- you know, you had to think of everything when\nyou had little kids.",
        "A: At least once a month, but mostly more. And because you know, for the cards, but at\nsome -- and also, I was allowed to sleep there, so even if I had nothing to do there, but I\nwas in that area, then I could always sleep in, on the bed somewhere [indecipherable]",

But in the\nsouth they had other things too, because they were really -- yeah, I know that there they\ngot orders from England, that was a secret sender that they had to blow up a munition\ndepot, or a bridge, or something.

And he was put in a house, and the girl was\nengaged, they said, to an Italian. And then all of a sudden another guy said that Italian 1s\npro-Nazi, that\u2019s dangerous. So then they brought Hein to another house, and that guy --\nanyway, they said that Italian was dangerous, and they asked us -- that was a Communist\ngroup, and they asked us to stab him on a dark night in the back, and kill him, and throw\nhim in a canal. And we were not convinced that you have to be -- I could do -- I couldn\u2019t\ndo it, but I could let a guy from the -- who had the guns, I could ask him, and then they\nwill do it. But I wasn\u2019t convinced that he was such a traitor. But later they asked me in\nthe German interview, if you absolutely had known that\u2019s a traitor, and he asked, \u201cCould\nyou then have?\u201d I said, not myself, but then I -- if I [indecipherable] you, he would betray\na lot of people, and had betrayed, then I could say yes [indecipherable |",

And I didn\u2019t want to know anything that I\ndidn\u2019t have to know, because I was so afraid that one day I would be arrested, that they\nwill do -- one of their tortures was pulling your nails one by one, and then your feet, and\nanything, I thought I -- only what I have to know, I don\u2019t want to know anything else.\nAnd I said to Hein -- Hein said we should bury him in a big [indecipherable] close to the\n[indecipherable]. That man was good and he had a big -- a walled garden, and we were --\nthey were allowed to bury him in the back of that garden [indecipherable] and after the\nwar you can bury him in a Jewish cemetery, because the Jewish people like that. And I\nnever asked him, and I had such a conscience trouble when Hein never came back, I\nthought, oh, I should have asked him. And when I spoke to that Dutch guy from the\nresistance, he says, \u201cDo you have questions,\u201d because he had questions about a traitor,\nand I knew something about it. And I said, \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cthat Jewish guy,\u201d -- and he\nsaid, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he was buried in the Jewish cemetery,\u201d so that was good that I know\nthat. But then -- then she had so many, and one day Bram was there, and they were all\narrested.",
        "A: They were all arrested, and I made my phone call, and I had told Mies, she had -- she let\nthem use the phone, I said, \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t. You -- you\u2019re living as a lady alone in\nyour 50\u2019s, and you answer the phone.\u201d I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t -- you\u2019re too -- too dangerous.\u201d\nSo she had obeyed that, and I dialed and a man answered, and it was 11, so I thought an\nhour before my lunch time, I thought there she goes again. So I hung up, I didn\u2019t say a\nword. And then around two o\u2019clock I phoned, and a man answered. At three o\u2019clock I\nphoned, a man answered. I thought, this is not good. So I took one of my coupons, and I\nwent to a store across, a food store, and I thought, if that has happened, I knew how they\ndid it, big trucks with guys with machine guns, and helmets, and the house surrounded,\nand so on. And I thought that will be the topic of conversation there. So I took my bread\ncoupon, and I went there with money, and sure enough they were all talking about that\nthere are -- they were all arrested, and Bram, too. And then Hein and I -- I didn\u2019t dare to\nsleep at home, because I had never given Mies where I was, but I did not know that Bram\nhad been there, see? I\u2019d never met Bram. I didn\u2019t know",
        "A: He never met me, but he had my father\u2019s phone number.",

        "A: -- but he had never met, and he didn\u2019t know where I lived, he only had my phone\nnumber. But he was the only one, so it must have been him. But anyway, that night I\nthought well, I don\u2019t know where I slipped up with Mi-Mies that she still found out\nwhere I was, so I didn\u2019t sleep home, and I let Hein know, and he slept somewhere else.\nAnd this went on for maybe 10 days, and nothing happened, so I moved back home. And\nthen co --",
        "A: That I slept --",
        "A: -- | went regularly to the office, but I didn\u2019t sleep at home.",
        "A: And -- because I thought, you know, I can\u2019t take the risk. And when weeks later, Hein\nand I had decided we would get married, and we took out our wedding license, and then\nyou have to go again to the town hall, so on my card was written took out a wedding\nlicense with Hein Sietsma, on his card, Diet Eman. And also, it was very strange, that\nwas May \u201943, May fourth, and I had a real feeling -- our love had grown so much, but\nsomething in my heart said, \u201cAnd you\u2019ll never marry him.\u201d Strange, huh? Very strange.\nAnd I thought -- I can\u2019t see that we ever would break off, but -- and I didn\u2019t dare to tell\nhim. And then, a few weeks later, we had just taken out our wedding license, and that --\nthe town hall in The Hague was a big, very [indecipherable] with marble steps, and I\nthink that by that time, I had told him. I said, \u201cWell, it must be true, but,\u201d I said, \u201cI\nalways had the feeling we would never get married.\u201d And [indecipherable] there is only\none thing, either you die, or I die. He said, \u201cDo you have that feeling?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d I\ndidn\u2019t dare to say -- I didn\u2019t know what, but 1t was somewhere -- subconscious. And\nwhen we walked down those marble step, and he had bought me a big bunch of red roses,\nand I had them in this arm, and he had my arm, and in his left hand he had the papers that\nwe will get married in September, because then you got coupons for [indecipherable] and\nfor some [indecipherable]. And I remember that he take my [indecipherable] and he said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you still now believe it?\u201d And I said, \u201cNow I believe it.\u201d And inside a voice was\nscreaming no, no [indecipherable] it was so strange, it -- it\u2019s scary. Anyway --",

And then --\nmy daughter doesn\u2019t ever want to upset me, and a week later I found out that she had to\nhave a biopsy, she had done a pap test, and it was not good, and she had to biopsy. And\nthat was -- that I -- it turned out that they don\u2019t really know, so she has to have another\ntest, and these doctors [indecipherable] she goes to another one. But it\u2019s very strange, and\nyou know from the book that the night that Hein died --",
        "A: It\u2019s horrible.",

        "A: No, not little things.",
        "A: Twice. The voice said, Kijk nog mar goed naar hem. Have a -- have a good look at him.\nStrange, huh?",
        "A: It\u2019s scary. It\u2019s scary. On the other hand, I think that God may be preparing me\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: That God maybe prepares me for something that\u2019s coming, I don\u2019t know. But anyway,\nthen we went home, and then a few weeks later, that\u2019s when Mies was arrested, and that I\ndidn\u2019t sleep home. But then, after that, when they -- my father wrote of my brother -- he\nhad false papers that he was in the food supply. He opened the door, and there were two\nGestapo guys, but he didn\u2019t know it. First they pretended that they needed me for\nsomebody who needed to go in hiding, but my brother didn\u2019t fall for that, because they\ndidn\u2019t come to your door and ask for a place. So then -- and one didn\u2019t even speak good\nDutch, he was German. And then, in the end they said, \u201cWell, where does she work, we\nneed to speak to her, and it\u2019s very urgent.\u201d And he had to [indecipherable] where I\nworked. So the moment they had left, they called me and they said that two guys, they\ncan\u2019t speak good Dutch, and they were needing to speak to me, and it must be Gestapo.\nSo I picked up my purse, and you know, I always think before you ask your boss, may I\ngo to the dentist, I\u2019ll be back in an hour. And I worked for the father of my pi -- young\ngirlfriend, who -- when we were young, and I knocked at his door, and I said, \u201cI have to\nleave, and I\u2019Ill see you after the war.\u201d So I picked up, and I never went home again. And\nthat was May, 43. So for two years, till the end of the war, because the Gestapo came all\nthe time to my parent\u2019s house, I couldn\u2019t go home any more.",
        "A: I went straight to Hein\u2019s office, because then they knew about him, too, we had taken out\na wedding license. So then he went, and he --",
        "A: He was working at Shell. And he went to Ab, the other leader, and I went first to some\nfriends, and then later -- my sister had just had a baby, she was married, and they never --\nthey were so busy, so she says to -- I -- I went there on my bike, and she says, \u201cOh, can\u2019t\nyou stay here four or five days, and take care of the kids?\u201d The young kids. And then my\nhusband and I can go out and have some time for ourselves. So I stayed there I think a\nweek. And then the guy where we always had the meetings, the patriot from our country -\n- from our office. I was in The Hague with another address and I saw him, and his wife\nsaid, \u201cMy sister in Eindhoven needs a maid, and she\u2019s very difficult, and she goes\nthrough maids like nothing. I can ask her if you can be there.\u201d And I\u2019d never been in that\nsetting, so I thought, hey that\u2019s totally no connection. They might still connect my sister.\nSo anyway, then she said oh yeah, she needed a maid. And she had three kids, and the\nyoungest had a -- I\u2019ve forgotten the name, here, or tosis or something. He had that he had\nto measure od -- my friend [indecipherable] from the office had a son who was mentally\nretarded. And they found out as a little kid he should have had loads and loads of fat, and\nbutter. But it was a d -- a disease that they had just discovered, and the kid of this sister\nhad that same disease. So every day on how you weigh the mail, the -- the envelopes, so\nmuch grams of grease and fat and butter he had to eat. And very little other things, so\nmuch bread. But it was all measured. So she had her hands full, and she was -- she had a\ngood sense of humor, but she was a difficult woman, and that\u2019s why she went through so\nmany maid. But that little boy\u2019s name was Rudy, and he was three years old, and he was\na sweetheart. And I had to take care of him, and it was terrible because it was so\nimportant that he got all that fat, and he never got mentally retarded if he had -- if he\nvomited, I had to scoop it up and feed it again to him. And his mother couldn\u2019t get it in,\nbut I did all crazy things with him, and then he started laughing, and he ate it. So -- but I\nwas there a long time, and she was very difficult. And I was not a maid, you know, I had\nnever -- when I left my home I didn\u2019t even know how to boil a potato. So the --",
        "A: Well, she did the cooking, but I had to clean and do the whole thing, so -- but I learned\nthere a lot, and later on the farms I learned so much, oh --",
        "A: I started out there --",
        "A: No, then I was Dineke de Jong, that was -- but I didn\u2019t go because I knew one family\nthere whose son was also in the resistance, but I didn\u2019t -- for them, that they were in risk\nthat they had somebody in hiding, so I never went to that church or anything. But I\nremember it was a very close by, it was on the [indecipherable] in Eindhoven, and there\nwas -- at the other end of that plane is a plaza, and a park with trees, and there was a\nCatholic church. And sometimes I was so deep down in the dumps that I just -- and the\nCatholic church are always open. Oh [indecipherable]. But anyway, I was there a long\ntime, and --",

        "A: But here there was no really danger, he was very high in the council, city council, he was\nright under the mayor. He was a very nice man. And I loved the Rudy, and --",
        "A: It was Eindhoven, yeah, and that was so often bombarded because that\u2019s where Phillips\nis, you know, and that was the war industry then --",
        "A: -- so and I had my order, I slept on the same floor as Rudy, so if Rudy -- if there was a\nbombardment, we all had to go down, then I took care of Rudy, and they had the two\nother kids. But then one time I got a letter from Hein, and it said, \u201cDiet, we haven\u2019t seen\neach other in such a long time, let\u2019s go to Amsterdam, to friends of ours, and let\u2019s meet.\u201d\nAnd it was a city just outside Duga, so he would come from Friesland, I would -- and the\ntrain would be four or five minutes that we will change trains and go to Amsterdam. And\nit was a s -- it was -- I had to meet him on Saturday, and on Sunday we would be\ntogether. And that lady, I was really the maid to her, and she says, \u201cYou can\u2019t go, because\nSunday after church I\u2019ve invited this lady, and you have to serve coffee.\u201d So I couldn\u2019t go\nfor serving coffee, that stupid hour that I couldn\u2019t see Hein. So I said, \u201cHe won\u2019t take\nthat,\u201d because I know -- I knew him, I says, \u201cHe will be furious.\u201d \u201cOh, how childish.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cNo, he counts on me, and there\u2019s no time to reach him.\u201d I couldn\u2019t reach him\nanyway, he\u2019s traveling. She said, \u201cWell, then you can go to the city,\u201d it was called\nSonnhooven, \u201cand you can tell him that you can\u2019t come in, you have to come back.\u201d\n[indecipherable]. And I was so grateful that those people were hiding me while I was\nbeing searched for, because my parents had all the time the Gestapo over the\n[indecipherable], so it was dangerous, but I was so grateful that I felt I had to do what she\nsaid. So I take the train -- I never forget it, I came in Sonnhooven, and Hein came out of\nhis train, and there was the train to Amsterdam, and he had three or four minutes, and he\ngrabs my hand, he says dos -- I said, \u201cNo I can\u2019t go.\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cCome on, you can tell me\nlater.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t go.\u201d And I pulled back, and oh, he was furious, furious. And he\nsaid, \u201cFor that stupid coffee,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going away there,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019Il find\nanother address, you\u2019re going away.\u201d And I felt so bad because after all, they had taken\nme when I was in big trouble, and I had gotten to love Rudy, and then Hein says to me,\n\u201cDiet, we need you really full time, it\u2019s getting more and more busy.\u201d So I went back to\nEindhoven, and she said, \u201cAnd what?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, like I told you, he was furious, and I\nhave to leave here.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d And they couldn\u2019t believe it, and then they were trying to --\nI said, \u201cNo, they say that they need me.\u201d And that was very hard, and I left, and I\u2019ve\nnever seen Rudy again, none of them.

And it\u2019s almost nice because they -- 1t was\nin an outside area, and there were apple trees, and there was nothing any more, so\nsometimes I had a job that I had to on my bike go to an apple thing and buy apples.

That was a give-away\nthat there were allies, so I thought, I can\u2019t stay here, and I told them. And then Hein\nfound another place on this farm, with co -- with Lozeman. And that was where the\nJewish couple, the falsifier was hiding.

So I se -- but I could go for my work, but I\nsaid, \u201cYou tell me, I can arrange it myself, which date you really need me.\u201d And you got\nso little soap, so every three weeks you did a laundry, and at that time the people changed\nonly once a week their underwear. Their socks were [indecipherable], you could put them\non the floor, and they would stand.

So then I always was there on Monday.\nAnd then the farmer woke me up at quarter to five. And they had a well and a pump on\nthat deel. The deel is the connection to the farm where in winter all the stables are and the\ncows are, and the horse has a stable.

And then in the evening I\nwas maybe -- especially in the months that I had to keep that stuff white, maybe at 5:30.\nIt was all by hand, you know.",

So in our house [indecipherable] we were warned, so we had\neverything -- we had beautiful brass stuff from Indonesia, engraved, so you put it -- there\nwas no plastic yet, that you put it in now. Now, rubber sheeting, what the hospitals had to\ncover the bed, and that went all in the gardens under the ground. So there it was, so they\ndidn\u2019t catch much. But I was in the train, and I was seeing this were the ashtrays that\nwere welded in the trains, here you see that. So I figured that are about six bullets, and\nthey\u2019ll probably one of these days take that off, so I thought Ill be ahead of you. I had to\nmake a very long train trip, and they crammed us 1n a few wagons, and then they had\nloads of wagons where one German soldier was sitting and a big sign, forbidden for\nothers, only for the German army. But when I was standing there so long, and I got more\nand more mad. So I was standing pushed against one of those, and I don\u2019t know how I\ndid that, probably my fury, but in the end I pulled it off.",
        "A: I pulled it off, I wrung it off, I don\u2019t -- so I saved six bullets.",
        "A: No. I mean, this was -- they wouldn\u2019t search your house for this, even if they had come\nand they found [indecipherable]",
        "A: If it happened when I was still home, yes, and otherwise where I was hiding.",
        "A: But this was not dangerous stuff, if you had stolen documents or some, but this -- I think\nthat they never have put two and two together, that somebody in their fury had bothered\nsix bullets.",
        "A: Oh, very good.",
        "A: No, I know that if a Gestapo guy, or a German soldier came, you watched in the s --\nwalked in the street, and he was coming that, then you crossed the street, like that they\nwere poison or something. And I know people who spit on this -- on the thing. They --",
        "A: When they saw a German soldier. And I know that one time a soldier came and asked me\nto go to Scheveningen, and there was a big battalion, and I knew it was there, but I didn\u2019t\nwant to help them, so I said, oh yeah, there, and I sent him 90 to 180 degrees the other\nway. [indecipherable]. Anything that you could do against them, we did. Terrible, hey?\nAlie, and we were alone on that country road, and there was nothing, only those beautiful trees\nthat are in the distance. And I heard clearly a voice, and I s -- can\u2019t explain it. And that\nvoice said in Dutch to me, Kijk nog mar goed naar hem. That\u2019s in English, have a good\nlook at him. And I thought this is ridiculous, that 1s a thought that comes in my head, but\nI heard it again, twice. And then I started looking at him, and he was far over six feet, so I\n[indecipherable] and I looked up, and he started laughing. He said, \u201cWhat are you staring\nat me?\u201d And I didn\u2019t dare to tell him, and I said, \u201cNothing.\u201d And he brought me to the\nfarm, and that was the last time I saw him. And three days later he was in Friesland, and\nhe was inspected in the train like many people, but men especially. And they saw that he\nwas a pastor, so he was safe. But then they searched him, and they found a lot of stuff\nwhat he had there. So he was put in a prison. But we felt -- and I -- you saw those\ncoupons, and those I.D.s, those identification cards. And when we stole them, if that was\nfound in a large quantity, you got shot. I mean, that was the end of your life. So we felt,\nall the farmers, and the people who gave us a bed, were already ru-running a risk. It could\nbe that three in the night there\u2019s the doorbell, and they look for us. So we always had to\nfind a way out, in the back door or through a window, but you know where we would go.\nBut we did not want to bring all this danger stuff in those homes, because it could be that\nI could get out, but that the papers stayed there, and that the people would be shot. So we\nhad rented a P.O. box somewhere, and Hein smuggled a note out, because we wrote each\nother, and then we gave the letters to others, and keep them till after the war. But the last\nletter we always kept, it was kind of, you know, close to our heart.",
        "A: Yeah, before the next. And so he had my fath -- last letter, with my false name. And they\nfound that, and they started looking for me.",
        "A: That was Dineke de Jong.",
        "A: And they were looking for me, so he smuggled a note out, and it reached us, also by a\nmiracle of God, because that was so much work, he couldn\u2019t send it straight, and he had\nto trust a guard, it was a Dutch guy. And the underground hated the Dutch people,\nespecially the police who stayed and worked for the Germans. And sometimes by the --\nby the Communists they were killed. Those adulterators, they helped the Germans. But\nthis guy had stayed to help. And for some reason or another, that Hein smuggled that note\nout via this guy, and 1 -- it came via, via, via, through lots of searching, and underground\ndid that -- man delivered it to the underground, and they found Ab, the other leader. And\nthen it said, \u201cEmpty the P.O. box, and don\u2019t use it any more,\u201d because he had a key, and\nhe would be afraid that he will be tortured, and if the other kept on sending, that would be\nheavy for him, with his hearing. And he said, \u201cAnd let Diet take another name, they know\nnow her false name.\u201d So then they were looking twice for me, my real name, and this\nname. So it was getting -- the net was getting closer. And then he said, And let her warn\nall the guys, and then bring the documents from the -- from the thing to The Hague, and\nhe mentioned a nickname that we called this guy. And so I knew what he meant. So I got\nmy other pe -- identification card again, and then the man asked me what name do you\nwant to have now, because he had made so many. So I says, \u201cWell, the name of our\nqueen, Wilhemina,\u201d and then I just heard the name Laarman -- Laarman. And then he\nsaid, \u201c\u201cWhere do you want to be born?\u201d And there was no time to put one in that town hall\nanywhere, and then you had to smudge it. I says well, make it Surinam, Paramibo is the\ncapital, and that\u2019s Dutch territory, and they can\u2019t check that, there was no mail there, they\nwere free. So -- and then he said, \u201cWhat job?\u201d And that was a problem, because I\ncouldn\u2019t say secretary, because if they said where do you work, there was no Willie\nLaarman, I couldn\u2019t say nurse, I couldn\u2019t say teacher. So I said maid. And there was an\nelderly couple in there, had said, \u201c\u201cWe would love to help, but we don\u2019t know how, we are\nso old.\u201d So I went to them, I said, \u201cNow you can help. If I am arrested, you vouch that I\nam your maid.\u201d And they said okay. So I was the maid Willie Laarman. And then I had\nall that stuff from the -- from the thing on my -- in an envelope in my blouse, and I had\nwarned all the guys, and I had lunch with one of them, in Zwijndrecht, and then I had to\ngo to The Hague, and that was a short trip, only one stop in Rotterdam, and they -- this\nwas in May \u00b044, they had -- were a whole year looking for me already, and the Gestapo\nstill coming to our house, so they had never given up. And then it turned out -- and that\nwas so terrible, because normally if they thought you help Jews they came four or five\ntimes, and then they thought -- there were so many, then they gave up, but they never\ngave up. And we had a spy in the headquarters of the Gestapo that was -- and he worked\nfor us, and he looked in our files, and he found out that Mies had kept a diary, and they\nhad found that diary, and in it said Toos brought 27 ration cards. Toos brought 27 I.D.s.\nToos -- and Hein had been there also, but not so often because he was in other parts. And\nhe had given the name Dick. Dick did this, Dick -- so they were looking for Toos and\nDick that they knew were doing the robberies, or part of the robberies. And that Jewish\ndeal wasn\u2019t even important for them, they wanted that, that\u2019s why they never gave up for\ntwo years. So we knew that they knew everything about us. But they didn\u2019t know who\nToos was. And then I found out that that Bram had been there, and Bram had been, not\ntoo long before that married, and his bride was crying his ide -- her eyes out. And later I\nheard that she paid the Gestapo 5000 guilders. And they told him, you go to Germany,\nand your bride is crying at home. And then, I have no proof, but he was the only one who\nknew who the phone number was, so he gave the phone number to the Gestapo, and he\nwas freed soon after that. But I\u2019ve never seen him, and I -- I don\u2019t know, the guy started\nout good, that he wanted to help Jews, so I didn\u2019t want to make a big fuss out of that. And\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the book, he\u2019s now -- I heard that he died. I checked later out, and I\ndidn\u2019t want to go there, because I thought if he knows what that mentioning of that\nphone, for -- had for results, he would live this terrible remorse or something, so I\u2019ve\nnever made any. But he was the only one who knew my phone number.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, unless that there was anything in the town hall. But they had no idea, so\nthat is a lucky. But I had changed my hairdo, and I did different color glasses, you know,\nframes, so when they were after me, I always, for the new I.D. --",
        "A: I looked a bit different.",
        "A: No, no, I was thinking, now, in this time, from DNA, and from every -- I wouldn\u2019t have a\nchance.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t have a chance, not a chance.",
        "A: No, but I think they would much easier find me.",
        "A: And with the TV, and with all the -- you know, that they ask for in this guy, and the 10\nmost wanted, and whatever. No, I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a miracle.",
        "A: Willie Laarman. And then I said in the train -- and there was so little fuel, before they\nwent every how -- hour, and now they went a few times a day. And the train was nearly\nempty, so I knew I would have to wait a long time, so I had a book, and I had a window\nseat, and I start reading. And I still remember the title of the book, Toen De Herten\nRiepen, \u201cWhen the deer called out.\u201d And anyway --",
        "A: When -- yeah, th-that -- in the woods, you know. Anyway, I was reading that, and then\nslowly the train filled, and after maybe an hour and a quarter, it start slowly going, and I\nlook out of the window, and I felt my heart stop. Six gest -- the trains had those steps\nthen, you know, and six guys stepped on that, opened the doors, Gestapo. Four in\nuniform, and two in civil, but they had the insignia that I knew that was German Nazi.\nAnd then -- several of my group had been arrested, and one got out by pretending he was\na black marketeer. Then they gave you a sentence, but everybody wants to make a buck,\nand that was not so serious resistance, and he had gotten out. And he had told us, if you\never are arrested, don\u2019t show how scared you are, don\u2019t show it, they get their kicks out\nof the [indecipherable]. So how -- don\u2019t -- he gave us that advice. So I thought, I\u2019Il stay\nquiet, stay quiet, and then I thought the headquarters of the Gestapo is in The Hague, and\nthis train is going there, maybe they just have to report, I don\u2019t get nervous. And then\nthey split out, six wagons, six guys, and they started inspecting everybody\u2019s I.D. And I\nhad a real one from the last robbery, but still, you know, and all this stuff here, and they\nwere a year long coming to my parent\u2019s house. I was scared stiff. Oh, I was so scared.\nAnd -- but I wasn\u2019t allowed to show it. So -- but the interesting thing was he started, and\nhe takes an I.D., and he looks and gives it back. And it went so fast, and then he came to\nme. And my heart was pounding.",
        "A: Oh, it was -- I thought he must hear it. It was pounding, and I didn\u2019t dare to look at him,\nbecause you know, I didn\u2019t know if I was blushing, or that I was very pale. I -- it was so\nterrible, so I looked like in my book that it was very interesting, but I couldn\u2019t see a word,\neverything was dancing. And I gave him my I.D., and everybody got it back night away,\nand I didn\u2019t got it back. And then he said in German to me, \u201cWann haben sie das\nbekommen?\u201d When did you get it? And I wasn\u2019t going to speak German, but I knew what\nhe said. I said -- and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t speak der -\n- ger -- German, can you speak Dutch?\u201d And he went on and on, and he was screaming,\nand I heard what he was saying, and he want to know when I had gotten this. And then an\nother traveler [indecipherable] speak, he says, \u201cHe wants to know the date you got it.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cOh, that\u2019s on it.\u201d And -- but you know, and the other five hadn\u2019t found anything,\nand they all came in this compartment, and they gave one look at my I.D., and they burst\nout laughing. And after the war -- I never knew till after I got out what had gone. They\nhad printed -- and you saw the copy, in deep purple, and it had all the data, and a\nbackground like money that you can\u2019t falsify, but one of the little things was nationality\nDutch. And that was printed in deep purple. But everybody 14 and over had to go and get\nthat I.D., so in the beginning we had I think about nine million inhabitants, and a lot --\nmillions over 14, so they had handed out millions. And after that -- that was in the end\n\u2019A40 -- beginning of \u201941, they handed out to everybody who turned 14, then you had to go.\nAnd in *43, they ran -- ran out, they had no more. And they printed exactly the same,\neverything, except those to -- two little words nationality Dutch, instead of deep purple,\nin black. And if you don\u2019t know it, you could barely see it. And I had one of the last\nrobbery, and it was a black one, so that was printed in \u201943, but the guy who made the\nfalse papers, wrote automatically I think \u201942 or something. If he had done a duplicate that\nI'd lost it \u00b043, I would have been okay. But on that I was arrested, and later that man from\nthe government, he said, \u201cOh, you had a black -- you had a black nationality.\u201d He said so\nmany were arrested. So then the underground started to check and found that. So after\nthat they did those all duplicate, and later date, but I was one of the victims.",
        "A: Yeah, after --",
        "A: The -- there were so many arrested, relatively, you know. So they knew there was\nsomething, and then they went over that. It was really -- I always think it was nearly like\na chess game. You do this, we do that, you do this. And here they had a smart\n[indecipherable]. So --",
        "A: And then the train stops in Rotterdam.",
        "A: And it\u2019s a big station, one of the biggest in the Netherlands, and they said out, and they\nhad a little office there, and they looked through my little [indecipherable] and I had\nsome data, but I had made my own shorthand that nobody else could read, and this -- oh,\nthis is spy material. I said no, and then they wanted to know -- they said, \u201cWell, if you\ndon\u2019t talk,\u201d and I s -- I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying, I d -- I don\u2019t understand\nGerman.\u201d They said, \u201cOkay, you go to the headquarters.\u201d And that is where they did this\nstuff, so I was really scared. Back to the station, and it was a chilly day, it was May\neighth, \u00b044, and it was drizzle -- like now, drizzle and rain. And we have many benches\non this -- on the station and everywhere, but nobody was sitting, because it was so chilly,\nso they were all walking. And it was crowded, because there were so many -- so few\ntrains, and many people. And they said to me, \u201cSit here.\u201d And then the leader of the\ngroup, he had a higher rank, he was standing here, kind of facing the other five, and the\nother five were in a horseshoe, five facing me. And I thought this is the end of my life,\nbecause now I go to prison, and I knew you had to undress, and then when my blouse, I\nhad buttons, you know, I thought, when they find that [indecipherable]",
        "A: I had all the papers from the robbery there.",
        "A: I had it in my bra, and it was stolen I.D.s, and there were two pilots who wanted to get to\nEngland, and they were in that age group, so we had to give them also the papers. And\nthere was a way to get back to England via Belgium, France, over the Pyrenees to\nPortugal, and then a submarine would pick them up. And we have helped sa -- several,\nand when they were in England they gave secret code that we knew they were there. But -\n- and for those guys, if they were stopped, they couldn\u2019t speak Dutch. And so they had\nthe Dutch papers, and if you had like the -- where the Jew was the J, if you had a big scar,\nor at that time you still had people with what they call that -- those red -- now they can\nwith ice get that off when you\u2019re a new baby, but at that time it was called a veinflak. It\u2019s\na big thing that -- a scar of thing, and everything special. So on that -- for those guys we\nalways wrote deaf and dumb. And we said, \u201cIf you are arrested, don\u2019t say a word, and\nyou don\u2019t hear.\u201d",
        "A: So -- but we got many back to England. And then -- but you know, I was brought in, I\nwas sitting there, and I was praying there was [indecipherable] for those, and there were\n500 guilders because by -- it was towards the end, and many Jewish people didn\u2019t have\nmoney any more. And in the cities we had to pay the people something that they could\nbuy the food, you know, and the Jewish people were so eager also, collecting money\nfrom people who didn\u2019t dare to do dangerous things, but were willing to contribute, so it\nwas a busy time. And then they --I -- I was praying to God, I thought, oh, this is the end\nof my life, when I go to prison I have to undress, and they find that, and Pll be shot\n[indecipherable]. And I thought of my wedding dress hanging at home, and the -- all the\nexpectations we had. And I was praying to God, and pleading. I said, \u201cWe are helping\nyour people, and then,\u201d -- and I says, \u201cYou are Almighty,\u201d and I was really pleading with\nGod, I said, \u201cYou are Almighty, can you give a moment that all people don\u2019t look at me,\nand that I can get rid of that envelope.\u201d Then I\u2019m still in a bind, they are looking\n[indecipherable] then I had a chance, but here I have no chance. And then I always say,\nhumanly speaking, when five people are watching you, what are your chance that all five\ndon\u2019t look? You can say zero. If it was one he could be looking another way, if there are\ntwo, they could be looking. But five? And I always say it says in the Bible with God, and\nwith God all things are possible. And the guy who was standing here, he had a raincoat of\nstuff we had never seen. And at that time the fashion was that all the raincoats were made\nof gabardine, and only pockets here in the side. Nobody ever had -- and inside pockets\nhad never -- in no coat, you had not have it happen. And he had a shiny coat, it was a\nmilitary coat, battleship gray. And one of the Germans, I heard him say, \u201cIs that that new\nmaterial? Is it really waterproof?\u201d It was the first plastic, plastic had just been found out.\nAnd then another, I heard all what they said, said, oh, and how nice, it had two big\nstitched on pockets. Those pockets, that is handy, that had never -- and this tall guy said,\nhe said, \u201cYou think that is handy?\u201d He said, \u201cThis coat has pockets on the inside.\u201d Now,\nthey had never -- and they all said, \u201cOn the inside?\u201d He said yeah, and he opens his coat,\nright, and he was over six feet, and all the five heads went in the raincoat to admire.",
        "A: I had opened my blouse --",
        "A: I -- I needed -- yeah, when I started praying, I\u2019d opened the blouse.",
        "A: And I had only to grab it and throw it.",
        "A: Well, there were loads of people walking, hundreds were walking up and down, this\ncould be anybody\u2019s. So then they would have had to arrest the whole station. And\nwhoever found this was lucky, he had the ration cards, he had 500 guilders --",
        "A: -- and the rest he can have thrown away, but --",
        "A: No, because they didn\u2019t know I had it on me, of course, so they didn\u2019t even look. And\nthen I wanted to get away from it, so I said -- and one guy could speak a bit Dutch, I said,\n\u201cTam so chilly.\u201d And I was. I said, \u201cCan we stand in that tunnel?\u201d Because there were\ntunnels that go to the next platform, and I heard him say to the other, \u201cLet me alone with\nher, [Il get it out.\u201d I thought, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what you think.\u201d But I didn\u2019t know any of\nwhat he said. So we stand in the tunnel, and you -- when you are so long in that work,\nyou get really a look at people, that you -- and I saw he was very vain, and so I started the\nconversation, and he could speak some Dutch. I said, \u201cNow, when you go through those\ntrains, what are you looking for?\u201d Like I was [indecipherable]. He said, \u201cOh, for spies.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cFor spies?\u201d I said, \u201cAnd -- and who -- how do you find them?\u201d And he start -- he\nsaid, \u201cYeah, two days ago we had a guy, and he had all secret films, and,\u201d -- I said,\n\u201cWhat did you do? Shoot him?\u201d He said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cHe tried to run away.\u201d I said,\n\u201cAnd what did you [indecipherable] shoot him?\u201d He said, \u201cNo.\u201d I said, \u201cI can run hard.\nMay I run away\u201d\u201d I said to him, \u201cDo I get a head start?\u201d So I was joking, like I wasn\u2019t\nnervous at all. And I talked the whole time, and then the train pulled up, and he had this\nbig head, and he had [indecipherable] didn\u2019t have a word [indecipherable]. And then I\nheard him again say to the others, \u201cLeave me alone with her in the apartment, I -- in the\ncompartment, I get it out.\u2019 And I went on in the train. But then -- oh, I ran from one fear\nand another, I -- later when I looked back, I thought, oh God, I should have cracked up.\nBecause the train ended, and there -- then we had to take a tram to Scheveningen, and\nthat was line eight, and it was around five o\u2019clock, and that tram went exactly past the\nbank where I had worked, and the people left at five. And I thought, oh God, if any of\nthem -- and it\u2019s raining, hops on, say hi Diet, I\u2019m sunk.",
        "A: I -- from one fear and another. And I wanted also to know the people, and because they\nhad -- the uniformed people left, and the two in civil, with the insignias on -- and I was\nsuch [indecipherable], and they left me. So we sit in the tram, and then you had a conduct\n-- conductor who collected the money. So he came to me, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m not paying.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cYou have to.\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cThen I throw you off the tram.\u201d I said,\n\u201cPlease,\u201d because I sit he -- I said, \u201cI\u2019m sitting here very much against my will.\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cWhat?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, those two guys,\u201d \u201cthey have put me here.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, those two guys,\u201d and they had -- said, \u201cthey have put me here.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cOh, la -- you\u2019re fur [indecipherable] you got -- you\u2019re arrested?\u201d I said yes. So\nthe whole tram knew that they were two Germans, and that they were arresting me, and I\nthought, if the tram gets in a jam, they probably help me that I can shoot out of it\n[indecipherable] to -- to the prison -- off to the headquarters of the Gestapo. And there I\nhad to sit for hours, because you had those special cars that they arrest people, and they\nhave a special name, betsies, or something, I don\u2019t know what. But anyway, there was not\none, they were out to collect Jews, and whatever, they had to sit there for hours.",
        "A: Okay.\nTape #7",
        "A: In that -- they -- in that building of the Gestapo, the headquarters, I had to wait because\nthey were -- they had big, black yar -- cars that they brought you to prison and arrested\nyou apart from if they had the whole group, they did it on trucks with machine guns. But\nthey were wal -- waiting for [indecipherable] because they were doing raids in The\nHague, and arresting people, probably Jewish people. So I had to wait a couple of hours,\nand then they brought me to the prison. And it was the same arrogant guy who was in the\ntrain. And he could speak Dutch, and I remember that in that car he says to me, \u201cYeah,\nnow I can\u2019t help you, you\u2019re a young girl, and I feel so sorry that you go to prison now,\nbut you didn\u2019t tell any, now you have to go to prison,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you still tell me\nhow you got this paper,\u201d he says, \u201cthen you get very special pr -- treatment in -- in the\nprison. You get -- may choose every day what you want to eat, and you get every time\nwith your meal a glass of wine.\u201d And I thought, how stupid does he think I am? I -- I\nknew definitely that wasn\u2019t true. I mean, how stupid? So I just played along, and I said,\n\u201cYeah, real -- really?\u201d And you know, in Dutch? And he says yes. I said, \u201cMay I even\nchoose appelmoes?\u201d Was applesauce, and that\u2019s -- it\u2019s such a stupid word, appelmoes,\nand I thought that he would then realize. He said, \u201cOh yeah, you may choose appelmoes.\u201d\nWell, I said, \u201cI -- I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- I have this paper, and I don\u2019t know.\u201d So anyway,\nthen we came to the -- the prison, where Milosevic is now, that\u2019s a big prison for\ncriminals. But it had a big, high wall, and it had a small side door, and it\u2019s round, and it\u2019s\nstill there. And -- and there was a bell that you can press, and they stood there, and they\nhad told me, don\u2019t show that you\u2019re ascared, you know, and we were standing there, and\nhe said, \u201cYou can still tell me, I haven\u2019t yet pressed, you can still tell me.\u201d And then I\ntook his thumb, and I pressed it. And he gave me a whack. But then I was brought in, and\nhe disappeared, and I had to stand for a long time in a corridor, and on one side are all\ncells. And I had to face the wall, and stood there for a long time, and out of the cells I\nheard all voices, and they said, \u201cWhat is the news from the outside world, what is the\nnews from the outside world?\u201d But I didn\u2019t know if these were Gestapo guys who wanted\nto check, so I -- I feel always guilty, because if they were real prisoners, I thought I\nshould have told, but I didn\u2019t want to take the chance. And then they brought me, it had\nmany corridors, A, B, C, D, and I was in corridor A, in cell six, some that -- the\nhandkerchief, I think it was six or eight. And they put me in, and it was three meter, now\nthat\u2019s a little bit longer than three yards, and two meter, right? And it had -- I didn\u2019t know\nthat -- a drum in the corner, and only one cot, and it was meant for one person, so small.\nAnd very high window with bars. And I was number five, there were four others. And\nthere was an old Jewish lady, Mrs. Spire, and she had the cot, and we slept on stone, on\nthe floor. It -- it was a prison for criminals, so I didn\u2019t know what are the other women,\nyou know, they could be criminals, they could be [indecipherable] they could be\nanything, but the Jewish lady I knew was okay. And I had been the whole day in the he\ntrain, telling all the guys, and I had been sitting at that station, and then 1n the\nheadquarters of the Gestapo, and then I had to go so urgent bathroom, so I said to those\nladies, how -- \u201cWhat do you do? I have to go bathroom?\u201d And I thought that they say,\nwell you have to go -- knock at the door and then they bring you to a toilet. And they\nturned around, and they pointed at this little drum. And I -- you know -- that this was the\ntime now you go camping, and women shower together, and there is no -- but this was\n1944, and everything was so proper. And I thought, I\u2019m not going on a thing with those\nwomen that I\u2019ve never seen. But you know, I couldn\u2019t hold it until after the war, so at one\npoint my pride went out of the window, and I had to go on the tippultum, and that\u2019s what\nit was called. Oh goody.",
        "A: They asked me all questions, but I couldn\u2019t speak German, so --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t ge --",
        "A: I started then, because first you know, I was kind of that I didn\u2019t answer, I was -- and that\nI pushed, I thought it was kind of -- when you\u2019re going to -- but then I thought, hey, I\nhave to do dumb. And then I never spoke German already, but then I really pretended,\nand when they ask me I shrug my shoulders. And I think later that saved me. I think that\nthey let me out that they had -- they didn\u2019t have trains any more because the queen has\nspoken from England, and said that all the people who worked for the railroad had to go\nin hiding, too. So all the Jews were in hiding orway, all the men between 16 and 45, and\nnow all the railroad, and the queen said, and their families have to go in hiding, too,\nbecause in \u201944, the end -- they were so mean, if they came to arrest a man and he wasn\u2019t\nhome, they took his wife, the children, the baby. If you were pregnant they took you. And\nthen the man came back and was shot, so it was a crazy world, and there were not enough\ntrains any more. So -- but we were brought there.",
        "A: I\u2019m in a cell with those other four women. And then I was so lucky, because the Jewish\nlady was brought out, and every Tuesday, and every Thursday night my heart broke\nbecause then they had rounded up the Jews, put them in the prison, and then they\nseparated the men and the women, and the children. Oh. And then you heard them,\n[indecipherable] mama -- mama. It was terrible, terrible. And then --",
        "A: Then they -- all the people that they had arrested were brought to Westerbork.",
        "A: Now, the Jewish lady was taken out",
        "A: And then an other young woman came in. But see, this was 1n the dunes, in The Hague.\nThat prison is right on the edge of the dunes, and in the dunes, that was sperrgebiet, it\nwas forbidden territory. And they have made many bunkers [indecipherable] to England,\nand there was also the place of execution, and that was known Waalsdorp. And I\u2019Il spell\nthat later with Elizabeth. But that was the place of execution, and they had already\nexecuted so many people, but you couldn\u2019t get there. And then --",
        "A: No, it was farther in the dunes, no --",
        "A: -- it was farther in the dunes, but we knew it, that was the place of execution. But it was\nright on the border of the koshda dunes, and then the osh -- the North Sea. And at the -- in\nthe morning we got that rusty cup, we had to stick that out, and they poured 1n a -- in the\ndoor was a little thing that they could open, and then you had to come, and the -- often it\nwas bohoi -- boiling hot brown water, 1t wasn\u2019t coffee, they poured over your hands, that\nyou burned, but it was all you get, and at lunchtime -- anyway, there was nothing except\nthat -- but that young girl came in, she was I think 22 or 23, about my age. And when the\nallies flew over, because they dropped bombs sometimes, if they knew that they were\nbuilding something [indecipherable] and that has to be, I mean, but it is scary if you\u2019re\nsitting in the cell and you hear bombs falling close by. But we knew that we would never\nget in -- gotten free without sacrifices, and if it was us, so be it. But we always, when we\nheard our friends in the sky, that were our hope, you know, and then everybody went,\nbecause there was a cell left, and right, and in the back. And then you went to the hole,\nand you started knocking, and knocking, and knocking. And they did it, and with a whole\nbunch, but the whole prison was nearly trembling like it was our friends are in the sky,\none day we will all be free. And this happened when she was there, but this girl comes in,\nI can\u2019t remember her name.",
        "A: No, that was not Sonia, no that was another one. She wanted to, with her beauty to -- to\n[indecipherable] she was Jewish. [inaudible]. Anyway, this girl comes in, and --",
        "A: Barzilai, yeah, Sonia Barzilai, I felt so sorry for her.",
        "A: Yeah, this was a young girl, and she comes in, and here we are -- she was the fifth one,\nand she comes up to me when we had introduced ourself, and she says to me, \u201cYou\nknow, I know that Pll be out very soon. Do you have a message for the outside world?\u201d\nAnd I thought, \u201cThat is crazy, why doesn\u2019t she ask the others also?\u201d",
        "A: And so that was already fishy. And all the time she came to me, and I thought -- and I\nsaid, \u201cListen,\u201d I said, \u201cyou both -- you all know, when you are here, you never know that\nyou\u2019re out in a few days, it\u2019s impossible. You don\u2019t know how long.\u201d And then in the end\nshe said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m engaged to a German, but he is a good German.\u201d I thought that for\nme there are no good Germans at the moment. I thought -- and she said, \u201cNo, but he -- I\nknow he gets me out.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I have no family here, and I\u2019m just a maid and\nthe people where I am, they don\u2019t really care for me, they only care now that the laundry\nisn\u2019t being done.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd I -- now I have no -- nobody who is interested in me.\u201d So I\ndidn\u2019t bite. But then the next night, the allies flew over and dropped a bomb real close by,\nSO we run to our walls. And she ran to the front door where the guards were, and she\n[indecipherable], \u201clet me out, let me out [indecipherable] allies, and let me out, you know\nI don\u2019t belong here.\u201d So she was planted. And I see everywhere God\u2019s hand, because this\nwas at the very beginning of my -- of my prison time, so I knew don\u2019t trust anybody. It\u2019s\nthe lesson I got.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Don\u2019t remember her name. And then I -- she was there so short, just two or three days.\nAnd then we were brought -- the invasion came, and then they got very nervous, and we\nwere all loaded in -- 1n trains, and in -- in -- really in trucks. And see, Corrie and Betsie\nten Boom, you\u2019ve heard that name, of course, too. But they came from another city,\nHaarlem, and I never heard of them, we didn\u2019t know what they were doing. But we were\nfrom The Hague, a lot of us --",
        "A: -- and we were driven in the dunes. And when you came out of the prison, you came on\nthe long lane that was called the van Alke madelaan, and the city, and the railroad\nstations were to the right. And to the left was only the dunes and the place of execution.\nAnd they drove us to the left, so the Dutch -- the Hague people thought we are going to\nbe executed, and I thought so, too. So you had to prepare yourself for being shot. And I\nknow that several -- there were so many, there were 1800 I heard later. So we were in\nloads of trucks. And some of The Hague people were so scared they jumped out, and\nthere were soldiers sitting with machine gun -- with mi -- mitarios machine guns, I think\nyou called it. There was no point, a-and I don\u2019t know, we have dunes in Michigan the\nGreat Bear dunes, you can\u2019t run in dunes, it\u2019s sand, and it goes up, there was no way, it\nwasn\u2019t practical, so we went there. But then later my father told me -- he was born in\n1883, that when there were no cars yet, and there were a couple of very expensive hotels,\none was the Oranje Hotel, the Orange Hotel, and development people came to the big\nstation, and for those people, there were no cars yet, and they -- they didn\u2019t have any\nsuitcases, especially not this [indecipherable], they had big trunks for [indecipherable].\nSo they had made a side branch with a little train that came to flu -- near the hotels. But\nover the decades, that was totally covered with sand, and some of the Nazi Dutch people\nmust have known that, so ha -- they had unearthed that station, and they were afraid to\nship us from in The Hague itself, they thought -- and -- they did it in Amsterdam, and\nthere was a big riot, and a fight, that the underground wanted to liberate the people from\nthere. So they avoided that, and they brought us there in the dunes, so we were not shot,\nwe were loaded in trains. Crammed in trains, and I was in the same compartment with\nCorrie and Betsie ten Boom, so that was the first time, and you know that story, of\ncourse, maybe you\u2019ve read, \u201cThe Hiding Place,\u201d and some other --",
        "A: -- of the [indecipherable]. And they were in their 50\u2019s, so I thought at that time they were\nold ladies. And they were each in a cell because they thought that Corrie had tee --\ntuberculosis. And their old father, he was a very wonderful Christian, and he was a very\ndistinguished gentleman, very well known in Haarlem, they had an exclusive watch story\n-- s-S-store, and when all the Jews had to wear a star, he went too. He said, \u201cThey are my\npeople, and I am a Christian,\u201d and he wore the star. But they were arrested\n[indecipherable]. So -- and their old father had just died in that prison, so they met each\nother, and Corrie and Betsie met each other then, on that trip. They were sitting hand in\nhand and crying, and then I heard their story from the other prisoners. And then the train\nwas also black, when -- you know, curtains, that not a light shown, and we didn\u2019t know\nwhere we were going. But the noise changed, we went -- so I knew, I thought if we got in\nGermany, the chances for survival would pfft. And if we stay in the Netherlands, and in\nthe south you had a -- a Vught, and in the middle you had Amersfoort, Camp Amersfoort.\nSo we didn\u2019t know where we were going, it was dark and all the curtains were down, it\nwas night. And then all of a sudden, the whole noise changed, and it was so -- and then I\nknew we were going south, that we were going -- because -- you saw on the map the\ncities of Zwiyndrecht and Doordrect, but there is a big, big river, and that\u2019s called at\nHollands Diep, and that is so big, and there is a large bridge over it, and we were going\nover that bridge, and I had done that many times on my bike. And then I knew that we\nwere going to Vught. And at one point there was a toilet, and everybody stood in line to\ngo to the toilet. And when it was quiet, that there was nobody, I see a girl go in, and I see\nthat she -- there was a window, and that was also -- but I saw that she took the black\ncurtain up, and there was glass, and you could open that, and I thought that she had\nopened it, but there were soldiers with machine guns on the roof of the train, and I\nthought she knows this area, and I thought she\u2019s trying to escape. But if somebody goes\nin -- so I stood at the door like I would be the next one. I thought Pll give her a chance.\nAnd then at one point, we went through a wooded area, very curvy so the train had to go\nslow. And I saw her jump. So then she jumped out of that window, and she rolled -- I\ndon\u2019t know, we went further, but the train went slow, so I said a prayer that she would\nmake it safe. And then I went to the bathroom, I didn\u2019t have to go, but I had given her the\nchance. So I went back, and we came in the camp, and then they counted, all -- eight\nprisoners had escaped on that trip, so --",
        "A: Eight. So I knew one of them, I hope that she survived. But I felt really great. And then\nwe were brought in that -- was in the night, I think we arrived at two o\u2019clock in the\nwoods. We had to get out. There were all soldiers with helmets, and bayonets and\nscreaming --",
        "A: Well, this was when we -- they count us inside, we weren\u2019t yet in the camp. But you\nknow, the train with prisoners came, so then there are soldiers, and we were 80\n[indecipherable] prisoners, so they were [indecipherable] warned that we would be\npunished. They didn\u2019t have [indecipherable] for us. What was unexpected was the day of\nthe invasion.",
        "A: And then --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, they were furious, they -- all the time we had role call, or something, and\ncounting --",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know if they ever found out who, because it was a chaos with the invasion,\nyou know, the -- and then we were -- and there were big Dobermans, and we were pushed\ninto the camp, and then we were in di --",
        "A: Doberman dogs, and soldiers, so they -- I mean, you didn\u2019t get a chance to escape, they\nwere [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- and guys had bayonets and guns, and whatever. And later we went in a barrack number\nfour, and that was really a camp within a camp, because see now, if you had three or four\nof one case, they kept you in different cells that you couldn\u2019t agree you\u2019ll say this or that.\nBut now we were just mashed together, and they [indecipherable] guards, and we weren\u2019t\nallowed to say one word to each other. And then we were all brought to a separate\nbarrack, the women number 75, and the men were brought somewhere else. And for days\nwe couldn\u2019t speak to each other. Day and night that we were not allowed to say a word to\neach other, till they had quick interrogated the keepall -- the people from the same cases.\nAnd then after a couple of weeks, I think, then they stayed the whole day with us, the\nfemale guards, and on the four corners were four S.S.\u2019s, and the S.S.\u2019s were the volunteer\nHitler elitengrup, and they -- they had their awesome -- you know, the swastika is from\nthe Nazis, but the S.S. had the wolfs angel, they had that sign like that. And they -- on\neach corner were always S.S.\u2019s in every barrack, four. And this was May, June, July,\nAugust. And I remember it was very hot, and we have nothing there. We got cots, and\nvery thin mattresses, and three high in long rows, of course, like in all the barracks. And\nthen the only thing we had -- there was a washroom -- washroom, and that had drofs and\na pipe, and faucets. But that was all, we had no soap, no shampoo, no towels, no toilet\npaper, no nothing. And I was arrested in my clothes, so if I wanted to wash any of my\nunderwear, then I must [indecipherable] it out till it had dried [indecipherable]",
        "A: Not yet, later --",
        "A: -- later I got a prison dress, but --",
        "A: -- [had no clean underwear, or anything, I was arrested with what I had worn. So that\nwas very hard. And then, because they checked us, and the other girl had to make the\ntwine, and I was picked out there, \u201cOh, you\u2019re a maid, you have to do the laundry,\u201d of\nthose guards, and from a whole bunch of guards, and I got two other girls to help me, but\nI was the maid, so I have to be the leader. And on the -- on their shirts they had that wolfs\nangel embroidered, and I hated that more than the swastika. And this women -- the\nguards, they had to take turns, and there we stood, three, and it was all [indecipherable]\nstuff, because there were no laundry machines. So then -- sometimes they got so bored,\nyou know, to sit there and see those three girls the whole day, and they locked us up and\nthey went away for a beer, or a coffee, or whatever. And when they were gone -- and\ndon\u2019t forget, I was in my early 20\u2019s then, and then we took that sh-shirt and undershirt,\nwith that hated swastika on -- no, the -- the wolfs angel, and we got a nice big gob of\nsaliva, bull\u2019s-eye. And this -- but every day when we were alone, and every day we went\na little bit back, and we got so good in aiming. It was really -- and later, you know, Corrie\nten Boom asked me later to be with her, and help her to arrange a home for the Jewish\npeople who now had nobody, she had a home for. Cases that didn\u2019t go to sanitortum\n[indecipherable]. So she had that, and I helped her those six weeks. And she had a friend\nwho was a psychiatrist, and he wanted to talk to her. At that time, if you went to a\npsychiatrist, they thought you were nuts, you know, that was -- so no, we didn\u2019t want it,\ndidn\u2019t need it. But he was so interested, so in the end we said okay, and then I asked him,\nI said, \u201cYou must think that we were crazy, that we got such a kick out of spitting on that\n-- on that horrible thing that we hated while our lives were at stake.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cthey tried to break your spirit, and they couldn\u2019t, so that was a good thing.\u201d\nBecause if we had been naughty, we had to stand there, appel had -- now that is horrible -\n- it -- 1t doesn\u2019t sound horrible, but you had to stand, marble, you know, with your thing\nhere at the side, and you weren\u2019t allowed to move. And you know, after seven minutes\nyou start swaying, and they fainted left and the right, and then all those guards were\nsitting there and laughing. And we put a smile on our face when they made us do that.\nLike we got those delicious cookies, like they had given us something nice and we stood\nthere, and we fainted left and right, and they got mad at us. And I remember that they\nsaid, \u201cDie Hollandische weiber sind schlimmer wie die Polakken.\u201d The Dutch -- and then\nweiber is a degrading word, here weif is a normal word, but it\u2019s a degrading word, you ha\n-- the Dutch women were worse than the Polakken, than the Polish. That was\n[indecipherable] and then they yelled at [indecipherable] like they had given us a great\ncompliment, you know, like [indecipherable] you are perfect, and we stood there, and\nthey were furious, but that were all our little fun thing.",
        "A: The wolfs angel?",
        "A: Because the swastika was the general Nazi thing, but this was volunteers, and they were\ntrained in cruelty. They could blindly obey, and they were trained -- I read that when they\nstarted -- they are volunteers, so they signed up for this, then they got an -- a new puppy,\na -- a German Shepherd puppy, and I don\u2019t know if the training was two or three years,\nbut at the final exam, now dog is your friend, and they had just [indecipherable] to kill\ntheir dog. That -- they could do anything. And I heard [indecipherable] from another\nfriend of mine, who went through so many camps, and he was later the head editor of a\nvery high standing Dutch magazine that came, The Alsafeer, that\u2019s one of\n[indecipherable] and he went through so many camps, and if he saw a scrap of paper, he\nwrote something down, and he put it in cracks from in the wall, or whatever, and after the\nwar, he picked it all up, and he wrote a book, \u201cNacht und Nebel,\u201d [indecipherable]. I\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard about it. And they volunteered. I mean, what they did fi --\nthey said, kill this prisoner, and they were free to do it. They hung them, and then they\nwere nearly dead, they got them down that they could breathe again, they did that\nsometimes three times with the same -- now is that cruelty? I mean -- no, I hated that sign\nmore because that was volunteers who did that.",
        "A: I was totally alone, and you know, I scraped in the wall of the prison, because they took\neverything away, but that was the time of the bobby pins, and they had not taken my\nbobby pin, and all the other women did -- to keep the date [indecipherable] so all the\nothers did one, two, three, four, five, that -- from the days that they were -- so I didn\u2019t\nhave to do that. But the very last word our Jesus said before he went back to heaven was,\nlo, Iam with you always. And I scared that in the wall, and I thought I\u2019m never alone. So\n-- and that\u2019s what I had to cling to. And I never felt alone, I knew He was always there. I\ntrusted. Yeah, that was -- but it was a very rough time and in the end, I\u2019ve got two people\nthat I\u2019ve trusted. And that was -- one was a Catholic girl, she was in about the same\nsituation, I don\u2019t know how I got to trust her. And the other was a lady, and her name was\nMrs. Verschoor. And she was in her 40\u2019s, and the suffering was engraved on her face. It\u2019s\nso intense sad, and it really struck me. And I asked others, \u201c\u201cWhat is the matter? What is\nthis hurt?\u201d And they told me she had only one daughter, Yoka, and the girl was 18,\nstudying at the university, and she had helped pilots all the time escape, and she was\narrested, you heard her name [indecipherable] Yoka Verschoor. And she was arrested,\nand she was nacht und nebel and it was that you disappear, nobody knew any more. So\nMrs. Verschoor did not. And then somebody said yeah, and they lived in Paramibo, and\nthat struck a chord because on my false papers I was born in Paramibo. And one day --\nwe were 175 women in the camp, and there was a very famous film star. Like here,\neverybody knew Judy Garland, something similar, Ennie Meunier. And she was -- and\nEnnie was there, now, why the heck is Ennie Meunier in this camp? And I asked others,\nand they said she is engaged to a German. So right away [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s the matter. So one day Ennie Meunier hears that I was born in Paramibo, and I\ndidn\u2019t know a thing about Paramibo. I knew much about Indonesia because so much of\nmy family and my brother, so many had been there. But I didn\u2019t know a thing about\nParamibo. And she come, \u201cHi Willie, I hear you were born in Paramibo.\u201d And I said yes.\nAnd she said, \u201cWhere did you live?\u201d A street -- I had no idea about a street name, but we\nall had diarrhea, and then you could run away. I said, \u201cOh, I'll talk to you later.\u201d And I\nran away to the bathroom, and then afterward I avoided her like the plague, because I\nknew -- oh no, she says to me, \u201cWe were on [indecipherable], I mean, we were there, did\nyou see me,\u201d in a big play. I said, \u201cNo, my father was just on leave, he hated it so much\nto miss that.\u201d Because in a small Dutch community, that\u2019s a big thing. And she said,\n\u201cOh.\u201d And then she asked me where I lived, and I thought oh no, so I ran away and\npretended I had diarrhea. And then oh, she comes back, and what do I say, and if she\u2019s\nengaged to a German -- who is engaged to a German during this time? So I was really\nscared. And then I had heard that Mrs. Verschoor had lived there, and we all had diarrhea\nbouts, and then you were allowed -- they were allowed to leave their paper stuff, and I\nhad to go. So I saw that Mrs. Verschoor ran to the bathroom, and there were 10 on a row,\nand we had to go in groups, and were watched by a female guard. Anyway, Mrs.\nVerschoor runs, so I run, and I sat next to her, and --",
        "A: [indecipherable] back?\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "A: Oh yeah, and then I asked this lady, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me any questions, but tell me\nanything about Paramibo.\u201d And I said, \u201cA street, where do people live, regular people.\u201d\nShe says, \u201cHeerenstraat,\u201d and she told me all about it. So that was -- and then after the\nwar I went to her house. She got out and her daughter got out. And, well -- so I know\nthat. But that helped me, and when Ennie Meunier then came, I knew something.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t like it, but at least I had answers, you know. But I -- anybody who had\nanything to do with Germans, I stayed really away, and the -- like you say, I was very\nlonely there, because I couldn\u2019t trust anybody I didn\u2019t know. But there was one girl, and\nshe was go -- when we were called out for hearings, we were scared stiff because that\nwas life or death again, you know. And it all depended on the mood of the guy who\ninterrogated you. And we knew it was in a little building, and there was one girl, and she\nwas called out twice a week at least, and mostly around two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and\nI told you -- this May, June, July, August, beautiful day, summer, and she was never\nnervous when she went. And she stayed awake for hours, she came mostly back around\nfive. And she had a couple of tan shades darker. So I thought, you are not in that little\nbuilding of the hearings. I thought, you are a spy, you are planted here. Because I knew\nthey had done that in prison, but from her I knew it. So I was afraid for the spies,\n[indecipherable] but her, I had already pinned down. And another thing happened, and\nthat was kind of funny. One time a big filling fell out of my tooth. And you stick all your\ntongue in that when there is a hole. And what do you do? So one night one of the girls\nwakes up screaming, screaming. And so we went to the guys at the corners, because we\ndidn\u2019t know they had -- by that time we were there so long they locked us in, and there\nwas four guys, and the windows were all open because we -- I think we stunk, because\nwe had -- never had soap or shampoo. But anyway, those guys, we were warned, and then\nthey [indecipherable] there came an ambulance, and they took her away. And I thought,\n\u2018What happens now to her when she is,\u201d -- I thought [indecipherable] kill her, or what\nAnd they said, \u201cNo, there is a hospital here.\u201d And that\u2019s all prisoners, the doctors, the\nnurses, [indecipherable] everybody is a prisoner except the leaders are Germans. And I\nsaid, \u201cIs there also a dentist?\u201d They said, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s also a dentist.\u201d And by that time\nwe had all had our prison dresses, and if you had had a hearing it was navy blue, gray,\nnavy blue, gray, and it had pockets. And if you had had your hearing, then you were\nclassified, and you got a triangle, and you probably know about that, but when you were\na political prisoner you got a red triangle. If you were a murderer you had a green\ntriangle, if you were gay you had a pink triangle, and I think the Jehovah Witnesses had\nsilver, gray, or something. But that was after your hearing. And Corrie and Betsie had\nalready been called out. And so I heard that there was a dentist, and I asked permission --\na boring life, you know, every day the same, and we were hardly ever marching, because\nwe weren\u2019t allowed to go outside. And so then I said, \u201cCould I go to the dentist?\u201d And\nwith eight other prisoners, we were brought by a soldier with a machine gun to the\ndentist. So we walked through that camp, and it was in a little building that was -- I think\nnext to the hospital, but I didn\u2019t know, we came through a door. And we had eight of us\nto sit on a bench, and I saw that the dentist had a green triangle, and he was a Greek, but\nhe spoke fluent English. And he -- and he had a green triangle, so he was a murderer, but\nI thought, well, maybe he has killed a German, and then you know, for me he is a good\nmur-murderer, yeah. It\u2019s terrible that I say that, but you know, you didn\u2019t know what -- so\nanyway, it was my turn, and I -- but this city where this Camp Vught was so close to the\nPhilips factories, and all the young men had been sent to Germany, and the top guys, who\nwere necessary, they had been exemptioned to go to Germany. But they said to the\nGermans, we need Dutch people -- we need people to work here, we need laborers to do\nthe work, why don\u2019t you send some busloads of those prisoners every day? And then they\nwere fed terrific by those Dutch guys, and Philips makes radios, there was no TV yet, so\nthe Germans couldn\u2019t constantly watch, so those prisoners who worked there, they loved\nit, they got food from the Dutch, and if any of the German was gone, they put the BBC\non, so they heard all the latest news. And they told it in the camps, so that dentist knew\nall the latest news. So it was my turn, and he starts drilling, and he said, \u201cWould you like\nto know the latest news?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, please.\u201d So he told me they were marching up at\nItaly, and it was going so good for us, so there was hope, you know. And then when my\nturn was over -- he did the temporarily filling in it, so I had to sit back on that bench, and\nthe next one -- but that German had to watch us, but also the dentist and the patient, so he\nwas slowly walking up and down, and up and down. And I was sitting at the corner, and\nhere was a door. And the door started slamming. And that\u2019s such an irritating noise, so I\nclosed it [indecipherable] and a moment later it was slamming again, and I thought, that\nis not coincident, so I kept my eye on it, and when the German had gone this, and was\nwith his back to door -- the door opens a little slight, and a hand came up, so high piled\nwith bread, much nicer bread than we had outside. And was margarine on it. So I grabbed\nit, but the German could come back, so what do you do? I gave all the girls one, and was\nno time to eat, so it goes here, that\u2019s where you stuff everything. And then the German\nwalked again, and the hand came again, and we went in [indecipherable] and we went\nback to the barrack [indecipherable] down, and it was really funny. And we knew the\nnews. So the next time -- the temporary, he did that three or four times, and then he said,\n\u201cNow I have to put a real one in.\u201d And I was so sorry, I thought no news, no bread,\nbecause we shared it with those eight girls, especially w-we thought were going to die.",
        "A: And I was so sad, and he says to me, \u201cBut I can drill a hole in a good one,\u201d and he said,\n\u201cT won\u2019t touch a nerve.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, please.\u201d And he did several of my good ones, and I\nwas there for weeks. And you won\u2019t believe this -- so then 1n the end, I think that he was\n-- and we heard heavy artillery in the distance, and that was your general -- we didn\u2019t\nknow it was, but we knew they were our friends the liberators. And the Nazis got terrible\nnervous, and these were our friends, and they didn\u2019t want anybody of this camp ever to\nbe liberated. And then they started, every sunset my barrack was right on the edge of the\ncamp, and there was water, and they said there was electricity so you can\u2019t escape, and\nthey said there is a mine field. And then you had that fence with the towers and machine\nguns, and then there were the woods. And the machine guns were every time at sunset,\nand it was in the woods close by that we could hear it. And one day I\u2019m doing the\nlaundry, and there were two clothes -- and all clothes, and 1t was covered with blood. And\none woman from the guards -- I remember it, you were never alone, and you longed to be\nalone for a moment, and think and pray. And I had to clean the little room where the\nguards were always sitting, and there was a [indecipherable] and I was very softly\nhumming a -- a hymn that was really consoling to me, and this woman came in. And she\ncould have yelled at me, because you weren\u2019t allowed to sing. And she said to me, and\nthat\u2019s German again, I have to spell it, \u201cSie singen wie ein Heidelarche.\u201d You sing like a\nheather lark. And I was really sad, and I didn\u2019t have a beautiful voice, but I knew that she\nwas not the cruelest, you know, she had some soft. And she was just on duty, so -- and\nshe could speak a little bit Dutch, they all could. So I said to her, \u201cWhat is this, all this\nblood?\u201d And you know, I had to soak it, and blood has to go in cold water, in troughs\nwhere we had to wash ourself. And it was horrible. And she said, \u201c[indecipherable] two\nguys who have been on a motorbike, they had an accident, in the hospital, and they come\nout and need their clothes,\u201d so I washed them. Two days later, I got 12 sets of bloody\nunderwear and clothes. And that whole 12 was filled with blood, and all the 12, and I\nthought this is not just something. So I went to that spy, and they all did kind of pitiful to\nme, they thought you\u2019re a border case, you\u2019re not all [indecipherable], and they said --\nHanny Janssen was her name. I said, \u201cHanny, I have to wash all clothes, you know, that -\n- that\u2019s hard to do every day, but now it\u2019s all bloody. What would that be?\u201d I did real\nstupid. She said, \u201cOh, that are guys who are, every sunset when you hear the machine\nguys, are executed. They are traitors.\u2019 And it were our Dutch guys. And you know, they\ndragged you from one camp to another. And the next day I got 36 of those bloody\nclothes, and that trough was filled with Dutch blood. It was so horrible. And I didn\u2019t\nknow if Hein had been brought [indecipherable] Ab and I started to look always when I\nhad to wash those clothes, for names. And I was shattered, and I don\u2019t know, I -- I\ncracked up, because also we had buried weapons in my parents house, under the roses,\nunder the bushes, and I didn\u2019t know anything. I thought, if they all the time come and\nsearch, and they dig up the yard, and they find the weapons, they\u2019ve shot my parents. I\nreally -- I thought my -- I thought I was absolutely going crazy, I didn\u2019t know any more.\nAnd if I didn\u2019t have my faith, I would have -- I was -- I cracked up. I was -- the next\nmorning I couldn\u2019t get up, I was paralyzed for three days. And they sent the camp doctor,\nand he kicked the bed, he said, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\u201d But I was so weak that\nthen they don\u2019t me -- me -- they didn\u2019t make me do the laundry any more, they gave me a\nbroomstick, and I had to sweep. And then I started hating them so much, you know. We\nsay I hate this, or I thi -- old President Bush hated broccoli. And I think you don\u2019t know\nwhat hated is. With every molecule in my body, hated those Nazis for what they were\ndoing. And I was so angry with God. I thought, you are there in heaven, these are your\npeople that they\u2019re killing. They\u2019re killing my people, and you can stop this, and you\ndon\u2019t do a thing. And I was praying God\u2019s damnation on the whole bunch. I was still\npraying, but I was praying horrible prayers, only God\u2019s damnation. God [indecipherable]\nthis or that. And just then, there was one girl that I -- I said I trusted too, apart from Mrs.\nVerschoor, and her name was Freddy, and Freddy was a Catholic. And just in all this\nstuff that you heard, that was your General Patton, who was getting closer, and closer by\n-- and just in [indecipherable] of my hearing, and I had -- all those months I had trouble\nwith you may not give false witness, 1t was one of the things what was in the Bible, a\nstory of a spy, Rayhab, and she lied, and she was not punished by God, but she was\nblessed [indecipherable] Jesus. So when I thought of that, because I knew the Bible from\nthat -- I thought, oh that\u2019s God permission, so I said, oh let -- okay lord, I consider that I\nhave your permission to lie, and now give me a good story. And for months I was praying\nif they had interrogated me then, I wouldn\u2019t know what to say. But every day I\u2019d work on\nthat story when I went to bed. And I was born -- I thought, as little ballast as you can\nhave. So you have a father, no he has died. You have a mother? She has died. No brothers\nand sisters. Because if you -- three months later, I didn\u2019t know how long I would have to\nsay it, you have to tell the story exactly the same, the same dates. So it was really a matter\nof life and death. And just when this all happened, I had my story ready, but I was\nrepeating it every night, you know, because sometimes they shook you up at two in the\nnight, and you had the hearing that -- in your sleep, or half asleep you may say the wrong\nthing. And Freddy saw that I was called out for my hearing, and she knew that was life or\ndeath for everybody, except for this Hanny Janssen, and the officer from the Gestapo\ncame for the hearing, had to sign me out. And she pretended that she had diarrhea, and\nshe stormed from her twine making, past me, and while he was signing me out she\nwhispered in my ear. I\u2019m going to storm the gates of heaven for you. And you know, me\n-- I say to friends, Pll pray for you, but this was so much stronger, I don\u2019t know if you\nknow that story -- the gay guard at -- that comic, you know, you see him with a ram\ngoing. And you know something, another second miracle happened apart from the rain\ncoat. I walked out with that man, and we had to walk maybe eight minutes, or 10 minutes\nto the main building of the hearings. And because I knew the Bible, and I was bombarded\nwith God\u2019s promises. And one of them 1s, not a har -- hair of your head will be harmed\nwithout the will of your heavenly father. So they couldn\u2019t even touch a hair of my head\nwithout Him. And the second one is something that you don\u2019t need every time, but it said\nalso, do not fear be -- if you have to appear before authorities and kings, I will give you\nthe words. God promised me. And I said, okay Lord -- like Tevye on this \u201cFiddler on the\nRoof,\u201d you know, he was always talking to God, I said, \u201cI have broken many promises,\nbut this is a promise, and I hold you to your word. But you just have to give me the\nwords.\u201d And I walked in that building, and in that room, and there were a whole bunch of\nNazi -- very high Nazis sitting behind the table, S.S.\u2019s. I knew their ranks, and I saw their\nmedals. I think about seven at a green table. And I told you about the bad food we had,\none slice of bread in the morning, one in the evening, and that was [indecipherable], then\nthe line leaves. But once a month we got a package from the Red Cross, and that has a\nsandwich, and that had a little bit of toilet paper, and 1t had a square inch of pure lard.\nAnd they had put some soy sauce in, so we scrape every day a bit of that. But because of\nthat bad food, we had all gotten phlegmones, I don\u2019t know if you know what that --\npeople in the first World War in the ditches in Belgium and France had it. It started as an\nitch, and then you got hives, and then they became so big like strawberries, and you\nalways had them in your face. And your whole face was out of shape, and in the end your\nskin couldn\u2019t hold it any more, and it burst open, and green pus was dripping down. And\nwe all had that on our faces, most of us, and it was terrible. And then it was the fifth\nmonth, I\u2019ve never had shampoo, so can you imagine your hair greasy, just cold water, no\ntowels. And we looked a mess, and we have no mirrors, but you saw how the others -- so\nthere I was sitting with those seven well fed guys across from me, and 15 minutes before,\nI\u2019d wished them all death. And I looked at them, and I thought, there you sit, you seven,\nand you think that you can decide about my life. You can\u2019t even touch a hair of my head\nif God doesn\u2019t let you. And I thought you totally on the wrong side, the -- and actually,\nthe most strange thing, I could feel pity for them. They thought they had it all, and they\nhad nothing. And then they ask -- started asking me questions, but stupid really had done\nso stupid in those months, and I\u2019d never said one gerd of German, one word. So I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d So they called the translator, and he had to sit there,\nthen they asked him the questions, but I knew it already, and then me, so it gave me twice\nthe time to think. And then in the end, the leader -- he had the highest rank, and he was in\nhis 50\u2019s, and he said, \u201cI have done nothing in my life but hearings, and I have developed\na sixth sense,\u201d he says, \u201cand I can\u2019t,\u201d -- and I was so afraid that I had slipped up\nsomewhere, you know, because it was very important. But he said, \u201cI can\u2019t put a pin in\nyour story, [indecipherable],\u201d -- he said, \u201cbut my sixth sense tells me it\u2019s all baloney.\u201d\nAnd I told him, because they said I was early 20, so my father must have been in his 40\u2019s.\nAnd they said, \u201cWhat did your father there?\u201d I thought everywhere before I thought a --\ntaxes. I said, \u201cHe worked for the taxes,\u201d because that\u2019s everywhere, in every country, you\nknow. And then he said, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d I said he died, but of course he must have been\nyoung. He said, \u201c\u201cWhat did he die of?\u201d I said he was bitten by a snake. [indecipherable].\nAnd then they asked me the date, and they have the big Sinter Klass on December five,\nso my father had died on December five. And then, and your mother? She has died, too. I\n-- I felt like I was killing my own parents. And they said, \u201cWhat did she die of?\u201d I said,\n\u2018She had a very weak heart, and when Father was brought home there, she died.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d \u201c10 days later, 15\",\u201d so I thought I could remember that. So they asked all\nquestions, but then in the end they started -- and I heard every word, they started\ndiscussing my case in front of them. And they said, \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t look like a maid, she\nlooks more like a secretary, or a teacher.\u201d And then I heard another one say, \u201cWell, we\ncan check that.\u201d And I thought, how can you ever check -- I -- I had no idea what it was.\nAnd then they brought me -- see, that was the good thing, that I -- that they thought I\ndidn\u2019t know German. And then they brought me a magazine and a pad, and a pencil, and\nsaid, \u201cCopy that.\u201d And I thought -- I think your brains work 200 percent when you\u2019re -- it\nwas life or death again. And I thought, why are they with this? And then it dawned on\nme, when you were a maid, by law you had to go through sixth grade, and then you could\ngo, and mostly you were from poor families, and you were farmed out to a wealthy lady\nwhere -- or couple, that you had to have the etic -- but you don\u2019t write, you write -- and\nwe had one hour, and some schools two hours of penmanship. And if you see those\nclassrooms, the capital A, the small a, the ca -- so that is what your handwriting was\nwhen you leave. But if you\u2019re a secretary, and you take dictation, you start -- so I\nthought, that is the trap they put up for me. So I sat there, and I hold [indecipherable]\nwith my tongue sticking out like it was really unusual work. And then they brought me\nback to the barrack. And then the noise of the a-allies came sh -- all the time closer, and\nthey got more and more nervous. And then I remembered one of the women one time\nsays to me -- I was called Willie. \u201cWillie, if you can choose what day you go out of\nprison, what would you choose?\u201d And I says, \u201cIf I would choose, I want to go in the\nradiant sunshine, when the world looks so happy.\u201d I said, \u201cOn a Saturday morning, and\ntake a soak bath, and shampoo, and take care of all that stuff on my face, clean\nunderwear, clean clothes, and Sunday go to church and thank God for freedom,\u201d I said,\n\u201cwith capital letters. We always take it for granted, but it\u2019s a gift.\u201d I said, \u201cBut if it pours,\nand it\u2019s Monday morning, Ill go too.\u201d And you know, this is so miraculous, two weeks\nlater, on a radiant Saturday morning, I was called out by the Hauptmachtmeisterin, she\nwas the highest, and she was a real mean woman. And she\u2019s, \u201cWillie, you\u2019ll go to\nGermany.\u201d And the little voice here said, \u201cYou\u2019re going home.\u201d And that\u2019s when I put\nthe belt on, and I left sweaters I had with the eight girls, and I knew in my heart I was\ngoing out. And I was let out with another girl, Ansje. And Ansje didn\u2019t know it, but her\nhusband had been executed. And Ansje, when we had to stand at attention, you know,\nhad always fainted the first. And she was married for eight or nine years, and they wanted\nso much to have a baby, and in the camp she found out she was pregnant, so she fainted\nall the time. And her husband didn\u2019t know it, but he had been executed. But when she\nwas let out she didn\u2019t know she was a widow. And they let us out at the total different\ngate than where they had brought us in. And there we stood. And they had been so cruel\nwith many things. They once said to me that I could take a shower in Scheveningen, and\nthen I was there, and I hadn\u2019t had any water -- I mean, that little pail with cold water, and\nwhen I stood there, and I\u2019d undressed, and I wanted to [indecipherable] ready, I\u2019d never\n[indecipherable]. So they did all cruel things to make you happy for something, and\nthey\u2019d -- so we were afraid that the gates would open again and say, \u201cOkay, all a big\nmistake, back in.\u201d\u2019 And we wanted to get away, but we were so [indecipherable] nervous.\nAnd there was nothing. It was a lot of sand, it was very arid, and in the distance were\ntrees but you saw two wheels from a cart, and you saw some horse manure. And this was\nthe end of \u201944, and [indecipherable] our whole country does nothing any more. If you\nsaw a Store, there wouldn\u2019t be a rubber band, there wouldn\u2019t be a paper clip, there\nwouldn\u2019t be anything. And the farmers didn\u2019t get fertilizer, and this is an arid part, so\nthey collected all the manure from their pigs, their chickens, their cows, from everything,\nand it went in a pit, and then they pumped it up, and they put it in the moving cart, and\nspread it over the field, and they did that regularly. So they never scrubbed that cart wi --\nfor a few days later they filled it again. But this was the end of \u201944, so you can -- and we\nsaw -- where we were standing there, and we said, shall we go left or right, we want to\nget away from here, but we didn\u2019t want to walk miles for nothing, you know, so we --\nand then we saw a little dot. We said, \u201cLet\u2019s see what that 1s.\u201d So we started walking, and\nit was a farmer who was going to spread all that manure, and that cart was filled to the\nbrim with you know what, and stinking, and he was walking next to it because there was\na shelf or something, that -- where you could sit on behind the horse, but it was caked on\neverywhere. And he was walking next to his horse. And he\u2019s, \u201cHi girls, you just came out\nof the camp?\u201d And we said yes. And he didn\u2019t know if he should offer us a ride because\nthen we had to sit on that dried stuff. And he said, would you -- would you -- but\n[indecipherable] 1t was a Cadillac, and we said, \u201cYes, please.\u201d He said, \u201cHop on.\u201d And I\nthink that was such a glorious exit out of that prison, and the concentration camp, on the\ntop of a manure cart. And I think like [indecipherable] God in heaven was having a little\nfun, that he had [indecipherable]",
        "A: I -- I really don\u2019t know it, but I think she made me think that she was praying for me, and\nthat I then thought hatred is not really good. It -- you know, I -- to be honest, I hated now\nthe German again, and I had the same problem, it took me months and months. But if you\nstart hating somebody, it eats you.

        "A: Now, I had to do the laundry, because that\u2019s in -- but all the other women had to do\nsomething, and like I say, there was nothing any more in the Netherlands, so all those\nother women had to sit on long tables, that was also the tables where we had to eat, and\non benches, and they had a rusty cup for themself, and 1t was water in it, and they got\nlong strips of brown paper, and you know, when you go shopping, for food shopping,\nthen you get those big brown bags, that type of paper. And they got long strips, and they\nhave to dump that in the water in strips, and then wind it. And they had every day to do\n60 meters [indecipherable] little bit, I think 70 yards or so. And that was then dried, and\nwhen it was dry it was rolled in rolls, and they sold it as twine. And then I was arrested in\nthe train, and I had only the one panty on, I had no other clothes, so one time the elastic\noff my panty broke, and at that time it was -- the elastic was like through a loop, you\nknow -- now they stitch it on, but that wasn\u2019t then. So there I was, and I had no panty. So\nI said to the girls who were making that twine, \u201cCan you bring me some of that?\u201d And I\nwind it, and that\u2019s stiff and hard and I can get it through and tie it. So they did, but they\nbrought me so much. But -- and there was nothing, so that was very precious, and then I\nhad done that with my panty, and I thought what can I do with the rest? And there were\neight girls that I thought they won\u2019t get out, they won\u2019t survive. They were so sick, and\nTB, and everything. That were also the eight that we gave that bread to. And I thought,\nyou know what, I\u2019m going to their parents. I had deep down the feeling one day I will -- I\nhave those crazy fore-feelings, you know? And I had the feeling, you will get out, you\nwill get out. So I asked them where do you live? And I wrote all the eight addresses\ndown, and their names. And then I made it slightly wet, and I wound it, but I had so\nmuch, so I didn\u2019t want to have it just as one -- so then, I think without knowing it, I might\nhave done the first macram\u00e9. And I made this belt, it was in August \u201944, I would say. But\nhow do you close it? So then I did those loops, and one a bit smaller than the other one.\nAnd out of somebody\u2019s socks, we -- I pulled wool, and then -- so when I was let out, I\nhad this around my waist, and I was planning to go to all those eight parents, they lived in\ndifferent cities. But I had all the addresses in my head, so I never had to open it. So this is\nthe real thing. But you know, it\u2019s paper, and now it\u2019s getting too dry. The other day I wet\nit just a little bit, but 1t\u2019s breaking here, and I feel so bad. But really, I think 60 years later,\nit must have bleached up, but the names should still be in here. But I still know several.\nRandy Polner was one of them.",
        "A: Nora Domart, \u201932 Amsterdam, and I went there. And a few years ago, I went back to see\nif her family still lived there, but they didn\u2019t. But there was another guy who did TV like\nyou do, and they were kind of interested.",
        "A: I went to all those parents, and I told where they were, and that we hoped that they make\nit out. But at least you know something then --",
        "A: -- because see, Corrie ten Boom, Corrie and Betsie were -- had the hearing, and then you\nwent to the other camp, and that was much easier. We were not allowed anything. And\nthere Corrie and Betsie [indecipherable] some months you were allowed to write, it was\ncensored, and then some mon-months you were allowed to receive mail. You could\nreceive one package a month. And you had a working day, but when it was over, you\nwere allowed outside in the camps, free to visit others, in other barracks. Now, we were\nnever -- we were now and then marched through a little street, up down, up down, that\nwas all -- and then back, because we were really the ones who hadn\u2019t had a hearing. And\nI did another terrible thing, that Hanny Janssen, the traitor, I heard from somebody --\nyeah, I have to tell this too, because it\u2019s really hilarious. I heard that she was really a\nprostitute, and she had started an affair with one of those SS\u2019s on the corner, a young,\nhandsome guy, Hans. And somebody told me, \u201cHanny climbs out of the barrack late, out\nof window, and then she\u2019s the whole night with this Hans, [indecipherable] and then\ntowards the morning she climbs back.\u201d And then -- and she was a prisoner, and we had to\nstand appel. And then they came back, and the man in charge of the appel -- you had the\nweek that you were the stubealteste, that\u2019s the outchder from the -- in time then. So one\ntime it was my turn to be stubealteste, and [indecipherable] I have a real mean streak in\nme, and I\u2019m not sorry for it. And anyway, when I heard that, I said to the girl who told\nme, I said, I know something. So then when it was my turn in the morning to tell the\nguards who locked us up and went away then by that time, they weren\u2019t day and night\nwith us any more, but the guards were there. And I locked all the windows from the\nbarrack. And Hanny wanted to climb in in the morning, and she couldn\u2019t, there was no\nwindow open. And then she had to disappear in the woods, because, you know, she\n[indecipherable] missing, but she was a prisoner. So then -- and they all thought that I\nwas so stupid, so then the guards came in and they had to say hundred sev -- 185\nprisoners, eight in bed, and so many. And then you had to say who were sick or new sick\nones. And I said -- and I did real stupid, I said, \u201cI know there should be 175 women, but I\ncan only count 174, but I\u2019m probably wrong.\u201d But they started counting, and she was\nmissing. And then it was daylight, so she couldn\u2019t come back. And then oh, there was --\nand she was missing. And then later, the rumor went Hanny Janssen had tried to escape,\nbut that wasn\u2019t true, and she had to go a month to the bunker, so we were a month\nwithout her, and she never knew who -- but then after the war, two guys from the -- from\nthe ger -- from our police came when I was studying nursing, and they came to the\nhospital where I worked, and they were from the -- the political police, you know, who\nwere checking on all traitors. And they said, \u201cYou were in Vught, did you know a girl by\nthe name of Hanny Janssen?\u201d I said yes. \u201cWhat did you think of her?\u201d I said, \u201cI think she\nwas a spy.\u201d \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause with -- she was called out all the\ntime, she was never nervous, she had a tan when she came back. She was very talkative,\nso she had had wine or beer.\u201d And I said, \u201cI had just drawn my own conclusion.\u201d And I\ntold what I had done. And then they told me it was true. But they told me that she was in\nRotterdam a prostitute for the very high Germans, and they had uniforms, and the top\nofficers went to her. And England found that out, and then they asked -- and there were a\nlot of volunteers, and like a son of a consul, or an ambassador who grew up in Germany,\nwas fluent in German, and went to school, they probably spoke the dialect. And they\nfound one guy who was willing to take a very high imitated German uniform, and they\ndropped him off over the Netherlands in the night, out of the plane, he had to jump. And\nhe had to worm his way into her circle of friends, and he did. And in the end he became\nengaged to her. But he was very broadminded, she could see her other friends, and in bed\nshe got so many secrets from -- and he asked questions, general, you know. And she\nfound it out, and that went all back to England, till one day -- 1t was such a secret that\nthey had to narrow it down and it pointed to her. But England had more on this guy, so he\ndisappeared, her fianc\u00e9 disappeared. But then the Germans were with a terrible problem,\nwas she really pro-German and a victim, what she was, or was she planted by England?\nSo they didn\u2019t know what to do with her, so they put -- I don\u2019t know if they asked me to,\nso I think that she --",
        "A: Pardon me?",

        "A: -- and I think that she had a long prison term.",
        "A: The camp?",
        "A: I went -- first of all to The Hague, and I went to close friends of my parents, we played\nbridge or something once a week. And I wanted to know if they were still alive. But they\nlived far away from where my parents, quite a distance. And I thought, you know, that\nmy parents -- they were so wise, because so many people in the underground were\narrested, that a friend saw them and said I\u2019ve seen so and so, and that week -- and then\nthe person was arrested. Because friends who thought it was interesting to say when they\nwere looking for you, I\u2019ve seen them. And I rang the bell there, and I thought they say,\n\u201cHi Diet, there you are, and your parents don\u2019t know.\u201d Because I had disappeared, they\nnever got those notes any more. And they s -- \u201cHi, I am here.\u201d And nothing exciting. And\nI said, \u201cHow are father and mother?\u201d They said fine. And then I said, \u201c come out of\nVught.\u201d My parents had given the story that I was -- I had my wedding license, and my --\nand I didn\u2019t know how to boil a potato, and Hein had 10 kids there in that family. My\nparents had all the time said when there is -- where is Diet, where is Diet, she -- \u201cOh, she\ndoesn\u2019t know anything about the household and she\u2019s learning it at Hein\u2019s parents that\nshe knows the household. So they did not know it. And then I told them, and they went to\nmy parent\u2019s house. And then I did the dangerous thing. We lived very close to a corner,\nbut in our street were a few Nazis. And I said, \u201cOh, I want to see my parents.\u201d You know,\nI really thought they might have been shot, so I wanted to see them. [indecipherable],\n\u201cCan you go to our parent\u2019s house, and tell them to leave the door open, and then I go on\nthe corner, and I look. If nobody is there, and I shoot in the house.\u201d And that\u2019s what\nhappened. And then Mom was so happy, because they had really thought I was dead, they\nhadn\u2019t heard. And when -- she was helping, I told you, the baker and the milkman came\nto the house always, and she was just helping the milkman, and then my father came\nhome, but she didn\u2019t want to say Diet is home, you know, because that was dangerous. So\nmy father walks in, and I had -- we had kind of a long house at that time, so I had -- when\nthe doorbell rang, I had gone to the back, because then if there was danger, I would climb\nover the wall from the rosebushes, and in an alley disappear. So I was in the back. And\nthen my father came to the back, and he sees me, and he turns around, and walks in a side\nroom. And oh, he is furious at me that I caused him so much trouble. So I followed him,\nand that was the first time in my life I saw him crying. And he was so happy. So then I\nstayed only till it was dark, and then I left, and found the underground. And then I went\nto all the guys, to Aalt and Alie, and Ab had been arrested. No, Ab at that time hadn\u2019t yet\nbeen arrested, the other leader. And I went also to my sister and her husband. So I went to\nall, and then they said we need you, so many have been a -- arrested. And then a guy, this\n[indecipherable] troop was also helping, because so many were arrested. And that -- tho -\n- they were more in, really, you know, munition things and so. And one of them, a spy\nhad to go all the time on dangerous missions. And it was -- we had -- he has false papers.\nBut it was safer if he had a woman with him, so we had false papers that I was his wife,\nand then he prin -- it tell you that we were daily laborers, and helping with farms. So I\nwent many times with him over the rivers, and through territory where you really weren\u2019t\nallowed, but that we say we have to work for that farmer, and showed our false papers,\nand so -- and then he was really in spying, so he asked. \u201cCan you work for us while you\nwalk from The Hague to Amster-Amsterdam?\u201d I saw troop movements and everything,\nand where they are building fort and quarters, and so then that\u2019s that stuff that they gave\nme for instructions, and I did that till the end of the war.",
        "A: I did too, in between.",

So he disappeared -- he disappeared and went in hiding.\nAnd Ab was arrested, that Ab also had heard the other leader that they were going to\narrest him, because you\u2019ve got mostly warned by the good police, and he went to warn\nhim. But the guy, Dries Klooster had already disappeared and gone in hiding. And just\nwhen Ab was there to warn Dries, the police came, and he was arrested.",
        "A: And he never came back.",
        "A: And the sad case was with Klooster, and that was another question mark to God. I mean,\nhe was hiding at the farm, in the little village, it\u2019s really a -- a settlement, was called\n[indecipherable] one, two, three. And when the allies came, and that were in this case the\nCanadians, they came from the east, after the battle of Ironham, and the whole thing, and\nthen they were marching up. And they wanted to cut off the Germans, and they marched\nup, and then they were really shelling. When they want to advance, they shell, so we said\nthree days and was shell fire in the -- I was with Aalt and Alie at that farm, and Dries was\nnot too far, maybe a few kilometers, but the shells were falling everywhere. And one\nshell hit that farm.",

        "A: April 20. And the rest of the country was later, but we were really by fighting. When I\ncame out after three day, you -- you thought day and night you heard the shells fall, and\nthat was so horrible, boom, boom, boom, and you didn\u2019t know if it would be on your\nroof, and that it would hit you. And we don\u2019t have big basements because we are such a\nwater country, if you go a bit deeper, you\u2019re in the water. So we sat there, and then after\nthree days and three nights it was quiet, and that was even spookier than when it got all\nabsolute quiet. And you know, like Noah, that we let a dove out to see, and somebody\nhad to go out, what happened. And the Jewish people couldn\u2019t go, and the farmer and his\nwife and two little babies, and she was pregnant, she couldn\u2019t go, and the -- so I felt I was\nthe one who had to go, and I came out, and on the road in the distance, I saw all tanks,\nand that were the allies, the Canadians. Oh, and it -- and I ran towards them, but then I\nthought, no, that is selfish, I have to go back to the farm, the Jews had been all the time,\nyears in that little room that they can -- and I turn around, and we have so much water, so\nthere was kind of a small river, and it had all those weeping willows. And I had heard that\nin Italy more allies died by snipers than really in battle. And when I ran back to the farm,\nI see three Germans in camouflage in the water, and there\u2019s no -- their daggers between\ntheir teeth, and their guns up, and they were walking away from the allies, under the\nweeping willows. And they saw that I had seen them, and I thought, oh my goodness,\nthey are not planning to surrender, otherwise they would have gone the other way. So I\nwent -- I went back, I thought, now I have to go to the allies, but I was afraid that they\nwould shoot me in my back. I zigzagged to tho -- to those Canadian tanks and I said,\n\u201cThere are snipers.\u201d And they turned around, and then they went there, three tanks, and\neach took one of the Germans like -- really like [indecipherable], and then I said there\nthey are.

        "A: But if we knew that a thing was getting unsafe, we had -- you know, there was one -- you\nknow, Esso, that is that very wealthy oil -- a son of them, Hans von Esso, and his sister\nAlie, and I was somewhere, and this Hans from Esso came to us for an address. And I\nnever forget, I was at Yen, that was another one of our group in The Hague, and he saw\nme, and Yen said she brings all the Jewish people to the -- to [indecipherable] to that\narea. And he stuck his hands in his pockets, and he held it out, and it was full with\ndiamond and emeralds, and he, \u201cPlease, find me a place.\u201d I said, \u201cYou can put that away,\nthat doesn\u2019t do anything. I help -- the forest and whatever, if we find a place.\u201d And then -\n- but this was so far in the war, I think they had been somewhere else, where it wasn\u2019t\nsafe, and he had real trouble finding a place. And then he found something, but he asked\nfor his sister Alie, she was beautiful, and younger than he was. And we found a place at\nthis very poor farm, so poor, it was really the married daughter of the farmer where we\nhad Herman. And she was a sloppy household, where they had a bunch of babies. And\nyou know she was -- so that was the only place, and it was so poor, and she had to sleep\nin the hay. And Rosa was at that time at an address [indecipherable] safe, so Rosa was\nthere, too, and Rosa got scabies, you know, that\u2019s really from dirt. And Alie got it too.\nAnd Rosa went to -- back to Arlington when it was safe, and there she was, you know,\nbath and what -- boil the clothes, and so -- but Alie couldn\u2019t take it any more because\nRosa told me later, she said, \u201cThat wife of that farmer was so filthy,\u201d they had on the\ntable a piece of oilcloth or something, and then she said, \u201cthat\u2019s where we had to eat, they\ndidn\u2019t have any tablecloth,\u201d or whatever. So -- but she changed the dirty diaper of the\nbaby there too, on that table, and sometimes didn\u2019t clean, so it was a filthy house. And\nthen Alie, who came from such a wealthy family, and probably had lots of servants, she\ncouldn\u2019t hack it any more, and she went back into her other [indecipherable] and she was\narrested, and she was killed. And I think oh, that poor Allie, if she had only had held out,\nyou know.",
        "A: Because the camps might have been just as dirty. Hans came through [indecipherable].\nNo, we were very fortunate.",
        "A: I have to look at it this way. We were four, really five years in this war, and if you think\nthat more then two and a half year, every month we had to do those robberies. And they\nwere only once [indecipherable] and you always prayed beforehand if God would protect\neverybody, also the enemy, where the Dutch people were [indecipherable] and I think\nGod is almighty, and Hein was killed in the end of January \u00b045, the war was over. I was\nfree in April [indecipherable] I just know that God [indecipherable] have protect\n[indecipherable]. So I figured -- and so many didn\u2019t come back, and I was spared three\ntimes that I thought this is the end, when I were driven in the dunes, when I had my\nhearing, when I was arrested with all that stuff. So then, I think God still has something\nfor me to do, and I have to find it. And now that I look back I see it, because it\u2019s telling\nthe young people in the universities, and you don\u2019t know a thing here in America. I had\nto speak for Yad-Vashem, I got [indecipherable] later from -- and I met that rabbi, what\u2019s\nhis name? Mordechai Paldiel, have you heard his name?",
        "A: And I mean, he is -- really became a friend of mine. And then they asked me to speak for\nYad-Vashem as a fundraiser, they want to build the school next to the museum, and they\ninvited in, I\u2019d learned, a very wealthy [indecipherable] a very wealthy Jewish people, and\nI had to speak, and then they all got a book, and need to write a fat check, and so on. But\nI mean, I met them, and I think well, I have a purpose, you know? And they say, go along\nwith -- tell, tell, tell, and that\u2019s what I do. And they do that now with teachers, that they\nover the whole world make [indecipherable], and there was in Canton, in Ohio, there is\nMalone College, that\u2019s a liberal arts, Malone College, and there\u2019s a large Jewish group,\nand they ask me -- they started -- I think that\u2019s now about eight years ago, in the summer\nwhen the college is closed, they have a week long that it\u2019s a whole Holocaust week. And\nthe rabbis, and the people [indecipherable] they had then one survivor of Auschwitz, an\nold man, and they had a Jewish lady who was hiding, a Polish Jewish lady. They had the\nPolish lady who had taken Jews in, and they wanted me then to come, and I\n[indecipherable] the whole week, and you know, I was really surprised. The first year\nthey told me they had 12 people, and now there were 45, so this was the third year, and\nnow I hope it grows. But those teachers, that is good, they go back to their schools and\ntalk. Because I -- one lady there, they asked -- I mean, she says, \u201cWhen I was in college,\nmy prof told me the Holocaust never happened, and it\u2019s a sob story that the Jewish people\ndo just to get pity.\u201d So can you imagine that you say that to a class of students? So I feel I\nhave to go. I have to go and then like I was those 10 years in Venezuela, that was a\nhealing time away from everything, no talking about it, nothing. Because when my\nfriends from Venezuela, we only 18 Dutch families, and I knew them all because those\nwomen married mostly, they ha -- they were engaged, and then they got this great job\nafter the war from Shell, so they quick got married and they had their first baby their, and\nthe doctors only spoke Spanish, and they were scared stiff, because [indecipherable] they\nwere expecting their first baby, so I was called out for every delivery, and they all\nbecame my friends, and they were like brothers and sisters. And I still have contact with\nthem. But you know, that was such a healing time, and I never talked about the war. And\nthen when the book came out later, they said, \u201c\u201cWe were 10 years with you, and you never\nsaid it.\u201d But I think that was the good thing that I was away from all memories there.\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10",
        "A: Well, his father -- of course we weren\u2019t married, he got a notice from the Red Cross, and\nthat notice said that he had died in Dachau on March nine. So he let me know, and I right\naway said, \u201cIf he has died, 1t was January 20.\u201d And the father really got angry with me,\nbut that was the night I couldn\u2019t sleep, and that I was pacing that big room at that farm.\nAnd I had to sleep in a double bed with a girl in her -- a few years older than I was, if I\nslept there. And it was so cold, and there was no heating, and she said, \u201cWillie, come in\nin bed, it\u2019s so cold.\u201d And I said to her, \u201cThere is something with Hein,\u201d it was that\nhorrible feeling again that I got. I said, \u201c\u201cWhat is today the date?\u201d She said, \u201cJanuary 20.\u201d\nI said, \u201cWhen he comes back, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very, very sick, and that I have to ask him if\nhe was sick.\u201d And that was the night he died, and I heard that later. And the Red Cross\nsay nine, but when other people were let out, some survivors and they -- I -- I me -- I met\nthem, and they said Hein was taken out of the barrack on January 20 in the evening, and\nnever came back. But he was very weak, and he had [indecipherable] where you couldn\u2019t\nwork any more, So --",
        "A: It was terrible, and I know that I made it so difficult for the guy who came to tell me.\nThat was the father of one of those guys that Henk had mentioned to me [indecipherable]\nwas arrested, Dekker was his last name, and he was in the town hall, or town city, or\nsomething in -- in Eindhorf also, and he had to go to The Hague, and Hein\u2019s father wrote\nme the letter that Hein had died. And I was so happy that we were free, and this terrible --\nand the Jewish people could come back, but there was also a fear, there were too many in\nGermany, who comes back, who co -- doesn\u2019t come back. So you were mixed, you didn\u2019t\ndare to be really happy because you didn\u2019t know anything. And then this man came back\nand rang the bell, and I opened the door, and I said, \u201cOh, Mr. Dekker,\u201d and his son had\ncome back, and I said, \u201cHow nice to see you.\u201d I said, \u201cOh how wonderful that we are free\nand now waiting for our guys to come back.\u201d And I was so bubbly. And then he said to\nme, \u201cYeah, but some won\u2019t come back.\u201d And so he wanted to push me a bit down, you\nknow, and I -- yeah but -- and I was just bubbling, and then I got that letter. It was\nterrible, I don\u2019t know if I --",
        "A: But then -- very -- remember very little, I was in a daze.",
        "A: I expected --",
        "A: [indecipherable] and I nearly -- I don\u2019t know how well you know the Torah and the\nBible, but you know, Abraham was asked to sacrifice Isaac, and I thought maybe this is\nthe sacrifice that God asks me, but I know I didn\u2019t want to live any more, because then,\nfrom our group of 15, eight were killed, so more than half I thought I didn\u2019t want to live\nany more. I said, \u201cLord, why didn\u2019t you take me too, I don\u2019t want to live any more.\u201d But\nthen slowly but surely, you -- it -- that you have always a task for you. Oh, it was terrible.\nAnd then Ab was killed --",
        "A: And Hergen Feesler was killed, the man who took the picture when we are hugging, that\nhe wanted to. But Herg was very brave, he -- now allies were coming, and the Germans\nhad mined a bridge, and thought if they come over, we let it go in the air. And Herg knew\nthat, and then the allies were real close, he ran through that bridge, and he cut all the\nwires on the explosion, and he was shot, and he also gave his life, he was brave.",
        "A: Write it?",
        "A: I would --",
        "A: I think it was harder to stay alive. I think it would be the easier to die.",
        "A: I went through such terrible things, because when I was let out of the camp, I didn\u2019t want\nin any way that they knew I had been in prison. And I had smuggled a note out with this\ngirl whose husband had been shot, tortured, and I had said don\u2019t ask me any questions,\nbut I knew her husband had been executed, so she was okay, she was not [indecipherable]\nand she lived in a suburb of The Hague. So I said, please go to [indecipherable] this note,\nask anything. If you see that there is Gestapo around, pretend that you are collecting for\nthe winter help, that was from the Germans. I said, \u201cBut if you get to see, tell that Willie\nis in Vught, and that they may not do anything to try to get me out,\u201d because I was\ncreating this image from the stupid girl --",
        "A: And I -- and too, the guys, the underground was trying like to [indecipherable] to bribe a\nbig -- they were saving thousands of guilders to get me out, right? But that would have\nruined my whole story, because --",
        "A: -- then I was important if they give so much money. So she did that. Then my parents\nknew where I was. But I -- I told also in that message, and let the guys never do -- and let\nHein not know that I am also in prison, because it was such a torture when somebody you\nlove dearly -- I think with children, too, if your children suffer, you want to suffer\nyourself, but not them. And that\u2019s how I felt with Hein, and I thought, oh, that was one of\nthe cruel things that guy did, the -- the German. I had told him, I\u2019Il bring you everywhere,\ndrive me, but there are two places in this world where I never want to go, and that is the\nconcentration camp Amersfoort, because Hein was terrible tortured there. And it\u2019s right\nin the middle where we hid all -- I\u2019ve thousand times passed it, but I don\u2019t want to go\nthere, what for? To cry? Then to think of all the suffering, and the horror, he was killed.\nAnd I\u2019ve three times passed the road that it says kil -- three kilometers [indecipherable]\nand I never go in, I don\u2019t want to. And this guy drove me the last day he went off th -- he\nwent many times off the track, and I said you\u2019re going wrong, you\u2019re going wrong.\n[indecipherable] and the last day I couldn\u2019t -- I was so happy it was over, he was a\nmiserable guy. And then he turns off the road, and he come in the woods, and I had no\nidea. I said Martin [indecipherable] straight ahead today. And he come in the woods, and\nhe stops at the building, says here we are. I had no idea where we were, and the -- then 1s\nthe sound guy and the camera man were there, and they [indecipherable] me up. And\nMartin starts on the new path, slightly up, and I follow, and I see the sign, the place of\nexecution of that horrible camp. Now, is that cruelty?",
        "A: Where I told him --",
        "A: And I was so furious, I said, \u201cWhat a creep you are.\u201d I said, \u201cI told you this is the place,\u201d\nI said, \u201cI\u2019m 82, I can decide.\u201d And I did not -- I said, \u201cI have no words for you.\u201d And I\nturned around and I walked away. And then the sound guy, who had always disconnected\n[indecipherable] an-and the camera man, they said that they have left this on, that the TV\nstation knows what he did.",
        "A: No, I --",
        "A: I can, yeah.\u201d It is still very unexpected,\u201d -- it\u2019s so small -- \u201cr-really, they didn\u2019t count on\nthis any more. I am happy that they have left the camp Amersfoort,\u201d -- so he must have\nsuffered there -- \u201cand yesterday\u201d -- you see, it\u2019s so small and my eyes are --",
        "A: Oh that\u2019s better, yeah.",
        "A: \u201cYesterday, about nine in the evening we left, and now it\u2019s seven in the morning. We just\npassed Rijssen,\u201d and that is the last city in the Netherlands. \u201cI think that trip will be quite\nlong. Darling, don\u2019t count on seeing each other again soon. I have the feeling that it will\ntake at least a year. But we are with friends here altogether, and you will soon be in free\ncountry, so we have many reasons to be optimistic. And here we see again that we do not\ndecide our lives. Dieneke,\u201d -- that was his nickname for me -- \u201ceven if we won\u2019t see each\nother on earth again, we will never be sorry for what we did, and that we took this stand.\nAnd know, Diet, that of every last human being in this world, I loved you the most. And\nit\u2019s still my great desire that we be -- will become a happy family someday.\u201d And then he\nends with the words, \u201cOmnia vincit amor.\u201d That is Latin for love conquers all. And you\nknow, when we got engaged, it was on the tram in Amsterdam. We had our rings, and --\nbecause we had ordered our rings, and what we wanted engraved. And then he came\nhome, there was a manila envelope and he was on list to go to England, and then he\nfound that manila envelope, and he said, \u201cDiet, these are my instructions to go to\nEngland,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have to leave right away,\u201d and it was a Saturday afternoon, we\nhad just ordered our rings and what we wanted inscribed, and he said, \u201cAnd I may not tell\nyou where I go and what I do, but I go tonight to England.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you remember,\u201d\n-- | didn\u2019t know Amsterdam [indecipherable] he said, \u201cDo you remember where we\nordered the rings?\u201d I said [indecipherable]. He said, \u201c\u201cGo there, pick them up,\u201d -- he had\npaid for it and for the engraving, he says -- and there was a tramway that go to the main\nstation, the central station, and it was line two. He says -- and the tram mostly had three\nor two or three carriages, and there was a balcony that was open where you step on, and\nthen you went inside. And he said, \u201cHop on the last balcony of the last car, and then after\ntwo stops, I\u2019ll hop on too. I have to ta -- get a few things.\u201d So I ran to that store, and I got\nour rings and the guy said, \u201cI haven\u2019t engraved,\u201d I said, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d So I hopped on\nthe tram, on the last cart, and two stops later he came, and he gave me his ring, and I gave\nhim my ring, and that was our engagement, on the back balcony of the -- and then we had\nit engraved later, it -- he was in very big danger, it was a dangerous trip, and he never got\nto England. But at that time, in the beginning we thought that\u2019s where you can be useful -",
        "A: -- but later those people were bored stiff, we could do much more. But then we have\nengaged on the [indecipherable] and his name and the morning, it was another\npremonition, the morning -- the day that I was arrested -- I had always that ring on, and I\ntook it off, and I said to Alie from the farm, I said, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be arrested.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cWillie, you are nervous, and,\u201d -- Hein had just been arrested then, maybe. I said, \u201cI\nknow I\u2019m nervous,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I have such a strong feeling that I\u2019ll be arrested today.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWill you take this ring till after 1 come back,\u201d because his name was in the\nring, and so then they could say it was Hein. So I gave her the ring, and it was really\nfunny, because I had all white underwear, but I had se -- one set black, and I thought\nwhen you are in prison, and you can\u2019t wash it, and it gets dirtier and dirtier, it -- I thought\nPll put my black one on, it get also dirty, but you don\u2019t see it. I put my black underwear\non, and I knitted [indecipherable] with the cable stitch, and I thought that is nice and\nsolid, and that\u2019s how I went on that trip, and on that trip I was arrested. Strange, huh? I\u2019m\nalways scared when I get that feeling.",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "A: I tell you, I saw -- I never go to war movies, but I saw \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d because I heard\nhe changed later. But he started with wanting cheap labor. And I sat there, and I cried the\nwhole film, and long times I closed my eye [indecipherable] hated Hitler, and the\nswastika, and that wolfs angel and those hated uniforms, and all. And I had a horrible\ntime, but I wanted to see it, and in the end Schindler\u2019s changed because he -- later he\u2019s\nvery sorry that he didn\u2019t save more. And when I walked out of that theater, the only thing\nI said, \u201cThank you God, I did something.\u201d Because I thought, if now I would have seen\nthat movie, I thought you were there. You were young, but you were an adult, 20 year a --\nan adult. And I thought, you were there, and this happened all around you, and you didn\u2019t\ndo anything. I don\u2019t know if I -- and that\u2019s what I tell the young people, I said, \u201cMake the\nright choices,\u201d I said, because -- and I tell them this, I said, \u201cIf I now -- you can\u2019t go back\nand do it over.\u201d",
        "A: \u201cYou have at that moment,\u201d and I said, and that ma -- may [indecipherable] during the\n[indecipherable] and I says, \u201cWhatever your religion have -- you have, you have\nguidelines.\u201d I say, \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have a religion, you have a little voice in your heart,\nand you listen to that.\u201d It\u2019s the only way that you can in the morning when you brush\nyour teeth look in the mirror and not despise yourself. No, I never [indecipherable]. And\nto be honest, spiritually it was the closest time to God, because He was all I had.",
        "A: Yeah. I think I\u2019ve had a very wonderful, rich, life, and not always the things that you\nchoose, but I asked for it, I really did. Not a dull life, so --",
        "A: It\u2019s good to be here, because you keep this for hundred and 200 years later --",
        "A: -- so then people will know, and it\u2019s good that you have eyewitnesses, because hearsay 1s\nnever the same.",
