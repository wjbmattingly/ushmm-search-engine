        "Question: Good morning.",
        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fanny\nAizenberg on April 21\u201c, 2011. And Fanny, first of all, I \u2014 like I do on every\ninterview, I would like to thank you for giving our \u2014 your time today to speak with\nus. But unlike every interview that we do, where normally I ask \u2014 and I will be\nasking this later, I usually ask someone to start at the beginning, where were they\nborn, what was their family like, who were their mother and father and so on. All of\nthese things are very important. But Id like to start ours in a little different way,\nbecause before we started the \u2014 the interview itself, we were talking about the\nprocess of it, and you were ac \u2014 you were telling me about some of the reservations\nthat you had. So I\u2019d like to talk about that a little bit, about what 1s it like to speak\nwith someone about these experiences that we are going to be talking about today. If\nyou could share some of those thoughts with me.",
        "A: For me it\u2019s very difficult to talk publicly, because of many reasons. I have heard\nmany wonderful speakers here at the museum, but all those people have been single\npeople when the war started. I already had a child, and I already had responsibilities.\nApril 21, 2011\nAnd we \u2014 it started out scary enough, and my biggest problem also is, after so many\nyears, I\u2019m still living with the horrors I lived through in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So, in other words, every time you talk, there\u2019s a cost, there\u2019s a cost.",
        "A: Absu-absolutely right. Of course it is. Even today, which is so many years later,\nwhen I\u2019m in a car, and I pass where there\u2019s a railroad, I still break out in a sweat,\nwhich 1s not the polit \u2014 polite way of saying. Because we had been for so long in the\ncattle train and I don\u2019t think anybody has ever been able to find words what it was\nfor three days and three nights, for 110 people, including babies, in a cattle train.\nThe prayers, the screams, especially from babies, is just indescribable, at least I\ncannot find the words fer \u2014 to describe such unhuman things.",
        "Q: Do you think \u2014",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t know what was waiting for us at that time.",
        "Q: Were there \u2014 were there many years when you didn\u2019t speak about your life at all\nin \u2014 about this \u2014 these aspects of your life?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve only start \u2014 what is it, Steven, 10 years?\nS: Ten years ago.",
        "Q: Fanny is talking to Steven Vitto who is [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, when he was always \u2014 and I was very lucky that my job was to sit with\nSteven, because of his kindness, of his generosity and caring. Don\u2019t forget, Steven,\nnot because he\u2019s a young person, we are from such a different background and we\nApril 21, 2011\nused to have conversations, like one human being should be fortunate to have with\nanother one.",
        "Q: Tell me of \u2014 tell me a little bit about this, this 1s \u2014 you started as a volunteer here\nat the museum, 1s this what you\u2019re talking about?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how is it \u2014 and what was Steve\u2019s job? What was his way of meeting you?\nWhat was \u2014 how did your interactions start?",
        "A: Well, it really started that I saw in \u201cThe Jewish Week,\u201d which is a small\nmagazine \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 advertised that the Holocaust Museum needs volunteers. And one way or\nanother, I was debating for a long, long time, and there\u2019s a lot of things which I\ndidn\u2019t care for to come here. And I have decided I want to come and see what it 1s.\nAnd I am \u2014 was interview by somebody, which we connected very nicely. Her name\nis Jill and I don\u2019t -- Coynburg(ph) or Cohenberg(ph), I don\u2019t remember her name.\nAnd somehow, we had a conversation that we understand each other. She said, look\nFanny, you could start here right now, or you could wait for about two months\nwhen we have a orientation. And I knew that if I would wait for an orientation, I\nwould never come back.",
        "Q: You knew yourself well then \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: So she say you could do \u2014 yes, I could change my mind. I had many reasons for\nnot wanting to come, like I had many reasons to do come.",
        "Q: What were some of the reasons for not wanting to come?",
        "A: There\u2019s a lot of things I didn\u2019t agree the way the things were working here. So I\nhad the choice and I did not wait to be oriented. I felt I had been oriented a lot,\nthrough the time I was \u2014 the Germans occupied Belgium and being in Auschwitz,\nthat was enough orientation. Anyway, I was very, very fortunate, I met Steven, and\nimmediately we connected very nicely. At the same time, I was translating a book\nfrom Belgium, who just came out. This was a no \u2014 official book, how many\ntransports they had from [indecipherable] how many people in each transport, how\nmany people made into camp. What many people didn\u2019t know, that many trains had\ngas and people were gassed in that train before they even got to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So as you were coming to \u2014 to work at the museum as a volunteer, you were also\ntranslating this book at the same time?",
        "A: Yes, bes \u2014",
        "Q: I'd like to stop \u2014 excuse me inter \u2014 for interrupting you Fanny, I'd like to bring\nSteve into this shot a little bit. Can we do that? Is there a way for Steve to stand\nright here?\nQ2: Now, you want a two shot, I take it?",
        "Q: This looks like \u2014 this is two people in one shot?\nApril 21, 2011\nQ2: This is a two shot.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a two shot \u2014\nQ2: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 yes, at this \u2014 while Steve is in the frame, then yes.\nQ2: Keep it on the two shot?",
        "Q: Yeah, keep it on the two shot, okay.\nQ2: Okay, that sounds good. All-righty-roo.",
        "Q: We\u2019re ready?\nQ2: We\u2019re all set now, uh-huh.",
        "Q: Okay. Id like to introduce Steve Vitto to our conversation, Fanny, and I\u2019d like\nSteve to explain a little bit about what his job was here, and how it is that the two of\nyou met and interacted. So Steve, tell me a little bit about what you do, and how it is\nthat your \u2014 your path with Fanny\u2019s crossed.\nS: I work in a department that was then called the Holocaust S-Survivors Registry.\nWe\u2019 ve since expanded, now we\u2019re called the Holocaust Survivors and Victims\nResource Center. And my job then and my job now 1s to ensure that the individual\nexperiences of Holocaust survivors are first recorded in our survivors registry and\nthen made available to people who are asking about them. So I bridge the gap\nbetween researching archives, but always interacting with the public in s \u2014 to find\nApril 21, 2011\nout what happened to an individual and to help ensure that an individual\u2019s\nexperience in the Holocaust is recorded in some way.",
        "Q: By recorded, do you mean put in a database, or do you mean that like we\u2019re\ndoing an interview with Fanny right now?\nS: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which 1s\nsurvivors or their families providing that information to us, since most people who\nwent through the Holocaust did not have documentation of that experience. So, to\nfill in that gap, we want people to come to us and provide that information that\u2019s\notherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can\nthen be accessed by people coming through the museum, or calling us or writing me\nfor that information. That\u2019s one particular database and since then we also work with\nmany other databases, including oral history collections, more online databases,\ndigitized and also scanned image databases.",
        "Q: So tell me about how it is that Fanny and you first met.\nS: Well, we work in a registry, we work with su-survivor volunteers who come to us\nand they\u2019re very important, not only in giving us their testimony, but in helping us to\narrange, put in data, to scan images and to help us 1n a variety of ways. And so\nFanny came to me as a volunteer from \u2014 she had mentioned our volunteer\ncoordinator, Jill Weinberg, and Fanny was able to do several \u2014 working with\ncomputers, she was able to pick up using our survivors registry. And we often get\nApril 21, 2011\nrequests not only for individual information, but information based on place. So for\ninstance, all the people who were from \u2014 in Theresienstadt for instance,\nconcentration camp, or from a particular town, or share a ca \u2014 particular experience,\nand with our database, we\u2019re able to push a few buttons and so we can get not only a\nlist of individuals, but individuals from a particular place. And I had a particular\nrequest for people who were \u2014 somebody wanted information from those who were\nin Theresienstadt, who were registered with us. And Fanny was able to help me to\n\u2014I could set her up and so she could look through this list and produce it so that I\ncould filter it a little bit and provide that information to another individual. That was\none database. The other infor \u2014 information \u2014 the other job she had was, since\nFanny speaks Belgian, we have a book that\u2019s a list of the deportations that took\nplace in Belgium. And this particular collection is based on date, date of convoy\nonly. And also, it was producing. It was Belgian, so it was in Belgian.",
        "Q: Excuse me. I think in Belgium we have French and Flemish, as \u2014 as languages,\nSO \u2014\nS: Right.",
        "Q: So which language was it, of those two?\nS: This is in French, okay, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.",
        "Q: It was in French, okay, sorry.\nApril 21, 2011\nS: But because of Fanny\u2019s background in Belgium, I thought it would be a good fit,\nand this \u2014 this information was in French, and Fanny looked through that. And\nbefore each \u2014 it\u2019s divided by convoys, before each name list of those on the convoys\nis a description of that convoy, and \u2014 in French. And Fanny was able to translate\nthose introductions, so that now people could not only look up the names of those\nwho were on those transports, but they could also read, in English now, that general\ndescription of that transport.",
        "Q: But cle \u2014 thank you, Steve, because I \u2014 I \u2014 I think we needed to get a sense of\nwhat was the structure of the volunteer program, but clearly something much more\nhappened. This was the specific job, the specific task, but when you met, something\nmuch more happened between you. And Fanny, can you tell me what it is that you f\n\u2014 that you felt and that was an ongoing thing over the past several years?",
        "A: Because mainly, little by little, I was telling Steven my background and my\nstory. And he was kind, very tolerant, and listening. Also, when we got the book\nfrom Belgium, further descriptions, the number of trains, the number of people in\nthe trains and how many transport, at the same time the museum got a book called\n\u201cThe Hidden Heroes.\u201d That book was written by a German reporter. She is from\nGermany. She tried to interview peop \u2014 Jewish people in Germany and nobody\nwanted to give her any information. Somehow, she was so determined, she came to\nBelgium and she got the real information, with the names of the people from the\nApril 21, 2011\nunderground. The underground, the resistance, they were also called the solidarity,\nand they have pictures right here from that. So that book, and the one I was\ntranslating made more sense because you could put the two and two together. And\nthat book wasn\u2019t selling too well, and they had \u2014 she had to change the title, to \u201cThe\n20 Transport.\u201d And what makes it so interesting, that in the book, in that what\nmade in Belgium more people survive, because the underground, Jewish people,\nnon-Jewish people, any kind of people were just one group. Where in France they\nhad a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the\nsame thing has happened in Holland. And this is why in Belgium only, because of\nsuch a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can\u2019t even\nfind the names, who organized in convents, in churches and regular people, because\nof their caring and their dedication, 40,000 Jewish people have survived in Belgium,\nincluding my own child.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: So you see that combination, it was so wonderful that Steven was there for me to\nhelp [indecipherable].",
        "Q: So wou \u2014",
        "A: And many of the words from the documents from Belgium, I did not know\nbecause I didn\u2019t learn English of those documents. So Steven would \u2014 made sure I\nhave a special dictionary, to have those [indecipherable] what anybody who wanted\nApril 21, 2011\nto know. Another thing what we did is anybody passing by on the second floor, you\njust seen people running back and forth, specially young students. So we really \u2014 my\njob really was, can we help you? And we did, because once we had a French person\nwho was sent from a newspaper in France, with the picture from the room where\nyou have all the pictures there, and whoever he asked, they didn't know what he\nwanted. And he passed a few times, til I had enough guts and I asked if I help you?\nThen he said in French, nobody knows the answer. And he had a copy of the picture\nand the name of the newspaper he was representing. So immediately if not sooner,\nSteven was able, through the computer, to get the \u2014 all the information, which he\ntyped for him to take. So he didn\u2019t have to go to so many places, because he was\noriginally in the right place. So you see, you never know the contact you have with\nSteven in that particular place, because he knows the answers to everything.",
        "Q: Well, 1t \u2014 to me it sounds that here when you started volunteering \u2014 I don\u2019t want\nto put words in your mouth, but this is the sort of thoughts that are coming into my\nmind, is that there were aspects of the larger story that was relevant to you because it\nhad to do with the Belgian underground.",
        "A: You\u2019re right.",
        "Q: That you were finding out through this work, and that through the work and\nthrough your interaction, little bit your own story was coming up.",
        "A: Exactly, you\u2019re right.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: And 1s \u2014 and 1s that what made it more comfortable for you to now speak?",
        "A: Oh, more than just comfortable, because I had the hard time when we came to\nAmerica and I was still young, nobody from the family wanted to hear any of our\nstories, because they were afraid they gonna have a headache.",
        "Q: That must have been \u2014",
        "A: So this was somebody I just got to know, and I felt comfortable \u2014 there\u2019s another\nword which is just more than comfortable, at ease, and we could talk, which is so\nunbelievable, which I haven\u2019t done to such extent. Because this was always bottle\nup and still is, to many extent. [indecipherable] was very, very fortunate, and the\nsame thing, thanks to Steven. He made sure that I would be speaking up. He said, if\nyou don\u2019t do it now, when you gonna do it? And I know I\u2019m old, so I had to do it.\nBut it just amazing how two people from such different backgrounds, different lives,\nhave been able to have such a wonderful relationship.",
        "Q: Steve?",
        "A: Which is gonna be for me forever, because we could talk about so many things\nand I\u2019m very fortunate to have a young person who could understand our situations.\nSo that\u2019s why I say \u2014",
        "Q: Steve, we\u2019re putting you on the spot all right.",
        "A: No, \u2019'm not. He knows I\u2019m not.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: So ever \u2014 so I\u20141f I ever get a gold star, it belongs to Steven.",
        "Q: Steve, is there something you want to add to this, of your thoughts in the years as\nthey\u2019ve gone by, what you\u2019ve learned from Fanny and through the relationship that\ndeveloped between you about her story?\nS: Oh my God. Well, the first thing I wanted to say 1s I br \u2014 I wanted to push Fanny,\nbecause we did develop this personal relationship and I\u2019m very fortunate in my job\nthat I\u2019m able to interact with the survivors and their families individually, and I meet\nhundreds of them, thousands of them for 20 years now, but Fanny is os \u2014 really\nspecial. And again, one of my profe \u2014 jobs is to ensure that the stories of individuals\nare remembered. And so, while we had great conversations, I didn\u2019t want it to end\nthere. I wanted to make sure that other people were able to hear her story through\noral histories, read her story. I always get her \u2014 want her to write out her stories, do\npresentations as much as possible. And so in this way, it\u2019s sort of my job, but to\nmake sure that her story is heard by as many people as possible. She has so many\nthings to teach about \u2014 I guess mainly for me 1s overcoming. Someone who\u2019s been\nthrough so much, and by listening to her I understand as much as anybody can, what\nshe went through. And knowing her family, the main thing is about overcoming that.\nYou go through so many things and sometimes there\u2019s no answer to them, you just\nhave to wait things out until they pass. And you\u2019re affected for life, but that horrible\nmoment does pass and you have to rebuild your life afterwards. And Fanny was\nApril 21, 2011\nable to do that. So I knew her story, but I also met her daughter and I got to know\nher granddaughter and her great-granddaughter. And so I see that for the horrible\nthings that Fanny went through, four generations later, there\u2019s a beautiful 12 year\nold girl that\u2019s a friend of my son\u2019s actually. And I see that if it wasn\u2019t for Fanny just\npersevering and going on, that\u2019s \u2014 if it wasn\u2019t for that, this beautiful 12 year old girl\nwould not be there, would not be friends with my sons, and would not have the\nfreedom to go to school and enjoy life in a way that Fanny wasn\u2019t able to later on in\nher life.",
        "Q: Thank you. Thank you very much. And we\u2019re going to continue now with let\u2019s\nsay, the usual part of our oral history. But I thought it was very important \u2014",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: \u2014 that we \u2014 that we would be able to \u2014",
        "A: Because \u2014 [Il you why I feel it\u2019s so important. It\u2019s very difficult in this time and\nage, with technology that\u2019s so advanced, to such extent you have little ones with the\n\u2014 the computers, the cell phone, just name it and it\u2019s growing bigger and bigger, that\npeople still could have a personal relationship, and feel good about themself, that\nthey have somebody else who could understand their feelings or what they\u2019re\nsaying. Another problem I had is because of the things I went through, I always felt\n\u2014and this is still with me today, because it took me 50 years to be able to talk about\nApril 21, 2011\nit, and I still have a feeling of inferiority, that I\u2019m not like other people, which I\u2019m\nnot.",
        "Q: Because you suffered? Because you went through these things?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: As if they\u2019re \u2014 you suffered because of something you had done, and that\u2019s \u2014 that\nsuffering made you less of a person rather than more of a person?",
        "A: Uh-huh. This is because what has been done to me. You see, at the museum here,\nI am the only person who went through medical experimentation. I\u2019m the only\nvolunteer survivor who was already married and had a child at the time. So I had the\nresponsibility, which is so difficult to make other people understand. This is why\nwhen I speak to an audience here, and when you feel the reaction of the people, like\nyou did when you heard me talk \u2014 you know somehow it\u2019s like a soothing medicine,\nor like somebody pats you on the shoulder and said you okay.",
        "Q: Well, from \u2014 from what Steve said, not only you\u2019re okay, but you inspired others\nand were able to form a family that now, and that effect of \u2014 of your decisions 1s felt\nfour generations later.",
        "A: Mm-hm, he\u2019s right, absolutely. It\u2019s true.",
        "Q: Thank you \u2014\nS: You done with me?",
        "Q: I think we\u2019re \u2014 I think this part \u2014 this part is \u2014 is done.\nApril 21, 2011\nS: It\u2019s all yours now.",
        "Q: Thank you. All right, thank you very much, sorry you get [break] So Fanny,\nnow \u2014 are we o \u2014 should I start? Okay, okay. So now I would like to go back to what\nwe usually do in the beginning, and that is starting at the beginning.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m glad you have added to, because this is why it made it important for me\nto come to you.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: To come \u2014",
        "Q: And it\u2019s because of Steve, I know, that we\u2019re speaking today, and I\u2019m very\ngrateful about that.",
        "A: I\u2019m glad you have added that, because very few people are lucky in their life to\nhave a relationship \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 as his and mine was.",
        "Q: And is.",
        "A: It still 1s, I shouldn\u2019t say was.",
        "Q: Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "A: As its.",
        "Q: Fanny, let\u2019s start then when you were born, where you were born, your maiden\nname \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: \u2014 and then we\u2019ll go from there.",
        "A: Very good.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was born in Lodz, Poland. I was born December the third in 1916. We were\nthree sisters. In the early 20\u2019s, my father, my mother and the three of us, we came to\nBrussels, Belgium.",
        "Q: In the early 20\u2019s, so you were a child.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: An \u2014 and what were the names of your sisters? Were you the oldest, the\nyoungest?",
        "A: I was the middle one.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My oldest sister was Terez(ph) Orenbach. I was Fanny Orenbach, and my\nyoungest sister was Rose Orenbach.",
        "Q: The names of your parents?",
        "A: My father \u2014 my late father was Benjamin. My led \u2014 late mother was Rivke\nLeah.",
        "Q: Rivke Leah.",
        "A: Right, two names.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: According to many Jewish tradition, a child born is always named after\nsomebody in the family. This is a very old tradition, and it\u2019s interesting even today,\neven Jewish people who are Reform, they still give two names to a newborn child.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of L6dz?",
        "A: Not at all.",
        "Q: No. And what was \u2014",
        "A: And it\u2019s interesting because I remember going to school, and of course Polish\nwas the language. And as soon we came to Belgium, we went to school, not only we\nwere \u2014 went to school, we had a wonderful upbringing. We were very good students\nand we make an effort to learn English, which we learn very fast.",
        "Q: Oh, you mean French.",
        "A: In French, yes.",
        "Q: In \u20141-in ma \u2014 fr \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: In the higher grades, six and seven grades, you had to learn Flemish too, because\nanybody working fo \u2014 either for the government or any official job, you had to know\nFlemish and French. But we use mostly French. And we \u2014",
        "Q: And at home?",

We were the\nApril 21, 2011\nfirst house that we had a record player. Can you believe that today that the record\nplayer was so important? We were the first one. So, of course all my friends were\nalways in our house. But this was a big deal. How do you explain that when you\nspeak to young people today, to explain them the meaning of things which today\ntechnology is so above what I have seen through the years.",
        "Q: They \u2014 yet, it was music. It was music that you could then have at any time you\nwanted, through that record player, which is important \u2014",

But this, nobody could pay you for, and\nthis, of course, was not a paying job. This is what \u2014 just to do a very special deed,\nand she did that very often.

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And that time in Poland apparently, working 1s \u2014 was not as comfortable or not\nwell enough and since my mother had a brother in Brussels, so we all came to\nBrussels.",
        "Q: So that was your reason for coming to Brussels, but what was the reason for\nleaving Poland\u201d?",
        "A: Because of the financial situation.",

        "A: It has always been, but apparen \u2014 which I didn\u2019t know, we didn't know. But\napparently this has always been. And it seem Poland has always have a problem,\nbecause in 1946 \u2014 I\u2019m just jumping from one \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 to the other, but you\u2019re talking about Poland. In 1946, many people who have\nsurvive camps, and the forest or in hiding, went back to Poland where they came\nApril 21, 2011\nfrom to find out if there\u2019s some relatives, somebody\u2019s still alive. And at that time, in\n1946, there was a pogrom and 200 people were killed, who survived and came to\nlook after [indecipherable]. Just to give you an idea. And even today, Poland has\nnot given any restitution. Not only not giving restitution, they don\u2019t \u2014 not even\nwilling to give back the houses of somebody who has survived, of today it\u2019s still the\nsame thing.",

        "Q: \u2014 or you went to a regular public school?",
        "A: Regular public schools, because my parents felt we should have a regular\neducation. No matter what\u2019s going to happen, they felt \u2014 so when I graduated from\ncollege in art and design with a degree, AP, a few of us were taken to work for the\nroyal house.",
        "Q: The royal house?",
        "A: Yes, ma\u2019am, we work for the royal hou \u2014 and this was a great honor and a big\ndeal.",
        "Q: I imagine, yeah.",
        "A: And for me, coming from an Orthodox house, it was so revealing, because there\nwere so many departments. Everybody, like groups, we did different thing. Patterns,\ncolors. What kind of a fair it\u2019s gonna be and how many people are gonna be involve\nin the fair and what kind of clothes they would have to wear. It was really very\nexciting for me.",
        "Q: Well, I think it would exciting for anybody, yeah.",
        "A: Well, because I have never lived that kind of world. Don\u2019t forget in Belgium,\nspecially girls coming from religious houses, it\u2019s very difficult. And at that time\nwomen were either secretaries, seamstresses, which I was not, and that\u2019s what my\nparents made sure we wa \u2014 wouldn\u2019t. So, it was different.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: So what \u2014 your jo \u2014 what was your job in this royal house, what did you do?",
        "A: We were part of assorting colors. Let\u2019s say 10 people would go to an affair. We\nwere known \u2014 we were told what kind of affair is it, evening, afternoon or tea,\nbecause the royal house, those people were having different people, and different\naffairs.",
        "Q: And you would design the clothes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: For the royal family to wear at these events?",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s wild, just what you just \u2014 to \u2014 t-today \u2014 it was very exciting.",
        "Q: And did you \u2014 do you remember some of the clothes that you designed?",
        "A: Well, because it was not just one design.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was at least 50 people part of the designing. And about 50 at least designing\nwhat kind of color for tea, over kind of color to receive people, other dignitaries\nfrom other countries.",

        "A: It was. Somebody else mentioned that, it was like a show.",
        "Q: And did you meet the royal family?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: No. Once the queen, when it was a special holiday.",

        "A: The \u2014 they were a few \u2014 yes, but we always lived very well with Jewish people.\nYou see, another thing which we had in Belgium, at that time the Belgium Congo\nbelonged to Belgium. The nuns and religious people went to teach religion. They\nbuilt churches, schools, to [indecipherable] the people and teaching the people.\nBecause of that, many people from Africa came to Belgium for their jobs, because\nthey had a complete department, the Belgium Congo, that started way, way,\ngenerations before. So we have gone to school with black people, we lived in the\nsame neighborhood with black people, and we never knew that there was a\ndifference.",
        "Q: So, Belgium was not a racist country?",
        "A: Not at all, til we came to America that I have learn about racism. Don\u2019t forget,\nall this started when Hitler came to power. But before that, we went to school to\nApril 21, 2011\nblack and white and yellow, any kind of persons. And also because Belgium had the\nBelgium Congo.",
        "Q: Did you, in school \u2014 if you were born in 1916, then by 1930 you were a teenager\nand were \u2014 and throughout the 1920\u2019s at home, were there any discussions about\npolitics in Europe, in \u2014 in Belgium, in Germany, or anything like that there then?",
        "A: No, not from \u2014 we start \u2014 that particular information we start to get in 1938, we\nwere just married. And because from Austria and Germany, many young people\nescape and came to Belgium with an open door.",

        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: \u2014 however. Hitler came to power in 1933.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether or not that was discussed at home in your \u2014",
        "A: No, we had no problem, because in 19 \u2014 in 1938, before Kristallnacht, the\nBelgium people were assured that we would not be invaded. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re\nfamiliar with the map, Holland and Belgium \u2014",

        "Q: And I lived in The Netherlands and I had never heard about it.",
        "A: Well, the strange thing is, I went through the museum to speak to one of the\nuniversities. And we stayed two nights there with somebody from the museum who\ntook me. And one lady we ca \u2014 became friendly with, that was a group of teachers\nwho gonna teach students. So I was chosen at that particular time, to speak to the\nteachers who gonna teach th-the youngsters about the Holocaust. So when we went\nto dinner, the teacher came with us and she ask if she could take her husband. And\nof course, why not? There were the two of us, it was wonderful. In between our\nconversation, which we had a lot to talk, he apparently, he was from Holland. And\nhe is young, and he had parents in Holland and family, where he goes to visit. That\nwas between dinner an-and conversation, he told me even today the parents talk\nabout the canals. And for me it was like, you know, soothing, somebody else has\never heard about that, too. He say even today they still talk that we would not be\noccupied, because Holland had a tough time too, with the Germans.",

And he and many other musicians were\nplaying in music houses, because there were silent movies, and that was a wonderful\nApril 21, 2011\nway of making a living.

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He thought. But that was okay, it was nice and like I say, we were really having\nbig dreams and big hopes at that particular time. That was1938, not knowing what\u2019s\nwaiting for us. And also, in November of 1938, there was Kristallnacht, killing the\nJews.",
        "Q: In Germany.",
        "A: In Germany and in Austria. Breaking windows. What they also did, and there\u2019s\na book about that, the Germans were surprised that in different cities, the population\nwould not be against arresting the Jews. What they did, and I think there\u2019s a\ndocumentary here on the fifth floor \u2014 they have treasures right here on the fifth floor\nfor anybody \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the library at the \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s correct \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 the museum [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 yes, and they have many recordings or documentaries. And they have like a\njudge, or a surgeon dressed in women\u2019s clothes and parading in the streets. They had\nofficial rabbis cleaning the streets with toothbrushes. And when I spoke to that\nparticular teacher\u2019s group, which made it easier for me to speak, they had slides of\nwhat I\u2019m telling you now. They had slides of those people going the street, and the\nApril 21, 2011\nGermans never thought that their neighbors would let their friends, who were in\nGermany for generations, let them do that.",
        "Q: So that must have come as a shock when Kristallnacht happened in 1938. How\ndid \u2014 do you remember how it is you found out about it?",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget, we still ha \u2014 we had our radios at that time, and we knew. And also,\nright after Kristallnacht, 2,000 Jewish [indecipherable] came to Belgium, and they\nformed a Jewish organization, J \u2014 AJB, association of Jews in Belgium. And they\nhave arranged of Jewish families to take in child. And my mother and father also\nhad sheltered a little girl until 1940.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Because the same organization picked up the children and put them in other \u2014 the\nreason we got \u2014 why \u2014 how come from Germany, we would have to take her off the\ntrain \u2014 not that we mind taking them in, because in \u201938 we were still innocent,\nbecause the parents would have to work in different states, so those children needed\na home.",
        "Q: So, in other words, the parents could no longer work in the same place in\nGermany, they\u2019d have to work in different parts of Germany, and no one was there\nto take care of the children?",
        "A: But we don\u2019t know if those parents have not been arrested.",
        "Q: Ah.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: We didn't know that til after.",

        "A: Yes, a girl.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Sophie.",
        "Q: And where \u2014 where was she from?",
        "A: She was from Berlin.",
        "Q: Did she tell you of what her experiences were?",
        "A: She didn\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "Q: Was she older than you, or was she younger than you?",
        "A: She was younger. I think they would \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, she was a child \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes \u2014",
        "Q: She was a child.",
        "A: I think she was between 12 and 14.",
        "Q: So she was a quiet child.",
        "A: Right. Very hurt, not quiet. Very hurt, very hurt.",
        "Q: So she was traumatized?",
        "A: Yes, because she was an only child, and probably extremely spoiled.",
        "Q: What told you that? Why did you think that?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Because we learned it from other families who had children who were more\noutspoken.",
        "Q: Oh. So they were, you know, in other words, maybe she was totally unprepared.\nNo one was really prepared, but \u2014 but someone who came from a privileged life\nwould be far less able.",
        "A: Right. And of course, many traumas happen in our lives \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 affect people in different ways.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Which we never know.",
        "Q: It\u2019s true.",
        "A: Including myself. You never know the \u2014 the reaction.",
        "Q: So this was your first taste of what was going on in Germany\u201d",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember, were there discussions about that?",
        "A: Then the discu \u2014 everybody was a politician. You know, coming back Friday\nfrom shul, or in the morning after shul, this 1s the only topic. And also, another thing\nwhat has been happening, many people from Austria and Germany, young, single\nmen came to Belgium and that\u2019s how we connect and we got to know many of those\npeople. But they didn\u2019t know, they only knew Kristallnacht. And they felt it\u2019s gonna\nApril 21, 2011\ngo away shortly, and it\u2019s not gonna continue to the way. And of course, then the\nGermans started to arrest the Jewish people, beating them, putting them into jails\nand never knowing what has happened to them. And that\u2019s what I feel, it was the\nend of the civilization of Germany. And I tell you why I say that, because in\nBelgium, if a family had a lot of money, and especially having boys, they would\nsend them to Germany to study, because this was the ultimate of an education. But\nof course, afterwards we have learned what those educated people were able to do.\nAnd we became very friendly with those people and that\u2019s how we got involved, and\nwe got to know those people who have joined the underground of the solidarity or\nthe resistance, whatever you called it.",
        "Q: So it was through the refugees coming in from Germany and Austria \u2014 I want to\ns \u2014 go back and then I\u2019Il talk about this a little bit. When Kristallnacht happened,\nyou had just been married a year.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Were you pregnant at the time?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So your baby hadn\u2019t been born when all of these things started to erupt?",
        "A: No, she was born in March \u00b039.",
        "Q: Did you have any thoughts when \u2014 when your daughter was born, of \u2014",
        "A: Any trauma?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Yeah, or \u2014 or \u2014 or fear of what \u2014 what were \u2014",
        "A: No, because on the radios, on the ne \u2014 in the newspapers, Belgium is gonna be\nfree, you don\u2019t have to worry, we gonna be free. We not going to be occupied, that\u2019s\nwhat was used. And of course then we were almost reassured, because of the\nMaginot line. And like I say, then everybody became a politician, and we believed\nthe papers. And we did believe, because we felt reassured with friends, having the\nMaginot line, til it became, you know, a sad story, cause they went all around.\nImagine such a big army, only 18 days they lasted. And France was occupied.",
        "Q: What \u2014 do you remember what \u2014 where you were on September 1\u201c, 1939? That\u2019s\nhalf a year after your daughter\u2019s born. That\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: A year after?",
        "Q: No, half a year after?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: September 1\u201c, 1939, half a year after your daughter is born, is the invasion of\nPoland.",
        "A: Well, this 1s what started us really being scared.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Because, since we were told that Belgium and Holland are gonna remain free,\nthe Belgium government asked people to si\u2014 young men to sign up. They didn\u2019t\nknow for what and for where, and many, many have signed up, including my\nApril 21, 2011\nhusband. Also many people who have come from Germany and Austria have also\nsigned up. And they, in 1940, when the Germans invaded, they all got the call where\nto meet, in Dunkirk.",
        "Q: So your husband signed up to be part of the Belgian military forces?",
        "A: Well, we didn't know what they\u2019re gonna do.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Many for military \u2014 don\u2019t forget that afterwards we have learned that in England\nthey had divisions of people from different countries in Europe. Some have mixed\nwith the British and many have remain independent.",
        "Q: So, in other words, when Germany invades Poland, there\u2019s a mi \u2014 mobilization\neffort taking place in Belgium.",
        "A: Wa- we didn\u2019t know it\u2019s gonna be a mobilization.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: We only thought in case of need. Those were the words, in case of need.",
        "Q: But signing up, what did that mean at that point? Did that mean your husband left\nthe house?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay, it just meant he registered.",
        "A: In case they would meet and we felt well, maybe, you know, to be at the borders.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: And of course, none of them have ever been in the army, so we never thought\nthat that would be the reason.",
        "Q: Did your life change much, your own personal life, after the war started?",
        "A: It did, because the fear grew so bad.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because here we were living peacefully, and really innocent, completely.\nInnocent is really the word you could use, because we couldn\u2019t believe anything\ncould happen, because even when the young people who came from Germany and\nAustria, didn\u2019t know that Jews were killed, they only knew Kristallnacht, they only\nknew the damage they were doing. But they didn\u2019t know what was happening to the\nJews at that particular time already.",
        "Q: And the fear grows. When the war starts, the fear grows.",
        "A: Tremendously.",
        "Q: How would \u2014",
        "A: Because we didn\u2019t know what to expect. How do you put that in words?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s really being scared for your own shadow.",
        "Q: Yeah. Were your sisters also married at the time?",
        "A: My oldest sister was married and she had already two sons at that time.",
        "Q: Her name was Theresa, right?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Terez(ph), mm-hm.",
        "Q: Terez(ph), uh-huh",
        "A: And my younger sister took courses in English, and they had a very special store\nin Belgium for tourists \u2014",
        "Q: Un-huh.",
        "A: \u2014 where they make lace, and selling the lace. And also because she knew already\nEnglish at that time, that was her main thing. So that\u2019s what she was working.",
        "Q: Your parents \u2014 it sounds to me, and correct me if I\u2019ve misunderstood this, it\nsounds your \u2014 like your parents were very much part of the je \u2014 Orthodox Jewish\ncommunity.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: So that was their \u2014 their world.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: And their life, with the other people.",
        "Q: Yeah. And your father made his living through his \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Okay. What were some of the discussions going on \u2014",
        "A: Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Everybody was guessing.",
        "Q: They were guessing.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: And everybody was a politician, everybody knew what\u2019s gonna happen.",
        "Q: So everybody was sure of this and sure of that and nobody really knew.",
        "A: You're right. Not only that, we couldn\u2019t believe in the wildest imagination that\nanything was happening the way it was happening.",
        "Q: So, in other \u2014",
        "A: And that it could happen.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re f \u2014 everyone\u2019s afraid, not \u2014 the boom hasn\u2019t fallen yet, though. How\ndid the boom fall?",
        "A: In 1940.\nQ2: Maybe we should change tape here.",
        "Q: Okay.\nQ2: Cause I\u2019m only one minute from \u2014",
        "Q: Okay [break] Your daughter said that the \u2014 last night you were nervous about\ncoming in today?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019m always nervous before I come to talk.",
        "Q: Yeah. And your friend who has not spoken about her story, she doesn\u2019t even talk\nto people about it at all?",
        "A: No.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Di-\u2014 has she told you?",
        "A: No. But we became very close friends and she \u2014 what she does, which I would\nlike to do, 1s go to the writing class. That, I have a hard time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I really \u2014 I went twice to the class and I went home very unhappy. I would like to\nstart writing. You know, just take \u2014",
        "Q: And what \u2014 1-1if I can ask you, what was it that made you unhappy about the class,\nor about your experience there?",
        "A: I\u2019m really very shy by nature, and when there\u2019s a group of people who talk\nloudly, I get quieter. Here you thought I have all the qualities. I am far \u2014 I\u2019m far\nfrom it. No, I get very agitated.",
        "Q: I see. I\u2014 I think writing does do many good things, beca \u2014 and I think that it\nhelps. It helps get the story down.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You often find \u2014 I often find when I write, I discover what it is that I\u2019m thinking.\nIt\u2019s almost \u2014 in the beginning you think you know what you\u2019re going to say, but as\nyou\u2019re writing, you discover new thoughts. And those are very important, you know,\nyou let yourself develop \u2014",
        "A: I would love to do that, but I don\u2019t have much time. I\u2019m too busy. My son-in-law\nmakes fun of me because \u2014 and then I\u2019m going to tell you the joke. Whenever he\nApril 21, 2011\ncalls, I\u2019m not home. So I said once to Freddie, you have two choices. Would you\nlike to have a mother-in-law who\u2019s drunk and always home? Or a mother-in-law\nwho\u2019s never home. Didn\u2019t get an answer. No, I have to be involved.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I ha\u2014 do many things, except I\u2019m slowing down very fast because of different\nhealth problems and I\u2019m having many. I even may need eye surgery, which scares\nme to death. I had two cataracts remove and now I have glaucoma on one eye, and\nbecause of the clo \u2014 glaucoma they have like a film over.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In order to remove that and not to lose the eyesight, they need surgery. And I\u2019m\nscared to death at my age to have eye surgery. I said, if I lose my eyesight, okay,\nwalking, it\u2019s not a problem, I\u2019m not walking, but this is a problem and scares me, he\ncouldn\u2019t understand. He said, I will be [indecipherable] already.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I\u2019m not.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget, I live alone. And that\u2019s not easy, but I hope to remain independent\nas long I can. And then say my goodbyes and go. That would be nice. That would be\nnice, cause I see too many people much younger than I am dying of Alzheimer\u2019s.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Or from cancer, it\u2019s \u2014 my daughter had a fr \u2014 had somebody she took care, I think\nI told you.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Cancer, 52. She died about a month ago. The synagogue has a sign, people to go\nand help, and she did.",
        "Q: Fanny, let\u2019s go back \u2014",
        "A: Her job really was \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: \u2014 she was a social worker and she got a degree in psychology, and she was\nworking for Montgomery county as a child sexually abuse.",
        "Q: This is your daughter, right?",
        "A: My daughter. I couldn\u2019t do it.",
        "Q: It\u2019s heartbreaking.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t do the job.",
        "Q: It\u2019s heartbreaking.",
        "A: She did.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t. And the sad thing is, we have that much of tt.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Can you imagine a woman giving birth, at the age of six, having that child to be\nsexually abused because she needs drugs? To me when I heard that, 1t was \u2014 when I\nthink what some mothers did to have their child, it\u2019s \u2014 but \u2014",
        "Q: Fanny, I need to bring you back to 1940.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: We have to go back to when the boom fell.",
        "A: Are we gonna talk now?",
        "Q: Yeah, we\u2019re talking now.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: We were rolling, we were rolling. But that\u2019s okay, that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: That\u2019s \u2014 no, no, no, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. 1940, and the war has started in Poland\nand people are frightened, and everyone\u2019s a politician finally, in Belgium.",
        "A: That was before they invaded Belgium.",
        "Q: And how did the \u2014 how did you experience the invasion of Belgium?",
        "A: Scared. Worried. And not realizing what\u2019s really happening.",
        "Q: Were you alone?",
        "A: No. My husband left May the 10\". My sister-in-law, who was \u2014 my husband\u2019s\nbrother, they both left, and my sister-in-law had a little child, she brought the crib\ndownstairs to my apartment so we would be together. And she had a br \u2014 she wasn\u2019t\nApril 21, 2011\nJewish, and she became Jewish and then she didn't know what to leave \u2014 what to do\nwith her [indecipherable]. Anyway, she and the baby, they left \u2014 they went to live\nwith the brother.",
        "Q: So this was your husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife? Yeah. You\u2019re saying May 10\". Was\nthat the day that Belgium was invended \u2014 i-invaded? May 10\". And your husb \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s when the Germans marched in.",
        "Q: And your husband left that day?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: He was mobilized, or he \u2014",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s where they got the signal.",
        "Q: I see. And you were left alone then, with you \u2014 your daughter and with the other\nlittle child?",
        "A: Well, my sister-in-law \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: \u2014 about a week later she left.",
        "Q: I see. I see. And what was \u2014",
        "A: And my mother lived about \u2014 my mother and father lived about 10 minutes, but\nthe day before the Germans invaded, the bridges were there for three days, and in\nthree days they bombed the bridges. You know, bridges from one neighborhood to\nanother?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They bombed those bridges, and left. And then the Germans had a hard time\ncoming in, but apparently they had enough forces to close those things. And that\u2019s\nwhen our pain started.",
        "Q: What were your final conversations like with your husband before he left?",
        "A: Very difficult. Very difficult. He didn't know what to do and he wanted to stay\nand I didn't think it would be right, if we \u2014 number one, we never thought of the\nmassacre waiting for us. We never knew of deportation, we never knew of \u2014 we\nknew of working with the children who have been collected the same day. Not\ncollected, they\u2019ve been taken care of by the same organization who have put them\nthere.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the German children.",
        "A: Who came to us \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, who came to you, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 from Germany, or from Austria. It was frightening, it was scary, it was\nunbelievably scary, and I don\u2019t have another word of scared.",
        "Q: So it was ma \u2014",
        "A: Of such a uncertainty of what\u2019s going to be from now on. We knew we gonna\nhave to work. That\u2019s what was told from the youngsters who came, that we\u2019re gonna\nhave to work.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: But that\u2019s all you knew.",
        "A: Yeah, but we never knew that there\u2019s gonna be a separation of people. Now, the\nyoung people who came before from Austria and Germany, they never te \u2014 told us,\nor they didn\u2019t know. They only knew Kristallnacht, then we run away. And already\nat that time, they have groups to go to other countries and organize people, just\ntelling them. And that\u2019s how the underground has started.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And those people joined with the und \u2014 and like I said before, the only thing\nwhich has saved the Jews who were saved in Belgium is because the resistance or\nunderground, whatever you call it, were one group, Jews and non-Jews, where\nFrance didn\u2019t have that and Holland didn\u2019t have that. You know, at the museum\nhere, you have the pictures.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: There\u2019s one young man who was a physician in Belgium and h-he was Jewish\nand he was one of the first organizers. Somehow he was able to get a message to\nEngland, and a friend of his stole a plane and bombed the Gestapo in Belgium.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "A: It just broke windows, but there was a way to respond to anything. And at least\nyou felt there\u2019s somebody else who 1s having that fear.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: If your husband had realized that you really were in danger, do you think he\nwould have left?",
        "A: I hope not.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I hope not. I never thought of it. You know, that thought never came to me, that\nhe would leave his child.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. He didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: She was just 14 months.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I really don\u2019t.",
        "Q: And when you saw him, what was the last glimpse you had of him, as he was\nleaving?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: What was the last glimpse you had of him as he was leaving?",
        "A: Crying and hugging Josiane til the last second.",
        "Q: So he was crying?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: He was crying.",
        "A: How could anybody not? Like I say, we just started.",
        "Q: What was \u2014 what was going on with your mother and father?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, they were surprised that my husband would go, but I felt it would be wrong\nof me \u2014 why shouldn\u2019t he go if he could help us? We didn\u2019t know. Like I say, in the\nwildest dreams you couldn\u2019t imagine what was waiting for the people.",
        "Q: When did the underground that you\u2019ve spoke of, that you\u2019ve mentioned, when\ndid it really start functioning in your life? How did you get involved with it?",
        "A: Well, we know the \u2014 we knew those people.",
        "Q: Okay, you knew the people who were in the underground?",
        "A: Some of them.",
        "Q: Some of them. Your husband and yourself, or just yourself?",
        "A: No, he too knew those people. Don\u2019t forget, we were young \u2014 we were young,\nand we have met those young people coming, through other young people in\nBelgium who were ready to fight. Not every young man left, because they felt we\nhave to defend the people who are still there, which they did. And mainly the people\nwho came from Austria and Germany, they needed a place to stay, and we have a\nattic. We call it the mansard.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Marsat(ph)?",
        "A: Marset(ph).",
        "Q: Marseille?",
        "A: No, no, no, in mansard.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: That\u2019s a attic. But anyway \u2014",
        "Q: Ah, mansard, okay.",
        "A: And then we made keys.",
        "Q: So you kept some of the people in your attic?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t see them. And once my sister-in-law left, I took her apartment. She\nmoved her things, we had the main floor, because my husband had the room where\nhe was doing tailoring at home to make some money. And when she moved, I\nmoved to her apartment on the third floor, and the downstairs we rented to an elderly\ncouple who had the grocery stores, the little they could get. And so mainly they were\nselling flowers. But that was it. And the people stayed there til the beginning of \u201943,\nbut they were not there all the time. Those two people \u2014",
        "Q: Talking about the underground people?",
        "A: Yes, the two people who\u2019s there permanently had people coming with\ninformation, with pamphlets.",
        "Q: And was your involvement that you provided this place to stay \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and that\u2019s all you did, or were you involved in other ways in this \u2014",
        "A: That was my main involvement.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Is to provide the place to stay. Did your \u2014 did your rest of your family know that\nyou were involved in this way?",
        "A: Not really. You don\u2019t talk about those things. And another thing, we didn\u2019t even\nknow what they were exchanging. Like my sister and brother-in-law, they were in\nthe ar \u2014 my married sister and her husband \u2014",
        "Q: Your older one.",
        "A: Yes, they were with the underground, and they were working in a basement of a\nchurch the whole time of the war, since 1940. Food was supplied and anything. That\nwas an exchange place for ammunition. I didn\u2019t know, and they didn't know of what\nI have there. And they didn't know the exchange over there. But where they were is\nfalse pay \u2014 papers and ammunition exchange. People brought and other people came\nto get the things.",
        "Q: How did things change for your mother and your father?",
        "A: They changed because my father was at the rabbi\u2019s house with 10 other people to\narrange for a burial, which was in secret.",
        "Q: And this was \u2014",
        "A: And one of them, they were denounced and they were arrested in August of\n1942.",
        "Q: So two years after the Germans have arrived \u2014",
        "A: Yes.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: \u2014 they were arrested.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back a little bit, to May 1940, when your husband leaves \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and we\u2019ve talked about how you got involved in resistance. When is the first\ntime you saw a German soldier, or you came face to face with a sol \u2014",
        "A: I have a picture of them.",
        "Q: You do? Oh my.",
        "A: Yeah, because once we had the yellow star, that was in \u2014 the yellow star, we got\nthe yellow star in 1940, and the Germans were walking freely in the caf\u00e9s in\nBelgium, sure, because they felt they were the \u2014 the heroes, the victors.",
        "Q: Did you have any experience of \u2014 of a German who would treat you differently\non the street when they saw you \u2014 you wearing the yellow star?",
        "A: No, unless they were in charge to check our papers.",
        "Q: And did you have that happen?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Your papers weren\u2019t checked. Okay. So would it be fair to say that in the first\nyear or two you really never had any direct contact with the occupiers?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, we were on a streetcar, and we had to run because they were on one side,\nthen they would \u2014 came smart, and they were on both side of the tram, you know,\nthe entrance and the exit.",
        "Q: Right. And you weren\u2019t supposed to be on the tram?",
        "A: Not as Jewish, they would take you. They would arrest you.",
        "Q: So you couldn\u2019t tra \u2014",
        "A: Or when people were stand \u2014 in 1940, we had to buy the yellow star and we had\nto stay in line to get the food rations, because food was on rations. And of course\nyou stayed in line in this small grocery store, wherever they had food, they had. And\nthat\u2019s where they come and examine Jews. So you were lucky if you passed, and if\ngot a half a bread or something, or certain things, and not being caught.",
        "Q: Did you have to go to work again? Once your husband left, did you have to go to\nwork?",
        "A: To work? No, I didn\u2019t go. I didn't go to work any more once I became pregnant.\nAnd you know, in the middle months \u2014",
        "Q: How did you live?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: How did \u2014 how did you live? Once your husband left, how did you live?",
        "A: Well, whatever food my mother has, we shared. And I was selling my husband\u2019s\nclothes, and that gave me food. And also, what we had in Belgium, young women\nApril 21, 2011\nwith their babies \u2014 we had to go to clinics where we got \u2014 where the babies were\nexamine. You had to go every week til the baby was six months.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: In those places you have physicians or doctors, whatever you call it, with\nmedications, care and food for the child. There was one lady by the name Madame\nLouise who was kind and generous and giving me once 1n awhile food for Josiane.\nBut it\u2019s so unbelievable today to realize that those kind and generous people were\nrisking their own lives, because if they would be caught, they would be shot on the\nspot, no question ask. They have a monument in Brussels, with two people who\nwere trying to run away, and they were shot by the Germans. It\u2019s hard today to think\nof the courage and the bravery of so many kind people. There was no money\ninvolved, there was no glory involved. Here on the fifth floor, if you ever have a\nchance, see that documentary of five people. There\u2019s two priests and three women,\nand they were ask \u2014 because thanks to them who started to organize it, that we had\n4,000 Jewish people who were saved in Belgium.",
        "Q: So these were people who were part of these clinics, who would \u2014 gave food \u2014\nwho would check the babies every week and would give food. Now, a few\nquestions. Did you know what happened to your husband? When he left, did you\nknow what happened to him?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: No. What did really happen, there were three ships. Two were put in flames and\nburn, and one made it to England. My husband happened to be on the one who\ncame to England, but we didn\u2019t know about that tragedy til after the war, because\nthe first things the Germans did is t-take away the radios. You had to bring the\nradios to a destination, and eve \u2014",
        "Q: Was that for everybody, every citizen, or just the Jews?",
        "A: Just the Jews.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And it was easy for them to find out who has a radio, because you had to register\nyour radio and you paid like \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, I see \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you \u2014 a fee, or taxes, whatever you call. And it\u2019s so hard when I speak to young\npeople to make them understand the importance of not having a radio.",
        "Q: You\u2019re cut off.",
        "A: \u2014 because today you have so many gadgets of communication, so there\u2019s not the\nproblem, and that was our biggest problem, that we were cut off completely from the\nrest of the world. Also, bicycles were taken away.",
        "Q: Only from Jews again?",
        "A: The bicycles were \u2014 but the first order of confiscation thing \u2014 and you got a\nnumber \u2014 they were so organized during it, they had the number to give you when\nApril 21, 2011\nthey took the radio away. And just to give you an idea of the importance of the\nradio, when we got married in 1938, part of the family got together, in order to be\nable to buy us a radio. My parents didn\u2019t have a radio, because it was too costly. So\nhow you explain to young people today \u2014 I always mention that, and once when I\nspoke to another place, one of the teachers had slides that 1n German this \u2014 they did\nthat, take away the radios. But my son-in-law Freddie, who is from Austria, he said\n\u2014 he lived in an apartment building, and he said he was not 10, because at 10 he left\nalready for England, and he said they had a German neighbor, and he got a radio,\nbecause that\u2019s the only way you heard Hitler\u2019s speeches. Where in Belgium was\njust the opposite. But it\u2019s very di \u2014\n[break]",
        "A: \u2014 fficult for young people who just, you know, have in their pocket, and\ntechnology so advance, while you and I are even talking.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s very hard for a person to imagine to be completely cut off, to have no\nmeans of communication, not know what the outside world is. That\u2019s so not the\ncurrent kind of experience that most modern people ex \u2014 have, you know? It\u2019s \u2014 you\nhave to make an effort to be cut off, to go away and turn off your computer and turn\noff your mobile phone, but it\u2019s your choice. It\u2019s not taken from you. And 1n this\ncase, your means of knowing of what was going on in the outside world was taken.\nSo \u2014 so you didn\u2019t know if your husband survived or didn\u2019t survive?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: No, we only learn about that tragedy after the war.",
        "Q: So you were \u2014 and that unknowing, that adds stress too, that adds fear, too.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I\u2019m so surprised that my brain 1s \u2014 didn\u2019t take a off \u2014 tension? It \u2014 it\nwas just like we were wired and the wires gonna just explode.",
        "Q: Did your daughter notice this? I mean, she\u2019s a toddler, she\u2019s a baby. And\ndaughters \u2014 children notice how parents \u2014",
        "A: She was the happiest child you want to know. She walked at nine months, under\nthe table. She was singing for her food, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.",
        "Q: So she was oblivious, thankfully oblivious.",
        "A: Thank God.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And she loved my mother. There\u2019s a picture here, I think I have it, home, her and\nmy mother at the age of two.",
        "Q: We can look at those \u2014",
        "A: There\u2019s some pictures here which are much better than those.",
        "Q: Let me take a look at that. I\u2014",
        "A: When she hugs my mother on the balcony where they living. My mother used to\nsing with her.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Yeah? She would \u2014 I see that picture. So, remind me again, right in 1940, your\nparent \u2014 I\u2014 I know you talked about your father being arrested in 1942, but did their\nlives change much in 1940?",
        "A: Sure, they had to wear the yellow star. And \u2014",
        "Q: Star. Okay. Could he still earn a living through working with the community, or\nnot?",
        "A: Well, at that time the organizations were trying to help, because don\u2019t forget,\nthey were still conducting funerals, and that\u2019s why they were together. You know,\nhow you just \u2014 the more and more \u2014 this \u2014 this is in me, and I have a hard time. How\ndid those people survive those agony, the daily agony, I think? The daily fears. And\nyou didn\u2019t know if next minute you gonna be arrested.",
        "Q: When did the arrests start?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: When did the arrests start?",
        "A: Oh, the arrests start in 1940.",
        "Q: So fast?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yeah, they were very well organized.",
        "Q: And were Jews arrested en masse, or were simply certain people picked out?",
        "A: Wherever. We were hounded like dogs. Standing in line in the grocery place,\ngoing on the tram. It was easy for them.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Did you get an order at one point that \u2014",
        "A: We all got orders to report for work, and many of my friends who were not\nmarried at the time reported for work. Not only they reported for work, they had to\nbring certain items to work. And don\u2019t forget that was 1940, where many people\nwere just \u2014 who had money, bought things and to be able to sell it. I was selling all\nthe clothes from my husband.",
        "Q: They were brou \u2014 what \u2014 what was the purpose of these items that they had to\nbring to work? They had to give them up to the \u2014 to the \u2014",
        "A: Of course. And of course we never heard of them. None of my school friends had\nsurvived.",
        "Q: So that means when they reported to work \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 it wasn\u2019t really work.",
        "A: Of course it wasn\u2019t, but we didn\u2019t know then. The order to come to work was the\norder of what to bring for them to work.",
        "Q: So they just disappeared from your life?",
        "A: You know, this is why today, with mainly American friends, they talk about I\nwent to school there \u2014 like I belong to an organization which is called Coming of\nAge, to encourage seniors to remain in their place. And they have different program,\nmainly lunches, shows, and just a matter of getting people together before they have\nApril 21, 2011\nto go to assisted living or have to live with somebody else to be helped. You know, I\nwent to school in the Bronx, I went to school in New York, and they still talk about\nthat period, which is wonderful. But I can\u2019t describe \u2014 I don\u2019t have that. I don\u2019t have\nthat conversation. And we were very close with our friends. I had two friends, they\nhad money, a lot. They hired somebody to take them to Switzerland. And some\npeople managed, and they arrived. But those two, with their brothers, wer \u2014 the\nmoney was taken, they never made it in Switzerland, and then after we learned that\neverything was taken, then \u2014",
        "Q: They were betrayed, in other words.",
        "A: Exactly. There was a lot of betrayal, a lot. Like my father would never be\ndiscovered if somebody would not betray them.",
        "Q: Fanny, describe for me the \u2014 I\u2019m finding it hard to un \u2014 understand the overall\ndanger. I know that it\u2019s existed and so on, but I\u2019m trying to get a sense of, when you\nwent out in the morning to go buy milk for Josy, yeah, did you fee \u2014",
        "A: Which wasn\u2019t often, and we didn\u2019t go in the morning. We ta \u2014 we have find out \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 where more guards are in that street, or in this street. Don\u2019t forget, those were\nneighborhoods, with neighborhood stores.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Okay, so you would find out what place was guarded, and what \u2014 so does this\nmean that every time you stepped out of your apartment, you were in danger that\nyou could be arrested and not come back\u2019?",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely.",
        "Q: From day one?",
        "A: Oh yes. Which has happened. But they made it easy, because they send out\nworking sheets, for people to report to certain places.",
        "Q: Did you ever get such a working sheet for you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Why do you think that didn\u2019t happen? You don\u2019t know. You may not have been\non a register.",
        "A: I was. That\u2019s the only way you \u2014 you could get your food stamps, and that\u2019s the\nonly way that you bought your star.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: You had to have money, buy your star and get the food st \u2014 the \u2014 the coupons, in\norder to buy food.",
        "Q: And in 1942, when your father was arrested, what made that particularly \u2014 beca \u2014\nhe was arrested simply for being Jewish in that place, you know, in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in\nthe circle of people. Had he not gone that day to that meeting, would have he been\nsafe for one more day? Is that \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Probably. I don\u2019t know, maybe.",
        "Q: And remind me again, it was to discuss the funeral of somebody in the\ncommunity, and there were a group of people who gathered together, and all of them\nwere arrested?",
        "A: Yeah. Including the rabbi\u2019s two granddaughters. But they were taken to\nBreendonk.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And what is Breendonk?",
        "A: Breendonk was a torture camp \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 in Belgium, which they took the Jewish people, they tortured them, and then\nthey send them to Auschwitz, which we didn\u2019t know that name, but they were dead\nalready, before they got to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: How do you know that?",
        "A: Because I went to Belgium, they had a reunion of survivors and children of\nsurvivors. Children of survivors who were already 10 - 12 and grew up in hiding.\nWhat\u2019s happening to them, their mental state, 1t \u2014 it just \u2014 1t just unbelievable what\nhas happened to people off the sca \u2014 and of the danger.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, those were people who were normal people living normal lives, either\nschool or working or being married, or trying to get married, and all of a sudden \u2014\nApril 21, 2011\nand they were lucky that they wound up in hiding, but that has affected their lives.\nThey antisocial. Many couldn\u2019t have a relationship to marry, and many have many\nmore problems. They had a reunion quite a number of years ago in Belgium and I\nwent. I don\u2019t know, did you know a Flora Singer?",
        "Q: I\u2019ve heard of her yes, yes.",
        "A: She was very much involve and we \u2014 we went. And it \u2014",
        "Q: You went. And is that when you found out about what happened to your father?",
        "A: No, we knew \u2014",
        "Q: You said that they died before Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you know about how they died?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: We only know when we came, because we cou \u2014 we had a choice to go to\nBreendonk, and today Breendonk is a museum where they still have the tools what\nthey have used \u2014",
        "Q: In torture.",
        "A: \u2014 to torture the Jews. Not only the tools, but there\u2019s a voice of what they were\ndoing and what they were doing it.",
        "Q: I see.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: And nobody has ever come out alive from Breendonk, and it\u2019s still a museum\ntoday.",
        "Q: So I want to go back to your father\u2019s fate. You heard about what happened to him\nthrough your mother, or through somebody else?",
        "A: We only knew that they were arrested, we would \u2014 never knew of deportations.\nWe only knew people who were \u2014 got those sheets to go to work, but we didn\u2019t\nknow of deportations. Like I have learn about the deportations when I was working\nwith Steven.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: The time and the dates and how many people on each one. And that\u2019s how I have\nlearned, through the German young woman, the reporter, about all those things\nwhich \u2014 which has happened.",
        "Q: Okay, I think we\u2019re gonna take a break.",
        "A: Yep. [break]",
        "Q: Okay, so Fanny, I wanted to ask a few questions for clarification. I wanted to get\na sense of what was it like personally \u2014 as a person who is Jewish when the invasion\nhappened. How did you go from feeling fear to actually experiencing the danger?\nHow did things become more and more dangerous? Can you take us through some\nof those steps?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: As soon each day were passing, we were more frightened, more \u2014 petrified would\nbe better words.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because we were not prepared for that, specially we have been advised that we\nwould not be occupied, so we were still hoping that things would remain as normal,\nif you could use the word normal for such a situation. But it didn\u2019t happen, so \u2014 an \u2014",
        "Q: So \u2014 what were the f \u2014 [technical adjustments] Sorry Fanny, the \u2014 you were\npetrified, and wa \u2014",
        "A: Of the unknown.",
        "Q: Of the unknown. Ho \u2014 what started to become known? How did things start to\nget to be known about what your situation was? What happened?",
        "A: Okay, first of all it started out that the Germans in big trucks passed different\nneighborhoods with loudspeaker and announcing of the different rules they gonna\nhave. And if we are not gonna obey, we gonna be punished. The first assignment\nwas to take our radios, to bring them to a different destination. Then also the Jewish\norganizations has had our yellow stars, which we had to buy. We also had to collect\nour food stamps, and with those stamps you are allowed to buy whatever any store\nhad available, but you had to have the food stamps in order to buy. The Germans\nstarted to \u2014 and people lined up 1n different little store. Don\u2019t forget there was not\nlike a big shopping center or a big food market you go today with the list and you\nApril 21, 2011\nbuy whatever you need. You could only buy certain thing. And in Belgium they still\nhad small stores, and each stores had different products to sell. So you know one day\nthis store is gonna have certain thing, and that this day another store is gonna have\nthe \u2014 have thing. And the Germans started to check the people in line, and you never\nknow who was gonna be checked, and you never knew which store is gonna be\nchecked. So you see, our fear \u2014 there must be a better word than I use, fear, because\nit was more than just fear. Because you were just looking in the side or on the back\nof \u2014 if somebody is following you. And another thing what the Germans did already\nin the beginning on, in Belgium they had street cars. There\u2019s an entrance and an\nexit, so what they were doing, one soldier at the exit, one at the entrance, and in\nbetween time to check people. They started to do that at the end of 1940. In the\nbeginning people were using the streetcar and whenever you saw somebody coming\nup, you went down on the other side. But this way you had no chance of going there,\nor going there.\nAnd after you \u2014",
        "Q: And if they check you and they find you, what happens?",
        "A: Well, they haven\u2019t found me, not at that time. And many others they did. And a\nfriend of mine who was on one of those cars, and there were a lot of people so she\nwas standing and holding on where you stand here on a streetcar, and she got so\nApril 21, 2011\nscared, and she wanted to jump off it and she fell off 1t and got killed on the spot,\njumping off. Because \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you could say it\u2019s fear, was more \u2014",
        "Q: Terror, it sounds like.",
        "A: \u2014 than fear.",
        "Q: It sounds like terror.",
        "A: Terror is the word, I couldn\u2019t find that one. We were really terrorized. And also\nthere was a time when we had to put our radios to a certain destination.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that made it even worse, because then it cut completely off communication.\nAnd that\u2019s the only communication we had in Belgium from the outside world, and\nwe didn't have the radio. And then they confiscated the bicycles.",
        "Q: Fanny, as this \u2014 as th \u2014 as \u2014 [technical interruption] Okay. As the months went\nby, how did it come \u2014 occur to you, how did it come into your mind that maybe you\nhad to give Josy away\u201d",
        "A: Oh, that was not til my father was taken away. That really made up the decision\nfor me, if I wanted or not.",
        "Q: I see, so \u2014",
        "A: Because I could never imagine if that\u2019s a possibility. Somehow I felt those people\nwould be protected, and I didn't know. So once my father was taken away in \u00b042, I\nreally had absolutely no choice, but I still couldn\u2019t make up a decision.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Did you talk about this with your mother?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: With your sisters?",
        "A: Not very much.",
        "Q: So \u2014 what did your sisters do, sh \u2014 her \u2014 she had two boys, yes?",
        "A: At that time she had already three.",
        "Q: She had three boys.",
        "A: Yes. And before she went to work in the basement of the church, they took the\nthree boys away in hiding. Because the same group who put them \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 in the particular job, they had them.",
        "Q: I see, so \u2014 so her sons were in hiding and as far as she knew, they were safe?",
        "A: Her boys?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Hopefully, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You know, even putting a child in hiding, you still didn't know.",
        "Q: Of course not.",
        "A: Because we didn\u2019t know anything. And another thing, we were not allowed to\nknow where those children would be put into hiding, because 1n case we would be\nApril 21, 2011\narrested, or stopped, we used to call 1t, we would be beaten and probably give out\nthe names. And that was the reason of not knowing \u2014",
        "Q: So wa \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 where the children would be.",
        "Q: So in some ways the \u2014 your sister had already done this, she had already given\nher children to the \u2014",
        "A: But it was differently [indecipherable]. Don\u2019t forget, she was with her husband\nthrough the time, so there was two people deciding, and they couldn\u2019t keep the three\nboys together if they wanted to go to work.",
        "Q: I see. T \u2014 in the resistance movement.",
        "A: In the resistant movements, and their job was in that basement, which they\nhaven\u2019t gone out from \u00b040 til the end of \u201944 when Belgium was liberated. They were\nmaking false papers. They were also making exchange of ammunition. People knew\nwhere to deposit whatever they had to deposit and pick up what has to be pick up.\nEven without names this was \u2014 that\u2019s why it was so difficult, and that\u2019s why\nBelgium was very lucky that the resistant, with Jewish people and non-Jewish\npeople had been working together. And because of that, and the dedication of so\nmany brave and \u2014 and kind people, so many, like I said before, 4,000 Jewish chil-\nchildren were able to be saved. Don\u2019t forget among the children saved were also\nchildren who came previously from Belgium and from \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Germany.",
        "A: \u2014 Austria and Germany.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So wha \u2014",
        "A: So for small country, the more you think about it today, and the more and more\npeople study the history of that period of time, it\u2019s hard for them even to imagine the\npossibility of people, who knowing \u2014 they had big signs or posters on each corners,\nif we find a Jewish person, the person\u2019s gonna be shot for hiding a Jew. And they\ndid that, killing people. Some teachers have been arrested because they were \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014\nit was easier for them to hide some children. So it\u2019s really unbelievably like a\nmiracle, you would say \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 to be able to save that number of children in a very small country, because\nBelgium is about the size of New Jersey. Food was rationed and there was no\nmoney exchanged, and pille \u2014 people were willing to risk their lives.",
        "Q: But still, when it comes to your own baby, I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine it, being a\nmother myself, I can\u2019t imagine it, particularly when my child would be so young.",
        "A: Unbelievable. I still today have the pain of her crying and leaving, can you\nbelieve that? You ca \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 you can\u2019t say that, because we didn't know if the\ndecision we made was right or not. We didn\u2019t know what ever gonna happen to us.\nWe never know who\u2019s gonna take care of mine child, my precious child.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: You describe Josy as a baby of being a very happy baby.",
        "A: Very much so, because everybody just loves her.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: She used to sing for her supper at the age of one.",
        "Q: How sweet, how sweet.",
        "A: That\u2019s why you see that picture, she and my mother.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: When she used to get \u2014 I used to make her clothes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And whenever she got something new she used to come to my mother. And she\ndidn\u2019t speak at that time, but she was just showing her, like this.",
        "Q: Her new clothes. And was this the first time that she had ever been with a\nstranger, even?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: So she had never seen strangers before, everyone in her world, she had known?",
        "A: Correct. Except the two ladies who came, and also friends who came til she was\nthree. So she had seen people with me, and people with her.",
        "Q: But the first time she\u2019s taken by somebody \u2014 so why would she cry? Why w \u2014",
        "A: Because, number one, she didn\u2019t want to leave me. Not only crying, screaming,\nshe didn't want to go. And also, she was not allowed to take a toy, because we were\nApril 21, 2011\n\u2014 you know, we were afraid in case somebody would see somebody with the child\nand the toy, it would become suspicious.",
        "Q: Did you know the ladies who took her?",
        "A: No, never met them.",
        "Q: Okay. So they really were strangers.",
        "A: Completely, to both of us.",
        "Q: Do you remember what they looked like?",
        "A: Yeah, I think I would recognize if I would see them today, because this is so\nimpact in you subconscious that you see \u2014 like I\u2019m sitting now and talking with you,\nI still have heart-beatings of that period, of that moment, just her leaving me and\ncrying. They were lovely, nice ladies.",
        "Q: Were they older, younger?",
        "A: I think they were older than me, because don\u2019t forget, that was about \u2014 very\nyoung time for me.",
        "Q: You were like 24 - 25, something like that, yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: An they would have been maybe 30 - 40?",
        "A: Maybe about \u2014 yes, you right.",
        "Q: Something \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: But you see, again, I don\u2019t look at them of any age, I look at them just as people\nwho have tried to help, if that\u2019s the word. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did they seem kind? When you met them, did they seem kind, or did they seem \u2014",
        "A: They had to be, otherwise they could never get the child, otherwise the child\nwould cry or scream all the way, til they would be someplace. And another thing\nwhich was very difficult, because we were not allowed to know where those\nchildren would be taken, because in case we would be caught, and by beating, and of\ncourse you would tell anything, no matter what.",
        "Q: Was it in the daytime, in \u2014 at \u2014 in the evening? What happen \u2014 was it in the\nmorning when Josy was taken?",
        "A: It was daytime, after lunch.",
        "Q: It must have been aw \u2014",
        "A: I guess they were waiting, you know, for the child to be fed. You know,\neverything was just like when you think now, it makes so much sense of the actions\nor whatever they were doing, on such an important time, or unbelievable time 1n our\nlives. Or undescribable words, I can\u2019t find words of describing such a trauma.",
        "Q: How do you \u2014 when did \u2014 were you alone afterwards, or did \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s why I collapsed.",
        "Q: You collapsed after.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I chose in the movie I was telling you \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 about that schoolteacher in Poland who was saving children.",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: And they showed in that documentary, how one of the mothers, and she took\naway her child, how she collapsed and couldn\u2019t breathe and couldn\u2019t move for a\nlong time. Because you \u2014 there 1s \u2014 for me anyway, there\u2019s no words I could\ndescribe such emotions. They\u2019re painful emotions really, unless there\u2019s another\nword. I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did your mother and sisters know that this would happen?",
        "A: No, only my mother knew.",
        "Q: I see. And did you \u2014",
        "A: But sh \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 did she come to you or did you \u2014 were you able to go to her soon afterwards?",
        "A: No, I waited a few ta \u2014 a few days, because I was not able even to move. This\nhad such a impact, which 1s still with me today. I still hear the cry. And I had no way\nof helping her. It\u2019s not when you have a child and falling and you take the child and\nyou kiss to make good.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That was not what you could do.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Couldn\u2019t. You couldn\u2019t do it. When you were able at least to start functioning\nagain, how did your life go on?",
        "A: How you call functioning?",
        "Q: Functioning means you got up, you had something to eat, you started to invol \u2014\nyou know how did your life pick up after you gave Josy away?",
        "A: It just didn\u2019t pick up.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: It couldn\u2019t pick up, because li \u2014 you all lives, it\u2019s not the same life you had\nbefore, because all of a sudden you just one, and you don\u2019t have a child to hug, or a\nchild to hug you. So this is the hardest thing. You really have to try to continue\nbreathing or continue living. Thanks.",
        "Q: When you need another [inaudible] I guess what I want to ask 1s, what happened\nto you in the days and the weeks afterwards? What \u2014 how did your life continue?\nWhat were the events that took place in 1t?",
        "A: It continue and started to worry us more. Don\u2019t forget, like I told you, my father\nwas already taken away and the whole concept of life is already different thinking.\nWhat\u2019s gonna happen within a minute? We don\u2019t know, because we were like\nchased, like you chase a dog sometime, and we didn\u2019t know where the drop would\nbe. We didn\u2019t. Because it just seem according to other countries, that in Belgium\nthey were a little different, the Nazis, because they knew that the Belgium people\nApril 21, 2011\nwould help us \u2014 much help it would be available. Although in Belgium we had an\norganization, the black shirts, who were working with the Nazis and helping the\nNazis deport the Jews, because many of those people who have denounced the Jews,\nwhatever it was, in the house, in their place, it was taken by the Germans. And\nanybody who has denounced the Jews got part of that \u2014 whatever they were able to\nsteal and take away.",
        "Q: So there was an incentive? There was a \u2014",
        "A: Only if you were that kind of a person.",
        "Q: \u2014 of a person.",
        "A: But then again, how could you put the two together, when you have so many\npeople of any background, of any religion, who were willing to risk their lives, just\nto sha \u2014 to save one child?",
        "Q: It was in 1942 then, what month was it that your father was arrested?",
        "A: In the month of August.",
        "Q: And when \u2014 what month was it that you gave Josy away?",
        "A: I think 1t was October.",
        "Q: So, as 1942 go \u2014 you know, comes to an end, are you still in Brussels?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Are you still in your apartment?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: I was still in the apartment, this was the [indecipherable] the decision of me\ngoing into hiding, and my mother going into hiding.",
        "Q: How did you do that, what did you do? You stayed within your own homes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how did you get fed? Did other people go and \u2014 and bring you food?",
        "A: No, we tried to get food.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: As much it was possible, and as much we try not to be caught. Because this is\nwhat the Nazis did, they organized. And they had a documentary about two months\nago, from France which is called the raffier(ph), which really means the round-up.\nHow they have collected and taking the Jews from France, which was the same\norder as they did it in Belgium.",
        "Q: And so you were trying to avoid this raffier(ph) that \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Everybody did.",
        "Q: What happened after that, in the winter of 1943, anything?",
        "A: Well, in 1943 I went into hiding. My mother was working 1n a old age home, and\nshe was able to stay there. But being in hiding I \u2014 I was hiding in a small farm,\nwhich was run by an elderly couple. And the brother of \u2014 of Constant(ph) lived\nApril 21, 2011\nwith them. Very kind people. Very old, compare to me, but they were very kind.\nTheir main purpose of keeping that little farm was just the chickens so they would\nhave eggs. And they were exchanging some of the eggs with another farm for\nsomething else. They would \u2014",
        "Q: How did you get to know these people in the farm?",
        "A: Through the underground.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: The same people who took Josiane, they got other people in contact, and they\ngot other people in contact. It was just a big circle \u2014",
        "Q: Network, yeah.",
        "A: Or whatever, I don\u2019t know, you prob \u2014",
        "Q: Network.",
        "A: Network.",
        "Q: Network of people.",
        "A: Which of course we didn\u2019t know that word either. And it didn\u2019t exist, because\nwithout radios and without telephone and with any kind of communication, it just is\na miracle, if that\u2019s what you want to call it. An unbelievable way of putting that in\nyour mind, what people could do to save or to help other people, in spite of all the\nevil all around us. And all those people have been warned, in case they would find\nJewish people. But in sp \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: So this wasn\u2019t \u2014 excuse me.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: Okay. This was an elderly couple?",
        "A: Very elderly couple.",
        "Q: And how far was their farm from your home in Brussels?",
        "A: Not far, was in Vlazenberg(ph).",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t far. They had special buses.",
        "Q: What do you mean by special buses?",
        "A: I mean regular buses, but there was a larger bus and not going from one place to\nthe other as often as regular probably, transportation. And loneliness \u2014",
        "Q: Did you get there by bus?",
        "A: No, it was streetcars.",
        "Q: I see. So you took streetcars?",
        "A: Yes. And sometime I used to meet my mother, because loneliness, not having my\nmother, not having my child is like my whole soul went out of me. I don\u2019t even have\nthe proper words to express such a despair, because we didn\u2019t know if the next day\nis gonna be better. Sometime people are depressed and have problem, and they\nknow maybe next day or next week things are gonna be better, but we didn\u2019t have\nthat to \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 okay. [break] Okay, Fanny, when \u2014 when you were describing that\nutter despair of not having your child, of being alone. Your husband is gone, your\nmother is in hiding, your father has been arrested. Your sister \u2014 your older sister is\nunderground, at least in the church building, working on \u2014 in \u2014 in activities that you\ndidn\u2019t know about at the time. You say that you come from an Orthodox family, did\nyou feel yourself to be very religious?",
        "A: It was very, very confusing, with many questions and no answers.",
        "Q: Did you feel like your faith in God had been shaken?",
        "A: Not only that, you had the feeling of such emptiness and helplessness, you could\njust cry to God with many questions and of course, no answers. You really start\nfeeling, is this being punished because we Jewish? But we were good people, it\u2019s not\n\u2014 and it was extremely painful, because you didn\u2019t get an answer, and you just had\nquestions. Like my father and the rabbi taken, because in the rabbi\u2019s house, he had \u2014\nthe son has already gone, but he had a daughter-in-law with two small children, and\nalso taken at the same time.",
        "Q: And how to figure all that out, why is it happening, why \u2014",
        "A: We don\u2019t know, we still questioning.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I think much learned people still have the same question today when it\ncomes to religion. Everybody else has a defin \u2014 different opinion and a different\nApril 21, 2011\nfeeling about. And many rabbis today don\u2019t know the answer either and have a hard\ntime of answering the people who have been asking the same questions.",
        "Q: This elderly couple that you were with, were they people that you could share\nany of this with, or were you silent with them?",
        "A: Completely silent because you can\u2019t convey a pain in you which you can\u2019t\nexpress, because nobody would be there. Like when a child falls and you just kiss it\nfor better, and then it does get better, but we know that nothing is gonna get better\nand we didn\u2019t know how much worse it\u2019s gonna get for us. In our wildest nightmare\nwe couldn\u2019t even imagine that there\u2019s a place like hell on earth.",
        "Q: Well let\u2019s, unfortunately, go there. How long did you stay at this farm, this \u2014",
        "A: From the end of 42, til winter of \u201943, I went and we met, my mother and I. The\nattic was already empty at that particular time.",
        "Q: Where the resistance people used to be?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: That \u2014 that \u2014 the attic where the resistance people \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And the couple who was there permanently and originally, they were sent on an\nassignment and they were sent on assignments previously. But this assignment, they\nnever came back. And then, after the war, we have learned that they have been\nApril 21, 2011\ncaught, and they were \u2014 been killed. But that we learned after the war. And our \u2014 my\nloneliness was to such extent that when I met my mother, we decided we gonna stay\nin the attic overnight. And I guess this was a bad decision, because either we were\nfollowed, or somebody told on us, because that attic has never been touched and\nnobody ever has been taken out. Don\u2019t forget, some of the people were there for few\nyear \u2014 for two years at least, and it has never been discovered. Anyway, the two of\nus were discovered, and we were taken by a covered truck to the Germans\nheadquarters in Avenue Louise.",
        "Q: How did \u2014 can you walk me through that \u2014 those moments? You spent one night\nin this attic?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And during that night you were discovered?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: And was it in the middle of the night that \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So what happened?",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: Were there police, were there soldiers, were there \u2014",
        "A: There were soldiers, and apparently they were making the rounds in that corner,\nbecause where we lived was not a Jewish neighborhood. They were not a Jewish\nApril 21, 2011\ncouple, but that was not like you would call a Jewish neighborhood. It was a little\nmore out of the city of Brussels.",
        "Q: So how did they know \u2014 I mean, if it was an attic \u2014",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know. Somebody must either follow us, or somebody has denounced\nus, which I think we must have been denounced.",
        "Q: So they \u2014 they knew there was an attic door and they were able to come to the\nattic door and they were able to \u2014",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: \u2014 enter? Did they need a key to get in, did they knock it down?",
        "A: No, they just knocked and woke up the \u2014 woke up the people who lived in the\nfloor below.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how they came and knock at our door.",
        "Q: How many soldiers were there?",
        "A: Well, there were two who came to the apartment, but there were other people on\nthat truck already, which they have arrested before us.",
        "Q: Were they uniformed?",
        "A: Yes, they were always wearing uniform.",
        "Q: Were they German or Belgian?",
        "A: Germans.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: Germans.",
        "A: The people who were in the black shirts in Belgium did more other kind of work\nfor the Germans. But they were part of the German army in Belgium. They were\ncalled the black shirts. They were called the Grell(ph), because he was head of that\ndepartment. And he fled when \u2014 after the war, and he was condemned to death,\nbecause he has denounced many non-Jewish Belgium people in Belgium. And for\nthat was not allowed to come back to Belgium, he was condemned to death, and\nthey were hoping to get him back from Brazil, which they have never been able to\ndo.",
        "Q: When they took you, do you remember what the soldiers acted like, what they \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 how they behaved?",
        "A: Like worried.",
        "Q: Were they screaming at you?",
        "A: Yes. And we were taken to the headquarters on Avenue Louise in Brussels\nwhere the headquarters were.",
        "Q: The Gestapo headquarters?",
        "A: Yes, in Avenue Louise, that was their headquarters. And we were badly beaten\nup, mainly on the face and the mouth. This was their priority when they were\nbeating on people. And we stayed overnight because we were both bleeding. Don\u2019t\nApril 21, 2011\nforget, my mother wasn\u2019t 50, and \u2014 and the next day we were taken, also by the\nsame covered trucks, we were taken to Malines which is called Mechelen in\nFlemish, and that was a place of some \u2014 where all people were gathering. And when\nthey had a certain number, they were transporting those people, and we didn\u2019t know\nto where or what. And I think this is why it scared us constantly, is the fear of not\nknowing. Because I think we young people, if we would have even suspect what hell\nis, we knew it from reading, but we didn\u2019t know the real existence of hell, I think we\nwould all killed ourself, if we would know that there\u2019s such a hell as Auschwitz.\nAfter three days \u2014 oh, and then we all got the number which was hanged on our\nneck, with the number, and on our cattle train there was \u2014",
        "Q: So you were put from the truck to a \u2014 to a train station?",
        "A: No, from the truck we were taken to Malines. We stayed for 10 days there, and\napparently they collected enough people to put on the cattle train to be transported to\nAuschwitz, which we didn\u2019t know Auschwitz, we never heard that name in our life.",
        "Q: Did you know that you \u2014 did they say Auschwitz before they put you on the train",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 or you did \u2014 you didn\u2019t know where you were going?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: No, we didn't even know where we going, and we didn\u2019t know the meaning of\nAuschwitz, we never heard that word. But on the cattle train, what we discovered is\nthat they had 110 people on the cattle train and I\u2019m sure you saw the train.",
        "Q: Where were you? Were you in one corner, were you up above, were you down\nbelow?",
        "A: We were about in the middle.",
        "Q: Were you in a bunk?",
        "A: There were no bunks on the train.",
        "Q: There were no bunks?",
        "A: No, you just had to stand or to lean on one another. You couldn\u2019t sit down, you\ncouldn\u2019t lie down. And we had two buckets, one with water and one for the latrine. I\ncan\u2019t even describe to you that voyage on the cattle train. The scream, the prayers in\nany language, and the cry and screaming. The worst thing was the cries of the\nbabies. And finally we arrived in Auschwitz. It was pitch black. Then they have\nthose big light \u2014 flashlight like you see sometime when they open a business, or for\nthe movies when they showing. And from 110 people, 40 people came out alive.\nFrom the 40 people we don\u2019t know how many came to the camp. Women with\nchildren who came out alive, the soldiers greet us with barking dogs. They told to\nthe young women to drop the child. And she says, I go where my child goes. So he\nshot \u2014 he shot with his own revolver the baby, and first the mother start screaming,\nApril 21, 2011\nand he shot the mother on the way falling down to the baby. Now you could\nunderstand when I say that this is never going to go out of my soul til my dying\ndays. The screaming of the baby before it was dead, and the mother before she died.\nAnd this was done many times.",
        "Q: You all \u2014 when they open up the train and you let \u2014 you\u2019re let out of the train and\nthat\u2019s your introduction to Auschwitz.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And then we had to form li \u2014 lines, one for men and one for women.\nAnd in the line where I was with the women, my mother was with me, then he\nseparated my mother from me, and I knew being together we gonna help or being\nable to help one another. But while the soldier was ma \u2014 walking down, I slipped\nover to be with my mother. And I was hit over the head, if I tell you to stay here,\nthen that\u2019s what you stay. And that was the last time I saw my wonderful mother\nalive. Then we had to form lines, and from the line I was on, we were taken to a\nfreezing room, and we had all to, in front of soldiers with their dogs, we had to\nundress completely. And I tried to explain to you that we all came from decent\nhome, and we have never undressed in front of strangers. Not only because we had\nto get undressed, but we were checked if we were hiding thing in our private parts.\nAfter that long wait, we were given uniforms and wooden shoes. Then we went and\nwe had numbers tattooed on our arm, and we had our head shaved. And finally we\nwent to the shower, with screams and crying, hold onto one another. And finally,\nApril 21, 2011\nafter the shower, we got one blanket for six people and we were put into barracks.\nThe barracks consisted of shelves covered with straw, and one blanket for six\npeople. Besides crying and hugging one another, and still not realizing the hell we\nwere on, and then we fell asleep. And the net \u2014 and the next day we were called to\nline up, and we lined up, and our group went to work into a ammunition factory,\nwhere the air was impossible to breathe because of the chemicals. We were cleaning\nand the fume was bad. We worked there for 12 hours, then we marched back to our\nbarrack where we got soup which was like water, and a slice of bread which didn\u2019t\neven taste like bread. And again, we were counted, and at that time, before we were\nallowed to go to the barracks, we learned where our loved ones went and then we\nsaw the crematorium, and the smoke out of that.",
        "Q: Who told you? Was it \u2014 was it other inmates who told you? Was it the camp\nguards who told you?",
        "A: No, we had just above us somebody who was in charge of us to make sure we\nbehave, and they told us. And then we saw the fumes.",
        "Q: So these were other inmates, too?",
        "A: Yes, sure. But they \u2014 they are the ones who were dividing the soup, and they are\nthe ones who divided the bread we got.",
        "Q: Was there anyone on that train that you knew besides your mother, who was in\nthat cattle car?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Oh yeah, many people. And Steven got me a list of names of people who got to\nAuschwitz. The people who went right away to the gas chambers, their names are\nnot on the list. Only the people who came into Auschwitz, their names 1s on the list.\nAnd of course, my mother\u2019s name is not.",
        "Q: Were you completely then, without any acquaintances?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Without anybody \u2014",
        "A: But the six of us became like family, because we had nobody, really nobody.\nNobody has anybody in Auschwitz. It\u2019s a word which I can describe \u2014 I can\u2019t find\nword. The only person who was able to describe Auschwitz is Primo Levi. I don\u2019t\nknow if you ever read any of his books. He was an engineer from Italy. He was\nalready an engineer when he was caught and deported to Auschwitz. He\u2019s the only\nperson who was able to describe Auschwitz, really, really how it was.",
        "Q: Do you remember the date you entered Auschwitz?",
        "A: In 40 \u2014 the end of 44.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the date you entered Auschwitz?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: So you wer \u2014 managed to \u2014 you managed to not be caught for \u2014 until 1944?",
        "A: No, not really, because every month \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 regardless how cold it was \u2014 this is \u2014 was the \u2014 the \u2014 the biggest\n[indecipherable] of the Germans, always lining up. Because there were five women\nworking in the ammunition factory who stood \u2014 we had little bombs with holes, and\nwe had to clean those hole, because the next department were putting in small, small\nballs in the holes, so it explodes when they needed it. So they sabotaged and they\nstole those. And you know where they hid it? They hid it in their mouth.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: And then one crematorium did explode. And it was only for overnight, but at\nleast there were a few people less to be gassed at that particular time. But all those\nfive women were caught, and they were hanged. And the whole camp had to stay for\n24 hours, til those five women died hanging.",
        "Q: And you had to stand and see this.",
        "A: Everybody had to stand and watch those people die. It\u2019s interesting that not too\nlong ago, on channel 26, they were showing \u2014",
        "Q: This is the educational channel.",
        "A: \u2014 and one woman who has survived was telling the same thing I was telling you,\nwhat has happened to those five women. So this was recorded and people talk about\nit. | was sitting in front the TV and I couldn\u2019t believe that other people are hearing\nthe things we went through, because don\u2019t forget, I was still very young. And in\nbetween I already had the medical experimentation. Because while we were checked\nApril 21, 2011\nif we had lice, Mengele was his visit always, and he picked one or two or how many\nhe want at each time. And one of his visits, I was picked. And I was taken, tied to a\nbed, things were taken from me, which I still don\u2019t know what parts were taken.\nAnother thing, which I didn\u2019t mention before, a month after we were in Auschwitz,\nnone of the women had their periods any more, because, can you imagine thousands\nof women being there and having their periods monthly? None of us had their\nperiods any more. But of course, having had the medical experimentation, it was\nsuch a tremendous impact on each and every one. There\u2019s one book here on the fifth\nfloor, which 20 women who have survived medical experimentation in\nRavensbriick have written a book.",
        "Q: When this was done, Fanny, and you were taken and you say you were tied to a\nbed?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Were you given any kind of narcotic medication?",
        "A: You \u2014 of course not.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh.",
        "A: Of course not. They did that to thousands of women. And another thing I have\nlearned, that the cher \u2014 Germans made experimentation in Auschwitz on babies. I\ndidn\u2019t know that. You see, here at the museum, a little over a year ago, they had the\nseminar. Physicians or people who study medication from different countries in\nApril 21, 2011\nEurope. There were 12 people, and I think they stayed here about 10 days. The\ninteresting thing is, I couldn\u2019t understand til afterwards why I was chosen as a\nspeaker to those people. Only because all those people have studied German\nmedicine for the past 200 years, and what they were doing on us, they started to do\nthat 200 years ago. Sterilization, abortion. What you call when men are being\nsterilized, there\u2019s a man in my \u2014",
        "Q: A vasectomy. A vasectomy.",
        "A: No, there\u2019s another word. It\u2019s gonna come afterward. There\u2019s three things that the\nGermans did. Hundreds of years ago, if a family in Germany had a child and they\nfelt that that child is not perfect, they used to have an institution where they gave\ntheir child away. When that child, or adult for that matter, died, the family just got a\nnotice, your so and so passed away, and that was it. Nobody has ever questioned it,\nbecause everybody had to be perfect in Germany, and if the \u2014 they were not, they\nwere taken to those institutions. And that\u2019s why, when they had the seminar here,\nthey came to the museum, because of the background they have already learned,\nwhat the Germans did, hundreds \u2014 sterilization. Couldn\u2019t think of it.",
        "Q: So, sto \u2014",
        "A: So this has already started 200 years ago, which they tried to do on us today.",
        "Q: How could you stand the pain?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: And they have books about that, and I took a book out because I wanted to show,\nwhen they had the seminar. But they were ahead of me, because they are the ones\nwho taught me what has happened 200 years ago. So this now is just \u2014 like they\nhave one book which is called \u201cThe Nazi Doctors.\u201d People want to know, why was\nit possible, for educated people? It\u2019s not like today a bunch of hoodlums want your\nmoney and they kill you just for the money. This was organized by excellent\nphysicians, nurses, educated people. How could they have done the horrors they\ndid? I tell you another thing what happened Auschwitz and what the Germans did.\nThey had part of the camp where they had Gypsies collected from Europe. What\nthey have decided and what they have done, there were women, were children and\nmen. They decide that the men should lined up for the following day and that they\u2019re\ngonna be taken to work. Meanwhile, they have given milk to the children of the\nwomen who they took the fathers away. A few days later they took the women and\nthe children. That was in August of 1944. And they gassed the women the following\ntwo days. In order not to fa \u2014 have a \u2014 a disturbing, they gave the babies the milk.\nCan you imagine how vicious that is, and being done by educated doctors who were\nsupposed to help people?",
        "Q: Fanny, how could you stand the pain?",
        "A: You cannot.",
        "Q: Did you pass out?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Of course, we all did. How could you?",
        "Q: I can\u2019t imagine.",
        "A: I can\u2019t even describe it, even now. My whole body is against and hurting. How\ndo you describe things like that for people who have never seen horrors? We have\nnever seen anybody being killed except through that period of time, and except\nseeing those babies being shot coming off the train. How could any normal, if\nthere\u2019s a way of calling us normal, to live that the rest of your life? You can\u2019t.\nThat\u2019s why we have \u2014 I have nightmares.",
        "Q: Still?",
        "A: Still today when a train 1s passing, I just broke out in a sweat, because it still\nbeats more. That\u2019s why I say to you, and to everybody who listens, how could\nanybody remain sane, if that\u2019s the word I could use, after seeing such horrors?",
        "Q: How did you?",
        "A: We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t. And I would never recover. And another thing\nwhich I say when I talk to people, it took me 50 years to be able to just to talk,\nbecause I still feel I\u2019m less than another person.",
        "Q: Is that what they gave you, that feeling that you were less \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely, still today. I couldn\u2019t talk about I had medical experimentation,\nbecause that would make me even less than I am already. And this was the power of\nthe Germans, besides the selections. And you \u2014 nobody ever knew who\u2019s gonna be\nApril 21, 2011\nthe next one, for any reason they have to put the person in the crematorium. There\u2019s\nanother book here, the author of the book passed away a couple years ago. There\u2019s\nonly two people, two young men from Czechoslovakia who escaped Auschwitz.\nThey describe Auschwitz, how the selections was, and they passed \u2014 the main\nreason for the young men to escape and how they escape, and those were the two\nonly ones who ever escape alive, is because they wanted to go to Czechoslovakia,\nwhere they come from, to go to different organizations, because Eichmann was\ngetting everything from the Jewish community in Hungary. Trucks, tools, just name\nit, because he was fooling the Jewish people, telling them whatever you give us,\nthen we would not have the discrimination or the deportation of the Jewish\n[indecipherable]. But it didn\u2019t happen so, because in spite of everything he took, it\nwas continuing. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really an amazing book if you could sit through and just\nread it. You have to have a lot of strength, or whatever you have in you. Because I\nwas asked by one of the physicians who were here at the seminar, asking me how far\nI was in reading the book. And I said so far I\u2019m on the second page, and I wasn\u2019t\nable to turn for the third. But I have learned from them, which they have studied and\nthey would, you know, like see how this 1s continuing with the German people. And\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s still continuing today, of the experimentation they\nhad. They were number one a few hundred years ago, did you ever hear in history\nwhen you went to school? Okay.\n100April 21, 2011",
        "Q: Fanny, I know it\u2019s \u2014 I know that this is probably one of the most painful\nsections, but I would like, if you can, to describe what you can about the room,\nabout whether you were alone in it, whether there were other women next to you \u2014",
        "A: When they made the experimentation? No, there was one at the time.",
        "Q: One person\u201d?",
        "A: One person at the time.",
        "Q: And were there nurses with you?",
        "A: Yes, there were two women.",
        "Q: So, German nurses were with you?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: And a German doctor?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Was it Mengele, was it another doctor, or you \u2014",
        "A: No, Mengele only supplied \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 the people. Mengele had s \u2014 his eyes were like evil. There\u2019s only one picture, I\nthink the only picture they have at the museum of Mengele. There was no picture,\nhe didn\u2019t want to have pictures taken.",
        "Q: And so was it a small room?\n101April 21, 2011",
        "A: Very small. I don\u2019t know if you remember, a few years ago, Elie Wiesel and\nOprah went to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Did you say \u2014 see that documentary\u201d?",
        "Q: I heard of it, yeah I heard of it, that was a \u2014",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s a documentary, and they show you the snow and they show the\nshoes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They also show \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know that til I saw that documentary, that they\nhave made experimentation on men. And I didn't know that til I saw that\ndocumentary. It \u2014 1t\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2014 and also you see shelves with little jars of whatever they\ntook from people, or whatever they put into people.",
        "Q: Do you know how long you were in that place?",
        "A: You don\u2019t, because you think it\u2019s gonna be the end your life. You think this 1s it.\nI thought that this is it.",
        "Q: This 1s it.",
        "A: And I understand what the other women describing in the book. Was the same.\nWe didn\u2019t know what was done.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you have a moment that say, you pass out and then at some point\nyou come to consciousness again?\n102April 21, 2011",
        "A: You never lose consciousness, because you\u2019re too scared. You think at \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014\nI thought, I don\u2019t know others, that this is gonna be my last moment and I have to\nhang onto it to see my last moment going out of me. You see, this 1s why it\u2019s so\ndifficult for me to stand up and to speak, because everybody had different\nexperiences. But here at the museum, of having so many survivor volunteers, I\u2019m\nthe only one who had the medical experimentation. And this is why maybe it took\nme so many years to be talking about. And like I told you, took me 50 years after I\ncame back from Auschwitz from \u2014 liberated from the Russians. I was in the hospital\na few times in Belgium. Don\u2019t forget we didn\u2019t have our period a month after we\ngot to Auschwitz, and with the experimentation it took me 50 years to be able to\ntalk about that period. But you know while they did those experimentation, it was\nlike little by little your life gets less, and you think you there already. Then you feel\nanother pain, and it\u2019s not there yet, you still have to go lower.",
        "Q: So you feel you\u2019re still alive because you still can feel pain. Not that you can feel\nanything else, but the pain tells you \u2014",
        "A: Well, another thing which was difficult for me to talk about, especially here,\nwhere you have single people, who fortunately were able to start a life again and\nhave a family. And I couldn\u2019t have children any more.\n103April 21, 2011",
        "Q: Did you have \u2014 after you were released, after you were again free \u2014 I\u2019m jumping\nahead, but I'll come back to the other topics, did you have any kind of medical help\nafter the war?",
        "A: Oh yes, I was in the hospital a few times in Belgium, and when we came to\nAmerica in \u00b049, I were twice in the hospital.",
        "Q: And were the doctors then able to find out what had happened?",
        "A: They only knew what was happened, and they only find out when we came to\nAmerica in \u201949, why I could not conceive. So you \u2014 so you see, it \u2014 it\u2019s not like a\nredeeming way of life. Like people were fortunate to start the life again, married and\nhaving families. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think it was proper for me to talk here. Cause I\ndon\u2019t know if people could put the two and two together. You can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. So how\ncould somebody else just make peace with oneself? You can\u2019t. You just can\u2019t.",
        "Q: And yet, you had a child, you were reu \u2014 reu \u2014 reunited with, and you raised her\nand she raised a child, or more than one. And as Steve said, now it\u2019s down to the\nfourth generation, and \u2014 and despite that, despite \u2014 despite it, you were able to raise\nher.",
        "A: To make a human being out of her?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Definitely. You\u2019re absolutely right. You\u2019re absolutely \u2014 not only because she\u2019s a\nhuman being, but she\u2019s a wonderful human being. And another thing which has been\n104April 21, 2011\nfound out, more and more studies are being done on us, that children of survivors\neither went into education, or went into medicine. And I tell you why I\u2019m\nmentioning that to you. I think it\u2019s very important, because now here in America,\nyou hear so much violence, you hear so many young people killing one another.\nEither students, or just in the street the gangs. So when they arrest a young person,\n14 - 15, who has been killing, the judge or whoever defends those people, feel\nbecause they didn\u2019t have a very good upbringing, that\u2019s what made them violent.\nWhat about babies born and never know the parents, like you see the program a\ncouple weeks ago, we were still looking for the pictures of children who have never\nbeen able to connect to any family, because they were in hiding, or the parents\ndidn\u2019t come back, or any family come back to claim them. But all those children\nwho have been in hiding, they definitely didn\u2019t have a good upbringing. And then in\nspite of that they all in education, or in medicine. Like my daughter, who is in\neducation, and my granddaughter is a medical si \u2014 psychiatrist.",
        "Q: An amazing achievement.",
        "A: But most children of survivors, even born after the war, went into education.",
        "Q: Fanny, it\u2019s hard to ask, you know, that sort of simple question of what happened\nthen, what happened then? I mean, you \u2014 here we are, you\u2019re in this room, you\u2019re\nbeing tortured, you\u2019re being dehumanized through this medical experimentation, and\nyou feel like it\u2019s your last moment, but it\u2019s not.\n105April 21, 2011",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did at some point they finish and then send you back to the barracks?\nDid they let you heal?",
        "A: Oh yes, and then there was another session. There never was one session.",
        "Q: It was more than one session?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: More than one time?",
        "A: Yes. And the only thing they had in thy \u2014 that room 1s like shelves with jars of\ndifferent parts, and you see that if you even watch Oprah and \u2014",
        "Q: Were those jars there when you were ha \u2014 when they were performing\nexperiments on you too?",
        "A: Yes, uh-huh, because there was already things from people before me.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection of the doctor?",
        "A: I think if I would see him today I would recognize.",
        "Q: Did they talk to you at all?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did they shout at you?",
        "A: No. They shout at us not to move.",
        "Q: They shouted at you not to move. Were there people holding you down?\n106April 21, 2011",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have to, because we were tied down. You couldn\u2019t move, even if you\nwould \u2014 wanted to.",
        "Q: When you went back \u2014 when \u2014 di \u2014 were you brought back to the barracks, or did\nyou have to walk back? Could you have \u2014",
        "A: We had to walk back to the barracks.",
        "Q: And did the other \u2014 other inmates in those barracks have an idea of what had\nbeen going on?",
        "A: Some did, some did not.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea of how long this went on?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, because we had no concept of time. It seems like endless, like I\nthink I tried to explain to you, til it\u2019s going to be the end. That\u2019s why you hold onto\nit, because you want to see your own end.",
        "Q: Was there a time when they eventually stopped, or was this \u2014 once you were\nchosen, until liberation came, you were part of this \u2014",
        "A: That was quite awhile.",
        "Q: Was it the same people all the time who were doing this, or different people?",
        "A: Well, the nurses were different, and I think the doctors were different.",
        "Q: Was this your lowest moment?",
        "A: I think so. I think so. One redeeming thing we did have, is in 1944, which was\nvery bad in Auschwitz, more beatings for no reason. We think it was for no reason,\n107April 21, 2011\nand we were still working in the factories and we had to lined up, which was the\ncommon thing to do. And we had Eichmann and Hess warning us that if we not\nmaking more than our quota, we gonna go to the gas chambers, which were right\nthere. And we were already working more than any human resistance could do,\nbecause of the fume and everything. You see, our eyes have changed already\nbecause of this \u2014 the odor, and the fumes, which was really bad, because we had to\nwash them in some kind of a product.",
        "Q: Fanny, were you given any time to recover, or after you were brought to the\nbarracks \u2014",
        "A: There\u2019s not such thing as recovery.",
        "Q: So you had to go to work after?",
        "A: Mm-hm, like nothing has happened.",
        "Q: God. I usually don\u2019t run out of \u2014 I don\u2019t run out of words, but I\u2019ve run out of\nwords, because it just \u2014 there are no words. There are no words.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t find words, and I want to say a lot more, and I don\u2019t have the words.\nThat\u2019s why I think I told you before I started, I thought I know English, but\napparently I don\u2019t. There\u2019s so many things which are just impossible to find words.\nThere isn\u2019t any words.",
        "Q: No.\n108April 21, 2011",
        "A: There isn\u2019t any words for such a cruelty or unhuman cruelty. There isn\u2019t any\nwords. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t go into the writing class. Because there is no words.",
        "Q: What goes \u2014",
        "A: And anyway, Auschwitz is not describable. There was one famous person that he\ntried to describe Auschwitz, and he said, there\u2019s not enough paper, and not enough\nink in the world. But I don\u2019t know if I told you before, Primo Levi was a scientist.\nAfter the war when he was liberated, he went back to Italy where he was from. He\ngot his position back, which was very high position. He got married, he had a son,\nand he committed suicide, because he could not accept the outside world. According\nto many statistic, there\u2019s about 42 people who have survived Auschwitz and killed\nthemself. I mean prominent people. When I say prominent, is people who got\npositions back after the war. They were recognized as people and they could not\naccept the outside world, after having seen what has been done to people. And I\ndon\u2019t think that any of us, if 1t wouldn\u2019t be for the seminar, happened here in the\nHolocaust museum, I did not know that the Germans did medical experimentation\non babies. But they knew that.",
        "Q: Fanny, did \u2014 did that thought ever cross your mind, tha \u2014",
        "A: Oh, many times, many times.",
        "Q: After the war?\n109April 21, 2011",
        "A: After the war. Because I could not accept cruelty for no reason to ba \u2014 to be done\nto another human being. Not what I have seen in my \u2014 in Auschwitz. Not what my\neyes have seen. I\u2019m even surprised that I\u2019m as normal as I am today.

        "Q: When you were returned to Josy and returned to your husband \u2014\n[break]",
        "Q: \u2014 did you feel alone with them?",
        "A: Yeah, because I \u2014 I\u2014 you could not have the talk, like I have with you today. And\n\u2014and don\u2019t forget, this is many years ago. I could not express what I\u2019m expressing\ntoday. That\u2019s why I said to you, took me 50 years after Auschwitz to be able to \u2014\nand I think I\u2019m very lucky, thanks to Steven, who knew, little by little \u2014 don\u2019t\nforget, has been nine years that we were sitting weekly together.",
        "Q: Did you, at some point, tell Josy?",
        "A: Never. Never. I really wonder today \u2014 my daughter went to the different classes\nin order to be able to give the guided tours. And she shows everything, of emotion.\nAnd I always wonder, does she tell anybody, this is what my mother went through?\nAnd they don\u2019t show you the experimentation, they only show you the beatings and\nthe works, you know, done in Auschwitz.

        "Q: Do \u2014 would you feel that if she did that, she would be in some ways \u2014",
        "A: When she gives the talks, she doesn\u2019t want me to come.",
        "Q: Does she tell you why\u201d?",
        "A: She said she would be crying.",
        "Q: When you \u2014 when you, after the war, had Josy back, did you feel like you were\ndistant from her, or were you \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think I told you when you heard me talking, when I came back,\nI didn\u2019t have a place, and I stayed with my sister because she got her place back.\nAnd we had two beds to sleep, but Josiane very often came to the bed where I slept,\nand she used to tie her nightgown with mine, to make sure I wouldn\u2019t go away.\nDon\u2019t forget, she was only a little over five.",
        "Q: She was a baby still, yeah. That\u2019s not really what I\u2019m \u2014 what I\u2019m asking about is\nnot what \u2014 1s not what she got. Because clearly, if she had not felt secure in you, she\nwould have grown up differently.",
        "A: Oh sure.",
        "Q: Yeah. But I\u2019m asking more of what did you feel? If you\u2019ve gone through such\nexperiences, and you come back and you are \u2014\n111April 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, I wanted to hold her all the time. That\u2019s all I wanted to do, just go to bed\nand hold her all the time, so she wouldn\u2019t go away.",
        "Q: With a double nightgown.",
        "A: She\u2019d do that.",

        "A: From the minute we got there.",
        "Q: I meant aft \u2014 we\u2019re going through the experiments, but at some point the war\ndoes start to turn against the Germans.",
        "A: We have not witnessed that, because we were on the dead march.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about \u2014",
        "A: And the reason being called the dead march, because it was heavy snow and\ndiseases were terrible. Hunger was unbelievable.",
        "Q: Before we get there Josy \u2014 I mean, excuse me, Fanny, what I want to ask about\nis, do you remember if the work in the ammunitions factory ever became less and\nless, and was there a time \u2014 when did you go on the death mar \u2014 what changed\nwithin the camp that all of a sudden \u2014",
        "A: It didn\u2019t change, we all went out. Auschwitz was evacuated the 17\" of January,\nand the 27 of January, the Russians came in. That\u2019s why they evacuated the whole\ncamp.\n112April 21, 2011",
        "Q: My a\u2014 my question is this, if you were evacuated on January 17\", was it on\nJanuary 16\" you were still working in the ammunitions factory \u2014",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 as if it were a normal day\u201d?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Normal day.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you have no idea \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Til we came back from our work.",
        "Q: And then what happened?",
        "A: And then we all had to lined up and march. We \u2014",
        "Q: Out of Auschwitz. And \u2014",
        "A: And we marched \u2014 well, our group, we marched from Auschwitz to\nRavensbrick, and there\u2019s a friend of mine in the museum who made me a map. If I\nsee [indecipherable|",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long way.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long way.\n113April 21, 2011",
        "A: Of course it is. And you can\u2019t imagine that you were able, after Auschwitz to ca\n\u2014Id-\u2014I don\u2019t know what was, and that\u2019s why so \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s called the dead\nmarch, because either people died of disease, people couldn\u2019t walk any more, or\nthey were shot. Because in the snow, as you were walking you saw drops of blood,\npeople who had been shot because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 one was holding up another, til\nthe other couldn\u2019t be held up any more, and dropped. So that\u2019s how you knew how\nmany have died. And many have been liberated way before our group was liberated.\nAnd we were really \u2014 really found out accidentally, because this was already the last\nbattle by the river Elba. And I didn\u2019t know the distance of anything, think I told\nyou, somebody was nice enough who works at the museum, has made me a map. I\nwant to know what happened to me through the different times. And he made me the\nmap, the map \u2014 many people have been liberated by the British, mostly by the\nAmericans. I had the cousin who survived, was liberated by the Americans, and died\ntwo days later, because the food she was given, she couldn\u2019t take it any more. But\nwe were \u2014 we just gave up, the six of us. And you know when you see sometime\nthose black bags where you put garbage in?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s how the \u2014 the six of us looked. You would never even look if somebody is\ndead. The reason we were discovered by the Russians \u2014",
        "Q: In Ravensbruck\u2019\u201d\n114April 21, 2011",
        "A: No, we were already by the Elba, which is in the other end.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: This was two months later. The reason why we were discovered, it was the last\nbattle near the Elba, between the Russians and the Germans. And of course, the\nRussians won at that time. They were looking for Germans or Nazis who were\nhiding, and many did, because we have witnessed the Russians killing them.\nBecause looking for Germans, they found us. And they took us in a makeshift\nhospital and they cleaned us up, because we all had the typhus.",
        "Q: You were six women, or two \u2014 or how many were left?",
        "A: The six of us.",
        "Q: The same six who were in the barracks?",
        "A: Yes. We had frozen toes, we had no fingernails, and you see our eyes, it was only\na li\u2014 a white, because of the fume of the time.",
        "Q: From the \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: And we all had the typhus. Not clean at all, we really were in a very bad shape.\nAnd they were very kind. They gave us \u2014 first they clean us up. They give us what\nthey had, it was only milk. And because they didn\u2019t have food, that saved our lives,\nbecause people who have survived, either with the Americans or the British, got the\nrich, canned food. Like I said, I had the cousin who survived and got those canned\nfoods. And she survived with her brother, and she couldn\u2019t take the food, and she\n115April 21, 2011\njust died. And we were lucky because that\u2019s the only thing they had, they probably\ns-stole some cows and that\u2019s how they have milk to help us. And we stayed there for\nabout 10 days. The Red Cross found us. We got recommendations from the Russian\ndoctor to tell us what we should do when we go back to make sure we go to the\ndoctor, which we did. And on the way back from the people from the Red Cross, I\nwent with a friend of mine from the six who didn\u2019t have anybody to go. The four\nothers had family and friends which they went, but they didn\u2019t \u2014 although they were\nmy age, maybe a couple years older, they didn\u2019t live long.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: So, we don\u2019t know the reactions. And then once I came back to Belgium, I really\nhad a lot of medical problems.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about what they were?",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 don\u2019t forget, we didn\u2019t have our period the day we \u2014 toom \u2014 two months\nafter being in Auschwitz, and I think with experimentation, we don\u2019t know what\nwas put in the body, we don\u2019t know what was taken out from the body. We know\nblood was taken out because that was supposed to be sent to the soldiers in Russia\nwho were on the front. [technical interruption]",
        "Q: Okay. [break]",
        "A: I\u2019m just try \u2014 I\u2019m still trying to save her of many of the pains I went through,\nthat\u2019s why I don\u2019t appreciate for her being when I talk.\n116April 21, 2011",
        "Q: Were we rolling? Okay. Another thing I wanted to go back to, like I had said,\nPrimo Levi found his solution cause he couldn\u2019t connect to that other world.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: He committed \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: He could not accept the other world.",
        "Q: World.",
        "A: He could not \u2014 and he wrote many books \u2014 he could not exp \u2014 tolerate with\nhimself that somebody else is able to do an organizing Auschwitz. He couldn\u2019t\naccept that, that another human being could do that. And that\u2019s why he commit \u2014 he\ncommitted suicide.",
        "Q: And was \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: And not only because he committed suicide, but don\u2019t forget, he was one of the\nvery few who has been accepted in society of \u2014 for what he was before. It\u2019s not like\nall of a sudden he was somebody else.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He was accepted in society, he was accepted in his job. He got married, never\nbeen married before. Got a son. And just could not accept the rest of the world. He\nwas on the step and he like, hanged himself. And there\u2019s 42 other people, with\nnames and everything, they \u2014 they just could not accept the humiliation they lived\nthrough and the effect this had on their lives, and society outside. Look how many\n117April 21, 2011\npeople would not be able to sit down and have a conversation for me to tell their life.\nYou know that.",
        "Q: Of course, of course. It\u2019s very hard, it\u2019s very hard for anybody to talk about a\ntime when they\u2019re humiliated, to talk about what is that humiliation, to describe it to\nanybody, for different reasons. To a stranger because they\u2019re a stranger. To a loved\none because, as you said before, you want to protect them. To yourself. It is very\nhard to do that and it takes \u2014 it takes a great deal of courage.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. And it took me a long time, as\nyou know. And even my daughter told me yesterday, Mother, if you in such agony,\nwhy do you accept doing that? And she knows, or I hope she does, the toll it takes\nfrom me. It\u2019s not like you clean yourself, 1t\u2019s not, you never are clean.",
        "Q: But you never were dirty. You never were. It was not you who was dirty. It was\nthose who did those things.",
        "A: But I have yet to hear anybody saying that they sorry what has happened. My\nson-in-law Freddie, spoke to a group of people here from different countries of\nEurope, who have graduated and they got like a trip from Germany, from France,\nthose were all graduated students who got like a scholarship, and they were already\nin higher studies. A very small group. There was one young woman from Germany,\nthe only one from Germany, came to Freddie and says, I beg you forgiveness, and\ncrying. And I think this is what he needed to hear, because he never found his\nApril 21, 2011\nparents again, and because he works with Steven, he found out how his parents were\nkilled in Austria.",
        "Q: So no one ever said to you, I\u2019m so sorry for what you went through?",
        "A: Not yet. Si\u2014 I\u2019m still waiting. I don\u2019t think \u2014",

        "A: You don\u2019t.",
        "Q: \u2014 without being bitter?",
        "A: It\u2019s not bitter, it\u2019s painful. It\u2019s very painful. I think \u2014 like I have been asked once\nfor students if I hate those people. And the on \u2014 only answer I could give, because if\nI would be a hateful person, I would hurt myself. That\u2019s what I answer the Catholic\nyoungsters.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, it is a religious answer.",
        "A: Because if I would be a hateful person \u2014 the only person who said he would\nnever forgive them and hates them was Wiesenthal when he wrote his book. He\nsaid he would never forgive them. Now, I\u2019m not a hateful person, and like I said to\nthe youngsters, if I would be a hateful person, I would hurt myself, because I could\nnot live with hate.",
        "Q: But it is pain. But you live with pain.\n119April 21, 2011",
        "A: Tremendous, constantly. It\u2019s not like one minute on one person and another\nminute on another person, which I cannot, like, get it out of the system, you say\nsomething.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Well, this \u2014",
        "A: I can\u2019t, I wish I could. I wish I could, because my days wouldn\u2019t be as painful.\nAnd it\u2019s hard to convey that to another person who has not a patient of wanting to\nunderstand a survivor, because I \u2014 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many people who\nunderstand, really, a survivor. I remember quite a number years ago, they had five\npsychiatrists sitting on the stage here in the Rubinstein room, all psychiatrists,\nmedical psychiatrists and of course they were talking, the majority, survivors. They\nknew how we feel. They knew without interviewing anybody like you and I are\ntalking now.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Tha \u2014 they never did that. So how could they know? Nobody has asked me, or\nsomebody else just personally, how you feel about it? What makes you tick today?\nThey have never had that ability. And I think this is a big pain we live with.",
        "Q: That\u2019s very lonely.",

We\u2019ve \u2014 you\nknow, we\u2019re \u2014 you were in \u2014 you were on the death march, you\u2019re liberated, you\u2019re\nbrought back to Belgium. How did you meet Jack again?

Six or seven at least. Both of them died of cancer. My older sister died of\ncancer, my young sister Rose died of cancer. Both of them have never been in a\ncamp. They were sheltered. Both were in that shelter all the time. My younger sister\nwas in that convent with that habit and it \u2014 did what all the good nuns do.",

I have had many proposals, but I guess I wanted something else from\ncompanionship, and probably the other person, like me, wanted me for what I have.\nBut it\u2019s not what I was hoping to get, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 I just wouldn\u2019t settle for second\nbest.

Because you know, when we\u2019re doing that, because some\nof what you say relates to what you were telling me about. And if you want it turned\noff we can do so, because I think we\u2019re over the most \u2014 you know, the formal part of\nour relationship, but we\u2019re also talking about how it comes th \u2014",
        "A: Life.",

This is one of the things you know s \u2014\nI\u2019m happy I\u2019m in my seat rather than in yours, because I don\u2019t know if I could\nanswer the questions. I don\u2019t know if I could articulate. But I think that one of the\nchallenges, if I can even start to imagine myself in having gone through what you\u2019ve\ngone through, in this kind of betrayal of human spirits, the betrayal of human beings\nby other human beings, is how do you learn to trust others again?",
        "A: That\u2019s very difficult, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t trust just everybody.",

        "Q: Yeah, of course, of course. You know, it\u2019s not a distrustful nature, it\u2019s\nexperience, it\u2019s what life showed you. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve gone through.",
        "A: But then again, look how many wonderful, wonderful \u2014 you know, when you just\nthink in your mind \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 complete, complete strangers have nothing to benefit by it, except risking their\nlives. And they were not all religious people. The majority started from churches\nand convents, because we needed that \u2014 I mean, they needed that outlet. But can you\nimagine in society today that people would want to risk their life to save somebody\nelse\u2019s child, at such a high cost?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Not only for themselves, but the whole convent for that matter, which they were\nresponsible. And there\u2019s so many horror books about young people, what they went\nthrough in hiding in convents. But then again you hear wonderful stories. But can\nyou imagine today people taking a child and being responsible for the child, and\nrisking their own life in order to save another human being, for no reason at all? No\nmoney, no glory. You must see that documentary they have here. It just makes you \u2014\nyou know, you read something of the book and then when you finish \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: There\u2019s a wonderful book which 1s called the \u201cDaughters of Absence.\u201d\n128April 21, 2011",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Did you ever hear that book?",
        "Q: No, I haven\u2019t.",
        "A: It\u2019s written by Mandy Mandel(ph). She\u2019s a painter",

        "A: She\u2019s a daughter of survivors. Her father died and he was 1n a concentration\ncamp, and he has a number. She\u2019s quite the famous painter and author. Seven\nwomen got together from different backgrounds, but all the seven have been worn \u2014\nborn after the war, and it\u2019s called the \u201cDaughters of \u2014 of Absence.\u201d",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: Absence, got it.",
        "A: And it\u2019s written by Mindy Mandel(ph), and you feel so good when you finish\nreading that.\n129April 21, 2011",
        "Q: Well \u2014",
        "A: How those seven women live in different countries. I happen to know two, one is\nmy doctor\u2019s wife. Her name \u2014 I forgot her first name, Loeffler? I don\u2019t know if you\never heard that name. But Mindy Mandel(ph) has made quite a reputation for\nherself as a painter, as a speaker.",
        "Q: Well, you know, here\u2019s another thought that comes to my mind as we\u2019ve been\nspeaking. I remember \u2014",

        "Q: I do.",
        "A: Or a clean tissue? [indecipherable] [break]",
        "Q: And so epcet \u2014 exceptional about you. And I will tell it by way of a little story.\nThirty years ago I remember, I was a member of Amnesty International, okay. And\nAmnesty International was having campaigns against torture. And there were some\npeople that came to their attention. And at that time there was the aftermath of the\nCambodian genocide. And there was a young man they featured 1n one of their\nstories, and what he said always struck me, because he was somebody who survived\nthe Cambodian genocide. He saw his parents murdered, he saw his \u2014 his siblings\nmurdered, and he survived. And he said, I survived not only because I ca \u2014 I am\nliving and breathing, I survived because I can love again, after having gone through\nthat. And that 1s an achievement, because so many people couldn\u2019t, after they have\n130\nApril 21, 2011\nbeen exposed to this kind of brutality, this kind of hatred, they couldn\u2019t. And\neverything I hear from you about your children, about Josy, about your\ngrandchildren, about the people that you ever \u2014 it has that spirit of love to it. And\nthat\u2019s why I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine that you would be anything other than more\nthan, rather than what you said earlier about feeling inferior. If you can love again,\nthat\u2019s a lesson for all of us, you know, because whatever challenges you go throu \u2014\nand everybody has challenges, just some of us are not in those kinds of challenges.",
        "A: Of course. The daily life you have challenges, sure.",
        "Q: We are always challenged on do I trust again \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 do I love again? Do I put myself out there again?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do I make myself vulnerable to other people again? And it takes extraordinary\ncourage to do it in the face of past experiences.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t have any other words, those are just \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 what goes through my mind as we\u2019re talking. And I am glad that you\u2019re here.",

And Fanny, first of all, I \u2014 like I do on every\ninterview, I would like to thank you for giving our \u2014 your time today to speak with\nus. But unlike every interview that we do, where normally I ask \u2014 and I will be\nasking this later, I usually ask someone to start at the beginning, where were they\nborn, what was their family like, who were their mother and father and so on. All of\nthese things are very important. But Id like to start ours in a little different way,\nbecause before we started the \u2014 the interview itself, we were talking about the\nprocess of it, and you were ac \u2014 you were telling me about some of the reservations\nthat you had. So I\u2019d like to talk about that a little bit, about what 1s it like to speak\nwith someone about these experiences that we are going to be talking about today. If\nyou could share some of those thoughts with me.",
        "Q: So, in other words, every time you talk, there\u2019s a cost, there\u2019s a cost.",

        "Q: Were there \u2014 were there many years when you didn\u2019t speak about your life at all\nin \u2014 about this \u2014 these aspects of your life?",
        "Q: Fanny is talking to Steven Vitto who is [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Tell me of \u2014 tell me a little bit about this, this 1s \u2014 you started as a volunteer here\nat the museum, 1s this what you\u2019re talking about?",
        "Q: And how is it \u2014 and what was Steve\u2019s job? What was his way of meeting you?\nWhat was \u2014 how did your interactions start?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You knew yourself well then \u2014",
        "Q: What were some of the reasons for not wanting to come?",
        "Q: So as you were coming to \u2014 to work at the museum as a volunteer, you were also\ntranslating this book at the same time?",
        "Q: I'd like to stop \u2014 excuse me inter \u2014 for interrupting you Fanny, I'd like to bring\nSteve into this shot a little bit. Can we do that? Is there a way for Steve to stand\nright here?\nQ2: Now, you want a two shot, I take it?",

        "Q: Yeah, keep it on the two shot, okay.\nQ2: Okay, that sounds good. All-righty-roo.",
        "Q: We\u2019re ready?\nQ2: We\u2019re all set now, uh-huh.",
        "Q: Okay. Id like to introduce Steve Vitto to our conversation, Fanny, and I\u2019d like\nSteve to explain a little bit about what his job was here, and how it is that the two of\nyou met and interacted. So Steve, tell me a little bit about what you do, and how it is\nthat your \u2014 your path with Fanny\u2019s crossed.\nS: I work in a department that was then called the Holocaust S-Survivors Registry.\nWe\u2019 ve since expanded, now we\u2019re called the Holocaust Survivors and Victims\nResource Center. And my job then and my job now 1s to ensure that the individual\nexperiences of Holocaust survivors are first recorded in our survivors registry and\nthen made available to people who are asking about them. So I bridge the gap\nbetween researching archives, but always interacting with the public in s \u2014 to find",
        "Q: By recorded, do you mean put in a database, or do you mean that like we\u2019re\ndoing an interview with Fanny right now?\nS: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which 1s\nsurvivors or their families providing that information to us, since most people who\nwent through the Holocaust did not have documentation of that experience. So, to\nfill in that gap, we want people to come to us and provide that information that\u2019s\notherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can\nthen be accessed by people coming through the museum, or calling us or writing me\nfor that information. That\u2019s one particular database and since then we also work with\nmany other databases, including oral history collections, more online databases,\ndigitized and also scanned image databases.",
        "Q: So tell me about how it is that Fanny and you first met.\nS: Well, we work in a registry, we work with su-survivor volunteers who come to us\nand they\u2019re very important, not only in giving us their testimony, but in helping us to\narrange, put in data, to scan images and to help us 1n a variety of ways. And so\nFanny came to me as a volunteer from \u2014 she had mentioned our volunteer\ncoordinator, Jill Weinberg, and Fanny was able to do several \u2014 working with\ncomputers, she was able to pick up using our survivors registry. And we often get",
        "Q: Excuse me. I think in Belgium we have French and Flemish, as \u2014 as languages,\nSO \u2014\nS: Right.",
        "Q: So which language was it, of those two?\nS: This is in French, okay, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.",
        "Q: It was in French, okay, sorry.",
        "Q: But cle \u2014 thank you, Steve, because I \u2014 I \u2014 I think we needed to get a sense of\nwhat was the structure of the volunteer program, but clearly something much more\nhappened. This was the specific job, the specific task, but when you met, something\nmuch more happened between you. And Fanny, can you tell me what it is that you f\n\u2014 that you felt and that was an ongoing thing over the past several years?",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "Q: So wou \u2014",
        "Q: Well, 1t \u2014 to me it sounds that here when you started volunteering \u2014 I don\u2019t want\nto put words in your mouth, but this is the sort of thoughts that are coming into my\nmind, is that there were aspects of the larger story that was relevant to you because it\nhad to do with the Belgian underground.",
        "Q: That you were finding out through this work, and that through the work and\nthrough your interaction, little bit your own story was coming up.",
        "Q: And 1s \u2014 and 1s that what made it more comfortable for you to now speak?",
        "Q: That must have been \u2014",
        "Q: Steve?",
        "Q: Steve, we\u2019re putting you on the spot all right.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Steve, is there something you want to add to this, of your thoughts in the years as\nthey\u2019ve gone by, what you\u2019ve learned from Fanny and through the relationship that\ndeveloped between you about her story?\nS: Oh my God. Well, the first thing I wanted to say 1s I br \u2014 I wanted to push Fanny,\nbecause we did develop this personal relationship and I\u2019m very fortunate in my job\nthat I\u2019m able to interact with the survivors and their families individually, and I meet\nhundreds of them, thousands of them for 20 years now, but Fanny is os \u2014 really\nspecial. And again, one of my profe \u2014 jobs is to ensure that the stories of individuals\nare remembered. And so, while we had great conversations, I didn\u2019t want it to end\nthere. I wanted to make sure that other people were able to hear her story through\noral histories, read her story. I always get her \u2014 want her to write out her stories, do\npresentations as much as possible. And so in this way, it\u2019s sort of my job, but to\nmake sure that her story is heard by as many people as possible. She has so many\nthings to teach about \u2014 I guess mainly for me 1s overcoming. Someone who\u2019s been\nthrough so much, and by listening to her I understand as much as anybody can, what\nshe went through. And knowing her family, the main thing is about overcoming that.\nYou go through so many things and sometimes there\u2019s no answer to them, you just\nhave to wait things out until they pass. And you\u2019re affected for life, but that horrible\nmoment does pass and you have to rebuild your life afterwards. And Fanny was\nApril 21, 2011\nable to do that. So I knew her story, but I also met her daughter and I got to know\nher granddaughter and her great-granddaughter. And so I see that for the horrible\nthings that Fanny went through, four generations later, there\u2019s a beautiful 12 year\nold girl that\u2019s a friend of my son\u2019s actually. And I see that if it wasn\u2019t for Fanny just\npersevering and going on, that\u2019s \u2014 if it wasn\u2019t for that, this beautiful 12 year old girl\nwould not be there, would not be friends with my sons, and would not have the\nfreedom to go to school and enjoy life in a way that Fanny wasn\u2019t able to later on in\nher life.",

        "Q: Well, it\u2019s very hard for a person to imagine to be completely cut off, to have no\nmeans of communication, not know what the outside world is. That\u2019s so not the\ncurrent kind of experience that most modern people ex \u2014 have, you know? It\u2019s \u2014 you\nhave to make an effort to be cut off, to go away and turn off your computer and turn\noff your mobile phone, but it\u2019s your choice. It\u2019s not taken from you. And 1n this\ncase, your means of knowing of what was going on in the outside world was taken.\nSo \u2014 so you didn\u2019t know if your husband survived or didn\u2019t survive?",
        "Q: So you were \u2014 and that unknowing, that adds stress too, that adds fear, too.",
        "Q: Did your daughter notice this? I mean, she\u2019s a toddler, she\u2019s a baby. And\ndaughters \u2014 children notice how parents \u2014",
        "Q: So she was oblivious, thankfully oblivious.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: We can look at those \u2014",
        "Q: Let me take a look at that. I\u2014",
        "Q: Yeah? She would \u2014 I see that picture. So, remind me again, right in 1940, your\nparent \u2014 I\u2014 I know you talked about your father being arrested in 1942, but did their\nlives change much in 1940?",
        "Q: Star. Okay. Could he still earn a living through working with the community, or\nnot?",
        "Q: When did the arrests start?",
        "Q: When did the arrests start?",
        "Q: So fast?",
        "Q: And were Jews arrested en masse, or were simply certain people picked out?",
        "Q: Did you get an order at one point that \u2014",
        "Q: They were brou \u2014 what \u2014 what was the purpose of these items that they had to\nbring to work? They had to give them up to the \u2014 to the \u2014",
        "Q: So that means when they reported to work \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 it wasn\u2019t really work.",
        "Q: So they just disappeared from your life?",
        "Q: They were betrayed, in other words.",
        "Q: Fanny, describe for me the \u2014 I\u2019m finding it hard to un \u2014 understand the overall\ndanger. I know that it\u2019s existed and so on, but I\u2019m trying to get a sense of, when you\nwent out in the morning to go buy milk for Josy, yeah, did you fee \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, so you would find out what place was guarded, and what \u2014 so does this\nmean that every time you stepped out of your apartment, you were in danger that\nyou could be arrested and not come back\u2019?",
        "Q: From day one?",
        "Q: Did you ever get such a working sheet for you?",
        "Q: Why do you think that didn\u2019t happen? You don\u2019t know. You may not have been\non a register.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: And in 1942, when your father was arrested, what made that particularly \u2014 beca \u2014\nhe was arrested simply for being Jewish in that place, you know, in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in\nthe circle of people. Had he not gone that day to that meeting, would have he been\nsafe for one more day? Is that \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "Q: And remind me again, it was to discuss the funeral of somebody in the\ncommunity, and there were a group of people who gathered together, and all of them\nwere arrested?",

        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: In torture.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So I want to go back to your father\u2019s fate. You heard about what happened to him\nthrough your mother, or through somebody else?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay, I think we\u2019re gonna take a break.",
        "Q: Okay, so Fanny, I wanted to ask a few questions for clarification. I wanted to get\na sense of what was it like personally \u2014 as a person who is Jewish when the invasion\nhappened. How did you go from feeling fear to actually experiencing the danger?\nHow did things become more and more dangerous? Can you take us through some\nof those steps?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So \u2014 what were the f \u2014 [technical adjustments] Sorry Fanny, the \u2014 you were\npetrified, and wa \u2014",

        "Q: Terror, it sounds like.",
        "Q: It sounds like terror.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Fanny, as this \u2014 as th \u2014 as \u2014 [technical interruption] Okay. As the months went\nby, how did it come \u2014 occur to you, how did it come into your mind that maybe you\nhad to give Josy away\u201d",
        "Q: I see, so \u2014",
        "Q: Did you talk about this with your mother?",
        "Q: With your sisters?",
        "Q: So \u2014 what did your sisters do, sh \u2014 her \u2014 she had two boys, yes?",

        "Q: Do you have any idea of how long this went on?",

And there was a young man they featured 1n one of their\nstories, and what he said always struck me, because he was somebody who survived\nthe Cambodian genocide. He saw his parents murdered, he saw his \u2014 his siblings\nmurdered, and he survived. And he said, I survived not only because I ca \u2014 I am\nliving and breathing, I survived because I can love again, after having gone through\nthat.

    "answers": [
        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "A: For me it\u2019s very difficult to talk publicly, because of many reasons. I have heard\nmany wonderful speakers here at the museum, but all those people have been single\npeople when the war started. I already had a child, and I already had responsibilities.\nApril 21, 2011\nAnd we \u2014 it started out scary enough, and my biggest problem also is, after so many\nyears, I\u2019m still living with the horrors I lived through in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Absu-absolutely right. Of course it is. Even today, which is so many years later,\nwhen I\u2019m in a car, and I pass where there\u2019s a railroad, I still break out in a sweat,\nwhich 1s not the polit \u2014 polite way of saying. Because we had been for so long in the\ncattle train and I don\u2019t think anybody has ever been able to find words what it was\nfor three days and three nights, for 110 people, including babies, in a cattle train.\nThe prayers, the screams, especially from babies, is just indescribable, at least I\ncannot find the words fer \u2014 to describe such unhuman things.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t know what was waiting for us at that time.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve only start \u2014 what is it, Steven, 10 years?\nS: Ten years ago.",
        "A: Yes, when he was always \u2014 and I was very lucky that my job was to sit with\nSteven, because of his kindness, of his generosity and caring. Don\u2019t forget, Steven,\nnot because he\u2019s a young person, we are from such a different background and we\nApril 21, 2011\nused to have conversations, like one human being should be fortunate to have with\nanother one.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, it really started that I saw in \u201cThe Jewish Week,\u201d which is a small\nmagazine \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 advertised that the Holocaust Museum needs volunteers. And one way or\nanother, I was debating for a long, long time, and there\u2019s a lot of things which I\ndidn\u2019t care for to come here. And I have decided I want to come and see what it 1s.\nAnd I am \u2014 was interview by somebody, which we connected very nicely. Her name\nis Jill and I don\u2019t -- Coynburg(ph) or Cohenberg(ph), I don\u2019t remember her name.\nAnd somehow, we had a conversation that we understand each other. She said, look\nFanny, you could start here right now, or you could wait for about two months\nwhen we have a orientation. And I knew that if I would wait for an orientation, I\nwould never come back.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: So she say you could do \u2014 yes, I could change my mind. I had many reasons for\nnot wanting to come, like I had many reasons to do come.",
        "A: There\u2019s a lot of things I didn\u2019t agree the way the things were working here. So I\nhad the choice and I did not wait to be oriented. I felt I had been oriented a lot,\nthrough the time I was \u2014 the Germans occupied Belgium and being in Auschwitz,\nthat was enough orientation. Anyway, I was very, very fortunate, I met Steven, and\nimmediately we connected very nicely. At the same time, I was translating a book\nfrom Belgium, who just came out. This was a no \u2014 official book, how many\ntransports they had from [indecipherable] how many people in each transport, how\nmany people made into camp. What many people didn\u2019t know, that many trains had\ngas and people were gassed in that train before they even got to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes, bes \u2014\nApril 21, 2011\nQ2: This is a two shot.\nApril 21, 2011\nout what happened to an individual and to help ensure that an individual\u2019s\nexperience in the Holocaust is recorded in some way.\nApril 21, 2011\nrequests not only for individual information, but information based on place. So for\ninstance, all the people who were from \u2014 in Theresienstadt for instance,\nconcentration camp, or from a particular town, or share a ca \u2014 particular experience,\nand with our database, we\u2019re able to push a few buttons and so we can get not only a\nlist of individuals, but individuals from a particular place. And I had a particular\nrequest for people who were \u2014 somebody wanted information from those who were\nin Theresienstadt, who were registered with us. And Fanny was able to help me to\n\u2014I could set her up and so she could look through this list and produce it so that I\ncould filter it a little bit and provide that information to another individual. That was\none database. The other infor \u2014 information \u2014 the other job she had was, since\nFanny speaks Belgian, we have a book that\u2019s a list of the deportations that took\nplace in Belgium. And this particular collection is based on date, date of convoy\nonly. And also, it was producing. It was Belgian, so it was in Belgian.\nApril 21, 2011\nS: But because of Fanny\u2019s background in Belgium, I thought it would be a good fit,\nand this \u2014 this information was in French, and Fanny looked through that. And\nbefore each \u2014 it\u2019s divided by convoys, before each name list of those on the convoys\nis a description of that convoy, and \u2014 in French. And Fanny was able to translate\nthose introductions, so that now people could not only look up the names of those\nwho were on those transports, but they could also read, in English now, that general\ndescription of that transport.",
        "A: Because mainly, little by little, I was telling Steven my background and my\nstory. And he was kind, very tolerant, and listening. Also, when we got the book\nfrom Belgium, further descriptions, the number of trains, the number of people in\nthe trains and how many transport, at the same time the museum got a book called\n\u201cThe Hidden Heroes.\u201d That book was written by a German reporter. She is from\nGermany. She tried to interview peop \u2014 Jewish people in Germany and nobody\nwanted to give her any information. Somehow, she was so determined, she came to\nBelgium and she got the real information, with the names of the people from the\nApril 21, 2011\nunderground. The underground, the resistance, they were also called the solidarity,\nand they have pictures right here from that. So that book, and the one I was\ntranslating made more sense because you could put the two and two together. And\nthat book wasn\u2019t selling too well, and they had \u2014 she had to change the title, to \u201cThe\n20 Transport.\u201d And what makes it so interesting, that in the book, in that what\nmade in Belgium more people survive, because the underground, Jewish people,\nnon-Jewish people, any kind of people were just one group. Where in France they\nhad a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the\nsame thing has happened in Holland. And this is why in Belgium only, because of\nsuch a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can\u2019t even\nfind the names, who organized in convents, in churches and regular people, because\nof their caring and their dedication, 40,000 Jewish people have survived in Belgium,\nincluding my own child.",
        "A: So you see that combination, it was so wonderful that Steven was there for me to\nhelp [indecipherable].",
        "A: And many of the words from the documents from Belgium, I did not know\nbecause I didn\u2019t learn English of those documents. So Steven would \u2014 made sure I\nhave a special dictionary, to have those [indecipherable] what anybody who wanted\nApril 21, 2011\nto know. Another thing what we did is anybody passing by on the second floor, you\njust seen people running back and forth, specially young students. So we really \u2014 my\njob really was, can we help you? And we did, because once we had a French person\nwho was sent from a newspaper in France, with the picture from the room where\nyou have all the pictures there, and whoever he asked, they didn't know what he\nwanted. And he passed a few times, til I had enough guts and I asked if I help you?\nThen he said in French, nobody knows the answer. And he had a copy of the picture\nand the name of the newspaper he was representing. So immediately if not sooner,\nSteven was able, through the computer, to get the \u2014 all the information, which he\ntyped for him to take. So he didn\u2019t have to go to so many places, because he was\noriginally in the right place. So you see, you never know the contact you have with\nSteven in that particular place, because he knows the answers to everything.",
        "A: You\u2019re right.",
        "A: Exactly, you\u2019re right.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Oh, more than just comfortable, because I had the hard time when we came to\nAmerica and I was still young, nobody from the family wanted to hear any of our\nstories, because they were afraid they gonna have a headache.",
        "A: So this was somebody I just got to know, and I felt comfortable \u2014 there\u2019s another\nword which is just more than comfortable, at ease, and we could talk, which is so\nunbelievable, which I haven\u2019t done to such extent. Because this was always bottle\nup and still is, to many extent. [indecipherable] was very, very fortunate, and the\nsame thing, thanks to Steven. He made sure that I would be speaking up. He said, if\nyou don\u2019t do it now, when you gonna do it? And I know I\u2019m old, so I had to do it.\nBut it just amazing how two people from such different backgrounds, different lives,\nhave been able to have such a wonderful relationship.",
        "A: Which is gonna be for me forever, because we could talk about so many things\nand I\u2019m very fortunate to have a young person who could understand our situations.\nSo that\u2019s why I say \u2014",
        "A: No, \u2019'm not. He knows I\u2019m not.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: So ever \u2014 so I\u20141f I ever get a gold star, it belongs to Steven.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: Because \u2014 [Il you why I feel it\u2019s so important. It\u2019s very difficult in this time and\nage, with technology that\u2019s so advanced, to such extent you have little ones with the\n\u2014 the computers, the cell phone, just name it and it\u2019s growing bigger and bigger, that\npeople still could have a personal relationship, and feel good about themself, that\nthey have somebody else who could understand their feelings or what they\u2019re\nsaying. Another problem I had is because of the things I went through, I always felt\n\u2014and this is still with me today, because it took me 50 years to be able to talk about\nApril 21, 2011\nit, and I still have a feeling of inferiority, that I\u2019m not like other people, which I\u2019m\nnot.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Uh-huh. This is because what has been done to me. You see, at the museum here,\nI am the only person who went through medical experimentation. I\u2019m the only\nvolunteer survivor who was already married and had a child at the time. So I had the\nresponsibility, which is so difficult to make other people understand. This is why\nwhen I speak to an audience here, and when you feel the reaction of the people, like\nyou did when you heard me talk \u2014 you know somehow it\u2019s like a soothing medicine,\nor like somebody pats you on the shoulder and said you okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm, he\u2019s right, absolutely. It\u2019s true.\nApril 21, 2011\nS: It\u2019s all yours now.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m glad you have added to, because this is why it made it important for me\nto come to you.",
        "A: To come \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m glad you have added that, because very few people are lucky in their life to\nhave a relationship \u2014",

        "A: Not at all.",

        "A: Thank you. And also, the same organi \u2014 they had an organization, which is called\nHaza(ph) Chalamis(ph). That means if somebody becomes a member and pays\nmonthly dues, once they pass away, everything is taken care. And I don\u2019t know if\nyou know, you\u2019re aware, it\u2019s quite a preparation the way Jewish people allowed to\nbe buried.",

We were the\nApril 21, 2011\nfirst house that we had a record player. Can you believe that today that the record\nplayer was so important? We were the first one. So, of course all my friends were\nalways in our house. But this was a big deal. How do you explain that when you\nspeak to young people today, to explain them the meaning of things which today\ntechnology is so above what I have seen through the years.",

In order for\nher to do a good deed, which was very important to Jewish people [indecipherable]\nand we didn\u2019t have money, so what she did, and this is the biggest deed you could\ndo in your life, is helping people when they dead, to clean their body to be buried.\nBecause, if you do something nice to somebody, or you help somebody, that person\ncould always do something else for you. But this, nobody could pay you for, and\nthis, of course, was not a paying job. This is what \u2014 just to do a very special deed,\nand she did that very often. And nobody knew about that, you know, it\u2019s not \u2014 this 1s\nwhat she did.",

        "A: Because of the financial situation.",
        "A: And also, anti-Semitism started to grow to a big extent.",
        "A: It has always been, but apparen \u2014 which I didn\u2019t know, we didn't know. But\napparently this has always been. And it seem Poland has always have a problem,\nbecause in 1946 \u2014 I\u2019m just jumping from one \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to the other, but you\u2019re talking about Poland. In 1946, many people who have\nsurvive camps, and the forest or in hiding, went back to Poland where they came\nApril 21, 2011\nfrom to find out if there\u2019s some relatives, somebody\u2019s still alive. And at that time, in\n1946, there was a pogrom and 200 people were killed, who survived and came to\nlook after [indecipherable]. Just to give you an idea. And even today, Poland has\nnot given any restitution. Not only not giving restitution, they don\u2019t \u2014 not even\nwilling to give back the houses of somebody who has survived, of today it\u2019s still the\nsame thing.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: You\u2019re right.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, th \u2014 a big memory was the record player.",
        "A: Because we had all our friends gathering 1n our place, and after one record we\ngot another one. And then I went to high school, and then I went to college.",
        "A: When I graduated from college in art and design.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Regular public schools, because my parents felt we should have a regular\neducation. No matter what\u2019s going to happen, they felt \u2014 so when I graduated from\ncollege in art and design with a degree, AP, a few of us were taken to work for the\nroyal house.",
        "A: Yes, ma\u2019am, we work for the royal hou \u2014 and this was a great honor and a big\ndeal.",
        "A: And for me, coming from an Orthodox house, it was so revealing, because there\nwere so many departments. Everybody, like groups, we did different thing. Patterns,\ncolors. What kind of a fair it\u2019s gonna be and how many people are gonna be involve\nin the fair and what kind of clothes they would have to wear. It was really very\nexciting for me.",
        "A: Well, because I have never lived that kind of world. Don\u2019t forget in Belgium,\nspecially girls coming from religious houses, it\u2019s very difficult. And at that time\nwomen were either secretaries, seamstresses, which I was not, and that\u2019s what my\nparents made sure we wa \u2014 wouldn\u2019t. So, it was different.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: We were part of assorting colors. Let\u2019s say 10 people would go to an affair. We\nwere known \u2014 we were told what kind of affair is it, evening, afternoon or tea,\nbecause the royal house, those people were having different people, and different\naffairs.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s wild, just what you just \u2014 to \u2014 t-today \u2014 it was very exciting.",
        "A: Well, because it was not just one design.",
        "A: It was at least 50 people part of the designing. And about 50 at least designing\nwhat kind of color for tea, over kind of color to receive people, other dignitaries\nfrom other countries.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was. Somebody else mentioned that, it was like a show.",

        "A: About three years.",
        "A: Other people working?",
        "A: The \u2014 they were a few \u2014 yes, but we always lived very well with Jewish people.\nYou see, another thing which we had in Belgium, at that time the Belgium Congo\nbelonged to Belgium. The nuns and religious people went to teach religion. They\nbuilt churches, schools, to [indecipherable] the people and teaching the people.\nBecause of that, many people from Africa came to Belgium for their jobs, because\nthey had a complete department, the Belgium Congo, that started way, way,\ngenerations before. So we have gone to school with black people, we lived in the\nsame neighborhood with black people, and we never knew that there was a\ndifference.",
        "A: Not at all, til we came to America that I have learn about racism. Don\u2019t forget,\nall this started when Hitler came to power. But before that, we went to school to\nApril 21, 2011\nblack and white and yellow, any kind of persons. And also because Belgium had the\nBelgium Congo.",
        "A: No, not from \u2014 we start \u2014 that particular information we start to get in 1938, we\nwere just married. And because from Austria and Germany, many young people\nescape and came to Belgium with an open door.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, we had no problem, because in 19 \u2014 in 1938, before Kristallnacht, the\nBelgium people were assured that we would not be invaded. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re\nfamiliar with the map, Holland and Belgium \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we have the canal. They have install like the Maginot \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 line. This was a canal which would have, just touching it, 1t would be flooded\nand the tanks would not be able to come in.",
        "A: But of course this was sabotage and the German tanks were in, before even the\nwater. And you see, when I talk about that, nobody has ever heard about it.",
        "A: Well, the strange thing is, I went through the museum to speak to one of the\nuniversities. And we stayed two nights there with somebody from the museum who\ntook me. And one lady we ca \u2014 became friendly with, that was a group of teachers\nwho gonna teach students. So I was chosen at that particular time, to speak to the\nteachers who gonna teach th-the youngsters about the Holocaust. So when we went\nto dinner, the teacher came with us and she ask if she could take her husband. And\nof course, why not? There were the two of us, it was wonderful. In between our\nconversation, which we had a lot to talk, he apparently, he was from Holland. And\nhe is young, and he had parents in Holland and family, where he goes to visit. That\nwas between dinner an-and conversation, he told me even today the parents talk\nabout the canals. And for me it was like, you know, soothing, somebody else has\never heard about that, too. He say even today they still talk that we would not be\noccupied, because Holland had a tough time too, with the Germans.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Correct, but that was the border of Germany.",
        "A: You know, from Germany \u2014",
        "A: \u2014to come in. Look, the la \u2014 Maginot line didn\u2019t work.",
        "A: We were not affected by it.",
        "A: Well, not that much.",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget, my husband and I, we got married in \u00b038.",
        "A: Well, my husband was a trained violinist. And he and many other musicians were\nplaying in music houses, because there were silent movies, and that was a wonderful\nApril 21, 2011\nway of making a living. Except, in \u201938, the talkies came in and they all lost their\njobs. So he went to school and he became a tailor.",
        "A: Through other friends, we went to a dance. In Belgium we went very often to\ndances.",
        "A: Because we were modern enough to let us go to dance.",
        "A: He \u2014 it just was the end of it.",
        "A: Well, because number one, he played and it was very sophisticated, and I was\nmuch younger than he was. That was very appealing.",
        "A: I was 21 when we got married, and he was already 32.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: One year.",
        "A: We met in 1937.",
        "A: In 1938.",
        "A: And we started out like many happy couples, with many dreams and many hopes\nfor future. And of course never knew what the future is for us.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "A: Well, first of all I became pregnant and then I stopped working. Pregnant women\ndidn\u2019t work. And then my husband started to work, also for a different place in\nBelgium. In Belgium the senators or ambassadors or any people, they wear striped\npants and those jackets like the music conductors.",
        "A: Those special \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Yes. So he got the job doing that.",
        "A: Completely.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, he really felt very bad that he could not continue his life with music.",
        "A: But that \u2014 again, it\u2019s like you have a depression here today.",
        "A: There was a tremendous depression, because of that\u2019s how many people were all\nof a sudden, you know, out of \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 out of work.",
        "A: Not as much as music, I think.",
        "A: Well, don\u2019t forget, 1t was also a matter of making a living.",
        "A: Because he was the only one making a living.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Not yet.",
        "A: Not yet. And of course, the future has changed.",
        "A: Jacques. Jacques Aizenberg.",
        "A: No, he was from Poland too, and he came to Belgium I think in 1920, he and his\nbrother came to Belgium.",
        "A: Radom.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But we were different.",
        "A: In every way.",
        "A: Well, he was much more mature than I was.",
        "A: He thought. But that was okay, it was nice and like I say, we were really having\nbig dreams and big hopes at that particular time. That was1938, not knowing what\u2019s\nwaiting for us. And also, in November of 1938, there was Kristallnacht, killing the\nJews.",
        "A: In Germany and in Austria. Breaking windows. What they also did, and there\u2019s\na book about that, the Germans were surprised that in different cities, the population\nwould not be against arresting the Jews. What they did, and I think there\u2019s a\ndocumentary here on the fifth floor \u2014 they have treasures right here on the fifth floor\nfor anybody \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s correct \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes, and they have many recordings or documentaries. And they have like a\njudge, or a surgeon dressed in women\u2019s clothes and parading in the streets. They had\nofficial rabbis cleaning the streets with toothbrushes. And when I spoke to that\nparticular teacher\u2019s group, which made it easier for me to speak, they had slides of\nwhat I\u2019m telling you now. They had slides of those people going the street, and the\nApril 21, 2011\nGermans never thought that their neighbors would let their friends, who were in\nGermany for generations, let them do that.",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget, we still ha \u2014 we had our radios at that time, and we knew. And also,\nright after Kristallnacht, 2,000 Jewish [indecipherable] came to Belgium, and they\nformed a Jewish organization, J \u2014 AJB, association of Jews in Belgium. And they\nhave arranged of Jewish families to take in child. And my mother and father also\nhad sheltered a little girl until 1940.",
        "A: Because the same organization picked up the children and put them in other \u2014 the\nreason we got \u2014 why \u2014 how come from Germany, we would have to take her off the\ntrain \u2014 not that we mind taking them in, because in \u201938 we were still innocent,\nbecause the parents would have to work in different states, so those children needed\na home.",
        "A: But we don\u2019t know if those parents have not been arrested.",
        "A: We didn't know that til after.",
        "A: Yes, a girl.",
        "A: Sophie.",
        "A: She was from Berlin.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "A: She was younger. I think they would \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes \u2014",
        "A: I think she was between 12 and 14.",
        "A: Right. Very hurt, not quiet. Very hurt, very hurt.",
        "A: Yes, because she was an only child, and probably extremely spoiled.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Because we learned it from other families who had children who were more\noutspoken.",
        "A: Right. And of course, many traumas happen in our lives \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 affect people in different ways.",
        "A: Which we never know.",
        "A: Including myself. You never know the \u2014 the reaction.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Then the discu \u2014 everybody was a politician. You know, coming back Friday\nfrom shul, or in the morning after shul, this 1s the only topic. And also, another thing\nwhat has been happening, many people from Austria and Germany, young, single\nmen came to Belgium and that\u2019s how we connect and we got to know many of those\npeople. But they didn\u2019t know, they only knew Kristallnacht. And they felt it\u2019s gonna\nApril 21, 2011\ngo away shortly, and it\u2019s not gonna continue to the way. And of course, then the\nGermans started to arrest the Jewish people, beating them, putting them into jails\nand never knowing what has happened to them. And that\u2019s what I feel, it was the\nend of the civilization of Germany. And I tell you why I say that, because in\nBelgium, if a family had a lot of money, and especially having boys, they would\nsend them to Germany to study, because this was the ultimate of an education. But\nof course, afterwards we have learned what those educated people were able to do.\nAnd we became very friendly with those people and that\u2019s how we got involved, and\nwe got to know those people who have joined the underground of the solidarity or\nthe resistance, whatever you called it.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, she was born in March \u00b039.",
        "A: Any trauma?\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: No, because on the radios, on the ne \u2014 in the newspapers, Belgium is gonna be\nfree, you don\u2019t have to worry, we gonna be free. We not going to be occupied, that\u2019s\nwhat was used. And of course then we were almost reassured, because of the\nMaginot line. And like I say, then everybody became a politician, and we believed\nthe papers. And we did believe, because we felt reassured with friends, having the\nMaginot line, til it became, you know, a sad story, cause they went all around.\nImagine such a big army, only 18 days they lasted. And France was occupied.",
        "A: A year after?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Well, this 1s what started us really being scared.",
        "A: Because, since we were told that Belgium and Holland are gonna remain free,\nthe Belgium government asked people to si\u2014 young men to sign up. They didn\u2019t\nknow for what and for where, and many, many have signed up, including my\nApril 21, 2011\nhusband. Also many people who have come from Germany and Austria have also\nsigned up. And they, in 1940, when the Germans invaded, they all got the call where\nto meet, in Dunkirk.",
        "A: Well, we didn't know what they\u2019re gonna do.",
        "A: Many for military \u2014 don\u2019t forget that afterwards we have learned that in England\nthey had divisions of people from different countries in Europe. Some have mixed\nwith the British and many have remain independent.",
        "A: Wa- we didn\u2019t know it\u2019s gonna be a mobilization.",
        "A: We only thought in case of need. Those were the words, in case of need.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: In case they would meet and we felt well, maybe, you know, to be at the borders.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: And of course, none of them have ever been in the army, so we never thought\nthat that would be the reason.",
        "A: It did, because the fear grew so bad.",
        "A: Because here we were living peacefully, and really innocent, completely.\nInnocent is really the word you could use, because we couldn\u2019t believe anything\ncould happen, because even when the young people who came from Germany and\nAustria, didn\u2019t know that Jews were killed, they only knew Kristallnacht, they only\nknew the damage they were doing. But they didn\u2019t know what was happening to the\nJews at that particular time already.",
        "A: Tremendously.",
        "A: Because we didn\u2019t know what to expect. How do you put that in words?",
        "A: It\u2019s really being scared for your own shadow.",
        "A: My oldest sister was married and she had already two sons at that time.\nApril 21, 2011",

        "A: Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Everybody was guessing.",
        "A: And everybody was a politician, everybody knew what\u2019s gonna happen.",
        "A: You're right. Not only that, we couldn\u2019t believe in the wildest imagination that\nanything was happening the way it was happening.",
        "A: And that it could happen.",
        "A: In 1940.\nQ2: Maybe we should change tape here.",

Whenever he\nApril 21, 2011\ncalls, I\u2019m not home. So I said once to Freddie, you have two choices. Would you\nlike to have a mother-in-law who\u2019s drunk and always home? Or a mother-in-law\nwho\u2019s never home. Didn\u2019t get an answer. No, I have to be involved.",
        "A: I ha\u2014 do many things, except I\u2019m slowing down very fast because of different\nhealth problems and I\u2019m having many. I even may need eye surgery, which scares\nme to death. I had two cataracts remove and now I have glaucoma on one eye, and\nbecause of the clo \u2014 glaucoma they have like a film over.",
        "A: In order to remove that and not to lose the eyesight, they need surgery. And I\u2019m\nscared to death at my age to have eye surgery.

        "A: They bombed those bridges, and left. And then the Germans had a hard time\ncoming in, but apparently they had enough forces to close those things. And that\u2019s\nwhen our pain started.",
        "A: Very difficult. Very difficult. He didn't know what to do and he wanted to stay\nand I didn't think it would be right, if we \u2014 number one, we never thought of the\nmassacre waiting for us. We never knew of deportation, we never knew of \u2014 we\nknew of working with the children who have been collected the same day. Not\ncollected, they\u2019ve been taken care of by the same organization who have put them\nthere.",
        "A: Who came to us \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 from Germany, or from Austria. It was frightening, it was scary, it was\nunbelievably scary, and I don\u2019t have another word of scared.",
        "A: Of such a uncertainty of what\u2019s going to be from now on. We knew we gonna\nhave to work. That\u2019s what was told from the youngsters who came, that we\u2019re gonna\nhave to work.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Yeah, but we never knew that there\u2019s gonna be a separation of people. Now, the\nyoung people who came before from Austria and Germany, they never te \u2014 told us,\nor they didn\u2019t know. They only knew Kristallnacht, then we run away. And already\nat that time, they have groups to go to other countries and organize people, just\ntelling them. And that\u2019s how the underground has started.",
        "A: And those people joined with the und \u2014 and like I said before, the only thing\nwhich has saved the Jews who were saved in Belgium is because the resistance or\nunderground, whatever you call it, were one group, Jews and non-Jews, where\nFrance didn\u2019t have that and Holland didn\u2019t have that. You know, at the museum\nhere, you have the pictures.",
        "A: There\u2019s one young man who was a physician in Belgium and h-he was Jewish\nand he was one of the first organizers. Somehow he was able to get a message to\nEngland, and a friend of his stole a plane and bombed the Gestapo in Belgium.",
        "A: It just broke windows, but there was a way to respond to anything. And at least\nyou felt there\u2019s somebody else who 1s having that fear.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: I hope not.",
        "A: I hope not. I never thought of it. You know, that thought never came to me, that\nhe would leave his child.",

        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Well, they were surprised that my husband would go, but I felt it would be wrong\nof me \u2014 why shouldn\u2019t he go if he could help us? We didn\u2019t know. Like I say, in the\nwildest dreams you couldn\u2019t imagine what was waiting for the people.",
        "A: Well, we know the \u2014 we knew those people.",
        "A: Some of them.",
        "A: No, he too knew those people. Don\u2019t forget, we were young \u2014 we were young,\nand we have met those young people coming, through other young people in\nBelgium who were ready to fight. Not every young man left, because they felt we\nhave to defend the people who are still there, which they did. And mainly the people\nwho came from Austria and Germany, they needed a place to stay, and we have a\nattic. We call it the mansard.",
        "A: Marset(ph).",
        "A: No, no, no, in mansard.\nApril 21, 2011",

        "A: And then we made keys.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t see them. And once my sister-in-law left, I took her apartment. She\nmoved her things, we had the main floor, because my husband had the room where\nhe was doing tailoring at home to make some money. And when she moved, I\nmoved to her apartment on the third floor, and the downstairs we rented to an elderly\ncouple who had the grocery stores, the little they could get. And so mainly they were\nselling flowers. But that was it. And the people stayed there til the beginning of \u201943,\nbut they were not there all the time. Those two people \u2014",
        "A: Yes, the two people who\u2019s there permanently had people coming with\ninformation, with pamphlets.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was my main involvement.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Not really. You don\u2019t talk about those things. And another thing, we didn\u2019t even\nknow what they were exchanging. Like my sister and brother-in-law, they were in\nthe ar \u2014 my married sister and her husband \u2014",
        "A: Yes, they were with the underground, and they were working in a basement of a\nchurch the whole time of the war, since 1940. Food was supplied and anything. That\nwas an exchange place for ammunition. I didn\u2019t know, and they didn't know of what\nI have there. And they didn't know the exchange over there. But where they were is\nfalse pay \u2014 papers and ammunition exchange. People brought and other people came\nto get the things.",
        "A: They changed because my father was at the rabbi\u2019s house with 10 other people to\narrange for a burial, which was in secret.",
        "A: And one of them, they were denounced and they were arrested in August of\n1942.",

        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I have a picture of them.",
        "A: Yeah, because once we had the yellow star, that was in \u2014 the yellow star, we got\nthe yellow star in 1940, and the Germans were walking freely in the caf\u00e9s in\nBelgium, sure, because they felt they were the \u2014 the heroes, the victors.",
        "A: No, unless they were in charge to check our papers.",
        "A: No.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, we were on a streetcar, and we had to run because they were on one side,\nthen they would \u2014 came smart, and they were on both side of the tram, you know,\nthe entrance and the exit.",
        "A: Not as Jewish, they would take you. They would arrest you.",
        "A: Or when people were stand \u2014 in 1940, we had to buy the yellow star and we had\nto stay in line to get the food rations, because food was on rations. And of course\nyou stayed in line in this small grocery store, wherever they had food, they had. And\nthat\u2019s where they come and examine Jews. So you were lucky if you passed, and if\ngot a half a bread or something, or certain things, and not being caught.",
        "A: To work? No, I didn\u2019t go. I didn't go to work any more once I became pregnant.\nAnd you know, in the middle months \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Well, whatever food my mother has, we shared. And I was selling my husband\u2019s\nclothes, and that gave me food. And also, what we had in Belgium, young women\nApril 21, 2011\nwith their babies \u2014 we had to go to clinics where we got \u2014 where the babies were\nexamine. You had to go every week til the baby was six months.",
        "A: In those places you have physicians or doctors, whatever you call it, with\nmedications, care and food for the child. There was one lady by the name Madame\nLouise who was kind and generous and giving me once 1n awhile food for Josiane.\nBut it\u2019s so unbelievable today to realize that those kind and generous people were\nrisking their own lives, because if they would be caught, they would be shot on the\nspot, no question ask. They have a monument in Brussels, with two people who\nwere trying to run away, and they were shot by the Germans. It\u2019s hard today to think\nof the courage and the bravery of so many kind people. There was no money\ninvolved, there was no glory involved. Here on the fifth floor, if you ever have a\nchance, see that documentary of five people. There\u2019s two priests and three women,\nand they were ask \u2014 because thanks to them who started to organize it, that we had\n4,000 Jewish people who were saved in Belgium.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: No. What did really happen, there were three ships. Two were put in flames and\nburn, and one made it to England. My husband happened to be on the one who\ncame to England, but we didn\u2019t know about that tragedy til after the war, because\nthe first things the Germans did is t-take away the radios. You had to bring the\nradios to a destination, and eve \u2014",
        "A: Just the Jews.",
        "A: And it was easy for them to find out who has a radio, because you had to register\nyour radio and you paid like \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you \u2014 a fee, or taxes, whatever you call. And it\u2019s so hard when I speak to young\npeople to make them understand the importance of not having a radio.",
        "A: \u2014 because today you have so many gadgets of communication, so there\u2019s not the\nproblem, and that was our biggest problem, that we were cut off completely from the\nrest of the world. Also, bicycles were taken away.",
        "A: The bicycles were \u2014 but the first order of confiscation thing \u2014 and you got a\nnumber \u2014 they were so organized during it, they had the number to give you when\nApril 21, 2011\nthey took the radio away. And just to give you an idea of the importance of the\nradio, when we got married in 1938, part of the family got together, in order to be\nable to buy us a radio. My parents didn\u2019t have a radio, because it was too costly. So\nhow you explain to young people today \u2014 I always mention that, and once when I\nspoke to another place, one of the teachers had slides that 1n German this \u2014 they did\nthat, take away the radios. But my son-in-law Freddie, who is from Austria, he said\n\u2014 he lived in an apartment building, and he said he was not 10, because at 10 he left\nalready for England, and he said they had a German neighbor, and he got a radio,\nbecause that\u2019s the only way you heard Hitler\u2019s speeches. Where in Belgium was\njust the opposite. But it\u2019s very di \u2014\n[break]",

You know,\nhow you just \u2014 the more and more \u2014 this \u2014 this is in me, and I have a hard time. How\ndid those people survive those agony, the daily agony, I think? The daily fears. And\nyou didn\u2019t know if next minute you gonna be arrested.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",

        "A: Yes.",

And they have different program,\nmainly lunches, shows, and just a matter of getting people together before they have\nApril 21, 2011\nto go to assisted living or have to live with somebody else to be helped. You know, I\nwent to school in the Bronx, I went to school in New York, and they still talk about\nthat period, which is wonderful. But I can\u2019t describe \u2014 I don\u2019t have that. I don\u2019t have\nthat conversation. And we were very close with our friends. I had two friends, they\nhad money, a lot. They hired somebody to take them to Switzerland.

        "A: The time and the dates and how many people on each one. And that\u2019s how I have\nlearned, through the German young woman, the reporter, about all those things\nwhich \u2014 which has happened.",
        "A: Yep. [break]\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: As soon each day were passing, we were more frightened, more \u2014 petrified would\nbe better words.",
        "A: Because we were not prepared for that, specially we have been advised that we\nwould not be occupied, so we were still hoping that things would remain as normal,\nif you could use the word normal for such a situation. But it didn\u2019t happen, so \u2014 an \u2014",
        "A: Of the unknown.",
        "A: Okay, first of all it started out that the Germans in big trucks passed different\nneighborhoods with loudspeaker and announcing of the different rules they gonna\nhave. And if we are not gonna obey, we gonna be punished. The first assignment\nwas to take our radios, to bring them to a different destination. Then also the Jewish\norganizations has had our yellow stars, which we had to buy. We also had to collect\nour food stamps, and with those stamps you are allowed to buy whatever any store\nhad available, but you had to have the food stamps in order to buy. The Germans\nstarted to \u2014 and people lined up 1n different little store. Don\u2019t forget there was not\nlike a big shopping center or a big food market you go today with the list and you\nApril 21, 2011\nbuy whatever you need. You could only buy certain thing. And in Belgium they still\nhad small stores, and each stores had different products to sell. So you know one day\nthis store is gonna have certain thing, and that this day another store is gonna have\nthe \u2014 have thing. And the Germans started to check the people in line, and you never\nknow who was gonna be checked, and you never knew which store is gonna be\nchecked. So you see, our fear \u2014 there must be a better word than I use, fear, because\nit was more than just fear. Because you were just looking in the side or on the back\nof \u2014 if somebody is following you. And another thing what the Germans did already\nin the beginning on, in Belgium they had street cars. There\u2019s an entrance and an\nexit, so what they were doing, one soldier at the exit, one at the entrance, and in\nbetween time to check people. They started to do that at the end of 1940. In the\nbeginning people were using the streetcar and whenever you saw somebody coming\nup, you went down on the other side. But this way you had no chance of going there,\nor going there.\nAnd after you \u2014",
        "A: Well, they haven\u2019t found me, not at that time. And many others they did. And a\nfriend of mine who was on one of those cars, and there were a lot of people so she\nwas standing and holding on where you stand here on a streetcar, and she got so\nApril 21, 2011\nscared, and she wanted to jump off it and she fell off 1t and got killed on the spot,\njumping off. Because \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you could say it\u2019s fear, was more \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 than fear.",
        "A: Terror is the word, I couldn\u2019t find that one. We were really terrorized. And also\nthere was a time when we had to put our radios to a certain destination.",
        "A: And that made it even worse, because then it cut completely off communication.\nAnd that\u2019s the only communication we had in Belgium from the outside world, and\nwe didn't have the radio. And then they confiscated the bicycles.",
        "A: Oh, that was not til my father was taken away. That really made up the decision\nfor me, if I wanted or not.",
        "A: Because I could never imagine if that\u2019s a possibility. Somehow I felt those people\nwould be protected, and I didn't know. So once my father was taken away in \u00b042, I\nreally had absolutely no choice, but I still couldn\u2019t make up a decision.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Not very much.",
        "A: At that time she had already three.",
        "A: Yes. And before she went to work in the basement of the church, they took the\nthree boys away in hiding. Because the same group who put them \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in the particular job, they had them.",
        "A: Her boys?",
        "A: Hopefully, yes.",
        "A: You know, even putting a child in hiding, you still didn't know.",
        "A: Because we didn\u2019t know anything. And another thing, we were not allowed to\nknow where those children would be put into hiding, because 1n case we would be\nApril 21, 2011\narrested, or stopped, we used to call 1t, we would be beaten and probably give out\nthe names. And that was the reason of not knowing \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 where the children would be.",
        "A: But it was differently [indecipherable]. Don\u2019t forget, she was with her husband\nthrough the time, so there was two people deciding, and they couldn\u2019t keep the three\nboys together if they wanted to go to work.",
        "A: In the resistant movements, and their job was in that basement, which they\nhaven\u2019t gone out from \u00b040 til the end of \u201944 when Belgium was liberated. They were\nmaking false papers. They were also making exchange of ammunition. People knew\nwhere to deposit whatever they had to deposit and pick up what has to be pick up.\nEven without names this was \u2014 that\u2019s why it was so difficult, and that\u2019s why\nBelgium was very lucky that the resistant, with Jewish people and non-Jewish\npeople had been working together. And because of that, and the dedication of so\nmany brave and \u2014 and kind people, so many, like I said before, 4,000 Jewish chil-\nchildren were able to be saved. Don\u2019t forget among the children saved were also\nchildren who came previously from Belgium and from \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 Austria and Germany.",
        "A: So for small country, the more you think about it today, and the more and more\npeople study the history of that period of time, it\u2019s hard for them even to imagine the\npossibility of people, who knowing \u2014 they had big signs or posters on each corners,\nif we find a Jewish person, the person\u2019s gonna be shot for hiding a Jew. And they\ndid that, killing people. Some teachers have been arrested because they were \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014\nit was easier for them to hide some children. So it\u2019s really unbelievably like a\nmiracle, you would say \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to be able to save that number of children in a very small country, because\nBelgium is about the size of New Jersey. Food was rationed and there was no\nmoney exchanged, and pille \u2014 people were willing to risk their lives.",
        "A: Unbelievable. I still today have the pain of her crying and leaving, can you\nbelieve that? You ca \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 you can\u2019t say that, because we didn't know if the\ndecision we made was right or not. We didn\u2019t know what ever gonna happen to us.\nWe never know who\u2019s gonna take care of mine child, my precious child.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Very much so, because everybody just loves her.",
        "A: She used to sing for her supper at the age of one.",
        "A: That\u2019s why you see that picture, she and my mother.",
        "A: When she used to get \u2014 I used to make her clothes.",
        "A: And whenever she got something new she used to come to my mother. And she\ndidn\u2019t speak at that time, but she was just showing her, like this.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Correct. Except the two ladies who came, and also friends who came til she was\nthree. So she had seen people with me, and people with her.",
        "A: Because, number one, she didn\u2019t want to leave me. Not only crying, screaming,\nshe didn't want to go. And also, she was not allowed to take a toy, because we were\nApril 21, 2011\n\u2014 you know, we were afraid in case somebody would see somebody with the child\nand the toy, it would become suspicious.",
        "A: No, never met them.",
        "A: Completely, to both of us.",
        "A: Yeah, I think I would recognize if I would see them today, because this is so\nimpact in you subconscious that you see \u2014 like I\u2019m sitting now and talking with you,\nI still have heart-beatings of that period, of that moment, just her leaving me and\ncrying. They were lovely, nice ladies.",
        "A: I think they were older than me, because don\u2019t forget, that was about \u2014 very\nyoung time for me.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Maybe about \u2014 yes, you right.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: But you see, again, I don\u2019t look at them of any age, I look at them just as people\nwho have tried to help, if that\u2019s the word. [indecipherable]",
        "A: They had to be, otherwise they could never get the child, otherwise the child\nwould cry or scream all the way, til they would be someplace. And another thing\nwhich was very difficult, because we were not allowed to know where those\nchildren would be taken, because in case we would be caught, and by beating, and of\ncourse you would tell anything, no matter what.",
        "A: It was daytime, after lunch.",
        "A: I guess they were waiting, you know, for the child to be fed. You know,\neverything was just like when you think now, it makes so much sense of the actions\nor whatever they were doing, on such an important time, or unbelievable time 1n our\nlives. Or undescribable words, I can\u2019t find words of describing such a trauma.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s why I collapsed.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I chose in the movie I was telling you \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 about that schoolteacher in Poland who was saving children.",
        "A: And they showed in that documentary, how one of the mothers, and she took\naway her child, how she collapsed and couldn\u2019t breathe and couldn\u2019t move for a\nlong time. Because you \u2014 there 1s \u2014 for me anyway, there\u2019s no words I could\ndescribe such emotions. They\u2019re painful emotions really, unless there\u2019s another\nword. I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, only my mother knew.",
        "A: But sh \u2014",
        "A: No, I waited a few ta \u2014 a few days, because I was not able even to move. This\nhad such a impact, which 1s still with me today. I still hear the cry. And I had no way\nof helping her. It\u2019s not when you have a child and falling and you take the child and\nyou kiss to make good.",
        "A: That was not what you could do.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: How you call functioning?",
        "A: It just didn\u2019t pick up.",
        "A: It couldn\u2019t pick up, because li \u2014 you all lives, it\u2019s not the same life you had\nbefore, because all of a sudden you just one, and you don\u2019t have a child to hug, or a\nchild to hug you. So this is the hardest thing. You really have to try to continue\nbreathing or continue living. Thanks.",
        "A: It continue and started to worry us more. Don\u2019t forget, like I told you, my father\nwas already taken away and the whole concept of life is already different thinking.\nWhat\u2019s gonna happen within a minute? We don\u2019t know, because we were like\nchased, like you chase a dog sometime, and we didn\u2019t know where the drop would\nbe. We didn\u2019t. Because it just seem according to other countries, that in Belgium\nthey were a little different, the Nazis, because they knew that the Belgium people\nApril 21, 2011\nwould help us \u2014 much help it would be available. Although in Belgium we had an\norganization, the black shirts, who were working with the Nazis and helping the\nNazis deport the Jews, because many of those people who have denounced the Jews,\nwhatever it was, in the house, in their place, it was taken by the Germans. And\nanybody who has denounced the Jews got part of that \u2014 whatever they were able to\nsteal and take away.",
        "A: Only if you were that kind of a person.",
        "A: But then again, how could you put the two together, when you have so many\npeople of any background, of any religion, who were willing to risk their lives, just\nto sha \u2014 to save one child?",
        "A: In the month of August.",
        "A: I think 1t was October.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I was still in the apartment, this was the [indecipherable] the decision of me\ngoing into hiding, and my mother going into hiding.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, we tried to get food.",
        "A: As much it was possible, and as much we try not to be caught. Because this is\nwhat the Nazis did, they organized. And they had a documentary about two months\nago, from France which is called the raffier(ph), which really means the round-up.\nHow they have collected and taking the Jews from France, which was the same\norder as they did it in Belgium.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Everybody did.",
        "A: Well, in 1943 I went into hiding. My mother was working 1n a old age home, and\nshe was able to stay there. But being in hiding I \u2014 I was hiding in a small farm,\nwhich was run by an elderly couple. And the brother of \u2014 of Constant(ph) lived\nApril 21, 2011\nwith them. Very kind people. Very old, compare to me, but they were very kind.\nTheir main purpose of keeping that little farm was just the chickens so they would\nhave eggs. And they were exchanging some of the eggs with another farm for\nsomething else. They would \u2014",
        "A: Through the underground.",
        "A: The same people who took Josiane, they got other people in contact, and they\ngot other people in contact. It was just a big circle \u2014",
        "A: Or whatever, I don\u2019t know, you prob \u2014",
        "A: Network.",
        "A: Which of course we didn\u2019t know that word either. And it didn\u2019t exist, because\nwithout radios and without telephone and with any kind of communication, it just is\na miracle, if that\u2019s what you want to call it. An unbelievable way of putting that in\nyour mind, what people could do to save or to help other people, in spite of all the\nevil all around us. And all those people have been warned, in case they would find\nJewish people. But in sp \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Very elderly couple.",
        "A: Not far, was in Vlazenberg(ph).",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t far. They had special buses.",
        "A: I mean regular buses, but there was a larger bus and not going from one place to\nthe other as often as regular probably, transportation. And loneliness \u2014",
        "A: No, it was streetcars.",
        "A: Yes. And sometime I used to meet my mother, because loneliness, not having my\nmother, not having my child is like my whole soul went out of me. I don\u2019t even have\nthe proper words to express such a despair, because we didn\u2019t know if the next day\nis gonna be better. Sometime people are depressed and have problem, and they\nknow maybe next day or next week things are gonna be better, but we didn\u2019t have\nthat to \u2014\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: It was very, very confusing, with many questions and no answers.",
        "A: Not only that, you had the feeling of such emptiness and helplessness, you could\njust cry to God with many questions and of course, no answers. You really start\nfeeling, is this being punished because we Jewish? But we were good people, it\u2019s not\n\u2014 and it was extremely painful, because you didn\u2019t get an answer, and you just had\nquestions. Like my father and the rabbi taken, because in the rabbi\u2019s house, he had \u2014\nthe son has already gone, but he had a daughter-in-law with two small children, and\nalso taken at the same time.",
        "A: We don\u2019t know, we still questioning.",
        "A: And I think much learned people still have the same question today when it\ncomes to religion. Everybody else has a defin \u2014 different opinion and a different\nApril 21, 2011\nfeeling about. And many rabbis today don\u2019t know the answer either and have a hard\ntime of answering the people who have been asking the same questions.",
        "A: Completely silent because you can\u2019t convey a pain in you which you can\u2019t\nexpress, because nobody would be there. Like when a child falls and you just kiss it\nfor better, and then it does get better, but we know that nothing is gonna get better\nand we didn\u2019t know how much worse it\u2019s gonna get for us. In our wildest nightmare\nwe couldn\u2019t even imagine that there\u2019s a place like hell on earth.",
        "A: From the end of 42, til winter of \u201943, I went and we met, my mother and I. The\nattic was already empty at that particular time.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And the couple who was there permanently and originally, they were sent on an\nassignment and they were sent on assignments previously. But this assignment, they\nnever came back. And then, after the war, we have learned that they have been\nApril 21, 2011\ncaught, and they were \u2014 been killed. But that we learned after the war. And our \u2014 my\nloneliness was to such extent that when I met my mother, we decided we gonna stay\nin the attic overnight. And I guess this was a bad decision, because either we were\nfollowed, or somebody told on us, because that attic has never been touched and\nnobody ever has been taken out. Don\u2019t forget, some of the people were there for few\nyear \u2014 for two years at least, and it has never been discovered. Anyway, the two of\nus were discovered, and we were taken by a covered truck to the Germans\nheadquarters in Avenue Louise.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: There were soldiers, and apparently they were making the rounds in that corner,\nbecause where we lived was not a Jewish neighborhood. They were not a Jewish\nApril 21, 2011\ncouple, but that was not like you would call a Jewish neighborhood. It was a little\nmore out of the city of Brussels.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know. Somebody must either follow us, or somebody has denounced\nus, which I think we must have been denounced.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: No, they just knocked and woke up the \u2014 woke up the people who lived in the\nfloor below.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how they came and knock at our door.",
        "A: Well, there were two who came to the apartment, but there were other people on\nthat truck already, which they have arrested before us.",
        "A: Yes, they were always wearing uniform.",
        "A: Germans.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: The people who were in the black shirts in Belgium did more other kind of work\nfor the Germans. But they were part of the German army in Belgium. They were\ncalled the black shirts. They were called the Grell(ph), because he was head of that\ndepartment. And he fled when \u2014 after the war, and he was condemned to death,\nbecause he has denounced many non-Jewish Belgium people in Belgium. And for\nthat was not allowed to come back to Belgium, he was condemned to death, and\nthey were hoping to get him back from Brazil, which they have never been able to\ndo.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Like worried.",
        "A: Yes. And we were taken to the headquarters on Avenue Louise in Brussels\nwhere the headquarters were.",
        "A: Yes, in Avenue Louise, that was their headquarters. And we were badly beaten\nup, mainly on the face and the mouth. This was their priority when they were\nbeating on people. And we stayed overnight because we were both bleeding. Don\u2019t\nApril 21, 2011\nforget, my mother wasn\u2019t 50, and \u2014 and the next day we were taken, also by the\nsame covered trucks, we were taken to Malines which is called Mechelen in\nFlemish, and that was a place of some \u2014 where all people were gathering. And when\nthey had a certain number, they were transporting those people, and we didn\u2019t know\nto where or what. And I think this is why it scared us constantly, is the fear of not\nknowing. Because I think we young people, if we would have even suspect what hell\nis, we knew it from reading, but we didn\u2019t know the real existence of hell, I think we\nwould all killed ourself, if we would know that there\u2019s such a hell as Auschwitz.\nAfter three days \u2014 oh, and then we all got the number which was hanged on our\nneck, with the number, and on our cattle train there was \u2014",
        "A: No, from the truck we were taken to Malines. We stayed for 10 days there, and\napparently they collected enough people to put on the cattle train to be transported to\nAuschwitz, which we didn\u2019t know Auschwitz, we never heard that name in our life.",
        "A: No.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: No, we didn't even know where we going, and we didn\u2019t know the meaning of\nAuschwitz, we never heard that word. But on the cattle train, what we discovered is\nthat they had 110 people on the cattle train and I\u2019m sure you saw the train.",
        "A: We were about in the middle.",
        "A: There were no bunks on the train.",
        "A: No, you just had to stand or to lean on one another. You couldn\u2019t sit down, you\ncouldn\u2019t lie down. And we had two buckets, one with water and one for the latrine. I\ncan\u2019t even describe to you that voyage on the cattle train. The scream, the prayers in\nany language, and the cry and screaming. The worst thing was the cries of the\nbabies. And finally we arrived in Auschwitz. It was pitch black. Then they have\nthose big light \u2014 flashlight like you see sometime when they open a business, or for\nthe movies when they showing. And from 110 people, 40 people came out alive.\nFrom the 40 people we don\u2019t know how many came to the camp. Women with\nchildren who came out alive, the soldiers greet us with barking dogs. They told to\nthe young women to drop the child. And she says, I go where my child goes. So he\nshot \u2014 he shot with his own revolver the baby, and first the mother start screaming,\nApril 21, 2011\nand he shot the mother on the way falling down to the baby. Now you could\nunderstand when I say that this is never going to go out of my soul til my dying\ndays. The screaming of the baby before it was dead, and the mother before she died.\nAnd this was done many times.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And then we had to form li \u2014 lines, one for men and one for women.\nAnd in the line where I was with the women, my mother was with me, then he\nseparated my mother from me, and I knew being together we gonna help or being\nable to help one another. But while the soldier was ma \u2014 walking down, I slipped\nover to be with my mother. And I was hit over the head, if I tell you to stay here,\nthen that\u2019s what you stay. And that was the last time I saw my wonderful mother\nalive. Then we had to form lines, and from the line I was on, we were taken to a\nfreezing room, and we had all to, in front of soldiers with their dogs, we had to\nundress completely. And I tried to explain to you that we all came from decent\nhome, and we have never undressed in front of strangers. Not only because we had\nto get undressed, but we were checked if we were hiding thing in our private parts.\nAfter that long wait, we were given uniforms and wooden shoes. Then we went and\nwe had numbers tattooed on our arm, and we had our head shaved. And finally we\nwent to the shower, with screams and crying, hold onto one another. And finally,\nApril 21, 2011\nafter the shower, we got one blanket for six people and we were put into barracks.\nThe barracks consisted of shelves covered with straw, and one blanket for six\npeople. Besides crying and hugging one another, and still not realizing the hell we\nwere on, and then we fell asleep. And the net \u2014 and the next day we were called to\nline up, and we lined up, and our group went to work into a ammunition factory,\nwhere the air was impossible to breathe because of the chemicals. We were cleaning\nand the fume was bad. We worked there for 12 hours, then we marched back to our\nbarrack where we got soup which was like water, and a slice of bread which didn\u2019t\neven taste like bread. And again, we were counted, and at that time, before we were\nallowed to go to the barracks, we learned where our loved ones went and then we\nsaw the crematorium, and the smoke out of that.",
        "A: No, we had just above us somebody who was in charge of us to make sure we\nbehave, and they told us. And then we saw the fumes.",
        "A: Yes, sure. But they \u2014 they are the ones who were dividing the soup, and they are\nthe ones who divided the bread we got.",
        "A: Oh yeah, many people. And Steven got me a list of names of people who got to\nAuschwitz. The people who went right away to the gas chambers, their names are\nnot on the list. Only the people who came into Auschwitz, their names 1s on the list.\nAnd of course, my mother\u2019s name is not.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: But the six of us became like family, because we had nobody, really nobody.\nNobody has anybody in Auschwitz. It\u2019s a word which I can describe \u2014 I can\u2019t find\nword. The only person who was able to describe Auschwitz is Primo Levi. I don\u2019t\nknow if you ever read any of his books. He was an engineer from Italy. He was\nalready an engineer when he was caught and deported to Auschwitz. He\u2019s the only\nperson who was able to describe Auschwitz, really, really how it was.",
        "A: In 40 \u2014 the end of 44.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: No, not really, because every month \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 regardless how cold it was \u2014 this is \u2014 was the \u2014 the \u2014 the biggest\n[indecipherable] of the Germans, always lining up. Because there were five women\nworking in the ammunition factory who stood \u2014 we had little bombs with holes, and\nwe had to clean those hole, because the next department were putting in small, small\nballs in the holes, so it explodes when they needed it. So they sabotaged and they\nstole those. And you know where they hid it? They hid it in their mouth.",
        "A: And then one crematorium did explode. And it was only for overnight, but at\nleast there were a few people less to be gassed at that particular time. But all those\nfive women were caught, and they were hanged. And the whole camp had to stay for\n24 hours, til those five women died hanging.",
        "A: Everybody had to stand and watch those people die. It\u2019s interesting that not too\nlong ago, on channel 26, they were showing \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and one woman who has survived was telling the same thing I was telling you,\nwhat has happened to those five women. So this was recorded and people talk about\nit. | was sitting in front the TV and I couldn\u2019t believe that other people are hearing\nthe things we went through, because don\u2019t forget, I was still very young. And in\nbetween I already had the medical experimentation. Because while we were checked\nApril 21, 2011\nif we had lice, Mengele was his visit always, and he picked one or two or how many\nhe want at each time. And one of his visits, I was picked. And I was taken, tied to a\nbed, things were taken from me, which I still don\u2019t know what parts were taken.\nAnother thing, which I didn\u2019t mention before, a month after we were in Auschwitz,\nnone of the women had their periods any more, because, can you imagine thousands\nof women being there and having their periods monthly? None of us had their\nperiods any more. But of course, having had the medical experimentation, it was\nsuch a tremendous impact on each and every one. There\u2019s one book here on the fifth\nfloor, which 20 women who have survived medical experimentation in\nRavensbriick have written a book.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: You \u2014 of course not.",
        "A: Of course not. They did that to thousands of women. And another thing I have\nlearned, that the cher \u2014 Germans made experimentation in Auschwitz on babies. I\ndidn\u2019t know that. You see, here at the museum, a little over a year ago, they had the\nseminar. Physicians or people who study medication from different countries in\nApril 21, 2011\nEurope. There were 12 people, and I think they stayed here about 10 days. The\ninteresting thing is, I couldn\u2019t understand til afterwards why I was chosen as a\nspeaker to those people. Only because all those people have studied German\nmedicine for the past 200 years, and what they were doing on us, they started to do\nthat 200 years ago. Sterilization, abortion. What you call when men are being\nsterilized, there\u2019s a man in my \u2014",
        "A: No, there\u2019s another word. It\u2019s gonna come afterward. There\u2019s three things that the\nGermans did. Hundreds of years ago, if a family in Germany had a child and they\nfelt that that child is not perfect, they used to have an institution where they gave\ntheir child away. When that child, or adult for that matter, died, the family just got a\nnotice, your so and so passed away, and that was it. Nobody has ever questioned it,\nbecause everybody had to be perfect in Germany, and if the \u2014 they were not, they\nwere taken to those institutions. And that\u2019s why, when they had the seminar here,\nthey came to the museum, because of the background they have already learned,\nwhat the Germans did, hundreds \u2014 sterilization. Couldn\u2019t think of it.",
        "A: So this has already started 200 years ago, which they tried to do on us today.",
        "A: And they have books about that, and I took a book out because I wanted to show,\nwhen they had the seminar. But they were ahead of me, because they are the ones\nwho taught me what has happened 200 years ago. So this now is just \u2014 like they\nhave one book which is called \u201cThe Nazi Doctors.\u201d People want to know, why was\nit possible, for educated people? It\u2019s not like today a bunch of hoodlums want your\nmoney and they kill you just for the money. This was organized by excellent\nphysicians, nurses, educated people. How could they have done the horrors they\ndid? I tell you another thing what happened Auschwitz and what the Germans did.\nThey had part of the camp where they had Gypsies collected from Europe. What\nthey have decided and what they have done, there were women, were children and\nmen. They decide that the men should lined up for the following day and that they\u2019re\ngonna be taken to work. Meanwhile, they have given milk to the children of the\nwomen who they took the fathers away. A few days later they took the women and\nthe children. That was in August of 1944. And they gassed the women the following\ntwo days. In order not to fa \u2014 have a \u2014 a disturbing, they gave the babies the milk.\nCan you imagine how vicious that is, and being done by educated doctors who were\nsupposed to help people?",
        "A: You cannot.\nApril 21, 2011",
        "A: Of course, we all did. How could you?",
        "A: I can\u2019t even describe it, even now. My whole body is against and hurting. How\ndo you describe things like that for people who have never seen horrors? We have\nnever seen anybody being killed except through that period of time, and except\nseeing those babies being shot coming off the train. How could any normal, if\nthere\u2019s a way of calling us normal, to live that the rest of your life? You can\u2019t.\nThat\u2019s why we have \u2014 I have nightmares.",
        "A: Still today when a train 1s passing, I just broke out in a sweat, because it still\nbeats more. That\u2019s why I say to you, and to everybody who listens, how could\nanybody remain sane, if that\u2019s the word I could use, after seeing such horrors?",
        "A: We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t. And I would never recover. And another thing\nwhich I say when I talk to people, it took me 50 years to be able to just to talk,\nbecause I still feel I\u2019m less than another person.",
        "A: Absolutely, still today. I couldn\u2019t talk about I had medical experimentation,\nbecause that would make me even less than I am already. And this was the power of\nthe Germans, besides the selections. And you \u2014 nobody ever knew who\u2019s gonna be\nApril 21, 2011\nthe next one, for any reason they have to put the person in the crematorium. There\u2019s\nanother book here, the author of the book passed away a couple years ago. There\u2019s\nonly two people, two young men from Czechoslovakia who escaped Auschwitz.\nThey describe Auschwitz, how the selections was, and they passed \u2014 the main\nreason for the young men to escape and how they escape, and those were the two\nonly ones who ever escape alive, is because they wanted to go to Czechoslovakia,\nwhere they come from, to go to different organizations, because Eichmann was\ngetting everything from the Jewish community in Hungary. Trucks, tools, just name\nit, because he was fooling the Jewish people, telling them whatever you give us,\nthen we would not have the discrimination or the deportation of the Jewish\n[indecipherable]. But it didn\u2019t happen so, because in spite of everything he took, it\nwas continuing. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really an amazing book if you could sit through and just\nread it. You have to have a lot of strength, or whatever you have in you. Because I\nwas asked by one of the physicians who were here at the seminar, asking me how far\nI was in reading the book. And I said so far I\u2019m on the second page, and I wasn\u2019t\nable to turn for the third. But I have learned from them, which they have studied and\nthey would, you know, like see how this 1s continuing with the German people. And\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s still continuing today, of the experimentation they\nhad. They were number one a few hundred years ago, did you ever hear in history\nwhen you went to school? Okay.\n100April 21, 2011",
        "A: When they made the experimentation? No, there was one at the time.",
        "A: One person at the time.",
        "A: Yes, there were two women.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: No, Mengele only supplied \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the people. Mengele had s \u2014 his eyes were like evil. There\u2019s only one picture, I\nthink the only picture they have at the museum of Mengele. There was no picture,\nhe didn\u2019t want to have pictures taken.\n101April 21, 2011",
        "A: Very small. I don\u2019t know if you remember, a few years ago, Elie Wiesel and\nOprah went to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Did you say \u2014 see that documentary\u201d?",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s a documentary, and they show you the snow and they show the\nshoes.",
        "A: They also show \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know that til I saw that documentary, that they\nhave made experimentation on men. And I didn't know that til I saw that\ndocumentary. It \u2014 1t\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2014 and also you see shelves with little jars of whatever they\ntook from people, or whatever they put into people.",
        "A: You don\u2019t, because you think it\u2019s gonna be the end your life. You think this 1s it.\nI thought that this is it.",
        "A: And I understand what the other women describing in the book. Was the same.\nWe didn\u2019t know what was done.\n102April 21, 2011",
        "A: You never lose consciousness, because you\u2019re too scared. You think at \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014\nI thought, I don\u2019t know others, that this is gonna be my last moment and I have to\nhang onto it to see my last moment going out of me. You see, this 1s why it\u2019s so\ndifficult for me to stand up and to speak, because everybody had different\nexperiences. But here at the museum, of having so many survivor volunteers, I\u2019m\nthe only one who had the medical experimentation. And this is why maybe it took\nme so many years to be talking about. And like I told you, took me 50 years after I\ncame back from Auschwitz from \u2014 liberated from the Russians. I was in the hospital\na few times in Belgium. Don\u2019t forget we didn\u2019t have our period a month after we\ngot to Auschwitz, and with the experimentation it took me 50 years to be able to\ntalk about that period. But you know while they did those experimentation, it was\nlike little by little your life gets less, and you think you there already. Then you feel\nanother pain, and it\u2019s not there yet, you still have to go lower.",
        "A: Well, another thing which was difficult for me to talk about, especially here,\nwhere you have single people, who fortunately were able to start a life again and\nhave a family. And I couldn\u2019t have children any more.\n103April 21, 2011",
        "A: Oh yes, I was in the hospital a few times in Belgium, and when we came to\nAmerica in \u00b049, I were twice in the hospital.",
        "A: They only knew what was happened, and they only find out when we came to\nAmerica in \u201949, why I could not conceive. So you \u2014 so you see, it \u2014 it\u2019s not like a\nredeeming way of life. Like people were fortunate to start the life again, married and\nhaving families. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think it was proper for me to talk here. Cause I\ndon\u2019t know if people could put the two and two together. You can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. So how\ncould somebody else just make peace with oneself? You can\u2019t. You just can\u2019t.",
        "A: To make a human being out of her?",
        "A: Definitely. You\u2019re absolutely right. You\u2019re absolutely \u2014 not only because she\u2019s a\nhuman being, but she\u2019s a wonderful human being. And another thing which has been\n104April 21, 2011\nfound out, more and more studies are being done on us, that children of survivors\neither went into education, or went into medicine. And I tell you why I\u2019m\nmentioning that to you. I think it\u2019s very important, because now here in America,\nyou hear so much violence, you hear so many young people killing one another.\nEither students, or just in the street the gangs. So when they arrest a young person,\n14 - 15, who has been killing, the judge or whoever defends those people, feel\nbecause they didn\u2019t have a very good upbringing, that\u2019s what made them violent.\nWhat about babies born and never know the parents, like you see the program a\ncouple weeks ago, we were still looking for the pictures of children who have never\nbeen able to connect to any family, because they were in hiding, or the parents\ndidn\u2019t come back, or any family come back to claim them. But all those children\nwho have been in hiding, they definitely didn\u2019t have a good upbringing. And then in\nspite of that they all in education, or in medicine. Like my daughter, who is in\neducation, and my granddaughter is a medical si \u2014 psychiatrist.",
        "A: But most children of survivors, even born after the war, went into education.\n105April 21, 2011",

        "A: Oh yes, and then there was another session. There never was one session.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. And the only thing they had in thy \u2014 that room 1s like shelves with jars of\ndifferent parts, and you see that if you even watch Oprah and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, uh-huh, because there was already things from people before me.",

        "A: They didn\u2019t have to, because we were tied down. You couldn\u2019t move, even if you\nwould \u2014 wanted to.",
        "A: We had to walk back to the barracks.",
        "A: Some did, some did not.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, because we had no concept of time. It seems like endless, like I\nthink I tried to explain to you, til it\u2019s going to be the end. That\u2019s why you hold onto\nit, because you want to see your own end.",
        "A: That was quite awhile.",
        "A: Well, the nurses were different, and I think the doctors were different.",
        "A: I think so. I think so. One redeeming thing we did have, is in 1944, which was\nvery bad in Auschwitz, more beatings for no reason. We think it was for no reason,\n107April 21, 2011\nand we were still working in the factories and we had to lined up, which was the\ncommon thing to do. And we had Eichmann and Hess warning us that if we not\nmaking more than our quota, we gonna go to the gas chambers, which were right\nthere. And we were already working more than any human resistance could do,\nbecause of the fume and everything. You see, our eyes have changed already\nbecause of this \u2014 the odor, and the fumes, which was really bad, because we had to\nwash them in some kind of a product.",
        "A: There\u2019s not such thing as recovery.",

        "A: I couldn\u2019t find words, and I want to say a lot more, and I don\u2019t have the words.\nThat\u2019s why I think I told you before I started, I thought I know English, but\napparently I don\u2019t. There\u2019s so many things which are just impossible to find words.\nThere isn\u2019t any words.\n108April 21, 2011",
        "A: There isn\u2019t any words for such a cruelty or unhuman cruelty. There isn\u2019t any\nwords. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t go into the writing class. Because there is no words.",
        "A: And anyway, Auschwitz is not describable. There was one famous person that he\ntried to describe Auschwitz, and he said, there\u2019s not enough paper, and not enough\nink in the world. But I don\u2019t know if I told you before, Primo Levi was a scientist.\nAfter the war when he was liberated, he went back to Italy where he was from. He\ngot his position back, which was very high position. He got married, he had a son,\nand he committed suicide, because he could not accept the outside world. According\nto many statistic, there\u2019s about 42 people who have survived Auschwitz and killed\nthemself. I mean prominent people. When I say prominent, is people who got\npositions back after the war. They were recognized as people and they could not\naccept the outside world, after having seen what has been done to people. And I\ndon\u2019t think that any of us, if 1t wouldn\u2019t be for the seminar, happened here in the\nHolocaust museum, I did not know that the Germans did medical experimentation\non babies.

        "A: It didn\u2019t change, we all went out. Auschwitz was evacuated the 17\" of January,\nand the 27 of January, the Russians came in. That\u2019s why they evacuated the whole\ncamp.\n112April 21, 2011",

And you can\u2019t imagine that you were able, after Auschwitz to ca\n\u2014Id-\u2014I don\u2019t know what was, and that\u2019s why so \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s called the dead\nmarch, because either people died of disease, people couldn\u2019t walk any more, or\nthey were shot. Because in the snow, as you were walking you saw drops of blood,\npeople who had been shot because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 one was holding up another, til\nthe other couldn\u2019t be held up any more, and dropped. So that\u2019s how you knew how\nmany have died. And many have been liberated way before our group was liberated.\nAnd we were really \u2014 really found out accidentally, because this was already the last\nbattle by the river Elba. And I didn\u2019t know the distance of anything, think I told\nyou, somebody was nice enough who works at the museum, has made me a map. I\nwant to know what happened to me through the different times. And he made me the\nmap, the map \u2014 many people have been liberated by the British, mostly by the\nAmericans. I had the cousin who survived, was liberated by the Americans, and died\ntwo days later, because the food she was given, she couldn\u2019t take it any more. But\nwe were \u2014 we just gave up, the six of us. And you know when you see sometime\nthose black bags where you put garbage in?",

        "A: No, we were already by the Elba, which is in the other end.",
        "A: This was two months later. The reason why we were discovered, it was the last\nbattle near the Elba, between the Russians and the Germans. And of course, the\nRussians won at that time. They were looking for Germans or Nazis who were\nhiding, and many did, because we have witnessed the Russians killing them.\nBecause looking for Germans, they found us. And they took us in a makeshift\nhospital and they cleaned us up, because we all had the typhus.",
        "A: The six of us.",
        "A: Yes. We had frozen toes, we had no fingernails, and you see our eyes, it was only\na li\u2014 a white, because of the fume of the time.",
        "A: And we all had the typhus. Not clean at all, we really were in a very bad shape.\nAnd they were very kind. They gave us \u2014 first they clean us up. They give us what\nthey had, it was only milk. And because they didn\u2019t have food, that saved our lives,\nbecause people who have survived, either with the Americans or the British, got the\nrich, canned food. Like I said, I had the cousin who survived and got those canned\nfoods. And she survived with her brother, and she couldn\u2019t take the food, and she\n115April 21, 2011\njust died. And we were lucky because that\u2019s the only thing they had, they probably\ns-stole some cows and that\u2019s how they have milk to help us. And we stayed there for\nabout 10 days. The Red Cross found us. We got recommendations from the Russian\ndoctor to tell us what we should do when we go back to make sure we go to the\ndoctor, which we did. And on the way back from the people from the Red Cross, I\nwent with a friend of mine from the six who didn\u2019t have anybody to go. The four\nothers had family and friends which they went, but they didn\u2019t \u2014 although they were\nmy age, maybe a couple years older, they didn\u2019t live long.",
        "A: So, we don\u2019t know the reactions. And then once I came back to Belgium, I really\nhad a lot of medical problems.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 don\u2019t forget, we didn\u2019t have our period the day we \u2014 toom \u2014 two months\nafter being in Auschwitz, and I think with experimentation, we don\u2019t know what\nwas put in the body, we don\u2019t know what was taken out from the body.

        "A: I definitely do.",
        "A: And I express it, definitely.",
        "A: As you know me inside out by now.",
        "A: My younger sister was in a convent during the war, and she wore the o \u2014 th-the\nhabit.\n122April 21, 2011",
        "A: Yes. But you know what\u2019s interesting, my older sister \u2014 I was the middle one,\nand my younger sister \u2014 my younger sister was at least eight years younger than I\nam. Six or seven at least. Both of them died of cancer. My older sister died of\ncancer, my young sister Rose died of cancer. Both of them have never been in a\ncamp. They were sheltered. Both were in that shelter all the time. My younger sister\nwas in that convent with that habit and it \u2014 did what all the good nuns do.",
        "A: I\u2019m the only one. I look different. A different personality completely, always\nwas. The two of them were very pretty and tall. My older sister was tall and slim and\ndark hair. And I must be like the misfit in the whole business. And my younger\nsister was nice and tall and extremely educated and extremely smart. And she died\nof cancer, the same cancer my older sister had.",
        "A: I\u2019m the short one, the fat one, the ugly one \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and I\u2019m the only one alive.",
        "A: Oh, my younger sister died, I think must be about 12 years ago. Oh, at least.\n123April 21, 2011",
        "A: Very much, very much.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think it must be a combination. My husband 1s dead for 22 ow \u2014\ntwo years. I have had many proposals, but I guess I wanted something else from\ncompanionship, and probably the other person, like me, wanted me for what I have.\nBut it\u2019s not what I was hoping to get, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 I just wouldn\u2019t settle for second\nbest. But you know, it all depends what you want.",
        "A: Or what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice or to offer. I was not ready to be a wife.",
        "A: Correct. I just \u2014 and the two of them were very educated, very intelligent, but it \u2014\nit just was not \u2014 like I told you, I was not ready to be a wife. So now you know me\nfrom inside out.",
        "A: I think you know a lot, because I have never uncovered myself to the extent I did\nwith you. And I think you have a wonderful quality of bringing that out from people.\n124April 21, 2011",
        "A: Because I was much more uncomfortable when I came then when I\u2019m now,\nmaybe because I trust you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and that\u2019s very important.",
        "A: So you\u2019re doing a very special, good job.",
        "A: Because if people can trust you, that\u2019s the main way that you could bring out of\nus what you really want.",
        "A: The emotions in life.",
        "A: Look what you\u2019re learning.",
        "A: I mean it.\n125April 21, 2011\ngift you\u2019re giving and it is a gift you\u2019re giving not just to me right now in this room,\nbut a gift you\u2019re going to be giving to all the people who will be watching this.",
        "A: Well, especially here in the museum, I\u2019m the only one.",
        "A: They don\u2019t have another survivor who had been married. They don\u2019t have\nanother survivor who has a child. And I\u2019m so proud that my daughter and son-in-law\nhave joined it. Steve would tell you. And I\u2019Il tell you why, because when I started to\ncome here and feel comfortable in our little corner \u2014 I have nothing to do with the\nrest of people in the museum, forgive me.",
        "A: I\u2019m very close to Michelin(ph).",
        "A: She\u2019s about my daughter\u2019s age.",
        "A: But it\u2019s wonderful, our relationship. You have no idea how much I appreciate\nthat. She could call me any time, and there\u2019s always something that we have to offer\none another.",
        "A: As far as we \u2014 oh, priceless, you could say.\n126April 21, 2011",
        "A: Okay. And I was with Steven, how could we have any relationship? I had \u2014 are\nwe still on?",
        "A: Life.",
        "A: That\u2019s very difficult, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t trust just everybody.",
        "A: In spite of me needing people, as you could tell.",
        "A: And wanting to be with people.\n127April 21, 2011",
        "A: But then again, look how many wonderful, wonderful \u2014 you know, when you just\nthink in your mind \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 complete, complete strangers have nothing to benefit by it, except risking their\nlives. And they were not all religious people. The majority started from churches\nand convents, because we needed that \u2014 I mean, they needed that outlet. But can you\nimagine in society today that people would want to risk their life to save somebody\nelse\u2019s child, at such a high cost?",
        "A: Not only for themselves, but the whole convent for that matter, which they were\nresponsible. And there\u2019s so many horror books about young people, what they went\nthrough in hiding in convents. But then again you hear wonderful stories. But can\nyou imagine today people taking a child and being responsible for the child, and\nrisking their own life in order to save another human being, for no reason at all? No\nmoney, no glory. You must see that documentary they have here. It just makes you \u2014\nyou know, you read something of the book and then when you finish \u2014",
        "A: There\u2019s a wonderful book which 1s called the \u201cDaughters of Absence.\u201d\n128April 21, 2011",
        "A: Did you ever hear that book?",
        "A: It\u2019s written by Mandy Mandel(ph). She\u2019s a painter",
        "A: She\u2019s a daughter of survivors. Her father died and he was 1n a concentration\ncamp, and he has a number. She\u2019s quite the famous painter and author. Seven\nwomen got together from different backgrounds, but all the seven have been worn \u2014\nborn after the war, and it\u2019s called the \u201cDaughters of \u2014 of Absence.\u201d",
        "A: And they had all those seven womens \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on one evening right here at the museum when they wrote the book.",
        "A: And it\u2019s a book which makes you feel good because all the seven have written\nabout their mothers, who were survivors. Their opinion of. It\u2019s called the daughters\nof \u2014",
        "A: And it\u2019s written by Mindy Mandel(ph), and you feel so good when you finish\nreading that.\n129April 21, 2011",
        "A: How those seven women live in different countries. I happen to know two, one is\nmy doctor\u2019s wife. Her name \u2014 I forgot her first name, Loeffler? I don\u2019t know if you\never heard that name. But Mindy Mandel(ph) has made quite a reputation for\nherself as a painter, as a speaker.",
        "A: Does anybody have a clean handkerchief?",
        "A: Or a clean tissue? [indecipherable] [break]\n130\nApril 21, 2011\nbeen exposed to this kind of brutality, this kind of hatred, they couldn\u2019t. And\neverything I hear from you about your children, about Josy, about your\ngrandchildren, about the people that you ever \u2014 it has that spirit of love to it. And\nthat\u2019s why I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine that you would be anything other than more\nthan, rather than what you said earlier about feeling inferior. If you can love again,\nthat\u2019s a lesson for all of us, you know, because whatever challenges you go throu \u2014\nand everybody has challenges, just some of us are not in those kinds of challenges.",
        "A: Of course. The daily life you have challenges, sure.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
