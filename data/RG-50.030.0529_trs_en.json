Life was\npretty decent in \u2014 for the Jewish people under the Czechoslovakian \u2014 under\nCzechoslovakian government, but this didn\u2019t last long. Great Britain betrayed\nCzechoslovakia and sold them down the drain to appease Hitler. Czechoslovakia\nwas then occupied three-quarters by Germany and the rest by the Ukraines.

But, this with the\nHungarian, in the beginning they \u2014 they were very nice to the j \u2014 especially to the\nJewish people and everything, but it didn\u2019t last too long. Finally Hungarian made a\npact with Germany, and Germany wanted all the Jews out. So the honeymoon\nended that time when Germany and ho \u2014 Horthy \u2014 Horthy Mikl6\u00e9s was the \u2014 like\nthe president here, he was that time th-the \u2014 he was the \u2014 li-like the \u2014 the president \u2014",

So he didn\u2019t have no choice and he had to do what they \u2014 they told him to\ndo, but the reality, he didn\u2019t have no power, had no \u2014 nothing to say there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In that time when \u2014 when they made a pact with Germany.",
        "Q: Could we maybe go back a little bit and just talk about your childhood and your\nparents? Any anti-Semitism you experienced, maybe going to school, what that was\nlike for you.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Well, in the school \u2014 I was born in Munkacs and I went in the first and second \u2014\nsecond grade, I went in Munkacs. Then we moved to Kwassie(ph). Kwassie(ph) is\nin the Carpathian mountains. And the \u2014 it all depends what kind of teacher you\nhad. If you had a nice teacher, they were very nice, and some of them were special.\nI had the Ukraine teacher by the name of Kohut(ph). He was unbelievable, he\nhated the Jews. Every time \u2014 he was a substitute teacher [indecipherable]. So my\nteacher, she was a Hungarian teacher. And she was very nice, absolutely, she\nhandled the people, not only Jewish people, she handled the people because there\nwas Ukraine kids, Ru-Russian kids, you know, Hungarian speaking kids, she\nhandled everybody one way tha \u2014 with love, I could say.",
        "Q: And this was in public school?",
        "A: This is public school, right. Now, this teacher, when he came in, he \u2014 w-we had\nto stand in two lines and we had to go over to him and he \u2014 we had to show \u2014 put\nmy hand on his hands, and he checked if you have dir \u2014 cut nails or dirty nails. So\nwhen I came he looked at my ne \u2014 of my nails, and my nail were a hundred percent\nclean. But his \u2014 his \u2014 his hands were this \u2014 this thick black, he was a drunk. So he\nsays, okay next. Ge \u2014 next dirty Jew. He called us dirty Jew.",
        "Q: And you weren\u2019t even dirty.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: In front of everybody. I cou \u2014 you couldn\u2019t say anything because in those days\nyou couldn\u2019t start up with teachers, you know.",
        "Q: So it was a very mixed classroom, though, between Jews and maybe Gentiles?",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 we went to one class.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This wasn\u2019t only \u2014 it was a couple of Jews there, we were the minority there, you\nsee.",
        "Q: Right. Was is mostly Christians, or \u2014 okay.",
        "A: Yeah, mostly Christians, right. And \u2014 and-and couple of \u2014 and Jewish kids\nmixed in. We never had any problem with the \u2014 in the school, but all depends on\nwith these teachers. Or sometimes \u2014 I\u2019 I] tell you another story. When I was already\nin a higher grade, that was already when I was in \u2014 1n the fifth grade, I think. So I\nhad a\u2014a-\u2014a teacher by the name of Skoba(ph) Laslo(ph), a very nice man. So, wh-\nwhen you were old, I think by t\u2014 11 \u2014 11 or 10 years old you had to, like here \u2014 like\nthe \u2014 the Germans had the Hitlerjugend, the \u2014 the kids when they had \u2014 they \u2014 they\ntrained them for \u2014 for army and things, and singing and marching. The Jewish\npeople \u2014 the Jewish kids, they took us and we had to clean the toilets, we had to do\nall those low class things. And instead of they \u2014 they had the make believe gun, they\ngive us shovel, so \u2014 but wh-who cared, you know, as long \u2014 we did what we had to\nMay 20, 2009\ndo and you cou \u2014 we didn\u2019t have no choice. So one day my teacher told me I should\ndo something for him, I had to go to the post office or something. He says, okay,\nthis \u2014 for this, because you took care what I told you, you don\u2019t have to go four\ntimes to the \u2014 they call it the leventher(ph). So I said thank you very much, and I\nwas off, because every week, once a week you had to go there, to the thing. So\nwhen they see that I was missing, they came, two guys, grown up, they were maybe\n18 years old already, but with guns, you know, how come you didn\u2019t go to the \u2014\nhow come you didn\u2019t come to the leven \u2014 I says, I have off for four weeks. He was\nthe main guy, this Skoba(ph), teacher, he was the main guy from the leventher(ph).",
        "Q: Oh, wow.",
        "A: So I said, Skoba(ph) gave me off four weeks. We don\u2019t care, he says, we have\nan order, you have to come. And my mother wasn\u2019t home, so I \u2014 they have to come,\nI went with them. And was snowing that if I \u2014 he was sitting as far from me, you\ncouldn\u2019t see my face, that\u2019s how strong it was snowing, it was wintertime.",
        "Q: Just a few feet.",
        "A: Yeah. So he s \u2014 and I came over there. The other one was a \u2014 the \u2014 a ver \u2014 also a\nbig Jew hater, was named Cossack, like the Cossacks, you know? Was also\nUkraine guy. He was the number two man, but Skoba(ph) was the higher \u2014 higher\nMay 20, 2009\nman. So he says \u2014 first of all he gave me a shovel, and I have to hold on with the\nshovel like this, and standing like this, so \u2014",
        "Q: Up in the air.",
        "A: Yeah. So, I was standing there. From far away I see somebody\u2019s coming with a\nbicycle, because you couldn\u2019t see, because it was so heavy the snow. When you\ncome closer ca \u2014 I says, this must be Skoba(ph). He came close to \u2014 closer and\ncloser, he says, what are you doing here? Didn\u2019t I gave you off four weeks? So I\ntold him. He says, throw down the shovel, you go home. I'll take care on the rest,\nright. And he had the big fight with them, and he says, when I tell \u2014 when I gave\nhim off, that means he is off. You have no right. Next time he behaved. He put him\nin his place, cause he was the head guy. So as I said, there was some of them very\nnice, and some of them, you know, Nazi sympathizers.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They were the worst.",
        "Q: So you had a very mixed bag of experiences like that?",
        "A: That \u2014 that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that is correct. And that \u2014 even the concentration camp. The\nworst, they were e \u2014 th-those \u2014 they called themselves the [indecipherable] that\nthey wanted to \u2014 to become for Germany one, you know, they were the worst.\nLike, Ukraines, Lithuanians \u2014 Ukraines, Lithuanians and Romanians, they were the\nMay 20, 2009\nworst. They did killings like \u2014 like you step on a cockroach, that\u2019s what they used to\ndo. But you gonna hear the stories later on, when I was in the concentration camp,\nwhat had happened and what was going on.",
        "Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?",
        "A: Yes, I had two \u2014 two more bro \u2014 we were three kids.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Two more brothers, young \u2014 each year \u2014 I was born 1929 - 1930 and \u201831.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Each year. There was one \u2014 one ahead \u2014 before me, but didn\u2019t make it, so \u2014 you\nknow, in those days it wasn\u2019t advanced, the medicines like today, you know,\nespecially in America. [phone ringing]",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to pause for just a second.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. [tape break]",
        "Q: [indecipherable] Okay, we\u2019re back with Mr. Rosenheck. Mr. Rosenheck, could\nyou maybe tell me a little bit about your parents, like what they did, what life was\nlike for them, and your family?",
        "A: Okay. My mother and father \u2014 my mother was born in 1901, and my father was\nborn in 1901, in same \u2014 1n same thing. My father lived in \u2014 in Kwassie(ph), the \u2014\nand my mother comes from Munkacs.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s about a hund \u2014 hundred kilomet \u2014 kilometers in distance. So my mother\nalways want to become a doctor, and in those days she went in university and she\nwanted to become a doctor.",
        "Q: That\u2019s impressive.",
        "A: But something happened. They had a big business, and it was selling materials\nfor ladies, for mans [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s family had the business?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s family. So, my grandfather in those days, cut his toenails, and cut\nmaybe a little bit too deep, and got an infection. Now today you give a shot of\npenicillin, or anything, and it\u2019s taken care. In those days, didn't have no penicillin\nnor antibiotics. And my grandmother used to s-scream at him, why don\u2019t you go to\nthe \u2014 see the doctor? Oh, this \u2014 you know, he was a big guy, strong guy. Oh, I don\u2019t\nneed it, don\u2019t worry about it, nothing\u2019s going to happen to me. Well, 1t did happen.\nFinally gangrene went in and they had to amputate his leg, and not | \u2014 after that, a\ncouple of \u2014 a very short time he died, he passed away.",
        "Q: Oh, wow.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: So now, my mother made already three \u2014 in those days you had to go four years\nto university to become a doctor, she had already thre \u2014 three years finished, so \u2014\nand my grandma didn\u2019t know how to read, how to write, and she took over the\nbusiness, and they ha \u2014 they had 14 children, but most of them were already\nmarried, and a couple of them were still home. So, my \u2014 my grandma, she didn\u2019t\nknow how to order, she didn\u2019t know how to do things. She knew how to sell, but\nshe didn\u2019t help out in the business either because she \u2014 she did the cooking. And my\ngrandfather had somebody who helped him out, and that\u2019s all, they managed very\ngood. So wh-when it came to a point that sh \u2014 th-they \u2014 she couldn\u2019t pay the bills,\nbecause didn\u2019t have \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t give her no more st \u2014 materials to sell, because\nshe couldn\u2019t pay. So it came to a point that she turned to my mother and says, listen\n\u2014my mother\u2019s name was Ren\u00e9 \u2014 listen, Ren\u00e9, you have to stop schooling. You\nhave to take over the business, because you know me, I didn\u2019t go to school, I don\u2019t\nknow how to handle a business. And because if you\u2019re not going to take over we all\ngonna die. Because in those days there was no welfare. If you had the money you\nate, if you didn\u2019t have the money to eat, you didn\u2019t eat, unless somebody maybe\nhelped you out once in awhile, but they couldn\u2019t do it every day because a lot of\nthem didn\u2019t have money also, to help you out. So in that time my mother \u2014 my \u2014\n[phone ringing]\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Let me pause once more.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. [tape break]",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: All right, we\u2019re back.",
        "A: So anyway, my mother took it over, and as soon as the salesman heard that my\nmother took over the store, they all c-came to run, you know, Mrs. Ren\u00e9, just, if\nyou need something, we are all here to help you and don\u2019t worry about it, and they\nknew that my mother is \u2014 knows how to do things that \u2014 they knew it. So my\nmother took over, and my aunt, the youngest sister, she was in Israel and I went to\nsee her, so she told me the story. She said that my mother built up in a \u2014 in a couple\nof months, she made so much money that they couldn\u2019t close the drawer, because in\ntho \u2014 in those days they didn\u2019t have registers, you know. Everything was in a big\ndrawer and you just laid down nicely the \u2014 each denomination, you know,\nseparately. And th-the first thing she did, she paid off all the \u2014 whatever my\ngrandma lost, paid everything, paid them back and she made a lot of money, in\nthose days. So that was my mother. My father, my father was in Kwassie(ph). My \u2014\nmy father\u2019s mother, they owned the mineral bathe \u2014 bathe, you know, there was a\nlot of minerals there, and all over from Europe used to come to bathe there,\nMay 20, 2009\nespecially in the summertime, y-you couldn\u2019t find a room, e-even the stables were\nrented. That\u2019s how many people used to come in in the summertime. In the\nwintertime was a \u2014 a ski resort. So, that\u2019s more or less my \u2014 about my parents.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. How did they meet?",
        "A: That, I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t around at that time, but anyway, I really don\u2019t know because you see, in\nthose \u2014 in those days used to be matchmakers. So let\u2019s say they knew your parents,\nthey went over there, say oh, I have a very nice little daughter or something, ye \u2014\nyou have a nice boy, and you know, they used to go around and \u2014 and match up\npeople, and they used to get paid for that. That was their business, they called\nthemself matchmakers.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You heard about that?",
        "Q: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] the same thing here. So exactly how and what I cannot\ntell you because I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So your father moved to Mukachevo?",
        "A: No, no, my mother moved t-to \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: \u2014 because when she got \u2014 in those days you also had \u2014 you got \u2014 a\u2014a girl used\nto get dowries.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, sh \u2014 they got a big dowry and they settled down there in the \u2014 in \u2014 in\nKwassie(ph), in the thing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So my father, his main business used to be \u2014 they used to buy, let\u2019s say in the\nmountain, there\u2019s \u2014 were a lot of wood there, so used to buy, let\u2019s say, a whole \u2014\nand a couple of acres of land, and whatever th \u2014 woods were on that land, they used\nto cut them off in th \u2014 in the wint \u2014 in the summertime. In the wintertime they used\nto bring them down with sleds, all the way to the station, and he used to deliver all\nover t \u2014 all over Europe he used to sell those things. So he was in the \u2014 1n the wood\nbusiness, 1n wholesale wood business.",
        "Q: So is that still when you were alive? Like, did you see \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I was \u2014I-\u2014",
        "Q: Was he gone a lot?",
        "A: Y-Yes, yeah. But then, what happened \u2014 now I\u2019m gonna comment and \u2014 and go\non what had happened. See, in those days they took all \u2014 one day my father\nMay 20, 2009\ndelivered already all the wood to the station and they were ready to deliver, put in\nthe wagons. Suddenly it came that they called him in as a \u2014 what do you call that?\nEnforced labor.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: In other words, he wasn\u2019t as a soldier, they \u2014 let\u2019s say, they were a Jewish\nbattalion. They used to send them to th \u2014 to the front to pick mines or things like\nthat. They didn\u2019t train them how to do \u2014 pick mines, and if you did the wrong thing,\ni-1t \u2014 1t blew up and that was the end of it. So a lot of Jewish people got killed that\nway.",
        "Q: What year do you think they first called them into forced labor?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Do you know about what year they called them into forced labor?",
        "A: What year? It was 1942 - \u201843.",

When you got that \u2014 that\nticket to go \u2014 to go into the army or whatever, the labe \u2014 forced labor, you just to\nright away, give a no \u2014 couple of hours and you had to go. But anyway, in that time\nit was also Poland. Germany tried to occupy Poland, but there was a big fight\nbetween \u2014 in Germany and Poland. So all the military went through our \u2014 our\ntown. And whatever they seen, they seen wood, you know, wood was a big\ncommodity, you know, because everybody need wood to cook, and t \u2014 so they seen\nready made wood, ready made, cut, everything, just to put it in the oven, they took \u2014\ncleaned out the whole \u2014 the \u2014 all the wood was \u2014 even the Germans went through\nthe town, Polacks went through the town. The Hungarian army went there.\nEverybody grabbed whatever they could. If they seen, they didn\u2019t ask no question.\nIf you had a cow someplace in the pasture, they just grabbed the cow, they\nslaughtered them, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Was it just your father in the wood business in your town, or was there anyone\nelse?",

        "Q: Okay.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Cause he used to export it all over Europe. So now it became a thing, because\nall the money was invested in that wood, and since everything was stolen, and my\nmother was in bad situation. So \u2014 and, you know, as I said, in those days, th \u2014 over\nthere was no welfare either, and th-the \u2014 the government didn\u2019t pay you anything\nbecause you \u2014 your father is in the service there, whatever he did \u2014 he was like a\nsoldier, but he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he wasn\u2019t doing a soldier\u2019s work, but they called him like a\nsoldier. He had to wear a uniform, a Hungarian uniform. So my mother send s \u2014 had\nsome jewelry, so she sold out the jewelry, you know, how much \u2014 so eventually\nthere\u2019s plenty of times that we were in ba-bad shape, he \u2014 went to the bed hungry,\nyou know, because my mother said, I haven\u2019t got what to give you, go to bed to\nsleep. And sometimes she had a piece of bread, she cu \u2014 she \u2014 you know, we were\nthree boys and her is four, so she \u2014 she cut it in three pieces. And I \u2014 so I said \u2014 I\nwas the oldest one, I says, how come you \u2014 you not cutting for yourself? You just \u2014\nand I said no \u2014 nobody \u2014 because my brothers, they listened to me, you see, I was\nthe oldest one, so they \u2014 whatever I said was going. So I said, you \u2014 nobody eats\nunless she cuts it in four pieces. Cause I didn't want my mother should \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 sh-sh-should need.

As a matter of fact, you could see, she didn't\nwant to eat, and I says no, you have to eat too. And she didn\u2019t have no choice, she\nhad to eat it. The kids wouldn\u2019t eat it, would take it from her. But then luckily,\nluckily you see, when God keeps his hand over you, and everything turns out to be\ngood. We, where we lived, our house was the post office, also. We had the big\nhouse, and we used to rent for the post office. They used to post \u2014",

He says, 1s thi \u2014 where \u2014\nwhere 1s the post office? So my mother says, just go around there, right next \u2014 in the\nfront of the house is the post office. Then he says to my mother, what smells so\ngood? So my mother made soup or s \u2014 chicken soup or whatever, I don\u2019t know\nexactly what kind of thing. So he says, oh my God, so \u2014 smells so nice. So my\nmother says, well, if you like, come inside, sit down and I\u2019Il serve you a plate of\n[indecipherable] soup.",
        "Q: This is one of the forced laborers.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 one of the forced laborers, he lived in Hungaria. He was a big farmer, this\nguy.",
        "Q: Do you know if he was Jewish?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He \u2014 forced labor had to be all Jewish. The forced labor was hundred percent\nJewish. So he \u2014 he says to my mother, oh my God, he says, you know, I never ate\nsuch a good \u2014 such a good food, because my mother\u2019s so \u2014 it was Friday, for Friday\nfor sab \u2014 for Sabbath, you know, she prepared for the Sabbath. So he says, do you\nmind if P\u2019ll ask you a question? She says, yeah, you could ask me a question, she\nsays. So he introduced himself and he says, you know, I\u2019m a \u2014 I\u2019m a big farmer, I\nhave a lot of cattle, and anything food, you name it, I have it, he says. Maybe you\ncould cook for me too, because I don\u2019t like the food what I \u2014 what \u2014 what they cook\nthere for us in the thing. My mother says, well, if you would like to, gladly, we will\nhelp you out. Come in any time you want. And he says, this ca \u2014 has to be every\nday. And suddenly, after a week time, you should see them, we got maybe 10\npackages in the post office, big boxes, food he \u2014 he wrote home, and they send him\nmeat and sugar a-an \u2014 and flour, you name it. Everything was in boxes. He says,\nMay 20, 2009\nwhatev \u2014 just tell \u2014 tell me what you need, he says. And suddenly \u2014 my mother\ndidn\u2019t have no money, no nothing and suddenly, have whatever you want to have.\nThen, next door was my father\u2019s brother\u2019s family. So eventually we had about 10\npeople, also very rich Jewish people, you know, th-that could afford, they \u2014 they\nwere rich, and my mothe \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t cook for \u2014 b-by herself, so sh \u2014 th \u2014\nnext door my \u2014 we had cousins, also that she was \u2014 one was 18, one was 20, she\nboth came in and helped us out and there was plenty food and they took home for\nthemself whatever they wanted, you know? And suddenly wa \u2014 there was no more\ndividing a \u2014a piece of bread in four pieces, we had all kind of food, whatever you\nwanted. So you see, there\u2019s a time when you get a lift.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was anyone paying her to cook at that point, or 1s it all just charity?",
        "A: No, no, they all \u2014 th \u2014 wa \u2014 one was a manufacturer. One was a manufacturer\nfrom clothing, so they brought all kind \u2014 for \u2014 for the kids everybody got pants and\njackets and coats, winter coats and shoes. Whatever we needed, he provided. And si\n\u2014 they left also money, they paid, you know, wha-whatever. They were very happy\nwith my mother\u2019s cooking. So \u2014 so thanks God for that because \u2014 but, it didn\u2019t last\ntoo long.",

        "A: Yeah.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: \u2014 so all of the food and coats that you were being sent out, those are being sent\nfrom the family of the forced laborer?",
        "A: Of the t \u2014 forced laborers, right.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Th-They were Hungarian Jews, all the way deep from Hungaria.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now suddenly, this forced labor start \u2014 you know, they didn\u2019t stay, they stayed\nfor a couple of months, whatever it is, and then they send them someplace else. But\nthat wasn\u2019t the \u2014 the problem, because we had, for at least for another year or two to\neat, we had so much food in the house, whatever they \u2014 they send us, you know,\nplenty food, no \u2014 no problem with that. There was one night, beginning in 1944, the\nHungarians \u2014 Hungarians came with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the hung \u2014 Hungarians\nand the German from the Gestapo came in, just like that. You have an hour time to\nget out from your house. Leave all the jewelry, all the money you have, leave it on\nthe table, and leave the keys in the door. And you have to go end of the town, there\nwas \u2014 you know, there was a lot of \u2014 like a hotel type, you know, they had a lot of\nrooms. All the Jewish people have to be \u2014 leave everything from the house, take a\ncouple of pieces what you need, and the rest \u2014 le \u2014 leave everything home. And if\nyou have money, leave it on the table. And if we gonna find out that you packed\nMay 20, 2009\nsome money away, you'll be shot \u2014 put to the wall and shot. That was the German\ntalking. And they me \u2014 they meant business, because they were unbelievable, those\npeople. You gonna hear stories, later down in the line. So we \u2014 we \u2014 it \u2014 yes. And\nmy father was sent on a furlough for a couple of days. So he just was called an-and\nthis \u2014 with us together, so we were all together.",

        "Q: So it\u2019s just your mom and you and your brothers going in to \u2014",
        "A: And my father.",
        "Q: And your father, okay.",
        "A: And my father.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because he didn\u2019t return to his \u2014 his unit.",
        "Q: Okay.",

Suddenly, I would say it was dark outside,\nsuddenly Germans came in with \u2014 with about two, three cars, with motorcycles.\nAnd they \u2014 and we were sitting, by the \u2014 they didn\u2019t open the door, they broke the\ndoor in coming in. They always ma \u2014 like to make a \u2014 what do you call that\n[indecipherable] something, something \u2014",
        "Q: Breaking in, you mean?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: When \u2014 when you\u2019re \u2014 when they were breaking in?",
        "A: They breaking in, and they started to shoot in th \u2014 in the \u2014 on the ceiling, you\nknow, and the kids started to \u2014 they got \u2014 they scared the \u2014 first they tried to scare\nthe people, and make a \u2014 a -- behollah(ph) means, you know, with noises and with\nMay 20, 2009\ndogs, you know, this was their motive always, to scare the \u2014 first the people, and to,\nyou know, to make them afraid of them. So that\u2019s how they \u2014 they rushed in. And th\n\u2014 all you hear, people are cry \u2014 the kids were crying and screaming, you know,\nbecause they got scared. They don\u2019t know who \u2014 that was German or it was\nHungarian, or something. And then they put machine guns on this \u2014 on the street,\nand there was a field going down to the water. There was a\u2014 ariver. The river was\nthat \u2014 the Tisa. That was the big river there. So my uncle \u2014 people were running\nlike \u2014 like crazy, were u \u2014 one on this way, one that way, one the other way around,\ncause they got so scared, frightened, you know, from those \u2014 from those Germans,\nthe \u2014 when you come in \u2014 somebody comes in in a house and starts shooting and\nbreaking and ca \u2014 and hitting you, thing, you get scared and you run every \u2014 a-all\nover. So, my uncle was running to the water, in the snow, you could see right away,\nwhen a person runs on the snow, you could see. Snow is white and if he wears the\ndark clothes, you can spot him right away. They shoo \u2014 killed him right there on the\nspot, so he fell that \u2014 right there. I was running with a friend of mine, he had the\nlittle baby. The \u2014 the mother just gave birth like maybe a week or two years old, I\ndon\u2019t remember exactly that, but very small baby. So we ran in \u2014 into a shack there,\nand they were running through, and suddenly the baby gave a cry, you know, he\nwoke up, and the \u2014 right away. So they came in, and, get out, you know, and the\nMay 20, 2009\nGermans, get out from there. And one guy hit me with a gun \u2014 with a\u2014 with a gun\nfrom the end of the gun, hit me over the head. Luckily, he didn\u2019t hi \u2014 he didn\u2019t hi \u2014\nif he would have hit that baby, that baby would be dead right there. Didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t\nmatter anyway, because the baby didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t survive anyway, but that\u2019s besi \u2014\nanother point. So that was \u2014 we were there in this house for about a couple of days,\nand from there they took us and we went to Malt\u00e9szalka, that was a ghetto.",
        "Q: This was in winter of \u201843 or \u201844?",

We came to Mat\u00e9szalka and after a \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow, we rode the whole night and \u2014 and half a day, I think, something like that, a\nday and a half. And then ther \u2014 they put us on an open field, no nothing, no \u2014 and it\nMay 20, 2009\nwas raining, you know, and it was cold. And we did \u2014 we\u2019d \u2014 we had the ha \u2014 no\nraincoats, we didn\u2019t have raincoats, things like that, or the coat. And a lot of people\ndied there on this \u2014 on the thing, because the older people, they just couldn\u2019t take it,\nit was very cold.",
        "Q: How long were you on the field for?",

        "A: The \u2014 there wer \u2014 there was also houses there, but in the beginning they\nwouldn\u2019t let us into the houses, because it wasn\u2019t ready somehow, I don\u2019t know.\nBut after then, we came into the houses. And we were there in Malt\u00e9szalka also for\n\u2014 just for a couple of weeks. And it \u2014",
        "Q: Did people like, try to sleep on the field, though, or did they just have to use the\nbathroom out there?",
        "A: Well, you use the bathroom, you went there on the side a little bit. Who cares? In\nthose days you didn\u2019t care. Could be a good looking girl, or something. I was a kid,\nI didn\u2019t e \u2014 wasn\u2019t interested in those days for \u2014 for the women, or something. But\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s was life. And they had there a guy, also a German, the Gestapo. If he\nwalked by and he seen you, he didn\u2019t like your looks or whatever, he took out his\nMay 20, 2009\npistol and killed you on the spot, without any questions ask. And he gets away with\neverything because he do whatever he wants to do. Killed people. And we were so\nscared, when we seen him, everybody was hiding, because we knew what this guy\nis doing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. How many people do you think were in Mat\u00e9szalka at the time?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know, there was a lot of people this \u2014 not only from our town, from\nall over around. For \u2014 they always \u2014 took most \u2014 most they took them there to\nMat\u00e9szalka. Maybe they took him someplace else too, which I don\u2019t know. I was\nstill a kid that time, and a \u2014 but anyway, after a couple of weeks, we were in\nMat\u00e9szalka and one day they came and they says, you \u2014 you people are gonna go\nto work, and you going to Poland to work.

And she \u2014 they brought her with \u2014 with her\nbed, because she couldn\u2019t walk, she couldn\u2019t move. Don\u2019t ask. So the German\ngrabbed \u2014 pushed her out, with the bed, and the bed flew this way and she went the\nother way around. And she was crying, you know, but he \u2014 they didn\u2019t care. Now, I\nwas a kid. For me to jump down from that wa \u2014 wagon was nothing, because a kid,\nyou know, is about this tall \u2014 high. But an elderly person, he couldn\u2019t jump down\nfrom there, because he is old, too old, or an elderly woman, or somebody. A young\nguy is nothing, to jump down from here to the ground is nothing.",
        "Q: Just a few feet.",
        "A: Right. And they started to hit us with the \u2014 with the canes and with the dogs, and\neverybody was running in different directions. I run this way, my mother, father,\nsomehow wind up the other way around, and some of my brother went this way,\nMay 20, 2009\nyou know. Depends, depends. You \u2014 you always try to run away from the thing. So\nfinally everybody was out from the wagons because they had to ma \u2014 clear the \u2014 the\nrails, that\u2019s the reason they wanted us one, two, three out, but it takes time to \u2014 to\njump out from there even, and especially for the sick people or elderly people, they\njust couldn\u2019t jump like ano \u2014 another person. So finally, a guy comes over to me, an\ninmate already, a\u2014 a Jewish guy from Poland. He says listen, don\u2019t tell them how\nold you are. Tell them that you are older, and tell them that you are an electrician.\nGuy came over and talked to me in Jewish.",
        "Q: How old were you really, at that time?",
        "A: In \u2014 in that time I was about \u2014",
        "Q: 14?",
        "A: \u2014 twel \u2014 13, something like that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Thirteen. So he says \u2014 he says to me, now you see there in the corner? That\u2019s\nMengele standing there. You heard about Mengele?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You just have heard.",
        "Q: Oh yes.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: The death of the a \u2014 a-angel of death. Cause if he send you this way or he send\nyou this way, this way is to life, and this way is to die. Now, he is gonna interview,\nhe interviews everybody. And he just makes with the finger, this way, that way, this\nway, that way, but sometimes he stops and asks you some questions. So when I\ncame, he asked me, how old are you? I says, I\u2019m 15. He looks, looks. Well, you\nworking? He said what \u2014 what did you do? I said, I worked electrician helper. Yeah,\nokay, he send me this way. People \u2014 if you were pregnant, he \u2014 I don\u2019t care how old\nyou are, if 18 or 20 or 15, when he see that you\u2019re pregnant, that\u2019s to die. There\u2019s no\nquestion, as any pregnant woman was going to the \u2014 to the crematoriums.",
        "Q: Were you undressed at this point?",
        "A: Undressed, no, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This is still ust from the wagons out \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and then when \u2014 when he sends you this way, you had to go through a bath,\nand they change you, took away all your clothing, and they give you the\nconcentration camp clothing, you know, those striped clothings? You must have\nseen it in the \u2014",
        "Q: Oh yes.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: All right, okay. So \u2014 and now suddenly, I became all by myself. I didn\u2019t see \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t know where my father was, I didn't know where my mother was, I didn\u2019t\nknow my two brothers. Own \u2014 only by myself, completely by myself. Okay. So\nfinally we came in, and they sh \u2014 take all \u2014 sheared up all \u2014 all your hair, all over,\nand they \u2014 they call it ant-lousing. You know, they disinfect you, you know,\nbecause a lot of people maybe came, had lice or whatever, this, you know, so \u2014 and\nthey took away everything what you had and they gave you the concentration camp\nclothes. So I wind up in \u2014 in the \u2014 in \u2014 in F lager. You see, Auschwitz was divided,\nA, B, C, D and E \u2014 and F. Now, between \u2014 between each, A and B, there was high\nvoltage wires. You touch that wire, and that\u2019s it, you cannot \u2014 could not \u2014 you could\nnot pull back your hand. It\u2019s like \u2014 it pulled you like a magnet, it killed you\ninstantly.",
        "Q: Did you see anyone touch it?",
        "A: Yeah, [ll \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: \u2014 we\u2019ll come \u2014 we\u2019ll come \u2014 coming \u2014 coming to that. So anyway, I just want to\ntell you the way \u2014 ho-how I arrived there. So finally I came into the barrack, I was\nso tired, so knocked out, because in-inside in the wagons, you couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t\nstretch my feet. If you sit down you couldn\u2019t get up, if you get up you couldn\u2019t sit\nMay 20, 2009\ndown because like \u2014 like sardines they put you in \u2014 1n those \u2014 in those things. Now\nimagine if you had to go to the bathroom. And what do you think you did? You did\nwhere you were standing. And the smell, you know, from I don\u2019t know how many\npeople it was in the wagon, at least 50 - 60 \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you because I\nreally, honestly don\u2019t know myself.",
        "Q: So this was still in the wagon when \u2014",
        "A: Still \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, and ye \u2014",
        "A: But this is already now I\u2019m out from the wagons.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, I was very thirsty and was a hot day that time, and I was so thirsty. They\ndidn\u2019t give you nothing, nothing to eat, but I went to the faucet and drink a little bit\nwater. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2014 that calmed me down, I says, now I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m \u2014\nthere was no bunk beds, and no nothing there. On the cement lay down, and that\u2019s\nit. | lay down, I took off my \u2014 my pants and my jacket and I put it under my head,\nyou know, and my shoes. In the morning around four o\u2019clock, was pouring outside\n\u2014 we had Gypsy overseers, sigo \u2014 Gypsy, Zigeuners, you know. You heard about\nZigeuner?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: There\u2019s some German \u2014 Gypsies is the German Zigeuner. They also beat us,\nyou know, raus, out, out, for the appell, you know, outside those \u2014 lined up. I take\na look. I haven\u2019t got no clothes, I haven\u2019t got no shoes. Look [indecipherable] I\nsee. I haven\u2019t got nothing to put on. Somebody took it away from me. So I says to\nmyself, listen Mr. Saul, you better change your \u2014 your habits here, you see what\u2019s\ngoing on here. You gonna do what you did right now, you not gonna survive here\nfor a long time. Okay.",
        "Q: Was everyone in F lager from your transport, or were some people there\nalready?",
        "A: No, no, was me \u2014 this different \u2014 all mixed in, all different transports.",
        "Q: So there were people there already and you were just coming in?",
        "A: Yeah, sure, they were \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, coming in. You see, in Auschwitz, the-they annihilated 1-in a day they\ncould annihilate 10,000 people, that mass production what they had, the\ncrematoriums. But I'll be come \u2014 coming \u2014 coming to that, too. So finally we went\noutside, everybody was outside. And then I said to myself \u2014 we were sitting there til\nit got light, because when I \u2014 we were \u2014 they chased us out, was still dark outside.\nSo finally, must have been maybe seven, eight o\u2019clock, I don\u2019t know because I\nMay 20, 2009\ndidn\u2019t have a watch and I didn\u2019t know the time. Because over there the time \u2014 the \u2014\nthe time didn\u2019t mean anything.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we\u2019re sitting, sitting, then I said to myself \u2014 you see, the barracks were going\none barrack here, one barrack here, one bar \u2014 and here was a place that we used to\nsit between the barracks. I said, you know, let me take a look, maybe I\u2019Il go to the\nnext, maybe I\u2019ll see somebody from my hometown that I \u2014 I could recogni \u2014 maybe\nI'll see my father. Just for a guessing, you know? So I see nobody looking, I pfft,\nand outside, and I pass by there, I look, I look. Nobody. I went one \u2014 another\nbarrack further, nobody. I said, let me try one more. I try one more, nothing, didn't\nfind anyone. As I\u2019m turning around, there was a window. I looked inside \u2014 peek\ninside from the back of the barrack, I see a barrel is there, coffee.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So I pulled the window \u2014 windows open, pull one, I\u2019m looking. I jump in, and at\nfirst \u2014 first I go and drink like that. \u2019'm \u2014 I\u2019m still drinking \u2014",
        "Q: Stick your head in.",
        "A: I was so thirsty, you haven\u2019t got no idea. I\u2019m still drinking the coffee, if I close\nmy eyes, the way I was drinking the coffee. So I drank, I drank and \u2014 and now I was\nMay 20, 2009\nfull. Now I was satisfied wi-with drinking, because you know you \u2014 when you are\nvery thirsty, your mouth is dry.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. There was no one else around that saw you doing that?",
        "A: No \u2014 nobody, nobody else because they were no more sitting there.",
        "Q: Oh, wow.",
        "A: There was \u2014 this part was empty, that\u2019s the reason na \u2014 then I see a canteens,\nGerman canteens, you know, laying on the floor. I don\u2019t know how that coffee went\nin there or what or who put it in there. Don\u2019t ask me, because I don\u2019t know. All I\nseen it there, I ran inside, I took one canteen, put it in the \u2014 filled it up and put it in\nmy shirt, now this time, you know, because they shouldn\u2019t s \u2014",
        "Q: So they were pretty small canteens?",
        "A: No, there\u2019s about thi-this tall, you know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And thi-this wide. It\u2019s a canteen of coffee.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I put it in my shirt because if they gonna see me with a ca \u2014 things, you know,\ncould get into trouble. I went back to my place, and finally lunch time they give you\n\u2014 they took like in a pot for five people, and they count one, two, three, four, five\nand they give you a pot with some soup in it. Now, if they\u2019re nice people you\u2019ve \u2014\nMay 20, 2009\nyou met \u2014 find nice people, they share that with you, one spoon for you, one spoon\nfor me. But sometimes they [indecipherable] stronger guys and they said the kid,\nwho \u2014 who cares, you know? Sometimes you get \u2014 didn\u2019t get anything.",
        "Q: So those were the other inmates that would share with you, or \u2014",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: With other inmates. I got a couple of spoons myself and all right, what I got, I\ngot, that\u2019s it. You know, I \u2014 I was used to already so \u2014 sometimes not to eat,\nbecause you didn\u2019t have ron \u2014 there was a time where you didn\u2019t have what to eat.",
        "Q: Was there any trading at that point, like 1f someone had some bread, they\u2019d give\nyou some bread for [indecipherable]",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 later on, when it \u2014 it settled down. It\u2019s one thing, I never believed in trading.\nThose people give away the piece of bread for cigarettes, you know. Fo \u2014 and\nbesides, I didn\u2019t smoke, so \u2014 and I didn't want to take. Whatever they gave me, I\nsaid that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna eat, and no \u2014 no trading.",
        "Q: Right.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Later on you\u2019ll see why \u2014 why \u2014 why I was doing that. So anyway, I came at\nnight, and I went to sleep. In between, when I went out this mor \u2014 the \u2014 the\nmorning, before [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t have no \u2014 no \u2014 no pants, no nothing. I\nseen in the garbage can, I found a pair of pants, old pants but this big. Maybe two\nsows could fit in there, not one. Big pants. I just took it, made a knot, and I was\nholding like this, at least I had a pair of pants. At night, I met there a guy, so he\nsays, here there\u2019s another pair \u2014 a \u2014 a jacket, and there\u2019s a pair of shoes, maybe they\nfit you. Eh, it fit me, so I was sort of back in bus \u2014 but didn't \u2014 was-wasn\u2019t new, but\nI was covered. At night suddenly, and I still had my canteen, but this time I \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t put my \u2014 my stuff just like put it down, you know, make believe, an-and then\nthey should steal it from me. I learned my lesson very fast. You had to learn,\notherwise you couldn\u2019t survive. So, at night I hear somebody cries, mommy,\nmommy, mommy. He had scarlet fever. How did I know, I\u2019m gonna tell you how I\nknew it, too. And he says \u2014 he was burning up. You know, scarlet fever goes with a\nvery high temperature. So then another guy who was sleeping next to me says, who\nhas water, who has \u2014 who has to drink, something? So I go over \u2014 I get up, you\nknow, I was still new, you know, when I heard somebody crying, it \u2014 it bothered\nme. And I went over there, and I opened his mouth and I put a little drop \u2014 a couple\nof drops of coffee. Oh, he said, oh. And now he felt good because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s cool,\nMay 20, 2009\nit\u2019s water, it cooled him off a little bit. And then I went back to my place to sleep,\nand I slept. In the morning \u2014 again, they chased us out early in the morning, but this\ntime they made two line \u2014 two lines. One group was this way, and one group was\nthis way going. And I came out. Wherever I went, I s \u2014 I stopped right there in this\n\u20141n this place. Suddenly, we were \u2014 got a little bit li \u2014 if you sit down, we were\nsitting there and waiting for what\u2019s going to be next. Suddenly the kid from last\nnight, happened the same thing. He fell down and fainted again, because the high \u2014\nthe fever, the big fever was burning him up. And again, who has drink, who? He\nneeds some water, who has something for him to drink? So I got up, I still had th \u2014\nmy ca\u2014 my \u2014 my canteen, you know\u201d?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I give him again, but this time I couldn\u2019t go back to my old place, so I stood\nright there. And then the \u2014 the Germans came right away, at \u2014 maybe in half an hour\nafter, and they said this line this way, and this line remains here. So those people\nwhere I was going was supposed to remain there, but then we went into the D lager.\nFirst of all, we came in, we had bunk beds, no more sleeping on the floor. Wa \u2014 the\nmiddle, one on the bottom, in the middle and on the top. And there was about six \u2014\nsix kids in one back \u2014 on the top six, on the ba \u2014 middle, and in \u2014 on the bottom six.\nSo about 18 kids in a bunk bed.\nMay 20, 2009",

        "A: Yeah. We \u2014 we came \u2014 so now, it \u2014 situation improved. But it didn\u2019t last too\nlong. What happened? We had the German Jewish doctor. He was in charge of the \u2014\nof the kids. The \u2014 this was only kids, kids tha \u2014 between 11 - 12 til \u2014 til 15 or\nsomething like that. There was \u2014 the barrack was lo \u2014 all only kids. So he found that\none of the kids that I gave him the coffee, had scarlet fever, so he had to report it to\nthe Germans, that. Now today a scarlet fever, you give one injection, and \u2014 and it\u2019s\nfinished, it\u2019s over. Over there they didn\u2019t treat you, instead \u2014 and I\u2019m gonna tell you\nwhat happened with those kids, and what happened with me.",

        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: \u2014 thi-this now, I\u2019m coming right now to it. So as soon as he reported it \u2014 so\nMengele was in charge of the health, the \u2014 you know, killing and making all kind of\ninjections and \u2014 or taking the person and cutting open without the \u2014 without the\nanesthesia, you know. All those \u2014 those good things what he was famous for. So\nonce he found out that there is scarlet fever in barrack 27, I was in the 27\" barrack,\nhe came in wa \u2014 and the next day, must have been nine o\u2019clock, I think, and he had\nalways a sergeant walking with him. He didn\u2019t have no gun, but the sergeant had\nthe small pistol on \u2014 on the side, I still remember them. So he used to come, and we\nhad to stand naked, and he looked at you. If you had like measles or pimples or\nsomething, that means that you had the scarlet fever. And he took one look at you,\nhe said wshht, this way. This way meant \u2014 because in the back of \u2014 this is the\nbarrack in the front, this is the front, this is the back. In the back where the\nambulance was standing there and waiting. God forbid if you had anything like\npimples or measles or something, they sent you straight in the ambulance.",
        "Q: What is \u2014 oh, the ambulance.",
        "A: Ambulance, ambulance, yeah. In German they say ambulance, I still \u2014 I still\nspeak German.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: A-Ambulance. Now, nobody knew what was happening to you, this was the first\ntime. So he had a co \u2014 picked out maybe four or five kids, ambulance. Ambulance\nwent straight around, out, and the crematoriums were right here, put them in the\ncrematorium, gassed them, goodbye. He used to come every day. Every day he used\nto come for inspection. And this \u2014 this time we were 1n quarantine. You couldn\u2019t\ncome in, you couldn\u2019t go out. And they used to bring the food, put it down in front\nof the \u2014 of the door, by the door, and we had to take it in. When the ba \u2014 the barrels\nwere empty, we had to put them outside. That \u2014 that was our job, that you didn\u2019t do\nno work, no nothing because you couldn\u2019t \u2014 we were not allowed to go outside,\nonly in the barracks. Was a quarantine. One day \u2014 Mengele used to come every \u2014\nevery morning like, you know Germans, they \u2014 they punctual.",
        "Q: Very precise.",
        "A: Yeah. One day we take a look this, he\u2019s supposed to be here, he still didn\u2019t come\nhere. And somehow you know, you didn\u2019t do anything, and I just felt tired, and I\nfell asleep. [phone ringing]",
        "Q: That\u2019s fine. [tape break] All right, you ready?",

        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re back.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: So, I fall asleep. And you know, we had a blanket this time, with a straw like \u2014a\nmattress from straw, you know, inside. But there was a blanket over it, and the\nblanket had like dimples, you know, up and down, th-the \u2014 it wasn\u2019t straight,\nsmooth. And it left me an imprint on my face. And I was in the middle of \u2014 I always\nliked to be in the middle of the bunk beds, not on the top and not on the bottom, in\nthe middle. And Mengele goes through, and I was right here on the end, on the first\nthing, and he stops right next to me. And he looks, looks, looks, and then he says,\ncome a \u2014 raus, come outside. Well, he calls me wa \u2014 my friends on the top thing,\nthey were crying already, because they \u2014 we knew already where you are going.\nNow imagine, it\u2019s like a death penalty, you know. When he calls you, 99 \u2014 99\npercent that you are finished. And the barrack, this was the barrack and the length \u2014\nthere used to be horses in those barracks before. So there was like a trough, the\nhorses used to drink from that tro \u2014 torf \u2014 trough, they call it?",
        "Q: Trough, yeah.",
        "A: Trough, right. So they went, they filled in, where the water was, they filled it in\nwith cement, and then we use it like a table or a bench, we used to sit on that \u2014 on\nthe ho \u2014 on the whole length, from the barrack. So we used to sit there. So Mengele\ntold me to sit down there, he took out a thermometer and put it in under my arms,\nand he went to inspect for \u2014 now it comes to me and says \u2014 says, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t pull\nMay 20, 2009\nit too hard, because I was afraid \u2014 I didn\u2019t know if I had a fever or not, but if he\ncalled me out there must be something, because he \u2014 so I \u2014 I pulled away from it,\nand I didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t hold it tight, 1t should [indecipherable]. When he came back,\nhe takes out a temperature, it didn\u2019t even pull the normal temperature. So he knew\nright away what I did.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He\u2019s not \u2014 he wasn\u2019t stupid, that guy.",
        "Q: So this was Mengele that \u2014",
        "A: Mengele.",
        "Q: \u2014 did that, okay.",
        "A: Tha-That\u2019s the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the angel of death.",
        "Q: And you think that he just pulled you aside originally cause you had the imprints\non your face?",
        "A: Yeah, on \u2014 on that face, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now what \u2014 you know what he did?",
        "Q: What?",
        "A: He sat down on this thing, took me, sat me on his lap, and he was holding me\nthis time like this. I couldn\u2019t do no more anything, couldn\u2019t do a thing. My heart wa\nMay 20, 2009\n\u2014Ie-every beat from my heart, I heard it in my ears, because I knew this 1s the\nend. I still didn\u2019t know, when he took out the temperature, I didn\u2019t know if 1t was\nnormal or not normal, he didn't tell me anything, he \u2014 he didn't \u2014 wouldn't tell me\nanything. Now, he took out a temperature, my temperature was normal. He comes\nwith the funny smile, he says in German, mach das du verschwins. Make that you\ndisappear from here before I change my mind. Did I disappear from there. You\nknow what means jet propulsion? Like a jet.",
        "Q: Did he do that to anyone else?",
        "A: I am the first \u2014 the only kid that survived from Mengele.",
        "Q: Huh. In that camp, or just \u2014 you know.",
        "A: In \u20141n that \u2014 in that \u2014 in that \u2014 in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because when he took you out already, you were finished. But he \u2014 I seen he\nwas standing and waiting, but he wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] himself, but I said, ah,\nmaybe he-he still \u2014 he still has maybe the scarlet fever, but I didn\u2019t have anything, I\njust fall asleep and the imprint left me from that blanket. So that was I went through\nwith Mengele.",
        "Q: Were there any other doctors or soldiers around when he was doing the\ninspection?\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: No, only \u2014 only \u2014 only him and \u2014 and a sergeant.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The two people ca \u2014 always used to come in for the \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: \u2014 for the inspection. So now, finally, there came a day, and everybo \u2014 yeah,\nokay, now comes an interesting thing. One night I \u2014 we went to sleep. And I had a\nfriend, he was sleeping always on the bottom. I take a look. His name was \u2014\nHungarian kid, Jewish kid, his name was Gustie(ph). I say \u2014 take a look downstair,\nI said, he\u2019s not here yet, I says, what happened to him, he\u2019s supposed to be \u2014 you\nknow. Waiting, waiting, waiting. Maybe about two, three hours later, I take a look,\nhe comes in with a shopping bag. And I says, Gustie(ph), where have you been? I\nspoke to him Hungarian, because you see, Hungarian Jews don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t speak\nYiddish. They don\u2019t speak je \u2014 only Hungarian, most of them. He says, shh, don\u2019t\nsay anything, Ill talk to you in the morning. First he gives me a piece of \u2014 a piece\nof bread, and then an apple, and he give me some cake. Said sh, don\u2019t [inaudible]\ntalk. So, he says don\u2019t talk, Pll tell you tomorrow morning, everything. He put it\nunder his bed. People were sleeping, so nobody knew what was going on.",
        "Q: Was it just the two of you at that point?",
        "A: Just the two of me, because I was waiting for him, he is my friend \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, so I wanted to know what happened to him. Okay, so in the\nmorning he told me the whole story. You know, there is, in barrack 13, there used to\nbe the Sonderkommand6o, they used to called themselves Sonderkommando.\nThose people used to work in the crematoriums, they\u2019re Jewish people. Each six\nmonths they used to exchange them and kill those \u2014 those people themself; they\nalways take new people. Cause the Germans said that they knew too much, and they\nwere afraid it shouldn\u2019t leak out. But the whole world knew already, especially the\nRoosevelt and Churchill, they knew what was going on in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So anyway, so he told me that \u2014 I says, where did you get all those things? So he\nsays, I\u2014 I went to the barrack 13. That\u2019s the Sonderkommando, that\u2019s what \u2014 you\nsee those chimneys, the crematoriums? Because I was there, I still didn\u2019t know, I\nthought they were factories. See, y-you couldn\u2019t get out, but there was the wires,\nyou couldn\u2019t go on the other side. And \u2014 but you seen the chimneys. I didn't know\nthey were crematoriums.",
        "Q: You still didn't know at that point?",
        "A: No, at that time I didn\u2019t know. So then he explained it to me that this \u2014 this is\ncrematorium. He told me already, because he went there, but he couldn\u2019t\nMay 20, 2009\ncommunicate with those people cause they were Polish Jewish kid \u2014 people\nworking there, and he didn't speak Polish, and he didn\u2019t speak Yiddish, and they\ncouldn\u2019t communicate. And they spe \u2014 didn\u2019t speak Hungarian. So I says, you know\nwhat, I\u2019m gonna go myself, too. Pll go next \u2014 he says, it\u2019s very dangerous. Because\nyou know, there\u2019s floodlights, and they go like \u2014 like this. Like this around, back\nand forth, back and forth. So if you are caught in those floodlights, you are finished,\nbecause th-there\u2019s the towers where the Germans \u2014 Gestapo stands, and they see\nsomething moving, no questions asked, they \u2014 they shoot you [indecipherable].\nCould you hold this for a few minute?",
        "Q: Yeah, all right. [tape break] Okay, we\u2019re ready to continue now.",
        "A: So-\u2014 yes, okay, I \u2014 I listened to his advice what he gave me, and I took it very\nseriously, because I know that if something goes wrong, I never will be able to\ncome back. So you had to be very, very, very careful. [interference] Anyway, next\n\u2014 the next day or two days later, I don\u2019t remember exactly when it was, I said to\nhim, okay, I\u2019m leaving right now. And he said, go to the end of the barracks. There\nis a board, just pull it away, sneak out, go to the left, and you will see barrack 13 in\nthe back, it says 13. That\u2019s where you have to go in, just bang in the door couple of\ntimes and they \u2014 they are out, they\u2019re gonna let you in. I said okay, I got the\nmessage. And then, when you come to barrack 13, the same way where you put the\nMay 20, 2009\n\u2014and there was \u2014 the end of the barrack was the bathroom, so \u2014 and then the \u2014 on\nthe 13 is the same way. Pull the board, first knock on the door, and if they don\u2019t\nopen the door, you could do the same thing. But first wait, and if not, you could go\nin through that board, too. But we \u2014 the main important thing was, be very careful\nwhen those floodlights go back and forth. When the floodlights go this way, you\nhave to go \u2014 move. When the floodlights come back, you have to lay down flat on\nyour stomach, so they shouldn\u2019t see no movements.",
        "Q: So you were trying to go back and forth between different barracks at this point?",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah, b-between, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was in 27. From 27 there was all the uneven numbers; 27, tw \u2014 25 - 23, all\nuneven numbers til you come to 13. So anyway, I arrived there, everything went\nfine, everything is smooth. I followed very \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he warned me, be very\ncareful with those floodlight, that\u2019s the main important thing. Thanks God I made it,\nI came in. The first thing I opened the door they said, you speak Yiddish? The first\nthing.",
        "Q: This is when you got to the cre \u2014",
        "A: In\u2014 when I \u20141n 13, in barrack 13.",
        "Q: Okay.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: And right away they \u2014I says yes, I\u2019m a Jewish guy, and I speak Yiddish.\nBecause the other kid didn\u2019t speak, they couldn\u2019t communicate with him, so they\nwere like \u2014 they make him with the hands, you know, but with me they didn't have\nno problem, and I could talk with them and everything. So I came in, and everybody\n\u2014 everybody hugged me, you know. I was the youngest kid, they were already big\nguys, you know, like 25 - 26 - 30 - 40 years old. Okay, first they ask me, are you\nhungry, you want to eat something? I says yeah, thank you very much, and they\ngave me the [inaudible] see, they were ba \u2014 from the tra \u2014 when the transport came\nin, so the people broke through the \u2014 you know, because they thought they going \u2014\nin the working camps, so they gonna need food, so whatever, they had food. And\nwhen they gassed them in the tanks, all the food remained, so they could take it\nhome with them.",
        "Q: So their job was to sort through all of the things that were left by \u2014",
        "A: Right, right, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So then I sat down an-and I was talking with them. So the first thing I asked\nthem, I says, you know, my parents, my mother, my father, my two brothers, I don\u2019t\nknow where they are. And, you know \u2014 but when he explained it, the crematoriums,\nI didn't know too much, because he didn\u2019t \u2014 he didn\u2019t understand either what they\nMay 20, 2009\nwere telling to him. Then I said \u2014 I said, I\u2019m not going to mention anything, I was\njust going to say, what are those chimneys there, you know? So then one guy come\nover and sit down, he says, might as well, you are here anyway. Might as well you\nshould know what\u2019s going on here. Those are not workings. Because I thought they\nwere factories, you know? Said, this is not a factory, a factory they \u2014 they burn the\nJewish people there, and gas them with Zyklon gas. And he said, we do the \u2014 we do\nthe sh \u2014 the pulling out the dead bodies, and all \u2014 they used to pull out the teeth, the\ngold teeth, and they \u2014 then they used to sell it to Switzerland. I don\u2019t know if you\nhear about it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. So he says, and your parents, he says, they must have gone up there to the\nsky, up higher, in the crematorium. Because I said, what is a crematorium? I didn\u2019t\nknow what a crematorium means, in those days. So they explained me, give me a\ngood \u2014 a good lesson, and they explained me whatever was going on, and he says,\nand don\u2019t think that we have it so good. We have all the food to eat, but you know,\nin six months we are next to \u2014 to be cremated, and th \u2014 and they \u2014 they knew about\nit.",
        "Q: So this was the first time that you think you might have gotten the gist about\nwhere your parents were, that they might have died?\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Yes, yes, that \u2014 that \u2014 that\u2019s what I \u2014 that\u2019s what I \u2014 hundred per \u2014 well, he told\nme, and I didn\u2019t find them here no more, so that means \u2014 and if they would have\ngone where I went, I would have met them inside there eventually. Not in one day,\nbut two days, in maybe the next week or two weeks, or three or four. And they\nweren\u2019t, so I said, that\u2019s what it 1s, so \u2014",
        "Q: Do you think your brothers \u2014",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you think that your brothers had also died at that point, cause you\nhadn\u2019t seen them?",
        "A: Well, okay, I\u2019m gonna come and I\u2019Il tell you what happened with my mother.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Somebody told me that story from my mother, but from my father and two\nbrothers, I never heard again. Never, ever again. And then after that they gave me \u2014\nsaid take whatever you want fruit, and they give me also in the bag, you know, ba \u2014\ntwo bags, he said, be very careful how you go. They warned me too, you know. I\nsays yes, I know already, because my friend was here yesterday \u2014 he said \u2014 oh, not\nyesterday, a couple of days ago. He said, but he didn\u2019t speak no Yiddish. He says,\nyeah, we \u2014 we remember him. We couldn\u2019t talk with him, we just say \u2014 we talk with\nthe hand and the things. So a little [indecipherable] got out, but the main thing for\nMay 20, 2009\nhim, he didn\u2019t know what \u2014 he didn't tell them that they were wor-working in the\nSonderkommand, because he couldn\u2019t understand what they \u2014 what they were\ntalking to him. So now I knew already exactly that over there is the crematoriums,\nand that\u2019s where the people, they going \u2014 th-they \u2014 they used to call it, to the bathe\n\u2014 to the bathing, and it was showers inside like you go and take a shower, but\ninstead of the shower was the Zyklon gas came out. And that\u2019s how a lot of people\nwere dying there. Now, when the scarlet fever was over, and we were allowed\nalready, because scarlet fever died down, people were no more sick, we could go\noutside. And we used to work in the bar \u2014 barracks, you know, there was \u2014 okay,\nhere \u2014 here how what \u2014 Auschwitz was. When you came in the big tow \u2014 big \u2014 not\ndoors, but gates, and it says, Arbeit macht das Leben stiss. Work makes life sweet.\nThat\u2019s what is \u2014 a big sign said that.",
        "Q: Did you ever see the one that said Arbeit macht frei?",
        "A: Arbeit macht frei, yeah, you \u2014",
        "Q: It was on there. So there were two different ones.",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, you \u2014 yeah, right.",
        "Q: Okay.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Yeah. You see them when you go out from the barrack, you could see in th \u2014 in\nthe front. It was right in the front when you came into the \u2014 to the barracks. Now,\nthis was \u2014 this was our barracks, right? The barracks were going one \u2014 like this.",
        "Q: In rows.",
        "A: And then there was a road here, and on the other side was the same barracks, but\nwith the \u2014 with the even number or uneven numbers.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then here, y-you \u2014 you went straight, you came out to the gate. And on this\nside was a lot of times a cappella, you know, music playing, and g \u2014 the German\nJews from Vienna, they had an orchestra and they played. And on the other side the\n\u2014 on the other side was the crematorium, and the crematorium burned the people. A\nlot of times the Swiss cross, the Red Cross came to a \u2014 to inspect \u2014 for inspection,\nso-called inspection. So, you know how funny it was, here they burn people, and\nhere \u2014 here they \u2014 they played the music of bo \u2014 Goethe and Bach and Mozart,\nwhatever they used to play that for the \u2014 for the muse \u2014 musicians.",
        "Q: Were those very close to each other, the little orchestra and the crematoria?",
        "A: No, no, crematorium was on the other side.",
        "Q: They just \u2014 completely different sides.",
        "A: Okay.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This was \u2014 here was the orchestra, and here, on other side was a \u2014 here was the\nbarracks, on the uneven numbered, then the even numbered, and that was a \u2014 an\nelectric fence. And that\u2019s \u2014 on the other side was the crematoriums.",
        "Q: Okay, so very far away.",
        "A: So here was playing the music, and the thing.",
        "Q: How often did the music play?",
        "A: When \u2014 specially when they came there from the si \u2014 from Switzerland, the Red\nCross for ins \u2014 for inspection. And now they came over to you and asked you some\nquestion, you couldn\u2019t say anything bad, because the German is standing right\nthere. You say something bad, yo-you were so much afraid that you were shivering\nwhen you see those Gestapo. That\u2019s how bad \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 bad they were. But another thing, the ra \u2014 the \u2014 the Red Cross, right, used to\ngive packages for the inmates, was Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, Romanian inmates,\nyou know. Except, only Jews did not get Red Cross packages. Would you believe\nthat? This is from Switzerland, the Red Cross. They knew about it. Now we had \u2014\nis \u2014 what was a Red Cross package\u2019? Was a piece of chocolate, maybe a couple of\ncigarettes, a\u2014 some fruit or sa \u2014 some cake or cookies, whatever it was, it was a\nMay 20, 2009\npackage. But that was a \u2014 if you would give me a million dollars, and you would\nask me, what do you want, the Red Cross package, or you want the million dollars?\nI wouldn\u2019t take the million dollars, because you \u2014 you couldn\u2019t do anything with a\nmillion dollars there.",
        "Q: Did the be \u2014",
        "A: The piece of bread was the million dollars, because you knew that you\u2019re gonna\nsurvive another day, because you have enough to eat.",
        "Q: Did the Red Cross people give them to the Lithuanians, etcetera, directly, or did\nthe \u2014",
        "A: Everybody except Jews.",
        "Q: But did the Red Cross people give them to you, or did the Red Cross people give\nthem to the Germans to give to you?",
        "A: Okay, the Red Cross gave them to the Germans.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they came with the trucks, and they came in, because in some of the places\nthere were Jews mixed in with the Lithuanians also.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: So the Jews had to go this way, and they \u2014 only Ukraines could come, and rush \u2014\nthere were Russians also in the concentration camp; they got a package, but not the\nJews.",
        "Q: So the Red Cross may not have known that the Jews didn\u2019t get a package?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, they \u2014 they knew quite well what was going on. They \u2014 believe\nme, if they would have wanted to give Jews the \u2014 the Red Cross packages, they\nwould have gotten it too, but they didn\u2019t care. They were the Red Cross only for the\nworld to, you know \u2014 as I said, here is the crematoriums, and here was playing the\nmusic. You mean to tell me they didn\u2019t know? They knew what was going on in th\n\u2014 over there in the crematoriums.",
        "Q: Were they ever taken over there to see that, or was the camp ever cleaned up?",
        "A: I-I \u2014 that, I cannot tell you that, because it \u2014 we couldn\u2019t even communicate with\nthem, or something, tell them, because we were afraid. If you were \u2014 say that \u2014 how\nthe Germans treat you, that\u2019s it, you wouldn\u2019t survive. A-As soon as they \u2014 they\nleave, they \u2014 they take care of you for good. Very famous for that. As a matter of\nfact, when I was working outside, we had to, you know, we plant a little flowers\nthere, and fa \u2014 to make \u2014 make believe, to show the world that \u2014 how nice the\nconcentration camp looks.",
        "Q: Right.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: But they told me what to do, I had to do it. I seen some Arab \u2014 Arabs, you know,\nwith the \u2014 with the [indecipherable] like the Arabs dress with the togas and\neverything, with those long dresses. There was maybe half a dozen of them, you\nknow. I didn\u2019t know who those Arabs were, but I \u2014 I knew that it must be Arabs,\nbecause I see wit the \u2014 the dress, I knew the ho \u2014 the Arab dress with the ki-ki \u2014\npeyah(ph), or whatever they call it.",
        "Q: Were they prisoners in the camp?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This was the mufti from Jerusalem.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: He was a friend of Hitler. He went to Berlin, and asked Hitler to build\ncrematoriums in Israel. That time it wasn\u2019t Israel, it was pales \u2014 Palestine, because\nhe also wanted to annihilate the Jews, because they wanted to take over a-al-all \u2014 all\nIsrael that ti \u2014 all the \u2014 the ho \u2014 how did I find \u2014 that \u2014 ho-how did I find out? When\nI was liberated after the war \u2014 you know, I lived in Germany \u2014 ow \u2014 I came to this\ncountry in 1950, and I was liberated in 1945, so around five years I lived in\nGermany. So | used to, you know, I used to in the morning, used to get up, used to\nget the newspapers. I take a look, there was a picture from \u2014 from those guys, in SS\nMay 20, 2009\nin Auschwitz, inspecting. And then a-all the whole story, that the mufti ran to\nBerlin from there and asked Hitler to build crematoriums to \u2014 to kill Jews and \u2014 an-\nand things in \u2014 in \u2014 in Israel. Or Palestine in those days. So that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 I\nstill remember that. Okay, from there, now a \u2014 it came to a point that everybody\nwanted to get out from Auschwitz, from Birkenau, because to see that\ncrematorium, every time you looked at it, it reminded you of death. So we said, oh,\nas soon as you can, just get out from there, get out from there. Now, I made friends,\nwe were three kids, we were holding like in a group, because sometimes you had to\nbe protected from other people. Because sometimes you had a piece of bread, they \u2014\nthey could rip it out from your hands even, sometime. No, you can\u2019t blame people,\nthey didn\u2019t have no control. Some people had a lot of control. Let\u2019s take, for\ninstance myself. I wouldn\u2019t pick up something from the garbage that\u2019s \u2014 was ra \u2014\nhalf rotten, something, I wouldn\u2019t pick it up, I would leave it. Some people didn\u2019t\ncare, they \u2014 they took it and \u2014 or \u2014 or not only that, a lot of times people \u2014 the dead\nbodies, they used to throw them out by the door, and there was people that used to\npick them up and bring them to the crematorium. But this 1s already not in\nAuschwitz. From there, from Auschwitz, we went to Birkenau \u2014 to Chebene(ph)\nTrzebinia \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, mm-hm.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Trzebinia. There was an oil refinery, and \u2014",
        "Q: How did you \u2014 did you go there every day, or were \u2014 were you moved there?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, we moved \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You see, Auschwitz was like in the center, and around Auschwitz was different\nconcentration camps. Kat \u2014 Auschwitz, Katowice, Monowice, Buna, Trzebinia.\nAnd let\u2019s say ich \u2014 they needed workers, they called up Auschwitz, and Auschwitz\nsupplied them the workers.",
        "Q: And Trzebinia is just a little north of it, right?",
        "A: Tribi \u2014 yeah, Trzebinia was a concentration camp, we worked in a oil refinery.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: See, the \u2014 the Germans used to bring in from rome \u2014 from Romanian oil, and\nthey used to refine it for the airplanes to fly, because you know, the airplane needs \u2014\nyou cannot use for airplanes the same oil what\u2019s used for a car \u2014 the same gasoline,\nit had to be very fine oil refined. So we used to work in the refinery. But I\u20191l tell\nyou, the \u2014 we worked there, but every morning, every morning when the skies were\nclean, you knew that \u2014 that the planes will come and bomb th-the refinery.",
        "Q: British planes, or \u2014",
        "A: British and American planes.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now, a lot of times I was standing outside, when I looked up I could tell you the\nserial number, that\u2019s how low they were flying. And they were flying straight across\nthe crematoriums. You know why I\u2019m saying that?",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: They were flying straight across the crematoriums? Because they \u2014 they asked\nthe British, because when they used to go on missions, let\u2019s say to bomb in\nRomania and things like this, and they flew through Auschwitz, they always used\nto come back with \u2014 with \u2014 with bombs. They said, why don\u2019t you bomb the\ncrematorium? They begged the British. They said, we cannot interfere with the war\nefforts, because this takes too much time. Baloney! They were flying \u2014 this was the\ncrematoriums, they were flying straight through the cremator \u2014 only had to open the\ncockpit and drop a couple of bombs a-and annihilate the crematoriums.",
        "Q: Do you think they would have killed a lot of other people though, a lot of the\ninmates?",
        "A: They told them, don\u2019t worry, even if you kill inmates or not, they \u2014 most of them\ni\u2014a lot of people were got killed either way, one way or another. The transports\nused to come in every day. So 1-1f they wouldn\u2019t have the crematoriums, they\ncouldn \u2014 they couldn\u2019t annihilate so many people in a \u2014 in a day.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It wa \u2014 would be a harder task for them to do. But like this it was a killing\nmachine, it was a \u2014 everything was going automatically like \u2014 like today the\ncomputers with push button, everything was going there. So they \u2014 but the British\nwouldn\u2019t do it. So that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s another story. They \u2014 they \u2014 they could tell the\nworld that it was too much to fly \u2014 to go over there, to fl\u2014 to go t\u2014 and bomb the\ncrematoriums, but they didn\u2019t have to go there, they were flying through anyway.",
        "Q: But they would bomb the oil refinery in Trzebinia?",
        "A: No, they used to go out further \u2014",
        "Q: They would fly over, right.",
        "A: \u2014 further out and bi \u2014 I don\u2019t know, military places \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t know exactly what they did, what their mission were. But they used to\nfly through Auschwitz every day, if it was a nice day. So that\u2019s \u2014 they were lying to\nthe world because they flew \u2014 because they said, it takes too much to go to\nAuschwitz with \u2014 to fly \u2014 but they were going through anyway. All they had to do \u2014\nand they would beg them. Then they had, oh, we would have killed a lot of innocent\npeople. They said, don\u2019t worry about tha \u2014 killing innocent people. If \u2014 1f you were\ngonna bomb those crematoriums, less people will die.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you think there were any ge \u2014 did you see any German efforts to\nshoot down the planes, or did they just let them go \u2014",
        "A: It was already \u2014 that was already in \u201844, so the Germans knew already that they\ngetting \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 not gonna \u2014 bec-became a world power, because they were used to saying\n[sings in German] Well, today belongs germ \u2014 German to us, and tomorrow the\nwhole world is gonna belong \u2014 that\u2019s what they used to sing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What part of 1944, like middle, end?",
        "A: Well, when I was already \u2014 that \u2014 when we left Auschwitz I was \u2014 that \u2014 that\ntime, that must have been July, aug \u2014 July, August, something like that. Now we\nwere there July, August, September, October, November, December, January the\n17\" we left, because the Russians came already, very, very, very close.",
        "Q: Of *45?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: So \u2014 but, Pll tell you one more thing that \u2014 what happened in between. One day,\nit was \u2014 I remember it was very, very, very cold, it could be like November,\nDecember, you know, in Poland it\u2019s very cold and very harsh [indecipherable].\nOne kid got lost, because where we \u2014 when we went to work they counted us, and\nwhen we came in they counted us, in order to know if somebody did \u2014 ran away or\nsomething. They always watch from \u2014 from the guards, you know, we always\nsurrounded by guards.",
        "Q: And this was still Trzebinia?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: This is \u2014",
        "A: In Trzebinia \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, in Trzebinia. So, it was \u2014 usually, we used to go home like six,\nsometimes 5:30, it was already nice and dark. But one is missing. So, we were\nstanding there and then come \u2014 they called up the headquarters for \u2014 and from \u2014 in\nthe camp, and the \u2014 the main guy, he was a obersturmfuehrer, in German that\u2019s \u2014\nwas his rank. I don\u2019t know whether it was like a major, hul \u2014 I don\u2019t remember\nexactly \u2014",
        "Q: Someone high up.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Right, higher up. He was the top guys, and he came running with the motorcycle.\nAnd it was also snowing, you know, it was cold. Now you walked in the\n[crunching noise] the snow was breaking under your feet. And the wind was\nblowing, and we were standing there and we jumping up and down, because you\nhad to do something, otherwise \u2014 so what happened, we were standing at least two,\nthree hours outside, and it \u2014 he said, if you can \u2014 not gonna find this guy, you\u2019re\ngonna stay til in the morning, and we have to find the guy. So what happened, the\nguy went in the bathroom, fall asleep in the bathroom. He was so weak, he fall\nasleep. They did \u2014 luckily they didn\u2019t touch him even, because when they took him\nout, he wa \u2014 he hardly \u2014 he couldn\u2019t even walk. They had to shu \u2014 drag him to \u2014 to\nwalk so \u2014",
        "Q: So the Germans found him in the bathroom?",
        "A: No, no we were there \u2014 we were all \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 we went to look all over, because there was those big tanks, you know. And\nsomebody went into the bathroom, he had to make a pee or whatever, so he fou \u2014 he\nwas sleeping on \u2014 on the thing. He fall asleep. He was so weak, you know, he fall\nasleep. So that was a night t-to remember. And then 1945, as I said, January 17, we\nleft Trzebinia. That was the death mar \u2014 they call it the death march.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Can we go back just a little bit?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do in the oil refinery, just \u2014",
        "A: In oil refinery?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay. That\u2019s a good question, which I missed. Number one, the water level in\nTrzebinia was very high, like Florida. You dig a little bit, you hit water, right?",
        "Q: No basements.",
        "A: Right, no basement, that\u2019s correct. Over there it was also, the water level was\nhigh, so they had pipes that runs, you know, t-to \u2014 the control there was heated\npipes for the oil, they needed so \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly. Because when I came\nalready, the oil refinery didn\u2019t work. They put up a wi \u2014 a-a-after that they came\nalmost every day, as I said, when the skies were nice and clear, planes would come,\nor Americans, or \u2014 or British, they used to come to bomb everything. When they\nleft, we had to clean up again. That\u2019s what we did always, clean up, build up a wall,\nthey came and smashed it again. So there was not \u2014 no production. But they still did\n\u2014 the Germans still the last moment, didn\u2019t give up. So what we had to take \u2014 yeah,\nin the wintertime was very cold, so they had to take the pipes and go down another\ncouple of feet, about six feet. The pipes had to be lowered down into the ground. So\nMay 20, 2009\nwhen we used to dig up, the water used to come right away. So there was a pump \u2014\na pump, and one side was a guy, a kid and me, and we were going up and down like\nthis, and pump the water, that\u2019s what we did the whole day, up and down, up and\ndown, til they changed us and some other kids came that also do work.",
        "Q: Did you get any breaks for bathroom or food, like that?",
        "A: Well, ba \u2014 the food over there, they used to give you a lunch, soup, and in the\nmorning was coffee and they give you a piece of bread with a piece of cheese or\nmeat, whatever. And at night they give you a soup again. So, is manageable. But\nthat\u2019s what I said, I never liked to change. Because some people used to change for\na cigarette, you know? I said no, I\u2019m not changing, I\u2019m not doing anything, and\nthat\u2019s what it was. But, there was an advantage to work with those pumps. You\nknow why? Because pa \u2014 people went to work in something, they see a little kid, 12\nyears old, wo \u2014 you know, skinny, bones, so you could count the bones, so they\nused to throw him a sandwich, or they used to throw him a piece of bread or an\napple. One day, I-I was \u2014 I was working and a guy, a farmer, he wa \u2014 he was \u2014 had\nthe little wagon with two wheels and one horse. And he seen me, he had cabbage on\nthe \u2014 on the wagon, he threw me a cabbage.",
        "Q: Is this like a Polish farmer that was going \u2014",
        "A: Yeah \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 it must be a Polish farmer, but you know, he\u2019s \u2014 he watch, you know, what he\nshould see, he throw a cabbage. Okay. I took that cabbage, I almost died from that\ncabbage, cause you know, your stomach is very weak. And I \u2014 but I had \u2014 we were\nthree kids, and we had a deal between us. If you go to work and you get a piece of\nbread, we divide it in three pieces. I got my third, I gave to other kid and the other\nkid. And he got something, we were all together all the time, til liberation we were\ntogether.",
        "Q: Hm, wow.",
        "A: Some other kids seen that we get along so good, they also tried \u2014 tried the same\nthing, but it didn\u2019t work. Because if you are not honest \u2014 like one kid is \u2014 we came\nhome, there were the three, he says, oh I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn't \u2014 today I didn't get\nanything. The other kids says oh, he is lying, I seen him, he got a piece of bread.\nThat\u2019s it. That was finished. So they couldn\u2019t trust [indecipherable] us, til the last\nmoment we were together, because we were honest to one another.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you meet these two other boys in the camp, or did you know them\nbefore?",
        "A: No, I met them in the camp, in the camp.",
        "Q: Okay, you didn\u2019t know them before that?\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay, one was from England, one was \u2014 and two were from Poland. Now, from\nEngland, how did he get into \u2014 to this business, in the concentration camp? He\nwent for a wedding, he had an aunt, or somebody got married. So he went to the\nwedding, but the Germans wouldn\u2019t \u2014 they caught him, and that\u2019s it. It just\nhappened the Germans took over. He came in, but he couldn\u2019t get out no more. So\nthey put him in concentration camp. So when we were liberated, he spoke fluently\nEnglish, because he was born in England. But right away, soon after \u2014 after\nliberation, he went to the British embassy and they took him right away, took him\nback home. So that was after liberation already. That \u2014 well, I'll come to the\nliberation, I\u2019m gonna tell you more in details. Now, okay, so now we were on the\ndeath march, they used to call it. As we were marching \u2014 was also, January 17 in\nPoland is very, very, very cold. Very cold. And there was twin brothers, two twins.\nI mean, two kids.",
        "Q: A set of twins.",
        "A: Twin \u2014 yeah, twins. And one had an infection o-on his foot, and he couldn\u2019t\nwalk. So they dragged him, he dragged him, but then finally he says, it\u2019s no way, no\nway, I can\u2019t even pick my foot up, never mind walking. So he sit down, and the guy\nMay 20, 2009\nwas a Romanian guard. This guy must have been six feet tall a ver \u2014 tall \u2014 very tall\nguy. In other words, he wasn\u2019t walking straight, he was walking like this, bent, and\nhe more than six feet. He says, why don\u2019t you walk? So the boy says, I can\u2019t walk.\nHe took the gun, shoot him right there. You, the brother. He says, I\u2019m not gonna\nleave my brother. Shoot him too. So that\u2019s the reason they call it death march, it\nwas not only one incident, was a lot of incidents, because they call it death march.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: As we were walking \u2014 we were walking towards Gliwice, there was a \u2014 a big\nstation, you know, where the trains were going all over \u2014 all over Europe from the\n\u2014 from that place we had to walk towards Gliwice.",
        "Q: How long did you walk for?",
        "A: Okay, w-w-we \u2014 we left at night Trzebinia, we walked the whole night, and we\nwalked maybe a half a day, but 1-in between you were resting, you know. Let\u2019s say\nit came to \u2014 at one point they says, okay, and we \u2014 we had to go in the field,\nbecause the German, the army had always the right of way. Whatever they \u2014 if they\ncame, we had to move to the thing. So mostly w-we were standing in the fields, and\nwalking til they \u2014 they cleared for us the road. When they are finished, then we\nstarted to walk, so we have to wait. So 1-1t \u2014 I think it was a night and a day,\nsomething like that, til we a \u2014 we arrived already to Gliwice.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Did you and your friends survive the march?",
        "A: We were \u2014 yeah, li-listen to this, what happened. So then it was \u2014 maybe it was\n12 o\u2019clock or one o\u2019clock at night, and the Germans said okay, we go to this field\nhere, you could lay down and you could take a nap, and we gonna walk in the\nmorning, continue walking in the morning. But we were there maybe a half an hour,\nor maybe an hour tops, they said you cannot stay, we have to go \u2014 because we heard\nalready the shots from the \u2014 from the Russians. The cannons and machine gun, you\ncould hear already they were shooting from far away. But in between, I had \u2014 he\nwasn\u2019t my friend, but I knew him fo-for \u2014 because we were together in Auschwitz\nand then we came to Trzebinia, so I knew \u2014 I knew the kid. He was an \u2014 he was a\nlittle bit older than me, he must have been 15 - 16 - 17, I don\u2019t know exactly, but\nsomething in that age. And he says he\u2019s gonna lay down. I says, don\u2019t lay down,\nbecause you gonna lay down, you never gonna get up, you gonna freeze to death.\nYou see all the kids, they jumping up and down and do this, and all kind of\nexercise, because to feel a little bit warm. I don\u2019t care, he says, no more. I says \u2014 he\nlay down. I ran to my kids and I told them, and then we to-took some other kids, we\ngrabbed him and we says, you not gonna lay \u2014 you not gonna lay down here,\nbecause you gonna be liberated, and believe me, the guy was liberated and he wa \u2014\njust lay down, and we \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t \u2014 he says, if you gonna lay down on, we\nMay 20, 2009\ngonna \u2014 we gonna hit you. Don\u2019t lay down, because you gonna lay down you know\nwhat, you never gonna get up. As soon as we had that fight, suddenly the Germans\nsaid, we have to leave right away. So we marched further. He couldn\u2019t lay down no\nmore.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And \u2014 but we did something else. We, let\u2019s say three or four \u2014 four guys, or five\nguys, in the middle, we exchanged. The middle guy was able to walk and sleep, and\nwe were holding like together, you know, and then we exchanged. And then, let\u2019s\nsay you were next, you went in the middle, and the other guy, that\u2019s how, you\nknow, we exchanged to sleep a little bit. You could close your eyes and relax a little\nbit.",
        "Q: Hm. How long do you think you did that for? Like an hour or two?",
        "A: Well, til \u2014 til in \u2014 til in the morning, til you know, til we could \u2014 by then we\nstopped already, in the morning we stopped, and yeah, in between, that\u2019s very\nimportant. There was, in the gutter, you know there was on s \u2014 this gutter on this\nside, and the middle was the road. I see from far away, I see a big coat laying on the\nfloor, a heavy coat, a winter coat. I says to myself, I\u2019m gonna pick up that coat.\nMust be a big guy who had that coat, you know, a big, heavy coat. My friend said,\nare you crazy, you're gonna schlep this coat? But you \u2014 you hardly could walk\nMay 20, 2009\nalready and everybody could run, you gonna schlep that big coat? I said, that coat is\ngonna be a lifesaver, remember. And I wouldn't give it up. I said, I\u2019m gonna take.\nYou don\u2019t have to ca \u2014 if you want to carry it, fine. You don\u2019t want to carry it, ?'m\ngonna carry it all the \u2014 but th-they helped me out, they \u2014 because we three were\ntogether. What wer \u2014 one did \u2014 had, the other wouldn\u2019t let us down, you see.",
        "Q: So, it was just sitting on the side of the road?",
        "A: Was laying on the lo \u2014 somebody throw it away, I don\u2019t know, was a good,\nheavy coat, really, was this thick of a coat. And 1t was warm, and \u2014",
        "Q: Hm, about an inch or two.",
        "A: But listen \u2014 listen, this coat saved our lives. So when we arrived to Gliwice, the\nGermans put us on \u2014 on open wagons, railroad, you know, cars. No \u2014 no roof on\ntop.",
        "Q: Just slats, kind of?",
        "A: Nothing, no \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Nothing. Nothing. Like a \u2014 your car hasn\u2019t got no roof? Same thing, the railroad\nhas no \u2014 no roof. And the snow was this high up inside. So how could we lay down?\nSo the German says, take with the hand, shovel out the snow. With the hand. We\ndidn't have no shovels. We had to do, because you know, otherwise, lay down in the\nMay 20, 2009\nsnow. Well, I want to tell you something, that the \u2014 the death march wasn\u2019t as bad\nas the [indecipherable] march, because we \u2014 when they put us on those o-open\nwagons \u2014 when the train was standing was not so bad yet, you know, but when that\ntrain started to roll, and s \u2014 I don\u2019t know how fast that train was going, at least I \u2014\nI\u2019m sure, 40 - 50 miles, and that wind was so strong, you know, that you c \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t breathe sometimes. And in the morning when we got up, more than half of\nthe \u2014 of those people were dead. They \u2014 they \u2014 they died, what do you call that,\nfrom \u2014",
        "Q: Frostbite?",
        "A: No \u2014 that was worse, worse than frostbite. There \u2014 there\u2019s a special name, I \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, hypothermia?",
        "A: Hypothermia.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They died from hypo \u2014 they went to sleep, never got up. So now, with all those\nbodies, they said, just throw them out. The train was moving, we just throw out,\nbecause they running. From Poland they \u2014 we were going towards Germany at this\ntime. So \u2014",
        "Q: How many people do you think were on the march with you? Is it like a couple\nof barracks worth, or \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Oh, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 there was march from \u2014 from different camps also,\nthey \u2014 we got together, you know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, but it was in the thousands, I think. I don\u2019t \u2014 I cannot give\nyou a number, because I didn\u2019t know th \u2014",
        "Q: So, masses of people.",
        "A: \u2014 a lot of people were ta \u2014 were walking. But as I said, the train ride was worse\nthan the march. More people died on the trains than on the march from\nhypothermia. Now here comes that coat that I br \u2014 brought. We\u2019re three small kids\n\u2014 comparing to other people, you know. I \u2014 we put down the thing, we covered\nourself up with that coat. We\u2019re sitting on the snow, still we\u2019re frozen sitting, but at\nleast the wind \u2014 the wind killed those people. The wind was so cold that they died\nof hypothermia. And then we just had to throw out the bodies, and \u2014 so finally, from\nthere, from \u2014 after r-riding on \u2014 yeah, and there was \u2014 see, the Germans, they \u2014 they\nhad a canteen, you know, they get some food, whatever they got, I don\u2019t know, but\nwe didn\u2019t get anything. And when the train stopped to let us o \u2014 beca \u2014 there\u2019s\ncertain points the train stopped, so we had to go to the bathroom or something. But\nif not, you s \u2014 you could do it on the train, we were ki \u2014 it didn\u2019t bother \u2014 nobody\nbot \u2014 would bother you if you did it. And sometimes you hadn\u2019t got no choice. You\nMay 20, 2009\nhad to do what you have to do. Nature doesn\u2019t ask questions. You have to run, you\nhave to run. So, after that, we came to \u2014 we went to Oranienburg. Sachsenhausen,\nOranienburg [indecipherable] Berlin. So, we stood there for \u2014 for about a week\nor two, but then they had to ship us further, so we wind up in Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: Where did you stay in Sachsenhausen, did you have barracks?",
        "A: Tha \u2014 those \u2014 the camp.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And a \u2014 it was a la\u2014 a camp.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you have barracks, though, or were you just \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, we had barracks \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 barrack \u2014 at least it was nice and warm there. We \u2014 we recuperated a little bit\nfrom all that cold, you know? And they give us some food there, so it \u2014 1t was \u2014 it\nwasn\u2019t so bad. You could \u2014 we could survive there already. So this \u2014",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t really do anything else there, it was just \u2014",
        "A: No, no, that was really the wa \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 recuperating.",
        "A: \u2014 the \u2014 the Germans knew that they lost.",
        "Q: Okay.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: You know, it was towards the end of the \u2014 close to the end of the war. Because I\nwas liberated in April 28\". So, we left from there the 17\" January. So January \u2014\nJanuary, February, March, April. So, we were already close to \u2014 January, fe \u2014 end\nof February, be \u2014 like beginning of March.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Then they send us to Bergen-Belsen. If I see never \u2014 you know, sometimes you\nask people, how long were you in the camp? Some guys, oh, I\u2019m fa \u2014 I was five\nyears in the camp. Then I ask somebody, how long were you? Oh, I was a year or\ntwo years, whatever it is, but Ill tell you one thing, when we arrived to Bergen-\nBelsen \u2014 here is the story: I a \u2014 we arrived there, it was already like, I don\u2019t know\nexactly, but around four, five o\u2019clock. First of all, we came into a barrack, no \u2014 no\nbeds, no bunk beds, nothing. Wherever you are, s-say tha \u2014 I \u2014 it just happened I\nwas in the \u2014 in the corridor like here in \u2014 1n \u2014 in th \u2014 in the front, I lay down there.\nAnd there was not far, the bathroom was also a little further. One pipe busted, and I\ngot up in the morning, oh everybody was wake up all wet. Now imagine, cold, wet\n\u2014 [phone ringing]",
        "Q: Now, pause for a second. [tape break] Okay. All right. Okay, we\u2019re back. How\ndid the \u2014 wh-when the pipe \u2014",
        "A: Oh, Bergen-Belsen.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In Bergen-Belsen, when the pipe exploded, was it just a pipe of excrement, or\nwater?",
        "A: No, no, no, the pipe busted from the \u2014 from the \u2014 it was so cold, froze. It froze,\nthe pipe froze \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and it \u2014 it start shooting out the thing, but I was sleeping, I didn\u2019t know. And\nwhen I woke up, I was so tired, knocked out, that nothing bothered me. I lay down\non the cement, believe me, I slept better than I sleep in 1n a nice bed here in my\nhouse, over there, that\u2019s how tired you were. On the cement. Didn\u2019t mean anything.",
        "Q: Did the pipe have water, or excrement, or what was in the pipe, everything?",
        "A: From a toilet. I da\u2014 I\u2014 I cannot tell you. I know it was wet, and it smelled also.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Whatever it is. I was used to those things. It didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t even bother me that \u2014\nbut alright, I felt the wet. So, after a couple of hours it dried out and you wen \u2014 you\nwere back in business. In the morning, a kapo \u2014 kapo means like an overseer that\nwas \u2014 usually the kapos mean that, from the group of people they choosed out, and\nthey were cooperating most with the Germans too, you know. So he came with \u2014\nMay 20, 2009\nwith two Germans, and they had guns, those big guns, you know. And \u2014-ari\u2014I\nmean a rifle, they call it a rifle here. And they said, we need s \u2014 we need about 15 -\n20 people, and you gonna get good food, and we need volunteers. So they said good\nfood, I says, oh my God, I\u2019m \u2014 I was really hungry, you know, hungry, wet and then\nthirsty, you name it, anything. So I said okay, I\u2019m going, too.",
        "Q: Did your friends volunteer with you?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Did your friends volunteer with you? With \u2014",
        "A: M-My \u2014 one \u2014 from my friends, we got divided for awhile, beca \u2014 we got\ntogether on the next camps. We met up in another camp. Because sometimes you\nwere standing, and they said, here is cut off, and that\u2019s it, you couldn\u2019t go back no\nmore. But 1\u2014 when I came to aux \u2014 all right, I\u2019m coming soon ri \u2014 to the next camp.\nSo, we were march \u2014 Bergen-Belsen was a long camp. And over there there were\nwomen and children and men together. See, in Auschwitz, the \u2014 each female was\nseparately, men was separately, children were separate \u2014 children from 12 an-and\nup to 15 or something like that. Here was everything mixed in together. How did I\nknow? Because we walked \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 it was quite a walk. I don\u2019t know in\nmile how much it was, a quarter, or a half a mile or something like that. And we\ncame to a barrack, and there was a big grave dug outside. Big, you know, with the\nMay 20, 2009\nbulldozer it was dug. And then they went and opened up the door from the \u2014 from\nthe barrack. Bodies from the top to the ceiling. Women, children, men, everything,\ndead bodies. We had to drag out those bodies and throw them in that \u2014 in that \u2014 to\nthe \u2014 in the \u2014 that grave. And as soon as they opened up, the stink was so bad that, I\ndidn\u2019t have what to vomit, but I just \u2014 it came like vomiting. It was \u2014 the stink was\nso bad, it\u2019s yust \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 those bodies were rotten already there. And\nthey didn\u2019t give you no gloves, no mask, nothing with you. And a lot of times you\npulled a hand, and the hand remained in your hand. So, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\nunbelievable [indecipherable]. And what \u2014 what do you think they gave us to eat?\nBig nothing. We went back, when we came to the c \u2014 back to the original thing, to\nthe barracks, we had s \u2014 they gave us a little soup, and that\u2019s about it. And then they\nhad the nerve to come and say we need more volunteers. You know what I did? I ra\n\u2014 hide myself under \u2014 under the barracks. You know, there\u2019s a empty space, like\nthis?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I crawled in, myself with another guy. We said, oh I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not going if\nthey give me the best food on the world. Because wa \u2014 that stink was bad, and those\nbodies \u2014 I mean, the bodies didn\u2019t bother me already because you seen at the \u2014 you\nseen it all the time. So, I says no, they not gonna get me no more there. In Bergen-\nMay 20, 2009\nBelsen, we were a short time. I don\u2019t know, maybe a week? Tops, two weeks, or 10\ndays, I really do \u2014 honestly don\u2019t remember exactly how many days. From there we\nwent to Horgau, Augsburg. Augsburg was Messerschmitt, we work for the air \u2014\nby airplanes, you know, wa \u2014 in parts. Let\u2019s say they give you a part, and y \u2014 there\nwas marked here and here a couple of marks, and you had to drill those holes. Now\nhere already was a different \u2014 h-here already you were a \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in th\u2014in\nHorgau, I don\u2019t know, I think there was, for prisoners, used to be there before,\nprisoners, like soldiers, maybe British, who knows? I don\u2019t know what kind of briti\n\u2014 prisoners. At least we got \u2014 we got already \u2014 there was bunk beds, you know, and\nthey give you some food rela \u2014 but then everyday \u2014 and that\u2019s where I met my two\nfriends.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They were already there, inside. So right away I s \u2014 I came in and I was ready \u2014\nthey already knew whats was going on because instead of going to Bergen-Belsen\nthey went straight, they didn\u2019t make Bergen-Belsen, which, believe me, thanks God\nthey didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But there\u2019s \u2014 that was the worst camp. There\u2019s no way that a man could survive\nthere, never mind a year, but even months he couldn\u2019t survive that.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "Q: Did many people that you were with when you got into Bergen-Belsen go with\nyou also to Augsburg?",
        "A: Well, this barrack where I went, there, the whole barrack went there.",
        "Q: Okay, from Bergen-Belsen to Augsburg.",
        "A: From Bergen-Belsen to \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014to Horgau. Now Horgau, we \u2014 we slept there and we were \u2014 train took us\nevery day to \u2014 to Augsburg was the Messerschmitt. But what we did, 12 o\u2019clock\ntil one o\u2019clock, the guard that used to guard us inside there, they used to go for \u2014 for\nlunch. So, he was a \u2014 was a wooden wall fr-from boards, you know\u201d?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So what we did, we \u2014 in \u2014 in the other s \u2014 on the other side, let\u2019s say this was the\n\u2014 the wall.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: On this side we used to work, 1n \u2014 in this side they used to keep the parts. Raw\nparts or finish parts. On the bottom, used to pull away a \u2014 a board and used to climb\nin, and they took out the finish parts and put back the raw parts. Because we knew\nthe Germans, they were \u2014 they come back, they come back one o\u2019clock, so we knew\nthat nobody was watching us, so we could do this. So we made like a sabotage, you\nMay 20, 2009\nknow? Not to be \u2014 so instead, let\u2019s say they give you 50 parts to make those holes,\nso you put back 30 or 40 parts, and we took already made 40 - 50 parts. Because if\nyou didn\u2019t make your quota, you didn\u2019t get to eat. That was their \u2014 their motive.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, but we fool them, and it was going on \u2014 but we weren\u2019t there in Augsburg\neither, too long. So \u2014",
        "Q: They never noticed the sabotage, though?",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t know. There were so many parts there, so they didn't\nknow if I took in, or took out, or whatever I did, we made believe, we put the same\nthing wer \u2014 they put there th-the raw \u2014 the unfinished parts, we put in the same\nplace, and then we took off the \u2014 from \u2014 there was, in the thousands and thousands\nof parts that they di \u2014 they couldn\u2019t know. If they would have caught you in the\nmiddle, you would have had a big problem.",
        "Q: And you only did it when they were on their lunch break?",
        "A: On-Only in the lunch [indecipherable] but we had to work very fast. And then\nwe \u2014 we came is \u2014 so he gave you a little paper that you finish your quota, for in the\nparts, and you got a\u2014 a\u2014a meal. The \u2014 the \u2014 the meal was \u2014 was pretty good, I\nmean, co-comparing to concentration camp meal, was \u2014 was not bad.",
        "Q: What did they give you?\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: We used to get horsemeat sometimes. The horsemeat tastes very good, sweet, or\nthey gave us soup. In the soup a little horsemeat, or things like that, or sometimes\nthey give you a cheese, or \u2014 they call it Blutwurst, you know, in German. Blutwur\n\u2014 you know what wurst is? Like salami with blood mixed into it, the \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We are not allowed to have blood, you know, Jewish people, the \u2014 this is one of\nthe biggest things, that you\u2019re not supposed to have blood and \u2014 but over there,\nanything went, so \u2014",
        "Q: You had to.",
        "A: \u2014 if they were to give us dog meat, or \u2014 or rat meat, or who knows what, they \u2014\nyou had to eat it, because you didn\u2019t have anything else. You had to eat what they\ngave it to you.",
        "Q: So you pretty much gave up on the kashrut laws at that point, yeah. You had to.",
        "A: There\u2019s no such a thing. No such a thing. You couldn\u2019t do anything there. Well\nanyway, one day they decided \u2014 now I\u2019m coming already, this was already to \u2014\ntowards the end.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It must be an end \u2014 like in middle April already, something like that. We were s\n\u2014 they told us that we have to go to Dachau, because here in Augsburg we cannot\nMay 20, 2009\nstay no more, we have to go to Dachau. Dachau had a concentration camp,\nDachau had the crematorium. And, what we find out is, they di \u2014 wanted to\nannihilate all the people, and the last time that \u2014 because we knew all what was \u2014\nwas going on, and they knew that the Americans were very \u2014 coming close, because\nwe \u2014 I was liberated from Americans. Some people were liberated from Russians,\nsome people were liberated from British, but I was liberated from the Americans.\nSo, next day they give an extra portion, because they had some leftover, whatever it\nis, and we are going towards Dachau.",
        "Q: Did you have to walk, or did they put you on a train?",
        "A: Walk, walk, walk.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No more train riding. Walking. We were walking, I had my shoes, you know\nthose wooden shoes?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They call it Holland derkus(ph), you know.",
        "Q: Little clogs?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: And this rot my foot, it\u2019s unbelievable. So I took it and I throw them away, I\nsaid, I bar \u2014 I cannot walk in it, because it rot my \u2014 my foot. You know, if you have\na soft shoe, it gives. Wood doesn\u2019t give. And if it doesn\u2019t give and you walk, you\npull your foot and you scrape your foot and it get infected. So I threw them away, I\nwas walking barefoot. They didn't \u2014 they didn\u2019t care, they couldn\u2019t care less what\nyou did, already, it was, you know, they knew already this is the end, this is the end.\nSo we walked til about \u2014 we walked a whole day, and at night, maybe we \u2014 no, it\ncouldn\u2019t be that we walked half, because that\u2019s \u2014 or maybe it was two days we\nwalked, and then the last night. Because we walked to the middle \u2014 to the middle,\nand we couldn\u2019t go no more, because we seen the airplanes coming, and little\nAmerican planes, those little planes. And used to give the [indecipherable],\nbecause they were alrea \u2014 we were surrounded already with Americans, but we\ndidn\u2019t know that. But I seen the American planes, and th-that \u2014 the white star, you\nknow, and I still didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s American or not, but we knew it was a friendly\nplane. And the Germans didn\u2019t shoot at them, but they were hiding also. When the\nAmerican \u2014 the planes came, they were hiding under the ho \u2014 because they had a\ncanteen, you know, like a kitchen.",

But\nwe ve passed by, sometimes, 1-1n a field or a \u2014 find some corn or things. But hardly\nanything.

And then my\nfriend says, so maybe we should run, go over there. I says, hey, maybe that\u2019s a trap.\nMaybe the Germans are hiding there with the machine guns. They used to do those\nthings, and you start running, then they start sh \u2014 killing you, you know. So let\u2019s\nMay 20, 2009\nwait, let\u2019s wait. And we were waiting til 1t got a little bit light already. And then we\nheard the \u2014 the tanks are coming. But we didn\u2019t know what c \u2014 if 1t\u2019s German tanks\nor \u2014 or American tanks or British, we didn\u2019t know anything about it. Suddenly, you\ncould see the tanks coming towards us [indecipherable]. So one guy, it was \u2014 we\nwere liberated from black soldiers. See, in those days the blacks were separated,\nthey were not together with the white. Was a whole brigade of black soldiers.

        "Q: So you knew they were American at this point?",
        "A: Not at this point.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Th-The guy spoke German. He spoke beautiful German, this guy. And he says,\nwe are here \u2014 we are \u2014 you are liberated, and if \u2014 just stay for awhile, we get the\norder \u2014 because the planes were circling around and told them that the Germans are\nMay 20, 2009\nhere, or hiding there, or hiding there and they used to shoot and kill ger \u2014\nAmericans too yet, in \u2014 in the same time. So they were very careful, you know. So\nthey said, stay there where you staying, do not come forwards, do not come for \u2014 he\n\u2014 he repeated a couple of times, do not come forwards. So finally said, now it\u2019s\nokay, you could come. There was americ \u2014 the am-ambulances, were one or two\nmilitary ambulances, because right away, some people, they couldn\u2019t walk, they\nhave infections, you know, from the walking. As a matter of fact me too, I had a \u2014\nan infection, I went over there. And one guy, the doctor, spoke Yiddish. He was an\nAmerican Jewish guy. So he told me right away, he f\u2014 they took care of me, a-and",

I was walking barefoot. Ah, he says, don\u2019t worry about it, you have\nplenty food, we have plenty food for you prepared and don\u2019t worry about it. And\nthen \u2014 as a matter of fact, I went into a \u2014 there was a monastery, all nuns, and they\nMay 20, 2009\nused to take care on the German soldiers, you know, wounded soldiers there. I came\nin, they send me over there and they washed my foot and they treated me \u2014 they\nwere very, very nice lady, all ladies.

You see, they took care on us,\nthey gave us whate \u2014 throwing chocolate and candies and cigarettes, you know. But\nthe real stuff, later on, because the Germans had to take care, they had to feed us,\nthey had to give us rooms where to sleep. So I went for \u2014 for \u2014 I was about two days\nthere with the nuns, and they \u2014 they gave me to eat, whatever \u2014 whatever I wanted,\nand they were very nice. [coughs] Excuse me.

Like this, put on a\nmachine gun, and zzzzz, you know, killing e \u2014 it wa \u2014 for us, definitely they were\nnot afraid to do it. With the American soldiers, they knew that they had a treaty with\nthe thing, they not \u2014 were not supposed to have prisoners, you know. But for us they\ndid whatever they wanted to do. So that\u2019s where I got liberated, in mickhaus \u2014\nKleynach(ph) Mickhausen, it was the place where I got liberated. From there, 1 \u2014\nthe Jewish doctor gave me a note, he says, go to Augsburg, there\u2019s one Jewish\nsynagogue left in all Augsburg, that \u2014 to show for the world that Hitler wasn\u2019t so\nbad, he left one synagogue, he left in thik \u2014 in \u2014 in thing.

See, you were always under the\ngun, wherever you were walking, so he had a nervous breakdown and he \u2014 he was\nin very bad shape. So the Americans took him, and they took him to a \u2014 to a place\nwhere, you know, to a \u2014 to a hospital to treat him, you know. And also, from \u2014 from\n100\nMay 20, 2009\nthere, he went to Israel. And I never met him again, too.

So they hated those Germans. So \u2014 so\nnow I know how I \u2014 how you got in touch with me, because he \u2014 he told me if I\nMay 20, 2009\nwant to give a report from the concentration camp.

        "A: And they \u2014 oh, they treated us nice there. It\u2019s any time you want to come in, we\nhave \u2014 because 1n those days the officers eat separately, and the men eat \u2014 used to\neat separate. The regular army used to be separate. So we always were, we came,\nwe went there, because he gave us the okay to come and eat with them. So they \u2014\nwe were treated \u2014 y-you couldn\u2019t get better treatment than that. So we were very\nnice. And then the \u2014 so Captain William \u2014 William Fuch \u2014 Wil-William said okay,\n105May 20, 2009\ngo to the Burgermeister. Burgermeister is the mayor.

And in\ncase he doesn\u2019t want it, he ha \u2014 he knew already that we wouldn\u2019t get it, just come\nback and let me know, because from \u2014 from the mayor to the airfield was 50\nminutes walk, something like that. So we came in, yeah, what can I do for you, he\nsays in ger \u2014 we talking in German to him. Says well, we need a room. Ich habe\nkeiner, I have no rooms for you. Okay. I says \u2014 dav \u2014 David, my friend says, it\u2019s no\nuse to argue with him. Let\u2019s go back to well \u2014 tell him \u2014 to William. So we came\nback, he went and put two guns on his \u2014 an-and with two guns he came in. As soon\nas he seen him, and the Germans, you know, right away he stands in the \u2014 in thing.\nHe says, I want you should give those guys a room.

Said okay, that\u2019s good for them. Give \u2014 give them that\nroom. So the well was \u2014 the captain was sleeping in one side, on the other side of\nthe house, and we \u2014 we had the room for ourself 1-in this side of the house. So we\nwere treated there wonderful, very nice. Very nice, I\u2014 so, when I came to America,\nhe came to see me, because I was working in New York in the garment center that\ntime. He took me out for lunch, he gave me 50 dollars.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Fifty dollars was a lot of money.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And then, he invited us to a hou \u2014 to his house in Brooklyn, but he \u2014\nAndrew wasn\u2019t \u2014 was \u2014 wasn\u2019t born yet, because he has two b \u2014 two boys. The\nolder one \u2014 what was the older one\u2019s name? Okay, I have it so \u2014 when we came\nthere he was a baby, a little baby yet. So, he said \u2014",

        "Q: What year was this in?",
        "A: This is in 1950.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: 1950 when I came to America. So anyway, we came to visit and then \u2014 and we\nhad \u2014 th-they invited us for \u2014 for supper or lun \u2014 whatever it is. And then he says to\nus, We are going \u2014 we are going to \u2014 to Switzerland. Because in those days was the\nG.I. quote, you know. The G.I., whoever wanted to star \u2014 to \u2014 to study for higher \u2014\nbecause he was a high school teacher, he wanted to go higher. In the \u2014 the americ \u2014\nthe \u2014 the government paid f\u2014 the G.I. Bill was that time, they called it G.I. Bill, and\nthe government paid for everything. For study, for \u2014 they gave him money, gave\nhim everything, and they send him to Switzerland, to study in Switzerland. So he\nsaid, come next week, and then I'll \u2014 I'll tell you everything exactly what it was.\nWhen we came next week, he was already gone, because they somehow \u2014 they told\nhim \u2014 they \u2014 for \u2014 a couple of days later that they \u2014 he\u2019s gonna have to come, you\nknow, because they were prepared, already packed and everything, but somehow\nthey called him up and he said, you have to leave before. So we were there \u2014 we\ncame there on a Saturday, and he left already on Thursday. So I came there, I knock\nin the door, nobody answers the door, so I go next door. It was an elderly lady\nliving there in \u2014 in \u2014 in the \u2014 in the house. So I says, do you know where the Fuchs\n108\nMay 20, 2009\nare? Dillon Fuch? Oh, they left already. They \u2014 sh-she knew already that they left,\nthey left on Thursday. So, since then we got lost, and I \u2014 and I went \u2014 you know ma\n\u2014 I had another friend who was in the army, that I met, he tried to locate him,\nbecause I knew where he \u2014 nobody knew, nobody, how to get in touch with him,\nand I couldn\u2019t get in touch with him. So, when I moved here down to \u2014 in Coral\nSpring, when I went in the synagogue, there was one guy \u2014 I somehow came out to\ntalk, you know, about my \u2014 my friend, I said, I\u2014 I had a friend, Captain William\nFuchs, you know, and I \u2014 we tried to \u2014 he says, I could find that out for you. He\nsays, give me a couple of days.",

Cause I was here about a week or two, I\nalready started to work. Because the HIAS supported me, gave me certain amount\nof money, and they paid me for a room. And so I was already, you know. But I\ndidn\u2019t want they should support me, I wanted to make my own money, you know, I\nwanted to work.",

And they had fun in the back, they were laughing, you know\u201d? I le \u2014 ha \u2014 I\nheard them something, but I didn\u2019t know what was going on there. So the guy says,\nokay, let me see how you do \u2014 do some sewing. So he gives me a thimble, I didn't\nknow where or on what finger to put on even the thimble, never mind to sew. And\nthey were laughing. He said, all right, we had the little fun with you, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t\nworry about it. You gonna learn \u2014 you gonna learn, don\u2019t worry about it. Be \u2014 I\nknow all about it, what kind of tailor d \u2014 you a-a-are. So I says, yeah, Teddy \u2014 his\n118\nMay 20, 2009\nname was Teddy, the guy who \u2014 who told me I should be \u2014 just tell them that I am\na tailor. But, I worked there for a couple of weeks, and believe me, I produced just\nlike anybody else, I learned very fast.",

        "Q: So that\u2019s what you eventually went up and \u2014 and did there?",
        "A: Yeah, and that\u2019s how I learned \u2014 I learned a lot of things to sew in the \u2014 1n the\nfactory when I used to work, but I worked there for about \u2014 I worked in two\nfactories. One in the beginning factory, and then I left because I got into an\nargument with the \u2014 with this Teddy, because he thought that because he gave me a\njob that he could \u2014 I could lie for him, and I could do all kind of things, which \u2014\nthere was an old lady, also a Holocaust survivor, and he wanted to get rid of her. So\nhe took me as a witness to the big boss there. So, I see he was talking and he\npointing towards me, because they were there \u2014 over there and I see that he points\ntowards me. Finally he comes over with the boss, and the boss was, you know, big\ncigars, you know, all sunburned because he went to Florida for the \u2014 it was in the\n119May 20, 2009\nwintertime. So he says to me, if \u2014 1f I speak Yiddish. I says, I \u2014 I don\u2019t speak no\nEnglish, but I speak Yiddish. So he started to talk to me and then Teddy says, and\nask Saul, he\u2019ll tell you that she doesn\u2019t want to work. I said, hold it, hold it, hold it.\nI \u2014 in front of the boss, I said, that\u2019s not true. I says, she\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s an elderly lady.\nShe was about 45, something like that, but she looked like a hundred. Skinny\n[indecipherable] broken, sick. I says, she tries her best, I says, and she wants to\nwork and she does work. And the boss just looked at him like, you know, when he \u2014\nwhen the boss left, he comes over to me and says, I'll tell you one thing Saul, as\nlong as you gonna work here, you never gonna get a raise, an increase. I says, look,\nI don\u2019t care about your increase and I don\u2019t care about your raise. You think I\u2019m\ngonna squeal on a woman like this? I mean, because you gave me a job, you think\nyou own me? I says, I don\u2019t care, no matter what \u2014 you want me to leave, you could\nthrow me out. I \u2014 I'll leave. I don\u2019t even want to \u2014 I don\u2019t like to say \u2014 and I don\u2019t\nlike you at all when you do the \u2014 you should be ashamed of yourself, I says, you\nwent through a concentration camp, and yo \u2014 that\u2019s how you behave to an old lady\nlike that? She looks old, but she\u2019s 45 something, she\u2019s still a young woman, and\nlook what you want to do to her.",
        "Q: So the boss was a survivor also?",
        "A: The \u2014 the bo \u2014 no, the boss went away.\n120May 20, 2009",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He came over to me, and talked to me like this. But anyway, so I worked \u2014 I \u2014 I\nremember I made 75 cents an hour in those days. I made 75 cents, but one day I go\nover th-the boss\u2019s son-in-law, his name was Howard. I says, I\u2019m gonna go and ask\na raise. I wanted a raise of five dollars. So I go over to the boss \u2014 yeah, and I used to\nmake already better garments, you know, and duplicates, you know, samples. And\nthey had to rush them out, sometimes I had to go for lunch, and he says, Saul, can\u2019t\n\u2014 you can\u2019t go because we have to rush out this things because otherwise we\nwouldn\u2019t get the order.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

So I go over to him and I\nsays, listen Howard, I would like to ask you for a raise, for five dollars. I\u2019m sorry\nSaul, I can\u2019t give it to you. That\u2019s was Teddy\u2019s work, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I says to him, okay, [Il tell you what, you don\u2019t want to give you a raise,\nthat\u2019s fine. Instead of, put me on \u2014 put me on work \u2014 on piecework like the other\n121May 20, 2009\nguys work. If Pll make hundred dollars or \u2019'Il make 10 dollars, whatever I\u2019Il make,\nwhatever I produce. I knew that I could make much more than 75 cents an hour.

So I\u2019m going down, suddenly, who do you\nthink I meet? I meet a guy from Germany that \u2014 way back from Germany I used to\nknow from the ca \u2014 from the camp, from the concentration camp. Saul! I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it. I went to eat, and he came into the building. He didn't work there, but he\njust happened to pass by. H-He almost cried, and I was crying almost.

Wha \u2014 how \u2014 I says Joe, his name was Joe, in\nJewish his name was Yittel(ph), I says, I have such a strong headache, I hardly\ncould see out of my eyes. So I told him the story, he says, Saul, I have good news\nfor you.

And that\u2019s all you\u2019re\ngonna do. So I had plenty chance to work myself into it, you know? I was very\ngood, this was \u2014 I was \u2014 there was a hard job. It wasn\u2019t so hard, but 1t was a \u2014 how\nshall I say, it was a job, a boarding job. He had crisscross because everything was\nhandmade, so you couldn\u2019t fold it under, you had to flat \u2014 the suit should \u2014 1t was li\n\u2014 you Ss \u2014 wear a Suit like a sweater. It was giving from all the sides. Had no\npaddings, no nothing. That\u2019s why it was so expensive.

He came an hour\nlater, so what, so he came an hour later. Still. So they tried the same way, but it\n124\nMay 20, 2009\ndidn\u2019t work with them, so it\u2019s also fall apart. With me, til the last moment I work\nthere, I worked with my friend, we made good money. I mean, there was times I\nwent home with 200 dollars, in those days it was a fortune of money. Like today a\nthousand dollars almost, for 200 dollars, you sh \u2014 yeah, right.",
        "Q: In just a week? In just a week?",

I went, there was a \u2014\na school from dry cleaning business. And I was already a licensed dry cleaning\nbusiness, so my cousin didn't know, so I was doing the spotting, and all those\nthings. But my cousin was a presser, because he worked also in the garment center.\nSo \u2014 and I did alterations, we had a \u2014 a tailor also. And my cousin sometimes \u2014 we\n\u2014 the pressers was very bad there, because they were not reliable, they used to come\nin drunk, or they didn't show up, and they\u2019re supposed to be \u2014 let\u2019s say I opened up\nseven o\u2019clock, they\u2019re supposed to be eight o\u2019clock in the \u2014 in the store, they used\nto come in two o\u2019clock, three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I says, why are you coming\n126May 20, 2009\nso late? Oh, you don\u2019t like me? Pay me out. I said, pay me out with what? I don\u2019t\nowe you anything, I paid you \u2014 Saturday I paid you everything to a penny. The guy\ndidn\u2019t have 10 cents to go home with the subway. And ca \u2014 a lot of times they came\nin drunk. I says, no, you cannot work drunk. And one day I was very busy by the\ncounter, a-and my cousin went out to eat lunch \u2014 breakfast, I mean, in the morning,\nand I didn\u2019t see the presser came in, and went straight \u2014 I was so busy in the front\nwith the customers, I didn\u2019t even see when he came in. And he was quite overdosed\nwith \u2014 he drank \u2014 early in the morning already, he was drunk. Suddenly, I hear like\nan explosion. He pulled the pressing machine out from the place, and he busted the\npipe, and the ste \u2014 I thought that like \u2014 like a bomb exploded. He pulled the pressing\nmachine from the wall out. He ma \u2014 he was a very \u2014 we used to call him Herman\nthe bull, he was such a \u2014 he was a big guy, you know, very strong guy. But he\ndidn\u2019t know what he was doing. I said, didn\u2019t I tell you not to come in drinking? I \u2014\nI says, you came in, I didn\u2019t even see you coming in. So I went, Is \u2014 I gave him a\ndollar, I says, go buy yourself black coffee, and sit dow \u2014 he was a very nice guy.\nOne thing he was nice, but when he was drunk, forget it. He didn\u2019t know what he\nwas doing. And so I said, drink some coffee first, lay down. When you gonna feel\nyou gonna be all right \u2014 I called in right away, because I had insurance. They came\nright away, they fixed everything up.\nMay 20, 2009",

        "A: It was wa \u2014 I paid for a whole year of \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that insura \u2014 that insurance was a\nblessing from \u2014 from heaven. The \u2014 I remember the first year was pipes busted. The\nfirst year that 1t was in business, I didn't know that pipes were busting from the\nwater line, and shoot up. And suddenly, we put on the steam, and suddenly it starts\nshooting out the steam all over. And you couldn\u2019t get a plumber there like an\nemergenc \u2014 like a doctor was \u2014 in emergency you couldn\u2019t get a plumber. But I\ncalled them up. About in a half an hour they were there and they fixed me up back\nin business. A lot of cleaners, they couldn\u2019t do anything.

        "A: Those army tru \u2014 big trucks, and they were covered up with the \u2014 with covers,\nyou know. You see, in those days, Britain was against to let in Jews to Israel, but\nthey let in Arabs. They had a quota. They \u2014 1500 Jews were allowed to go in in a\nmonth. But the Arabs, if 100,000 wanted to go in \u2014 because you see, they had a\nproblem in those days, the Arabs, they didn\u2019t have no work, and the only thing\nIsrael was blo \u2014 blossoming, blooming, because the Jews started to return, because,\nI don\u2019t know, you must read \u2014 1f you are a Christian, you must read the Bible, the\nold test \u2014 you read the Old Testament ever?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\n141May 20, 2009",

So,\nwhen I was reading this Bible, you know, I \u2014 I believe in the Bible, beca \u2014 in the \u2014\nin the five co \u2014 1n the five books of Moses. And you have the New Testament, we\nhave the Old Testament. So I said, that\u2019s the reason I want to se \u2014 I said, I am going\nto Israel. But, i-in those days, so the British were against the \u2014 because they wanted\nthe Arabs, they favored the Arabs. Now, the Jews, if they smuggled in weapons or\nsomething, they went \u2014 used to go in the kibbutzim, and confiscate the Jewish\nweapons and sell them to the Arabs or something like this. But then it came a time\nthat the Jews got a little bit stronger, and they started to fight back the British. I\ndon\u2019t know if you remember it when they bombed the King David hotel, 1t was the\n\u2014 the British headquarters in Jerusalem, and a lot of British soldiers died. And they\n142May 20, 2009\nstarted to suffer. You know, first they \u2014 they killed Jews and things, but then the\nJews hit back, and they \u2014 they got the beating, too. So then they decided they had\nenough, they \u2014 too much losses and they said they giving up. But before they giving\nup, they thought that the \u2014 they confiscated weapons from the Jews and gave them\nto the Arabs, and they took away the weapons from the Jews, but the Jews got weap\n\u2014 different \u2014 from different places they got weapons. And they were hundred\npercent sure that the Jewish people, who in those days, I don\u2019t know, a million and\n\u2014 tops a million and a half or something like that, and the Arabs were in the hundred\nmillions. There was Egypt, there was Lebanon, Syrian, Jordan. Jordan had a well\nequipped army with tanks and things. What the Jews, they had a couple of rifles,\nand things like that. So anyway, the Jews didn\u2019t have no choice, but they went in le\n\u2014 illegally, on boats, you know, they came in. This ship, Exodus \u2014 come, Ill show\nyou something, here.",
        "Q: Okay. Here we go. Let me take the mic from this.",
        "A: Oh, okay. I have to sit, and \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 [Il show you the picture afterward.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: We can pause and get the picture.",
        "A: Yeah, Pll \u2014 Pll show you \u2014 I\u2019Il show everything.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So anyway \u2014 so they \u2014 they thought now, as soon as the British are gonna leave,\nthe Arabs will attack. And that\u2019s what they did, really. They knew ahead of times,\nand they gonna wipe out the Jewish people one, two, three. But, you know, when\nGod promises something, and he watches over you, you could have a billion army,\nand you have hundred people, and who \u2014 who goes out the \u2014 the winner is what\nGod wants, right? And then, the British left, and the U.N. wa \u2014 said they should\ndivide Israel half. Half Jerusalem for the Arabs, and have half Israel for the\nArabs. Half Israel, half Arabs.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But the Arabs didn\u2019t want half, they wanted everything, the whole thing. And the\nJews weren\u2019t ready to give them. Now here, Israel has nothing, comparing with the\nArab side. Jordan had a regular army trained by the British, with tanks, with\nairplanes, with all thing, what did the Jew have? Nothing. Couple of tanks or\nmachine guns. But the Czechoslovakian sent help out for the \u2014 for Israel\n[indecipherable] Russia in those days helped. America was \u2014 stayed away. Didn\u2019t\ndo anything for the \u2014 at that time, in the beginning. But, as soon as the British left\n144\nMay 20, 2009\nand the u\u2014 unite [clears throat] Excuse me. The United Nations declared Israel as\na State, the Arabs didn\u2019t want to agree on anything, and as soon as Israel declared a\nstate, that was \u2014 the first premier was dur \u2014 Beng-Ben-Gurion.",
        "Q: You weren't in Israel at that point though?",
        "A: No, no, I wasn\u2019t in 1\u2014I came to Israel, but I was caught by the \u2014 let me \u2014 let me\njust continue \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and then [Il come back \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 with the thing. So anyway, the bri \u2014 the \u2014 the United Nations, they voted in\nIsrael as half \u2014 half \u2014 we\u2019ll divide it half and half, but Arabs didn\u2019t agree on that.\nThey wanted everything, and as soon as they gathered the army from Egypt, they\ngathered the army from \u2014 from Jordan, Syria helped out, Saudi Arabia,\neverybody against little Israel. But what happened? Israel, the \u2014 the b \u2014 st \u2014 yeah \u2014\nEgypt, with Egypt, it started first with Egypt. Egypt said that from now on the\nJews cannot use the Red Sea, they block \u2014 put a blockade against Israeli shipping,\nbecause Israel had already a couple of ships that used to come, as you know,\ncommercial ships. So since isra \u2014 since Egypt came out with that tank that \u2014 in\nother words, they stopped the select \u2014 you have a job, and they take away from you\n145May 20, 2009\na job, you cannot co \u2014 you cannot \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t let you live. So didn\u2019t have only\none thing. They went and instead of Egypt attacking Israel, Israel attacked Egypt.\nAnd they had already a couple of American Jewish pilots that they used to be in the\nsecond World War, went to help Israel. And they got a \u2014 a couple of planes, and\nEgypt had the big air force already, but Israel attacked first and wiped out the\nwhole Egyptian Air Force. That was the main thing what they did, number one. And\nonce they divide \u2014 they \u2014 they got the air force finished, and Egypt got stuck in the\nmiddle, where everything was going in the Sinai, in the desert, because they were\nstarting to march, but it was too late already for them. And then the tan \u2014 tanks\ncame, and Israel wiped out the whole tanks, and surrounded Egypt and Egypt had\nsuch a defeat that they just hardly made it alive.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: When Jordan seen what Israel did to Egypt, they started coming down from \u2014\nfrom the it \u2014 what do you call that?",
        "Q: The \u2014",
        "A: The Golan Heights \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 the Golan Heights. See, the Golan Heights \u2014 have you ever been in Israel?",
        "Q: I haven\u2019t, but I know the geography.\n146May 20, 2009",
        "A: You know the geography.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay. See, the Golan Heights goes up like this in the mountain, and then when\nyou come all the way on top is \u2014 is Syria. From there you could just walk in straight\nto Syria.",
        "Q: So they came in through there.",
        "A: Right. But see, Jordan \u2014 Syrian, they used to bomb because they used to live by\nthe [indecipherable] it\u2019s like a swamp, you know, where you step in the ground\nyou could sink in til about here, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s soft land, they call it the\nsump(ph).",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: This \u2014 th \u2014 it\u2019s more water than thing and it\u2019s \u2014 you cannot walk there, you\nknow. So they used \u2014 an-and people, the Israelis used to already dry out the\nsumps(ph) and to \u2014 to grow wheat or corn, whatever it is. And the Syrians from the\ntop, when they used to \u2014 because they had the Heights. So they used to shoot down\nwith cannons and things and used to kill a lot of Israelis. Now they said oh, Israel\nattacked Egypt, now we gonna attack Israel. And they came down with the\nmountains with the tanks. But, going up on the tanks, when th \u2014 Israel was ready\nalso with tanks they had already, because they got shipment. France helped Israel a\n147May 20, 2009\nlot, Russians, Czechoslovakian. So they had already more weapons, and they caught\na lot of Egyptian weapons. That\u2019s where they made. And also, they called those\nrockets, the rockets, you know, where they \u2014 to shoot up, and wit \u2014 that was the\nVietnam war, I think it was that. But France somehow, I don\u2019t know, something\nwent wrong between France and Israel, and France stopped delivering \u2014 no more\nweapons, but Israel bought from them some boats, speedboats, and they \u2014 Israel\npaid for them, but she couldn\u2019t deliver them yet, she said the \u2014 an \u2014 they had a date\nwhen to pick them up. And France said \u2014 wouldn\u2019t give back the money to Israel\nand wouldn\u2019t give back the boats for Israel. So Israel, at night, from i \u2014 from\nFrance to Israel is not very far. So they had also boats, and they came at night and\nthey kipnapped \u2014 kipnap \u2014 kidnapped all those boats out. It was \u2014 belonged to them.\nSo says, we paid for it, but the \u2014 France didn't want to give them out. For what re \u2014\nI don\u2019t remember the reason exactly why. So anyway, they took out the boats and\nthat\u2019s how France stopped giving them no more \u2014 no \u2014 because they used to sa \u2014\nsell them Mirage, the jets. The French mira \u2014 like you have here the \u2014 the\nAmericans have the-their jets, what do you call the American jets? The Phantoms?\nPhantom jets.",
        "Q: Phantoms, okay.\n148May 20, 2009",
        "A: So over there the \u2014 the brit \u2014 the \u2014 France they had the Mirages, and it was a\ngood plane. In those days if \u2014 a Mirage used to be a million dollars. So, anyway,\nwhen Syria said now we gonna teach those Jews a lesson, and they planted mines\nall the way \u2014 in other words they knew that the \u2014 Israel has the tanks that they co-\ncould come up, and they planted \u2014 there was a lot of sand there. And then it was a\nmir \u2014 another miracle happened that that night \u2014 they didn\u2019t know that \u2014 the knew\nthat there was \u2014 but they didn\u2019t know exactly where the \u2014 the mines are, and they\nwent into one place, they were surrounded by the mine fields, and it was very\ndangerous for them to continue. They didn\u2019t know what to do. Suddenly, a\u2014a-\u2014a\nsandstorm came, and blow out all the sand, and you could see the mines, they could\nsee where the mines are laying. All they went, the soldiers, they knew how to\nhandle those things. They picked up the mines, and then they went up, and they \u2014\nthen come the big battle, it was a fierce battle, cause the Syrians, they have very\nwell prepared and fortified, because they were on the top, and the Jews were on the\n\u2014 on the bottom. So you know when you are on top what you could do when \u2014 go\nup \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s much easier.",
        "A: But finally, a b \u2014 very bad fight [indecipherable] fight, and the Jews gained that,\nand they went all the way up, they almost went into Syria, but they stopped just in\n149May 20, 2009\nfront of Damascus. They could have gone inside, but America told them to stop,\nnot to go in and they stopped. So then \u2014 so then they \u2014 they annihilated th-the whole\nbrit \u2014 the whole Egyptian army, the whole Syrian army, and Lebanese armies. So\none little \u2014 couple of people against \u2014 against millions. So here, used to say it was a\nmiracle, because God told you that the Jewish people will return. Now, you see,\nthey still did not return completely, because this is not the turning place, you see,\nnow they still want \u2014 they still want half of \u2014 of Israel now. Even they lost\neverything and they start with the fight. Israel wanted to give them everything half.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Like the U.N \u2014 nited Nations, but the United States was crooked too, so \u2014 so\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the story 1s now \u2014 you \u2014 you seen Netanyahu was here. And I don\u2019t\nknow what happened, what they \u2014 what they arranged something, I really don\u2019t\nknow anything about it.

There\u2019s a reason they give you \u2014 see, this is B10140\nis my tattoo number. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s all you \u2014",

        "A: All of them, women, children and men. Now, what had caused that? I never find\nout. But that\u2019s what happened in Auschwitz, and that\u2019s what happened in our\nbarrack. So, they made a mistake, first they came to us, and then they got an order\nthey got in the wrong place.

So the honeymoon\nended that time when Germany and ho \u2014 Horthy \u2014 Horthy Mikl6\u00e9s was the \u2014 like\nthe president here, he was that time th-the \u2014 he was the \u2014 li-like the \u2014 the president \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of Hungarian. His name was Horthy Mikl\u00e9s. He was very friendly to the\nJewish people, but he didn\u2019t have no choice because there was a lot of Hungarians,\nthey \u2014 they were also sympathizers with the \u2014 with the Nazis, with the \u2014 with the\nGermans. So he didn\u2019t have no choice and he had to do what they \u2014 they told him to\ndo, but the reality, he didn\u2019t have no power, had no \u2014 nothing to say there.",
        "A: In that time when \u2014 when they made a pact with Germany.",
        "A: Well, in the school \u2014 I was born in Munkacs and I went in the first and second \u2014\nsecond grade, I went in Munkacs. Then we moved to Kwassie(ph). Kwassie(ph) is\nin the Carpathian mountains. And the \u2014 it all depends what kind of teacher you\nhad. If you had a nice teacher, they were very nice, and some of them were special.\nI had the Ukraine teacher by the name of Kohut(ph). He was unbelievable, he\nhated the Jews. Every time \u2014 he was a substitute teacher [indecipherable]. So my\nteacher, she was a Hungarian teacher. And she was very nice, absolutely, she\nhandled the people, not only Jewish people, she handled the people because there\nwas Ukraine kids, Ru-Russian kids, you know, Hungarian speaking kids, she\nhandled everybody one way tha \u2014 with love, I could say.",
        "A: This is public school, right. Now, this teacher, when he came in, he \u2014 w-we had\nto stand in two lines and we had to go over to him and he \u2014 we had to show \u2014 put\nmy hand on his hands, and he checked if you have dir \u2014 cut nails or dirty nails. So\nwhen I came he looked at my ne \u2014 of my nails, and my nail were a hundred percent\nclean. But his \u2014 his \u2014 his hands were this \u2014 this thick black, he was a drunk. So he\nsays, okay next. Ge \u2014 next dirty Jew. He called us dirty Jew.",
        "A: In front of everybody. I cou \u2014 you couldn\u2019t say anything because in those days\nyou couldn\u2019t start up with teachers, you know.",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 we went to one class.",
        "A: This wasn\u2019t only \u2014 it was a couple of Jews there, we were the minority there, you\nsee.",
        "A: Yeah, mostly Christians, right. And \u2014 and-and couple of \u2014 and Jewish kids\nmixed in. We never had any problem with the \u2014 in the school, but all depends on\nwith these teachers. Or sometimes \u2014 I\u2019 I] tell you another story. When I was already\nin a higher grade, that was already when I was in \u2014 1n the fifth grade, I think. So I\nhad a\u2014a-\u2014a teacher by the name of Skoba(ph) Laslo(ph), a very nice man. So, wh-\nwhen you were old, I think by t\u2014 11 \u2014 11 or 10 years old you had to, like here \u2014 like\nthe \u2014 the Germans had the Hitlerjugend, the \u2014 the kids when they had \u2014 they \u2014 they\ntrained them for \u2014 for army and things, and singing and marching. The Jewish\npeople \u2014 the Jewish kids, they took us and we had to clean the toilets, we had to do\nall those low class things. And instead of they \u2014 they had the make believe gun, they\ngive us shovel, so \u2014 but wh-who cared, you know, as long \u2014 we did what we had to\nMay 20, 2009\ndo and you cou \u2014 we didn\u2019t have no choice. So one day my teacher told me I should\ndo something for him, I had to go to the post office or something. He says, okay,\nthis \u2014 for this, because you took care what I told you, you don\u2019t have to go four\ntimes to the \u2014 they call it the leventher(ph). So I said thank you very much, and I\nwas off, because every week, once a week you had to go there, to the thing. So\nwhen they see that I was missing, they came, two guys, grown up, they were maybe\n18 years old already, but with guns, you know, how come you didn\u2019t go to the \u2014\nhow come you didn\u2019t come to the leven \u2014 I says, I have off for four weeks. He was\nthe main guy, this Skoba(ph), teacher, he was the main guy from the leventher(ph).",
        "A: So I said, Skoba(ph) gave me off four weeks. We don\u2019t care, he says, we have\nan order, you have to come. And my mother wasn\u2019t home, so I \u2014 they have to come,\nI went with them. And was snowing that if I \u2014 he was sitting as far from me, you\ncouldn\u2019t see my face, that\u2019s how strong it was snowing, it was wintertime.",
        "A: Yeah. So he s \u2014 and I came over there. The other one was a \u2014 the \u2014 a ver \u2014 also a\nbig Jew hater, was named Cossack, like the Cossacks, you know? Was also\nUkraine guy. He was the number two man, but Skoba(ph) was the higher \u2014 higher\nMay 20, 2009\nman. So he says \u2014 first of all he gave me a shovel, and I have to hold on with the\nshovel like this, and standing like this, so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. So, I was standing there. From far away I see somebody\u2019s coming with a\nbicycle, because you couldn\u2019t see, because it was so heavy the snow. When you\ncome closer ca \u2014 I says, this must be Skoba(ph). He came close to \u2014 closer and\ncloser, he says, what are you doing here? Didn\u2019t I gave you off four weeks? So I\ntold him. He says, throw down the shovel, you go home. I'll take care on the rest,\nright. And he had the big fight with them, and he says, when I tell \u2014 when I gave\nhim off, that means he is off. You have no right. Next time he behaved. He put him\nin his place, cause he was the head guy. So as I said, there was some of them very\nnice, and some of them, you know, Nazi sympathizers.",
        "A: They were the worst.",
        "A: That \u2014 that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that is correct. And that \u2014 even the concentration camp. The\nworst, they were e \u2014 th-those \u2014 they called themselves the [indecipherable] that\nthey wanted to \u2014 to become for Germany one, you know, they were the worst.\nLike, Ukraines, Lithuanians \u2014 Ukraines, Lithuanians and Romanians, they were the\nMay 20, 2009\nworst. They did killings like \u2014 like you step on a cockroach, that\u2019s what they used to\ndo. But you gonna hear the stories later on, when I was in the concentration camp,\nwhat had happened and what was going on.",
        "A: Yes, I had two \u2014 two more bro \u2014 we were three kids.",
        "A: Two more brothers, young \u2014 each year \u2014 I was born 1929 - 1930 and \u201831.",
        "A: Each year. There was one \u2014 one ahead \u2014 before me, but didn\u2019t make it, so \u2014 you\nknow, in those days it wasn\u2019t advanced, the medicines like today, you know,\nespecially in America. [phone ringing]",
        "A: Yeah, okay. [tape break]",
        "A: Okay. My mother and father \u2014 my mother was born in 1901, and my father was\nborn in 1901, in same \u2014 1n same thing. My father lived in \u2014 in Kwassie(ph), the \u2014\nand my mother comes from Munkacs.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: It\u2019s about a hund \u2014 hundred kilomet \u2014 kilometers in distance. So my mother\nalways want to become a doctor, and in those days she went in university and she\nwanted to become a doctor.",
        "A: But something happened. They had a big business, and it was selling materials\nfor ladies, for mans [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s family. So, my grandfather in those days, cut his toenails, and cut\nmaybe a little bit too deep, and got an infection. Now today you give a shot of\npenicillin, or anything, and it\u2019s taken care. In those days, didn't have no penicillin\nnor antibiotics. And my grandmother used to s-scream at him, why don\u2019t you go to\nthe \u2014 see the doctor? Oh, this \u2014 you know, he was a big guy, strong guy. Oh, I don\u2019t\nneed it, don\u2019t worry about it, nothing\u2019s going to happen to me. Well, 1t did happen.\nFinally gangrene went in and they had to amputate his leg, and not | \u2014 after that, a\ncouple of \u2014 a very short time he died, he passed away.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: So now, my mother made already three \u2014 in those days you had to go four years\nto university to become a doctor, she had already thre \u2014 three years finished, so \u2014\nand my grandma didn\u2019t know how to read, how to write, and she took over the\nbusiness, and they ha \u2014 they had 14 children, but most of them were already\nmarried, and a couple of them were still home. So, my \u2014 my grandma, she didn\u2019t\nknow how to order, she didn\u2019t know how to do things. She knew how to sell, but\nshe didn\u2019t help out in the business either because she \u2014 she did the cooking. And my\ngrandfather had somebody who helped him out, and that\u2019s all, they managed very\ngood. So wh-when it came to a point that sh \u2014 th-they \u2014 she couldn\u2019t pay the bills,\nbecause didn\u2019t have \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t give her no more st \u2014 materials to sell, because\nshe couldn\u2019t pay. So it came to a point that she turned to my mother and says, listen\n\u2014my mother\u2019s name was Ren\u00e9 \u2014 listen, Ren\u00e9, you have to stop schooling. You\nhave to take over the business, because you know me, I didn\u2019t go to school, I don\u2019t\nknow how to handle a business. And because if you\u2019re not going to take over we all\ngonna die. Because in those days there was no welfare. If you had the money you\nate, if you didn\u2019t have the money to eat, you didn\u2019t eat, unless somebody maybe\nhelped you out once in awhile, but they couldn\u2019t do it every day because a lot of\nthem didn\u2019t have money also, to help you out. So in that time my mother \u2014 my \u2014\n[phone ringing]\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: That\u2019s right. [tape break]",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: So anyway, my mother took it over, and as soon as the salesman heard that my\nmother took over the store, they all c-came to run, you know, Mrs. Ren\u00e9, just, if\nyou need something, we are all here to help you and don\u2019t worry about it, and they\nknew that my mother is \u2014 knows how to do things that \u2014 they knew it. So my\nmother took over, and my aunt, the youngest sister, she was in Israel and I went to\nsee her, so she told me the story. She said that my mother built up in a \u2014 in a couple\nof months, she made so much money that they couldn\u2019t close the drawer, because in\ntho \u2014 in those days they didn\u2019t have registers, you know. Everything was in a big\ndrawer and you just laid down nicely the \u2014 each denomination, you know,\nseparately. And th-the first thing she did, she paid off all the \u2014 whatever my\ngrandma lost, paid everything, paid them back and she made a lot of money, in\nthose days. So that was my mother. My father, my father was in Kwassie(ph). My \u2014\nmy father\u2019s mother, they owned the mineral bathe \u2014 bathe, you know, there was a\nlot of minerals there, and all over from Europe used to come to bathe there,\nMay 20, 2009\nespecially in the summertime, y-you couldn\u2019t find a room, e-even the stables were\nrented. That\u2019s how many people used to come in in the summertime. In the\nwintertime was a \u2014 a ski resort. So, that\u2019s more or less my \u2014 about my parents.",
        "A: That, I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t around at that time, but anyway, I really don\u2019t know because you see, in\nthose \u2014 in those days used to be matchmakers. So let\u2019s say they knew your parents,\nthey went over there, say oh, I have a very nice little daughter or something, ye \u2014\nyou have a nice boy, and you know, they used to go around and \u2014 and match up\npeople, and they used to get paid for that. That was their business, they called\nthemself matchmakers.",
        "A: You heard about that?",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] the same thing here. So exactly how and what I cannot\ntell you because I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, no, my mother moved t-to \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 because when she got \u2014 in those days you also had \u2014 you got \u2014 a\u2014a girl used\nto get dowries.",
        "A: So, sh \u2014 they got a big dowry and they settled down there in the \u2014 in \u2014 in\nKwassie(ph), in the thing.",
        "A: So my father, his main business used to be \u2014 they used to buy, let\u2019s say in the\nmountain, there\u2019s \u2014 were a lot of wood there, so used to buy, let\u2019s say, a whole \u2014\nand a couple of acres of land, and whatever th \u2014 woods were on that land, they used\nto cut them off in th \u2014 in the wint \u2014 in the summertime. In the wintertime they used\nto bring them down with sleds, all the way to the station, and he used to deliver all\nover t \u2014 all over Europe he used to sell those things. So he was in the \u2014 1n the wood\nbusiness, 1n wholesale wood business.",
        "A: Yes, I was \u2014I-\u2014",
        "A: Y-Yes, yeah. But then, what happened \u2014 now I\u2019m gonna comment and \u2014 and go\non what had happened. See, in those days they took all \u2014 one day my father\nMay 20, 2009\ndelivered already all the wood to the station and they were ready to deliver, put in\nthe wagons. Suddenly it came that they called him in as a \u2014 what do you call that?\nEnforced labor.",
        "A: In other words, he wasn\u2019t as a soldier, they \u2014 let\u2019s say, they were a Jewish\nbattalion. They used to send them to th \u2014 to the front to pick mines or things like\nthat. They didn\u2019t train them how to do \u2014 pick mines, and if you did the wrong thing,\ni-1t \u2014 1t blew up and that was the end of it. So a lot of Jewish people got killed that\nway.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: What year? It was 1942 - \u201843.",
        "A: So \u2014a-and that\u2019s what happened \u2014 what \u2014 what happened, the big thing that\nwhen they called them in, all the wood was there, and nobody e \u2014 e \u2014 my mother\ndidn\u2019t know exactly wha \u2014 where to \u2014 you know, it came so suddenly \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 because over there they didn\u2019t ask no questions. When you got that \u2014 that\nticket to go \u2014 to go into the army or whatever, the labe \u2014 forced labor, you just to\nright away, give a no \u2014 couple of hours and you had to go. But anyway, in that time\nit was also Poland. Germany tried to occupy Poland, but there was a big fight\nbetween \u2014 in Germany and Poland. So all the military went through our \u2014 our\ntown. And whatever they seen, they seen wood, you know, wood was a big\ncommodity, you know, because everybody need wood to cook, and t \u2014 so they seen\nready made wood, ready made, cut, everything, just to put it in the oven, they took \u2014\ncleaned out the whole \u2014 the \u2014 all the wood was \u2014 even the Germans went through\nthe town, Polacks went through the town. The Hungarian army went there.\nEverybody grabbed whatever they could. If they seen, they didn\u2019t ask no question.\nIf you had a cow someplace in the pasture, they just grabbed the cow, they\nslaughtered them, that\u2019s it.",
        "A: There was ano \u2014 another \u2014 another family was also in that business, but my\nfather was a \u2014 on the \u2014 on the big \u2014 1n the \u2014 he \u2014 he was in the bigger business.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Cause he used to export it all over Europe. So now it became a thing, because\nall the money was invested in that wood, and since everything was stolen, and my\nmother was in bad situation. So \u2014 and, you know, as I said, in those days, th \u2014 over\nthere was no welfare either, and th-the \u2014 the government didn\u2019t pay you anything\nbecause you \u2014 your father is in the service there, whatever he did \u2014 he was like a\nsoldier, but he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he wasn\u2019t doing a soldier\u2019s work, but they called him like a\nsoldier. He had to wear a uniform, a Hungarian uniform. So my mother send s \u2014 had\nsome jewelry, so she sold out the jewelry, you know, how much \u2014 so eventually\nthere\u2019s plenty of times that we were in ba-bad shape, he \u2014 went to the bed hungry,\nyou know, because my mother said, I haven\u2019t got what to give you, go to bed to\nsleep. And sometimes she had a piece of bread, she cu \u2014 she \u2014 you know, we were\nthree boys and her is four, so she \u2014 she cut it in three pieces. And I \u2014 so I said \u2014 I\nwas the oldest one, I says, how come you \u2014 you not cutting for yourself? You just \u2014\nand I said no \u2014 nobody \u2014 because my brothers, they listened to me, you see, I was\nthe oldest one, so they \u2014 whatever I said was going. So I said, you \u2014 nobody eats\nunless she cuts it in four pieces. Cause I didn't want my mother should \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 sh-sh-should need. I \u2014 I had a wonderful mother, this \u2014 that \u2014 one thing,\nnobody could take this away from me, because she was just one of the ni \u2014 I mean,\nMay 20, 2009\neverybody likes th \u2014 their \u2014 his or hers mother, but she was the best mother for us.\nShe would have give her life away. As a matter of fact, you could see, she didn't\nwant to eat, and I says no, you have to eat too. And she didn\u2019t have no choice, she\nhad to eat it. The kids wouldn\u2019t eat it, would take it from her. But then luckily,\nluckily you see, when God keeps his hand over you, and everything turns out to be\ngood. We, where we lived, our house was the post office, also. We had the big\nhouse, and we used to rent for the post office. They used to post \u2014",

So he says, do you\nmind if P\u2019ll ask you a question? She says, yeah, you could ask me a question, she\nsays. So he introduced himself and he says, you know, I\u2019m a \u2014 I\u2019m a big farmer, I\nhave a lot of cattle, and anything food, you name it, I have it, he says. Maybe you\ncould cook for me too, because I don\u2019t like the food what I \u2014 what \u2014 what they cook\nthere for us in the thing. My mother says, well, if you would like to, gladly, we will\nhelp you out. Come in any time you want. And he says, this ca \u2014 has to be every\nday. And suddenly, after a week time, you should see them, we got maybe 10\npackages in the post office, big boxes, food he \u2014 he wrote home, and they send him\nmeat and sugar a-an \u2014 and flour, you name it.

And suddenly wa \u2014 there was no more\ndividing a \u2014a piece of bread in four pieces, we had all kind of food, whatever you\nwanted. So you see, there\u2019s a time when you get a lift.",

And si\n\u2014 they left also money, they paid, you know, wha-whatever. They were very happy\nwith my mother\u2019s cooking. So \u2014 so thanks God for that because \u2014 but, it didn\u2019t last\ntoo long.",
        "A: Yeah.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Of the t \u2014 forced laborers, right.",
        "A: Th-They were Hungarian Jews, all the way deep from Hungaria.",
        "A: Now suddenly, this forced labor start \u2014 you know, they didn\u2019t stay, they stayed\nfor a couple of months, whatever it is, and then they send them someplace else. But\nthat wasn\u2019t the \u2014 the problem, because we had, for at least for another year or two to\neat, we had so much food in the house, whatever they \u2014 they send us, you know,\nplenty food, no \u2014 no problem with that. There was one night, beginning in 1944, the\nHungarians \u2014 Hungarians came with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the hung \u2014 Hungarians\nand the German from the Gestapo came in, just like that. You have an hour time to\nget out from your house. Leave all the jewelry, all the money you have, leave it on\nthe table, and leave the keys in the door. And you have to go end of the town, there\nwas \u2014 you know, there was a lot of \u2014 like a hotel type, you know, they had a lot of\nrooms. All the Jewish people have to be \u2014 leave everything from the house, take a\ncouple of pieces what you need, and the rest \u2014 le \u2014 leave everything home. And if\nyou have money, leave it on the table. And if we gonna find out that you packed\nMay 20, 2009\nsome money away, you'll be shot \u2014 put to the wall and shot. That was the German\ntalking. And they me \u2014 they meant business, because they were unbelievable, those\npeople. You gonna hear stories, later down in the line. So we \u2014 we \u2014 it \u2014 yes. And\nmy father was sent on a furlough for a couple of days. So he just was called an-and\nthis \u2014 with us together, so we were all together.",
        "A: Back home \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for a couple of days, but once they took him away, that\u2019s it, they couldn\u2019t\nreturn th \u2014 no more, to where he was. But this \u2014 they didn\u2019t care about that.",
        "A: And my father.",
        "A: And my father.",
        "A: Because he didn\u2019t return to his \u2014 his unit.",
        "A: That was finished, the unit was gone already. And that was the first night of\nPassover, Ill never forget that. Suddenly \u2014 th-the kid \u2014 the young kids, they lay\nMay 20, 2009\ndown to sleep and the bigger kids wer \u2014 you know, Passover, there\u2019s a Passover\nmeal, you know, and they \u2014 I don\u2019t know, are you Jewish, or no?",
        "A: No, no, that\u2019s okay, tha \u2014 but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but you know about \u2014 you know about those things \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1s \u2014 there\u2019s \u2014 they call it a Seder and they \u2014 they pray, and they eat matzos,\nthey do-don\u2019t eat bread, things like that. Suddenly, I would say it was dark outside,\nsuddenly Germans came in with \u2014 with about two, three cars, with motorcycles.\nAnd they \u2014 and we were sitting, by the \u2014 they didn\u2019t open the door, they broke the\ndoor in coming in. They always ma \u2014 like to make a \u2014 what do you call that\n[indecipherable] something, something \u2014",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: They breaking in, and they started to shoot in th \u2014 in the \u2014 on the ceiling, you\nknow, and the kids started to \u2014 they got \u2014 they scared the \u2014 first they tried to scare\nthe people, and make a \u2014 a -- behollah(ph) means, you know, with noises and with\nMay 20, 2009\ndogs, you know, this was their motive always, to scare the \u2014 first the people, and to,\nyou know, to make them afraid of them. So that\u2019s how they \u2014 they rushed in. And th\n\u2014 all you hear, people are cry \u2014 the kids were crying and screaming, you know,\nbecause they got scared. They don\u2019t know who \u2014 that was German or it was\nHungarian, or something. And then they put machine guns on this \u2014 on the street,\nand there was a field going down to the water. There was a\u2014 ariver. The river was\nthat \u2014 the Tisa. That was the big river there. So my uncle \u2014 people were running\nlike \u2014 like crazy, were u \u2014 one on this way, one that way, one the other way around,\ncause they got so scared, frightened, you know, from those \u2014 from those Germans,\nthe \u2014 when you come in \u2014 somebody comes in in a house and starts shooting and\nbreaking and ca \u2014 and hitting you, thing, you get scared and you run every \u2014 a-all\nover. So, my uncle was running to the water, in the snow, you could see right away,\nwhen a person runs on the snow, you could see. Snow is white and if he wears the\ndark clothes, you can spot him right away. They shoo \u2014 killed him right there on the\nspot, so he fell that \u2014 right there. I was running with a friend of mine, he had the\nlittle baby. The \u2014 the mother just gave birth like maybe a week or two years old, I\ndon\u2019t remember exactly that, but very small baby. So we ran in \u2014 into a shack there,\nand they were running through, and suddenly the baby gave a cry, you know, he\nwoke up, and the \u2014 right away. So they came in, and, get out, you know, and the\nMay 20, 2009\nGermans, get out from there. And one guy hit me with a gun \u2014 with a\u2014 with a gun\nfrom the end of the gun, hit me over the head. Luckily, he didn\u2019t hi \u2014 he didn\u2019t hi \u2014\nif he would have hit that baby, that baby would be dead right there. Didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t\nmatter anyway, because the baby didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t survive anyway, but that\u2019s besi \u2014\nanother point. So that was \u2014 we were there in this house for about a couple of days,\nand from there they took us and we went to Malt\u00e9szalka, that was a ghetto.",
        "A: Winter of \u201844.",
        "A: Beginning an \u2014 beginning of \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or something like that.",
        "A: All right. So [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, we went to \u2014 they took us and put us in-into wagons, and they \u2014 they\npacked us in like sardines there. We came to Mat\u00e9szalka and after a \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow, we rode the whole night and \u2014 and half a day, I think, something like that, a\nday and a half. And then ther \u2014 they put us on an open field, no nothing, no \u2014 and it\nMay 20, 2009\nwas raining, you know, and it was cold. And we did \u2014 we\u2019d \u2014 we had the ha \u2014 no\nraincoats, we didn\u2019t have raincoats, things like that, or the coat. And a lot of people\ndied there on this \u2014 on the thing, because the older people, they just couldn\u2019t take it,\nit was very cold.",
        "A: On the field, we were, for a nice couple of days. I cannot tell you \u2014 maybe four\ndays, five days \u2014",
        "A: The \u2014 there wer \u2014 there was also houses there, but in the beginning they\nwouldn\u2019t let us into the houses, because it wasn\u2019t ready somehow, I don\u2019t know.\nBut after then, we came into the houses. And we were there in Malt\u00e9szalka also for\n\u2014 just for a couple of weeks. And it \u2014",
        "A: Well, you use the bathroom, you went there on the side a little bit. Who cares? In\nthose days you didn\u2019t care. Could be a good looking girl, or something. I was a kid,\nI didn\u2019t e \u2014 wasn\u2019t interested in those days for \u2014 for the women, or something. But\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s was life. And they had there a guy, also a German, the Gestapo. If he\nwalked by and he seen you, he didn\u2019t like your looks or whatever, he took out his\nMay 20, 2009\npistol and killed you on the spot, without any questions ask. And he gets away with\neverything because he do whatever he wants to do. Killed people. And we were so\nscared, when we seen him, everybody was hiding, because we knew what this guy\nis doing.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know, there was a lot of people this \u2014 not only from our town, from\nall over around. For \u2014 they always \u2014 took most \u2014 most they took them there to\nMat\u00e9szalka. Maybe they took him someplace else too, which I don\u2019t know. I was\nstill a kid that time, and a \u2014 but anyway, after a couple of weeks, we were in\nMat\u00e9szalka and one day they came and they says, you \u2014 you people are gonna go\nto work, and you going to Poland to work. We didn\u2019t have nothing to say. And then\nthey said, we\u2019re gonna examine you, and if you still have any jewelry or something\n\u2014 they undressed everybody naked, stark naked and they checked you out from top\nto bottom, and if you had something hidden or something, they beat you up like\nunbelievable. So finally they put us in wagons. And we didn\u2019t know where we are\ngoing, but we wi \u2014 wind up in Auschwitz-Birkenau.",
        "A: In the \u2014 1-1 \u2014 that wa \u2014 in this point, my mother, my father and the three brother \u2014\nthree kids.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: That\u2019s \u2014 includes me, too.",
        "A: Three kids, we are three brothers. Finally \u2014 and this was \u2014 this was unbelievable,\nbecause you see, in that time, a lot of military was going. So if a military train\ncame, they took us and pushed us in the back to make for them the \u2014 the right of\nway to go, to go ahe \u2014 oh, this must be my wife.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. [tape break] Bay \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right. Well anyway, now we arriving to \u2014 to Auschwitz-Birkenau. We still\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on. As soon as they opened the doors, you could see\nthe Germans \u2014 Gestapo. This is the SS, you know, this \u2014 they are the worst, with\ndogs, with German Shepherds. And they were instigating those dogs, you know,\nand ri \u2014 the dogs came, you know, with [growls]. You know, they \u2014 they are\ntrained, killer dogs, you know.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: This is already in Auschwitz.",
        "A: We just arrived to Auschwitz. And screaming, raus \u2014 and there was a lady, I \u2014 I\nremember, I \u2014 and I used to know her because her \u2014 her father was a shoemaker in\ntown. And she had poli \u2014 she had polio. She was about 25 years old, I think, and she\nhad the little girl. But she \u2014 when she had the little girl she didn\u2019t have the \u2014 later on\nshe di \u2014 somehow she developed polio. And she \u2014 they brought her with \u2014 with her\nbed, because she couldn\u2019t walk, she couldn\u2019t move. Don\u2019t ask. So the German\ngrabbed \u2014 pushed her out, with the bed, and the bed flew this way and she went the\nother way around. And she was crying, you know, but he \u2014 they didn\u2019t care. Now, I\nwas a kid. For me to jump down from that wa \u2014 wagon was nothing, because a kid,\nyou know, is about this tall \u2014 high. But an elderly person, he couldn\u2019t jump down\nfrom there, because he is old, too old, or an elderly woman, or somebody. A young\nguy is nothing, to jump down from here to the ground is nothing.",
        "A: Right. And they started to hit us with the \u2014 with the canes and with the dogs, and\neverybody was running in different directions. I run this way, my mother, father,\nsomehow wind up the other way around, and some of my brother went this way,\nMay 20, 2009\nyou know. Depends, depends. You \u2014 you always try to run away from the thing. So\nfinally everybody was out from the wagons because they had to ma \u2014 clear the \u2014 the\nrails, that\u2019s the reason they wanted us one, two, three out, but it takes time to \u2014 to\njump out from there even, and especially for the sick people or elderly people, they\njust couldn\u2019t jump like ano \u2014 another person. So finally, a guy comes over to me, an\ninmate already, a\u2014 a Jewish guy from Poland. He says listen, don\u2019t tell them how\nold you are. Tell them that you are older, and tell them that you are an electrician.\nGuy came over and talked to me in Jewish.",
        "A: In \u2014 in that time I was about \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 twel \u2014 13, something like that.",
        "A: Thirteen. So he says \u2014 he says to me, now you see there in the corner? That\u2019s\nMengele standing there. You heard about Mengele?",
        "A: You just have heard.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: The death of the a \u2014 a-angel of death. Cause if he send you this way or he send\nyou this way, this way is to life, and this way is to die. Now, he is gonna interview,\nhe interviews everybody. And he just makes with the finger, this way, that way, this\nway, that way, but sometimes he stops and asks you some questions. So when I\ncame, he asked me, how old are you? I says, I\u2019m 15. He looks, looks. Well, you\nworking? He said what \u2014 what did you do? I said, I worked electrician helper. Yeah,\nokay, he send me this way. People \u2014 if you were pregnant, he \u2014 I don\u2019t care how old\nyou are, if 18 or 20 or 15, when he see that you\u2019re pregnant, that\u2019s to die. There\u2019s no\nquestion, as any pregnant woman was going to the \u2014 to the crematoriums.",
        "A: Undressed, no, no.",
        "A: This is still ust from the wagons out \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and then when \u2014 when he sends you this way, you had to go through a bath,\nand they change you, took away all your clothing, and they give you the\nconcentration camp clothing, you know, those striped clothings? You must have\nseen it in the \u2014",
        "A: All right, okay. So \u2014 and now suddenly, I became all by myself. I didn\u2019t see \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t know where my father was, I didn't know where my mother was, I didn\u2019t\nknow my two brothers. Own \u2014 only by myself, completely by myself. Okay. So\nfinally we came in, and they sh \u2014 take all \u2014 sheared up all \u2014 all your hair, all over,\nand they \u2014 they call it ant-lousing. You know, they disinfect you, you know,\nbecause a lot of people maybe came, had lice or whatever, this, you know, so \u2014 and\nthey took away everything what you had and they gave you the concentration camp\nclothes. So I wind up in \u2014 in the \u2014 in \u2014 in F lager. You see, Auschwitz was divided,\nA, B, C, D and E \u2014 and F. Now, between \u2014 between each, A and B, there was high\nvoltage wires. You touch that wire, and that\u2019s it, you cannot \u2014 could not \u2014 you could\nnot pull back your hand. It\u2019s like \u2014 it pulled you like a magnet, it killed you\ninstantly.",
        "A: Yeah, [ll \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we\u2019ll come \u2014 we\u2019ll come \u2014 coming \u2014 coming to that. So anyway, I just want to\ntell you the way \u2014 ho-how I arrived there. So finally I came into the barrack, I was\nso tired, so knocked out, because in-inside in the wagons, you couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t\nstretch my feet. If you sit down you couldn\u2019t get up, if you get up you couldn\u2019t sit\nMay 20, 2009\ndown because like \u2014 like sardines they put you in \u2014 1n those \u2014 in those things. Now\nimagine if you had to go to the bathroom. And what do you think you did? You did\nwhere you were standing. And the smell, you know, from I don\u2019t know how many\npeople it was in the wagon, at least 50 - 60 \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you because I\nreally, honestly don\u2019t know myself.",
        "A: Still \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: But this is already now I\u2019m out from the wagons.",
        "A: So, I was very thirsty and was a hot day that time, and I was so thirsty. They\ndidn\u2019t give you nothing, nothing to eat, but I went to the faucet and drink a little bit\nwater. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2014 that calmed me down, I says, now I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m \u2014\nthere was no bunk beds, and no nothing there. On the cement lay down, and that\u2019s\nit. | lay down, I took off my \u2014 my pants and my jacket and I put it under my head,\nyou know, and my shoes. In the morning around four o\u2019clock, was pouring outside\n\u2014 we had Gypsy overseers, sigo \u2014 Gypsy, Zigeuners, you know. You heard about\nZigeuner?\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: There\u2019s some German \u2014 Gypsies is the German Zigeuner. They also beat us,\nyou know, raus, out, out, for the appell, you know, outside those \u2014 lined up. I take\na look. I haven\u2019t got no clothes, I haven\u2019t got no shoes. Look [indecipherable] I\nsee. I haven\u2019t got nothing to put on. Somebody took it away from me. So I says to\nmyself, listen Mr. Saul, you better change your \u2014 your habits here, you see what\u2019s\ngoing on here. You gonna do what you did right now, you not gonna survive here\nfor a long time. Okay.",
        "A: No, no, was me \u2014 this different \u2014 all mixed in, all different transports.",
        "A: Yeah, sure, they were \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, coming in. You see, in Auschwitz, the-they annihilated 1-in a day they\ncould annihilate 10,000 people, that mass production what they had, the\ncrematoriums. But I'll be come \u2014 coming \u2014 coming to that, too. So finally we went\noutside, everybody was outside. And then I said to myself \u2014 we were sitting there til\nit got light, because when I \u2014 we were \u2014 they chased us out, was still dark outside.\nSo finally, must have been maybe seven, eight o\u2019clock, I don\u2019t know because I\nMay 20, 2009\ndidn\u2019t have a watch and I didn\u2019t know the time. Because over there the time \u2014 the \u2014\nthe time didn\u2019t mean anything.",
        "A: So we\u2019re sitting, sitting, then I said to myself \u2014 you see, the barracks were going\none barrack here, one barrack here, one bar \u2014 and here was a place that we used to\nsit between the barracks. I said, you know, let me take a look, maybe I\u2019Il go to the\nnext, maybe I\u2019ll see somebody from my hometown that I \u2014 I could recogni \u2014 maybe\nI'll see my father. Just for a guessing, you know? So I see nobody looking, I pfft,\nand outside, and I pass by there, I look, I look. Nobody. I went one \u2014 another\nbarrack further, nobody. I said, let me try one more. I try one more, nothing, didn't\nfind anyone. As I\u2019m turning around, there was a window. I looked inside \u2014 peek\ninside from the back of the barrack, I see a barrel is there, coffee.",
        "A: So I pulled the window \u2014 windows open, pull one, I\u2019m looking. I jump in, and at\nfirst \u2014 first I go and drink like that. \u2019'm \u2014 I\u2019m still drinking \u2014",
        "A: I was so thirsty, you haven\u2019t got no idea. I\u2019m still drinking the coffee, if I close\nmy eyes, the way I was drinking the coffee. So I drank, I drank and \u2014 and now I was\nMay 20, 2009\nfull. Now I was satisfied wi-with drinking, because you know you \u2014 when you are\nvery thirsty, your mouth is dry.",
        "A: No \u2014 nobody, nobody else because they were no more sitting there.",
        "A: There was \u2014 this part was empty, that\u2019s the reason na \u2014 then I see a canteens,\nGerman canteens, you know, laying on the floor. I don\u2019t know how that coffee went\nin there or what or who put it in there. Don\u2019t ask me, because I don\u2019t know. All I\nseen it there, I ran inside, I took one canteen, put it in the \u2014 filled it up and put it in\nmy shirt, now this time, you know, because they shouldn\u2019t s \u2014",
        "A: No, there\u2019s about thi-this tall, you know.",
        "A: And thi-this wide. It\u2019s a canteen of coffee.",
        "A: I put it in my shirt because if they gonna see me with a ca \u2014 things, you know,\ncould get into trouble. I went back to my place, and finally lunch time they give you\n\u2014 they took like in a pot for five people, and they count one, two, three, four, five\nand they give you a pot with some soup in it. Now, if they\u2019re nice people you\u2019ve \u2014\nMay 20, 2009\nyou met \u2014 find nice people, they share that with you, one spoon for you, one spoon\nfor me. But sometimes they [indecipherable] stronger guys and they said the kid,\nwho \u2014 who cares, you know? Sometimes you get \u2014 didn\u2019t get anything.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: With other inmates. I got a couple of spoons myself and all right, what I got, I\ngot, that\u2019s it. You know, I \u2014 I was used to already so \u2014 sometimes not to eat,\nbecause you didn\u2019t have ron \u2014 there was a time where you didn\u2019t have what to eat.",
        "A: Yeah, but thi-this is later on \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 later on, when it \u2014 it settled down. It\u2019s one thing, I never believed in trading.\nThose people give away the piece of bread for cigarettes, you know. Fo \u2014 and\nbesides, I didn\u2019t smoke, so \u2014 and I didn't want to take. Whatever they gave me, I\nsaid that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna eat, and no \u2014 no trading.",
        "A: Later on you\u2019ll see why \u2014 why \u2014 why I was doing that. So anyway, I came at\nnight, and I went to sleep. In between, when I went out this mor \u2014 the \u2014 the\nmorning, before [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t have no \u2014 no \u2014 no pants, no nothing. I\nseen in the garbage can, I found a pair of pants, old pants but this big. Maybe two\nsows could fit in there, not one. Big pants. I just took it, made a knot, and I was\nholding like this, at least I had a pair of pants. At night, I met there a guy, so he\nsays, here there\u2019s another pair \u2014 a \u2014 a jacket, and there\u2019s a pair of shoes, maybe they\nfit you. Eh, it fit me, so I was sort of back in bus \u2014 but didn't \u2014 was-wasn\u2019t new, but\nI was covered. At night suddenly, and I still had my canteen, but this time I \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t put my \u2014 my stuff just like put it down, you know, make believe, an-and then\nthey should steal it from me. I learned my lesson very fast. You had to learn,\notherwise you couldn\u2019t survive. So, at night I hear somebody cries, mommy,\nmommy, mommy. He had scarlet fever. How did I know, I\u2019m gonna tell you how I\nknew it, too. And he says \u2014 he was burning up. You know, scarlet fever goes with a\nvery high temperature. So then another guy who was sleeping next to me says, who\nhas water, who has \u2014 who has to drink, something? So I go over \u2014 I get up, you\nknow, I was still new, you know, when I heard somebody crying, it \u2014 it bothered\nme. And I went over there, and I opened his mouth and I put a little drop \u2014 a couple\nof drops of coffee. Oh, he said, oh. And now he felt good because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s cool,\nMay 20, 2009\nit\u2019s water, it cooled him off a little bit. And then I went back to my place to sleep,\nand I slept. In the morning \u2014 again, they chased us out early in the morning, but this\ntime they made two line \u2014 two lines. One group was this way, and one group was\nthis way going. And I came out. Wherever I went, I s \u2014 I stopped right there in this\n\u20141n this place. Suddenly, we were \u2014 got a little bit li \u2014 if you sit down, we were\nsitting there and waiting for what\u2019s going to be next. Suddenly the kid from last\nnight, happened the same thing. He fell down and fainted again, because the high \u2014\nthe fever, the big fever was burning him up. And again, who has drink, who? He\nneeds some water, who has something for him to drink? So I got up, I still had th \u2014\nmy ca\u2014 my \u2014 my canteen, you know\u201d?",
        "A: And I give him again, but this time I couldn\u2019t go back to my old place, so I stood\nright there. And then the \u2014 the Germans came right away, at \u2014 maybe in half an hour\nafter, and they said this line this way, and this line remains here. So those people\nwhere I was going was supposed to remain there, but then we went into the D lager.\nFirst of all, we came in, we had bunk beds, no more sleeping on the floor. Wa \u2014 the\nmiddle, one on the bottom, in the middle and on the top. And there was about six \u2014\nsix kids in one back \u2014 on the top six, on the ba \u2014 middle, and in \u2014 on the bottom six.\nSo about 18 kids in a bunk bed.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: It came lunch, you got a \u2014 you got a plate, a separate plate, with a spoon, and\nyou got a liter of soup. This time they couldn\u2019t cheat you, because you got your\nown, and \u2014 and besides, they had th \u2014 if you wanted [indecipherable] you \u2014 you\ncould repeat and you could go again and they give it \u2014 give you another soup, so it\u2019s\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: I said, my God, what a difference from one place to the next. Okay.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "A: Plates you gave back, they \u2014 they wer \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 there were some kids that used to \u2014 that was divided. You had to wash those\nplates, and they washed it for you, and some people went to the kitchen, picked up\nthe soup, or th \u2014 they give you the bread, or whatever, whatever the food was\ndivided. In the morning you had already coffee. There wasn\u2019t coffee, 1t was \u2014 they\ntook some, like a corn, and they burned it and they thin \u2014 that was the coffee, you\nknow, it wasn\u2019t \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 coffee like you get. Yeah, fake coffee is right. They used to call it ersatz, in\nGerman, it\u2019s fay \u2014 ersatz coffee, but it wasn\u2019t real coffee, just fake coffee. That\u2019s\nthe right word there, but i-in German used to be ersatz. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, anyway, let me see. Yeah, okay.",
        "A: Yeah. We \u2014 we came \u2014 so now, it \u2014 situation improved. But it didn\u2019t last too\nlong. What happened? We had the German Jewish doctor. He was in charge of the \u2014\nof the kids. The \u2014 this was only kids, kids tha \u2014 between 11 - 12 til \u2014 til 15 or\nsomething like that. There was \u2014 the barrack was lo \u2014 all only kids. So he found that\none of the kids that I gave him the coffee, had scarlet fever, so he had to report it to\nthe Germans, that. Now today a scarlet fever, you give one injection, and \u2014 and it\u2019s\nfinished, it\u2019s over. Over there they didn\u2019t treat you, instead \u2014 and I\u2019m gonna tell you\nwhat happened with those kids, and what happened with me.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Yeah, well, I\u2019m coming \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 thi-this now, I\u2019m coming right now to it. So as soon as he reported it \u2014 so\nMengele was in charge of the health, the \u2014 you know, killing and making all kind of\ninjections and \u2014 or taking the person and cutting open without the \u2014 without the\nanesthesia, you know. All those \u2014 those good things what he was famous for. So\nonce he found out that there is scarlet fever in barrack 27, I was in the 27\" barrack,\nhe came in wa \u2014 and the next day, must have been nine o\u2019clock, I think, and he had\nalways a sergeant walking with him. He didn\u2019t have no gun, but the sergeant had\nthe small pistol on \u2014 on the side, I still remember them. So he used to come, and we\nhad to stand naked, and he looked at you. If you had like measles or pimples or\nsomething, that means that you had the scarlet fever. And he took one look at you,\nhe said wshht, this way. This way meant \u2014 because in the back of \u2014 this is the\nbarrack in the front, this is the front, this is the back. In the back where the\nambulance was standing there and waiting. God forbid if you had anything like\npimples or measles or something, they sent you straight in the ambulance.",
        "A: Ambulance, ambulance, yeah. In German they say ambulance, I still \u2014 I still\nspeak German.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: A-Ambulance. Now, nobody knew what was happening to you, this was the first\ntime. So he had a co \u2014 picked out maybe four or five kids, ambulance. Ambulance\nwent straight around, out, and the crematoriums were right here, put them in the\ncrematorium, gassed them, goodbye. He used to come every day. Every day he used\nto come for inspection. And this \u2014 this time we were 1n quarantine. You couldn\u2019t\ncome in, you couldn\u2019t go out. And they used to bring the food, put it down in front\nof the \u2014 of the door, by the door, and we had to take it in. When the ba \u2014 the barrels\nwere empty, we had to put them outside. That \u2014 that was our job, that you didn\u2019t do\nno work, no nothing because you couldn\u2019t \u2014 we were not allowed to go outside,\nonly in the barracks. Was a quarantine. One day \u2014 Mengele used to come every \u2014\nevery morning like, you know Germans, they \u2014 they punctual.",
        "A: Yeah. One day we take a look this, he\u2019s supposed to be here, he still didn\u2019t come\nhere. And somehow you know, you didn\u2019t do anything, and I just felt tired, and I\nfell asleep. [phone ringing]",
        "A: Yeah.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: So, I fall asleep. And you know, we had a blanket this time, with a straw like \u2014a\nmattress from straw, you know, inside. But there was a blanket over it, and the\nblanket had like dimples, you know, up and down, th-the \u2014 it wasn\u2019t straight,\nsmooth. And it left me an imprint on my face. And I was in the middle of \u2014 I always\nliked to be in the middle of the bunk beds, not on the top and not on the bottom, in\nthe middle. And Mengele goes through, and I was right here on the end, on the first\nthing, and he stops right next to me. And he looks, looks, looks, and then he says,\ncome a \u2014 raus, come outside. Well, he calls me wa \u2014 my friends on the top thing,\nthey were crying already, because they \u2014 we knew already where you are going.\nNow imagine, it\u2019s like a death penalty, you know. When he calls you, 99 \u2014 99\npercent that you are finished. And the barrack, this was the barrack and the length \u2014\nthere used to be horses in those barracks before. So there was like a trough, the\nhorses used to drink from that tro \u2014 torf \u2014 trough, they call it?",
        "A: Trough, right. So they went, they filled in, where the water was, they filled it in\nwith cement, and then we use it like a table or a bench, we used to sit on that \u2014 on\nthe ho \u2014 on the whole length, from the barrack. So we used to sit there. So Mengele\ntold me to sit down there, he took out a thermometer and put it in under my arms,\nand he went to inspect for \u2014 now it comes to me and says \u2014 says, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t pull\nMay 20, 2009\nit too hard, because I was afraid \u2014 I didn\u2019t know if I had a fever or not, but if he\ncalled me out there must be something, because he \u2014 so I \u2014 I pulled away from it,\nand I didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t hold it tight, 1t should [indecipherable]. When he came back,\nhe takes out a temperature, it didn\u2019t even pull the normal temperature. So he knew\nright away what I did.",
        "A: He\u2019s not \u2014 he wasn\u2019t stupid, that guy.",
        "A: Mengele.",
        "A: Tha-That\u2019s the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the angel of death.",
        "A: Yeah, on \u2014 on that face, right.",
        "A: Now what \u2014 you know what he did?",
        "A: He sat down on this thing, took me, sat me on his lap, and he was holding me\nthis time like this. I couldn\u2019t do no more anything, couldn\u2019t do a thing. My heart wa\nMay 20, 2009\n\u2014Ie-every beat from my heart, I heard it in my ears, because I knew this 1s the\nend. I still didn\u2019t know, when he took out the temperature, I didn\u2019t know if 1t was\nnormal or not normal, he didn't tell me anything, he \u2014 he didn't \u2014 wouldn't tell me\nanything. Now, he took out a temperature, my temperature was normal. He comes\nwith the funny smile, he says in German, mach das du verschwins. Make that you\ndisappear from here before I change my mind. Did I disappear from there. You\nknow what means jet propulsion? Like a jet.",
        "A: I am the first \u2014 the only kid that survived from Mengele.",
        "A: In \u20141n that \u2014 in that \u2014 in that \u2014 in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Because when he took you out already, you were finished. But he \u2014 I seen he\nwas standing and waiting, but he wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] himself, but I said, ah,\nmaybe he-he still \u2014 he still has maybe the scarlet fever, but I didn\u2019t have anything, I\njust fall asleep and the imprint left me from that blanket. So that was I went through\nwith Mengele.",
        "A: No, only \u2014 only \u2014 only him and \u2014 and a sergeant.",
        "A: The two people ca \u2014 always used to come in for the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for the inspection. So now, finally, there came a day, and everybo \u2014 yeah,\nokay, now comes an interesting thing. One night I \u2014 we went to sleep. And I had a\nfriend, he was sleeping always on the bottom. I take a look. His name was \u2014\nHungarian kid, Jewish kid, his name was Gustie(ph). I say \u2014 take a look downstair,\nI said, he\u2019s not here yet, I says, what happened to him, he\u2019s supposed to be \u2014 you\nknow. Waiting, waiting, waiting. Maybe about two, three hours later, I take a look,\nhe comes in with a shopping bag. And I says, Gustie(ph), where have you been? I\nspoke to him Hungarian, because you see, Hungarian Jews don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t speak\nYiddish. They don\u2019t speak je \u2014 only Hungarian, most of them. He says, shh, don\u2019t\nsay anything, Ill talk to you in the morning. First he gives me a piece of \u2014 a piece\nof bread, and then an apple, and he give me some cake. Said sh, don\u2019t [inaudible]\ntalk. So, he says don\u2019t talk, Pll tell you tomorrow morning, everything. He put it\nunder his bed. People were sleeping, so nobody knew what was going on.",
        "A: Just the two of me, because I was waiting for him, he is my friend \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 you know, so I wanted to know what happened to him. Okay, so in the\nmorning he told me the whole story. You know, there is, in barrack 13, there used to\nbe the Sonderkommand6o, they used to called themselves Sonderkommando.\nThose people used to work in the crematoriums, they\u2019re Jewish people. Each six\nmonths they used to exchange them and kill those \u2014 those people themself; they\nalways take new people. Cause the Germans said that they knew too much, and they\nwere afraid it shouldn\u2019t leak out. But the whole world knew already, especially the\nRoosevelt and Churchill, they knew what was going on in Auschwitz.",
        "A: So anyway, so he told me that \u2014 I says, where did you get all those things? So he\nsays, I\u2014 I went to the barrack 13. That\u2019s the Sonderkommando, that\u2019s what \u2014 you\nsee those chimneys, the crematoriums? Because I was there, I still didn\u2019t know, I\nthought they were factories. See, y-you couldn\u2019t get out, but there was the wires,\nyou couldn\u2019t go on the other side. And \u2014 but you seen the chimneys. I didn't know\nthey were crematoriums.",
        "A: No, at that time I didn\u2019t know. So then he explained it to me that this \u2014 this is\ncrematorium. He told me already, because he went there, but he couldn\u2019t\nMay 20, 2009\ncommunicate with those people cause they were Polish Jewish kid \u2014 people\nworking there, and he didn't speak Polish, and he didn\u2019t speak Yiddish, and they\ncouldn\u2019t communicate. And they spe \u2014 didn\u2019t speak Hungarian. So I says, you know\nwhat, I\u2019m gonna go myself, too. Pll go next \u2014 he says, it\u2019s very dangerous. Because\nyou know, there\u2019s floodlights, and they go like \u2014 like this. Like this around, back\nand forth, back and forth. So if you are caught in those floodlights, you are finished,\nbecause th-there\u2019s the towers where the Germans \u2014 Gestapo stands, and they see\nsomething moving, no questions asked, they \u2014 they shoot you [indecipherable].\nCould you hold this for a few minute?",
        "A: So-\u2014 yes, okay, I \u2014 I listened to his advice what he gave me, and I took it very\nseriously, because I know that if something goes wrong, I never will be able to\ncome back. So you had to be very, very, very careful. [interference] Anyway, next\n\u2014 the next day or two days later, I don\u2019t remember exactly when it was, I said to\nhim, okay, I\u2019m leaving right now. And he said, go to the end of the barracks. There\nis a board, just pull it away, sneak out, go to the left, and you will see barrack 13 in\nthe back, it says 13. That\u2019s where you have to go in, just bang in the door couple of\ntimes and they \u2014 they are out, they\u2019re gonna let you in. I said okay, I got the\nmessage. And then, when you come to barrack 13, the same way where you put the\nMay 20, 2009\n\u2014and there was \u2014 the end of the barrack was the bathroom, so \u2014 and then the \u2014 on\nthe 13 is the same way. Pull the board, first knock on the door, and if they don\u2019t\nopen the door, you could do the same thing. But first wait, and if not, you could go\nin through that board, too. But we \u2014 the main important thing was, be very careful\nwhen those floodlights go back and forth. When the floodlights go this way, you\nhave to go \u2014 move. When the floodlights come back, you have to lay down flat on\nyour stomach, so they shouldn\u2019t see no movements.",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah, b-between, yeah.",
        "A: I was in 27. From 27 there was all the uneven numbers; 27, tw \u2014 25 - 23, all\nuneven numbers til you come to 13. So anyway, I arrived there, everything went\nfine, everything is smooth. I followed very \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he warned me, be very\ncareful with those floodlight, that\u2019s the main important thing. Thanks God I made it,\nI came in. The first thing I opened the door they said, you speak Yiddish? The first\nthing.",
        "A: In\u2014 when I \u20141n 13, in barrack 13.",
        "A: And right away they \u2014I says yes, I\u2019m a Jewish guy, and I speak Yiddish.\nBecause the other kid didn\u2019t speak, they couldn\u2019t communicate with him, so they\nwere like \u2014 they make him with the hands, you know, but with me they didn't have\nno problem, and I could talk with them and everything. So I came in, and everybody\n\u2014 everybody hugged me, you know. I was the youngest kid, they were already big\nguys, you know, like 25 - 26 - 30 - 40 years old. Okay, first they ask me, are you\nhungry, you want to eat something? I says yeah, thank you very much, and they\ngave me the [inaudible] see, they were ba \u2014 from the tra \u2014 when the transport came\nin, so the people broke through the \u2014 you know, because they thought they going \u2014\nin the working camps, so they gonna need food, so whatever, they had food. And\nwhen they gassed them in the tanks, all the food remained, so they could take it\nhome with them.",
        "A: Right, right, right.",
        "A: So then I sat down an-and I was talking with them. So the first thing I asked\nthem, I says, you know, my parents, my mother, my father, my two brothers, I don\u2019t\nknow where they are. And, you know \u2014 but when he explained it, the crematoriums,\nI didn't know too much, because he didn\u2019t \u2014 he didn\u2019t understand either what they\nMay 20, 2009\nwere telling to him. Then I said \u2014 I said, I\u2019m not going to mention anything, I was\njust going to say, what are those chimneys there, you know? So then one guy come\nover and sit down, he says, might as well, you are here anyway. Might as well you\nshould know what\u2019s going on here. Those are not workings. Because I thought they\nwere factories, you know? Said, this is not a factory, a factory they \u2014 they burn the\nJewish people there, and gas them with Zyklon gas. And he said, we do the \u2014 we do\nthe sh \u2014 the pulling out the dead bodies, and all \u2014 they used to pull out the teeth, the\ngold teeth, and they \u2014 then they used to sell it to Switzerland. I don\u2019t know if you\nhear about it.",
        "A: Yeah. So he says, and your parents, he says, they must have gone up there to the\nsky, up higher, in the crematorium. Because I said, what is a crematorium? I didn\u2019t\nknow what a crematorium means, in those days. So they explained me, give me a\ngood \u2014 a good lesson, and they explained me whatever was going on, and he says,\nand don\u2019t think that we have it so good. We have all the food to eat, but you know,\nin six months we are next to \u2014 to be cremated, and th \u2014 and they \u2014 they knew about\nit.",
        "A: Yes, yes, that \u2014 that \u2014 that\u2019s what I \u2014 that\u2019s what I \u2014 hundred per \u2014 well, he told\nme, and I didn\u2019t find them here no more, so that means \u2014 and if they would have\ngone where I went, I would have met them inside there eventually. Not in one day,\nbut two days, in maybe the next week or two weeks, or three or four. And they\nweren\u2019t, so I said, that\u2019s what it 1s, so \u2014",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Well, okay, I\u2019m gonna come and I\u2019Il tell you what happened with my mother.",
        "A: Somebody told me that story from my mother, but from my father and two\nbrothers, I never heard again. Never, ever again. And then after that they gave me \u2014\nsaid take whatever you want fruit, and they give me also in the bag, you know, ba \u2014\ntwo bags, he said, be very careful how you go. They warned me too, you know. I\nsays yes, I know already, because my friend was here yesterday \u2014 he said \u2014 oh, not\nyesterday, a couple of days ago. He said, but he didn\u2019t speak no Yiddish. He says,\nyeah, we \u2014 we remember him. We couldn\u2019t talk with him, we just say \u2014 we talk with\nthe hand and the things. So a little [indecipherable] got out, but the main thing for\nMay 20, 2009\nhim, he didn\u2019t know what \u2014 he didn't tell them that they were wor-working in the\nSonderkommand, because he couldn\u2019t understand what they \u2014 what they were\ntalking to him. So now I knew already exactly that over there is the crematoriums,\nand that\u2019s where the people, they going \u2014 th-they \u2014 they used to call it, to the bathe\n\u2014 to the bathing, and it was showers inside like you go and take a shower, but\ninstead of the shower was the Zyklon gas came out. And that\u2019s how a lot of people\nwere dying there. Now, when the scarlet fever was over, and we were allowed\nalready, because scarlet fever died down, people were no more sick, we could go\noutside. And we used to work in the bar \u2014 barracks, you know, there was \u2014 okay,\nhere \u2014 here how what \u2014 Auschwitz was. When you came in the big tow \u2014 big \u2014 not\ndoors, but gates, and it says, Arbeit macht das Leben stiss. Work makes life sweet.\nThat\u2019s what is \u2014 a big sign said that.",
        "A: Arbeit macht frei, yeah, you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, you \u2014 yeah, right.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Yeah. You see them when you go out from the barrack, you could see in th \u2014 in\nthe front. It was right in the front when you came into the \u2014 to the barracks. Now,\nthis was \u2014 this was our barracks, right? The barracks were going one \u2014 like this.",
        "A: And then there was a road here, and on the other side was the same barracks, but\nwith the \u2014 with the even number or uneven numbers.",
        "A: And then here, y-you \u2014 you went straight, you came out to the gate. And on this\nside was a lot of times a cappella, you know, music playing, and g \u2014 the German\nJews from Vienna, they had an orchestra and they played. And on the other side the\n\u2014 on the other side was the crematorium, and the crematorium burned the people. A\nlot of times the Swiss cross, the Red Cross came to a \u2014 to inspect \u2014 for inspection,\nso-called inspection. So, you know how funny it was, here they burn people, and\nhere \u2014 here they \u2014 they played the music of bo \u2014 Goethe and Bach and Mozart,\nwhatever they used to play that for the \u2014 for the muse \u2014 musicians.",
        "A: No, no, crematorium was on the other side.",
        "A: Okay.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: This was \u2014 here was the orchestra, and here, on other side was a \u2014 here was the\nbarracks, on the uneven numbered, then the even numbered, and that was a \u2014 an\nelectric fence. And that\u2019s \u2014 on the other side was the crematoriums.",
        "A: So here was playing the music, and the thing.",
        "A: When \u2014 specially when they came there from the si \u2014 from Switzerland, the Red\nCross for ins \u2014 for inspection. And now they came over to you and asked you some\nquestion, you couldn\u2019t say anything bad, because the German is standing right\nthere. You say something bad, yo-you were so much afraid that you were shivering\nwhen you see those Gestapo. That\u2019s how bad \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 bad they were. But another thing, the ra \u2014 the \u2014 the Red Cross, right, used to\ngive packages for the inmates, was Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, Romanian inmates,\nyou know. Except, only Jews did not get Red Cross packages. Would you believe\nthat? This is from Switzerland, the Red Cross. They knew about it. Now we had \u2014\nis \u2014 what was a Red Cross package\u2019? Was a piece of chocolate, maybe a couple of\ncigarettes, a\u2014 some fruit or sa \u2014 some cake or cookies, whatever it was, it was a\nMay 20, 2009\npackage. But that was a \u2014 if you would give me a million dollars, and you would\nask me, what do you want, the Red Cross package, or you want the million dollars?\nI wouldn\u2019t take the million dollars, because you \u2014 you couldn\u2019t do anything with a\nmillion dollars there.",
        "A: The piece of bread was the million dollars, because you knew that you\u2019re gonna\nsurvive another day, because you have enough to eat.",
        "A: Everybody except Jews.",
        "A: Okay, the Red Cross gave them to the Germans.",
        "A: And they came with the trucks, and they came in, because in some of the places\nthere were Jews mixed in with the Lithuanians also.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: So the Jews had to go this way, and they \u2014 only Ukraines could come, and rush \u2014\nthere were Russians also in the concentration camp; they got a package, but not the\nJews.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, they \u2014 they knew quite well what was going on. They \u2014 believe\nme, if they would have wanted to give Jews the \u2014 the Red Cross packages, they\nwould have gotten it too, but they didn\u2019t care. They were the Red Cross only for the\nworld to, you know \u2014 as I said, here is the crematoriums, and here was playing the\nmusic. You mean to tell me they didn\u2019t know? They knew what was going on in th\n\u2014 over there in the crematoriums.",
        "A: I-I \u2014 that, I cannot tell you that, because it \u2014 we couldn\u2019t even communicate with\nthem, or something, tell them, because we were afraid. If you were \u2014 say that \u2014 how\nthe Germans treat you, that\u2019s it, you wouldn\u2019t survive. A-As soon as they \u2014 they\nleave, they \u2014 they take care of you for good. Very famous for that. As a matter of\nfact, when I was working outside, we had to, you know, we plant a little flowers\nthere, and fa \u2014 to make \u2014 make believe, to show the world that \u2014 how nice the\nconcentration camp looks.",
        "A: But they told me what to do, I had to do it. I seen some Arab \u2014 Arabs, you know,\nwith the \u2014 with the [indecipherable] like the Arabs dress with the togas and\neverything, with those long dresses. There was maybe half a dozen of them, you\nknow. I didn\u2019t know who those Arabs were, but I \u2014 I knew that it must be Arabs,\nbecause I see wit the \u2014 the dress, I knew the ho \u2014 the Arab dress with the ki-ki \u2014\npeyah(ph), or whatever they call it.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: This was the mufti from Jerusalem.",
        "A: He was a friend of Hitler. He went to Berlin, and asked Hitler to build\ncrematoriums in Israel. That time it wasn\u2019t Israel, it was pales \u2014 Palestine, because\nhe also wanted to annihilate the Jews, because they wanted to take over a-al-all \u2014 all\nIsrael that ti \u2014 all the \u2014 the ho \u2014 how did I find \u2014 that \u2014 ho-how did I find out? When\nI was liberated after the war \u2014 you know, I lived in Germany \u2014 ow \u2014 I came to this\ncountry in 1950, and I was liberated in 1945, so around five years I lived in\nGermany. So | used to, you know, I used to in the morning, used to get up, used to\nget the newspapers. I take a look, there was a picture from \u2014 from those guys, in SS\nMay 20, 2009\nin Auschwitz, inspecting. And then a-all the whole story, that the mufti ran to\nBerlin from there and asked Hitler to build crematoriums to \u2014 to kill Jews and \u2014 an-\nand things in \u2014 in \u2014 in Israel. Or Palestine in those days. So that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 I\nstill remember that. Okay, from there, now a \u2014 it came to a point that everybody\nwanted to get out from Auschwitz, from Birkenau, because to see that\ncrematorium, every time you looked at it, it reminded you of death. So we said, oh,\nas soon as you can, just get out from there, get out from there. Now, I made friends,\nwe were three kids, we were holding like in a group, because sometimes you had to\nbe protected from other people. Because sometimes you had a piece of bread, they \u2014\nthey could rip it out from your hands even, sometime. No, you can\u2019t blame people,\nthey didn\u2019t have no control. Some people had a lot of control. Let\u2019s take, for\ninstance myself. I wouldn\u2019t pick up something from the garbage that\u2019s \u2014 was ra \u2014\nhalf rotten, something, I wouldn\u2019t pick it up, I would leave it. Some people didn\u2019t\ncare, they \u2014 they took it and \u2014 or \u2014 or not only that, a lot of times people \u2014 the dead\nbodies, they used to throw them out by the door, and there was people that used to\npick them up and bring them to the crematorium. But this 1s already not in\nAuschwitz. From there, from Auschwitz, we went to Birkenau \u2014 to Chebene(ph)\nTrzebinia \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Trzebinia. There was an oil refinery, and \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, we moved \u2014",
        "A: You see, Auschwitz was like in the center, and around Auschwitz was different\nconcentration camps. Kat \u2014 Auschwitz, Katowice, Monowice, Buna, Trzebinia.\nAnd let\u2019s say ich \u2014 they needed workers, they called up Auschwitz, and Auschwitz\nsupplied them the workers.",
        "A: Tribi \u2014 yeah, Trzebinia was a concentration camp, we worked in a oil refinery.",
        "A: See, the \u2014 the Germans used to bring in from rome \u2014 from Romanian oil, and\nthey used to refine it for the airplanes to fly, because you know, the airplane needs \u2014\nyou cannot use for airplanes the same oil what\u2019s used for a car \u2014 the same gasoline,\nit had to be very fine oil refined. So we used to work in the refinery. But I\u20191l tell\nyou, the \u2014 we worked there, but every morning, every morning when the skies were\nclean, you knew that \u2014 that the planes will come and bomb th-the refinery.",
        "A: British and American planes.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Now, a lot of times I was standing outside, when I looked up I could tell you the\nserial number, that\u2019s how low they were flying. And they were flying straight across\nthe crematoriums. You know why I\u2019m saying that?",
        "A: They were flying straight across the crematoriums? Because they \u2014 they asked\nthe British, because when they used to go on missions, let\u2019s say to bomb in\nRomania and things like this, and they flew through Auschwitz, they always used\nto come back with \u2014 with \u2014 with bombs. They said, why don\u2019t you bomb the\ncrematorium? They begged the British. They said, we cannot interfere with the war\nefforts, because this takes too much time. Baloney! They were flying \u2014 this was the\ncrematoriums, they were flying straight through the cremator \u2014 only had to open the\ncockpit and drop a couple of bombs a-and annihilate the crematoriums.",
        "A: They told them, don\u2019t worry, even if you kill inmates or not, they \u2014 most of them\ni\u2014a lot of people were got killed either way, one way or another. The transports\nused to come in every day. So 1-1f they wouldn\u2019t have the crematoriums, they\ncouldn \u2014 they couldn\u2019t annihilate so many people in a \u2014 in a day.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: It wa \u2014 would be a harder task for them to do. But like this it was a killing\nmachine, it was a \u2014 everything was going automatically like \u2014 like today the\ncomputers with push button, everything was going there. So they \u2014 but the British\nwouldn\u2019t do it. So that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s another story. They \u2014 they \u2014 they could tell the\nworld that it was too much to fly \u2014 to go over there, to fl\u2014 to go t\u2014 and bomb the\ncrematoriums, but they didn\u2019t have to go there, they were flying through anyway.",
        "A: No, they used to go out further \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 further out and bi \u2014 I don\u2019t know, military places \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t know exactly what they did, what their mission were. But they used to\nfly through Auschwitz every day, if it was a nice day. So that\u2019s \u2014 they were lying to\nthe world because they flew \u2014 because they said, it takes too much to go to\nAuschwitz with \u2014 to fly \u2014 but they were going through anyway. All they had to do \u2014\nand they would beg them. Then they had, oh, we would have killed a lot of innocent\npeople. They said, don\u2019t worry about tha \u2014 killing innocent people. If \u2014 1f you were\ngonna bomb those crematoriums, less people will die.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: It was already \u2014 that was already in \u201844, so the Germans knew already that they\ngetting \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 not gonna \u2014 bec-became a world power, because they were used to saying\n[sings in German] Well, today belongs germ \u2014 German to us, and tomorrow the\nwhole world is gonna belong \u2014 that\u2019s what they used to sing.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, when I was already \u2014 that \u2014 when we left Auschwitz I was \u2014 that \u2014 that\ntime, that must have been July, aug \u2014 July, August, something like that. Now we\nwere there July, August, September, October, November, December, January the\n17\" we left, because the Russians came already, very, very, very close.",
        "A: Right.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: So \u2014 but, Pll tell you one more thing that \u2014 what happened in between. One day,\nit was \u2014 I remember it was very, very, very cold, it could be like November,\nDecember, you know, in Poland it\u2019s very cold and very harsh [indecipherable].\nOne kid got lost, because where we \u2014 when we went to work they counted us, and\nwhen we came in they counted us, in order to know if somebody did \u2014 ran away or\nsomething. They always watch from \u2014 from the guards, you know, we always\nsurrounded by guards.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: In Trzebinia \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, in Trzebinia. So, it was \u2014 usually, we used to go home like six,\nsometimes 5:30, it was already nice and dark. But one is missing. So, we were\nstanding there and then come \u2014 they called up the headquarters for \u2014 and from \u2014 in\nthe camp, and the \u2014 the main guy, he was a obersturmfuehrer, in German that\u2019s \u2014\nwas his rank. I don\u2019t know whether it was like a major, hul \u2014 I don\u2019t remember\nexactly \u2014",
        "A: Right, higher up. He was the top guys, and he came running with the motorcycle.\nAnd it was also snowing, you know, it was cold. Now you walked in the\n[crunching noise] the snow was breaking under your feet. And the wind was\nblowing, and we were standing there and we jumping up and down, because you\nhad to do something, otherwise \u2014 so what happened, we were standing at least two,\nthree hours outside, and it \u2014 he said, if you can \u2014 not gonna find this guy, you\u2019re\ngonna stay til in the morning, and we have to find the guy. So what happened, the\nguy went in the bathroom, fall asleep in the bathroom. He was so weak, he fall\nasleep. They did \u2014 luckily they didn\u2019t touch him even, because when they took him\nout, he wa \u2014 he hardly \u2014 he couldn\u2019t even walk. They had to shu \u2014 drag him to \u2014 to\nwalk so \u2014",
        "A: No, no we were there \u2014 we were all \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we went to look all over, because there was those big tanks, you know. And\nsomebody went into the bathroom, he had to make a pee or whatever, so he fou \u2014 he\nwas sleeping on \u2014 on the thing. He fall asleep. He was so weak, you know, he fall\nasleep. So that was a night t-to remember. And then 1945, as I said, January 17, we\nleft Trzebinia. That was the death mar \u2014 they call it the death march.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: In oil refinery?",
        "A: Okay. That\u2019s a good question, which I missed. Number one, the water level in\nTrzebinia was very high, like Florida. You dig a little bit, you hit water, right?",
        "A: Right, no basement, that\u2019s correct. Over there it was also, the water level was\nhigh, so they had pipes that runs, you know, t-to \u2014 the control there was heated\npipes for the oil, they needed so \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly. Because when I came\nalready, the oil refinery didn\u2019t work. They put up a wi \u2014 a-a-after that they came\nalmost every day, as I said, when the skies were nice and clear, planes would come,\nor Americans, or \u2014 or British, they used to come to bomb everything. When they\nleft, we had to clean up again. That\u2019s what we did always, clean up, build up a wall,\nthey came and smashed it again. So there was not \u2014 no production. But they still did\n\u2014 the Germans still the last moment, didn\u2019t give up. So what we had to take \u2014 yeah,\nin the wintertime was very cold, so they had to take the pipes and go down another\ncouple of feet, about six feet. The pipes had to be lowered down into the ground. So\nMay 20, 2009\nwhen we used to dig up, the water used to come right away. So there was a pump \u2014\na pump, and one side was a guy, a kid and me, and we were going up and down like\nthis, and pump the water, that\u2019s what we did the whole day, up and down, up and\ndown, til they changed us and some other kids came that also do work.",
        "A: Well, ba \u2014 the food over there, they used to give you a lunch, soup, and in the\nmorning was coffee and they give you a piece of bread with a piece of cheese or\nmeat, whatever. And at night they give you a soup again. So, is manageable. But\nthat\u2019s what I said, I never liked to change. Because some people used to change for\na cigarette, you know? I said no, I\u2019m not changing, I\u2019m not doing anything, and\nthat\u2019s what it was. But, there was an advantage to work with those pumps. You\nknow why? Because pa \u2014 people went to work in something, they see a little kid, 12\nyears old, wo \u2014 you know, skinny, bones, so you could count the bones, so they\nused to throw him a sandwich, or they used to throw him a piece of bread or an\napple. One day, I-I was \u2014 I was working and a guy, a farmer, he wa \u2014 he was \u2014 had\nthe little wagon with two wheels and one horse. And he seen me, he had cabbage on\nthe \u2014 on the wagon, he threw me a cabbage.",
        "A: Yeah \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 it must be a Polish farmer, but you know, he\u2019s \u2014 he watch, you know, what he\nshould see, he throw a cabbage. Okay. I took that cabbage, I almost died from that\ncabbage, cause you know, your stomach is very weak. And I \u2014 but I had \u2014 we were\nthree kids, and we had a deal between us. If you go to work and you get a piece of\nbread, we divide it in three pieces. I got my third, I gave to other kid and the other\nkid. And he got something, we were all together all the time, til liberation we were\ntogether.",
        "A: Some other kids seen that we get along so good, they also tried \u2014 tried the same\nthing, but it didn\u2019t work. Because if you are not honest \u2014 like one kid is \u2014 we came\nhome, there were the three, he says, oh I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn't \u2014 today I didn't get\nanything. The other kids says oh, he is lying, I seen him, he got a piece of bread.\nThat\u2019s it. That was finished. So they couldn\u2019t trust [indecipherable] us, til the last\nmoment we were together, because we were honest to one another.",
        "A: No, I met them in the camp, in the camp.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Okay, one was from England, one was \u2014 and two were from Poland. Now, from\nEngland, how did he get into \u2014 to this business, in the concentration camp? He\nwent for a wedding, he had an aunt, or somebody got married. So he went to the\nwedding, but the Germans wouldn\u2019t \u2014 they caught him, and that\u2019s it. It just\nhappened the Germans took over. He came in, but he couldn\u2019t get out no more. So\nthey put him in concentration camp. So when we were liberated, he spoke fluently\nEnglish, because he was born in England. But right away, soon after \u2014 after\nliberation, he went to the British embassy and they took him right away, took him\nback home. So that was after liberation already. That \u2014 well, I'll come to the\nliberation, I\u2019m gonna tell you more in details. Now, okay, so now we were on the\ndeath march, they used to call it. As we were marching \u2014 was also, January 17 in\nPoland is very, very, very cold. Very cold. And there was twin brothers, two twins.\nI mean, two kids.",
        "A: Twin \u2014 yeah, twins. And one had an infection o-on his foot, and he couldn\u2019t\nwalk. So they dragged him, he dragged him, but then finally he says, it\u2019s no way, no\nway, I can\u2019t even pick my foot up, never mind walking. So he sit down, and the guy\nMay 20, 2009\nwas a Romanian guard. This guy must have been six feet tall a ver \u2014 tall \u2014 very tall\nguy. In other words, he wasn\u2019t walking straight, he was walking like this, bent, and\nhe more than six feet. He says, why don\u2019t you walk? So the boy says, I can\u2019t walk.\nHe took the gun, shoot him right there. You, the brother. He says, I\u2019m not gonna\nleave my brother. Shoot him too. So that\u2019s the reason they call it death march, it\nwas not only one incident, was a lot of incidents, because they call it death march.",
        "A: As we were walking \u2014 we were walking towards Gliwice, there was a \u2014 a big\nstation, you know, where the trains were going all over \u2014 all over Europe from the\n\u2014 from that place we had to walk towards Gliwice.",
        "A: Okay, w-w-we \u2014 we left at night Trzebinia, we walked the whole night, and we\nwalked maybe a half a day, but 1-in between you were resting, you know. Let\u2019s say\nit came to \u2014 at one point they says, okay, and we \u2014 we had to go in the field,\nbecause the German, the army had always the right of way. Whatever they \u2014 if they\ncame, we had to move to the thing. So mostly w-we were standing in the fields, and\nwalking til they \u2014 they cleared for us the road. When they are finished, then we\nstarted to walk, so we have to wait. So 1-1t \u2014 I think it was a night and a day,\nsomething like that, til we a \u2014 we arrived already to Gliwice.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: We were \u2014 yeah, li-listen to this, what happened. So then it was \u2014 maybe it was\n12 o\u2019clock or one o\u2019clock at night, and the Germans said okay, we go to this field\nhere, you could lay down and you could take a nap, and we gonna walk in the\nmorning, continue walking in the morning. But we were there maybe a half an hour,\nor maybe an hour tops, they said you cannot stay, we have to go \u2014 because we heard\nalready the shots from the \u2014 from the Russians. The cannons and machine gun, you\ncould hear already they were shooting from far away. But in between, I had \u2014 he\nwasn\u2019t my friend, but I knew him fo-for \u2014 because we were together in Auschwitz\nand then we came to Trzebinia, so I knew \u2014 I knew the kid. He was an \u2014 he was a\nlittle bit older than me, he must have been 15 - 16 - 17, I don\u2019t know exactly, but\nsomething in that age. And he says he\u2019s gonna lay down.

I don\u2019t care, he says, no more. I says \u2014 he\nlay down. I ran to my kids and I told them, and then we to-took some other kids, we\ngrabbed him and we says, you not gonna lay \u2014 you not gonna lay down here,\nbecause you gonna be liberated, and believe me, the guy was liberated and he wa \u2014\njust lay down, and we \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t \u2014 he says, if you gonna lay down on, we\nMay 20, 2009\ngonna \u2014 we gonna hit you. Don\u2019t lay down, because you gonna lay down you know\nwhat, you never gonna get up. As soon as we had that fight, suddenly the Germans\nsaid, we have to leave right away. So we marched further. He couldn\u2019t lay down no\nmore.",
        "A: And \u2014 but we did something else. We, let\u2019s say three or four \u2014 four guys, or five\nguys, in the middle, we exchanged. The middle guy was able to walk and sleep, and\nwe were holding like together, you know, and then we exchanged. And then, let\u2019s\nsay you were next, you went in the middle, and the other guy, that\u2019s how, you\nknow, we exchanged to sleep a little bit. You could close your eyes and relax a little\nbit.",
        "A: Well, til \u2014 til in \u2014 til in the morning, til you know, til we could \u2014 by then we\nstopped already, in the morning we stopped, and yeah, in between, that\u2019s very\nimportant. There was, in the gutter, you know there was on s \u2014 this gutter on this\nside, and the middle was the road. I see from far away, I see a big coat laying on the\nfloor, a heavy coat, a winter coat. I says to myself, I\u2019m gonna pick up that coat.\nMust be a big guy who had that coat, you know, a big, heavy coat. My friend said,\nare you crazy, you're gonna schlep this coat? But you \u2014 you hardly could walk\nMay 20, 2009\nalready and everybody could run, you gonna schlep that big coat? I said, that coat is\ngonna be a lifesaver, remember. And I wouldn't give it up. I said, I\u2019m gonna take.\nYou don\u2019t have to ca \u2014 if you want to carry it, fine. You don\u2019t want to carry it, ?'m\ngonna carry it all the \u2014 but th-they helped me out, they \u2014 because we three were\ntogether. What wer \u2014 one did \u2014 had, the other wouldn\u2019t let us down, you see.",
        "A: Was laying on the lo \u2014 somebody throw it away, I don\u2019t know, was a good,\nheavy coat, really, was this thick of a coat. And 1t was warm, and \u2014",
        "A: But listen \u2014 listen, this coat saved our lives. So when we arrived to Gliwice, the\nGermans put us on \u2014 on open wagons, railroad, you know, cars. No \u2014 no roof on\ntop.",
        "A: Nothing, no \u2014",
        "A: Nothing. Nothing. Like a \u2014 your car hasn\u2019t got no roof? Same thing, the railroad\nhas no \u2014 no roof. And the snow was this high up inside. So how could we lay down?\nSo the German says, take with the hand, shovel out the snow. With the hand. We\ndidn't have no shovels. We had to do, because you know, otherwise, lay down in the\nMay 20, 2009\nsnow. Well, I want to tell you something, that the \u2014 the death march wasn\u2019t as bad\nas the [indecipherable] march, because we \u2014 when they put us on those o-open\nwagons \u2014 when the train was standing was not so bad yet, you know, but when that\ntrain started to roll, and s \u2014 I don\u2019t know how fast that train was going, at least I \u2014\nI\u2019m sure, 40 - 50 miles, and that wind was so strong, you know, that you c \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t breathe sometimes. And in the morning when we got up, more than half of\nthe \u2014 of those people were dead. They \u2014 they \u2014 they died, what do you call that,\nfrom \u2014",
        "A: No \u2014 that was worse, worse than frostbite. There \u2014 there\u2019s a special name, I \u2014",
        "A: Hypothermia.",
        "A: They died from hypo \u2014 they went to sleep, never got up. So now, with all those\nbodies, they said, just throw them out. The train was moving, we just throw out,\nbecause they running. From Poland they \u2014 we were going towards Germany at this\ntime. So \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Oh, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 there was march from \u2014 from different camps also,\nthey \u2014 we got together, you know.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, but it was in the thousands, I think. I don\u2019t \u2014 I cannot give\nyou a number, because I didn\u2019t know th \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 a lot of people were ta \u2014 were walking. But as I said, the train ride was worse\nthan the march. More people died on the trains than on the march from\nhypothermia. Now here comes that coat that I br \u2014 brought. We\u2019re three small kids\n\u2014 comparing to other people, you know. I \u2014 we put down the thing, we covered\nourself up with that coat. We\u2019re sitting on the snow, still we\u2019re frozen sitting, but at\nleast the wind \u2014 the wind killed those people. The wind was so cold that they died\nof hypothermia. And then we just had to throw out the bodies, and \u2014 so finally, from\nthere, from \u2014 after r-riding on \u2014 yeah, and there was \u2014 see, the Germans, they \u2014 they\nhad a canteen, you know, they get some food, whatever they got, I don\u2019t know, but\nwe didn\u2019t get anything. And when the train stopped to let us o \u2014 beca \u2014 there\u2019s\ncertain points the train stopped, so we had to go to the bathroom or something. But\nif not, you s \u2014 you could do it on the train, we were ki \u2014 it didn\u2019t bother \u2014 nobody\nbot \u2014 would bother you if you did it. And sometimes you hadn\u2019t got no choice. You\nMay 20, 2009\nhad to do what you have to do. Nature doesn\u2019t ask questions. You have to run, you\nhave to run. So, after that, we came to \u2014 we went to Oranienburg. Sachsenhausen,\nOranienburg [indecipherable] Berlin. So, we stood there for \u2014 for about a week\nor two, but then they had to ship us further, so we wind up in Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: Tha \u2014 those \u2014 the camp.",
        "A: And a \u2014 it was a la\u2014 a camp.",
        "A: Yeah, we had barracks \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 barrack \u2014 at least it was nice and warm there. We \u2014 we recuperated a little bit\nfrom all that cold, you know? And they give us some food there, so it \u2014 1t was \u2014 it\nwasn\u2019t so bad. You could \u2014 we could survive there already. So this \u2014",
        "A: No, no, that was really the wa \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the \u2014 the Germans knew that they lost.",
        "A: You know, it was towards the end of the \u2014 close to the end of the war. Because I\nwas liberated in April 28\". So, we left from there the 17\" January. So January \u2014\nJanuary, February, March, April. So, we were already close to \u2014 January, fe \u2014 end\nof February, be \u2014 like beginning of March.",
        "A: Then they send us to Bergen-Belsen. If I see never \u2014 you know, sometimes you\nask people, how long were you in the camp? Some guys, oh, I\u2019m fa \u2014 I was five\nyears in the camp. Then I ask somebody, how long were you? Oh, I was a year or\ntwo years, whatever it is, but Ill tell you one thing, when we arrived to Bergen-\nBelsen \u2014 here is the story: I a \u2014 we arrived there, it was already like, I don\u2019t know\nexactly, but around four, five o\u2019clock. First of all, we came into a barrack, no \u2014 no\nbeds, no bunk beds, nothing. Wherever you are, s-say tha \u2014 I \u2014 it just happened I\nwas in the \u2014 in the corridor like here in \u2014 1n \u2014 in th \u2014 in the front, I lay down there.\nAnd there was not far, the bathroom was also a little further. One pipe busted, and I\ngot up in the morning, oh everybody was wake up all wet. Now imagine, cold, wet\n\u2014 [phone ringing]",
        "A: Oh, Bergen-Belsen.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no, the pipe busted from the \u2014 from the \u2014 it was so cold, froze. It froze,\nthe pipe froze \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and it \u2014 it start shooting out the thing, but I was sleeping, I didn\u2019t know. And\nwhen I woke up, I was so tired, knocked out, that nothing bothered me. I lay down\non the cement, believe me, I slept better than I sleep in 1n a nice bed here in my\nhouse, over there, that\u2019s how tired you were. On the cement. Didn\u2019t mean anything.",
        "A: From a toilet. I da\u2014 I\u2014 I cannot tell you. I know it was wet, and it smelled also.",
        "A: Whatever it is. I was used to those things. It didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t even bother me that \u2014\nbut alright, I felt the wet. So, after a couple of hours it dried out and you wen \u2014 you\nwere back in business. In the morning, a kapo \u2014 kapo means like an overseer that\nwas \u2014 usually the kapos mean that, from the group of people they choosed out, and\nthey were cooperating most with the Germans too, you know. So he came with \u2014\nMay 20, 2009\nwith two Germans, and they had guns, those big guns, you know. And \u2014-ari\u2014I\nmean a rifle, they call it a rifle here. And they said, we need s \u2014 we need about 15 -\n20 people, and you gonna get good food, and we need volunteers. So they said good\nfood, I says, oh my God, I\u2019m \u2014 I was really hungry, you know, hungry, wet and then\nthirsty, you name it, anything. So I said okay, I\u2019m going, too.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: M-My \u2014 one \u2014 from my friends, we got divided for awhile, beca \u2014 we got\ntogether on the next camps. We met up in another camp. Because sometimes you\nwere standing, and they said, here is cut off, and that\u2019s it, you couldn\u2019t go back no\nmore. But 1\u2014 when I came to aux \u2014 all right, I\u2019m coming soon ri \u2014 to the next camp.\nSo, we were march \u2014 Bergen-Belsen was a long camp. And over there there were\nwomen and children and men together. See, in Auschwitz, the \u2014 each female was\nseparately, men was separately, children were separate \u2014 children from 12 an-and\nup to 15 or something like that. Here was everything mixed in together. How did I\nknow? Because we walked \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 it was quite a walk. I don\u2019t know in\nmile how much it was, a quarter, or a half a mile or something like that. And we\ncame to a barrack, and there was a big grave dug outside. Big, you know, with the\nMay 20, 2009\nbulldozer it was dug. And then they went and opened up the door from the \u2014 from\nthe barrack. Bodies from the top to the ceiling. Women, children, men, everything,\ndead bodies. We had to drag out those bodies and throw them in that \u2014 in that \u2014 to\nthe \u2014 in the \u2014 that grave. And as soon as they opened up, the stink was so bad that, I\ndidn\u2019t have what to vomit, but I just \u2014 it came like vomiting. It was \u2014 the stink was\nso bad, it\u2019s yust \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 those bodies were rotten already there. And\nthey didn\u2019t give you no gloves, no mask, nothing with you. And a lot of times you\npulled a hand, and the hand remained in your hand. So, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\nunbelievable [indecipherable]. And what \u2014 what do you think they gave us to eat?\nBig nothing. We went back, when we came to the c \u2014 back to the original thing, to\nthe barracks, we had s \u2014 they gave us a little soup, and that\u2019s about it. And then they\nhad the nerve to come and say we need more volunteers. You know what I did? I ra\n\u2014 hide myself under \u2014 under the barracks. You know, there\u2019s a empty space, like\nthis?",
        "A: I crawled in, myself with another guy. We said, oh I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not going if\nthey give me the best food on the world. Because wa \u2014 that stink was bad, and those\nbodies \u2014 I mean, the bodies didn\u2019t bother me already because you seen at the \u2014 you\nseen it all the time. So, I says no, they not gonna get me no more there. In Bergen-\nMay 20, 2009\nBelsen, we were a short time. I don\u2019t know, maybe a week? Tops, two weeks, or 10\ndays, I really do \u2014 honestly don\u2019t remember exactly how many days. From there we\nwent to Horgau, Augsburg. Augsburg was Messerschmitt, we work for the air \u2014\nby airplanes, you know, wa \u2014 in parts. Let\u2019s say they give you a part, and y \u2014 there\nwas marked here and here a couple of marks, and you had to drill those holes. Now\nhere already was a different \u2014 h-here already you were a \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in th\u2014in\nHorgau, I don\u2019t know, I think there was, for prisoners, used to be there before,\nprisoners, like soldiers, maybe British, who knows? I don\u2019t know what kind of briti\n\u2014 prisoners. At least we got \u2014 we got already \u2014 there was bunk beds, you know, and\nthey give you some food rela \u2014 but then everyday \u2014 and that\u2019s where I met my two\nfriends.",
        "A: They were already there, inside. So right away I s \u2014 I came in and I was ready \u2014\nthey already knew whats was going on because instead of going to Bergen-Belsen\nthey went straight, they didn\u2019t make Bergen-Belsen, which, believe me, thanks God\nthey didn\u2019t.",
        "A: But there\u2019s \u2014 that was the worst camp. There\u2019s no way that a man could survive\nthere, never mind a year, but even months he couldn\u2019t survive that.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Well, this barrack where I went, there, the whole barrack went there.",
        "A: From Bergen-Belsen to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014to Horgau. Now Horgau, we \u2014 we slept there and we were \u2014 train took us\nevery day to \u2014 to Augsburg was the Messerschmitt. But what we did, 12 o\u2019clock\ntil one o\u2019clock, the guard that used to guard us inside there, they used to go for \u2014 for\nlunch. So, he was a \u2014 was a wooden wall fr-from boards, you know\u201d?",
        "A: So what we did, we \u2014 in \u2014 in the other s \u2014 on the other side, let\u2019s say this was the\n\u2014 the wall.",
        "A: On this side we used to work, 1n \u2014 in this side they used to keep the parts. Raw\nparts or finish parts. On the bottom, used to pull away a \u2014 a board and used to climb\nin, and they took out the finish parts and put back the raw parts. Because we knew\nthe Germans, they were \u2014 they come back, they come back one o\u2019clock, so we knew\nthat nobody was watching us, so we could do this. So we made like a sabotage, you\nMay 20, 2009\nknow? Not to be \u2014 so instead, let\u2019s say they give you 50 parts to make those holes,\nso you put back 30 or 40 parts, and we took already made 40 - 50 parts. Because if\nyou didn\u2019t make your quota, you didn\u2019t get to eat. That was their \u2014 their motive.",
        "A: So, but we fool them, and it was going on \u2014 but we weren\u2019t there in Augsburg\neither, too long. So \u2014",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t know. There were so many parts there, so they didn't\nknow if I took in, or took out, or whatever I did, we made believe, we put the same\nthing wer \u2014 they put there th-the raw \u2014 the unfinished parts, we put in the same\nplace, and then we took off the \u2014 from \u2014 there was, in the thousands and thousands\nof parts that they di \u2014 they couldn\u2019t know. If they would have caught you in the\nmiddle, you would have had a big problem.",
        "A: On-Only in the lunch [indecipherable] but we had to work very fast. And then\nwe \u2014 we came is \u2014 so he gave you a little paper that you finish your quota, for in the\nparts, and you got a\u2014 a\u2014a meal. The \u2014 the \u2014 the meal was \u2014 was pretty good, I\nmean, co-comparing to concentration camp meal, was \u2014 was not bad.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: We used to get horsemeat sometimes. The horsemeat tastes very good, sweet, or\nthey gave us soup. In the soup a little horsemeat, or things like that, or sometimes\nthey give you a cheese, or \u2014 they call it Blutwurst, you know, in German. Blutwur\n\u2014 you know what wurst is? Like salami with blood mixed into it, the \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 if they were to give us dog meat, or \u2014 or rat meat, or who knows what, they \u2014\nyou had to eat it, because you didn\u2019t have anything else. You had to eat what they\ngave it to you.",
        "A: There\u2019s no such a thing. No such a thing. You couldn\u2019t do anything there. Well\nanyway, one day they decided \u2014 now I\u2019m coming already, this was already to \u2014\ntowards the end.",
        "A: It must be an end \u2014 like in middle April already, something like that. We were s\n\u2014 they told us that we have to go to Dachau, because here in Augsburg we cannot\nMay 20, 2009\nstay no more, we have to go to Dachau. Dachau had a concentration camp,\nDachau had the crematorium. And, what we find out is, they di \u2014 wanted to\nannihilate all the people, and the last time that \u2014 because we knew all what was \u2014\nwas going on, and they knew that the Americans were very \u2014 coming close, because\nwe \u2014 I was liberated from Americans. Some people were liberated from Russians,\nsome people were liberated from British, but I was liberated from the Americans.\nSo, next day they give an extra portion, because they had some leftover, whatever it\nis, and we are going towards Dachau.",
        "A: Walk, walk, walk.",

Anyway, the next night,\nwe Slept no more in a farm, but we slept \u2014 it was a field like this, and going up the\nMay 20, 2009\nmountain, up. So we were up between the wood, and the Germans had their kitchen\ncanteen on \u2014 on the \u2014 on the field. So here was the f \u2014 the field, and here was going\nup to the mountain, and there was the woods, inside. It was still snow. In April, in\nBavaria in the mountain, was still \u2014 still quite cold. So, we lay down, I still had that\ncoat. The coat \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we never got rid of that coat til liberation. So we put down the coat, we lay\ndown on that coat, we three, and in the morning I heard something, I says, you\nknow, I hear some tanks. You know, when a tank comes towards you, you hear that\nnoise it makes.",
        "A: And I says \u2014 and I take a look, I says, no more \u2014 I see no soldiers, they ran away.",
        "A: Germans, no German soldiers. And they left the horse with the kitchen, 1t was \u2014\nit was like \u2014 I don\u2019t know the distance, like two distance from here to those streets.\nTh \u2014 and that \u2014 that was downstairs was the \u2014 the ke \u2014 that kitchen. And then my\nfriend says, so maybe we should run, go over there. I says, hey, maybe that\u2019s a trap.\nMaybe the Germans are hiding there with the machine guns. They used to do those\nthings, and you start running, then they start sh \u2014 killing you, you know. So let\u2019s\nMay 20, 2009\nwait, let\u2019s wait. And we were waiting til 1t got a little bit light already. And then we\nheard the \u2014 the tanks are coming. But we didn\u2019t know what c \u2014 if 1t\u2019s German tanks\nor \u2014 or American tanks or British, we didn\u2019t know anything about it. Suddenly, you\ncould see the tanks coming towards us [indecipherable]. So one guy, it was \u2014 we\nwere liberated from black soldiers. See, in those days the blacks were separated,\nthey were not together with the white. Was a whole brigade of black soldiers. And\nthey surrounded us, and they said hold it, don\u2019t come towards us. He says, we\ngonna let you know when. And they si \u2014 it wa \u2014 the guy spoke German. And, stay\nthere, he says, we\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s gonna be safe for us, we gonna let you\nknow that you come \u2014 could come forwards. And don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t run, we have\nplenty food for you. They knew that we didn\u2019t have to eat for \u2014 for quite awhile. I\ndon\u2019t know how, but they knew. Americans are not stupid, they knew how we were\ntreated, because they seen what was going on.",
        "A: Not at this point.",
        "A: Th-The guy spoke German. He spoke beautiful German, this guy. And he says,\nwe are here \u2014 we are \u2014 you are liberated, and if \u2014 just stay for awhile, we get the\norder \u2014 because the planes were circling around and told them that the Germans are\nMay 20, 2009\nhere, or hiding there, or hiding there and they used to shoot and kill ger \u2014\nAmericans too yet, in \u2014 in the same time. So they were very careful, you know. So\nthey said, stay there where you staying, do not come forwards, do not come for \u2014 he\n\u2014 he repeated a couple of times, do not come forwards. So finally said, now it\u2019s\nokay, you could come. There was americ \u2014 the am-ambulances, were one or two\nmilitary ambulances, because right away, some people, they couldn\u2019t walk, they\nhave infections, you know, from the walking. As a matter of fact me too, I had a \u2014\nan infection, I went over there. And one guy, the doctor, spoke Yiddish. He was an\nAmerican Jewish guy. So he told me right away, he f\u2014 they took care of me, a-and",
        "A: You see \u2014 no, no, no, no \u2014",
        "A: \u2014no gangrene yet. It was infected, but it was, you know, it didn\u2019t look right, my\nfoot, you see, and I was walking barefoot, dirty, you know, from the wa \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nhave no shoes. I was walking barefoot. Ah, he says, don\u2019t worry about it, you have\nplenty food, we have plenty food for you prepared and don\u2019t worry about it. And\nthen \u2014 as a matter of fact, I went into a \u2014 there was a monastery, all nuns, and they\nMay 20, 2009\nused to take care on the German soldiers, you know, wounded soldiers there. I came\nin, they send me over there and they washed my foot and they treated me \u2014 they\nwere very, very nice lady, all ladies. Th-There \u2014 they\u2019re doctors, everything 1 \u2014 run\nfrom nuns. And I was there about two days.",
        "A: N-N-No, yeah \u2014 well, the doctor took me over there and they said they gonna\ntake care on you. Because they had to go further. You see, they took care on us,\nthey gave us whate \u2014 throwing chocolate and candies and cigarettes, you know. But\nthe real stuff, later on, because the Germans had to take care, they had to feed us,\nthey had to give us rooms where to sleep. So I went for \u2014 for \u2014 I was about two days\nthere with the nuns, and they \u2014 they gave me to eat, whatever \u2014 whatever I wanted,\nand they were very nice. [coughs] Excuse me. They were really very \u2014 treated me\nvery nice. Nuns are nice, you know, they \u2014 they ar \u2014 they were afraid of their own\nsoldiers, of the \u2014 especially of the Gestapo.",
        "A: No, they wer \u2014 they had a hospi \u2014 that was the hospital.",
        "A: Th-They work there in \u2014 in that \u2014 in the \u2014 1n that place, in that hospital. So they\ntook care on the German wounded soldiers. Now, the German soldiers, they were \u2014\nMay 20, 2009\neverybody was running away, they put on civilian [indecipherable] those German\nSS, they took off their uniforms and they put on civilians, because they knew that if\nthey catch you they were \u2014 they were in trouble, you know?",
        "A: No, they run away.",
        "A: And a-as a matter of fact, in the morning when I got up, nobody was there. But\nwe were afraid to walk, because maybe they\u2019re hiding, and they used to do those\nthings, even they used to shoot \u2014 kill American soldiers, too. Like this, put on a\nmachine gun, and zzzzz, you know, killing e \u2014 it wa \u2014 for us, definitely they were\nnot afraid to do it. With the American soldiers, they knew that they had a treaty with\nthe thing, they not \u2014 were not supposed to have prisoners, you know. But for us they\ndid whatever they wanted to do. So that\u2019s where I got liberated, in mickhaus \u2014\nKleynach(ph) Mickhausen, it was the place where I got liberated. From there, 1 \u2014\nthe Jewish doctor gave me a note, he says, go to Augsburg, there\u2019s one Jewish\nsynagogue left in all Augsburg, that \u2014 to show for the world that Hitler wasn\u2019t so\nbad, he left one synagogue, he left in thik \u2014 in \u2014 in thing. He says, I\u2019Il be there too,\nand I\u2019m gonna say hello to you when I\u2019Il come there. And that\u2019s where I met him,\nand \u2014 but then I had already \u2014 I met a German family, because they told you have to\nMay 20, 2009\ngo and they had to give you food, clothing and shelter. And money. That was after\nthe liberation.",
        "A: Yeah, okay, now with my \u2014 my \u2014 we were three together. One kid \u2014 one kid \u2014\nthis \u2014 the guy from England, he went right away to the British embassy. I never\nmet him again, because he took him \u2014 he told me that he\u2019s going straight home to\nBritain. I-I don\u2019t remember, it was some \u2014 near by longam \u2014 Man-Manchester \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 whate \u2014 whatever. That\u2019s was \u2014 was his home. His \u2014 his parents there,\neverybody there.",
        "A: Now, my other \u2014 other friend, he wa \u2014 as soon as he got liberated, he developed\na nervous breakdown. He couldn\u2019t take the liberty. See, you were always under the\ngun, wherever you were walking, so he had a nervous breakdown and he \u2014 he was\nin very bad shape. So the Americans took him, and they took him to a \u2014 to a place\nwhere, you know, to a \u2014 to a hospital to treat him, you know. And also, from \u2014 from\n100\nMay 20, 2009\nthere, he went to Israel. And I never met him again, too. And le \u2014 like this we were.\nThat\u2019s where we broke off and we got divided and \u2014",
        "A: No, for the guy \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the guy who \u2014 who had the nervous breakdown, you couldn\u2019t even come close,\nhe was very wild, you know, he was \u2014 he was \u2014 somehow, he lived in a different\nworld, you know? He thought that the \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014I want to kill him, or \u2014 or \u2014 e-even\nthey had to \u2014 they had to bind his feet and thing when the \u2014 the American MPs, the\nmilitary police came and took him to a hospital, even they were afraid. But they \u2014\nthey, you know, took two or three, they bind him down and put his hands in the\nthing. But he w \u2014 he was \u2014 he was okay after he was treated in \u2014 in these hospitals,\nand from there he went to Israel.",
        "A: No, I never had any contact \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 contact with him. But I heard \u2014 somebody told me that, because his name was\nvudok \u2014 Moishe Vodowsky(ph), I think. W-Was V-Vodowsky(ph),\nVodowsky(ph). And he told me that he went to Israel.\n101May 20, 2009",
        "A: So, right, right. And the other one, I knew that he went home. So he told me that\nhe\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s leaving us, he hugged me, we kissed and he went right away to the\nBritish embassy and they \u2014 they right away said to come and send him home. That\u2019s\nwas end of the story to liberation, so this \u2014 this is it. Now, if you want to ask me any\nquestions, you go ahead.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That is the one. So now, wait a second, now you got \u2014 how \u2014 who got in touch\nwith you, Andrew?",
        "A: Ah, right, right, right, right.",

So right away\nhe asked me, are you Jewish? And then he says, redts(ph) Yiddish? Because he\nspoke Yiddish to me. I didn\u2019t speak a word of English in that time. As a matter of\nfact, when I was liberated from those black guys, I says, my God, those guys must \u2014\nmust be very hot in America, they got all sunburned. I didn\u2019t know that there were\n\u2014 there \u2014 there was black \u2014 honest, that\u2019s the honest truth. I didn\u2019t know there was\nblack guy \u2014 black people. Negroes, you know, I didn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: But oh, they were so nice to us, those people. I remember I was stand, they were\nthrowing us chocolate and bread and all kind of things. And then a German came\nover, he wanted to \u2014 he says \u2014 he took the bread and stepped on it, he says, instead\nof giving it to you, and you disappear from here before I\u2019Il \u2014 he \u2014 he rather \u2014\nstepped on the bread, not to give it to the German, the \u2014 because a lot of people died\nfrom \u2014 from \u2014 Americans, the Germans used to kill Americans too, you know.\nMaybe it was friends that died, or something. So they hated those Germans. So \u2014 so\nnow I know how I \u2014 how you got in touch with me, because he \u2014 he told me if I\nMay 20, 2009\nwant to give a report from the concentration camp. I says okay, I says, so \u2014 so that\u2019s\nhow you got in touch, from that. You know Andrew?",

        "A: No, no, in the army \u2014 he \u2014 he was in air force.",
        "A: Air force, 323, he used to fly those big bombardiers, you know.\n104May 20, 2009",
        "A: And he was, I think it was the navigator or something like that. Oh, he was nice.\nAnd then when I was \u2014 after the liberation, he went in Pansing(ph) airfield, and in\nPansing(ph) airfield, he says, if you want to come \u2014 I had a \u2014 I met another friend,\nhe was in the partisans, also a Jewish guy from Lithuania. So I said, I have another\nfriend with me. He said, okay, don\u2019t worry about it, anybody, just come, bring him.\nAnd we came there on the \u2014 on the base, so he introduced us the hi-hierarch \u2014 high\nofficers there, you know, I don\u2019t know, in those days I didn\u2019t recognize, I think he\nwas like \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 maybe one star general. He was the head from the whole \u2014 from the whole\nairfield there.",
        "A: And they \u2014 oh, they treated us nice there. It\u2019s any time you want to come in, we\nhave \u2014 because 1n those days the officers eat separately, and the men eat \u2014 used to\neat separate. The regular army used to be separate. So we always were, we came,\nwe went there, because he gave us the okay to come and eat with them. So they \u2014\nwe were treated \u2014 y-you couldn\u2019t get better treatment than that. So we were very\nnice. And then the \u2014 so Captain William \u2014 William Fuch \u2014 Wil-William said okay,\n105May 20, 2009\ngo to the Burgermeister. Burgermeister is the mayor. In German, the mayor calls\nthe Burgermeister, you know, from a city, the mayor of the city? So he says, go to\nthem, and tell them that you need a room for \u2014 he should give you a room. And in\ncase he doesn\u2019t want it, he ha \u2014 he knew already that we wouldn\u2019t get it, just come\nback and let me know, because from \u2014 from the mayor to the airfield was 50\nminutes walk, something like that. So we came in, yeah, what can I do for you, he\nsays in ger \u2014 we talking in German to him. Says well, we need a room. Ich habe\nkeiner, I have no rooms for you. Okay. I says \u2014 dav \u2014 David, my friend says, it\u2019s no\nuse to argue with him. Let\u2019s go back to well \u2014 tell him \u2014 to William. So we came\nback, he went and put two guns on his \u2014 an-and with two guns he came in. As soon\nas he seen him, and the Germans, you know, right away he stands in the \u2014 in thing.\nHe says, I want you should give those guys a room. Jawohl, jawohl, jawohl, right\naway \u2014 right away he had the rooms.",
        "A: So -",
        "A: Beg \u2014",
        "A: No, no, with my friend, one room.\n106May 20, 2009",
        "A: But we share \u2014 an-and where the officers used to sleep, and it was a big th \u2014\nthere used to be the \u2014 they ha \u2014 German Air Force used to stay there in those rooms.\nNow there was an extra room there, so he said \u2014 the mayor said, there\u2019s one room\nthere in the officers\u2019 thing. Said okay, that\u2019s good for them. Give \u2014 give them that\nroom. So the well was \u2014 the captain was sleeping in one side, on the other side of\nthe house, and we \u2014 we had the room for ourself 1-in this side of the house. So we\nwere treated there wonderful, very nice. Very nice, I\u2014 so, when I came to America,\nhe came to see me, because I was working in New York in the garment center that\ntime. He took me out for lunch, he gave me 50 dollars.",
        "A: Fifty dollars was a lot of money.",
        "A: Yeah. And then, he invited us to a hou \u2014 to his house in Brooklyn, but he \u2014\nAndrew wasn\u2019t \u2014 was \u2014 wasn\u2019t born yet, because he has two b \u2014 two boys. The\nolder one \u2014 what was the older one\u2019s name? Okay, I have it so \u2014 when we came\nthere he was a baby, a little baby yet. So, he said \u2014",
        "A: Beg your pardon?\n107May 20, 2009",
        "A: This is in 1950.",
        "A: 1950 when I came to America. So anyway, we came to visit and then \u2014 and we\nhad \u2014 th-they invited us for \u2014 for supper or lun \u2014 whatever it is. And then he says to\nus, We are going \u2014 we are going to \u2014 to Switzerland. Because in those days was the\nG.I. quote, you know. The G.I., whoever wanted to star \u2014 to \u2014 to study for higher \u2014\nbecause he was a high school teacher, he wanted to go higher. In the \u2014 the americ \u2014\nthe \u2014 the government paid f\u2014 the G.I. Bill was that time, they called it G.I. Bill, and\nthe government paid for everything. For study, for \u2014 they gave him money, gave\nhim everything, and they send him to Switzerland, to study in Switzerland. So he\nsaid, come next week, and then I'll \u2014 I'll tell you everything exactly what it was.\nWhen we came next week, he was already gone, because they somehow \u2014 they told\nhim \u2014 they \u2014 for \u2014 a couple of days later that they \u2014 he\u2019s gonna have to come, you\nknow, because they were prepared, already packed and everything, but somehow\nthey called him up and he said, you have to leave before. So we were there \u2014 we\ncame there on a Saturday, and he left already on Thursday. So I came there, I knock\nin the door, nobody answers the door, so I go next door. It was an elderly lady\nliving there in \u2014 in \u2014 in the \u2014 in the house. So I says, do you know where the Fuchs\n108\nMay 20, 2009\nare? Dillon Fuch? Oh, they left already. They \u2014 sh-she knew already that they left,\nthey left on Thursday. So, since then we got lost, and I \u2014 and I went \u2014 you know ma\n\u2014 I had another friend who was in the army, that I met, he tried to locate him,\nbecause I knew where he \u2014 nobody knew, nobody, how to get in touch with him,\nand I couldn\u2019t get in touch with him. So, when I moved here down to \u2014 in Coral\nSpring, when I went in the synagogue, there was one guy \u2014 I somehow came out to\ntalk, you know, about my \u2014 my friend, I said, I\u2014 I had a friend, Captain William\nFuchs, you know, and I \u2014 we tried to \u2014 he says, I could find that out for you. He\nsays, give me a couple of days.",
        "A: No, no, no, he \u2014 he was in the army, yeah, but beside, he had \u2014 he knew from the\ncomputers. He says, Pll find him, Pll find him for you. And he came back the next\nweek, he brought me the com \u2014 the went ou \u2014 write-out from the computer, where\nhe was in army, how long, where he lives. But when I f-found \u2014 when I got in touch\nwith the family, cause I had the number, everything was with number, I \u2014 first \u2014 the\nfirst thing I spoke to \u2014 to Andrew. So he says, my mother is in \u2014 in \u2014 in Miami, the\nlive in Miami, and my father died.\n109\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: I was \u2014 I was really heartbroken, because \u2014 and I passed by his house a couple \u2014\nwhen I moved \u2014 I moved down to Miami first. I passed by his house, and I didn\u2019t\nknow that they were living there.",
        "A: He was still alive that time. And he died on \u2014 on his \u2014 he had a stroke. He was\nhandsome, good looking guy, nice, very good, you know. People like \u2014 like him,\nyou \u2014 you seldom find. Very nice guy, very nice guy. So that\u2019s was then, so I invite\n\u2014 invite his wife, came here, Andrew came to my house, we invited him, and the\nother kid lives in California, so I didn\u2019t met the other t \u2014 the oldest son I didn\u2019t \u2014 I\nnever met him.",
        "A: I find out about, I-I-I should say a year ago, something like that.",
        "A: Yeah, not \u2014 not \u2014 not long ago, right, right.",
        "A: No, I was living \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I was living already in Coral Springs, but when I lived in Miami, I used to\npass by their house.\n110May 20, 2009",
        "A: And I didn't know that he \u2014 they are there. I didn\u2019t know because I didn\u2019t \u2014 I\ncouldn\u2019t get in touch. If this guy wouldn\u2019t get me in touch with them \u2014 he got in\ntouch, and my friend, he was in the army, he \u2014 he went to the air force base and give\nthem the thing. I had the number where, you know, 323 [indecipherable] where he\nwas in \u2014 in the \u2014 in that apartment. They couldn\u2019t find him either. And he found\nthem in the computer. I don\u2019t know how he did it, but \u2014",
        "A: So that\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s how I got in touch. So now I know how you come in and\n[indecipherable]. Yeah, that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, would you like first to eat something, or drink [indecipherable] okay?",
        "A: Okay. As a matter of fact, when William came over and he told me that he is\nleaving now back to America, and if I want to go there is a DP camp in\nLandsberg. Panzing is the airfield.

I used \u2014 a-all the \u2014 the whole fur coat, I used to\nknow how to put \u2014 assemble them together. And they paid me for each coat, I think\nit was 50 German marks. It was good money, so in a \u2014 if I could do it in a day, I\ncould make a whole fur coat. Stretch it out, and \u2014 but I didn't have every day a fur\ncoat, but I made two, three fur coats, so it\u2019s another 150 doll \u2014 d-mark(ph), that\nwas already the d-mark(ph), was not the Reichsmark. In the beginning the\nReichsmark didn\u2019t have very little value, but the d-mark(ph) was already \u2014 had a\ngood certain value. So I learned how to do.

So he said, yeah, I could give him a job\nin \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 where I work. Because he was a sa \u2014 a something like foreman. Not\nthe higher foreman, the lower foreman. Oh, I could give him a job in the \u2014 1n the \u2014\nin the garment center. I said, okay. So I said, what \u2014 what do I have to do? Don\u2019t\nworry, tell them that you are a tailor from home.

And they had fun in the back, they were laughing, you know\u201d? I le \u2014 ha \u2014 I\nheard them something, but I didn\u2019t know what was going on there. So the guy says,\nokay, let me see how you do \u2014 do some sewing. So he gives me a thimble, I didn't\nknow where or on what finger to put on even the thimble, never mind to sew.

Be \u2014 I\nknow all about it, what kind of tailor d \u2014 you a-a-are. So I says, yeah, Teddy \u2014 his\n118\nMay 20, 2009\nname was Teddy, the guy who \u2014 who told me I should be \u2014 just tell them that I am\na tailor. But, I worked there for a couple of weeks, and believe me, I produced just\nlike anybody else, I learned very fast.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I \u2014 I wa \u2014 I went and I had the dry cleaning business in \u2014 in New\nYork.",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 with my cousin, together. Box \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, and that\u2019s how I learned \u2014 I learned a lot of things to sew in the \u2014 1n the\nfactory when I used to work, but I worked there for about \u2014 I worked in two\nfactories. One in the beginning factory, and then I left because I got into an\nargument with the \u2014 with this Teddy, because he thought that because he gave me a\njob that he could \u2014 I could lie for him, and I could do all kind of things, which \u2014\nthere was an old lady, also a Holocaust survivor, and he wanted to get rid of her. So\nhe took me as a witness to the big boss there. So, I see he was talking and he\npointing towards me, because they were there \u2014 over there and I see that he points\ntowards me. Finally he comes over with the boss, and the boss was, you know, big\ncigars, you know, all sunburned because he went to Florida for the \u2014 it was in the\n119May 20, 2009\nwintertime. So he says to me, if \u2014 1f I speak Yiddish. I says, I \u2014 I don\u2019t speak no\nEnglish, but I speak Yiddish. So he started to talk to me and then Teddy says, and\nask Saul, he\u2019ll tell you that she doesn\u2019t want to work. I said, hold it, hold it, hold it.\nI \u2014 in front of the boss, I said, that\u2019s not true. I says, she\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s an elderly lady.\nShe was about 45, something like that, but she looked like a hundred. Skinny\n[indecipherable] broken, sick. I says, she tries her best, I says, and she wants to\nwork and she does work. And the boss just looked at him like, you know, when he \u2014\nwhen the boss left, he comes over to me and says, I'll tell you one thing Saul, as\nlong as you gonna work here, you never gonna get a raise, an increase. I says, look,\nI don\u2019t care about your increase and I don\u2019t care about your raise. You think I\u2019m\ngonna squeal on a woman like this? I mean, because you gave me a job, you think\nyou own me? I says, I don\u2019t care, no matter what \u2014 you want me to leave, you could\nthrow me out. I \u2014 I'll leave. I don\u2019t even want to \u2014 I don\u2019t like to say \u2014 and I don\u2019t\nlike you at all when you do the \u2014 you should be ashamed of yourself, I says, you\nwent through a concentration camp, and yo \u2014 that\u2019s how you behave to an old lady\nlike that? She looks old, but she\u2019s 45 something, she\u2019s still a young woman, and\nlook what you want to do to her.",

        "A: The boss was \u2014 this was when the boss left already.",
        "A: He came over to me, and talked to me like this. But anyway, so I worked \u2014 I \u2014 I\nremember I made 75 cents an hour in those days. I made 75 cents, but one day I go\nover th-the boss\u2019s son-in-law, his name was Howard. I says, I\u2019m gonna go and ask\na raise. I wanted a raise of five dollars. So I go over to the boss \u2014 yeah, and I used to\nmake already better garments, you know, and duplicates, you know, samples. And\nthey had to rush them out, sometimes I had to go for lunch, and he says, Saul, can\u2019t\n\u2014 you can\u2019t go because we have to rush out this things because otherwise we\nwouldn\u2019t get the order.",
        "A: So, a lot of times, instead of going 12 o\u2019clock for lunch, I had to go three o\u2019clock\nor 3:30, and I used to get headaches, and things like that. So I go over to him and I\nsays, listen Howard, I would like to ask you for a raise, for five dollars. I\u2019m sorry\nSaul, I can\u2019t give it to you. That\u2019s was Teddy\u2019s work, you know.",
        "A: So I says to him, okay, [Il tell you what, you don\u2019t want to give you a raise,\nthat\u2019s fine. Instead of, put me on \u2014 put me on work \u2014 on piecework like the other\n121May 20, 2009\nguys work. If Pll make hundred dollars or \u2019'Il make 10 dollars, whatever I\u2019Il make,\nwhatever I produce. I knew that I could make much more than 75 cents an hour. No,\nI\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do that because I need you here by this table. You are \u2014 you be\n\u2014 you \u2014 you taught all the \u2014 the garments, the \u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014 you know how to make the\nsamples and prepare them, everything, you know, and I ca \u2014 and I-I need you here\nby this table, I can\u2019t \u2014 all right. So I says, okay, you don\u2019t want to give me a raise,\nyou don\u2019t want to give me piecework and you don\u2019t want to do anything, okay, fine,\nfine. And I had a headache unbelievable. So I\u2019m going down, suddenly, who do you\nthink I meet? I meet a guy from Germany that \u2014 way back from Germany I used to\nknow from the ca \u2014 from the camp, from the concentration camp. Saul! I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it. I went to eat, and he came into the building. He didn't work there, but he\njust happened to pass by. H-He almost cried, and I was crying almost. So he s \u2014 so\nSaul, so wha-what are you doing? Wha \u2014 how \u2014 I says Joe, his name was Joe, in\nJewish his name was Yittel(ph), I says, I have such a strong headache, I hardly\ncould see out of my eyes. So I told him the story, he says, Saul, I have good news\nfor you. I have a partner that I work in \u2014 they work for Hentlie(ph), and this was\nKolmer Marcus, where I worked, it was a cheap line, a cheaper line. Let\u2019s say for a\nlady\u2019s suit over there, 20 - 30 dollars was \u2014 that\u2019s about it. He worked for between\ntwo, three, 400 dollar suits, Hentlie(ph), everything was made by hand.\n122May 20, 2009",
        "A: So I tell him, listen Joe, but you know I ha \u2014 I work in a cheap line, I don\u2019t know\nif I'll be able to work in your place. Saul, don\u2019t worry, you work for me then, you\u2019ll\nbe my partner. And I assure you, you\u2019re gonna make more than \u2014 I made 55 dollars\nwhen I left this \u2014 this \u2014 my place, to come to him. I says, I hope you\u2019re \u2014 so\nanyway, I ran over to my boss, and \u2014 I called up my boss where I worked, because\nhe owed me one week wages yet. I said, oh, I have a very bad cold, and I cannot \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t want \u2014 I was afraid maybe I\u2019m not going to be qualified there, and I didn\u2019t\nwant to lose a job \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because I had the job already, and I made 55 dollars, it\u2019s better than nothing.\nSo, he says Saul, I have lo \u2014 I\u2019m overloaded with work. You better come in as \u2014 I\nsays, as soon as I feel better, I says. And I talk like, you know, I have \u2014 had a cold. I\nworked the first week with my friend, I made 150 dollars.",
        "A: Hundred \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: Piecework, piecework. But I had to do on certain things on a garment, he told\nme, you\u2019re gonna do this part, and I\u2019m gonna do this part. And that\u2019s all you\u2019re\ngonna do. So I had plenty chance to work myself into it, you know? I was very\ngood, this was \u2014 I was \u2014 there was a hard job. It wasn\u2019t so hard, but 1t was a \u2014 how\nshall I say, it was a job, a boarding job. He had crisscross because everything was\nhandmade, so you couldn\u2019t fold it under, you had to flat \u2014 the suit should \u2014 1t was li\n\u2014 you Ss \u2014 wear a Suit like a sweater. It was giving from all the sides. Had no\npaddings, no nothing. That\u2019s why it was so expensive. So I did the \u2014 the little \u2014 little\njobs here \u2014 all over the \u2014 that suit, it was all \u2014 so that was my job, and make the\nbottoms, that was my job. And he put in the linings. And we worked in a team\nunbelievable. Same [indecipherable] like we had the team for the three kids, we\nhad three kids. And then they \u2014 they seen that I do so good with him, they also start\ntogether, but they didn\u2019t \u2014 they \u2014 they worked for awhile, oh, you sit too much on\nthe toilet, you didn't come yesterday. I mean, you know, sometimes you cannot\nmake [indecipherable] you don\u2019t feel good.",
        "A: Or la \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 my friend had to go someplace, he had the sister that was\nsick. I never told him hey, you\u2019re going too much to your sister. He came an hour\nlater, so what, so he came an hour later. Still. So they tried the same way, but it\n124\nMay 20, 2009\ndidn\u2019t work with them, so it\u2019s also fall apart. With me, til the last moment I work\nthere, I worked with my friend, we made good money. I mean, there was times I\nwent home with 200 dollars, in those days it was a fortune of money. Like today a\nthousand dollars almost, for 200 dollars, you sh \u2014 yeah, right.",
        "A: A week, in one week, every week. So then, when I came up to \u2014 to collect my \u2014\nhe owed me a week wages, my boss that \u2014 my ol \u2014 first place. Oh Saul, we are so\nhappy to see you. I take out my envelope and I show him, I says, see what I made\nthis week? I asked you for five dollars, you wouldn\u2019t give it to me. Look what I\nmade. He almost fell down. But one thing he says to me, Saul, any time you need a\njob, if anything should go wrong in your place, or whatever it is, my door will be\nalways open for you.",
        "A: And he said, I apologize, I should have give you that raise, but it was\ninterference here, and I\u2019m sorry what I did, that I didn\u2019t give you the raise. And if\nhe would have give me the raise, I would maybe still sit there in \u2014 in that \u2014",

        "A: So, my cousin \u2014 first I\u2014 I was in the store, I \u2014 because I-I was the \u2014 I knew\nalready [indecipherable] clean, because I took some lessons. I went, there was a \u2014\na school from dry cleaning business. And I was already a licensed dry cleaning\nbusiness, so my cousin didn't know, so I was doing the spotting, and all those\nthings. But my cousin was a presser, because he worked also in the garment center.\nSo \u2014 and I did alterations, we had a \u2014 a tailor also. And my cousin sometimes \u2014 we\n\u2014 the pressers was very bad there, because they were not reliable, they used to come\nin drunk, or they didn't show up, and they\u2019re supposed to be \u2014 let\u2019s say I opened up\nseven o\u2019clock, they\u2019re supposed to be eight o\u2019clock in the \u2014 in the store, they used\nto come in two o\u2019clock, three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I says, why are you coming\n126May 20, 2009\nso late? Oh, you don\u2019t like me? Pay me out. I said, pay me out with what? I don\u2019t\nowe you anything, I paid you \u2014 Saturday I paid you everything to a penny. The guy\ndidn\u2019t have 10 cents to go home with the subway. And ca \u2014 a lot of times they came\nin drunk. I says, no, you cannot work drunk. And one day I was very busy by the\ncounter, a-and my cousin went out to eat lunch \u2014 breakfast, I mean, in the morning,\nand I didn\u2019t see the presser came in, and went straight \u2014 I was so busy in the front\nwith the customers, I didn\u2019t even see when he came in. And he was quite overdosed\nwith \u2014 he drank \u2014 early in the morning already, he was drunk. Suddenly, I hear like\nan explosion. He pulled the pressing machine out from the place, and he busted the\npipe, and the ste \u2014 I thought that like \u2014 like a bomb exploded. He pulled the pressing\nmachine from the wall out. He ma \u2014 he was a very \u2014 we used to call him Herman\nthe bull, he was such a \u2014 he was a big guy, you know, very strong guy. But he\ndidn\u2019t know what he was doing.

So I went, Is \u2014 I gave him a\ndollar, I says, go buy yourself black coffee, and sit dow \u2014 he was a very nice guy.\nOne thing he was nice, but when he was drunk, forget it. He didn\u2019t know what he\nwas doing. And so I said, drink some coffee first, lay down. When you gonna feel\nyou gonna be all right \u2014 I called in right away, because I had insurance.

The \u2014 I remember the first year was pipes busted. The\nfirst year that 1t was in business, I didn't know that pipes were busting from the\nwater line, and shoot up. And suddenly, we put on the steam, and suddenly it starts\nshooting out the steam all over. And you couldn\u2019t get a plumber there like an\nemergenc \u2014 like a doctor was \u2014 in emergency you couldn\u2019t get a plumber. But I\ncalled them up. About in a half an hour they were there and they fixed me up back\nin business. A lot of cleaners, they couldn\u2019t do anything.

Comes end of the month, like \u2014 he says yes, but you see, th-the\nguy ra\u2014 who sold the business, he owes him some money. I says, I don\u2019t know\nwhat the other guy did. I assure you \u2014 and in between the way I\u2019m arguing with\nhim, the landlord comes in. He says, Saul, what\u2019s going on here?

He came, they filled it up, end of the month he sent \u2014 but in between, the\nother guy came also. He wanted to sell me oil. I says, no, thank you very much, I\nsays, I got a guy that I don\u2019t have to pay him cash like you, you remember?",
        "A: With my landlord had to pay you the \u2014 to fill up for the tank, I says. Oh no, he\nsays, oh, I\u2019m gonna give you cheaper. He gave me 10 cents off, he gives me 20\ncent. I says, even if you give it to me for nothing, I says, I deal with this man, and\nthat\u2019s it. I shook hands with him, and that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the contract.

She gave me two dresses, or whatever it was.\nAnd it was on a Friday, and I come in and she says, oh Saul, meet my little niece.\nMy wi-\u2014 I said, oh, this is your little niece? She was \u2014 well, she was 18 years old,\nthat time, 18 or 19 years old, something like that. She was very good looking girl. I\nsaid, oh, this is your little niece?

Not too good, but\n132May 20, 2009\nI could communicate with her, because her mother and parents, they spoke Yiddish,\ntoo, you see. They come from the same place where I come from, from the\nCarpathians. So that\u2019s how I \u2014I\u2014I got very friendly with them, too, because she \u2014\nshe came from Russia.",

So, was \u2014 so anyway, I said Ceil(ph),\nokay, the main thing is you have to learn English. I said, either schools here \u2014 and\nshe picked it up very fast. Picked it up also very fast. So that\u2019s how I met her and I\nwent \u2014 we went out, but see, she had a little problem with 1 \u2014 with old people. If she\nwrote too many letters, you\u2019re spending too much money, you know,\n[indecipherable] look \u2014 if she brushed the teeth, you put too \u2014 too much toothpaste,\nyou know?

Thanks God I make a good living, I\u2019m all right. And I\nthink after \u2014 after a close couple of months, you pass by and there was, on the \u2014 oh,\nI forget this. I\u2019m gonna tell you in a minute, it\u20191l| come back to me. You pass by\n133May 20, 2009\nthere and they were rehearsing a \u2014 a wedding was going on.

Burnside(ph) Avenue, it was on \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Burnside(ph) Avenue, nice place. So in between we went to watch the\nwedding, the owner comes over to me, he says, can I help you? And s \u2014 and so I\nsays, well, we are not ready yet to get married, but soo-soon. Oh, I have a good deal\nfor you. Listen to this, I have a good deal for you. There was a couple that they had\nto get \u2014 you know, you have to give a down payment. So they \u2014 something went\nwrong with that thing, and he says, I got a deposit, but if you want, you gonna get,\ninstead of the deposit, I will give you much \u2014 a very good deal. So I said, all right,\nlet me think about it, P11 think about it. We went home, and I spoke to Ceil(ph) and\nshe said, oh su \u2014 get married so soon? Yeah. Oh, right, yeah, sure. So I says, all\nright, talk to your aunt, because she came to her aunt, you know. I says, talk to your\naunt, and we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll see. And then Ill \u2014 I'll go back and I'll find out what he\nwants and Ill make the deal with him.

Maybe \u2014 maybe you\ndon\u2019t want to get married, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know. So right away, oh, yes. So right\n134May 20, 2009\naway I went back and made the deal with him, and give me a good deal, because\ncomparing, in those days, I think was he charged me 20 dollars for a couple, or for a\npers \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, but such a long time. It\u2019s almost 50 years, don\u2019t forget.",

        "A: Yeah, October",
        "A: October the 10\" we got married.",
        "A: So, that\u2019s how we got married, and then we went to \u2014 for a honeymoon, also\nvery close, in the Catskill mountains. And we have a nice hotel, and we were there\nfor a week. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stay too long because of the business, but my\ncousin says, Saul, stay as long as you like. So we \u2014 we stood there one \u2014 one week,\nor two weeks? I think it was \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you that, I don\u2019t remember, so better don\u2019t\nsay anything. So that\u2019s how we got married, slowly. We lived in \u2014 in Washington\nHeights, and after then we bought a house [indecipherable] Parkway section. And\nthen finally, somehow the \u2014 I said we \u2014 I have enough from the cleaning business,\nbecause it was a good business, but I left in the morning, I didn't see my kids, I\n135May 20, 2009\ncame home at night, I didn\u2019t see my kids. So I said, we had eno \u2014 he wanted also get\nout from this thing, so \u2014 and then we had a friend, he said, let\u2019s go for a \u2014 for a\nvacation, because the school was closed, it was Christmastime, said, let\u2019s go to\nMiami, to Florida, from New York.

Going home we wind up\nin a snowstorm, and I d \u2014 I don\u2019t know, in those days I used to get headaches, and I\ngot a headache, so she said, okay, let me drive.

All right, so she said, I\u2019m gonna drive. I says,\nlisten, be very careful how you drive. You know, you cannot use brakes, because on\nsnow you don\u2019t use brakes. So, oh don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. I said,\nhole \u2014 slow down a little bit, you\u2019re going too fast, you\u2019re going too fast. And as\nsoon as I said too fast, a car comes, and she was on a curve, and we wind up in the\ngutter. I says, okay. Luckily, they too \u2014 had to take us out from that, you know, I\n136May 20, 2009\ncouldn\u2019t get \u2014 I had a shovel, I had everything with me, I had to shovel out first,\ngood, you know, to get out from there. And then we got some helpers, they stopped\nand they helped us out. I said, don\u2019t ever touch my car again, because I said, I\nwarned you, go slowly, go slowly. Edith, Edith.",
        "A: I says, Edith, I told you, I says. You cannot use brakes on snow. I says, you\ndrive in New York, too, you drove in New York, I says, it\u2019s the same thing here.\nBut here is \u2014 it\u2019s so bad, and the snow was coming down so strong. We had to stop\nand to read the sign I had to go and clean out the sign, I didn\u2019t know where to go.\nSo I had to clean it out by hand to see \u2014 to read this \u2014 the sign.

        "A: Those army tru \u2014 big trucks, and they were covered up with the \u2014 with covers,\nyou know. You see, in those days, Britain was against to let in Jews to Israel, but\nthey let in Arabs. They had a quota. They \u2014 1500 Jews were allowed to go in in a\nmonth. But the Arabs, if 100,000 wanted to go in \u2014 because you see, they had a\nproblem in those days, the Arabs, they didn\u2019t have no work, and the only thing\nIsrael was blo \u2014 blossoming, blooming, because the Jews started to return, because,\nI don\u2019t know, you must read \u2014 1f you are a Christian, you must read the Bible, the\nold test \u2014 you read the Old Testament ever?\n141May 20, 2009",

So,\nwhen I was reading this Bible, you know, I \u2014 I believe in the Bible, beca \u2014 in the \u2014\nin the five co \u2014 1n the five books of Moses. And you have the New Testament, we\nhave the Old Testament. So I said, that\u2019s the reason I want to se \u2014 I said, I am going\nto Israel. But, i-in those days, so the British were against the \u2014 because they wanted\nthe Arabs, they favored the Arabs. Now, the Jews, if they smuggled in weapons or\nsomething, they went \u2014 used to go in the kibbutzim, and confiscate the Jewish\nweapons and sell them to the Arabs or something like this. But then it came a time\nthat the Jews got a little bit stronger, and they started to fight back the British. I\ndon\u2019t know if you remember it when they bombed the King David hotel, 1t was the\n\u2014 the British headquarters in Jerusalem, and a lot of British soldiers died. And they\n142May 20, 2009\nstarted to suffer. You know, first they \u2014 they killed Jews and things, but then the\nJews hit back, and they \u2014 they got the beating, too. So then they decided they had\nenough, they \u2014 too much losses and they said they giving up. But before they giving\nup, they thought that the \u2014 they confiscated weapons from the Jews and gave them\nto the Arabs, and they took away the weapons from the Jews, but the Jews got weap\n\u2014 different \u2014 from different places they got weapons. And they were hundred\npercent sure that the Jewish people, who in those days, I don\u2019t know, a million and\n\u2014 tops a million and a half or something like that, and the Arabs were in the hundred\nmillions. There was Egypt, there was Lebanon, Syrian, Jordan. Jordan had a well\nequipped army with tanks and things. What the Jews, they had a couple of rifles,\nand things like that. So anyway, the Jews didn\u2019t have no choice, but they went in le\n\u2014 illegally, on boats, you know, they came in. This ship, Exodus \u2014 come, Ill show\nyou something, here.",

        "A: So anyway \u2014 so they \u2014 they thought now, as soon as the British are gonna leave,\nthe Arabs will attack. And that\u2019s what they did, really. They knew ahead of times,\nand they gonna wipe out the Jewish people one, two, three. But, you know, when\nGod promises something, and he watches over you, you could have a billion army,\nand you have hundred people, and who \u2014 who goes out the \u2014 the winner is what\nGod wants, right? And then, the British left, and the U.N. wa \u2014 said they should\ndivide Israel half. Half Jerusalem for the Arabs, and have half Israel for the\nArabs. Half Israel, half Arabs.",
        "A: But the Arabs didn\u2019t want half, they wanted everything, the whole thing. And the\nJews weren\u2019t ready to give them. Now here, Israel has nothing, comparing with the\nArab side. Jordan had a regular army trained by the British, with tanks, with\nairplanes, with all thing, what did the Jew have? Nothing. Couple of tanks or\nmachine guns. But the Czechoslovakian sent help out for the \u2014 for Israel\n[indecipherable] Russia in those days helped. America was \u2014 stayed away. Didn\u2019t\ndo anything for the \u2014 at that time, in the beginning. But, as soon as the British left\n144\nMay 20, 2009\nand the u\u2014 unite [clears throat] Excuse me. The United Nations declared Israel as\na State, the Arabs didn\u2019t want to agree on anything, and as soon as Israel declared a\nstate, that was \u2014 the first premier was dur \u2014 Beng-Ben-Gurion.",
        "A: No, no, I wasn\u2019t in 1\u2014I came to Israel, but I was caught by the \u2014 let me \u2014 let me\njust continue \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and then [Il come back \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 with the thing. So anyway, the bri \u2014 the \u2014 the United Nations, they voted in\nIsrael as half \u2014 half \u2014 we\u2019ll divide it half and half, but Arabs didn\u2019t agree on that.\nThey wanted everything, and as soon as they gathered the army from Egypt, they\ngathered the army from \u2014 from Jordan, Syria helped out, Saudi Arabia,\neverybody against little Israel. But what happened? Israel, the \u2014 the b \u2014 st \u2014 yeah \u2014\nEgypt, with Egypt, it started first with Egypt. Egypt said that from now on the\nJews cannot use the Red Sea, they block \u2014 put a blockade against Israeli shipping,\nbecause Israel had already a couple of ships that used to come, as you know,\ncommercial ships. So since isra \u2014 since Egypt came out with that tank that \u2014 in\nother words, they stopped the select \u2014 you have a job, and they take away from you\n145May 20, 2009\na job, you cannot co \u2014 you cannot \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t let you live. So didn\u2019t have only\none thing. They went and instead of Egypt attacking Israel, Israel attacked Egypt.\nAnd they had already a couple of American Jewish pilots that they used to be in the\nsecond World War, went to help Israel. And they got a \u2014 a couple of planes, and\nEgypt had the big air force already, but Israel attacked first and wiped out the\nwhole Egyptian Air Force. That was the main thing what they did, number one. And\nonce they divide \u2014 they \u2014 they got the air force finished, and Egypt got stuck in the\nmiddle, where everything was going in the Sinai, in the desert, because they were\nstarting to march, but it was too late already for them. And then the tan \u2014 tanks\ncame, and Israel wiped out the whole tanks, and surrounded Egypt and Egypt had\nsuch a defeat that they just hardly made it alive.",
        "A: When Jordan seen what Israel did to Egypt, they started coming down from \u2014\nfrom the it \u2014 what do you call that?",
        "A: The Golan Heights \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the Golan Heights. See, the Golan Heights \u2014 have you ever been in Israel?\n146May 20, 2009",
        "A: You know the geography.",
        "A: Okay. See, the Golan Heights goes up like this in the mountain, and then when\nyou come all the way on top is \u2014 is Syria. From there you could just walk in straight\nto Syria.",
        "A: Right. But see, Jordan \u2014 Syrian, they used to bomb because they used to live by\nthe [indecipherable] it\u2019s like a swamp, you know, where you step in the ground\nyou could sink in til about here, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s soft land, they call it the\nsump(ph).",
        "A: This \u2014 th \u2014 it\u2019s more water than thing and it\u2019s \u2014 you cannot walk there, you\nknow. So they used \u2014 an-and people, the Israelis used to already dry out the\nsumps(ph) and to \u2014 to grow wheat or corn, whatever it is. And the Syrians from the\ntop, when they used to \u2014 because they had the Heights. So they used to shoot down\nwith cannons and things and used to kill a lot of Israelis. Now they said oh, Israel\nattacked Egypt, now we gonna attack Israel. And they came down with the\nmountains with the tanks. But, going up on the tanks, when th \u2014 Israel was ready\nalso with tanks they had already, because they got shipment. France helped Israel a\n147May 20, 2009\nlot, Russians, Czechoslovakian. So they had already more weapons, and they caught\na lot of Egyptian weapons. That\u2019s where they made. And also, they called those\nrockets, the rockets, you know, where they \u2014 to shoot up, and wit \u2014 that was the\nVietnam war, I think it was that. But France somehow, I don\u2019t know, something\nwent wrong between France and Israel, and France stopped delivering \u2014 no more\nweapons, but Israel bought from them some boats, speedboats, and they \u2014 Israel\npaid for them, but she couldn\u2019t deliver them yet, she said the \u2014 an \u2014 they had a date\nwhen to pick them up. And France said \u2014 wouldn\u2019t give back the money to Israel\nand wouldn\u2019t give back the boats for Israel. So Israel, at night, from i \u2014 from\nFrance to Israel is not very far. So they had also boats, and they came at night and\nthey kipnapped \u2014 kipnap \u2014 kidnapped all those boats out. It was \u2014 belonged to them.\nSo says, we paid for it, but the \u2014 France didn't want to give them out. For what re \u2014\nI don\u2019t remember the reason exactly why. So anyway, they took out the boats and\nthat\u2019s how France stopped giving them no more \u2014 no \u2014 because they used to sa \u2014\nsell them Mirage, the jets. The French mira \u2014 like you have here the \u2014 the\nAmericans have the-their jets, what do you call the American jets? The Phantoms?\nPhantom jets.\n148May 20, 2009",
        "A: So over there the \u2014 the brit \u2014 the \u2014 France they had the Mirages, and it was a\ngood plane. In those days if \u2014 a Mirage used to be a million dollars. So, anyway,\nwhen Syria said now we gonna teach those Jews a lesson, and they planted mines\nall the way \u2014 in other words they knew that the \u2014 Israel has the tanks that they co-\ncould come up, and they planted \u2014 there was a lot of sand there. And then it was a\nmir \u2014 another miracle happened that that night \u2014 they didn\u2019t know that \u2014 the knew\nthat there was \u2014 but they didn\u2019t know exactly where the \u2014 the mines are, and they\nwent into one place, they were surrounded by the mine fields, and it was very\ndangerous for them to continue. They didn\u2019t know what to do. Suddenly, a\u2014a-\u2014a\nsandstorm came, and blow out all the sand, and you could see the mines, they could\nsee where the mines are laying. All they went, the soldiers, they knew how to\nhandle those things. They picked up the mines, and then they went up, and they \u2014\nthen come the big battle, it was a fierce battle, cause the Syrians, they have very\nwell prepared and fortified, because they were on the top, and the Jews were on the\n\u2014 on the bottom. So you know when you are on top what you could do when \u2014 go\nup \u2014",
        "A: But finally, a b \u2014 very bad fight [indecipherable] fight, and the Jews gained that,\nand they went all the way up, they almost went into Syria, but they stopped just in\n149May 20, 2009\nfront of Damascus. They could have gone inside, but America told them to stop,\nnot to go in and they stopped. So then \u2014 so then they \u2014 they annihilated th-the whole\nbrit \u2014 the whole Egyptian army, the whole Syrian army, and Lebanese armies. So\none little \u2014 couple of people against \u2014 against millions. So here, used to say it was a\nmiracle, because God told you that the Jewish people will return. Now, you see,\nthey still did not return completely, because this is not the turning place, you see,\nnow they still want \u2014 they still want half of \u2014 of Israel now. Even they lost\neverything and they start with the fight. Israel wanted to give them everything half.",
        "A: Like the U.N \u2014 nited Nations, but the United States was crooked too, so \u2014 so\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the story 1s now \u2014 you \u2014 you seen Netanyahu was here. And I don\u2019t\nknow what happened, what they \u2014 what they arranged something, I really don\u2019t\nknow anything about it. So, in another couple of days, when they read the\nnewspapers, you\u2019ll find out, more or less \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 what\u2019s going on.",
        "A: Yeah, I wanted to show you the \u2014 the ship \u2014\n150May 20, 2009",
        "A: I have a picture, but \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, take a break.",
        "A: Okay. [tape break]",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay. The tattoo is \u2014 you see, in \u2014 when you were in the concentration camps,\nthey \u2014 they \u2014 that denigrated you so low, that they didn\u2019t want to call you by your\nname, you were only a number. There\u2019s a reason they give you \u2014 see, this is B10140\nis my tattoo number. That\u2019s it.",
        "A: And if you were in that time in Auschwitz \u2014 as a matter of fact, I had here \u2014\nwhere I put it? Oh, here it is. Now, you\u2019ll have a chance \u2014 you could read it after.\nMay 20, 2009\nIt\u2019s not my name, but the similar people that after the war they got together also, but\nthey had the higher \u2014 higher number \u2014 yeah, a later number than mine.",
        "A: Right, right \u2014",
        "A: Somebody \u2014 somebody in the synagogue showed it to me, because he seen that I\nhad a number, he says he got it from the computer, so I should read it. So it just so\nhappened that I got it.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, there in Israel, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of people that I met \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 with the \u2014 with the same numbers. I mean, in \u2014 1n the sequence numbers. My\nnumber is 10,000, their \u2014 their maybe 1s 15,000 or different. Or sometimes you\ncould get even the next number, next \u2014 but so far I never met \u2014 met those type of\npeople.\n152May 20, 2009",
        "A: Yeah, sure, yeah, sure. But there was also numbers \u2014 they \u2014 they made a K and\nan L on your forehead. That was rude. Concentration camp, you know, th \u2014 in\nGerman.",
        "A: Koncentrations Lager.",
        "A: The KL, Koncentration Lager. You see, I spoke flu \u2014 when I came here to \u2014 to\nAmerica, I spoke fluently German. Fluently, good. But if you don\u2019t speak for so\nmany years, you get s \u2014 I still understand, if I have to go in a German store, I could\nunders \u2014 as a matter of fact wh-when I had the dry cleaning business, was a German\nprofessor, a lady, very nice lady. She was teaching German. And she \u2014 there\u2019s the\nonly pe \u2014 person she used to come in and talk to me in German, you know, so I was\nable to talk with her.",
        "A: But now, it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m so rusty and it \u2014 even my Jewish starts getting slowly rusty,\nbecause we speak only English in \u2014 in \u2014 in the house. Very seldom \u2014 my wife\nsometimes speaks Yiddish or something. But if you don\u2019t use a language often, yo-\nyou get \u2014 specially German, I didn\u2019t use for a long, long, long time.\n153\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: She was my customer [indecipherable] and that. She had a whole family, they\nused to all come to me, and she was \u2014 what was her name? Come back soon.",
        "A: It\u2019s one thing, I forget the name, but in a few minutes it comes back. Okay, so go\nahead, ask.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, oh, I see, yeah. Well, you see, the thing is this. You have to tell the world\nwhat the German people did \u2014 did to the Jewish people. Now, a lot of people th \u2014\nthe \u2014 they were cremated o-or killed, in \u2014 1-in the war time, they cannot speak no\nmore, because they are dead. And those people who got liberated, they have the\nability to s \u2014 to let know the \u2014 the rest of the world what was going on, and they\nshould be always on \u2014 on the alert, because you never know what could happen.\nYou never know what could happen. Right, take a look for instance Germany. It\nwas a culture nation of \u2014 who would believe that they would produce such a killer\n154\nMay 20, 2009\nmachine and kill 10,000 people overnight? Oh, I forgot to tell you about the\nGypsies.",
        "A: So you want me to tell you?",
        "A: Okay. I was in the D camp that time. I was on this side, the Gypsies, they were\nliving with families, women, children, man, they were living together, and I was\nliving the other side of the barracks. And one night, we were alread \u2014 everybody\nwas asleep. Suddenly they open up the big \u2014 see, the front of the barracks were very\ntall. From here til here, you n \u2014 a truck could back up and load in people, it was\nspecially made like this and vi \u2014 the doors were quite high up. But see, this door is\nwhat \u2014 what is, eight feet?",
        "A: That one was about 16 feet, so a truck \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 big truck would fit in there. Suddenly I heard big commotion, the dra \u2014 the\ndoors open up and the trucks start mov \u2014 and this is in our barrack, barrack \u2014 what\nis my barrack, twen \u2014 27, yeah, 27. And ji \u2014 the Gestapo with \u2014 with the dogs, you\nknow, with those shepherds, and out and chasing us into the \u2014 into the \u2014 into the\n155May 20, 2009\ntrucks, and we didn't know f\u2014 suddenly nothing, nobody, no warning ma \u2014 imagine\nyou're half asleep and suddenly someone comes in with dogs and screaming and\nhitting you with things. And everybody, we were like panic-strick, you know? And\nthey chasing you with dogs in-into the truck and ra \u2014 you know, hurry up, and thi \u2014\nand one dog, I cou \u2014 I have here, it\u2019s still a mark that the \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember if this or \u2014 let me see, I f \u2014 I forgot or \u2014 even on what foot it 1s.",
        "A: No, Pll \u2014 Pll show \u2014 I'll show you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Pll show you, I will show you. I have to see it. Okay, after then I\u2019Il \u2014 I want to\nshow you the thing.",
        "A: And so they \u2014 yeah, so thi \u2014 this is the barrack right? I was here already, see,\nright here. They had to go all the way, from all over to push in the \u2014 the kids in the\nthing. There was not one truck, this [indecipherable] trucks, I \u2014 I just seen one, and\nthen I see the other \u2014 the other \u2014 moved in, the other backed in. But then it\nhappened \u2014 it was already half of the barrack almost emp \u2014 in \u2014 in the truck inside,\nthen they get an order, you got in the wrong place. They had to go on the other side,\n156May 20, 2009\non the Gypsy sides, doing the same thing. So they ran in \u2014 now they chased you out\nfrom that truck, raus witar(ph), you know, get out, you know, in German, they \u2014\neverything was in German there.",
        "A: We still didn\u2019t know what happened here. First they ch \u2014 tried to push us into the\ntrucks, now they chase us out from the truck. And everything had to go one, two,\nthree, you know, but \u2014 by them everything th \u2014 and they hit you with sticks, and\nwith the dogs, you know, they special instigated those dogs. So everybody got wat \u2014\nwe \u2014 we were like dumbfound, you know, we didn\u2019t know what happened here. We\n\u2014 we just didn\u2019t know what was going on. We didn\u2019t know anything. Now, they \u2014\nthey \u2014 the trucks backed out, everybody got out from the trucks, they go to the other\nside, and they went to the Gypsies.",
        "A: They did the same thing with the Gypsy families. I don\u2019t know how many\nthousand of Gypsies there were there. There was a couple of barracks of Gypsies.\nThey \u2014 and the Gypsies were screaming hilfe, hil \u2014 I mean, help, help, in German\nthey say hilfe, hilfe. Help, help us, you know, we \u2014 I mean, we should go and help \u2014\nMay 20, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 we \u2014 you couldn\u2019t \u2014 what \u2014 what could we do? Help, with what? Wi \u2014 they\nhave machine guns, and we have nothing. I don\u2019t know exactly the time, but it must\nhave been like 11 - 12 o\u2019clock at night when \u2014 when they came to our house, 1 \u2014 to\nour b-block, and then they went to the other side, and maybe like two, three o\u2019clock\neverything we \u2014 got so quiet, everyth \u2014 the trucks turned around, they went here and\nth \u2014 straight to the crematoriums. In one night they annihilated all the Gypsies.",
        "A: All of them, women, children and men. Now, what had caused that? I never find\nout. But that\u2019s what happened in Auschwitz, and that\u2019s what happened in our\nbarrack. So, they made a mistake, first they came to us, and then they got an order\nthey got in the wrong place. They kicked us out again, and then they went on the\nother side, and in one night they annihilated all the Gypsy populations. They were\nGerman Gypsies.",
        "A: Okay. Now, go ahead, ask \u2014 ask me the other questions.",
        "A: You know, sometimes it \u2014 it climbs in some new ideas, but more or less I would\nsay 80 percent I \u2014 80 or 70 percent, I gave you what \u2014 what I know. And maybe\ntomorrow I\u2019m gonna go, oh, I forgot to tell you this, or \u2014 or like \u2014 same thing like,\n158May 20, 2009\nsee, I didn\u2019t even tell you about this, you see? This is, they came in, and you had to\nsit down, didn\u2019t ask you no questions.",
        "A: Next, next, next and they had those pens you know, pick, pick, pick, pick, that\u2019s\nit.",
        "A: Yes, okay.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Well, I hope you spread for the whole world, let them know also what\u2019s was\ngoing on, how the Germans behaved to people, innocent women and children, what\nthey did. I could tell you more and more stories too, but all right, I think it \u2014 for\ntoday it\u2019s enough. Okay.",
