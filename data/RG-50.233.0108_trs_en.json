        "Q: The date is Sunday, March 29, 1992. We\u2019re speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer\nabout her father, Dr. Gerson Reif. What can you tell us about your father? What\ndo you know? Do you know anything about his childhood, about his family?",
        "A: I don\u2019t really know anything about his family. The only things I can say about\nmy father is that -- first of all, apparently he was a pretty good daddy. Apparently\nhe really wanted very much to have a daughter and so he was apparently very\nhappy when I was born, as a girl. I think he was probably a fairly serious person\nbut I think he was probably less way out than either of his children -- in the sense\nthat I think he was serious about his professional pursuits but he also apparently\nenjoyed going to the opera and so on. I guess he and my mother bought sort of\npopular music records of the day and so I don\u2019t think -- I have a feeling that he\nwas not like an ultra intellectual type but very serious about his work.",
        "Q: Do you know where he went to school or anything about his education?",
        "A: He went to school in Vienna, that\u2019s all I really know. Then he actually was in the\nwar during World War I and he was wounded. He was in the Austrian army and\nhe was wounded at the Russian front. Actually I\u2019ll take you on a three -minute\ntour to show you a certificate that he got for that. That happened during his\nmedical training apparently and then he went back and --.",
        "Q: Had his parents -- you said he was born in Poland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Grew up in Poland basically",
        "A: Yes and apparently he was the only one of the children who did anything\nprofessional.",
        "Q: Do you know anything about any of the other children?",
        "A: Well, I know about the two who are in New York and my Aunt Lena came here I\nthink in the 1920\u2019s; got married and she and her husband owned a hardware store.\nThe other, the Uncle Max brother owned what was called a luncheonette in New\nYork which was a place with a fountain. You could get sandwiches or a sundae\nor something like that. I think he probably was different within his own family,\ndifferent from all the others. My brother felt that he had -- my brother liked him\nbecause he was serious and he would bring him books to read and things like that.\nI think he also took my brother ice -skating, for example, which my brother\napparently hated. I think he had a variety of things that he liked to do and he did\ngo dancing with my mother. As a matter of fact, I grew up with this funny thing.\nI thought that all people in Vienna ever did was to go ballroom dancing in white\ngowns and tails for the men. Actually I love to do that; my husband and I do a lot\nof ballroom dancing in evening gowns and tails. I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s a\nconnection there but I think he was quite a serious person. I think he really liked\nhis work. I think he was a good dentist. I think he was serious and interested in\nhis patients.",
        "Q: Did he always run the practice out of his home or did he ever work for someone\nelse, do you know?",
        "A: As far as I know, he always ran the practice out of our house. There was\nsomething else I was going to say, but it just eluded me. No, it wasn\u2019t because\nyou interrupted it\u2019s just because I\u2019m so forgetful. Well, I don\u2019t remember what I\nwas going to say but I don\u2019t really know very much else about my father. I think\nhe was probably a gentle, kindly sort of person. I think he was rather good-\nlooking. He looks good-looking when he was young. I have a picture of him\naround a cadaver on a dissecting table and he was rather good-looking then. But\nthen later on he got kind of stocky and I don\u2019t know, to my mind, that didn\u2019t look\ntoo great on him.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of any outings or anything that you ever took with\nhim?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t have any particular memories of my own. I know that in the\nsummers we used to go to the country and he would come on weekends. I know\nmy brother, to this day, still talks about those things in a somewhat mocking way,\nabout how many suitcases and porters my mother needed to go on those trips. I\nguess that\u2019s really about all I can say. I know it seems weird to me how\ncircumstances shape people\u2019s lives and about the fact that my father was in the\nAustrian army. If he had been sensible to come to the United States earlier, that\nhe would have been probably in the American army because you know he would\nhave been in that age group where he still would have gotten drafted. You\u2019re sort\nof a pawn of the country that you\u2019re born in, in a funny kind of way.",
        "Q: But on the other hand, if they had remained in Austria, they probably would have\nbeen deported very early because they were Polish born?",
        "A: Yes, right. That\u2019s -- I guess that\u2019s about all I know. I think he was a rather\nserious person although I don\u2019t think he\u2019s as serious a person as my brother has\nturned out to be, maybe. I guess that\u2019s about all I can say unless I think of\nsomething later.",
        "Q: Okay. Is it all right with you if we are able to use what we have about your father\nto represent his story as being a victim of the Holocaust to a large extent?",
        "A: Definitely. I think not to a large extent, I think entirely.",
        "Q: So that we represent the suicide as a direct result?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, yes, definitely.",
        "Q: All right, well thank you very much. It\u2019s been very useful and I appreciate your\ntime.",
        "A: Okay.\nTAPE 2",
        "Q: Okay, this is a test. Do you want me to do more?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: The date is Sunday March 29, 1992. We\u2019re speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer\nabout her parents. What can you tell us, let\u2019s start with your mother, is that all\nright?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Can you tell us her name, her date of birth, her place of birth, anything you know\nabout her childhood, anything at all?",
        "A: Okay. My mother\u2019s name was Klara Gottfried Reif. G-o-t-t-f-r-1-e-d,. She was\nborn in a small town in Poland, not far from Lemberg which is now called Lvov.\nShe was apparently somewhat of a rambunctious young lady. She often said that\nshe -- I guess she didn\u2019t get along with her father as well as with her mother. She\nliked to run around and travel and do a lot of things. She spoke several languages\nbecause when she was a child, the borders kept changing and so at one point,\nwhere she was born, was part o Austria. I think both she and my father were\nactually Austrian citizens because when they were born, Poland was a part of\nAustria, then the Russians came in. She spoke Polish, Russian, German; I think\nshe spoke some Czechoslovakian and she might have been conversant with a\ncouple of other languages. She always said she spoke five or seven languages, I\nnever remember whether it\u2019s five or seven.",
        "Q: Do you know what they spoke at home?",
        "A: I think at home, they probably spoke a combination of Polish and Yiddish. Yeah,\nI think that was correct. My mother did a lot of traveling around. She used to go\nto Lemberg to have clothes made and so on. I think she went off to school at\nsome point also.",
        "Q: Do you know what kind of school? Was it a Jewish school or a private school or\na technical school?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. No, it was definitely not a technical school and I don\u2019t really know.\nI have a feeling it might have been more like a finishing school or just some kind\nof general school. She definitely finished gymnasium but did not go to college\nbut she was pretty clever. She was very, very good with numbers and she did a\nlot of reading. Anyway at some -- I think she was very interested when she was\nyoung in fashion and that kind of thing. At some point she went off to Vienna\neither for a vacation or to have clothes made, I don\u2019t know. Somehow and I don\u2019t\nknow how, but she met my father. Ultimately they got engaged and then they got\nmarried, I think in 1925.",
        "Q: They got married in Vienna?",
        "A: They got married in Vienna, well, I\u2019m not sure about that. I\u2019m not sure about\nthat, they might have gone back to Poland to get married. But anyway, they lived\nin Vienna after they got married. Then in 1927, my brother was born. Now my\nmother tells me about her life in Vienna. She said in the beginning it was kind of\nhard. My father had been trained as a physician and then he went back and\nretrained as a dentist and he opened his practice. Now one of the things my\nmother always told me is that we lived in Este , that\u2019s the first district in\nVienna. I guess that was not such a nice -- or the nicest part of Vienna.\nExcuse me, the Este is where she would have liked to live\nShe said that the reason they lived there was because my father\u2019s office was in our\nhouse and that\u2019s where he saw patients. It was for reasons of the business that we\nlived there. We lived actually, I guess, right overlooking the Danube. So in the\nearly years, she said things were difficult and she helped my father. She would do\nthings like answer the phone and maybe help prep patients and various other\nthings. I guess my father did pretty well fairly quickly and so things kind of\nperked up. I think things were quite comfortable. We had -- I know there were\nabout six people who used to come and go in terms of \u201cservants.\u201d There was a\ncook who did our meals. My brother and I each had a governess when we were\nkids.",
        "Q: Each?\nA Yeah, we are very far apart so it wasn\u2019t concurrent. There were one or two\nwomen who came in to do laundry. You know in those days everything was a big\ndeal. I mean coming in to do the laundry was taking the sheets and boiling them\nup with soap and Clorox and so on and so forth. It was kind of a big thing and\nthen even --. We did actually have a vacuum cleaner and I personally remember\nthat these two cleaning women used to come and they would roll up the rugs and\ntake them up to the roof with these bamboo, oddly shaped paddles and beat the\nhell out of the rugs. There were these servants around and at that point I think my\nmother sort of became a lady of leisure. Again I don\u2019t know which of these\nstories are true or apocryphal but her role was to put on a white glove after the\nservants came and go around to make sure that they had cleaned well. I think she\nwent and I think they did a fair amount of socializing. I think they went to the\nopera and they would go dancing and go to the theater. I know they went --\napparently once a week they went to play cards with this relative who actually --\nthe daughter lives in New York now. They must have done a lot of things like\nthat. I think my father was a fairly serious person and my mother was probably a\nmore -- I don\u2019t know, a more frivolous person. Actually my brother apparently\ndidn\u2019t do very well with my mother because he was a very serious kid and he\nreally liked my father. But he thought my mother wasted her time even when he\nwas very little. Then --.",
        "Q: Can we back up just a little?\nA Yeah go ahead.",
        "Q: Do you know about her life in Poland before she moved to Vienna? Do you know\nabout, for example, the Jewish aspect of their life? Were they religious, were they\northodox?",
        "A: I think her parents were orthodox. I don\u2019t know that my mother really -- I mean\nmy mother always did all the very traditional kinds of things but I\u2019m not sure she\nreally believed in any of that. I don\u2019t know, she certainly had some sorts of\nsuperstitions involved in Jewish religion but I have a funny feeling that she\nprobably went along with the things. I don\u2019t think she and my father had -- we\ndidn\u2019t have a kosher house and we --. I think they did go to services on the high\nholidays and things like that. I\u2019d be curious to know whether we -- I\u2019m sure we\nate matzo on Passover but the real question is did we also eat bread? I don\u2019t\nknow what the answer is.",
        "Q: Was it ham on matzo?",
        "A: Right, right. Well, I\u2019m sure we ate ham. I\u2019m absolutely sure we ate ham. We\nprobably didn\u2019t eat bread at Passover but it was not -- I don\u2019t think it was terribly\ncompulsive. I think it was fairly casual. I have a feeling that her father was\nprobably not very casual and I don\u2019t know about her mother. I have a feeling that\nthe mother was a more worldly woman and the father may have been a more sort\nof retiring religious kind of person. I think that my mother always felt that she\nwas considered the black sheep. Not by her mother, but by her father, that her\nfather didn\u2019t like her as well as he liked the other two kids. I think she thought\nthat was because she was sort of rebellious and didn\u2019t do the things that the other\nkids did. Definitely, my mother\u2019s brother and sister sound like more traditional\nkids. They got married and they had kids and they stayed, I think, in the same\ntown, or nearby. Here was this young chick going off to Vienna and marrying\nstrange people.",
        "Q: Did she ever find out the exact fate of her family?",
        "A: Yeah, well, in 1946, when I would have been 12 and I remember this very\ndramatically. There was a blue letter that came from somebody, one of her\nrelatives. I think it might have been this guy called, Moshe Weinhaub who went\nto live in Israel and whose son is in Israel and is a physician, I think. Of course, I\nlost contact after my mother died. I think the letter was from this guy Moshe\nWeinhaub. It told in very great detail what happened to all the relatives. Well,\nthey all perished in one form or another. Now my mother\u2019s sister, that was the\nmost dramatic thing. Apparently they forced her to watch while they threw her\nkids into an oven and then they shot her. That was really a horror story. I think\nmy mother\u2019s brother and maybe the parents -- I remember him describing that a\nlot of people in the camp had typhoid. They purposely tried to contract typhoid\nand they did so they died of the typhoid. They purposely did that because they\ndidn\u2019t want to die in what they knew was awaiting them. There were just\ndescriptions of what happened to everybody that he knew about. I don\u2019t know\nwhatever happened to that letter. As a matter of fact, 1t\u2019s really weird. This is my\nmother\u2019s -- those two pieces of furniture are my mother\u2019s. Since my mother died.\nI have not been able to find the key to this. Every once in a while, I try to get it\nopen because I keep thinking that maybe there are some letters and things in\nthere. I know I could probably get a locksmith to open it but I probably have\nmixed feelings. Part of me wants to know what\u2019s behind those little doors and\npart of me probably doesn\u2019t. But anyway, my mother -- I think my mother was a\nvery, very different person after the war from what she was before. Although I\ncan\u2019t really judge that, that\u2019s kind of a guess.",
        "Q: I made you jump. Now why don\u2019t we come back to the time that she had given\nbirth to your brother, I guess?",
        "A: Right, 1927, April 24, 1927. My brother was apparently a very serious little boy\neven at age two. My mother always told stories about how when she would go\nfor a walk with him, instead of wanting to sort of play and so on, he would want\nto have her read the street signs. What does that say, how do you spell that, what\nare the letters? And so on. That\u2019s her perception. My brother -- I have a picture\nof my brother sitting all dressed up with a little Lord Fauntleroy tie in a sandbox\nwith his rear end up -- sort of off the sand so he wouldn\u2019t get himself dirty. My\nbrother sort of tells, with some resentment, that he wasn\u2019t allowed to be a little\nboy because they dressed him up and he always felt he couldn\u2019t get dirty. I think\nthere were a lot of interesting dynamics there. Then at age three, they started him\non violin lessons. Somehow it didn\u2019t work out so they stopped at the advice of the\nteacher, I guess. Then he started again at the age five. Then it really took hold\nvery well and he really did play the violin. If you ask him, he\u2019Il say, well you\nknow, I\u2019m not -- I can\u2019t really play very well. But he really plays. I mean for an\namateur, he plays extremely well. Then when my father died -- well first my\nfather got very depressed because, well, because things were obviously looking\nvery bad in Europe. I really should back up. Starting in 1933. I think things\nstarted being politically very hairy. People had just come out of a Depression. As\nan aside, all my life, I was always really bothered that I might have been an\naccident because I\u2019m seven and a half years younger than my brother.\nSubliminally that always bothered me and I never had the guts to ask anybody\nwhich in retrospect seems silly. But actually I was over forty once when I asked\nmy brother, was I an accident? My brother said, no, absolutely not. Why did they\nwait so long? Because of the Depression. I was born in 1934, in November and\nso things were --. Now as I think back on it, it was a really dumb time to have a\nkid because things were not looking good. Did I send you the article I wrote for\nBoston Magazine?",
        "Q: You sent me one about your cousin?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t send you one from Boston Magazine? I should give that to you because\nthat\u2019s sort of about this subject. Anyway, so then I was born, and then things\nstarted getting bad. They got worse and worse. My father and mother started\ntalking about the possibility of going to America. Apparently my father just felt -\n- in 1934 my father was already forty years old, right? So his feeling was, how\ncan I go to America? I don\u2019t know the language; I would have to retrain. We\nwould get there and we would have nothing so it just didn\u2019t seem like a\nreasonable thing to do. But then in August of 1938, I think it was, my father, like\neverybody else, had to close because Jews were not allowed to work any more.\nMy father got really, really, very, very depressed. My brother, I think my brother\nreally still has and had all the time, a really tremendous resentment about my\nmother not handling that right. I\u2019ve asked him about that and he says well, she\nused to say well you know you got to come out of this. You can\u2019t walk around\nlike this. She would kind of go off then and do whatever needed to be done. I\nsaid to my brother, well what did you do? He said, well I remember standing in a\ndark room holding his hand, just quietly. Now that I\u2019m at my present age and our\nkids are 22 and 24, I realize that it was just a very difficult situation for my\nmother. How, if somebody else is just very depressed all the time and you really\ndon\u2019t know how to get the person out of it, I think after a while maybe it\u2019s kind of\na survival thing. That you\u2019ve got to just keep doing what are your daily things\nbecause otherwise you\u2019re going to go insane also. I don\u2019t know what was going\non there but it was a really bad scenario, really very unpleasant things were\nhappening to Jews. I\u2019m sure that my father must have been extremely frightened.\nThere\u2019s a woman who actually went to medical and then dental school with my\nfather. We were always friendly with that family. For example, that woman was\nforced to go out and scrub the streets and things like that. All sorts of demeaning\nthings happening and I think it must have been just a terrible, terrible time\npsychologically.",
        "Q: Until the time that he was forced to stop working, he worked regularly?\nA Yes, I think he did work regularly.",
        "Q: Even if maybe he was beginning to be depressed or whatever? He didn\u2019t --?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I think he got very depressed after he had to close his\npractice. Now I don\u2019t know that for sure, I just know that from things that I\u2019ve\ngathered. Anyway, my mother, I think, tried to keep going about her business.\nSomewhere in this time span, they did decide that they would have to leave. So\nthey went and applied for visas and passports and so on. On the morning of\nSeptember 30, 1938, my father and mother actually left the house together to go\npick up those passports. They picked up the passports and at about noontime,\nthey parted to do separate chores. They were supposed to meet, I think, at the\nhome of this cousin where they used to play cards. Apparently my father never\ngot there. I guess at about 2:30 in the afternoon, I seem to remember somebody\ntelling me, there was a phone call. My father had been found at the bottom of a\nstaircase. I\u2019m not sure whether he was already dead or whether he died either on\nthe way to the hospital or right after he got to the hospital. But the death\ncertificate says he died of multiple fractures including a fractured skull and lots of\nfractured ribs. All my life, I grew up thinking that he had thrown himself off the\ntop floor, the fourth floor of this -- down the stairwell. There was a lot of trauma\naround that. My mother did not want -- so the general consensus was that he had\ncommitted suicide. My mother did not want anybody to know that and I don\u2019t\nunderstand. You know, it\u2019s funny, children don\u2019t ask the right questions all the\ntime. I just took that on gospel and I never, ever said anything until quite recently\nabout that. I never told it; I mean practically no one did I tell this to. When I was\ndiscussing with my brother recently, he said, well, I\u2019ve never kept this a secret.\nThen a few years ago, when I started really thinking about this; I started thinking,\nwell, now how do we know he committed suicide? People say you\u2019re just trying\nto protect yourself from this sort of thing. First of all, I don\u2019t have anything\nagainst this, I just don\u2019t. It wouldn\u2019t -- in general it wouldn\u2019t bother me now. I\nkeep asking myself, does it bother me if he did commit suicide. I suppose in one\nway it doesn\u2019t bother me and in another way I think well this was sort of a\nshirking of your responsibility. You know you had two kids and this was not the\nappropriate thing to do, to leave your wife alone with these two kids. My\nbrother\u2019s idea is that my father probably did commit suicide and that one of the\nreasons that he did it, aside from being depressed and aside from -- I mean people\nwere committing suicide right and left -- was that he probably figured that a\nwoman with two children would have a much better chance of escaping if there\nwas no husband around. At that time, mostly it was the men who were being\nreally harassed, initially. I don\u2019t know but now as a scientist, I sort of stop and I\nthink, well there was nobody there to see this. All sorts of horrible things were\nhappening to Jews, how do we know what really happened? Could he have been\npushed? I think the chances are 90% that he probably did commit suicide. The\nother thing is that I keep thinking why would somebody with a medical profession\nwho has access to much neater, cleaner ways of committing suicide throw himself\noff a stairwell. That\u2019s another reason why I think that maybe he didn\u2019t do it\nhimself. On the other hand, I suppose that when people commit suicide they\u2019re\nnot necessarily being totally rational.",
        "Q: Right, the way some people plan it out. This sounds like it perhaps hadn\u2019t been\ncontemplated f or long, this specific act if 1t was?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know but somebody recently pointed out to me that Primo Levi who was\nalso a scientist and also had more sophisticated means of committing suicide\napparently also jumped off something or other.",
        "Q: Yes, he did.",
        "A: But anyway, the answer is I don\u2019t know what happened. When this happened, my\nmother was just totally devastated, just --.",
        "Q: Before we -- I hate to break your train of thought?",
        "A: No, go ahead. I don\u2019t mind.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about her personality before this time? When you\nwere very, very young?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember very much about her except --. I remember a few silly\nthings like I used to like to go into the kitchen and dry the dishes for the cook.\nThe cook would stand me up on a little stool and hand me one dish at a time and I\nwould dry it. I also liked to iron. You know in those days there was no electric\niron so they had those irons that you kind of had to keep putting on the stove until\nthey get hot. I used to like to iron and my mother really didn\u2019t like me to do those\nthings. I loved to do those things. Maybe she was already overly protective\nbefore the war, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Do you still like to 1ron?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t like to iron. I don\u2019t mind but I don\u2019t like to iron and I hate to dry\ndishes. As a matter of fact, I think my mother used to kid me about because then -\n-. When we came to New York and she wanted to help with those things she\nwould tease me and say you used to love to do it when I didn\u2019t want you to. Now\nwhen I want you to, you don\u2019t want to do it. Well, it seems to me that it\u2019s fairly\nself evident that it would be that way. Do I remember anything else about her?\nYou know, I actually remember more about my interactions with the governess\nand the servants. For example, the things I remember about the servants is that\nthey were fun for me. The reasons they were fun was that they would come in\nand do all these routine things. Like we had a very long hallway because the\napartment was two 7- room apartments with the wall broken down between them\nso there were 14 rooms. They all went off this long hallway. We had this rug,\nrunner-rug, so they would roll that up every time they came. I don\u2019t know\nwhether it was every day or every other day or whatever. They would let me sit\non the end of the runner. Then they would start rolling it, pull, roll, pull, so I\u2019d\nget aride. Or if they were sweeping the floor, they\u2019d let me put my feet on the\nbroom and sweep with me. Or swing me back and forth and things like that.\nThose were kind of exciting things for me and I think my governess had a cot in\nmy room. I remember her being there; I remember it was kind of a probably\nconsoling feeling that -- I don\u2019t know whether she was there all the time or what.\nI don\u2019t ever remember the kind of thing of being left alone. But then early on, I\nthink I did get left alone at night to sleep because my brother tells me I was an\nabsolute royal pain, that I used to scream through the nights. The governess\nwould not let my mother come to me. I don\u2019t really remember a lot about my\nmother in those days and I certainly do not remember my father. The funny thing\nis I remember my father but then one day, when I must have been about ten or\nsomething, looking at this picture of my father that my mother always had on her\nnight table and suddenly realizing that the real memory of my father had been\ntaken over by the memory of the picture. I no longer had that real memory that I\nhad originally. I remember my room in Vienna and I think I remember the dining\nroom and I certainly remember the kitchen.",
        "Q: Do you want to describe them at all?",
        "A: Well the dining room, I seem to remember, it was kind of very formal and dark.\nIt seemed dark in there. I don\u2019t know whether because there were curtains drawn\nor something. We did have in New York the table that was in that dining room.\nIt was a dark, probably mahogany or something, massive. The furniture we had\nin Vienna was the sort of massive thing that was popular in the 1930\u2019s. I just\nremember the big table in the middle and looking in there and it was -- just\nremember a sort of formal feeling. The kitchen was sort of light and airy; there\nwas this white --. In Vienna there were no built in closets and so people had --\nthey were called wardrobes. In the kitchen there was a white lacquered big\nwardrobe with two doors that opened with keys, these kinds if old fashioned keys.\nI think the cook had like dish towels in there. One memory that became very\nimportant for Kristallnacht -- she had -- and actually I have one upstairs. There\nwere these little things you could buy, pasteels they were called. They were sort\nof awful tasting things, minty or something. They came in either single boxes or\ntriple boxes. I don\u2019t know if they were double sized ones but they were sort of\ngreen and gold cans. The cook had a triple sized one of those in that white closet.\nWhenever she had extra goshen which are the equivalent of pennies she would\nput them into that can. There must have been some connection to me about that\ncan. I don\u2019t know what it could have been, maybe she bought me things with\nthose occasionally or something. But anyway, there was this long hallway and I\nremember my room quite well.. My room had a nice window which I think\noverlooked the river. Then there was a dresser over there with a stuffed animal on\nit and then my crib which was not like an American crib but had -- the part that\ngoes up and down had a mesh of sort of ropes going both ways. That was the way\ncribs were made in that time, I think. Then there was this cot that the governess\nused to maybe nap on or whatever. I don\u2019t think it was a very big room but I sort\nof liked that room. Then I remember my father\u2019s office, my father\u2019s examining\nroom. I remember the linoleum on the floor and that becomes important for later\nwhen we back to Vienna in 1963 and I recognized that. But anyway so then the\nnext -- my big memory is the night of Kristallnacht. My mother was holding me\nup in her arms and my brother was holding -- of course my father was dead by\nnow -- my brother was holding on to my mother\u2019s skirt. There was this loud\nknock on the door and my mother said who\u2019s there and the superintendent was\nthere. Now I only remember the superintendent and one other man. But my\nbrother says there were actually five or six men who came. My mother went to\nopen the little metal thing on the glass peephole and this guy smashed the glass\nwith the back of a revolver. The superintendent said, let us in Mrs. Reif, we\nwon\u2019t hurt you. They came in and I remember being in the kitchen. The only\nreally strong memory I have is of them taking that can full of coins. They took,\nthey helped themselves to everything, all the radios, anything that was of any\nvalue, they took. Although before that, interestingly, apparently either my mother\nor some relative -- my father as a dentist had hunks of gold because in those days\na lot of fillings were made with gold. Somebody went and dumped those in the\nbottom of the Danube. Whatever else was valuable in the house, these people\nhelped themselves to. I do think I remember one of the guys having a radio or\nsomething in his hand. But the thing that I, as a little girl, felt most resentful\nabout was that they took away this box of coins. They left and then I don\u2019t\nremember anything else about Vienna, I don\u2019t think. I think I may remember the\nlittle suit that I wore when we got on to the ship, the San Luee but I\u2019m not sure\nwhether I remember that or I remember a picture that we have. I actually have\nthat outfit still. I remember one other thing. After Kristallnacht, somehow, I\ndon\u2019t know how it happened, but my mother managed to get these tickets to get\non the San Luee. The reason we got first class passage was because you were\nonly allowed to take, I think it was like four dollars a person, out of the country\n.My mother figured, what the hell, we might as well go first class. We had to\npack up stuff. You were allowed to send things away.",
        "Q: Send abroad?",
        "A: Yes, but there regulations and I have a feeling that some things got smuggled in.\nFor example, a bunch of sterling silver flatware was in that van and I think that\nwas strictly forbidden if I have read my history correctly. But anyway my mother\nwas not very -- my mother was really devastated -- I was going to say she wasn\u2019t\nvery functional but she obviously managed all right. I think other people came\nand kind of had to help her do things. There was a -- my brother had met another\nboy called Irwin Kleinfeld who\u2019s now a mathematician at the University of Iowa\nin lowa City. Through that friendship, our parents kind of got to know his\nparents. The father was a lawyer and somehow he came and helped my mother\nout with various things. The day this enormous van pulled up in front of our\nbuilding, he was there helping my mother get stuff packed into this van. I think\nmy mother was not doing very well and he kind of said, take this, take that. I\ndon\u2019t know who made the final decisions, I have a feeling that he made a lot of\nthem. There were some really weird things in this van, just really weird. For\nexample, we had one room in Vienna that was totally covered apparently in\nmirrors. It was made out of these tiles that were about eight inches wide by about\nfourteen inches high. One of the things that came out of this van, when we got it\nin New York three years later, was all these mirrors. Now what did anybody\nthink we were going to do with these mirrors! So that was in there. Weird things,\non my second birthday, I had been bought a very special doll. That doll arrived in\nNew York, speaking of traumatizing kids, it was hung by the neck from the bar\ninside one of the wardrobes with all the clothes and so on. This guy, I remember\nthat day, I remember this guy coming and I remember these things going out into\nthis van. That van went to New York and it sat in a warehouse which I think was\npaid for by my aunt Lena or maybe we sent -- I don\u2019t know. Then I don\u2019t\nremember that trip except for being seasick. Then we were sent back to Europe\nand we went to France. That\u2019s where my memories start again. The first thing\nthat happened was -- am I on track? -- 1s this the kind of stuff you want to hear?",
        "Q: Yeah, since I already have a lot of this, of the facts, do you know any of your\nmother\u2019s responses to these things? Or her feelings -- how did she respond being\nin France when you --?",
        "A: The thing that I remember is that my mother -- my remembrance of my mother\nwas that she was, to a large extent for years and years, in a state of -- I don\u2019t know\nwhat to call it -- in a state of somebody who\u2019s just been through a catastrophe\nwhich she had been. It\u2019s just that most people seem to recover more rapidly and\nshe just did not recover. She recovered effectively in that she always seemed to\ndo the right thing to get to the next step but emotionally she never recovered. So\nmy recollection of my mother through most of these years is that she was often a\nvery sad person, it was like a lot of sighing and just this unhappy demeanor on her\nface, for years. She also, in later years, some of that lifted and she could be a real\nfun person sometimes. It was almost weird and I couldn\u2019t even begin to go\nthrough this until very recently. But now I have a feeling that if somebody had\nsomehow just let her or encouraged her, she could have been a really vibrant\ndazzling lady. Occasionally she would dance with me, not very often but\noccasionally. She was very good in later years like after I met Sam and we got\nmarried and everything. She was always game for anything, fly on a jet; yeah, PI\nfly on a jet. She didn\u2019t have any of these hang-ups like other parents of my\ncontemporaries. You know, they wouldn\u2019t ride an escalator. She came, even\nwhen she was sixty, she climbed with us in Yosemite but there was always this\nreal sadness. I remember once when she was already starting to get Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease, she said this to me very often but this particular time I remember it very\ndramatically. She said, I\u2019ve only had thirteen good years in my whole life and\nthose were the first thirteen years with my father is what she was referring to. We\nwere not very nice children to her. We were extremely hard on her for many\nreasons. First of all, my brother thought she was frivolous, I probably thought she\nwas a little frivolous also although she was very sad and serious. She always\nseemed to be concerned about things that -- I don\u2019t know how we got to be so\nlofty thinking but she always seemed to be concerned with things that we felt\nwere not terribly important. One would say that there was friction because we\njust totally lorded it over her. It was really, as I think back on it now, was a very\nstrange situation.",
        "Q: Let me flip it over.\nEND OF SIDE A, TAPE 2",
        "A: Is it going now?",
        "Q: Now we\u2019re on.",
        "A: Okay. She was very, very encouraging of our studying and doing well for\nourselves but she didn\u2019t demand enough for herself. I can say this in retrospect.\nFor example, my brother had a room to himself in New York -- I\u2019m skipping\nahead now but -- and I didn\u2019t. I shared a room with her and I did my homework\nin the kitchen. She\u2019d come home tired from work, she would make dinner, she\nwould clean up and then I had the audacity to tell her that she couldn\u2019t run the\nwater to wash the dishes while I was doing my homework. She went along with\nthat! That was really -- in retrospect that was sort of amazing. She should have\ntold me where to get off. She did get after me to help often and I sometimes tried\nto help a little but I -- it\u2019s funny you know now, do you have children?",
        "Q: No, not yet.",
        "A: You see this thing reflected in your children. I mean she would say, would you\ndry the dishes? I would say yes Ill dry the dishes as soon as I finish my\nhomework. Then she would say -- she couldn\u2019t wait till I finished because she\nwas very methodical about all the household things. So she would dry the dishes,\nso most of the time I never got to do it. I would have done it if she had waited but\nshe couldn\u2019t wait. Now as a parent I can sense that irritation of I want it done\nnow and the kid wants to do it later. It\u2019s just that I sort of know enough to know\nthat if I really don\u2019t want to do it and I want the kid to do it, you just leave it and\nlet the kid do it later.",
        "Q: Did she have any interests? You said she enjoyed dancing and things like that?\nYou mentioned that there was opera -- did she follow anything closely? Have\nhobbies or anything?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. She actually, she was fantastic with her hands. In Europe\nwhen she was a lady of leisure she did embroidery, that\u2019s what ladies did. She did\nthat whole thing, that\u2019s all silk petite point. It took her two years to do that. We\nwere such terrible kids. We both used to tease her about why did you spend all\nthis time doing this really disgusting-looking scene? Why didn\u2019t you at least pick\nsome --? First of all, now it\u2019s still looks like --. I still think why did she spend all\nthis time doing this scene but it doesn\u2019t look as bad as it used to look. Now I\nreally appreciate the time and the energy and the devotion and the workmanship.\nThere are lots of things around the house that she did. Later on it became things\nthat we tried to get her to do to keep her busy. She didn\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know\nhow she did this in Vienna. I think in Vienna she probably picked this up\nwhenever she had time and then put it down and so on. In the time that I really\nknew her, she didn\u2019t know how to relax except to read. She did a lot of reading.\nI\u2019m not always sure that -- she read in a funny way. She did not read like an\neducated person. She read in a way that was non-analytical. We, the children,\nwho both turned out to be Ph.D. scientists found this really weird.",
        "Q: How do you mean non-analytical? Reading fiction in a non-analytical way? I\nhave to defend the humanities.",
        "A: Well the best way and this may even be an unfair way to say but one of the things\nthat I remember and this had nothing to do with reading but rather with a movie,\nshe was here baby sitting for us. She had seen a movie called \u2018I Never Sang For\nMy Father\u2019. My husband and I were going out to see it that night. When we\ncame home, almost simultaneously my husband and I said boy, what a miserable\nfather. At the same moment she said, wasn\u2019t that a miserable son? I\u2019m sure it\ncould be interpreted both ways but I think any -- if you looked at the critics which\nI don\u2019t think I ever did of that movie -- I think the whole point of that movie is\nthat here is a parent who is manipulating the son in such a way that the son\u2019s life\nbecomes ruined. My mother totally missed that, all she could see was the bad\nson, not being nice to the daddy.",
        "Q: I see what you mean.",
        "A: Or for example, after our kids were born, I would keep giving her books to read\nabout child rearing. Every time she finished one, she\u2019d say, ah, this is really\ninteresting. This is great. I wish I had known about this when you were small.\nBut then ten minutes later she would go and totally interact by her gut reaction\nrather than by what she had just read about. We would get into some really\nridiculous arguments, she and I. Later on, after I got my Ph.D. and got a job,\nbecause she worked like a mad dog in the factories -- she had incredible pride in\nher work. She not only did what she had to do but she worked harder because she\nwanted everything to be just right. We pretty much had to insist that she retire\nand my brother and I each gave her money. Well, she never could feel\ncomfortable with getting money from us. We would say look, you struggled like\nmad to support us. Did we ever complain about that? No, we just took the money\nand we lived happily ever after. Now it\u2019s your turn to have a good time and\nretire. We are doing quite well, we are in no way being hurt by giving you this\nmoney. Why don\u2019t you just take the money and enjoy it. You\u2019ve had a really\nhard life, now\u2019s the time to have a good time. She could never cope with that.\nEvery month when the checks came, there was a struggle about whether she was\ngoing to keep these checks. But then also when she did retire, she was lonesome,\nwhat was she going to do with her time? Sam and I used to devise these projects\nfor her to do. One time she said she really needed a bookcase. We bought her an\nunfinished bookcase and some varnish and shellac and the rest of it. We said well\nthis ought to keep her busy for a week or two. We told her how to do this and so\non. Two days later or three days later, she calls up, I finished the bookcase. What\ndo you mean, you finished the bookcase. You have to wait at least so many hours\nin between. She said, oh I did. It said wait five hours so I set the alarm clock\nwhen I went to sleep and at five hours I got up and I put on the next coat and so\non. Everything was like something she had to do. All right, I\u2019ll give her\nsomething better to do so I gave her this enormous piece of rug mesh, to hook a\nrug which is now hanging on our wall. I thought well this has got to keep her\nbusy for a while. After a few weeks, she came back. It was all finished. She\nsaid, you know this was really very hard. My hands were bleeding along the sides\nfrom working on this. Everything we tried to do to occupy her time in a nice way\n-- but on the other hand she also did very well. She must have gone to every free\nconcert in New York and free plays and so on. She would start talking to younger\npeople, other people found her very delightful because they didn\u2019t have to grow\nup with her. So none of those irritations were there but it was very hard for her to\nmake friends. The only people that she made friends with were other ladies like\nher from Vienna. It was hard to find those as the years went on. Even with those\npeople, she was very critical and so if they did something wrong, she would get\nvery annoyed or insulted or --. You were going to ask something?",
        "Q: Did she speak German with you and your brother or with these other people? Did\nshe prefer to speak German?",
        "A: She did speak German with them, yeah. She did speak German with us for a long\ntime. I think in the later years, after our kids were born, she probably spoke more\nEnglish. When we first came here, she had all these books and every night she\u2019d\ncome home from work, she\u2019d be exhausted. She would make dinner, she would\nclean up, she would get into bed, she would study her English. She was very\nthorough; she had these little notebooks about this size that she would keep.\nEvery night she would write down everything she spent that day in that notebook.\nShe would add it up and then she would count what was in her change purse and\nher wallet. If it was off by even one cent, even if 1t was late at night, she would\ngo through the whole thing as many times as it took, to balance that perfectly. It\ncould not be off by one penny. Then funny things happened. One time I\nremember -- you know how you get into silly discussions about -- she had bought\nme this dress and I said it cost so much and she said no, 1t was so much. She just\nwent and got her little thing of little books and looked it up and there it was with\nthe date and how much it was. Gray dress with white stripes. She was really, she\nwas almost compulsive about keeping the records. Every Saturday was cleaning\nday. Come heaven, hell or high water, the house got cleaned on Saturday from\ntop to bottom. I got involved in that and sometimes I felt resentful about that. It\nwas a gorgeous Saturday and from nine in the morning until three in the\nafternoon, we cleaned house -- washed the floors, everything. I want to go back\nto France, right?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In France, my mother was not doing very well. With all the languages she could\nspeak, she never learned to speak French because she was just so emotionally\ndevastated and in France, when we first got to Ludern we lived in this hotel.\nThere were a whole bunch of about twenty refugees who were put up at this hotel.\nShe was really -- in addition to things being bad, she was upset about all sorts of\nminor things. Like in the kitchen of the hotel, there were cats and the cats were\nallowed to walk on the food table. Well, I get bothered about that also but under\nthose circumstances --. She went to ask the woman who ran the hotel where is\nthere a public bath. There was no bathroom, there were toilets but no bathroom in\nthis hotel. The woman didn\u2019t know. This blew my mother\u2019s mind, how could she\nnot know! This woman, like a lot of other French women, would put on a lot of\nperfume. My mother was always -- g-d, she must be filthy. I\u2019m sure she sponged\n-bathed and so on but anyway -- so my mother was really bothered by things like\nthat. I remember that hotel very well. Then after we had been there -- I had a\nlittle boyfriend whose name was Jacques Paul Berg and I just --.",
        "Q: He was in the picture you sent me.",
        "A: Right, and he apparently perished. I don\u2019t know what that meant having a little\nboyfriend but I think he was just my friend. We played together. Then the other\nthing I remember from that time, this was really weird stuff. I remember there\nwere these two girls who forced me to watch the hotel cooks kill a chicken in the\nback of the hotel. I just cried and cried, I was really upset. Just around the time\nof the San Luee reunion in 1989, I coincidentally met these two women who were\nthe two girls. They said well there weren\u2019t any other children so it must have\nbeen us. Yes, it sounds like the kind of thing we would have done. They\nactually, those people if you could get to interview them, it would be very\ninteresting, because those two sisters have diametrically opposite stories about\nwhat happened in France. Not the facts, but the attitudes are just diametrically\nopposite.",
        "Q: Do you remember their names?",
        "A: Yes. First of all their unmarried last name was Isner. I-s-n-e-r. The younger one\nis Ruth Isner Kissinger and her husband is actually a first cousin of Henry\nKissinger. The other is Bella and she remarried. I don\u2019t remember what\nhappened to her husband. She\u2019s now Bella Isner Uhlfelder U-h-I-f-e-l-d-e-r.\nRuth Isner is, I found her very easy to talk to. Actually Bella was originally easier\nto talk to. Ruth is a more reticent person but Ruth has been much more\ncooperative with me about collecting stuff for my book. Bella got mad at me for\nsome really dodo thing at the reunion. Because I got up and announced that I was\ndoing this book and she accused me of making this very emotional thing into a\ncommercial affair. I don\u2019t know but anyway I have not gotten a story from Bella\nbut I have one from Ruth Isner. I think it will be very interesting to interview\nboth of these sisters.",
        "Q: Where do they live, in New York?",
        "A: Yeah, they both live in --. No, she lives in New Jersey, Bella lives in, I think, the\nBronx or uptown Manhattan but somewhere in the 100\u2019s. Anyway, so we spend\nalmost a year there, just short of a year. Then one morning the Germans came in\nand took the town. I remember that because we woke up and they were parading\naround. Shooting into the air and just being generally very noisy. The thing that I\nremember was I was a very goody-goody little girl. I\u2019d always been taught, you\ndon\u2019t lie, you don\u2019t this, you don\u2019t that. I was told that no way was I allowed to let\non that I could speak German. The generals, I guess, actually came and lived in\nthe hotel so for about two weeks, we were together. I remember being totally -- I\nthought that this was really weird -- that you\u2019re not supposed to lie but here I am\nand I can understand everything all these guys say. Every time they talk to me\nI\u2019m standing there saying . My brother now tells me that one day my\nbrother just had his heart in his mouth because one of these guys came up to me,\nstarted to talk to me and my brother saw me start to answer in German. He\nbecame petrified and he said at the last minute, I suddenly must have\nremembered, and I said . But that was a very important time in my life\nbecause there was a young German soldier there. I don\u2019t really remember his face\nexcept it was a very nice face. He had sandy colored hair; I don\u2019t know if I could\nhave judged but as I think back he must have been 18 or 19. There was\nsomething very pleasing about this kid. Every morning they did these stupid\nmaneuvers around this hotel and we would watch from our window which looked\nout over the side. This guy would throw me candies and things; my mother was\nalways sure they were poisoned and didn\u2019t want me to eat them but you know I\ndidn\u2019t get stuff like that. So I ate it and here Iam. Then he ultimately gave me a\nlittle doll which I treasured for a long time. Now I don\u2019t know whether this is true\nor not but in my mind, that soldier was unbelievably important. Because when I\ncame to the United States, the kids -- well first of all kids are brutal. The kids\nwere really brutal. First of all everybody was making fun of me because I\ncouldn\u2019t speak English. Even some of the parents in the neighborhood in\nBrooklyn were not really very kindly which I find kind of shocking. The kids\nwould come over t me and even the adults and say, do you hate the Germans?\nEven as a kid, I was seven, I would say no, I don\u2019t hate the Germans. There are\ngood Germans and there are bad Germans. The reason I was able to say that must\nhave had to do -- probably also had to do with discussions with my brother -- but\nI think it had a lot to do with this soldier. It really wasn\u2019t until very recently that I\nstarted thinking. Well was this soldier -- well I always somehow, in my life,\nassumed that that soldier knew I was Jewish. But recently I thought,, well, did he\nknow? Maybe he didn\u2019t know, maybe he was just being nice to me because he\nthought I was a cute little Catholic kid. But the point 1s, it\u2019s irrelevant it\u2019s what\nthat guy represented to me, throughout my life whether it was real or not real.\nThat I think was incredibly important about that particular stage. Then there was\na lot of talk between my mother and my brother about what\u2019s to be done. You\ncan\u2019t stay here because I don\u2019t know how my mother managed to -- I mean my\nmother couldn\u2019t even talk one word in French. How could she carry this ruse on\nfor two weeks of us making believe that we couldn\u2019t speak German. I don\u2019t know\nhow we managed to get through that. Apparently, according to my mother, my\nmother says that my brother said to her one day, I\u2019m leaving here whether you\nleave or not. Now my brother doesn\u2019t quite remember saying anything quite so\ndramatic but in the meantime apparently my brother tells me that there are\nmeetings amongst these twenty refugees. As a group, they decided to get out.\nNow there was only one family, I heard about this for years, there was one family\nwho decided not to leave. I never knew who that was until 1989; it was this\nfamily, these sisters. That was obviously the wrong move because they didn\u2019t get\nout until \u00b046 or \u201947. We left all our stuff in this hotel except for a couple of pairs\nof underwear and my brother\u2019s violin. We went very late at night, I remember\nwalking to the train station. It was dark and I think it was midnight. We went to\nthe train station and I didn\u2019t remember that there were 20 of us or 18 of us or\nwhatever it was; I only remember my mother and my brother and me walking to\nthe train station. We took the train. My brother has filled me in on the funny\nthings that happened along the way and how we actually got across the border by\n-- it was just luck and a ruse. The next thing I remember 1s being in Limoges\nwhich is the town in southern France which is famous for it\u2019s china. I think that\nfirst night we actually must have slept in the railroad station and I slept on a scale.\nThere was a scale in the railroad station. Then we got put up and I thought it was\njust for one night but my brother says we were there for six weeks. You can see\nthat my memory 1s distorted compared to his. But we got put up in the concrete\nbleachers of a stadium for the circus.",
        "Q: Yeah, you told me this, right?",
        "A: Then ultimately some people got together and rented these two rooms. The rooms\nwere each maybe about two or three times as big as this room. There were 30\nwomen in the room downstairs and I think I was the only child. We live in there\nfor several months and all the guys lived upstairs. I think my brother was the only\nchild upstairs, the only one of the men who was a boy.",
        "Q: What did your mother do there, when you were there?",
        "A: Nobody could do anything.",
        "Q: You just hung around --?",
        "A: I seem to remember them being pretty busy cleaning up. They were always\ncleaning up. In the nighttime we had these straw sacks that we put down on the\nfloor and we slept on. In the morning, we piled them up against the wall and\nthere were these crates, like orange crates and we\u2019d put those down as tables and\nchairs. People were always sweeping and cleaning and walking down, every\nmorning we walked down --. I was allowed to get about three inches worth of\nmilk in a coke-sized bottle. My mother made me share that with my brother. You\nhad to walk to the store and they measured this out, walk back. There were\nalways walks begging for bread in the bakery. That was my job, I think I told you\nabout that.",
        "Q: Right, it was cute.",
        "A: Just last year, when I was interviewing my brother, I said to him, did anybody\nthink how demeaning this was to me? My brother looked at me and he said it\nwasn\u2019t demeaning, it was bread. I have a sign in my office that says that because\nit reminds me of something. Anyway that\u2019s where I went to school for the first\nyear. I think it was a very lonesome time for me. There weren\u2019t, somehow, I\ndon\u2019t think I played with the other kids after school. They lived some place else,\nwe were refugees which was probably not a nice thing to be.",
        "Q: Do you know about your mother? Did she interact with the other people?",
        "A: Well she interacted with the other women.",
        "Q: You know how you said, she basically began to change or whatever. Do you\nthink she was in this --?",
        "A: She definitely interacted with the other women but I have a feeling that she may\nnot have been terribly popular. She was emotionally a downer a lot of the time,\nshe was always sad. A lot of other people -- I think that\u2019s true of my brother also.\nWhen we got on the San Luee, apparently mot people -- when the ship sailed\naway, and the captain said all right, these people are going to be treated like all\npeople who are on a tour, people were rejoicing and dancing and doing all these\nother things which my mother was not participating in. Which my brother, even\nthough he was about 11 or 12 at the time, said he was really bothered that these\npeople were being so insensitive. That they had left people behind in dire straits,\nthat they had just come from being in dire straits and it was not a time to dance or\nsing. Well my adult me can see it both ways; yeah, it\u2019s not a time to dance and\nsing. On the other hand, I can see where, if you\u2019ve been really hurting for so\nlong, and there\u2019s an opportunity to do something different, then maybe it makes\ngood mental health sense to try to take advantage of this. I think we spent our\ntime on the ship rather quietly. I must have played with the other kids and there\u2019s\na picture that I sent you a copy of and there seemed to be quite a lot of kids\nthough most of them, I think, were older and there were a few babies. In Limoges\nI went to school and I have a feeling that I was kind of lonesome but there was\nsome -- I remember some really nice things. Like there was a carpenter who\ncouldn\u2019t work most of the time and he made me this wonderful little set of red and\nblue furniture, tables and chairs and he made upholstery things with little pieces\nof wallpaper and so on. That was a really nice thought. Then after a few months,\ntwo rooms next door to the two rooms we had, became available. I don\u2019t know\nwhy but somehow my mother was chosen or somehow got to have the smaller of\nthe two rooms with us. We didn\u2019t have to sleep on the floor, we could put our --\nthey were like orange crate beds that somebody had put together. We could put\nour straw bags on those. That\u2019s where I had real measles in that room and I\nremember that very dramatically. I remember for two weeks lying on my back in\nthis room with a dark curtain drawn because I was do photophobic and watching\nthe mold grow on the ceiling and the drips come and drip down. For two weeks I\nwas lying there like that. The two couples who got the outer room, were two\nsisters married to two brothers. One of those brothers was almost blind and he\nsomehow, even though I think this was illegal, he managed to find some leather.\nHe would punch out those pieces of leather that you make the belts that hook onto\neach other. My brother and I would sometimes help him and I liked doing that\nespecially because I think he used to tell us stories while we sat and work. We\nwould sit at this little window and we would make these belts. That was kind of a\npleasant thing for me.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you can think of about your mother? Because I know,\nbasically when we write this ID, we will stop when you get o America because\nthat\u2019s the Holocaust --. Is there anything else you can think of to fill in?",
        "A: I think my mother was extremely somber in those days. I remember going for\nsome long walks to try to get food and I remember those as being somber\noccasions. I may be totally wrong but I don\u2019t remember any laughter or --. The\nonly way I can present her personality really is to tell you about after we came to\nAmerica because I think it must have been worse in France. My mother imagined\nherself a really aristocratic lady -- that\u2019s the way she thought of herself. When my\naunt Lena and -- actually it was her kids who came with her -- brought us from\nthe boat to her house --. She lived in the lower East Side and I was sitting next to\nmy mother in the back seat and my brother was sitting next to me. As we drove\ninto the lower East Side with the push- carts and this sort of mass of humanity,\nmy mother whispered, for this I\u2019ve struggled all these years. I thought oh my G-\nd, what a terrible thing to say. Even though maybe I was also feeling part of that,\nmaybe I was worried that someone was going to hear or what but she just --. We\nlived with my aunt for three months. My aunt got sick at one point and in\nretrospect we should have been really grateful for being put up. I think my\nmother really was very grateful but at the same time, when my aunt got sick and\nneeded somebody to make her a cup of tea, my mother had no idea how to make a\ncup of tea because she\u2019d been so --. Part of that had to be a put-up job because in\nFrance, in those two years, everybody was struggling making meals and so on. I\nthink it was more maybe when she was asked to make cereal or something, she\nhad never done that, she hadn\u2019t a clue and so on. But she was a very giving\nperson and so when we finally got an apartment after three months and I think she\nwas earning $35 or $45 a month, something like that -- no wait a minute -- what\nwas she earning? She was earning $15 a week, that\u2019s what it was and the rent was\n$45 a month. She would buy things for us. Sometimes she\u2019d even come home\nwith a little treat for us and she was living on toast and tomatoes. It was all for us.\nShe wore black for years and years and years; it wasn\u2019t until -- I don\u2019t know when\nit happened that she would occasionally put on something red; but for years --.\nThen there was that whole struggle of when I tried to put on something black.\nShe would say there will be time enough for that, don\u2019t wear -- if you have to\nwear black, put on a flower or something like that. She often complained about\nher state in life and I don\u2019t blame her but she didn\u2019t have any guidance. She could\nhave had a fantastically better life, she could have been a fantastic bookkeeper but\nnobody guided her so she ended up leading her life in the factories which she\nhated. It wasn\u2019t so much the work as it was the demeaning atmosphere. She felt\nthat she was with these uneducated, boorish people who -- I think occasionally\neven people made passes at her which she found --. She was so Victorian that\neven when she was in the nursing home -- no it wasn\u2019t the nursing home. It was\nwhen she was living in a senior citizens\u2019 thing, when we moved her up to\nBrookline and she belonged to some golden age club. I think she was 80 by then.\nOne day she called me up and it was raining and she said, some 80 -year- old man\noffered her a ride back to her apartment. I said good, did you take 1t? Who do you\nthink I am? Would I take a ride with a strange man? So she had this image of\nherself, she never would have thought of getting remarried. She wouldn\u2019t, the\nidea of, no man was allowed to touch her except my father. She had a terrible\ntime getting used to America because one time she came in for a job interview or\nsomething and the boss was sitting on his chair with his feet up on the desk.\nWell, she thought that that was treating her in a terrible way or for example, when\npeople would call her by her first name without being invited. In Vienna she was\nFrau Doctor Reif and the least she expected was to be Mrs. Reif. She had a lot of\nthose -- she was just very European. But she also -- she adapted very well in\nother ways. She got to be really good at shopping and knowing where to get\nbargains. She was very, she was always very energetic. It\u2019s just that she didn\u2019t\nalways channel her energy. Like when she went to work in New York in the\nmorning, she would get up I think at six in the morning in order to be able to\nleave the house at a quarter to eight. During that time, she must have expended, I\nmean you could have built a house with the amount of energy she expended just\nin the process of getting herself dressed, makeup and a hat and hat pins, stockings\nand shoes and all these things. Then she\u2019d get to Manhattan and take it all off and\nput on some work clothes that she had at the factory. Then she\u2019d put it all back\non to take the subway back home. What else do you want to know?",
        "Q: I think that\u2019s painting a very nice picture and I think we definitely know --\nbecause we have the story line.",
        "A: Let me add one more thing because I don\u2019t want to leave you with the wrong\nimpression. She also, she was very good- natured like she\u2019d play cards with me,\nif I was bored, she\u2019d play cards with me.- Or if I needed to memorize a poem for\nschool, even though she was exhausted, she would sit up in bed at night and have\nme recite over and over again. Was that IF by Roger Kipling, I just remember\nthat one in particular, but many things like that; she was really very good about\nalways trying to do things to try to make me happy. I think there was a really fun\nloving person there that never got to come out because of the way life went.",

    "answers": [
        "A: I don\u2019t really know anything about his family. The only things I can say about\nmy father is that -- first of all, apparently he was a pretty good daddy. Apparently\nhe really wanted very much to have a daughter and so he was apparently very\nhappy when I was born, as a girl. I think he was probably a fairly serious person\nbut I think he was probably less way out than either of his children -- in the sense\nthat I think he was serious about his professional pursuits but he also apparently\nenjoyed going to the opera and so on. I guess he and my mother bought sort of\npopular music records of the day and so I don\u2019t think -- I have a feeling that he\nwas not like an ultra intellectual type but very serious about his work.",
        "A: He went to school in Vienna, that\u2019s all I really know. Then he actually was in the\nwar during World War I and he was wounded. He was in the Austrian army and\nhe was wounded at the Russian front. Actually I\u2019ll take you on a three -minute\ntour to show you a certificate that he got for that. That happened during his\nmedical training apparently and then he went back and --.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes and apparently he was the only one of the children who did anything\nprofessional.",
        "A: Well, I know about the two who are in New York and my Aunt Lena came here I\nthink in the 1920\u2019s; got married and she and her husband owned a hardware store.\nThe other, the Uncle Max brother owned what was called a luncheonette in New\nYork which was a place with a fountain. You could get sandwiches or a sundae\nor something like that. I think he probably was different within his own family,\ndifferent from all the others. My brother felt that he had -- my brother liked him\nbecause he was serious and he would bring him books to read and things like that.\nI think he also took my brother ice -skating, for example, which my brother\napparently hated. I think he had a variety of things that he liked to do and he did\ngo dancing with my mother. As a matter of fact, I grew up with this funny thing.\nI thought that all people in Vienna ever did was to go ballroom dancing in white\ngowns and tails for the men. Actually I love to do that; my husband and I do a lot\nof ballroom dancing in evening gowns and tails. I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s a\nconnection there but I think he was quite a serious person. I think he really liked\nhis work. I think he was a good dentist. I think he was serious and interested in\nhis patients.",
        "A: As far as I know, he always ran the practice out of our house. There was\nsomething else I was going to say, but it just eluded me. No, it wasn\u2019t because\nyou interrupted it\u2019s just because I\u2019m so forgetful. Well, I don\u2019t remember what I\nwas going to say but I don\u2019t really know very much else about my father. I think\nhe was probably a gentle, kindly sort of person. I think he was rather good-\nlooking. He looks good-looking when he was young. I have a picture of him\naround a cadaver on a dissecting table and he was rather good-looking then. But\nthen later on he got kind of stocky and I don\u2019t know, to my mind, that didn\u2019t look\ntoo great on him.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t have any particular memories of my own. I know that in the\nsummers we used to go to the country and he would come on weekends. I know\nmy brother, to this day, still talks about those things in a somewhat mocking way,\nabout how many suitcases and porters my mother needed to go on those trips. I\nguess that\u2019s really about all I can say. I know it seems weird to me how\ncircumstances shape people\u2019s lives and about the fact that my father was in the\nAustrian army. If he had been sensible to come to the United States earlier, that\nhe would have been probably in the American army because you know he would\nhave been in that age group where he still would have gotten drafted. You\u2019re sort\nof a pawn of the country that you\u2019re born in, in a funny kind of way.",
        "A: Yes, right. That\u2019s -- I guess that\u2019s about all I know. I think he was a rather\nserious person although I don\u2019t think he\u2019s as serious a person as my brother has\nturned out to be, maybe. I guess that\u2019s about all I can say unless I think of\nsomething later.",

        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay. My mother\u2019s name was Klara Gottfried Reif. G-o-t-t-f-r-1-e-d,. She was\nborn in a small town in Poland, not far from Lemberg which is now called Lvov.\nShe was apparently somewhat of a rambunctious young lady. She often said that\nshe -- I guess she didn\u2019t get along with her father as well as with her mother. She\nliked to run around and travel and do a lot of things. She spoke several languages\nbecause when she was a child, the borders kept changing and so at one point,\nwhere she was born, was part o Austria. I think both she and my father were\nactually Austrian citizens because when they were born, Poland was a part of\nAustria, then the Russians came in. She spoke Polish, Russian, German; I think\nshe spoke some Czechoslovakian and she might have been conversant with a\ncouple of other languages. She always said she spoke five or seven languages, I\nnever remember whether it\u2019s five or seven.",
        "A: I think at home, they probably spoke a combination of Polish and Yiddish. Yeah,\nI think that was correct. My mother did a lot of traveling around. She used to go\nto Lemberg to have clothes made and so on. I think she went off to school at\nsome point also.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. No, it was definitely not a technical school and I don\u2019t really know.\nI have a feeling it might have been more like a finishing school or just some kind\nof general school. She definitely finished gymnasium but did not go to college\nbut she was pretty clever. She was very, very good with numbers and she did a\nlot of reading. Anyway at some -- I think she was very interested when she was\nyoung in fashion and that kind of thing. At some point she went off to Vienna\neither for a vacation or to have clothes made, I don\u2019t know. Somehow and I don\u2019t\nknow how, but she met my father. Ultimately they got engaged and then they got\nmarried, I think in 1925.",
        "A: They got married in Vienna, well, I\u2019m not sure about that. I\u2019m not sure about\nthat, they might have gone back to Poland to get married. But anyway, they lived\nin Vienna after they got married. Then in 1927, my brother was born. Now my\nmother tells me about her life in Vienna. She said in the beginning it was kind of\nhard. My father had been trained as a physician and then he went back and\nretrained as a dentist and he opened his practice. Now one of the things my\nmother always told me is that we lived in Este , that\u2019s the first district in\nVienna. I guess that was not such a nice -- or the nicest part of Vienna.\nExcuse me, the Este is where she would have liked to live\nShe said that the reason they lived there was because my father\u2019s office was in our\nhouse and that\u2019s where he saw patients. It was for reasons of the business that we\nlived there. We lived actually, I guess, right overlooking the Danube. So in the\nearly years, she said things were difficult and she helped my father. She would do\nthings like answer the phone and maybe help prep patients and various other\nthings. I guess my father did pretty well fairly quickly and so things kind of\nperked up. I think things were quite comfortable. We had -- I know there were\nabout six people who used to come and go in terms of \u201cservants.\u201d There was a\ncook who did our meals. My brother and I each had a governess when we were\nkids.\nA Yeah, we are very far apart so it wasn\u2019t concurrent. There were one or two\nwomen who came in to do laundry. You know in those days everything was a big\ndeal. I mean coming in to do the laundry was taking the sheets and boiling them\nup with soap and Clorox and so on and so forth. It was kind of a big thing and\nthen even --. We did actually have a vacuum cleaner and I personally remember\nthat these two cleaning women used to come and they would roll up the rugs and\ntake them up to the roof with these bamboo, oddly shaped paddles and beat the\nhell out of the rugs. There were these servants around and at that point I think my\nmother sort of became a lady of leisure. Again I don\u2019t know which of these\nstories are true or apocryphal but her role was to put on a white glove after the\nservants came and go around to make sure that they had cleaned well. I think she\nwent and I think they did a fair amount of socializing. I think they went to the\nopera and they would go dancing and go to the theater. I know they went --\napparently once a week they went to play cards with this relative who actually --\nthe daughter lives in New York now. They must have done a lot of things like\nthat. I think my father was a fairly serious person and my mother was probably a\nmore -- I don\u2019t know, a more frivolous person. Actually my brother apparently\ndidn\u2019t do very well with my mother because he was a very serious kid and he\nreally liked my father. But he thought my mother wasted her time even when he\nwas very little. Then --.\nA Yeah go ahead.",
        "A: I think her parents were orthodox. I don\u2019t know that my mother really -- I mean\nmy mother always did all the very traditional kinds of things but I\u2019m not sure she\nreally believed in any of that. I don\u2019t know, she certainly had some sorts of\nsuperstitions involved in Jewish religion but I have a funny feeling that she\nprobably went along with the things. I don\u2019t think she and my father had -- we\ndidn\u2019t have a kosher house and we --. I think they did go to services on the high\nholidays and things like that. I\u2019d be curious to know whether we -- I\u2019m sure we\nate matzo on Passover but the real question is did we also eat bread? I don\u2019t\nknow what the answer is.",
        "A: Right, right. Well, I\u2019m sure we ate ham. I\u2019m absolutely sure we ate ham. We\nprobably didn\u2019t eat bread at Passover but it was not -- I don\u2019t think it was terribly\ncompulsive. I think it was fairly casual. I have a feeling that her father was\nprobably not very casual and I don\u2019t know about her mother. I have a feeling that\nthe mother was a more worldly woman and the father may have been a more sort\nof retiring religious kind of person. I think that my mother always felt that she\nwas considered the black sheep. Not by her mother, but by her father, that her\nfather didn\u2019t like her as well as he liked the other two kids. I think she thought\nthat was because she was sort of rebellious and didn\u2019t do the things that the other\nkids did. Definitely, my mother\u2019s brother and sister sound like more traditional\nkids. They got married and they had kids and they stayed, I think, in the same\ntown, or nearby. Here was this young chick going off to Vienna and marrying\nstrange people.",
        "A: Yeah, well, in 1946, when I would have been 12 and I remember this very\ndramatically. There was a blue letter that came from somebody, one of her\nrelatives. I think it might have been this guy called, Moshe Weinhaub who went\nto live in Israel and whose son is in Israel and is a physician, I think. Of course, I\nlost contact after my mother died. I think the letter was from this guy Moshe\nWeinhaub. It told in very great detail what happened to all the relatives. Well,\nthey all perished in one form or another. Now my mother\u2019s sister, that was the\nmost dramatic thing. Apparently they forced her to watch while they threw her\nkids into an oven and then they shot her. That was really a horror story. I think\nmy mother\u2019s brother and maybe the parents -- I remember him describing that a\nlot of people in the camp had typhoid. They purposely tried to contract typhoid\nand they did so they died of the typhoid. They purposely did that because they\ndidn\u2019t want to die in what they knew was awaiting them. There were just\ndescriptions of what happened to everybody that he knew about. I don\u2019t know\nwhatever happened to that letter. As a matter of fact, 1t\u2019s really weird. This is my\nmother\u2019s -- those two pieces of furniture are my mother\u2019s. Since my mother died.\nI have not been able to find the key to this. Every once in a while, I try to get it\nopen because I keep thinking that maybe there are some letters and things in\nthere. I know I could probably get a locksmith to open it but I probably have\nmixed feelings. Part of me wants to know what\u2019s behind those little doors and\npart of me probably doesn\u2019t. But anyway, my mother -- I think my mother was a\nvery, very different person after the war from what she was before. Although I\ncan\u2019t really judge that, that\u2019s kind of a guess.",
        "A: Right, 1927, April 24, 1927. My brother was apparently a very serious little boy\neven at age two. My mother always told stories about how when she would go\nfor a walk with him, instead of wanting to sort of play and so on, he would want\nto have her read the street signs. What does that say, how do you spell that, what\nare the letters? And so on. That\u2019s her perception. My brother -- I have a picture\nof my brother sitting all dressed up with a little Lord Fauntleroy tie in a sandbox\nwith his rear end up -- sort of off the sand so he wouldn\u2019t get himself dirty. My\nbrother sort of tells, with some resentment, that he wasn\u2019t allowed to be a little\nboy because they dressed him up and he always felt he couldn\u2019t get dirty. I think\nthere were a lot of interesting dynamics there. Then at age three, they started him\non violin lessons. Somehow it didn\u2019t work out so they stopped at the advice of the\nteacher, I guess. Then he started again at the age five. Then it really took hold\nvery well and he really did play the violin. If you ask him, he\u2019Il say, well you\nknow, I\u2019m not -- I can\u2019t really play very well. But he really plays. I mean for an\namateur, he plays extremely well. Then when my father died -- well first my\nfather got very depressed because, well, because things were obviously looking\nvery bad in Europe. I really should back up. Starting in 1933. I think things\nstarted being politically very hairy. People had just come out of a Depression. As\nan aside, all my life, I was always really bothered that I might have been an\naccident because I\u2019m seven and a half years younger than my brother.\nSubliminally that always bothered me and I never had the guts to ask anybody\nwhich in retrospect seems silly. But actually I was over forty once when I asked\nmy brother, was I an accident? My brother said, no, absolutely not. Why did they\nwait so long? Because of the Depression. I was born in 1934, in November and\nso things were --. Now as I think back on it, it was a really dumb time to have a\nkid because things were not looking good. Did I send you the article I wrote for\nBoston Magazine?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t send you one from Boston Magazine? I should give that to you because\nthat\u2019s sort of about this subject. Anyway, so then I was born, and then things\nstarted getting bad. They got worse and worse. My father and mother started\ntalking about the possibility of going to America. Apparently my father just felt -\n- in 1934 my father was already forty years old, right? So his feeling was, how\ncan I go to America? I don\u2019t know the language; I would have to retrain. We\nwould get there and we would have nothing so it just didn\u2019t seem like a\nreasonable thing to do. But then in August of 1938, I think it was, my father, like\neverybody else, had to close because Jews were not allowed to work any more.\nMy father got really, really, very, very depressed. My brother, I think my brother\nreally still has and had all the time, a really tremendous resentment about my\nmother not handling that right. I\u2019ve asked him about that and he says well, she\nused to say well you know you got to come out of this. You can\u2019t walk around\nlike this. She would kind of go off then and do whatever needed to be done. I\nsaid to my brother, well what did you do? He said, well I remember standing in a\ndark room holding his hand, just quietly. Now that I\u2019m at my present age and our\nkids are 22 and 24, I realize that it was just a very difficult situation for my\nmother. How, if somebody else is just very depressed all the time and you really\ndon\u2019t know how to get the person out of it, I think after a while maybe it\u2019s kind of\na survival thing. That you\u2019ve got to just keep doing what are your daily things\nbecause otherwise you\u2019re going to go insane also. I don\u2019t know what was going\non there but it was a really bad scenario, really very unpleasant things were\nhappening to Jews. I\u2019m sure that my father must have been extremely frightened.\nThere\u2019s a woman who actually went to medical and then dental school with my\nfather. We were always friendly with that family. For example, that woman was\nforced to go out and scrub the streets and things like that. All sorts of demeaning\nthings happening and I think it must have been just a terrible, terrible time\npsychologically.\nA Yes, I think he did work regularly.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I think he got very depressed after he had to close his\npractice. Now I don\u2019t know that for sure, I just know that from things that I\u2019ve\ngathered. Anyway, my mother, I think, tried to keep going about her business.\nSomewhere in this time span, they did decide that they would have to leave. So\nthey went and applied for visas and passports and so on. On the morning of\nSeptember 30, 1938, my father and mother actually left the house together to go\npick up those passports. They picked up the passports and at about noontime,\nthey parted to do separate chores. They were supposed to meet, I think, at the\nhome of this cousin where they used to play cards. Apparently my father never\ngot there. I guess at about 2:30 in the afternoon, I seem to remember somebody\ntelling me, there was a phone call. My father had been found at the bottom of a\nstaircase. I\u2019m not sure whether he was already dead or whether he died either on\nthe way to the hospital or right after he got to the hospital. But the death\ncertificate says he died of multiple fractures including a fractured skull and lots of\nfractured ribs. All my life, I grew up thinking that he had thrown himself off the\ntop floor, the fourth floor of this -- down the stairwell. There was a lot of trauma\naround that. My mother did not want -- so the general consensus was that he had\ncommitted suicide. My mother did not want anybody to know that and I don\u2019t\nunderstand. You know, it\u2019s funny, children don\u2019t ask the right questions all the\ntime. I just took that on gospel and I never, ever said anything until quite recently\nabout that. I never told it; I mean practically no one did I tell this to. When I was\ndiscussing with my brother recently, he said, well, I\u2019ve never kept this a secret.\nThen a few years ago, when I started really thinking about this; I started thinking,\nwell, now how do we know he committed suicide? People say you\u2019re just trying\nto protect yourself from this sort of thing. First of all, I don\u2019t have anything\nagainst this, I just don\u2019t. It wouldn\u2019t -- in general it wouldn\u2019t bother me now. I\nkeep asking myself, does it bother me if he did commit suicide. I suppose in one\nway it doesn\u2019t bother me and in another way I think well this was sort of a\nshirking of your responsibility. You know you had two kids and this was not the\nappropriate thing to do, to leave your wife alone with these two kids. My\nbrother\u2019s idea is that my father probably did commit suicide and that one of the\nreasons that he did it, aside from being depressed and aside from -- I mean people\nwere committing suicide right and left -- was that he probably figured that a\nwoman with two children would have a much better chance of escaping if there\nwas no husband around. At that time, mostly it was the men who were being\nreally harassed, initially. I don\u2019t know but now as a scientist, I sort of stop and I\nthink, well there was nobody there to see this. All sorts of horrible things were\nhappening to Jews, how do we know what really happened? Could he have been\npushed? I think the chances are 90% that he probably did commit suicide. The\nother thing is that I keep thinking why would somebody with a medical profession\nwho has access to much neater, cleaner ways of committing suicide throw himself\noff a stairwell. That\u2019s another reason why I think that maybe he didn\u2019t do it\nhimself. On the other hand, I suppose that when people commit suicide they\u2019re\nnot necessarily being totally rational.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know but somebody recently pointed out to me that Primo Levi who was\nalso a scientist and also had more sophisticated means of committing suicide\napparently also jumped off something or other.",
        "A: But anyway, the answer is I don\u2019t know what happened. When this happened, my\nmother was just totally devastated, just --.",
        "A: No, go ahead. I don\u2019t mind.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember very much about her except --. I remember a few silly\nthings like I used to like to go into the kitchen and dry the dishes for the cook.\nThe cook would stand me up on a little stool and hand me one dish at a time and I\nwould dry it. I also liked to iron. You know in those days there was no electric\niron so they had those irons that you kind of had to keep putting on the stove until\nthey get hot. I used to like to iron and my mother really didn\u2019t like me to do those\nthings. I loved to do those things. Maybe she was already overly protective\nbefore the war, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t like to iron. I don\u2019t mind but I don\u2019t like to iron and I hate to dry\ndishes. As a matter of fact, I think my mother used to kid me about because then -\n-. When we came to New York and she wanted to help with those things she\nwould tease me and say you used to love to do it when I didn\u2019t want you to. Now\nwhen I want you to, you don\u2019t want to do it. Well, it seems to me that it\u2019s fairly\nself evident that it would be that way. Do I remember anything else about her?\nYou know, I actually remember more about my interactions with the governess\nand the servants. For example, the things I remember about the servants is that\nthey were fun for me. The reasons they were fun was that they would come in\nand do all these routine things. Like we had a very long hallway because the\napartment was two 7- room apartments with the wall broken down between them\nso there were 14 rooms. They all went off this long hallway. We had this rug,\nrunner-rug, so they would roll that up every time they came. I don\u2019t know\nwhether it was every day or every other day or whatever. They would let me sit\non the end of the runner. Then they would start rolling it, pull, roll, pull, so I\u2019d\nget aride. Or if they were sweeping the floor, they\u2019d let me put my feet on the\nbroom and sweep with me. Or swing me back and forth and things like that.\nThose were kind of exciting things for me and I think my governess had a cot in\nmy room. I remember her being there; I remember it was kind of a probably\nconsoling feeling that -- I don\u2019t know whether she was there all the time or what.\nI don\u2019t ever remember the kind of thing of being left alone. But then early on, I\nthink I did get left alone at night to sleep because my brother tells me I was an\nabsolute royal pain, that I used to scream through the nights. The governess\nwould not let my mother come to me. I don\u2019t really remember a lot about my\nmother in those days and I certainly do not remember my father. The funny thing\nis I remember my father but then one day, when I must have been about ten or\nsomething, looking at this picture of my father that my mother always had on her\nnight table and suddenly realizing that the real memory of my father had been\ntaken over by the memory of the picture. I no longer had that real memory that I\nhad originally. I remember my room in Vienna and I think I remember the dining\nroom and I certainly remember the kitchen.",
        "A: Well the dining room, I seem to remember, it was kind of very formal and dark.\nIt seemed dark in there. I don\u2019t know whether because there were curtains drawn\nor something. We did have in New York the table that was in that dining room.\nIt was a dark, probably mahogany or something, massive. The furniture we had\nin Vienna was the sort of massive thing that was popular in the 1930\u2019s. I just\nremember the big table in the middle and looking in there and it was -- just\nremember a sort of formal feeling. The kitchen was sort of light and airy; there\nwas this white --. In Vienna there were no built in closets and so people had --\nthey were called wardrobes. In the kitchen there was a white lacquered big\nwardrobe with two doors that opened with keys, these kinds if old fashioned keys.\nI think the cook had like dish towels in there. One memory that became very\nimportant for Kristallnacht -- she had -- and actually I have one upstairs. There\nwere these little things you could buy, pasteels they were called. They were sort\nof awful tasting things, minty or something. They came in either single boxes or\ntriple boxes. I don\u2019t know if they were double sized ones but they were sort of\ngreen and gold cans. The cook had a triple sized one of those in that white closet.\nWhenever she had extra goshen which are the equivalent of pennies she would\nput them into that can. There must have been some connection to me about that\ncan. I don\u2019t know what it could have been, maybe she bought me things with\nthose occasionally or something. But anyway, there was this long hallway and I\nremember my room quite well.. My room had a nice window which I think\noverlooked the river. Then there was a dresser over there with a stuffed animal on\nit and then my crib which was not like an American crib but had -- the part that\ngoes up and down had a mesh of sort of ropes going both ways. That was the way\ncribs were made in that time, I think. Then there was this cot that the governess\nused to maybe nap on or whatever. I don\u2019t think it was a very big room but I sort\nof liked that room. Then I remember my father\u2019s office, my father\u2019s examining\nroom. I remember the linoleum on the floor and that becomes important for later\nwhen we back to Vienna in 1963 and I recognized that. But anyway so then the\nnext -- my big memory is the night of Kristallnacht. My mother was holding me\nup in her arms and my brother was holding -- of course my father was dead by\nnow -- my brother was holding on to my mother\u2019s skirt. There was this loud\nknock on the door and my mother said who\u2019s there and the superintendent was\nthere. Now I only remember the superintendent and one other man. But my\nbrother says there were actually five or six men who came. My mother went to\nopen the little metal thing on the glass peephole and this guy smashed the glass\nwith the back of a revolver. The superintendent said, let us in Mrs. Reif, we\nwon\u2019t hurt you. They came in and I remember being in the kitchen. The only\nreally strong memory I have is of them taking that can full of coins. They took,\nthey helped themselves to everything, all the radios, anything that was of any\nvalue, they took. Although before that, interestingly, apparently either my mother\nor some relative -- my father as a dentist had hunks of gold because in those days\na lot of fillings were made with gold. Somebody went and dumped those in the\nbottom of the Danube. Whatever else was valuable in the house, these people\nhelped themselves to. I do think I remember one of the guys having a radio or\nsomething in his hand. But the thing that I, as a little girl, felt most resentful\nabout was that they took away this box of coins. They left and then I don\u2019t\nremember anything else about Vienna, I don\u2019t think. I think I may remember the\nlittle suit that I wore when we got on to the ship, the San Luee but I\u2019m not sure\nwhether I remember that or I remember a picture that we have. I actually have\nthat outfit still. I remember one other thing. After Kristallnacht, somehow, I\ndon\u2019t know how it happened, but my mother managed to get these tickets to get\non the San Luee. The reason we got first class passage was because you were\nonly allowed to take, I think it was like four dollars a person, out of the country\n.My mother figured, what the hell, we might as well go first class. We had to\npack up stuff. You were allowed to send things away.",
        "A: Yes, but there regulations and I have a feeling that some things got smuggled in.\nFor example, a bunch of sterling silver flatware was in that van and I think that\nwas strictly forbidden if I have read my history correctly. But anyway my mother\nwas not very -- my mother was really devastated -- I was going to say she wasn\u2019t\nvery functional but she obviously managed all right. I think other people came\nand kind of had to help her do things. There was a -- my brother had met another\nboy called Irwin Kleinfeld who\u2019s now a mathematician at the University of Iowa\nin lowa City. Through that friendship, our parents kind of got to know his\nparents. The father was a lawyer and somehow he came and helped my mother\nout with various things. The day this enormous van pulled up in front of our\nbuilding, he was there helping my mother get stuff packed into this van. I think\nmy mother was not doing very well and he kind of said, take this, take that. I\ndon\u2019t know who made the final decisions, I have a feeling that he made a lot of\nthem. There were some really weird things in this van, just really weird. For\nexample, we had one room in Vienna that was totally covered apparently in\nmirrors. It was made out of these tiles that were about eight inches wide by about\nfourteen inches high. One of the things that came out of this van, when we got it\nin New York three years later, was all these mirrors. Now what did anybody\nthink we were going to do with these mirrors! So that was in there. Weird things,\non my second birthday, I had been bought a very special doll. That doll arrived in\nNew York, speaking of traumatizing kids, it was hung by the neck from the bar\ninside one of the wardrobes with all the clothes and so on. This guy, I remember\nthat day, I remember this guy coming and I remember these things going out into\nthis van. That van went to New York and it sat in a warehouse which I think was\npaid for by my aunt Lena or maybe we sent -- I don\u2019t know. Then I don\u2019t\nremember that trip except for being seasick. Then we were sent back to Europe\nand we went to France. That\u2019s where my memories start again. The first thing\nthat happened was -- am I on track? -- 1s this the kind of stuff you want to hear?",
        "A: The thing that I remember is that my mother -- my remembrance of my mother\nwas that she was, to a large extent for years and years, in a state of -- I don\u2019t know\nwhat to call it -- in a state of somebody who\u2019s just been through a catastrophe\nwhich she had been. It\u2019s just that most people seem to recover more rapidly and\nshe just did not recover. She recovered effectively in that she always seemed to\ndo the right thing to get to the next step but emotionally she never recovered. So\nmy recollection of my mother through most of these years is that she was often a\nvery sad person, it was like a lot of sighing and just this unhappy demeanor on her\nface, for years. She also, in later years, some of that lifted and she could be a real\nfun person sometimes. It was almost weird and I couldn\u2019t even begin to go\nthrough this until very recently. But now I have a feeling that if somebody had\nsomehow just let her or encouraged her, she could have been a really vibrant\ndazzling lady. Occasionally she would dance with me, not very often but\noccasionally. She was very good in later years like after I met Sam and we got\nmarried and everything. She was always game for anything, fly on a jet; yeah, PI\nfly on a jet. She didn\u2019t have any of these hang-ups like other parents of my\ncontemporaries. You know, they wouldn\u2019t ride an escalator. She came, even\nwhen she was sixty, she climbed with us in Yosemite but there was always this\nreal sadness. I remember once when she was already starting to get Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease, she said this to me very often but this particular time I remember it very\ndramatically. She said, I\u2019ve only had thirteen good years in my whole life and\nthose were the first thirteen years with my father is what she was referring to. We\nwere not very nice children to her. We were extremely hard on her for many\nreasons. First of all, my brother thought she was frivolous, I probably thought she\nwas a little frivolous also although she was very sad and serious. She always\nseemed to be concerned about things that -- I don\u2019t know how we got to be so\nlofty thinking but she always seemed to be concerned with things that we felt\nwere not terribly important. One would say that there was friction because we\njust totally lorded it over her. It was really, as I think back on it now, was a very\nstrange situation.",
        "A: Is it going now?",
        "A: Okay. She was very, very encouraging of our studying and doing well for\nourselves but she didn\u2019t demand enough for herself. I can say this in retrospect.\nFor example, my brother had a room to himself in New York -- I\u2019m skipping\nahead now but -- and I didn\u2019t. I shared a room with her and I did my homework\nin the kitchen. She\u2019d come home tired from work, she would make dinner, she\nwould clean up and then I had the audacity to tell her that she couldn\u2019t run the\nwater to wash the dishes while I was doing my homework. She went along with\nthat! That was really -- in retrospect that was sort of amazing. She should have\ntold me where to get off. She did get after me to help often and I sometimes tried\nto help a little but I -- it\u2019s funny you know now, do you have children?",
        "A: You see this thing reflected in your children. I mean she would say, would you\ndry the dishes? I would say yes Ill dry the dishes as soon as I finish my\nhomework. Then she would say -- she couldn\u2019t wait till I finished because she\nwas very methodical about all the household things. So she would dry the dishes,\nso most of the time I never got to do it. I would have done it if she had waited but\nshe couldn\u2019t wait. Now as a parent I can sense that irritation of I want it done\nnow and the kid wants to do it later. It\u2019s just that I sort of know enough to know\nthat if I really don\u2019t want to do it and I want the kid to do it, you just leave it and\nlet the kid do it later.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. She actually, she was fantastic with her hands. In Europe\nwhen she was a lady of leisure she did embroidery, that\u2019s what ladies did. She did\nthat whole thing, that\u2019s all silk petite point. It took her two years to do that. We\nwere such terrible kids. We both used to tease her about why did you spend all\nthis time doing this really disgusting-looking scene? Why didn\u2019t you at least pick\nsome --? First of all, now it\u2019s still looks like --. I still think why did she spend all\nthis time doing this scene but it doesn\u2019t look as bad as it used to look. Now I\nreally appreciate the time and the energy and the devotion and the workmanship.\nThere are lots of things around the house that she did. Later on it became things\nthat we tried to get her to do to keep her busy. She didn\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know\nhow she did this in Vienna. I think in Vienna she probably picked this up\nwhenever she had time and then put it down and so on. In the time that I really\nknew her, she didn\u2019t know how to relax except to read. She did a lot of reading.\nI\u2019m not always sure that -- she read in a funny way. She did not read like an\neducated person. She read in a way that was non-analytical. We, the children,\nwho both turned out to be Ph.D. scientists found this really weird.",
        "A: Well the best way and this may even be an unfair way to say but one of the things\nthat I remember and this had nothing to do with reading but rather with a movie,\nshe was here baby sitting for us. She had seen a movie called \u2018I Never Sang For\nMy Father\u2019. My husband and I were going out to see it that night. When we\ncame home, almost simultaneously my husband and I said boy, what a miserable\nfather. At the same moment she said, wasn\u2019t that a miserable son? I\u2019m sure it\ncould be interpreted both ways but I think any -- if you looked at the critics which\nI don\u2019t think I ever did of that movie -- I think the whole point of that movie is\nthat here is a parent who is manipulating the son in such a way that the son\u2019s life\nbecomes ruined. My mother totally missed that, all she could see was the bad\nson, not being nice to the daddy.",
        "A: Or for example, after our kids were born, I would keep giving her books to read\nabout child rearing. Every time she finished one, she\u2019d say, ah, this is really\ninteresting. This is great. I wish I had known about this when you were small.\nBut then ten minutes later she would go and totally interact by her gut reaction\nrather than by what she had just read about. We would get into some really\nridiculous arguments, she and I. Later on, after I got my Ph.D. and got a job,\nbecause she worked like a mad dog in the factories -- she had incredible pride in\nher work. She not only did what she had to do but she worked harder because she\nwanted everything to be just right. We pretty much had to insist that she retire\nand my brother and I each gave her money. Well, she never could feel\ncomfortable with getting money from us. We would say look, you struggled like\nmad to support us. Did we ever complain about that? No, we just took the money\nand we lived happily ever after. Now it\u2019s your turn to have a good time and\nretire. We are doing quite well, we are in no way being hurt by giving you this\nmoney. Why don\u2019t you just take the money and enjoy it. You\u2019ve had a really\nhard life, now\u2019s the time to have a good time. She could never cope with that.\nEvery month when the checks came, there was a struggle about whether she was\ngoing to keep these checks. But then also when she did retire, she was lonesome,\nwhat was she going to do with her time? Sam and I used to devise these projects\nfor her to do. One time she said she really needed a bookcase. We bought her an\nunfinished bookcase and some varnish and shellac and the rest of it. We said well\nthis ought to keep her busy for a week or two. We told her how to do this and so\non. Two days later or three days later, she calls up, I finished the bookcase. What\ndo you mean, you finished the bookcase. You have to wait at least so many hours\nin between. She said, oh I did. It said wait five hours so I set the alarm clock\nwhen I went to sleep and at five hours I got up and I put on the next coat and so\non. Everything was like something she had to do. All right, I\u2019ll give her\nsomething better to do so I gave her this enormous piece of rug mesh, to hook a\nrug which is now hanging on our wall. I thought well this has got to keep her\nbusy for a while. After a few weeks, she came back. It was all finished. She\nsaid, you know this was really very hard. My hands were bleeding along the sides\nfrom working on this. Everything we tried to do to occupy her time in a nice way\n-- but on the other hand she also did very well. She must have gone to every free\nconcert in New York and free plays and so on. She would start talking to younger\npeople, other people found her very delightful because they didn\u2019t have to grow\nup with her. So none of those irritations were there but it was very hard for her to\nmake friends. The only people that she made friends with were other ladies like\nher from Vienna. It was hard to find those as the years went on. Even with those\npeople, she was very critical and so if they did something wrong, she would get\nvery annoyed or insulted or --. You were going to ask something?",
        "A: She did speak German with them, yeah. She did speak German with us for a long\ntime. I think in the later years, after our kids were born, she probably spoke more\nEnglish. When we first came here, she had all these books and every night she\u2019d\ncome home from work, she\u2019d be exhausted. She would make dinner, she would\nclean up, she would get into bed, she would study her English. She was very\nthorough; she had these little notebooks about this size that she would keep.\nEvery night she would write down everything she spent that day in that notebook.\nShe would add it up and then she would count what was in her change purse and\nher wallet. If it was off by even one cent, even if 1t was late at night, she would\ngo through the whole thing as many times as it took, to balance that perfectly. It\ncould not be off by one penny. Then funny things happened. One time I\nremember -- you know how you get into silly discussions about -- she had bought\nme this dress and I said it cost so much and she said no, 1t was so much. She just\nwent and got her little thing of little books and looked it up and there it was with\nthe date and how much it was. Gray dress with white stripes. She was really, she\nwas almost compulsive about keeping the records. Every Saturday was cleaning\nday. Come heaven, hell or high water, the house got cleaned on Saturday from\ntop to bottom. I got involved in that and sometimes I felt resentful about that. It\nwas a gorgeous Saturday and from nine in the morning until three in the\nafternoon, we cleaned house -- washed the floors, everything. I want to go back\nto France, right?",
        "A: In France, my mother was not doing very well. With all the languages she could\nspeak, she never learned to speak French because she was just so emotionally\ndevastated and in France, when we first got to Ludern we lived in this hotel.\nThere were a whole bunch of about twenty refugees who were put up at this hotel.\nShe was really -- in addition to things being bad, she was upset about all sorts of\nminor things. Like in the kitchen of the hotel, there were cats and the cats were\nallowed to walk on the food table. Well, I get bothered about that also but under\nthose circumstances --. She went to ask the woman who ran the hotel where is\nthere a public bath. There was no bathroom, there were toilets but no bathroom in\nthis hotel. The woman didn\u2019t know. This blew my mother\u2019s mind, how could she\nnot know! This woman, like a lot of other French women, would put on a lot of\nperfume. My mother was always -- g-d, she must be filthy. I\u2019m sure she sponged\n-bathed and so on but anyway -- so my mother was really bothered by things like\nthat. I remember that hotel very well. Then after we had been there -- I had a\nlittle boyfriend whose name was Jacques Paul Berg and I just --.",
        "A: Right, and he apparently perished. I don\u2019t know what that meant having a little\nboyfriend but I think he was just my friend. We played together. Then the other\nthing I remember from that time, this was really weird stuff. I remember there\nwere these two girls who forced me to watch the hotel cooks kill a chicken in the\nback of the hotel. I just cried and cried, I was really upset. Just around the time\nof the San Luee reunion in 1989, I coincidentally met these two women who were\nthe two girls. They said well there weren\u2019t any other children so it must have\nbeen us. Yes, it sounds like the kind of thing we would have done. They\nactually, those people if you could get to interview them, it would be very\ninteresting, because those two sisters have diametrically opposite stories about\nwhat happened in France. Not the facts, but the attitudes are just diametrically\nopposite.",
        "A: Yes. First of all their unmarried last name was Isner. I-s-n-e-r. The younger one\nis Ruth Isner Kissinger and her husband is actually a first cousin of Henry\nKissinger. The other is Bella and she remarried. I don\u2019t remember what\nhappened to her husband. She\u2019s now Bella Isner Uhlfelder U-h-I-f-e-l-d-e-r.\nRuth Isner is, I found her very easy to talk to. Actually Bella was originally easier\nto talk to. Ruth is a more reticent person but Ruth has been much more\ncooperative with me about collecting stuff for my book. Bella got mad at me for\nsome really dodo thing at the reunion. Because I got up and announced that I was\ndoing this book and she accused me of making this very emotional thing into a\ncommercial affair. I don\u2019t know but anyway I have not gotten a story from Bella\nbut I have one from Ruth Isner. I think it will be very interesting to interview\nboth of these sisters.",
        "A: Yeah, they both live in --. No, she lives in New Jersey, Bella lives in, I think, the\nBronx or uptown Manhattan but somewhere in the 100\u2019s. Anyway, so we spend\nalmost a year there, just short of a year. Then one morning the Germans came in\nand took the town. I remember that because we woke up and they were parading\naround. Shooting into the air and just being generally very noisy. The thing that I\nremember was I was a very goody-goody little girl. I\u2019d always been taught, you\ndon\u2019t lie, you don\u2019t this, you don\u2019t that. I was told that no way was I allowed to let\non that I could speak German. The generals, I guess, actually came and lived in\nthe hotel so for about two weeks, we were together. I remember being totally -- I\nthought that this was really weird -- that you\u2019re not supposed to lie but here I am\nand I can understand everything all these guys say. Every time they talk to me\nI\u2019m standing there saying . My brother now tells me that one day my\nbrother just had his heart in his mouth because one of these guys came up to me,\nstarted to talk to me and my brother saw me start to answer in German. He\nbecame petrified and he said at the last minute, I suddenly must have\nremembered, and I said . But that was a very important time in my life\nbecause there was a young German soldier there. I don\u2019t really remember his face\nexcept it was a very nice face. He had sandy colored hair; I don\u2019t know if I could\nhave judged but as I think back he must have been 18 or 19. There was\nsomething very pleasing about this kid. Every morning they did these stupid\nmaneuvers around this hotel and we would watch from our window which looked\nout over the side. This guy would throw me candies and things; my mother was\nalways sure they were poisoned and didn\u2019t want me to eat them but you know I\ndidn\u2019t get stuff like that. So I ate it and here Iam. Then he ultimately gave me a\nlittle doll which I treasured for a long time. Now I don\u2019t know whether this is true\nor not but in my mind, that soldier was unbelievably important. Because when I\ncame to the United States, the kids -- well first of all kids are brutal. The kids\nwere really brutal. First of all everybody was making fun of me because I\ncouldn\u2019t speak English. Even some of the parents in the neighborhood in\nBrooklyn were not really very kindly which I find kind of shocking. The kids\nwould come over t me and even the adults and say, do you hate the Germans?\nEven as a kid, I was seven, I would say no, I don\u2019t hate the Germans. There are\ngood Germans and there are bad Germans. The reason I was able to say that must\nhave had to do -- probably also had to do with discussions with my brother -- but\nI think it had a lot to do with this soldier. It really wasn\u2019t until very recently that I\nstarted thinking. Well was this soldier -- well I always somehow, in my life,\nassumed that that soldier knew I was Jewish. But recently I thought,, well, did he\nknow? Maybe he didn\u2019t know, maybe he was just being nice to me because he\nthought I was a cute little Catholic kid. But the point 1s, it\u2019s irrelevant it\u2019s what\nthat guy represented to me, throughout my life whether it was real or not real.\nThat I think was incredibly important about that particular stage. Then there was\na lot of talk between my mother and my brother about what\u2019s to be done. You\ncan\u2019t stay here because I don\u2019t know how my mother managed to -- I mean my\nmother couldn\u2019t even talk one word in French. How could she carry this ruse on\nfor two weeks of us making believe that we couldn\u2019t speak German. I don\u2019t know\nhow we managed to get through that. Apparently, according to my mother, my\nmother says that my brother said to her one day, I\u2019m leaving here whether you\nleave or not. Now my brother doesn\u2019t quite remember saying anything quite so\ndramatic but in the meantime apparently my brother tells me that there are\nmeetings amongst these twenty refugees. As a group, they decided to get out.\nNow there was only one family, I heard about this for years, there was one family\nwho decided not to leave. I never knew who that was until 1989; it was this\nfamily, these sisters. That was obviously the wrong move because they didn\u2019t get\nout until \u00b046 or \u201947. We left all our stuff in this hotel except for a couple of pairs\nof underwear and my brother\u2019s violin. We went very late at night, I remember\nwalking to the train station. It was dark and I think it was midnight. We went to\nthe train station and I didn\u2019t remember that there were 20 of us or 18 of us or\nwhatever it was; I only remember my mother and my brother and me walking to\nthe train station. We took the train. My brother has filled me in on the funny\nthings that happened along the way and how we actually got across the border by\n-- it was just luck and a ruse. The next thing I remember 1s being in Limoges\nwhich is the town in southern France which is famous for it\u2019s china. I think that\nfirst night we actually must have slept in the railroad station and I slept on a scale.\nThere was a scale in the railroad station. Then we got put up and I thought it was\njust for one night but my brother says we were there for six weeks. You can see\nthat my memory 1s distorted compared to his. But we got put up in the concrete\nbleachers of a stadium for the circus.",
        "A: Then ultimately some people got together and rented these two rooms. The rooms\nwere each maybe about two or three times as big as this room. There were 30\nwomen in the room downstairs and I think I was the only child. We live in there\nfor several months and all the guys lived upstairs. I think my brother was the only\nchild upstairs, the only one of the men who was a boy.",
        "A: Nobody could do anything.",
        "A: I seem to remember them being pretty busy cleaning up. They were always\ncleaning up. In the nighttime we had these straw sacks that we put down on the\nfloor and we slept on. In the morning, we piled them up against the wall and\nthere were these crates, like orange crates and we\u2019d put those down as tables and\nchairs. People were always sweeping and cleaning and walking down, every\nmorning we walked down --. I was allowed to get about three inches worth of\nmilk in a coke-sized bottle. My mother made me share that with my brother. You\nhad to walk to the store and they measured this out, walk back. There were\nalways walks begging for bread in the bakery. That was my job, I think I told you\nabout that.",
        "A: Just last year, when I was interviewing my brother, I said to him, did anybody\nthink how demeaning this was to me? My brother looked at me and he said it\nwasn\u2019t demeaning, it was bread. I have a sign in my office that says that because\nit reminds me of something. Anyway that\u2019s where I went to school for the first\nyear. I think it was a very lonesome time for me. There weren\u2019t, somehow, I\ndon\u2019t think I played with the other kids after school. They lived some place else,\nwe were refugees which was probably not a nice thing to be.",
        "A: Well she interacted with the other women.",
        "A: She definitely interacted with the other women but I have a feeling that she may\nnot have been terribly popular. She was emotionally a downer a lot of the time,\nshe was always sad. A lot of other people -- I think that\u2019s true of my brother also.\nWhen we got on the San Luee, apparently mot people -- when the ship sailed\naway, and the captain said all right, these people are going to be treated like all\npeople who are on a tour, people were rejoicing and dancing and doing all these\nother things which my mother was not participating in. Which my brother, even\nthough he was about 11 or 12 at the time, said he was really bothered that these\npeople were being so insensitive. That they had left people behind in dire straits,\nthat they had just come from being in dire straits and it was not a time to dance or\nsing. Well my adult me can see it both ways; yeah, it\u2019s not a time to dance and\nsing. On the other hand, I can see where, if you\u2019ve been really hurting for so\nlong, and there\u2019s an opportunity to do something different, then maybe it makes\ngood mental health sense to try to take advantage of this. I think we spent our\ntime on the ship rather quietly. I must have played with the other kids and there\u2019s\na picture that I sent you a copy of and there seemed to be quite a lot of kids\nthough most of them, I think, were older and there were a few babies. In Limoges\nI went to school and I have a feeling that I was kind of lonesome but there was\nsome -- I remember some really nice things. Like there was a carpenter who\ncouldn\u2019t work most of the time and he made me this wonderful little set of red and\nblue furniture, tables and chairs and he made upholstery things with little pieces\nof wallpaper and so on. That was a really nice thought. Then after a few months,\ntwo rooms next door to the two rooms we had, became available. I don\u2019t know\nwhy but somehow my mother was chosen or somehow got to have the smaller of\nthe two rooms with us. We didn\u2019t have to sleep on the floor, we could put our --\nthey were like orange crate beds that somebody had put together. We could put\nour straw bags on those. That\u2019s where I had real measles in that room and I\nremember that very dramatically. I remember for two weeks lying on my back in\nthis room with a dark curtain drawn because I was do photophobic and watching\nthe mold grow on the ceiling and the drips come and drip down. For two weeks I\nwas lying there like that. The two couples who got the outer room, were two\nsisters married to two brothers. One of those brothers was almost blind and he\nsomehow, even though I think this was illegal, he managed to find some leather.\nHe would punch out those pieces of leather that you make the belts that hook onto\neach other. My brother and I would sometimes help him and I liked doing that\nespecially because I think he used to tell us stories while we sat and work. We\nwould sit at this little window and we would make these belts. That was kind of a\npleasant thing for me.",
        "A: I think my mother was extremely somber in those days. I remember going for\nsome long walks to try to get food and I remember those as being somber\noccasions. I may be totally wrong but I don\u2019t remember any laughter or --. The\nonly way I can present her personality really is to tell you about after we came to\nAmerica because I think it must have been worse in France. My mother imagined\nherself a really aristocratic lady -- that\u2019s the way she thought of herself. When my\naunt Lena and -- actually it was her kids who came with her -- brought us from\nthe boat to her house --. She lived in the lower East Side and I was sitting next to\nmy mother in the back seat and my brother was sitting next to me. As we drove\ninto the lower East Side with the push- carts and this sort of mass of humanity,\nmy mother whispered, for this I\u2019ve struggled all these years. I thought oh my G-\nd, what a terrible thing to say. Even though maybe I was also feeling part of that,\nmaybe I was worried that someone was going to hear or what but she just --. We\nlived with my aunt for three months. My aunt got sick at one point and in\nretrospect we should have been really grateful for being put up. I think my\nmother really was very grateful but at the same time, when my aunt got sick and\nneeded somebody to make her a cup of tea, my mother had no idea how to make a\ncup of tea because she\u2019d been so --. Part of that had to be a put-up job because in\nFrance, in those two years, everybody was struggling making meals and so on. I\nthink it was more maybe when she was asked to make cereal or something, she\nhad never done that, she hadn\u2019t a clue and so on. But she was a very giving\nperson and so when we finally got an apartment after three months and I think she\nwas earning $35 or $45 a month, something like that -- no wait a minute -- what\nwas she earning? She was earning $15 a week, that\u2019s what it was and the rent was\n$45 a month. She would buy things for us. Sometimes she\u2019d even come home\nwith a little treat for us and she was living on toast and tomatoes. It was all for us.\nShe wore black for years and years and years; it wasn\u2019t until -- I don\u2019t know when\nit happened that she would occasionally put on something red; but for years --.\nThen there was that whole struggle of when I tried to put on something black.\nShe would say there will be time enough for that, don\u2019t wear -- if you have to\nwear black, put on a flower or something like that. She often complained about\nher state in life and I don\u2019t blame her but she didn\u2019t have any guidance. She could\nhave had a fantastically better life, she could have been a fantastic bookkeeper but\nnobody guided her so she ended up leading her life in the factories which she\nhated. It wasn\u2019t so much the work as it was the demeaning atmosphere. She felt\nthat she was with these uneducated, boorish people who -- I think occasionally\neven people made passes at her which she found --. She was so Victorian that\neven when she was in the nursing home -- no it wasn\u2019t the nursing home. It was\nwhen she was living in a senior citizens\u2019 thing, when we moved her up to\nBrookline and she belonged to some golden age club. I think she was 80 by then.\nOne day she called me up and it was raining and she said, some 80 -year- old man\noffered her a ride back to her apartment. I said good, did you take 1t? Who do you\nthink I am? Would I take a ride with a strange man? So she had this image of\nherself, she never would have thought of getting remarried. She wouldn\u2019t, the\nidea of, no man was allowed to touch her except my father. She had a terrible\ntime getting used to America because one time she came in for a job interview or\nsomething and the boss was sitting on his chair with his feet up on the desk.\nWell, she thought that that was treating her in a terrible way or for example, when\npeople would call her by her first name without being invited. In Vienna she was\nFrau Doctor Reif and the least she expected was to be Mrs. Reif. She had a lot of\nthose -- she was just very European. But she also -- she adapted very well in\nother ways. She got to be really good at shopping and knowing where to get\nbargains. She was very, she was always very energetic. It\u2019s just that she didn\u2019t\nalways channel her energy. Like when she went to work in New York in the\nmorning, she would get up I think at six in the morning in order to be able to\nleave the house at a quarter to eight. During that time, she must have expended, I\nmean you could have built a house with the amount of energy she expended just\nin the process of getting herself dressed, makeup and a hat and hat pins, stockings\nand shoes and all these things. Then she\u2019d get to Manhattan and take it all off and\nput on some work clothes that she had at the factory. Then she\u2019d put it all back\non to take the subway back home. What else do you want to know?",
        "A: Let me add one more thing because I don\u2019t want to leave you with the wrong\nimpression. She also, she was very good- natured like she\u2019d play cards with me,\nif I was bored, she\u2019d play cards with me.- Or if I needed to memorize a poem for\nschool, even though she was exhausted, she would sit up in bed at night and have\nme recite over and over again. Was that IF by Roger Kipling, I just remember\nthat one in particular, but many things like that; she was really very good about\nalways trying to do things to try to make me happy. I think there was a really fun\nloving person there that never got to come out because of the way life went.\n"
