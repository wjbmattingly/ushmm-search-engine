        "Q: Tell me about you as a child. Uh where did you go to school? Something about your friends?",
        "A: In fact I was recently back at the elementary school when when there was a commemoration\nof Kristallnacht and my uh and I was invited to give a uh dedicatory speech to the uh uh to to\nthe uh of stone that was left there, an artistic re...re-creation at the place where the uh\nsynagogue had stood and they started a monument there, so I went back into that school\nroom. It was a uh one pers...a one class school room, with where kids from the age of six to\nsixteen were all housed in the same school room and the teacher there was a master of time\nengineering. He was able to keep the everybody occupied and differently uh except for\nchoral singing or something like that during the entire school day. I have, I've, I'm a teacher\nmyself and I don't think I would have half the skills to do what he had done in giving us all a\nfantastically good education. Uh all the children who went on, later on to high school, uh\nwere uh prepared as virtually nobody else and excelled then in high school. Uh my activities\nalso centered around a Jewish club which was called Jugendgemeinde. It was headed or\ninstructed or conducted by our cantor, a man by the name of Sisnook (ph) and I've written\nabout him and uh so that was the supplementary education. I think some of my skills if any\nas a uh as aan analyst of literature started there because we started sort of with ex...exegesis\nof the uh of , the and other and Mishna [ph] and the Talmud and explicated it\nand this this this uh tendency to read closely was really nurtured in that community. So that\nwas, these are some perimeters under which I grew up and of course 1n in high school with\nmy uh Jewish as well as Christian friends, and it seemed before 1933 as if some level of\nintegration had been reached. Christian friends came to my house. I to, I to theirs. We were\ninvited to the same parties together and of course it all came unstuck and viciously in 1933.",
        "Q: Tell us about that.",
        "A: Uh in - I'll give, I think I can best illustrate 1t by one example. I had known one of my friends\nin high school even before I got to high school, which starts, of course, started of course even\nas it does now in Germany at age ten, and uh uh his name was Heinrich, Heinrich Hennes,\nand uh he uh when the first nasty things happened in the school yard, he be...he uh out of\nconviction became our stoutest defender. He would, he would, he would en...he would\nengage in fisticuffs in order to protect us. He was highly intelligent and then the, he was also\nof course in the Nazi youth organization as everybody 1n in the class was, and uh finally uh\nhe was taken aside more and more by his youth leader and this youth leader and the\npropaganda managed to turn him around completely and he became our worst enemy. He\nbecame the attacker. He became, uh because he was so highly intelligent, he would uh he\nwould shout very hurtful catcalls when one of the Jewish childr....uh we were three boys in\nthis high sch...in this high school class, and he would uh interrupt by catcalls. He became our\nworst tormenters. Uh he uh from the reports I have received later from my home town, he\nbecame such a fanatic that when the German fortunes turned around in 1n the Soviet in the\nSoviet Union, in the war there, uh he shot himself. And that is, I think while he is an extreme\nexample this type of turnaround 1s, turnabout 1s is really very much significant and and\ncharacteristic of those times. There were few who either surreptitiously or openly kept\ncontact with us, but we, we became as the years progressed ever more isolated. To uh, an\nincident which has no great significance but which uh just shows uh we were on soccer\nteams together and then all of a sudden you were not. You uh, I was kicked out of an athletic\nclub. Uh I uh I I was fairly decent athlete and I had won the requisite number of points to get\nsome sort of medal and that of course was denied. These were small little incidents, but they\nlinger because they're childhood memories. Of course they are compared to the horrors that\nfollowed, they pale but nonetheless these are memories, and that's also part of that process of\ngrowing up an adolescent in the Hitler in the Hitler years.",
        "Q: Tell us more about that. Uh how did uh the tightening laws, for instance, affect your family?",
        "A: Uh of course the Nuremburg laws uh immediately uh ma...we were forced to dismiss\nimmediately the uh uh very nice young lady, young girl who had worked as as the household\nhelp of my mother and we had to take a woman uh I think over forty-five because that was a\nlaw that only uh women uh supposedly uh safe from the hyperactive Jewish male sexuality\nuh would be protected, and so she immediately left our household. The tightening laws also\nmeant that my father had fewer and fewer customers. Uh he had, he would uh travel uh\nduring the week to various customers in the nearby villages and uh have samples of his uh\ntextiles and then ship them out. And more and more and more often there were signs on\nthese, uh on these farms - we don't want Jews in here. \"Juden ist der Eintritt verboten.\" Uh\nand so there was diminished income. There were worries. Uh and uh these were the first\nsigns of a of a major catastrophe coming about.",
        "Q: How did things begin to change for you? When did you decide you knew you wanted to\nleave? Or were going to try to leave?",
        "A: I think it was the uh atmosphere of hate and persecution and isolation in school, of being\noccasionally accosted when uh in public places, you know - people would shout after you -\nthis is a town of about sixty-five thousand people, so people knew each other even if only\nslightly, so you were readily identified as a Jew and uh so uh my brother was beaten up at\none time. Uh at another time uh there was a uh young man whom we knew from the\nswimming pool and when it was still open to Jews uh we would go swimming there, my\nbrother and I, and uh uh one time uh a young fellow about our age uh started beating us up\nand if we had really resisted that would have made it worse, and uh as as as a sort of a\npsychological note, this man's, this young man's name was was Moses. He was not Jewish\nand I think uh his aggressiveness stemmed from the fact that at one time people thought this\nwas a Jewish firm. They of course immediately changed their name from Moses to Mosel\n(ph) and uh uh IJ uh later on, getting back to my home town as a soldier, I found out that he\nwas captured in in Russia and had a real sense of satisfaction about it. (laughter) But these\nwere some of the incidents, the tightening uh at home - things we couldn't do anymore. You,\nthere were many places where you couldn't go on vacation any more. These were mild\nthings, but being beaten up at the swimming pool, I I felt it was getting worse and worse. My\nparents as well, and so they uh in in 1936 really was when they made serious efforts to\ncontact our relatives in uh St. Louis in order to try getting us out.",
        "Q: The relatives in St. Louis, uh how had they gotten to America and when?",
        "A: Very early. Uh my Uncle Beno (ph), uh my my mother's brother, uh was somewhat of a\nrebel as a boy and the, my my grandfather whom I loved was also the typical German\npatriarch, and any sign of rebelliousness was immediately uh was first uh there came stern\nwarnings and when Uncle Beno became, still was not conforming to family rules, they\nshipped him to another relative in St. Louis, that America was a place (laughter) for for uh\ndisobedient sons and daughters and so he was shipped out. Yes. (Laughter)",
        "Q: So the contact had been made...",
        "A: The contact had been made. It had really never uh there was the obligatory letter of say two\nletters a year and uh he had gotten to St. Louis, had uh learned how to be a baker, and uh\nuntil the Depression had a steady job at at one of the uh bread factories, uh small uh\nneighborhood bakeries, and uh then with the Depression he lost his job, and uh so he,\nhowever, had a good rapport with the union leaders so they sent him on various temporary\njobs when somebody was sick or vacation or there was a special uh special demand for\nbakery goods, he was he was sent and so he would sometimes work three, four day...uh days\nand nights on end and then there would be uh absolutely no employment for for a month, but\nhe he was able to get his family through the worst times, but he certainly was in no way\nfinancially able uh to back up an affidavit even though he made out one. And uh that uh\ncame after I had gone on a bicycle trip with a Jewish group in 1937, I came home and my\nparents told me uh two affidavits are waiting for you - one from my uncle in St. Louis and\none by a children's organization also in St. Louis, both of them in in fact worthless as far as\nthe stipulations of the American government were concerned which wants to make sure by\nfinancial backing that the immigrant would not become a public charge. So uh the uh uh two\naffidavits were there. The children's affidavit worthless - I was fifteen at the time, hence I\nwas not a child and my uncle had no financial backing whatsoever. So, but I didn't know that\nthese affidavits were really insignificant as far as the American government was concerned.",
        "Q: So what did you do?",
        "A: I (cough) I was uh able to secure a date from the American consul in very rapid order. Uh I\nhad come back from this bicycle trip, I now remember, in about August, and had my uh and\ntwo months later had already a date in October with the American consul in Hamburg which\nuh was, the distance was not very great and I was able to get a ride with a uh another family\nready to immigrate and we all went to Hamburg. Uh the next day I presented myself at at the\nAmerican consul's office. It was an encounter that lasted fifteen minutes and obviously\nchanged my life. Uh the American official - I shall never forget his name because uh uh\nindeed it was the most important fifteen minute encounter of my life - his name was\nMalcolm C. Burk (ph) and uh he asked absolutely inane questions. Uh in he was it it was\napparent that he wanted to have me succeed in getting getting his uh getting the visa and so\nhe asked me questions like uh I guess to ascertain my sanity (laughter) how much is uh is uh\n48 and 52. Uh I'm not good at numbers but that one I was up to. In fifteen minutes I had I\nhad his stamp on on my uh identification papers and uh never really wondered...I I thought\nthat was the way routinely matters went. And uh in November of that year I uh was uh\ninformed by a Jewish organization that they had a group of children uh that was going over\nto the United States and there was an escort, a woman...uh even right now under your\nquestions, Linda, my memory 1s jogged--uh Mrs. Epstein (ph) and uh she was on the boat\ngoing...taking us over and then coming back, having having fulfilled her mission. I uh\ndisembarked in New York. Uh a far-flung relative picked me up, then turned me over to the\nChildren's Committee the next day and uh they determined that my English was good\nenough uh that I could be sent on that long train trip from New York to St. Louis and so I\nhad arrived in in this country.",
        "Q: Tell us what you did in America in those first years.",
        "A: Alright. IT I guess I'll I'll put myself on that train once more, because there was an\ninterruption. I had to change trains in Chicago, was picked up by a member of that\ncommittee and uh the this very nice woman said she could give me a short overview of\nChicago uh in two hours until my train to St. Louis was due. She took me in her car and the\nonly thing that I remembered today of course is some of the skyscrapers I had never seen\nbefore but also the absolute mad scene at Maxwell Market where she took me and it's...I\nguess one of my first impressions of the United States uh was was this market and and uh the\ntrading and and the office [ph] all that went with it. Uh then I arrived in St. Louis, was\npicked up - my relatives, picked up by my relatives, taken uh to their home and five days\nlater I was in an American high school. Uh a very good one. It was considered at that time,\nSouthern (ph) High School in St. Louis was considered to be on a par with some of the\neastern prep schools. Uh it uh I must say the education I had gotten in Germany both in high\nschool and and in a one room uh Jewish school was really geared me for what happened. I\ngraduated within two years in June '39 and that is when I uh it was obvious that my uncle\ncould not support me too. I started working in the high school lunch room. Uh then a teacher\nof uh a Jewish teacher took an interest in me, even though I had never taken a class with her,\nand she introduced me to the owner of a hotel chain - uh no, of the biggest hotel or the\nfanciest hotel in St. Louis, the Chase, and I became a bus boy there uh being trained first as a\nwater boy and uh then in fact uh throughout my uh college career until I had my Master's I\nworked as a busboy and waiter in various restaurants in St. Louis and New York, so that's\nwhat I did. Uh in, I graduated in '39, worked for one year to have a bit of a financial backing\nand then started on a part-time basis at St. Louis University, uh finished my uh my uh lower\ndivision courses by sort of uh the, II got myself a job at the hotel closest to the University,\none block away - the Melbourne (ph) Hotel which in fact today is a dormitory of the\nUniversity and uh sometimes ran from the one to the other uh coming to class in my bus boy\nuniform and uh that's uh what I did. And then of course came the war.",
        "Q: How did you keep in touch with your parents, or did you keep in touch with your parents?",
        "A: Yes, by letters of course. Uh and uh in fact the last one I got we were desperately trying to\nhelp, finding people to give an affidavit to uh a whole family. It uh there's there's something\nthat I I guess I still regret because uh I uh didn't have much money so I hitchhiked all over\nSt. Louis going to movies that I wanted to see or to the uh Botanical Gardens or various\nplaces, and one time I was picked up by a man. He said, I have money. I I can do this, and I,\nhe he said but I must tell you, your the lawyers who will draw up this may uh uh may disdain\nmy profession and not do this. I'm a gambler. And he was a wonderful man, and he said I'll\ngo down with you to this lawyer and this lawyer, picked by the St. Louis Jewish community\nto help people like me uh was too short-sighted to see that all some consuls wanted was a\npiece of paper. He said I cannot accept your affidavit. You are not in the kind of profession\nthat the government will accept. It would have been, it would have been an easy thing to\nsimply make out the papers. Had they failed, so be it, but he was he he was so conventional\nand so hide-bound that he refused this man's uh bona fide_ and it was this is one of the things\nthat sometimes haunts me. Uh so I had my, the last letter I got from my parents was from the\nWarsaw ghetto. I don't know how it, whether that is customary or was still possible at the\nfirst uh at the in the first stages of the Warsaw ghetto to write communications from there,\nbut at any rate a letter reached me in St. Louis from the Warsaw ghetto in which of course it\nwas a very guarded letter. I realized how bad things were but uh that was the last time I\nheard of them and uh, well while I have no absolute proof, the presumption is of course they\ndied there. They were murdered.",
        "Q: . Tell me about you when the war broke out.",
        "A: Uh I tried enlisting and at that time they were not uh enli...uh they did not accept uh non-\nnative Americans uh for uh for the Army or Navy. I was ultimately drafted in uh in '42. Uh at\nfirst was sent to a uh a medical administrative training camp in Camp Barkley, Texas. Had\nmy basic there and then was plucked out one day by special orders to join the Military\nIntelligence training camp at Camp Ritchie, Maryland. Uh most of us were of course because\nof our linguistic skills, having had college background and the like and uh so I graduated\nfrom the eighth class of Military Intelligence Training Camp - it's not too far here from\nWashington. I visited 1t again, and uh then was, they put together teams for of interrogators.\nUh after some uh additional training and uh being stationed in England, we joined Ist U.S.\nArmy, then readying itself for the uh invasion, and their headquarters was in Bristol,\nEngland. Then uh on D-Day we of course were mar...uh we went to the Marshall (ph) area\nwhich was Southampton, got on the LSD's and uh took part in the invasion. It was uh it was\nmy first time, even though we had of course had mock interrogations back in camp uh and\ntrained, and be train...been trained in all sorts of things from German army organization to uh\nterrain intelligence - it was my first real interrogation with tough Nazis on the beaches of\nNormandy. And uh it was uh an experience that I've written about uh and I think what turned\nuh turned me uh into a uh removed all my sense of inferiority as an interrogator was that was\nmy fourth or fifth interrogation when an artillery shell came over the uh interrogation tents\nand uh we, both the prisoner and I, hit the ground and uh he uh showed far greater fright than\nI did. And then everything went smoothly and I was able to extract interrogation from\nbeginning in Normandy to the end of until V-E Day and uh in fact uh I, my reports uh\napparently were well-received. I I got the Bronze Star uh from General Hodges towards the\nend of the war.",
        "Q: Tell us about some of these interrogations. I know some of them have stuck in your mind.",
        "A: Uh I I think uh most of our responsibility was of course extracting tactical and strategic\nin..information and uh some of it was very easy because the uh prisoners didn't realize that\nuh what they were giving away or we bluffed that we already knew uh or we uh tried to uh\nuh create the impression that a buddy already had told us. Uh that was, that was fairly easy.\nSome of them, some of the information uh was so uh obvious what we were after and so\nthreatening to the prisoner that it, that we really had to use some very tough psychological\nwarfa...uh uh what we had learned as psychological warfare and really put psychological\npressures on the prisoners, and uh most of the time that worked. As uh as a rather neglected\nbut uh byline we told to ferret out war criminals and uh those uh guilty of uh genocide and\nand so forth and uh the first inklings we got of what really had happened were when we did\nextract such information from prisoners. Uh we would get a a soldier...a German soldiers,\nnot high in rank, about our age and uh as you bored in your interrogation, he would admit\nthat at one time he had been a concentration camp guard, particularly a guard in the early\nstages of the concentration camp, before the extermination camps set in. And uh uh they uh\nwhat what struck us at that time was the absolute inability to see the enormity of what they\nhad done. Uh I remember one prisoner and in fact I took his confession, in fact have uh have\nit still, uh where he said uh that he had been a guard at the Oranienburg concentration camp\nnear Berlin and that he had frequently volunteered for execution uh uh squads and I asked\nhim, well why did you volunteer. He said well, if I hadn't done it they would have gotten\nsomebody else, and one of the bonuses if you volunteered for an execution sq...squad was\nthat you got a pass, an additional pass to go into Berlin, and you know, he said, uh very\nconversationally almost, you know, at that time they still had all the concert halls open and I\nloved getting to these concert halls and hearing the concerts there, and so I volunteered for\nthe execution squads. He was particularly fond of Beethoven and Mozart. So these were the\nfirst uh interrogations were...1t came about that we uh ferreted out some of the minor, small-\nfry criminals. The first uh really significant war criminal or let us say against humanity was a\nuh a man who who we uncovered in an absolute absurd way - it was not our skill but uh a\ncombination of circumstances that brought about his unmasking. Uh my we uh I I have to\ngive you a bit of background - that day, it was a, it was the day of Roosevelt's death and we\nwere very upset and uh so uh uh one of the MP's brought in that day a prisoner, a young\nfellow, and uh he said this this fellow has a picture of Himmler autographed tn his uh in his\npossession and so uh Freddie, my friend Fred Howard and I uh saw that picture. We were\nangry and so we took the picture away from the prisoner who said that he was a nephew of\nHeinrich Himmler and so we took the picture and uh we cut, cut, cut it out, the photograph\nand put a rope around his neck and hung it on a goose-neck lamp that was 1n our\ninterrogation camp, hanging him in effigy. Later that day, very late at night, Freddie ushered\nin a routine prisoner. He was, had just been captured, a uh Dr. Schuebbe (ph) from\nWestphalia, and uh this is, this man seemed disoriented. One of our prisoner trustees\nimmediately caught on - he said drugs. And so uh uh this man was under the illusion, seeing\nthe picture of Himmler and we were interrogating in short sleeves - it was, you know, very\ninformal and we were not in uniform - and uh so he had the delusion that he was at a\nGestapo headquarters, with the picture of Himmler, of course, prominently displayed. And\nhe said, oh, I'm glad to be here. I belong to you too. And so uh Freddie caught on uh this\ndelusion and he said well, we know who we are - who the hell are you? And so uh he uh\nunder the guise of try...of having him prove his credentials, drew everything out of him,\nincluding the fact that he had personally killed upward of twenty thousand people in in\nPo...1n Poland and Russia. Uh you know, in the early stages of mass extermination, they used\nmorphine injections, M Preparat, as he called it, and he had gotten addicted himself, so uh he\nwas shipped out and that's how he landed in our uh in our prisoner of war enclosure, and he\nretold in precise medical detail - uh I even remember the words - uh how a prisoner died.\nYou know, he said, oh well, we uh injected them with the uh \"M\" Preparation, morphine,\nand then he, after a while a certain euphoria was uh present, 1s, is a state of mind in the\nprisoner, then - and sort of said it exetentiously (ph) tallis, very medical, and we were uh uh,\nFreddie, I I uh was putting all this down and then uh he uh uh I I made a mistake. I came, uh\nit was late at night. I wanted a cup of coffee and Freddie had a little stove there. I came in\nand I was dressed in a Russian uniform. It was one of the tricks we used tn order to extract\nuh information from the German prisoners of war. They uh, I was supposed to be a Russian\nliaison officer who would take recalcitrant prisoners uh and and ship them off to Russia. It\nwas a very effective dig...disguise and uh very effective in putting psychological pressure on\nprisoners. I walked in and that startled him and uh Freddie, of course, caught the drift and\nimmediately pretended throwing me out, that I was a uh a prisoner who was doing menial\nservice and had just wandered in. That gave him pause and then he made a second mistake\nand that was the uh that he gave him coffee uh in this long interrogation and uh then uh he\ncame out of the morphine, and he retracted everything. In the next couple of days we did\nreally work hard to break him down. We took no-sleep tablets and it was just the routine type\nof interrogation that you sometimes see on police procedural detective stories - just\nhammering away again and again and again and by that time he was so exhausted as were\nwe that he once more uh gave us the whole information. Uh the uh the in the first week of\nMay issue of Time magazine carried the story and so did - we had in the meanwhile uh\nconquered Luxembourg as you'll recall, and Radio Luxembourg became one of the powerful\nuh uh radio communication networks for the Allied forces and Radio Luxembourg broadcast\nverbatim - we took the uh interrogation down verbatim - uh broadcast that both in English\nand German, broadcast that all over for about two weeks. It was probably my biggest case\nand uh it was uh a pure accident, so you can imagine had it not been for all these\ncircumstances working together, he would have slipped right by us. And probably be living a\nshort uh living a long life in practicing medicine someplace in a rural town in Westphalia or\nelsewhere. Uh he was executed by the Czechoslovakians later on. Uh he was turned over to\nthem because he, many Czechs had been killed by him, so uh I could put that into medical\nterms but shan't.",
        "Q: Thank you. Will you tell us about some of the other prisoners whom you captured?",
        "A: Uh we we had one who was very high in the medical profession. You know, the uh people\nthe doctors without humanity which was of the titles of the books about them. I told you\nabout some of the minor war criminals. Uh the uh one of the cases that stick...sticks in my\nmind but is really less relevant for Holocaust except for possibly uh the uh stupidity and\narrogance of some of our, of our officers, uh not our officers but of the uh...our officers, most\nof them were very excellent interrogators. Uh uh occasionally uh they were less adapt and\nthey had to call in a certain enlisted man. Uh this was true of a case of Colonel Fundeheider\n(ph). He uh was a professor of law, had become a leader of parachute troops and during the\nBattle of the Bulge uh had been ordered to take a paratroop troop uh to fight against us. They\nwere dropped at the wrong at the wrong place and quickly taken prisoner. Uh I uh I uh was\nultimately selected to interrogate him, and for that you put on higher insignia in order to be\non a par with your German prisoner, and uh so I interrogated Colonel Fundeheider and uh he\nhad had part of his law education under a Rockefeller grant in the United States, and he\nstarted telling me that and I paid no attention and then he said, of course I can't tell you\nnothing but my name and rank. I said, oh, I wouldn't expect a high-ranking officer like you\nto tell me anymore. Besides, you did such an inept, stupid, dumb uh uh uh dumb attack with\nyour parachute troops, dropping them off at the wrong place - uh we really don't want to\nknow anything about you. He he pulled himself up 1n his chair and started shouting at me.\nHe said, how can you say that. That's wasn't my fault. That was the Air Force's fault, and I\nsaid, \"Oh, we heard from your prisoners. You were you were completely out of it even in\ncamp when you trained these troops,\" and in in defending himself, (laughter) how, what a\ngreat field commander he had been, he told me absolutely everything - how the troops were\ntrained, what was their special mission, uh every detail. I egged him on - uh time after time,\nuh and I said well, maybe it wasn't quite so bad, but didn't you do this and then he would\nagain explain this, and at the end of the interrogation, I said uh, Colonel, uh uh I uh really I I\nI honor your uh silence and uh I know you can't tell me anything and sent him off.\n(Laughter) It was one of the funniest uh interrogations I I had uh during the entire war uh\nand it was it's memorable. He ended up then as a law professor at the University of\nWuerzburg after the war. I never looked him up of course.",
        "Q: Before we move on, do you have any other interrogations of people who were either in\nconcentration camps or who were comm...and/or who had committed war crimes that stick\nin your memory?",
        "A: Uh, no. They were uh, they were all this these kinds of small-fry, people who had been\nguards uh and who really uh I, in the...I can say in the aggregate, I uh that uh they were\nabsolutely negligible as persons, but in the aggregate, they really had no conscience. They\nthey realized, they had no idea really what they had done. Uh as a matter of fact, under your\nprodding, I do remember one case - he was a Romanian who had volunteered for the SS, or\nhad been drafted. I can't recall that for sure, but uh under intense interrogation, he told us that\nhe had sort of conducted a personal vendetta against a family in his hometown in Romania,\nhad showed up at their house and simply shot them. Uh uh and so uh if 1f memories sort of\ncome back and uh he uh said while I went into this house of the Frankels (ph), I think that\nwas their name, and uh simply, I I wanted some of the stuff in their house uh and he simply\nshot them right there on the spot. And that of course uh js a uh 1s a story that uh still remains.\nUh it uh among those whom we liberated uh one of the more memorable scenes was uh and\nprobably not very well known - uh the Germans had not, had put into prisons but not\nconcentration camps some of the veterans of the Spanish Republican Army, and these uh uh\nmen uh whom Spanish officers we had liberated for the, they had been asked to dig defenses\nin France, but they had earlier been on the Channel Islands, which the Germans had taken\nover and built fortifications there. So uh I uh since I had uh studied Spanish in in high\nschool, in - no, not in high school, in college - I was asked to interrogate them, and so I uh\nthey were of course not just uh re...uh reluctant witnesses but they were just so overly willing\nto give uh everything away and and tell what the fortifications were, and uh the one in fact\nwas an engineer and drew me a very detailed and sophisticated map of all the fortifications\non the Channel Islands that he had helped build. And uh if we had ever invaded the Channel\nIslands, we would have (laughter) had the most detailed situation map that you could have\nimagined. But of course that never materialized, but that was, is another memorable uh\ninterrogation because of course the higher headquarters saw it and uh that was the kind of\ndetail that was very rare, even though it proved outwardly to be utterly useless. Uh but that\nis, those are some of the interrogations that I recall, except one of curious coincidence. This\nwas at the uh right after the uh invasion of Normandy. We pushed forward into France and\nwe had virtually surrounded the uh German uh troops uh between the two cities of Falaise\n(ph) and Argentan (ph). And uh there was one gap - uh there's a new book, just came out -\nit's being reviewed and this book uh uh on World War II says the gap, had Montgomery\nacted faster would have been closed and the war might have stopped right then and there or\nat least in the war in the west, and uh had we uh were unable to close it but we took\nthousands of prisoners near Falaise and Argentan and so we had to do uh we had to do uh\nwork very quickly with the prisoners and had no time except pick out some that by uh\nvir...by the testimony of their of their paybooks were important. So uh, I flipped through\nstacks upon stacks of paybooks uh which were in, were very detailed. The, not like our\nidentification papers which gave virtually nothing away, but their's gave last leave, and I\nflipped through and I find a paybook, Gunther H., from my home town of Hildesheim, a\nlieutenant. And I thought this this can't be a coincidence...it can't be uh a strange...this must\nbe the Gunther H. whom I went went to the same athletic club with. So I waited till 1t was\npitch dark that night, and interrogated him in darkness, of course using his home background\nuh to extract information and he was peering through the darkness because it was so obvious\nthat I uh knew a heck of a lot about him, and at the end of it he said, uh how do you know so\nmuch about me, and I said well, I had also seen I was prepared for that question, that he had\nearned a high decoration and I said, well we in intelligence keep book on all those who are\nhighly decorated uh officers in the German army, and then sent him out. It was uh this this\nkind of war coincidence--I've written about this because uh he might still be alive for all I\nknow. It's exactly my age and uh a rather unprepossessing, uninteresting fellow when I was\nin the Turnverein--Athletic Club--Eintracht in Hildesheim with him uh and he had developed\ninto apparently a quite a warrior because uh that decoration wasn't given away uh to just\nanyone.",
        "Q: Did he give you valuable information?",
        "A: No. I II have to be honest. It, since we had this, you know, uh surrounded Argentan and\nFalaise and I had not picked him for uh his potential as an informant but simply because I\nwas interested whether it was the same fellow and uh just to see him again. Uh he he was, it\nwas not productive, but it was a curious coincidence.",
        "Q: Let's move on a bit...",
        "A: Surely.",
        "Q: ...unless you have other stories of interrogations that you want to add.",
        "A: If something occurs I'll I'll insert them.",
        "Q: Uh, let's start moving across Germany and moving across Europe. Uh at what point did you\nstart encountering your first prisoners of uh, that is concentration camp victims and indeed\nyour first camp?",
        "A: Uh, the uh guards were sort of strewn across our path as we advanced into Germany, and\nmore and more of these uh small-fry prisoners who had been guards and who told us\nsomething of the horrors of the concentration camp. Then Schuebbe, that came right after we\ncrossed over uh across the Rhine. I think it was in Bad Andernach that we uh our prisoner of\nwar camp was when we encountered Schuebbe. Uh then at the end of the war uh when uh\nwe had uh linked, uh almost linked with the Russians, uh were in that sector going through\nHesse-we were at Hersfeld and then we came upon the concentration camp Buchenwald. It,\nuh we were not among the fir...the troops who came there the first day and I heard from\nsome of them uh there uh utter horror and uh completely uh overwhelmed by by the sights.\nWe came one day later and yet uh not much had changed because we could not, there was no\nway of evacuating uh the prisoners to a to another place. We, of course, sent in physicians.\nWe sent in food, clothing and the like and uh uh what uh the way these faces looked - I don't\nmean simply emaciated as you see, but some pie...one person whose jaw was hanging\nvirtually loose. A tall man, emaciated with a loose-hanging jaw. I mean you you - these are\ndetails that stick in your head and in your mind and you uh you don't get over that very\neasily, and uh uh I I talked to some of them and uh they uh it 1t was, you know, they\nembraced you uh and you you felt why do I, I'm not a liberator. You know, I I wasn't in the\ncamp when it was liberated but there was this uh curious uh immediate heart-to-heart\nmeeting. Uh and one of the...we were, the prisoners of war contingent was there at\nBuchenwald but so was our uh MP outfit, a platoon of MP's that had served virtually from\nthe very beginning, had accompanied all us all through France and Germany uh and we had\nof course worked very closely with each other because when you uh interrogated you needed\nthe safety of of the prisoners uh the the guards and you told them what you were doing and\nthere was a real wonderful working relationship. The uh in charge of uh, nominally in charge\nwas a captain, but the real disciplinarian of that MP company was a Master Sergeant Hadley\nfrom Steubenville, Ohio. And uh uh I uh had, I was of the same rank for much of the time\nand uh so we had struck up a real friendship. I have, he was the prototype of the tough,\nread...and ready to fight U.S. Sergeant and an MP besides. You know, they have additional\nuh set of calluses all over their body. And uh uh Sergeant Hadley, I, we didn't arrive at the\nsame time, and uh I was looking around - I I I guess the uh emotions were so overwhelming\nthat I looked for some sign uh maybe that's mental cowardice, that I was looking for some\nsign of something normal, so I looked for buddies uh who had come to the camp with us, and\nI saw one who had sort of cradled his eyes with his arm like this, and uh I I recognized him\nimmediately - it it was Sergeant Hadley, and he was bawling like a child. Uh it 1t was it was\ngetting to all of us. And uh in in my case that was all the more understandable, because, you\nknow, it was a very personal crusade, the war, and a very personal uh involvement with my\nparents and my brother and my sister over there, and uh I didn't know their fate at that time\nbut I could surmise and but this, for generations we had talked about our uh heritage and the\nlike, at one time this Sergeant Hadley and I, and he was for generations in in Ohio and uh his\nfamily and but and he was not personally involved but he just uh uh broke down completely\nand I I was told by other members of uh who came to Buchenwald at various times that the\nsame thing had happened to uh General Eisenhower when he came there.",
        "Q: I want to pause and change tapes.",
        "A: Alright. Fine.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: We're back. Will you take us around the camp? Take us around Buchenwald, please, and tell\nus what you saw.",
        "A: Uh, we had hung up uh these uh big containers of water and prisoners were clustering\naround them because they of course didn't have even an abundance of water during the time\nof captivity. And uh uh then we had set up uh a uh aa uh station where we had, were\ndispensing food. And uh our physicians who were treating some of the worst cases uh had\ncame to uh came to the chow line. We had given them uh little containers where they, you\nknow, uh field kits and uh what the physicians were fighting the prisoners was that they took\nvery small portions at first uh and I remember one scene where a medical officer, a captain\nwhom I had seen because at one time I also had to interrogate prisoners in the field hospital\nwhere they were being treated, and uh I had seen him before and met him there again at uh\nBuchenwald and I had seen him at his, in the field hospital and he was one of those spit-and-\npolish officers, despite the fact that he was a physician, but he was running that field\nhospital. I I I think I only had one or two encounters with him before and there he was, again\na a person who in the months between the invasion and uh and uh the end of the war had\nbeen toughened by combat, and there he was standing with a a with an emaciated - well, they\nwere all emaciated - with a man who who had who was ready to eat ravenously and and he\nput his arm around him, and the, he was in a spit-and-polish uniform and the prisoner was\ndirty as they were all, and he put his arm around him and he he said to him, I heard him...he\nsaid, take a little now. We will take you back later, but to eat a lot now is very dangerous for\nyou, and so he led him away. Very gently. Uh what uh uh what also impressed me 1s that uh\nthe prisoners were not able to shed, to I I think deep down inside they weren't all that sure\nthat a new, that all that was behind them, and so they would still uh walk to that chow line in\nsomewhat of a make-shift formation. It was pitiful because they were free now, but they\nwould still gather as though there was an SS uh SS guard hounding them. And uh uh they uh\ndidn't walk erect uh and they uh were, there were some who uh came to attention when an\nAmerican officer came, as though there was, you know, it was apparently at that moment not\nquite comprehensible that they they were free, they were there, that the the oppression and\nthe horror had ended, and this was not Day |. This was Day 2 uh and it still in some, they\nwere uh so shaken and and so uh uh still enwrapped in in the environment that had been their\nlot for so for so long a time that they could not shed the uh image of what or or the\nexperience that had lain before. Uh I walked around uh once uh. There was, oh yes. There\nwas a small cr...sort of not even a creek, sort of a uh a little bit of a puddle running through\nuh through the camp and one prisoner was getting ready to stoop down to uh drink this uh\nmuddy water which he obviously had done before, and so uh not I but somebody else just\nsort of put his hand under his elbow and said uh, over there. You know, he couldn't speak\nthe, it was it was I guess one of our MP's who who uh uh couldn't speak German uh and just\npointed to the water containers and then then the man uh who had already stooped down\ncame up again and walked over to the water container, so the, it it you are what what to\nsummarize it, it was almost as if you had to unlearn the concentration camp experience.\nThese are some of the memories. Uh I I must admit that we didn't stay long. It 1t was, uh II\nthink some uh some threw up at that sight. I didn't, but uh I was very queasy and uh we we\nleft with our our captain, Captain Kahn (ph) uh had had gathered us and said back to the,\nback to our quarters, and we left.",
        "Q: Before you left, did you go into any of the barracks? Did you see any of the living\nconditions?",
        "A: No. I I I just, I I I must say I walked around the grounds but I did not go into the barracks\nbecause uh most of most of the prisoners were not in the barracks. They had come out, I\nguess to greet every more ever fresh visitors because once that first uh wave of visitors was\nover uh others came and they were, they showed the same gratefulness again and again and\nagain. As we were leaving, another uh troop - I don't know who they were, American troop -\ncame to Buchenwald just to see it, and uh uh again the same scene of coming to the fence\nand greeting the Americans and uh and no - I did not go in the barracks.",
        "Q: And did you at any point see any of the burial areas that took place?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about it?",
        "A: Uh as you know, they were mass burials. They were uh simply uh taken and uh as I recall,\nuh we had, they uh - oh yeah, the the commander who was met, who came to Buchenwald\nthe first day had gotten some of the local villagers uh to come to the camp, and they were\nhelping in the burial detail. And there were mass graves that I think the uh uh I wasn't there\nwhen they were dug. They were there and uh it was obvious that some of the people who\nwere still walking would not make it. Oh, I I did talk to one of, to that same physician whom\nI knew slightly - I said Captain, what are the chances here of survival of these people. And\nhe said, well I can't give you statistics or anything like that, but a good many won't make it,\neven now that we have the medic...the medicine here. Uh he said uh my commanding officer\nhas asked for more medicine and uh we'll have it but I am afraid it'll be too late, so I'm uh by\nhis testimony uh many more than already were were dead would join them before we could\ndo a darn thing for them.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to add about Buchenwald?",
        "A: One of the things that uh uh struck me, as I said I wasn't in the barracks, but the ground was\nso muddy, you know, with all the people walking around, and these these, many didn't have\nshoes and so the the mud and the grime was all the way - this seems a silly thing to\nremember because, you know, but you know as a soldier you are trained to be always, you\nknow, completely neat even even (laughter) if you are going to battle or whatever and and uh\nI I was not a front-line soldier but even those uh had, the first thing they were asked is to and\nit struck me at the incredible filth and dirt and each time they put their foot down, that water\nfrom that mud would once more uh send sprinkles up on to on to their pajama uniforms and\nto their legs and uh uh this is an image that also you see as they were sort of stomping around\nthe the campsite - it's a little detail but it it's again something that sticks with you.",
        "Q: Thank you. Alright. You left Buchenwald...",
        "A: I left Buchenwald and uh then uh we sort of carried on for a short while and in those uh\ncouple of days after the, after V-E day uh where we all celebrated of course, uh our captain\nsaid well, we haven't had any orders not to interrogate any more. (laughter) So uh curiously\nenough, even though the war was over, and at this time uh we did concentrate more on those\npeople who had been guards and the like, and we were even asked by uh some of the people\nalready designated to be in military government, to see whether we couldn't come up what\nwere called black and white lists. In short, uh trying to interrogate people who had been\nparticularly helpful and had left, had led lives of some virtue during the Nazi period and\nsome of the uh uh some of the villains. We turned these lists over to uh military government\nlater on. I don't think much happened with them, or that they were taken very seriously but\nthat we did and perhaps they should have been taken more seriously, because our our job\nwas done, and we could only pass on. Uh one of the stories that remains, and that happened\nearlier while we were in Belgium - it was the interrogation of my friend, he's still a friend of\nmine - these friendships have lasted from these uh compacted years of three years of\ninterr...or two years of interrogation, uh the most intensive uh intense days of our lives really,\ncause we had a mission, and Carley (ph) had the most curious case. He wrote about it later\non for commentary, but I know some of the details because I saw part of it, and that was the\ncase of the Jewish SS girl. Uh and I uh I think it it's uh it's so again uh so convoluted that and\nthe coincidences that this that this came to our attention and that we uh, that this girl got to\nthat stage. She was a Belgian girl from Brussels and her parents, after the uh Germans had\ntaken uh Belgium, managed to flee to France. Uh uh they got uh they got as far as the uh city\nof Montalbon (ph) and here the uh Catholic bishop in Montalbon uh took it upon himself to\nsave some of the Jewish children, and what he did is he placed them with Catholic French\nfamilies, cause they all spoke French being from Belgium, and he placed some of these\nBelgium children with uh uh with uh Catholic families and then uh the Germans of course\ncame as far as Montalbon and they started first to deport Jews, and uh she still saw, by her\ntestimony uh she saw her parents being rounded up on one of set of trucks that uh gathered\nin the uh in the uh city hall square of Montalbon. Uh then the Germans started recruiting\nFrench laborers to work in German armament industries and one day she, of course taken as\na Catholic girl from Monalbon, was also told to report for duty in Germany, and was shipped\nto the LUNA-Werke in Leipzig, and she was, as she told us, she was so scared that she\nperformed at with greater eagerness than even the, well certainly with greater eagerness than\nthe other forced laborers who were of course also asked to work at top performance, and so\nshe came to the attention to uh one woman foreman. She said wow, this woman, she really\nputs her heart into it. We're going to make her an SS auxiliary. And she had, there was no\nway she could protest this, and uh so she uh, we found her together with another SS auxiliary\nwoman. Uh we uh took her prisoner in France, in I beg your pardon, in Belgium, uh on the\nGerman, near the German border and when she, when Carley was interrogating her, she said,\nuh I'm Jewish. And he, he he, of course, you know, with with all the skepticism that we had\nheard all, every kind of story of exculpation and every kind of story of phoniness, you know\n- that was our job and uh and Carley said, you are what? Come on. Uh and uh then she\nexplained what I have just told you, and Carley still didn't uh believe a word of it. He said it's\na very clever uh clever way, and then he called over - we had uh a, we had a young Belgium\nworking with our CIC detachment, and he was from Brussels, so Carley called him in and\nsaid come on here, and of course the uh Belgian, Jacques, didn't believe it either, so uh he uh\nthey both were sort of kidding and uh so uh she he uh asked her, at at this point I I joined\nthem, uh and he asked her uh - OK, you you you're from, you're a Jewish girl from uh\nBrussels. Uh OK, name some of the uh name some of the suburbs of Brussels.? They started\noff like that, and then she just rattles them off. And uh then he said, where's the big\nsynagogue in Brussels. She knew that. Then he asked her about uh some of the Jewish\nrituals. Absolutely solid. And uh then uh he said what was your name in Brussels. And it\nturned out that he knew her brother. So the story was true. Not a good friend or anything like\nthat...",
        "Q: Quite a story.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What is, what is Carley's full name?",
        "A: Carley Fr , and uh he lives in New York, and uh we sometimes talk about these days.",
        "Q: What happened to the girl?",
        "A: We sent her off with the next transport because we really didn't want to know.",
        "Q: Did she tell you any of the things that she had done as an SS auxiliary?",
        "A: No. Apparently she was most of the time a uh forced laborer and uh as the SS auxiliaries,\nyou know, they were used in uh as clerical help. I I don't think she ever did anything that\nwould uh truly be war criminal or something like that. Uh but I don't, I don't know that and I\nI think once we had identified her uh it it went so deep that we, that we we really didn't want\nto know. We really didn't. And that's how Carley's story, if you ask him, would end. We\nnever know what happened to her.",
        "Q: Are there other stories you want to share with us of during this period?",
        "A: I, of the wartime period - uh I, I don't think so. II think I I've really uh come up with with\nthose where my, where where memory speaks and uh where I uh, which which stick out. Uh\nmuch of it is is lost wartime stories. And uh they are, perhaps in another context might\nbecome interesting, but by and large, I I've seen uh many of the people again with whom I\nserved, many of them Jewish, many of them sharing or having shared the same experience.\nUh and uh curiously enough, it, whenever we do meet -as happened only day before\nyesterday while I was at the University of Massachusetts, and somebody who was in the\nsame unit with me for a while, Professor Henry Lee, and I shared some of our memories.\nThat's inevitable. But I I think uh these are some of the more impress...memories that\nimpress me today in looking back.",
        "Q: Thank you. Tell us what happened then when you came back to the United States.",
        "A: Uh I uh [had the, my my ambition was uh to become a journalist, and one of my uh officers\nin Military Intelligence had been uh Sheppard Stone (ph) who was on the staff of the New\nYork Times. He had given me a very warm recommendation uh to the Managing Editor, and\nuh so on the strength of that I left St. Louis, came to New York, and uh started working in a\nrestaurant, introduced myself to the Managing Editor who on the strength of this letter saw\nme not once but several times. Couldn't find a spot for me because they were uh double-\nplatooned so to speak because many of their correspondents were coming back and had a\nclaim on their old jobs and then those who had done wartime service also had uh still had\ntheir jobs. There was no uh uh opportunity to to start at the New York Times then, so I\ndecided to keep on working uh as a waiter and start college again, and I uh uh started, in uh\n'46, I started at Hofstra (ph) University, then Hofstra College, graduated in '48, uh went on\nfor graduate work at Columbia uh and uh then uh got my first job uh and ultimately became\nboth an administrator - I was, I wrote uh on on the field of Germanistics (ph), and here 1s\nwhere really the experiences where I had to make a personal decision, and it was sort of a\nwatershed and I was at Columbia. Uh I could, uh could have entered of course a variety of\nfields. I found to my satisfaction and that of my professors that I had some gifts for German\nliterature and for German cultural history, and so they encouraged me to stay with it. I had\nreally looked at it as as a transit to comparative literature, but they offered me an\nassistantship and an instructorship uh and so I stuck in Germanistics and then uh the\nexistential question came - uh if you, I said to myself, if you stay in German studies, you\nobviously will have to deal with Germany and Germans. And uh so I asked myself whether\nthat, whether I could do it, and I uh came to the recognition that I indeed had a gift and to\ndeny it or to uh let it lie fallow would be an act of self-amputation, very much like the one\nthey were going to inflict on me. It was doing the work of enemy, so uh I decided to stay in\nGerman and this came somewhat later and I also thought that if I could uh analyze literature\nand if I could uh write about German literature, I could certainly do that work for those who\nhad been exiled from from Germany during the Nazi period, and I became in somewhat of a\nscholar of uh exile literature and of those who and the writings of writers who uh perished in\nthe concentration camps, and I've written on that uh and uh last last year a book called\n\"Literature...\", or in German, Literatur in Exil, which was published in Germany and I think\nlooking back, I've made the right decision, because uh I've lent, lent voice to some writers\nwho possibly without me might be forgotten or not remembered very often, so I have uh in a\nway uh kept their memory and the memory of their writings alive.",
        "Q: One cannot ask more than that perhaps.",
        "A: I hope so.",
        "Q: Thank you. Is there anything else you want to add?",
        "A: I suppose the kind of work you do here in keeping the memory of of those of the Holocaust\nalive touches very closely on my work as well, and uh so I have frequently interviewed, of\ncourse from a literary and historical perspective, uh those who uh either survived, for\nexample H. D. Adler (ph) who survived in Theresienstadt and has written a book about it -\nI've interviewed him. I've uh interviewed some people who were hidden in Berlin uh and are\nwriters today. I've interviewed many of the exiles who came to the United States, so I I think\nuh in a way this kind of oral history, whether yours or mine, uh may help to resuscitate some\npeople from being forgotten.",

    "answers": [
        "A: In fact I was recently back at the elementary school when when there was a commemoration\nof Kristallnacht and my uh and I was invited to give a uh dedicatory speech to the uh uh to to\nthe uh of stone that was left there, an artistic re...re-creation at the place where the uh\nsynagogue had stood and they started a monument there, so I went back into that school\nroom. It was a uh one pers...a one class school room, with where kids from the age of six to\nsixteen were all housed in the same school room and the teacher there was a master of time\nengineering. He was able to keep the everybody occupied and differently uh except for\nchoral singing or something like that during the entire school day. I have, I've, I'm a teacher\nmyself and I don't think I would have half the skills to do what he had done in giving us all a\nfantastically good education. Uh all the children who went on, later on to high school, uh\nwere uh prepared as virtually nobody else and excelled then in high school. Uh my activities\nalso centered around a Jewish club which was called Jugendgemeinde. It was headed or\ninstructed or conducted by our cantor, a man by the name of Sisnook (ph) and I've written\nabout him and uh so that was the supplementary education. I think some of my skills if any\nas a uh as aan analyst of literature started there because we started sort of with ex...exegesis\nof the uh of , the and other and Mishna [ph] and the Talmud and explicated it\nand this this this uh tendency to read closely was really nurtured in that community. So that\nwas, these are some perimeters under which I grew up and of course 1n in high school with\nmy uh Jewish as well as Christian friends, and it seemed before 1933 as if some level of\nintegration had been reached. Christian friends came to my house. I to, I to theirs. We were\ninvited to the same parties together and of course it all came unstuck and viciously in 1933.",
        "A: Uh in - I'll give, I think I can best illustrate 1t by one example. I had known one of my friends\nin high school even before I got to high school, which starts, of course, started of course even\nas it does now in Germany at age ten, and uh uh his name was Heinrich, Heinrich Hennes,\nand uh he uh when the first nasty things happened in the school yard, he be...he uh out of\nconviction became our stoutest defender. He would, he would, he would en...he would\nengage in fisticuffs in order to protect us. He was highly intelligent and then the, he was also\nof course in the Nazi youth organization as everybody 1n in the class was, and uh finally uh\nhe was taken aside more and more by his youth leader and this youth leader and the\npropaganda managed to turn him around completely and he became our worst enemy. He\nbecame the attacker. He became, uh because he was so highly intelligent, he would uh he\nwould shout very hurtful catcalls when one of the Jewish childr....uh we were three boys in\nthis high sch...in this high school class, and he would uh interrupt by catcalls. He became our\nworst tormenters. Uh he uh from the reports I have received later from my home town, he\nbecame such a fanatic that when the German fortunes turned around in 1n the Soviet in the\nSoviet Union, in the war there, uh he shot himself. And that is, I think while he is an extreme\nexample this type of turnaround 1s, turnabout 1s is really very much significant and and\ncharacteristic of those times. There were few who either surreptitiously or openly kept\ncontact with us, but we, we became as the years progressed ever more isolated. To uh, an\nincident which has no great significance but which uh just shows uh we were on soccer\nteams together and then all of a sudden you were not. You uh, I was kicked out of an athletic\nclub. Uh I uh I I was fairly decent athlete and I had won the requisite number of points to get\nsome sort of medal and that of course was denied. These were small little incidents, but they\nlinger because they're childhood memories. Of course they are compared to the horrors that\nfollowed, they pale but nonetheless these are memories, and that's also part of that process of\ngrowing up an adolescent in the Hitler in the Hitler years.",
        "A: Uh of course the Nuremburg laws uh immediately uh ma...we were forced to dismiss\nimmediately the uh uh very nice young lady, young girl who had worked as as the household\nhelp of my mother and we had to take a woman uh I think over forty-five because that was a\nlaw that only uh women uh supposedly uh safe from the hyperactive Jewish male sexuality\nuh would be protected, and so she immediately left our household. The tightening laws also\nmeant that my father had fewer and fewer customers. Uh he had, he would uh travel uh\nduring the week to various customers in the nearby villages and uh have samples of his uh\ntextiles and then ship them out. And more and more and more often there were signs on\nthese, uh on these farms - we don't want Jews in here. \"Juden ist der Eintritt verboten.\" Uh\nand so there was diminished income. There were worries. Uh and uh these were the first\nsigns of a of a major catastrophe coming about.",
        "A: I think it was the uh atmosphere of hate and persecution and isolation in school, of being\noccasionally accosted when uh in public places, you know - people would shout after you -\nthis is a town of about sixty-five thousand people, so people knew each other even if only\nslightly, so you were readily identified as a Jew and uh so uh my brother was beaten up at\none time. Uh at another time uh there was a uh young man whom we knew from the\nswimming pool and when it was still open to Jews uh we would go swimming there, my\nbrother and I, and uh uh one time uh a young fellow about our age uh started beating us up\nand if we had really resisted that would have made it worse, and uh as as as a sort of a\npsychological note, this man's, this young man's name was was Moses. He was not Jewish\nand I think uh his aggressiveness stemmed from the fact that at one time people thought this\nwas a Jewish firm. They of course immediately changed their name from Moses to Mosel\n(ph) and uh uh IJ uh later on, getting back to my home town as a soldier, I found out that he\nwas captured in in Russia and had a real sense of satisfaction about it. (laughter) But these\nwere some of the incidents, the tightening uh at home - things we couldn't do anymore. You,\nthere were many places where you couldn't go on vacation any more. These were mild\nthings, but being beaten up at the swimming pool, I I felt it was getting worse and worse. My\nparents as well, and so they uh in in 1936 really was when they made serious efforts to\ncontact our relatives in uh St. Louis in order to try getting us out.",
        "A: Very early. Uh my Uncle Beno (ph), uh my my mother's brother, uh was somewhat of a\nrebel as a boy and the, my my grandfather whom I loved was also the typical German\npatriarch, and any sign of rebelliousness was immediately uh was first uh there came stern\nwarnings and when Uncle Beno became, still was not conforming to family rules, they\nshipped him to another relative in St. Louis, that America was a place (laughter) for for uh\ndisobedient sons and daughters and so he was shipped out. Yes. (Laughter)",
        "A: The contact had been made. It had really never uh there was the obligatory letter of say two\nletters a year and uh he had gotten to St. Louis, had uh learned how to be a baker, and uh\nuntil the Depression had a steady job at at one of the uh bread factories, uh small uh\nneighborhood bakeries, and uh then with the Depression he lost his job, and uh so he,\nhowever, had a good rapport with the union leaders so they sent him on various temporary\njobs when somebody was sick or vacation or there was a special uh special demand for\nbakery goods, he was he was sent and so he would sometimes work three, four day...uh days\nand nights on end and then there would be uh absolutely no employment for for a month, but\nhe he was able to get his family through the worst times, but he certainly was in no way\nfinancially able uh to back up an affidavit even though he made out one. And uh that uh\ncame after I had gone on a bicycle trip with a Jewish group in 1937, I came home and my\nparents told me uh two affidavits are waiting for you - one from my uncle in St. Louis and\none by a children's organization also in St. Louis, both of them in in fact worthless as far as\nthe stipulations of the American government were concerned which wants to make sure by\nfinancial backing that the immigrant would not become a public charge. So uh the uh uh two\naffidavits were there. The children's affidavit worthless - I was fifteen at the time, hence I\nwas not a child and my uncle had no financial backing whatsoever. So, but I didn't know that\nthese affidavits were really insignificant as far as the American government was concerned.",
        "A: I (cough) I was uh able to secure a date from the American consul in very rapid order. Uh I\nhad come back from this bicycle trip, I now remember, in about August, and had my uh and\ntwo months later had already a date in October with the American consul in Hamburg which\nuh was, the distance was not very great and I was able to get a ride with a uh another family\nready to immigrate and we all went to Hamburg. Uh the next day I presented myself at at the\nAmerican consul's office. It was an encounter that lasted fifteen minutes and obviously\nchanged my life. Uh the American official - I shall never forget his name because uh uh\nindeed it was the most important fifteen minute encounter of my life - his name was\nMalcolm C. Burk (ph) and uh he asked absolutely inane questions. Uh in he was it it was\napparent that he wanted to have me succeed in getting getting his uh getting the visa and so\nhe asked me questions like uh I guess to ascertain my sanity (laughter) how much is uh is uh\n48 and 52. Uh I'm not good at numbers but that one I was up to. In fifteen minutes I had I\nhad his stamp on on my uh identification papers and uh never really wondered...I I thought\nthat was the way routinely matters went. And uh in November of that year I uh was uh\ninformed by a Jewish organization that they had a group of children uh that was going over\nto the United States and there was an escort, a woman...uh even right now under your\nquestions, Linda, my memory 1s jogged--uh Mrs. Epstein (ph) and uh she was on the boat\ngoing...taking us over and then coming back, having having fulfilled her mission. I uh\ndisembarked in New York. Uh a far-flung relative picked me up, then turned me over to the\nChildren's Committee the next day and uh they determined that my English was good\nenough uh that I could be sent on that long train trip from New York to St. Louis and so I\nhad arrived in in this country.",
        "A: Alright. IT I guess I'll I'll put myself on that train once more, because there was an\ninterruption. I had to change trains in Chicago, was picked up by a member of that\ncommittee and uh the this very nice woman said she could give me a short overview of\nChicago uh in two hours until my train to St. Louis was due. She took me in her car and the\nonly thing that I remembered today of course is some of the skyscrapers I had never seen\nbefore but also the absolute mad scene at Maxwell Market where she took me and it's...I\nguess one of my first impressions of the United States uh was was this market and and uh the\ntrading and and the office [ph] all that went with it. Uh then I arrived in St. Louis, was\npicked up - my relatives, picked up by my relatives, taken uh to their home and five days\nlater I was in an American high school. Uh a very good one. It was considered at that time,\nSouthern (ph) High School in St. Louis was considered to be on a par with some of the\neastern prep schools. Uh it uh I must say the education I had gotten in Germany both in high\nschool and and in a one room uh Jewish school was really geared me for what happened. I\ngraduated within two years in June '39 and that is when I uh it was obvious that my uncle\ncould not support me too. I started working in the high school lunch room. Uh then a teacher\nof uh a Jewish teacher took an interest in me, even though I had never taken a class with her,\nand she introduced me to the owner of a hotel chain - uh no, of the biggest hotel or the\nfanciest hotel in St. Louis, the Chase, and I became a bus boy there uh being trained first as a\nwater boy and uh then in fact uh throughout my uh college career until I had my Master's I\nworked as a busboy and waiter in various restaurants in St. Louis and New York, so that's\nwhat I did. Uh in, I graduated in '39, worked for one year to have a bit of a financial backing\nand then started on a part-time basis at St. Louis University, uh finished my uh my uh lower\ndivision courses by sort of uh the, II got myself a job at the hotel closest to the University,\none block away - the Melbourne (ph) Hotel which in fact today is a dormitory of the\nUniversity and uh sometimes ran from the one to the other uh coming to class in my bus boy\nuniform and uh that's uh what I did. And then of course came the war.",
        "A: Yes, by letters of course. Uh and uh in fact the last one I got we were desperately trying to\nhelp, finding people to give an affidavit to uh a whole family. It uh there's there's something\nthat I I guess I still regret because uh I uh didn't have much money so I hitchhiked all over\nSt. Louis going to movies that I wanted to see or to the uh Botanical Gardens or various\nplaces, and one time I was picked up by a man. He said, I have money. I I can do this, and I,\nhe he said but I must tell you, your the lawyers who will draw up this may uh uh may disdain\nmy profession and not do this. I'm a gambler. And he was a wonderful man, and he said I'll\ngo down with you to this lawyer and this lawyer, picked by the St. Louis Jewish community\nto help people like me uh was too short-sighted to see that all some consuls wanted was a\npiece of paper. He said I cannot accept your affidavit. You are not in the kind of profession\nthat the government will accept. It would have been, it would have been an easy thing to\nsimply make out the papers. Had they failed, so be it, but he was he he was so conventional\nand so hide-bound that he refused this man's uh bona fide_ and it was this is one of the things\nthat sometimes haunts me. Uh so I had my, the last letter I got from my parents was from the\nWarsaw ghetto. I don't know how it, whether that is customary or was still possible at the\nfirst uh at the in the first stages of the Warsaw ghetto to write communications from there,\nbut at any rate a letter reached me in St. Louis from the Warsaw ghetto in which of course it\nwas a very guarded letter. I realized how bad things were but uh that was the last time I\nheard of them and uh, well while I have no absolute proof, the presumption is of course they\ndied there. They were murdered.",
        "A: Uh I tried enlisting and at that time they were not uh enli...uh they did not accept uh non-\nnative Americans uh for uh for the Army or Navy. I was ultimately drafted in uh in '42. Uh at\nfirst was sent to a uh a medical administrative training camp in Camp Barkley, Texas. Had\nmy basic there and then was plucked out one day by special orders to join the Military\nIntelligence training camp at Camp Ritchie, Maryland. Uh most of us were of course because\nof our linguistic skills, having had college background and the like and uh so I graduated\nfrom the eighth class of Military Intelligence Training Camp - it's not too far here from\nWashington. I visited 1t again, and uh then was, they put together teams for of interrogators.\nUh after some uh additional training and uh being stationed in England, we joined Ist U.S.\nArmy, then readying itself for the uh invasion, and their headquarters was in Bristol,\nEngland. Then uh on D-Day we of course were mar...uh we went to the Marshall (ph) area\nwhich was Southampton, got on the LSD's and uh took part in the invasion. It was uh it was\nmy first time, even though we had of course had mock interrogations back in camp uh and\ntrained, and be train...been trained in all sorts of things from German army organization to uh\nterrain intelligence - it was my first real interrogation with tough Nazis on the beaches of\nNormandy. And uh it was uh an experience that I've written about uh and I think what turned\nuh turned me uh into a uh removed all my sense of inferiority as an interrogator was that was\nmy fourth or fifth interrogation when an artillery shell came over the uh interrogation tents\nand uh we, both the prisoner and I, hit the ground and uh he uh showed far greater fright than\nI did. And then everything went smoothly and I was able to extract interrogation from\nbeginning in Normandy to the end of until V-E Day and uh in fact uh I, my reports uh\napparently were well-received. I I got the Bronze Star uh from General Hodges towards the\nend of the war.",
        "A: Uh I I think uh most of our responsibility was of course extracting tactical and strategic\nin..information and uh some of it was very easy because the uh prisoners didn't realize that\nuh what they were giving away or we bluffed that we already knew uh or we uh tried to uh\nuh create the impression that a buddy already had told us. Uh that was, that was fairly easy.\nSome of them, some of the information uh was so uh obvious what we were after and so\nthreatening to the prisoner that it, that we really had to use some very tough psychological\nwarfa...uh uh what we had learned as psychological warfare and really put psychological\npressures on the prisoners, and uh most of the time that worked. As uh as a rather neglected\nbut uh byline we told to ferret out war criminals and uh those uh guilty of uh genocide and\nand so forth and uh the first inklings we got of what really had happened were when we did\nextract such information from prisoners. Uh we would get a a soldier...a German soldiers,\nnot high in rank, about our age and uh as you bored in your interrogation, he would admit\nthat at one time he had been a concentration camp guard, particularly a guard in the early\nstages of the concentration camp, before the extermination camps set in. And uh uh they uh\nwhat what struck us at that time was the absolute inability to see the enormity of what they\nhad done. Uh I remember one prisoner and in fact I took his confession, in fact have uh have\nit still, uh where he said uh that he had been a guard at the Oranienburg concentration camp\nnear Berlin and that he had frequently volunteered for execution uh uh squads and I asked\nhim, well why did you volunteer. He said well, if I hadn't done it they would have gotten\nsomebody else, and one of the bonuses if you volunteered for an execution sq...squad was\nthat you got a pass, an additional pass to go into Berlin, and you know, he said, uh very\nconversationally almost, you know, at that time they still had all the concert halls open and I\nloved getting to these concert halls and hearing the concerts there, and so I volunteered for\nthe execution squads. He was particularly fond of Beethoven and Mozart. So these were the\nfirst uh interrogations were...1t came about that we uh ferreted out some of the minor, small-\nfry criminals. The first uh really significant war criminal or let us say against humanity was a\nuh a man who who we uncovered in an absolute absurd way - it was not our skill but uh a\ncombination of circumstances that brought about his unmasking. Uh my we uh I I have to\ngive you a bit of background - that day, it was a, it was the day of Roosevelt's death and we\nwere very upset and uh so uh uh one of the MP's brought in that day a prisoner, a young\nfellow, and uh he said this this fellow has a picture of Himmler autographed tn his uh in his\npossession and so uh Freddie, my friend Fred Howard and I uh saw that picture. We were\nangry and so we took the picture away from the prisoner who said that he was a nephew of\nHeinrich Himmler and so we took the picture and uh we cut, cut, cut it out, the photograph\nand put a rope around his neck and hung it on a goose-neck lamp that was 1n our\ninterrogation camp, hanging him in effigy. Later that day, very late at night, Freddie ushered\nin a routine prisoner. He was, had just been captured, a uh Dr. Schuebbe (ph) from\nWestphalia, and uh this is, this man seemed disoriented. One of our prisoner trustees\nimmediately caught on - he said drugs. And so uh uh this man was under the illusion, seeing\nthe picture of Himmler and we were interrogating in short sleeves - it was, you know, very\ninformal and we were not in uniform - and uh so he had the delusion that he was at a\nGestapo headquarters, with the picture of Himmler, of course, prominently displayed. And\nhe said, oh, I'm glad to be here. I belong to you too. And so uh Freddie caught on uh this\ndelusion and he said well, we know who we are - who the hell are you? And so uh he uh\nunder the guise of try...of having him prove his credentials, drew everything out of him,\nincluding the fact that he had personally killed upward of twenty thousand people in in\nPo...1n Poland and Russia. Uh you know, in the early stages of mass extermination, they used\nmorphine injections, M Preparat, as he called it, and he had gotten addicted himself, so uh he\nwas shipped out and that's how he landed in our uh in our prisoner of war enclosure, and he\nretold in precise medical detail - uh I even remember the words - uh how a prisoner died.\nYou know, he said, oh well, we uh injected them with the uh \"M\" Preparation, morphine,\nand then he, after a while a certain euphoria was uh present, 1s, is a state of mind in the\nprisoner, then - and sort of said it exetentiously (ph) tallis, very medical, and we were uh uh,\nFreddie, I I uh was putting all this down and then uh he uh uh I I made a mistake. I came, uh\nit was late at night. I wanted a cup of coffee and Freddie had a little stove there. I came in\nand I was dressed in a Russian uniform. It was one of the tricks we used tn order to extract\nuh information from the German prisoners of war. They uh, I was supposed to be a Russian\nliaison officer who would take recalcitrant prisoners uh and and ship them off to Russia. It\nwas a very effective dig...disguise and uh very effective in putting psychological pressure on\nprisoners. I walked in and that startled him and uh Freddie, of course, caught the drift and\nimmediately pretended throwing me out, that I was a uh a prisoner who was doing menial\nservice and had just wandered in. That gave him pause and then he made a second mistake\nand that was the uh that he gave him coffee uh in this long interrogation and uh then uh he\ncame out of the morphine, and he retracted everything. In the next couple of days we did\nreally work hard to break him down. We took no-sleep tablets and it was just the routine type\nof interrogation that you sometimes see on police procedural detective stories - just\nhammering away again and again and again and by that time he was so exhausted as were\nwe that he once more uh gave us the whole information. Uh the uh the in the first week of\nMay issue of Time magazine carried the story and so did - we had in the meanwhile uh\nconquered Luxembourg as you'll recall, and Radio Luxembourg became one of the powerful\nuh uh radio communication networks for the Allied forces and Radio Luxembourg broadcast\nverbatim - we took the uh interrogation down verbatim - uh broadcast that both in English\nand German, broadcast that all over for about two weeks. It was probably my biggest case\nand uh it was uh a pure accident, so you can imagine had it not been for all these\ncircumstances working together, he would have slipped right by us. And probably be living a\nshort uh living a long life in practicing medicine someplace in a rural town in Westphalia or\nelsewhere. Uh he was executed by the Czechoslovakians later on. Uh he was turned over to\nthem because he, many Czechs had been killed by him, so uh I could put that into medical\nterms but shan't.",
        "A: Uh we we had one who was very high in the medical profession. You know, the uh people\nthe doctors without humanity which was of the titles of the books about them. I told you\nabout some of the minor war criminals. Uh the uh one of the cases that stick...sticks in my\nmind but is really less relevant for Holocaust except for possibly uh the uh stupidity and\narrogance of some of our, of our officers, uh not our officers but of the uh...our officers, most\nof them were very excellent interrogators. Uh uh occasionally uh they were less adapt and\nthey had to call in a certain enlisted man. Uh this was true of a case of Colonel Fundeheider\n(ph). He uh was a professor of law, had become a leader of parachute troops and during the\nBattle of the Bulge uh had been ordered to take a paratroop troop uh to fight against us. They\nwere dropped at the wrong at the wrong place and quickly taken prisoner. Uh I uh I uh was\nultimately selected to interrogate him, and for that you put on higher insignia in order to be\non a par with your German prisoner, and uh so I interrogated Colonel Fundeheider and uh he\nhad had part of his law education under a Rockefeller grant in the United States, and he\nstarted telling me that and I paid no attention and then he said, of course I can't tell you\nnothing but my name and rank. I said, oh, I wouldn't expect a high-ranking officer like you\nto tell me anymore. Besides, you did such an inept, stupid, dumb uh uh uh dumb attack with\nyour parachute troops, dropping them off at the wrong place - uh we really don't want to\nknow anything about you. He he pulled himself up 1n his chair and started shouting at me.\nHe said, how can you say that. That's wasn't my fault. That was the Air Force's fault, and I\nsaid, \"Oh, we heard from your prisoners. You were you were completely out of it even in\ncamp when you trained these troops,\" and in in defending himself, (laughter) how, what a\ngreat field commander he had been, he told me absolutely everything - how the troops were\ntrained, what was their special mission, uh every detail. I egged him on - uh time after time,\nuh and I said well, maybe it wasn't quite so bad, but didn't you do this and then he would\nagain explain this, and at the end of the interrogation, I said uh, Colonel, uh uh I uh really I I\nI honor your uh silence and uh I know you can't tell me anything and sent him off.\n(Laughter) It was one of the funniest uh interrogations I I had uh during the entire war uh\nand it was it's memorable. He ended up then as a law professor at the University of\nWuerzburg after the war. I never looked him up of course.",
        "A: Uh, no. They were uh, they were all this these kinds of small-fry, people who had been\nguards uh and who really uh I, in the...I can say in the aggregate, I uh that uh they were\nabsolutely negligible as persons, but in the aggregate, they really had no conscience. They\nthey realized, they had no idea really what they had done. Uh as a matter of fact, under your\nprodding, I do remember one case - he was a Romanian who had volunteered for the SS, or\nhad been drafted. I can't recall that for sure, but uh under intense interrogation, he told us that\nhe had sort of conducted a personal vendetta against a family in his hometown in Romania,\nhad showed up at their house and simply shot them. Uh uh and so uh if 1f memories sort of\ncome back and uh he uh said while I went into this house of the Frankels (ph), I think that\nwas their name, and uh simply, I I wanted some of the stuff in their house uh and he simply\nshot them right there on the spot. And that of course uh js a uh 1s a story that uh still remains.\nUh it uh among those whom we liberated uh one of the more memorable scenes was uh and\nprobably not very well known - uh the Germans had not, had put into prisons but not\nconcentration camps some of the veterans of the Spanish Republican Army, and these uh uh\nmen uh whom Spanish officers we had liberated for the, they had been asked to dig defenses\nin France, but they had earlier been on the Channel Islands, which the Germans had taken\nover and built fortifications there. So uh I uh since I had uh studied Spanish in in high\nschool, in - no, not in high school, in college - I was asked to interrogate them, and so I uh\nthey were of course not just uh re...uh reluctant witnesses but they were just so overly willing\nto give uh everything away and and tell what the fortifications were, and uh the one in fact\nwas an engineer and drew me a very detailed and sophisticated map of all the fortifications\non the Channel Islands that he had helped build. And uh if we had ever invaded the Channel\nIslands, we would have (laughter) had the most detailed situation map that you could have\nimagined. But of course that never materialized, but that was, is another memorable uh\ninterrogation because of course the higher headquarters saw it and uh that was the kind of\ndetail that was very rare, even though it proved outwardly to be utterly useless. Uh but that\nis, those are some of the interrogations that I recall, except one of curious coincidence. This\nwas at the uh right after the uh invasion of Normandy. We pushed forward into France and\nwe had virtually surrounded the uh German uh troops uh between the two cities of Falaise\n(ph) and Argentan (ph). And uh there was one gap - uh there's a new book, just came out -\nit's being reviewed and this book uh uh on World War II says the gap, had Montgomery\nacted faster would have been closed and the war might have stopped right then and there or\nat least in the war in the west, and uh had we uh were unable to close it but we took\nthousands of prisoners near Falaise and Argentan and so we had to do uh we had to do uh\nwork very quickly with the prisoners and had no time except pick out some that by uh\nvir...by the testimony of their of their paybooks were important. So uh, I flipped through\nstacks upon stacks of paybooks uh which were in, were very detailed. The, not like our\nidentification papers which gave virtually nothing away, but their's gave last leave, and I\nflipped through and I find a paybook, Gunther H., from my home town of Hildesheim, a\nlieutenant. And I thought this this can't be a coincidence...it can't be uh a strange...this must\nbe the Gunther H. whom I went went to the same athletic club with. So I waited till 1t was\npitch dark that night, and interrogated him in darkness, of course using his home background\nuh to extract information and he was peering through the darkness because it was so obvious\nthat I uh knew a heck of a lot about him, and at the end of it he said, uh how do you know so\nmuch about me, and I said well, I had also seen I was prepared for that question, that he had\nearned a high decoration and I said, well we in intelligence keep book on all those who are\nhighly decorated uh officers in the German army, and then sent him out. It was uh this this\nkind of war coincidence--I've written about this because uh he might still be alive for all I\nknow. It's exactly my age and uh a rather unprepossessing, uninteresting fellow when I was\nin the Turnverein--Athletic Club--Eintracht in Hildesheim with him uh and he had developed\ninto apparently a quite a warrior because uh that decoration wasn't given away uh to just\nanyone.",
        "A: No. I II have to be honest. It, since we had this, you know, uh surrounded Argentan and\nFalaise and I had not picked him for uh his potential as an informant but simply because I\nwas interested whether it was the same fellow and uh just to see him again. Uh he he was, it\nwas not productive, but it was a curious coincidence.",
        "A: Surely.",
        "A: If something occurs I'll I'll insert them.",
        "A: Uh, the uh guards were sort of strewn across our path as we advanced into Germany, and\nmore and more of these uh small-fry prisoners who had been guards and who told us\nsomething of the horrors of the concentration camp. Then Schuebbe, that came right after we\ncrossed over uh across the Rhine. I think it was in Bad Andernach that we uh our prisoner of\nwar camp was when we encountered Schuebbe. Uh then at the end of the war uh when uh\nwe had uh linked, uh almost linked with the Russians, uh were in that sector going through\nHesse-we were at Hersfeld and then we came upon the concentration camp Buchenwald. It,\nuh we were not among the fir...the troops who came there the first day and I heard from\nsome of them uh there uh utter horror and uh completely uh overwhelmed by by the sights.\nWe came one day later and yet uh not much had changed because we could not, there was no\nway of evacuating uh the prisoners to a to another place. We, of course, sent in physicians.\nWe sent in food, clothing and the like and uh uh what uh the way these faces looked - I don't\nmean simply emaciated as you see, but some pie...one person whose jaw was hanging\nvirtually loose. A tall man, emaciated with a loose-hanging jaw. I mean you you - these are\ndetails that stick in your head and in your mind and you uh you don't get over that very\neasily, and uh uh I I talked to some of them and uh they uh it 1t was, you know, they\nembraced you uh and you you felt why do I, I'm not a liberator. You know, I I wasn't in the\ncamp when it was liberated but there was this uh curious uh immediate heart-to-heart\nmeeting. Uh and one of the...we were, the prisoners of war contingent was there at\nBuchenwald but so was our uh MP outfit, a platoon of MP's that had served virtually from\nthe very beginning, had accompanied all us all through France and Germany uh and we had\nof course worked very closely with each other because when you uh interrogated you needed\nthe safety of of the prisoners uh the the guards and you told them what you were doing and\nthere was a real wonderful working relationship. The uh in charge of uh, nominally in charge\nwas a captain, but the real disciplinarian of that MP company was a Master Sergeant Hadley\nfrom Steubenville, Ohio. And uh uh I uh had, I was of the same rank for much of the time\nand uh so we had struck up a real friendship. I have, he was the prototype of the tough,\nread...and ready to fight U.S. Sergeant and an MP besides. You know, they have additional\nuh set of calluses all over their body. And uh uh Sergeant Hadley, I, we didn't arrive at the\nsame time, and uh I was looking around - I I I guess the uh emotions were so overwhelming\nthat I looked for some sign uh maybe that's mental cowardice, that I was looking for some\nsign of something normal, so I looked for buddies uh who had come to the camp with us, and\nI saw one who had sort of cradled his eyes with his arm like this, and uh I I recognized him\nimmediately - it it was Sergeant Hadley, and he was bawling like a child. Uh it 1t was it was\ngetting to all of us. And uh in in my case that was all the more understandable, because, you\nknow, it was a very personal crusade, the war, and a very personal uh involvement with my\nparents and my brother and my sister over there, and uh I didn't know their fate at that time\nbut I could surmise and but this, for generations we had talked about our uh heritage and the\nlike, at one time this Sergeant Hadley and I, and he was for generations in in Ohio and uh his\nfamily and but and he was not personally involved but he just uh uh broke down completely\nand I I was told by other members of uh who came to Buchenwald at various times that the\nsame thing had happened to uh General Eisenhower when he came there.",
        "A: Alright. Fine.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Uh, we had hung up uh these uh big containers of water and prisoners were clustering\naround them because they of course didn't have even an abundance of water during the time\nof captivity. And uh uh then we had set up uh a uh aa uh station where we had, were\ndispensing food. And uh our physicians who were treating some of the worst cases uh had\ncame to uh came to the chow line. We had given them uh little containers where they, you\nknow, uh field kits and uh what the physicians were fighting the prisoners was that they took\nvery small portions at first uh and I remember one scene where a medical officer, a captain\nwhom I had seen because at one time I also had to interrogate prisoners in the field hospital\nwhere they were being treated, and uh I had seen him before and met him there again at uh\nBuchenwald and I had seen him at his, in the field hospital and he was one of those spit-and-\npolish officers, despite the fact that he was a physician, but he was running that field\nhospital. I I I think I only had one or two encounters with him before and there he was, again\na a person who in the months between the invasion and uh and uh the end of the war had\nbeen toughened by combat, and there he was standing with a a with an emaciated - well, they\nwere all emaciated - with a man who who had who was ready to eat ravenously and and he\nput his arm around him, and the, he was in a spit-and-polish uniform and the prisoner was\ndirty as they were all, and he put his arm around him and he he said to him, I heard him...he\nsaid, take a little now. We will take you back later, but to eat a lot now is very dangerous for\nyou, and so he led him away. Very gently. Uh what uh uh what also impressed me 1s that uh\nthe prisoners were not able to shed, to I I think deep down inside they weren't all that sure\nthat a new, that all that was behind them, and so they would still uh walk to that chow line in\nsomewhat of a make-shift formation. It was pitiful because they were free now, but they\nwould still gather as though there was an SS uh SS guard hounding them. And uh uh they uh\ndidn't walk erect uh and they uh were, there were some who uh came to attention when an\nAmerican officer came, as though there was, you know, it was apparently at that moment not\nquite comprehensible that they they were free, they were there, that the the oppression and\nthe horror had ended, and this was not Day |. This was Day 2 uh and it still in some, they\nwere uh so shaken and and so uh uh still enwrapped in in the environment that had been their\nlot for so for so long a time that they could not shed the uh image of what or or the\nexperience that had lain before. Uh I walked around uh once uh. There was, oh yes. There\nwas a small cr...sort of not even a creek, sort of a uh a little bit of a puddle running through\nuh through the camp and one prisoner was getting ready to stoop down to uh drink this uh\nmuddy water which he obviously had done before, and so uh not I but somebody else just\nsort of put his hand under his elbow and said uh, over there. You know, he couldn't speak\nthe, it was it was I guess one of our MP's who who uh uh couldn't speak German uh and just\npointed to the water containers and then then the man uh who had already stooped down\ncame up again and walked over to the water container, so the, it it you are what what to\nsummarize it, it was almost as if you had to unlearn the concentration camp experience.\nThese are some of the memories. Uh I I must admit that we didn't stay long. It 1t was, uh II\nthink some uh some threw up at that sight. I didn't, but uh I was very queasy and uh we we\nleft with our our captain, Captain Kahn (ph) uh had had gathered us and said back to the,\nback to our quarters, and we left.",
        "A: No. I I I just, I I I must say I walked around the grounds but I did not go into the barracks\nbecause uh most of most of the prisoners were not in the barracks. They had come out, I\nguess to greet every more ever fresh visitors because once that first uh wave of visitors was\nover uh others came and they were, they showed the same gratefulness again and again and\nagain. As we were leaving, another uh troop - I don't know who they were, American troop -\ncame to Buchenwald just to see it, and uh uh again the same scene of coming to the fence\nand greeting the Americans and uh and no - I did not go in the barracks.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Uh as you know, they were mass burials. They were uh simply uh taken and uh as I recall,\nuh we had, they uh - oh yeah, the the commander who was met, who came to Buchenwald\nthe first day had gotten some of the local villagers uh to come to the camp, and they were\nhelping in the burial detail. And there were mass graves that I think the uh uh I wasn't there\nwhen they were dug. They were there and uh it was obvious that some of the people who\nwere still walking would not make it. Oh, I I did talk to one of, to that same physician whom\nI knew slightly - I said Captain, what are the chances here of survival of these people. And\nhe said, well I can't give you statistics or anything like that, but a good many won't make it,\neven now that we have the medic...the medicine here. Uh he said uh my commanding officer\nhas asked for more medicine and uh we'll have it but I am afraid it'll be too late, so I'm uh by\nhis testimony uh many more than already were were dead would join them before we could\ndo a darn thing for them.",
        "A: One of the things that uh uh struck me, as I said I wasn't in the barracks, but the ground was\nso muddy, you know, with all the people walking around, and these these, many didn't have\nshoes and so the the mud and the grime was all the way - this seems a silly thing to\nremember because, you know, but you know as a soldier you are trained to be always, you\nknow, completely neat even even (laughter) if you are going to battle or whatever and and uh\nI I was not a front-line soldier but even those uh had, the first thing they were asked is to and\nit struck me at the incredible filth and dirt and each time they put their foot down, that water\nfrom that mud would once more uh send sprinkles up on to on to their pajama uniforms and\nto their legs and uh uh this is an image that also you see as they were sort of stomping around\nthe the campsite - it's a little detail but it it's again something that sticks with you.",
        "A: I left Buchenwald and uh then uh we sort of carried on for a short while and in those uh\ncouple of days after the, after V-E day uh where we all celebrated of course, uh our captain\nsaid well, we haven't had any orders not to interrogate any more. (laughter) So uh curiously\nenough, even though the war was over, and at this time uh we did concentrate more on those\npeople who had been guards and the like, and we were even asked by uh some of the people\nalready designated to be in military government, to see whether we couldn't come up what\nwere called black and white lists. In short, uh trying to interrogate people who had been\nparticularly helpful and had left, had led lives of some virtue during the Nazi period and\nsome of the uh uh some of the villains. We turned these lists over to uh military government\nlater on. I don't think much happened with them, or that they were taken very seriously but\nthat we did and perhaps they should have been taken more seriously, because our our job\nwas done, and we could only pass on. Uh one of the stories that remains, and that happened\nearlier while we were in Belgium - it was the interrogation of my friend, he's still a friend of\nmine - these friendships have lasted from these uh compacted years of three years of\ninterr...or two years of interrogation, uh the most intensive uh intense days of our lives really,\ncause we had a mission, and Carley (ph) had the most curious case. He wrote about it later\non for commentary, but I know some of the details because I saw part of it, and that was the\ncase of the Jewish SS girl. Uh and I uh I think it it's uh it's so again uh so convoluted that and\nthe coincidences that this that this came to our attention and that we uh, that this girl got to\nthat stage. She was a Belgian girl from Brussels and her parents, after the uh Germans had\ntaken uh Belgium, managed to flee to France. Uh uh they got uh they got as far as the uh city\nof Montalbon (ph) and here the uh Catholic bishop in Montalbon uh took it upon himself to\nsave some of the Jewish children, and what he did is he placed them with Catholic French\nfamilies, cause they all spoke French being from Belgium, and he placed some of these\nBelgium children with uh uh with uh Catholic families and then uh the Germans of course\ncame as far as Montalbon and they started first to deport Jews, and uh she still saw, by her\ntestimony uh she saw her parents being rounded up on one of set of trucks that uh gathered\nin the uh in the uh city hall square of Montalbon. Uh then the Germans started recruiting\nFrench laborers to work in German armament industries and one day she, of course taken as\na Catholic girl from Monalbon, was also told to report for duty in Germany, and was shipped\nto the LUNA-Werke in Leipzig, and she was, as she told us, she was so scared that she\nperformed at with greater eagerness than even the, well certainly with greater eagerness than\nthe other forced laborers who were of course also asked to work at top performance, and so\nshe came to the attention to uh one woman foreman. She said wow, this woman, she really\nputs her heart into it. We're going to make her an SS auxiliary. And she had, there was no\nway she could protest this, and uh so she uh, we found her together with another SS auxiliary\nwoman. Uh we uh took her prisoner in France, in I beg your pardon, in Belgium, uh on the\nGerman, near the German border and when she, when Carley was interrogating her, she said,\nuh I'm Jewish. And he, he he, of course, you know, with with all the skepticism that we had\nheard all, every kind of story of exculpation and every kind of story of phoniness, you know\n- that was our job and uh and Carley said, you are what? Come on. Uh and uh then she\nexplained what I have just told you, and Carley still didn't uh believe a word of it. He said it's\na very clever uh clever way, and then he called over - we had uh a, we had a young Belgium\nworking with our CIC detachment, and he was from Brussels, so Carley called him in and\nsaid come on here, and of course the uh Belgian, Jacques, didn't believe it either, so uh he uh\nthey both were sort of kidding and uh so uh she he uh asked her, at at this point I I joined\nthem, uh and he asked her uh - OK, you you you're from, you're a Jewish girl from uh\nBrussels. Uh OK, name some of the uh name some of the suburbs of Brussels.? They started\noff like that, and then she just rattles them off. And uh then he said, where's the big\nsynagogue in Brussels. She knew that. Then he asked her about uh some of the Jewish\nrituals. Absolutely solid. And uh then uh he said what was your name in Brussels. And it\nturned out that he knew her brother. So the story was true. Not a good friend or anything like\nthat...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Carley Fr , and uh he lives in New York, and uh we sometimes talk about these days.",
        "A: We sent her off with the next transport because we really didn't want to know.",
        "A: No. Apparently she was most of the time a uh forced laborer and uh as the SS auxiliaries,\nyou know, they were used in uh as clerical help. I I don't think she ever did anything that\nwould uh truly be war criminal or something like that. Uh but I don't, I don't know that and I\nI think once we had identified her uh it it went so deep that we, that we we really didn't want\nto know. We really didn't. And that's how Carley's story, if you ask him, would end. We\nnever know what happened to her.",
        "A: I, of the wartime period - uh I, I don't think so. II think I I've really uh come up with with\nthose where my, where where memory speaks and uh where I uh, which which stick out. Uh\nmuch of it is is lost wartime stories. And uh they are, perhaps in another context might\nbecome interesting, but by and large, I I've seen uh many of the people again with whom I\nserved, many of them Jewish, many of them sharing or having shared the same experience.\nUh and uh curiously enough, it, whenever we do meet -as happened only day before\nyesterday while I was at the University of Massachusetts, and somebody who was in the\nsame unit with me for a while, Professor Henry Lee, and I shared some of our memories.\nThat's inevitable. But I I think uh these are some of the more impress...memories that\nimpress me today in looking back.",
        "A: Uh I uh [had the, my my ambition was uh to become a journalist, and one of my uh officers\nin Military Intelligence had been uh Sheppard Stone (ph) who was on the staff of the New\nYork Times. He had given me a very warm recommendation uh to the Managing Editor, and\nuh so on the strength of that I left St. Louis, came to New York, and uh started working in a\nrestaurant, introduced myself to the Managing Editor who on the strength of this letter saw\nme not once but several times. Couldn't find a spot for me because they were uh double-\nplatooned so to speak because many of their correspondents were coming back and had a\nclaim on their old jobs and then those who had done wartime service also had uh still had\ntheir jobs. There was no uh uh opportunity to to start at the New York Times then, so I\ndecided to keep on working uh as a waiter and start college again, and I uh uh started, in uh\n'46, I started at Hofstra (ph) University, then Hofstra College, graduated in '48, uh went on\nfor graduate work at Columbia uh and uh then uh got my first job uh and ultimately became\nboth an administrator - I was, I wrote uh on on the field of Germanistics (ph), and here 1s\nwhere really the experiences where I had to make a personal decision, and it was sort of a\nwatershed and I was at Columbia. Uh I could, uh could have entered of course a variety of\nfields. I found to my satisfaction and that of my professors that I had some gifts for German\nliterature and for German cultural history, and so they encouraged me to stay with it. I had\nreally looked at it as as a transit to comparative literature, but they offered me an\nassistantship and an instructorship uh and so I stuck in Germanistics and then uh the\nexistential question came - uh if you, I said to myself, if you stay in German studies, you\nobviously will have to deal with Germany and Germans. And uh so I asked myself whether\nthat, whether I could do it, and I uh came to the recognition that I indeed had a gift and to\ndeny it or to uh let it lie fallow would be an act of self-amputation, very much like the one\nthey were going to inflict on me. It was doing the work of enemy, so uh I decided to stay in\nGerman and this came somewhat later and I also thought that if I could uh analyze literature\nand if I could uh write about German literature, I could certainly do that work for those who\nhad been exiled from from Germany during the Nazi period, and I became in somewhat of a\nscholar of uh exile literature and of those who and the writings of writers who uh perished in\nthe concentration camps, and I've written on that uh and uh last last year a book called\n\"Literature...\", or in German, Literatur in Exil, which was published in Germany and I think\nlooking back, I've made the right decision, because uh I've lent, lent voice to some writers\nwho possibly without me might be forgotten or not remembered very often, so I have uh in a\nway uh kept their memory and the memory of their writings alive.",
        "A: I hope so.",
        "A: I suppose the kind of work you do here in keeping the memory of of those of the Holocaust\nalive touches very closely on my work as well, and uh so I have frequently interviewed, of\ncourse from a literary and historical perspective, uh those who uh either survived, for\nexample H. D. Adler (ph) who survived in Theresienstadt and has written a book about it -\nI've interviewed him. I've uh interviewed some people who were hidden in Berlin uh and are\nwriters today. I've interviewed many of the exiles who came to the United States, so I I think\nuh in a way this kind of oral history, whether yours or mine, uh may help to resuscitate some\npeople from being forgotten.",
