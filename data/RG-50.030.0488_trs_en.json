        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "Q: It\u2019s nice to see you here.",
        "A: Nice to be here.",
        "Q: Good. Tell me your name.",
        "A: \u2019'm Ursula Pawel. P-a-w-e-l.",
        "Q: And that was not your name at birth, was it?",
        "A: No, my maiden name was Lenneberg, L-e-n-n-e-b-e-r-g.",
        "Q: And when -- when were you born? Your birth --",
        "A: Four 24 - 26.",
        "Q: Four 20 --",
        "A: April 24\", 1926.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay. And where were you born?",
        "A: In Dortmund, in Germany.",
        "Q: And let\u2019s talk a -- a little bit about your family.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollections of your family before 1933 when the Nazis take over, or was it",
        "A: Oh yes, I do.",
        "Q: You do?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What do you remember?",
        "A: Well, I remember the place we lived in, which was a suburb of Dortmund, called Aplerbeck.\nAnd my father was the manager of a department store, a chain of department stores owned by a\nJewish concern called Karstadt. And I remember that department store, and I remember the --\nsome of the outbuildings that housed all kinds of boxes that we would play in, and play house in.\nAnd I also remember learning how to ride a bike. I was about seven years old, and one of the\njanitors taught me how to ride a bike. And I also remember when my father lost his job, and\nthere was a change. We had to move out of our apartment, which was above the department store\nin a -- it was a huge building, because in 1933, that concern was, in quote, Aryanized. So my\nfather really lost his job in 1933. And instead of leaving Germany, he bought a store just a few --\nmaybe a block up the road, and the owners of that store were a bit smarter. They went to South\nAfrica. And I don\u2019t remember this, but it was repeated in my family ca -- so many times, that Mr.\nRosenstein told my father that they\u2019re going to have signs on buses that Jews can\u2019t ride a bus.\nAnd everybody who was Jewish in that town thought this was hilarious. This wasn\u2019t going to -- I\nmean, what is he talking about, this guy is crazy.",
        "Q: Not so crazy.",
        "A: Not so crazy.",
        "Q: What was your father\u2019s name?",
        "A: Otto.",
        "Q: And your father -- am I correct to say that he had one leg, that he had a leg amputated when\nhe was a --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not true?",
        "A: It was my grandfather.",
        "Q: Oh it was your grandfather, I see.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah, was my grandfather, he had a leg amputated, and why, nobody really knows. They said\n-- there was some rumors that he had diabetes and they apparently weren\u2019t substantiated, and\nthere were also rumors in the family that the wrong leg was amputated. So I really have no clue,\nall I know, that my grandparents who lived in Dusseldorf, there was -- there were no closets in\nhomes in Germany. There was a corner that had a curtain, and it was used like a -- like a closet,\nand there was a wooden leg in that corner. And I was very nosey as a young child, I opened\nevery drawer and every -- every, you know, I looked into every crevice. And I saw that wooden\nleg for the first time and it was kind of upsetting to me.",
        "Q: Yeah, I would imagine.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you ask people about it?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure, I don\u2019t recall.",
        "Q: Excuse me.",
        "A: Yeah. I know I wasn\u2019t supposed to look in there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So whether I had the guts to ask --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- Ima -- I really don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: And your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Schneider. My mother was -- came from a Christian family. Her\nname was Lina Caroline, after she came to this country, but Lina Schneider. And it was a\nProtestant family, supposedly, but later on we found out that my grandfather was really from a\nCatholic background, which he never admitted while he was alive. And my mother had been a\nbuyer for a department store where she met my father, who was also a buyer. It was not a s -- it\nwas not Karstadt, 1t was another department store. She had been 1n training as a fairly young\nwoman. In those days people didn\u2019t go to college. In Nassau\u2019s department store in Dortmund, my\ngrandmother went to Mr. Nassau and said that her -- he -- her daughter was very interested in\nclothing and in -- in -- in mode. And Mr. Nassau -- my -- my grandmother was a good customer,\nsaid, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you bring her along?\u201d And -- and this is where she started, and she was a\nvery, very gifted woman, it turned out later on, and this is how she made her career, as a -- first\nas a salesperson, and then she became a buyer, and then she became buyer like -- Karstadt is like\nMacy\u2019s. She became a buyer at Karstadt.",
        "Q: And -- but your parents met before she started working at Karstadt, is that right?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: They had met before.",
        "A: Yeah, they -- they met, I don\u2019t know exactly when. They married in 1925, and my mother\nconverted to Judaism. And I was raised as a Jew, and then my brother was born in 1930, and he\nwas -- we were both raised as Jews.",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t realize that your mother had converted. Was that unusual at the time?",
        "A: Wa -- maybe it was for some people, but not for my mother. Don\u2019t forget, she really was in a\nJewish environment fr-from -- as a fairly young woman. She was more Jewish than my father\nwas, I mean as far as Jewish expressions, and as far as the Jewish food. My father was really an\nagnostic, and my mother -- people actually, during the persecution, always thought my mother\nwas Jewish, and not my father.",
        "Q: And not your father.",
        "A: Yeah. And -- yeah, she was -- sh-she -- and actually her family was wonderful. My\ngrandparents loved my father, and this -- especially her two sisters, to the point during the Nazi\ntime where my mother\u2019s youngest sister, as they always accused her that she couldn\u2019t keep her\nmouth shut, she ended up in a work camp. So, it just gives you just an -- and actually, my -- my\nmother\u2019s parents were much more tolerant of that marriage than my father\u2019s parents. My Jewish\ngrandmother did not like the idea of a goyte coming into her house, and even though she\nconverted.",
        "Q: She still wasn\u2019t Jewish to her.",
        "A: She wa -- she still wasn\u2019t Jewish, and -- and -- and the ridiculous part is that my grandmother\nLenneberg, she was a total agnostic, she didn\u2019t keep any of the Jewish holidays, and they were\ntotally assimilated. But the idea that her son, her favorite son would marry a goyte, didn\u2019t quite\ngo down well. Then her oldest son, Erich, who was really like a black sheep in the family, not a\nvery good person, and who she didn\u2019t like, but he married later. He met a Catholic woman who\nwas a very good person, Erich was not. And she was a very strict Catholic, and she became\npregnant before they got married. And don\u2019t you know that my mother -- my grandmother\nLenneberg opened her arms to this Catholic woman, even though she got pregnant before they\ngot married. And totally ignored all what she believed before, when her younger son married\nLina Schneider.",
        "Q: So how do you explain it?",
        "A: Ihave no explanation for this.",
        "Q: No explanation.",
        "A: Neither did my aunts, my Jewish aunts, who loved my mother. Maybe there was a\ncompetition.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: I -- [have no idea, I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Tell me about the personality of your parents as you -- as you remember them. Were you\nclose to both of them, were you more close --",
        "A: Yes, very close to both of them. My father was a very intelligent man, and he was a very calm\nperson, he was loved by everybody. My mother was much aggressive than my father. They had\ntwo different personalities. My mother always accused my father of being too decent, too good,\nwhether it was to employees, or it\u2019s to who -- whoever, and I think she was right. And she -- she\nalways felt that people were taking advantage of him. And my mother was much more\nageressive.",
        "Q: But he didn\u2019t agree with this, I gather?",
        "A: I don\u2019t really know, he loved her, she could do anything. My father was totally in love with\nmy mother, as long as I can remember, and nobody could say anything bad about my mother, so",
        "Q: And you were close to your mother as well?",
        "A: I was very close. I was -- actually, when I was younger, I was closer to my father than to my\nmother. That doesn\u2019t take anything away from the relationship to my mother --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but I was, you know, I was really close to my father. And some of it stemmed from the fact\nthat my father was quite athletic, and my mother was not, and Jupp Geschind, who was kind of a\njanitor at Karstadt, he taught me how to ride a bike. It was an adult bike, and my parents didn\u2019t\nknow about that, and I put my leg kind of through -- you know, how I managed it, I don\u2019t know.\nAnd then I eventually got a wonderful bike, and we went on bike trips, but always with my\nfather, and actually my cousin, my father\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter, who spent a lot of time in our\nhouse. My father tried to teach my mother how to bike, but it was always a disaster. And she\nscreamed once he was trying to kill her, so she always -- as long as she knew that he was holding\nonto the back of the bike it was fine. As soon as he let go, she would fall.",
        "Q: So you did many more things with your father?",
        "A: Many more things as far as hiking and bicycle riding with my father.",
        "Q: Did you eat lunch together, and dinner? What was -- what was the process in the house?",
        "A: Yes, we -- we did, because lunch at that time in Germany was the main meal, and when we\nlived in Aplerbeck, children used to go home to eat, and my parents lived above the department\nstore, they had a maid, and they would go up and have their -- their lunch, their dinner, at lunch\ntime.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I would join them, both of us, my brother and I would join them.",
        "Q: Were you glad when your brother arrived in 1930?",
        "A: I think so. I don\u2019t remember. I loved him dearly afterwards.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember how I felt, you know. I know that I was crazy about him when he was\na little bit bigger, and not quite a tiny baby, but was toddling around, and I was very protective of\nhim.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what was his name?",
        "A: Walter.",
        "Q: Walter.",
        "A: And I\u2019ve always vowed I would never name a child after a relative who was killed or died,\nbecause my brother was named after the oldest son of my grandmother, who was killed in World\nWar I.",
        "Q: So you -- you\u2019re a bit superstitious.",
        "A: I really am not, there is just something about --",
        "Q: About that?",
        "A: -- you know, I would not consider naming -- ya -- but Hans feels the same way, when I got\npregnant, that we would name either David or Bruce after his father, or -- or my father. Plus\nthere was something -- I didn\u2019t like German very much after I came out of the camps. Everything\nGerman was an antithesis to me. And so any -- I mean, names like Adolf, for goodness sakes, no\n-- which my grandfather was Adolf Lenneberg.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And Otto was my father\u2019s name.",
        "Q: So how -- how was the house religiously, since your mother converted --",
        "A: Mm-hm",
        "Q: -- because your father was agnostic and very assimilated --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- did you celebrate holidays?",
        "A: We did. At -- at times we celebrated both Christmas -- we always celebrated Hanukah, and\nmy father used to call the Christmas tree the Hanukah bush. And that was really more done for\nour Christian relatives, who always came. Seder we went to Jewish friends. And I couldn\u2019t go to\na Seder after I came out of the camps for years and years and years, because this was a couple,\nthey had no children, and we always had Seder with them, and my brother used to ask the\nquestions.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I just couldn\u2019t --",
        "Q: You couldn\u2019t do it.",
        "A: -- couldn\u2019t -- Seder -- Passover was a terrible time for me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: All the ho -- Jewish holidays were.",
        "Q: Because of the memories associated, okay.",
        "A: The memories, and I was much more -- I went through phases of being quite religious, and in\n1934, I went to a Jewish school in Dortmund because I could not attend public school in -- in\nAplerbeck any more. It was not a good school, and I wasn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t become a Zionist then, but\nthen eventually my parents decided to move to Dusseldorf, where my father was born. Also,\nAplerbeck was a small town, and very anti-Semitic. Many Nazis there. Boycotts in front of the\nstore, don\u2019t buy from the Jew, etcetera. And then my father did sell that store, but I can\u2019t\nremember exactly, I think it was about 1936, and Dusseldorf had a private Jewish school, a very\ngood school, and that was one of the reasons my father wanted to go to Dusseldorf, he was\nbrought up there, it was a much larger, more cosmopolitan city, and it had a good school system.\nAnd that\u2019s when I became an ardent Zionist, and very religious, to the chagrin of my parents.\nVery upset when my friends in Jewish school pretended to be fasting for Yom Kippur and were\nreally cheating. I -- and I -- I went through that stage. I ran around Jewish ho -- houses and\napartments, and collected for KKL for money for Israel to plant trees, etcetera. So you kind of\nget the picture.",
        "Q: What is KKL, can you explain?",
        "A: KKL? I don\u2019t remember what it stood for, but we call it KKL. There were blue boxes that had\na Magen da -- David -- David on it, and they would put coins in it, and that would be eventually\nsent what was then Palestine to make the desert bloom.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right. Now, explain something to me. You were born in Dortmund?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. And you lived there. Do yo -- you --",
        "A: No, I li -- I never lived in Dortmund. I lived in Aplerbeck, which was a suburban town, but\nDortmund had much better hospitals, so the --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- obstetrician my mother went to was going -- was in Dortmund, there were better physicians\nin Dortmund, and I w -- the delivery took place in a hospital in Dortmund. So my birth certificate\nsays Dortmund, but I never really lived in Dortmund.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I did go to school -- to Jewish school in Dortmund, because I couldn\u2019t go to public\nschool in -- to any public school any more.",
        "Q: After 33.",
        "A: After -- yeah, I think it was about 734.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. But your first school was in Aplerbeck --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: That was a grade school, and -- and talking about remembering, somehow I do remember I\nhad two very good friends. Now, I was about seven years old, and one was the daughter of the\nprincipal of a school, and one was a daughter of a local physician. And after the Nazis took over,\nand I don\u2019t recall exactly how soon, but within a relatively short time period -- we used to run to\neach other\u2019s houses and play, and I came to their house one day and they informed me, these two\ngirls, that they couldn\u2019t play with me any more because I was a Jew. Now that I remember,\nbecause it made such an impression on me, and I didn\u2019t make -- I -- I didn\u2019t understand it. And I\nthink I asked my parents, and I do not remember what their answer was, but somehow it was an\nexperience that I still remember, that all of a sudden I lost my friends. I couldn\u2019t play with these\ntwo girls. I still have pictures of these two girls with me, and I wouldn\u2019t have had those pictures,\nbut the non-Jewish relatives -- whatever I have, after I came back, was on account of my aunts,\nor I wouldn\u2019t have a thing.",
        "Q: Do you remember if these kids were angry, did they yell at you, or did they say it quietly --",
        "A: That I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: -- you don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I think they just said you can\u2019t come here any more, we -- yeah, they said you -- we can\u2019t play\nwith you any more because you are a Jew.",
        "Q: And the friends that you had were a mixture of friends, Jewish and Christian friend, I gather?",
        "A: In -- in do -- in Aplerbeck?",
        "Q: A -- yes.",
        "A: I think there were a k -- there were a couple of Jewish kids, I don\u2019t remember them too well,\nbut a lot of the families I remember either had children who were older, or -- or the Kahns, like,\nhad no children, and they treated me like their own child. So I really don\u2019t have any deep\nimpression of friendship with a Jewish child in Aplerbeck.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Now, that changed in Dusseldorf.",
        "Q: In Diisseldorf, yes.",
        "A: But even the children at the Jewish school in Dortmund, they were -- they didn\u2019t make very\ndeep impressions on me.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Were your parents good humored?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes, they were, they were. I think -- I think what helped me survive was the childhood I\nhad. I think if there is an ideal childhood, I had it. And my parents were very loving, and the\nmain thing is they were totally in love with each other, which I did not appreciate when I was a\nchild, but as time went on, and I remember their -- the way they acted with each other, and the\nway my father suffered when he was separated from my mother, and the same for my mother.",
        "Q: Then what do you think that gave you?",
        "A: First of all, my father was an extremely honest person. Morally caring, whether it was for his\nfamily, for the people who worked for him. And I think that made an impression on me, the way\nhe interacted with his not -- non-Jewish relatives, and his Jewish relatives. And his helpfulness.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: One doesn\u2019t appreciate it when one 1s eight, nine or 10 years old. And -- and the way he cared\nfor us in Terezin. There was only one theme, when this murderer is gone, and we get back with\nyour mommy, you know. And there was th -- he talked about my mother every day. So even\nthough we were separated, that was the f -- the foremost thing on his mind, was my mother.\nWhen we were in Terezin, and my -- my brother was Bar-mitzvah\u2019d in Terezin, and my father\nwas an agnostic. But there is something about agnostic Jews, and I don\u2019t know what it is. There\nis a Jewishness that -- that you -- you might be an agnostic, but there is something more than the\nreligion. And maybe it was also because we were in Terezin that the Bar-mitzvah of my brother\nmeant so much to us. It might -- might not have meant as much to us if we would have not had\nthe -- Hitler\u2019s ca -- catastrophe.",
        "Q: Was it unusual for a woman who was a mother -- excuse me -- to be working the way your\nmother was? Was that unusual?",
        "A: Yeah, my mother was unusual in every way.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, she was unusual in every way. Yes, when -- when my father accepted the job that\nwas offered to him by Karstadt to be in charge of this whole department store, and my mother\nwas made the chief buyer for women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing, there was no question that she\nwould continue doing that. My father just accepted that, or encouraged her. She had a maid, and\nher youngest sister came quite often to help out, and was the recipient of a lot of good deeds\nfrom my father. I think she was really in love with my father, too. So that\u2019s more or less the\natmosphere --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- I grew up in.",
        "Q: So you did have a maid, it was this --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- gre -- this was Grete?",
        "A: Grete, yeah.",
        "Q: Grete?",
        "A: Grete yeah, she -- she was -- she worked for us until it became impossible, when the first\nNuremberg laws came out that Jewish men were accused after that of having affairs with non-\nJewish women, and ended up incarcerated. We didn\u2019t talk about concentration camps in those\ndays, but that was a great fear many Jewish men had, that they were accused of having sexual\nrelations with non-Jewish women, and especially a maid who was a live-in maid. So -- and I\nknow Grete, when she left, she cried like a child. But it was just too dangerous to have her there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean she -- she did join us in -- a few buildings down when my -- my father and my mother\nunfortunately bought that store, and -- Steinweg, but they v -- they had to let her go, they just\ncouldn\u2019t keep her.",
        "Q: Did you miss her?",
        "A: Yes. I missed her. She was -- she was part of the family.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I mean, I grew up with her.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So would you have considered your family fairly wealthy, or well-to-do, how would you have\ndescribed it?",
        "A: I think they were well-to-do. They were not wealthy that they had enormous wealth inherited\nfrom their parents. I think they lived pretty high. They went on vacations, they had beautiful\nfurniture. Th -- I\u2019m sure they made enormous amounts of money, both of them together. They\nhad wonderful paintings, and especially at Karstadt, I mean, they had an enormous flat up there\nwith uncountable rooms, and Persian rugs, and it was very luxurious, which I didn\u2019t -- I mean, it\ndidn\u2019t strike me as luxurious, I was used to it, you know.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Whereas my grandmother in Dortmund, my mother\u2019s mother and father, lived in a very nice\nhouse, in an apartment, a house that had maybe three stories. And it was comfortable, and was\nnice, but it wasn\u2019t nowhere as luxurious as my parents. I -- my father had a study with bookcases\nfull of books, and it was -- you know, it was a different world, yeah.",
        "Q: Right, right. We have to change the tape now.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Ursula, I want to go back to the f -- your first year of school --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- or your second year of school, you -- you got some sort of tuberculosis of the lymph node?\nOf the lymph glands, yes?",
        "A: Yeah, which was actually almost like kindergarten, and I don\u2019t recall exactly when it was.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My grandmother, my non -- my Christian grandmother came from Hessen, which is an\nagricultural area not too far from Kassel. And it was thought at the time that during vacation,\nsummer vacation, that was the healthiest place to send your children. So this was actually before\nthe Nazis came into power, I was sent to Grabenstein, which is a small village where my\ngrandmother was born, on summer vacation. And they had wonderful milk, raw milk, came right\nfrom the cows. Unpasteurized milk, they didn\u2019t use pasteurization there. And what 1s interesting\nis that my mother also spent her vacation in Grabenstein as a young girl, and she had a -- a\ncondition in her groin where her lymph gland had to be lanced, and then she had a condition in\nher -- on her neck, too. But it was never connected that this came from tuberculous cows. It\u2019s\ncalled scrofula, and I had a neck out like this, and it -- it was here, where I have a scar and it was\nin the front of my neck that -- these lymph glands were all pus-y, and I went through this for\nmore than a year. And my -- my mother was treated by a country physician who just lanced this\nwith a knife, and she had a beautiful, straight scar. And my parents took me to Berlin to a\nspecialist, who extracted the pus with a syringe, and consequently I am left with all this\ncalcifications in there. But I lost a year of school, at least.",
        "Q: Do you remember being in bed a great deal?",
        "A: No, what I remember -- no, I wasn\u2019t in bed, what I remember is some horrible stuff, which I\nstill remember the name, believe it or not, antiflogestine, which was like a gook in a -- a little\ncan, that had to be heated very t -- very hot. It was -- and then it had to be applied to my glands.\nIt was like putting hot compresses on something. I hated that stuff. I mean, it burned, and it was -\n- and I screamed even before they could put it on my glands. So that\u2019s what I remember, but I\ndon\u2019t remember too much, and then one day it just seemed to -- to clear up, and it wa -- the\nglands were still draining a bit, and there was like a -- a band-aid on it, and then I went to school\nwith it.",
        "Q: But you were out of school for almost a year?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did that --",
        "A: And I was tutored. I was --",
        "Q: Oh, you were tutored at home?",
        "A: -- tutored at home.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t lose the -- the year of school, you were able to stay at your --",
        "A: No, I was tutored, I was tutored from -- in Jewish school, Frau Buchheim, who was the wife\nof the principal of the school, and she would tutor me at my grandparents home in Dortmund.\nSee, I had to commute to Dortmund to the Jewish school. We lived in Aplerbeck, but I couldn\u2019t\ngo to public school any more.",
        "Q: But in \u201936, you moved to Disseldorf.",
        "A: No -- in \u00b036 we moved to Dusseldorf.",
        "Q: Yes. Now, do you remember as a little kid in 1933, when the Nazis came in, did you see --",
        "A: Yes, I do. I do remember it, because they were -- had this -- the black uniforms, and also gr --\nbrown uniforms, the either SS or the SR. And I remember them standing in front of our -- our\ndoor to -- to the -- the door to the -- the entrance to the store, and threatening people. And I also\nremember the atmosphere. My parents were very upset, so was Grete, our maid, and who saids\nall kinds of dirty words about them. And I picked all that up. It didn\u2019t make sense to me, but\nsomething changed, something happened. And I remember my parents talking about that no --\ncustomers weren\u2019t coming into the store because they were being threatened. They stood right in\nfront of -- of the entrance to the store, and any person who wanted to enter the store was\nintimidated by them. And then they used to -- they defaced the store windows with Jude, Jew.\nDon\u2019t buy from the Jew. So I remember that.",
        "Q: You do?",
        "A: And I remember them smashing windows, that I remember. In fact, I think I was in the store\none day when these thugs smashed one of the big st -- windows, and it c -- it just came crashing\ndown. And they did that to all the Jewish stores.",
        "Q: And this was during the boycott of 19 thir -- not that you would have known at the time that\nthere was a boycott in 1933.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t -- you know, this -- all of a sudden -- there was a wonderful,\ntranquil life, which was changed somewhat because we moved from Karstadt to the Steinweg\nplace, but that didn\u2019t register to me why we did, or what, but then, this did register. And also\nthose two girls, I couldn\u2019t play with --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- the two girls any more. And they were at our house a lot. I mean, I have a lot of\nphotographs with them.",
        "Q: So, did life become lonely, or did you have a big enough family so that --",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I -- I really felt very deprived. My -- my mother\u2019s sisters were all so wonderful,\nand my grandmother. I mean, there\u2019s nobody like my mother\u2019s mother. And I just felt very\nsheltered with them. And then when I had to go to school in Dortmund, and I spent an awful lot\nof time with my mother\u2019s parents, because Frau Buchheim would come to my grandmother\u2019s\nhouse, and would tutor me at my grandmother\u2019s house, because it was in the same town. And I\nwould eat with them, and I would -- she would take me to the markets, and I -- Ij -- I just don\u2019t\nremember feeling deprived at all.",
        "Q: And when you moved to Disseldorf, what di --",
        "A: That changed my life completely.",
        "Q: How so?",
        "A: Because I went to a school, a Jewish school, and somehow I made an awful lot of friends. I\nhad never been in a -- in a school that I felt so good about. I -- I made a lot of -- a lot of friends,\nand I went to their houses, they went to mine, and I was good in athletics, and they had a big\nathletic program, and I was good in jumping and si -- all kinds of things. And they had arts\nprograms, they did a lot of things. And even though the Nazis were persecuting the Jews, but\nsomehow there was still that feeling, well this guy isn\u2019t going to stay in power, and at -- and I felt\nsheltered. I was among people who were teaching me, and who were very -- were very\nwonderful. And we had one professor who later on I met in Los Angeles, Dr. Bergel, and he was\na professor of history, and they really had attracted terrific people in that school. And he had\ntraveled extensively in Africa, in Asia, and he told us all these wonderful stories, I remember\nthat. Yeah, that was a -- it was a good time until 1938, when our school was destroyed\ncompletely.",
        "Q: Oh, it was destroyed?",
        "A: Kristallnacht. Completely burned to the ground, our school, our synagogue, everything, yeah.",
        "Q: But when you moved to Dusseldorf, your father, he has a business in Dusseldorf, or he works",
        "A: No, see, my father used the money which he received from the people who bought that\nSteinwegs -- that second -- that store he bought. They were very decent family, a Catholic\nfamily, and they really paid him the market price.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: They did. And I would never -- my mother would never do anything to get any more money\nout of them, because she felt they were decent, which was very hard to find. Most of the\nGermans who bought Jewish stores were cheated, but my parents were not. And then he --\nmaybe he -- I would have been better off if -- they would have been better off if they had been\ncheated, because he took the -- the money from that store, when he came to Dusseldorf, he\nstarted a wholesale store not too far from the railroad station. Not in the best area of town, but\nthat\u2019s where the wholestale businesses were. And that flourished, everything he touched\nflourished.",
        "Q: Even in spite of the fact that the Nazis are in power for three years --",
        "A: Oh yes, he -- he had a -- and a lot of these people were not really Nazis. And some of them\nturned Nazis, but they were -- you know, he had a -- also, he has a -- had a good rapport. Lot of\nthem were people who sold door to door, and some of them were Gypsies, who bought from him.\nAnd I wish he hadn\u2019t bought that store, but that\u2019s what he did. In the meantime they tried to\nemigrate. You know, they tried to leave Germany, but they had to make a living. I don\u2019t think\nmy parents had, you know, tremendous money reserves. They had lived pretty high, and all this\nmoving, and losing his job, and losing his -- his health insurance and stuff, and having to buy all\nthis on his own --",
        "Q: Cost [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- \u2019'm sure that there was a cost.",
        "Q: Right. But your mother went -- after you moved to Dusseldorf, she goes to Berlin and gets a\njob?",
        "A: She tries to. She goes to Berlin to visit her old colleagues, who used to be -- who were buyers\nfor other department stores. And some of them had been working for manufacturers. But by that\ntime, everything was, in quote, Aryanized, and they weren\u2019t working for Jewish concerns any\nmore. And they treated her horribly. They didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with her. Whether\nthey were just horrible people, or whether they -- it was self-protection, because having\nconnections with Jews -- and my mother generally wasn\u2019t even known that she came from a --\nfrom a -- a non-Jewish family. Fr -- my mother was a Jew.",
        "Q: To everybody.",
        "A: To her colleagues.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: To everybody. And so, my mother coming back and trying to get -- make some connections\nto earn a living, di -- it was a failure. And she was very disheartened. And then she -- and I don\u2019t\nknow how she got to the Schreyecks, that I don\u2019t know. She might have told me, I don\u2019t\nremember that. She became a forelady in a leather belt factory which was owned by the\nSchreyeck family. And they were the most decent, wonderful people on this earth. And they\nprotected her, and I -- they s -- I-I don\u2019t want to jump ahead, I think Ill let you ask the questions,\nbut they were very vital later on in -- in protecting my mother when we were deported, and the\nsecret police, Herr Puetz, would not let my mother to go with us. So, they\u2019re wonder --",
        "Q: And you think that had something to do with these people? The fact that she was not allowed\nto go?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think -- what had to do with him not wanting my mother to go with us was\nstrictly he hated her because he -- she got notification a few times, that I remember, to present\nherself at the office of Herr Puetz, he was the head of the Gestapo. And he belabored her to leave\nmy father. And she made it very clear she would never leave my father, she rather die. And he\nthen would not allow her to go with us -- we -- to the, in quote, labor camp. And she worked for\nthe Schreyecks. So as soon as we were gone, this guy Puetz came, I think on a weekly basis, to\ninterview her, and to interview the Schreyecks, and to make it very, very difficult, to make her\nfeel very threatened, to the point where Mr. Schreyeck one day said to my mother, \u201cCaroline,\nthis guy is after you. He will get to you whether it\u2019s next week or the week after. You have to\nleave. I have a brother, as you know, in Vienna, and he has a leather factory. I\u2019m going to get in\ntouch with my brother and I think he will agree to shield you, and you work for my brother.\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t easy, because when you lee -- left a town, and I think it\u2019s probably still so in\nGermany, you had to go to the police, you had to fill out papers that you were leaving such and\nsuch a residence, and you were going to such and such a town, where you were going to live in\nsuch and such a place. Then when you got, let\u2019s say, to Vienna, you were supposed to go to the\nViennese police and start papers that you were a new resident. Now, what they took upon\nthemselves -- this is why I said to you before, these people did things that I am not sure I would\nhave the guts to do for anybody. They provided food for my mother, so she wouldn\u2019t have --\nbecause she was not registered, she wouldn\u2019t get food stamps. They provided a place for her to\nlive with a family where she had a room. And she was not registered with the police, and the\nGermans had no idea where she went. And Puetz came, she found out later, to Schreyeck in\nDusseldorf, and said where -- they want to talk to her. And Mr. Schreyeck said, \u201cI have no idea\nwhere she went. I hope she isn\u2019t going to take her life, because she was talking about killing\nherself,\u201d and stuff like that. And she stayed with the Schreyecks in Vienna for quite a long time,\nand -- you know, there\u2019s so many bad things happened to my mother, but this is almost unreal. I\nthink she had the flu, or something, but sh -- anyway, my mother wasn\u2019t one to stay home if she\njust had a little cold, but she was sick. And she stayed home, and that day when she stayed home,\nthe Gestapo came to the Schreyeck factory in Vienna and asked for Karolina Lenneberg. So, Mr.\nSchreyeck number two, the one in Vienna send somebody he trusted, I don\u2019t know who it was, to\nher -- to her room, and told her to immediately leave, take the next train to Kleve, which is close\nto the Dutch border, where a third Schreyeck brother had a tannery. So -- and then --",
        "Q: This is like the underground railroad.",
        "A: Exactly. And then the -- and the -- he -- she worked for the Schreyecks I -- only for several\nmonths I think. And the bombing attacks were getting horrendously bad in Kleve. I mean, this is\nhistorical, what was -- th -- it was almost flattened, because there was also -- lot of industry in\nKleve, and also it was a very short trip for the British fliers, cause it was close to the Dutch\nborder. And one day the house next to the Schreyeck\u2019s was bombed. It was one of those bombs\nthat went into the basement and then exploded. And Mr. Schreyeck said to my mother,\n\u201cCaroline, you have a sister in Lippborg. Why -- I think you should leave. I don\u2019t think any of us\nare going to survive.\u201d And my mother left, and the day my mother left, all the Schreyecks were\nkilled in their cellar. One of the bombs went into their basement.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And this is why -- you know, you talk about justice, and -- and belief in God, and all this,\nwhich my mother had lost completely -- the Schreyecks in Dusseldorf had a wonderful son, and\nthey were such anti-Nazis. Their son was killed. He was drafted, and he was killed. And, you\nknow, these -- the good people --",
        "Q: Often get hurt, yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s quite a story of your mother\u2019s, now let\u2019s get back t-to you. So until -- until\nKristallnacht --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- you seemed to feel pretty good. You\u2019re not feeling -- although you must an -- you must\nknow that your parents are in some ways nervous about what\u2019s happening --",
        "A: Oh, I was --",
        "Q: -- and they tried to leave. You\u2019re very conscious of this.",
        "A: -- I was very conscious of it and also, my parents prepared both my brother and me to -- for\nimmigration. Our suitcases were practically packed. We got English lessons, I got fr -- English\nand Spanish lessons from an uncle of mine who also perished, who was a philologist, he s -- he\nspoke many languages. And my brother also got additional e -- when e -- we had English in s --\nin school, but he got additional lessons. My parents had what was called an affidavit, which is a\npledge from an American citizen to bring over a person from another country, and that they\nwould take care of that person if that person would not be able to be financially self-sufficient.\nThe idea is that this person will not become a -- will not use the social services of the United\nStates. So we had this affidavit of a very distant relative in Chicago, Beifuss. And my parents\nhad a number. To -- to get an interview with the American consul in Dusseldorf you had to have\na number. And the waiting time before you could see a consul was between a year and a year and\na half. So they had obtained that affidavit a long time before they saw the consul. They saw the\nconsul in 1938. I don\u2019t recall when it was, whether it was the beginning or the middle of \u201938.\nAnd the consul, who was known not to be too favorably inclined towards the Jews, like s -- it\nturned out later some people in the state department were, he decided that the affidavit that\nMorris Beifuss gave my mother and my father was okay, but they -- he considered it insufficient\nbecause Mr. Beifuss had given X number of affidavits to other people. And they wanted an\nadditional affidavit from somebody other than Mr. de -- Mr. Beifuss. Now, Mr. Beifuss was an\nextremely wealthy man, who lived on one of the main, glorious streets near the lake, and that\nbroke our neck. So my father wrote to a very distant relative nobody liked, who lived in Texas,\nand who had come to Germany on occasion. And he was an alcoholic, and he hated everybody\nwho didn\u2019t drink with him. And my father was sure he was -- gotten into bad situation with this\nman because he would not drink with him. Well, he declined to give us an affidavit. And -- so\nyou get the picture. My parents then tried to go to Uruguay. And it wasn\u2019t just my parents, it was\na cousin of theirs and another couple. And they fell into the hands of a smuggler, a very good\nlooking young man who -- who was such a con artist, he persuaded everybody. Plus, they didn\u2019t\nhave too many options. They gave him a lot of money, and then he disappeared. So that -- that\nwas -- what they should have done, I think, they should have just taken what they had on their\nbacks and just tried to go either through France -- or France was already occupied, maybe, when\nwas France -- I -- no, they could have gone through France, maybe to -- to Spain, etcetera. Some\npeople managed to do that, but they didn\u2019t do that, all right? So they still hoped for writing and\ngetting on the additional affidavit and nothing panned out, and then it was \u00b038, and then was\nKristallnacht, and -- and after that it only went downhill.",
        "Q: Did you know people who had I-left in that way? Just taken what was on their backs and\ncrossed -- tried to cross the border?",
        "A: After the war.",
        "Q: After the war, you had, but you --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anybody who did it during the war, I mean not among our friends. But after the\nwar, actually there was a -- a cousin of my husband, she was married to a Polish Jew, who was a\nwatchmaker, and he couldn\u2019t make a go of anything, it was a wonderful guy. And they came to\nthis country like that. And then he, first time in his life he had a wonderful job with Longine, and\nthen he died of a bleeding ulcer. So you know, life is -- yeah, sometimes you can\u2019t win.",
        "Q: Did -- do you remember having conversations with your parents, were your parents telling\nyou we\u2019re trying to go to --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- United States, to Uruguay?",
        "A: Oh yes, I -- by that time I was old enough --",
        "Q: Yes, you --",
        "A: -- not only old enough, my mother was working, my father was working by that time in\nTiefbau, which means very hard labor, for which he probably didn\u2019t get paid, you know, digging\nditches, and construction, which was compulsory work because he had to give up his store in\nDiisseldorf, his wholesale store, because then an edict came out that Jews couldn\u2019t have --\ncouldn\u2019t own businesses any more. And then he was drafted to -- to work in -- in Tiefbau, which\nwas digging basements and etcetera, and I don\u2019t know exactly for what. And I don\u2019t think he --\nhe got paid at all for that.",
        "Q: So do you feel your circumstances getting worse and worse --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- physically, because of the experiences?",
        "A: Oh yes, and -- and I was -- and then my -- our school was burned, and -- and there was -- we\nhad very limited education. And there was only one teacher and his wife left, and there was a\nlaundry, the Elsberg laundry in -- outside of Dusseldorf, and these people allowed us to have\nschool there. There were only, you know, relatively few people. There was not an accredited\nschool any more, because some people sent their children to Duisberg, which was -- still had an\naccredited Jewish school, and my brother went to Duisberg on the train, and got special\npermission to take the train because Jews weren\u2019t allowed to go in the train any more. And so\nthis 1s -- you know, I wi -- I -- then I had no more education, and I kept house for my parents,\nwho were working very hard from morning to night.",
        "Q: Cause there\u2019s no maid any more, there\u2019s no [indecipherable]",
        "A: There\u2019s nothing, you know, there was no maid after -- after we went to Dusseldorf. Things\nwent downhill very, very fast, yeah.",
        "Q: Are you frightened at this point? Do you th -- do you have any recollection whether you\u2019re\nfrightened, or --",
        "A: I was never frightened. I always had that feeling that my parents go -- they were trying\neverything. They were going to get us out of this. And I was also very busy, I was learning\nEnglish, I was learning Spanish, I was keeping house, I was taking care of my brother, who was\nfour years younger than I was. And there was still that hope that this criminal is going to --",
        "Q: To stop.",
        "A: -- to stop, 1s going to be killed or something. And I remember in the last apartment we had,\nwe -- my father -- this -- there were all non-Jews in that apartment, it was a most primitive\napartment, but on the top floor was a couple, and he was a communist. And he was very anti-\nNazi. And when we went into the basements when there was an alarm, an air -- air strike alarm,\nmy father and this man would be listening to the foreign senders. And it didn\u2019t look good at that\ntime. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, we have to stop and tape -- change the tape.",
        "A: Yeah, I thought so.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Ursula, by 1938, have you, as a young person, been hearing about concentration camps?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: Nothing, nothing.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t hear about people being taken away?",
        "A: Yes, people were taking aw -- being taken away, but nobody ever mentioned concentration\ncamps. You know, the -- the Gestapo did incarcerate people, but somehow it did not sink through\nwhere these people were going. It was taken for granted they were going to some prisons, people\nwere imprisoned. And not only Jews, but political prisoners. I remember distinctly I was in my\ngrandmother Schenider\u2019s house, who would go to church every Sunday morning, to a big\nChristian church, Evangelische Kirche in Dortmund. And my grandfather was suffering from\ncancer. And they were very fond of a minister who would visit my grandfather. And one day I\nwas there on a Sunday, my grandmother comes home, her red -- her eyes are red, she is beyond\nherself because the -- the minister was taken off by black shirts when he was giving a sermon.\nAnd what he was telling his congregation is that they should be more tolerant, and what\u2019s going\non with the Jews was incomprehensible to him. And two black shirts came up, took him off the\npodium -- I mean, off the whatever you call it in a -- in a Protestant church, and he was never\nheard from again. And my -- my aunts told me that they heard that he was killed in a\nconcentration camp. So that has made a tremendous impression on me at that time, I remember\nthat. And that was, you know, many, many years before people were routinely put into custody.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But did they say the word concentration camp?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- they just said --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t part of our vocabulary.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: Were you worried about Walter traveling by himself on the train to go to the school?",

        "Q: And he came back and forth every day?",
        "A: Right, yeah, he came back and forth every day.",
        "Q: And what was it like for --",
        "A: But he -- but -- but don\u2019t forget, we didn\u2019t wear this Jewish star yet at that time.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So, you know, it\u2019s not too clear that anybody would have known that he was a Jewish child.",

        "Q: And didn\u2019t that say Jewish, or not?",
        "A: And that said Jewish, I mean, if somebody would stop you, but how many people would have\nstopped a young boy and asked for the I.D. card? But that stop in -- that school in Duisberg\nclosed, probably not too long, maybe six months or something after Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly, I don\u2019t remember that too well.",
        "Q: Do you remember Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, I remember it very well. I remember it because somebody, and I don\u2019t\nremember who it was, I think it probably was this neighbor of my parents, came down and told\nmy mother to hide my father. And he was in a closet, and they never came into our house, as it\nturned out. And they -- a lot of men were being taken away, my -- my stepfather was taken away\nin Dusseldorf, my father was not. I\u2019m not sure that he hid in our house, or somebody else\u2019s\nhouse, that I don\u2019t remember. All I remember distinctly is there was a raid before Kristallnacht, I\nthink just a short time before Kristallnacht, where they went through Jewish homes and looked\nfor, in quote, forbidden books. Now, forbidden books weren\u2019t necessarily books by Jewish\nauthors. Anyone who was who in literature was a forbidden book, whether it was Bernard Shaw,\nor what. And I will never forget this, my father was -- downstairs in the basement there was a\nwash cellar, and a big stove where people would boil their wash in those days. And my father\nwas burning books, and he was practically crying. And h -- he said to me, \u201cI am getting rid of my\nold friends.\u201d And these were his books, because they were going through Jewish homes, and if\nyou had a book that was on the forbidden list, forget it, they would arrest you. Now that I\nremember.",
        "Q: So you watched him do that?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was this very sad for you too, or was it sad because you saw how unhappy he was?",
        "A: He was very unhappy, and whenever he was unhappy it was very, very sad for me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, it -- it -- I mean, you sense when your parents are upset. I also sensed that my\nparents were trying so hard to get us out of Germany. And I remember maps on the floor, and\nstudying South America, and ur -- Uruguay, and places like that, that they were hope there --\nhope they were going to go, with their cousins. So --",
        "Q: Okay, we have to stop the tap -- is -- okay. [interruption] Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I was confused.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What did you see on Kristallnacht? Did you see anything that night, or did you go out the next\nday and see the destruction?",
        "A: Went out the next day and saw the destruction. My parents wouldn\u2019t let us go out of -- get out\nof our apartment. I mean, my mother, I think. I don\u2019t know, I think my father was -- somebody,\nprobably that couple upstairs, the communists probably had him in their apartment.",
        "Q: Now let me ask you something. Your fr -- people are wanting to protect your father because\nhe\u2019s known as Jewish.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But your mother\u2019s also known as Jewish --",
        "A: Yeah, but they knew -- these people knew -- the Gestapo knew she was not from th -- racially\nJewish.",
        "Q: I see, so that she could be protected.",
        "A: And -- and -- yeah, and these people upstairs -- he was only a worker, but he was a very\nintelligent man, he was a communist and he -- he knew what was going on. He was constantly\nlistening to what they call the Fremdhorer, which was the foreign sender, which was England,\nyou know. So they were very well informed. I went out the next day, and there was nothing left\nof my school, it was all burned down. And my parents told me that the Dusseldorf fire\ndepartment was there in full force, and they were putting hoses on the adjacent buildings, to\nmake sure that the adjacent buildings weren\u2019t burning down, and they let the Jewish buildings\nburn to the ground. And these were enormous buildings, I mean, stone buildings, it was\nbeautiful.",
        "Q: Did you now get frightened?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. I re -- when I think of it, 1t\u2019s just incr -- incredible.",
        "Q: It\u2019s incredible, no?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s incre -- I just can\u2019t believe that this ever happened sometimes.",
        "Q: Were you known as a Mischling or not? You were --",
        "A: Not among -- not in school, and not -- no. I was a Mischling -- there were two kinds of\nMischlingen. There were prefer -- preferential Mischlingen, those who were born to a Jewish\nparent, one Jewish parent, but raised either as a Protestant or a Catholic. They were the privil --\npreferred -- preferential. And then there were the Judischer Mischlingen, that\u2019s was me. I mean,\nwas far as the racial politics go, I was still a Mischling. But I was a Jew, and I was registered\nwith my brother in the Jewish community, and I was given the ri -- Jewish religion at birth, and\nSo was my brother, so there was no question, and the Gestapo had all the papers.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the Previligierter Mischlingen, they had a much easier life than the Jewish Mischlingen.\nThey were able to go to -- to public school. I we -- we weren\u2019t. And they were not really terribly\npersecuted until -- and I don\u2019t know this distinctly, but somewhere at the very beginning of *45,\nwhen they rounded up Christian Mischlingen, you know, the pref -- prefer -- pre -- preferential\nMischlingen, and sent them to Terezin. Now what I only learned not terribly long ago, which I\ndidn\u2019t know, because we were deported from Terezin at the end of \u201944 -- I mean, October of \u201944,\nis that they were building gas chambers and ovens in Terezin, that I didn\u2019t know. And that\nsupposedly, I mean this is what -- and I really want to research this, that the ovens were already\nfinished, the only thing that was missing were the doors. Now, whether they were going to shoot\npeople, or put them -- o-or how they were going to kill them, but they had ovens. So, all these\npeople, who felt relatively secure until \u201945, wouldn\u2019t have been very secure.",
        "Q: When does Walter have to stop going to Duisberg t -- for school? Do you think it\u2019s after\nKristallnacht?",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s the --",
        "A: I think it was after Kristallnacht, but I don\u2019t remember how -- how long afterwards.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I have a pretty darn good memory, and as far as my experiences go -- you know, I have a\ndiary f -- which I should have brought, and I forgot that, from 1945. So I should have, you know",
        "Q: You wrote the diary in 1945?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: Yeah. I wrote it on the road back, on paper. And then I got to Lippborg and my aunt gave me\nthe diary, and Buschi helped me be -- re -- I put it in my diary. Yeah, but that I didn\u2019t think\nabout, yeah.",
        "Q: So, at some point after Kristallnacht, Walter is home with you?",
        "A: Right, and he has no schooling whatsoever --",
        "Q: So do you --",
        "A: -- except Uncle Karl, he got private lessons, and the Schnooks, and I don\u2019t know if they\nperished, I probably should look it up. They probably perished. They were the last teachers, and\nthey also gave private lessons to my brother, and to me.",
        "Q: And were they paid?",
        "A: My parents paid them, yes.",
        "Q: So your parents were st --",
        "A: I mean, they didn\u2019t pay my -- my -- my uncle, but they --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- they paid -- yeah.",
        "Q: So they\u2019re working enough where there\u2019s -- somehow there\u2019s enough to pay people, a\nminimal amount, I suppose.",
        "A: Yeah, and also they had -- you know, they were constantly selling things. They still had a few\npaintings that they were selling, and my mother got rid of all her jewelry, she was selling things,\nyou know, little by little. So that helped to a degree.",
        "Q: Right. Did you notice depression in your parents, or did they --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t try to show it ever.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: When we were with them, and that lasted, believe it or not, all the way to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: My father tried to -- to put -- to hide from us as much as he could. I didn\u2019t realize it, I only\nrealized it later, because my father was transported out of Terezin about a year before we were\nall transported to Auschwitz. And he was working on the bunker that Hitler was -- they were\nbuilding for Hitler in Berlin. And when he came back, he seemed to me like a different person.\nHe wouldn\u2019t talk about anything that happened to him working on this construction of the bunker\nin Berlin, but he -- he did tell me he was working with other people from concentration camps.\nAnd I think even though in Terezin most of us -- nobody knew that there was an Auschwitz, or\nthere were extermination camps. I really -- later on am convinced that he got a full dose of what\nwas going on from some of the people who are working with him in Berlin, and he never -- he\nnever talked about his experience in Berlin, never.",
        "Q: But you saw a change.",
        "A: I saw a change in him.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So essentially the -- the good spirits, however you wish to describe it was a question of\nignorance of -- in some way, or ignoring evidence --",
        "A: No, he was -- he was trying to -- to be so supportive and to give us so much hope. He wanted\nus to live, and he wanted to see my mother again. And he did this even after he came back from\nBerlin, but somehow -- he was always a very open person, but whenever I asked about what\nhappened, what was he doing in Berlin, he was like a closed book, he would -- just would not\nopen up. But no, he never -- I mean he -- he was encouraging us all the way.",
        "Q: So that must have been important for you.",
        "A: It was very important for us, very important. And that he also was able to give us a lot of\nfood. You know, he -- he -- he was a man who had held an enormous position at Karstadt\u2019s. He\nwas a terrific mathematician. But he could do anything. He could work in construction. And in\nTerezin what he did when they asked him what his profession was, he didn\u2019t say merchant or --\nor whatever, he said he was a carpenter. And he ended up with a carpentry job in Terezin in the\nbauhof, which gave him the chance to steal as much wood as he could, to give it to the cooks,\nand to get extra food for us. So you -- do you get a picture?",
        "Q: Yes, of what kind of a person --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember the start of the war in 1939?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Is that big news, and --",
        "A: Well, it was big news. I think my parents expected it because Hitler was going into adjacent --\nyou know, he was taking over at first Austria and etcetera. But we -- our last apartment was right\nby the railroad tracks, which used to be an -- was a house -- an apartment house owned by a\nJewish family, and this was the last place we were allowed to live in, and it was not in the best\narea. Excuse me. And we could see the railroad tracks from our apartment, and we saw the\nfreight trains passing for hours and hours and hours, loaded with equipment. Guns, and you\nknow, war equipment. And my father and my mother were talking about it, and it was clear to us\nthat Hitler was preparing for something, and that he was going to take over another country. So\nmy parents, yes, I mean, they tried to keep it from us, but I was too old by that time, and I\nrealized that war seemed imminent. War seemed imminent and still there was hope, but war and\nextermination of the Jews just -- that\u2019s something that they never put two and two together.",
        "Q: So even all of these restrictions on the Jews, and the taking away of apartments --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and good jobs, etcetera --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- did not mean to you that something dire was going to happen.",
        "A: No, this guy eventually was going to -- I -- I thought we were going to be restricted in our\napartment, which from where we came from was, you know, pretty going downhill. My parents\nhad to work very hard. I was prepared that maybe they would put me into a -- into labor for some\nwar effort or something. But it never occurred to me -- I mean, da -- can a healthy human mind\npicture what eventually happened? You know --",
        "Q: No, no and you --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- at -- in 1939 you\u2019re only 13, you may be --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: -- more adult than you were --",
        "A: I was much more concerned reading books by Karl May, which was an author who was very\npopular, who had never been to America, and who wrote all these stories about the fights\nbetween Indians and cowboys. And I was reading these books, I mean, I didn\u2019t read the books\nthat little girls should read, I wrote these books, I -- it was -- I was insatiable. No -- and, you\nknow, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure whether -- what my parents, if they really thought that things were\ngoing to -- to get so bad that our life were threatened, they certainly didn\u2019t show it.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t say. Now, do you start dating at this age?",
        "A: Yes. I\u2019m trying to think. There were only a relatively small number of people my age left in\nDisseldorf. A lot of people had been able to get out of the country, and a lot of my friends had\nleft, some of them legally and some illegally. But there were a bunch of people, some of them I\nwasn\u2019t clo -- close with, but at least a half a dozen or so that I became very close to. They were\nolder than I was by a few years. They were deported in 1941. I\u2019m trying to think -- so I think I\nprobably met Kurt in 1939, or 40.",
        "Q: This is Kurt Eckstein?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And he was learning to be an auto mechanic, because he felt, and his father felt -- his mother\nhad died, that that would give him a better opportunity to emigrate into another country. And we\n-- we had -- we danced, we had a Victrola, and 1 -- I didn\u2019t know how to dance, they taught me\nhow to dance. There were a couple of people, they were half Jewish. Their father had been\nChristian and he had died, so they were left with their Jewish mother, and a gra -- and a Jewish\ngrandmother. And they were the most good looking guys you had ever seen. Tall and blonde,\nand just terrific guys. And then there was a girl, and she was part of the group, and I didn\u2019t care\nfor her that much, I felt she was a loose girl. She let them touch her up and down and this is\nsomething that I just, you know, thought was really not right. And we had a very good time. And\nthen in \u201941, when the first transports were leaving Dusseldorf, they all went into that transport.",
        "Q: The two boys and the girl?",
        "A: And the girl.",
        "Q: But not you.",
        "A: No, and Kurt.",
        "Q: And Kurt.",
        "A: And Kurt.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I gave a pledge to them that I would visit their grandmother. Their mother was deported\ntoo, but their grandmother wasn\u2019t. So their grandmother was the only one left, and she was very\nold lady, she was kind of bent, and -- and inconsolable that -- and I went there a lot, and I don\u2019t\nknow what -- where she ended up, I can\u2019t remember. She probably was deported to Terezin, and\nthen, you know, Terezin was a transit camp.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And they went to Minsk, that I know, that they went to Minsk. And in Minsk we now -- I just\nread an article about it not too long ago, they were all shot. So that was Kurt Eckstein.",
        "Q: But Kurt was 18 [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, he was -- he --",
        "Q: -- and you were 13.",
        "A: No, I was a bit older than that, I was born in \u201926, and Kurt -- how old was I in --",
        "Q: Well, \u00b039 you\u2019re 13. So when do you meet him? Somewhere \u00b039 - 40, right?",
        "A: Yeah, I think --",
        "Q: So you\u2019re 13 - 14?",
        "A: -- \u00b040 -- probably \u00b040, yeah.",
        "Q: \u00b040, okay, so you\u2019re 14.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Still not a grown woman.",
        "A: But I was very mature for my age --",
        "Q: Yeah, I was going to ask --",
        "A: -- and I tell you where I met him. I met him at my Uncle Karl\u2019s house, who was my Spanish\nand English teacher, because Kurt was taking lessons from Uncle Karl, too. And Uncle Karl was\nvouching for Kurt, and rightly so, and he -- I remember, I mean my parents must -- now in\nretrospect that you ask me that, they must have had some questions about it. I remember Uncle\nKarl told my parents that he was the most wonderful kid, and he trusted him implicitly. And he\nhad good reason to, yes.",
        "Q: So your parents were worried that he might try to take advantage of you in some way?",
        "A: Yeah, because my parents knew from me, what was going on with Ruth and the other -- you\nknow, the other two guys.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But Ruth was older, and -- and I\u2019m sure they -- they were sexually active. Well, I\u2019m glad they\nwere, you know, because they --",
        "Q: Considering what happened, yeah.",
        "A: -- had -- they had, you know, they had a very short life left.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they seemed to -- you know, it\u2019s very easy to stereotype somebody, she was a loose girl\nand all this kind of stuff. She was --",
        "Q: Well, especially when you\u2019re that age, it\u2019s very easy, right?",
        "A: Right. And she was a very beautiful girl --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- Iremember, I was very jealous, she was very sexy looking.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you get your period?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I\u2019m sure, yeah, I think I got it probably by the time I was 13, yeah. Yeah, I\nremember, yeah I did, yeah. But I was very, you know, I was very innocent. I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t --\nyou know, my mo -- my parents told me -- I knew where babies came from and all this, but I\ndon\u2019t think I thought about it very much. It never -- there were certain things you did and you\ndidn\u2019t do.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And -- and I think th -- I think my parents were pretty open, but not like they are today, you\nknow, I\u2019m --",
        "Q: Was it important for you to menstruate? Was th -- was that a big deal [indecipherable]",
        "A: I think I was frightened to death. I thought I was getting -- you know, I think I menstruated\npretty early, but I don\u2019t remember exactly, but I -- I know I went to my mother and there was\nsomething terribly wrong with me. So then I got a talk what this was all about, you know.",
        "Q: Because you hadn\u2019t know this before.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right. Well.",
        "Q: Now, were you Bat-mitzvah\u2019d?",
        "A: No, that was not --",
        "Q: That was never done.",
        "A: -- that was never heard of in -- in Europe. That is a -- that\u2019s an American invention.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It is.",
        "Q: Right, right. So do things get even worse, \u201939 and \u201940, as the war --",
        "A: They -- they\u2019re getting worse because we -- we can\u2019t sit on benches any more because it says\nJews can\u2019t sit here. We can\u2019t swim in the Rhine river any more because it says Jews can\u2019t swim\nhere any more. And -- and we can\u2019t go to the movies. I remember when I was in school, and we\nused to walk -- from school we used to walk home, and we passed by a movie house, and there\nwas a picture of a mouse playing the piano. We called it the American mouse, and we wanted so\nbadly to see that picture, that Mickey Mouse picture, but there -- you couldn\u2019t get in. There was a\nsign, Jews cannot enter. And Konigs Allee in Dusseldorf was like Fifth Avenue. And pretty soon\nthere were signs all over, Jews can\u2019t in -- enter, Jews can\u2019t be serviced he -- served here any\nmore, etcetera. Those were the stores that used to have, we speak English, parler Francais and all\nthis as a -- for an international city. But on top of that we speak English and -- and parler\nFrancais, no was, Jews can\u2019t enter.",
        "Q: So these kinds of signs proliferate --",
        "A: All over.",
        "Q: -- all over th -- the -- 1s it after the wa -- after 1939, between \u00b039 and \u201941, it -- it gets\nconsiderably worse --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- or it\u2019s progressive from \u00b033, do you think?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Not from \u00b033, but it was -- it was gradual even from \u201933, you couldn\u2019t go to school, to a -- you\ncouldn\u2019t -- you -- do many things, but the -- these drastic steps were coming in very short\nintervals, starting really, I would say, from 38 on.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Right.",
        "A: And then progressively worse and worse.",
        "Q: And in \u201941 you have to wear the star?",
        "A: Yeah, and then we had to also have a new middle initial. Sarah and Israel.",
        "Q: Israel for boys, and --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- or men.",
        "A: And then our stamps, our food stamps had Jude, Jew, stamped all through the food stamps,\nand if I went to a butcher shop with my food stamps -- I did all the shopping for the family\nbecause my mother worked. And if the butcher didn\u2019t want to wait on us, he had a perfect right\nto do so, because we had Jewish food stamps. Or he -- they could turn us back not to come into\ntheir establishment when we -- when we had to wear the Jewish star. And then they -- the Nazi\nyouth would beat us up.",
        "Q: Were you beaten?",
        "A: Oh yes. I was scared to go out. And then they took my bicycle away, which was my form of\ntransportation. You know, it was all gradually. Then they took all the jewelry away. And the only\nreason why I have things 1s because of my aunts. Because, don\u2019t forget, I wouldn\u2019t have a si -- I\nwouldn\u2019t have the -- a -- anything, I wouldn\u2019t even have some of the documents I\u2019m going to\ngive to you if it weren\u2019t for my aunts, because my mother couldn\u2019t keep them either.",

        "A: Exactly.",

        "A: I think -- 1t depends on the person, I think I\u2019m -- it\u2019s very difficult to analyze yourself.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I think when there is tremendous pressure, I get -- become very strong. And I think that\nwas actually true when I was a young teenager, and I think that I would never be -- have the\ntendency to kind of self-indulge and feel sorry for myself. It was always the idea of keep on\ngoing and survive. And I think that -- I\u2019m -- don\u2019t know where it came from, it comes from my\nparents too, and I think it helped me a lot. It helped me in Auschwitz. I mean, if you ask me the\nsame question about Auschwitz, I can only tell you that I wrapped myself into a cocoon and I\nwas living inwards. And somehow, it sounds strange or unbelievable to a lot of people, but it\u2019s\nthe truth. What happened outside of me, even when that woman was shot in front of me, it\nsomehow didn\u2019t totally touch me inside. You know, I was able to do that, and I didn\u2019t do it\nconsciously, it came just naturally. The defenses kind of helped me.",
        "Q: Right. But up until the deportation, you had your entire family, who was al -- who couldn\u2019t\nprotect you from everything.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But there was a kind of --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: -- buffer for you, right?",
        "A: There was, and -- certainly, and I think what helps people young and old is when they are\nvery, very busy and focused. And I was very busy. I was studying English and Spanish, I was\ngetting some education by hook or by crook, which the Nazis didn\u2019t want us to have, and I was\nkeeping house, and I was cooking. And my father worked from dawn till dusk in construction,\nand my mother worked very hard in the factory, in the belt factory. So I didn\u2019t have that much\ntime, and somehow I was able, the little time when I had some was at night, and I wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to read in bed until 12, one or two o\u2019clock at night, but I did that, and I always had a\nflashlight, I actually, you know, read by flashlight. So --",
        "Q: Did you read under the covers, or over?",
        "A: Yes, when they -- well, I listened if somebody was coming, because they knew that I was\nreading, and I was reprim -- reprimanded many, many times, but those were the only times that I\nreally could read. I was very busy, you know, taking --",
        "Q: What were you reading?",
        "A: Oh, junk.",
        "Q: Was that the only thing that was available?",
        "A: No, but it appealed to me, these -- these western stories. I must have read every one of these\nKarl May books, which --",
        "Q: They were really popular, weren\u2019t they?",
        "A: They were really popular, and they were really boys\u2019 books. And there were some girls\u2019\nbooks that were very popular, but I didn\u2019t go for those. I went for the Karl May books, and I\ndidn\u2019t go for the nice girl books, and the romance stuff, but for the Indians and the wars, and I\ndon\u2019t know. A psychologist has to decide what\u2019s in it.",
        "Q: And where did you get the books from?",
        "A: I got them in school when I was still going to my school, and then my father got some for me\nbecause I was so interested in -- in them. And I don\u2019t really remember, maybe my aunts.",
        "Q: Tell me, did your father burn all of his books, or a selected group?",
        "A: No, just the books that he knew were on the forbidden list.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But don\u2019t forget, my father had a tremendous library when we were in -- in Aplerbeck, in that\nsuburb there of Dortmund. And then, by the time they moved to Dusseldorf, they had to get into\na much smaller apartment, and they had lost a lot, and he had sold a lot of things. What he did\nwith some of the books that he did not take to Diisseldorf, whether he gave them away, or sold\nthem -- I know they tried to sell a lot of things, I really don\u2019t know. But certainly that whole set\nof furniture, that was sold, I know that, in -- in his study. It was beautiful furniture with a\nbookcase that covered almost the whole wall, and leather chair and -- and a -- and a big desk,\nbecause I know that so well, I\u2019m not -- wasn\u2019t supposed to go into my father\u2019s study, but I often\ndid, when I know nobody was around, and I was rummaging around, and I did read some books\nthat were kind of forbidden books for me, which were in his library and had a lot of sex in it. I\ndon\u2019t think I understood a lot of it, but I read it. My parents didn\u2019t know that I read it.",
        "Q: Tell me about your brother during this period. Now, he\u2019s not going to school, but he\u2019s\nsignificantly younger.",
        "A: Well, he went to school longer than I did, because when our school was burned down, d --\nDuisberg was the only --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- Jewish school that was still in existence, and so he traveled by train with a permit to\nDuisberg, and that was before we had to wear the star. And he -- wa -- he -- he got some\nadditional tutoring from my Uncle Karl, and my father did a lot of tutoring in math, which was\nhis strength, I mean, he was a man who -- who could give you fractions and anything by ha -- in\nhis head. He didn\u2019t even have to use a pen and a -- a pencil and paper. So he did get s --\ninstruction. He also had a very beautiful voice, and he -- and he loved to sing. So wi -- you know,\nwe made the most of what we could.",
        "Q: Did he help you with the housework, was he in the house a lot?",
        "A: No, not particular. I mean, I think he was willing probably, if I asked him something, but in\nGermany that was really a girl\u2019s work and a woman\u2019s work. Not -- my father would do anything,\nbut I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t particularly recall that I asked him to do much in the house. I probably asked\nhim to go and -- and buy certain things, or go to the store, but --",
        "Q: But was that also difficult because there were certain hours only when you could go to the\nstore, or you could be refused easily?",
        "A: Well, we could be refused, but it was worse after we wore the star. See, before we wore the\nstar, people didn\u2019t yi -- know you were Jewish. In Diisseldorf some of the people did know, who\nknow the Lennebergs, which was a family who had lived in Disseldorf for a long, long time. I\nmean, they\u2019re a very established family. But I recall mostly being beaten up and being refused\nwhen we first had these food stamps which had printed Jude all through them. And when we --\ncertainly after we had to wear the star.",
        "Q: And who beat you up?",
        "A: Well, bunch of kids who came out of school, and many of them in uniform. The Hitler youth\nand the BDM, I mean they were uniformed, and you know some people have made the\nconnection, oh they are like -- they were like the boy scouts, and the girl scouts, well they were\nnot. They were indoctrinated. They had leaders who actually told their -- the young people under\nthem that it was their duty as good Germans -- and I\u2019m talking now about Germans, not about\nJews, to listen to their fathers, and -- to their father and mother and grandparents and family, and\nif they heard anything in the house, that anybody in their family said something derogatory about\nthe Fuhrer, it was their duty to tell him. This was the -- the leader, the boy scout le -- the youth\nleader. And there were many people who found themselves in trouble because their own children\ndenounced them. And these were the kids who were made to feel like heroes if they di -- did that.\nAnd their leaders were usually young guys in their late teens, who were good scouts, very good\nhikers, you know, like -- like the boy scouts. And -- somebody they could look up to. They\nwanted to be as good as climbing mountains and -- and swimming and all this kind of thing. And\nthey were much more impressionable when these young people talked to them, and told them\nwas to do, than their parents, which is a normal thing even 1n a normal society. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. And then if -- especially after we wore the star, there were bunch of kids, they had\nthese meetings almost on a nightly basis, where they were indoctrinated, they sang the Hitler\nsongs. And they came out of these meetings, and if they saw a Jew, they would beat him up. And\nit\u2019s mu -- it\u2019s much easier for 10 kids to do it than for one. One would start, oh, there\u2019s a Jew,\ncome on. And then they would start saying, Jude ist signate spitze augen ecke, arschloch dreckig,\nwhich 1s -- it\u2019s very vulgar, you know, I translated it in my book, but the Jew with the -- with the\npointy nose, and a dirty asshole, and you know, things like that. And that\u2019s what we were\nsubjected to every day when we were out. I hated to go out any more.",
        "Q: Did you fight back when they beat you?",
        "A: Oh, no, I mean --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- if you fought back --",
        "Q: It was worse.",
        "A: -- and I was -- that\u2019s one thing my parents told me, never to fight with BDM, which were the\ngirls, or the Hitler youth, because if you were one person they would gang up on you, and\ncertainly the police would come, and y -- I would have put my parents into harm\u2019s way, too.\nWho told you to do that? Did your parents indoctrinate you to do that?",
        "Q: So were you hurt?",
        "A: No, I was never hurt. I was pushed against the wall a coup -- people were hurt, I knew people\nwho were hurt, but I was never hurt. And my parents asked me couldn\u2019t I do my shopping and\nstuff at a certain time, and don\u2019t go out in the late afternoon, and then pretty soon it was resolved,\nwe weren\u2019t allowed to go out at dusk any more anyway. So --",
        "Q: So in July of 1942, you get a notice to go to Terezin.",
        "A: Yeah, I was the f --",
        "Q: And on -- and only you.",
        "A: Only I, I was the first one to get that notice. And my parents -- which again, you know, I was\na young girl, I didn\u2019t quite a -- quite appreciate what my parents must have gone through. And I\nremember their discussions, what are they going to do. They would refer to me as a child, even\nthough, you know, by -- by that time, in f -- in \u201942 --",
        "Q: You're 16.",
        "A: I was 16. They can\u2019t let their child go alone. And then they also, rightly so felt, well now,\nshe\u2019s going to go now to a labor camp. Nobody knew about concentration camps. Extermination\ncamps, nobody had -- could even imagine. Excuse me. Now then, she\u2019s going to go to one labor\ncamp, and then maybe next month Biibchen, my brother would be sent to another labor camp,\nand my father -- we would all be separated. So I know they went through a terrible time, trying\nto figure out what to do. The conclusion they made was wrong, they should have let me go alone,\nbut they didn\u2019t, and they all volunteered to go with me.",
        "Q: Including your mother?",
        "A: Including my mother. And I had -- believe I had mentioned before that Puetz, who was the\nhead of the Gestapo, hated my mother. And I\u2019m sure it was just to hurt her, certainly no -- he\nknew where we were going, but certainly not out of compassion that he wasn\u2019t going to let her\ngo with us. And he probably felt because I say this since he pursued my mother at the factory\nwhere she was working, at the Schreyeck\u2019s, almost on a weekly basis, he probably felt that if he\ncouldn\u2019t have her, if -- he was going to trap her, and she was going to -- to get to what the\nGermans used to call numero sicher, number secure, which was a camouflage word for sending\npeople to prison. So then he said she couldn\u2019t go with us, and she appealed, and no way was he\ngoing to allow her to go with us. So my brother and my father and I, we were deported. And in\nDisseldorf they had a wonderful place to deport Jews from, which was a Dusseldorf\nslaughterhouse, the Schlachthof. The reason was probably partially vicious and partially\nconvenience, because the Schlachthof had a lot of train rails, so they could divert trains to the\nSchlachthof without having a spectacle at the main train station deporting the Jews.",
        "Q: Do you think this guy Puetz wanted to have a relationship with your mother?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure of it.",
        "Q: You\u2019re sure of that.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure of it not just from my mother, but I\u2019m sure of it from things my father said, and what\nthe Schreyecks have said. Because even under the circumstances my mother was racially not a\nJew. And this was a racial thing, and after he had made sure she couldn\u2019t go with us to the camp,\nhe still pursued her, you know, which was somewhat unusual.",
        "Q: Right. At the time -- w-were you included in the conversation about what to do, whether they\nall should go, or you should go alone?",
        "A: Not directly.",
        "Q: Not directly.",
        "A: No. I was included, of course, when we had to make a similar decision in Terezin.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But at that time it was mostly my parents. And I know that they didn\u2019t get any sleep, that they\nwere constantly throwing it back and forth. And I would have to make it up, and I don\u2019t do that. I\ntry to be as truthful to my memory as I can.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Whether I said something, I can go alone, which is probably -- it\u2019s most likely I said it, but I\ncan\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t want to say that.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection of feeling relieved that you weren\u2019t going alone? Do you have\nany recollection of what it felt like once the decision was made?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think --",
        "Q: Cause you may not.",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t think I remember having that kind of reaction.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: I think it was a terrible trauma for me, for my father, which I sensed. I mean, even though he\ntried to have a stiff upper lip, but that he wasn\u2019t able to do any more. I was getting older, and I\nknew my father. And this separation from my mother was very, very difficult for him. And times\nwere so uncertain. But yeah, I can\u2019t really --",
        "Q: So are you folks hearing any rumors in 1942 about what happened when the Nazis go into\nRussia? When World War II fully starts in 1941? You don\u2019t hear anything?",
        "A: No, we only hear what the Nazis told us in their propaganda. We heard through my father\u2019s\ncommunist friend in the same building, and when my father listened to also, which was British\nnews, what was happening in the world, in the war. And it didn\u2019t sound very good at that time, as\nyou know. But nobody that I know of ever made any -- gave any explanation to what happened\nin the camps. And as you know, that even when people managed to escape some of the camps,\nand try to bring it to the attention of the American government, which I didn\u2019t know, we -- we\nonly learned that, you know, after the war, nobody wanted to listen, nobody wanted to -- to\nbelieve it. And what I have to say to you is had I not been in Auschwitz, had I not been a\nwitness, had not -- had I not seen what I have seen, I\u2019m not sure I could believe it. A teacher at\none of the high schools was very upset with two students. It\u2019s a very large high school in a\nworking class area in -- in New Jersey, and in New Jersey it\u2019s compulsory to teach about the\nHolocaust. And these kids, at least one of them claimed, and maybe the other one agreed then,\nthat this was all made up, this never happened, and when she said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to have a\nspeaker who was there,\u201d they made fun of that. So when I came to this high school with ha --\nwhich has two and a half thousand students, I was told that these two guys will be put right in the\nfront in the auditorium. And their attitude was such I knew this meant trouble. So I made eye\ncontact with them, and I said, \u201cI understand that there are some people here who believe and are\nconvinced that this never happened.\u201d And they were, you know, they were perking up. And then\nI said, \u201cWell, I can understand it. If I hadn\u2019t been there, I wouldn\u2019t believe it either.\u201d And from\nthen on, I had no more problem with them.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: You know, it disarmed them. But I didn\u2019t say this t -- just to calm them down, I really mean\nthat. This is totally, totally incomprehensible to any normal human being, what I saw. Totally.\nAnd so I -- I -- I really think it\u2019s beyond a civilized person\u2019s comprehension.",
        "Q: Well let me ask you, you must have met people -- this is going beyond where we are in the\ntime, but you must have met people who went through something of what you went through.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Perhaps were even in the camps longer than you were.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Who did realize what was happening before they saw it. Do you -- do you have an\nunderstanding of how some people can imagine this happening? There were people who left\nGermany.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: This -- this guy who said, you know, I forget who it was, who left and said the -- you know,\nsoon you\u2019re not going to be able to ride the buses, and everybody was laughing.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So he seemed to be able to imagine at least some stuff.",
        "A: Yeah, but he was one in a million.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I mean, don\u2019t get my statistics --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, right.",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t mean this --",
        "Q: It doesn\u2019t ma --",
        "A: -- you know. I think ho -- Mr. Rosenstein was very different from the majority of Jews. I can\u2019t\ntalk about the eastern Jews. They -- except I have friends, and I made friends in the displaced\nperson camp, and I made friends in the camps, who came from cultured eastern Jewish families.\nI\u2019m not talking about that. I mean the shtetl Jews. They were different from a lot of us, and they\nwere much more in their own circle, and I don\u2019t know how they reacted. I -- I have -- I have no\nclue.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Some of them had been subjected to persecution in Poland and in Russia in the -- in the shtetl,\nbut I just could never have imagined what happened. And I think these unconscious decisions,\nbelieve me, there were many people who fell to pieces.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: People who ran to the wire to electrocute themselves. The only time Buschi and I and Zdena\nwere thinking about that, when we were going to be transported back to Auschwitz, because we\nknew what was awaiting us. But the instincts to live are very, very strong, and are stronger in\nsome people than in others. The strength physically of some people, can not be measured in\nheight or weight. It is something else. I think that supports means a great deal. Now maybe if I\nwould have been all alone someplace in an extermination camp, without anybody to support me,\nbut I with all the mizaira, I had the luck to be with these five women, and the way we supported\neach other really helped us, and helped us to, as I like to put it, put ourselves into a cocoon and\nnot to even be aware of what was happening outside of us. So we all need some support, and it\ncan\u2019t --it cannot all come from the inside, but a lot of it does come from the inside.",
        "Q: But tell me, do you remember what it was like in the slaughterhouse as you were waiting?\nHad you --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t -- it was confusion, and we didn\u2019t know -- we knew we were going to a -- 1n cold --\nin quote, labor camp called Theresienstadt. Well, I had no clue what Theresienstadt was, we\nknew -- we knew that. We were told that the transport would go to Theresienstadt, and we knew\nit was in what was then Czechoslovakia, and we had our --",
        "Q: Is that what the notice said to you, or did the notice just order a deportation?",
        "A: The notice just ordered us whether the -- the Jewish Judische Gemeinde is a Jewish\norganization in Dusseldorf, whether they were told that it would go to Theresienstadt, but I,\nmyself didn\u2019t remember that particularly, how we found out, but the -- the piece of paper I\u2019m\ngoing to give to you, in my father\u2019s handwriting, at the police station in Dusseldorf, where he\nhad to notify them that he was leaving Dusseldorf, in that it says Theresienstadt.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: So -- you see? So I know that somehow we knew we were -- I knew we were -- knew we\nwere going to Theresienstadt, but how we were informed of that, I cannot rec -- recall.",
        "Q: So even though he was being deported, he has to go to the police station and tell them?",
        "A: Yeah, I gave it -- I have that piece of paper for you. I have that.",
        "Q: Quite amazing, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: It\u2019s an apmeldunk for my brother, and with our names, Ursula Sarah, Otto Israel, and Walter\nIsrael. So that -- that piece of paper is in there. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve given you these papers yet.\nYeah.",
        "Q: Quite amazing. Okay, we\u2019re going to have to stop the tape now and change.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: What was it like in that slaughterhouse? Were there just hundreds of thousands of people --",
        "A: Well, is -- that was like bedlam, and don\u2019t forget, by that time, in \u201942, a number of transports\nhad already left Dusseldorf at the end of \u201941, and at the very beginning of \u201942, and -- which were\nnot going to Terezin, but many of them had gone to Poland. And a lot of the people in our\ntransport were quite old, and not in good physical condition. And I remember there were tables\nwhich were manned by Gestapo secret police, and there was one table which was manned by a\nrepresentative of -- from the Jewish community, which had the list of names of all the Jews in\nDisseldorf, who belonged -- who -- o-of Jewish faith, and the Jewish community had this list.\nAnd they were checked off, you know the Germans were very good at ch -- at anything that was\nlists or bureaucracy. And so we were checked off by the Jewish -- a representative of the Jewish\ncommunity, and we were checked off by the SS, to be sure that everybody who had gotten --\ngotten the notification to present themselves had appeared. And then we had to go to another\nperson, a -- a Nazi at a -- at a table where the name, like Ursula Pawel was twice now -- Jewish\ncommunity the -- the SS, and then the secret police, a third one, were given a sign, which were\nput on around our neck, which I don\u2019t recall whether it had a number, that I can\u2019t recall, but it\nhad my name on itt.",
        "Q: On the front?",
        "A: Yes. Everybody on -- in the transport was given a sign. It wasn\u2019t huge, you know, it was a\nsign that -- with a string around the neck.",
        "Q: And was this -- do you remember if it was handwritten?",
        "A: I think it was. It might not have been all of it, but certainly the number, I think, was\nhandwritten, and if I recall it correctly, it was written with pretty heavy black ink, or you know,\npen or whatever.",
        "Q: And you were supposed to wear this on the train -- wear this [indecipherable |",
        "A: Oh yes, we had to wear this on the train, and then we were told to put our suitcases at a\ncertain place and not to touch them, they were going to take care of the suitcases. Of course, we\nnever saw the suitcases again. These were the suitcases that had been packed for -- from 1938\non, to go to this country. And if 1t hadn\u2019t been for the American consul, we would have been in\nthis country. And those suitcases, we never saw again. N-Nobody on the transport. The only\nthing that we were allowed to keep was some hand luggage, which was made out of like -- like a\nsmall rucksack material, which I remember I had, it was one of those, like when you go on a\nhiking trip, and it was a bag like that. Now, that\u2019s all I had.",
        "Q: And what -- do you remember what was in it?",
        "A: I can\u2019t recall exactly. Probably some food or something, but n-nothing that I remem -- no\nclothing, nothing.",
        "Q: And this was the summer. So what were you we -- were you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you had nothing for cold weather, obviously.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And was it very hot?",
        "A: It was extremely hot, and we -- we -- when we arrived by train in Baushowiczy, which was\nBauschowitz, because there was no train station, no rails to Terezin, they were only built later for\nthe sole purpose of transporting Jews from Terezin to the east. But we arrived in Bauschowitz,\nand there were trucks there with Czechs who had been in Terezin since \u201941, and some of them\nhad striped uniforms on, which also was not continued, you know, after more and more transport\narrived, they did not give uniforms to inmates any more. And they had to -- they worked for the\nNazis to -- to take all the luggage out of the luggage cars, and put them on trucks. And of course,\nthey were then transported back to Germany. We were given some clothing later on in Terezin,\nwhich -- what transport they came from I don\u2019t know, but they were pretty bad clothing. But as\nfar -- y -- one thing I do remember, that my mother insisted that we wear our coats. Now why she\ninsisted that, I don\u2019t know, but it was something we did not put in our luggage. We either had it\non our arm, and so we did have our coats.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And these coats, I remember these coats, and my mother reminded me many times, because\nshe had a German tailor who was an anti-Nazi and was very good to -- to her, and he -- she got\nsome material and he made these coats for us. So they were supposed to also take us to America.\nSo my brother -- and I remember the coat too, because I blamed the coat very much on the fact\nthat my -- my brother was selected immediately to be -- to be killed. You know, he was 13 years\nold, and he was of average height for his age. He had a very young face, and he had this coat,\nwhich he had outgrown. And a boy with a coat, with a gray coat -- and you know with a -- half\nthe arms are -- are showing, it makes a young child even look younger. So, you know, you can\nargue. I went through this in my mind, you know, how big was he, because there were some kids\nthey were 14, by some -- somehow they managed to survive, but my brother didn\u2019t. He looked\nlike a -- a young kid.",
        "Q: When you got on the train to go to Terezin, what sort of a train was it? Was it a passenger\ntrain, was it a --",
        "A: They had some passenger cars, and they had some cattle cars, and we were in the passenger\ncar. And I am not sure that it -- there was any significance to that, whether this was calculated or\nnot. And I remember the two people who were on the train with us, and in the same -- on the\nsame bench, or whatever you want to call it, and one was a nurse, Bella, and one was a woman\nmy father knew, he -- she was a radiologist in Boston. And they were in the same compartment.\nThere were other people in --",
        "Q: A radiologist in Boston? You just said --",
        "A: In -- in Dusseldorf.",
        "Q: Ah, sorry.",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t mean that. Sorry about that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I think my association with saying Boston 1s because as you know, I went into x-ray, and I\nwas in touch with a lot of radiologists in Boston. No, she was from Dusseldorf, and she was on\nthe transport, and I don\u2019t know what happened to them. I mean, I know they got to Terezin, but I\ndon\u2019t know what happened to them, and I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t remember the physician\u2019s last\nname, I only remember Bella. I was very impressed with them, because there was a lot of\nmedical language going back and forth between Bella, who was a nurse, and this physician. And\nI thought that would be really neat for me to be in medicine. That I remember.",
        "Q: Was that a terrible trip?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that it was terrible for me. I think it was terrible for older people, and some of\nthem were in cattle cars. We were in a passenger car. I think that we had some food that my\nmother had prepared for us in our sidebags, and somehow between the conversation we had, and\nmy father had a -- some -- there was some men he was friendly with, and they had lively\nconversations. We weren\u2019t depressed. I think he was more than we were because of the\nseparation from my mother, but I\u2019m not sure that I understood, or that anybody understood what\nwe were facing, because we were going to go to this wonderful labor camp, and then somebody\nspread the word this was a privileged camp for German Jews. And when we came to Terezin, the\nfirst thing that was very difficult for me was the language. The Czech prisoners descended on the\ntrain, and this was a language I\u2019d never heard in my life, and I couldn\u2019t make out what they were\nsaying. And most Czechs speak German, especially educated Czechs. Of course, we all hated\nanything German. And even though we were Jews in Terezin, do you think the Czechs would\nhave spoken one word -- the ch -- Czech Jews would have spoken one word of German with us?\nI mean, I was completely lost. And I tried to -- to get some help from some Czech inmates. As\nsoon as they heard German, that was like raising the red flag, you know. So we had to -- we had\nto really battle on more than one front. And the Czechs had come to Terezin, they were the first\npeople to come to Terezin. So all the good quarters were occupied by Czechs. The jobs that were\nreally good, like in the kitchen were by the ch -- the Czechs already held those. And I was just\nvery lucky. A lot of people weren\u2019t as lucky as I was. I immediately volunteered to work. And\nthey asked me if I had any experience working with children. They first send me to the bauhof,\nwhich was my father worked, to carry wood and stuff. But then I had told them that I was good\nwith children, and what made me do that, I have no clue. And then I got in t -- was told to\npresent myself, that they were going to send me to work in the youth home -- the youth barrack,\nL410 it was first, and then it was 414. And it was -- the youth barrack was just starting, it was at\nthe very beginning. We -- we didn\u2019t really have -- there were some pr -- rooms didn\u2019t even have\nbeds, so we got thre -- three tier bunkbeds, and my father did a lot of work to make it more\nlivable for us.",
        "Q: So, are you taking care o -- didn\u2019t at some point you also take care of teenage kids, or did you\ngo immediately to the orphans?",
        "A: Yeah, my first job in the youth home was really -- not to have my -- the sole responsibility,\nbut I was working with Hilde Dublon, who was at least four years older than I was, she came\nfrom Hamburg. And she was what was called the head betreuer, you know, the chief betreuer,\nchief caretaker of the 30 children in our room. They were -- some were between 14 and 16 years\nold in the first room.",
        "Q: So they\u2019re not much younger than you?",
        "A: No, no, but somehow I -- I got that. I was quite mature in my ways. And Hilde and I hit it off\nbeautifully. There was never any tension, or any rivalry, and I loved her. She was a beautiful\nwoman, very intelligent woman. And then we had a few terrible situations health-wise in\nTerezin. We had a lot of lice, and particularly Kleider Lause, which are the lice that cause\ntyphoid -- typhus. The bad stuff, not the paratyphoid, but the bad stuff. And they lay their eggs in\nthe seams of clothing, and they transmit that disease. And there was an epidemic that broke out,\nwhich nobody realized was typhus, and some of the kids 1n our room got sick. And then there\nwere kids in other rooms that got sick, and they had -- we didn\u2019t know what the symptoms were,\nand we had some very good Czech doctors, but they had no medicines, and they had no way of\ncombating these illnesses. And then we lost a couple of kids, and then Hilde got sick. And we\ndidn\u2019t associate it w-with the other deaths, we didn\u2019t know what it was. And she told me she\ncouldn\u2019t eat. Now for anybody not to be hungry in Terezin, you really had to be sick. So, she had\nher rations on the plate, and she couldn\u2019t finish it. And I shared the same bunkbed with her, there\nwere three -- they were three story high -- stories high, and we had the top bunkbed. And Hilde\nsaid, \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t eat my food, do you want to finish it?\u201d So I finished her food. And you\nknow, typhus is very contagious, and I\u2019m not even sure whether I used another spoon, we\nweren\u2019t very careful. And one day Hilde died. And we lost a few more kids. It was a terrible\nepidemic. And then we were told by Dr. Freund who also perished -- he was a gorgeous guy, a\nCzech guy, and the most bud -- bud -- body, I tell you, everybody was in love with this guy, but\nunfortunately he was married. And he -- what this man did, he did -- he was a fairly young\ndoctor, he was maybe in his mid to late 30\u2019s, and he -- these doctors di -- did heroic things, they\nhad no medicines, they tried everything they could. And he said to me, \u201cThe first thing you have\nto do is clean this place.\u201d And we did get some Lysol, and we had a cleaning procedure that we\ncleaned every bunkbed. And we had the floors, and the walls, and everybody helped, and the\nplace stank from Lysol. And then the ghetto elders sh -- told everybody they had to -- they had to\nclean their places, that was the only way to stop the epidemic, and eventually the -- we managed\nto stop it. And my father and my brother got typhus too, but he did not get the real typhus, he got\nthe paratyphus, which gives people a fever, but doesn\u2019t affect their body the way the real typhus\ndoes, and he recovered from that.",
        "Q: And did you get typhus?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t get a thing.",
        "Q: Even though you had eaten --",
        "A: I had eaten, I was next to her, I ha -- I got nothing. I -- I -- how can you explain it? Nothing.\nThen we had another epidemic after -- well, let me go on first. These were older ch -- young\npeople, and they needed a -- what they called a betreuer, a person in charge of the young people,\nwhich was really 24 hour job. And they needed somebody for younger children in another room.\nAnd the head of our youth home, Sigi Kwasniewski, who also perished, told me that he was\ngoing to give me a room by myself, and as there were at least 30 children in there, but that they\nwere younger children, and a lot of them were orphans, and a lot of them had come from Poland.\nAnd they didn\u2019t know what happened to their parents. And some of them were quite traumatized,\nbut wouldn\u2019t talk about it. Th -- I got that room, but then Sigi Kwasniewski decided it was too\nmuch for one person. There was another woman from Vienna, Trude Blau, who was made the\nhead betreuer in that room, she was quite a bit older than I was. She also had an affair with Sigi\nKwasniewski, and that wasn\u2019t a happy time for me. She was not an easy person to -- to deal with,\nand she was very ambitious, and eventually I -- she married Sigi Kwasniewski, and she got a job\nin the -- what do they call it, the office of kanzlei, and I had the sole responsibility for my room.",
        "Q: Was that better?",
        "A: Much better. Oh, I was all ready to quit. I was ready -- I was going to go -- I hated to do that\nto -- to -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the strange thing. You know, my mother and my aunts sent uncountable\npackages to the Red Cross, with fictitious senders, but I knew where they came from, because it\ncame from -- anything close to my aunts. And there were a few packages that came from Vienna,\nand my father recognized my mother\u2019s handwriting, and he was sure my mother was alive in\nVienna. But she made up all these -- these people, you know. Marie Unterbottom, and you -- you\nname it, I mean, and she made up addresses. And my aunt told me -- my aunts, after the war, that\nthey constantly sent packages. And my aunt did a lot of bartering because her husband made\nfurniture, and it was in an area that was totally unaffected by the war, and she would barter with\nthe -- with the farmers, and then she could use some of the stuff to get vitamins and things, and\nalso sausage that was highly smoked so it wouldn\u2019t spoil. And even if we only got 10 or 20\npercent of the packages -- it didn\u2019t go on all the time we were in Terezin, but for a period of time\nwe got packages. And Trude\u2019s brother, came down with TB, and there wasn\u2019t a package that\ncame from my mother and my aunts who I didn\u2019t share the vitamins and the food with Herbert\nBlau. And hi -- and her parents never forgot that. So in other words, you know, we separated\nways, but she al -- but she -- I don\u2019t think she had bad feelings towards me because I was very\ngenerous to Herbert.",
        "Q: Did you notice a lot of sexual activity in Terezin? That there were a lot of people coupling?",
        "A: Well, there was a woman, a Czech woman who was as sexy as anybody can imagine. And she\nwas supposed to help me in the room. She was much older than I was, and I was horrified\nbecause we had ladders to go up to th -- to the third bunkbed, and she doesn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t wear\nunderwear, and she was, you know, she was very sexy, very flirty, and I\u2019m sure she had her\nexperiences. My kids were too small. There was no sexual activity. I had none. I\u2019m sure that\nsome people did. I could have had it with Louis Lowy, but I -- it\u2019s not that I was prude, I mean\nhe just -- I -- I loved him as a friend, but he just didn\u2019t turn me on. I\u2019m sure there was a lot going\non, especially among the Czechs. Some of the Germans were quite old, but that\u2019s all I witnessed.\nAnd the kids were really too small in my room. And then I\u2019m thinking about the -- the people\nwho had the same job that I had -- excuse me.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Louis was a good friend of mine. The idea to have any sexual contact with him, I couldn\u2019t\neven have fathomed. There were Kurt Kohorn, who didn\u2019t do anything for me either, and he\nprobably wasn\u2019t interested in me either. Whether they had any sexual activities, I don\u2019t know. I\nwas younger than they were. I mean, they were my friends, but -- because in many ways I was\nmature, but sexually I\u2019m not sure I was that mature, you know.",
        "Q: Right, right. Did you go to seminars and lectures and concerts?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, and don\u2019t forget, in -- when we came to Terezin, we were not supposed to\nteach or learn. That was strictly verboten. So all the teaching of our children, all the lectures,\nwere all done clandestinely. And I remember distinctly that we were taking turns watching\nwhether the SS was descending into the camp, and giving, you know, sounding the alarm when\nthey did, not knowing what they were up to. So --",
        "Q: Do you remember hearing opera, or hearing --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: My brother sang in the children\u2019s choir of Carmen, he had a very good voice.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, we saw Brundibar, and Carmen, and -- and I --",
        "Q: And did he sing in Brundibar as well?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: He did.",
        "A: Yeah, and the Angabilda ti conquer, and you -- you name it. Natung avisor, you know, I\nmean, the things we did, and the talent we had. I was nothing. I was a young girl who -- who had\nvery limited experience, but I really matured very much among these people. We had professors\nfrom Vienna and from -- from Germany, and they would give lic -- lectures, and we had\nmusicologists and I tried to -- to learn how to read music, and I\u2019m not sure that I applied myself,\nor maybe I\u2019m too stupid for it, but that I didn\u2019t manage too well. We had classes in algebra and\narithmetic, particularly Louis, who was a lifelong friend of mine, was very bright. He eventually\nbecame a professor at BU, was a very close friend of my husband\u2019s. He -- he tau -- he gave so\nmany lectures. And there was a biologist from Vienna, and -- and these people were so eager to -\n- to teach us, because we er -- weren\u2019t supposed to learn. If you are not supposed to do\nsomething, there is a tremendous incentive to do it. So yes, we tried our best to educate our kids,\nbut then there were transports going all the time. We had no clue where they were going.",
        "Q: You still had no clue.",
        "A: We had no clue, especially the orphans. I mean, I still see them today, some of them. There\nwere a couple of girls, one was very tall Mira Hankriff, and one was very short. They had been\norphaned. Their whole families had been killed. And they never talk much about it, and I think\nnow if they had I\u2019m not sure we could have even believed them. But they had formed such a\nbond with each other. I have never seen anything like that in young people, wa -- the bond they\nhad. And it only reminded me of the bond Hannah and Zdena and Buschi and I formed later on.\nBut, you know, this was -- there were -- kids were coming and going. And then you heard these\nrumors that there were s -- one transport came in with kids, they were all full of lice and they\nwere so undernourished, and they were in such bad shape, and this and that was supposed to\nhappen to them, and then there was a name, I don\u2019t know where it comes from, maybe there\u2019s a\nYiddish in it, bonkes, which means rumors. Anything that anybody said that couldn\u2019t be\nquantified, or really you didn\u2019t know where it came from was called bonkes. So they said, oh,\nthese are just bonkes, you know, you can\u2019t believe everything you hear, they just make all -- and\nthese are kids, you know, they make these things up. And then the Nazis send transports with\norphans and young people and I remember this horrible thing where they said they were going to\nSwitzerland, there was a transport. And then later on we found out, you know, Switzerland was\ngoing into the gas. I don\u2019t remember whether they went to -- which extermina-ination camp they\nwent to. So, it was difficult to get news when you were in Terezin, and I\u2019m afraid that we\nweren\u2019t any better than the outside world. Even when we heard some rumors, we didn\u2019t believe\nthem, you know.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember somebody by the name of Freddi Hirsch?",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely.",
        "Q: What do you know -- what do you know about Fred?",
        "A: Well, Freddi -- I think Freddi perished in -- in the -- in Auschwitz. I get the goose bumps\nwhen I think of it. Freddi and a lot of families were sent to Auschwitz to the Familienlager. And\nI don\u2019t remember the -- the -- the month when it was. I think it was in \u00b044, but I\u2019m not, you\nknow, I\u2019m -- that was very unusual that they allowed whole families to go, but we didn\u2019t know it\nwas going to Auschwitz, but we -- only after the war did I learn that they had this Familienlager\nin Auschwitz where they had set aside a whole area where families could live together, because\nin Auschwitz, as soon as you got there, the children and the women and -- and men were\nseparated. And they were in Auschwitz for quite a long time. And Freddi had -- did a lot with the\nchildren, and he was highly respected. But he had also some contacts with people in Auschwitz,\nwho had contacts knowing what was happening. And if I recall that -- my recollection after the\nwar, when I came to Deggendorf, which was mostly occupied by survivors of Terezin, I think the\nBlaus told me, because you know, I -- we were not in -- in Terezin the whole time any more, that\nFreddi and I forget who else, somebody else who was very prominent, knew when the\nFamilienlager was going to be eliminated. And they went through this terrible agony, whether\nthey should inform everybody and fight back in some way, and you know, and cause a\ntremendous disruption. All you could do is cause a disruption, because you had machine guns\nfrom all corners, I mean nobody could have any illusion that they could survive. And from what\nI understand, Freddi and some of the other people came to the conclusion that if they will do so,\nthey would cause such bedlam and such fear, and nobody was going to be saved anyway, and the\nchildren, instead of going into the gas not knowing where they were going, they were going to\nbe, you know, like hunted animals. And they all went into the gas. Now, I don\u2019t know if my\nrecollection is correct. I\u2019m sure you know Freddi Hirsch\u2019s story. I was not in the family camp, so\n-- so I can only tell you what some of my friends told me happened.",
        "Q: Do you remember Freddi from Terezin?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you know him at all?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what was he like?",
        "A: I we -- I mean, I reme -- I -- I wasn\u2019t a close friend of his, but I remember him as th -- he was\nvery sporty, he did a lot of sports with the kids, he was very encouraging. He -- he was, you\nknow, the -- some people you can\u2019t analyze what makes this guy be appreciated and respected by\neverybody? What makes him a leader? And that was Freddi Hirsch.",
        "Q: Was he much older than you, a few years older, do you have any recollection?",
        "A: I thought he was quite a few years older, but I -- you see, when I came to Auschwitz, in 1944\n-- I was born in \u201926, so what -- I was 18 years old. Freddi might have been in his early 20\u2019s, you\nknow, but I can\u2019t be -- in other words, you know, he -- I was this -- this 18 year old girl, not --\nyou know, mature as far as m -- my ability to take care of young people, but sexually and every\nother way, I was not a very mature person.

        "A: Well, it was horrible, but my father did so many good deeds for the cooks, that we got much\nbetter food. I mean, was the same type of food, but we got more of it, we got puddings, which\nnobody could even dream about. We got knoedle, you know, the dumplings. Yeah, he -- he -- he\nbuilt -- you know, he could do anything, and he built cabinets for the cooks and chairs for the\ncooks, and benches and all this for their quarters, and he was rewarded with food.",

        "A: Yeah. Oh yeah, the cooks were -- they were as fat as -- we hated them.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yeah, we hated them. We had -- th-the Czechs make a dish called knodlicki, which 1s -- it\u2019s a\nflour dish like a dumpling with some sors -- sort of a buttery, sweet sauce on 1t. We had some of\nthat, and -- and of course coffee, which was not coffee, which was like black -- some black sauce\nof some -- some sort. And spreads which were undefinable what they were, were supposed to be\nmarmalade, and wasn\u2019t a real marmalade, lot of artificial junk in it. One thing that might be\ninteresting to you 1s that I think they put something in our food, or maybe it was just the\nnourishment itself, but the -- most women didn\u2019t menistrate any more.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you.",
        "A: Yeah. I lost my -- I lost that, completely, until I came out of the camps, and then I think it\ntook probably a year or more before it came back. So -- and there were rumors that they put\ncertain things in the food, I really don\u2019t know, I have no clue what they did.",

        "A: -- in the skin, and a lot of them were half rotten potatoes, but again, we had much better food\nthan most, and so did my room, because my father never just brought the food for me or my\nbrother. Was our room, and Louis\u2019 room. And Louis never forgot that either, and he smuggled\nthings into there.",
        "Q: So you ate in your room with the kids?",
        "A: Oh yes. And also what my father did, when we -- when I took the room over, they kept their\nbread rations, all that stuff, in their beds. And then my father felt that that was also breeding a lot\nof disease, and -- and el -- you know, fl -- we had a lot of fleas and all kinds of stuff. So he made\na cupboard which had 30 compartments in it, and each child had their own compartments, and\nthen in my room nobody was allowed to have any food in the compartments. These were kids\nwho were starved, and I can tell you, there was so much discipline in my room. I was very\nyoung, but Papa Lenneberg, Papi they called him, because I called him Papi, he was only known\nas Papi. He told them, and -- and em -- emphasized that you don\u2019t touch anybody else\u2019s\ncompartment. And you know, in all that time, I don\u2019t remember once a kid stealing out of\nanother compartment. You know?",
        "Q: And how old are these kids?",
        "A: Well, they were between -- they were about t -- 10 - 12 - 13.",
        "Q: Needing a lot of food, I would suspect.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But you know, like I said before, I didn\u2019t sit there and eat the stuff my father brought. We\nshared everything. And all the packages that I got, they were opened on the table. There was a\ntable with a long bench on each side, and -- and I would -- we would cut everything. We would\ncut th-the chocolate, and whatever was in it, and everybody got something. And we shared. And\nI don\u2019t recall that any other children got packages, because how many children in -- in Terezin\nhad aunts in Germany who could do that kind of thing?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, so with all my venom against the Red Cross, you know, we did th -- we -- because\nmy venom, you know what they stems from, from -- from the Red Cross visit to Terezin. But\nthen I sometimes think you\u2019re not just -- the Red Cross did get a lot of packages in. Probably of\nthe -- of a hundred packages, even if you -- if only 15 made it --",
        "Q: That was something.",
        "A: -- and they were sent to my father, my brother, and to me. And then also, to Herbert Blau,\nbecause somehow my -- my father was able to thank you for the package, and Herbert Blau\nreally enjoyed it too. So then my aunts send another package to Herbert Blau.",
        "Q: And were you teaching these kids? What did you do all day?",
        "A: I was learning, and I was teaching. I was reading with them, and I was lacking a lot of\neducation, but I was also learning a lot and taking seminars, etcetera. I did speak English quite\nwell.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh yeah, because my parents -- I mean, I had a lot of education, even when -- after our school\nwas burned down, because I learned English and Spanish and some French, which eventually\nwas too much, because I was speaking French with a Spanish -- I mean, was just getting too\nmuch. But whatever I learned, I taught my kids. Then there were some people who were very\nartistic, and they learned to draw, etcetera, and make poems, they were encouraged to write\nstories. And then some of these professors gave lectures, and gave them homework, and they\nlearned, and then if the SS came, everything was shoved aside, and we had certain places, you\nknow, under the boards, and we would hide things. And then later on, I think a lot of those\nrestrictions were not enforced as much any more, yeah.",
        "Q: What was the mood of these kids? Do you know?",
        "A: It depended. There were some who seemed somewhat depressed, especially the ones who had\nno family. Were some who very busy reading. Do you -- have you heard about Ruth Klueger?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: She was in my room.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: She was one of my kids. And she is in a category all by herself. She wasn\u2019t the eady -- easiest\nperson. She wrote a book, as you know.",
        "Q: Yeah, I interviewed her.",
        "A: She had a very bad relationship with her mother. And she upsets me because her mother\nsaved her life. I talked to her after she wrote the book. And she -- in her book she\u2019s -- only has\nbad things to say about her mother. And I can\u2019t help myself, I\u2019m thinking about my family, my\naunts, what I would give if they had survived. And she\u2019s spewing all this venom, who actually,\nher mother saved her. Without her mother, she would not have survived. But she is -- she was\nway beyond anybody else in intelligence, reading, she was devouring everything. And she had a\nfriend, Hannah Ungar, who 1s now in Australia, which I didn\u2019t know, Ruth Klueger told me. And\nthese two, they were like this. And Ruth, she hated every -- she hated her father, she hated her\nmother, she hated her relatives.",
        "Q: And was that clear then, that she was so --",
        "A: No, she was -- it was -- was sh -- it was clear that she had a bad relationship with her mother,\nthat was clear. But except for ha -- ha -- for Hannah Ungar, they -- they were very close. But the\nrest of the girls completely left her alone. She was in a category all by herself.",
        "Q: Was she difficult for you?",
        "A: She didn\u2019t give me too much trouble, and she -- it\u2019s interesting how she -- she refers to me in\nher book without name, but as somebody who is not much older than she was -- I mean, she\u2019s a\nfew years older than I am, and who was in charge of the room. But it wasn\u2019t anything\nderogatory, or anything complimentary.",
        "Q: You\u2019re just there.",
        "A: I was just there, I was just there.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you learn Czech?",
        "A: A little bit, but not much, you know how you learn a language just to get by a few things. I\u2019d\nhardly know anything any more, but I -- I never really tried very hard.",
        "Q: So then who did you talk with?",
        "A: Well, they all spoke some English. Once you became friends -- English, some German.",
        "Q: German. Once you became friends.",
        "A: Once you became friends, they accepted you, they spoke German to you.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But it couldn\u2019t have been so easy to become friends if there was no language, or am I wrong?",
        "A: Well, they all speak -- I mean, the educated Czechs all speak German.",
        "Q: German.",
        "A: And -- but they hate German, like I hated German.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s all you had.",
        "A: Yes, but I can understand them better, because when I came out of the camps, I spoke English\nvery well, and I had to speak German to my mother, and to my family. And my mother learned\nEnglish very fast here. But if I could avoid German -- th-the language itself just grated me, you\nknow, it brought back so much, and I hated everything German. And I think Hans helped me a\nlot. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t go as far as the Israelis who were trying to shake, you know, to -- to be\naggressive to a pianist who is playing German music, but I couldn\u2019t stand anything German,\neither.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember your brother\u2019s Bar-mitzvah --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and what that was like?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Can you describe it?",
        "A: Well, he was very good at it. I don\u2019t remember that he made any mistakes. And he was very\nbright. It was not a very festive thing for me, and I\u2019m sure it was a terrible thing for my father,\nbecause it brings -- brought it very much back that where\u2019s a -- where\u2019s my mother, and etcetera.\nBut it was just something that he wanted to do, and my father -- I don\u2019t recall whether my father\never said to him, you know, why do you have to do it. My father was such an agnostic, it didn\u2019t\nmatter to him.",
        "Q: But your brother wanted to do this?",
        "A: He wanted to do it, yeah, he wanted to do it.",
        "Q: And was it done in a synagogue, or a synagogue setting?",
        "A: No, there was no synagogue, but there was a room that was used for services.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And there were some rabbis, and there was, you know, I forget what that was Kline, or who --\nwho coached him, I don\u2019t remember. I have -- would have to make it up, I don\u2019t remember. The\nreason, excuse me, I think I don\u2019t remember is, don\u2019t forget, this was very close to the time when\nwe were deported to Auschwitz. And somehow there, lots of things became a blur, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah, cause this is September \u201943, and you\u2019re deported in October, you know.",
        "A: Not \u201943. We were deported 1-in \u00b044.",
        "Q: \u00b044.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a year later.",
        "A: Yeah, but still, you know, there -- so many things happened, it -- 1t seemed a short time.\nMaybe it was a year, but I don\u2019t remember exactly. Maybe I wasn\u2019t totally with it. And I don\u2019t\nremember who the instigator was. I can\u2019t believe it was Louis, who was in charge of his room,\nbecause Louis was an agnostic too. But somebody must have persuaded him he should make his\nBar-mitzvah. And my father was in a room on a -- 1n a different street, in a different house, with\na couple of guys who were quite Orthodox [indecipherable]. So whether they had an influence,\nthey probably had an influence. But I can\u2019t recall that. I don\u2019t want to claim anything I can\u2019t be --\nyeah.",
        "Q: Right, right. Maybe ritual counts in those times, even if you don\u2019t have a belief. Maybe.",
        "A: I think that it -- th-that\u2019s what it was to a large degree. I mean, I started to learn\n[indecipherable] in Israel. I mean the -- in -- in Terezin. I really wanted to go, if we would get\nout of this mess, I wanted to eventually go to Palestine. There was no Israel then.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I really wonder if I would have ended up in -- in Palestine 1f my mother hadn\u2019t survived.\nBut I found -- I felt that it was just too much to ask my mother to go to th -- what was then\nPalestine, the conditions, and for her to learn Ivrith would have been a lot harder than to -- you\nknow, she knew a little English. I think the idea probably wo -- came to me because when you\nhave been persecuted, you just wonder whether you can exist among non-Jews. You feel so\nvulnerable, the idea that there could be a country where people are of your make-up, and\nwouldn\u2019t persecute you because you are a Jew. There is something attractive to that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In -- a couple of months after your brother\u2019s Bar-mitzvah, there\u2019s a huge, sort of -- everybody\nis taken out of the barracks.",
        "A: Oh, maybe that\u2019s why I don\u2019t remember the Bar-mitzvah too well. Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: Cause this is November \u00b043, right?",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah, that was the worst day I ever experienced in Terezin. One day we were all\nherded into the Bauschowitz basin. And the reason for that was given by the commandant of the\nSS, that th-the elder had not given the right numbers of inmates.",
        "Q: This is Edelstein?",
        "A: Yeah. And then I think he just had some venom against Edelstein, who was a wonderful man,\nand he also, if I remember it correctly, I think accused Edelstein of using his bicycle and riding\nbeyond the borders of was permitted in the ghetto. And they herded us into the Bauschowitz\nbasin. And it was a very drizzly day. Young and old, and some of these old people were in such\ndecrepit condition, and we were supposed to be counted, because the count didn\u2019t jive, as far as\nthe SS was concerned. And we had to stand there at attention for hours and hours and hours with\nthe rain coming down. And SS were stationed -- the basin was like a flat area, and it was\nsurrounded by a dirt wall, and they were positioned on the dirt wall with machine guns, etcetera.\nAnd we were sure we\u2019re all going to be murdered right there on that -- in that basin. And you\nknow, they -- they were beating people up, and they were screaming and they had their guns\ndrawn, they were very intimidating, and it was just horrible. And everybody thought this is it,\nwe're going to be executed. And then eventually, was already beyond dusk, I don\u2019t remember,\nwas very, very late, we were all herded back into the ghetto. And I don\u2019t remember how many\npeople were in Terezin at the time, but the ghetto was very full of people. What -- I\u2019ve to --\nforget what the height of the population was, 40,000 or something like that. And that was about\nit, because after we came back, shortly after, there were lots of transports going east out of\nTerezin. And while we were in the Bauschowitz basin, the SS searched the -- the houses, the\nyouth homes. They ripped out mattresses and I don\u2019t know what all, they were looking for\nvaluables. Then they had the excuse that somebody had hidden valuables and money, because\nyou were not supposed to keep any of that. And actually, I understood -- I was not a witness to\nthat, that in fact in one place in our building, that they found some money somewhere, and that\nthat person was taken into the Kleine Festung, which was a notorious prison. But I -- I was not\nan -- an eyewitness to that, I was an eyewitness to when we came back and everything was torn\napart. Yeah, that was a very scary time. It was -- it was awful.",
        "Q: Now, you mentioned that Edelstein was a wonderful man.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Ho -- do -- is this by reputation that you say this?",
        "A: Yes, and I met him a few times, not that he had any interest in Uschi Pawel -- Uschi\nLenneberg, but there were occasions that he came to the youth home and stuff, and I thought he\nwas a very nice, mild mannered man. Not everybody in the Judenrat had the same reputation.\nMurmelstein had a terrible reputation. And you see, that is the justice of the world. Who\nsurvived? Rabbi Murmelstein.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he had the reputation among us that he was hand in glove with the SS. And Edelstein\nwas deported to Auschwitz, and so were many of the others. And one of the people on the\nJudenrat, Zucker, was on our transport, and also sent right into the gas.",
        "Q: Okay, we have to stop and change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: Uschi.",
        "A: Uschi, yeah. Well --",
        "Q: Do you remember your birthday party?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When you were 18?",
        "A: Yes. I still have -- I still have that\u2019s -- I should -- why didn\u2019t I bring that? Buschi -- well,\nwhen -- you mean in Terezin the birthday party?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, I remember that, but I was thinking about another birthday party --",
        "Q: Oh yes?",
        "A: -- in Merzdorf, yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, well, we\u2019ll talk about that later.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Was it nice in Terezin?",
        "A: Yes, the kids made all kinds of little presents for me, you know, handmade.",
        "Q: The little -- oh, the kids you were taking care of?",
        "A: Yes. And they -- they put on a play for me, and it was a complete surprise, and my brother --\nand he -- ya -- ma -- wrapped up little tiny things, things that probably my father got for him, and\n-- and he put on it, Fur meine liebe schwester.",
        "Q: Aw.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So this was not an adult party, this was a party for these kids, yes.",
        "A: No, this was my chil -- my kids, and my father and my brother.",
        "Q: And your brother.",
        "A: And maybe Louis and a few of the betreuer, but I don\u2019t remember exactly --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- but it\u2019s the kids that made the big impression --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- because they had -- you know, had this play that they made up, somebody had written it,\nand I don\u2019t even remember the -- to be truthful, the contents of the play, I was so overwhelmed\nby the whole thing.",
        "Q: And since you were with them so much, when could they have rehearsed, and done all this?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- they could have because I had a lot of friends there, and they could have done it\nwith the -- all kinds of excuses, you know. Apparently there were a few people helping them,\nyeah.",
        "Q: I see. That\u2019s very sweet.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And I\u2019m sure you remember the pending Red Cross visit. Do you remember all the\npreparation for this?",
        "A: I remember everything because my kids were part of some of this.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Not that they volunteered, I mean, they were just told. The Red Cross was going to visit, and\nwe had what was called verschonerung, beautification. And first of all, they had a huge transport\nleaving Terezin, to make the town look less crowded, that was the first thing. Then the\ncommandant felt he didn\u2019t want any ugly and old Jews in the streets. So when he saw like an old\nperson, or -- some of his deputies went in and rounded up old people, and they came into the\nnext transports. And transports were going constantly, to the east. Of course we know now they\nwent to Auschwitz. And then people were given the job to clean the streets, they actually\nscrubbed the streets, the sidewalks, with soap and water. They got paint, they painted the houses.\nThey started to build a -- an area and decorated it with flowers and green to make way for the\norchestra. And another one for the band shell. Then they -- they established a caf\u00e9. And they\nwould just go and say you -- I mean, some good looking young women, you, you, you, you\u2019re\ngoing to be the waitresses. And these waitresses were strutting around with little white doily\naprons, and you know, those curlicues, stupid stuff in their hair, and they were going to wait on\ncustomers in the caf\u00e9 house. They -- some of our kids were rounded up, and they had to approach\nthe SS Kommandant, who was an awful guy, and call him uncle. I wasn\u2019t involved directly\nmyself, I just visited all this, I just saw all that. One thing I did see, that the elder, our elder, was\ndecorated with a gold chain and a new suit and Nazi limousines were chauffeuring him around\nwith the people from the Red Cross.",
        "Q: This is Marmelstein -- Murmelstein.",
        "A: Yeah. And so it was -- it was a stage and we were the actors. And they were planting flowers\nall over, and the band was playing. And then they started -- they established a bank -- I\u2019m trying\nto remember, a store. And -- and they made this fake Theresienstadt money, which on one side\nhad Moses with the 10 commandments, on the other side it had the -- you know, the ghetto in\nkrone, I think it was, 20 - 50 or what krone. And then the transports, which were always coming\nand going in Terezin. You know that they confiscated all the suitcases. Well, they took some\nstuff out of these suitcases and they put this -- this stuff in the stores to be sold, supposedly. So\nthe Red Cross got the impression they have a this store and a that store, and they have a bank,\nand they have the -- they have a barber and they have a beauty parlor and so on, and so on. I\u2019m --\nit was unreal. Houses were scrubbed and painted. And then these idiots from the Red Cross,\nthat\u2019s why e -- e -- ev -- ever since I came out of Terezin, I have no good word for the Red Cross.\nThey would -- they were dined -- wined and dined by the SS, and riding around in the SS\nlimousine through Terezin. Do you think they got out once to ask anybody a question? Or to try\nto go into one of the houses? I mean, they didn\u2019t even go into the barrack, nevermind these\nindividual houses, where old people were put in the attic, like my grandmother. And they had not\nany more space than that rug in the foyer there, to just spread their blanket, and -- during the\nheat, or the cold, or whatever. And so these -- so many people died in Terezin in -- in those days,\nit -- before -- even before -- died before they had a chance to transport them to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So the Red Cross, th -- they didn\u2019t walk around at all, they just -- 1n the car, the whole time?",
        "A: N-N-No, they -- they were in the car, and if they walked around -- they might have walked\naround and strutted around where the band was, and where everything -- the SS wanted them to\nsee. They -- I didn\u2019t see it myself, but they might have walked into the bank or stuff and -- and\nconvinced themselves that this was a wonderful Jewish town where, you know, Hitler schenkt\nden Juden eine stadt. Where Hitler was giving the Jews a present of a -- of a -- of a town. And\nthey swallowed it all, lock, stock and barrel.",
        "Q: Do you remember a film being made, you --",
        "A: Oh yes, and I rem -- I knew Kurt Gerron very well.",
        "Q: You did? Uh-huh.",
        "A: Kurt Gerron was a filmmaker from Holland, and he was rounded up by the Nazis, and he was\nbrought to Terezin. And Kurt, I don\u2019t know whether he originally came from Holland, but I am\nquite sure I remember that he was -- he was arrested in Holland. At least that\u2019s what I was told. I\nsee him with -- this reminds me -- of course, this was 1944, of all his equipment, making this\nfilm. And, you know, as I said before, we were a stage, we were the actors. My kids were -- were\nin the films. And as soon as Kurt Gerron had finished the film, he was put into a transport to\nAuschwitz, and perished. So yes, I will never forget that.",
        "Q: And how did you come to know him?",
        "A: I think he came to the youth home. I also came to know him -- not -- you know, we were not\nfriends, but I spoke to him because he wanted s -- he needed some of the kids to be part of what\nhe was filming. And some of the kids had been selected, I don\u2019t remember it was the SS or who,\nthey needed so and so many kids. And some of my kids were in that. And I didn\u2019t even see the --\nthe elder, that he had this gold chain on. My kids told me that. You should have seen him, he had\n-- he had a new suit, and a gold chain, and he was being driven around, you know, as a mayor of\nthe city, with the Red Cross.",
        "Q: So it made you live him even more?",
        "A: Oh God. No, I -- and we all feel that way, I mean he came from -- from Vienna, and Dita and\nLouis, and Dita still is my very good friend, she still lives in Boston, and Louis we lost many --\nbefore Hans died, many years ago. And di -- Dita came from Vienna. She hated this guy. I mean,\nnobody liked him. But he survived. And he collaborated very much with the Nazis.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So the Red Cross is there in May of 1944, right?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: A few months later your father gets a deportation. It -- it seems, a -- at least according to your\nbook, that there\u2019s a notice that comes to your father about being deported.",
        "A: Yeah, I happened to be in his room --",
        "Q: When he got it?",
        "A: Yeah, and he got it, 1t wasn\u2019t sent by mail. These notices were given to the elders, they were\neither the room elders or the house elders. My father was in Q 600 dreizehn, I think it was, 613\nin a -- it was like a private home originally. And the elder -- I was visiting my father in his room,\nand the elder comes in and hands him the summons from the SS that he has to present himself on\nsuch and such a date, and he changed color. And I never forget that. And then we had a big\nstruggle, and -- and it was my fault, and -- and it haunted me for years and years. And I pressed\nhim that we should join him. And I should have never done that, and he fought me tooth and nail.\nAnd I said to him, \u201cWell, what was the purpose of you and Bubchen going with me? And then\nnow we\u2019re going to be separated again. I mean, the idea was that we were going to stay\ntogether.\u201d So I decided that Papi is going next week, and I am going the week after, and Bubchen\nis going to be all by himself. So we went with him, supposedly to a labor camp near Dresden.\nSee, that was the terrible thing, and they say that Murmelstein knew where we were going, and --\nand he helped the Nazis by facilitating, you know, their mirage, we were going to a labor camp.",
        "Q: Now, but you think at this point that your father knows what\u2019s going on, because --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, he -- all I can tell you is that when he came back from Zossen, which is near\nBerlin --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- where he worked in Tiefbau supposedly, what was it, for the bunker --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that Hitler\u2019s bunker, and he came in touch with a lot of other workers from different camps,\nhe seemed like a changed person. But he also knew that transports were leaving Terezin on a\ndaily -- on a daily is too much, but at -- on a weekly, or sometimes daily basis, to in quote, other\nlabor camps. So maybe he also felt that we are all going to be getting out of here sooner or later,\nand now we at least know where we are going, and I can\u2019t recall at all, I might have it in my\nbook, what the name of the labor camp was that we were supposed to go to. It was near Dresden,\nand my father was familiar with the name, and that sounded pretty good. And this -- we were\ntold that by the -- by the elder, by Murmelstein, that our transport was going to that place. And I\nremember when we were on the train, which eventually ended up in Auschwitz, my father and\nsome of his friends were looking through, you know, it\u2019s trying to see where they were, which\nwasn\u2019t always possible, and they f -- one of them said, \u201cOtto,\u201d to my father, \u201cwe\u2019re not going,\u201d --\nit\u20191l come to me, the name of that place, \u201cwhere we can\u2019t possibly go there, we\u2019re alya -- already\neast of Dresden.\u201d And that\u2019s when he changed color, and when it probably sank in, we\u2019re not\ngoing to a labor camp, we\u2019re going east of Dresden, we\u2019re going to go to one of the camps in\nPoland, and I think that -- this is conjecture, I have no proof of that -- I think that maybe he did\nmeet up with people. He told me that there were people from different -- different ghettos, or\nwhatever he said, who were working with him on the bunker. And so I think that he got a good\nidea what was going on in some of the eastern camps. But I really feel that he believed that our\ntransport was going to a labor camp near Dresden.",
        "Q: But nevertheless, you had to fight with him about going?",
        "A: Yes, I did, and he didn\u2019t want me to go.",
        "Q: Right. And you won.",
        "A: But -- I won, unfortunately, and believe me, it\u2019s laid on me --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- for -- it still does to this day. Because then I figured if we hadn\u2019t gone, because there were -\n- we were not the last transport to leave Terezin, as you know, but maybe we would have had\nenough of a respite that we would have stayed. And my father was such a strong, healthy man,\nthat maybe he would have had a chance to survive. What I really think happened -- and this\nagain, 1s conjecture -- when we got to Auschwitz, of course you know women and men had --\nwere separated, and my father was with my brother, and my brother was in his winter coat, it was\nPoland, and it was October, and you know, that he had outgrown, and he didn\u2019t look like a -- you\nknow, very big teenager, and I think Mengele, who happened to select us, probably put my\nbrother on one side, and my father on the other, but my father, I\u2019m sure, would not have let his\nson go alone, and maybe said can\u2019t I go with my son, not knowing where he was going. Maybe\neven if he had known where he was going, he wouldn\u2019t have let my brother go alone.",
        "Q: Was this at the begin -- do you remember if it was the beginning of October?",
        "A: Yes, at the very beginning oc --",
        "Q: At the very beginning.",
        "A: -- of October.",
        "Q: So it -- it\u2019s before the uprising?",
        "A: Yes. It was at the beginning of October, yeah.",
        "Q: Well, you know, you couldn\u2019t have known either. You didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, I -- believe me, it\u2019s been on -- it\u2019s been -- and you know, I want to tell you something, I\nnever discussed this too much with my mother. She asked me questions and I told her the truth.\nAnd I don\u2019t know, maybe I camouflaged it a little bit, but I couldn\u2019t even talk about it, because I\nreally felt that burden for such -- for the rest of my life.",
        "Q: And you still feel it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: [have my brother and my father [indecipherable] deaths, and I feel I\u2019m responsible that they\naren\u2019t here any more.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t kill them.",
        "A: But it was the wrong thing to do. Was absolutely the wrong thing to do, cause he really didn\u2019t\nwant us to go with him. Of course, we didn\u2019t know that we were fairly close towards the end of\nthe war. We didn\u2019t get -- you know, that\u2019s been -- so many times there were hopeful news, that\noh, the allies are here, and there, and the Russians are very close, and -- and it never\nmaterialized. So we really didn\u2019t know. But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s done, you know, it\u2019s a long time. Ma -- ma\n-- as you get older and you have sons like I do, who are now -- my oldest son is the same age that\nmy father was when he was killed. You know, I mean, you -- you get from his history, he was a\nstrapping man, he was -- he could do anything, whether it was carpentry or -- or digging ditches,\nor what. Physical work -- not everybody was able to do that. People collapsed, people gave up\nbecause they couldn\u2019t do it. Well, he could. But we came to the point, and I think I had a part in\nit where you couldn\u2019t -- there\u2019s nothing you could do.",
        "Q: But you -- you probably need to remember that the family made a decision early on to join\nyou.",
        "A: I know, I know, I know, this --",
        "Q: So everybody\u2019s making decisions based on what they think is the best.",
        "A: I know, my husband talked to me.",
        "Q: But rationality doesn\u2019t count when you have certain kinds of feelings.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: So you are separated from your brother and your father, and --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: -- do you know that they were killed immediately? Is that what you think, or you don\u2019t know?",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you how I found out that they were killed. You know, we got off the train, and\nwe had to form in fives, and I remember trying to look back to see my father and my brother.\nThis was a huge, huge transport, enormous. All I could see is a sea of people. And then looking\ndown towards the camps, all I could see is high tension wires, and barrack after barrack after\nbarrack. And then we were pushed again to walk past this elegant looking SS officer with shiny\nboots and leather gloves, either pointing to the left, or to -- pointing to the right. I didn\u2019t -- I\ndidn\u2019t know what that meant. I followed where he pointed to. And then we had to form in fives\nagain, and there was an SS man to the left of me, and he pushed us into this muddy road, which\nwas snaking between camps. And whenever a transport arrived in Auschwitz, nobody was\nallowed to get out of the barrack. But somehow a woman was outside of the barrack, very close\nto the electric wire, and recognized somebody in our transport, and screamed out a name, and\ncried. And this SS man, who was next to me, fairly young, maybe 18, something like that, with\nhis rifle drawn, screamed at her, \u201cGet in or PII shoot you.\u201d And with that he shot her. And she\nscreamed, and she was lying there, literally in the mud, pooled in her own blood, and I was\nconvinced then I would never get out of there alive.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s the first time you thought that?",
        "A: Ihave ne -- had never seen a person being shot. There were people being killed in Terezin in\nthe Kleine Festung, but I was not witness to it. And apparently there were some people shot in\nthe basin when we had the counting, but I didn\u2019t -- nobody close to me. That was the first time I\never saw a person being shot point blank. And that is something I will never erase out of my\nmind. And I think this is when I decided, not consciously, to just not even see what was going on\naround me. And then we were, as you know, we\u2019re put into a s -- brought into a sauna and\nstripped of everything. Our hair was shorn, our body hair was shorn and w-we were screamed at.\nI never forget that sauna for the rest of my life. It was a very large room, it was a brick building,\nand there were SS lined -- male SS lined on both sides of the walls, making dirty jokes. You\nknow, we were all naked while we were being shaved. And that is too much for anybody to even\nthink reasonably. I mean --",
        "Q: Prisoners shaved you, yes?",
        "A: Prisoners shaved us.",
        "Q: Did they talk to you at all?",
        "A: No, they were too busy. And -- and they couldn\u2019t even tattoo us any more because by that\ntime they -- they couldn\u2019t -- they had so many transports coming in, they weren\u2019t tattooing any\nmore. They did these idiotic things. They gave us dirty dresses, no underwear, no socks, just\nwooden clogs and a dirty dress, and this is the -- Poland, the winter, in October. And then we had\nto get past another prisoner who had a -- a can of red paint, and put a stripe of glossy red paint on\nthis black, lousy rags that I had on. I mean, really idiotic things. And then they pushed that into\nthe muddy road again, it was still raining, and that\u2019s when we ended up in Birkenau in one of the\n-- the barracks. And they couldn\u2019t cope with all the people they had. Buschi claims we were\neight on a cot, Zdena says we were seven on a cot. It doesn\u2019t matter. We could -- nobody could\nturn without everybody else turning. And we never saw utensils. We -- there was one dirty\nblanket to cover all of us, and it was so filthy it was horrible. And then the next morning, people\ncame in to -- or the next day some time, they brought in some soup, some -- you know, in -- in a\nbig canister, and they dished it out into metal dishes, and each plank bed got one metal dish, and\nwe had to use our hands to eat, and it was quite liquid, that stuff. And whoever could shovel it\nthe faster -- in the fastest got the most. But I don\u2019t remember whether it was the same day, I think\nit was the following day, that there were a few people who threw themselves against the electric\nwire. And men came in to pick up the dead, and -- with pushcarts. And one of the men was a\nfriend of mine, and he knew my father, too, he was in our transport. And he -- his wife was also\nin my camp, and he whispered to his wife, \u201cTell Uschi that Walter and Otto didn\u2019t make it.\u201d And\nshe told me that. And from that day on, I never had any hope that my father or my brother had\nsurvived. And then, years later, the Holocaust museum, my brother and my father\u2019s names are\nright there. The wonderful Nazi records --",
        "Q: Of who they killed.",
        "A: Of -- they were killed that same day.",
        "Q: That same day?",
        "A: That same day.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s stop the tape and we\u2019ll change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection of the uprising at the end of October?",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "Q: No. You didn\u2019t hear anything?",
        "A: You mean in Auschwitz?",
        "Q: In ow -- I\u2019m sorry, in Auschwitz.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. I think I was too occupied with myself. I was too new in -- in Auschwitz. I didn\u2019t\nknow people well enough. The only thing that is really imprinted on my memory is this incident,\nI don\u2019t know if -- if you read it in my book, when we had selection and the Hungarian girl fled\ninto our barrack. I don\u2019t -- and I also learned from other prisoners, and I really didn\u2019t believe it,\nthat they were doing experiments on people, and I didn\u2019t believe that either. I just -- I mean, I\njust could not comprehend some of the things that I heard.",
        "Q: So, did you not believe they were gassing people?",
        "A: No, that I believed.",
        "Q: You believed it.",
        "A: I believed that, and I -- and I know that my friends from Terezin, the Hirschfeld\u2019s wouldn\u2019t\nhave told me that my father and my brother didn\u2019t make it into the camp, that was right after I\narrived. And I learned from others in the camp that people were being gassed, and that -- that this\n-- there was a horrible smell in Auschwitz, too.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you.",
        "A: But I think I experienced that more when I was selected for work. Well, before I was selected\nfor work, we had this horrendous experience with the Hungarians girls. They were fairly young\ngirls, and there was as -- some of these people who had been in Auschwitz for any length of\ntime, they didn\u2019t look like human beings any more. They\u2019re called the musselmen, a -- I don\u2019t\nknow where the heck that came from, but they were really walking skeletons. And their skin, and\nthe expressions on their faces, and their eyes, th -- cannot be described. And next to our barrack\nwas a barrack that housed Hungarian women. A lot of young women, who had been there a\nrelatively long time for Auschwitz, you know, a number of months, and they have been through I\nthink what -- two selections before, so there were no older people left in that barrack, they were\nall younger pl -- people. But they were coming closer di -- to the description of these musselmen.\nThey were in terrible shape. And they had a selektion, and of course, I did -- never heard of a\nselektion, we had only been in these barracks for a relatively short time, and they were shooting,\nand we thought this 1s it, they\u2019re going to just shoot everybody around. And then one of the girls\nmanaged to get into our barrack. And apparently another girl was killed, was shot by the SS, but\nour elder, our block elder knew this girl, and they had been in Auschwitz for a long time, and\napparently she has -- had escaped selektions a number of times. And here we were fairly new,\nand all this was -- we were being told all these horrors that I couldn\u2019t digest. And here, I will\nnever forget this girl, she\u2019s standing there at the end of the barrack, and the block elder, who\nseemed like a pretty brutal woman herself, was shielding her. And she told us that she\u2019d been\nthere for such and such a time, she\u2019d been selected a few times, and that people were being\nselected after they were not physically strong any more, and they were being gassed. And she\ngave such a vivid description and she told us about how many of her friends had been -- had\nbeen gassed, that it finally dawned on me, ma -- maybe this is true. Maybe this is so. It wasn\u2019t\njust when you come there that they select you like Mengele, but they select you afterwards. Now\nthat was -- that wa -- made a terrible impression on me. And then shortly after that, we had a\nselektion for work. And it was a fairly large table outside, and it was pretty cold, and we had to\nall strip naked again, and walk in front of this table. And there was a man, a representative from\nindustry at one end, and two SS officers at that table. And he selected very few people. And we\nwere kind of standing in line, naked. And when I got to this man from industry, he asked me to\nshow him my hands, which I did. I -- I don\u2019t have a very small, fancy hand. And then h-he\nmotioned obviously that he was going to take me for work at the factory he represented. And the\npeople selected for work, as I said before, were a relatively small number. And we were then\npushed into the road again, and you know, we had -- we could put a -- we only had a dress\nanyway, put our dress on, was pushed into the road. And we were put into a s -- we were in front\nof another sauna, a bath house, and by that time, I believe that people were being gassed, because\nwe could smell the burning flesh, really. And when the SS guard told us that we had to strip\nnaked before we even got into the shower house, the sauna, I really thought that was it, because I\nalso had learned that people were gassed in a sauna, that the gas came through the shower heads.\nSo it was welcome when we felt the ice cold water dripping on our skin. And we again just got a\nshift, and no underwear, no socks. And we were pushed into the road and we ended up in a\nwomen\u2019s camp, which had mostly non-Jews in it. I believe they were all Polish, at least the ones\nI saw. The elder was a Pole. And they had different insignias, which I learned there designated\nwhether they were political prisoners or murderers. And I understood from people there that the\nblock elder was a murderer, that this particular triangle or whatever she wore, represented the\nidentification of a murderess. And she was very brutal, and horrible, and she beat people very\nreadily. And she s -- put -- she gave us different chores to do, and one of the chores that she\ndished out for me, was to carry the feces to the latrines during the night, with another woman,\nand accompanied by a Nazi guard. You know, the women were not SS, they were Nazi guards in\nuniform. And I shall never forget that night. It was a very dark night, and there was a horrible\nsmell, and the whole sky was bright red. And these very tall chimneys were spewing particles\ninto the air. And the woman who carried the buckets with me, who had been in Auschwitz a lot\nlonger than I had, she said, \u201cAnother transport must have arrived. These are our people going\nthrough the chimney.\u201d You know, a normal person would have collapsed right there and there,\nand I don\u2019t think things really penetrated. We had much better bedding and plank beds. They\nwere the same size, but instead of, you know, eight people, or whatever, or seven or whatever we\nwere on one, there were three of us. One was Zdena from Prague, and one was Buschi from\nAmsterdam. And we became friends for life. And one day we were told to get ready for work\nand we were marched to the railroad trestle, and we were put into a transport. And I cannot recall\nhow long we were on transport, but then the trains stopped eventually -- because we were in\ncattle cars, and there was really no way -- you know, some cattle cars were older, and they were -\n- you -- you had an idea, looking through some of the little spaces, but there weren\u2019t too many\nspaces to be found. And we ended up in a place called Kudowa-Sackisch. In other words, we had\nbeen going west, not east. This was an airplane factory, and the man who had selected me\nworked -- was a representative of that airplane factory. And I never forget that night. We were so\nhappy. The beds were better, the blankets were wonderful, the food was better. And, for the first\ntime, we had shower, a hot shower, and we got a piece of soap. And then the next morning we\nhad to form a circle in the factory yard, and the German foreman stepped into the middle of that\ncircle, and he looked around, and he decided he didn\u2019t like anybody to work for him in the\nfactory who wore eyeglasses. I wore glasses and Zdena wore glasses, Buschi did not. And he --\nwe stepped forward. At first I didn\u2019t want to step forward. And Buschi said to me, \u201cHaven\u2019t we\nplayed enough fate?\u201d You know, and she was referring to my volunteering to go with my father,\nand my father and my brother going with me, and I put my glasses back on. And of course he\nselected me to step forward, and Zdena step forward. And then for some reason, he told Buschi\nto step forward. And you know, either Zdena or I said to her, \u201cBut you don\u2019t wear glasses.\u201d So, I\nnever forget Buschi\u2019s words. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s fate. It\u2019s supposed to be that way.\u201d \u201cDas ist das\nSchicksal. Es soll so sein.\u201d And there were six of us, and he called us garbage, rejects, who were\nnot going to work in his factory, and we were going to be sent back to Auschwitz. And we were\nrounded up by a woman, a Nazi guard, but she was different from any of the guards that we had\nencountered. She didn\u2019t scream at us, she was kind of nice, she ki -- she somehow behaved as if\nshe didn\u2019t belong there. Now, I don\u2019t know what her history was, whether she wad -- was drafted\ninto that, who knows? But she -- she took us to the railroad trestle, and then I did something I felt\nterrible about for a long, long time. And Buschi and Hannah and Zdena were very upset with me,\nbecause they felt very strongly that I had saved their lives. It wasn\u2019t just -- there was one other\nwoman. There were two other women who felt the same way, but we kind of lost contact after\nliberation. And I pleaded with this guard, and I told you she seemed more accessible, because I\nwould have never dreamt to do this in Auschwitz with any guard. And I pleaded for my life, and\nI told her that I shouldn\u2019t be there. I was really not Jewish. My mother was a Christian and I -- I\nshouldn\u2019t be here. And she answered in a way like somebody would who really felt badly about\nit. And she said, \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d \u201cKann nicht sta fur mat -- kann nicht\ndaran tun.\u201d And then she left us, asked us to -- first she asked us to stay together, there were six,\nwe didn\u2019t know the others. And she was flirting with two German soldiers who were\naccompanying the train. In the meantime we realized that there was one other German woman,\nshe had lived in Prague. We never got too close with her, she was much older than most of us.\nAnd there was another Czech woman, Hanka, she was a communist, through and through. And I\ncan say that I never felt a relationship with Hanka. I mean, we all helped each other, but it wasn\u2019t\nthe same relationship I felt with Buschi and Hannah and Zdena. And there was one woman,\nHannah, and we three became very close friends. And then one of the soldiers came to us. In the\nmeantime -- I must say this first, there were hundreds of inmates on the railroad trestle. They\nwere Hungarian workers who had worked in the factory, and who -- they had worked these\nwomen practically to death. They could hardly stand, they had open sores, impetigo, whatever it\nwas, they were in horrible shape. And they had been pushed by the SS into cattle cars until the\ncattle cars were full to the brim, and then they locked the cattle cars. And our guard had stayed\nwith us in the meantime, and then had gone over to the soldiers, and the SS had left. Because I\nthink that we were the responsibility of that Nazi guard. And then one of the soldiers came over\nand told us to follow him and he put us into the last cattle car. And we were the only six in this\nhuge cattle car, and then he locked the cattle car. And I have no idea any more, and I\u2019m not sure\neven would have had an idea when we came -- when we finally ended up in Merzdorf, how long\nwe had been in the cattle car. But the soldiers finally opened the door and joined us 1n the cattle\ncar. One was relatively young, and you know, the -- Hannah thinks this guy was this old, I don\u2019t\nremember. And the younger of the soldiers cried, and he told his buddy that if his people did that\nto human beings, he didn\u2019t want to live any more. And they gave us bread, they gave us cheese,\nthey gave us privacy. I mean, we hadn\u2019t seen white bread for years, and cheese. And they gave\nus privacy to use a bucket. And we sat in this huge cattle car in one corner, and deciding what are\nwe going to do when we return to Auschwitz. And the only language that Hannah, Zdena, and\nthe -- and the other Czech girl, and I and the -- the -- the German girl we didn\u2019t have too much\nclose relationship with, spoke, was German, because they were all educated people, and this --\nmost of the Czechs spoke German, and of course the Dutch do. And Buschi\u2019s family originally\ncame from Germany anyway, so I don\u2019t remember whether she had some German grandparents\nor what. And Buschi and I decided that we were going to throw each -- ourselves against the\nelectric wire instead of being gassed. And the German soldiers heard that, you know, we spoke\ntheir language. And the train came to a standstill. I have no idea what they did while we were in\nthe cattle car before the train left Auschwitz -- left the labor camp that we had been in before.\nThey must have spoken to the engineer of the train. They must have coordinated it somehow. But\non the other hand, you have to realize that this was the very beginning of 1945, and things\nweren\u2019t looking too great for the Germans. So they told us to jump out of the cattle car and\nfollow them. And when we got onto the platform, we realized it said Merzdorf, it did not say\nAuschwitz. And we followed them through the small village of Merzdorf. It\u2019s a very\nmountainous region. It\u2019s a beautiful region. It was very cold. It was probably the very beginning\nof January, with snow and ice on the road. And here are these decrepit looking women, with a\nthin shift, and wooden clogs, no hair, following uniformed German soldiers through the village\nof Merzdorf. And the villagers were coming out of their doors look -- staring after us. And we\nwent through a big gate, into a work camp. It said, \u201cKamsta, Mettner and Frahne,\u201d it was a\nfactory. They made linens there, which we later found out, from the original raw material of flax.\nAnd they told us to wait, and then they went to see the commander of the camp, who was a\nwoman. The most vulgar looking woman I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, Anna Rinke. She might only\nhave weighed 300 pounds, I remember her weighing 400 pounds. She was tall and big. She was\nbursting out of her Nazi uniform. And she stood in front of these soldiers, quite a ways from us.\nWe were on one side of this very big area, within the factory buildings -- yard, and -- and they\nhad to get into her place on the other side. And all I remember her coming out and screaming at\nthem, \u201cI don\u2019t want them here, get them out of here, send them back to Auschwitz. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nAnd they stood in front of her, they gave the Nazi salute, they clicked their heels, they left us\nthere, they never looked back. So, with all my hatred for Germans, we owe our lives to these\nsoldiers. And not a letter or a telephone call for many years, whether it was from Hannah, or\nZdena, or Buschi, without questioning if we only would know the names or where these people\nare, they saved our lives, I\u2019m sure at a considerable risk to themselves. But again, they probably\ncouldn\u2019t have taken that risk 1f we would have come there much earlier than we did.",
        "Q: So she let you in?",
        "A: She had no choice.",
        "Q: She had no choice because you were standing there.",
        "A: The train was gone, we had no choice, I guess.",
        "Q: I want to ask you two sort of si -- simple questions.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Ho -- how did you know it was Mengele in Auschwitz?",
        "A: I was told that in the camp by some of the people who had been in the camp longer than we\nwere, and especially by the Hungarian girl. And they described him to me, and I remember him.\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t have recognized his features. I don\u2019t think I would have had the guts to look\nin his face.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I only later learned that there were other physicians or SS who were selecting. But I was\ntold, and I took this, that they knew what they were talking about, that these transports were\nselected by Mengele. And I was told then, for the first time, that -- by is -- people, you know, in\nthe camp, who had been in Auschwitz much longer, that they were doing experiments on people,\nwhich also didn\u2019t penetrate my he -- my brain. I mean, I -- I didn\u2019t know what they were talking\nabout.",
        "Q: The other question is, how in heaven\u2019s name were you able to keep your glasses?",
        "A: Well, that I don\u2019t know. You tell me.",
        "Q: Well, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I had a pair of glasses, they had a pearl matte frame, and I had them when I left\nDisseldorf. I was very careful with my glasses because my vision was very poor since my birth.\nAnd I can\u2019t comprehend it, because here I\u2019m in this country with wonderful technology, and it\nwasn\u2019t too long ago, with a different pair of glasses than these that I was accompanying a friend\nto the hospital and the lens fell out on the floor. And these glasses lasted. I think they were\nthicker glasses in those days, the frames were thicker, I don\u2019t know. I was very careful with them\nbecause they were part of my life. I can\u2019t see without glasses. When I was in Terezin, I had a\nspecial place for them on my bunkbed, and the girls would never go into my bunkbed, that was\nmy bunkbed. When I was in Auschwitz, I didn\u2019t take them off at all, ever. When I came into the\nnext camp, where I\u2019ve met Buschi and Zdena, I also kept them on the bunkbed, or on my nose.\nAnd the same in Merzdorf. And believe me, I was really frightened that something could happen\nto them. But I wasn\u2019t beaten up ever, which would have caused them to be thrown on the floor,\nso they somehow survived.",
        "Q: I was actually more curious in Auschwitz, even though you weren\u2019t tattooed, you were\nshaved, and you went through the sauna.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So did you hold them in your hand? Did you hide them from people?",
        "A: That I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Because they took things away from everybody.",
        "A: Yeah, but they --",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t touch you?",
        "A: I -- I kept my glasses.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: They must have been on my nose, because if I had them -- I don\u2019t recall putting them in my --\nbut the same thing with Zdena. Zdena came from the sa -- it was a ta -- same transport as I, and\nZdena wore glasses, and they didn\u2019t take her glasses either. They took the glasses, of course, of\npeople who were gassed. So, whether they took glasses routinely of people they were sending to\nwork, would it make sense to take glasses away from people you want to work -- for -- who --\nwho have to work for you? I don\u2019t know. But of our six, Zdena and I were the only ones who\nwore glasses, I think. Hannah doesn\u2019t wear glasses. So while the others were -- he probably\ndidn\u2019t like them. One of them was pretty short. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s, you know -- I\nhave --",
        "Q: It\u2019s a mystery.",
        "A: It\u2019s a mystery. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s an absolute mystery.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: No, I have no clue. And I was very -- I was very much aware of the necessity of guarding my\nglasses, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, we have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Eight\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "Q: Ursula, Ill go back to Ursula.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Your friends, Hannah, Buschi, Hanka, Zdena --",
        "A: Zdena.",
        "Q: Zdena.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Sorry. And Hilde.",
        "A: Well, Hilde is Buschi.",
        "Q: Hilde is Buschi. Oh, okay.",
        "A: Right, that was her nickname.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you meet in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yes, we met in that women\u2019s camp, which was mostly all -- not all of them, only Buschi and -\n- and Zdena and I, and then we met the other ones when we were round -- when we were\nrounded up in Kudowa, and we were rejects.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Yes.",
        "A: But only -- only Zdena and -- and Buschi and I met in Auschwitz. And Hannah and -- and the\nothers two, we met when we are all rejected.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what was it about all of you that you think brought you together and allowed you to be so\ngood for each other? Do you have any idea?",
        "A: Well, I think that Hanka, who -- just to differentiate her from Hannah, she was Czech, and sh\n-- I\u2019m sure she was a communist. I mean, we all knew she was a communist. I -- I had nothing to\ndo with her -- with her communism, but her whole manner and all this, I\u2019m not sure that if it\nwould just -- just been Hanka, that we would have become very good friends, okay? But we were\nthe six who were selected to be sent back to Auschwitz. And so we really stuck together. My\nclosest friends were Buschi and Zdena and Hannah.",
        "Q: So ha --",
        "A: And the other two, Hanka and I forget the other name, the -- the other German woman, she\nhad lived in Prague for awhile, she was considerably older, and I was the youngest of the whole\ngroup. They called me das Kind. And Hannah, when they used to call home, and Hans would\ntalk to -- they would never talk to each other that how is Uschi, [indecipherable] macht das Kind,\nyou know. The Czechs speak some German too, but the -- my husband very seldom spoke\nGerman, but it was always when they referred to me as th -- some Kind, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And -- and Hannah is still kidding about it, yeah.",
        "Q: So this was -- this became another family for you.",
        "A: It became a family. Zdena and Buschi and I worked outdoors in transport, and the other girls\nworked in the factory and I don\u2019t think that we three could have survived without the girls in the\nfactory, because they stole flax and -- and yarn, and we made warmers to put in our wooden\nclogs, on our head, and chest warmers, and I think that was a horrible winter in those mountains,\nand I don\u2019t think we could have survived. We supported each other constantly. We more often\nfound something in the garbage at the railroad station because we had to unload coal cars, and\nflax cars, than they did. They had no way to get anything. And anything we found we would\ncarry back to the camp and divide it between the six of us, we would never eat it alone. If\nsomebody was sick, we supported them. We -- it was taking your life into your own hands if you\n-- if you even went to the so-called doctor, who happened to be a -- a dentist. There were no\nmedicines anyway, and I never was sick except for one day when I\u2019m sure I had a fever and I\nwas ready to topple over, and Sunday were wonderful days in Merzdorf for Anna Rinke, she\nwould torture us standing for hours and hours. It was very cold, and I was ready to pass out. And\nboth Zdena and Buschi were much taller than I was, especially Zdena was very tall. And sh --\nZdena stood in front, and Buschi in back and they literally supported me. Because to -- to -- in\nthose -- at that time still, if you told them you were sick, I mean, there was always a danger they\ncould transport you back to an extermination camp.",
        "Q: Did -- could you notice, or did you notice that other women in the camp were doing\nsomething similar, or was -- were -- the working of your group was unusual?",
        "A: No, it was unique.",
        "Q: It was unique.",
        "A: I think we were unique, and then we were the last ones to arrive in Merzdorf, and there was a\nlarge cons -- contingent of Hungarian women there, who were constantly fighting which 1s --\nwhich -- with each other, or cooking together, you know, imaginary cooking. And they were --\nthere was -- there were a few Germans -- German Jews, but the rest of them were all Poles,\nPolish Jews. And they didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with us, especially the Polish Jews,\nwho had been there much longer than any one of us, so any new person who arrived was just --\nthey probably felt depriving them of food and so -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very hard to understand,\nwe were all Jews, but we -- we were not supportive of each other. I hate to say this, but that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s the way it was.",
        "Q: So you saw a lot of conflict?",
        "A: I saw conflict, and I didn\u2019t -- I did not see a group that stuck together the way we did. And\nsome of the Polish Jews who had been there for a much longer time, some of them had better\npositions, some of them worked in th -- in the kitchens, and they knew each other, and they\nwould give food to -- to others, you know, who came from similar background. But relatively\nspeaking, we were not in aush -- 1-in Merzdorf that long. From January to liberation, which\nseemed like a lifetime, but without that friendship, you know -- and I was very lucky that I was\nasked to spread salt, rock salt on the scales. The s -- some of the stuff coming in had to be\nweighed, and the scales were all frozen, they weren\u2019t working, so I was given the job of\nspreading rock salt. So I reasoned, if cattle can eat rock salt, why can\u2019t we? And the camp had\nrun out of salt for months. And that is very weakening whe -- when you have to work. So I\nstuffed my pockets full of rock salt, and the six of us lived off that rock salt until liberation. And\nwe -- we dug up horse -- we f -- I found -- I don\u2019t know if I found, or Buschi, or one of us found\na horseradish patch, which we dug up. And I think the Nazi guard probably realized we were\ndoing it. And it was coming towards the end of the war, and one of the worst guards ever, we\ncalled her Pigface -- and I knew there was hope one day when I was coming up the stairs onto\nour dormitory and the SS were a fl -- a flight above, and she was coming down the stairs,\nPigface. She looked like a pig. She was very brutal and horrible, and she had this porcelain dish,\nwhich had sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, that\u2019s all I remember, there might have been\nsomething else on it. She shoved that onto me, and she said, \u201cFriss.\u201d\u2019 Now friss is -- is a word that\nis not used for human beings, that shows you what she thought of us. You only talk frisson about\npigs, about animals. There is a big distinction in the German language. So I was on the level of\nan animal, but at least something was in the wind. Pigface was giving me her dish with food, and\nI was delighted, and I carried it up to the dorm, and of course we all shared it. And we thought\nthis was a good omen.",
        "Q: What was your physical condition? Had you deteriorated a great deal, or --",
        "A: I was very, very thin, but I think I was relatively healthy. I -- I th -- I think -- I know that\nBuschi and Zdena and I were healthier than the other three girls, and -- and I believe that it was\nthe fresh air, and the physical work, even though we got very little to eat, I mean, watery soup.\nBut we did find some discarded carrots in the garbage, and we found some turnips in the\ngarbage, and we ate grass. So that somehow -- actually, I was stronger, and Buschi too, even\nthough she was quite a bit older than I was, even than Zdena. Because after liberation, they all --\nw-we got these six bikes from the Russian officer, and we were all going to bike to Prague, and\nthe girls couldn\u2019t do it. Only Buschi and I. Even Zdena got weak, but Buschi and I were able to\ndo it.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s pretty far.",
        "A: Well, we separated in -- at the border, because Hannah suffered a heart attack, and we had to\nleave her at the hospital. So that we decided, Buschi and I, that our plan was to go with a -- our\nCzech girls to Prague, and then take t -- public transportation. But a Russian officer told us there\nwas no transportation, nothing, and his advice is everybody should go back to the country that\nthey came from, to their home. Well we had no home, we told him. Well, he said, \u201cWell, you\nhave to go back to the country you came from and then try to get out of Europe.\u201d And si -- that\u2019s\nwhat we -- we did. We separd -- separated at the Czech border, when the girls had to go south to\nPrague and we went on, destination Lippborg, which was the designation of a little village my\naunt lived in, and my parents had said, \u201cIf you get separated, we meet at Aunt Minchen\u2019s house.\u201d",
        "Q: Now, let me just go back a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day when you\u2019re free?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: We were fr -- we -- we heard a lot of commotion the night before of valises being dragged a-\naround and -- and there were trucks outside on the -- on the ground -- the factory grounds. And\nwe were, you know, we were not allowed to open windows, everything was closed, the windows\nwere locked, and some of the Hungarians were imagining we were all going to be gassed in\nthere. This is why they locked all the doors and everything. They were came -- became very\nhysterical. And then it was the next morning, after our -- the SS and the guards, everybody had\nfled, that the door was opened by a German soldier, who appeared all alone, and said, \u201cMeine\nDamen, sie sind frei.\u201d \u201cMy ladies, you are free.\u201d We looked at each other, we\u2019re looking for the\nladies. And we couldn\u2019t believe it. And we -- of course, we didn\u2019t believe him. And he was a\nGerman, how could we believe him? And it was Maurice and his -- his Belgian friend, and also\nprisoner, who we had befriended, especially I had befriended Maurice very much, and he had\npromised me he would take me through the meadows, who literally had to drag us out of there.\nAnd to --",
        "Q: Maurice was another prisoner?",
        "A: He was a French prisoner, a prisoner of war. These were two prisoners of war. There were\nmore than two, but these were the two that we ha -- occasionally came in contact with, who kept\nour spirits up, and -- and that wonderful advice. If -- everybody was afraid they were going to put\nus on a forced march, and don\u2019t go on a forced march. I never even thought of a forced march till\nMaurice kept saying this. And I said, \u201cWell, how can we refuse it if it\u2019s going to be enforced\nwith machine guns?\u201d Well try everything, you know. But he said that\u2019s going to be the death of\nyou because it was, you know, pretty horrible weather. So --",
        "Q: Fortunately you didn\u2019t go.",
        "A: Yeah, we didn\u2019t. Fortunately they decided to -- to flee.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I think the Russians were coming in too fast, because the -- the German soldier opened the\ndoor, and the -- I think the Russians were coming in the afternoon. And the first Russian soldier\nwas on a bicycle, believe it or not. And he -- you know, he was just trying to find out what was\ngoing on, and -- and he later identified himself as Jewish. But a lot of these Russian Jews, they\nweren\u2019t very Jewish, you know, they -- but he said he was really born a Jew, too.",
        "Q: So you went back to Lippborg to find your mother, and the other relatives, yes?",
        "A: Right. Yes, Buschi and I -- the bicycle that -- bicycles that were given to us, we -- by the\nRussian officer, we -- we avoided the main roads, and we found a German s -- a dead German\nsoldier. Buschi found him. We usually picnic at the side of the road, secondary roads only,\nbecause we were warned not to take the main roads. And he had a map in his -- in his pocket,\nand that map got us all the way to -- I mean, got Buschi to Holland.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we followed that map. Had swastikas on it, but it follow -- it -- it really helped. It\nreally helped. It was a very, very good map. And we -- we sh -- sought shelter, and we stayed\nwith people, and I must say, in the Russian -- what is now the Russian -- what used to be the\nRussian zone, East Germany, people were much nicer to us. I think they were scared to death.\nMost of them had fled, and they were scared to death of the Russians. But there was one place\nover the Mulde River where we had to cross, that was a separation line, the demarcation line of\nthe Russian and the American forces, and the Russians let us go over. Half the bridge was\nRussian, half American, the we -- Americans wouldn\u2019t let us cross. And we pleaded, and we\ncame back, and came back, and I think it was two or three days later, Buschi finally persuaded\nthem -- we -- we both spoke English, but Buschi\u2019s English was better than mine at that time. And\nthey told us to come back the next morning, and if they are busy on the field telephone, we\u2019d\nbetter follow their instructions. Well, we got to them exactly when they said we should be there,\nand they were busy on the field telephone, and they said, \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d And we sure\ndid get the hell out of there. We -- we bicycled like the devil was after us, and we were in the\nAmerican zone. And then we -- I\u2019Il never forget Dresden, never. I mean, the lamp posts were like\nstraws, and the -- everything was in -- in horrible condition. I mean, the pictures that my husband\ntook of Kassel -- and of Kassel too, we came through Kassel, is exactly what we saw. And we\njust had one goal, I mean, to get to Lippborg, and for Buschi to get to Holland. And I won\u2019t go\ninto any detail, you don\u2019t have the time, but you know, in my book I go into all these details, and\nif you want any other details, you can ask me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I remember going over the river in Kassel, the Mulde, and I really thought we wouldn\u2019t\nmake it. I mean, the bridge was so bad, it was so bombed out it was just horrendous, but we\nmade it. And eventually, I mean after bicycling for almost a month, and one incident was we\nwere almost overtaken by Russian soldiers who -- who thought girls were a nice catch at that\ntime, and the Russian officer saved us there. But when we came close to -- to Lippborg, which is\nfrom where we started out from, about 500 miles by bicycle, in our condition. We -- there is only\none street in that village, called Dorfstrasse. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s pretty hilly, and we were pushing our\nbikes up Dorfstrasse, cobblestones Dorfstrasse. And it has a very narrow sidewalk, and I saw a\nwoman who was carrying a big load of wash. She had gray hair and I recognized that woman,\neven though I\u2019d remembered her with jet black hair, it was my mother. And she recognized me\ntoo. But she came over, and she just barely embraced me, she just her hand on me, but she was\nlooking back. She was expecting some others to follow me. She was looking for my father and\nmy brother. And before she said anything else, she said, \u201cPapi,\u201d which we called my father, \u201cand\nBubchen are not coming back?\u201d And then she screamed. \u201cMy child is back.\u201d \u201cMein Kind 1s\nzuruck!\u201d And the villagers came out of their houses, and everybody asked, because we had\nvisited my aunt so many times as children, you know, where\u2019s your father and where\u2019s your\nbrother. And we stayed 1n lip -- I mean, Buschi stayed in Lippborg for I don\u2019t remember exactly,\nmaybe a couple of weeks, and my grandmother and my aunts, you know, they bro -- they -- first\nthey got everything going, hot water, and they didn\u2019t have, you know, automatic hot water, they\nhad big stoves and they were heating up the kettles, and -- and the big bathtub on the huge\nkitchen tile floor, and then Buschi and I were getting baths with -- they were scrubbing us, and\nmy grandmother was saying, \u201cWell you know, you still have to go over the neck, and they are\nstill filthy over here and there.\u201d And they discarded our clothes, they gave us new clothes, and\nthey nursed us back to health. And they persuaded Buschi to stay longer than he -- she had\nwanted to, and then Buschi had to go back to Amsterdam, she had to tell her in-laws that she, the\nJew survived, and that her husband, their only son, was killed by the Nazis. And Buschi and\nHannah stayed friends for -- and I, we stayed friends for life. And finally my mother and I were\nable to come to this country in 1947, and I shall never forget that -- the er -- S.S. Ernie Pyle\ntaking us into New York harbor, and that Statue of Liberty, and I think that most immigrants\nnever forget that picture, you know. They all think like I did, she\u2019s giving a special welcome to\nus. So, it would have been nice if we could have come here in \u201948. We would have had -- our\nfamily would have been together, but that was not to be.",
        "Q: You mean 738.",
        "A: In *38, yes.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry. But that was not to be. And I love this country, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a wonderful country, and\nI met my husband here.",
        "Q: And you had two boys.",
        "A: And two boys.",
        "Q: And your mother remarried?",
        "A: Yeah, a wonderful stepfather, who I must say I liked, but I don\u2019t think I appreciated him as\nmuch as I should have. I think I missed my father so much that there was such a resentment that\nhe didn\u2019t survive. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, we had a very good relationship, but sometimes I\nfeel maybe I could have been more loving to him.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: The boys only knew one grandfather --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that was Siegmund, who could not have been more wonderful if they had been his own\ngrandchildren. And they loved their grandmother. So that\u2019s my story.",
        "Q: Well, there\u2019s obviously more to tell, but -- thank you so very much for coming.",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019re welcome, it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- 1t\u2019s a wonderful thing you are doing, and --\nand I\u2019m very appreciative.",
        "Q: Well, I know this was not easy to -- to do. The loss is very great.",
        "A: Well, yeah, I -- somehow, sometimes it\u2019s harder than others.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, I talk about it. \u2019'm not talking about it as much any more as I did. I can\u2019t write\nHans\u2019 story and keep going out and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and it\u2019s -- I do it at [indecipherable] Valley college. I think it\u2019s so important. We are busing\nin 3000 kids every year, and we can\u2019t -- we don\u2019t -- many, many more want to come, and it\u2019s a\nwonderful program. And we have speakers, and we have a discussion group with survivors, and\nrighteous and liberators. And I think it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a wonderful program, but I\u2019m not sure how much\nmore I will do going to individual schools. It -- it does take a lot out of me, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Right, right. Well, thank you very much, I\u2019m very grateful that you came.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. You\u2019re -- you\u2019ve been great, you\u2019re a wonderful interviewer.",
        "Q: You\u2019re very kind.",
        "A: And I have given very few interviews. I have given some after the book was published, to,\nyou know, television stations, etcetera, but you are unique, you\u2019re very, very wonderful. And the\natmosphere is just -- how can you top this?",

        "Q: And this shot?",
        "A: I believe that was taken (17) in either Diisseldorf or Munich, and it was after the war. I think\nit was 1946. I still had a pretty full face, but I think I was getting down to more normal\nproportions.",
        "Q: And who is this?",
        "A: This is my husband (18) Hans Pawel, and this is in 1948, when I met him. I only knew him\nsix weeks and we got married.",

He was a physician and he attended soldiers in the trenches\nof Verdun in World War I, and his country gave him the Medal of Honor for that, des Eiserne\nKreuz 1\u201c Klasse.

And I remember that department store, and I remember the --\nsome of the outbuildings that housed all kinds of boxes that we would play in, and play house in.\nAnd I also remember learning how to ride a bike. I was about seven years old, and one of the\njanitors taught me how to ride a bike. And I also remember when my father lost his job, and\nthere was a change. We had to move out of our apartment, which was above the department store\nin a -- it was a huge building, because in 1933, that concern was, in quote, Aryanized. So my\nfather really lost his job in 1933. And instead of leaving Germany, he bought a store just a few --\nmaybe a block up the road, and the owners of that store were a bit smarter. They went to South\nAfrica. And I don\u2019t remember this, but it was repeated in my family ca -- so many times, that Mr.\nRosenstein told my father that they\u2019re going to have signs on buses that Jews can\u2019t ride a bus.\nAnd everybody who was Jewish in that town thought this was hilarious.

So I really have no clue,\nall I know, that my grandparents who lived in Dusseldorf, there was -- there were no closets in\nhomes in Germany. There was a corner that had a curtain, and it was used like a -- like a closet,\nand there was a wooden leg in that corner.

And my mother had been a\nbuyer for a department store where she met my father, who was also a buyer. It was not a s -- it\nwas not Karstadt, 1t was another department store. She had been 1n training as a fairly young\nwoman. In those days people didn\u2019t go to college.

My father was really an\nagnostic, and my mother -- people actually, during the persecution, always thought my mother\nwas Jewish, and not my father.",
        "A: Yeah. And -- yeah, she was -- sh-she -- and actually her family was wonderful. My\ngrandparents loved my father, and this -- especially her two sisters, to the point during the Nazi\ntime where my mother\u2019s youngest sister, as they always accused her that she couldn\u2019t keep her\nmouth shut, she ended up in a work camp. So, it just gives you just an -- and actually, my -- my\nmother\u2019s parents were much more tolerant of that marriage than my father\u2019s parents. My Jewish\ngrandmother did not like the idea of a goyte coming into her house, and even though she\nconverted.",
        "A: She wa -- she still wasn\u2019t Jewish, and -- and -- and the ridiculous part is that my grandmother\nLenneberg, she was a total agnostic, she didn\u2019t keep any of the Jewish holidays, and they were\ntotally assimilated. But the idea that her son, her favorite son would marry a goyte, didn\u2019t quite\ngo down well. Then her oldest son, Erich, who was really like a black sheep in the family, not a\nvery good person, and who she didn\u2019t like, but he married later. He met a Catholic woman who\nwas a very good person, Erich was not. And she was a very strict Catholic, and she became\npregnant before they got married. And don\u2019t you know that my mother -- my grandmother\nLenneberg opened her arms to this Catholic woman, even though she got pregnant before they\ngot married. And totally ignored all what she believed before, when her younger son married\nLina Schneider.",
        "A: Ihave no explanation for this.",
        "A: Neither did my aunts, my Jewish aunts, who loved my mother. Maybe there was a\ncompetition.",
        "A: I -- [have no idea, I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, very close to both of them. My father was a very intelligent man, and he was a very calm\nperson, he was loved by everybody. My mother was much aggressive than my father. They had\ntwo different personalities. My mother always accused my father of being too decent, too good,\nwhether it was to employees, or it\u2019s to who -- whoever, and I think she was right. And she -- she\nalways felt that people were taking advantage of him. And my mother was much more\nageressive.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really know, he loved her, she could do anything. My father was totally in love with\nmy mother, as long as I can remember, and nobody could say anything bad about my mother, so",
        "A: I was very close. I was -- actually, when I was younger, I was closer to my father than to my\nmother. That doesn\u2019t take anything away from the relationship to my mother --",
        "A: -- but I was, you know, I was really close to my father. And some of it stemmed from the fact\nthat my father was quite athletic, and my mother was not, and Jupp Geschind, who was kind of a\njanitor at Karstadt, he taught me how to ride a bike. It was an adult bike, and my parents didn\u2019t\nknow about that, and I put my leg kind of through -- you know, how I managed it, I don\u2019t know.\nAnd then I eventually got a wonderful bike, and we went on bike trips, but always with my\nfather, and actually my cousin, my father\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter, who spent a lot of time in our\nhouse. My father tried to teach my mother how to bike, but it was always a disaster. And she\nscreamed once he was trying to kill her, so she always -- as long as she knew that he was holding\nonto the back of the bike it was fine. As soon as he let go, she would fall.",
        "A: Many more things as far as hiking and bicycle riding with my father.",
        "A: Yes, we -- we did, because lunch at that time in Germany was the main meal, and when we\nlived in Aplerbeck, children used to go home to eat, and my parents lived above the department\nstore, they had a maid, and they would go up and have their -- their lunch, their dinner, at lunch\ntime.",
        "A: And I would join them, both of us, my brother and I would join them.",
        "A: I think so. I don\u2019t remember. I loved him dearly afterwards.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember how I felt, you know. I know that I was crazy about him when he was\na little bit bigger, and not quite a tiny baby, but was toddling around, and I was very protective of\nhim.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Walter.",
        "A: And I\u2019ve always vowed I would never name a child after a relative who was killed or died,\nbecause my brother was named after the oldest son of my grandmother, who was killed in World\nWar I.",
        "A: I really am not, there is just something about --",
        "A: -- you know, I would not consider naming -- ya -- but Hans feels the same way, when I got\npregnant, that we would name either David or Bruce after his father, or -- or my father. Plus\nthere was something -- I didn\u2019t like German very much after I came out of the camps. Everything\nGerman was an antithesis to me. And so any -- I mean, names like Adolf, for goodness sakes, no\n-- which my grandfather was Adolf Lenneberg.",
        "A: And Otto was my father\u2019s name.",
        "A: Mm-hm",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We did. At -- at times we celebrated both Christmas -- we always celebrated Hanukah, and\nmy father used to call the Christmas tree the Hanukah bush. And that was really more done for\nour Christian relatives, who always came. Seder we went to Jewish friends. And I couldn\u2019t go to\na Seder after I came out of the camps for years and years and years, because this was a couple,\nthey had no children, and we always had Seder with them, and my brother used to ask the\nquestions.",
        "A: So I just couldn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- couldn\u2019t -- Seder -- Passover was a terrible time for me.",
        "A: All the ho -- Jewish holidays were.",
        "A: The memories, and I was much more -- I went through phases of being quite religious, and in\n1934, I went to a Jewish school in Dortmund because I could not attend public school in -- in\nAplerbeck any more. It was not a good school, and I wasn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t become a Zionist then, but\nthen eventually my parents decided to move to Dusseldorf, where my father was born. Also,\nAplerbeck was a small town, and very anti-Semitic. Many Nazis there. Boycotts in front of the\nstore, don\u2019t buy from the Jew, etcetera. And then my father did sell that store, but I can\u2019t\nremember exactly, I think it was about 1936, and Dusseldorf had a private Jewish school, a very\ngood school, and that was one of the reasons my father wanted to go to Dusseldorf, he was\nbrought up there, it was a much larger, more cosmopolitan city, and it had a good school system.\nAnd that\u2019s when I became an ardent Zionist, and very religious, to the chagrin of my parents.\nVery upset when my friends in Jewish school pretended to be fasting for Yom Kippur and were\nreally cheating. I -- and I -- I went through that stage. I ran around Jewish ho -- houses and\napartments, and collected for KKL for money for Israel to plant trees, etcetera. So you kind of\nget the picture.",
        "A: KKL? I don\u2019t remember what it stood for, but we call it KKL. There were blue boxes that had\na Magen da -- David -- David on it, and they would put coins in it, and that would be eventually\nsent what was then Palestine to make the desert bloom.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I li -- I never lived in Dortmund. I lived in Aplerbeck, which was a suburban town, but\nDortmund had much better hospitals, so the --",
        "A: -- obstetrician my mother went to was going -- was in Dortmund, there were better physicians\nin Dortmund, and I w -- the delivery took place in a hospital in Dortmund. So my birth certificate\nsays Dortmund, but I never really lived in Dortmund.",
        "A: And I did go to school -- to Jewish school in Dortmund, because I couldn\u2019t go to public\nschool in -- to any public school any more.",
        "A: After -- yeah, I think it was about 734.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was a grade school, and -- and talking about remembering, somehow I do remember I\nhad two very good friends. Now, I was about seven years old, and one was the daughter of the\nprincipal of a school, and one was a daughter of a local physician. And after the Nazis took over,\nand I don\u2019t recall exactly how soon, but within a relatively short time period -- we used to run to\neach other\u2019s houses and play, and I came to their house one day and they informed me, these two\ngirls, that they couldn\u2019t play with me any more because I was a Jew. Now that I remember,\nbecause it made such an impression on me, and I didn\u2019t make -- I -- I didn\u2019t understand it. And I\nthink I asked my parents, and I do not remember what their answer was, but somehow it was an\nexperience that I still remember, that all of a sudden I lost my friends. I couldn\u2019t play with these\ntwo girls. I still have pictures of these two girls with me, and I wouldn\u2019t have had those pictures,\nbut the non-Jewish relatives -- whatever I have, after I came back, was on account of my aunts,\nor I wouldn\u2019t have a thing.",
        "A: That I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I think they just said you can\u2019t come here any more, we -- yeah, they said you -- we can\u2019t play\nwith you any more because you are a Jew.",
        "A: In -- in do -- in Aplerbeck?",
        "A: I think there were a k -- there were a couple of Jewish kids, I don\u2019t remember them too well,\nbut a lot of the families I remember either had children who were older, or -- or the Kahns, like,\nhad no children, and they treated me like their own child. So I really don\u2019t have any deep\nimpression of friendship with a Jewish child in Aplerbeck.",
        "A: Now, that changed in Dusseldorf.",
        "A: But even the children at the Jewish school in Dortmund, they were -- they didn\u2019t make very\ndeep impressions on me.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, they were, they were. I think -- I think what helped me survive was the childhood I\nhad. I think if there is an ideal childhood, I had it. And my parents were very loving, and the\nmain thing is they were totally in love with each other, which I did not appreciate when I was a\nchild, but as time went on, and I remember their -- the way they acted with each other, and the\nway my father suffered when he was separated from my mother, and the same for my mother.",
        "A: First of all, my father was an extremely honest person. Morally caring, whether it was for his\nfamily, for the people who worked for him. And I think that made an impression on me, the way\nhe interacted with his not -- non-Jewish relatives, and his Jewish relatives. And his helpfulness.",
        "A: One doesn\u2019t appreciate it when one 1s eight, nine or 10 years old. And -- and the way he cared\nfor us in Terezin. There was only one theme, when this murderer is gone, and we get back with\nyour mommy, you know. And there was th -- he talked about my mother every day. So even\nthough we were separated, that was the f -- the foremost thing on his mind, was my mother.\nWhen we were in Terezin, and my -- my brother was Bar-mitzvah\u2019d in Terezin, and my father\nwas an agnostic. But there is something about agnostic Jews, and I don\u2019t know what it is. There\nis a Jewishness that -- that you -- you might be an agnostic, but there is something more than the\nreligion. And maybe it was also because we were in Terezin that the Bar-mitzvah of my brother\nmeant so much to us. It might -- might not have meant as much to us if we would have not had\nthe -- Hitler\u2019s ca -- catastrophe.",
        "A: Yeah, my mother was unusual in every way.",
        "A: You know, she was unusual in every way. Yes, when -- when my father accepted the job that\nwas offered to him by Karstadt to be in charge of this whole department store, and my mother\nwas made the chief buyer for women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing, there was no question that she\nwould continue doing that. My father just accepted that, or encouraged her. She had a maid, and\nher youngest sister came quite often to help out, and was the recipient of a lot of good deeds\nfrom my father. I think she was really in love with my father, too. So that\u2019s more or less the\natmosphere --",
        "A: -- I grew up in.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Grete, yeah.",
        "A: Grete yeah, she -- she was -- she worked for us until it became impossible, when the first\nNuremberg laws came out that Jewish men were accused after that of having affairs with non-\nJewish women, and ended up incarcerated. We didn\u2019t talk about concentration camps in those\ndays, but that was a great fear many Jewish men had, that they were accused of having sexual\nrelations with non-Jewish women, and especially a maid who was a live-in maid. So -- and I\nknow Grete, when she left, she cried like a child. But it was just too dangerous to have her there.",
        "A: I mean she -- she did join us in -- a few buildings down when my -- my father and my mother\nunfortunately bought that store, and -- Steinweg, but they v -- they had to let her go, they just\ncouldn\u2019t keep her.",
        "A: Yes. I missed her. She was -- she was part of the family.",
        "A: I mean, I grew up with her.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think they were well-to-do. They were not wealthy that they had enormous wealth inherited\nfrom their parents. I think they lived pretty high. They went on vacations, they had beautiful\nfurniture. Th -- I\u2019m sure they made enormous amounts of money, both of them together. They\nhad wonderful paintings, and especially at Karstadt, I mean, they had an enormous flat up there\nwith uncountable rooms, and Persian rugs, and it was very luxurious, which I didn\u2019t -- I mean, it\ndidn\u2019t strike me as luxurious, I was used to it, you know.",
        "A: Whereas my grandmother in Dortmund, my mother\u2019s mother and father, lived in a very nice\nhouse, in an apartment, a house that had maybe three stories. And it was comfortable, and was\nnice, but it wasn\u2019t nowhere as luxurious as my parents. I -- my father had a study with bookcases\nfull of books, and it was -- you know, it was a different world, yeah.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, which was actually almost like kindergarten, and I don\u2019t recall exactly when it was.",
        "A: My grandmother, my non -- my Christian grandmother came from Hessen, which is an\nagricultural area not too far from Kassel. And it was thought at the time that during vacation,\nsummer vacation, that was the healthiest place to send your children. So this was actually before\nthe Nazis came into power, I was sent to Grabenstein, which is a small village where my\ngrandmother was born, on summer vacation. And they had wonderful milk, raw milk, came right\nfrom the cows. Unpasteurized milk, they didn\u2019t use pasteurization there. And what 1s interesting\nis that my mother also spent her vacation in Grabenstein as a young girl, and she had a -- a\ncondition in her groin where her lymph gland had to be lanced, and then she had a condition in\nher -- on her neck, too. But it was never connected that this came from tuberculous cows. It\u2019s\ncalled scrofula, and I had a neck out like this, and it -- it was here, where I have a scar and it was\nin the front of my neck that -- these lymph glands were all pus-y, and I went through this for\nmore than a year. And my -- my mother was treated by a country physician who just lanced this\nwith a knife, and she had a beautiful, straight scar. And my parents took me to Berlin to a\nspecialist, who extracted the pus with a syringe, and consequently I am left with all this\ncalcifications in there. But I lost a year of school, at least.",
        "A: No, what I remember -- no, I wasn\u2019t in bed, what I remember is some horrible stuff, which I\nstill remember the name, believe it or not, antiflogestine, which was like a gook in a -- a little\ncan, that had to be heated very t -- very hot. It was -- and then it had to be applied to my glands.\nIt was like putting hot compresses on something. I hated that stuff. I mean, it burned, and it was -\n- and I screamed even before they could put it on my glands. So that\u2019s what I remember, but I\ndon\u2019t remember too much, and then one day it just seemed to -- to clear up, and it wa -- the\nglands were still draining a bit, and there was like a -- a band-aid on it, and then I went to school\nwith it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And I was tutored. I was --",
        "A: -- tutored at home.",
        "A: No, I was tutored, I was tutored from -- in Jewish school, Frau Buchheim, who was the wife\nof the principal of the school, and she would tutor me at my grandparents home in Dortmund.\nSee, I had to commute to Dortmund to the Jewish school. We lived in Aplerbeck, but I couldn\u2019t\ngo to public school any more.",
        "A: No -- in \u00b036 we moved to Dusseldorf.",
        "A: Yes, I do. I do remember it, because they were -- had this -- the black uniforms, and also gr --\nbrown uniforms, the either SS or the SR. And I remember them standing in front of our -- our\ndoor to -- to the -- the door to the -- the entrance to the store, and threatening people. And I also\nremember the atmosphere. My parents were very upset, so was Grete, our maid, and who saids\nall kinds of dirty words about them. And I picked all that up. It didn\u2019t make sense to me, but\nsomething changed, something happened. And I remember my parents talking about that no --\ncustomers weren\u2019t coming into the store because they were being threatened. They stood right in\nfront of -- of the entrance to the store, and any person who wanted to enter the store was\nintimidated by them. And then they used to -- they defaced the store windows with Jude, Jew.\nDon\u2019t buy from the Jew. So I remember that.",
        "A: And I remember them smashing windows, that I remember. In fact, I think I was in the store\none day when these thugs smashed one of the big st -- windows, and it c -- it just came crashing\ndown. And they did that to all the Jewish stores.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t -- you know, this -- all of a sudden -- there was a wonderful,\ntranquil life, which was changed somewhat because we moved from Karstadt to the Steinweg\nplace, but that didn\u2019t register to me why we did, or what, but then, this did register. And also\nthose two girls, I couldn\u2019t play with --",
        "A: -- the two girls any more. And they were at our house a lot. I mean, I have a lot of\nphotographs with them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I -- I really felt very deprived. My -- my mother\u2019s sisters were all so wonderful,\nand my grandmother. I mean, there\u2019s nobody like my mother\u2019s mother. And I just felt very\nsheltered with them. And then when I had to go to school in Dortmund, and I spent an awful lot\nof time with my mother\u2019s parents, because Frau Buchheim would come to my grandmother\u2019s\nhouse, and would tutor me at my grandmother\u2019s house, because it was in the same town. And I\nwould eat with them, and I would -- she would take me to the markets, and I -- Ij -- I just don\u2019t\nremember feeling deprived at all.",
        "A: That changed my life completely.",
        "A: Because I went to a school, a Jewish school, and somehow I made an awful lot of friends. I\nhad never been in a -- in a school that I felt so good about. I -- I made a lot of -- a lot of friends,\nand I went to their houses, they went to mine, and I was good in athletics, and they had a big\nathletic program, and I was good in jumping and si -- all kinds of things. And they had arts\nprograms, they did a lot of things. And even though the Nazis were persecuting the Jews, but\nsomehow there was still that feeling, well this guy isn\u2019t going to stay in power, and at -- and I felt\nsheltered. I was among people who were teaching me, and who were very -- were very\nwonderful. And we had one professor who later on I met in Los Angeles, Dr. Bergel, and he was\na professor of history, and they really had attracted terrific people in that school. And he had\ntraveled extensively in Africa, in Asia, and he told us all these wonderful stories, I remember\nthat. Yeah, that was a -- it was a good time until 1938, when our school was destroyed\ncompletely.",
        "A: Kristallnacht. Completely burned to the ground, our school, our synagogue, everything, yeah.",
        "A: No, see, my father used the money which he received from the people who bought that\nSteinwegs -- that second -- that store he bought. They were very decent family, a Catholic\nfamily, and they really paid him the market price.",
        "A: They did. And I would never -- my mother would never do anything to get any more money\nout of them, because she felt they were decent, which was very hard to find. Most of the\nGermans who bought Jewish stores were cheated, but my parents were not. And then he --\nmaybe he -- I would have been better off if -- they would have been better off if they had been\ncheated, because he took the -- the money from that store, when he came to Dusseldorf, he\nstarted a wholesale store not too far from the railroad station. Not in the best area of town, but\nthat\u2019s where the wholestale businesses were. And that flourished, everything he touched\nflourished.",
        "A: Oh yes, he -- he had a -- and a lot of these people were not really Nazis. And some of them\nturned Nazis, but they were -- you know, he had a -- also, he has a -- had a good rapport. Lot of\nthem were people who sold door to door, and some of them were Gypsies, who bought from him.\nAnd I wish he hadn\u2019t bought that store, but that\u2019s what he did. In the meantime they tried to\nemigrate. You know, they tried to leave Germany, but they had to make a living. I don\u2019t think\nmy parents had, you know, tremendous money reserves. They had lived pretty high, and all this\nmoving, and losing his job, and losing his -- his health insurance and stuff, and having to buy all\nthis on his own --",
        "A: -- \u2019'm sure that there was a cost.",
        "A: She tries to. She goes to Berlin to visit her old colleagues, who used to be -- who were buyers\nfor other department stores. And some of them had been working for manufacturers. But by that\ntime, everything was, in quote, Aryanized, and they weren\u2019t working for Jewish concerns any\nmore. And they treated her horribly. They didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with her. Whether\nthey were just horrible people, or whether they -- it was self-protection, because having\nconnections with Jews -- and my mother generally wasn\u2019t even known that she came from a --\nfrom a -- a non-Jewish family. Fr -- my mother was a Jew.",
        "A: To her colleagues.",
        "A: To everybody. And so, my mother coming back and trying to get -- make some connections\nto earn a living, di -- it was a failure. And she was very disheartened. And then she -- and I don\u2019t\nknow how she got to the Schreyecks, that I don\u2019t know. She might have told me, I don\u2019t\nremember that. She became a forelady in a leather belt factory which was owned by the\nSchreyeck family. And they were the most decent, wonderful people on this earth. And they\nprotected her, and I -- they s -- I-I don\u2019t want to jump ahead, I think Ill let you ask the questions,\nbut they were very vital later on in -- in protecting my mother when we were deported, and the\nsecret police, Herr Puetz, would not let my mother to go with us. So, they\u2019re wonder --",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think -- what had to do with him not wanting my mother to go with us was\nstrictly he hated her because he -- she got notification a few times, that I remember, to present\nherself at the office of Herr Puetz, he was the head of the Gestapo. And he belabored her to leave\nmy father. And she made it very clear she would never leave my father, she rather die. And he\nthen would not allow her to go with us -- we -- to the, in quote, labor camp. And she worked for\nthe Schreyecks. So as soon as we were gone, this guy Puetz came, I think on a weekly basis, to\ninterview her, and to interview the Schreyecks, and to make it very, very difficult, to make her\nfeel very threatened, to the point where Mr. Schreyeck one day said to my mother, \u201cCaroline,\nthis guy is after you. He will get to you whether it\u2019s next week or the week after. You have to\nleave. I have a brother, as you know, in Vienna, and he has a leather factory. I\u2019m going to get in\ntouch with my brother and I think he will agree to shield you, and you work for my brother.\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t easy, because when you lee -- left a town, and I think it\u2019s probably still so in\nGermany, you had to go to the police, you had to fill out papers that you were leaving such and\nsuch a residence, and you were going to such and such a town, where you were going to live in\nsuch and such a place. Then when you got, let\u2019s say, to Vienna, you were supposed to go to the\nViennese police and start papers that you were a new resident. Now, what they took upon\nthemselves -- this is why I said to you before, these people did things that I am not sure I would\nhave the guts to do for anybody. They provided food for my mother, so she wouldn\u2019t have --\nbecause she was not registered, she wouldn\u2019t get food stamps. They provided a place for her to\nlive with a family where she had a room. And she was not registered with the police, and the\nGermans had no idea where she went. And Puetz came, she found out later, to Schreyeck in\nDusseldorf, and said where -- they want to talk to her. And Mr. Schreyeck said, \u201cI have no idea\nwhere she went. I hope she isn\u2019t going to take her life, because she was talking about killing\nherself,\u201d and stuff like that. And she stayed with the Schreyecks in Vienna for quite a long time,\nand -- you know, there\u2019s so many bad things happened to my mother, but this is almost unreal. I\nthink she had the flu, or something, but sh -- anyway, my mother wasn\u2019t one to stay home if she\njust had a little cold, but she was sick. And she stayed home, and that day when she stayed home,\nthe Gestapo came to the Schreyeck factory in Vienna and asked for Karolina Lenneberg. So, Mr.\nSchreyeck number two, the one in Vienna send somebody he trusted, I don\u2019t know who it was, to\nher -- to her room, and told her to immediately leave, take the next train to Kleve, which is close\nto the Dutch border, where a third Schreyeck brother had a tannery. So -- and then --",
        "A: Exactly. And then the -- and the -- he -- she worked for the Schreyecks I -- only for several\nmonths I think. And the bombing attacks were getting horrendously bad in Kleve. I mean, this is\nhistorical, what was -- th -- it was almost flattened, because there was also -- lot of industry in\nKleve, and also it was a very short trip for the British fliers, cause it was close to the Dutch\nborder. And one day the house next to the Schreyeck\u2019s was bombed. It was one of those bombs\nthat went into the basement and then exploded. And Mr. Schreyeck said to my mother,\n\u201cCaroline, you have a sister in Lippborg. Why -- I think you should leave. I don\u2019t think any of us\nare going to survive.\u201d And my mother left, and the day my mother left, all the Schreyecks were\nkilled in their cellar. One of the bombs went into their basement.",
        "A: And this is why -- you know, you talk about justice, and -- and belief in God, and all this,\nwhich my mother had lost completely -- the Schreyecks in Dusseldorf had a wonderful son, and\nthey were such anti-Nazis. Their son was killed. He was drafted, and he was killed. And, you\nknow, these -- the good people --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, I was --",
        "A: -- I was very conscious of it and also, my parents prepared both my brother and me to -- for\nimmigration. Our suitcases were practically packed. We got English lessons, I got fr -- English\nand Spanish lessons from an uncle of mine who also perished, who was a philologist, he s -- he\nspoke many languages. And my brother also got additional e -- when e -- we had English in s --\nin school, but he got additional lessons. My parents had what was called an affidavit, which is a\npledge from an American citizen to bring over a person from another country, and that they\nwould take care of that person if that person would not be able to be financially self-sufficient.\nThe idea is that this person will not become a -- will not use the social services of the United\nStates. So we had this affidavit of a very distant relative in Chicago, Beifuss. And my parents\nhad a number. To -- to get an interview with the American consul in Dusseldorf you had to have\na number. And the waiting time before you could see a consul was between a year and a year and\na half. So they had obtained that affidavit a long time before they saw the consul. They saw the\nconsul in 1938. I don\u2019t recall when it was, whether it was the beginning or the middle of \u201938.\nAnd the consul, who was known not to be too favorably inclined towards the Jews, like s -- it\nturned out later some people in the state department were, he decided that the affidavit that\nMorris Beifuss gave my mother and my father was okay, but they -- he considered it insufficient\nbecause Mr. Beifuss had given X number of affidavits to other people. And they wanted an\nadditional affidavit from somebody other than Mr. de -- Mr. Beifuss. Now, Mr. Beifuss was an\nextremely wealthy man, who lived on one of the main, glorious streets near the lake, and that\nbroke our neck. So my father wrote to a very distant relative nobody liked, who lived in Texas,\nand who had come to Germany on occasion. And he was an alcoholic, and he hated everybody\nwho didn\u2019t drink with him. And my father was sure he was -- gotten into bad situation with this\nman because he would not drink with him. Well, he declined to give us an affidavit. And -- so\nyou get the picture. My parents then tried to go to Uruguay. And it wasn\u2019t just my parents, it was\na cousin of theirs and another couple. And they fell into the hands of a smuggler, a very good\nlooking young man who -- who was such a con artist, he persuaded everybody. Plus, they didn\u2019t\nhave too many options. They gave him a lot of money, and then he disappeared. So that -- that\nwas -- what they should have done, I think, they should have just taken what they had on their\nbacks and just tried to go either through France -- or France was already occupied, maybe, when\nwas France -- I -- no, they could have gone through France, maybe to -- to Spain, etcetera. Some\npeople managed to do that, but they didn\u2019t do that, all right? So they still hoped for writing and\ngetting on the additional affidavit and nothing panned out, and then it was \u00b038, and then was\nKristallnacht, and -- and after that it only went downhill.",
        "A: After the war.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anybody who did it during the war, I mean not among our friends. But after the\nwar, actually there was a -- a cousin of my husband, she was married to a Polish Jew, who was a\nwatchmaker, and he couldn\u2019t make a go of anything, it was a wonderful guy. And they came to\nthis country like that. And then he, first time in his life he had a wonderful job with Longine, and\nthen he died of a bleeding ulcer. So you know, life is -- yeah, sometimes you can\u2019t win.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, I -- by that time I was old enough --",
        "A: -- not only old enough, my mother was working, my father was working by that time in\nTiefbau, which means very hard labor, for which he probably didn\u2019t get paid, you know, digging\nditches, and construction, which was compulsory work because he had to give up his store in\nDiisseldorf, his wholesale store, because then an edict came out that Jews couldn\u2019t have --\ncouldn\u2019t own businesses any more. And then he was drafted to -- to work in -- in Tiefbau, which\nwas digging basements and etcetera, and I don\u2019t know exactly for what. And I don\u2019t think he --\nhe got paid at all for that.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, and -- and I was -- and then my -- our school was burned, and -- and there was -- we\nhad very limited education. And there was only one teacher and his wife left, and there was a\nlaundry, the Elsberg laundry in -- outside of Dusseldorf, and these people allowed us to have\nschool there. There were only, you know, relatively few people. There was not an accredited\nschool any more, because some people sent their children to Duisberg, which was -- still had an\naccredited Jewish school, and my brother went to Duisberg on the train, and got special\npermission to take the train because Jews weren\u2019t allowed to go in the train any more. And so\nthis 1s -- you know, I wi -- I -- then I had no more education, and I kept house for my parents,\nwho were working very hard from morning to night.",
        "A: There\u2019s nothing, you know, there was no maid after -- after we went to Dusseldorf. Things\nwent downhill very, very fast, yeah.",
        "A: I was never frightened. I always had that feeling that my parents go -- they were trying\neverything. They were going to get us out of this. And I was also very busy, I was learning\nEnglish, I was learning Spanish, I was keeping house, I was taking care of my brother, who was\nfour years younger than I was. And there was still that hope that this criminal is going to --",
        "A: -- to stop, 1s going to be killed or something. And I remember in the last apartment we had,\nwe -- my father -- this -- there were all non-Jews in that apartment, it was a most primitive\napartment, but on the top floor was a couple, and he was a communist. And he was very anti-\nNazi. And when we went into the basements when there was an alarm, an air -- air strike alarm,\nmy father and this man would be listening to the foreign senders. And it didn\u2019t look good at that\ntime. Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I thought so.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Nothing, nothing.",
        "A: Yes, people were taking aw -- being taken away, but nobody ever mentioned concentration\ncamps. You know, the -- the Gestapo did incarcerate people, but somehow it did not sink through\nwhere these people were going. It was taken for granted they were going to some prisons, people\nwere imprisoned. And not only Jews, but political prisoners. I remember distinctly I was in my\ngrandmother Schenider\u2019s house, who would go to church every Sunday morning, to a big\nChristian church, Evangelische Kirche in Dortmund. And my grandfather was suffering from\ncancer. And they were very fond of a minister who would visit my grandfather. And one day I\nwas there on a Sunday, my grandmother comes home, her red -- her eyes are red, she is beyond\nherself because the -- the minister was taken off by black shirts when he was giving a sermon.\nAnd what he was telling his congregation is that they should be more tolerant, and what\u2019s going\non with the Jews was incomprehensible to him. And two black shirts came up, took him off the\npodium -- I mean, off the whatever you call it in a -- in a Protestant church, and he was never\nheard from again. And my -- my aunts told me that they heard that he was killed in a\nconcentration camp. So that has made a tremendous impression on me at that time, I remember\nthat. And that was, you know, many, many years before people were routinely put into custody.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t part of our vocabulary.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t, maybe my parents were, but I wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: Right, yeah, he came back and forth every day.",
        "A: But he -- but -- but don\u2019t forget, we didn\u2019t wear this Jewish star yet at that time.",
        "A: So, you know, it\u2019s not too clear that anybody would have known that he was a Jewish child.",
        "A: Yes --",
        "A: -- we had I.D. cards.",
        "A: And that said Jewish, I mean, if somebody would stop you, but how many people would have\nstopped a young boy and asked for the I.D. card? But that stop in -- that school in Duisberg\nclosed, probably not too long, maybe six months or something after Kristallnacht.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly, I don\u2019t remember that too well.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, I remember it very well. I remember it because somebody, and I don\u2019t\nremember who it was, I think it probably was this neighbor of my parents, came down and told\nmy mother to hide my father. And he was in a closet, and they never came into our house, as it\nturned out. And they -- a lot of men were being taken away, my -- my stepfather was taken away\nin Dusseldorf, my father was not. I\u2019m not sure that he hid in our house, or somebody else\u2019s\nhouse, that I don\u2019t remember. All I remember distinctly is there was a raid before Kristallnacht, I\nthink just a short time before Kristallnacht, where they went through Jewish homes and looked\nfor, in quote, forbidden books. Now, forbidden books weren\u2019t necessarily books by Jewish\nauthors. Anyone who was who in literature was a forbidden book, whether it was Bernard Shaw,\nor what. And I will never forget this, my father was -- downstairs in the basement there was a\nwash cellar, and a big stove where people would boil their wash in those days. And my father\nwas burning books, and he was practically crying. And h -- he said to me, \u201cI am getting rid of my\nold friends.\u201d And these were his books, because they were going through Jewish homes, and if\nyou had a book that was on the forbidden list, forget it, they would arrest you. Now that I\nremember.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He was very unhappy, and whenever he was unhappy it was very, very sad for me.",
        "A: You know, it -- it -- I mean, you sense when your parents are upset. I also sensed that my\nparents were trying so hard to get us out of Germany. And I remember maps on the floor, and\nstudying South America, and ur -- Uruguay, and places like that, that they were hope there --\nhope they were going to go, with their cousins. So --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Went out the next day and saw the destruction. My parents wouldn\u2019t let us go out of -- get out\nof our apartment. I mean, my mother, I think. I don\u2019t know, I think my father was -- somebody,\nprobably that couple upstairs, the communists probably had him in their apartment.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, but they knew -- these people knew -- the Gestapo knew she was not from th -- racially\nJewish.",
        "A: And -- and -- yeah, and these people upstairs -- he was only a worker, but he was a very\nintelligent man, he was a communist and he -- he knew what was going on. He was constantly\nlistening to what they call the Fremdhorer, which was the foreign sender, which was England,\nyou know. So they were very well informed. I went out the next day, and there was nothing left\nof my school, it was all burned down. And my parents told me that the Dusseldorf fire\ndepartment was there in full force, and they were putting hoses on the adjacent buildings, to\nmake sure that the adjacent buildings weren\u2019t burning down, and they let the Jewish buildings\nburn to the ground. And these were enormous buildings, I mean, stone buildings, it was\nbeautiful.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I re -- when I think of it, 1t\u2019s just incr -- incredible.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s incre -- I just can\u2019t believe that this ever happened sometimes.",
        "A: Not among -- not in school, and not -- no. I was a Mischling -- there were two kinds of\nMischlingen. There were prefer -- preferential Mischlingen, those who were born to a Jewish\nparent, one Jewish parent, but raised either as a Protestant or a Catholic. They were the privil --\npreferred -- preferential. And then there were the Judischer Mischlingen, that\u2019s was me. I mean,\nwas far as the racial politics go, I was still a Mischling. But I was a Jew, and I was registered\nwith my brother in the Jewish community, and I was given the ri -- Jewish religion at birth, and\nSo was my brother, so there was no question, and the Gestapo had all the papers.",
        "A: And the Previligierter Mischlingen, they had a much easier life than the Jewish Mischlingen.\nThey were able to go to -- to public school. I we -- we weren\u2019t. And they were not really terribly\npersecuted until -- and I don\u2019t know this distinctly, but somewhere at the very beginning of *45,\nwhen they rounded up Christian Mischlingen, you know, the pref -- prefer -- pre -- preferential\nMischlingen, and sent them to Terezin. Now what I only learned not terribly long ago, which I\ndidn\u2019t know, because we were deported from Terezin at the end of \u201944 -- I mean, October of \u201944,\nis that they were building gas chambers and ovens in Terezin, that I didn\u2019t know. And that\nsupposedly, I mean this is what -- and I really want to research this, that the ovens were already\nfinished, the only thing that was missing were the doors. Now, whether they were going to shoot\npeople, or put them -- o-or how they were going to kill them, but they had ovens. So, all these\npeople, who felt relatively secure until \u201945, wouldn\u2019t have been very secure.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: I think it was after Kristallnacht, but I don\u2019t remember how -- how long afterwards.",
        "A: I have a pretty darn good memory, and as far as my experiences go -- you know, I have a\ndiary f -- which I should have brought, and I forgot that, from 1945. So I should have, you know",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. I wrote it on the road back, on paper. And then I got to Lippborg and my aunt gave me\nthe diary, and Buschi helped me be -- re -- I put it in my diary. Yeah, but that I didn\u2019t think\nabout, yeah.",
        "A: Right, and he has no schooling whatsoever --",
        "A: -- except Uncle Karl, he got private lessons, and the Schnooks, and I don\u2019t know if they\nperished, I probably should look it up. They probably perished. They were the last teachers, and\nthey also gave private lessons to my brother, and to me.",
        "A: My parents paid them, yes.",
        "A: I mean, they didn\u2019t pay my -- my -- my uncle, but they --",
        "A: -- they paid -- yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, and also they had -- you know, they were constantly selling things. They still had a few\npaintings that they were selling, and my mother got rid of all her jewelry, she was selling things,\nyou know, little by little. So that helped to a degree.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t try to show it ever.",
        "A: When we were with them, and that lasted, believe it or not, all the way to Auschwitz.",
        "A: My father tried to -- to put -- to hide from us as much as he could. I didn\u2019t realize it, I only\nrealized it later, because my father was transported out of Terezin about a year before we were\nall transported to Auschwitz. And he was working on the bunker that Hitler was -- they were\nbuilding for Hitler in Berlin. And when he came back, he seemed to me like a different person.\nHe wouldn\u2019t talk about anything that happened to him working on this construction of the bunker\nin Berlin, but he -- he did tell me he was working with other people from concentration camps.\nAnd I think even though in Terezin most of us -- nobody knew that there was an Auschwitz, or\nthere were extermination camps. I really -- later on am convinced that he got a full dose of what\nwas going on from some of the people who are working with him in Berlin, and he never -- he\nnever talked about his experience in Berlin, never.",
        "A: I saw a change in him.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, he was -- he was trying to -- to be so supportive and to give us so much hope. He wanted\nus to live, and he wanted to see my mother again. And he did this even after he came back from\nBerlin, but somehow -- he was always a very open person, but whenever I asked about what\nhappened, what was he doing in Berlin, he was like a closed book, he would -- just would not\nopen up. But no, he never -- I mean he -- he was encouraging us all the way.",
        "A: It was very important for us, very important. And that he also was able to give us a lot of\nfood. You know, he -- he -- he was a man who had held an enormous position at Karstadt\u2019s. He\nwas a terrific mathematician. But he could do anything. He could work in construction. And in\nTerezin what he did when they asked him what his profession was, he didn\u2019t say merchant or --\nor whatever, he said he was a carpenter. And he ended up with a carpentry job in Terezin in the\nbauhof, which gave him the chance to steal as much wood as he could, to give it to the cooks,\nand to get extra food for us. So you -- do you get a picture?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Well, it was big news. I think my parents expected it because Hitler was going into adjacent --\nyou know, he was taking over at first Austria and etcetera. But we -- our last apartment was right\nby the railroad tracks, which used to be an -- was a house -- an apartment house owned by a\nJewish family, and this was the last place we were allowed to live in, and it was not in the best\narea. Excuse me. And we could see the railroad tracks from our apartment, and we saw the\nfreight trains passing for hours and hours and hours, loaded with equipment. Guns, and you\nknow, war equipment. And my father and my mother were talking about it, and it was clear to us\nthat Hitler was preparing for something, and that he was going to take over another country. So\nmy parents, yes, I mean, they tried to keep it from us, but I was too old by that time, and I\nrealized that war seemed imminent. War seemed imminent and still there was hope, but war and\nextermination of the Jews just -- that\u2019s something that they never put two and two together.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, this guy eventually was going to -- I -- I thought we were going to be restricted in our\napartment, which from where we came from was, you know, pretty going downhill. My parents\nhad to work very hard. I was prepared that maybe they would put me into a -- into labor for some\nwar effort or something. But it never occurred to me -- I mean, da -- can a healthy human mind\npicture what eventually happened? You know --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: I was much more concerned reading books by Karl May, which was an author who was very\npopular, who had never been to America, and who wrote all these stories about the fights\nbetween Indians and cowboys.

No -- and, you\nknow, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure whether -- what my parents, if they really thought that things were\ngoing to -- to get so bad that our life were threatened, they certainly didn\u2019t show it.",
        "A: Yes. I\u2019m trying to think. There were only a relatively small number of people my age left in\nDisseldorf. A lot of people had been able to get out of the country, and a lot of my friends had\nleft, some of them legally and some illegally. But there were a bunch of people, some of them I\nwasn\u2019t clo -- close with, but at least a half a dozen or so that I became very close to. They were\nolder than I was by a few years. They were deported in 1941. I\u2019m trying to think -- so I think I\nprobably met Kurt in 1939, or 40.",
        "A: Right.",

And we\n-- we had -- we danced, we had a Victrola, and 1 -- I didn\u2019t know how to dance, they taught me\nhow to dance. There were a couple of people, they were half Jewish. Their father had been\nChristian and he had died, so they were left with their Jewish mother, and a gra -- and a Jewish\ngrandmother. And they were the most good looking guys you had ever seen. Tall and blonde,\nand just terrific guys. And then there was a girl, and she was part of the group, and I didn\u2019t care\nfor her that much, I felt she was a loose girl. She let them touch her up and down and this is\nsomething that I just, you know, thought was really not right. And we had a very good time.

And Uncle Karl was\nvouching for Kurt, and rightly so, and he -- I remember, I mean my parents must -- now in\nretrospect that you ask me that, they must have had some questions about it. I remember Uncle\nKarl told my parents that he was the most wonderful kid, and he trusted him implicitly. And he\nhad good reason to, yes.",

We can\u2019t swim in the Rhine river any more because it says Jews can\u2019t swim\nhere any more. And -- and we can\u2019t go to the movies. I remember when I was in school, and we\nused to walk -- from school we used to walk home, and we passed by a movie house, and there\nwas a picture of a mouse playing the piano. We called it the American mouse, and we wanted so\nbadly to see that picture, that Mickey Mouse picture, but there -- you couldn\u2019t get in. There was a\nsign, Jews cannot enter. And Konigs Allee in Dusseldorf was like Fifth Avenue. And pretty soon\nthere were signs all over, Jews can\u2019t in -- enter, Jews can\u2019t be serviced he -- served here any\nmore, etcetera. Those were the stores that used to have, we speak English, parler Francais and all\nthis as a -- for an international city.

And if the butcher didn\u2019t want to wait on us, he had a perfect right\nto do so, because we had Jewish food stamps. Or he -- they could turn us back not to come into\ntheir establishment when we -- when we had to wear the Jewish star. And then they -- the Nazi\nyouth would beat us up.",
        "A: Oh yes. I was scared to go out. And then they took my bicycle away, which was my form of\ntransportation. You know, it was all gradually. Then they took all the jewelry away. And the only\nreason why I have things 1s because of my aunts. Because, don\u2019t forget, I wouldn\u2019t have a si -- I\nwouldn\u2019t have the -- a -- anything, I wouldn\u2019t even have some of the documents I\u2019m going to\ngive to you if it weren\u2019t for my aunts, because my mother couldn\u2019t keep them either.",

And I think that\nwas actually true when I was a young teenager, and I think that I would never be -- have the\ntendency to kind of self-indulge and feel sorry for myself. It was always the idea of keep on\ngoing and survive. And I think that -- I\u2019m -- don\u2019t know where it came from, it comes from my\nparents too, and I think it helped me a lot. It helped me in Auschwitz. I mean, if you ask me the\nsame question about Auschwitz, I can only tell you that I wrapped myself into a cocoon and I\nwas living inwards. And somehow, it sounds strange or unbelievable to a lot of people, but it\u2019s\nthe truth. What happened outside of me, even when that woman was shot in front of me, it\nsomehow didn\u2019t totally touch me inside. You know, I was able to do that, and I didn\u2019t do it\nconsciously, it came just naturally. The defenses kind of helped me.",

        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: There was, and -- certainly, and I think what helps people young and old is when they are\nvery, very busy and focused. And I was very busy. I was studying English and Spanish, I was\ngetting some education by hook or by crook, which the Nazis didn\u2019t want us to have, and I was\nkeeping house, and I was cooking. And my father worked from dawn till dusk in construction,\nand my mother worked very hard in the factory, in the belt factory. So I didn\u2019t have that much\ntime, and somehow I was able, the little time when I had some was at night, and I wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to read in bed until 12, one or two o\u2019clock at night, but I did that, and I always had a\nflashlight, I actually, you know, read by flashlight.

And then, by the time they moved to Dusseldorf, they had to get into\na much smaller apartment, and they had lost a lot, and he had sold a lot of things. What he did\nwith some of the books that he did not take to Diisseldorf, whether he gave them away, or sold\nthem -- I know they tried to sell a lot of things, I really don\u2019t know. But certainly that whole set\nof furniture, that was sold, I know that, in -- in his study. It was beautiful furniture with a\nbookcase that covered almost the whole wall, and leather chair and -- and a -- and a big desk,\nbecause I know that so well, I\u2019m not -- wasn\u2019t supposed to go into my father\u2019s study, but I often\ndid, when I know nobody was around, and I was rummaging around, and I did read some books\nthat were kind of forbidden books for me, which were in his library and had a lot of sex in it.

He didn\u2019t even have to use a pen and a -- a pencil and paper. So he did get s --\ninstruction. He also had a very beautiful voice, and he -- and he loved to sing.

In Diisseldorf some of the people did know, who\nknow the Lennebergs, which was a family who had lived in Disseldorf for a long, long time. I\nmean, they\u2019re a very established family.

        "A: Well, bunch of kids who came out of school, and many of them in uniform. The Hitler youth\nand the BDM, I mean they were uniformed, and you know some people have made the\nconnection, oh they are like -- they were like the boy scouts, and the girl scouts, well they were\nnot. They were indoctrinated. They had leaders who actually told their -- the young people under\nthem that it was their duty as good Germans -- and I\u2019m talking now about Germans, not about\nJews, to listen to their fathers, and -- to their father and mother and grandparents and family, and\nif they heard anything in the house, that anybody in their family said something derogatory about\nthe Fuhrer, it was their duty to tell him. This was the -- the leader, the boy scout le -- the youth\nleader. And there were many people who found themselves in trouble because their own children\ndenounced them. And these were the kids who were made to feel like heroes if they di -- did that.\nAnd their leaders were usually young guys in their late teens, who were good scouts, very good\nhikers, you know, like -- like the boy scouts. And -- somebody they could look up to. They\nwanted to be as good as climbing mountains and -- and swimming and all this kind of thing. And\nthey were much more impressionable when these young people talked to them, and told them\nwas to do, than their parents, which is a normal thing even 1n a normal society. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. And then if -- especially after we wore the star, there were bunch of kids, they had\nthese meetings almost on a nightly basis, where they were indoctrinated, they sang the Hitler\nsongs. And they came out of these meetings, and if they saw a Jew, they would beat him up. And\nit\u2019s mu -- it\u2019s much easier for 10 kids to do it than for one. One would start, oh, there\u2019s a Jew,\ncome on. And then they would start saying, Jude ist signate spitze augen ecke, arschloch dreckig,\nwhich 1s -- it\u2019s very vulgar, you know, I translated it in my book, but the Jew with the -- with the\npointy nose, and a dirty asshole, and you know, things like that. And that\u2019s what we were\nsubjected to every day when we were out. I hated to go out any more.",

        "A: -- and I was -- that\u2019s one thing my parents told me, never to fight with BDM, which were the\ngirls, or the Hitler youth, because if you were one person they would gang up on you, and\ncertainly the police would come, and y -- I would have put my parents into harm\u2019s way, too.\nWho told you to do that? Did your parents indoctrinate you to do that?",
        "A: No, I was never hurt. I was pushed against the wall a coup -- people were hurt, I knew people\nwho were hurt, but I was never hurt. And my parents asked me couldn\u2019t I do my shopping and\nstuff at a certain time, and don\u2019t go out in the late afternoon, and then pretty soon it was resolved,\nwe weren\u2019t allowed to go out at dusk any more anyway. So --",

        "A: Only I, I was the first one to get that notice. And my parents -- which again, you know, I was\na young girl, I didn\u2019t quite a -- quite appreciate what my parents must have gone through. And I\nremember their discussions, what are they going to do. They would refer to me as a child, even\nthough, you know, by -- by that time, in f -- in \u201942 --",
        "A: I was 16. They can\u2019t let their child go alone. And then they also, rightly so felt, well now,\nshe\u2019s going to go now to a labor camp. Nobody knew about concentration camps. Extermination\ncamps, nobody had -- could even imagine. Excuse me. Now then, she\u2019s going to go to one labor\ncamp, and then maybe next month Biibchen, my brother would be sent to another labor camp,\nand my father -- we would all be separated. So I know they went through a terrible time, trying\nto figure out what to do. The conclusion they made was wrong, they should have let me go alone,\nbut they didn\u2019t, and they all volunteered to go with me.",
        "A: Including my mother. And I had -- believe I had mentioned before that Puetz, who was the\nhead of the Gestapo, hated my mother. And I\u2019m sure it was just to hurt her, certainly no -- he\nknew where we were going, but certainly not out of compassion that he wasn\u2019t going to let her\ngo with us. And he probably felt because I say this since he pursued my mother at the factory\nwhere she was working, at the Schreyeck\u2019s, almost on a weekly basis, he probably felt that if he\ncouldn\u2019t have her, if -- he was going to trap her, and she was going to -- to get to what the\nGermans used to call numero sicher, number secure, which was a camouflage word for sending\npeople to prison. So then he said she couldn\u2019t go with us, and she appealed, and no way was he\ngoing to allow her to go with us. So my brother and my father and I, we were deported. And in\nDisseldorf they had a wonderful place to deport Jews from, which was a Dusseldorf\nslaughterhouse, the Schlachthof. The reason was probably partially vicious and partially\nconvenience, because the Schlachthof had a lot of train rails, so they could divert trains to the\nSchlachthof without having a spectacle at the main train station deporting the Jews.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure of it.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure of it not just from my mother, but I\u2019m sure of it from things my father said, and what\nthe Schreyecks have said. Because even under the circumstances my mother was racially not a\nJew. And this was a racial thing, and after he had made sure she couldn\u2019t go with us to the camp,\nhe still pursued her, you know, which was somewhat unusual.",
        "A: Not directly.",
        "A: No. I was included, of course, when we had to make a similar decision in Terezin.",
        "A: But at that time it was mostly my parents. And I know that they didn\u2019t get any sleep, that they\nwere constantly throwing it back and forth. And I would have to make it up, and I don\u2019t do that. I\ntry to be as truthful to my memory as I can.",
        "A: Whether I said something, I can go alone, which is probably -- it\u2019s most likely I said it, but I\ncan\u2019t remember that.",

        "A: I think it was a terrible trauma for me, for my father, which I sensed. I mean, even though he\ntried to have a stiff upper lip, but that he wasn\u2019t able to do any more. I was getting older, and I\nknew my father. And this separation from my mother was very, very difficult for him. And times\nwere so uncertain. But yeah, I can\u2019t really --",
        "A: No, we only hear what the Nazis told us in their propaganda. We heard through my father\u2019s\ncommunist friend in the same building, and when my father listened to also, which was British\nnews, what was happening in the world, in the war. And it didn\u2019t sound very good at that time, as\nyou know. But nobody that I know of ever made any -- gave any explanation to what happened\nin the camps. And as you know, that even when people managed to escape some of the camps,\nand try to bring it to the attention of the American government, which I didn\u2019t know, we -- we\nonly learned that, you know, after the war, nobody wanted to listen, nobody wanted to -- to\nbelieve it. And what I have to say to you is had I not been in Auschwitz, had I not been a\nwitness, had not -- had I not seen what I have seen, I\u2019m not sure I could believe it. A teacher at\none of the high schools was very upset with two students. It\u2019s a very large high school in a\nworking class area in -- in New Jersey, and in New Jersey it\u2019s compulsory to teach about the\nHolocaust. And these kids, at least one of them claimed, and maybe the other one agreed then,\nthat this was all made up, this never happened, and when she said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to have a\nspeaker who was there,\u201d they made fun of that. So when I came to this high school with ha --\nwhich has two and a half thousand students, I was told that these two guys will be put right in the\nfront in the auditorium. And their attitude was such I knew this meant trouble. So I made eye\ncontact with them, and I said, \u201cI understand that there are some people here who believe and are\nconvinced that this never happened.\u201d And they were, you know, they were perking up. And then\nI said, \u201cWell, I can understand it. If I hadn\u2019t been there, I wouldn\u2019t believe it either.\u201d And from\nthen on, I had no more problem with them.",
        "A: You know, it disarmed them. But I didn\u2019t say this t -- just to calm them down, I really mean\nthat. This is totally, totally incomprehensible to any normal human being, what I saw. Totally.\nAnd so I -- I -- I really think it\u2019s beyond a civilized person\u2019s comprehension.",

They -- except I have friends, and I made friends in the displaced\nperson camp, and I made friends in the camps, who came from cultured eastern Jewish families.\nI\u2019m not talking about that. I mean the shtetl Jews. They were different from a lot of us, and they\nwere much more in their own circle, and I don\u2019t know how they reacted. I -- I have -- I have no\nclue.",

        "A: People who ran to the wire to electrocute themselves. The only time Buschi and I and Zdena\nwere thinking about that, when we were going to be transported back to Auschwitz, because we\nknew what was awaiting us. But the instincts to live are very, very strong, and are stronger in\nsome people than in others. The strength physically of some people, can not be measured in\nheight or weight. It is something else. I think that supports means a great deal. Now maybe if I\nwould have been all alone someplace in an extermination camp, without anybody to support me,\nbut I with all the mizaira, I had the luck to be with these five women, and the way we supported\neach other really helped us, and helped us to, as I like to put it, put ourselves into a cocoon and\nnot to even be aware of what was happening outside of us. So we all need some support, and it\ncan\u2019t --it cannot all come from the inside, but a lot of it does come from the inside.",

        "A: Well, is -- that was like bedlam, and don\u2019t forget, by that time, in \u201942, a number of transports\nhad already left Dusseldorf at the end of \u201941, and at the very beginning of \u201942, and -- which were\nnot going to Terezin, but many of them had gone to Poland. And a lot of the people in our\ntransport were quite old, and not in good physical condition. And I remember there were tables\nwhich were manned by Gestapo secret police, and there was one table which was manned by a\nrepresentative of -- from the Jewish community, which had the list of names of all the Jews in\nDisseldorf, who belonged -- who -- o-of Jewish faith, and the Jewish community had this list.\nAnd they were checked off, you know the Germans were very good at ch -- at anything that was\nlists or bureaucracy. And so we were checked off by the Jewish -- a representative of the Jewish\ncommunity, and we were checked off by the SS, to be sure that everybody who had gotten --\ngotten the notification to present themselves had appeared. And then we had to go to another\nperson, a -- a Nazi at a -- at a table where the name, like Ursula Pawel was twice now -- Jewish\ncommunity the -- the SS, and then the secret police, a third one, were given a sign, which were\nput on around our neck, which I don\u2019t recall whether it had a number, that I can\u2019t recall, but it\nhad my name on itt.",
        "A: Yes. Everybody on -- in the transport was given a sign. It wasn\u2019t huge, you know, it was a\nsign that -- with a string around the neck.",
        "A: I think it was. It might not have been all of it, but certainly the number, I think, was\nhandwritten, and if I recall it correctly, it was written with pretty heavy black ink, or you know,\npen or whatever.",
        "A: Oh yes, we had to wear this on the train, and then we were told to put our suitcases at a\ncertain place and not to touch them, they were going to take care of the suitcases. Of course, we\nnever saw the suitcases again. These were the suitcases that had been packed for -- from 1938\non, to go to this country. And if 1t hadn\u2019t been for the American consul, we would have been in\nthis country. And those suitcases, we never saw again. N-Nobody on the transport. The only\nthing that we were allowed to keep was some hand luggage, which was made out of like -- like a\nsmall rucksack material, which I remember I had, it was one of those, like when you go on a\nhiking trip, and it was a bag like that. Now, that\u2019s all I had.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was extremely hot, and we -- we -- when we arrived by train in Baushowiczy, which was\nBauschowitz, because there was no train station, no rails to Terezin, they were only built later for\nthe sole purpose of transporting Jews from Terezin to the east. But we arrived in Bauschowitz,\nand there were trucks there with Czechs who had been in Terezin since \u201941, and some of them\nhad striped uniforms on, which also was not continued, you know, after more and more transport\narrived, they did not give uniforms to inmates any more. And they had to -- they worked for the\nNazis to -- to take all the luggage out of the luggage cars, and put them on trucks. And of course,\nthey were then transported back to Germany. We were given some clothing later on in Terezin,\nwhich -- what transport they came from I don\u2019t know, but they were pretty bad clothing. But as\nfar -- y -- one thing I do remember, that my mother insisted that we wear our coats. Now why she\ninsisted that, I don\u2019t know, but it was something we did not put in our luggage. We either had it\non our arm, and so we did have our coats.",
        "A: And these coats, I remember these coats, and my mother reminded me many times, because\nshe had a German tailor who was an anti-Nazi and was very good to -- to her, and he -- she got\nsome material and he made these coats for us. So they were supposed to also take us to America.\nSo my brother -- and I remember the coat too, because I blamed the coat very much on the fact\nthat my -- my brother was selected immediately to be -- to be killed. You know, he was 13 years\nold, and he was of average height for his age. He had a very young face, and he had this coat,\nwhich he had outgrown. And a boy with a coat, with a gray coat -- and you know with a -- half\nthe arms are -- are showing, it makes a young child even look younger. So, you know, you can\nargue. I went through this in my mind, you know, how big was he, because there were some kids\nthey were 14, by some -- somehow they managed to survive, but my brother didn\u2019t. He looked\nlike a -- a young kid.",
        "A: They had some passenger cars, and they had some cattle cars, and we were in the passenger\ncar. And I am not sure that it -- there was any significance to that, whether this was calculated or\nnot. And I remember the two people who were on the train with us, and in the same -- on the\nsame bench, or whatever you want to call it, and one was a nurse, Bella, and one was a woman\nmy father knew, he -- she was a radiologist in Boston. And they were in the same compartment.\nThere were other people in --",
        "A: In -- in Dusseldorf.",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t mean that. Sorry about that.",
        "A: I think my association with saying Boston 1s because as you know, I went into x-ray, and I\nwas in touch with a lot of radiologists in Boston. No, she was from Dusseldorf, and she was on\nthe transport, and I don\u2019t know what happened to them. I mean, I know they got to Terezin, but I\ndon\u2019t know what happened to them, and I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t remember the physician\u2019s last\nname, I only remember Bella. I was very impressed with them, because there was a lot of\nmedical language going back and forth between Bella, who was a nurse, and this physician. And\nI thought that would be really neat for me to be in medicine. That I remember.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that it was terrible for me. I think it was terrible for older people, and some of\nthem were in cattle cars. We were in a passenger car. I think that we had some food that my\nmother had prepared for us in our sidebags, and somehow between the conversation we had, and\nmy father had a -- some -- there was some men he was friendly with, and they had lively\nconversations. We weren\u2019t depressed. I think he was more than we were because of the\nseparation from my mother, but I\u2019m not sure that I understood, or that anybody understood what\nwe were facing, because we were going to go to this wonderful labor camp, and then somebody\nspread the word this was a privileged camp for German Jews. And when we came to Terezin, the\nfirst thing that was very difficult for me was the language. The Czech prisoners descended on the\ntrain, and this was a language I\u2019d never heard in my life, and I couldn\u2019t make out what they were\nsaying. And most Czechs speak German, especially educated Czechs. Of course, we all hated\nanything German. And even though we were Jews in Terezin, do you think the Czechs would\nhave spoken one word -- the ch -- Czech Jews would have spoken one word of German with us?\nI mean, I was completely lost. And I tried to -- to get some help from some Czech inmates. As\nsoon as they heard German, that was like raising the red flag, you know. So we had to -- we had\nto really battle on more than one front. And the Czechs had come to Terezin, they were the first\npeople to come to Terezin. So all the good quarters were occupied by Czechs. The jobs that were\nreally good, like in the kitchen were by the ch -- the Czechs already held those. And I was just\nvery lucky. A lot of people weren\u2019t as lucky as I was. I immediately volunteered to work. And\nthey asked me if I had any experience working with children. They first send me to the bauhof,\nwhich was my father worked, to carry wood and stuff. But then I had told them that I was good\nwith children, and what made me do that, I have no clue. And then I got in t -- was told to\npresent myself, that they were going to send me to work in the youth home -- the youth barrack,\nL410 it was first, and then it was 414. And it was -- the youth barrack was just starting, it was at\nthe very beginning. We -- we didn\u2019t really have -- there were some pr -- rooms didn\u2019t even have\nbeds, so we got thre -- three tier bunkbeds, and my father did a lot of work to make it more\nlivable for us.",
        "A: Yeah, my first job in the youth home was really -- not to have my -- the sole responsibility,\nbut I was working with Hilde Dublon, who was at least four years older than I was, she came\nfrom Hamburg. And she was what was called the head betreuer, you know, the chief betreuer,\nchief caretaker of the 30 children in our room. They were -- some were between 14 and 16 years\nold in the first room.",
        "A: No, no, but somehow I -- I got that. I was quite mature in my ways. And Hilde and I hit it off\nbeautifully. There was never any tension, or any rivalry, and I loved her. She was a beautiful\nwoman, very intelligent woman. And then we had a few terrible situations health-wise in\nTerezin. We had a lot of lice, and particularly Kleider Lause, which are the lice that cause\ntyphoid -- typhus. The bad stuff, not the paratyphoid, but the bad stuff. And they lay their eggs in\nthe seams of clothing, and they transmit that disease. And there was an epidemic that broke out,\nwhich nobody realized was typhus, and some of the kids 1n our room got sick. And then there\nwere kids in other rooms that got sick, and they had -- we didn\u2019t know what the symptoms were,\nand we had some very good Czech doctors, but they had no medicines, and they had no way of\ncombating these illnesses. And then we lost a couple of kids, and then Hilde got sick. And we\ndidn\u2019t associate it w-with the other deaths, we didn\u2019t know what it was. And she told me she\ncouldn\u2019t eat. Now for anybody not to be hungry in Terezin, you really had to be sick. So, she had\nher rations on the plate, and she couldn\u2019t finish it. And I shared the same bunkbed with her, there\nwere three -- they were three story high -- stories high, and we had the top bunkbed. And Hilde\nsaid, \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t eat my food, do you want to finish it?\u201d So I finished her food. And you\nknow, typhus is very contagious, and I\u2019m not even sure whether I used another spoon, we\nweren\u2019t very careful. And one day Hilde died. And we lost a few more kids. It was a terrible\nepidemic. And then we were told by Dr. Freund who also perished -- he was a gorgeous guy, a\nCzech guy, and the most bud -- bud -- body, I tell you, everybody was in love with this guy, but\nunfortunately he was married. And he -- what this man did, he did -- he was a fairly young\ndoctor, he was maybe in his mid to late 30\u2019s, and he -- these doctors di -- did heroic things, they\nhad no medicines, they tried everything they could. And he said to me, \u201cThe first thing you have\nto do is clean this place.\u201d And we did get some Lysol, and we had a cleaning procedure that we\ncleaned every bunkbed. And we had the floors, and the walls, and everybody helped, and the\nplace stank from Lysol. And then the ghetto elders sh -- told everybody they had to -- they had to\nclean their places, that was the only way to stop the epidemic, and eventually the -- we managed\nto stop it. And my father and my brother got typhus too, but he did not get the real typhus, he got\nthe paratyphus, which gives people a fever, but doesn\u2019t affect their body the way the real typhus\ndoes, and he recovered from that.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t get a thing.",
        "A: I had eaten, I was next to her, I ha -- I got nothing. I -- I -- how can you explain it? Nothing.\nThen we had another epidemic after -- well, let me go on first. These were older ch -- young\npeople, and they needed a -- what they called a betreuer, a person in charge of the young people,\nwhich was really 24 hour job. And they needed somebody for younger children in another room.\nAnd the head of our youth home, Sigi Kwasniewski, who also perished, told me that he was\ngoing to give me a room by myself, and as there were at least 30 children in there, but that they\nwere younger children, and a lot of them were orphans, and a lot of them had come from Poland.\nAnd they didn\u2019t know what happened to their parents. And some of them were quite traumatized,\nbut wouldn\u2019t talk about it. Th -- I got that room, but then Sigi Kwasniewski decided it was too\nmuch for one person. There was another woman from Vienna, Trude Blau, who was made the\nhead betreuer in that room, she was quite a bit older than I was. She also had an affair with Sigi\nKwasniewski, and that wasn\u2019t a happy time for me. She was not an easy person to -- to deal with,\nand she was very ambitious, and eventually I -- she married Sigi Kwasniewski, and she got a job\nin the -- what do they call it, the office of kanzlei, and I had the sole responsibility for my room.",
        "A: Much better. Oh, I was all ready to quit. I was ready -- I was going to go -- I hated to do that\nto -- to -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the strange thing. You know, my mother and my aunts sent uncountable\npackages to the Red Cross, with fictitious senders, but I knew where they came from, because it\ncame from -- anything close to my aunts. And there were a few packages that came from Vienna,\nand my father recognized my mother\u2019s handwriting, and he was sure my mother was alive in\nVienna. But she made up all these -- these people, you know. Marie Unterbottom, and you -- you\nname it, I mean, and she made up addresses. And my aunt told me -- my aunts, after the war, that\nthey constantly sent packages. And my aunt did a lot of bartering because her husband made\nfurniture, and it was in an area that was totally unaffected by the war, and she would barter with\nthe -- with the farmers, and then she could use some of the stuff to get vitamins and things, and\nalso sausage that was highly smoked so it wouldn\u2019t spoil. And even if we only got 10 or 20\npercent of the packages -- it didn\u2019t go on all the time we were in Terezin, but for a period of time\nwe got packages. And Trude\u2019s brother, came down with TB, and there wasn\u2019t a package that\ncame from my mother and my aunts who I didn\u2019t share the vitamins and the food with Herbert\nBlau. And hi -- and her parents never forgot that. So in other words, you know, we separated\nways, but she al -- but she -- I don\u2019t think she had bad feelings towards me because I was very\ngenerous to Herbert.",
        "A: Well, there was a woman, a Czech woman who was as sexy as anybody can imagine. And she\nwas supposed to help me in the room. She was much older than I was, and I was horrified\nbecause we had ladders to go up to th -- to the third bunkbed, and she doesn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t wear\nunderwear, and she was, you know, she was very sexy, very flirty, and I\u2019m sure she had her\nexperiences. My kids were too small. There was no sexual activity. I had none. I\u2019m sure that\nsome people did. I could have had it with Louis Lowy, but I -- it\u2019s not that I was prude, I mean\nhe just -- I -- I loved him as a friend, but he just didn\u2019t turn me on. I\u2019m sure there was a lot going\non, especially among the Czechs. Some of the Germans were quite old, but that\u2019s all I witnessed.\nAnd the kids were really too small in my room. And then I\u2019m thinking about the -- the people\nwho had the same job that I had -- excuse me.",
        "A: Louis was a good friend of mine. The idea to have any sexual contact with him, I couldn\u2019t\neven have fathomed. There were Kurt Kohorn, who didn\u2019t do anything for me either, and he\nprobably wasn\u2019t interested in me either. Whether they had any sexual activities, I don\u2019t know. I\nwas younger than they were. I mean, they were my friends, but -- because in many ways I was\nmature, but sexually I\u2019m not sure I was that mature, you know.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, and don\u2019t forget, in -- when we came to Terezin, we were not supposed to\nteach or learn. That was strictly verboten. So all the teaching of our children, all the lectures,\nwere all done clandestinely. And I remember distinctly that we were taking turns watching\nwhether the SS was descending into the camp, and giving, you know, sounding the alarm when\nthey did, not knowing what they were up to. So --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: My brother sang in the children\u2019s choir of Carmen, he had a very good voice.",
        "A: Yeah, we saw Brundibar, and Carmen, and -- and I --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, and the Angabilda ti conquer, and you -- you name it. Natung avisor, you know, I\nmean, the things we did, and the talent we had. I was nothing. I was a young girl who -- who had\nvery limited experience, but I really matured very much among these people. We had professors\nfrom Vienna and from -- from Germany, and they would give lic -- lectures, and we had\nmusicologists and I tried to -- to learn how to read music, and I\u2019m not sure that I applied myself,\nor maybe I\u2019m too stupid for it, but that I didn\u2019t manage too well. We had classes in algebra and\narithmetic, particularly Louis, who was a lifelong friend of mine, was very bright. He eventually\nbecame a professor at BU, was a very close friend of my husband\u2019s. He -- he tau -- he gave so\nmany lectures. And there was a biologist from Vienna, and -- and these people were so eager to -\n- to teach us, because we er -- weren\u2019t supposed to learn. If you are not supposed to do\nsomething, there is a tremendous incentive to do it. So yes, we tried our best to educate our kids,\nbut then there were transports going all the time. We had no clue where they were going.",
        "A: We had no clue, especially the orphans. I mean, I still see them today, some of them. There\nwere a couple of girls, one was very tall Mira Hankriff, and one was very short. They had been\norphaned. Their whole families had been killed. And they never talk much about it, and I think\nnow if they had I\u2019m not sure we could have even believed them. But they had formed such a\nbond with each other. I have never seen anything like that in young people, wa -- the bond they\nhad. And it only reminded me of the bond Hannah and Zdena and Buschi and I formed later on.\nBut, you know, this was -- there were -- kids were coming and going. And then you heard these\nrumors that there were s -- one transport came in with kids, they were all full of lice and they\nwere so undernourished, and they were in such bad shape, and this and that was supposed to\nhappen to them, and then there was a name, I don\u2019t know where it comes from, maybe there\u2019s a\nYiddish in it, bonkes, which means rumors. Anything that anybody said that couldn\u2019t be\nquantified, or really you didn\u2019t know where it came from was called bonkes. So they said, oh,\nthese are just bonkes, you know, you can\u2019t believe everything you hear, they just make all -- and\nthese are kids, you know, they make these things up. And then the Nazis send transports with\norphans and young people and I remember this horrible thing where they said they were going to\nSwitzerland, there was a transport. And then later on we found out, you know, Switzerland was\ngoing into the gas. I don\u2019t remember whether they went to -- which extermina-ination camp they\nwent to. So, it was difficult to get news when you were in Terezin, and I\u2019m afraid that we\nweren\u2019t any better than the outside world. Even when we heard some rumors, we didn\u2019t believe\nthem, you know.",
        "A: Okay.\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: Yeah, but I don\u2019t have very, very, you know, distinct memories of it, yeah. But I remember it\nwas sung.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t remember whether I saw it or not, that -- you know, I -- I -- when I\u2019m positive,\nI\u2019m positive, you know?",
        "A: There -- there were lots of things going on, but I also had my job, and I couldn\u2019t always attend\neverything that was going on.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely.",
        "A: Well, Freddi -- I think Freddi perished in -- in the -- in Auschwitz. I get the goose bumps\nwhen I think of it. Freddi and a lot of families were sent to Auschwitz to the Familienlager. And\nI don\u2019t remember the -- the -- the month when it was. I think it was in \u00b044, but I\u2019m not, you\nknow, I\u2019m -- that was very unusual that they allowed whole families to go, but we didn\u2019t know it\nwas going to Auschwitz, but we -- only after the war did I learn that they had this Familienlager\nin Auschwitz where they had set aside a whole area where families could live together, because\nin Auschwitz, as soon as you got there, the children and the women and -- and men were\nseparated. And they were in Auschwitz for quite a long time. And Freddi had -- did a lot with the\nchildren, and he was highly respected. But he had also some contacts with people in Auschwitz,\nwho had contacts knowing what was happening. And if I recall that -- my recollection after the\nwar, when I came to Deggendorf, which was mostly occupied by survivors of Terezin, I think the\nBlaus told me, because you know, I -- we were not in -- in Terezin the whole time any more, that\nFreddi and I forget who else, somebody else who was very prominent, knew when the\nFamilienlager was going to be eliminated. And they went through this terrible agony, whether\nthey should inform everybody and fight back in some way, and you know, and cause a\ntremendous disruption. All you could do is cause a disruption, because you had machine guns\nfrom all corners, I mean nobody could have any illusion that they could survive. And from what\nI understand, Freddi and some of the other people came to the conclusion that if they will do so,\nthey would cause such bedlam and such fear, and nobody was going to be saved anyway, and the\nchildren, instead of going into the gas not knowing where they were going, they were going to\nbe, you know, like hunted animals. And they all went into the gas. Now, I don\u2019t know if my\nrecollection is correct. I\u2019m sure you know Freddi Hirsch\u2019s story. I was not in the family camp, so\n-- so I can only tell you what some of my friends told me happened.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I we -- I mean, I reme -- I -- I wasn\u2019t a close friend of his, but I remember him as th -- he was\nvery sporty, he did a lot of sports with the kids, he was very encouraging. He -- he was, you\nknow, the -- some people you can\u2019t analyze what makes this guy be appreciated and respected by\neverybody? What makes him a leader? And that was Freddi Hirsch.",
        "A: I thought he was quite a few years older, but I -- you see, when I came to Auschwitz, in 1944\n-- I was born in \u201926, so what -- I was 18 years old. Freddi might have been in his early 20\u2019s, you\nknow, but I can\u2019t be -- in other words, you know, he -- I was this -- this 18 year old girl, not --\nyou know, mature as far as m -- my ability to take care of young people, but sexually and every\nother way, I was not a very mature person. And young men that age don\u2019t bother with younger\ngirls like Ursula, you know.",
        "A: They called him Uschi, by the way --",
        "A: -- nobody knew me as Ursula, yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: No, that came about -- well, some people did, but -- maybe alluded to, but in -- in Terezin\neverybody called me Uschi.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, it was horrible, but my father did so many good deeds for the cooks, that we got much\nbetter food. I mean, was the same type of food, but we got more of it, we got puddings, which\nnobody could even dream about. We got knoedle, you know, the dumplings. Yeah, he -- he -- he\nbuilt -- you know, he could do anything, and he built cabinets for the cooks and chairs for the\ncooks, and benches and all this for their quarters, and he was rewarded with food.",
        "A: We got chocolate pudding, and we got -- we got all kinds of stuff that he brought.",
        "A: Oh yes, chocolate pudding. Don\u2019t forget, some of them also cooked for the SS, you know.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh yeah, the cooks were -- they were as fat as -- we hated them.",
        "A: Yeah, we hated them. We had -- th-the Czechs make a dish called knodlicki, which 1s -- it\u2019s a\nflour dish like a dumpling with some sors -- sort of a buttery, sweet sauce on 1t. We had some of\nthat, and -- and of course coffee, which was not coffee, which was like black -- some black sauce\nof some -- some sort. And spreads which were undefinable what they were, were supposed to be\nmarmalade, and wasn\u2019t a real marmalade, lot of artificial junk in it. One thing that might be\ninteresting to you 1s that I think they put something in our food, or maybe it was just the\nnourishment itself, but the -- most women didn\u2019t menistrate any more.",
        "A: Yeah. I lost my -- I lost that, completely, until I came out of the camps, and then I think it\ntook probably a year or more before it came back. So -- and there were rumors that they put\ncertain things in the food, I really don\u2019t know, I have no clue what they did.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know that I thought much about it.",
        "A: It\u2019s not something a young girl is too eager about anyway. They said they -- they put some\nadditive, and I can\u2019t remember what it -- some soda -- sor -- some -- something which 1s\nsupposed to prevent menistration, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s tr -- was true or not.",
        "A: And they had black bread, you know, horrible looking bread. But -- and potatoes --",
        "A: -- in the skin, and a lot of them were half rotten potatoes, but again, we had much better food\nthan most, and so did my room, because my father never just brought the food for me or my\nbrother. Was our room, and Louis\u2019 room. And Louis never forgot that either, and he smuggled\nthings into there.",
        "A: Oh yes. And also what my father did, when we -- when I took the room over, they kept their\nbread rations, all that stuff, in their beds. And then my father felt that that was also breeding a lot\nof disease, and -- and el -- you know, fl -- we had a lot of fleas and all kinds of stuff. So he made\na cupboard which had 30 compartments in it, and each child had their own compartments, and\nthen in my room nobody was allowed to have any food in the compartments. These were kids\nwho were starved, and I can tell you, there was so much discipline in my room. I was very\nyoung, but Papa Lenneberg, Papi they called him, because I called him Papi, he was only known\nas Papi. He told them, and -- and em -- emphasized that you don\u2019t touch anybody else\u2019s\ncompartment. And you know, in all that time, I don\u2019t remember once a kid stealing out of\nanother compartment. You know?",
        "A: Well, they were between -- they were about t -- 10 - 12 - 13.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But you know, like I said before, I didn\u2019t sit there and eat the stuff my father brought. We\nshared everything. And all the packages that I got, they were opened on the table. There was a\ntable with a long bench on each side, and -- and I would -- we would cut everything. We would\ncut th-the chocolate, and whatever was in it, and everybody got something. And we shared. And\nI don\u2019t recall that any other children got packages, because how many children in -- in Terezin\nhad aunts in Germany who could do that kind of thing?",
        "A: You know, so with all my venom against the Red Cross, you know, we did th -- we -- because\nmy venom, you know what they stems from, from -- from the Red Cross visit to Terezin. But\nthen I sometimes think you\u2019re not just -- the Red Cross did get a lot of packages in. Probably of\nthe -- of a hundred packages, even if you -- if only 15 made it --",
        "A: -- and they were sent to my father, my brother, and to me. And then also, to Herbert Blau,\nbecause somehow my -- my father was able to thank you for the package, and Herbert Blau\nreally enjoyed it too. So then my aunts send another package to Herbert Blau.",
        "A: I was learning, and I was teaching. I was reading with them, and I was lacking a lot of\neducation, but I was also learning a lot and taking seminars, etcetera. I did speak English quite\nwell.",
        "A: Oh yeah, because my parents -- I mean, I had a lot of education, even when -- after our school\nwas burned down, because I learned English and Spanish and some French, which eventually\nwas too much, because I was speaking French with a Spanish -- I mean, was just getting too\nmuch. But whatever I learned, I taught my kids. Then there were some people who were very\nartistic, and they learned to draw, etcetera, and make poems, they were encouraged to write\nstories. And then some of these professors gave lectures, and gave them homework, and they\nlearned, and then if the SS came, everything was shoved aside, and we had certain places, you\nknow, under the boards, and we would hide things. And then later on, I think a lot of those\nrestrictions were not enforced as much any more, yeah.",
        "A: It depended. There were some who seemed somewhat depressed, especially the ones who had\nno family. Were some who very busy reading. Do you -- have you heard about Ruth Klueger?",
        "A: She was in my room.",
        "A: She was one of my kids. And she is in a category all by herself. She wasn\u2019t the eady -- easiest\nperson. She wrote a book, as you know.",
        "A: She had a very bad relationship with her mother. And she upsets me because her mother\nsaved her life. I talked to her after she wrote the book. And she -- in her book she\u2019s -- only has\nbad things to say about her mother. And I can\u2019t help myself, I\u2019m thinking about my family, my\naunts, what I would give if they had survived. And she\u2019s spewing all this venom, who actually,\nher mother saved her. Without her mother, she would not have survived. But she is -- she was\nway beyond anybody else in intelligence, reading, she was devouring everything. And she had a\nfriend, Hannah Ungar, who 1s now in Australia, which I didn\u2019t know, Ruth Klueger told me. And\nthese two, they were like this. And Ruth, she hated every -- she hated her father, she hated her\nmother, she hated her relatives.",
        "A: No, she was -- it was -- was sh -- it was clear that she had a bad relationship with her mother,\nthat was clear. But except for ha -- ha -- for Hannah Ungar, they -- they were very close. But the\nrest of the girls completely left her alone. She was in a category all by herself.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t give me too much trouble, and she -- it\u2019s interesting how she -- she refers to me in\nher book without name, but as somebody who is not much older than she was -- I mean, she\u2019s a\nfew years older than I am, and who was in charge of the room. But it wasn\u2019t anything\nderogatory, or anything complimentary.",
        "A: I was just there, I was just there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: A little bit, but not much, you know how you learn a language just to get by a few things. I\u2019d\nhardly know anything any more, but I -- I never really tried very hard.",
        "A: Well, they all spoke some English. Once you became friends -- English, some German.",
        "A: Once you became friends, they accepted you, they spoke German to you.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, they all speak -- I mean, the educated Czechs all speak German.",
        "A: And -- but they hate German, like I hated German.",
        "A: Yes, but I can understand them better, because when I came out of the camps, I spoke English\nvery well, and I had to speak German to my mother, and to my family. And my mother learned\nEnglish very fast here. But if I could avoid German -- th-the language itself just grated me, you\nknow, it brought back so much, and I hated everything German. And I think Hans helped me a\nlot. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t go as far as the Israelis who were trying to shake, you know, to -- to be\naggressive to a pianist who is playing German music, but I couldn\u2019t stand anything German,\neither.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Well, he was very good at it. I don\u2019t remember that he made any mistakes. And he was very\nbright. It was not a very festive thing for me, and I\u2019m sure it was a terrible thing for my father,\nbecause it brings -- brought it very much back that where\u2019s a -- where\u2019s my mother, and etcetera.\nBut it was just something that he wanted to do, and my father -- I don\u2019t recall whether my father\never said to him, you know, why do you have to do it. My father was such an agnostic, it didn\u2019t\nmatter to him.",
        "A: He wanted to do it, yeah, he wanted to do it.",
        "A: No, there was no synagogue, but there was a room that was used for services.",
        "A: And there were some rabbis, and there was, you know, I forget what that was Kline, or who --\nwho coached him, I don\u2019t remember. I have -- would have to make it up, I don\u2019t remember. The\nreason, excuse me, I think I don\u2019t remember is, don\u2019t forget, this was very close to the time when\nwe were deported to Auschwitz. And somehow there, lots of things became a blur, you know.",
        "A: Not \u201943. We were deported 1-in \u00b044.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but still, you know, there -- so many things happened, it -- 1t seemed a short time.\nMaybe it was a year, but I don\u2019t remember exactly. Maybe I wasn\u2019t totally with it. And I don\u2019t\nremember who the instigator was. I can\u2019t believe it was Louis, who was in charge of his room,\nbecause Louis was an agnostic too. But somebody must have persuaded him he should make his\nBar-mitzvah. And my father was in a room on a -- 1n a different street, in a different house, with\na couple of guys who were quite Orthodox [indecipherable]. So whether they had an influence,\nthey probably had an influence. But I can\u2019t recall that. I don\u2019t want to claim anything I can\u2019t be --\nyeah.",
        "A: I think that it -- th-that\u2019s what it was to a large degree. I mean, I started to learn\n[indecipherable] in Israel. I mean the -- in -- in Terezin. I really wanted to go, if we would get\nout of this mess, I wanted to eventually go to Palestine. There was no Israel then.",
        "A: And I really wonder if I would have ended up in -- in Palestine 1f my mother hadn\u2019t survived.\nBut I found -- I felt that it was just too much to ask my mother to go to th -- what was then\nPalestine, the conditions, and for her to learn Ivrith would have been a lot harder than to -- you\nknow, she knew a little English. I think the idea probably wo -- came to me because when you\nhave been persecuted, you just wonder whether you can exist among non-Jews. You feel so\nvulnerable, the idea that there could be a country where people are of your make-up, and\nwouldn\u2019t persecute you because you are a Jew. There is something attractive to that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, maybe that\u2019s why I don\u2019t remember the Bar-mitzvah too well. Yeah, sure.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah, that was the worst day I ever experienced in Terezin. One day we were all\nherded into the Bauschowitz basin. And the reason for that was given by the commandant of the\nSS, that th-the elder had not given the right numbers of inmates.",
        "A: Yeah. And then I think he just had some venom against Edelstein, who was a wonderful man,\nand he also, if I remember it correctly, I think accused Edelstein of using his bicycle and riding\nbeyond the borders of was permitted in the ghetto. And they herded us into the Bauschowitz\nbasin. And it was a very drizzly day. Young and old, and some of these old people were in such\ndecrepit condition, and we were supposed to be counted, because the count didn\u2019t jive, as far as\nthe SS was concerned. And we had to stand there at attention for hours and hours and hours with\nthe rain coming down. And SS were stationed -- the basin was like a flat area, and it was\nsurrounded by a dirt wall, and they were positioned on the dirt wall with machine guns, etcetera.\nAnd we were sure we\u2019re all going to be murdered right there on that -- in that basin. And you\nknow, they -- they were beating people up, and they were screaming and they had their guns\ndrawn, they were very intimidating, and it was just horrible. And everybody thought this is it,\nwe're going to be executed. And then eventually, was already beyond dusk, I don\u2019t remember,\nwas very, very late, we were all herded back into the ghetto. And I don\u2019t remember how many\npeople were in Terezin at the time, but the ghetto was very full of people. What -- I\u2019ve to --\nforget what the height of the population was, 40,000 or something like that. And that was about\nit, because after we came back, shortly after, there were lots of transports going east out of\nTerezin. And while we were in the Bauschowitz basin, the SS searched the -- the houses, the\nyouth homes. They ripped out mattresses and I don\u2019t know what all, they were looking for\nvaluables. Then they had the excuse that somebody had hidden valuables and money, because\nyou were not supposed to keep any of that. And actually, I understood -- I was not a witness to\nthat, that in fact in one place in our building, that they found some money somewhere, and that\nthat person was taken into the Kleine Festung, which was a notorious prison. But I -- I was not\nan -- an eyewitness to that, I was an eyewitness to when we came back and everything was torn\napart. Yeah, that was a very scary time. It was -- it was awful.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, and I met him a few times, not that he had any interest in Uschi Pawel -- Uschi\nLenneberg, but there were occasions that he came to the youth home and stuff, and I thought he\nwas a very nice, mild mannered man. Not everybody in the Judenrat had the same reputation.\nMurmelstein had a terrible reputation. And you see, that is the justice of the world. Who\nsurvived? Rabbi Murmelstein.",
        "A: And he had the reputation among us that he was hand in glove with the SS. And Edelstein\nwas deported to Auschwitz, and so were many of the others. And one of the people on the\nJudenrat, Zucker, was on our transport, and also sent right into the gas.\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: Uschi, yeah. Well --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. I still have -- I still have that\u2019s -- I should -- why didn\u2019t I bring that? Buschi -- well,\nwhen -- you mean in Terezin the birthday party?",
        "A: Yes, I remember that, but I was thinking about another birthday party --",
        "A: -- in Merzdorf, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, the kids made all kinds of little presents for me, you know, handmade.",
        "A: Yes. And they -- they put on a play for me, and it was a complete surprise, and my brother --\nand he -- ya -- ma -- wrapped up little tiny things, things that probably my father got for him, and\n-- and he put on it, Fur meine liebe schwester.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, this was my chil -- my kids, and my father and my brother.",
        "A: And maybe Louis and a few of the betreuer, but I don\u2019t remember exactly --",
        "A: -- but it\u2019s the kids that made the big impression --",
        "A: -- because they had -- you know, had this play that they made up, somebody had written it,\nand I don\u2019t even remember the -- to be truthful, the contents of the play, I was so overwhelmed\nby the whole thing.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- they could have because I had a lot of friends there, and they could have done it\nwith the -- all kinds of excuses, you know. Apparently there were a few people helping them,\nyeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I remember everything because my kids were part of some of this.",
        "A: Not that they volunteered, I mean, they were just told. The Red Cross was going to visit, and\nwe had what was called verschonerung, beautification. And first of all, they had a huge transport\nleaving Terezin, to make the town look less crowded, that was the first thing. Then the\ncommandant felt he didn\u2019t want any ugly and old Jews in the streets. So when he saw like an old\nperson, or -- some of his deputies went in and rounded up old people, and they came into the\nnext transports. And transports were going constantly, to the east. Of course we know now they\nwent to Auschwitz. And then people were given the job to clean the streets, they actually\nscrubbed the streets, the sidewalks, with soap and water. They got paint, they painted the houses.\nThey started to build a -- an area and decorated it with flowers and green to make way for the\norchestra. And another one for the band shell. Then they -- they established a caf\u00e9. And they\nwould just go and say you -- I mean, some good looking young women, you, you, you, you\u2019re\ngoing to be the waitresses. And these waitresses were strutting around with little white doily\naprons, and you know, those curlicues, stupid stuff in their hair, and they were going to wait on\ncustomers in the caf\u00e9 house. They -- some of our kids were rounded up, and they had to approach\nthe SS Kommandant, who was an awful guy, and call him uncle. I wasn\u2019t involved directly\nmyself, I just visited all this, I just saw all that. One thing I did see, that the elder, our elder, was\ndecorated with a gold chain and a new suit and Nazi limousines were chauffeuring him around\nwith the people from the Red Cross.",
        "A: Yeah. And so it was -- it was a stage and we were the actors. And they were planting flowers\nall over, and the band was playing. And then they started -- they established a bank -- I\u2019m trying\nto remember, a store. And -- and they made this fake Theresienstadt money, which on one side\nhad Moses with the 10 commandments, on the other side it had the -- you know, the ghetto in\nkrone, I think it was, 20 - 50 or what krone. And then the transports, which were always coming\nand going in Terezin. You know that they confiscated all the suitcases. Well, they took some\nstuff out of these suitcases and they put this -- this stuff in the stores to be sold, supposedly. So\nthe Red Cross got the impression they have a this store and a that store, and they have a bank,\nand they have the -- they have a barber and they have a beauty parlor and so on, and so on. I\u2019m --\nit was unreal. Houses were scrubbed and painted. And then these idiots from the Red Cross,\nthat\u2019s why e -- e -- ev -- ever since I came out of Terezin, I have no good word for the Red Cross.\nThey would -- they were dined -- wined and dined by the SS, and riding around in the SS\nlimousine through Terezin. Do you think they got out once to ask anybody a question? Or to try\nto go into one of the houses? I mean, they didn\u2019t even go into the barrack, nevermind these\nindividual houses, where old people were put in the attic, like my grandmother. And they had not\nany more space than that rug in the foyer there, to just spread their blanket, and -- during the\nheat, or the cold, or whatever. And so these -- so many people died in Terezin in -- in those days,\nit -- before -- even before -- died before they had a chance to transport them to Auschwitz.",
        "A: N-N-No, they -- they were in the car, and if they walked around -- they might have walked\naround and strutted around where the band was, and where everything -- the SS wanted them to\nsee. They -- I didn\u2019t see it myself, but they might have walked into the bank or stuff and -- and\nconvinced themselves that this was a wonderful Jewish town where, you know, Hitler schenkt\nden Juden eine stadt. Where Hitler was giving the Jews a present of a -- of a -- of a town. And\nthey swallowed it all, lock, stock and barrel.",
        "A: Oh yes, and I rem -- I knew Kurt Gerron very well.",
        "A: Kurt Gerron was a filmmaker from Holland, and he was rounded up by the Nazis, and he was\nbrought to Terezin. And Kurt, I don\u2019t know whether he originally came from Holland, but I am\nquite sure I remember that he was -- he was arrested in Holland. At least that\u2019s what I was told. I\nsee him with -- this reminds me -- of course, this was 1944, of all his equipment, making this\nfilm. And, you know, as I said before, we were a stage, we were the actors. My kids were -- were\nin the films. And as soon as Kurt Gerron had finished the film, he was put into a transport to\nAuschwitz, and perished. So yes, I will never forget that.",
        "A: I think he came to the youth home. I also came to know him -- not -- you know, we were not\nfriends, but I spoke to him because he wanted s -- he needed some of the kids to be part of what\nhe was filming. And some of the kids had been selected, I don\u2019t remember it was the SS or who,\nthey needed so and so many kids. And some of my kids were in that. And I didn\u2019t even see the --\nthe elder, that he had this gold chain on. My kids told me that. You should have seen him, he had\n-- he had a new suit, and a gold chain, and he was being driven around, you know, as a mayor of\nthe city, with the Red Cross.",
        "A: Oh God. No, I -- and we all feel that way, I mean he came from -- from Vienna, and Dita and\nLouis, and Dita still is my very good friend, she still lives in Boston, and Louis we lost many --\nbefore Hans died, many years ago. And di -- Dita came from Vienna. She hated this guy. I mean,\nnobody liked him. But he survived. And he collaborated very much with the Nazis.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, I happened to be in his room --",
        "A: Yeah, and he got it, 1t wasn\u2019t sent by mail. These notices were given to the elders, they were\neither the room elders or the house elders. My father was in Q 600 dreizehn, I think it was, 613\nin a -- it was like a private home originally. And the elder -- I was visiting my father in his room,\nand the elder comes in and hands him the summons from the SS that he has to present himself on\nsuch and such a date, and he changed color. And I never forget that. And then we had a big\nstruggle, and -- and it was my fault, and -- and it haunted me for years and years. And I pressed\nhim that we should join him. And I should have never done that, and he fought me tooth and nail.\nAnd I said to him, \u201cWell, what was the purpose of you and Bubchen going with me? And then\nnow we\u2019re going to be separated again. I mean, the idea was that we were going to stay\ntogether.\u201d So I decided that Papi is going next week, and I am going the week after, and Bubchen\nis going to be all by himself. So we went with him, supposedly to a labor camp near Dresden.\nSee, that was the terrible thing, and they say that Murmelstein knew where we were going, and --\nand he helped the Nazis by facilitating, you know, their mirage, we were going to a labor camp.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, he -- all I can tell you is that when he came back from Zossen, which is near\nBerlin --",
        "A: -- where he worked in Tiefbau supposedly, what was it, for the bunker --",
        "A: -- that Hitler\u2019s bunker, and he came in touch with a lot of other workers from different camps,\nhe seemed like a changed person. But he also knew that transports were leaving Terezin on a\ndaily -- on a daily is too much, but at -- on a weekly, or sometimes daily basis, to in quote, other\nlabor camps. So maybe he also felt that we are all going to be getting out of here sooner or later,\nand now we at least know where we are going, and I can\u2019t recall at all, I might have it in my\nbook, what the name of the labor camp was that we were supposed to go to. It was near Dresden,\nand my father was familiar with the name, and that sounded pretty good. And this -- we were\ntold that by the -- by the elder, by Murmelstein, that our transport was going to that place. And I\nremember when we were on the train, which eventually ended up in Auschwitz, my father and\nsome of his friends were looking through, you know, it\u2019s trying to see where they were, which\nwasn\u2019t always possible, and they f -- one of them said, \u201cOtto,\u201d to my father, \u201cwe\u2019re not going,\u201d --\nit\u20191l come to me, the name of that place, \u201cwhere we can\u2019t possibly go there, we\u2019re alya -- already\neast of Dresden.\u201d And that\u2019s when he changed color, and when it probably sank in, we\u2019re not\ngoing to a labor camp, we\u2019re going east of Dresden, we\u2019re going to go to one of the camps in\nPoland, and I think that -- this is conjecture, I have no proof of that -- I think that maybe he did\nmeet up with people. He told me that there were people from different -- different ghettos, or\nwhatever he said, who were working with him on the bunker. And so I think that he got a good\nidea what was going on in some of the eastern camps. But I really feel that he believed that our\ntransport was going to a labor camp near Dresden.",
        "A: Yes, I did, and he didn\u2019t want me to go.",
        "A: But -- I won, unfortunately, and believe me, it\u2019s laid on me --",
        "A: -- for -- it still does to this day. Because then I figured if we hadn\u2019t gone, because there were -\n- we were not the last transport to leave Terezin, as you know, but maybe we would have had\nenough of a respite that we would have stayed. And my father was such a strong, healthy man,\nthat maybe he would have had a chance to survive. What I really think happened -- and this\nagain, 1s conjecture -- when we got to Auschwitz, of course you know women and men had --\nwere separated, and my father was with my brother, and my brother was in his winter coat, it was\nPoland, and it was October, and you know, that he had outgrown, and he didn\u2019t look like a -- you\nknow, very big teenager, and I think Mengele, who happened to select us, probably put my\nbrother on one side, and my father on the other, but my father, I\u2019m sure, would not have let his\nson go alone, and maybe said can\u2019t I go with my son, not knowing where he was going. Maybe\neven if he had known where he was going, he wouldn\u2019t have let my brother go alone.",
        "A: Yes, at the very beginning oc --",
        "A: -- of October.",
        "A: Yes. It was at the beginning of October, yeah.",
        "A: No, I -- believe me, it\u2019s been on -- it\u2019s been -- and you know, I want to tell you something, I\nnever discussed this too much with my mother. She asked me questions and I told her the truth.\nAnd I don\u2019t know, maybe I camouflaged it a little bit, but I couldn\u2019t even talk about it, because I\nreally felt that burden for such -- for the rest of my life.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: [have my brother and my father [indecipherable] deaths, and I feel I\u2019m responsible that they\naren\u2019t here any more.",
        "A: But it was the wrong thing to do. Was absolutely the wrong thing to do, cause he really didn\u2019t\nwant us to go with him. Of course, we didn\u2019t know that we were fairly close towards the end of\nthe war. We didn\u2019t get -- you know, that\u2019s been -- so many times there were hopeful news, that\noh, the allies are here, and there, and the Russians are very close, and -- and it never\nmaterialized. So we really didn\u2019t know. But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s done, you know, it\u2019s a long time. Ma -- ma\n-- as you get older and you have sons like I do, who are now -- my oldest son is the same age that\nmy father was when he was killed. You know, I mean, you -- you get from his history, he was a\nstrapping man, he was -- he could do anything, whether it was carpentry or -- or digging ditches,\nor what. Physical work -- not everybody was able to do that. People collapsed, people gave up\nbecause they couldn\u2019t do it. Well, he could. But we came to the point, and I think I had a part in\nit where you couldn\u2019t -- there\u2019s nothing you could do.",

        "A: I know, my husband talked to me.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you how I found out that they were killed. You know, we got off the train, and\nwe had to form in fives, and I remember trying to look back to see my father and my brother.\nThis was a huge, huge transport, enormous. All I could see is a sea of people. And then looking\ndown towards the camps, all I could see is high tension wires, and barrack after barrack after\nbarrack. And then we were pushed again to walk past this elegant looking SS officer with shiny\nboots and leather gloves, either pointing to the left, or to -- pointing to the right. I didn\u2019t -- I\ndidn\u2019t know what that meant. I followed where he pointed to. And then we had to form in fives\nagain, and there was an SS man to the left of me, and he pushed us into this muddy road, which\nwas snaking between camps. And whenever a transport arrived in Auschwitz, nobody was\nallowed to get out of the barrack. But somehow a woman was outside of the barrack, very close\nto the electric wire, and recognized somebody in our transport, and screamed out a name, and\ncried. And this SS man, who was next to me, fairly young, maybe 18, something like that, with\nhis rifle drawn, screamed at her, \u201cGet in or PII shoot you.\u201d And with that he shot her. And she\nscreamed, and she was lying there, literally in the mud, pooled in her own blood, and I was\nconvinced then I would never get out of there alive.",
        "A: Ihave ne -- had never seen a person being shot. There were people being killed in Terezin in\nthe Kleine Festung, but I was not witness to it. And apparently there were some people shot in\nthe basin when we had the counting, but I didn\u2019t -- nobody close to me. That was the first time I\never saw a person being shot point blank. And that is something I will never erase out of my\nmind. And I think this is when I decided, not consciously, to just not even see what was going on\naround me. And then we were, as you know, we\u2019re put into a s -- brought into a sauna and\nstripped of everything. Our hair was shorn, our body hair was shorn and w-we were screamed at.\nI never forget that sauna for the rest of my life. It was a very large room, it was a brick building,\nand there were SS lined -- male SS lined on both sides of the walls, making dirty jokes. You\nknow, we were all naked while we were being shaved. And that is too much for anybody to even\nthink reasonably. I mean --",
        "A: Prisoners shaved us.",
        "A: No, they were too busy. And -- and they couldn\u2019t even tattoo us any more because by that\ntime they -- they couldn\u2019t -- they had so many transports coming in, they weren\u2019t tattooing any\nmore. They did these idiotic things. They gave us dirty dresses, no underwear, no socks, just\nwooden clogs and a dirty dress, and this is the -- Poland, the winter, in October. And then we had\nto get past another prisoner who had a -- a can of red paint, and put a stripe of glossy red paint on\nthis black, lousy rags that I had on. I mean, really idiotic things. And then they pushed that into\nthe muddy road again, it was still raining, and that\u2019s when we ended up in Birkenau in one of the\n-- the barracks. And they couldn\u2019t cope with all the people they had. Buschi claims we were\neight on a cot, Zdena says we were seven on a cot. It doesn\u2019t matter. We could -- nobody could\nturn without everybody else turning. And we never saw utensils. We -- there was one dirty\nblanket to cover all of us, and it was so filthy it was horrible. And then the next morning, people\ncame in to -- or the next day some time, they brought in some soup, some -- you know, in -- in a\nbig canister, and they dished it out into metal dishes, and each plank bed got one metal dish, and\nwe had to use our hands to eat, and it was quite liquid, that stuff. And whoever could shovel it\nthe faster -- in the fastest got the most. But I don\u2019t remember whether it was the same day, I think\nit was the following day, that there were a few people who threw themselves against the electric\nwire. And men came in to pick up the dead, and -- with pushcarts. And one of the men was a\nfriend of mine, and he knew my father, too, he was in our transport. And he -- his wife was also\nin my camp, and he whispered to his wife, \u201cTell Uschi that Walter and Otto didn\u2019t make it.\u201d And\nshe told me that. And from that day on, I never had any hope that my father or my brother had\nsurvived. And then, years later, the Holocaust museum, my brother and my father\u2019s names are\nright there. The wonderful Nazi records --",

        "A: You mean in Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. I think I was too occupied with myself. I was too new in -- in Auschwitz. I didn\u2019t\nknow people well enough. The only thing that is really imprinted on my memory is this incident,\nI don\u2019t know if -- if you read it in my book, when we had selection and the Hungarian girl fled\ninto our barrack. I don\u2019t -- and I also learned from other prisoners, and I really didn\u2019t believe it,\nthat they were doing experiments on people, and I didn\u2019t believe that either. I just -- I mean, I\njust could not comprehend some of the things that I heard.",
        "A: No, that I believed.",
        "A: I believed that, and I -- and I know that my friends from Terezin, the Hirschfeld\u2019s wouldn\u2019t\nhave told me that my father and my brother didn\u2019t make it into the camp, that was right after I\narrived. And I learned from others in the camp that people were being gassed, and that -- that this\n-- there was a horrible smell in Auschwitz, too.",
        "A: But I think I experienced that more when I was selected for work. Well, before I was selected\nfor work, we had this horrendous experience with the Hungarians girls. They were fairly young\ngirls, and there was as -- some of these people who had been in Auschwitz for any length of\ntime, they didn\u2019t look like human beings any more. They\u2019re called the musselmen, a -- I don\u2019t\nknow where the heck that came from, but they were really walking skeletons. And their skin, and\nthe expressions on their faces, and their eyes, th -- cannot be described. And next to our barrack\nwas a barrack that housed Hungarian women. A lot of young women, who had been there a\nrelatively long time for Auschwitz, you know, a number of months, and they have been through I\nthink what -- two selections before, so there were no older people left in that barrack, they were\nall younger pl -- people. But they were coming closer di -- to the description of these musselmen.\nThey were in terrible shape. And they had a selektion, and of course, I did -- never heard of a\nselektion, we had only been in these barracks for a relatively short time, and they were shooting,\nand we thought this 1s it, they\u2019re going to just shoot everybody around. And then one of the girls\nmanaged to get into our barrack. And apparently another girl was killed, was shot by the SS, but\nour elder, our block elder knew this girl, and they had been in Auschwitz for a long time, and\napparently she has -- had escaped selektions a number of times. And here we were fairly new,\nand all this was -- we were being told all these horrors that I couldn\u2019t digest. And here, I will\nnever forget this girl, she\u2019s standing there at the end of the barrack, and the block elder, who\nseemed like a pretty brutal woman herself, was shielding her. And she told us that she\u2019d been\nthere for such and such a time, she\u2019d been selected a few times, and that people were being\nselected after they were not physically strong any more, and they were being gassed. And she\ngave such a vivid description and she told us about how many of her friends had been -- had\nbeen gassed, that it finally dawned on me, ma -- maybe this is true. Maybe this is so. It wasn\u2019t\njust when you come there that they select you like Mengele, but they select you afterwards. Now\nthat was -- that wa -- made a terrible impression on me. And then shortly after that, we had a\nselektion for work. And it was a fairly large table outside, and it was pretty cold, and we had to\nall strip naked again, and walk in front of this table. And there was a man, a representative from\nindustry at one end, and two SS officers at that table. And he selected very few people. And we\nwere kind of standing in line, naked. And when I got to this man from industry, he asked me to\nshow him my hands, which I did. I -- I don\u2019t have a very small, fancy hand. And then h-he\nmotioned obviously that he was going to take me for work at the factory he represented. And the\npeople selected for work, as I said before, were a relatively small number. And we were then\npushed into the road again, and you know, we had -- we could put a -- we only had a dress\nanyway, put our dress on, was pushed into the road. And we were put into a s -- we were in front\nof another sauna, a bath house, and by that time, I believe that people were being gassed, because\nwe could smell the burning flesh, really. And when the SS guard told us that we had to strip\nnaked before we even got into the shower house, the sauna, I really thought that was it, because I\nalso had learned that people were gassed in a sauna, that the gas came through the shower heads.\nSo it was welcome when we felt the ice cold water dripping on our skin. And we again just got a\nshift, and no underwear, no socks. And we were pushed into the road and we ended up in a\nwomen\u2019s camp, which had mostly non-Jews in it. I believe they were all Polish, at least the ones\nI saw. The elder was a Pole. And they had different insignias, which I learned there designated\nwhether they were political prisoners or murderers. And I understood from people there that the\nblock elder was a murderer, that this particular triangle or whatever she wore, represented the\nidentification of a murderess. And she was very brutal, and horrible, and she beat people very\nreadily. And she s -- put -- she gave us different chores to do, and one of the chores that she\ndished out for me, was to carry the feces to the latrines during the night, with another woman,\nand accompanied by a Nazi guard. You know, the women were not SS, they were Nazi guards in\nuniform. And I shall never forget that night. It was a very dark night, and there was a horrible\nsmell, and the whole sky was bright red. And these very tall chimneys were spewing particles\ninto the air. And the woman who carried the buckets with me, who had been in Auschwitz a lot\nlonger than I had, she said, \u201cAnother transport must have arrived. These are our people going\nthrough the chimney.\u201d You know, a normal person would have collapsed right there and there,\nand I don\u2019t think things really penetrated. We had much better bedding and plank beds. They\nwere the same size, but instead of, you know, eight people, or whatever, or seven or whatever we\nwere on one, there were three of us. One was Zdena from Prague, and one was Buschi from\nAmsterdam. And we became friends for life. And one day we were told to get ready for work\nand we were marched to the railroad trestle, and we were put into a transport. And I cannot recall\nhow long we were on transport, but then the trains stopped eventually -- because we were in\ncattle cars, and there was really no way -- you know, some cattle cars were older, and they were -\n- you -- you had an idea, looking through some of the little spaces, but there weren\u2019t too many\nspaces to be found. And we ended up in a place called Kudowa-Sackisch. In other words, we had\nbeen going west, not east. This was an airplane factory, and the man who had selected me\nworked -- was a representative of that airplane factory. And I never forget that night. We were so\nhappy. The beds were better, the blankets were wonderful, the food was better. And, for the first\ntime, we had shower, a hot shower, and we got a piece of soap. And then the next morning we\nhad to form a circle in the factory yard, and the German foreman stepped into the middle of that\ncircle, and he looked around, and he decided he didn\u2019t like anybody to work for him in the\nfactory who wore eyeglasses. I wore glasses and Zdena wore glasses, Buschi did not. And he --\nwe stepped forward. At first I didn\u2019t want to step forward. And Buschi said to me, \u201cHaven\u2019t we\nplayed enough fate?\u201d You know, and she was referring to my volunteering to go with my father,\nand my father and my brother going with me, and I put my glasses back on. And of course he\nselected me to step forward, and Zdena step forward. And then for some reason, he told Buschi\nto step forward. And you know, either Zdena or I said to her, \u201cBut you don\u2019t wear glasses.\u201d So, I\nnever forget Buschi\u2019s words. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s fate. It\u2019s supposed to be that way.\u201d \u201cDas ist das\nSchicksal. Es soll so sein.\u201d And there were six of us, and he called us garbage, rejects, who were\nnot going to work in his factory, and we were going to be sent back to Auschwitz. And we were\nrounded up by a woman, a Nazi guard, but she was different from any of the guards that we had\nencountered. She didn\u2019t scream at us, she was kind of nice, she ki -- she somehow behaved as if\nshe didn\u2019t belong there. Now, I don\u2019t know what her history was, whether she wad -- was drafted\ninto that, who knows? But she -- she took us to the railroad trestle, and then I did something I felt\nterrible about for a long, long time. And Buschi and Hannah and Zdena were very upset with me,\nbecause they felt very strongly that I had saved their lives. It wasn\u2019t just -- there was one other\nwoman. There were two other women who felt the same way, but we kind of lost contact after\nliberation. And I pleaded with this guard, and I told you she seemed more accessible, because I\nwould have never dreamt to do this in Auschwitz with any guard. And I pleaded for my life, and\nI told her that I shouldn\u2019t be there. I was really not Jewish. My mother was a Christian and I -- I\nshouldn\u2019t be here. And she answered in a way like somebody would who really felt badly about\nit. And she said, \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d \u201cKann nicht sta fur mat -- kann nicht\ndaran tun.\u201d And then she left us, asked us to -- first she asked us to stay together, there were six,\nwe didn\u2019t know the others. And she was flirting with two German soldiers who were\naccompanying the train. In the meantime we realized that there was one other German woman,\nshe had lived in Prague. We never got too close with her, she was much older than most of us.\nAnd there was another Czech woman, Hanka, she was a communist, through and through. And I\ncan say that I never felt a relationship with Hanka. I mean, we all helped each other, but it wasn\u2019t\nthe same relationship I felt with Buschi and Hannah and Zdena. And there was one woman,\nHannah, and we three became very close friends. And then one of the soldiers came to us. In the\nmeantime -- I must say this first, there were hundreds of inmates on the railroad trestle. They\nwere Hungarian workers who had worked in the factory, and who -- they had worked these\nwomen practically to death. They could hardly stand, they had open sores, impetigo, whatever it\nwas, they were in horrible shape. And they had been pushed by the SS into cattle cars until the\ncattle cars were full to the brim, and then they locked the cattle cars. And our guard had stayed\nwith us in the meantime, and then had gone over to the soldiers, and the SS had left. Because I\nthink that we were the responsibility of that Nazi guard. And then one of the soldiers came over\nand told us to follow him and he put us into the last cattle car. And we were the only six in this\nhuge cattle car, and then he locked the cattle car. And I have no idea any more, and I\u2019m not sure\neven would have had an idea when we came -- when we finally ended up in Merzdorf, how long\nwe had been in the cattle car. But the soldiers finally opened the door and joined us 1n the cattle\ncar. One was relatively young, and you know, the -- Hannah thinks this guy was this old, I don\u2019t\nremember. And the younger of the soldiers cried, and he told his buddy that if his people did that\nto human beings, he didn\u2019t want to live any more. And they gave us bread, they gave us cheese,\nthey gave us privacy. I mean, we hadn\u2019t seen white bread for years, and cheese. And they gave\nus privacy to use a bucket. And we sat in this huge cattle car in one corner, and deciding what are\nwe going to do when we return to Auschwitz. And the only language that Hannah, Zdena, and\nthe -- and the other Czech girl, and I and the -- the -- the German girl we didn\u2019t have too much\nclose relationship with, spoke, was German, because they were all educated people, and this --\nmost of the Czechs spoke German, and of course the Dutch do. And Buschi\u2019s family originally\ncame from Germany anyway, so I don\u2019t remember whether she had some German grandparents\nor what. And Buschi and I decided that we were going to throw each -- ourselves against the\nelectric wire instead of being gassed. And the German soldiers heard that, you know, we spoke\ntheir language. And the train came to a standstill. I have no idea what they did while we were in\nthe cattle car before the train left Auschwitz -- left the labor camp that we had been in before.\nThey must have spoken to the engineer of the train. They must have coordinated it somehow. But\non the other hand, you have to realize that this was the very beginning of 1945, and things\nweren\u2019t looking too great for the Germans. So they told us to jump out of the cattle car and\nfollow them. And when we got onto the platform, we realized it said Merzdorf, it did not say\nAuschwitz. And we followed them through the small village of Merzdorf. It\u2019s a very\nmountainous region. It\u2019s a beautiful region. It was very cold. It was probably the very beginning\nof January, with snow and ice on the road. And here are these decrepit looking women, with a\nthin shift, and wooden clogs, no hair, following uniformed German soldiers through the village\nof Merzdorf. And the villagers were coming out of their doors look -- staring after us. And we\nwent through a big gate, into a work camp. It said, \u201cKamsta, Mettner and Frahne,\u201d it was a\nfactory. They made linens there, which we later found out, from the original raw material of flax.\nAnd they told us to wait, and then they went to see the commander of the camp, who was a\nwoman. The most vulgar looking woman I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, Anna Rinke. She might only\nhave weighed 300 pounds, I remember her weighing 400 pounds. She was tall and big. She was\nbursting out of her Nazi uniform. And she stood in front of these soldiers, quite a ways from us.\nWe were on one side of this very big area, within the factory buildings -- yard, and -- and they\nhad to get into her place on the other side. And all I remember her coming out and screaming at\nthem, \u201cI don\u2019t want them here, get them out of here, send them back to Auschwitz. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nAnd they stood in front of her, they gave the Nazi salute, they clicked their heels, they left us\nthere, they never looked back. So, with all my hatred for Germans, we owe our lives to these\nsoldiers. And not a letter or a telephone call for many years, whether it was from Hannah, or\nZdena, or Buschi, without questioning if we only would know the names or where these people\nare, they saved our lives, I\u2019m sure at a considerable risk to themselves. But again, they probably\ncouldn\u2019t have taken that risk 1f we would have come there much earlier than we did.",
        "A: She had no choice.",
        "A: The train was gone, we had no choice, I guess.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was told that in the camp by some of the people who had been in the camp longer than we\nwere, and especially by the Hungarian girl. And they described him to me, and I remember him.\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t have recognized his features. I don\u2019t think I would have had the guts to look\nin his face.",
        "A: And I only later learned that there were other physicians or SS who were selecting. But I was\ntold, and I took this, that they knew what they were talking about, that these transports were\nselected by Mengele. And I was told then, for the first time, that -- by is -- people, you know, in\nthe camp, who had been in Auschwitz much longer, that they were doing experiments on people,\nwhich also didn\u2019t penetrate my he -- my brain. I mean, I -- I didn\u2019t know what they were talking\nabout.",
        "A: Well, that I don\u2019t know. You tell me.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I had a pair of glasses, they had a pearl matte frame, and I had them when I left\nDisseldorf. I was very careful with my glasses because my vision was very poor since my birth.\nAnd I can\u2019t comprehend it, because here I\u2019m in this country with wonderful technology, and it\nwasn\u2019t too long ago, with a different pair of glasses than these that I was accompanying a friend\nto the hospital and the lens fell out on the floor. And these glasses lasted. I think they were\nthicker glasses in those days, the frames were thicker, I don\u2019t know. I was very careful with them\nbecause they were part of my life. I can\u2019t see without glasses. When I was in Terezin, I had a\nspecial place for them on my bunkbed, and the girls would never go into my bunkbed, that was\nmy bunkbed. When I was in Auschwitz, I didn\u2019t take them off at all, ever. When I came into the\nnext camp, where I\u2019ve met Buschi and Zdena, I also kept them on the bunkbed, or on my nose.\nAnd the same in Merzdorf. And believe me, I was really frightened that something could happen\nto them. But I wasn\u2019t beaten up ever, which would have caused them to be thrown on the floor,\nso they somehow survived.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yeah, but they --",
        "A: I -- I kept my glasses.",
        "A: They must have been on my nose, because if I had them -- I don\u2019t recall putting them in my --\nbut the same thing with Zdena. Zdena came from the sa -- it was a ta -- same transport as I, and\nZdena wore glasses, and they didn\u2019t take her glasses either. They took the glasses, of course, of\npeople who were gassed. So, whether they took glasses routinely of people they were sending to\nwork, would it make sense to take glasses away from people you want to work -- for -- who --\nwho have to work for you? I don\u2019t know. But of our six, Zdena and I were the only ones who\nwore glasses, I think. Hannah doesn\u2019t wear glasses. So while the others were -- he probably\ndidn\u2019t like them. One of them was pretty short. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s, you know -- I\nhave --",
        "A: It\u2019s a mystery. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s an absolute mystery.",
        "A: No, I have no clue. And I was very -- I was very much aware of the necessity of guarding my\nglasses, yeah.\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Zdena.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, Hilde is Buschi.",
        "A: Right, that was her nickname.",
        "A: Yes, we met in that women\u2019s camp, which was mostly all -- not all of them, only Buschi and -\n- and Zdena and I, and then we met the other ones when we were round -- when we were\nrounded up in Kudowa, and we were rejects.",
        "A: But only -- only Zdena and -- and Buschi and I met in Auschwitz. And Hannah and -- and the\nothers two, we met when we are all rejected.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I think that Hanka, who -- just to differentiate her from Hannah, she was Czech, and sh\n-- I\u2019m sure she was a communist. I mean, we all knew she was a communist. I -- I had nothing to\ndo with her -- with her communism, but her whole manner and all this, I\u2019m not sure that if it\nwould just -- just been Hanka, that we would have become very good friends, okay? But we were\nthe six who were selected to be sent back to Auschwitz. And so we really stuck together. My\nclosest friends were Buschi and Zdena and Hannah.",
        "A: And the other two, Hanka and I forget the other name, the -- the other German woman, she\nhad lived in Prague for awhile, she was considerably older, and I was the youngest of the whole\ngroup. They called me das Kind. And Hannah, when they used to call home, and Hans would\ntalk to -- they would never talk to each other that how is Uschi, [indecipherable] macht das Kind,\nyou know. The Czechs speak some German too, but the -- my husband very seldom spoke\nGerman, but it was always when they referred to me as th -- some Kind, you know?",
        "A: And -- and Hannah is still kidding about it, yeah.",
        "A: It became a family. Zdena and Buschi and I worked outdoors in transport, and the other girls\nworked in the factory and I don\u2019t think that we three could have survived without the girls in the\nfactory, because they stole flax and -- and yarn, and we made warmers to put in our wooden\nclogs, on our head, and chest warmers, and I think that was a horrible winter in those mountains,\nand I don\u2019t think we could have survived. We supported each other constantly. We more often\nfound something in the garbage at the railroad station because we had to unload coal cars, and\nflax cars, than they did. They had no way to get anything. And anything we found we would\ncarry back to the camp and divide it between the six of us, we would never eat it alone. If\nsomebody was sick, we supported them. We -- it was taking your life into your own hands if you\n-- if you even went to the so-called doctor, who happened to be a -- a dentist. There were no\nmedicines anyway, and I never was sick except for one day when I\u2019m sure I had a fever and I\nwas ready to topple over, and Sunday were wonderful days in Merzdorf for Anna Rinke, she\nwould torture us standing for hours and hours. It was very cold, and I was ready to pass out. And\nboth Zdena and Buschi were much taller than I was, especially Zdena was very tall. And sh --\nZdena stood in front, and Buschi in back and they literally supported me. Because to -- to -- in\nthose -- at that time still, if you told them you were sick, I mean, there was always a danger they\ncould transport you back to an extermination camp.",
        "A: No, it was unique.",
        "A: I think we were unique, and then we were the last ones to arrive in Merzdorf, and there was a\nlarge cons -- contingent of Hungarian women there, who were constantly fighting which 1s --\nwhich -- with each other, or cooking together, you know, imaginary cooking. And they were --\nthere was -- there were a few Germans -- German Jews, but the rest of them were all Poles,\nPolish Jews. And they didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with us, especially the Polish Jews,\nwho had been there much longer than any one of us, so any new person who arrived was just --\nthey probably felt depriving them of food and so -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very hard to understand,\nwe were all Jews, but we -- we were not supportive of each other. I hate to say this, but that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s the way it was.",
        "A: I saw conflict, and I didn\u2019t -- I did not see a group that stuck together the way we did. And\nsome of the Polish Jews who had been there for a much longer time, some of them had better\npositions, some of them worked in th -- in the kitchens, and they knew each other, and they\nwould give food to -- to others, you know, who came from similar background. But relatively\nspeaking, we were not in aush -- 1-in Merzdorf that long. From January to liberation, which\nseemed like a lifetime, but without that friendship, you know -- and I was very lucky that I was\nasked to spread salt, rock salt on the scales. The s -- some of the stuff coming in had to be\nweighed, and the scales were all frozen, they weren\u2019t working, so I was given the job of\nspreading rock salt. So I reasoned, if cattle can eat rock salt, why can\u2019t we? And the camp had\nrun out of salt for months. And that is very weakening whe -- when you have to work. So I\nstuffed my pockets full of rock salt, and the six of us lived off that rock salt until liberation. And\nwe -- we dug up horse -- we f -- I found -- I don\u2019t know if I found, or Buschi, or one of us found\na horseradish patch, which we dug up. And I think the Nazi guard probably realized we were\ndoing it. And it was coming towards the end of the war, and one of the worst guards ever, we\ncalled her Pigface -- and I knew there was hope one day when I was coming up the stairs onto\nour dormitory and the SS were a fl -- a flight above, and she was coming down the stairs,\nPigface. She looked like a pig. She was very brutal and horrible, and she had this porcelain dish,\nwhich had sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, that\u2019s all I remember, there might have been\nsomething else on it. She shoved that onto me, and she said, \u201cFriss.\u201d\u2019 Now friss is -- is a word that\nis not used for human beings, that shows you what she thought of us. You only talk frisson about\npigs, about animals. There is a big distinction in the German language. So I was on the level of\nan animal, but at least something was in the wind. Pigface was giving me her dish with food, and\nI was delighted, and I carried it up to the dorm, and of course we all shared it. And we thought\nthis was a good omen.",
        "A: I was very, very thin, but I think I was relatively healthy. I -- I th -- I think -- I know that\nBuschi and Zdena and I were healthier than the other three girls, and -- and I believe that it was\nthe fresh air, and the physical work, even though we got very little to eat, I mean, watery soup.\nBut we did find some discarded carrots in the garbage, and we found some turnips in the\ngarbage, and we ate grass. So that somehow -- actually, I was stronger, and Buschi too, even\nthough she was quite a bit older than I was, even than Zdena. Because after liberation, they all --\nw-we got these six bikes from the Russian officer, and we were all going to bike to Prague, and\nthe girls couldn\u2019t do it. Only Buschi and I. Even Zdena got weak, but Buschi and I were able to\ndo it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, we separated in -- at the border, because Hannah suffered a heart attack, and we had to\nleave her at the hospital. So that we decided, Buschi and I, that our plan was to go with a -- our\nCzech girls to Prague, and then take t -- public transportation. But a Russian officer told us there\nwas no transportation, nothing, and his advice is everybody should go back to the country that\nthey came from, to their home. Well we had no home, we told him. Well, he said, \u201cWell, you\nhave to go back to the country you came from and then try to get out of Europe.\u201d And si -- that\u2019s\nwhat we -- we did. We separd -- separated at the Czech border, when the girls had to go south to\nPrague and we went on, destination Lippborg, which was the designation of a little village my\naunt lived in, and my parents had said, \u201cIf you get separated, we meet at Aunt Minchen\u2019s house.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We were fr -- we -- we heard a lot of commotion the night before of valises being dragged a-\naround and -- and there were trucks outside on the -- on the ground -- the factory grounds. And\nwe were, you know, we were not allowed to open windows, everything was closed, the windows\nwere locked, and some of the Hungarians were imagining we were all going to be gassed in\nthere. This is why they locked all the doors and everything. They were came -- became very\nhysterical. And then it was the next morning, after our -- the SS and the guards, everybody had\nfled, that the door was opened by a German soldier, who appeared all alone, and said, \u201cMeine\nDamen, sie sind frei.\u201d \u201cMy ladies, you are free.\u201d We looked at each other, we\u2019re looking for the\nladies. And we couldn\u2019t believe it. And we -- of course, we didn\u2019t believe him. And he was a\nGerman, how could we believe him? And it was Maurice and his -- his Belgian friend, and also\nprisoner, who we had befriended, especially I had befriended Maurice very much, and he had\npromised me he would take me through the meadows, who literally had to drag us out of there.\nAnd to --",
        "A: He was a French prisoner, a prisoner of war. These were two prisoners of war. There were\nmore than two, but these were the two that we ha -- occasionally came in contact with, who kept\nour spirits up, and -- and that wonderful advice. If -- everybody was afraid they were going to put\nus on a forced march, and don\u2019t go on a forced march. I never even thought of a forced march till\nMaurice kept saying this. And I said, \u201cWell, how can we refuse it if it\u2019s going to be enforced\nwith machine guns?\u201d Well try everything, you know. But he said that\u2019s going to be the death of\nyou because it was, you know, pretty horrible weather. So --",
        "A: Yeah, we didn\u2019t. Fortunately they decided to -- to flee.",
        "A: I think the Russians were coming in too fast, because the -- the German soldier opened the\ndoor, and the -- I think the Russians were coming in the afternoon. And the first Russian soldier\nwas on a bicycle, believe it or not. And he -- you know, he was just trying to find out what was\ngoing on, and -- and he later identified himself as Jewish. But a lot of these Russian Jews, they\nweren\u2019t very Jewish, you know, they -- but he said he was really born a Jew, too.",
        "A: Right. Yes, Buschi and I -- the bicycle that -- bicycles that were given to us, we -- by the\nRussian officer, we -- we avoided the main roads, and we found a German s -- a dead German\nsoldier. Buschi found him. We usually picnic at the side of the road, secondary roads only,\nbecause we were warned not to take the main roads. And he had a map in his -- in his pocket,\nand that map got us all the way to -- I mean, got Buschi to Holland.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we followed that map. Had swastikas on it, but it follow -- it -- it really helped. It\nreally helped. It was a very, very good map. And we -- we sh -- sought shelter, and we stayed\nwith people, and I must say, in the Russian -- what is now the Russian -- what used to be the\nRussian zone, East Germany, people were much nicer to us. I think they were scared to death.\nMost of them had fled, and they were scared to death of the Russians. But there was one place\nover the Mulde River where we had to cross, that was a separation line, the demarcation line of\nthe Russian and the American forces, and the Russians let us go over. Half the bridge was\nRussian, half American, the we -- Americans wouldn\u2019t let us cross. And we pleaded, and we\ncame back, and came back, and I think it was two or three days later, Buschi finally persuaded\nthem -- we -- we both spoke English, but Buschi\u2019s English was better than mine at that time. And\nthey told us to come back the next morning, and if they are busy on the field telephone, we\u2019d\nbetter follow their instructions. Well, we got to them exactly when they said we should be there,\nand they were busy on the field telephone, and they said, \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d And we sure\ndid get the hell out of there. We -- we bicycled like the devil was after us, and we were in the\nAmerican zone. And then we -- I\u2019Il never forget Dresden, never. I mean, the lamp posts were like\nstraws, and the -- everything was in -- in horrible condition. I mean, the pictures that my husband\ntook of Kassel -- and of Kassel too, we came through Kassel, is exactly what we saw. And we\njust had one goal, I mean, to get to Lippborg, and for Buschi to get to Holland. And I won\u2019t go\ninto any detail, you don\u2019t have the time, but you know, in my book I go into all these details, and\nif you want any other details, you can ask me.",
        "A: And I remember going over the river in Kassel, the Mulde, and I really thought we wouldn\u2019t\nmake it. I mean, the bridge was so bad, it was so bombed out it was just horrendous, but we\nmade it. And eventually, I mean after bicycling for almost a month, and one incident was we\nwere almost overtaken by Russian soldiers who -- who thought girls were a nice catch at that\ntime, and the Russian officer saved us there. But when we came close to -- to Lippborg, which is\nfrom where we started out from, about 500 miles by bicycle, in our condition. We -- there is only\none street in that village, called Dorfstrasse. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s pretty hilly, and we were pushing our\nbikes up Dorfstrasse, cobblestones Dorfstrasse. And it has a very narrow sidewalk, and I saw a\nwoman who was carrying a big load of wash. She had gray hair and I recognized that woman,\neven though I\u2019d remembered her with jet black hair, it was my mother. And she recognized me\ntoo. But she came over, and she just barely embraced me, she just her hand on me, but she was\nlooking back. She was expecting some others to follow me. She was looking for my father and\nmy brother. And before she said anything else, she said, \u201cPapi,\u201d which we called my father, \u201cand\nBubchen are not coming back?\u201d And then she screamed. \u201cMy child is back.\u201d \u201cMein Kind 1s\nzuruck!\u201d And the villagers came out of their houses, and everybody asked, because we had\nvisited my aunt so many times as children, you know, where\u2019s your father and where\u2019s your\nbrother. And we stayed 1n lip -- I mean, Buschi stayed in Lippborg for I don\u2019t remember exactly,\nmaybe a couple of weeks, and my grandmother and my aunts, you know, they bro -- they -- first\nthey got everything going, hot water, and they didn\u2019t have, you know, automatic hot water, they\nhad big stoves and they were heating up the kettles, and -- and the big bathtub on the huge\nkitchen tile floor, and then Buschi and I were getting baths with -- they were scrubbing us, and\nmy grandmother was saying, \u201cWell you know, you still have to go over the neck, and they are\nstill filthy over here and there.\u201d And they discarded our clothes, they gave us new clothes, and\nthey nursed us back to health. And they persuaded Buschi to stay longer than he -- she had\nwanted to, and then Buschi had to go back to Amsterdam, she had to tell her in-laws that she, the\nJew survived, and that her husband, their only son, was killed by the Nazis. And Buschi and\nHannah stayed friends for -- and I, we stayed friends for life. And finally my mother and I were\nable to come to this country in 1947, and I shall never forget that -- the er -- S.S. Ernie Pyle\ntaking us into New York harbor, and that Statue of Liberty, and I think that most immigrants\nnever forget that picture, you know. They all think like I did, she\u2019s giving a special welcome to\nus. So, it would have been nice if we could have come here in \u201948. We would have had -- our\nfamily would have been together, but that was not to be.",
        "A: In *38, yes.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry. But that was not to be. And I love this country, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a wonderful country, and\nI met my husband here.",
        "A: And two boys.",
        "A: Yeah, a wonderful stepfather, who I must say I liked, but I don\u2019t think I appreciated him as\nmuch as I should have. I think I missed my father so much that there was such a resentment that\nhe didn\u2019t survive. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, we had a very good relationship, but sometimes I\nfeel maybe I could have been more loving to him.",
        "A: The boys only knew one grandfather --",
        "A: -- that was Siegmund, who could not have been more wonderful if they had been his own\ngrandchildren. And they loved their grandmother. So that\u2019s my story.",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019re welcome, it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- 1t\u2019s a wonderful thing you are doing, and --\nand I\u2019m very appreciative.",
        "A: Well, yeah, I -- somehow, sometimes it\u2019s harder than others.",
        "A: You know, I talk about it. \u2019'm not talking about it as much any more as I did. I can\u2019t write\nHans\u2019 story and keep going out and --",
        "A: -- and it\u2019s -- I do it at [indecipherable] Valley college. I think it\u2019s so important. We are busing\nin 3000 kids every year, and we can\u2019t -- we don\u2019t -- many, many more want to come, and it\u2019s a\nwonderful program. And we have speakers, and we have a discussion group with survivors, and\nrighteous and liberators. And I think it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a wonderful program, but I\u2019m not sure how much\nmore I will do going to individual schools. It -- it does take a lot out of me, mm-hm.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. You\u2019re -- you\u2019ve been great, you\u2019re a wonderful interviewer.",
        "A: And I have given very few interviews. I have given some after the book was published, to,\nyou know, television stations, etcetera, but you are unique, you\u2019re very, very wonderful. And the\natmosphere is just -- how can you top this?",
        "A: You can\u2019t top this, this is wonderful.",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019re welcome.\nEnd of Tape Nine\nBeginning of Tape 10",
        "A: My mother, (1) Lina Lenneberg. She called herself Caroline when -- after she came to this\ncountry. Approximately 1925.",
        "A: (2) My mother and I. I was a very young child, and I don\u2019t know exactly how old I was.\nUrsula.",
        "A: My father, (3) Otto Lenneberg.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s either 1935 or \u201936. There is no date on the picture, so this is my guess.",
        "A: My father -- my -- excuse me, my mother\u2019s brother Konrad, my (4) Uncle Konrad Schneider.\nAnd I was a small child, and I loved him very much.",
        "A: (5) My parents, and I was a baby, and that was taken in Dortmund, so it must have been 1926.",
        "A: This shot was taken on the roof garden of Karstadt. And this my (6) baby brother, who was\nborn in 1930, and myself, Ursula.",
        "A: 7\u00b031.",
        "A: This 1s (7) myself, and probably 1931, also on the roof garden of the Karstadt building in\nAplerbeck.",
        "A: This is approximately 1936, it my -- my (8) brother and I and this is already in Dusseldorf. I\nthink it\u2019s the outskirts of Dusseldorf.",
        "A: Yes. I wore glasses since I was in kindergarten.",
        "A: This is my brother, (9) Walter, and this is probably 1939 or 1940, in Dusseldorf.",
        "A: This is my (10) grandmother Lenneberg, my father\u2019s mother. She perished in Terezin.",
        "A: This is a (11) card written by my brother Walter from Theresienstadt. These were cards which\nprisoners were encouraged to write to give the impression that we were in a wonderful place.\nAnd it was supposed to go to either relatives, or Germans, to give the impression that we were\nreally living in a wonderful Jewish town. So what he wrote 1s really what he was allowed to\nwrite.",
        "A: Yeah. See, at that point, it was already Hauptstrasse. They had changed the Q\u2019s and -- so this\nis -- this is what, instead of 1114 now I ha -- I remember, now it\u2019s Hauptstrasse, it was -- 14.",
        "A: This is the (12) fake money that was issued in Terezin for the benefit of the Red Cross\ninspection of Theresienstadt in 1944.",
        "A: This myself, (13) Ursula Pawel -- Ursula Lenneberg, sorry. Pr-Probably 1940, in Dusseldorf.",
        "A: This was a (14) blanket issued to me in Merzdorf, and it had my number on it. I never had a\ntattoo, and the number was -- was embroidered on the blanket. I carried that blanket all the way\nfrom Merzdorf home. I still have that blanket, and I have cut the number out, because I used it\nfor some demonstration.",
        "A: This is (15) Orange, Blanche, Bleu, which is a Dutch flag. The roads were very insecure after\nliberation. There was still fighting going on by partisans, and anybody who spoke German was\ntaken into custody. And my life was threatened after liberation. So my Dutch friend Buschi\nsuggested that I do not speak at all, that I was in shock and I lost my ability to speak. And -- and\nI was -- we were both Dutch, and we made these -- these flags, and put them 1n our clothing and\ne -- we made a little bigger ones and put them on our bicycles. The old manuscript pa --",
        "A: That was taken in Deggendorf, in the displaced person camp after liberation, and as you can\nsee (16) I gained quite a big of weight. I was very thin when I came out of the camps, and it took\nme, I think, a couple of years before I went back to normal. I really blew up like a balloon after\ngetting proper food.",
        "A: Yes, those are the same glasses. I don\u2019t think I got new glasses until I eventually came to\nDisseldorf, and I think they were terrible. Yeah, they made it through the whole ordeal.",
        "A: I believe that was taken (17) in either Diisseldorf or Munich, and it was after the war. I think\nit was 1946. I still had a pretty full face, but I think I was getting down to more normal\nproportions.",
        "A: This is my husband (18) Hans Pawel, and this is in 1948, when I met him. I only knew him\nsix weeks and we got married.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",

He was a physician and he attended soldiers in the trenches\nof Verdun in World War I, and his country gave him the Medal of Honor for that, des Eiserne\nKreuz 1\u201c Klasse.
