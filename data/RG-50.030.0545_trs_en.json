        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nEllen Zweig, conducted by Judith Cohen on March second in Leisure World in\nSilver Spring. Let\u2019s start by telling me your name at birth, as it was in Germany,\nthe names of your parents.",
        "Answer: Okay. The \u2014 my name was Ellen Seligman, it\u2019s spelled with one n, s-e-I-i-\ng-m-a-n. My mother\u2019s name was Rose Hirschfeld was her maiden name, and my\nfather was Julius Seligman.",
        "Q: And did you have any siblings?",
        "A: I had one sister, younger than me. Her name was Margit.",
        "Q: And where were you born, and your date of birth.",
        "A: I was born in Regensburg, Germany, which is right on the Danube, in May\n18, 1929.",
        "Q: And how long had your family lived in Regensburg?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s family go back to the 1800s, I believe. I know like 1890 or earlier.\nMy father\u2019s family I think came to Regensburg when he was a young boy. They\ncame from a town called Lambsheim, which 1s near the Rhine. And they opened\nthe store there in germ \u2014 in Regensburg.",
        "Q: Tell me something about the first couple years of your life, you remember,\nbefore the Nazi takeover. We\u2019ll start with what sort of store your father owned \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 and what sort of cultural activities, religious activities that your parents were\ninvolved with.",
        "A: Okay, yeah [indecipherable] yeah. Well, they were pretty assimilated. My \u2014 my\nmaternal grandparents had a department store called Teats, which was sort of a\nchain store. They \u2014 they had combined buying powers, I believe, and it was a very\nnice store, I remember that, it had several floors. And after my parents got married\nin 1928, my father opened another store in the suburb. And they were well off, I\nhave to say, I mean, I would say middle upper class, you know. And we had a good\nlife, that\u2019s all I can say.",
        "Q: What was your hou \u2014 what did your house look like?",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we had a flat, we di \u2014 never lived in a house. Even my grandparents\ndid not have a house. It was a big flat. My father had a car. We had a ri \u2014 th-the \u2014\nthe house we lived in had three stories I \u2014 I remember, and it had a big garden. And\nit was a \u2014a very nice place. And you know, we \u2014 we went on trips, wa \u2014 like I said,\nmy father had a car, we could go in the summertime. This was before 1935, I would\nsay. We would go skiing in the winter, we g \u2014 we would go sw-swimming. Mostly\nin the rivers, but they had special places where you could go swimming. My parents\nMarch 2, 2010\nbelonged to a tennis club \u2014 before all this happened, you know, when they were still\nable to do that. S \u2014s \u2014",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and it \u2014 so when I \u2014 or when I entered school in 1936, I guess, I had to go to a\nJewish school, I could not go to a public school.",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s go back a little bit. What was your parents\u2019 social circle like before\nthe Nazis? Did they have German friends 1n addition to Jewish friends?",
        "A: I\u2019m su\u2014I\u2019m sure they did, because when they played tennis, you know, at this\nparticular place, it was like a little country club, I guess, and I\u2019m sure they did. I\nwas too young to remember all that. The only thing I can tell you, my mother\u2019s\nsister, who was younger than she was by three years, met her husband through\ntennis, and he was not Jewish. And even though my grandparents weren\u2019t happy,\nShe married him in 1934, I think.",
        "Q: Oh, after the Nazis had taken over.",
        "A: Yes, yes, uh-huh, yeah. And he was a very nice man, he was a lovely per \u2014 man\nand he was from a good family, they were Catholic. And he helped my grandparents\nin a way, because they moved in with my grandparents, and in a way, because of\nhim, you know, things didn\u2019t \u2014 weren't bad for them.",
        "Q: Did he face any, you know, problems \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Yes, he did.",
        "Q: \u2014 from rossenshonda(ph) and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, well, he did. Well, this \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 this happened after we left, my parents and I left Germany. They eventually\ntook him to camp, or to a\u2014 a workplace, because he wouldn\u2019t divorce her. And my\naunt at that time had two little boys. I\u2014 my \u2014 my older cousin I remember. One was\nmaybe five, and the other one had \u2014 was born after we left. She moved in with her\nin-laws, they took her in with the two children. And she \u2014 they were living in\nMunich, and then she went back to Regensburg where her in-laws were living,\nafter everybody had left, 1941, I guess, \u201940 - \u00b041. And because my family was so\nwell known in Regensburg, and dote \u2014 we had a lot of farming communities\naround there, they brought her food.",
        "Q: And let me ask you a little bit more about this German uncle. What was his\nname?",
        "A: Fritz Brem, b-r-e-m.",
        "Q: And did he survive the war?",
        "A: Yes, he did. They all survived the war.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "Q: Did his family support him after the marriage to your aunt, or was he disowned,\nor \u2014",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 he had \u2014 he had a profession. He was a director of a \u2014 a mine that \u2014 I\n\u2014 I\u2019m not quite sure, kalkswag(ph) it was called. And he was a director of it before,\nand after the war the Americans put him back in a director. So, you know. Although\nhe did e-encounter still anti-Semitism, even after the war.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s move back to your own immediate family.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You were still fairly young, but what\u2019s your first memory of life under the\nNazis?",
        "A: Well, you know, like I said, I was rather young. I \u2014 I just do remember though,\nmy father had a Catholic secretary. And since my parents couldn\u2019t take us to things\nlike movies, you know, and \u2014 she would take \u2014 take me. And the sti \u2014 I faintly\nremember that she once took me to a program, you know, in December, before the\nChristmas, they have this Saint Nicholas in Germany, and it was very Catholic\nparty, and where, you know, they c \u2014 would come around and \u2014 and ask all the\nchildren, you know, have you been good, and so forth. And later, I understand \u2014 I\nwas told this story, that somebody came up to this woman who had \u2014 who was not\nMarch 2, 2010\nmarried, and said, who is that nice little girl with you \u2014 that nice little Aryan girl\nwith you? And it was me, because I had blonde hair and blue eyes. So, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Any idea what she responded?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know whether she di \u2014 she said her niece probably, you\nknow, something like that, so, you know. But she was a \u2014 a wonderful person and\neven after the war she kept in touch with my family. Her fa \u2014 her brother was a\npriest and she eventually went to work fo \u2014 with him, or was his housekeeper. So \u2014\nand after the war, we \u2014 my parents got together with her again. In fact, she came\nover here once with her brother on a pilgrimage.",
        "Q: And do you have any other memories of your childhood under the Nazis before\nyou emigrated?",
        "A: Well, I think my family kind of shielded me from this. I do remember that the \u2014\nthe Jewish community in Regensburg found a place \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a ga \u2014 actually a g \u2014\na sports place where we could all go and congregate on the weekend, or on Sunday.\nAnd you know, th-the \u2014 we could play and you know, 1-it wa \u2014 it wasn\u2019t exactly a\ncountry club, but it was a place where the Jewish families could go and have an\nouting, and things like that. I remember that. It was far out into the suburbs. But,\nyou know, it gave us a place to go when we weren\u2019t allowed to \u2014 to commingle with\nthe other population. So, you know, and we would play sports there, and so forth,\nMarch 2, 2010\nyou know. So \u2014 but that \u2014 other than that, I mean I \u2014 I never really \u2014 until\nKristallnacht. That \u2014 that \u2014 then \u2014 then of course, things cha \u2014 really changed.",
        "Q: Yeah. Tell me your memories of Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Well, I do remember that there was a knock on our ap-apartment at six in the\nmorning. But of course my sister and I were in our \u2014 were in our bed, and we didn\u2019t\nget out of bed. But there was a knock on our door, and they came to get my father. I\nmean, that\u2019s all I know. I mean, you know, at that \u2014 that time. And we \u2014 I really\nwasn\u2019t privy to anything, and my mother probably spoke with my grandmother.\nAnd eventually we moved, we went to my grandmother\u2019s house and stayed with\nthem \u2014",
        "Q: And why did \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 while he was \u2014 actually my father was not taken to concentration camp,\nbecause he had had a broken leg the summer before. So he took his two canes with\nhim, and because of that they kept him in the town jail with all the older people, for\na week. And after that they \u2014 my grandmother was very active in the community\nand she got him out. Also her \u2014 my grandfather, and their son, were sent to Dachau.\nBut my grandmother, as I said, was very active in the community, and she actually\nwa \u2014 this I \u2014 this I was told, went to the Nazis, to the \u2014 to the police, and said,\nseveral of our men died, we need 10 min \u2014 10 people to have a minyan. So this \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010\nand my grandfather, I think was, came back, and my father was let out, and so forth.\nThey were \u2014 they did let people out. I don\u2019t think Regensburg was \u2014 there were N-\nNazis, but I don\u2019t think it was like in some of the other towns, that they were so\nawful. Now, I do have a picture here that shows my father in a cart, being marched\nthrough the town. You know, they took all the men that day and marched them\nthrough the main street. It was called Maximilianstrasse, I remember that, before\nthey took \u2014 sent them off to either Dachau or the \u2014 or the prison. I have a picture of\nthat.",
        "Q: And did your father ever describe his emotions after the war \u2014",
        "A: No, not really \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 or discuss this photograph with you?",
        "A: Not really. Not really, no, no, he never did, uh-uh. Only thing I remember, when\nhe was let go, an-and we were co \u2014 we came home \u2014 when we knew he was home,\nand I remember him sitting at the \u2014 at the table in our family room, shaving off his\nbeard. Course, he had a growth of beard for the \u2014 from the whole week, I guess. So\nI remember him sitting there shaving his beard, that\u2019s what I remember.",
        "Q: And what happened to the store?",
        "A: Well, my father was able to sell his store. Now th \u2014 I think he sold it already\nbefore that. My grandfather still was really plundered. That was plundered and all\nMarch 2, 2010\nthe windows were smashed, and I think I once saw a little bit of it. But like I said,\nmy family, I think they shielded us, you know, from this. They didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nwant me to see it or whatever, you know. And of course, our synagogue was burned\ndown. The schoolhouse that we \u2014 I attended, that\u2019s next to the synagogue, that was\nnot burned, only the synagogue.",
        "Q: And did you witness the fire?",
        "A: No, no, we lived too far away. No, we lived too far away, yeah.",
        "Q: And right after Kristallnacht, when you tried to go to school \u2014 why don\u2019t you\ntell me a little bit about schooling, when you had to move to a Jewish school,\nwhether it was close \u2014",
        "A: Well, I started right from a Jewish school, I never went to any other school. It\nwas na \u2014 ah \u2014 ah \u2014 it was intermittent, because I think our teacher left ha \u2014 where is\n\u2014 it was a one room schoolhouse, basically, all the grades together, you know? And\na \u2014 th-they were \u2014 there was intermittent because the teacher that finally came to\nour school came from the neighboring town called Straubing, and he had to come\non the train. And if the train was late, he was late, so, you know, schooling was\nintermittent. So, actually I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember too much about that. I mean, it was\nbasically I guess from \u2014 we were suppose \u2014 well, we were supposed to leave in \u2014 in\nAugust of \u201939, or September of \u201939, and just when the war \u2014 we had packed\nMarch 2, 2010\neverything up, after my parents had made special furniture, small for here, because\nthey knew the apartments here were much smaller, and we moved in with my\ngrandparents and then the war broke out. And it was \u2014 we were supposed to go by\nway of England.",
        "Q: Okay, before \u2014 I want to talk about emigration, but let me ask one other question\nwith this school; did they shut the school down after Kristallnacht?",
        "A: No, not really, that I remember.",
        "Q: So you were able the next day to just come back to school?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember it was \u2014 it was the next day or it was a few weeks later. I\nreally don\u2019t have any recollection of that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Okay, let\u2019s talk about emigration. Do you remember listening to your\nparent talk about wanting to leave Germany, and what those discussions entailed?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: When they first wanted to leave [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 oh, well, I mean, we knew we were getting ready to leave, and that \u2014 like I\nsaid, my parents, you know, had special furniture made that would be smaller. Beds\nthat would go up into the wall, you know, things like that, because they knew here it\nwould be a smaller place where we would be able to live.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "Q: And do they have any trouble getting emigration visas?",
        "A: No, my father had a brother here, who had been here since 1926, I think, and\nthrough him we had the affidavits. And we had numbers to go to the consulate in\nStuttgart. And we did go there, you know, we had to have clearance as far as\nhealth was concerned and all that. So I remember going to Stuttgart where the \u2014\nwhere the American consulate was, and you know, being checked out and we \u2014\neverything was okay, and we had the visas. Before nine \u2014 before September \u201939.",
        "Q: And then \u2014 describe what \u2014 you were saying that you were supposed to go to\nEngland and the war broke out, so \u2014",
        "A: Well, yeah, I mean, that \u2014 that \u2014 then the whole thing got scrapped because we\ncouldn\u2019t leave, we a-are \u2014 we had already packed all our things, so we moved in\nwith my grandparents. And the \u2014 the correspondence that I found after \u2014 actually\nmy father\u2019s death many, many years later, was regarding \u2014 the Americans evidently\ngave us a hard time because there were four of us, and my father\u2019s brother here\nwasn\u2019t making enough money, although he worked for relatives here, and the \u2014 the\nones \u2014 was very reluctant to put his name down that he would support us in case he\ndi \u2014 we needed to. So, I think they finally persuaded him, si \u2014 but we never took a\npenny from him, but just to put his name on the \u2014 on \u2014 you know, this \u2014 America\nwas in a depression at that time, so my uncle had a hard time convincing them that\nMarch 2, 2010\neven if we came here, he \u2014 we would not be a burden to them. So, you know, that \u2014\nthat I remember. You know, tha-that correspondence I read mon \u2014 many years later.\nMy father didn\u2019t die until 1984. But I found all that in correspondence. And it was\neven discussion about sending me to Switzerland because my father had relatives\nthere, you know, so I found all that.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s come back, so September \u00b039, you\u2019re packed and it falls through. Describe\nthose events, so \u2014",
        "A: Well, you know, I was \u2014 how old \u2014 was \u00b038, I was nine years old.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2014 it really sunk in. I just knew we couldn\u2019t go. In fact, I\nremember a couple times there was alarms if we were gonna get bombed, then we\nhad to go down to the cellar. But other than that, I don\u2019t have much memory of that.\nI know my family kept us busy doing arts and crafts at home. They always found\nthings for \u2014 for me and my sister to do, to keep us busy, I guess, you know.",
        "Q: And then how did you finally get out?",
        "A: Well, we finally got left \u2014 in fact, it was my sister\u2019s birthday, February 18\",\n1940, we took a train to Munich and we stayed in a hotel I remember, and people\ncame to see my father, to give him messages to take us to people that lived in\nAmerica, asking them to help. I think that\u2019s what it was all about. And the next day\nMarch 2, 2010\nwe took a train over the Brenner Pass to Italy, to Genoa. And I remember I was\nvery nervous crossing the Brenner Pass, because you know, I did hear that they\nhad taken people off the trains if they found smuggling anything, you know. If they\nput thing \u2014 people used to hide things in the lining of their coats and all kinds of\nthings. So we were worried about that.",
        "Q: And were you searched when you crossed into Italy?",
        "A: No, we were not searched, but just the thought of 1t made me sick in my stomach\nafter we left. But we \u2014 we got through. My grandmother made sure we had nothing\ncontra, because she didn\u2019t want anything to happen to us.",
        "Q: And then after you arrived in Genoa \u2014",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we had to spend a few days there, and you know, we walked around\na little bit, we didn\u2019t have much money, I guess, I don\u2019t remember exactly. But, you\nknow, my parents \u2014 and the place we were staying was pretty bad. I mean, I know\nthat. And we finally boarded the pip \u2014 th-the \u2014 the ship and I have a picture of the\nship, you know, and \u2014",
        "Q: And this \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was a terrible voyage for me, I got sick as a dog because of the weather. I\nmean, in \u2014",
        "Q: Which month is this? This is \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Si\u2014 February \u2014",
        "Q: Of \u201940?",
        "A: Yeah, by way of the Mediterranean, and the cross from Gibraltar and over to\n\u2014 to the States and we landed in New York.",
        "Q: Is the fact that the war was on, we \u2014 was there any fear of torpedoes or bombing,\nor you just se \u2014",
        "A: If there was I didn\u2019t know, but I barely got out of bed. And my sister, she was\nfine, she went up to eat dinner, she did everything. She was fine, but I was a sick\none, yeah. The only thing I remember, when we got near New York, that my father\nactually carried me up to sh \u2014 see the Statue of Liberty. That \u2014 that I remember.",
        "Q: What was your reaction?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, really, I just remember that \u2014 that part of it, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s talk a little bit about what happened once you got to New York. Did\nyou start school immediately, or did you wait for the next year?",
        "A: Well, no, we \u2014 we actually did not stay in New York. We stayed a few days with\nfriends of ours as \u2014 from \u2014 from Regensburg, had come earlier, and my sister and I\nstayed with them, and my parents were invited to stay with some other relatives\nwho are already very well-to-do, had been here, I guess, for many, many years. And\nwe, immediately after that, took a train to Washington, because my uncle lived\nMarch 2, 2010\nhere in Washington, and the other relatives that \u2014 that they had, that had been here\nmany years always lived in Washington. So we came right to Washington, we\nnever stayed in New York.",
        "Q: And what was your life like as a new immigrant? Did you feel a lot of culture\nshock? Were you able to mix in with the American kids?",
        "A: Well, you know, it was a little bit difficult. I had taken English lessons in\nGermany already, cause you know, my parents knew that was gonna happen. So I\nhad taken English lessons. We went to live with my uncle the first four months or\nso. I mean, he ha \u2014 he had bought a little house, 1t wasn\u2019t a very big house. It was in\na good neighborhood called Glover Park, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar, off\nWisconsin Avenue? And he had a wife and one son, and also my grandmother on \u2014\nfather\u2019s mother had come right after Kristallnacht, they brought her out \u2014 he\nbrought her over here. So they were for \u2014 four, and we were four, eight of us in that\nlittle house. We, my parents and my sister and I all slept down in the basement. It\nwas a built out basement, but we stayed \u2014 you know, we lived there. And we were\ntaken to the elementary school in the neighborhood, which \u2014 and they gave me\nsome tutoring in math, I was \u2014 think I was be \u2014I was like in the fifth grade then,\nbecause you know, I \u2014 I had a little \u2014 little \u2014 didn\u2019t have that much schooling over\nthere, so they gave me tutoring, and they were very nice to us. And then, I do\nMarch 2, 2010\nremember some kids calling us Nazis and stuff, you know, but you know, we had to\nlet go, what could we do, you know? We were here, we were safe, let\u2019s put it that\nway. And the summer, during the summer, through the Jewish Community Center,\nwe were sent to Camp Louise, I don\u2019t know if you \u2014 you may \u2014 so my sister and I\nboth were sent there for three weeks, which was really nice of them to do that, you\nknow, they did a lot, the Jewish community and also the Washington Hebrew\ncongregation, where we finally ended up, which was mostly juv \u2014 German Jews.\nTook us in, you know, so \u2014",
        "Q: When you say took us in, what sort of \u2014",
        "A: Well, let us go to \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 hospitality \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Sunday school, Sunday school. And they had a newcomers club too, at that\ntime that my parents, I think, you know, went to. So, yeah. An-And eventually we\nwere able to get an apartment \u2014 you want me to talk about it?",
        "Q: Sure, absolutely.",
        "A: I think that following September, my parents were able to afford a one bedroom\napartment for the four of us, you know. My father had gotten some work th-through\nsi \u2014 through the relatives that were mostly members of Washington Hebrew, and\nwere in better circumstances. Americ \u2014 they were already a hundred percent\nMarch 2, 2010\nAmericans. And his first job was selling [indecipherable] door to door \u2014 not door\nto door, by recommendation, a company called Real Silk. They sold socks, men\u2019s\nsocks and ties and I don\u2019t know what else, you know, and he was able to make\nmoney, little bit of money, you know, he wa \u2014 he was in \u2014 you know, so \u2014 and then\nGiant Food, Mr. Cohen was very good to the Jewish immigrants here, and gave\neverybody a job. So he worked for them on the weekends. They \u2014 they only had, I\nthink at that time, two stores in this area, but he went to work on the weekends, you\nknow, working there.",
        "Q: And how many immigrants were working there? I\u2019m actually very interested in\nthis, to find out more about how the Jewish community here was helping the\nimmigr \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I really \u2014 I-I know \u2014 I mean, I really don\u2019t know too many, I-I know a couple\npeople that worked with him at that time, but I don\u2019t really remember how many,\nbut you know, he worked there, and then \u2014 so I \u2014 all I know is one time one of them\nsaid to him, if you crack a few eggs, he\u2019ll let you take them home for free. So, you\nknow, he was able to bring home some \u2014 some eggs for us to have, you know. And\nyou know, we managed. My sister and I went to school then. My mother also got a\njob working as a housekeeper for a family. You know, and then she eventually\nfound a job working for a family where she basically took care of the \u2014 the children\nMarch 2, 2010\nwhile the parents were working. So, you know, she \u2014 she had to work too, you\nknow, they both worked, and we were kind of left to our own. At home we were\nsupposed to clean the apartment and stuff, you know? And my sister was a rebel. So\n\u2014 but, you know, we managed it, but th \u2014 after that \u2014 and then what happened, my\ngrandparents, my mother\u2019s parents were still in Germany, and they had a lot of\ntrouble, they had to pay tax upon tax, and they had to repair the \u2014 the store front and\neverything, you know. They taxed them because they did have money. And they\nfinally got out in May of 1940, which was late. And they \u2014 they used to have these,\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the closed trains? They were trains that were\nclosed from Berlin to I think Lisbon, Portugal. Well, by the time they were ready\nto leave, there were no more closed trains, 1t had stopped already. And this is all\nsecondhand, because I heard the story through my aunt who stayed behind, you\nknow, who was married, my mother\u2019s sister was married to the Gentile. They went\n\u2014 they were in Munich, and they went to the airline and she gave them one ticket.\nAnd they just said no, we\u2019re not go \u2014 one \u2014 either we both go or we don\u2019t go. And\nso my aunt said, you gotta shmear them, you know, give them a little money under\nthe table. Maybe tomorrow you\u2019ll \u2014 so she did, next day she had two tickets. I\nmean, there \u2014 there were people that were not bad, they helped. And so they got on\nMarch 2, 2010\na plane and they were able to go to Lisbon, Portugal, and from there they took a\nship, one of those last few out of Lisbon to New York City.",
        "Q: And came to Washington?",
        "A: Yeah, well, they were supposed to stay in New York with my \u2014 with their son,\nwho had come earlier, and he was drafted by then. So they all came to Washington,\nin the one bedroom apartment, in May of 1940. And you know, we managed a hot\nsummer, no air conditioning. And I think in September finally, my family was able\nto get a two bedroom apartment. So my grandparents had a room, my sister and I\nhad a room and my parents were sleeping in the living room. That\u2019s how it was, you\nknow. But we were there from 1941 until 1948. And I went to high school there,\nyou know, out of that milieu, I mean, we managed.",
        "Q: And during the rest of the war years, from \u201940 to \u201945, how much correspondence\nand communication was there with your aunt who was still in Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Well, there were relatives of my father\u2019s who had lived in Switzerland for many\nyears already, had come back long before. And through them we were able to\ncommunicate. I mean, like we sh \u2014 we would send a letter to Switzerland, and I\nguess there was \u2014 maybe send her a postcard saying, heard from, you know,\neverything is okay, and she would write a postcard back, without a return sender,\nMarch 2, 2010\nI\u2019m sure, just to say I\u2019m okay, or something. So that way, they knew that they were\nokay, you know. That\u2019s th \u2014 they were the intermediaries.",
        "Q: And what was your \u2014 do you have any memory of news sources during the war?\nHow you were foll \u2014 how much news was reaching the United States, how you\nfollowed it?",
        "A: Well, like I say, that \u2014 you know, I remember Pearl Harbor, that I remember,\nand you know, during the war, I mean, I don\u2019t think there was \u2014 we didn\u2019t know\nthat much. I mean, nobody really knew it, although I understand, there was corres \u2014\nthat people knew \u2014 well, my aunt in ger \u2014 who stayed behind in Germany told me\nafter the war that when the soldiers came back from the eastern front, the German\nsoldiers, they told her what was going on over there, they knew about it. But of\ncourse, they were afraid to talk, I guess, because they would have been shot too,\nyou know. But she knew what was going on.",
        "Q: Even throughout the war? During the war, this ha \u2014",
        "A: Well, probably a little bit later. Well, there were my cousins, my father\u2019s sister,\none sister, one sister got out with her husband. The other ones didn\u2019t. They stayed \u2014\nthey se \u2014 actually sent their children to England on the Kindertransport. And by\nthe time they wanted to leave, they just couldn\u2019t get out any more. And my aunt told\nme \u2014 this was after the war \u2014 that they came to say goodbye to her, and she knew\nMarch 2, 2010\nwhat was gonna happen. She knew about it. Course, she didn\u2019t tell them, you know,\nthey \u2014 in fact, my cousin who now lives here said to me, she also, through \u2014 they\nhad a very good housekeeper who helped them have \u2014 through, you know, you \u2014\nshe said, her mother went out and had warm clothes made, because she knew they\nwere going east. They were one of the last deported.",
        "Q: And do you know where they were deported to?",
        "A: Yeah, I ha \u2014I think it was Auschwitz, and actually, she just found out not long\nago that her mother was not gassed immediately. Her father was, and he was one of\nseven brothers, and I think five of them, they were gassed imme \u2014 they were older,\nthey were gassed immediately, but her mother was working, sewing or doing\nsomething, and she contracted typhoid fever, and then that\u2019s what did her in. So,\nyou know, but that was my father\u2019s second sister. The first one was able to get out\nand lived in New York City. So, you know. So they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re the only close\nrelatives that we really lost. And they were very Orthodox, you know, they were the\nkind that thought God will help, and you know. It was a big family. The name was\nEinstein, and they were from Augsburg. And they were a \u2014 cattle dealers and they\nwere well-to-do, I mean, they just di \u2014 n-never thought anything like this would\nhappen. By the time they really wanted to get out, they wanted to go to Rhodesia,\nand they wouldn\u2019t take children. So, you know, they just didn\u2019t believe it would\nMarch 2, 2010\never happen, because with their money, they were better off \u2014 well a \u2014 better off\nthan I think my family was. But they just didn\u2019t believe, you know, they were \u2014",
        "Q: And when \u2014 when your father found out about his sister \u2014 how much after the\nwar he learned?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember that, when it was. I-I\u2019m not sure exactly\nhow long it was.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so, before we conclude, I guess, the last questions, did your parents \u2014 did\nyou notice any change after they learned about the war, difficulties adjusting to the\nUnited States, to what extent they discussed this? How much talk was there in your\nhouse when you were in \u2014 already older, in high school, or like college, about what\nhad happened?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think there was too much talk about it. The one thing I should tell\nyou is my mother, unfortunately, when we finally \u2014 they got on their feet, they were\nable to buy a house in 1949, I guess. My mother had gotten sick, and she had\ncancer. So, I mean, that was a real problem, you know. My grandparents were still\nliving with us, her parents, and she passed away in 1950. I mean, I was able to\nfinish high school, but college, I had to pay my own way and I never finished\nbecause, you know, I had to help my father actually, after my mother passed away.\nSo that kind of put a dent in it. And the fact that they were fairly young, we spoke\nMarch 2, 2010\nmostly English in our house. And of course my grandparents weren\u2019t happy with\nwhat happened in Europe and everything, and my grandfather took it very hard\nwhen my mother passed away, so you know. And then I do remember after the war\nwas over that they sent packages over there for my aunt and her family every week.\nAnd they also had another \u2014 a group called self help, and they were mostly the\nGerman Jewish refugees here, that sent packages over to \u2014 to people. Food, you\nknow, to help whoever was left, or whoever survived. I do remember that. So, you\nknow, d-discussion, I really don\u2019t remember that much, that they ever talked about\nit too much. So, you know, luckily that they \u2014 my mother\u2019s sister survived. That\nwas a big thing already, you know. And actually, her brother who ended up in the\narmy, went to see her. I think that was \u2014 happened, you know, after liberation, and\ndid find that she was in \u2014 you know, they were okay, you know, that they survived,\nlet\u2019s put it that way. So, you know, so \u2014",
        "Q: And they remained in Germany throughout the rest of their lives, or did they \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, they remained in Germany. They did come over here. My grandparents\nwere able to celebrate their 50\" wedding anniv \u2014 well, she came over first, I think in\n\u2014 after my mother had passed away already, and then they came over for my\ngrandparents 50\" wedding anniversary. So that was, you know. But my aunt \u2014 and\nshe came back a few more times after her husband passed away, and told me that\nMarch 2, 2010\nafter everybody had left, she had never converted to Catholicism when she married\nhim, but she said, after everybody left, she felt like she needed to belong someplace.\nShe felt alone, you know, and \u2014 not that she was strong in Judaism, but she became\nCatholic.",
        "Q: Did she ever feel any unease living in Germany, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, she did, she did. She said even after \u2014 she had moved to Munich, and she\nhad an apartment there, and she said whenever she came over here to visit, she\nwould never say she\u2019s coming to see her family, cause she didn\u2019t want everybody \u2014\nanyone to know that she was Jewish originally, and said she was coming to see\nfriends. So she did have a certain amount of unease about letting people know that\nshe was Jewish. But we have kept in touch with the cousins. In fact, the children of\none of the cousins just came \u2014 was here visiting with me, and her husband. And you\nknow, my children have gone over and stayed with them. So we have a good rela \u2014\nI mean, they were never Nazi, none of them Nazis, you know. Of course, they were\nchildren too, but \u2014 and we \u2014 my husband and I had visited over there, you know, so\nwe have kept up the relationship, you know. So they know who we are, and we\nknow who they are, and then, you know, they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not strong Catholics\neither, you know. But yeah, we do have the relationship with them, yeah.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "Q: So, is there anything else that you\u2019d like to say, that you feel we haven\u2019t\ncovered?",
        "A: No, I\u2014I think \u2014 no, you definitely \u2014 mother\u2019s mother, my grandmother, was\nvery \u2014 very active in the community, in our town, as \u2014 has rubbed double off on me,\nbecause I have gotten involved here in a lot of community things. I mean, I was\nvery active in BBG, and you know, president of my BBG group, and active in adult\nthings, you know. And I\u2019m active here in the Jewish residence, and now I\u2019m\npresident of a group of widows and widowers, which meets at the JCC, so I think it\nsomehow rubbed off on me to be active and give \u2014 give back.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And if ste \u2014",
        "A: And also volunteer at the Holocaust Museum.",
        "Q: And 1s the fact that you came to the United States as an immigrant affected your\nattitudes about anything, do you think?",
        "A: Well, ?'m \u2014 Tm -\u2014I\u2019ma liberal, let\u2019s put it that way. You know, I\u2019m kind of hope\nthings, and always wish that things would get better here, an-and hope, you know.\nSo, you know, tell my children about \u2014 they know about my background, they\nknow, and you know, that it was hard, I \u2014 you know, I had to pull myself up by my\nbootstraps, and had to pay for everything myself, it wasn\u2019t given to me on a silver\nplatter, so \u2014 although, my parents did get some restitution eventually, but 1t wasn\u2019t\nMarch 2, 2010\nmuch, and you know, basically I had to fend for myself. And luckily, when I met\nmy husband \u2014 he was also from Germany, he was from Hamburg, but he had\nestablished himself over here by that \u2014 he came a little earlier, 1937, and had\nbecome a photographer and \u2014 and had opened a studio, and I felt 1t was my duty to\nhelp him, so I became like the manager of the place. So, you know, we both worked\nhard, and you know, we made a fairly good living, you know. And started all over.",

        "A: Yeah, yeah, well, he did. Well, this \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 this happened after we left, my parents and I left Germany. They eventually\ntook him to camp, or to a\u2014 a workplace, because he wouldn\u2019t divorce her. And my\naunt at that time had two little boys. I\u2014 my \u2014 my older cousin I remember. One was\nmaybe five, and the other one had \u2014 was born after we left. She moved in with her\nin-laws, they took her in with the two children. And she \u2014 they were living in\nMunich, and then she went back to Regensburg where her in-laws were living,\nafter everybody had left, 1941, I guess, \u201940 - \u00b041. And because my family was so\nwell known in Regensburg, and dote \u2014 we had a lot of farming communities\naround there, they brought her food.",
        "A: Fritz Brem, b-r-e-m.",
        "A: Yes, he did. They all survived the war.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 he had \u2014 he had a profession. He was a director of a \u2014 a mine that \u2014 I\n\u2014 I\u2019m not quite sure, kalkswag(ph) it was called. And he was a director of it before,\nand after the war the Americans put him back in a director. So, you know. Although\nhe did e-encounter still anti-Semitism, even after the war.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, you know, like I said, I was rather young. I \u2014 I just do remember though,\nmy father had a Catholic secretary. And since my parents couldn\u2019t take us to things\nlike movies, you know, and \u2014 she would take \u2014 take me. And the sti \u2014 I faintly\nremember that she once took me to a program, you know, in December, before the\nChristmas, they have this Saint Nicholas in Germany, and it was very Catholic\nparty, and where, you know, they c \u2014 would come around and \u2014 and ask all the\nchildren, you know, have you been good, and so forth. And later, I understand \u2014 I\nwas told this story, that somebody came up to this woman who had \u2014 who was not\nMarch 2, 2010\nmarried, and said, who is that nice little girl with you \u2014 that nice little Aryan girl\nwith you? And it was me, because I had blonde hair and blue eyes. So, you know \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know whether she di \u2014 she said her niece probably, you\nknow, something like that, so, you know. But she was a \u2014 a wonderful person and\neven after the war she kept in touch with my family. Her fa \u2014 her brother was a\npriest and she eventually went to work fo \u2014 with him, or was his housekeeper. So \u2014\nand after the war, we \u2014 my parents got together with her again. In fact, she came\nover here once with her brother on a pilgrimage.",
        "A: Well, I think my family kind of shielded me from this. I do remember that the \u2014\nthe Jewish community in Regensburg found a place \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a ga \u2014 actually a g \u2014\na sports place where we could all go and congregate on the weekend, or on Sunday.\nAnd you know, th-the \u2014 we could play and you know, 1-it wa \u2014 it wasn\u2019t exactly a\ncountry club, but it was a place where the Jewish families could go and have an\nouting, and things like that. I remember that. It was far out into the suburbs. But,\nyou know, it gave us a place to go when we weren\u2019t allowed to \u2014 to commingle with\nthe other population. So, you know, and we would play sports there, and so forth,\nMarch 2, 2010\nyou know. So \u2014 but that \u2014 other than that, I mean I \u2014 I never really \u2014 until\nKristallnacht. That \u2014 that \u2014 then \u2014 then of course, things cha \u2014 really changed.",
        "A: Well, I do remember that there was a knock on our ap-apartment at six in the\nmorning. But of course my sister and I were in our \u2014 were in our bed, and we didn\u2019t\nget out of bed. But there was a knock on our door, and they came to get my father. I\nmean, that\u2019s all I know. I mean, you know, at that \u2014 that time. And we \u2014 I really\nwasn\u2019t privy to anything, and my mother probably spoke with my grandmother.\nAnd eventually we moved, we went to my grandmother\u2019s house and stayed with\nthem \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 while he was \u2014 actually my father was not taken to concentration camp,\nbecause he had had a broken leg the summer before. So he took his two canes with\nhim, and because of that they kept him in the town jail with all the older people, for\na week. And after that they \u2014 my grandmother was very active in the community\nand she got him out. Also her \u2014 my grandfather, and their son, were sent to Dachau.\nBut my grandmother, as I said, was very active in the community, and she actually\nwa \u2014 this I \u2014 this I was told, went to the Nazis, to the \u2014 to the police, and said,\nseveral of our men died, we need 10 min \u2014 10 people to have a minyan. So this \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010\nand my grandfather, I think was, came back, and my father was let out, and so forth.\nThey were \u2014 they did let people out. I don\u2019t think Regensburg was \u2014 there were N-\nNazis, but I don\u2019t think it was like in some of the other towns, that they were so\nawful. Now, I do have a picture here that shows my father in a cart, being marched\nthrough the town. You know, they took all the men that day and marched them\nthrough the main street. It was called Maximilianstrasse, I remember that, before\nthey took \u2014 sent them off to either Dachau or the \u2014 or the prison. I have a picture of\nthat.",
        "A: No, not really \u2014",
        "A: Not really. Not really, no, no, he never did, uh-uh. Only thing I remember, when\nhe was let go, an-and we were co \u2014 we came home \u2014 when we knew he was home,\nand I remember him sitting at the \u2014 at the table in our family room, shaving off his\nbeard. Course, he had a growth of beard for the \u2014 from the whole week, I guess. So\nI remember him sitting there shaving his beard, that\u2019s what I remember.",
        "A: Well, my father was able to sell his store. Now th \u2014 I think he sold it already\nbefore that. My grandfather still was really plundered. That was plundered and all\nMarch 2, 2010\nthe windows were smashed, and I think I once saw a little bit of it. But like I said,\nmy family, I think they shielded us, you know, from this. They didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nwant me to see it or whatever, you know. And of course, our synagogue was burned\ndown. The schoolhouse that we \u2014 I attended, that\u2019s next to the synagogue, that was\nnot burned, only the synagogue.",
        "A: No, no, we lived too far away. No, we lived too far away, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I started right from a Jewish school, I never went to any other school. It\nwas na \u2014 ah \u2014 ah \u2014 it was intermittent, because I think our teacher left ha \u2014 where is\n\u2014 it was a one room schoolhouse, basically, all the grades together, you know? And\na \u2014 th-they were \u2014 there was intermittent because the teacher that finally came to\nour school came from the neighboring town called Straubing, and he had to come\non the train. And if the train was late, he was late, so, you know, schooling was\nintermittent. So, actually I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember too much about that. I mean, it was\nbasically I guess from \u2014 we were suppose \u2014 well, we were supposed to leave in \u2014 in\nAugust of \u201939, or September of \u201939, and just when the war \u2014 we had packed\nMarch 2, 2010\neverything up, after my parents had made special furniture, small for here, because\nthey knew the apartments here were much smaller, and we moved in with my\ngrandparents and then the war broke out. And it was \u2014 we were supposed to go by\nway of England.",
        "A: No, not really, that I remember.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember it was \u2014 it was the next day or it was a few weeks later. I\nreally don\u2019t have any recollection of that.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 oh, well, I mean, we knew we were getting ready to leave, and that \u2014 like I\nsaid, my parents, you know, had special furniture made that would be smaller. Beds\nthat would go up into the wall, you know, things like that, because they knew here it\nwould be a smaller place where we would be able to live.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: No, my father had a brother here, who had been here since 1926, I think, and\nthrough him we had the affidavits. And we had numbers to go to the consulate in\nStuttgart. And we did go there, you know, we had to have clearance as far as\nhealth was concerned and all that. So I remember going to Stuttgart where the \u2014\nwhere the American consulate was, and you know, being checked out and we \u2014\neverything was okay, and we had the visas. Before nine \u2014 before September \u201939.",
        "A: Well, yeah, I mean, that \u2014 that \u2014 then the whole thing got scrapped because we\ncouldn\u2019t leave, we a-are \u2014 we had already packed all our things, so we moved in\nwith my grandparents. And the \u2014 the correspondence that I found after \u2014 actually\nmy father\u2019s death many, many years later, was regarding \u2014 the Americans evidently\ngave us a hard time because there were four of us, and my father\u2019s brother here\nwasn\u2019t making enough money, although he worked for relatives here, and the \u2014 the\nones \u2014 was very reluctant to put his name down that he would support us in case he\ndi \u2014 we needed to. So, I think they finally persuaded him, si \u2014 but we never took a\npenny from him, but just to put his name on the \u2014 on \u2014 you know, this \u2014 America\nwas in a depression at that time, so my uncle had a hard time convincing them that\nMarch 2, 2010\neven if we came here, he \u2014 we would not be a burden to them. So, you know, that \u2014\nthat I remember. You know, tha-that correspondence I read mon \u2014 many years later.\nMy father didn\u2019t die until 1984. But I found all that in correspondence. And it was\neven discussion about sending me to Switzerland because my father had relatives\nthere, you know, so I found all that.",
        "A: Well, you know, I was \u2014 how old \u2014 was \u00b038, I was nine years old.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2014 it really sunk in. I just knew we couldn\u2019t go. In fact, I\nremember a couple times there was alarms if we were gonna get bombed, then we\nhad to go down to the cellar. But other than that, I don\u2019t have much memory of that.\nI know my family kept us busy doing arts and crafts at home. They always found\nthings for \u2014 for me and my sister to do, to keep us busy, I guess, you know.",
        "A: Well, we finally got left \u2014 in fact, it was my sister\u2019s birthday, February 18\",\n1940, we took a train to Munich and we stayed in a hotel I remember, and people\ncame to see my father, to give him messages to take us to people that lived in\nAmerica, asking them to help. I think that\u2019s what it was all about. And the next day\nMarch 2, 2010\nwe took a train over the Brenner Pass to Italy, to Genoa. And I remember I was\nvery nervous crossing the Brenner Pass, because you know, I did hear that they\nhad taken people off the trains if they found smuggling anything, you know. If they\nput thing \u2014 people used to hide things in the lining of their coats and all kinds of\nthings. So we were worried about that.",
        "A: No, we were not searched, but just the thought of 1t made me sick in my stomach\nafter we left. But we \u2014 we got through. My grandmother made sure we had nothing\ncontra, because she didn\u2019t want anything to happen to us.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we had to spend a few days there, and you know, we walked around\na little bit, we didn\u2019t have much money, I guess, I don\u2019t remember exactly. But, you\nknow, my parents \u2014 and the place we were staying was pretty bad. I mean, I know\nthat. And we finally boarded the pip \u2014 th-the \u2014 the ship and I have a picture of the\nship, you know, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was a terrible voyage for me, I got sick as a dog because of the weather. I\nmean, in \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Si\u2014 February \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, by way of the Mediterranean, and the cross from Gibraltar and over to\n\u2014 to the States and we landed in New York.",
        "A: If there was I didn\u2019t know, but I barely got out of bed. And my sister, she was\nfine, she went up to eat dinner, she did everything. She was fine, but I was a sick\none, yeah. The only thing I remember, when we got near New York, that my father\nactually carried me up to sh \u2014 see the Statue of Liberty. That \u2014 that I remember.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, really, I just remember that \u2014 that part of it, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, no, we \u2014 we actually did not stay in New York. We stayed a few days with\nfriends of ours as \u2014 from \u2014 from Regensburg, had come earlier, and my sister and I\nstayed with them, and my parents were invited to stay with some other relatives\nwho are already very well-to-do, had been here, I guess, for many, many years. And\nwe, immediately after that, took a train to Washington, because my uncle lived\nMarch 2, 2010\nhere in Washington, and the other relatives that \u2014 that they had, that had been here\nmany years always lived in Washington. So we came right to Washington, we\nnever stayed in New York.",
        "A: Well, you know, it was a little bit difficult. I had taken English lessons in\nGermany already, cause you know, my parents knew that was gonna happen. So I\nhad taken English lessons. We went to live with my uncle the first four months or\nso. I mean, he ha \u2014 he had bought a little house, 1t wasn\u2019t a very big house. It was in\na good neighborhood called Glover Park, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar, off\nWisconsin Avenue? And he had a wife and one son, and also my grandmother on \u2014\nfather\u2019s mother had come right after Kristallnacht, they brought her out \u2014 he\nbrought her over here. So they were for \u2014 four, and we were four, eight of us in that\nlittle house. We, my parents and my sister and I all slept down in the basement. It\nwas a built out basement, but we stayed \u2014 you know, we lived there. And we were\ntaken to the elementary school in the neighborhood, which \u2014 and they gave me\nsome tutoring in math, I was \u2014 think I was be \u2014I was like in the fifth grade then,\nbecause you know, I \u2014 I had a little \u2014 little \u2014 didn\u2019t have that much schooling over\nthere, so they gave me tutoring, and they were very nice to us. And then, I do\nMarch 2, 2010\nremember some kids calling us Nazis and stuff, you know, but you know, we had to\nlet go, what could we do, you know? We were here, we were safe, let\u2019s put it that\nway. And the summer, during the summer, through the Jewish Community Center,\nwe were sent to Camp Louise, I don\u2019t know if you \u2014 you may \u2014 so my sister and I\nboth were sent there for three weeks, which was really nice of them to do that, you\nknow, they did a lot, the Jewish community and also the Washington Hebrew\ncongregation, where we finally ended up, which was mostly juv \u2014 German Jews.\nTook us in, you know, so \u2014",
        "A: Well, let us go to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Sunday school, Sunday school. And they had a newcomers club too, at that\ntime that my parents, I think, you know, went to. So, yeah. An-And eventually we\nwere able to get an apartment \u2014 you want me to talk about it?",
        "A: I think that following September, my parents were able to afford a one bedroom\napartment for the four of us, you know. My father had gotten some work th-through\nsi \u2014 through the relatives that were mostly members of Washington Hebrew, and\nwere in better circumstances. Americ \u2014 they were already a hundred percent\nMarch 2, 2010\nAmericans. And his first job was selling [indecipherable] door to door \u2014 not door\nto door, by recommendation, a company called Real Silk. They sold socks, men\u2019s\nsocks and ties and I don\u2019t know what else, you know, and he was able to make\nmoney, little bit of money, you know, he wa \u2014 he was in \u2014 you know, so \u2014 and then\nGiant Food, Mr. Cohen was very good to the Jewish immigrants here, and gave\neverybody a job. So he worked for them on the weekends. They \u2014 they only had, I\nthink at that time, two stores in this area, but he went to work on the weekends, you\nknow, working there.",
        "A: I\u2014I really \u2014 I-I know \u2014 I mean, I really don\u2019t know too many, I-I know a couple\npeople that worked with him at that time, but I don\u2019t really remember how many,\nbut you know, he worked there, and then \u2014 so I \u2014 all I know is one time one of them\nsaid to him, if you crack a few eggs, he\u2019ll let you take them home for free. So, you\nknow, he was able to bring home some \u2014 some eggs for us to have, you know. And\nyou know, we managed. My sister and I went to school then. My mother also got a\njob working as a housekeeper for a family. You know, and then she eventually\nfound a job working for a family where she basically took care of the \u2014 the children\nMarch 2, 2010\nwhile the parents were working. So, you know, she \u2014 she had to work too, you\nknow, they both worked, and we were kind of left to our own. At home we were\nsupposed to clean the apartment and stuff, you know? And my sister was a rebel. So\n\u2014 but, you know, we managed it, but th \u2014 after that \u2014 and then what happened, my\ngrandparents, my mother\u2019s parents were still in Germany, and they had a lot of\ntrouble, they had to pay tax upon tax, and they had to repair the \u2014 the store front and\neverything, you know. They taxed them because they did have money. And they\nfinally got out in May of 1940, which was late. And they \u2014 they used to have these,\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the closed trains? They were trains that were\nclosed from Berlin to I think Lisbon, Portugal. Well, by the time they were ready\nto leave, there were no more closed trains, 1t had stopped already. And this is all\nsecondhand, because I heard the story through my aunt who stayed behind, you\nknow, who was married, my mother\u2019s sister was married to the Gentile. They went\n\u2014 they were in Munich, and they went to the airline and she gave them one ticket.\nAnd they just said no, we\u2019re not go \u2014 one \u2014 either we both go or we don\u2019t go. And\nso my aunt said, you gotta shmear them, you know, give them a little money under\nthe table. Maybe tomorrow you\u2019ll \u2014 so she did, next day she had two tickets. I\nmean, there \u2014 there were people that were not bad, they helped. And so they got on\nMarch 2, 2010\na plane and they were able to go to Lisbon, Portugal, and from there they took a\nship, one of those last few out of Lisbon to New York City.",
        "A: Yeah, well, they were supposed to stay in New York with my \u2014 with their son,\nwho had come earlier, and he was drafted by then. So they all came to Washington,\nin the one bedroom apartment, in May of 1940. And you know, we managed a hot\nsummer, no air conditioning. And I think in September finally, my family was able\nto get a two bedroom apartment. So my grandparents had a room, my sister and I\nhad a room and my parents were sleeping in the living room. That\u2019s how it was, you\nknow. But we were there from 1941 until 1948. And I went to high school there,\nyou know, out of that milieu, I mean, we managed.",
        "A: Well, there were relatives of my father\u2019s who had lived in Switzerland for many\nyears already, had come back long before. And through them we were able to\ncommunicate. I mean, like we sh \u2014 we would send a letter to Switzerland, and I\nguess there was \u2014 maybe send her a postcard saying, heard from, you know,\neverything is okay, and she would write a postcard back, without a return sender,\nMarch 2, 2010\nI\u2019m sure, just to say I\u2019m okay, or something. So that way, they knew that they were\nokay, you know. That\u2019s th \u2014 they were the intermediaries.",
        "A: Well, like I say, that \u2014 you know, I remember Pearl Harbor, that I remember,\nand you know, during the war, I mean, I don\u2019t think there was \u2014 we didn\u2019t know\nthat much. I mean, nobody really knew it, although I understand, there was corres \u2014\nthat people knew \u2014 well, my aunt in ger \u2014 who stayed behind in Germany told me\nafter the war that when the soldiers came back from the eastern front, the German\nsoldiers, they told her what was going on over there, they knew about it. But of\ncourse, they were afraid to talk, I guess, because they would have been shot too,\nyou know. But she knew what was going on.",
        "A: Well, probably a little bit later. Well, there were my cousins, my father\u2019s sister,\none sister, one sister got out with her husband. The other ones didn\u2019t. They stayed \u2014\nthey se \u2014 actually sent their children to England on the Kindertransport. And by\nthe time they wanted to leave, they just couldn\u2019t get out any more. And my aunt told\nme \u2014 this was after the war \u2014 that they came to say goodbye to her, and she knew\nMarch 2, 2010\nwhat was gonna happen. She knew about it. Course, she didn\u2019t tell them, you know,\nthey \u2014 in fact, my cousin who now lives here said to me, she also, through \u2014 they\nhad a very good housekeeper who helped them have \u2014 through, you know, you \u2014\nshe said, her mother went out and had warm clothes made, because she knew they\nwere going east. They were one of the last deported.",
        "A: Yeah, I ha \u2014I think it was Auschwitz, and actually, she just found out not long\nago that her mother was not gassed immediately. Her father was, and he was one of\nseven brothers, and I think five of them, they were gassed imme \u2014 they were older,\nthey were gassed immediately, but her mother was working, sewing or doing\nsomething, and she contracted typhoid fever, and then that\u2019s what did her in. So,\nyou know, but that was my father\u2019s second sister. The first one was able to get out\nand lived in New York City. So, you know. So they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re the only close\nrelatives that we really lost. And they were very Orthodox, you know, they were the\nkind that thought God will help, and you know. It was a big family. The name was\nEinstein, and they were from Augsburg. And they were a \u2014 cattle dealers and they\nwere well-to-do, I mean, they just di \u2014 n-never thought anything like this would\nhappen. By the time they really wanted to get out, they wanted to go to Rhodesia,\nand they wouldn\u2019t take children. So, you know, they just didn\u2019t believe it would\nMarch 2, 2010\never happen, because with their money, they were better off \u2014 well a \u2014 better off\nthan I think my family was. But they just didn\u2019t believe, you know, they were \u2014",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember that, when it was. I-I\u2019m not sure exactly\nhow long it was.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think there was too much talk about it. The one thing I should tell\nyou is my mother, unfortunately, when we finally \u2014 they got on their feet, they were\nable to buy a house in 1949, I guess. My mother had gotten sick, and she had\ncancer. So, I mean, that was a real problem, you know. My grandparents were still\nliving with us, her parents, and she passed away in 1950. I mean, I was able to\nfinish high school, but college, I had to pay my own way and I never finished\nbecause, you know, I had to help my father actually, after my mother passed away.\nSo that kind of put a dent in it. And the fact that they were fairly young, we spoke\nMarch 2, 2010\nmostly English in our house. And of course my grandparents weren\u2019t happy with\nwhat happened in Europe and everything, and my grandfather took it very hard\nwhen my mother passed away, so you know. And then I do remember after the war\nwas over that they sent packages over there for my aunt and her family every week.\nAnd they also had another \u2014 a group called self help, and they were mostly the\nGerman Jewish refugees here, that sent packages over to \u2014 to people. Food, you\nknow, to help whoever was left, or whoever survived. I do remember that. So, you\nknow, d-discussion, I really don\u2019t remember that much, that they ever talked about\nit too much. So, you know, luckily that they \u2014 my mother\u2019s sister survived. That\nwas a big thing already, you know. And actually, her brother who ended up in the\narmy, went to see her. I think that was \u2014 happened, you know, after liberation, and\ndid find that she was in \u2014 you know, they were okay, you know, that they survived,\nlet\u2019s put it that way. So, you know, so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, they remained in Germany. They did come over here. My grandparents\nwere able to celebrate their 50\" wedding anniv \u2014 well, she came over first, I think in\n\u2014 after my mother had passed away already, and then they came over for my\ngrandparents 50\" wedding anniversary. So that was, you know. But my aunt \u2014 and\nshe came back a few more times after her husband passed away, and told me that\nMarch 2, 2010\nafter everybody had left, she had never converted to Catholicism when she married\nhim, but she said, after everybody left, she felt like she needed to belong someplace.\nShe felt alone, you know, and \u2014 not that she was strong in Judaism, but she became\nCatholic.",
        "A: Yeah, she did, she did. She said even after \u2014 she had moved to Munich, and she\nhad an apartment there, and she said whenever she came over here to visit, she\nwould never say she\u2019s coming to see her family, cause she didn\u2019t want everybody \u2014\nanyone to know that she was Jewish originally, and said she was coming to see\nfriends. So she did have a certain amount of unease about letting people know that\nshe was Jewish. But we have kept in touch with the cousins. In fact, the children of\none of the cousins just came \u2014 was here visiting with me, and her husband. And you\nknow, my children have gone over and stayed with them. So we have a good rela \u2014\nI mean, they were never Nazi, none of them Nazis, you know. Of course, they were\nchildren too, but \u2014 and we \u2014 my husband and I had visited over there, you know, so\nwe have kept up the relationship, you know. So they know who we are, and we\nknow who they are, and then, you know, they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not strong Catholics\neither, you know. But yeah, we do have the relationship with them, yeah.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: No, I\u2014I think \u2014 no, you definitely \u2014 mother\u2019s mother, my grandmother, was\nvery \u2014 very active in the community, in our town, as \u2014 has rubbed double off on me,\nbecause I have gotten involved here in a lot of community things. I mean, I was\nvery active in BBG, and you know, president of my BBG group, and active in adult\nthings, you know. And I\u2019m active here in the Jewish residence, and now I\u2019m\npresident of a group of widows and widowers, which meets at the JCC, so I think it\nsomehow rubbed off on me to be active and give \u2014 give back.",
        "A: And also volunteer at the Holocaust Museum.",
        "A: Well, ?'m \u2014 Tm -\u2014I\u2019ma liberal, let\u2019s put it that way. You know, I\u2019m kind of hope\nthings, and always wish that things would get better here, an-and hope, you know.\nSo, you know, tell my children about \u2014 they know about my background, they\nknow, and you know, that it was hard, I \u2014 you know, I had to pull myself up by my\nbootstraps, and had to pay for everything myself, it wasn\u2019t given to me on a silver\nplatter, so \u2014 although, my parents did get some restitution eventually, but 1t wasn\u2019t\nMarch 2, 2010\nmuch, and you know, basically I had to fend for myself. And luckily, when I met\nmy husband \u2014 he was also from Germany, he was from Hamburg, but he had\nestablished himself over here by that \u2014 he came a little earlier, 1937, and had\nbecome a photographer and \u2014 and had opened a studio, and I felt 1t was my duty to\nhelp him, so I became like the manager of the place. So, you know, we both worked\nhard, and you know, we made a fairly good living, you know. And started all over.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
