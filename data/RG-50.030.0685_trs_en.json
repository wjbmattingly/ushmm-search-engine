And his\nfather was the village carpenter, and also he worked on \u2014 I remember he worked on\nthe organ of the church in Padagai, which is a kind of historic church because it\nwas one of the flashpoints of the 1905 revolt against the tsar, and has since then\nbecome a famous church in preserving liturgical items during the Soviet era. And\nI\u2019ve been there a couple of times, and this in fact is where my grandfather, his father\nis buried.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "Q: Was your dad also a carpenter?",

So his \u2014 his profession was teacher,\nalthough you know later he became more of an administrator and inspector of\nschools, and then he \u2014 he was official at \u2014 in the Ministry of Education for some\ntime. Now, my mother was also a teacher, in fact, she was born in Slovakia\n[indecipherable]. And she grew up there, but then went to Kaunas a-at the\nteacher\u2019s college and th \u2014 also university. We \u2014 we go to [indecipherable]. Also\nbecame a teacher and 1n fact that\u2019s how they met, they were teaching in the same\nplace in \u2014 in [indecipherable] in Lithuania, and that\u2019s when they got married.",

        "A: Oh yes, they \u2014 they were born \u2014 ma-ma \u2014 my mother was born in 1908, and my\nfather 1910.",

        "Q: Oh come now, oh come now.",
        "A: Not identical.",
        "Q: Tell me \u2014 tell me what your earliest memories are.",
        "A: Well, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s hard to talk about the earliest memories, because I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 there are memories which come and go. No really permanent memories, but\nin fact, I do remember things at \u2014 after the Soviet \u2014 during the Soviet occupation we\nwere in \u2014 in, the first Soviet occupation, we lived in Kaunas, and then we moved to\nVilnius, where my father worked at the Ministry of Education.",
        "Q: Under the Soviet occupation?\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: No, this was at \u2014 after the Germans moved in and we \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 became possible to\ngo to Vilnius after that, yeah. Before then 1t was Polish and you know \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to step back a little bit and get our \u2014 get some dates established.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: PI still go back to \u2014 I wanted to dwell a little bit on pre-war. So I understand\nthat it\u2019s hard to say, which was my first memory and which was my second. But as\na child, do you have any memories before any war, before any occupation? Just\nsomething personal from your home life, from school perhaps, or children or\nparents?",
        "A: Well, I do \u2014I have very few memories of Kaunas for instance. But do \u2014 during\nthe latter part of \u2014 of my parents\u2019 life i-in Kaunas, we lived in Panemun\u00e9, which is\nlike a suburb of Kaunas. And I remember that, we lived in a\u2014 rented a\u2014a-\u2014a\nhouse there, and there was \u2014 I remember there was a little park there with newly\nplanted conifer trees. And there was a statue of \u2014 was an [indecipherable]. And I\nremember that \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that the trees were about the same size as the height of\nthe statue. And of course, when I came back there 40 or 50 years later, the trees\nwere as high as the sky and the statue was about this tall \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: \u2014so that\u2019s one thing I remember. Another thing is, when I got my\n[indecipherable] exercised a little bit when I threw a rock at the bus that carried my\nfather back from work or \u2014 Kaunas.",
        "Q: Did you get in trouble?",
        "A: Yeah, he saw it, and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: When you were \u2014 when you and your sister were born, did your mother then stay\nhome and take care of you, or did she continue work as a teacher?",
        "A: Well, she did work as a teacher at the time when I remember. I mean, I don\u2019t\nthink I remember anything before I was about five years old, or so.",
        "Q: Do you remember the Soviets coming into Lithuania in 1940? Do you have any\nmemories of that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t recall seeing them come into Lithuania, but they were there,\nyou know, and I \u2014I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t recall seeing them actually, you know, any\nsoldiers or officials or any \u2014 cause we lived in the suburbs there then. I don\u2019t recall\never being in Kaunas itself, you know. Yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s move then to Vilnius. You say your father moved to Vilnius at what point?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s hard for me to say because I \u2014 I\u2019m not quite sure.",
        "Q: Okay.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: But I know that it was slightly before the outbreak of the war, and \u2014 and you\nknow \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and \u2014 and the German occupation.",
        "Q: Oh, it was before then. It was before then.",
        "A: Because one thing \u2014 yeah, one \u2014 one thing I do remember is the German army\nparading down Gediminas Prospect in Vilnius, we were there already.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I also remember, now that you\u2019ve jogged my memory, that I went to pre-\nschool or school, first grade in Vilnius, and we had to draw red stars and \u2014 and you\nknow, Stalin\u2019s picture and things like that. So that obviously was during the\nRussian occupation, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So we were there already during that \u2014 the Russian occupation.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you remember where you lived in Vilnius, what it looked like?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014 I\u2014Ido, because, course we lived there until 1944.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And it was in Tilto Gatv\u00e9 number 12, which is, know, a block or so, couple of\nblocks from the Cathedral Square, the center.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "Q: It\u2019s the center of the city.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And what kind of a place was that? Was it an apartment, was it a house?",
        "A: It was an apartment, and it was one of those things typical of Vilnius. This was\nnot in the old town, it was in the \u2014 what\u2019s called the new town, which is probably\n200 years old anyway. And it has a courtyard, and it looked like an apartment\nbuilding from the outside, and you walk in through a little gate, and there\u2019s a\ncourtyard. And so, our apartment, we walked through the courtyard, up some stairs,\nand \u2014 but our windows were out to the street.",
        "Q: Ah, to Gediminas or to Tilto Street?",
        "A: Tilto Street, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, so that\u2019s a small street.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it had a lot of great little houses, most of which are gone now, but they were\nstill there when we were there.",
        "Q: You \u2014 you say that you remember seeing the German soldiers marching into\nVilnius, right?\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think it was marching, I guess there were just \u2014 there was a parade,\nI guess, aft-after they do \u2014 marched in. But I don\u2019t remember them marching in. I\ndo remember when the war began, I was walking down Tilto Gatv\u00e9, and coming\nhome from somewhere with my mother, and we heard like a muffled explosion\nsomewhere. And I guess that was a German bomb being dropped somewhere. But\nthere weren\u2019t too many of them, they didn\u2019t, you know, mash up the city too well.\nBut then the Polish woman, remember running by yelling, paniczka(ph),\npaniczka(ph), wojna, which, you know \u2014",
        "Q: And what does that mean?",
        "A: That means, paniczka(ph) means like lady, lady, it-it\u2019s war, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so that \u2014 that\u2019s what it sounded, but I don\u2019t remember \u2014 there were no acts\nof war in the city itself. The Germans just, you know, moved in and that the extent\nof it.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of how the atmosphere in your home changed? Did\nyour parents look nervous, did they seem \u2014",
        "A: Well, I mean, everybody was nervous throughout this whole period. And I do\nremember that there was a lot of social activity, that they would go together, you\nknow, and have parties, and you know, talk and why my \u2014 my father never used to\nFebruary 18, 2013\nsmoke, well then he started smoking with his friends, because they were \u2014 they\nwere always nervous and not certain of what \u2014 what was going to happen.",
        "Q: And his job in Vilnius had been \u2014 can you tell us a little bit about that?",
        "A: Well, he was \u2014 like I said that \u2014 at \u2014 at \u2014 at first he was ins-inspector of schools,\nwhere he would go inspect and file reports on various schools that he was \u2014\nsomebody who I guess oversaw the hiring and promotion of teachers. And then at a\nva \u2014 at the la \u2014 last position he had, he was a director or deputy director for special\nand vocational education.",
        "Q: I guess the reason why I come back to this is that during the first Soviet\noccupation, teachers were particularly targeted for deportation by the Soviets.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And so I\u2019m surprised that they weren\u2019t on this \u2014 that they weren\u2019t targeted 1n this\nway, that he continued having some sort of job in the educational sphere.",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 and in fact, he \u2014 he took advantage of \u2014 of, I guess the Soviet\noccupation to move into Vilnius because before that it was Polish, and there was no\nsuch possibility. But I guess a lot of opportunities for people to work in Vilnius\nbecame available just before or during the Soviet occupa \u2014 first Soviet occupation.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Yeah.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "Q: Well, I realize that the period of time that we\u2019re talking about with you, really\nwill start from 1941 til 1944. And at that time you were between six and 10 years\nold?",
        "A: Right, right. Well, nine to \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. Nine, 10 years old. So how \u2014 do you remember ho-how life changed? I\nmean, you saw \u2014 you had an image of \u2014 of German soldiers marching in a parade in\ntown, you have an image and a memory of a Polish lady ran \u2014 running and \u2014 and\nsaying \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, the war is \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 the war is here. What were some of the other images, some of the other\nfragments of memories that you have from the very first days?",
        "A: Well, the first \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say because na \u2014 we lived in this little street, away\nfrom \u2014 only about a block away from a main street.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But as far as a \u2014 a four or five year old, six year old child is concerned, it might\nbe la\u2014 two miles away, because you\u2019d never get out there anyway. So, I didn\u2019t see\nvery much of \u2014 I do remember, before the Germans came of \u2014 I was walking again\nwith the \u2014 well, we \u2014 either my mother or my ma \u2014 her mother, my grandmother\nwould take me for walks, you know, in Vilnius, and before the Russians left, I saw\nFebruary 18, 2013\nsome \u2014 right around Cathedral Square, there \u2014 there \u2014 there were a few trucks\npassed with \u2014 loaded with people and with Russian soldiers with bayonets standing\nin the corners of the truck. And I later found out those were the people who were\nbeing deported to Siberia, being taken to the railway station.",
        "Q: Did you ever walk \u2014 remember walking around in the real old town, which\nwould have been the Jewish quarter of Vilnius?",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we do that all the time. My grandmother would take me to the old\nchurches, she was a devout Catholic and she would go \u2014 I remember there was \u2014 I\nthink it was the Dominican church, there was a stairway that the supplicants walked\nup underneath.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they had little relics of saints\u2019 blood or something like that and that they\nkissed it and so on. And I remembered that \u2014 her doing that, and in fact I \u2014 I was\nable to see that at one of our visits, you know, I-lately, about, you know, five, six\nyears ago. They\u2019re rebuilding the whole thing and I actually got to see the same\nstaircase, only now it looked a lot smaller than it did before.",
        "Q: Did you notice \u2014 I mean, since many of the churches were interspersed with\nwhere the synagogue was, where the narrow streets in the old town were, where\nthere were Jewish peddlers in places. Did you notice these things? Did you notice\nFebruary 18, 2013\nany part of the Jewish life that was going around? You were a child, of course, but\nwas that something that \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2014I don\u2019t specifically recall, you know, seeing the \u2014 the \u2014 the Jewish life or\nthe peddlers or the \u2014 the stores. I\u2014 I\u2014I guess we didn\u2019t go into that section very\nmuch. We went, I guess, near the Cathedral Square and the wa \u2014 or the Saint\nAnne\u2019s church and the Dominican church was in these areas.",
        "Q: Did you know of anything, even at that young age, that there are people who are\nJews? Did your parents talk about anything like that at home? Do you remember?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t recall we were specifically talking about that, until later, when the\nHolocaust started and I remember once my father saying to the Germans, we\u2019re\noffering, you know, for those who collaborate, you know, with them, offering the\nchance to be the first ones into the apartments of the Jews that they \u2014 that they\ndeport to the ghetto.",
        "Q: So he mentioned that at home, huh?",
        "A: Yes, and apparently some people were taking it, you know, cause otherwise they\nwouldn\u2019t be talking about that. But my father was as \u2014 as poor as a church mouse,\nbut he never do \u2014 did anything like that.",
        "Q: What a \u2014 did you ever see any Jews when you were a child in Vilnius?\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: I must have, but I\u2014 I just don\u2019t have a recollection of wha \u2014 of what they looked\nlike, except for one incident which does stick in my mind.",
        "Q: Tell us about that incident.",
        "A: Yeah. And this was something that has really etched in my memory, because I\ndo \u2014 I don\u2019t remember very much from that time period, but this one of our walks in\nthe city. And I guess we were walking somewhere.",
        "Q: Who were you with?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Who were you with?",
        "A: With my mother.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And whether I\u2019m \u2014 and we were walking down some streets in the old town, and\nat this time I guess the Jewish people were still not locked up in the ghetto, but they\nhad to wear a yellow Star of David on \u2014 on their clothing. And at that \u2014 by this time\nthey could not \u2014 they were not allowed by the Germans to walk on the sidewalks,\nthey had to walk in the street. And we were walking along and I saw this German\nsoldier run up to this elderly lady with a gi \u2014 with a yellow star on her clothing, and\nstrike her with the \u2014 with his rifle butt. And it turns out like wi \u2014 he was doing it\nbecause she was walking on the sidewalk. And I remember very clearly I\u2014I-\u2014I-\nFebruary 18, 2013\nit\u2019s not something that you see all the time, and my mother getting very upset. She\nstarted to yell at that soldier, you know, how can you be doing this to an old lady,\nand crying. And so that\u2019s something that I \u2014 a-an act, or a\u2014 a\u2014a real act of violence\nagainst a Jewish person, and by \u2014 apparently it was some kind of a guard that\nwalking around the streets, taking care of, insuring that nobody was walking on the\nsidewalk when they\u2019re not supposed to, you know?",
        "Q: Did he turn on your mother, did he pay attention to your mother?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did he do?",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I just stay with her, I asked here what\u2019s going on, and this \u2014 she said\nthat these people are like beasts, you know, the \u2014 who would be doing that, you\nknow, to defenseless old people?",
        "Q: But did the guard hear your mother and then turn his attention to her?",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t, he just said something in German, probably something that\u2019s like\nstay out of it or something, but I didn\u2019t understand it, you know. But he didn\u2019t do\nanything to my mother.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Did you walk on afterwards?",
        "A: Yes.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "Q: Yes. And did your \u2014 did any explanation or further conversation about this\nhappen at home?",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I-\u2014I suppose there was, but I don\u2019t recall, you know, what happened at\nhome. The \u2014 my mother probably told my father what was going on and they talked\nabout it, but I don\u2019t have that \u2014 that recollection.",
        "Q: Yeah. What \u2014 did your neighborhood change after the German occupation on\nTilto Street?",
        "A: Well, we don\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 our neighborhood, you know, the people who lived\nin that \u2014 in the apartments facing that courtyard probably were the same people.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. The only thing that I learned later, th \u2014 much later, while my mother was\nstill alive here in the United States, is that the building in the middle of the\ncourtyard \u2014 it was a couple of \u2014 series of small buildings within the courtyard,\nwhich were quite old and I think they\u2019re designated as historical monuments now.\nAnyway, she told me that during the Holocaust, during the shooting of Jews in\nPaneriai, those houses were used to \u2014 to store \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 I guess to \u2014 to house some\nof the shooters. And \u2014 and she said that you know, every morning they would take\nthem out there you know, with trucks. And then in the \u2014 in the evening they would\n\u2014 they would bring them back, and they all would, you know, stumble and fall out\nFebruary 18, 2013\nof the truck completely drunk, with bottles of vodka 1n their \u2014 1n their hands, and\napparently that \u2014",
        "Q: And the neighbors \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s who they were, they \u2014 they \u2014 apparently th-these were people\nthat, I think they were called the \u2014 the Ypatingas Burys, a special, you know, troop\nwho did the shooting.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And where they got was people, and they were all young hooligans, hoods \u2014",
        "Q: Were they German?",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they were Polish and Lithuanian and they were local \u2014 they were\nlocal people from Vilnius who obviously were doing it to be able to get their hands\non all the vodka that they want. And they would start drinking in the morning and \u2014\nand \u2014 and not \u2014 and not finish until they were passed out at night, I\u2019m guess that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s how they did it, you know.",
        "Q: Did your mother \u2014 did you have conversations \u2014 now this takes place in the\nUnited States when you\u2019re already older and so on. Did you have more extensive\nconversations with her about these things, about these topics?",
        "A: Well she \u2014 she didn\u2019t like to talk about that very much, but of course she was\nvery much aware of what was going on there and \u2014 but I don\u2019t know if she really\nFebruary 18, 2013\nknew exactly what was going on there because this was not something like a public\nrecord, but of course everybody knew what was happening to the Jews of Vilnius.",
        "Q: But I mean later, after the war, when you said that when you were in the United\nStates, she mentions this \u2014 this incident, that these are the soldiers and they were in\nthe courtyard, and so on. At that time, was there more conversation? You were\nalready in the west, you were already \u2014 you know, it was safe and \u2014 and so on. Was\nthere more conversation about such things?",
        "A: Well she \u2014 she was always very \u2014 a humane person. And it\u2019s obvious that it was\ndifficult for her to talk about something as \u2014 as hag \u2014 ghastly as that, you know,\nwhere \u2014 where you know, mass killing was \u2014 was carried out. And she \u2014 she was, of\ncourse were very condemning of the \u2014 of the g-guys who were \u2014 the drunks who\nwere shooting there, you know. But other than that, oh there was \u2014 a-and \u2014 course\nth-the \u2014 the whole drift was that we don\u2019t have anything to do with them, these are\njust extremely, you know, bad people, they were the \u2014 should stay away from them,\nyou know.",
        "Q: As the war progresses, you get older, you know \u2014",
        "A: Uh-huh",
        "Q: \u2014 you \u2014 your grow \u2014 and so by 1944 you are how old?",
        "A: \u201944, I was nine years old.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This was in December \u2014 in December we \u2014 we left Vilnius and then Lithuania\nin December of \u201944, when the front was advancing toward Vilnius.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What were the rest of the war years like? Was there any other\ninteraction with Germans that you remember? Did you ever pass the ghetto by whe\n\u2014 after it was established?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that. We might have, but I don\u2019t think anybody wanted to go\nnear the ghetto because it was full of German guards, and things were closed off\nwith gates, and people just didn\u2019t want to get in \u2014 near that whole thing. I do\nremember that I think it must have been about 1943 or so, when the Germans, I\nguess in response to the failure of the Lithuanian \u2014 Lithuanians to establish a\u2014a SS\nregiment or something like that, began sending, you know, selected people to the\nconcentration camps. People who had nationalistic, you know, inclinations and\nthings like that. And a number of people from the ministry where my father worked\nwere shipped off to Stutthof, and you know, some of them died there. And so I\nremember that for \u2014 for weeks, my father and \u2014 and his other colleagues, you know,\nswitched locations where they slept every night, so that they could not be easily\nfound if \u2014 if \u2014 cause usually when they come to arrest you they come \u2014 they don\u2019t\ngo to your place of work, they \u2014 they come to \u2014 when you\u2019re sleeping in your \u2014 in\nFebruary 18, 2013\nyour apartment or your house, whatever. So they \u2014 they were \u2014 well, you know,\nscared of getting shipped off to Stutthof and so they \u2014 they did this. And so that\nwas, I think it was in this se-several, in the last months of \u2014 of the German\noccupation with. Cause this was going on already and they were trying to avoid\nthat.",
        "Q: Are there \u2014 are there any other memories, fragments of memories from that time,\nabout the war, about the occupation, about perhaps conversations that were had\nabout these things, that \u2014 that you can recall, when you were still in Vilnius?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think that our parents, and of course nobody else talked to children\nabout what they knew what was \u2014 that was going on. Now of course, they all knew\nwhat was going on, but they were not sharing this with us. Of course, I think that\nmy mother was always, you know, aghast that this was going on, you know. And\nmy father, you know, our \u2014 this was a time when there were epidemics now going\nthrough. There was a typh \u2014 typhus epidemic which my sister and I spent a few\nweeks, you know, trying to \u2014 to get to \u2014 Deet. And I remember that, you know,\nbefore \u2014 before the, I guess ghetto, and \u2014 and the destruction of the Jews, our family\ndoctors were Jewish. Dr. Gehrler(ph) and doctor \u2014 I du \u2014 don\u2019t remember the\nname. And I think that \u2014 and then toward the end, I guess, they weren\u2019t \u2014 they\nweren\u2019t there any more, so that was, you know.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "Q: Did you have any memories of who th \u2014 of these individuals? Do you remember\nth \u2014 how they looked?",
        "A: I faintly remember how Dr. Gehrler(ph) looked, because he would come and\ntake care of us. But I don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t know anything else about him or what happened\nto him. He obviously wound up at some \u2014 in Paneriai or whatever concentration\ncamp, you know.",
        "Q: Oh. When did your own interest 1n \u2014 in these events that people were so silent\nabout, when did it start to appear?",
        "A: It was, I think, always there, because I knew, of course by reading the inter \u2014 the\nna \u2014 the international press and \u2014 and some books about the Holocaust, and \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the destruction of the Jewish population of eastern Europe. And of\ncourse you would \u2014 could not see very much of this, or any of this in the Lithuanian\npress here in the United States, because that was like a taboo topic, you know.",
        "Q: Why? Why do you think it was?",
        "A: Well, I think many reasons. I think one reason was that the Lithuanians who\ncontrolled the press were themselves ashamed of what was going on. They did not\nwant to mention it or to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to even, you know, mention it in the \u2014 in their\npapers. Maybe it would go away, you know, that kind of thing. Now of course,\nthere were some who were openly anti-Semitic, who said that this was all, you\nFebruary 18, 2013\nknow, some nonsense that the Jews are \u2014 are spreading, you know. But that \u2014 that, I\nthink, was the minority, most of them just didn\u2019t want to, you know, hear about it.",
        "Q: But why would they have a feeling of shame?",
        "A: Because they knew that there was some \u2014 obviously they knew that there was\nsome involvement by \u2014 by Lithuanian people, not just the Germans.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because when you look at \u2014 at \u2014 I-I started researching this thing on my own a\nlong time ago. As soon as I got my degree and started working and se \u2014 then started\nreading books. And when the computers came out, I w \u2014 I went to the web pages of\nthe various organizations that deal with the history of the Holocaust, and you know,\nfind out what was going on. And after \u2014 and \u2014 Lithuania became independent again\nin \u201991, there was \u2014 there were publications by the \u2014 the history, a kind of, I guess\nhistory department or history institute, of various maps have to do with the history\nof Lithuania. And one of them was a map of where the executions of Jews took\nplace in 1941. And I was amazed to see that the whole map of Lithuania was\ncovered with these places, which also mentioned a number that were executed in\neach place.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "Q: It\u2019s a small country.",
        "A: Yes. And so it dawned on me then that this not something that could have been\ndone by, you know, couple of hundred of Germans. I mean, they had to \u2014 somebody\nhad to round up the Jews in each one of these localities, drive them \u2014 march them to\nthe graveside, and then whoever shot them, shot them, but the \u2014 the shooters\nthemselves did not do this, obviously.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So that suggested to me that were a lot more people from the police forces of\nthat \u2014 of the provincial police forces, who were involved. And obviously this is the\ncase, an-and I\u2019ve been trying to find out who they were. And in fact, I\u2019m reading a\nbook now by \u2014 just came out recently, I forgot the name, where a woman PhD,\nSutton, I think was it \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Sutton, yeah. And when she shows a picture of the SS officers with the police\nchiefs of the Lithuanian provinces sitting, a nice picture. And of course I\u2014 I \u2014I\u20141t\ndoesn\u2019t take much \u2014 I don\u2019t have to be Einstein to figure out what they were talking\nabout there, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah. Why is this important to you?\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Because I am Lithuanian, I was born in Lithuania. What happened in Lithuania\nis important to me. And I want to know the truth. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s kind of\nhard to take to \u2014 to talk about the people who \u2014 who are, you know, accomplices in\nsomething of this sort. But if that happened, I want to know about it. I want to know\nwho these people were. Where th \u2014 where the \u2014 are th-they now. Most of them are\ndead, but, you know.",
        "Q: Do you think that that curiosity, that need to know \u2014 it\u2019s more than curiosity, do\nyou think that\u2019s shared by many people in the Lithuanian community, whether it\u2019s\nhere in the United States, or there?",
        "A: Not too many. I think a lot of them take the attitude that oh, this happened, you\nknow, 60 years ago, forget about it, you know, it\u2019s gone, let\u2019s just go on with life.\nThey don\u2019t care what happened.",
        "Q: Would you \u2014 why sh \u2014 do you \u2014 I mean, this is a leading question, but, why\nshould they care?",
        "A: Well, any human being should be concerned about a \u2014 a \u2014 some \u2014 something that\nhappened in which millions of innocent people were killed. And so I don\u2019t think\nanybody can just shake their head and \u2014 and forget about it. Unfortunately, th-things\nlike that haven\u2019t stopped happening since then, your \u2014 you look at Srebrenica, and\nlook at Rwanda and places like that. I mean, genocide, that goes on even now. And\nFebruary 18, 2013\nI think people have to be aware of this an-and try to stop it, be at \u2014 learn from\nmistakes that were made, or \u2014 or they weren\u2019t mistakes, it\u2019s just a misplacement of\n\u2014 of priorities \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 where the National Socialist Order simplistic solutions to \u2014 to complicated\nproblems. Okay, you don\u2019t like the Jews, the Jews you think are doing something\nagainst your, you know, countrymen. So, of course, you kill them all, that\u2019s the best\nway to get to redress the problem. And this is exactly what they were doing in\nBosnia and \u2014 and in Rwanda and places like that, and that should be something that\npeople would no longer think about.",

        "A: Well, I do \u2014I have very few memories of Kaunas for instance. But do \u2014 during\nthe latter part of \u2014 of my parents\u2019 life i-in Kaunas, we lived in Panemun\u00e9, which is\nlike a suburb of Kaunas. And I remember that, we lived in a\u2014 rented a\u2014a-\u2014a\nhouse there, and there was \u2014 I remember there was a little park there with newly\nplanted conifer trees. And there was a statue of \u2014 was an [indecipherable]. And I\nremember that \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that the trees were about the same size as the height of\nthe statue. And of course, when I came back there 40 or 50 years later, the trees\nwere as high as the sky and the statue was about this tall \u2014\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: \u2014so that\u2019s one thing I remember. Another thing is, when I got my\n[indecipherable] exercised a little bit when I threw a rock at the bus that carried my\nfather back from work or \u2014 Kaunas.",
        "A: Yeah, he saw it, and [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, she did work as a teacher at the time when I remember. I mean, I don\u2019t\nthink I remember anything before I was about five years old, or so.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t recall seeing them come into Lithuania, but they were there,\nyou know, and I \u2014I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t recall seeing them actually, you know, any\nsoldiers or officials or any \u2014 cause we lived in the suburbs there then. I don\u2019t recall\never being in Kaunas itself, you know. Yeah.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s hard for me to say because I \u2014 I\u2019m not quite sure.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: But I know that it was slightly before the outbreak of the war, and \u2014 and you\nknow \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and \u2014 and the German occupation.",
        "A: Because one thing \u2014 yeah, one \u2014 one thing I do remember is the German army\nparading down Gediminas Prospect in Vilnius, we were there already.",
        "A: But I also remember, now that you\u2019ve jogged my memory, that I went to pre-\nschool or school, first grade in Vilnius, and we had to draw red stars and \u2014 and you\nknow, Stalin\u2019s picture and things like that. So that obviously was during the\nRussian occupation, yeah.",
        "A: So we were there already during that \u2014 the Russian occupation.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014 I\u2014Ido, because, course we lived there until 1944.",
        "A: And it was in Tilto Gatv\u00e9 number 12, which is, know, a block or so, couple of\nblocks from the Cathedral Square, the center.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: It was an apartment, and it was one of those things typical of Vilnius. This was\nnot in the old town, it was in the \u2014 what\u2019s called the new town, which is probably\n200 years old anyway. And it has a courtyard, and it looked like an apartment\nbuilding from the outside, and you walk in through a little gate, and there\u2019s a\ncourtyard. And so, our apartment, we walked through the courtyard, up some stairs,\nand \u2014 but our windows were out to the street.",
        "A: Tilto Street, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: And it had a lot of great little houses, most of which are gone now, but they were\nstill there when we were there.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think it was marching, I guess there were just \u2014 there was a parade,\nI guess, aft-after they do \u2014 marched in. But I don\u2019t remember them marching in. I\ndo remember when the war began, I was walking down Tilto Gatv\u00e9, and coming\nhome from somewhere with my mother, and we heard like a muffled explosion\nsomewhere. And I guess that was a German bomb being dropped somewhere. But\nthere weren\u2019t too many of them, they didn\u2019t, you know, mash up the city too well.\nBut then the Polish woman, remember running by yelling, paniczka(ph),\npaniczka(ph), wojna, which, you know \u2014",
        "A: That means, paniczka(ph) means like lady, lady, it-it\u2019s war, you know.",
        "A: And so that \u2014 that\u2019s what it sounded, but I don\u2019t remember \u2014 there were no acts\nof war in the city itself. The Germans just, you know, moved in and that the extent\nof it.",
        "A: Well, I mean, everybody was nervous throughout this whole period. And I do\nremember that there was a lot of social activity, that they would go together, you\nknow, and have parties, and you know, talk and why my \u2014 my father never used to\nFebruary 18, 2013\nsmoke, well then he started smoking with his friends, because they were \u2014 they\nwere always nervous and not certain of what \u2014 what was going to happen.",
        "A: Well, he was \u2014 like I said that \u2014 at \u2014 at \u2014 at first he was ins-inspector of schools,\nwhere he would go inspect and file reports on various schools that he was \u2014\nsomebody who I guess oversaw the hiring and promotion of teachers. And then at a\nva \u2014 at the la \u2014 last position he had, he was a director or deputy director for special\nand vocational education.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 and in fact, he \u2014 he took advantage of \u2014 of, I guess the Soviet\noccupation to move into Vilnius because before that it was Polish, and there was no\nsuch possibility. But I guess a lot of opportunities for people to work in Vilnius\nbecame available just before or during the Soviet occupa \u2014 first Soviet occupation.",
        "A: Yeah.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Right, right. Well, nine to \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, the war is \u2014",
        "A: Well, the first \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say because na \u2014 we lived in this little street, away\nfrom \u2014 only about a block away from a main street.",
        "A: But as far as a \u2014 a four or five year old, six year old child is concerned, it might\nbe la\u2014 two miles away, because you\u2019d never get out there anyway. So, I didn\u2019t see\nvery much of \u2014 I do remember, before the Germans came of \u2014 I was walking again\nwith the \u2014 well, we \u2014 either my mother or my ma \u2014 her mother, my grandmother\nwould take me for walks, you know, in Vilnius, and before the Russians left, I saw\nFebruary 18, 2013\nsome \u2014 right around Cathedral Square, there \u2014 there \u2014 there were a few trucks\npassed with \u2014 loaded with people and with Russian soldiers with bayonets standing\nin the corners of the truck. And I later found out those were the people who were\nbeing deported to Siberia, being taken to the railway station.",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we do that all the time. My grandmother would take me to the old\nchurches, she was a devout Catholic and she would go \u2014 I remember there was \u2014 I\nthink it was the Dominican church, there was a stairway that the supplicants walked\nup underneath.",
        "A: And they had little relics of saints\u2019 blood or something like that and that they\nkissed it and so on. And I remembered that \u2014 her doing that, and in fact I \u2014 I was\nable to see that at one of our visits, you know, I-lately, about, you know, five, six\nyears ago. They\u2019re rebuilding the whole thing and I actually got to see the same\nstaircase, only now it looked a lot smaller than it did before.\nFebruary 18, 2013\nany part of the Jewish life that was going around? You were a child, of course, but\nwas that something that \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2014I don\u2019t specifically recall, you know, seeing the \u2014 the \u2014 the Jewish life or\nthe peddlers or the \u2014 the stores. I\u2014 I\u2014I guess we didn\u2019t go into that section very\nmuch. We went, I guess, near the Cathedral Square and the wa \u2014 or the Saint\nAnne\u2019s church and the Dominican church was in these areas.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t recall we were specifically talking about that, until later, when the\nHolocaust started and I remember once my father saying to the Germans, we\u2019re\noffering, you know, for those who collaborate, you know, with them, offering the\nchance to be the first ones into the apartments of the Jews that they \u2014 that they\ndeport to the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, and apparently some people were taking it, you know, cause otherwise they\nwouldn\u2019t be talking about that. But my father was as \u2014 as poor as a church mouse,\nbut he never do \u2014 did anything like that.",
        "A: I must have, but I\u2014 I just don\u2019t have a recollection of wha \u2014 of what they looked\nlike, except for one incident which does stick in my mind.",
        "A: Yeah. And this was something that has really etched in my memory, because I\ndo \u2014 I don\u2019t remember very much from that time period, but this one of our walks in\nthe city. And I guess we were walking somewhere.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: With my mother.",
        "A: And whether I\u2019m \u2014 and we were walking down some streets in the old town, and\nat this time I guess the Jewish people were still not locked up in the ghetto, but they\nhad to wear a yellow Star of David on \u2014 on their clothing. And at that \u2014 by this time\nthey could not \u2014 they were not allowed by the Germans to walk on the sidewalks,\nthey had to walk in the street. And we were walking along and I saw this German\nsoldier run up to this elderly lady with a gi \u2014 with a yellow star on her clothing, and\nstrike her with the \u2014 with his rifle butt. And it turns out like wi \u2014 he was doing it\nbecause she was walking on the sidewalk. And I remember very clearly I\u2014I-\u2014I-\nFebruary 18, 2013\nit\u2019s not something that you see all the time, and my mother getting very upset. She\nstarted to yell at that soldier, you know, how can you be doing this to an old lady,\nand crying. And so that\u2019s something that I \u2014 a-an act, or a\u2014 a\u2014a real act of violence\nagainst a Jewish person, and by \u2014 apparently it was some kind of a guard that\nwalking around the streets, taking care of, insuring that nobody was walking on the\nsidewalk when they\u2019re not supposed to, you know?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I just stay with her, I asked here what\u2019s going on, and this \u2014 she said\nthat these people are like beasts, you know, the \u2014 who would be doing that, you\nknow, to defenseless old people?",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t, he just said something in German, probably something that\u2019s like\nstay out of it or something, but I didn\u2019t understand it, you know. But he didn\u2019t do\nanything to my mother.",
        "A: Yes.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I-\u2014I suppose there was, but I don\u2019t recall, you know, what happened at\nhome. The \u2014 my mother probably told my father what was going on and they talked\nabout it, but I don\u2019t have that \u2014 that recollection.",
        "A: Well, we don\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 our neighborhood, you know, the people who lived\nin that \u2014 in the apartments facing that courtyard probably were the same people.",
        "A: Yeah. The only thing that I learned later, th \u2014 much later, while my mother was\nstill alive here in the United States, is that the building in the middle of the\ncourtyard \u2014 it was a couple of \u2014 series of small buildings within the courtyard,\nwhich were quite old and I think they\u2019re designated as historical monuments now.\nAnyway, she told me that during the Holocaust, during the shooting of Jews in\nPaneriai, those houses were used to \u2014 to store \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 I guess to \u2014 to house some\nof the shooters. And \u2014 and she said that you know, every morning they would take\nthem out there you know, with trucks. And then in the \u2014 in the evening they would\n\u2014 they would bring them back, and they all would, you know, stumble and fall out\nFebruary 18, 2013\nof the truck completely drunk, with bottles of vodka 1n their \u2014 1n their hands, and\napparently that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s who they were, they \u2014 they \u2014 apparently th-these were people\nthat, I think they were called the \u2014 the Ypatingas Burys, a special, you know, troop\nwho did the shooting.",
        "A: And where they got was people, and they were all young hooligans, hoods \u2014",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they were Polish and Lithuanian and they were local \u2014 they were\nlocal people from Vilnius who obviously were doing it to be able to get their hands\non all the vodka that they want. And they would start drinking in the morning and \u2014\nand \u2014 and not \u2014 and not finish until they were passed out at night, I\u2019m guess that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s how they did it, you know.",
        "A: Well she \u2014 she didn\u2019t like to talk about that very much, but of course she was\nvery much aware of what was going on there and \u2014 but I don\u2019t know if she really\nFebruary 18, 2013\nknew exactly what was going on there because this was not something like a public\nrecord, but of course everybody knew what was happening to the Jews of Vilnius.",
        "A: Well she \u2014 she was always very \u2014 a humane person. And it\u2019s obvious that it was\ndifficult for her to talk about something as \u2014 as hag \u2014 ghastly as that, you know,\nwhere \u2014 where you know, mass killing was \u2014 was carried out. And she \u2014 she was, of\ncourse were very condemning of the \u2014 of the g-guys who were \u2014 the drunks who\nwere shooting there, you know. But other than that, oh there was \u2014 a-and \u2014 course\nth-the \u2014 the whole drift was that we don\u2019t have anything to do with them, these are\njust extremely, you know, bad people, they were the \u2014 should stay away from them,\nyou know.",
        "A: Uh-huh",
        "A: \u201944, I was nine years old.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: This was in December \u2014 in December we \u2014 we left Vilnius and then Lithuania\nin December of \u201944, when the front was advancing toward Vilnius.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that. We might have, but I don\u2019t think anybody wanted to go\nnear the ghetto because it was full of German guards, and things were closed off\nwith gates, and people just didn\u2019t want to get in \u2014 near that whole thing. I do\nremember that I think it must have been about 1943 or so, when the Germans, I\nguess in response to the failure of the Lithuanian \u2014 Lithuanians to establish a\u2014a SS\nregiment or something like that, began sending, you know, selected people to the\nconcentration camps. People who had nationalistic, you know, inclinations and\nthings like that. And a number of people from the ministry where my father worked\nwere shipped off to Stutthof, and you know, some of them died there. And so I\nremember that for \u2014 for weeks, my father and \u2014 and his other colleagues, you know,\nswitched locations where they slept every night, so that they could not be easily\nfound if \u2014 if \u2014 cause usually when they come to arrest you they come \u2014 they don\u2019t\ngo to your place of work, they \u2014 they come to \u2014 when you\u2019re sleeping in your \u2014 in\nFebruary 18, 2013\nyour apartment or your house, whatever. So they \u2014 they were \u2014 well, you know,\nscared of getting shipped off to Stutthof and so they \u2014 they did this. And so that\nwas, I think it was in this se-several, in the last months of \u2014 of the German\noccupation with. Cause this was going on already and they were trying to avoid\nthat.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t think that our parents, and of course nobody else talked to children\nabout what they knew what was \u2014 that was going on. Now of course, they all knew\nwhat was going on, but they were not sharing this with us. Of course, I think that\nmy mother was always, you know, aghast that this was going on, you know. And\nmy father, you know, our \u2014 this was a time when there were epidemics now going\nthrough. There was a typh \u2014 typhus epidemic which my sister and I spent a few\nweeks, you know, trying to \u2014 to get to \u2014 Deet. And I remember that, you know,\nbefore \u2014 before the, I guess ghetto, and \u2014 and the destruction of the Jews, our family\ndoctors were Jewish. Dr. Gehrler(ph) and doctor \u2014 I du \u2014 don\u2019t remember the\nname. And I think that \u2014 and then toward the end, I guess, they weren\u2019t \u2014 they\nweren\u2019t there any more, so that was, you know.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: I faintly remember how Dr. Gehrler(ph) looked, because he would come and\ntake care of us. But I don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t know anything else about him or what happened\nto him. He obviously wound up at some \u2014 in Paneriai or whatever concentration\ncamp, you know.",
        "A: It was, I think, always there, because I knew, of course by reading the inter \u2014 the\nna \u2014 the international press and \u2014 and some books about the Holocaust, and \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the destruction of the Jewish population of eastern Europe. And of\ncourse you would \u2014 could not see very much of this, or any of this in the Lithuanian\npress here in the United States, because that was like a taboo topic, you know.",
        "A: Well, I think many reasons. I think one reason was that the Lithuanians who\ncontrolled the press were themselves ashamed of what was going on. They did not\nwant to mention it or to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to even, you know, mention it in the \u2014 in their\npapers. Maybe it would go away, you know, that kind of thing. Now of course,\nthere were some who were openly anti-Semitic, who said that this was all, you\nFebruary 18, 2013\nknow, some nonsense that the Jews are \u2014 are spreading, you know. But that \u2014 that, I\nthink, was the minority, most of them just didn\u2019t want to, you know, hear about it.",
        "A: Because they knew that there was some \u2014 obviously they knew that there was\nsome involvement by \u2014 by Lithuanian people, not just the Germans.",
        "A: Because when you look at \u2014 at \u2014 I-I started researching this thing on my own a\nlong time ago. As soon as I got my degree and started working and se \u2014 then started\nreading books. And when the computers came out, I w \u2014 I went to the web pages of\nthe various organizations that deal with the history of the Holocaust, and you know,\nfind out what was going on. And after \u2014 and \u2014 Lithuania became independent again\nin \u201991, there was \u2014 there were publications by the \u2014 the history, a kind of, I guess\nhistory department or history institute, of various maps have to do with the history\nof Lithuania. And one of them was a map of where the executions of Jews took\nplace in 1941. And I was amazed to see that the whole map of Lithuania was\ncovered with these places, which also mentioned a number that were executed in\neach place.",
        "A: And \u2014\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Yes. And so it dawned on me then that this not something that could have been\ndone by, you know, couple of hundred of Germans. I mean, they had to \u2014 somebody\nhad to round up the Jews in each one of these localities, drive them \u2014 march them to\nthe graveside, and then whoever shot them, shot them, but the \u2014 the shooters\nthemselves did not do this, obviously.",
        "A: So that suggested to me that were a lot more people from the police forces of\nthat \u2014 of the provincial police forces, who were involved. And obviously this is the\ncase, an-and I\u2019ve been trying to find out who they were. And in fact, I\u2019m reading a\nbook now by \u2014 just came out recently, I forgot the name, where a woman PhD,\nSutton, I think was it \u2014",
        "A: Sutton, yeah. And when she shows a picture of the SS officers with the police\nchiefs of the Lithuanian provinces sitting, a nice picture. And of course I\u2014 I \u2014I\u20141t\ndoesn\u2019t take much \u2014 I don\u2019t have to be Einstein to figure out what they were talking\nabout there, you know.\nFebruary 18, 2013",
        "A: Because I am Lithuanian, I was born in Lithuania. What happened in Lithuania\nis important to me. And I want to know the truth. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s kind of\nhard to take to \u2014 to talk about the people who \u2014 who are, you know, accomplices in\nsomething of this sort. But if that happened, I want to know about it. I want to know\nwho these people were. Where th \u2014 where the \u2014 are th-they now. Most of them are\ndead, but, you know.",
        "A: Not too many. I think a lot of them take the attitude that oh, this happened, you\nknow, 60 years ago, forget about it, you know, it\u2019s gone, let\u2019s just go on with life.\nThey don\u2019t care what happened.",
        "A: Well, any human being should be concerned about a \u2014 a \u2014 some \u2014 something that\nhappened in which millions of innocent people were killed. And so I don\u2019t think\nanybody can just shake their head and \u2014 and forget about it. Unfortunately, th-things\nlike that haven\u2019t stopped happening since then, your \u2014 you look at Srebrenica, and\nlook at Rwanda and places like that. I mean, genocide, that goes on even now. And\nFebruary 18, 2013\nI think people have to be aware of this an-and try to stop it, be at \u2014 learn from\nmistakes that were made, or \u2014 or they weren\u2019t mistakes, it\u2019s just a misplacement of\n\u2014 of priorities \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 where the National Socialist Order simplistic solutions to \u2014 to complicated\nproblems. Okay, you don\u2019t like the Jews, the Jews you think are doing something\nagainst your, you know, countrymen. So, of course, you kill them all, that\u2019s the best\nway to get to redress the problem. And this is exactly what they were doing in\nBosnia and \u2014 and in Rwanda and places like that, and that should be something that\npeople would no longer think about.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m still continuing these interests. Ill be contacting you, trying to find\nsome more material about this.",
