        "Q: You were three years old now?",
        "A: Almost.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: Almost three, right.",
        "A: And there was a, on the road next to me there was a, well there was a British soldier, part of\nthe British Expeditionary Forces that were stationed in France and Belgium before the war\nstarted and the officer was looking up in the sky with binoculars. Then I fell asleep. When I\nwoke up he was gone and I asked my mother where was is this soldier. And she told me that the\nsoldiers were gone. And she seemed to be afraid at this point. Later I learned that the British\nsoldiers were evacuated from Dunkirk, which was just over the border of Belgium and France.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s move ahead then to right before liberation. You said your mother came and got\nyou from the family. Do you remember that?",
        "A: Yes, I remember because by this time I was very attached to the Von der Lindens, specially\nMrs. Von der Linden and she was very attached to me, like a son. And my mother showed up.\nShe came and visited me occasionally. But this time she came and she wanted to bring me to my\nparents\u2019 hiding place which was an apartment that looked like it was in a vacant building. And I\ndidn\u2019t know why she wanted to come and pick me up. I know, I was a little upset and Mrs. Von\nder Linden, also. But my mother said that she, I could come back after the liberation. So I went\nwith my mother. We took the street car. And at some point, at a stop, there was a German truck\ncame by. It was being pulled by a horse. Apparently it had run out of gas. And there was also a\nsoldier lying on top of the truck with a heavy machine gun. They looked very insecure. They\nkept looking around and like expecting some, maybe to be shot at which is, was the case. But I\ndidn\u2019t know that.\nMy mother said, going to that scene, she said, always remember this. Don\u2019t forget.",
        "Q: And you still have remembered it? Very vividly.",
        "A: Right. I have not forgotten it. So then we went, I thought we were going to the apartment\nwhere my parents were hidden, but in fact we went around the corner where there was a beauty\nparlor. And I didn\u2019t know this before but one day my mother had been walking on the street\naround the corner and some German soldiers came in the opposite direction on the same\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nsidewalk so she got a little panicky and she went into the beauty parlor. And once she was inside,\nshe was just standing there and the woman who ran this beauty parlor told her come in the back.\nThere were, in many stores there was a living area, behind the store. And above the store. And\nmy mother hesitated to go in the back. She was afraid. So the woman said that her husband was\nJewish which was the case. And so they became friends and their backyards were connected\ncause they were at right angles to each other and there was a wall separating them but they made\narrangements to go over the wall in case some danger would happen to one or the other.\nIn several cases, my parents went over the wall. I don\u2019t remember these peoples\u2019 names, went\nover the wall. One time I know it\u2019s because the Germans came to pick up the Jewish family\nliving in the house next door.\nSo they didn\u2019t know that it was, 1t wasn\u2019t for them, so they went over the wall. And as it was\ngetting close to liberation, my parents moved in with this couple and that\u2019s where my mother\ntook me also. By this time, or maybe a day or two later you could hear the cannon fire in the\ndistance. And so we knew that liberation was very, very soon to come. I remember once I was\nstanding in the entrance of the beauty parlor and I saw, on the corner, I saw a group of men\nwearing khaki, but they weren\u2019t soldiers. I didn\u2019t know who they were and they were carrying\ncases, looked like wooden cases and they opened them up and they were distributing rifles to\nother men that came along.\nSo I went back in the beauty parlor and I asked what\u2019s going on? Who are these people? And\nthey were actually Belgians who were getting ready to join the fight against the Germans. Then\nagain shortly after that, I don\u2019t know how many days went by, I think it was maybe one day or\nso. One morning my mother took me. She said we\u2019re going to go to, it was a park. I didn\u2019t know\nexactly why we were going there. And she said the English are there. I\u2019m not sure what she said\nactually but she said the English. She probably did but I\u2019m not sure. I didn\u2019t know what that\nmeant. And so we started going and I asked my mother, why isn\u2019t my father coming. And she\ntried to explain that he hadn\u2019t been outside, except to go to the beauty parlor for two years and he\nwas not ready to face people. So we were walking along. My mother was kind of in a hurry and\nwe were on one street. And we passed a tent that was burned. And I was fascinated. I don\u2019t know\nif it was, I assume it was a German tent, now looking back at it and probably a Molotov cocktail\nhad been thrown at it. It was burning on top. And I didn\u2019t seen any soldiers, just fire. So I\nstopped to look. My mother said let\u2019s go and grabbed me, my hand and continued with a lot of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nother people. Everybody was rushing to this park. And when we arrived there, there were tanks\nlined up in all the lanes. It was all very strange. There were a lot of, a lot of civilians around the\ntanks and everybody was happy and cheering and my mother took me towards a tank. There was\na soldier standing on it. And we looked at each other. We looked at the soldier, he looked at us.\nAnd then he put out his arms, downwards and my mother lifted me up and he grabbed me and \u2014\n(crying) \u2014 he pulled me up. And he held me in his arms. I looked at my mother and she said,\ngive him a kiss cause we didn\u2019t have any way of communicating with him. So I did and then I\nlooked back down and she was crying. So I couldn\u2019t understand. That was all, this job that my\nmother was crying and she said it\u2019s all right and I remember the soldier kept smiling as if it was\nok.\nAfter that, I don\u2019t remember all the details but my mother took me back to the Von der Lindens\nlike she had promised to do. But there was another reason. My brother and sister were by then\nthey were living in the Ardennes. And my parents wanted to pick them up which wasn\u2019t easy\nbecause we had to go there by train or municipal trams maybe. But they weren\u2019t running. So and\nthere was no communication so anyway I went back to the Von der Lindens and I didn\u2019t really\nknow how long I stayed there. I only figured out a few years ago when I went back to the Von\nder Lindens. Every house on the street had a huge flag of the allies, American, British, French,\nBelgian. There wasn\u2019t a red flag. And these flags, I know how people made them. They were the\nsize of double sheets hanging down in front of the houses.\nAnd then one day I went outside to play, as I usually did, but I quickly noticed that there were no\nflags on the houses. So I went in and asked Mrs. Von der Linden. She ran a store, sort of a\nhardware store. And she said that the Germans might be coming back and she seemed very\nanxious cause I didn\u2019t know this at the time. It was many years later that I figure out this was the\nBattle of the Bulge.\nSo this is the way I know that I spent much more time with the Von der Lindens after the\nliberation than I originally thought because the Battle of the Bulge was in December. The\nliberation was in September. And so I was still with the Von der Lindens at the time of the\nBattle of the Bulge, several months after the liberation.\nThen after probably a short time after that, \u2019m not sure. My parents had found, rented a house\nand the apartment where they lived was much too small for our family. And so they rented a\nhouse, a nice little house and my brother and sister and I were there, but also my cousin Lottie.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nHer father was my mother\u2019s brother. And her parents had been deported on the last transport\nfrom Belgium. Number, it was transport number 26. They also had a son who had the same\nname as my brother Manfred, or Mani. They were together. At some point they were hidden\ntogether by a priest who was well known for having saved a lot of, hundreds of Jewish children.\nFather Joseph Andre who has been recognized by Yad Vashem and many other organizations.\nHe placed the kids in convents or orphanages or in private families. But until he found the\nplaces they stayed with him. And both my cousin and my brother were with him when the\nGermans started watching him, suspecting that he was also involved in the underground. So he\nhad to go into hiding himself, the priest. And my brother went to live with a family that was not\nreally -- were friends of the family my sister was staying with in the Ardennes. But my cousin\ndidn\u2019t have any place to go and so he went back to his parents\u2019 apartment and they were\ndenounced. They were seen during an air raid, probably going to the shelter and they were\ndeported. My aunt is the only one that came back. But they had a daughter, Lottie, who was\nhidden someplace else. So my parents took in Lottie and she was living with us. We still didn\u2019t\nknow the fate of my mother\u2019s brother and his wife.\nOne day his wife came to the house. I happened to be there alone one afternoon. The doorbell\nrang and I opened the door and there was this strange woman. Somebody I didn\u2019t know and she\nalso looked strange a little bit. And she didn\u2019t say anything for a long time and I didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do. I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to let in strangers in the house and she didn\u2019t say anything\nand finally she, she said I\u2019m your aunt, Tante Dutche and I didn\u2019t recognize her. First two years\nhad gone by since we had gone into hiding. But also she had been in Auschwitz during that time\nand on a death march. And so when she told me her name I let her in and my parents came home.\nThat evening, after dinner, my aunt kind of spilled her guts, told the whole story from the\nbeginning to the end and they were all very, very quiet listening to her. And also at some point\nshe pulled up her sleeve and we all kind of looked or leaned over to see what was on her arm. It\nwas her number tattooed on her arm. (pause)\nI had started going back to school. I, actually I was going to school already when I was living\nwith the Von der Lindens. At first when they were living out in the country, it was a Flemish\narea. And the school was a Catholic school. There was Flemish which I didn\u2019t know. So that\ndidn\u2019t help me very much. Then later when they moved into the city, I went to a French speaking\nschool. But there were some gaps there. So when I moved in with my parents again I started\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nschool but I was a year behind. And later I caught up. It was a very small neighborhood school\nand the fourth, fifth and sixth grade were in the same room. So I could hear and see what this, the\nclass ahead of me was doing so by the end of the fifth year of school the teacher said I could go\non to the seventh grade which was a, in like what do you call it here, junior high school. So I\ncaught up there.\nIn 49, my brother got his visa to come to the States. Since my brother and sister and I were born\nin Germany, but our parents were born in Poland, we the kids got visas earlier because the quota\nwas shorter for Germans than it was for Poles. So my brother got his visa first. My parents were\nnot that interested in moving to the States. They got established again in Belgium. They were\nhappy there. But my brother wanted to go to the States. And shortly after that, that was in 1949.\nShortly after that my sister got her visa and she joined him. They went to Seattle, Washington.\nAnd then in 1951 my parents got their visas. They had, I guess I could have gone to the States\nbefore but I was only 11 when my brother left so they didn\u2019t want me to go without them. We\ncame to the States and arrived in New York, on the Queen Mary. And then \u2014",
        "Q: And before, we\u2019ll come to that in a minute. I just wanted to ask you some questions though.\nWas your family a very religious family?",
        "A: Not at all. I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Assimilated or secular.",
        "A: They were secular. We, we observed the High Holidays. I didn\u2019t have, I had my bar mitzvah\nand I had \u2014",
        "Q: That was later. I was talking about while you were still in Europe.",
        "A: Yeah well I had my bar mitzvah in Europe, also in 54. No, I mean. I would say they were,\nthey were a little religious but not very. My mother did keep kosher. What was before, I don\u2019t\nknow. My brother thinks that when they were in Germany, they were a little more mainly a little\nmore religious.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: What kind of work did your father do?",
        "A: He was in the tanning business.",
        "Q: Leather.",
        "A: Leather and hide, yes. Exactly.",
        "Q: You talked about your aunt and uncle. Did you know or did your parents know or did they\ntalk about what was happening during the 1940s to the Jews in Europe. Did they have any idea\nand did they share that with you, at the time?",
        "A: At the time itself. They didn\u2019t talk to me about it. I don\u2019t know what they knew. I \u2014",
        "Q: What did you know as a young child about, you knew you were Jewish?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you know why you were in hiding?",
        "A: I sort of knew that, that we were the -- that the Germans were looking for us and that\nsomething. I don\u2019t know if they ever said what would happen, maybe they didn\u2019t know at first.\nBut it was not a good thing. So \u2014",
        "Q: Was it something that you talked, as a young child, over with either the Von der Lindens or\nyour parents?",
        "A: No. The one thing that my parents told me. I remember that, the scene even. They said that I\nshould be very careful and not urinate in front of anybody in school or outside, not to show my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\npenis. And I said why. Advice to me. And they told me well it was because your penis 1s\ndifferent because we\u2019re Jewish.",
        "Q: Did you know what that meant?",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t know what Jewish meant but I knew it was different from others.",
        "Q: As far as other extended family, do you know what happened to them and if so what it was?\nYou talked about your aunt and your uncle.",
        "A: They were in Belgium.",
        "Q: Any other extended family?",
        "A: Yes there was my, on my father\u2019s side his two brothers had left Poland too. One was in Paris\nwith his wife. And he joined the French Foreign Legion and was sent to North Africa. And his\nother brother went to Tangier with his family, his wife. And there was another sister who was\nalso living in Paris with her husband and children. Her daughter is the same age as Iam. And\nafter the war started, they were able to get out of France, go to Spain. And I guess maybe\nPortugal and then they caught the ship. They didn\u2019t have visas for any country but when they got\nto Venezuela they were allowed to get off the ship so they are the ones who survived. My father\nhad three, two or three other sisters and his parents, they perished. They didn\u2019t survive. They\nwere in Poland.\nOn my mother\u2019s side there were 11 children, so ten siblings. Father had died before the war of\nnatural causes. This, her grandmother and all her siblings they were still in Poland and of those,\nno I shouldn\u2019t say they were all in Poland. One aunt and husband they were in Hungary and then\nfrom Hungary they got to England. He was a cantor and so he got a job in, not in England, in\nIreland. First. And so they were saved. Her, my mother\u2019s youngest brother, he and his wife went\neast when Germany invaded the Russian part of Poland. They went that way. And they were,\nended up in Siberia. And then later after Germany attacked Russia, the conditions got better and\nthere were many other Polish Jews were allowed to join in a Polish division in the Russian army.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nAnd they were sent to Iran, Persia for the oil fields, but on the way they deserted and went to\nPalestine, along with many others. Including the former president of Israel, Begin.",
        "Q: When you were staying at the Von der Lindens as a young child, were you able to lead any\nkind of a normal life and do you remember it as being a particularly fearful time?",
        "A: No, living with the Von der Lindens was a normal life. It was, I went out with them. I know\nwe went to movies. We\u2019d occasionally have ice cream in the park or something. Like I said, I\nwent to school.",
        "Q: When you saw a German soldier would that elicit any response?",
        "A: Well I think I think we were kind of told, I have sort of in the back of my mind, something\nlike don\u2019t look, don\u2019t look at --",
        "Q: Just keep walking.",
        "A: I'd see German soldiers in the street but you know I \u2014",
        "Q: But you had freedom of movement and you were able to play with other children? You were\nspeaking French?",
        "A: Yes, I spoke French. I was not supposed to speak German which I knew because I spoke it\nwith my parents, but \u2014",
        "Q: You spoke German with your parents?",
        "A: Yes, since they, they had, they didn\u2019t even know French. They lived in Germany for 20 years.\nSo the language was important. I think I was \u2014 there were some secrets that I was able to keep.",
        "Q: Did you take the Von der Lindens last name?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: Yes, actually I had a new name.",
        "Q: What was your name?",
        "A: Harry 1s not only British or American. It\u2019s also German name but it\u2019s definitely not Belgian\nor French so I was Henry Von der Linden and I had a whole new identity. I was this little\nBelgian boy, son of Adele and Adolf Von der Linden and I had an older sister named Florence.\nThey were, they were not religious at all and so that was not an issue at all.",
        "Q: Why do you think they took you in?",
        "A: Well you know I never asked but in, when I went to live in France to work actually in 1976, I\nwent to see them and my then girlfriend, American girlfriend who is now my wife, came to visit\nme and we went to Brussels to see the Von der Lindens. By this time, I think her husband had\ndied already. And Arlene, my wife, asked why she took us in. Or my sister and I and that was\nthe first time, I don\u2019t know why it never occurred to me to ask. What she said was that somebody\nknocked at the door and asked if she would be aware, if she would be willing to take in a child.\nShe didn\u2019t say Jewish. She wasn\u2019t told it was a Jewish child and it wasn\u2019t us, 1t wasn\u2019t my sister\nand I. It was a young teenage girl and she stayed with them for a while and then their, they\nbecame concerned because she had a boyfriend and they were not very careful. They wrote to\neach other and then really all the, a lot of things which probably would have endangered them all\nif somebody had looked into it. There was censorship of mail. So they asked the organization to\ntake the girl back. And so my sister and I were traded.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s move to after the war, the 45 to 1951 era. You said you went to school. Was this a\njoyous time for you? You were eight years old at the end of the war. And then as you said going\nto junior high.",
        "A: I was not unhappy I know that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: Did you talk to your parents about the previous years?",
        "A: Never talked.",
        "Q: They never talked. And your father was able to start his business again?",
        "A: Yes, yes he was. But no, we never talked.",
        "Q: Did you talk with other friends about it?",
        "A: We never, no. It\u2019s amazing. I, where we lived was not a Jewish neighborhood and the\nneighborhood I know Jewish friends. But then when I went to junior high there was a Jewish boy\nand it happened that his parents and my parents were friends. But it was like when the war, no\nwhen we were liberated and we all got together again as a family, I remember very distinctly my\nsister saying nothing happened to us. We were not caught and we didn\u2019t starve. So whatever we\nwent through was the same as everybody else, except we were Jewish. There were some more\ncomplications. But we never, even though the word survivor didn\u2019t exist, wasn\u2019t used like it is\nnow. But you would consider people who were in concentration camps to be, to have survived\nsomething. We didn\u2019t survive anything. We just, nothing. So we never talked about it. They\nnever inquired about us. I guess after a while my mother learned that all her siblings and\ngrandmother, sorry and her mother were dead and same with my father.\nI don\u2019t remember them every talking about it or -- With me. Or showing anything. I was a little\nsurprised maybe. How come I don\u2019t know when I started feeling it. It was strange that they never\ntalked about or showed emotions about it. But they didn\u2019t cry.",
        "Q: What did America mean to you at that point? Now you were going to be going to the United\nStates. Did America have any meaning for you? As a child?",
        "A: Well yes, as a child. As I said we were liberated by British but then soon American troops\ncame.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: Did you know any English?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. My brother knew some English and he liked to practice it and so he would hang\naround the soldiers and when he met Jewish soldiers, he invite them home for dinner. I didn\u2019t, I\nonly learned this maybe a year ago so. I thought it was my father who would invite them but it\nwas my brother and so we had a lot of soldiers. And also my mother had a cousin who was in the\nJewish brigade. He would come to our house with a British truck and give me rides. I remember\nthe there was a round sunroof and I\u2019d stand up on the seat. I didn\u2019t know then of course that he\nwas using, the truck was used for bringing the refugees to I think Italy from where the departed\nfor Palestine.\nAnd then you know before the war ended, an American came into our lives. It was my cousin in\nIreland had married an American officer, a dentist. Her brother was a dentist too. They met in the\nsame way. Her father had invited this young American officer who sort of was a rabbi, for\ndinner. And they got married. So and then he was sent to Belgium. He worked in the field\nhospital in Lieges which is quite close to Brussels. Belgium is very small. And he started\ncoming to our house every weekend. Whenever he was off. And he was able to do everything.\nFix things, things that my father would never be able to do. And so I was always happy to be\naround him.\nOne thing. He used to be a great story teller but he also had a very loud voice. So with my, we\nspoke German because we didn\u2019t know English and he knew, he had learned German in school.\nAnd, at least he learned in school. I don\u2019t know where else. He spoke it quite well and sometimes\nwe'd go out in public like to a restaurant or caf\u00e9 and he would talk but it was always in this\nbooming voice in German. I didn\u2019t know where to hide. I\u2019d keep my distance because\neverybody would start staring.",
        "Q: Did you feel very Belgian at that time?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t feel. I always felt like an outsider. But I still do anywhere. I am almost.",
        "Q: So when your folks said you were going to the United States what \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",

        "Q: You were happy. Why?",
        "A: Well.",
        "Q: You\u2019re a teenager now.",
        "A: Yeah, pre teenager, I\u2019d say 12, 13 when I became. So I don\u2019t know. My brother was already\nhere and also I guess, I know that with my friends we had arguments who were like for example\nwho was the best soldier. First of all there were, Germans were the best soldiers. Then the\nBritish were the . I mean that was my friend\u2019s argument. And then came the American soldiers,\nbut like one of my friends said, his friend was communist. General Motors won the war. I had\nno idea what General Motors was. Who was General Motors? And since then I have, in a way\nthat\u2019s been confirmed. I mean the fact that the United States had such an output of material that\nthey were able to build, to continue on. The Germans couldn\u2019t produce. So anyway I was, liked\nthe Americans better than the others and so I was prepared to come here. I was happy to come\nhere. I liked American things.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Well my friends probably did too. But there was a \u2014",
        "Q: By the time you came here, did you know any English?",
        "A: I knew a little. I start in the eighth grade. We started learning English in school. The teacher\nhad a British accent. And for me the last six months or after my parents got the visa, there was a\nperiod of time before we came. During that period they hired a tutor and but in reality I knew\nvery little. I remember we arrived in London. We went to visit my uncle and aunt who lived in\nLondon. And we crossed on the ship and then we took the train and we were at the train station\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nand we didn\u2019t know where we were, where to go. So this man came up to us and asked if he\ncould help. And like I think I was saying, I was saying was no thank you. In fact we could have\nused help.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did that happen, come about?",
        "A: Well, my parents had money and we traveled second class unfortunately for me. I mean they\nalways used to when we traveled. Every summer we went to the coast of Belgium and stayed in\nnice hotels and all, so my parents were well off but then rather, not wealthy, but well off. And\nso it didn\u2019t, I\u2019d say they felt it didn\u2019t suit them to go third class, tourist class. So we went second\nclass on the Queen Mary. It\u2019s the front of the ship 1s first class and the third, the back of the ship\nis the tourist class. And second class 1s the whole length of this huge ship. But there were very,\nvery few passengers in second class. If you can afford it you go first class. And there were no\nchildren. I was all by myself. I did meet a reporter for the Saturday Evening Post cause he didn\u2019t\nspeak French and I didn\u2019t speak English. And he, I don\u2019t know if it was his girlfriend or what.\nThere was a Chinese woman and by coincidence his sister lived, had lived for some time on the\nsame street where I lived in Brussels. And so they took me around and sort of entertained me.",
        "Q: When you docked in New York, was that anything special?",
        "A: You know I \u2014",
        "Q: Do you have memories of that?",
        "A: Yes, because this maybe embarrassing. I didn\u2019t know much I guess, I didn\u2019t know about the\nStatue of Liberty or I didn\u2019t know it was such a big deal. So one morning, the reporter, came,\nknocked on our cabin and said we\u2019re going to go by the Statue of Liberty. We\u2019re arriving. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nfirst I didn\u2019t know what it was I was going to see. But I went with him. And there was a lot of\npeople on the side of the ship looking toward the Statue of Liberty. And he said to me, aren\u2019t you\nexcited. And I got embarrassed because the French word excited is a sexual \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, ok, sexually excited.",
        "A: So I didn\u2019t know -- So I was looking forward to arriving in New York but and we were met\nby friends of mine, of my parents. They took us to a hotel. But I was really disappointed by\nNew York. It was so noisy, so dirty. I remember the first morning, or very early in the morning,\nthe garbage trucks picking up garbage cans and the smell in the subway was all very unpleasant.\nAnd of course, not knowing any English didn\u2019t help.",
        "Q: Right. And then how long did it take to get, did you go directly to Seattle?",
        "A: We spent a few days. There were other friends who met my parents. They were planning to\nlive in New York. We were just going to see my brother and sister. And but we went to LA,\ncause we knew some, my parents had some friends there too. And they had round, we bought\nround trip tickets flying. And when we arrived in Seattle, we found out that my brother was\nbeing drafted. The process had started of the Korean War and \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re now 14.",
        "A: NoIm still 13. It was March, 51 so I was still 13, yeah.",
        "Q: You had mentioned about a bar mitzvah. Did you \u2014",
        "A: I had my bar mitzvah in Brussels.",
        "Q: What was that like?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: Well I didn\u2019t like the whole process. I had a tutor also who came to the house. And first it\nwas a young woman, a pretty young woman. But so I mean after a while 1t was a man. And\nmaybe, the case, I didn\u2019t like having to learn to read Hebrew and prepare for the bar mitzvah. It\nwas all quite strange to me. Because didn\u2019t live in a milieu that --. So it was a relatively small\nbar mitzvah. I, my parents invited \u2014 we had friends. We did have relatives there. We had cousins.\nThen we lived in, they\u2019re still in Los Angeles, but he has Alzheimer\u2019s now. There was only one\nfriend that, I had one friend that, the boy who was in my class when I started junior high. And\nmy cousin, a cousin from, who came from Paris.",
        "Q: This was post war so there was no danger.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you could be relaxed.",
        "A: Yes, I was with my parents. Later I found out, there\u2019s a woman who made a film called As If\nIt Was Yesterday, I think is the title. And it\u2019s about Belgian, children being hidden in Belgium.\nAnd her parents were at my bar mitzvah. I never met them and I\u2019ve never met her. She lives in\nNew York. My sister has met her I think.",
        "Q: Well now you\u2019re visiting your family in Seattle.",
        "A: And we were going to stay just I don\u2019t know ten days or so and then go back to New York.\nAnd then so this was quite a shock to my parents. He, he had tried to stay out of the army by\nsaying that he was my parents\u2019 support. But my parents came with enough money that they\ndecided the draft board decided that they didn\u2019t need to be supported by my brother. So he was\ndrafted and went to basic training and then he was, he got ready to go to Korea. And this really\nhas changed with my father\u2019s hair I think turned white overnight. I\u2019ve heard that it happens that\n-- so then we decided, my parents decided to stay in Seattle because my brother had a business\nthere. It was food vending machines. But it\u2019s now started was the cousin, the American cousin\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nMatthew. His brother had a business, a vending machine business in Tacoma, Washington. And\nthey want to expand to Seattle. So my brother, you know partnered, with my father\u2019s money.",
        "Q: And you went on to school?",
        "A: I started school which is strange because as I said we arrived in March. So maybe we arrived\nin Seattle at the beginning of April and we were staying. My brother and sister had an apartment.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t matter. Pardon me. After being there for a while the neighbors told my sister and\nmy brother I should go to school. So my brother inquired where the nearest school was. And it\nwas a high school. And I was still in the eighth grade. And this high school it started in ninth\ngrade. I went to talk, my brother took me to talk to the principal and he asked, the principal asked\nme what I had studied. And my brother translated. And since I had studied many things that\nthey weren\u2019t doing in eighth grade in America, like studying math and algebra, geometry. The\nprincipal very wisely said well you can stay here. Normally we would have had to send you to a\njunior high school but he said you can stay here. The year is almost finished and it really is a\ntime to learn English. So they put me in a French class and a German class and a couple of\nEnglish classes. Then by fall I could speak English.",
        "Q: You could speak English.",
        "A: With an accent",
        "Q: Right and so you\u2019ve completed high school in Seattle?",
        "A: Yes, there was a high school where there were --",
        "Q: Then what did you do?",
        "A: I went to University of Washington and studied there for four years.",
        "Q: So you got a degree\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: I got a degree in French.",
        "Q: Did you talk about your childhood at all? Did people ask you?",
        "A: No. Never talked about it but one thing happened. I was having trouble writing, like for\nEnglish classes. And my advisor, then we had advisors, I remember his name. Otis, Mr. Otis.\nHe said in Belgium they teach writing very well. I didn\u2019t know how he knew. So he said, no\nthat shouldn\u2019t be a problem and he said well why don\u2019t you go see a counselor. At the counseling\ncenter. So I did and for some reason there were two people, two, I think they were psychologists\nand they were sitting across from me and one of them said well tell us about yourself, your\nbackground. And that was the first time I started talking about myself and I started crying.",
        "Q: Were they sympathetic?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, they were sympathetic. They said that I needed counseling that it would be long\nterm and they only offered short term there. So that they recommended I see a psychiatrist. So I\ntold my parents and said, why should you see a psychiatrist. You\u2019re not crazy. So I didn\u2019t go to a\npsychiatrist. Until many years later. I was in my late 20s and I was \u2014 a friend of mine said he\nwas seeing somebody and said he was very good. He was Jewish and he was very good. I didn\u2019t\nknow exactly what that meant but I kind of felt, maybe I could see him. So I called his office and\nhe told me he\u2019s all booked up. He couldn\u2019t see me. He wasn\u2019t taking any new patients. But\nthere was somebody in this same suite of offices who might. And so I made an appointment with\nthis other psychiatrist who was traditional. He was Freudian.",
        "Q: Freudian.",
        "A: He never said anything. He just, felt like he had me talk and he wrote notes. Except one time\nhe reacted. I don\u2019t remember what I told him but something like I\u2019m lucky and I don\u2019t know\nwhat I was referring to. Maybe I met a girl or something. And all of a sudden he blew up. He\nsaid you\u2019re lucky, you think you\u2019re lucky. You think you\u2019re special don\u2019t you? And I couldn\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nrespond. I mean and \u2014 he didn\u2019t know anything about me. Because he had never asked and I\nnever talked about my past and you can look at my early childhood. You know I was lucky. I had\nlet\u2019s see in Belgium I had a 50, 50 chance of surviving. Maybe less because I was a child. Let\u2019s\nsee if I had been caught, it would have been less. So definitely I would say yes, I was lucky. But\nfor some reason he reacted in this way. Shortly after that, I quit. When he raised his rate, I took\nthe opportunity of quitting. And this happened again. When I, did I say I lived in Vancouver.",
        "Q: No you did your four years in Seattle and then \u2014",
        "A: Ok, then I went to work for a year. I went to save my money so I could go to Paris. I had read\nthe Razor\u2019s Edge, Somerset Maugham and my parents said later when I was with my sister when\nshe was dying and we had this more intimate kind of conversation, said my mother who by that\ntime was dead, said that that book changed my life. And I didn\u2019t even know that my mother was\naware. But anyway I wanted to go to Paris. So I worked for year. And then I went to Paris for a\nyear.",
        "Q: What did you do in Paris?",
        "A: I went to a school. Well it was the Sorbonne but it was a special institute for teachers of\nFrench abroad. And so I got a certificate there. And then I wanted to go to Israel to a kibbutz.\nAnd I had gone to a party. A Jewish professor had invited me to a party.",
        "Q: In Paris?",
        "A: In Paris which is sort of unusual because professors and students at least at that time didn\u2019t\nmix. But she invited another student from the class. A Jamaican girl and I. At the party I met an\nemployee of the embassy. I don\u2019t know what he did but I told him that I wanted to go to a\nkibbutz and but I didn\u2019t know how to arrange it. So he suggested that I go to a kibbutz which has\nan ulpan where they teach you Hebrew. So you work half a day and you study for half a day.\nAnd he told me about one. I just followed what he told me and I don\u2019t remember what steps I\ntook that I arranged to go to a kibbutz Ein Hashofet. And so that\u2019s what I did after the summer.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: So you went from Paris to Israel?",
        "A: Yeah, I traveled in Europe and in Turkey.",
        "Q: did you go back to Brussels?",
        "A: Well I was living in \u2014",
        "Q: In Paris.",
        "A: Yes, I went to visit the Von der Lindens. I was always very \u2014",
        "Q: You kept up a connection with them.",
        "A: I kept, yes, but what I was going to say. In Brussels I always felt kind of sad, a little bit\ndepressed. Everything was gray, did I Paris. I meant Brussels. Brussels is gray. And other parts\nthough Belgium I liked. I liked the coast, and the Ardennes. But in Brussels I always felt as I --\nsaid not well. But I would go to see the Von der Lindens.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay on the kibbutz? A year?",
        "A: A half a year and then I moved to Tel Aviv. And taught English in the language school.\nMeanwhile in the kibbutz I had met an Israeli born girl who, whose parents, her family had\nmoved from Israel to Turkey when she was nine years old.",
        "Q: To Turkey?",
        "A: Yeah. They had, her father was Austrian but this whole family lived in Turkey and the mother\nwas Greek background, Sephardic. And they had lived in Istanbul. And so they went back\nbecause the father had problems with his eyes and with the light in Israel. So she when her\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nmother was 16, she, her mother died and -- when she was 16 her mother died. So then her aunts\nwere pushing her to get married. And so she, to escape, she and her younger brother came to\nIsrael. She was 18. He was 17. And I met them. They were at the kibbutz. And so we started a\nrelationship and after I had been in Israel a year, I had applied to go to graduate school at the\nUniversity of Washington and so I was accepted and since -- the girl\u2019s name was Tilda. She\ncouldn\u2019t come without being married or \u2014 and because we wanted to, we got married. She was\n18. Iwas 24. And we went back to England. To see obviously she had never been there. She\ndidn\u2019t speak English. She spoke five languages. We spoke French to each other. Cause that\u2019s a\nminority language in Turkey. She had gone to French schools also.\nSo we were married three years and then she was not happy, not, 1t was a difficult adjustment for\nher. Meanwhile her father and her other brother. Oh, actually she had two brothers. Two\nbrothers came to the States and they went to live in Los Angeles and she, then she went to Los\nAngeles after we were married three years.\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nVolunteer collection interview with Harry Markowicz. This is track number two and we were\ntalking, that you were back in Seattle, going to graduate school. And how long were you, for\nhow long were you in graduate school?\nHarry Markowicz: For over two years. I was working on my masters which I didn\u2019t get. I got\ninto a program that they -- the university had set up between linguistics, psychology and French,\nliterature, not French literature. And so it involved almost three departments and there were a lot\nof infighting between the faculty. So many of us didn\u2019t get our degrees because each one tried to\nget very high level of requirements for their field. And I was teaching French. Then for some\nreason two people in the same week told me about this new university in I forgot the \u2014 After that,\nsorry, after that I got a job in a community college in Tacoma, Washington. It was called\nTacoma Community College. I taught French there for two years. Then these two friends told\nme about this new university called Simon Frazer University in British Columbia near\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nVancouver and for some reason, both said this separately you'll fit in there. So I didn\u2019t know\nexactly what they meant but I called the chairman of the foreign language department, or maybe\nI\u2019m sorry linguistics. It was a combination. And I told him I was interested and he said ok come\non up. This was 67. And we can talk. So after a few minutes he offered me a position as an\ninstructor. I didn\u2019t have a transcript or anything. And then he introduced me to some of the\npeople in the department and the French woman and she told me she was a graduate associate. I\nknew what a graduate assistant was because I had been one but it\u2019s a little higher level and more\npaid. So I went back to the chairman of the department and said what is this graduate associate\nthing. Can I do it? Cause I don\u2019t have a PhD and I'd like to work on it. He said oh sure, you can\ndo that too. And so I, and they paid very well too. So I became a graduate associate and taught\nFrench and I got my MA degree there.\nMeanwhile, while I was there, I got interested in sign language, completely by chance. I\u2019ll make\nit very brief. I had in mind a research project involving linguistic universals which had become\npopularized or not only got popular but they were introduced by Chomsky, Noam Chomsky.\nAnd but it involved doing a little experiment with artificial languages to discover whether one\ncould learn a language more easily if it had universals. But everybody already knows a language\nso that the experiment was not feasible until one day I read in a book called the Biological\nFoundations of Language that deaf children, before they go to school don\u2019t know any language.\nSo I decided ah ha, that\u2019s my, those are going to be my subject. Just about this time there was a\nletter published in the Vancouver newspaper in response to an article which I had not seen. But\nthe writer wrote that so and so, a deaf man has a little deaf girl, he and his wife are deaf. And\nhave a deaf girl who was two years old and she has a vocabulary of, maybe she was two and a\nhalf, of several hundred signs which she combines in two word sentences. Two sign sentences.\nThis was exciting because that\u2019s what hearing children in whatever language they learn. So I\ncontacted the writer of the letter. He was a director of social welfare agency.\nAnd we talked and I also met a deaf man there. He introduced me to this deaf man he was\nwriting about who I don\u2019t remember how we talked, having a long conversation. And it became\nclear to me that if you\u2019re deaf and you grow up in a deaf environment, namely deaf residential\nschools, that it\u2019s very similar to being Jewish.",
        "Q: Why do you say that?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: Because you are in a minority and you\u2019re part of a larger society but you\u2019re always a\nminority. And the kind of relationships that develop among deaf people are the same kind of\nrelationships you have among Jewish people. For example, a deaf American and a deaf Japanese\nmay have more in common than a deaf American and a hearing American in some ways. There\u2019s\na language aspect. There\u2019s a whole lot of, though later in my life I started writing about the\ncommunity, the deaf community as an ethnic group. Anyway this became very fascinating for\nme. I got hooked. So I started reading books related to deafness and either the books didn\u2019t\nmention sign language or else they denigrated it by saying it\u2019s not a real language because it\ndoesn\u2019t have articles. And it doesn\u2019t have a passive voice which is pure nonsense. There are\nplenty of languages that don\u2019t have articles or a passive voice, not a requirement for that to be a\nlanguage.\nSo that immediately got a rise out of me and the director of this institute for the deaf told me\nabout a professor at Gallaudet University, William Stokoe who had worked on sign language.\nAnd suggested I contact him. So I did. And immediately Stokoe sent me back books, several\nbooks that he had written on sign language. So I, with my masters papers on sign language. This\nwas in 1969, 70 at a time when sign language was not really accepted in America.\nSo I -- it was a cause. It was not my cause. I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t fight for my cause, whatever\nthat would be but I found that I wanted to take part in this fight for recognition of sign language\nand I could see eventually that it has to do with deaf civil rights. So that\u2019s what I did, get\ninvolved in. Eventually in what year was that. In 72 I came to Washington to go to Georgetown\nto work on my PhD at the suggestion of Bill Stokoe. And so I studied at Georgetown and then I\nstarted working at Gallaudet in William Stokoe\u2019s linguistic research lab where he did research on\nsign language. And it was funded by various grants, National Science Foundation and so on.\nWhen the money started running out, I was no longer working there. I worked there three years.\nAnd I had gone to Paris during the summer of 75 with several colleagues from Gallaudet. One in\nparticular had a grant from maybe it was National Science, no it was National Endowment for\nthe Humanities, a grant to study the historical foundation of American Sign Language, but its\norigins are from French sign language.\nSo I was the French expert. My task was to go into the library at the school for the Humane\nschool for the deaf in Paris and do research there on what was available on French sign language.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nThere I met a sociologist who had some interest in deafness. And then he knew the history of,\nthis history of deafness, the controversy. But he felt that all, he had been led to believe that with\nthe new kind of hearing aids that were developed that that was not the problem anymore. And so\nwe got involved and he invited me to stay with him and I told him what I knew that. So he, next,\nthe next summer there was the world congress of the deaf took place in Washington. It takes\nplace every four years. He came here and then stayed afterwards with me and saw what we were\ndoing in the linguistic research lab. And then he asked me if I would like to go back to France,\nwork with him, to get French sign language recognized in France. So I took a year. He got a\ngrant there. And went to Paris. That was 76. Fall of 76. And the year stretched to five years.\nAnd in the meantime, after the first year I got married to my current wife Arlene who I knew\nalready from Washington.",
        "Q: And then you came back after the five years and did you go back to Gallaudet?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then how long did you stay at Gallaudet?",
        "A: Eventually, I got a position in the English department and I taught English 25 years. I know\nthe total number of years 1s 29 and, 29 years and nine months.",
        "Q: So now you are retired?",
        "A: I retired in 2008.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about two other topics. One is your experience as a volunteer at the Holocaust\nMuseum. That\u2019s number one so let\u2019s, how did you happen to decide to become a volunteer?",
        "A: That was very easy. I know a lot of people who are volunteers. In 1985, I was one of the small\ngroup who were founders of an organization that Congress called, if I remember correctly, child\nsurvivors of the Holocaust in the Washington Baltimore area. It was Flora Singer who got us\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\ntogether. First time was seven and we\u2019ve been meeting ever since, once a month. And we also\nhave, it\u2019s become international and we have yearly international meetings. And so in this group a\nlot of people were volunteering.",
        "Q: How did you get to meet Flora and how did \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s an interesting question. One day I wasn\u2019t teaching. I guess I was home at lunchtime. I\nturned on the TV while I was eating and there was the Povich program, I forgot his first name.",
        "Q: Maury",
        "A: Maury Povich. It was called. Anyway she was on the show with her cousin and I \u2014",
        "Q: And you contacted her?",
        "A: Yeah well I asked my, that was the other thing. My wife to contact her because I couldn\u2019t\ntalk. I was just \u2014 so she called the station and eventually Flora called me and she invited me to\ncome to the meeting of the, now I don\u2019t remember what the adult organization 1s called. I went\nand it was obviously not for me.",
        "Q: Is this the hidden child?",
        "A: No, no not, this is not the, this is the adults. This is the people who went through camps\nmostly and who were older than me, 20 years older. And maybe not that much but there is a huge\ndifference. And to them, nothing happened to us because we were just kids. We don\u2019t even\nremember and, and so, once we invited one of their members to come to one of our meetings.\nWe tried to get closer to them. This is a long time ago. Probably 20 years ago. And at some\npoint this man said exactly those words. But what do you know? You don\u2019t remember anything.\nYou were kids. So I got back to Florence and I you know, I don\u2019t fit in there. She said yeah I\nknow. There are several people who feel the same. Flora was sort of in between in ages. And she\nspoke Yiddish fluently. So she said well you know I\u2019|l get you together, just hold on. So she did.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nShe got us together. And we met and decided to meet again. The beginning year or so were very\ndifficult because different individuals had different ideas what the group should be. But\neventually got, sort of worked out.",
        "Q: And then how did you hear about the Museum?",
        "A: No, I knew I, people in the child survivors group, there were several that volunteered. There\nwas also \u2014",
        "Q: When did you start volunteering?",
        "A: In 2009. What happened also, during the year 2000 I taught a seminar on the Holocaust, a\nseminar, an honors seminar at Gallaudet on it. Since I knew so many, the way I structured the\nclass was every --- we met once a week for three hours and I invited my friends to come and\nmake a presentation. Not all of my friends. The first time I invited two historians from the\nMuseum, Patricia Heberer and I\u2019m blocking on the other one.",
        "Q: And you signed those talks?",
        "A: No, we had interpreters for that. I mean there was a reason. Yeah but also instead of just\nhaving it as a class, I, we had this in an auditorium. It was open to everybody. And somebody\nfrom the Museum suggested to have a general who was one of the liberators. I\u2019ve forgotten now\nhis name also. But he was well known and he was Jewish. So I had him come. So and I\nselected people from my group who represented the whole scale of things from people who were\nin camps. The majority in our group were not in camps. But sharing their experiences, unique\nand everybody, there was somebody who came in a group of almost a thousand who were\nbrought to the state, 44 and they were sent to Oswego and put in a camp. So there was a, and\nkindertransport and so on.\nSo I knew I was going to do it but after I retired. I don\u2019t know why it took me a year. I would\nask who do I contact and oh, Pll let you know next time. And then it wasn\u2019t just their fault. It\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nwas mine. I could have just, I knew quite a few people already so, at the Museum itself. I could\nhave, but I don\u2019t know why. So \u2014",
        "Q: What do you do at the Museum?",
        "A: I work with visitor services. Initially I thought I should do that so that I can see what it\u2019s like.\nAnd I did a little work for Judy Cohen. On the \u2014",
        "Q: The photo archivist?",
        "A: Yes, but I wasn\u2019t working. I didn\u2019t see -- what did Ido. The Salvadorian project. And it was\nkind of tedious and not very exciting. Maybe she gave me something else to do also. But\nmeanwhile, Theresa Pollin had asked me to translate letters that a family wrote. They were\ntraveling through Europe. I think they started in France. Letters were in several languages but a\ngood part were in French. Letters that were sent to their relatives in the states. They didn\u2019t, the\nfamily didn\u2019t survive but the letters obviously ended up in the Museum. And I agreed to do it.\nAnd she gave me copies, but my sister wrote many letters during the war to my parents but they\ndidn\u2019t go directly to my parents. And she wrote in French, of course she wrote them in French.\nBecause of censorship. And my sister is dead. She died about 15 years ago but her daughter who\nlives in Israel, she has the letters but she doesn\u2019t know French. She wants, she\u2019s asked already\nseveral years ago, she asked my brother and I to translate them. And for some reason, we\u2019ve\ndone a few. My brother more than I. But some of it you have to decode because of the\ncensorship. You couldn\u2019t just so \u2014 I don\u2019t know why. I haven\u2019t really sat down with my sister\u2019s\nletters and I felt if I\u2019m going to translate letters, I\u2019d rather translate my sister\u2019s letters first and so\nI didn\u2019t do the other ones.",
        "Q: What is your feeling when you walk into the Museum building? Do you have any special\nfeeling when you walk in?",
        "A: Well one thing, I don\u2019t feel \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: Any connection? Do you feel any connection?",
        "A: I feel a lot of connection with the people.",
        "Q: Or the exhibits?",
        "A: I\u2019ve always been interested in Holocaust thing. In 1957 when I was at the University of\nWashington, majoring in French literature, I had a professor. He was French. He might have\nbeen Jewish but he, at this time he was Catholic. He and his wife were in the States when the\nwar broke out. He was \u2014 he had a year or something, so they stayed in the States. So one day in\nclass he started talking about \u2014 he told me later and I realized who it was he was talking about\nEichmann and the deal that he was trying to work out with Cant. The guy\u2019s name is Cantor I\nthink, the Jewish --.",
        "Q: Kastner.",
        "A: Kastner, thank you. And but at that time I didn\u2019t know any of this. And he was telling this\nstory of the, how they were bargaining and then Kastner or somebody else said well how can we\ntrust you when you delivered 10,000 trucks which they didn\u2019t have of course and were never had\ngotten. How do we know you're going to release, whatever one million Jews or whatever it was\ngoing to be. And Eichmann said you have the word of a German officer. So I started going to\nthe library at the University of Washington and you know at that time, that was 57, it was very\nearly. The French professor had used the word let\u2019s see, in English, no in French it\u2019s litterateur\nconcentrasonaire, the literature of concentration camps. In France it apparently existed already\nexisted already. But not here. So anyway, I went to the library and got books. I remember one\nspecifically Bergen Bel was the title and it was all about Bergen Belsen. It was each chapter was\nwritten by a different person. Like an Englishman, soldier, an inmate from the camp. And it was\nfascinating. So I\u2019ve always been interested in releasing.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: Are there any particular exhibits at the Museum that resonate with you? The permanent\nexhibits or anything?",
        "A: Well yeah. Come to think of it. There\u2019s a wall of rescuers and you know most people have\ntheir names and then there\u2019s the priest who saved my brother. He\u2019s got a whole. And then the\nwoman who was \u2014 found places for my sister and I. She also has a plaque with \u2014 because she\nsaved hundreds.",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: You know. I can\u2019t remember it. She married an Italian who was teaching at Chapel Hill. My\nsister found this out. Both the priest and this woman. First name is Jeanne, and my sister\nremembered they called her Mademoiselle Jeanne.",
        "Q: Do you find you are more comfortable among other people who survived the war than those\nwho weren\u2019t or did not experience it?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Yes, definitely.",
        "Q: Is it easier to talk to them than someone who did not have to live through it the way you did?",
        "A: Even if we all talk about the war but you know there is something that we have in common.",
        "Q: An unspoken connection.",
        "A: When I was at Georgetown, I, when I first came I was staying with a young woman I met at a\nconference cause I didn\u2019t know anybody in Washington. And then in the seminar a -- she pointed\nto a woman and she said I think she\u2019s French also. So during the break I went up to this woman\nand I asked her where she was from and she said France, Switzerland and after a while she said\nIsrael. And then she said, and you. That\u2019s always a difficult question because I have to think\nwhat am I going to say. Seattle. Belgium, Germany. So while I was thinking what am I saying. I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nalready knew obviously what the situation was. But I was still thinking. She said you don\u2019t have\nto say anything.",
        "Q: It\u2019s unspoken. What is your opinion about the non-survivor volunteers at the Museum?",
        "A: I think they\u2019re wonderful.",
        "Q: Jewish and non-Jewish.",
        "A: yeah well the ones I\u2019ve worked with, I work on Tuesday afternoon. Right now they\u2019re all\nJewish and I don\u2019t know how it is but I think it\u2019s the same with other people. I mean other teams\nor whatever on other days. We really form like a very supportive group, even if it was the case\nthat another day would be better, more convenient for me. I wouldn\u2019t think of changing. I really\nlook forward to going. You asked me how I feel. I look forward to going. Already on Sunday \u2014",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: One 1s this bond with these people. The other is I like the feeling while interacting with the\nvisitors. They encourage us to enter the, enter into conversation with them.",
        "Q: What do you say about your background when you speak to visitors?",
        "A: No I don\u2019t. It\u2019s funny cause no I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t. I said to Debby. They made buttons for us that\nsay I\u2019m a survivor. Do you have any questions? I don\u2019t know but people don\u2019t even wear them.\nBut I asked for one and no, it\u2019s my own little private joke that I feel like putting it behind a lapel\nof my jacket because I\u2019m a hidden child. No I don\u2019t. Well I have on occasion but like people\ncome up to the desk, the information desk where I work and say I heard there are Holocaust\nsurvivors that we can talk to and I say yeah they\u2019re over there. These two ladies, you can go\nover there and talk to them. Once one of my Tuesday afternoon group came up and whispered to\nme, this woman and her daughter would like to speak to a Holocaust survivor but they went for\nlunch and they\u2019re not there. Do you mind talking to them? I said ok. And so I talked them. They\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nasked me, I mean not the mother but the daughter. She had maybe a school project. I don\u2019t\nknow. Yeah, but I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t normally bring it up?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Have you ever encouraged other friends\u2019 of yours who were survivors to work at the\nMuseum, to volunteer?",
        "A: Yes, indirectly. This woman that I mentioned that I met at Georgetown. When I -- lost\ncontact with her. It was, after, I don\u2019t remember. Oh when I went to France after that I lost\ncontact with her. But I, once I started working at the Museum I joined the Echoes writing\nworkshop, echoes in memory. And one of the, maybe it was the first story I wrote. And so I\nthought hm, Ill try calling her. I knew she traveled back and forth between here and Geneva a\nlot. I think her mother was living there still. And I called and I left a message on the phone. And\nshe called me back and we got together and we don\u2019t see each other that often because she lives\nin Potomac or McLean. But we correspond by email a lot. And she goes, still she goes to\nGeneva. She\u2019s there right now. Constantly going back and forth.\nBut I don\u2019t want to suggest it. In fact I had brought it to one of our meetings, child survivor\nmeetings and I said that\u2019s not for me. And she didn\u2019t come back again. So I, but I know she\u2019s\nvery interested. I tell her about the things that are going on. And the peril to the work, the\nvarious events that we get to participate in like the president coming to, to speak to. I got to\nshake his hand and I got a wonderful picture of it.\nBut I don\u2019t want to suggest it, no. And I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know anybody else who is not already\naffiliated with one of the groups in lives here. Maybe have been all good. I was just reading a\nreview.",
        "Q: Do you have children?",
        "A: We have one son.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: One son. When he was growing up did you talk about your experiences to him?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You did not.",
        "A: No, but \u2014",
        "Q: When did he learn about what you went through?",
        "A: He was very little, when I still used to read books to him. I had a copy of Maus. And for\nsome reason he picked it. He wanted me to read it. So I read him. I skipped a few parts here and\nthere. And we adopted a, adopted him. He\u2019s from Brazil and he doesn\u2019t, didn\u2019t have a bar\nmitzvah because we were going to have it in Israel but then my wife got vertigo problems. She\ncouldn\u2019t fly. Anyway after that he didn\u2019t want to have a bar mitzvah so he didn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t\nfeel, he doesn\u2019t identify as being Jewish. That\u2019s neither here nor there. But he knows, like\nsometimes he calls me and says dad there\u2019s a film that you might want to see on TV. But we\nhaven\u2019t talked. I\u2019ve given him a couple of the texts that I\u2019ve written for Echoes and he hasn\u2019t\nsaid much but he said he briefly liked that. Unlock the door or something but he doesn\u2019t ask me.",
        "Q: How old is he now?",
        "A: He\u2019s 26.",
        "Q: When he was your age that you were during the war, you know a young child. Did that bring\nback memories for you about what you went through?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if it brought back memories but I was aware. I was thinking oh that\u2019s when I\nwas there and this was when we were liberated and trying to imagine what could have been, how\nI could have gone through those things and \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: Right, such a young child. So it did elicit \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Are there any sights today or sounds or smells that trigger memories of the war and you being\nhidden and anything that ever triggers it?",
        "A: (pause) Some other things that trigger. Sometimes it\u2019s something that\u2019s said. There\u2019s a film.\nI think it\u2019s called 80\" blow. It\u2019s a documentary and it\u2019s about probably the Warsaw ghetto. I\ndon\u2019t remember any more. And this, the scenes that were shot then and I can watch that without\n\u2014 it doesn\u2019t bother me. I can watch bodies being bulldozed and \u2014 but little things. In this 80\"\nBlow there is a scene which two little boys are sitting on the sidewalk, little, little boys and one\nof them they, as people walk by he says in Yiddish a shtick of a broit [ph], a piece of bread. If\nyou said in English, doesn\u2019t do it. Doesn\u2019t do anything but in Yiddish. So there are lots of\nthings but it\u2019s not obvious. I haven\u2019t categorized them but \u2014 I get teary easily.",
        "Q: You said you were in Israel during the Eichmann trial and you had to hear about it.",
        "A: Well I didn\u2019t really know I was going on that . When I went to my uncle and aunt they would\ngive me a little \u2014 well the, you know there was no television in Israel at the time so you know I\ndidn\u2019t see very much as far as I remember. Maybe they did, they didn\u2019t know either. It was such\na big thing and I was there but I was out of it . It was the same with the Cuban missile crisis. We\nwere in England. We met, my new wife and we traveled to London where my parents were and\nmy uncle said something about, I guess we were watching the news and he said you know there\nmight be war or something. And I had no idea because we hadn\u2019t kept up with the news.",
        "Q: Did that shake you up, the fact that you would live through another war?",
        "A: No I don\u2019t, I thought it, maybe I thought he was exaggerating. I don\u2019t know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: Would you be a different person today if you hadn\u2019t had the childhood that you had? Has it\naffected you?",
        "A: I think it has but of course there is no way of knowing but I think it has. One thing I wasn\u2019t\neven aware but I read an article. There were two articles I think it\u2019s in the Shoah foundation\nnewsletter or newer magazine. There was an article about a woman who was a hidden child and\nthen the next thing was an article that she wrote herself. And she works in the medical school. I\ndon\u2019t know if she was a medical doctor or what. But she made several statements that I can\nidentify with. One is indecision. And \u2014",
        "Q: In what sense?",
        "A: Well this writing business has been nagging me forever. Having trouble writing. So I was\nseeing a psychiatrist and \u2014",
        "Q: When you say trouble, are you in the physical act of writing or what do you mean by trouble\nwriting?",
        "A: You know I can\u2019t write and I correct myself so many times",
        "Q: You mean picking the right words? Physically?",
        "A: Oh yeah, physically yes. So one day the door is open. It doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\ncan go this way or that way. It has no consequences. That never occurred to me before. So she\ntalks about this. Another thing is feeling that people perceive you differently. This woman\nobviously is very accomplished. She\u2019s teaching in medical school in New York and she said that\nshe feels like a fake. And I have the same feeling. I feel like a fake. A fake --",
        "Q: I know but in what sense do you \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: Whatever I get recognition for I don\u2019t deserve. Or people take me for more intelligent than I\nam. That what I do knowing people, sometimes I get praised for my writing and I think well \u2014",
        "Q: And why do you think that is that you feel you don\u2019t deserve it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t associate it with my experience, but this woman in her article that\u2019s\nwhat she wrote about.",
        "Q: Do you think maybe it\u2019s because you had to lead two different lives? You were that other\nlittle boy Henry which you know what I mean. So who are you really, in a sense. As a young\nchild when your personality is being formed.",
        "A: I think you\u2019re right.",
        "Q: That\u2019s an interesting comment what you said.",
        "A: Well I think your comment is also very interesting because sometimes I think about it. I\nmean it\u2019s comes to me as leading two lives, specially when you\u2019re so little.",
        "Q: Right and your personality hasn\u2019t been formed yet. You were such a young child. What are\nyour thoughts about Germany and Germans today?",
        "A: Today I think what happened in Germany could happen anywhere. I mean Germany was one\nof the most advanced countries, educational. The culture and in every field they were tops you\nknow, among the tops. And it happened. The conditions made it possible to happen. I could see it\nhappen here.",
        "Q: You could see it happening again.",
        "A: I mean not there but I can even can see it here or anywhere.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "Q: In today\u2019s world.",
        "A: In today\u2019s world yes.",
        "Q: You could see it happening.",
        "A: The conditions get, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Do you think your political views have been affected by what your experiences were?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how to link that up. I mean there are many people who have not had my kind of\nexperience but feel the same way politically.",
        "Q: You had mentioned about, you were active in the rights for the deaf, civil rights for the deaf.\nWere you active in the civil rights movement in generally. I mean you came from a situation\nwhere your civil rights were deprived and your parents and so forth. Has that made you more\nattuned?",
        "A: Maybe more attuned but I didn\u2019t, I\u2019m reticent to actually take part in \u2014 I was in British\nColumbia for five years, when \u2014 during 68 and so on. So there was also the movement but I was\nafraid I was going to be evicted, reported at Simon Frazer University. Students took over the\nuniversity. And lots of the people I knew were like in the building.",
        "Q: Were demonstrating?",
        "A: Well they were in the building and the mounted police arrived. And I was outside but I didn\u2019t\ngo in the building. I was afraid what the consequences would be \u2014 but also I\u2019m very dished, but I\nnever told people I was Jewish either. I think the first time was I mean some people saw me. In\nthe high school I went to in Seattle it was in a formerly Jewish neighborhood. There were still a\nlot of Jewish kids, 50 percent or more you know. So there it was not an issue. But later on, as\nstudent at University of Washington, I remember being in a restaurant having a place with my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nfriends, several friends. I don\u2019t know why I said I was Jewish and they said you\u2019re Jewish. They\nwere like it was a surprise to them but that was the first time that I remember saying it to\nanybody who was not already -- I don\u2019t know how they, I didn\u2019t know how they would react to\nthat idea.",
        "Q: Has, what is your feelings now religiously in a sense of, you said your family was quite\nsecular.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you feel yourself still quite secular or did your experience change that?",
        "A: No it hasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Your thoughts about being Jewish in general?",
        "A: I think I feel very Jewish but very, very Jewish but not because of religion. Some of our\nrelatives, my sister married an Orthodox man and her children are very, quite Orthodox.\nEspecially the son. And my wife has, she has several siblings. But one of them also is very\nOrthodox and married a very Orthodox man and seven children are very Orthodox. So it\u2019s kind\nof strange sometimes. I think. I don\u2019t need this. I don\u2019t or maybe I don\u2019t say I don\u2019t need this\nmaybe. I feel I would like it but I can\u2019t do it. Like I see it\u2019s when they get together with other\npeople, they don\u2019t have the same kind of faith. They -- there\u2019s a rapport through religion that I\ndon\u2019t have. And the prayers and \u2014",
        "Q: Are you a member of a synagogue?",
        "A: No, we tried several things. In fact two weekends ago we went to an open house from the\nKehila Chadasha. We went to go on their retreat. But we had been members when -- before we\nhad our son. And it was very child oriented it seemed to us. So we thought we didn\u2019t feel it was\nour place, but we went to this one meeting and it was quite amazing to us. The besides the bagel\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nnosh and all that, they had a discussion led by a reporter for the Washington Post who reports on\nthe national news. He talked about the elections. There was another reporter from -- the who\nworks for the Los Angeles Times that was there. And but among the audience, everybody who\ncommented, they were so brilliant. And it was an amazing intellectual feat going on and so in\nfact I felt, I didn\u2019t feel up to par. But so we\u2019re going to try that.",
        "Q: Good. And do you think more about the war years as you get older?",
        "A: Well there\u2019s more time to think about it.",
        "Q: Now that you\u2019re retired.",
        "A: Yes. And especially being in the environment with the -- role with the museum. So there are\nall these other activities and movies and so on. And my wife doesn\u2019t mind. She likes so it\u2019s a\ngood thing cause she didn\u2019t go through that. But it would be more difficult if she couldn\u2019t relate\nto it and didn\u2019t want to participate. She doesn\u2019t participate in the child survivors group. One\nthing when we started, we didn\u2019t allow non survivors, even spouses. Some people were very\nadamant about that. But that\u2019s all changed but my wife feels -- she\u2019s much younger than me.\nShe\u2019s young and it\u2019s not her thing.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through what you did, being hidden and away from your\nfamily and the losses your family suffered? Are you angry that other people Jewish children let\u2019s\nsay or other children your age didn\u2019t have to go through it?",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: It\u2019s more of an acceptance or \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: Other children who didn\u2019t have that experience don\u2019t have such happy childhoods. In fact my\nwife\u2019s background, I mean the family was poor. They had five children and her childhood wasn\u2019t\nthat happy.",
        "Q: It was difficult. Well is there anything else you wanted to add, any thoughts you had?",
        "A: Well one thing that I\u2019ve been thinking about at the museum, maybe elsewhere too. There 1s a\nlot of emphasis on seems to me, on the bystander as being guilty for not doing something. Well\nto me that\u2019s, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Just because there are injustices going around, it doesn\u2019t\nmean that you can specially being in an occupied country or in Germany, doesn\u2019t mean that you\ncan just go out there and do something. I mean you can do something, get hit over the head and\nthat\u2019s the end. A lot of the, ?ve become aware that a lot of the people were involved was due to\ncircumstances. If (inaudible) And somebody came, knocked at the door and asked if they\nwould take a child, didn\u2019t say Jewish child. She suspected it she said. Others, that woman who,\nJeanne. Mademoiselle Jeanne, she was a school teacher. She was 20 years old, a school teacher\nand someone said kids were disappearing, Jewish kids. So she had this connection. She was then\ndetermined helping other kids. And I\u2019m now watchful. I\u2019m on the lookout and I see that\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s happening. With the priest in Belgium. There was also an aspect that he was asked or, so\nI see it\u2019s not that easy to just decide well this is not fair. Then I\u2019m going to go out and\ndemonstrate or something. You can do that here under certain circumstances which 1s perfect as\nlong as you\u2019ve got your permit or whatever. You can have a demonstration.\nBut under the conditions that, in Germany and later in the occupied countries, I admire the white\nrose movement. Its but they gave their lives for nothing. Same with a lot of \u2014 another thing that\ngets to me 1s the myth about the Jews not resisting. There was of course some armed resistance.\nBut it was futile. What does that mean. Countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway,\nDenmark, Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Holland. Almost Russia were invaded and almost they\nwere defeated, not Russia -- almost. What does it mean to resist? Well there was resistance but it\ndid take all kind of form. Every time you didn\u2019t do what they wanted you to do. Every time you\ndidn\u2019t report to the work, when you were chosen or you didn\u2019t go to the place where you were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nsupposed to go so they can deport you. Or when you were supposed register. Hiding children.\nAll these things were resistance. And so it, I\u2019ve been, that\u2019s bothered me for a long time.",
        "Q: There\u2019s all kinds of resistance.",
        "A: There\u2019s all kinds of resistance and the armed resistance was I think well, it\u2019s wonderful that\npeople did decide, ok we\u2019re going to resist with weapons and but in general I guess you could\nsay that it was futile. And they didn\u2019t survive. Many times hostages were killed.",
        "Q: Have you been to Germany\u201d?",
        "A: For very brief periods, visits. When I was living in Paris, when I had an aunt who had been in\nTangier. She\u2019s actually not Jewish. I didn\u2019t even know that. When my uncle died in Tangier, she\nand their two daughters move to Frankfurt, where she\u2019s from I guess. And while I was in Paris I\nvisited you know for two weekends. And another time with Arlene, when we were coming, when\nwe're living in France we did a lot of traveling back and forth. She\u2019d come here for a summer\nand so one time there was some I don\u2019t know if it was a controller\u2019s strike or whatever. I don\u2019t\nremember what it was. I think it had something to do with controllers, so we couldn\u2019t get a\nflight, a commercial flight back here. But my brother who was in the tourist business arranged\nfor us to get on a, I think it was a charter flight or something from Salzburg in Germany. So we\nwent there you know to spend the night and so I felt \u2014",
        "Q: Are you comfortable in Germany?",
        "A: ?\u2019m not comfortable wherever I can\u2019t speak the language and my German is limited in\nvocabulary. It\u2019s also limited by the fact that I only spoke it with my parents or relatives. So I\ndon\u2019t really know how to talk to people. When I was in college there was a Swiss, it was from\nan Italian area. So his German was \u2014",
        "Q: So it was more the lack of a language rather than the feeling of what Germany represented?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: It was both. I still thought you know when I saw older people, what did they do. But you\nknow I, at least intellectually I think, didn\u2019t do anything more than people do in other countries\nin that kind of situation.",

        "Q: You didn\u2019t get anything but your parents did?",
        "A: Yeah my father had a pension. They got, they lost the apartment in Berlin. We left illegally\nacross the border illegal. My we left, my father believed that this wasn\u2019t going to, Hitler wasn\u2019t\ngoing to last. Like a lot of other people were not informed. Well I think a lot of professionals\nlost their jobs so they left. But my father had this business. And it was getting better as its\ncompetition was leaving because he held on. Some things we\u2019re doing well. So he didn\u2019t want to\nleave but then his friend \u2014 I\u2019m not sure it was a friend \u2014 it was they used to have a German maid\nuntil 35. And her boyfriend was a policeman. He came to see my father in 38. He said Max you\nhave to leave and something\u2019s going to be terrible. And I think he had knowledge about the\nKristallnacht plans. So my father took my brother and sister and they were caught at the border\nby the Dutch there. And they were put in prison but he got out and then see my brother and\nsister disagreed on whether we left before or after Kristallnacht. And I think it was both. They\nleft before but they were caught and sent back and \u2014",

        "A: Almost.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: And there was a, on the road next to me there was a, well there was a British soldier, part of\nthe British Expeditionary Forces that were stationed in France and Belgium before the war\nstarted and the officer was looking up in the sky with binoculars. Then I fell asleep. When I\nwoke up he was gone and I asked my mother where was is this soldier. And she told me that the\nsoldiers were gone. And she seemed to be afraid at this point. Later I learned that the British\nsoldiers were evacuated from Dunkirk, which was just over the border of Belgium and France.",
        "A: Yes, I remember because by this time I was very attached to the Von der Lindens, specially\nMrs. Von der Linden and she was very attached to me, like a son. And my mother showed up.\nShe came and visited me occasionally. But this time she came and she wanted to bring me to my\nparents\u2019 hiding place which was an apartment that looked like it was in a vacant building. And I\ndidn\u2019t know why she wanted to come and pick me up. I know, I was a little upset and Mrs. Von\nder Linden, also. But my mother said that she, I could come back after the liberation. So I went\nwith my mother. We took the street car. And at some point, at a stop, there was a German truck\ncame by. It was being pulled by a horse. Apparently it had run out of gas. And there was also a\nsoldier lying on top of the truck with a heavy machine gun. They looked very insecure. They\nkept looking around and like expecting some, maybe to be shot at which is, was the case. But I\ndidn\u2019t know that.\nMy mother said, going to that scene, she said, always remember this. Don\u2019t forget.",
        "A: Right. I have not forgotten it. So then we went, I thought we were going to the apartment\nwhere my parents were hidden, but in fact we went around the corner where there was a beauty\nparlor. And I didn\u2019t know this before but one day my mother had been walking on the street\naround the corner and some German soldiers came in the opposite direction on the same\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nsidewalk so she got a little panicky and she went into the beauty parlor. And once she was inside,\nshe was just standing there and the woman who ran this beauty parlor told her come in the back.\nThere were, in many stores there was a living area, behind the store. And above the store. And\nmy mother hesitated to go in the back. She was afraid. So the woman said that her husband was\nJewish which was the case. And so they became friends and their backyards were connected\ncause they were at right angles to each other and there was a wall separating them but they made\narrangements to go over the wall in case some danger would happen to one or the other.\nIn several cases, my parents went over the wall. I don\u2019t remember these peoples\u2019 names, went\nover the wall. One time I know it\u2019s because the Germans came to pick up the Jewish family\nliving in the house next door.\nSo they didn\u2019t know that it was, 1t wasn\u2019t for them, so they went over the wall. And as it was\ngetting close to liberation, my parents moved in with this couple and that\u2019s where my mother\ntook me also. By this time, or maybe a day or two later you could hear the cannon fire in the\ndistance. And so we knew that liberation was very, very soon to come. I remember once I was\nstanding in the entrance of the beauty parlor and I saw, on the corner, I saw a group of men\nwearing khaki, but they weren\u2019t soldiers. I didn\u2019t know who they were and they were carrying\ncases, looked like wooden cases and they opened them up and they were distributing rifles to\nother men that came along.\nSo I went back in the beauty parlor and I asked what\u2019s going on? Who are these people? And\nthey were actually Belgians who were getting ready to join the fight against the Germans. Then\nagain shortly after that, I don\u2019t know how many days went by, I think it was maybe one day or\nso. One morning my mother took me. She said we\u2019re going to go to, it was a park. I didn\u2019t know\nexactly why we were going there. And she said the English are there. I\u2019m not sure what she said\nactually but she said the English. She probably did but I\u2019m not sure. I didn\u2019t know what that\nmeant. And so we started going and I asked my mother, why isn\u2019t my father coming. And she\ntried to explain that he hadn\u2019t been outside, except to go to the beauty parlor for two years and he\nwas not ready to face people. So we were walking along. My mother was kind of in a hurry and\nwe were on one street. And we passed a tent that was burned. And I was fascinated. I don\u2019t know\nif it was, I assume it was a German tent, now looking back at it and probably a Molotov cocktail\nhad been thrown at it. It was burning on top. And I didn\u2019t seen any soldiers, just fire. So I\nstopped to look. My mother said let\u2019s go and grabbed me, my hand and continued with a lot of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nother people. Everybody was rushing to this park. And when we arrived there, there were tanks\nlined up in all the lanes. It was all very strange. There were a lot of, a lot of civilians around the\ntanks and everybody was happy and cheering and my mother took me towards a tank. There was\na soldier standing on it. And we looked at each other. We looked at the soldier, he looked at us.\nAnd then he put out his arms, downwards and my mother lifted me up and he grabbed me and \u2014\n(crying) \u2014 he pulled me up. And he held me in his arms. I looked at my mother and she said,\ngive him a kiss cause we didn\u2019t have any way of communicating with him. So I did and then I\nlooked back down and she was crying. So I couldn\u2019t understand. That was all, this job that my\nmother was crying and she said it\u2019s all right and I remember the soldier kept smiling as if it was\nok.\nAfter that, I don\u2019t remember all the details but my mother took me back to the Von der Lindens\nlike she had promised to do. But there was another reason. My brother and sister were by then\nthey were living in the Ardennes. And my parents wanted to pick them up which wasn\u2019t easy\nbecause we had to go there by train or municipal trams maybe. But they weren\u2019t running. So and\nthere was no communication so anyway I went back to the Von der Lindens and I didn\u2019t really\nknow how long I stayed there. I only figured out a few years ago when I went back to the Von\nder Lindens. Every house on the street had a huge flag of the allies, American, British, French,\nBelgian. There wasn\u2019t a red flag. And these flags, I know how people made them. They were the\nsize of double sheets hanging down in front of the houses.\nAnd then one day I went outside to play, as I usually did, but I quickly noticed that there were no\nflags on the houses. So I went in and asked Mrs. Von der Linden. She ran a store, sort of a\nhardware store. And she said that the Germans might be coming back and she seemed very\nanxious cause I didn\u2019t know this at the time. It was many years later that I figure out this was the\nBattle of the Bulge.\nSo this is the way I know that I spent much more time with the Von der Lindens after the\nliberation than I originally thought because the Battle of the Bulge was in December. The\nliberation was in September. And so I was still with the Von der Lindens at the time of the\nBattle of the Bulge, several months after the liberation.\nThen after probably a short time after that, \u2019m not sure. My parents had found, rented a house\nand the apartment where they lived was much too small for our family. And so they rented a\nhouse, a nice little house and my brother and sister and I were there, but also my cousin Lottie.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nHer father was my mother\u2019s brother. And her parents had been deported on the last transport\nfrom Belgium. Number, it was transport number 26. They also had a son who had the same\nname as my brother Manfred, or Mani. They were together. At some point they were hidden\ntogether by a priest who was well known for having saved a lot of, hundreds of Jewish children.\nFather Joseph Andre who has been recognized by Yad Vashem and many other organizations.\nHe placed the kids in convents or orphanages or in private families. But until he found the\nplaces they stayed with him. And both my cousin and my brother were with him when the\nGermans started watching him, suspecting that he was also involved in the underground. So he\nhad to go into hiding himself, the priest. And my brother went to live with a family that was not\nreally -- were friends of the family my sister was staying with in the Ardennes. But my cousin\ndidn\u2019t have any place to go and so he went back to his parents\u2019 apartment and they were\ndenounced. They were seen during an air raid, probably going to the shelter and they were\ndeported. My aunt is the only one that came back. But they had a daughter, Lottie, who was\nhidden someplace else. So my parents took in Lottie and she was living with us. We still didn\u2019t\nknow the fate of my mother\u2019s brother and his wife.\nOne day his wife came to the house. I happened to be there alone one afternoon. The doorbell\nrang and I opened the door and there was this strange woman. Somebody I didn\u2019t know and she\nalso looked strange a little bit. And she didn\u2019t say anything for a long time and I didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do. I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to let in strangers in the house and she didn\u2019t say anything\nand finally she, she said I\u2019m your aunt, Tante Dutche and I didn\u2019t recognize her. First two years\nhad gone by since we had gone into hiding. But also she had been in Auschwitz during that time\nand on a death march. And so when she told me her name I let her in and my parents came home.\nThat evening, after dinner, my aunt kind of spilled her guts, told the whole story from the\nbeginning to the end and they were all very, very quiet listening to her. And also at some point\nshe pulled up her sleeve and we all kind of looked or leaned over to see what was on her arm. It\nwas her number tattooed on her arm. (pause)\nI had started going back to school. I, actually I was going to school already when I was living\nwith the Von der Lindens. At first when they were living out in the country, it was a Flemish\narea. And the school was a Catholic school. There was Flemish which I didn\u2019t know. So that\ndidn\u2019t help me very much. Then later when they moved into the city, I went to a French speaking\nschool. But there were some gaps there. So when I moved in with my parents again I started\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nschool but I was a year behind. And later I caught up. It was a very small neighborhood school\nand the fourth, fifth and sixth grade were in the same room. So I could hear and see what this, the\nclass ahead of me was doing so by the end of the fifth year of school the teacher said I could go\non to the seventh grade which was a, in like what do you call it here, junior high school. So I\ncaught up there.\nIn 49, my brother got his visa to come to the States. Since my brother and sister and I were born\nin Germany, but our parents were born in Poland, we the kids got visas earlier because the quota\nwas shorter for Germans than it was for Poles. So my brother got his visa first. My parents were\nnot that interested in moving to the States. They got established again in Belgium. They were\nhappy there. But my brother wanted to go to the States. And shortly after that, that was in 1949.\nShortly after that my sister got her visa and she joined him. They went to Seattle, Washington.\nAnd then in 1951 my parents got their visas. They had, I guess I could have gone to the States\nbefore but I was only 11 when my brother left so they didn\u2019t want me to go without them. We\ncame to the States and arrived in New York, on the Queen Mary. And then \u2014",

And his\nother brother went to Tangier with his family, his wife. And there was another sister who was\nalso living in Paris with her husband and children. Her daughter is the same age as Iam. And\nafter the war started, they were able to get out of France, go to Spain. And I guess maybe\nPortugal and then they caught the ship. They didn\u2019t have visas for any country but when they got\nto Venezuela they were allowed to get off the ship so they are the ones who survived. My father\nhad three, two or three other sisters and his parents, they perished. They didn\u2019t survive. They\nwere in Poland.\nOn my mother\u2019s side there were 11 children, so ten siblings. Father had died before the war of\nnatural causes. This, her grandmother and all her siblings they were still in Poland and of those,\nno I shouldn\u2019t say they were all in Poland. One aunt and husband they were in Hungary and then\nfrom Hungary they got to England. He was a cantor and so he got a job in, not in England, in\nIreland. First. And so they were saved. Her, my mother\u2019s youngest brother, he and his wife went\neast when Germany invaded the Russian part of Poland. They went that way. And they were,\nended up in Siberia. And then later after Germany attacked Russia, the conditions got better and\nthere were many other Polish Jews were allowed to join in a Polish division in the Russian army.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nAnd they were sent to Iran, Persia for the oil fields, but on the way they deserted and went to\nPalestine, along with many others.

I was this little\nBelgian boy, son of Adele and Adolf Von der Linden and I had an older sister named Florence.\nThey were, they were not religious at all and so that was not an issue at all.",
        "A: Well you know I never asked but in, when I went to live in France to work actually in 1976, I\nwent to see them and my then girlfriend, American girlfriend who is now my wife, came to visit\nme and we went to Brussels to see the Von der Lindens. By this time, I think her husband had\ndied already. And Arlene, my wife, asked why she took us in. Or my sister and I and that was\nthe first time, I don\u2019t know why it never occurred to me to ask. What she said was that somebody\nknocked at the door and asked if she would be aware, if she would be willing to take in a child.\nShe didn\u2019t say Jewish. She wasn\u2019t told it was a Jewish child and it wasn\u2019t us, 1t wasn\u2019t my sister\nand I. It was a young teenage girl and she stayed with them for a while and then their, they\nbecame concerned because she had a boyfriend and they were not very careful. They wrote to\neach other and then really all the, a lot of things which probably would have endangered them all\nif somebody had looked into it. There was censorship of mail. So they asked the organization to\ntake the girl back. And so my sister and I were traded.",

        "A: We never, no. It\u2019s amazing. I, where we lived was not a Jewish neighborhood and the\nneighborhood I know Jewish friends. But then when I went to junior high there was a Jewish boy\nand it happened that his parents and my parents were friends. But it was like when the war, no\nwhen we were liberated and we all got together again as a family, I remember very distinctly my\nsister saying nothing happened to us. We were not caught and we didn\u2019t starve. So whatever we\nwent through was the same as everybody else, except we were Jewish. There were some more\ncomplications. But we never, even though the word survivor didn\u2019t exist, wasn\u2019t used like it is\nnow. But you would consider people who were in concentration camps to be, to have survived\nsomething. We didn\u2019t survive anything. We just, nothing. So we never talked about it. They\nnever inquired about us. I guess after a while my mother learned that all her siblings and\ngrandmother, sorry and her mother were dead and same with my father.\nI don\u2019t remember them every talking about it or -- With me. Or showing anything. I was a little\nsurprised maybe. How come I don\u2019t know when I started feeling it. It was strange that they never\ntalked about or showed emotions about it. But they didn\u2019t cry.",
        "A: Well yes, as a child. As I said we were liberated by British but then soon American troops\ncame.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. My brother knew some English and he liked to practice it and so he would hang\naround the soldiers and when he met Jewish soldiers, he invite them home for dinner. I didn\u2019t, I\nonly learned this maybe a year ago so. I thought it was my father who would invite them but it\nwas my brother and so we had a lot of soldiers. And also my mother had a cousin who was in the\nJewish brigade. He would come to our house with a British truck and give me rides. I remember\nthe there was a round sunroof and I\u2019d stand up on the seat. I didn\u2019t know then of course that he\nwas using, the truck was used for bringing the refugees to I think Italy from where the departed\nfor Palestine.\nAnd then you know before the war ended, an American came into our lives. It was my cousin in\nIreland had married an American officer, a dentist. Her brother was a dentist too. They met in the\nsame way. Her father had invited this young American officer who sort of was a rabbi, for\ndinner. And they got married. So and then he was sent to Belgium. He worked in the field\nhospital in Lieges which is quite close to Brussels. Belgium is very small. And he started\ncoming to our house every weekend. Whenever he was off. And he was able to do everything.\nFix things, things that my father would never be able to do. And so I was always happy to be\naround him.\nOne thing. He used to be a great story teller but he also had a very loud voice. So with my, we\nspoke German because we didn\u2019t know English and he knew, he had learned German in school.\nAnd, at least he learned in school. I don\u2019t know where else. He spoke it quite well and sometimes\nwe'd go out in public like to a restaurant or caf\u00e9 and he would talk but it was always in this\nbooming voice in German. I didn\u2019t know where to hide. I\u2019d keep my distance because\neverybody would start staring.",

        "A: Well.",
        "A: Yeah, pre teenager, I\u2019d say 12, 13 when I became. So I don\u2019t know. My brother was already\nhere and also I guess, I know that with my friends we had arguments who were like for example\nwho was the best soldier. First of all there were, Germans were the best soldiers. Then the\nBritish were the . I mean that was my friend\u2019s argument. And then came the American soldiers,\nbut like one of my friends said, his friend was communist. General Motors won the war. I had\nno idea what General Motors was. Who was General Motors? And since then I have, in a way\nthat\u2019s been confirmed. I mean the fact that the United States had such an output of material that\nthey were able to build, to continue on. The Germans couldn\u2019t produce. So anyway I was, liked\nthe Americans better than the others and so I was prepared to come here. I was happy to come\nhere. I liked American things.",
        "A: Well my friends probably did too. But there was a \u2014",
        "A: I knew a little. I start in the eighth grade. We started learning English in school. The teacher\nhad a British accent. And for me the last six months or after my parents got the visa, there was a\nperiod of time before we came. During that period they hired a tutor and but in reality I knew\nvery little. I remember we arrived in London. We went to visit my uncle and aunt who lived in\nLondon. And we crossed on the ship and then we took the train and we were at the train station\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nand we didn\u2019t know where we were, where to go. So this man came up to us and asked if he\ncould help. And like I think I was saying, I was saying was no thank you. In fact we could have\nused help.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, my parents had money and we traveled second class unfortunately for me. I mean they\nalways used to when we traveled. Every summer we went to the coast of Belgium and stayed in\nnice hotels and all, so my parents were well off but then rather, not wealthy, but well off. And\nso it didn\u2019t, I\u2019d say they felt it didn\u2019t suit them to go third class, tourist class. So we went second\nclass on the Queen Mary. It\u2019s the front of the ship 1s first class and the third, the back of the ship\nis the tourist class. And second class 1s the whole length of this huge ship. But there were very,\nvery few passengers in second class. If you can afford it you go first class. And there were no\nchildren. I was all by myself. I did meet a reporter for the Saturday Evening Post cause he didn\u2019t\nspeak French and I didn\u2019t speak English. And he, I don\u2019t know if it was his girlfriend or what.\nThere was a Chinese woman and by coincidence his sister lived, had lived for some time on the\nsame street where I lived in Brussels.

        "A: Yes, because this maybe embarrassing. I didn\u2019t know much I guess, I didn\u2019t know about the\nStatue of Liberty or I didn\u2019t know it was such a big deal. So one morning, the reporter, came,\nknocked on our cabin and said we\u2019re going to go by the Statue of Liberty. We\u2019re arriving. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nfirst I didn\u2019t know what it was I was going to see. But I went with him.

I remember the first morning, or very early in the morning,\nthe garbage trucks picking up garbage cans and the smell in the subway was all very unpleasant.\nAnd of course, not knowing any English didn\u2019t help.",

And\nmaybe, the case, I didn\u2019t like having to learn to read Hebrew and prepare for the bar mitzvah. It\nwas all quite strange to me. Because didn\u2019t live in a milieu that --. So it was a relatively small\nbar mitzvah. I, my parents invited \u2014 we had friends. We did have relatives there. We had cousins.\nThen we lived in, they\u2019re still in Los Angeles, but he has Alzheimer\u2019s now.

But my parents came with enough money that they\ndecided the draft board decided that they didn\u2019t need to be supported by my brother. So he was\ndrafted and went to basic training and then he was, he got ready to go to Korea. And this really\nhas changed with my father\u2019s hair I think turned white overnight. I\u2019ve heard that it happens that\n-- so then we decided, my parents decided to stay in Seattle because my brother had a business\nthere. It was food vending machines. But it\u2019s now started was the cousin, the American cousin\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nMatthew. His brother had a business, a vending machine business in Tacoma, Washington. And\nthey want to expand to Seattle. So my brother, you know partnered, with my father\u2019s money.",
        "A: I started school which is strange because as I said we arrived in March. So maybe we arrived\nin Seattle at the beginning of April and we were staying. My brother and sister had an apartment.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t matter. Pardon me. After being there for a while the neighbors told my sister and\nmy brother I should go to school. So my brother inquired where the nearest school was. And it\nwas a high school. And I was still in the eighth grade. And this high school it started in ninth\ngrade. I went to talk, my brother took me to talk to the principal and he asked, the principal asked\nme what I had studied. And my brother translated. And since I had studied many things that\nthey weren\u2019t doing in eighth grade in America, like studying math and algebra, geometry. The\nprincipal very wisely said well you can stay here. Normally we would have had to send you to a\njunior high school but he said you can stay here. The year is almost finished and it really is a\ntime to learn English.

Otis, Mr. Otis.\nHe said in Belgium they teach writing very well. I didn\u2019t know how he knew. So he said, no\nthat shouldn\u2019t be a problem and he said well why don\u2019t you go see a counselor. At the counseling\ncenter. So I did and for some reason there were two people, two, I think they were psychologists\nand they were sitting across from me and one of them said well tell us about yourself, your\nbackground. And that was the first time I started talking about myself and I started crying.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, they were sympathetic. They said that I needed counseling that it would be long\nterm and they only offered short term there. So that they recommended I see a psychiatrist. So I\ntold my parents and said, why should you see a psychiatrist. You\u2019re not crazy. So I didn\u2019t go to a\npsychiatrist. Until many years later. I was in my late 20s and I was \u2014 a friend of mine said he\nwas seeing somebody and said he was very good. He was Jewish and he was very good. I didn\u2019t\nknow exactly what that meant but I kind of felt, maybe I could see him. So I called his office and\nhe told me he\u2019s all booked up. He couldn\u2019t see me. He wasn\u2019t taking any new patients. But\nthere was somebody in this same suite of offices who might. And so I made an appointment with\nthis other psychiatrist who was traditional. He was Freudian.",
        "A: He never said anything. He just, felt like he had me talk and he wrote notes. Except one time\nhe reacted. I don\u2019t remember what I told him but something like I\u2019m lucky and I don\u2019t know\nwhat I was referring to. Maybe I met a girl or something. And all of a sudden he blew up. He\nsaid you\u2019re lucky, you think you\u2019re lucky. You think you\u2019re special don\u2019t you? And I couldn\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nrespond. I mean and \u2014 he didn\u2019t know anything about me. Because he had never asked and I\nnever talked about my past and you can look at my early childhood. You know I was lucky. I had\nlet\u2019s see in Belgium I had a 50, 50 chance of surviving. Maybe less because I was a child. Let\u2019s\nsee if I had been caught, it would have been less. So definitely I would say yes, I was lucky. But\nfor some reason he reacted in this way. Shortly after that, I quit. When he raised his rate, I took\nthe opportunity of quitting. And this happened again. When I, did I say I lived in Vancouver.",

So she when her\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nmother was 16, she, her mother died and -- when she was 16 her mother died. So then her aunts\nwere pushing her to get married. And so she, to escape, she and her younger brother came to\nIsrael. She was 18. He was 17. And I met them. They were at the kibbutz. And so we started a\nrelationship and after I had been in Israel a year, I had applied to go to graduate school at the\nUniversity of Washington and so I was accepted and since -- the girl\u2019s name was Tilda. She\ncouldn\u2019t come without being married or \u2014 and because we wanted to, we got married. She was\n18. Iwas 24. And we went back to England. To see obviously she had never been there. She\ndidn\u2019t speak English. She spoke five languages. We spoke French to each other. Cause that\u2019s a\nminority language in Turkey. She had gone to French schools also.\nSo we were married three years and then she was not happy, not, 1t was a difficult adjustment for\nher. Meanwhile her father and her other brother. Oh, actually she had two brothers. Two\nbrothers came to the States and they went to live in Los Angeles and she, then she went to Los\nAngeles after we were married three years.\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nVolunteer collection interview with Harry Markowicz. This is track number two and we were\ntalking, that you were back in Seattle, going to graduate school. And how long were you, for\nhow long were you in graduate school?\nHarry Markowicz: For over two years. I was working on my masters which I didn\u2019t get. I got\ninto a program that they -- the university had set up between linguistics, psychology and French,\nliterature, not French literature. And so it involved almost three departments and there were a lot\nof infighting between the faculty. So many of us didn\u2019t get our degrees because each one tried to\nget very high level of requirements for their field. And I was teaching French. Then for some\nreason two people in the same week told me about this new university in I forgot the \u2014 After that,\nsorry, after that I got a job in a community college in Tacoma, Washington. It was called\nTacoma Community College. I taught French there for two years. Then these two friends told\nme about this new university called Simon Frazer University in British Columbia near\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nVancouver and for some reason, both said this separately you'll fit in there. So I didn\u2019t know\nexactly what they meant but I called the chairman of the foreign language department, or maybe\nI\u2019m sorry linguistics. It was a combination. And I told him I was interested and he said ok come\non up. This was 67. And we can talk. So after a few minutes he offered me a position as an\ninstructor. I didn\u2019t have a transcript or anything. And then he introduced me to some of the\npeople in the department and the French woman and she told me she was a graduate associate. I\nknew what a graduate assistant was because I had been one but it\u2019s a little higher level and more\npaid. So I went back to the chairman of the department and said what is this graduate associate\nthing. Can I do it? Cause I don\u2019t have a PhD and I'd like to work on it. He said oh sure, you can\ndo that too. And so I, and they paid very well too. So I became a graduate associate and taught\nFrench and I got my MA degree there.\nMeanwhile, while I was there, I got interested in sign language, completely by chance. I\u2019ll make\nit very brief. I had in mind a research project involving linguistic universals which had become\npopularized or not only got popular but they were introduced by Chomsky, Noam Chomsky.\nAnd but it involved doing a little experiment with artificial languages to discover whether one\ncould learn a language more easily if it had universals. But everybody already knows a language\nso that the experiment was not feasible until one day I read in a book called the Biological\nFoundations of Language that deaf children, before they go to school don\u2019t know any language.\nSo I decided ah ha, that\u2019s my, those are going to be my subject. Just about this time there was a\nletter published in the Vancouver newspaper in response to an article which I had not seen. But\nthe writer wrote that so and so, a deaf man has a little deaf girl, he and his wife are deaf. And\nhave a deaf girl who was two years old and she has a vocabulary of, maybe she was two and a\nhalf, of several hundred signs which she combines in two word sentences. Two sign sentences.\nThis was exciting because that\u2019s what hearing children in whatever language they learn. So I\ncontacted the writer of the letter. He was a director of social welfare agency.\nAnd we talked and I also met a deaf man there. He introduced me to this deaf man he was\nwriting about who I don\u2019t remember how we talked, having a long conversation. And it became\nclear to me that if you\u2019re deaf and you grow up in a deaf environment, namely deaf residential\nschools, that it\u2019s very similar to being Jewish.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: Because you are in a minority and you\u2019re part of a larger society but you\u2019re always a\nminority. And the kind of relationships that develop among deaf people are the same kind of\nrelationships you have among Jewish people. For example, a deaf American and a deaf Japanese\nmay have more in common than a deaf American and a hearing American in some ways. There\u2019s\na language aspect. There\u2019s a whole lot of, though later in my life I started writing about the\ncommunity, the deaf community as an ethnic group. Anyway this became very fascinating for\nme. I got hooked. So I started reading books related to deafness and either the books didn\u2019t\nmention sign language or else they denigrated it by saying it\u2019s not a real language because it\ndoesn\u2019t have articles. And it doesn\u2019t have a passive voice which is pure nonsense. There are\nplenty of languages that don\u2019t have articles or a passive voice, not a requirement for that to be a\nlanguage.\nSo that immediately got a rise out of me and the director of this institute for the deaf told me\nabout a professor at Gallaudet University, William Stokoe who had worked on sign language.\nAnd suggested I contact him. So I did. And immediately Stokoe sent me back books, several\nbooks that he had written on sign language. So I, with my masters papers on sign language. This\nwas in 1969, 70 at a time when sign language was not really accepted in America.\nSo I -- it was a cause. It was not my cause. I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t fight for my cause, whatever\nthat would be but I found that I wanted to take part in this fight for recognition of sign language\nand I could see eventually that it has to do with deaf civil rights. So that\u2019s what I did, get\ninvolved in. Eventually in what year was that. In 72 I came to Washington to go to Georgetown\nto work on my PhD at the suggestion of Bill Stokoe. And so I studied at Georgetown and then I\nstarted working at Gallaudet in William Stokoe\u2019s linguistic research lab where he did research on\nsign language. And it was funded by various grants, National Science Foundation and so on.\nWhen the money started running out, I was no longer working there. I worked there three years.\nAnd I had gone to Paris during the summer of 75 with several colleagues from Gallaudet. One in\nparticular had a grant from maybe it was National Science, no it was National Endowment for\nthe Humanities, a grant to study the historical foundation of American Sign Language, but its\norigins are from French sign language.\nSo I was the French expert. My task was to go into the library at the school for the Humane\nschool for the deaf in Paris and do research there on what was available on French sign language.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nThere I met a sociologist who had some interest in deafness. And then he knew the history of,\nthis history of deafness, the controversy. But he felt that all, he had been led to believe that with\nthe new kind of hearing aids that were developed that that was not the problem anymore. And so\nwe got involved and he invited me to stay with him and I told him what I knew that. So he, next,\nthe next summer there was the world congress of the deaf took place in Washington. It takes\nplace every four years. He came here and then stayed afterwards with me and saw what we were\ndoing in the linguistic research lab. And then he asked me if I would like to go back to France,\nwork with him, to get French sign language recognized in France. So I took a year. He got a\ngrant there. And went to Paris. That was 76. Fall of 76. And the year stretched to five years.\nAnd in the meantime, after the first year I got married to my current wife Arlene who I knew\nalready from Washington.",

It was Flora Singer who got us\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\ntogether. First time was seven and we\u2019ve been meeting ever since, once a month.

I went\nand it was obviously not for me.",
        "A: No, no not, this is not the, this is the adults. This is the people who went through camps\nmostly and who were older than me, 20 years older. And maybe not that much but there is a huge\ndifference. And to them, nothing happened to us because we were just kids. We don\u2019t even\nremember and, and so, once we invited one of their members to come to one of our meetings.\nWe tried to get closer to them. This is a long time ago. Probably 20 years ago. And at some\npoint this man said exactly those words. But what do you know? You don\u2019t remember anything.\nYou were kids. So I got back to Florence and I you know, I don\u2019t fit in there. She said yeah I\nknow. There are several people who feel the same. Flora was sort of in between in ages. And she\nspoke Yiddish fluently. So she said well you know I\u2019|l get you together, just hold on. So she did.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nShe got us together. And we met and decided to meet again.

        "A: No, we had interpreters for that. I mean there was a reason. Yeah but also instead of just\nhaving it as a class, I, we had this in an auditorium. It was open to everybody. And somebody\nfrom the Museum suggested to have a general who was one of the liberators. I\u2019ve forgotten now\nhis name also. But he was well known and he was Jewish. So I had him come. So and I\nselected people from my group who represented the whole scale of things from people who were\nin camps. The majority in our group were not in camps. But sharing their experiences, unique\nand everybody, there was somebody who came in a group of almost a thousand who were\nbrought to the state, 44 and they were sent to Oswego and put in a camp. So there was a, and\nkindertransport and so on.\nSo I knew I was going to do it but after I retired. I don\u2019t know why it took me a year. I would\nask who do I contact and oh, Pll let you know next time. And then it wasn\u2019t just their fault. It\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nwas mine.

So one day in\nclass he started talking about \u2014 he told me later and I realized who it was he was talking about\nEichmann and the deal that he was trying to work out with Cant. The guy\u2019s name is Cantor I\nthink, the Jewish --.",

How do we know you're going to release, whatever one million Jews or whatever it was\ngoing to be. And Eichmann said you have the word of a German officer. So I started going to\nthe library at the University of Washington and you know at that time, that was 57, it was very\nearly. The French professor had used the word let\u2019s see, in English, no in French it\u2019s litterateur\nconcentrasonaire, the literature of concentration camps. In France it apparently existed already\nexisted already. But not here. So anyway, I went to the library and got books. I remember one\nspecifically Bergen Bel was the title and it was all about Bergen Belsen. It was each chapter was\nwritten by a different person. Like an Englishman, soldier, an inmate from the camp.

        "A: Whatever I get recognition for I don\u2019t deserve. Or people take me for more intelligent than I\nam. That what I do knowing people, sometimes I get praised for my writing and I think well \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t associate it with my experience, but this woman in her article that\u2019s\nwhat she wrote about.",
        "A: I think you\u2019re right.",
        "A: Well I think your comment is also very interesting because sometimes I think about it. I\nmean it\u2019s comes to me as leading two lives, specially when you\u2019re so little.",
        "A: Today I think what happened in Germany could happen anywhere. I mean Germany was one\nof the most advanced countries, educational. The culture and in every field they were tops you\nknow, among the tops. And it happened. The conditions made it possible to happen. I could see it\nhappen here.",
        "A: I mean not there but I can even can see it here or anywhere.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: In today\u2019s world yes.",
        "A: The conditions get, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how to link that up. I mean there are many people who have not had my kind of\nexperience but feel the same way politically.",
        "A: Maybe more attuned but I didn\u2019t, I\u2019m reticent to actually take part in \u2014 I was in British\nColumbia for five years, when \u2014 during 68 and so on. So there was also the movement but I was\nafraid I was going to be evicted, reported at Simon Frazer University. Students took over the\nuniversity. And lots of the people I knew were like in the building.",
        "A: Well they were in the building and the mounted police arrived. And I was outside but I didn\u2019t\ngo in the building. I was afraid what the consequences would be \u2014 but also I\u2019m very dished, but I\nnever told people I was Jewish either. I think the first time was I mean some people saw me. In\nthe high school I went to in Seattle it was in a formerly Jewish neighborhood. There were still a\nlot of Jewish kids, 50 percent or more you know. So there it was not an issue. But later on, as\nstudent at University of Washington, I remember being in a restaurant having a place with my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nfriends, several friends. I don\u2019t know why I said I was Jewish and they said you\u2019re Jewish. They\nwere like it was a surprise to them but that was the first time that I remember saying it to\nanybody who was not already -- I don\u2019t know how they, I didn\u2019t know how they would react to\nthat idea.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No it hasn\u2019t.",
        "A: I think I feel very Jewish but very, very Jewish but not because of religion. Some of our\nrelatives, my sister married an Orthodox man and her children are very, quite Orthodox.\nEspecially the son. And my wife has, she has several siblings. But one of them also is very\nOrthodox and married a very Orthodox man and seven children are very Orthodox. So it\u2019s kind\nof strange sometimes. I think. I don\u2019t need this. I don\u2019t or maybe I don\u2019t say I don\u2019t need this\nmaybe. I feel I would like it but I can\u2019t do it. Like I see it\u2019s when they get together with other\npeople, they don\u2019t have the same kind of faith. They -- there\u2019s a rapport through religion that I\ndon\u2019t have. And the prayers and \u2014",
        "A: No, we tried several things. In fact two weekends ago we went to an open house from the\nKehila Chadasha. We went to go on their retreat. But we had been members when -- before we\nhad our son. And it was very child oriented it seemed to us. So we thought we didn\u2019t feel it was\nour place, but we went to this one meeting and it was quite amazing to us. The besides the bagel\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nnosh and all that, they had a discussion led by a reporter for the Washington Post who reports on\nthe national news. He talked about the elections. There was another reporter from -- the who\nworks for the Los Angeles Times that was there. And but among the audience, everybody who\ncommented, they were so brilliant. And it was an amazing intellectual feat going on and so in\nfact I felt, I didn\u2019t feel up to par. But so we\u2019re going to try that.",
        "A: Well there\u2019s more time to think about it.",
        "A: Yes. And especially being in the environment with the -- role with the museum. So there are\nall these other activities and movies and so on. And my wife doesn\u2019t mind. She likes so it\u2019s a\ngood thing cause she didn\u2019t go through that. But it would be more difficult if she couldn\u2019t relate\nto it and didn\u2019t want to participate. She doesn\u2019t participate in the child survivors group. One\nthing when we started, we didn\u2019t allow non survivors, even spouses. Some people were very\nadamant about that. But that\u2019s all changed but my wife feels -- she\u2019s much younger than me.\nShe\u2019s young and it\u2019s not her thing.",
        "A: No I\u2019m not angry.",
        "A: No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: Other children who didn\u2019t have that experience don\u2019t have such happy childhoods. In fact my\nwife\u2019s background, I mean the family was poor. They had five children and her childhood wasn\u2019t\nthat happy.",
        "A: Well one thing that I\u2019ve been thinking about at the museum, maybe elsewhere too. There 1s a\nlot of emphasis on seems to me, on the bystander as being guilty for not doing something. Well\nto me that\u2019s, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Just because there are injustices going around, it doesn\u2019t\nmean that you can specially being in an occupied country or in Germany, doesn\u2019t mean that you\ncan just go out there and do something. I mean you can do something, get hit over the head and\nthat\u2019s the end. A lot of the, ?ve become aware that a lot of the people were involved was due to\ncircumstances. If (inaudible) And somebody came, knocked at the door and asked if they\nwould take a child, didn\u2019t say Jewish child. She suspected it she said. Others, that woman who,\nJeanne. Mademoiselle Jeanne, she was a school teacher. She was 20 years old, a school teacher\nand someone said kids were disappearing, Jewish kids. So she had this connection. She was then\ndetermined helping other kids. And I\u2019m now watchful. I\u2019m on the lookout and I see that\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s happening. With the priest in Belgium. There was also an aspect that he was asked or, so\nI see it\u2019s not that easy to just decide well this is not fair. Then I\u2019m going to go out and\ndemonstrate or something. You can do that here under certain circumstances which 1s perfect as\nlong as you\u2019ve got your permit or whatever. You can have a demonstration.\nBut under the conditions that, in Germany and later in the occupied countries, I admire the white\nrose movement. Its but they gave their lives for nothing. Same with a lot of \u2014 another thing that\ngets to me 1s the myth about the Jews not resisting. There was of course some armed resistance.\nBut it was futile. What does that mean. Countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway,\nDenmark, Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Holland. Almost Russia were invaded and almost they\nwere defeated, not Russia -- almost. What does it mean to resist? Well there was resistance but it\ndid take all kind of form. Every time you didn\u2019t do what they wanted you to do. Every time you\ndidn\u2019t report to the work, when you were chosen or you didn\u2019t go to the place where you were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012\nsupposed to go so they can deport you. Or when you were supposed register. Hiding children.\nAll these things were resistance. And so it, I\u2019ve been, that\u2019s bothered me for a long time.",
        "A: There\u2019s all kinds of resistance and the armed resistance was I think well, it\u2019s wonderful that\npeople did decide, ok we\u2019re going to resist with weapons and but in general I guess you could\nsay that it was futile. And they didn\u2019t survive. Many times hostages were killed.",
        "A: For very brief periods, visits. When I was living in Paris, when I had an aunt who had been in\nTangier. She\u2019s actually not Jewish. I didn\u2019t even know that. When my uncle died in Tangier, she\nand their two daughters move to Frankfurt, where she\u2019s from I guess. And while I was in Paris I\nvisited you know for two weekends. And another time with Arlene, when we were coming, when\nwe're living in France we did a lot of traveling back and forth. She\u2019d come here for a summer\nand so one time there was some I don\u2019t know if it was a controller\u2019s strike or whatever. I don\u2019t\nremember what it was. I think it had something to do with controllers, so we couldn\u2019t get a\nflight, a commercial flight back here. But my brother who was in the tourist business arranged\nfor us to get on a, I think it was a charter flight or something from Salzburg in Germany. So we\nwent there you know to spend the night and so I felt \u2014",
        "A: ?\u2019m not comfortable wherever I can\u2019t speak the language and my German is limited in\nvocabulary. It\u2019s also limited by the fact that I only spoke it with my parents or relatives. So I\ndon\u2019t really know how to talk to people. When I was in college there was a Swiss, it was from\nan Italian area. So his German was \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 16, 2012",
        "A: It was both. I still thought you know when I saw older people, what did they do. But you\nknow I, at least intellectually I think, didn\u2019t do anything more than people do in other countries\nin that kind of situation.",
        "A: My parents got, yeah they did.",
        "A: I think my brother got a -- and sister got a few hundred dollars for the loss of school. I didn\u2019t\nget anything.",
        "A: Yeah my father had a pension. They got, they lost the apartment in Berlin. We left illegally\nacross the border illegal. My we left, my father believed that this wasn\u2019t going to, Hitler wasn\u2019t\ngoing to last. Like a lot of other people were not informed. Well I think a lot of professionals\nlost their jobs so they left. But my father had this business. And it was getting better as its\ncompetition was leaving because he held on. Some things we\u2019re doing well. So he didn\u2019t want to\nleave but then his friend \u2014 I\u2019m not sure it was a friend \u2014 it was they used to have a German maid\nuntil 35. And her boyfriend was a policeman. He came to see my father in 38. He said Max you\nhave to leave and something\u2019s going to be terrible. And I think he had knowledge about the\nKristallnacht plans. So my father took my brother and sister and they were caught at the border\nby the Dutch there. And they were put in prison but he got out and then see my brother and\nsister disagreed on whether we left before or after Kristallnacht. And I think it was both. They\nleft before but they were caught and sent back and \u2014",

This interview is part of the museum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust survivors and\nwitnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. You have been interviewed before by the\nSteven Spielberg Shoah Foundation, but just to put this interview in a framework, I\u2019m going to\nsummarize where you were during the war and then we will focus on your post-Holocaust\nexperience. You were born August 9, 1937 in Berlin. Your parents were originally from Poland\nand you have an older brother, Mani and a sister, Rosa were eight and nine years older than you.\nYour family went to Antwerp, Belgium in 1938 and then in May 1940 you went to the French\nborder, but you were stateless because your parents had been from Poland. You went back to\nAntwerp and your father was called to work so your family left Antwerp and suddenly went to\nBrussels in 1941. In the summer of 1942, you went into hiding. The three children were placed\nwith a family, a non-Jewish family whose name was Coons. And then later you and your sister\nwent to the outskirts of the city to a children\u2019s home. And then after that your mother came and\ngot you and placed you with another family, the Von der Lindens. And then you joined your\nparents again and you went to Brussels and your mother came and got you from the Von der\nLindens right before liberation. So we are now up to the time of liberation. Before we go on\nthough, I just wanted to ask you if you had any early, early memories cause you were so young\nborn in the summer of 37. For instance about what happened at Dunkirk. Can you tell us a little\nbit about that?\nHarry Markowicz: Yes, that\u2019s my very, very first memory. It happened at the border. Or near the\nborder. We had been refused entry into France because we were stateless. And my memory is\nbeing in a ditch with my mother and other people.",
