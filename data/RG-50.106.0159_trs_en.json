We were perfectly content, got along. My parents never -\nMarch 7, 2003\n- the parents never thought that Catholicism will affect us in any way. And every\nperiod there was a 10 minute pause for prayer when everybody got on their knees\nand prayed, with the exception of the Jewish and the Lutheran children. We didn't\nhave to do that, we just sat and did our own thing and our -- the rabbi and the other\npriests came once or twice a week for religious lessons, and that was given after\nschool, in the school area.",
        "Q: Was your family religiously observant?",

That\u2019s why my\nmother [indecipherable] Hungarian, and so is my father -- my hus -- no, his is\nactually German, but th-tha -- that same cit -- that same area in 1938 -- in 1918,\nsorry, after the Warsaw pact it was -- became part of Czechoslovakia. And\nCzechoslovakia was very -- not anti-Semitic, 1t was very liberal those few years\nfrom 1918 to 1938. In \u00b038 that area became Hungary. That very same area was\ndivided by Hitler, even though Hitler had not invaded Hungary til \u00b044. That --\nthey divided Bohemia, Slovakia and Moravia and -- and which part of it was\ngiven to Russia, this part was given to Slovakia. So we were living, you know, in\nhu -- the other part was given to Hungary, and we lived at that time, from \u00b038 to\n\u00b039 til we came in Hungary with the Czech border, you see. And that was one of\nthe reasons I always came [indecipherable]",

        "A: No.",

        "Q: When you were little, what kinds of things did you do for fun?\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "A: Well, I have three daughters and eight grandchildren. I could say that\n[indecipherable] the same, I couldn\u2019t think of anything that was different. We\nplayed with toys, we played with each other, we played tag, we -- the toy thing\nwas, I think worldwide except, you know, I didn\u2019t have the electronic stuff that\nthey had. But everything else, I think was played the same way as here.",
        "Q: When you were a little girl, what did you think you\u2019d be when you grew up?",
        "A: What did I what? Want to be? I really did not delve into the future at that time\nbecause things were beginning to be uncertain even though in Europe it was\nbelieved that children should be seen and not heard. There wasn\u2019t much\ninformation given to us in terms of the political situation. Not just me but people --\nkids of my generation. But the uncertainty, the possibility of the uncertainty\ncoming was in the air and it was -- it was like -- felt that this 1s not going to be\nforever the way it is and kids my age didn\u2019t plan for the future at all. And the other\nthing is that 90 percent of my contemporaries were single children because their\nparents were convinced that there\u2019ll be another war, and they didn\u2019t want to raise\nany more, you know. After the first World War, they thought that they did not\nwant to raise any more children for awhile. And in the little town that I lived, I ca -\n- I couldn\u2019t count on my two hands the number of families where they had more\nthan one child. And ask that -- you know, not just my parents, but everybody was\nMarch 7, 2003\nwilling to admit that. They don\u2019t want to -- they saw another war coming without\nanything, at that point.",
        "Q: When you look back on your childhood, do you have some favorite memory, or\nsome favorite memories that you\u2019d like to share?",
        "A: It was a very happy childhood I had. I -- I -- I belonged to a -- the upper middle\nclass. I -- I wouldn\u2019t call us that rich, although I don\u2019t even know what rich meant,\nbecause all my friends had a maid, a nanny and a gardener and all these people --\nthere was nothing that I ever ne-needed materially. I had two parents that were\nvery devoted. My father took me for a walk every day to the park. My mother did\nsomething else with me every day. I had the grandparents and I had the -- lots of\nrelatives in different cities. Now it\u2019s very small, but in different cities that were\nable to visit on weekends and on holidays and things like that. My parents had, I\ndon\u2019t know, between seven and 10 siblings, both of them, and they all had\nfamilies. So getting together with them probably was the most enjoyable time,\nbecause they were just very warm, and very affectionate and very -- I -- it -- it --\nit\u2019s an amazing way to look back, that I didn\u2019t have anything bad happening to me,\nor you know, there\u2019s some people that they were called a dirty Jew. Didn\u2019t even\nhappen to me, it did not. And I don\u2019t think my parents, you know, cloistered me.\nMarch 7, 2003\nWe had some Christian neighbors that were -- the kids were my age and we played\nwith them [indecipherable].",
        "Q: Can you remember when things started to change for your family?",
        "A: My father was a very perceptive person who did not finish anything, not even\nelementary school. And the stories trickling out of the concentration camp -- not --\nI me -- the ghettos, actually, because that wasn\u2019t then, were trickling down to\ncentral Europe and he beli -- ga -- he began to believe them and he discuss it with\nhis siblings, and everybody laughed at him. He had a brother who was a doctor\nwho said, I picked every brick in this house and they\u2019re not going to come and\ntouch me, and I was very good to the mayor and I treated everybody free. And we\nhad -- they ha -- we had one uncle, he had -- my father had a brother here, who\nwas going to send a visa to anybody who wanted to come. The only one who\nwanted to come is my father. And that was like by mid-30\u2019s, and they send him a\nvisa and my father said, if I go by -- without me and my mother, we\u2019ll never see\neach other again. Which everybody else thought was crazy, but it was a true fact.\nWe never would have seen. He said, I don\u2019t care if we -- how long we wait, we\nwait until we get a visa for everybody. And then that took, again, time, and we\nmight have to wait a long time. What made our passage possible, in 1939 August\n3\" which was the last American ship that left the harbor, was the fact that in 1938\nMarch 7, 2003\nHitler gave this part of Slovakia to Hungary. We were Slovak nationals in a\nHungarian quota. If -- we had -- let\u2019s put it this way. Every country had a quota of\nhow many are permitted, right? When we were in Czechoslovakia the quota was\nthis long, very long. Then -- now all of a sudden we\u2019re Czech nationals and we are\nnow part of Hungary. Now, in the Hungarian embassy the Czech quota was very\nsmall, because there weren\u2019t that many Czech Nationals now in one year moved\nthere. So our luck was that that par -- Hitler gave that part to Hungary and there\nwas a Hungarian officer in -- working in the American embassy who told my\nfather the following; if you sell everything, buy yourself three ship tickets an-and -\n- and train tickets to Vienna, I\u2019ll take your visa and put it on top. And everybody\nagain in the family thought my father was crazy, and he -- the only thing that\nhappened to him, he was taken to a labor camp, for eight months we didn\u2019t hear\nabout him. Then he came out of the labor camp, he got in touch with this\nemployee and he sold whatever he could and brought three tickets from LaHavre\nto New York, and three train tickets from Budapest to LaHavre. And we left on\nAugust third and in September the war was [indecipherable].",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to have you go back an-and give me some more details on -- on\nsome of what you just told me.",
        "A: Okay.\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "Q: How much did you know -- I realize you just told me that your parents didn\u2019t\nspeak politics in front of you.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: But how much did you know about what was going on in Germany?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Tell me more about your father going to this labor camp. On -- on what charges\nwas he taken, or when was he taken --",
        "A: It was -- people were lined up, the -- a police order comes on a bullhorn that\neverybody between 25 and 45, let\u2019s say, line up. And they line up and they don\u2019t\ntell them wh-what, where, they left without coming back. And just a couple of\nweeks later we got a postcard from him, where he was located, and he was\nworking on the road, a labor camp. And there was no way of knowing where or\nhow to bring him back or something. He came back on his own after about eight\nmonths.",
        "Q: A-And this was a labor camp, not a concentration camp.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But you mentioned that he had heard about concentration camps.",
        "A: Not [indecipherable] ghettos, because the concentration camps did not get\ndone til about 1941. But tr-trickling information was coming from the ghettos.\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "Q: What was the state of your father\u2019s health when he came back from the labor\ncamp?",
        "A: He was pretty -- he was pretty good. He felt that they worked many hours, but\nthey got enough food, and he was very healthy. My recollection was that his health\nwas not affected.",
        "Q: You talked about the political changes and how Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the\nchanges. How did the relations between you and your Christian neighbors change,\nif they changed, once the political landscape changed?",
        "A: Well, you s -- you -- 1t was a double change, you see, it was a political change\nand a religious change at the time. When the -- when the Hungarians invaded our\narea, the bullhorns went by saying, if anybody is caught speaking hungari --\nCzech, they\u2019Il be killed or they\u2019Il be put in prison. Now, I\u2019m 11 and a half years\nold, and a -- a -- [immediately forgot all Czech. I mean, it was a very frightening\nthing to constantly being told that. Czech this -- you know, you went to Czech\nschool, you had Czech friends, you -- you had to forget that. The Hungarians are\nvery nationalistic -- were very nationalistic at that point. And the -- the friendship\nthat -- that I had with kids that were Christian cooled off, but they didn't die\ncompletely. Those that lived like in the same yo -- like our little apartment house,\nwith the same backyard coming th -- we saw them, but even as a child I remember\nMarch 7, 2003\nthere was some cooling off. But, you know, the real thing in Hungary happened\nin \u00b044 when Eichmann invite -- invaded Hungary. But there was a\n[indecipherable] party, which was a -- there wa -- in Slovakia there was a -- a big\nanti-Semitic party an-and also in Hungary there. All these parties made it ready\nand easy for him to march in because they were prepared years ahead. A form of\nthe Nazi party in these countries.",
        "Q: How did they know who in the population was Jewish and who wasn\u2019t? You\nsaid your father didn\u2019t have the full beard.",
        "A: He had no beard. Well, if you go on the third floor of the museum you'll see\nhow they knew. Every city had a city hall and when you were born your religion\nwas put on your birth certificate. And it was very easy for the Germans to look at\nthe birth certificate and see, because that was there. The only people who escaped\nthat is people in large cities where they -- it was easy for them to move, you know,\nthey just didn\u2019t stay with the -- but a little town like mine, everybody knew who\nwas Jewish and those who didn\u2019t ratted on each other and -- but it was all\nrecording in the -- in the city hall of who was Jewish and who was not. And in\nlarge cities the other thing they did is that they made the men undress cause every\nJew was circumcised and there were no Christians that were circumcised for\nMarch 7, 2003\nhealth reasons at that time. So if people were in doubt, or if they felt the soldiers\nthat they were -- somebody was escaping, they would make them get undressed.",
        "Q: When the political situation changed, how much of that did you understand?",
        "A: How much what?",
        "Q: How much did you understand of the political changes?",
        "A: Very little.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about the kinds of arrangements that were\nmade for you to leave Europe?",
        "A: Wa -- from the United States came the visa and a letter stating that we will not\nbe a burden for the state, that my uncle will take of us financially and food-wise\nand put us up and things like that. And 1-1n Europe what we did 1s that we said --\nw-we sold everything, gave it to this one man in the embassy and some other\nthings that we had, we just gave it up, to relatives. I remember a bathtub, which\nwas a big deal, we had a -- an American bathroom and we gave sa -- the tub to\nsome relatives and they gave it away. But I was miserable, because I blamed my\nparents for taking me away from my friends, you see. There\u2019s no way that they\nwere willing to explain to me that this -- what was going on. Far as I knew I did\nnot know why we were coming. And I could have understood because I mean,\nafter all, I was almost 13.\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "Q: S -- your family gave away most of their possessions, but what -- what could\nyour family take with them and what could you take with you when you left?",
        "A: My father was a very honest man, he was given all sorts of advice, to put\nmoney in the lining of his coat and everything. And my father said that if an\nofficer will look at him, he will get red, and he couldn\u2019t get away with anything\nlike -- he just doesn\u2019t want to start life in the United States with hidden money or\nhidden any kind of -- any kind -- anything hidden. We bought nothing that was of\n-- of value. We bought my mo -- from my mother\u2019s trousseau I have two or three\ntablecloth that have her initials that must be close to a hundred years old, which\nmy grandchildren love. We bought some photographs, not much. There was a\nlimit on how much you can -- you can, you know, wa -- in terms of weight. Don\u2019t\nforget, this was the last ship. I don\u2019t know whether they knew it was, but they\nknew it was nik -- close to the last ship coming to the United States. And, you\nknow, I have no recollection of what I brought. It -- 1t must have been a doll, cause\nI was very fond of a doll that -- that came. But for a long time I felt that there was\nnothing I want to get attached to, because you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to go\naway. I did not become attached to anything material. Even now I feel that\nmaterial things are replaceable.",
        "Q: What did you most regret leaving behind?\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "A: My relatives and my friends.",
        "Q: Were you able to say goodbye to them?",
        "A: Yes, we were able to say goodbye to them. Very sad, but we did.",
        "Q: Tell me about actually leaving your hometown and this journey over to\nLaHavre.",
        "A: We took a train from this little town and we had to change someplace, I forgot.\nThis -- the vet -- the worst part of 1t was that we went through Vienna where there\nwas an hour and a half stopover, and that was the first time I saw the SS troops.\nAnd they came with guns and very, very -- their demeanor was wa -- was very\nscary, even [indecipherable] I think afterwards, but to a kid, when they asked for\nyour passport and your luggage and what they went through, was very much like,\nyou know, at that point I thought this must be a concentration camp what they do.\nCourse I realized later that that was not so. But for me at that time, it was probably\nthe scariest -- no, it was not the scariest. Can I go back to something that was\nscary? Okay. When this happened that this ar -- little area -- Czechoslovakia was\nlike this, it was big here, then it was Moravia, and Slovakia got thinner and then\nit was Putka Pascaoush which went to Russia. Slovakia was, let\u2019s say, a thin\npiece like this, okay? And this was given to Hungary. And the emp -- the other\nhalf was given to Poland. This narrow country known as Slovakia. Half went to\nMarch 7, 2003\nPoland and half went to Hungary. The Poles were very upset that these Jews\nwere being thrown over the border for them to take care of. Most of them were\nHassidic and very, very religious. So they packed up these Hassidic Jews and their\nwives and children, got them out of Poland and threw them across the border to\nslo -- back to Slovakia and to -- the Slovakia that was a -- Hungary at that point.\nThis was a Friday night, and they separated the men, the children and the things,\nand they did these -- put these men on the square and with a large scissors they\njust started to cut off their beards and their payas. And there was shrieking all\nnight. And by morning the trucks took them away, probably [indecipherable] I\ndon\u2019t know where. But it was a terribly nightmare-ish thing for a kid to see, the\nreaction of these people that on Friday night the beards were [indecipherable].\nAnd in the museum on the second floor, I found a picture of this cutting of the\nbeard of a number of people and I went up to the [indecipherable] archives, and it\nwas not our town, but it was some place like 15 miles away that it occurred, so it\nmust have occurred in more than one area. And I consider myself very lucky\nbecause this is the only thing that I personally witnessed on our -- during -- during\nthe entire time I was there.",
        "Q: Did you fear for your own safety at that time?\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "A: My parents were on both side of me, and I did not fear -- I didn\u2019t feel I\nbelonged to that group that was being attacked. Somehow or other I felt, well\nnobody has a beard in my family and they\u2019re not tha -- and they\u2019re not do that to\nus. I didn't see anybody taken from my immediate family as we were on that train\nor on the boat or anything like that.",
        "Q: How old were you when you came to the United States?",
        "A: 13.",
        "Q: And what were your expectations of America?",
        "A: Nothing. I really did not know. To go back, there was a nun in the convent\nwhere we lived who spent 27 years in the United States and I took lessons with\nher. So when I came my parents thought I would speak English well, which I\nreally didn\u2019t do that well, and I was put in high school, first grade. And I learned\nvery quickly on the bus with kids that were going from my neighborhood to high\nschool, and I picked up English pretty fast, it wasn\u2019t hard for me. I did very well in\nhigh school. I -- I was put in -- in th -- they used to have repor -- programs,\nhandwritten and a principal came in about two months in a class, in a Spanish\nclass and said to the teacher that Miss Reichman belongs to speech, this is an\nerror here, S-P, she should have been in speech instead of Spanish. And the\nteacher said, you can\u2019t take her away, she\u2019s my best student. So I stayed in\nMarch 7, 2003\nSpanish and I learned Spanish and I got in the honors program in that high school,\nJulia Richmond High School, which was associated with Hunter and Brooklyn\nCollege, and in re -- I -- I enjoyed high school very much because to me it was like\na new world, and I -- I guess when you excel in school so unexpectedly and make\nfriends -- there was only ra -- ba -- one bad experience in high school. There was\nmore than one, it sort of comes back. I-I\u2019m not doing this very sequentially, is that\nokay? Okay. My clothing was a problem, because that was a real sore thumb. I\nstood out at that point anyway, it was very different, the clothes, even though I had\nlovely clothes because my mother designed my clothes and she had all this\nfabulous material. When my parents came out they didn\u2019t speak English well at\nall, it was very difficult. And an uncle of mine died and left my father a thousand\ndollars, and my father decided to buy a business for a thousand dollars. So they\nbought a business, a rooming house for 19,000 dollars, a thousand down, and they\nrented rooms in this rooming house and we had an apartment on the ground floor.\nAnd in this -- and then there wasn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t make enough money or\nanything, it was somehow or other, somebody in the family advised that my\nmother should go with -- they should go to work as a couple for a year and put\nsome money away. My mother became a maid and my father became a butler\nsomeplace, and I stayed with this one uncle who sent us the affidavit. Now, my\nMarch 7, 2003\nfather was the type of person that he did not ever take a glass of water for himself.\nIf he wanted a glass of water he went to the restaurant, ordered a cup of coffee and\nthey gave him some water. He never did anything by himself. And he did this and\nhe -- they took this job, they worked 18 hours a day, the two of them. They made\n20 dollars or 25 dollars a month and when they had enough money with that\nthousand dollars, that\u2019s when they left and they bought this -- this rooming house.\nBut while I was -- while they were working as a maid and a butler, the daughter of\nthat family and I went to the same high school. And she got a gang together and\nshe -- they teased my clothes tremendously. And I had like two or three very\nunpleasant things about this particular clique that was just -- I now notice, I teach,\nhow much nicer children are to the Asian children and things like that. My\ngeneration it was the opposite, or anyhow in New York where I was. It may be\nbecause of where I lived, but they made absolutely my life miserable with my\nclothes and my accent, my a -- a -- at that point I was not yet excelling and I was\nvery, very unhappy and I didn\u2019t want to complain to my parents cause I knew they\nwere doing this, they had to work at what they were doing. And eventually, and I\ncan\u2019t think of time-wise except that maybe it was in two years, they got -- they\nbought this business and -- and then I was able to somehow or other make my own\nMarch 7, 2003\nfriends and I got on the honor roll at school, at this country school and things like\nthat and I got out of this circle of people who were teasing me.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to pause and change tapes. Just one moment.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Susan Berlin. This is tape number one, side B.\nAnd you had just told me about some of the difficulties you were having with\ntransitioning to the United States. You were talking about this clique. Was -- was\nthat a form of anti-foreign sentiment, did you think, or was it just that you were\nnot part of their clique? Did you -- did you have any anti-foreign experiences\nwhen you first came to this country?",
        "A: Well, I know that teenagers tend to be mean anyway, and they can do the things\nthat some of these girls were doing, but to me they were very specific. Number\none they said -- you know, they were -- made fun of the fact that my parents\nworked for her as a maid and a butler and that made me an inferior person. And\nthe second thing that they were cliquish about is my clothes and my accent. I had\nan accent when I came first. However, the beauty of all that was that I never did\nMarch 7, 2003\ntake speech and every English teacher, including my college English teacher\ndidn\u2019t believe that I wasn\u2019t born here, so somehow I overcame that.",
        "Q: There is one thing that I wanted to ask you that we kind of glossed over. When\nyou first arrived in the United States, what were your first impressions of this\ncountry?",
        "A: Terrified. I was born -- I was -- I lived all my life in this little town. I have -- I\nhave not seen a street light until I went visiting some f -- some relatives in\nHungary [indecipherable] we didn\u2019t even have street light. New York is\nterrifying, you know, the first time you just walk around 1n it. And I lived with an\naunt and an uncle who had no children, which didn\u2019t have -- didn\u2019t add to the\npoint that I wasn\u2019t handled properly in many times. You know, they just said\nhere\u2019s a quarter, go to the movies when I couldn\u2019t -- when I had, you know, when\nI had problems. Everything was very difficult. For instance, the food tasted --\ntasted soapy. I felt that the Coke tasted like they had mixed it with soap and I felt\nthat -- and my parents didn\u2019t, this was only me. I felt that a lot of the food was so\nstrange to my palate, and it all tasted of soap. And I\u2019m sure th -- I know that this\nwas psychological. And it appeared very, very difficult at that point because of all\nthe other problems with being a teenager and then you know, starting to go with\nboys -- not go with boys, but let\u2019s say if I was invited to a sweet 16 party I didn\u2019t\nMarch 7, 2003\nknow how to act. I -- I always said the wrong things and I did the wrong things\nand it took me a very long time to arise from this backward little girl, only child\nwho lived in a town who knew only the things that everybody else did of the same,\nyou know, socially we all did the same thing. I mean, nobody went to a dance\nwithout the other and it was a much closer knit group that I was with, and I had to\novercome that. And that was a very, very hard, for many years. But then, you\nknow, towards the end of high school I was -- I got more into it. I got into\nBrooklyn College, which -- a free school which was a big deal for me and I did\nnot want to go to Hunter. I could not stand the fact that Julia Richmond was four\nyears all girls. And I just said Ill travel anyplace to go with -- just see boys. And\nthen in Brooklyn College I excelled pretty well. And a German professor of mine\nsaid, would you like to apply for a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania?\nI said I don\u2019t want to because my parents can\u2019t afford it. They can\u2019t afford\nColumbia either, but they know I want to get a Masters and they said they\u2019Il take\nthe loan. And he said, just for fun, don\u2019t tell your parents. If it happens, it happens,\njust we\u2019re going to put you in for a full-time scholarship. You will -- anyhow, I got\nthis scholarship, which Brooklyn College was just thrilled, cause I was the first\ngirl -- you know, that used to be an all boys school -- the first girl and the first\nJewish girl, they combined two [indecipherable] got a full time scholarship to\nMarch 7, 2003\nColumbia for a year. Full Masters, food, this -- tuition and everything else. And at\nthat point my father knew how big this was, but he still said to me, you know, I\ncan get that money for Columbia and I would so much rather you went anyhow.\nY-You couldn\u2019t talk me out of 1t. My yi -- my mother worked [indecipherable]\nlook much better on my record if I go to Columbia -- I mean, to the University of\nPennsylvania. So I went to the University of Pennsylvania and that was a blast. I\nreally in -- it was a very difficult school. But first, in several classes when I raised\nmy hand, especially English or philosophy and I opened my mouth, the professor\nwould say, you\u2019re one of those that came from a city college [indecipherable].\nAnd my education just came through in many ways the professors saw that my\nbackground was very, very good and you know, we all, those of us who came\nfrom city colleges were very pleased with what we had as a background. And the\nuniversity [indecipherable] was very nice, it was a great school and I got my\nMasters there and I wanted to teach, and when I finished I couldn\u2019t find a job\nbecause the veterans were coming home and they got preference to all teaching\njob. That was in \u201947. So I have a friend who got a job in Washington, a\npsychologist working for the police department, and sh-she\u2019s my best friend\nactually, and she said to me, I\u2019ll find you a job. Anyhow, two days later she sent\nme a telegram, I got a interview for you in a place and she said, don\u2019t get scared of\nMarch 7, 2003\nthe name, it\u2019s called the Army Intelligence Map Service and they\u2019re looking for\npeople with languages. So she set up this interview and I came down and they\nwere very impressed with my degree, I have a Masters and they hired me on the\nbasis of my Hungarian language, nothing else, none of my other thing, but they\u2019re\nvery short on Hungarian. So I worked there in Map Service from \u201947. I met my\nhusband there, my -- and we got married in 1950. And I worked until 1952 when I\nhad my first child.",

        "A: All right.",
        "Q: Okay. You mentioned that you would do things in high school, you would --\nyou'd go to parties and you would do the wrong thing. What do you mean you\nwould do the wrong thing?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t know when it was appropriate to kiss or not to kiss and they spin\nthe bottle and things like that that were totally Greek to me. And then when I\nwouldn\u2019t kiss anybody then I was made fun of. You know, this etiquette that you\ngrow up with as to how you act at a party is something that, you know, with time I\npicked up, but it took a long time, and nobody was nice enough or honest enough\nto show me how to, you know, how to do this slowly and properly, or fast and\nimproperly. It was like Greek to me because I was very little when I left.\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "Q: You had told me about this clique that really tormented you and then you said\nyou -- you began to make some of your own friends. Who were some of your\nfriends? When you found people that were of a mind that you --",
        "A: The girls that were -- I found on the bus. You see, this girl that taunted me lived\nin the fancy section of Park Avenue, she was never on the bus and everything.\nBut they we -- I lived on the East Side and they -- then I saw a lot of the same\nkids on the bus and they were kind enough to talk to me and I talked to them and\nthen we met for coffee on Saturday or go to the movies. And they seemed to have\nbeen all in the neighborhood where I wa -- we had -- where I was living.",
        "Q: Were they Jewish, or were they foreign?",
        "A: They were Jewish. I didn\u2019t have one non-Jewish friend except in college. I\ndon\u2019t know why.",

        "Q: I\u2019m going to take you back just a few years. When you first came to this\ncountry, were you able to stay in touch with family and friends that you left\nbehind?",
        "A: No, very soon the mail just did not go through at all. We didn\u2019t receive. We had\nno idea who was alive or who was dead.\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "Q: In those first years when you were in this country, the war had started in\nEurope, how much did you know about what was going on over there?",
        "A: Very little. I think the first notices, you know, this Polish diplomat tried to\nbring information to Roosevelt, but he was never publicized. And there were\nrumors coming around but we all called it rumors because we didn't want to\nbelieve it. The first time that the whole family and my circle knew about it is in\n\"45 when they started to show the films.",
        "Q: During the war did your parents ever talk about the political situation in\nEurope?",
        "A: Very little until I wa -- until I was m-much older, 16 - 17.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of those conversations with your parents during the war?",
        "A: No. But I know that it was late because I have grandchildren and I have taken\nmy 11 year old to the Holocaust and she completely understands what\u2019s going on,\nand th -- what went on and children ha -- well, maybe now they have a deeper\nperception, but we did not know. We -- our parents sheltered us t-to an extent that\no -- I ma -- I now feel I would have understood if I had been told earlier.",
        "Q: You took your grandchildren to the Holocaust Museum, Ill ask you about your\nchildren and grandchildren in -- in a little while. I also wanted to -- to ask you if\nyour level of religious observance changed when you came to the United States?\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Yeah, I -- I didn\u2019t want to bring up myself. I was raised in an\nOrthodox home [indecipherable] I became more Reformed, I would say, when\nwe came here and we be -- joined the Reform Temple and [indecipherable] like\nthat. But my mother had a kosher house. When the pictures about Germany came\nback, the skeletons and everything, and I saw my relatives in all those\nphotographs, I became an atheist, but a true atheist. I began to talk to God about\nthe fact that how could you let something like this happen. And any amount that I\nlistened to Elie Wiesel or anybody else that it wasn\u2019t God\u2019s fault, I felt that God\ncould have intervened. And as time went on I felt this was a very difficult life, to\nbe an atheist if you were not always an atheist. And I thought about that too and I\nfelt very guilty about the fact that I survived with my parents. Why? Wh -- I sa -- I\n-- in order for me to stop being an atheist I had to find out why I survived. I had to\nhave a mission to survive because so many great people died. And I found my\nmission, an-and it might be a true -- a fiction of my imagination but 1t worked for\nme, that when my first child was born and I looked at her and I said, I know why I\nsurvived, because I know that through her and my other children, Judaism will\ncontinue forever. And I took this very seriously and I have three wonderful Jewish\ndaughters, who believe very strongly. Who know everything about the Holocaust\nthere is to know, even more than I do sometimes I think. And who strongly I have,\nMarch 7, 2003\ny-you know, educated them 1n the fact that I ha -- believe that I am only surviving\nbecause to me, they will carry on Judaism. And I don\u2019t mean banging your head\nJudaism, I mean just Judaism philosophy, in principle and in -- as far as they want\nto carry it, religious. They were all Bar Mitzvahed and Bat Mitzvahed, my\nchildren, my grandchildren. I decided to take each one of them to Israel after they\nwere Bar Mitzvahed. When my oldest one became 13, Rabin was killed and we\ndecided it wasn\u2019t safe to go to Israel. So we went to France instead, it was a\nwonderful trip and ever since any of them become Bar Mitzvahed or Bat\nMitzvahed, they take a trip, but it has to be safe by me and her parents and Israel\nhas not yet been safe. One of my major dreams 1s that I take all of them to Israel\nfor a week, to [indecipherable] and I\u2019ve been there three or four times with my\nhusband. And I still have this dream of taking my very big family to Israel, but I\ndon\u2019t think that that\u2019s in the cards, and realistically I don\u2019t feel that politically it\u2019s\ngoing to happen, that it\u2019s safe.",
        "Q: You -- you\u2019ve jumped many years ahead of me, I have to bring you back.",
        "A: Okay. [indecipherable]",

        "A: [indecipherable]\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "Q: Can you give me a little insight into what was going on in your family with\nyour parents and -- and their feelings and their anxieties, their worries, how you\nwere feeling during the 40\u2019s when the war was raging.",
        "A: If they did, they never communicated to me, no. They -- that generation did not\ngo into fi -- I don\u2019t think my parents were different. They were not very much into\nfeelings of the children. Th-Th-They were raised that the children have to sort of\ngo with the flow and -- and -- and -- and just accept the feelings as the parents said\nit, not have different of their own.",
        "Q: What were their feelings?",
        "A: They didn't even talk about that. We had very little meaningful conversations.",
        "Q: And how were they supporting themselves in the 1940\u2019s, the first half of the\n40\u2019s?",
        "A: Well, at first th -- I told you that they became a butler and a maid and then they\ngot this thousand dollars and they bought this apartment house. Now, I just want to\nsay one thing which probably has nothing to do with this, except they bought -- the\napartment house -- the rooming house was 19,000 dollars and they had a thousand\ndollars cash, they put it down. And then they lived there, my mother and father\nand I went to college, they stayed there until my father died and then my mother\nmoved into an apartment and then she moved here to Washington the last 12\nMarch 7, 2003\nyears of her life. And she had a friend who sol -- who sent her a newspaper\nclipping that that 19,000 dollar house was sold for one million, to show how the\nreal estate market had gone in 50 years in New York.",
        "Q: Do you remember Pearl Harbor?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was that experience like for you?",
        "A: Well, I just came home from Hebrew school and we were having lunch when\nmy father put the radio on and he came back and it was very scary. I felt that -- an-\nand again, my par -- my father and I talked very little about it, but he felt that the\nworld was in -- is in a bad spot. That at the ti -- it was very dangerous to be\nattacked by the Japanese. But the stress was still on Hitler, that\u2019s the worst thing\n[indecipherable], but that\u2019s -- was his connection.",
        "Q: What changes do you remember from among your friends and just the general\nAmerican population after Pearl Harbor? What memories do you have of that\ntime?",
        "A: Well, there was rationings that I remember. We didn\u2019t have a car, so it wasn\u2019t -\n- there was a food rationing. There was, you know, stamp licking and sometime\nsome things you did with -- with thread, or balls, or some kind of something.\nSomething connected with the war effort on a voluntary basis. And very much --\nMarch 7, 2003\neverybody was very much in favor of -- of the atomic bomb, of my generation.\nAnd my children\u2019s generation feel it was a terrible thing. And you know, we talk\nabout that a lot, even though it -- it -- 1t -- and I think that that\u2019s also common.\nThey weren\u2019t alive then and I think it was a very important way to save American\nlives. There wasn\u2019t any other way.",
        "Q: Do you remember the media coverage of the war during the war, or in the\nimmediate post-war period?",
        "A: Of Europe? Well, it was very hard for me to ascertain, you know, what -- what\nreally happened. It was a -- a -- I thought it was -- 1t showed very realistic things\nand what I saw after the war, I don\u2019t think that the media exaggerated. I think that\nthe media showed the European war pretty much of how it was.",
        "Q: When did you feel like you really were acclimated to American life and that\nyou kind of fit in now?",
        "A: When I became a citizen, I think that was the real time and the -- it was one of\nthese group things that we were -- you go 1n and you -- you -- you are sworn in by\na judge. When a judge called me over into his chamber and said, I see you\nreceived a free American education and you received a Masters degree and I\u2019m\ngoing to have to ask you questions, I\u2019m not going to pass you with the -- with the\ngroup. And I said okay, and American history was one of my favorite subjects\nMarch 7, 2003\nanyway. I don\u2019t recall -- but he was very specific on dates, things that really were\nnot that important to remember, I felt. But I happened to have taken it recently and\nI answered everything very -- I answered all his questions, and he said to me that\nhe was very proud that I knew American history. And he said, what I did with me\nhe does with all American -- with young people. He feels that if you get a college\neducation you should be able to know something about American history. And a --\nand I agree with him.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: When was that? I believe I was 21.",
        "Q: What attempts did your parents make to find family and friends after the war?",
        "A: We used every possible -- I -- if you know -- I\u2019m sure you know HIAS is\nprobably the primary organization a-and we went -- and then we found one or two\nrelatives that -- distant relatives, like second or third cousins, alive. We wrote to\nthem to see whether they knew of anybody and we ended up with one first cousin\nof mine in Israel, one in Czechoslovakia and one in Hungary, and a few second\ncousins out of over a hundred, there were over a hundred relatives. And these\nsearches went periodically, you know, several locations and several ways. And\nalso some stories were -- they were in Auschwitz and through a fence they\nrecognized the relative and then that relative never came out. Very little, very,\nMarch 7, 2003\nvery little. And you know, they -- they just -- in our Temple, every -- th-the name\nof how many relatives died in the Holocaust and mine and my husband\u2019s 1s the\nlongest. Which is not a credit, but it just shows how many of my relatives died.\nAnd -- and that continued a very long idea of guilt. Even though I felt that through\nmy children and grandchildren I will perpetuate this wonderful Judaism, that I\nwish -- there\u2019s no full explanation of why they died. It wasn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t believe it\nwas for Israel, or for me. I don\u2019t believe that it was only man\u2019s choice. I believe\nthat there\u2019s nobody that really knows. And I don\u2019t want to ponder that because if I\ndo I can go nuts, frankly, you know. Th-The real pondering on that, if you want to\nhave a specific answer, there\u2019s no answer to that.",
        "Q: Did you follow the war crimes trials after the war?",
        "A: To some extent. The Nuremberg Trials yes, to some extent. They were very\nlenient, I thought. My husband\u2019s a lawyer and he tried to follow it more. They --\nthey should have been dealt with much stronger.",
        "Q: Did you follow the debate in the U.N. regarding the partition of Palestine?",
        "A: That\u2019s an emotional issue. That\u2019s -- y-you know, it\u2019s -- I\u2019m at the stage with,\nright now that when an Arab speaks, I turn the television off. Now, I admit this --\nnot -- my grandchildren tried to talk me out of this, but I -- it\u2019s the -- it -- we\nshould learn more about Islam. I said, well, do you think that anybody suggested\nMarch 7, 2003\nthat we should learn more about Hitler? That Hitler would have been better to the\nJews if we knew more about it? No, we knew everything of course, cause he wrote\nin Mein Kampf. I don\u2019t believe I want to learn about Islam, I don\u2019t want to\nunderstand about Islam, because I basically feel they all want to kill anybody who\nis not a Moslem. And -- and a religion like that, believing in a God to kill\neverybody else who doesn\u2019t believe your religion, I don\u2019t want to understand,\nbecause it -- 1t can\u2019t be a good god to do that. And I just turn my mind away from\nthat because I feel that I either want to cry or I want to scream about that. See, you\nweren\u2019t -- you weren't there, having it -- it ha -- all has to do with your\nbackground. Having gone through the Holocaust you have an entirely different\npolitical view about Israel, about the future. I do not believe that in 10 generation\nof Arab, they will change their mind about not wanting to put all the Jews in the\nsea. I think they\u2019ll remain exactly the same way. They want this little land with all\nthe oil, having oil and [indecipherable] all around. It\u2019s not logical, it\u2019s not\nreasonable, and it is emotionally very painful.",

        "A: Dancing in the street. That we all went downtown, we went to Times Square\nand every kind of celebration in private homes, and at the embassies all over. I\nhave one cousin who came over on a ship like the Exodus, saved from a\nMarch 7, 2003\nconcentration camp and was able to get away like that, became a male nurse in\nIsrael and -- because somebody told him that\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to get\nfood.

I said, I don\u2019t [indecipherable].\nAnyhow, she went over and she says, my girlfriend says you work in the same\noffice. Anyhow we started to talk, and then that\u2019s how we got started to go out\nMarch 7, 2003\ntogether. And one of the reasons our marriage works is he was born in Vienna, he\ncame in 1941 and I think that many of our backgrounds are very, very similar and\nwe don\u2019t have some of the difficulties that people of different philosophies have,\nand we have less disagreements on major issues on some of -- you know, on some\nof these things.",

        "A: When they were still in high school and we would discuss careers very often, I\nhad this notion that a lot of people, my friends, were being fired and I asked -- I\ntold them that the most important thing I think, after liking what you do, is not to\ndepend someone else for a job, but to -- to be able to hang up your shingle, you\nknow, I was thinking of law or medicine, something where you can be in business\nfor yourself. And not to depend on a man to support you. And you know, after\nawhile she said, well we know, we know that already, Ma, you don\u2019t want us -- 1-\nit\u2019s not -- not that I didn't want them to get married, I just didn't want them to\ndepend solely, because people in my generation, they did that. They were very\nunsuccessful.\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "Q: You were in this country during some very turbulent -- turbulent times, and you\nwere raising children in some very stressful times. I'd like you if you could to\nreflect on some of the events that you witnessed in this country, and let\u2019s -- let\u2019s\nstart with the Cold War, and perhaps even the Cuban missile crisis.",
        "A: Wa -- what\u2019s the last one you asked me? The co --",
        "Q: Cu-Cuban missile crisis.",
        "A: Oh, the Cuban missile crisis. The Cuban missile crisis was very -- my -- my\nhusband 1s a tremendous -- a historian by hobby, and wi -- and he -- he likes\nnothing else, and with the kids too, we talked all the time about politics. And the\nCuban missile crisis was very dangerous. Everybody felt that we were on the brink\nof something very, very serious happening and we would present our view and our\nfear of the insecurities and we -- we would let them talk. And even though it was\nan unlikely situation, they each knew that they had an opinion, you know, to -- to\ngive in terms of their political views, that of course Daddy was arch-conservative\nand they were arch-liberal, etcetera, etcetera, and I tell you, there was one -- my\nmiddle daughter was the most liberal one, she went on all the marches and the\nschool about wearing slacks when you weren\u2019t supposed to and she got expelled\nand he was really upset with her. And she overheard a conversation that my\nhusband and I had where he compared her to Patty Hearst, I don\u2019t know if you\nMarch 7, 2003\nremember it. And she overheard that conversation and she came in and she was\nvery upset. And I said to my husband, that was the wrong example, it was tha -- it\ntook us months and months for her -- for us to try to -- you know, she went on\nevery march, to Lincoln Memorial and everything, and -- a-and she was sick one\nday, I had to go on a march for her. But I felt that it was something very sincere in\nher and I did not feel it was bad. I don\u2019t think 1t was extreme and I was more\ntolerant of her, which made a good combination with my husband. He was not as\ntolerant, he just felt she was much too -- much, much too liberal about taking chan\n-- he was very upset when she got expelled for 24 hours about marching, about\nwearing pants, which is so stupid when you think about it. And she was the one\nthat really st -- was way out to the left among the three of them, and the other two\nwere more or less 1n the middle. But no matter what came up in politics, we\ndiscuss it at every dinner table, and after dinner and -- and we had a friend from\nNew York who came and visited at one dinner and he said, I would give my right\narm if my family would be willing to talk about politics so much. So my husband\nsaid, you know, it\u2019s -- they got so used to it because we talked about it like other\npeople talk about coffee and tea, we talk about what happens in politics, there\u2019s so\nmuch part of our daily living an-and he\u2019s very much into that, that I think the kids\nbecame part -- interested in that. And even now they talk on the telephone with\nMarch 7, 2003\nCalifornia [indecipherable] about anything that happens over there, my kids\nwant to talk to him about it.",
        "Q: How about the Civil Rights movement?",
        "A: The Civil Rights movement was a -- something that, again, 1t was some -- my --\nmy kids marched, all of them, at all ages. What was -- the one that was 12 and she\nwas marching in mothers against abor -- for abortion and -- and like that, and I\nsaid to her, do you know what it is that you\u2019re marching for? And you know, at 12\nshe explained to me very clearly, and I said to my husband, I -- I think it\u2019s\nwonderful that she is so knowledgeable and everything, but at 12 I would be\nhappier if she was playing with Barbie basically. There\u2019s such a long period that\nshe has to worry about this particular problem in our -- which will not go away,\nand a -- all that. But most of my -- my kids, my family were just -- partook in the\nmarches. I was less of a marcher. I was a marcher in philosophy, but not in act.\nBut they all marched.",
        "Q: But how did you, as a Holocaust survivor, see this civil -- Civil Rights issue?",
        "A: Well, I think it was very important for them to have the -- th-the -- our Civil\nRights were terrible. The conditions of blacks in this country was shocking to me\nwhen I -- I -- I -- first of all, I never saw a black person until I came here, so that\nwhole even visual concept was brand new to me. And there was no class like the\nMarch 7, 2003\nblack class in Europe, it was entirely different. But, you know, you\u2019re reading\nabout Jefferson and Sally ha -- y-you just can\u2019t believe the hypocrisy of the -- o-\nof all classes of people.",
        "Q: You made reference to one of your children marching. How -- how about the\nsex -- sexual revolution? You were raising daughters.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t -- how -- how do you define that? I don\u2019t remember going\nthrough that very much.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was, you know, they were very liberal from day one, and I-I -- as they were\ngrowing up, and I just thought that all the girls now were -- you know, certain\nthings existed.",
        "Q: On a more serious note, the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem.",
        "A: Well, I have to tell you. The museum had a speaker who caught Eichmann and\nhe was the most fabulous speaker, wa -- th-the guy that looked this short, and\nwhite hair, of course it looked very different, and the judge was here and they held\na [indecipherable] they -- they tel -- told the story how they caught him, which\nwas fabulous. Eichmann was especial painful to us because he was the chief\narchitect of the Hungarian Jews, and I think it was fabulous that after all those\nyears they were able to catch him and bring him back and bring him to trial. And\nMarch 7, 2003\nhe didn\u2019t deserve a trial like he got, he got a ver -- a very, very fair trial. And he\nshould have been burning in hell for a long time for what he did. I don\u2019t think that\nthe trials are equal to the crimes at all. That\u2019s again personal, I guess. You know,\nyou -- you can\u2019t --",
        "Q: How about the Korean War and the war in Vietnam?",
        "A: Well, I must say that I did not feel with the young people, I felt very much --\nwell, the Vietnamese war was a terrible mistake, I felt, because the French lost.\nThey were there for 25 years and they s -- couldn\u2019t do it and they said to us, don\u2019t\ngo in. And I felt that that was a very logical advice. How can you go in in an area\nwhere you don\u2019t know the terrain, you don\u2019t know anything about -- I think it was\na lost war before it started. And the Korean War, I must tell you I\u2019m not familiar\nenough to give a [indecipherable].",
        "Q: How about the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King,\nJunior?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t see how anybody can but feel very s -- deep sadness about that. I\nthink that Kennedy had the potential of bringing something very great to this\ncountry in terms of inspiring young people, and -- and the fact that so many\nassassinations happen shows this country is very gun -- although the -- Kennedy\nsaid no, you can\u2019t protect anybody. That\u2019s what he himself said. You can\u2019t protect\nMarch 7, 2003\na president a hundred percent. Nevertheless, no one has as many assassinations as\nwe do. And the role that guns play here is tremendous and it\u2019s very fearful and it\u2019s\nscary.",
        "Q: When your kids were growing up were you a stay at home mom, or did you\ncontinue to work?",
        "A: I -- I stayed at home because I noticed very early that when they came home\nfrom school they were ready to talk about certain things and at eight o\u2019clock they\nwere not. So I decided to quit my job, although they were willing to take me back\nto the Army Map Service cause there are so few Hungarian speaking people, on a\npart time basis, which at that point was in the 50\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t that common. And I\ndecided to stay home. And my -- my oldest daughter Debbie began to draw very\nnicely and she came home one day and she said, Mommy, the teacher said that the\nsun 1s here, th-th-the -- the house is here and the -- this -- the sun isn\u2019t always on\nthe right hand side. I tried to tell the teacher sometimes it\u2019s in the middle, when\nI\u2019m walking. Teacher didn\u2019t believe me. So I decided to study art at that point\nbecause I saw that my kid had something that that teacher never learned, a\nmethodology. And I liked to draw when I was a kid, and ev -- everything else.\nAnd I took a la -- a few art courses and then I studied with Jack [indecipherable]\nwho is a local Washington colorist. And I decided to go to st -- to teach art. Now,\nMarch 7, 2003\nat that point, art was not taught in every school, and they didn\u2019t have any art\nteachers. The only way they could hire me was through resource teacher job and I\n-- and they started me with [indecipherable], and places where they didn\u2019t even\nhave pencils. The school in [indecipherable]. And I started to teach art to children\nthat actually never even had a pencil to draw with, and they were just thrilled with\nit. And I devised a method and I started to teach kindergarten through sixth grade.\nI -- I liked that age because th -- in that kindergarten you can do a lot with -- take\nthem out and look at the trees and you show them the bark and feel the bark. And\nit was just my own ideas. And I began to teach un -- for -- until I retired, I guess,\nin 1968 and was in the school system, some -- in two or three schools, sometimes.\nBut in addition to that, I worked at Camp Louise. I don\u2019t know if you know where\nthat is. I was the head of their craft department, but then I wanted to introduce\nmore fine art. And I hired more counselors who did painting and drawing and\nsketching and things like that for the whole summer. And I did that for 25 years, I\nenjoyed that very much and I felt that children away from parents and not near a\nclassroom, were very receptive to -- to learning and self expression. And Louise\nhas 400 acres of -- of land and you could go under a tree and just all day, spend all\nday just looking at the way the grass looks at different places. So I was very\nsuccessful doing that, and I enjoyed it. And what I did is that I called every parent\nMarch 7, 2003\nthat I felt had a potential student, in the fall, to give them lessons. And I made that\na very strong point. I told the child that I will do that. And since then, which was\nabout 20 years ago, I meet kids in restaurants and different places where they\u2019ve\nsaid, oh you remember me? There was one kid the other day that says, do you\nknow I am one of the head designers at Bloomindales in their interior department\nand it was all because of what you taught me about symmetry and asymmetry. She\neven remembered what I was working with her. And I had -- I had a great time\nwith kids during the summer, with art and with -- it all started with my child and\nart. Now, out of my three children, they all love art and we all go to museums a\nlot. But one of my grandchildren paints very well [indecipherable]. We had some\nof her stuff framed. And a -- and art has worked through th -- my whole family\nthat way and -- and we\u2019re very happy tha -- doing it. And I just recently stopped\nbecause my arthritis does not permit me to paint [indecipherable]. But I\u2019m in --\nI\u2019m -- my -- my next best job is the museum. I love to work with the museum.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about your work with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum?",
        "A: Yes, I am in the education department and our primary thing is to take children,\nmiddle and high school age, those were the first ones, through the museum and\nthey are supposed to have some background, one of the teachers goes to these\nschools and gives them a few lessons. But 99 percent of them don\u2019t even know\nMarch 7, 2003\nwhat the word means. The first thing I ask them is do you know what the\nHolocaust is, and you can see on their faces, mm -- mm -- no. It\u2019s no use to go to\nthat museum, and I told this at every meeting to everybody, if they don\u2019t know the\nmeaning. If you don\u2019t know the word, you are wasting so much time because you\nare talking about something so abstract, and -- and you -- you know, you have to\nput these kids, some of them don\u2019t even know where Europe 1s, or -- or what is it\nthat we\u2019re trying to do. We are not giving them enough basics. But I worked on\nthat and I succeeded partially, and I am continuing on it that way. At first, as I\ntake, and we have about 12 to a group on a good day. On a bad day we have 50 -\n60, you define the Holocaust, you stand in the Hall of Witness and I try to teach\nthem something about the architecture because I think it\u2019s a very important part.\nYou know, if I only spend five minutes, there has to be something said about the\narchitecture. Then we go upstairs and then I try to go over and I explain to them\nwe don\u2019t have time for every picture. But as we walk along, if something appeals\nto you that I\u2019m not stopping, just stop me and I can stop again. The main thing 1s\nthat I try -- and I must confess to you that not everybody has this technique yet, to\nbe able to get down on the level that the majority of the group is on. To pick that\nup on their eyes, because they\u2019re too embarrassed to ask questions because they\nfeel that theyll appear dumb, okay? So you have to somehow, sometimes ask\nMarch 7, 2003\nquestions, but sometimes the questions are a waste of time because they don\u2019t\nknow the answers, but somehow or other feel and see of what level you have to\nbring. And that\u2019s what -- that\u2019s what I do. That\u2019s what I try to do and I think that\u2019s\nwhat I do well. And I -- and -- and now, a couple of months ago they started to do\nthe police. The police chief, Ramsey thought that all the police should go up, and\nthe CIA. And I -- having a choice I like the children better. Well, I think that\nsometimes the police [indecipherable] almost like entertain me. Without the word\nentertain, but like teach me. I -- I -- I know everything, kind of. That\u2019s what I see\non the face, you see, and it\u2019s not always there. The children then, have a book\nwhat they can write what their opinion is or what they want, or -- and I suggest to\nthe teachers to have them do two things. Write an essay about it and also draw. Art\nis a fabulous thing to draw wha -- about the things, about what they saw. And the\nmost -- most meaningful thing that was ca -- on -- in the book, was written by\nblack girls who said that up to now I only thought that my people suffered, and I\ndidn't want to hear about anybody else suffering. But going to this museum, it\nopened my eyes that there are other people who have suffered also, and I must\nlearn about their suffering. And I think that if we get one percent of this through to\none percent of the population, that we\u2019ve succeeded.",
        "Q: What are the ages of some of the children that you\u2019re referring to?\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "A: Middle school is -- and high school. And then we have some college and then\nwe have Hebrew school. The Hebrew school brings younger ones, cause they have\nsome preparation.",
        "Q: Like Bar and Bat Mitzvah age?",
        "A: Well, the -- the -- the Hebrew school teacher gives them some preparation and\nall that. And they have col -- college kids too, we have, and -- and there\u2019s a new\nthing that I do that I just -- before I was sick I was ate -- not able to join, which is\ncalled wrap up, which is -- you ask me what I do, I don\u2019t know whether you\nwanted to know about this part. It is -- you are given -- the group 1s given 28 or 30\nphotographs, and they are divided in 30 groups where they double up, depending\non how many there are, and they make a line and hold the photographs in\nsequential order. The photographs of the permanent exhibit. And they -- the whole\ngroup decides, well this happened before, this happened before and then they\nmake a line or a circle and then they discuss, do you think this pa -- photograph\nbelongs here or there? It\u2019s called wrap up. It is something that, if we have enough\ntime to do it, it has a very good review concept. And it was done by Tim Kaiser,\nwho is blind. I don\u2019t know if you know him, he\u2019s in the education department. We\nhave a person in the education department, can\u2019t see. But it\u2019s a very good tool.",
        "Q: Are you involved with any other Holocaust organizations or institutions?\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Have you ever been back to your hometown?",
        "A: Yes, three times. There -- there are no Jews there. I wanted to see the -- where I\nwas born and that apartment house is very similar, it looks similar than it -- than it\ndid. Then, there\u2019s a place where my fath -- 1-1t was square and my father had a\nstore there. But that was the Communist headquarters; at the time that I was there\nwas under Communism with red flags all over. And the third time my main thing,\nI was looking for the convent where I learned English, and that was totally grazed\nand they had something else on. And then I went into the cemetery because I had\nsome grandparents buried there, but th-the -- the stones were all gone\n[indecipherable] gone.",
        "Q: What years were -- were your trips to your hometown? What years? When did\nyou go?",
        "A: I\u2019m going to have to guess on that. Surely I was there -- let\u2019s see, Communism\nwas about \u201975 -- about \u201981 and maybe \u00b059 or 60. But under Communism we\nfound some relatives who, through some other people said that they can\u2019t write\nbecause that would be looked upon very poorly, having American relatives. And\nwe understood that, that -- we were just glad to see that they were alive, through\nsomebody, but not to correspond.\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "Q: So who in your family did survive the Holocaust?",
        "A: I have one cousin in -- in Israel, who is my age, who -- who -- who has\nsurvived as [indecipherable] one of the ships like the Exodus and then became a\nmale nurse. I have one cousin in -- in Hungary who survived Auschwitz. Do we\nhave time? What time is it? Oh. She came on the train in Auschwitz -- to\nAuschwitz, and she was -- she had a baby in her arm. And she was told on the line\nthat if you bi -- give the baby to your mother on the other line, they\u2019re not going to\nkill the mothers and children. And of course that went first. Train she was on\nstopped and there was some kind of trouble, she got out not in the front of the car,\nbut in the back door of the car and it said ktiche, and she spoke German. She went\ninto the kitchen, she put on a chef\u2019s hat and a chef\u2019s uniform and started to -- and a\n-- an officer came in and she said -- he said, are you a new cook? And he -- she\nsaid yes. And she survived Auschwitz being in -- the cook, for three years there,\nwithout any papers or anything like that. And she was -- she was -- had a hard time\nbecause she could steal food, like the milk cans, you see? She could mark cans\nspoiled and they took them away at night. Well, where do you send the milk cans?\nThere are 10,000 people in Auschwitz and the word got around that she sends the\nmilk cans here. And the people that saw her walking someplace would try beating\nher up. It was a very difficult position in this particular area of Auschwitz, to be\nMarch 7, 2003\nworking in the kitchen, and not be able -- be equal to 10,000 people in terms of\nwhat you can do extra. So even when she survived and went home, the people\ntried to stone her, oh it\u2019s a terrible thing. But she survived. She had a husband who\nwas a Hungarian Jewish officer and they -- the Germans put those in the front of\nthe Russian line so they should kill them. He was captured by the Russians, she\nhasn\u2019t heard for seven years, the rabbi said that you can get married. So she was\nmarrying his brother and two days before the wedding, he came home. And this 1s\nwhat -- what the -- for seven years he was in a Russian camp and he had a prayer\nbook that was one inches long, someplace hidden. And he was davening one night\nand a Russian soldier saw him and said, I\u2019m Jewish too, I\u2019ll get you enough food.\nSo he gave him enough soup to last that he survived the seven year. Then they\nwere sent home, about 20 of them from this camp, and they hit a warehouse. They\nbroke into a warehouse, it was a sugar warehouse, it had sacks of sugar. They cut\nthe sugar open, they started to eat the sugar and 95 percent of them died because\ntheir stomachs were this small, and my cousin\u2019s husband fainted after about the\nfifth -- and his luck was that he fainted and didn\u2019t eat. So then he walked back to\nwhere he was, which took another couple of days and he came in. So that\u2019s the\nsecond and the third survivor. I have another survivor in Czechoslovakia who was\nMarch 7, 2003\nin Auschwitz, and I don\u2019t know how she survived. And the rest, a few of them, are\nthe second cousins.",

        "A: I am an optimist and that\u2019s not a universal feeling among survivors or people\nthat are looking at the future today. I feel that my family survived and Judaism\nsurvived with them, and it\u2019s not going to disappear until there\u2019ll be two people,\nlike in Masada. I think that -- that Judaism will survive under all circumstances\nand I certainly, in my family will make sure that 1t does, and make it as palatable\nand as ag -- as agreeable to my family as I can.\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "Q: Is there anything that we haven\u2019t discussed that you\u2019d like to add before we\nconclude?",
        "A: No. I think that I -- \u2019ve said everything and I -- I repeat, I -- I don\u2019t have any\nsuffering to report, that -- any hardships like most people that have gone through,\nyou know, the concentration camps [indecipherable] pictures and the books, as\nmuch as I can read on it, is a horror to remember, you know. I\u2019m a diabetic and\nevery time I take a needle, do twice a day and it hurts, I think about all those\npeople in Auschwitz having no insulin and what they must have suffered, and the\npain disappears.",

Which everybody else thought was crazy, but it was a true fact.\nWe never would have seen. He said, I don\u2019t care if we -- how long we wait, we\nwait until we get a visa for everybody. And then that took, again, time, and we\nmight have to wait a long time. What made our passage possible, in 1939 August\n3\" which was the last American ship that left the harbor, was the fact that in 1938\nMarch 7, 2003\nHitler gave this part of Slovakia to Hungary.

When we were in Czechoslovakia the quota was\nthis long, very long. Then -- now all of a sudden we\u2019re Czech nationals and we are\nnow part of Hungary. Now, in the Hungarian embassy the Czech quota was very\nsmall, because there weren\u2019t that many Czech Nationals now in one year moved\nthere.

And everybody\nagain in the family thought my father was crazy, and he -- the only thing that\nhappened to him, he was taken to a labor camp, for eight months we didn\u2019t hear\nabout him. Then he came out of the labor camp, he got in touch with this\nemployee and he sold whatever he could and brought three tickets from LaHavre\nto New York, and three train tickets from Budapest to LaHavre.

When this happened that this ar -- little area -- Czechoslovakia was\nlike this, it was big here, then it was Moravia, and Slovakia got thinner and then\nit was Putka Pascaoush which went to Russia.

And I learned\nvery quickly on the bus with kids that were going from my neighborhood to high\nschool, and I picked up English pretty fast, it wasn\u2019t hard for me. I did very well in\nhigh school. I -- I was put in -- in th -- they used to have repor -- programs,\nhandwritten and a principal came in about two months in a class, in a Spanish\nclass and said to the teacher that Miss Reichman belongs to speech, this is an\nerror here, S-P, she should have been in speech instead of Spanish. And the\nteacher said, you can\u2019t take her away, she\u2019s my best student. So I stayed in\nMarch 7, 2003\nSpanish and I learned Spanish and I got in the honors program in that high school,\nJulia Richmond High School, which was associated with Hunter and Brooklyn\nCollege, and in re -- I -- I enjoyed high school very much because to me it was like\na new world, and I -- I guess when you excel in school so unexpectedly and make\nfriends -- there was only ra -- ba -- one bad experience in high school. There was\nmore than one, it sort of comes back. I-I\u2019m not doing this very sequentially, is that\nokay? Okay. My clothing was a problem, because that was a real sore thumb. I\nstood out at that point anyway, it was very different, the clothes, even though I had\nlovely clothes because my mother designed my clothes and she had all this\nfabulous material. When my parents came out they didn\u2019t speak English well at\nall, it was very difficult. And an uncle of mine died and left my father a thousand\ndollars, and my father decided to buy a business for a thousand dollars. So they\nbought a business, a rooming house for 19,000 dollars, a thousand down, and they\nrented rooms in this rooming house and we had an apartment on the ground floor.\nAnd in this -- and then there wasn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t make enough money or\nanything, it was somehow or other, somebody in the family advised that my\nmother should go with -- they should go to work as a couple for a year and put\nsome money away. My mother became a maid and my father became a butler\nsomeplace, and I stayed with this one uncle who sent us the affidavit. Now, my\nMarch 7, 2003\nfather was the type of person that he did not ever take a glass of water for himself.\nIf he wanted a glass of water he went to the restaurant, ordered a cup of coffee and\nthey gave him some water. He never did anything by himself. And he did this and\nhe -- they took this job, they worked 18 hours a day, the two of them. They made\n20 dollars or 25 dollars a month and when they had enough money with that\nthousand dollars, that\u2019s when they left and they bought this -- this rooming house.\nBut while I was -- while they were working as a maid and a butler, the daughter of\nthat family and I went to the same high school. And she got a gang together and\nshe -- they teased my clothes tremendously. And I had like two or three very\nunpleasant things about this particular clique that was just -- I now notice, I teach,\nhow much nicer children are to the Asian children and things like that. My\ngeneration it was the opposite, or anyhow in New York where I was. It may be\nbecause of where I lived, but they made absolutely my life miserable with my\nclothes and my accent, my a -- a -- at that point I was not yet excelling and I was\nvery, very unhappy and I didn\u2019t want to complain to my parents cause I knew they\nwere doing this, they had to work at what they were doing. And eventually, and I\ncan\u2019t think of time-wise except that maybe it was in two years, they got -- they\nbought this business and -- and then I was able to somehow or other make my own\nMarch 7, 2003\nfriends and I got on the honor roll at school, at this country school and things like\nthat and I got out of this circle of people who were teasing me.",
        "A: Well, I know that teenagers tend to be mean anyway, and they can do the things\nthat some of these girls were doing, but to me they were very specific. Number\none they said -- you know, they were -- made fun of the fact that my parents\nworked for her as a maid and a butler and that made me an inferior person. And\nthe second thing that they were cliquish about is my clothes and my accent. I had\nan accent when I came first. However, the beauty of all that was that I never did\nMarch 7, 2003\ntake speech and every English teacher, including my college English teacher\ndidn\u2019t believe that I wasn\u2019t born here, so somehow I overcame that.",
        "A: Terrified. I was born -- I was -- I lived all my life in this little town. I have -- I\nhave not seen a street light until I went visiting some f -- some relatives in\nHungary [indecipherable] we didn\u2019t even have street light. New York is\nterrifying, you know, the first time you just walk around 1n it. And I lived with an\naunt and an uncle who had no children, which didn\u2019t have -- didn\u2019t add to the\npoint that I wasn\u2019t handled properly in many times. You know, they just said\nhere\u2019s a quarter, go to the movies when I couldn\u2019t -- when I had, you know, when\nI had problems. Everything was very difficult. For instance, the food tasted --\ntasted soapy. I felt that the Coke tasted like they had mixed it with soap and I felt\nthat -- and my parents didn\u2019t, this was only me. I felt that a lot of the food was so\nstrange to my palate, and it all tasted of soap. And I\u2019m sure th -- I know that this\nwas psychological. And it appeared very, very difficult at that point because of all\nthe other problems with being a teenager and then you know, starting to go with\nboys -- not go with boys, but let\u2019s say if I was invited to a sweet 16 party I didn\u2019t\nMarch 7, 2003\nknow how to act. I -- I always said the wrong things and I did the wrong things\nand it took me a very long time to arise from this backward little girl, only child\nwho lived in a town who knew only the things that everybody else did of the same,\nyou know, socially we all did the same thing. I mean, nobody went to a dance\nwithout the other and it was a much closer knit group that I was with, and I had to\novercome that. And that was a very, very hard, for many years. But then, you\nknow, towards the end of high school I was -- I got more into it. I got into\nBrooklyn College, which -- a free school which was a big deal for me and I did\nnot want to go to Hunter. I could not stand the fact that Julia Richmond was four\nyears all girls. And I just said Ill travel anyplace to go with -- just see boys. And\nthen in Brooklyn College I excelled pretty well. And a German professor of mine\nsaid, would you like to apply for a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania?\nI said I don\u2019t want to because my parents can\u2019t afford it. They can\u2019t afford\nColumbia either, but they know I want to get a Masters and they said they\u2019Il take\nthe loan. And he said, just for fun, don\u2019t tell your parents. If it happens, it happens,\njust we\u2019re going to put you in for a full-time scholarship. You will -- anyhow, I got\nthis scholarship, which Brooklyn College was just thrilled, cause I was the first\ngirl -- you know, that used to be an all boys school -- the first girl and the first\nJewish girl, they combined two [indecipherable] got a full time scholarship to\nMarch 7, 2003\nColumbia for a year. Full Masters, food, this -- tuition and everything else. And at\nthat point my father knew how big this was, but he still said to me, you know, I\ncan get that money for Columbia and I would so much rather you went anyhow.\nY-You couldn\u2019t talk me out of 1t. My yi -- my mother worked [indecipherable]\nlook much better on my record if I go to Columbia -- I mean, to the University of\nPennsylvania. So I went to the University of Pennsylvania and that was a blast. I\nreally in -- it was a very difficult school. But first, in several classes when I raised\nmy hand, especially English or philosophy and I opened my mouth, the professor\nwould say, you\u2019re one of those that came from a city college [indecipherable].\nAnd my education just came through in many ways the professors saw that my\nbackground was very, very good and you know, we all, those of us who came\nfrom city colleges were very pleased with what we had as a background. And the\nuniversity [indecipherable] was very nice, it was a great school and I got my\nMasters there and I wanted to teach, and when I finished I couldn\u2019t find a job\nbecause the veterans were coming home and they got preference to all teaching\njob. That was in \u201947. So I have a friend who got a job in Washington, a\npsychologist working for the police department, and sh-she\u2019s my best friend\nactually, and she said to me, I\u2019ll find you a job. Anyhow, two days later she sent\nme a telegram, I got a interview for you in a place and she said, don\u2019t get scared of\nMarch 7, 2003\nthe name, it\u2019s called the Army Intelligence Map Service and they\u2019re looking for\npeople with languages. So she set up this interview and I came down and they\nwere very impressed with my degree, I have a Masters and they hired me on the\nbasis of my Hungarian language, nothing else, none of my other thing, but they\u2019re\nvery short on Hungarian. So I worked there in Map Service from \u201947. I met my\nhusband there, my -- and we got married in 1950. And I worked until 1952 when I\nhad my first child.",

        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t know when it was appropriate to kiss or not to kiss and they spin\nthe bottle and things like that that were totally Greek to me. And then when I\nwouldn\u2019t kiss anybody then I was made fun of. You know, this etiquette that you\ngrow up with as to how you act at a party is something that, you know, with time I\npicked up, but it took a long time, and nobody was nice enough or honest enough\nto show me how to, you know, how to do this slowly and properly, or fast and\nimproperly. It was like Greek to me because I was very little when I left.\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "A: The girls that were -- I found on the bus. You see, this girl that taunted me lived\nin the fancy section of Park Avenue, she was never on the bus and everything.\nBut they we -- I lived on the East Side and they -- then I saw a lot of the same\nkids on the bus and they were kind enough to talk to me and I talked to them and\nthen we met for coffee on Saturday or go to the movies. And they seemed to have\nbeen all in the neighborhood where I wa -- we had -- where I was living.",

And there were\nrumors coming around but we all called it rumors because we didn't want to\nbelieve it. The first time that the whole family and my circle knew about it is in\n\"45 when they started to show the films.",

We -- our parents sheltered us t-to an extent that\no -- I ma -- I now feel I would have understood if I had been told earlier.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Yeah, I -- I didn\u2019t want to bring up myself. I was raised in an\nOrthodox home [indecipherable] I became more Reformed, I would say, when\nwe came here and we be -- joined the Reform Temple and [indecipherable] like\nthat. But my mother had a kosher house. When the pictures about Germany came\nback, the skeletons and everything, and I saw my relatives in all those\nphotographs, I became an atheist, but a true atheist. I began to talk to God about\nthe fact that how could you let something like this happen. And any amount that I\nlistened to Elie Wiesel or anybody else that it wasn\u2019t God\u2019s fault, I felt that God\ncould have intervened. And as time went on I felt this was a very difficult life, to\nbe an atheist if you were not always an atheist. And I thought about that too and I\nfelt very guilty about the fact that I survived with my parents. Why? Wh -- I sa -- I\n-- in order for me to stop being an atheist I had to find out why I survived. I had to\nhave a mission to survive because so many great people died. And I found my\nmission, an-and it might be a true -- a fiction of my imagination but 1t worked for\nme, that when my first child was born and I looked at her and I said, I know why I\nsurvived, because I know that through her and my other children, Judaism will\ncontinue forever. And I took this very seriously and I have three wonderful Jewish\ndaughters, who believe very strongly. Who know everything about the Holocaust\nthere is to know, even more than I do sometimes I think. And who strongly I have,\nMarch 7, 2003\ny-you know, educated them 1n the fact that I ha -- believe that I am only surviving\nbecause to me, they will carry on Judaism. And I don\u2019t mean banging your head\nJudaism, I mean just Judaism philosophy, in principle and in -- as far as they want\nto carry it, religious. They were all Bar Mitzvahed and Bat Mitzvahed, my\nchildren, my grandchildren. I decided to take each one of them to Israel after they\nwere Bar Mitzvahed. When my oldest one became 13, Rabin was killed and we\ndecided it wasn\u2019t safe to go to Israel. So we went to France instead, it was a\nwonderful trip and ever since any of them become Bar Mitzvahed or Bat\nMitzvahed, they take a trip, but it has to be safe by me and her parents and Israel\nhas not yet been safe. One of my major dreams 1s that I take all of them to Israel\nfor a week, to [indecipherable] and I\u2019ve been there three or four times with my\nhusband. And I still have this dream of taking my very big family to Israel, but I\ndon\u2019t think that that\u2019s in the cards, and realistically I don\u2019t feel that politically it\u2019s\ngoing to happen, that it\u2019s safe.",

        "A: When they were still in high school and we would discuss careers very often, I\nhad this notion that a lot of people, my friends, were being fired and I asked -- I\ntold them that the most important thing I think, after liking what you do, is not to\ndepend someone else for a job, but to -- to be able to hang up your shingle, you\nknow, I was thinking of law or medicine, something where you can be in business\nfor yourself. And not to depend on a man to support you. And you know, after\nawhile she said, well we know, we know that already, Ma, you don\u2019t want us -- 1-\nit\u2019s not -- not that I didn't want them to get married, I just didn't want them to\ndepend solely, because people in my generation, they did that.

        "A: Oh, the Cuban missile crisis. The Cuban missile crisis was very -- my -- my\nhusband 1s a tremendous -- a historian by hobby, and wi -- and he -- he likes\nnothing else, and with the kids too, we talked all the time about politics. And the\nCuban missile crisis was very dangerous. Everybody felt that we were on the brink\nof something very, very serious happening and we would present our view and our\nfear of the insecurities and we -- we would let them talk. And even though it was\nan unlikely situation, they each knew that they had an opinion, you know, to -- to\ngive in terms of their political views, that of course Daddy was arch-conservative\nand they were arch-liberal, etcetera, etcetera, and I tell you, there was one -- my\nmiddle daughter was the most liberal one, she went on all the marches and the\nschool about wearing slacks when you weren\u2019t supposed to and she got expelled\nand he was really upset with her. And she overheard a conversation that my\nhusband and I had where he compared her to Patty Hearst, I don\u2019t know if you\nMarch 7, 2003\nremember it. And she overheard that conversation and she came in and she was\nvery upset. And I said to my husband, that was the wrong example, it was tha -- it\ntook us months and months for her -- for us to try to -- you know, she went on\nevery march, to Lincoln Memorial and everything, and -- a-and she was sick one\nday, I had to go on a march for her. But I felt that it was something very sincere in\nher and I did not feel it was bad. I don\u2019t think 1t was extreme and I was more\ntolerant of her, which made a good combination with my husband. He was not as\ntolerant, he just felt she was much too -- much, much too liberal about taking chan\n-- he was very upset when she got expelled for 24 hours about marching, about\nwearing pants, which is so stupid when you think about it. And she was the one\nthat really st -- was way out to the left among the three of them, and the other two\nwere more or less 1n the middle. But no matter what came up in politics, we\ndiscuss it at every dinner table, and after dinner and -- and we had a friend from\nNew York who came and visited at one dinner and he said, I would give my right\narm if my family would be willing to talk about politics so much. So my husband\nsaid, you know, it\u2019s -- they got so used to it because we talked about it like other\npeople talk about coffee and tea, we talk about what happens in politics, there\u2019s so\nmuch part of our daily living an-and he\u2019s very much into that, that I think the kids\nbecame part -- interested in that. And even now they talk on the telephone with\nMarch 7, 2003\nCalifornia [indecipherable] about anything that happens over there, my kids\nwant to talk to him about it.",
        "A: The Civil Rights movement was a -- something that, again, 1t was some -- my --\nmy kids marched, all of them, at all ages. What was -- the one that was 12 and she\nwas marching in mothers against abor -- for abortion and -- and like that, and I\nsaid to her, do you know what it is that you\u2019re marching for? And you know, at 12\nshe explained to me very clearly, and I said to my husband, I -- I think it\u2019s\nwonderful that she is so knowledgeable and everything, but at 12 I would be\nhappier if she was playing with Barbie basically. There\u2019s such a long period that\nshe has to worry about this particular problem in our -- which will not go away,\nand a -- all that. But most of my -- my kids, my family were just -- partook in the\nmarches. I was less of a marcher. I was a marcher in philosophy, but not in act.\nBut they all marched.",
        "A: Well, I think it was very important for them to have the -- th-the -- our Civil\nRights were terrible. The conditions of blacks in this country was shocking to me\nwhen I -- I -- I -- first of all, I never saw a black person until I came here, so that\nwhole even visual concept was brand new to me. And there was no class like the\nMarch 7, 2003\nblack class in Europe, it was entirely different.

Eichmann was especial painful to us because he was the chief\narchitect of the Hungarian Jews, and I think it was fabulous that after all those\nyears they were able to catch him and bring him back and bring him to trial. And\nMarch 7, 2003\nhe didn\u2019t deserve a trial like he got, he got a ver -- a very, very fair trial. And he\nshould have been burning in hell for a long time for what he did.

And I felt that that was a very logical advice. How can you go in in an area\nwhere you don\u2019t know the terrain, you don\u2019t know anything about -- I think it was\na lost war before it started. And the Korean War, I must tell you I\u2019m not familiar\nenough to give a [indecipherable].",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t see how anybody can but feel very s -- deep sadness about that. I\nthink that Kennedy had the potential of bringing something very great to this\ncountry in terms of inspiring young people, and -- and the fact that so many\nassassinations happen shows this country is very gun -- although the -- Kennedy\nsaid no, you can\u2019t protect anybody. That\u2019s what he himself said. You can\u2019t protect\nMarch 7, 2003\na president a hundred percent. Nevertheless, no one has as many assassinations as\nwe do. And the role that guns play here is tremendous and it\u2019s very fearful and it\u2019s\nscary.",
        "A: I -- I stayed at home because I noticed very early that when they came home\nfrom school they were ready to talk about certain things and at eight o\u2019clock they\nwere not. So I decided to quit my job, although they were willing to take me back\nto the Army Map Service cause there are so few Hungarian speaking people, on a\npart time basis, which at that point was in the 50\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t that common. And I\ndecided to stay home. And my -- my oldest daughter Debbie began to draw very\nnicely and she came home one day and she said, Mommy, the teacher said that the\nsun 1s here, th-th-the -- the house is here and the -- this -- the sun isn\u2019t always on\nthe right hand side. I tried to tell the teacher sometimes it\u2019s in the middle, when\nI\u2019m walking. Teacher didn\u2019t believe me. So I decided to study art at that point\nbecause I saw that my kid had something that that teacher never learned, a\nmethodology. And I liked to draw when I was a kid, and ev -- everything else.\nAnd I took a la -- a few art courses and then I studied with Jack [indecipherable]\nwho is a local Washington colorist. And I decided to go to st -- to teach art. Now,\nMarch 7, 2003\nat that point, art was not taught in every school, and they didn\u2019t have any art\nteachers. The only way they could hire me was through resource teacher job and I\n-- and they started me with [indecipherable], and places where they didn\u2019t even\nhave pencils. The school in [indecipherable]. And I started to teach art to children\nthat actually never even had a pencil to draw with, and they were just thrilled with\nit. And I devised a method and I started to teach kindergarten through sixth grade.\nI -- I liked that age because th -- in that kindergarten you can do a lot with -- take\nthem out and look at the trees and you show them the bark and feel the bark. And\nit was just my own ideas. And I began to teach un -- for -- until I retired, I guess,\nin 1968 and was in the school system, some -- in two or three schools, sometimes.\nBut in addition to that, I worked at Camp Louise. I don\u2019t know if you know where\nthat is. I was the head of their craft department, but then I wanted to introduce\nmore fine art. And I hired more counselors who did painting and drawing and\nsketching and things like that for the whole summer. And I did that for 25 years, I\nenjoyed that very much and I felt that children away from parents and not near a\nclassroom, were very receptive to -- to learning and self expression. And Louise\nhas 400 acres of -- of land and you could go under a tree and just all day, spend all\nday just looking at the way the grass looks at different places. So I was very\nsuccessful doing that, and I enjoyed it. And what I did is that I called every parent\nMarch 7, 2003\nthat I felt had a potential student, in the fall, to give them lessons. And I made that\na very strong point. I told the child that I will do that. And since then, which was\nabout 20 years ago, I meet kids in restaurants and different places where they\u2019ve\nsaid, oh you remember me? There was one kid the other day that says, do you\nknow I am one of the head designers at Bloomindales in their interior department\nand it was all because of what you taught me about symmetry and asymmetry. She\neven remembered what I was working with her. And I had -- I had a great time\nwith kids during the summer, with art and with -- it all started with my child and\nart. Now, out of my three children, they all love art and we all go to museums a\nlot. But one of my grandchildren paints very well [indecipherable]. We had some\nof her stuff framed. And a -- and art has worked through th -- my whole family\nthat way and -- and we\u2019re very happy tha -- doing it. And I just recently stopped\nbecause my arthritis does not permit me to paint [indecipherable]. But I\u2019m in --\nI\u2019m -- my -- my next best job is the museum. I love to work with the museum.",
        "A: Yes, I am in the education department and our primary thing is to take children,\nmiddle and high school age, those were the first ones, through the museum and\nthey are supposed to have some background, one of the teachers goes to these\nschools and gives them a few lessons. But 99 percent of them don\u2019t even know\nMarch 7, 2003\nwhat the word means. The first thing I ask them is do you know what the\nHolocaust is, and you can see on their faces, mm -- mm -- no. It\u2019s no use to go to\nthat museum, and I told this at every meeting to everybody, if they don\u2019t know the\nmeaning. If you don\u2019t know the word, you are wasting so much time because you\nare talking about something so abstract, and -- and you -- you know, you have to\nput these kids, some of them don\u2019t even know where Europe 1s, or -- or what is it\nthat we\u2019re trying to do. We are not giving them enough basics. But I worked on\nthat and I succeeded partially, and I am continuing on it that way. At first, as I\ntake, and we have about 12 to a group on a good day. On a bad day we have 50 -\n60, you define the Holocaust, you stand in the Hall of Witness and I try to teach\nthem something about the architecture because I think it\u2019s a very important part.\nYou know, if I only spend five minutes, there has to be something said about the\narchitecture. Then we go upstairs and then I try to go over and I explain to them\nwe don\u2019t have time for every picture. But as we walk along, if something appeals\nto you that I\u2019m not stopping, just stop me and I can stop again. The main thing 1s\nthat I try -- and I must confess to you that not everybody has this technique yet, to\nbe able to get down on the level that the majority of the group is on. To pick that\nup on their eyes, because they\u2019re too embarrassed to ask questions because they\nfeel that theyll appear dumb, okay? So you have to somehow, sometimes ask\nMarch 7, 2003\nquestions, but sometimes the questions are a waste of time because they don\u2019t\nknow the answers, but somehow or other feel and see of what level you have to\nbring. And that\u2019s what -- that\u2019s what I do. That\u2019s what I try to do and I think that\u2019s\nwhat I do well. And I -- and -- and now, a couple of months ago they started to do\nthe police. The police chief, Ramsey thought that all the police should go up, and\nthe CIA. And I -- having a choice I like the children better. Well, I think that\nsometimes the police [indecipherable] almost like entertain me. Without the word\nentertain, but like teach me. I -- I -- I know everything, kind of. That\u2019s what I see\non the face, you see, and it\u2019s not always there. The children then, have a book\nwhat they can write what their opinion is or what they want, or -- and I suggest to\nthe teachers to have them do two things. Write an essay about it and also draw. Art\nis a fabulous thing to draw wha -- about the things, about what they saw. And the\nmost -- most meaningful thing that was ca -- on -- in the book, was written by\nblack girls who said that up to now I only thought that my people suffered, and I\ndidn't want to hear about anybody else suffering. But going to this museum, it\nopened my eyes that there are other people who have suffered also, and I must\nlearn about their suffering. And I think that if we get one percent of this through to\none percent of the population, that we\u2019ve succeeded.\nMarch 7, 2003",

        "A: Well, the -- the -- the Hebrew school teacher gives them some preparation and\nall that. And they have col -- college kids too, we have, and -- and there\u2019s a new\nthing that I do that I just -- before I was sick I was ate -- not able to join, which is\ncalled wrap up, which is -- you ask me what I do, I don\u2019t know whether you\nwanted to know about this part. It is -- you are given -- the group 1s given 28 or 30\nphotographs, and they are divided in 30 groups where they double up, depending\non how many there are, and they make a line and hold the photographs in\nsequential order. The photographs of the permanent exhibit. And they -- the whole\ngroup decides, well this happened before, this happened before and then they\nmake a line or a circle and then they discuss, do you think this pa -- photograph\nbelongs here or there? It\u2019s called wrap up. It is something that, if we have enough\ntime to do it, it has a very good review concept. And it was done by Tim Kaiser,\nwho is blind. I don\u2019t know if you know him, he\u2019s in the education department. We\nhave a person in the education department, can\u2019t see. But it\u2019s a very good tool.\nMarch 7, 2003",

        "A: Yes, three times. There -- there are no Jews there. I wanted to see the -- where I\nwas born and that apartment house is very similar, it looks similar than it -- than it\ndid. Then, there\u2019s a place where my fath -- 1-1t was square and my father had a\nstore there. But that was the Communist headquarters; at the time that I was there\nwas under Communism with red flags all over. And the third time my main thing,\nI was looking for the convent where I learned English, and that was totally grazed\nand they had something else on. And then I went into the cemetery because I had\nsome grandparents buried there, but th-the -- the stones were all gone\n[indecipherable] gone.",
        "A: I\u2019m going to have to guess on that. Surely I was there -- let\u2019s see, Communism\nwas about \u201975 -- about \u201981 and maybe \u00b059 or 60. But under Communism we\nfound some relatives who, through some other people said that they can\u2019t write\nbecause that would be looked upon very poorly, having American relatives. And\nwe understood that, that -- we were just glad to see that they were alive, through\nsomebody, but not to correspond.\nMarch 7, 2003",
        "A: I have one cousin in -- in Israel, who is my age, who -- who -- who has\nsurvived as [indecipherable] one of the ships like the Exodus and then became a\nmale nurse. I have one cousin in -- in Hungary who survived Auschwitz. Do we\nhave time? What time is it? Oh. She came on the train in Auschwitz -- to\nAuschwitz, and she was -- she had a baby in her arm. And she was told on the line\nthat if you bi -- give the baby to your mother on the other line, they\u2019re not going to\nkill the mothers and children. And of course that went first. Train she was on\nstopped and there was some kind of trouble, she got out not in the front of the car,\nbut in the back door of the car and it said ktiche, and she spoke German. She went\ninto the kitchen, she put on a chef\u2019s hat and a chef\u2019s uniform and started to -- and a\n-- an officer came in and she said -- he said, are you a new cook? And he -- she\nsaid yes. And she survived Auschwitz being in -- the cook, for three years there,\nwithout any papers or anything like that. And she was -- she was -- had a hard time\nbecause she could steal food, like the milk cans, you see? She could mark cans\nspoiled and they took them away at night. Well, where do you send the milk cans?\nThere are 10,000 people in Auschwitz and the word got around that she sends the\nmilk cans here. And the people that saw her walking someplace would try beating\nher up. It was a very difficult position in this particular area of Auschwitz, to be\nMarch 7, 2003\nworking in the kitchen, and not be able -- be equal to 10,000 people in terms of\nwhat you can do extra. So even when she survived and went home, the people\ntried to stone her, oh it\u2019s a terrible thing. But she survived. She had a husband who\nwas a Hungarian Jewish officer and they -- the Germans put those in the front of\nthe Russian line so they should kill them. He was captured by the Russians, she\nhasn\u2019t heard for seven years, the rabbi said that you can get married. So she was\nmarrying his brother and two days before the wedding, he came home. And this 1s\nwhat -- what the -- for seven years he was in a Russian camp and he had a prayer\nbook that was one inches long, someplace hidden. And he was davening one night\nand a Russian soldier saw him and said, I\u2019m Jewish too, I\u2019ll get you enough food.\nSo he gave him enough soup to last that he survived the seven year. Then they\nwere sent home, about 20 of them from this camp, and they hit a warehouse. They\nbroke into a warehouse, it was a sugar warehouse, it had sacks of sugar. They cut\nthe sugar open, they started to eat the sugar and 95 percent of them died because\ntheir stomachs were this small, and my cousin\u2019s husband fainted after about the\nfifth -- and his luck was that he fainted and didn\u2019t eat. So then he walked back to\nwhere he was, which took another couple of days and he came in. So that\u2019s the\nsecond and the third survivor. I have another survivor in Czechoslovakia who was\nMarch 7, 2003\nin Auschwitz, and I don\u2019t know how she survived. And the rest, a few of them, are\nthe second cousins.",
