        "A: I don\u2019t remember when he left.",
        "A: Yes, Ido. But, we were living with my grandparents at that time, and an aunt, and an\nuncle, and some cousins. All I know it was a big house and we all shared it.",
        "A: All I know is I was sick as a dog.",
        "A: I was less than four years old when we came to Cuban.",
        "A: Not too much except for a little bit of clothing just to wear, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Nothing. We couldn\u2019t bring nothing.",
        "A: No because we didn\u2019t have that much that \u2014 that we said we really needed it.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember them talking about it. They never really want to disturb the kids\nbecause they knew it was a tragic thing.",
        "A: Leaving my grandparents -- about leaving my grandparents.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know what to find, or what we would find. We were hoping for a better\nlife.",
        "A: No - really didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Well, all I know is we arrived in Cuba and we didn\u2019t know the language \u2014 couldn\u2019t\nspeak or anything.",
        "A: Yeah, my first \u2014 my worst memories was I was run over by a bus.",
        "A: I was run over by a bus. There was a boy that had some kind of a sickness that if he\ntouched you, you caught that sickness. So, not knowing the language, I knew the boy, and\nhe came \u2014 he tried to touch me and I turned around to run away from him and a bus hit\nme. And over there, they didn\u2019t call for an ambulance or anything, so they called my\nfather and he picked me up. We live near the emergency hospital and he took me to the\nemergency hospital. And the bus ran me over on my groin, on the \u2014 on my right side, and\n35 years later, I experienced problems on my right hand, and the doctors here said that it\ncame from that -- that he could show up many, many years later.",
        "A: No, except trying to learn the language and going to school. We use to go to a private\nschool there.",
        "A: Well, we really didn\u2019t know what to expect, and we were not the only ones from there\nthat came to Cuba with the same idea as we did.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know what we were going to expect, except we were hoping for a better life\nand to have more than what we had in Poland.",
        "A: Well, we were going to a private school, and because of Yiddish _ and they \u2014 my\nparents tried to do the best possible. We lived in a small town outside of Havana, so they\nJews but they tried to bring us up with as much Jewish education as possible.",
        "A: Regla , R-E-G-L-A. It\u2019s like saying from here, Silver Spring out of Washington.",
        "A: Those were other kids from the area that lived in the same town, but I wouldn\u2019t\nremember any names or anything.",
        "A: Yes, there were, many of them, also with the same idea in mind.",
        "A: We studied Language, History, Spelling, Math, and till this day, I still count in\nSpanish when I\u2019m figuring out numbers.",
        "A: He made children\u2019s shoes. Him and his youngest father \u2014 his youngest brother were\nin the business together and my mother use to help out.",
        "A: It was very hard because we couldn\u2019t live the same way as we did, and as far as \u2014 if\nyou didn\u2019t care for cars you were alright, but cars was \u2014 that was a little bit of a problem.",
        "A: They had to go shopping a few days a week into Havana to be able to get some kosher\nfood and the only thing we were able to get near the house was like bread or butter, but\notherwise if we had to \u2014 need any meats or anything, we had to go to Havana because\nthere was no refrigeration. It was an icebox and there was no way to keep anything.",
        "A: There was a problem adjusting because it was also that we knew we were not liked\nthere, though some of the neighbors were nice, but we were not liked as Jews, and we\nwere also not secure there. So we knew it was also temporary stay \u2014 hoping that sooner\nthan later we would be able to come to this country.",
        "A: Yes, we did, because of the way they use to talk to us, especially as children, and kids\nhere at home \u2014 about Jewish kids \u2014 so they use to come home and express it to us and we\ntried to get away from them, not even to answer them.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t \u2014 I remember some things that we tried to get away from them \u2014 not to\nanswer them, but the actual things that they said, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: We got some \u2014 we had private teachers to give as much Jewish education as possible.",
        "A: Absolutely. As long as possible, they did. When my grandmothers passed away, the\nrest of the family got killed in the war.",
        "A: All I remember is that they use to say they didn\u2019t know how much longer they would\nbe here and they starting to run, and they don\u2019t know how long it would last.",
        "A: Yes I do hear \u2014 I do remember that, but they never \u2014 they never told the kids how bad\nit was. We use to hear \u201cit\u2019s bad\u201d {Polish spoken}, but that\u2019s all.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yiddish. Again, I\u2019m use to answering Yiddish, and my parents would speak Polish,\nsome Russian because the town we came from was \u2014 it was Poland and it was White\nRussia, and then it was Poland again.",
        "A: Well, we knew that they were being killed and they were chased from town to town or\nhow they would hide from house to house, but that\u2019s all I can remember",
        "A: We weren\u2019t told too much about it, because we were in a Catholic country, and they\ndidn\u2019t talk too much about it. Especially, they were afraid the Jewish kids would pick up\ntoo much.",
        "A: I truthfully don\u2019t remember. Maybe there\u2019s a lot that I blocked out.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. There was always \u2014 there was always a Yiddish paper in the house, because\nthat\u2019s what my parents read and the radio use to always be on and they use to try and pick\nup the Yiddish stations there to hear what\u2019s going on with the war and everything",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "A: We had just a couple of friends, not too many because they were \u2014 a lot of them were\n___, and my parents always wanted us to have Jewish friends, even though some of them\nwere very nice. But, still we wanted to associate with Jewish kids.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: They came \u2014 a lot of them came from our home town and they came to Cuba with the\nsame idea. Now, some of them, when they were able to let their kids come to the States,\nthey sent them back themselves. My parents didn\u2019t want to send us by ourselves. Then if\nwe can\u2019t go, then none of us",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: It was a big day. It was in April of *45.",
        "A: The war was over in May of \u201945, and not only was that a big day, but my uncle that\ntook us to Cuba, and my brother, got married that day.",
        "A: It was a happy day, because we all could see a change 1n everybody that it was over,\nand hopefully be a better time.",
        "A: It was the early 40\u2019s and after that they didn\u2019t hear much at all.",
        "A: Well, they knew they didn\u2019t want us kids dead, because not only did they hear it, they\nread it in the papers, but whatever they heard from the family writing, they knew.",
        "A: They tried to write to different families that they had in different places in the world,\nand nobody was able to find anybody.",
        "A: It was after the war and I was already a little bit older, then we really started realizing\nwhat was happening, and about killing the Jews and about how we actually struggled on\nwhat they did to us and that\u2019s why we were persecuted running from place to place, and\nwe just couldn\u2019t wait to be able to come to this country. Hopefully it would have been a\nbetter life than what we had in Cuba.",
        "A: Not that much, no, because we were persecuted there, too. We knew that it was a\nCatholic country, and they didn\u2019t like us much. There were a few neighbors that were\nnice, but in majority of them, we knew that we were there temporarily. It was either there\nor someplace else if we couldn\u2019t come to this country.",
        "A: No, we really never did anything, except going to visit some land slide in Havana.\nBut, otherwise, we didn\u2019t do \u2014 didn\u2019t go on vacations because we couldn\u2019t afford it, but it\nwas to go out and visit some land slide.",
        "A: The only thing we were able to take out was some clothing. We had to \u2014 whatever\nelse we had, we had to leave behind.",
        "A: Yes, I do have some pictures. My parents, my grandparents, but otherwise I have a\nfew small items that my mother had taken out, smuggled out really, but nothing say big\nthat we could hold on to.",
        "A: To have it much better. To work ourselves and have a good life and an education.",
        "A: It was entirely different. It was like \u2014 your eyes opened up when we came to this\ncountry. It was in Miami. We came for \u2014 it wasn\u2019t cold, but it wasn\u2019t warm in Cuba then\nat that time in January. We got to Miami, it was summer time, so it was some \u2014 it just\nopened up our eyes. And then again, we stayed in Miami, my father came to New York to\ntry and find a job, and then we came to New York.",
        "A: New York was very nice. It was a big city, a lot to see, a lot to learn, and we were still\nnot too familiar with the language, so it was a little struggle, but we made it.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yes, we did, that we were very watching, because we were always hoping that one\nplace or another that\u2019s where we would go, and my uncle couldn\u2019t take us to Palestine, so\nCuba \u2014 I mean, United States was the destination. Then when the war was over we\nfigured if not Cuba maybe Palestine.",
        "A: Well, it was education, working to try and make it better and both of my parents were\nworking here, and that was the strive.",
        "A: Well, I graduated High school, I went to college. I wanted to become a CPA, but after\ntwo years, I got married, and that was the end of my education; but did my best for my\nchildren.",
        "A: I met my husband on the boardwalk in Atlantic City.",
        "A: Isaac Gendelmen",
        "A: In 1953, summer of \u201953 and we were married *54, June 27, 1954.",
        "A: My husband 1s a survivor of the Holocaust. He came here in January of \u201949. He\u2019s\nfrom rocitna, Poland, which is closer to the Ukraine border.",
        "A: When I got married \u2014 my husband lived here in Washington. When I got married I\ncame to Washington. We lived in Washington for 8 years. Then we moved to this house,\nso we are here 35 years.",
        "A: Two children. My daughter is 42 years old, and I have two grandchildren from her, 16\nand 13. My son is 37, almost 38, and he\u2019s got a daughter of four, and a son of two.",
        "A: I worked as a bookkeeper in New York, and then here in Washington, I worked for a\nneighbor of ours, as a hostess, and I was doing volunteer work. Then, I worked at the\nHebrew Academy with the lunch program for over 10 years, plus doing other\nvolunteering work in different places. And, now I\u2019m volunteering for the U.S Holocaust\nMemorial Museum.",
        "A: I am at the donor desk, trying to collect money for the upkeep of the museum.",
        "A: Because it is something that should be perpetuated, and for many people to remember\nthat \u2014 that it 1s not just a hoax. It is a true thing that happened.",
        "A: Well, talking to some people, you bring up some ideas and you remember some\nthings, and it broadens your \u2014 your way of life. It 1s a thing that I enjoy. It\u2019s sad, but I\nenjoy it.",
        "A: They just can\u2019t imagine that because they think how is it possible that you can go from\none \u2014 flew from one country to another and still make it here, and look the way that you\ndo.",
        "A: I have gotten a lot of pleasure from doing what I am doing, because it 1s a thing that\nwe have to do.",
        "A: Well, what to hear from people that come down. Some of them cannot real -- cannot\nvisualize that those things that they see upstairs actually happened. And that one person\ncan do so much trouble for the whole world.",
        "A: Well, there are many of them from reactions from people and children. But, right\nnow, I cannot bring 1t up in my mind exactly what had been said. Now, there was a\nnumber of Negro children that they just come down \u2014 they just cannot imagine that there\nwere white people that were persecuted. They thought they were the only ones, and they\njust cannot realize it.",
        "A: Very little, actually. We never gave \u2014 I guess, maybe we didn\u2019t give people a chance\nto really show us. But, so far it\u2019s been so good, as they say.",
        "A: If lam asked, I do. I don\u2019t go and say this 1s what I\u2019m going to tell you, but if I\u2019m\nasked, I do.",
        "A: Private people that asked me, \u201cWhy am I here, you get an accent,\u201d and they not \u2014 I tell\nthem.",
        "A: Well, by the grace of God we missed it, and we are alive today. Otherwise, we might\nnot had a made it either just like the other -- the rest of the six million Jews that got\nkilled. So, it was a wonderful thing that we left. We struggled in Cuba, but it was\nwonderful. It paid off.",
        "A: Well, I wanna say my father died 32 years ago. My mother died 15 years ago in New\nYork. And my sister lives in New York with her husband and she\u2019s got three sons, all\nmarried. And she\u2019s got three grandchildren, and another one on the way.",
        "A: Never did, because I wouldn\u2019t recognize anything, and there\u2019s probably nothing there\nto recognize, hearing from people that have gone back. Now, I have a few landslides\nhere, went back several years ago, and their much older than me \u2014 well, when I say much\nolder, I mean 15 years older, and they couldn\u2019t recognize anything. They left like a year\nor two before me, and they couldn\u2019t recognize it, so I definitely wouldn\u2019t",
        "A: Absolutely",
        "A: Well, we tried to bring them up for them to know what went on in the war, and to be\nopen about it, and to be strong.",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "A: Both of my children have been there, and both my older grandchildren have been\nthere, too. And, I took them one time when I was working there, and I let them go by\nthemselves through Daniel\u2019s story and upstairs a little bit, and they\u2019re talking about going\nback, and I'll take them back.",
        "A: Well, they were very surprised, but they realized it was very tough, and they are glad\nthat they are here and didn\u2019t go through it, and they are stronger people.",
        "A: We are \u2014 we are glad we are in this country, it\u2019s a wonderful country and so for its\ngood and we haven\u2019t seen too much anti-Semitism. We hear about it, but we, ourselves,\nhaven\u2019t gotten it \u2014 I can\u2019t think of the word I want to use, but haven\u2019t come across it, and\nhopefully we won\u2019t and my grandchildren won\u2019t either.",
        "A: If they ask me, if they come over to the desk, and they ask me, I do speak to them,\nchildren or grownups, I do, if they ask me questions, but I don\u2019t approach them, unless\nthey come over to our desk.",
        "A: Well, as far as Cuba, it was a beautiful country, but we knew that we were never\nsecure over there. It was a temporary, it was a stop off and it ended up being 11 years\nover there, and we really couldn\u2019t wait for the day to live, hopefully that 1t would of been\na better life in United States, because we didn\u2019t know what to expect.\n"
