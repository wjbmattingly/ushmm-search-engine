        "Q: Tell me your... Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: My name 1s Morris Kornberg. I was born in January 6, 1918--in Przedborz, Poland.",
        "Q: Tell me about your family.",
        "A: Um, I had then my parents, they have been...uh...in business. I had...uh...four brothers, and\ntwo sisters. I was the youngest. My eldest brother took over the business from my parents.\nAs far as I remember, this was in 1938. And we have been connected all the time\nwith...uh...different kind business. Mostly business...my brother used to supply the factories\nraw material, and so forth...so forth. My oldest sister was married. She had three kids; two\nboys, one girl. The oldest girl--was at this time in '39--she was 8 years old. Then the other\ntwo boys must have been 5 and 3. And then I had one brother who left Poland in 1933. He\nwent to Israel from a kibbutz. Then was another sister. She was still single. Then I had\nanother brother. And I was the youngest in all.",
        "Q: Tell me about your childhood, with your brothers and sisters.",
        "A: As far as I remember of my childhood, I used... My parents were strictly Orthodox people;\nbut we have been four brothers at home. 'Til about 14, 15 years old, we all attended Jewish\nschools and never went even to a public schools; because our parents had been so religious.\nThey always sent us to Jewish schools. Private...actually, a teacher--a private teacher. A\nRabbi, more or less. And we took also, beside...uh... languages--like Polish, or other modern\nlanguages. What I studied was only private...private. And as I remember, when I was 15\nyears old; and then the parents let us more or less do it our own way. We didn't go anymore\nwith...uh...my father, like we used to every Sabbos [NB: Shabbat] to the shtievel | Yiddish:\n\"house\" (of worship?)], und so weiter [Yiddish or German: \"and so forth\"]. But...uh,\nwe...we have been allowed more or less to go our own way, in some degree. But we always\nhave been understanding..., we tried to be good kids. Not to embarrass...uh... So I belonged\nto...uh...Jewish organization. It actually a...a sport...um, like a sports organization; but it was\na religious sport organization. I used to help around at home, with business. It was assigned\nto do...uh...all, uh...different things, whatever; I always helped around. Whatever they asked\nme, I always did, so forth. And in the evening, we used to spend in the Zionist Organization,\nwhere we...we...we learned Hebrew and once a week we had some dancing, and so forth.\nMore modern life. This went on, more or less, all my years; 'til actually the German, when\nthey came in 1939. I think it was the first of...uh...September. The first day when they came\nin, right away the whole town run away. Because we had been afraid, actually, of Germans;\nand we went to the woods. And we had been for two, three days in the woods all around.\nAnd the time come, we went back home. This...the town, the little town, was about 70\npercent was burned out; but our house was still standing. The business, everything, was still\nlike normal. We tried to adjust ourselves to a normal life. As I can remember, right away\nfrom the beginning...uh...was like a...a law. The German called a \"Kommissar\"--who was in\ncharge of the little town--called us over; and he said that we all, from 13...age from 13 'til 50,\nwill have to perform labor. Every day, we have to go to the...to do some work. So we used to\ngo to the...the Jewish Kultursgemeinde. Over there, we have been assigned; like mostly\ncleaning, taking away old brick, cleaning up areas. Didn't make any different. But in the\nevening, we have been allowed to go back at home. Later on, they assigned me--mostly in\nmine age, from the city--to a Steinbruch [NB: \"quarry\"] We used to mine stones; those\nstones have been for the...for the roads. They built new road, and so those stones went to the\nroads. And so this was pretty heavy work, everything. But still, I was pretty young and\nhealthy, and I got adjusted. And I...and I did my work. I have the two other brothers--\nbecause he was always in business. And at this time, the German government...they\nneeded...base...steel basement materials--steel. My oldest brother was always 1n contact with\nbig manufacturer, Jewish people, who used to have supply from all kinds steel metal. And if\nhe supplied so many pounds--I don't....cannot recall the amount--you...you got a gr\u00e9ne binde\n[NB: \"green band\"]. Start to wear the white and blue armband, so you got a green band. A\ngreen band meant that you could go outside the ghetto. You could travel. You could use the\ntrains. And you have...you have been restricted, but you still had a little bit freedom. So then\nmy oldest brother saw that my youngest--uh, my older brother from me, the second brother--\nhad a grone binde, too. So we didn't have to go to work every day, like the steinbruch, and do\nall public kind of works. And happened to be...our parents, they had a factory with a partner,\nwith a gentile people. Poles. In the beginning, we didn't even wanted to go down to the\nfactory; because it was everything under his name, more or less. We didn't want it to\nknow...the Germans know that this our property, half was our property of the factory.\nBecause we know it if it is Jewish property, was confiscated. But the owner from the\nprop...from the partner from the factory, our partner the owner was arrested in 1940. This\nwas with the first Polish intelligent[sia] what they took away. They arrested him. Two weeks\nlater, came a notice that he did not survive. The clothing came back home, and he was not\nalive anymore. And the factory was not running right with nobody to manage, so forth. So\nmy brother, through...he had some friends who had contact with the Gestapo. And for\nmoney, they could make it that it's not for myself to go to every day to work for Zwangs\n[NB: \"compulsory\"] labor to be assigned... to have my assignment; my labor should be to the\nfactory. We lived already in a ghetto. The factory was on the other side in the town, also out\nthe ghetto. So I got a I.D. card from Gestapo, that I can go..cross every day to the factory.\nCross ...I go outside the ghetto, and be over there. We came... So I were came to the factory.\nMy brother used to supply raw materials, because you couldn't get it at this time raw\nmaterials from the German. You have to have a special permission, actually. But my brother\nhad connection; and we could produce again knives, spoons, forks...whatever we\nmanufactured over there. But it was a problem that the...same way, labor. You couldn't pay a\nlabor[er] more than the price from before the war prices, more or less. And nobody wanted\nto work, because everything was already like black market. Except what you got your\nrations. Right away, Jewish people never got any rations. So the problem was that nobody\nwanted to work. Then my brother told me to try to tell those people who used to work in the\nfactory that we will pay them 2, 3 times as much [as] whatever is allowed by the law. And he\nwill be able to sell the merchandise to some friends, who had Jewish people stores; what he\ncould given them a bill and he will actually get paid three times as much, too, for the\nmerchandise. This went on...and I used to be always in the factory, and this went on for quite\na long time. Apparently, over a year. It happened to be that one of the workers in the factory,\nhe was some dissatisfied--not with me, but with the ...with the lady from our partner. And he\nwent...he went to the Gestapo; and he said that the whole factory belongs, actually, to us.\nThe factory belongs to us. Whatever we used manufactoring, we had been always afraid that\nsomething can happen this week, or next week or [the] next week. We used to carry away\nfinished merchandise; and it was over there he used to carry the finished material to the\nrailroads. So he lived 1n our village. He had a barn where he used to carry finished\nmerchandise to his barn, too. Well, one day, I remember...it must have been like the middle\nof August. I cannot recall exactly, but...uh...more or less in August. It was on a Saturday.\nAnd I was trying in...at home they told me, \"You stay. Don't stay home in the ghetto. Keep\non trying to sleep over there. Live over there 1n the factory.\u201d They always chased me to go\nout from the ghetto to be in the factory. This was a bridge...a bridge, you know, to cross the\nghetto. I came on the bridge; I remember it was guarded by Gendarmerie. Not by Gestapo,\nbut by Gendarmerie. And I knowed him; and he knowed me very well, too. His name was\n[Achtler (ph)]. I still remember. Because he used to come to the factory before\nChristmastime, and he used to wanted to send home some knives or whatever we produce in\nthe factory. And we used to give him for free. So he always was on very friendly terms. And\nI came to the bridge to cross the ghetto. He says, uh, \"Ausweis.\u201d\u2019 And I knowed right away\nthat something is not right, because I know him and he knowed me. And when he asked me\nthis; and I laughed, and I took out my Ausweis and I gave it to him. And he tore up my\nAusweis. And he said, \"Du zist...du bist selbig scheiss Jude wie jede andere. Wenn die Mal\nprobies das ghetto [geschitten (ph)], dann ein Kugel in dem Kopf.\"\u2019 And it means that he\nwill shot me. And I went home.",
        "Q: Will you tell us what that meant.",
        "A: This meant that...uh...that I am exactly like any other dirty Jew. I am the same, and I don't\nhave any right to cross the ghetto. And if I am going to try to go over the bridge to cross the\nghetto, I will be shot. I turned back and went home; and I told them. My...My oldest brother\nwas always travelling; but this...this day he was home. It was on a Saturday. And when I told\nthem, my parents...everybody got very upset. And my oldest brother said to my father and to\nme, he said, \"Don't worry, Moishe. We find a way that...that ...that the Gendarmerie will not\nhave any...anything to do with you.\u201d Although at this time, actually, they had already\nconflicts with the Russians. Was in '41. And...and they... they started. They wanted to take\nover the factory. The SS wanted to take over the factory to build barracks, that they can send\nthose barracks to Russia for their soldiers. And if the factory will belong under\nSS...uh...supervision, so nobody would have any right to touch me. \"You will be over there.\n' Translation from the German: \"You are the self-same shitty Jew as any other. When the mark\ntries [to sneak out of] the ghetto, then a shot in the head.\"\nYou will do your work, whatever they assign you to do it.\u201d OK. This was all. So we\nwaited...Monday, Tuesday. On Tuesday, came a Polish policeman. They had been together\nwith the Gendarmerie, but they didn't have no arms. And he came over, he came to our house\nwhere we lived in the ghetto. And he said...uh, to me, \"Mr. Kornberg,\" he says, \"You\nare...you are asked to come to the Gendarmerie over there for questioning.\u201d And right away\nmy parents looked at me, and very upset and everything. And I said, \"Don't worry. I be\nalright. I be back.\u201d I came down to Gendarme...to Gendarmerie...because 1n our...1t was a\nsmall town. We didn't have any SS in the town. But once a month, came from Radom came\nGestapo and SS, if they have any cases to take care, or whatever. And I was called in. It was\na very high SS. And he had about 10, 12 pages; and he keeps on asking me, \"Are you\nworking...you work in the factory?\" I said, \"Yes.\u201d And he said, \"You have double books.\u201d\nWe had to have double books, because the original what we paid them. One set books what\nwe original paid; one set books for the German government, to show it what we had been\nallowed to pay them. And he kept on asking me again questions, with finished merchandised\nand where it's hidden in the barn, and so forth. And I know it... saw it right away that he\nknows more what is going on than I even myself knowed it. Right away, he called in a kapo\nGestapo--or SS...I don't know--and they start to beat me. And they beat me so bad, so hard.\nAnd I was constantly on the floor. And he was an elderly SS, the man. So I was always on\nthe floor; and I went one time in and start to kiss his boot. I said, \"Please, shot me. Please.\u201d\nHe said, \"You will be shot, anyway. You don't have to worry about this. But first we get the\nwhole truth out from you.\u201d And I kept passing out from beating. So they took me down.\nOutside the building was...uh...a pump; because it was not inside...uh...was not water inside\nthe building. You have to go outside, if you wanted water. They put my head behind the\npump. They pumped water; and as soon I came back, they took me in again to beatings and\nbeatings and beatings. And my back was completely black, everything. The whole body,\npractically. And they took me...it was a small prison, a small town. They called this...not a\nregular prison. They called it a \"koza\" [Pol: \"lock-up\" or \"clink\"]. And I was sitting over\nthere. And the guy who was in charge, a Pole...Polak who was charge over this. He knowed\nme. He knowed the family. He knowed everybody. So he came over in secret, and he telled\nme, \"Whatever you want it, you just tell me. And I get in contact with your family, and you'll\nget it.\u201d\u201d And he said, \"You want write something home?\" So, yes, I remembered one thing;\nand I wrote it home. And I know it that everybody was still home--my brothers, and whole\nfamily. And I told them... One thing I didn't told them, that I was beaten so bad. But I said,\n\"Please, one favor I want it from you. Just forget about me.\u201d (Crying) The next day they sent\nme to Ko _skie. Ko _skie... this was the next town about 30 miles from Przedborz; and over\nthere, it was a larger town. It was already a regular prison. And they put me in prison. I came\nover there. They...first they took me to the...uh...Gestapo, to....uh... I was only afraid for\nbeating again; and I said do anything. But I nev...I was not beaten anymore. And I was put in\nnormal prison. I came in the prison. It was something. You know, that when you come in...a\nnewcomer comes in, everybody makes fun, or whatever. And they saw me--those old\nprisoners actually, mostly Poles. Gentile. And when they saw me, I could hardly walk\nalready. And I didn't know what to say, what not to say. So they stopped joking, and they\ncame talking to me more less serious. And they asked me what is happened, why I am here. I\ntold them, more or less. So they start, in some degree, respecting me a little bit. They\ndidn't...normally a newcomer comes in, get beat up in a prison, so forth. They didn't beat me,\nnothing. And in fact, every day normally they...you supposed--because it was not toilets\nequipped over there. You...we had...we had a large can, whatever. Whatever your normal\nthing you had to do, you did in the can. In the morning, had to be carried out and cleaned;\nscraped the floors, and everything. So they even pushed me away. They told me I don't have\nto do this. And I was over there for 4 weeks. I remember one time they brought, into the\nsame prison, three butchers. They caught them butchering, or whatever. And they have been\nvery...they had been in prison almost like religious. They constantly prayed and prayed. One\nmorning, they called them out; and I could hear--the other already told me--and I could hear\nshoot... shooting. And the other told me, \"Here, they are shotting over here. Bullets. You\nknow, rifles.\u201d They got shot over there. Well, I was the only...again the only Jew over there\nin this prison. And the owner from our partner--the woman-- she was arrested, too, when I\nwas arrested. And she was in the same jail in Ko_skie. And, apparently, when she was\nreleased she could scream in; you know, to call my name. It must have been that woman\nquarters was not far away. And she the same way called my name; and I said, \"Yes!\" And\nshe told me she is Frau Wiczitska, Mrs. Wiczitska. She says that she is free, she goes home;\nand she knows that I will be free, too. Just waiting for a high official from the SS to sign\nmine papers for freedom to go home. Now everybody came over from the jail; they told me\nto go see their relatives, and this and this. To tell greetings, or this and this. And I was sure\n100 percent that I go tomorrow. I will be released. But the next morning, was called off by\nnames. My name was also called off; and I came out. I didn't know it what is, if to be\nreleased or not released. They took us all in a truck. They drove us...uh...I believe nach\n[Yidd or Ger: \"to\"] Kielce or nach Radom.\u201d A bigger city. And from all prisons from the\nwhole area. They took all prisoners out from the prisons. We came the city where we have\nbeen. I don't know exactly this. I just mention Radom or the Kielce. They sent us out on a\nmarket, on the street where the market was. I know it that was quite...come more trucks,\nmore trucks; more prisoners and more prisoners. And all around us was Gestapo and SS with\nmachines and rifles around us. We all have been...like our hand tied with strings, just tied.\nWe had to lay down with the head down on this. So finally, a couple of years, when they had\nall those prisoners around, then...meant that we go to the railroad. They marched us to the\nrailroad. We went to rail...to cattle wagons. And same way, I didn't know it; nobody knowed\nwhere they take us. What they take us. Wherever. Some from the...from the guards, they\nsaid, \"Oh, you go to work somewhere.\u201d And we thought, oh, the same way--we go where to\nwork. But in the evening when it was dark, late at night, we finally arrived. And I still\nremember, we saw this...uh... Before the train went in, it slowed down over there. And we\ncould see a sign, and it read: \"Arbeit Macht Frei.\u201d And I never know it, about Auschwitz.\nAnd I didn't know that this was Auschwitz. But finally we got to know. And we came in. As\nsoon as they opened the wagons, it start the beating right away. The Gestapo and SS, they\nhave been stayed around wagons. And whoever passed by, didn't make any different, was no\nother choice than beating, beating, beating. And finally we came into the camp; and then we\nsaw already those...uh...concentration camps uniforms, striped ones. We all saw kapos; and\n* The Auschwitz Chronicle indicates that it was Radom.\nthey start to tell us, \"Here's Auschwitz.\u201d And they told us, \"Here you cannot live long. If you\nlive a day or you live two days, it is about all how long you live here.\u201d The same way, they\nkept on chasing us, beating us, chasing us, beating us. And I went...they took the pictures of\nme, like a criminal from all ends--odds and ends. They took my clothing. They told me to\nput in a bag, where it was written my name. Then we went...they shaved our head. Then,\nalways beating. Wherever you go, every step. Then we went to \"Disinfection.\u201d It was a huge\nbig barrel full of chlorine, water with chlorine. They throwed us in over there. And this\nmeant \"disinfected.\u201d\u2019 Then it meant that we should go for clothing. I mean, the same way...\nWherever you went, wherever you step you made, kept on beating and beating. They gave\nme--I am a small size. They gave me the largest size, whatever they could find it. For a large\nperson, they gave the smaller size--whatever they could find it. And the same way, like they\ndidn't gave us shoes; but they gave us...uh...wooden shoes. Wooden shoes. And you...and if\nyou have to be used to be able to walk in wooden shoes. If you are not used, you cannot\nwalk, practically. And the same way: beating, beating, constantly. And we saw already\npeople laying dead; they were everywhere piled up, piled up. And who was not dead, is 99\npercent already dead. Looks like dead. And we saw it is...doesn't make any different. It's no\nuse to fight for nothing. Whatever they want beat, let them beat it; what sooner is better.\nFinally, they set up a table. A large table. And they said they're gonna feed us. This was\naround the evening. So they brought a couple...uh...barrels with soup. The soup was terrible\nhot. It was more water, actually, than what they called it--soup. And then they had...for so\nmany people, they had maybe 30 or 40...uh... What do you call it? Uh, soup...soupen dishes,\nfor soup something. So you went over. Every time, every step, you have to be beaten. This\nwas normal. So you went over to get soup. You went over. They gave you a cup with the\nsoup to your dish, and you walked about 18 or 30 feet. This was the end of the table. You\nhad to leave the dish for the next person. If you could, drink it down hot. [E]special was real\nboiling; probably, intentionally boiling. If you...some poured in--I don't remember, I\nprobably poured in myself the same way--and you had to leave your dish, that's all. And\nthen they called us, after they gave us the soup; but 90 percent, practically, couldn't...had a\nchance to take it, whatever, the hot water. Then it...they called us [into] \"Appell. They...they\nsaid...we...stood in the \"Appell.\u201d\u2019 Was the first thing came a high officer, a SS officer. And he\nsays, '\"Juden, austreten!\"--\"Jews to step out!\" It was a fact in the whole transport, it was 4, 5\nthousand. Was eight Jews in the whole transport. Right away, we could notice that we are\ntreated already different, practically. We didn't care. We knowed this: that if you are gentile,\nyou didn't survive; if you are Jewish, you less survive. That's all. Finally, 1t got dark. They\ntold us we could go to the barracks. So we went into the barracks. It was three-story bunks.\nAnd the same thing: we have to jump right away, catch a... a bunk bed, lay down. It was so\nmany insects where we slept over there, I was beaten up. My whole body was red from\nbeaten up insects, whatever they had it over there, in this block. And in the morning, the\nsame way as we were, we asked if there is--you are human--if a toilet, or whatever. So they\nshowed us...it was from canalization, was covers like in the street. About five, six covers.\nThey say you take away the cover, and over there you got... The Kapo counts five. You have\nto be ready. It doesn't make any different how, but you have to be ready after five for the\nnext one. The same way. We saw it the same thing. Then they gave us...they start to...to\nregister us, take names...all kinds. And they gave us a number. Because you didn't had\nanymore a name. They called you only, like a dog or any animal, by number. And they gave\nus...my number was 62,465.\u201d They gave us to write...to sew up on the uniform what we had,\nthe prison uniform. And we know it right away. It doesn't make any different. Whatever it\nwill be, we through. But around 12 o'clock...12, 1 o'clock, before lunch, they called \"Juden,\neintreten!\"--\"Jews to step forwards!\" Over there. And I didn't know it what they're gonna do,\nif they're gonna shoot us or whatever. There came a doctor--a high...a high SS officer, a\ndoctor. And he checked our health and everything. Looked us through, without clothing; put\nus 1n the side. And right away, those kapos told us, \"Oh, you are lucky ones! You...you\ngonna go out in a subcamp in Auschwitz. You go to J awischowitz.\"\u201d We...we had to go to\nthe Kleidungskammer [Ger: \"Clothing Room\"]. Is where you get your clothing. We got\ndifferent clothing. We gave up the old clothing, what they gave us the day before. They gave\nus more suitable clothing. They gave us leather shoes. Then came a couple SS officers.\nGuards. And they said...they took us...I think it was--uh, from the eight, I think six of us from\nthe eight was--six Jews, and he had maybe eight more Reichs Germans. And he marched us\nthose few kilometers to Jawischowitz. Jawischowitz was a brand new camp. We came in\nright away, we didn't see no Kapos, no killings, no beatings. And it was...a...a Lageraltester.\nHe was a German, a very decent person. He was himself a prisoner. Then was...from the\noffice-- \"Schreibstube,\" we called it. And he was German; very, very nice person. His name\nwas Carl [Krimmer (ph)]. Very nice person. And he told us right away, \"Here is no Kapos,\nno beatings, no nothing. The only thing is, here you have to go everyday to work. We treat\nyou right. We feed you right. And if you work in the coal mine, you go in the coal mine...\nYou gonna work in the coal mine, then this is all what we ask you.\u201d In a few hours, the\ndirector from the coal mine came--a German. He had a speech. He was very well dressed and\neverything; he talked very nice to us. And he said that he will be responsible for us, that\nnobody can beat us or whatever. And, uh...we gonna be fed right, and we're gonna be treated\nright; but he one thing expect us, to do the work. He needs the work. We have to do the\nwork. And he says that \"You'll be able...\u201d I was assigned for nacht--the night shift. He said,\n\"Daytime, you come home; you have a nice bed, a clean block. You come from the coal\nmine, you got showers.\u201d They got brand new showers, everything. \"You take a shower. You\ngo back. You get food. Then you go to sleep, and nobody will disturb you. You will be\nasleep \u2018til the next evening, you have to go back to the mine.\u201d And this was true enough, 'til\nabout 1942--I don't remember exactly the month--when they start to get the Jewish transport.\nI remember the first Jewish transport was from Belgium. The numbers started with 66,000.\nVery nice people, decent people. And we...we still didn't know it, that they take every Jews\naway in Poland, or so forth, for transport. We had been treated every day a little bit less\ngood, because it was more people. It was room for 200, but more people...they used to bring\nin. If they brought 7, 8 hundred, the room...the blocks was the same thing. They just more\n> The Auschwitz Chronicle indicates that this prisoner number was assigned on September 1,\n1942.\n* Subcamp of Auschwitz. Located at Jawiszowice, several kilometers SSW from the site of\nAuschwitz I. See attached map.\ncrowded. And the food practically was the same thing, you know. So they just had to give\nyou less. This was the beginning. 67,000 came the next--this was from Holland. I have a lot\nof friends from over there. The same way with more people, that less start to disappear.\nThen, I remember, came the first transport from Poland. They have been 77,000. And they\nalready start to tell us what...how everything is home. That they just..everybody wait. And\nthat's the end of it, they emptied the ghettos. In the...our camp, what used in the beginning\nwas our model, got to the point actually--with another month, another month--was worse and\nworse and worse and worse. And they called it already like a Straflager [Ger: \"punishment\ncamp\"]. Only, like if somebody did something wrong in a regular concentration camp, they\nsent him to the coal mine to get it to be worse. And... but I was already a good worker in the\ncoal mine. I knowed over there Poles. And they respect me, because I did my work real\ngood. Once in awhile, they used to bring me my sandwich they give me. Because the Poles,\nthey have...uh...when they got the help, they always used to get a prisoner--an inmate--as a\nhelper. And they assigned...whatever they assigned per person, so much to do it. Like I was\nin night shift; so the night we didn't...uh...dug coals. We just reinforced, that it doesn't break\nthrough. So they used to send down stones and we used to throw in stones and build up with\nwood. You know, builds...and we told them that this holds up, that it doesn't ...uh...breaks\nthrough. This was our job. I think we had about like 2 meter hoych [ Yidd: \"height\"], and 5\nmeter long, and 4 meter deep, to fill up with stones. And this is 20...I still remember, 20\nsmall wagons. This was more or less assigned. And if the Poles, he got you...he got to do\ndouble. If you couldn't do it, they didn't let him out...go out the shift--the shaft, 'til his work\nwas completed. So they used to get mad; and they used to beat up those old inmates, because\nthey had to do the work for them. And they respect me. If I help somebody, I gave him the\nfull work, whatever I have to do it. You didn't have to do for me. And so they once in awhile\nbrought me a little bit...a sandwich, and so forth. And this helped. And I got acquainted; and\nthey always said that \"You are better than the other ones.\u201d The other used to be beaten up,\nand all kinds. But in the wintertime was very rough, because the SS used to march us. The\ncoal mine used to be in Brzeszcze. Brzeszcze was again about four kilometers...four, five\nkilometes from Jawischowitz, from the camp. And we used to get SS guards, and they\nmarched us to the coal mine. And they marched us...they always screamed to hold...uh...likes\nto march like soldiers. Their foot Schritt [German: \"step\"] had to be the same, always like a\nsoldier; and sing German songs, always. Nothing. And I remember even, the Lagerfthrer\nfrom Jawischowitz were...he was a Volksdeutsche. His name was Kowol. Uh, war a\n[gundsgert (ph)] [Yiddish: \"He was a \"]...he was a good murder[er], but he still\nwas not the worst murder[er]. He used to scream and everything, but not... But one time, I\nremember...uh, a young boy from Holland. His name was Pollack. And he couldn't keep up\nwith this footsteps like soldiers, like he wanted. And he [NB: Kowol] watched it; so he\nkicked him to death, so forth. But when we came down to the coal mine, the coal mine was\nabout 1500...uh...feet deep--435 meter deep-- where we worked. And the coal mine, we felt,\nuh...like a paradise almost. We had to work, everything; but at least you didn't have no\nkapos. You didn't have no SS. You didn't have no walk. We felt practically good about it.\nBut in the wintertime, when it rained...the weather was bad, it snowed, it rained. And the SS\ndidn't want it to stay so long; because we had to go in to take a lamp. You have always to go\nin to take a lamp. You had a coal mine lamp. Mine coal mine lamp was 118. I still\nremember. You said that your number is 118. They gave you the number. You have been\nresponsible, 'cause you had to bring back the lamp. The lamp was very heavy. You could\nhardly drag it. But you have to bring it back. If you didn't brought it back, they finish you off.\nIt means that you had sabotaged. And who gave out those lamps, was a kapo ...Poles,\ngentiles, who work over there. And very young kids--maybe 16, 17 year-old kids. And then\ncame French...who spoke only French, who spoke only Yugoslav, who spoke only uh Czech.\nAnd they told them their number. They didn't know it. And they just laughed and said, \"You\nshould take longer, actually.\u201d And meanwhile, the SS got rough; and beat us up, roughed us\nup, kicked us up. Because they had been mad. They didn't want to stay. And one was\na...uh...1nmate. He was a Reichsdeutsche, a German. And he couldn't see it anymore, you\nknow, to going down...down in the mine, and to work in the mine and be...beaten up so bad\nand kicked so bad. And so he came over to me. I was in the same block with him. He was\nmore or less like a Kapo, responsible for the shift--for the night shift. And he came over to\nme. I...[ was not sleeping, probably, wherever he was slept in the same block. And he said,\n\"You speak Polish, no?\" I said, \"Sure.\u201d He says, \"Maybe, you know, when you see his\nnumber, you're gonna used to the names and you can tell those boys in Polish the number. It\nwill get used, that they will go a little bit faster.\u201d I told him, \"I can try.\u201d And at this time, I\nwas young. And had a very good memory, too, I remember. And they tried out with me,\nwhat it used to take three quarters of an hour or an hour. In the beginning, it was a little bit\nhard for me. But I still speeded up in half, and so forth. And everyday was always the same\nfaces and the same numbers--the Haftling numbers. I got used to it that actually I looked at\nthe face or at this number, and I knowed the coal mine mine number already. And I ask...\nAnd I used to cut this down to about...in no time--to a half hour, 15 minutes--practically\nimpossible. And I got to be famous over there for this. And the SS...and they know it. And\nthey start the same way to talk to me, being nice. I didn't have to march anymore; work like I\nwanted. And once in awhile they used to even to bring me a sandwich, even. To get me...\nYou know, that nobody sees it, I should hide it. And this went on; and I did my job, whatever\nI could. And I was pleased that the beating stopped a little bit. But in the coal mine...in the\ncamp, started to worse and worse and worse. And they used to get it the same way. Every\nmonth, they used to get in another transport actually. So they didn't need it any more people.\nThey didn't care. So every month...month, it was a selection. Uh, a high SS doctor came--\nofficer--came from Auschwitz. We had to go through in the evening without clothing,\neverything. And as soon somebody saw it is undernourished, so forth, he put him in the side;\nand right away to the crematorium. The trucks came the next day, and took them over. But\nthey got always new transports. So it was never a shortage in labor anymore. Uh...",
        "Q: Okay. At this point. Let's stop. We need to pause and change tapes, so it's a good time to\nbreak.",
        "A: Okay.\nTAPE #2",

        "Q: Uh, what's a \"Kohlengrube\"?",
        "A: Uh, the coal mine.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Coal mine number. I was scared. I said, \"I can try.\u201d\u2019 And I passed it. I made it. So he took me\nto the kitchen. He gave me a whole bread and a whole sausage. This was like, somebody 1s...\n(Pointing at camera) He wants you to start again.",
        "Q: Okay, we're ready. Let's start with it. Did they then... I just need to know something for\nbriefly. Was it after that point that they took you out of the coal mines permanently?",

        "Q: Okay. When they start the cameras again, let's start with that story. Okay. Let's pick up at\nthis point when you are called out of the...out of the coal mines. I'll ask you how you got out\nof the coal mines.",
        "A: Where should I pick up? Where...",
        "Q: When you're called out of the...out of the coal mine.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: I'll ask you how you got out of the coal mine. I'll ask you that question. Okay. Will you tell\nus how you got out of the coal mines.",
        "A: Yes. After I was helping by distributing the lamps. And apparently the guards told the\nLagerfuhrer, Kowol, about that I helped speed up with the giving out the lamps. One\nmorning, I was at the \"appell.\u201d I was called out to come to the Schriebstube. Normally, when\nthey called you out to go to the Scriebstube meant you did something wrong--you didn't\nperform your job in the coal mines, so forth. So they beat you up. Real beat you up! I know it\nthat I was a real good worker, was famous to be a real good worker in the coal mine. I didn't\ndo nothing wrong, and I couldn't understand why they called me to the Schreibstube. So I\ncame to the Schreibstube. I went in; and I was shivering, practically. And I saw the\nLagerfthrer; and I took off my cap, and I told him my number. You know, that I came to the\nSchreibstube [messen (ph)]. And he screamed at me...screamed, \"[Recheche (ph)] Jude!\"--\n\"Dirty Jew!\" And all kind names. \"[Alles maderer (ph)|!\" And I was shivering over there.\nBut I...Carl [Xkrimmer (ph)], the arbeit [NB: \"worker\"] in the Schreibstube, [Phrase given in\nYiddish, not deciferable]. He showed me that I shouldn't be scared. I should calm down.\nFinally, he [NB: Kowol] start to ask me questions to where I am from my home...with my\nhome, what my parents did, what I did. And I told him. Then I couldn't figure it out. I says,\n\"What does he wanted from me? I gonna be released? Maybe my brother...some bribed\nsomebody, or whatever.\u201d Then he said, \"You helping out those boys giving out those\nlamps.\u201d I said, \"Yes.\u201d He said, \"If I will call 20 names, I will tell you the prison number--the\nKZ number. Can you tell me the coal mine number?\" I was scared. I said, \"I can try.\u201d So he\nbrought the book, and he called off those names; and I could finish...could tell him all names\nfrom the coal mine the numbers. He was very impressed with me. So he called me in to the\nkitchen. He said to follow him. We went into the kitchen. He told the chef from the kitchen\nto bring out a bread. A whole loaf of bread! And a whole big sausage. And he said, \"Hide\nit...to behind...\u201d To hide it behind my uniform. And when I came in...in the block, the other\nhad been already asleep. Except my friends, what I been very close with them. They had\nbeen so scared that I get beaten to death, or whatsoever. And they stood, and they shivered.\nAnd I go to the bed; and I pull out the bread, and I pull out the sausage. This was probably\nmore than 50--not millions, but billion--dollars, to say it for us. We divided with each other.\nAnd it was unbelievable. After a week, two, then by the \"appell,\" the same way the\nLagerfuhrer called my name; and he said I don't go anymore to the coal mine. I should be...\nwork in the camp. So he want me that I take care of the books in the coal mine with the SS.\nBecause the coal mine paid the SS [the] salary for all prisoners. The KZ prisoners. I kept\nthose books. And I had to go every day, count how many people in each block; and\ngive...uh...the amount to the kitchen, that they can...what they prepare more or less food. So\nthey know it how much food, whatever, to prepare. And they told me that I can go take a\nbath whenever I wanted, a shower, so forth. And I will get better food. I don't have to eat\nfood with every prisoner, when they come. I get the food. And the same way 1n the block.\nNobody will bother me, and so forth. But it was one...uh...Blockfithrer, he was a SS. He used\nto inspect the blocks. He was a...from Rumania, an SS. His name was [Drashner (ph). And,\nI remember, he always... He know that the Lagerfuhrer more or less liked me, 1n some\ndegree. And he...when nobody saw it, he used to beat me. I always was mad. I had in the\ncoal mine...I didn't hate it. I got...was used to work, and I was treated by the Polaks--by the\ncivil-- pretty good; and I didn't have it so bad. And I said, \"Why didn't I stay in the coal\nmine, where there better than this be here? Be always for him...\u201d He always used to say that\nI'm a... Because I did...I had the paper work to do with the books; and he said that I'm...uh...a\nspy. He always came and checked my papers, and look behind...uh...my mattress, to see if he\ncan find something there--a spy. Later, when I requested that I want to go back to the coal\nmine, he says, \"See, he is a spy! Because who had it so nice, who... Why does he want it to\ngo back to the coal mine?\" Is what he said to the other SS. And they used to have fight with\neach other. The [Drashner (ph)] with the Lagerfthrer. He even went to the higher Gestapo,\nand he told them that he [NB: Kowol] neglects the camp. He runs around with woman. He\nalways drunk...and he like me. He likes me. He doesn't bother... You know, something\nkilling, so forth. So they even transferred him to some elsewhere. I don't know where. And it\ncame...from Auschwitz, came another SS Lagerfthrer for the camp. For some reason, this\nwent on for awhile. And I was assigned back to the coal mine. I went back to the coal mine;\nbut they all, from the camp, and the workers...they all respect me. They all used to help me.\nLike, uh, from the Bekleidungskammer, [where] they give out the Kleidungs [Ger:\n\"clothing\"]. Paul Leventhal--es leben gebliben; es ein gans gr\u00e9sse [Yiddish: \"he survived,\nhe's a fat goose\"]... He's a big man 1n...in the Czechoslovakai [NB: Czechoslovakia]. Yeah.\nAnd [Von Baden (ph)], [undeciferable Yiddish phrase]. They all know me. So they used to\nhelp me some degree. And I went back to the coal mine, and I worked over there again until\nthe end of '44. This was around December, when the Russian invasion started. Then\nsuddenly they said that we're gonna be evacuated. The...those all who worked in the camp,\nthe besserer--those who had been treated better a little bit--we already talk maybe to\nescape...to try to dig a bunker or whatever. But it didn't materialize, because the time was too\nshort. We had been scared a little bit, too. And finally, the end of '44-- it was around\nChristmastime--they evacuate us.\u201d We had been told to take our clothing and one blanket,\nand take it along. So we marched until...through the night, all night; they even ...they let us\nrest a little bit. We laid down in the snow. It was snow already on the ground. And the next\nday, finally, they put us on cattle wagons; and they brought us to Buchenwald. In...from\nBuchenwald, they sent me again to Troglitz--a subcamp in Buchenwald. This was Tr\u00e9glitz.\u00b0\nThis was not far away from Leipzig, where I met over there a friend from me--he is from\nLeipzig--who lives also in Washington. His name is Bernard Federman. We kept a little bit\ntogether more or less. But this Troglitz was terrible. It was like...uh....no work, no food, no\nbath. In Auschwitz, we used to be very clean. They used to kill you if you didn't kept...didn't\nkept yourself clean. And Troglitz was just the opposite. Whatever you were in, you wore. In\nthe same way, even to work...when they took us to work, they... It was over there...uh...a\nrefinery where they used to make gasoline and coals, the Germans. And the refinery was\nbombardiered--was bombed through the Allies. They made us clean up today, from here to\nthis area. The next day they took us...told us to take back from over there to go back to this\narea. They just make us miserable so bad. And the little food what they gave us, terrible.\nThey didn't have even water. Even somebody want to wash themself didn't get even no\nwater. In the beginning, we used to take our black water, whatever they called it--\"coffee\"--\nwhat we got in the morning. Our ration. We used to wash ourself. We sacrificed ourself, we\nused to try to wash ourself. And finally, one time I remember we have been in the Baustelle\n> The evacuation from Jawischowitz actually began on January 19, 1945.\n\u00b0 Subcamp of Buchenwald. Located in the Sachsen Province (Prussia). Evacuated April 9, 1945.\nPrisoners were sent 1n the direction of Ort Wittenberg.\n[Ger: \"site\" ], where we worked over there; and the SS, even, was dirty. And it was\nwintertime, in January. It was real, real cold. We asked the SS...we saw over there they had a\nwell with pumping water. They had water over there. We asked SS if they would allow us to\ngo to wash ourself, because we don't have no water inside the camp. And they said, \"Yes.\u201d\nSo we took off our clothes, and we washed ourself without clothing. They couldn't believe it,\nthat we are able to do something like this. And they looked like real different people. Those\nall other people, they're black. Got baked in in their skin. And they used to treat them worse,\nreal bad. Because they said, \"You see? They can wash themself. You don't care anymore.\u201d\nThey used to beat the other one, who was there a longer time. [They] used to be mad at us,\nbecause they said, \"You just wait. You gonna be here a little while longer. You gonna get\nlike we, too.\u201d Which was true. It didn't took too long, we got to the same point. We didn't\ncare anymore. We couldn't walk practically on our feet, nothing, anymore. And we...the\nworse thing was, over there, every day used to be where they have the gate where we\nmarched out to work and come in to work. They used to stack up the dead ones who died on\nthe way. They used to stack them about...uh...six...four, stx meter hoych...uh, high--the dead\nbodies; because they ready, you know, to take them away to crematorium. When we\nalways...we went out to work, the SS told us to take along a little wagon, four-wheel wagon.\nAnd we didn't know it what for, but later I realized. Because those people who died on the\nway or on the working place, we had to take the dead bodies back to the camp. And we\nalways been scared, we know it: if...1f we gonna be forced to pull dead bodies, the next day\nwe will not be anymore able to make it anymore. And we know it. And we used to try\neverything just to run away; not to be...not to pull this wagon. We succeeded. One time, I\nremember I went...I was assigned... I gave away my rations to a one from the camp to...who\ndid assign you to go out to a Dachdecker [German: \"roofer\"]. To cover the roof--bombed,\nuh... Roofs that had been bombarded. We could cover it. So we had a chance. We come\namong civilians, German civilians; and once in awhile they give us, by themselves,\nsomething to eat. Or if we couldn't, we used always to go to cover the...the roof; and we\ncould see always they had...uh...piled up like flour, or onions, or whatever. We used to steal\na little bit to take it along to the camp. This helped us something. This went on until April;\nmore or less like April. In April in '45, the same way, they said we getting evacuated from\nTroglitz, we didn't know it where.\u2019 But we know it that we are pretty close to liberation. We\nheard it already. The same way they took us to wagons, they put us on the wagons. They\ntook us I don't know how far. We thought it may be 10, 20 miles away...30 miles, whatever.\nAnd when it got dark, they told us... No, we stayed there on wagons; but the next day when it\ngot daybreak, it was around woods. And they said we could go out and spend time in the\nwoods; but in the evening, before it got dark, we had to go back on the wagons. And food\ngot to be very, very little. It was not anymore food. We could see even that the guards, the...it\nwas already Wehrmacht--elderly guards, actually. They didn't had too much to eat anymore,\nnot too much. We didn't expect anymore too much. It was not to do it. Once in awhile, they\ngave us some (pause) raw...uh... I.... don't know how you call it. In Poland...in Yiddish, we\nused to call it \"kukuryze\" (Or, Pol: kukurydza) [Trans: \"maize, corn\"| Was a food like,\n\u2019 Troglitz was evauated April 9, 1945.\nmore or less, for animals--or real poor people ate this. They usually give us...we had a\nhand...two handfuls, like this. We got a little bit water...uh...portion allowed; you know, to\nbring a bucket of water to each wagon in the evening. This was all. Otherwise, we used to\nopen our mouths when it was raining. We were after Moses, how we had our water. One\ntime we have been in the woods; and we could see the..those old guards. They didn't care too\nmuch anymore. So we had been 3 of us. We said, \"Let's sneak away.\u201d Their barometer was\nfouled up. We always say we go we pick up some wood, want burn...warm up a little bit\nwater. They let us do it. And we sneaked out. We sneaked out; we came... One time we had\nbeen already out, you know, in the area. I remember we stayed overnight in the woods far\naway a little bit. A couple of miles away from over there. And we tried to fall asleep, but it\nwas so cold. It was a fast fall. We couldn't fall asleep. So we made out that every few\nminutes--5, 10 minutes--one should go in the center, where it's a little bit warmer. And we\nwarm each other, and maybe we...to get a chance. You know, that we have a chance to warm\nup. And...uh...the morning we got up, we couldn't sleep. And finally we said we have to go\nto try, you know, to shnorr, or something--you know, to beg. We saw some houses. So we,\nmore or less... those two who looked more or less half-decent--like civil[ians]--they couldn't\nrecognize that we had been KZ prisoners. We made them that they could go and beg for\nsome food; and if they have some food, they will come. They will give me, too; and bring it.\nAnd they went out for food. And for some reason, they got caught. Somebody on a\nmotorcycle--an SS, whoever it was--caught them. They asked them if it's more people that he\nknows. And he says, \"Yes, somebody 1s in the wood.\u201d So when they showed where...where I\nam, more or less. And I, meanwhile...the sun came up, and I fall asleep. When I woke up, I\nsaw those two came back and two Volkssturm.\u00ae They been Volkssturm--means they\nmobilize people. You know, they had not been able anymore to the army to go; but for\nthings like this, to protect the country more or less... With two rifles. And they come over to\nme, and they say with rifles, \"Get up.\u201d\u2019 And I said--this must be that two, three days that we\nactually we didn't have nothing to eat and nothing to drink. But period, nothing. And when I\nfall asleep over there and he said with the rifle to get up, I tried to get up. I tried to stay on\nmy legs. I fall back down. He say they gonna shot me. I said, \"What's wrong with this?\" To\nshoot you was like you give a kid...uh...a candy! But they didn't shot me. And I tried again\nand again. And so they didn't have no food whatever. So one talked to the other one, and\ntalked it over; and they went into..uh..a private home somewhere--was not far away--and one\ncame with two carrots, raw carrots. And he gave me the two carrots. I ate those two carrots;\nand I could walk. Stand on my feet, and walk like any normal person. I still don't believe\nmyself, even, this. They took us back to the camp, to make it short. So they came the\nLagerfuhrer, a high SS man. He says, \"Why did you run away?\" All of us, we...we told him,\n\"We didn't run away. We just wanted to beg for food and come back.\u201d And he...he\ndoes...does it like that (gesturing), and...he says, \"You think I am not hungry?!\" Something\nlike this. And he says, \"7 o'clock, you get shot.\u201d Again, do me a favor! All right.\n* Volkssturm (People's Militia) was organized in October 1944 and made up largely of boys and\nolder men, men between the ages of 16 and 60 who had not otherwise been called up to serve in\nother units of the German Armed Forces.\nBut...uh...the guards, they know...they help...they got their rations 6 o'clock. And they didn't\ncare anymore. So they run for their rations. They know it if they don't go for their rations,\nthey will not have it. So they let us alone. They run for their rations; and we run to the\nwagons. And the other guys, we told them we are set up to be shot at 7 o'clock. And they\nthink when we go on the wagons, they will not know who it was, or whatever. And the guy\nwho was in charge--for each wagon, was a guard in charge--he said, \"No.\u201d He got all the\npeople. He doesn't need anymore. He count them, always, in the evening. But they sat on\neach other, to hide them. He said, \"No, we need them.\u201d So they pulled us in the wagon.\nThat's all. A day, two, later... One time, uh...we saw planes coming. When the planes are\ncoming was the same way like...like the Messiah come. We had the nice face like normal\npeople--smiling, bright smiling. And here the guards, the SS and those lot, they keep on\nlooking; and they really, they bombed the wagons...the wagons. And there, they first they\nrun away--those guards. And we had to run away; although we had been legal, actually. No,\nwe could run away. We hanged around in the woods here and there. And then they come\nagain. They start to gather us and bring us back. And, uh, they brought us back. I\nremember...I don't remember what town it was. A little German town. I know it was in the\nfront a restaurant, in the back was a large backyard. They brought us over there. And it's\nmeant like: somebody goes here, somebody here, somebody here, somebody here. And sure\nenough, we saw it. One side, actually--took us to the other side, not where I was--they shot\nthem like nothing. Everybody just...you didn't hear even a scream, not a... Like nothing\nhappened. You just saw them lying dead, all of them. They put us on wagons again. No, they\nmarched us. Meant that we have to walk. But on the way, so long we have been marching.\nYou...they allowed you to march. You didn't get no food, no nothing; but they...you could\nmarch. But if you couldn't march anymore, whatever...shot you. So both sides of the road\nbeen full with dead bodies. We didn't realize, but later we hear they keep on shooting. So we\nrealized. The beginning, we didn't know why it was so many dead bodies. We realized what\nhad happened. In Troglitz was 4, 5 thousand people alive--maybe. But when we came back\nover there to our...again to the Sammelpunkt [German: \"collecting place\" ], where they\ngathered us all together, maybe was 200. I don't know. It's hard to tell. It was not too many.\nAll other have been in the...in the side of the ditches. And this, I believe, was Leitmeritz\n[NB: Litom _ice].\u2019 Leitmeritz: the same way, no floor. You have a barrack, and they had\neverything terrible. Uh, but...uh... they didn't beat you, nothing. They...they said, \"The\nmorning, you're gonna get coffee.\u201d We didn't hear anymore about bread, even; but \"You\ngonna get coffee.\u201d And we carried around always a rusted can, you know. And we couldn't\npractically sleep the whole night. We waited already to get something a little bit warm in our\nmouth. True enough, early in the morning, they said we get the coffee. Everybody runs,\ndidn't took no chances to wait. Everybody wanted to be first. And we got over there. And I\ngot the coffee, whatever; and I dranked it down quick. Then they tell us, \"All you...you\ngonna be taken to Theresienstadt [NB: Terezin]. This is a sanitorium. It's not anymore a\nconcentration camp. You're gonna be treated like people. Oh, you don't know how lucky you\nall are!\" You know. But...uh...after I drank, suddenly I got diarrhea. I got diarrhea, and I\n\u00b0 Subcamp of Flossenbiirg. Located in Czechoslovakia.\ncouldn't stay on my legs anymore. But I had two good friends, what I had been with them\ntogether in Auschwitz--[Yankin (ph)]| and another. They say, \"Mietek, [Three or four\nYiddish sentences follow, which are undeciferable].\u201d Theresienstadt...we saw it, more or\nless. We saw it like people; because we didn't look like people. This is the truth. We didn't\nlook...when they looked at us, they got scared. They run. They run away. And here, if they\npass by like with food supplies what they cared to give out for the people, those people\nattacked. I mean, I couldn't...I couldn't walk... They attacked, and they grabbed whatever\nthey could. So we...we even looked like a wild, wild animals. I'm not talking about humans\nat all. When we came in, I was in very bad shape. And we was in the block, suddenly. And\nthey start a little bit...they said, \"You'll get a little bit food.\u201d We got a little bit food, here and\nthere. They kept us waiting. They start to disinfect...disinfection us... You know, all kind\nwoman came. They shaved us all the way, everywhere. And they gave us, more or less,\nclothes...new clothing. I mean, clean clothing. Because ours was terrible. Because we never\nchanged. I was over there [NB: in Tro\u00e9glitz] over 3 months. We never had a different shirt.\nWhatever we got in the beginning, this...this...we had it all the time on. And so they more or\nless disinfect us a little bit. And it's... But people kept on dying and dying and dying, if you\neat something. But I didn't cared. I kept on...kept on eating and eating; and I kept on feeling\nbetter and better. And I felt, actually, that I start to get a little bit more to myself...to be\nmyself. And for some reason, always they picked me...they picked me. They needed over\nthere to keep an eye to give out the supply ...food supply, what it came from the Red Cross.\nFrom Switzerland, from Sweden. That I should help over there giving it out. Alright, I came\nover there. And over there was from the best breads, from the best butters, from the\nbest..uh..sausages. You name it. Over there was...was it, over there. Only thing you...1f you\ncould eat it. And who could eat it, everybody really got real ...like normal; strong back. And\nfor some reason, I had to go in the same way; count always the people in the blocks, where\nwe supplied them with food. And I don't know what it happened. Suddenly, I lost mine\nappetite. I couldn't eat anymore. And they put me over there, like in a hospital. Was no\ndoctors, no taking care. You just laid. You wait until you drop dead, because everyday\nwhatever they put in over there is very seldom somebody walked out from it. And I was over\nthere, didn't had no treatment. No, I didn't know what it was 'til today. But I know one thing.\nWhenever I could have the best food and eating, was my...my mouth was locked up--like\nwith a lock.\u201d I used to take, along a park, Theresienstadt. They still had parks. And I said, \"I\ngo in fresh air, sit on a bench. Maybe I'll be able [to eat].\u201d\u201d Nothing helped. I was over there\nmaybe a week, laying around. And I still don't know--I had a chance to walk out to over\nthere, and I could walk already. My appetite start to come little by little. I... know I never\nfight for my life, actually. In fact, I was upset why I am alive. It was much more better\npeople than me. (Long pause - crying). Yeah, then...then I was tried to go to Poland back. I\nthought for a few or maybe I found a brother or something. I had still brothers, two sisters.\nSomebody. And I was in Radomsko--this is about 20 miles from Przedborz--and I tried to go\nin. On the way, I recognized one who used to work in the factory for us. And I called his\nname. And I said, \"[Piogotski (ph)|!\" This was his name. So he came...he passed by with\n'\u00b0 This would seem to suggest Tetanus--also known as \"Lockjaw.\"\nhorses with a carriage, with a wagon. And he said--the first thing what he asked me, \"You\nstill ywy [Pol]?!\" That means, \"You are...are you alive?!\" Like I shouldn't live over there.\nAnd then he told me about Przedborz, it was 12 people. They had been, more or less, like\nunterwald Jewish people, you know. You know people, who didn't bother... didn't care. They\njust...you know, they have been...were hidden among Poles, didn't say they're Jews. They\nsurvived. They used to live in a one Jewish home over there in Przedborz. And one night, the\nPoles came...the AK--Armia Krajowa. It's a Polish extreme radical organization. They killed\nall 12. They put up sacks on their heads, and with axes. So he told me, \"It's not too safe for\nyou to go back home.\u201d A woman saw I had the conversation and I start to cry. And I\ntold...uh...to this [Piogotski (ph)], I told him in Polish...I told him, \"You know that I didn't go\nto Auschwitz as a Jew.\u201d It was not... It was true. Because I was involved, I listened always,\nyou know, to BBC. This was everything... When the SS men, they examined--the\nGendarmerie, you know--this was all written in. And I told him, \"I went to Auschwitz...uh,\nlike...as a Pole! And now I cannot go back?\" And I start to cry, and I practically spit on him.\nSo the woman came out, and she said... And I told her what's happen; and she said, \"Please,\ndo me a favor. If you want go, go to a big city. Go to Warsaw. Go to _6d_--Litzmannstadt.\nBut you cannot go to Przedborz.\u201d So in the morning ...and she took me in, in her house, and I\nslept the night; and the morning, I went back to the train. And I went back to Prague, to\nCzechoslovakia. When I came to Czechoslovakia, I met other friends who survived in\nAuschwitz; and they went home to...to Belgium. They told me, \"Come. Come along.\u201d They\nknow it I don't have nobody. They said, \"Why don't you come along...come with us to\nBelgium?\" I said, \"Okay.\u201d So they told me...they gave me a few hints--cities. They says,\n\"When the Consul ask you, you tell them, you know, this and this and this.\u201d And I come to\nthe Consul, whatever. He asks me other questions [than] what they told me. So he said, \"You\nare not from Belgium.\u201d So, no, I didn't pass. I couldn't go. So they told me, \"Go to a\nsanitorium over there,\" where they have been. He says, \"Over there, they treat you real, real\ngood. And real nice.\u201d Then he gave me the address, and I went over there to the sanitortum.\nThey told me, \"Don't say you are from Poland.\u201d They say, \"If you're from Poland...\u201d They\nhave...uh, skirmishes--the Polish army with the Czech army--at this time. Must have been\nin...1n May '45. And so I said, \"Okay.\u201d I came to the sanitorium. They asked me, \"From\nwhere you are?\" And I told them I am from Hannover, in Germany. And they took me in.\nAnd the Czech people, it's unbelievable how decent and good people. I never saw it, and I\ncouldn't believe it, how they treat me. Finally, a doctor examined me; and he told me that\nmine heart is enlarged. This comes from hunger. He told me not to walk steps, this and this.\nAnd I ask him...I ask him, \"Is this forever?\" He said, \"No. It's not to say. If you in normal\nconditions, maybe it goes back to normal.\u201d But this was the first time I was examined. I was\nover there for about 4 weeks. And I look... I couldn't recognize myself. Used...Mrs. Benes\none time came to see us. Young girls used to come. And we still have been our head shaved.\nWe didn't look...we looked half-human. They used to say how beautiful we are. It's\nunbelievable how decent, good people they are. (Crying) Okay, this was actually in there, I\nused to go out already in Prague. And I always...I didn't care to be on the...the Russian side.\nAnd we used to hear always...used to come in the other occupation to the American side.\nAnd they used to say that, you know, that they're treated real nice. The Army take care, and\nso forth. And I...I yust didn't like to see Russian soldiers, to be honest. So I went to an\norganization where they send you home from wherever you are. So I went to this\norganization, said I want to... I told them I want to go back home; because Hannover, I think,\nwas under the British, even. And they said, \"Oh, to Hannover, they have only 1 month a\ntransport. You would have to wait 2, 3 more weeks.\u201d Then was over there a German. And he\nsays he drives his car to Stuttgart. He drives to Stuttgart; and he says, \"It's on the way.\u201d He\nsays, \"At least you'll be closer.\u201d I didn't know it the difference between Stuttgart and\nHannover. So I...he offered me. I says, \"Okay.\u201d So he took me along; and I ended up in...in\nAus...in Stuttgart. In Stuttgart, first...uh...they send me over there. It was a organization for\nKZ,'' and Germans also. They send me...they gave me food and they send me to sleep in a\nschool somewhere. It was...uh, it was at least...uh, uh...human, more or less. In the morning, I\nwent out to the city a little bit, looked around. And right away, it was other ones. They...we\nrecognize each other. And they...they said, \"It's from...from KZ?\" And I said, \"Yes.\u201d He\nsaid...they asked me, \"From where? From what?\" I told them everything. He said, \"Where\nyou stay?\" And I told them the [Akuptschule (ph)|. \"Oh!\" He told me, \"Go take the street\ncar!\" They took...they helped me. They showed me where to go, what to go. They took me\nto Degerloch;'\u201d and [in] Degerloch was uh Katz Sanitorium. Degerloch is also outside\nStuttgart. Outside Stuttgart; and 1t was over there a sanitortum. The... the US...uh, Army...\nOver there was for Germans, the sanatorium. So he chased...they chased them out; and they\ntold all...I think, KZ...those all prisoners from KZ. And the German government had to\nsupply us with the best food, with the best in everything. Everything the best. And over there\nwas really...you know, got back to normal. And I looked more like a human. And everything\ngot back to normal.",
        "Q: You worked, I believe. After that, you worked for UNRRA.",
        "A: When I wasn't in...in the sanitortum--Katz Sanitortum was the name. The one who was in\ncharge of the food supply, he went to America. This was a event already in '45; must be in\nAmerica. So they looked for somebody; and the same way, I didn't volunteer. I didn't go\nnowhere. I don't know why. And they came to me. And they told me...you know, they want\nme that I will be in charge for the supplies from the IRA\u2018 and I should give out all\nprovisions to those who live over there in the sanitorium. And I was never somebody that\nwho knowed too much what...uh...to do business with other. I was too naive, very simple.\nAnd I wanted always constantly working, actually. I went to work. So I went to work over\nthere... uh...off in IRA. Mrs. Greenbaum, she worked for IRA. She was a United States\ncitizen. She came over from here to helping IRA. And I got along with her real, real good.\na g., for former concentration camp inmates.\n'? A suburb of Stuttgart.\n\u00b0 Actually, IRO: International Refugee Organization.

        "Q: How did you meet your wife? We have very little time.",
        "A: I went out...when they liquidated, actually, the camp--Degerloch. They gave back the\nsanitorium to Katz, actually; they gave him back everything. And they said, \"Whoever\nwant...you want live private, you go and live private. You want go to Reinsburgstrasse, ...\u201d\nThe Reinsburg Street 1s where was the other DP, the main DP camp. In Stuttgart, was on the\nReinsburg Street. \"...you can go live over there.\u201d Uh, so I choose...I was living private. And I\nwas actually... First, I figured I have a brother in Israel. I was now in contact with him. And I\nfigured I will go to Israel. Then I changed my mind. The reason was, because I know it that\nhe is over there not so well off. He's just working. And if I come over there, he had already--I\nknow it--he had already a boy, a kid, a wife. He gonna try to sacrifice himself to help me.\nAnd I said, \"It's no good. If I stay away, I can do any work. I am not anymore... Nobody\nknows me. I am home, this or this. I can do every work.\u201d And I was willing to work. And I\nsaid, \"I rather maybe go and I have a friend for me.\u201d The one who survived, Federman; and\nhe kept on writing me letters constantly, \"Come to America.\u201d He was already...he left in '45.\n\"Come to America. Come to America. Don't be afraid.\u201d I told him, \"I don't have no trade. I\nam not educated.\u201d He say, \"You'll make a living. Don't worry about nothing else.\u201d So I said,\n\"Okay.\u201d I...I didn't wanted to come...come America. Because I was scared, because I didn't\nhave nothing. What to show, or what to able to do with it. But I...the last minute I decided I\ndidn't want to stay in Germany, either. I said, \"I will go to America.\u201d And meanwhile, my\nwife I met. I got acquainted in Stuttgart one time with her. I was waiting for a street car.\n(Chuckle) And uh we talked, and then I asked her if I can meet her again. Uh, I met her\nagain and again, (chuckle) until I came over here in '49. In September, the end of September\n'49. She was over there. And I... She always used to write me real nice letters, and\neverything. And I really missed her. And I worked here--the first job--and my boss Mr.\nWolf, for whom I worked for American Industries, he was very nice to me. He was very\ninterested. He always called me in and talked to me privately. He had been very pleased with\nthe job what I did for the factory over there. So he helped me. He told them about that, I have\nover there a girlfriend, so forth. So he used to write letters to the...to the US Consul, to help\nme about this and this. I went to school, in the school...the Americanization school, actually.\nSo they helped a little bit, too. They wrote letters for me. Finally, she registered, and she\ncame in'51 here. We got married here. And the Rabbi Schiff married us.

        "A: My name 1s Morris Kornberg. I was born in January 6, 1918--in Przedborz, Poland.",
        "A: Um, I had then my parents, they have been...uh...in business. I had...uh...four brothers, and\ntwo sisters. I was the youngest. My eldest brother took over the business from my parents.\nAs far as I remember, this was in 1938. And we have been connected all the time\nwith...uh...different kind business. Mostly business...my brother used to supply the factories\nraw material, and so forth...so forth. My oldest sister was married. She had three kids; two\nboys, one girl. The oldest girl--was at this time in '39--she was 8 years old. Then the other\ntwo boys must have been 5 and 3. And then I had one brother who left Poland in 1933. He\nwent to Israel from a kibbutz. Then was another sister. She was still single. Then I had\nanother brother. And I was the youngest in all.",
        "A: As far as I remember of my childhood, I used... My parents were strictly Orthodox people;\nbut we have been four brothers at home. 'Til about 14, 15 years old, we all attended Jewish\nschools and never went even to a public schools; because our parents had been so religious.\nThey always sent us to Jewish schools. Private...actually, a teacher--a private teacher. A\nRabbi, more or less. And we took also, beside...uh... languages--like Polish, or other modern\nlanguages. What I studied was only private...private. And as I remember, when I was 15\nyears old; and then the parents let us more or less do it our own way. We didn't go anymore\nwith...uh...my father, like we used to every Sabbos [NB: Shabbat] to the shtievel | Yiddish:\n\"house\" (of worship?)], und so weiter [Yiddish or German: \"and so forth\"]. But...uh,\nwe...we have been allowed more or less to go our own way, in some degree. But we always\nhave been understanding..., we tried to be good kids. Not to embarrass...uh... So I belonged\nto...uh...Jewish organization. It actually a...a sport...um, like a sports organization; but it was\na religious sport organization. I used to help around at home, with business. It was assigned\nto do...uh...all, uh...different things, whatever; I always helped around. Whatever they asked\nme, I always did, so forth. And in the evening, we used to spend in the Zionist Organization,\nwhere we...we...we learned Hebrew and once a week we had some dancing, and so forth.\nMore modern life. This went on, more or less, all my years; 'til actually the German, when\nthey came in 1939. I think it was the first of...uh...September. The first day when they came\nin, right away the whole town run away. Because we had been afraid, actually, of Germans;\nand we went to the woods. And we had been for two, three days in the woods all around.\nAnd the time come, we went back home. This...the town, the little town, was about 70\npercent was burned out; but our house was still standing. The business, everything, was still\nlike normal. We tried to adjust ourselves to a normal life. As I can remember, right away\nfrom the beginning...uh...was like a...a law. The German called a \"Kommissar\"--who was in\ncharge of the little town--called us over; and he said that we all, from 13...age from 13 'til 50,\nwill have to perform labor. Every day, we have to go to the...to do some work. So we used to\ngo to the...the Jewish Kultursgemeinde. Over there, we have been assigned; like mostly\ncleaning, taking away old brick, cleaning up areas. Didn't make any different. But in the\nevening, we have been allowed to go back at home. Later on, they assigned me--mostly in\nmine age, from the city--to a Steinbruch [NB: \"quarry\"] We used to mine stones; those\nstones have been for the...for the roads. They built new road, and so those stones went to the\nroads. And so this was pretty heavy work, everything. But still, I was pretty young and\nhealthy, and I got adjusted. And I...and I did my work. I have the two other brothers--\nbecause he was always in business. And at this time, the German government...they\nneeded...base...steel basement materials--steel. My oldest brother was always 1n contact with\nbig manufacturer, Jewish people, who used to have supply from all kinds steel metal. And if\nhe supplied so many pounds--I don't....cannot recall the amount--you...you got a gr\u00e9ne binde\n[NB: \"green band\"]. Start to wear the white and blue armband, so you got a green band. A\ngreen band meant that you could go outside the ghetto. You could travel. You could use the\ntrains. And you have...you have been restricted, but you still had a little bit freedom. So then\nmy oldest brother saw that my youngest--uh, my older brother from me, the second brother--\nhad a grone binde, too. So we didn't have to go to work every day, like the steinbruch, and do\nall public kind of works. And happened to be...our parents, they had a factory with a partner,\nwith a gentile people. Poles. In the beginning, we didn't even wanted to go down to the\nfactory; because it was everything under his name, more or less. We didn't want it to\nknow...the Germans know that this our property, half was our property of the factory.\nBecause we know it if it is Jewish property, was confiscated. But the owner from the\nprop...from the partner from the factory, our partner the owner was arrested in 1940. This\nwas with the first Polish intelligent[sia] what they took away. They arrested him. Two weeks\nlater, came a notice that he did not survive. The clothing came back home, and he was not\nalive anymore. And the factory was not running right with nobody to manage, so forth. So\nmy brother, through...he had some friends who had contact with the Gestapo. And for\nmoney, they could make it that it's not for myself to go to every day to work for Zwangs\n[NB: \"compulsory\"] labor to be assigned... to have my assignment; my labor should be to the\nfactory. We lived already in a ghetto. The factory was on the other side in the town, also out\nthe ghetto. So I got a I.D. card from Gestapo, that I can go..cross every day to the factory.\nCross ...I go outside the ghetto, and be over there. We came... So I were came to the factory.\nMy brother used to supply raw materials, because you couldn't get it at this time raw\nmaterials from the German. You have to have a special permission, actually. But my brother\nhad connection; and we could produce again knives, spoons, forks...whatever we\nmanufactured over there. But it was a problem that the...same way, labor. You couldn't pay a\nlabor[er] more than the price from before the war prices, more or less. And nobody wanted\nto work, because everything was already like black market. Except what you got your\nrations. Right away, Jewish people never got any rations. So the problem was that nobody\nwanted to work. Then my brother told me to try to tell those people who used to work in the\nfactory that we will pay them 2, 3 times as much [as] whatever is allowed by the law. And he\nwill be able to sell the merchandise to some friends, who had Jewish people stores; what he\ncould given them a bill and he will actually get paid three times as much, too, for the\nmerchandise. This went on...and I used to be always in the factory, and this went on for quite\na long time. Apparently, over a year. It happened to be that one of the workers in the factory,\nhe was some dissatisfied--not with me, but with the ...with the lady from our partner. And he\nwent...he went to the Gestapo; and he said that the whole factory belongs, actually, to us.\nThe factory belongs to us. Whatever we used manufactoring, we had been always afraid that\nsomething can happen this week, or next week or [the] next week. We used to carry away\nfinished merchandise; and it was over there he used to carry the finished material to the\nrailroads. So he lived 1n our village. He had a barn where he used to carry finished\nmerchandise to his barn, too. Well, one day, I remember...it must have been like the middle\nof August. I cannot recall exactly, but...uh...more or less in August. It was on a Saturday.\nAnd I was trying in...at home they told me, \"You stay. Don't stay home in the ghetto. Keep\non trying to sleep over there. Live over there 1n the factory.\u201d They always chased me to go\nout from the ghetto to be in the factory. This was a bridge...a bridge, you know, to cross the\nghetto. I came on the bridge; I remember it was guarded by Gendarmerie. Not by Gestapo,\nbut by Gendarmerie. And I knowed him; and he knowed me very well, too. His name was\n[Achtler (ph)]. I still remember. Because he used to come to the factory before\nChristmastime, and he used to wanted to send home some knives or whatever we produce in\nthe factory. And we used to give him for free. So he always was on very friendly terms. And\nI came to the bridge to cross the ghetto. He says, uh, \"Ausweis.\u201d\u2019 And I knowed right away\nthat something is not right, because I know him and he knowed me. And when he asked me\nthis; and I laughed, and I took out my Ausweis and I gave it to him. And he tore up my\nAusweis. And he said, \"Du zist...du bist selbig scheiss Jude wie jede andere. Wenn die Mal\nprobies das ghetto [geschitten (ph)], dann ein Kugel in dem Kopf.\"\u2019 And it means that he\nwill shot me. And I went home.",
        "A: This meant that...uh...that I am exactly like any other dirty Jew. I am the same, and I don't\nhave any right to cross the ghetto. And if I am going to try to go over the bridge to cross the\nghetto, I will be shot. I turned back and went home; and I told them. My...My oldest brother\nwas always travelling; but this...this day he was home. It was on a Saturday. And when I told\nthem, my parents...everybody got very upset. And my oldest brother said to my father and to\nme, he said, \"Don't worry, Moishe. We find a way that...that ...that the Gendarmerie will not\nhave any...anything to do with you.\u201d Although at this time, actually, they had already\nconflicts with the Russians. Was in '41. And...and they... they started. They wanted to take\nover the factory. The SS wanted to take over the factory to build barracks, that they can send\nthose barracks to Russia for their soldiers. And if the factory will belong under\nSS...uh...supervision, so nobody would have any right to touch me. \"You will be over there.\n' Translation from the German: \"You are the self-same shitty Jew as any other. When the mark\ntries [to sneak out of] the ghetto, then a shot in the head.\"\nYou will do your work, whatever they assign you to do it.\u201d OK. This was all. So we\nwaited...Monday, Tuesday. On Tuesday, came a Polish policeman. They had been together\nwith the Gendarmerie, but they didn't have no arms. And he came over, he came to our house\nwhere we lived in the ghetto. And he said...uh, to me, \"Mr. Kornberg,\" he says, \"You\nare...you are asked to come to the Gendarmerie over there for questioning.\u201d And right away\nmy parents looked at me, and very upset and everything. And I said, \"Don't worry. I be\nalright. I be back.\u201d I came down to Gendarme...to Gendarmerie...because 1n our...1t was a\nsmall town. We didn't have any SS in the town. But once a month, came from Radom came\nGestapo and SS, if they have any cases to take care, or whatever. And I was called in. It was\na very high SS. And he had about 10, 12 pages; and he keeps on asking me, \"Are you\nworking...you work in the factory?\" I said, \"Yes.\u201d And he said, \"You have double books.\u201d\nWe had to have double books, because the original what we paid them. One set books what\nwe original paid; one set books for the German government, to show it what we had been\nallowed to pay them. And he kept on asking me again questions, with finished merchandised\nand where it's hidden in the barn, and so forth. And I know it... saw it right away that he\nknows more what is going on than I even myself knowed it. Right away, he called in a kapo\nGestapo--or SS...I don't know--and they start to beat me. And they beat me so bad, so hard.\nAnd I was constantly on the floor. And he was an elderly SS, the man. So I was always on\nthe floor; and I went one time in and start to kiss his boot. I said, \"Please, shot me. Please.\u201d\nHe said, \"You will be shot, anyway. You don't have to worry about this. But first we get the\nwhole truth out from you.\u201d And I kept passing out from beating. So they took me down.\nOutside the building was...uh...a pump; because it was not inside...uh...was not water inside\nthe building. You have to go outside, if you wanted water. They put my head behind the\npump. They pumped water; and as soon I came back, they took me in again to beatings and\nbeatings and beatings. And my back was completely black, everything. The whole body,\npractically. And they took me...it was a small prison, a small town. They called this...not a\nregular prison. They called it a \"koza\" [Pol: \"lock-up\" or \"clink\"]. And I was sitting over\nthere. And the guy who was in charge, a Pole...Polak who was charge over this. He knowed\nme. He knowed the family. He knowed everybody. So he came over in secret, and he telled\nme, \"Whatever you want it, you just tell me. And I get in contact with your family, and you'll\nget it.\u201d\u201d And he said, \"You want write something home?\" So, yes, I remembered one thing;\nand I wrote it home. And I know it that everybody was still home--my brothers, and whole\nfamily. And I told them... One thing I didn't told them, that I was beaten so bad. But I said,\n\"Please, one favor I want it from you. Just forget about me.\u201d (Crying) The next day they sent\nme to Ko _skie. Ko _skie... this was the next town about 30 miles from Przedborz; and over\nthere, it was a larger town. It was already a regular prison. And they put me in prison. I came\nover there. They...first they took me to the...uh...Gestapo, to....uh... I was only afraid for\nbeating again; and I said do anything. But I nev...I was not beaten anymore. And I was put in\nnormal prison. I came in the prison. It was something. You know, that when you come in...a\nnewcomer comes in, everybody makes fun, or whatever. And they saw me--those old\nprisoners actually, mostly Poles. Gentile. And when they saw me, I could hardly walk\nalready. And I didn't know what to say, what not to say. So they stopped joking, and they\ncame talking to me more less serious. And they asked me what is happened, why I am here. I\ntold them, more or less. So they start, in some degree, respecting me a little bit. They\ndidn't...normally a newcomer comes in, get beat up in a prison, so forth. They didn't beat me,\nnothing. And in fact, every day normally they...you supposed--because it was not toilets\nequipped over there. You...we had...we had a large can, whatever. Whatever your normal\nthing you had to do, you did in the can. In the morning, had to be carried out and cleaned;\nscraped the floors, and everything. So they even pushed me away. They told me I don't have\nto do this. And I was over there for 4 weeks. I remember one time they brought, into the\nsame prison, three butchers. They caught them butchering, or whatever. And they have been\nvery...they had been in prison almost like religious. They constantly prayed and prayed. One\nmorning, they called them out; and I could hear--the other already told me--and I could hear\nshoot... shooting. And the other told me, \"Here, they are shotting over here. Bullets. You\nknow, rifles.\u201d They got shot over there. Well, I was the only...again the only Jew over there\nin this prison. And the owner from our partner--the woman-- she was arrested, too, when I\nwas arrested. And she was in the same jail in Ko_skie. And, apparently, when she was\nreleased she could scream in; you know, to call my name. It must have been that woman\nquarters was not far away. And she the same way called my name; and I said, \"Yes!\" And\nshe told me she is Frau Wiczitska, Mrs. Wiczitska. She says that she is free, she goes home;\nand she knows that I will be free, too. Just waiting for a high official from the SS to sign\nmine papers for freedom to go home. Now everybody came over from the jail; they told me\nto go see their relatives, and this and this. To tell greetings, or this and this. And I was sure\n100 percent that I go tomorrow. I will be released. But the next morning, was called off by\nnames. My name was also called off; and I came out. I didn't know it what is, if to be\nreleased or not released. They took us all in a truck. They drove us...uh...I believe nach\n[Yidd or Ger: \"to\"] Kielce or nach Radom.\u201d A bigger city. And from all prisons from the\nwhole area. They took all prisoners out from the prisons. We came the city where we have\nbeen. I don't know exactly this. I just mention Radom or the Kielce. They sent us out on a\nmarket, on the street where the market was. I know it that was quite...come more trucks,\nmore trucks; more prisoners and more prisoners. And all around us was Gestapo and SS with\nmachines and rifles around us. We all have been...like our hand tied with strings, just tied.\nWe had to lay down with the head down on this. So finally, a couple of years, when they had\nall those prisoners around, then...meant that we go to the railroad. They marched us to the\nrailroad. We went to rail...to cattle wagons. And same way, I didn't know it; nobody knowed\nwhere they take us. What they take us. Wherever. Some from the...from the guards, they\nsaid, \"Oh, you go to work somewhere.\u201d And we thought, oh, the same way--we go where to\nwork. But in the evening when it was dark, late at night, we finally arrived. And I still\nremember, we saw this...uh... Before the train went in, it slowed down over there. And we\ncould see a sign, and it read: \"Arbeit Macht Frei.\u201d And I never know it, about Auschwitz.\nAnd I didn't know that this was Auschwitz. But finally we got to know. And we came in. As\nsoon as they opened the wagons, it start the beating right away. The Gestapo and SS, they\nhave been stayed around wagons. And whoever passed by, didn't make any different, was no\nother choice than beating, beating, beating. And finally we came into the camp; and then we\nsaw already those...uh...concentration camps uniforms, striped ones. We all saw kapos; and\n* The Auschwitz Chronicle indicates that it was Radom.\nthey start to tell us, \"Here's Auschwitz.\u201d And they told us, \"Here you cannot live long. If you\nlive a day or you live two days, it is about all how long you live here.\u201d The same way, they\nkept on chasing us, beating us, chasing us, beating us. And I went...they took the pictures of\nme, like a criminal from all ends--odds and ends. They took my clothing. They told me to\nput in a bag, where it was written my name. Then we went...they shaved our head. Then,\nalways beating. Wherever you go, every step. Then we went to \"Disinfection.\u201d It was a huge\nbig barrel full of chlorine, water with chlorine. They throwed us in over there. And this\nmeant \"disinfected.\u201d\u2019 Then it meant that we should go for clothing. I mean, the same way...\nWherever you went, wherever you step you made, kept on beating and beating. They gave\nme--I am a small size. They gave me the largest size, whatever they could find it. For a large\nperson, they gave the smaller size--whatever they could find it. And the same way, like they\ndidn't gave us shoes; but they gave us...uh...wooden shoes. Wooden shoes. And you...and if\nyou have to be used to be able to walk in wooden shoes. If you are not used, you cannot\nwalk, practically. And the same way: beating, beating, constantly. And we saw already\npeople laying dead; they were everywhere piled up, piled up. And who was not dead, is 99\npercent already dead. Looks like dead. And we saw it is...doesn't make any different. It's no\nuse to fight for nothing. Whatever they want beat, let them beat it; what sooner is better.\nFinally, they set up a table. A large table. And they said they're gonna feed us. This was\naround the evening. So they brought a couple...uh...barrels with soup. The soup was terrible\nhot. It was more water, actually, than what they called it--soup. And then they had...for so\nmany people, they had maybe 30 or 40...uh... What do you call it? Uh, soup...soupen dishes,\nfor soup something. So you went over. Every time, every step, you have to be beaten. This\nwas normal. So you went over to get soup. You went over. They gave you a cup with the\nsoup to your dish, and you walked about 18 or 30 feet. This was the end of the table. You\nhad to leave the dish for the next person. If you could, drink it down hot. [E]special was real\nboiling; probably, intentionally boiling. If you...some poured in--I don't remember, I\nprobably poured in myself the same way--and you had to leave your dish, that's all. And\nthen they called us, after they gave us the soup; but 90 percent, practically, couldn't...had a\nchance to take it, whatever, the hot water. Then it...they called us [into] \"Appell. They...they\nsaid...we...stood in the \"Appell.\u201d\u2019 Was the first thing came a high officer, a SS officer. And he\nsays, '\"Juden, austreten!\"--\"Jews to step out!\" It was a fact in the whole transport, it was 4, 5\nthousand. Was eight Jews in the whole transport. Right away, we could notice that we are\ntreated already different, practically. We didn't care. We knowed this: that if you are gentile,\nyou didn't survive; if you are Jewish, you less survive. That's all. Finally, 1t got dark. They\ntold us we could go to the barracks. So we went into the barracks. It was three-story bunks.\nAnd the same thing: we have to jump right away, catch a... a bunk bed, lay down. It was so\nmany insects where we slept over there, I was beaten up. My whole body was red from\nbeaten up insects, whatever they had it over there, in this block. And in the morning, the\nsame way as we were, we asked if there is--you are human--if a toilet, or whatever. So they\nshowed us...it was from canalization, was covers like in the street. About five, six covers.\nThey say you take away the cover, and over there you got... The Kapo counts five. You have\nto be ready. It doesn't make any different how, but you have to be ready after five for the\nnext one. The same way. We saw it the same thing. Then they gave us...they start to...to\nregister us, take names...all kinds. And they gave us a number. Because you didn't had\nanymore a name. They called you only, like a dog or any animal, by number. And they gave\nus...my number was 62,465.\u201d They gave us to write...to sew up on the uniform what we had,\nthe prison uniform. And we know it right away. It doesn't make any different. Whatever it\nwill be, we through. But around 12 o'clock...12, 1 o'clock, before lunch, they called \"Juden,\neintreten!\"--\"Jews to step forwards!\" Over there. And I didn't know it what they're gonna do,\nif they're gonna shoot us or whatever. There came a doctor--a high...a high SS officer, a\ndoctor. And he checked our health and everything. Looked us through, without clothing; put\nus 1n the side. And right away, those kapos told us, \"Oh, you are lucky ones! You...you\ngonna go out in a subcamp in Auschwitz. You go to J awischowitz.\"\u201d We...we had to go to\nthe Kleidungskammer [Ger: \"Clothing Room\"]. Is where you get your clothing. We got\ndifferent clothing. We gave up the old clothing, what they gave us the day before. They gave\nus more suitable clothing. They gave us leather shoes. Then came a couple SS officers.\nGuards. And they said...they took us...I think it was--uh, from the eight, I think six of us from\nthe eight was--six Jews, and he had maybe eight more Reichs Germans. And he marched us\nthose few kilometers to Jawischowitz. Jawischowitz was a brand new camp. We came in\nright away, we didn't see no Kapos, no killings, no beatings. And it was...a...a Lageraltester.\nHe was a German, a very decent person. He was himself a prisoner. Then was...from the\noffice-- \"Schreibstube,\" we called it. And he was German; very, very nice person. His name\nwas Carl [Krimmer (ph)]. Very nice person. And he told us right away, \"Here is no Kapos,\nno beatings, no nothing. The only thing is, here you have to go everyday to work. We treat\nyou right. We feed you right. And if you work in the coal mine, you go in the coal mine...\nYou gonna work in the coal mine, then this is all what we ask you.\u201d In a few hours, the\ndirector from the coal mine came--a German. He had a speech. He was very well dressed and\neverything; he talked very nice to us. And he said that he will be responsible for us, that\nnobody can beat us or whatever. And, uh...we gonna be fed right, and we're gonna be treated\nright; but he one thing expect us, to do the work. He needs the work. We have to do the\nwork. And he says that \"You'll be able...\u201d I was assigned for nacht--the night shift. He said,\n\"Daytime, you come home; you have a nice bed, a clean block. You come from the coal\nmine, you got showers.\u201d They got brand new showers, everything. \"You take a shower. You\ngo back. You get food. Then you go to sleep, and nobody will disturb you. You will be\nasleep \u2018til the next evening, you have to go back to the mine.\u201d And this was true enough, 'til\nabout 1942--I don't remember exactly the month--when they start to get the Jewish transport.\nI remember the first Jewish transport was from Belgium. The numbers started with 66,000.\nVery nice people, decent people. And we...we still didn't know it, that they take every Jews\naway in Poland, or so forth, for transport. We had been treated every day a little bit less\ngood, because it was more people. It was room for 200, but more people...they used to bring\nin. If they brought 7, 8 hundred, the room...the blocks was the same thing. They just more\n> The Auschwitz Chronicle indicates that this prisoner number was assigned on September 1,\n1942.\n* Subcamp of Auschwitz. Located at Jawiszowice, several kilometers SSW from the site of\nAuschwitz I. See attached map.\ncrowded. And the food practically was the same thing, you know. So they just had to give\nyou less. This was the beginning. 67,000 came the next--this was from Holland. I have a lot\nof friends from over there. The same way with more people, that less start to disappear.\nThen, I remember, came the first transport from Poland. They have been 77,000. And they\nalready start to tell us what...how everything is home. That they just..everybody wait. And\nthat's the end of it, they emptied the ghettos. In the...our camp, what used in the beginning\nwas our model, got to the point actually--with another month, another month--was worse and\nworse and worse and worse. And they called it already like a Straflager [Ger: \"punishment\ncamp\"]. Only, like if somebody did something wrong in a regular concentration camp, they\nsent him to the coal mine to get it to be worse. And... but I was already a good worker in the\ncoal mine. I knowed over there Poles. And they respect me, because I did my work real\ngood. Once in awhile, they used to bring me my sandwich they give me. Because the Poles,\nthey have...uh...when they got the help, they always used to get a prisoner--an inmate--as a\nhelper. And they assigned...whatever they assigned per person, so much to do it. Like I was\nin night shift; so the night we didn't...uh...dug coals. We just reinforced, that it doesn't break\nthrough. So they used to send down stones and we used to throw in stones and build up with\nwood. You know, builds...and we told them that this holds up, that it doesn't ...uh...breaks\nthrough. This was our job. I think we had about like 2 meter hoych [ Yidd: \"height\"], and 5\nmeter long, and 4 meter deep, to fill up with stones. And this is 20...I still remember, 20\nsmall wagons. This was more or less assigned. And if the Poles, he got you...he got to do\ndouble. If you couldn't do it, they didn't let him out...go out the shift--the shaft, 'til his work\nwas completed. So they used to get mad; and they used to beat up those old inmates, because\nthey had to do the work for them. And they respect me. If I help somebody, I gave him the\nfull work, whatever I have to do it. You didn't have to do for me. And so they once in awhile\nbrought me a little bit...a sandwich, and so forth. And this helped. And I got acquainted; and\nthey always said that \"You are better than the other ones.\u201d The other used to be beaten up,\nand all kinds. But in the wintertime was very rough, because the SS used to march us. The\ncoal mine used to be in Brzeszcze. Brzeszcze was again about four kilometers...four, five\nkilometes from Jawischowitz, from the camp. And we used to get SS guards, and they\nmarched us to the coal mine. And they marched us...they always screamed to hold...uh...likes\nto march like soldiers. Their foot Schritt [German: \"step\"] had to be the same, always like a\nsoldier; and sing German songs, always. Nothing. And I remember even, the Lagerfthrer\nfrom Jawischowitz were...he was a Volksdeutsche. His name was Kowol. Uh, war a\n[gundsgert (ph)] [Yiddish: \"He was a \"]...he was a good murder[er], but he still\nwas not the worst murder[er]. He used to scream and everything, but not... But one time, I\nremember...uh, a young boy from Holland. His name was Pollack. And he couldn't keep up\nwith this footsteps like soldiers, like he wanted. And he [NB: Kowol] watched it; so he\nkicked him to death, so forth. But when we came down to the coal mine, the coal mine was\nabout 1500...uh...feet deep--435 meter deep-- where we worked. And the coal mine, we felt,\nuh...like a paradise almost. We had to work, everything; but at least you didn't have no\nkapos. You didn't have no SS. You didn't have no walk. We felt practically good about it.\nBut in the wintertime, when it rained...the weather was bad, it snowed, it rained. And the SS\ndidn't want it to stay so long; because we had to go in to take a lamp. You have always to go\nin to take a lamp. You had a coal mine lamp. Mine coal mine lamp was 118. I still\nremember. You said that your number is 118. They gave you the number. You have been\nresponsible, 'cause you had to bring back the lamp. The lamp was very heavy. You could\nhardly drag it. But you have to bring it back. If you didn't brought it back, they finish you off.\nIt means that you had sabotaged. And who gave out those lamps, was a kapo ...Poles,\ngentiles, who work over there. And very young kids--maybe 16, 17 year-old kids. And then\ncame French...who spoke only French, who spoke only Yugoslav, who spoke only uh Czech.\nAnd they told them their number. They didn't know it. And they just laughed and said, \"You\nshould take longer, actually.\u201d And meanwhile, the SS got rough; and beat us up, roughed us\nup, kicked us up. Because they had been mad. They didn't want to stay. And one was\na...uh...1nmate. He was a Reichsdeutsche, a German. And he couldn't see it anymore, you\nknow, to going down...down in the mine, and to work in the mine and be...beaten up so bad\nand kicked so bad. And so he came over to me. I was in the same block with him. He was\nmore or less like a Kapo, responsible for the shift--for the night shift. And he came over to\nme. I...[ was not sleeping, probably, wherever he was slept in the same block. And he said,\n\"You speak Polish, no?\" I said, \"Sure.\u201d He says, \"Maybe, you know, when you see his\nnumber, you're gonna used to the names and you can tell those boys in Polish the number. It\nwill get used, that they will go a little bit faster.\u201d I told him, \"I can try.\u201d And at this time, I\nwas young. And had a very good memory, too, I remember. And they tried out with me,\nwhat it used to take three quarters of an hour or an hour. In the beginning, it was a little bit\nhard for me. But I still speeded up in half, and so forth. And everyday was always the same\nfaces and the same numbers--the Haftling numbers. I got used to it that actually I looked at\nthe face or at this number, and I knowed the coal mine mine number already. And I ask...\nAnd I used to cut this down to about...in no time--to a half hour, 15 minutes--practically\nimpossible. And I got to be famous over there for this. And the SS...and they know it. And\nthey start the same way to talk to me, being nice. I didn't have to march anymore; work like I\nwanted. And once in awhile they used to even to bring me a sandwich, even. To get me...\nYou know, that nobody sees it, I should hide it. And this went on; and I did my job, whatever\nI could. And I was pleased that the beating stopped a little bit. But in the coal mine...in the\ncamp, started to worse and worse and worse. And they used to get it the same way. Every\nmonth, they used to get in another transport actually. So they didn't need it any more people.\nThey didn't care. So every month...month, it was a selection. Uh, a high SS doctor came--\nofficer--came from Auschwitz. We had to go through in the evening without clothing,\neverything. And as soon somebody saw it is undernourished, so forth, he put him in the side;\nand right away to the crematorium. The trucks came the next day, and took them over. But\nthey got always new transports. So it was never a shortage in labor anymore. Uh...",

        "A: [...that he will call off 20 names.] [TEXT INPRECEDING BRACKETS DOES NOT\nAPPEAR ON VIDEOTAPE] And he will tell me the...the...the Haftlings number--you\nknow, the prison[er] number. And I should tell them the Kohlengrube [German: \"coal\nmine\"| number.",

        "A: Coal mine number. I was scared. I said, \"I can try.\u201d\u2019 And I passed it. I made it. So he took me\nto the kitchen. He gave me a whole bread and a whole sausage. This was like, somebody 1s...\n(Pointing at camera) He wants you to start again.",

        "A: Where should I pick up? Where...",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Yes. After I was helping by distributing the lamps. And apparently the guards told the\nLagerfuhrer, Kowol, about that I helped speed up with the giving out the lamps. One\nmorning, I was at the \"appell.\u201d I was called out to come to the Schriebstube. Normally, when\nthey called you out to go to the Scriebstube meant you did something wrong--you didn't\nperform your job in the coal mines, so forth. So they beat you up. Real beat you up! I know it\nthat I was a real good worker, was famous to be a real good worker in the coal mine. I didn't\ndo nothing wrong, and I couldn't understand why they called me to the Schreibstube. So I\ncame to the Schreibstube. I went in; and I was shivering, practically. And I saw the\nLagerfthrer; and I took off my cap, and I told him my number. You know, that I came to the\nSchreibstube [messen (ph)]. And he screamed at me...screamed, \"[Recheche (ph)] Jude!\"--\n\"Dirty Jew!\" And all kind names. \"[Alles maderer (ph)|!\" And I was shivering over there.\nBut I...Carl [Xkrimmer (ph)], the arbeit [NB: \"worker\"] in the Schreibstube, [Phrase given in\nYiddish, not deciferable]. He showed me that I shouldn't be scared. I should calm down.\nFinally, he [NB: Kowol] start to ask me questions to where I am from my home...with my\nhome, what my parents did, what I did. And I told him. Then I couldn't figure it out. I says,\n\"What does he wanted from me? I gonna be released? Maybe my brother...some bribed\nsomebody, or whatever.\u201d Then he said, \"You helping out those boys giving out those\nlamps.\u201d I said, \"Yes.\u201d He said, \"If I will call 20 names, I will tell you the prison number--the\nKZ number. Can you tell me the coal mine number?\" I was scared. I said, \"I can try.\u201d So he\nbrought the book, and he called off those names; and I could finish...could tell him all names\nfrom the coal mine the numbers. He was very impressed with me. So he called me in to the\nkitchen. He said to follow him. We went into the kitchen. He told the chef from the kitchen\nto bring out a bread. A whole loaf of bread! And a whole big sausage. And he said, \"Hide\nit...to behind...\u201d To hide it behind my uniform. And when I came in...in the block, the other\nhad been already asleep. Except my friends, what I been very close with them. They had\nbeen so scared that I get beaten to death, or whatsoever. And they stood, and they shivered.\nAnd I go to the bed; and I pull out the bread, and I pull out the sausage. This was probably\nmore than 50--not millions, but billion--dollars, to say it for us. We divided with each other.\nAnd it was unbelievable. After a week, two, then by the \"appell,\" the same way the\nLagerfuhrer called my name; and he said I don't go anymore to the coal mine. I should be...\nwork in the camp. So he want me that I take care of the books in the coal mine with the SS.\nBecause the coal mine paid the SS [the] salary for all prisoners. The KZ prisoners. I kept\nthose books. And I had to go every day, count how many people in each block; and\ngive...uh...the amount to the kitchen, that they can...what they prepare more or less food. So\nthey know it how much food, whatever, to prepare. And they told me that I can go take a\nbath whenever I wanted, a shower, so forth. And I will get better food. I don't have to eat\nfood with every prisoner, when they come. I get the food. And the same way 1n the block.\nNobody will bother me, and so forth. But it was one...uh...Blockfithrer, he was a SS. He used\nto inspect the blocks. He was a...from Rumania, an SS. His name was [Drashner (ph). And,\nI remember, he always... He know that the Lagerfuhrer more or less liked me, 1n some\ndegree. And he...when nobody saw it, he used to beat me. I always was mad. I had in the\ncoal mine...I didn't hate it. I got...was used to work, and I was treated by the Polaks--by the\ncivil-- pretty good; and I didn't have it so bad. And I said, \"Why didn't I stay in the coal\nmine, where there better than this be here? Be always for him...\u201d He always used to say that\nI'm a... Because I did...I had the paper work to do with the books; and he said that I'm...uh...a\nspy. He always came and checked my papers, and look behind...uh...my mattress, to see if he\ncan find something there--a spy. Later, when I requested that I want to go back to the coal\nmine, he says, \"See, he is a spy! Because who had it so nice, who... Why does he want it to\ngo back to the coal mine?\" Is what he said to the other SS. And they used to have fight with\neach other. The [Drashner (ph)] with the Lagerfthrer. He even went to the higher Gestapo,\nand he told them that he [NB: Kowol] neglects the camp. He runs around with woman. He\nalways drunk...and he like me. He likes me. He doesn't bother... You know, something\nkilling, so forth. So they even transferred him to some elsewhere. I don't know where. And it\ncame...from Auschwitz, came another SS Lagerfthrer for the camp. For some reason, this\nwent on for awhile. And I was assigned back to the coal mine. I went back to the coal mine;\nbut they all, from the camp, and the workers...they all respect me. They all used to help me.\nLike, uh, from the Bekleidungskammer, [where] they give out the Kleidungs [Ger:\n\"clothing\"]. Paul Leventhal--es leben gebliben; es ein gans gr\u00e9sse [Yiddish: \"he survived,\nhe's a fat goose\"]... He's a big man 1n...in the Czechoslovakai [NB: Czechoslovakia]. Yeah.\nAnd [Von Baden (ph)], [undeciferable Yiddish phrase]. They all know me. So they used to\nhelp me some degree. And I went back to the coal mine, and I worked over there again until\nthe end of '44. This was around December, when the Russian invasion started. Then\nsuddenly they said that we're gonna be evacuated. The...those all who worked in the camp,\nthe besserer--those who had been treated better a little bit--we already talk maybe to\nescape...to try to dig a bunker or whatever. But it didn't materialize, because the time was too\nshort. We had been scared a little bit, too. And finally, the end of '44-- it was around\nChristmastime--they evacuate us.\u201d We had been told to take our clothing and one blanket,\nand take it along. So we marched until...through the night, all night; they even ...they let us\nrest a little bit. We laid down in the snow. It was snow already on the ground. And the next\nday, finally, they put us on cattle wagons; and they brought us to Buchenwald. In...from\nBuchenwald, they sent me again to Troglitz--a subcamp in Buchenwald. This was Tr\u00e9glitz.\u00b0\nThis was not far away from Leipzig, where I met over there a friend from me--he is from\nLeipzig--who lives also in Washington. His name is Bernard Federman. We kept a little bit\ntogether more or less. But this Troglitz was terrible. It was like...uh....no work, no food, no\nbath. In Auschwitz, we used to be very clean. They used to kill you if you didn't kept...didn't\nkept yourself clean. And Troglitz was just the opposite. Whatever you were in, you wore. In\nthe same way, even to work...when they took us to work, they... It was over there...uh...a\nrefinery where they used to make gasoline and coals, the Germans. And the refinery was\nbombardiered--was bombed through the Allies. They made us clean up today, from here to\nthis area. The next day they took us...told us to take back from over there to go back to this\narea. They just make us miserable so bad. And the little food what they gave us, terrible.\nThey didn't have even water. Even somebody want to wash themself didn't get even no\nwater. In the beginning, we used to take our black water, whatever they called it--\"coffee\"--\nwhat we got in the morning. Our ration. We used to wash ourself. We sacrificed ourself, we\nused to try to wash ourself. And finally, one time I remember we have been in the Baustelle\n> The evacuation from Jawischowitz actually began on January 19, 1945.\n\u00b0 Subcamp of Buchenwald. Located in the Sachsen Province (Prussia). Evacuated April 9, 1945.\nPrisoners were sent 1n the direction of Ort Wittenberg.\n[Ger: \"site\" ], where we worked over there; and the SS, even, was dirty. And it was\nwintertime, in January. It was real, real cold. We asked the SS...we saw over there they had a\nwell with pumping water. They had water over there. We asked SS if they would allow us to\ngo to wash ourself, because we don't have no water inside the camp. And they said, \"Yes.\u201d\nSo we took off our clothes, and we washed ourself without clothing. They couldn't believe it,\nthat we are able to do something like this. And they looked like real different people. Those\nall other people, they're black. Got baked in in their skin. And they used to treat them worse,\nreal bad. Because they said, \"You see? They can wash themself. You don't care anymore.\u201d\nThey used to beat the other one, who was there a longer time. [They] used to be mad at us,\nbecause they said, \"You just wait. You gonna be here a little while longer. You gonna get\nlike we, too.\u201d Which was true. It didn't took too long, we got to the same point. We didn't\ncare anymore. We couldn't walk practically on our feet, nothing, anymore. And we...the\nworse thing was, over there, every day used to be where they have the gate where we\nmarched out to work and come in to work. They used to stack up the dead ones who died on\nthe way. They used to stack them about...uh...six...four, stx meter hoych...uh, high--the dead\nbodies; because they ready, you know, to take them away to crematorium. When we\nalways...we went out to work, the SS told us to take along a little wagon, four-wheel wagon.\nAnd we didn't know it what for, but later I realized. Because those people who died on the\nway or on the working place, we had to take the dead bodies back to the camp. And we\nalways been scared, we know it: if...1f we gonna be forced to pull dead bodies, the next day\nwe will not be anymore able to make it anymore. And we know it. And we used to try\neverything just to run away; not to be...not to pull this wagon. We succeeded. One time, I\nremember I went...I was assigned... I gave away my rations to a one from the camp to...who\ndid assign you to go out to a Dachdecker [German: \"roofer\"]. To cover the roof--bombed,\nuh... Roofs that had been bombarded. We could cover it. So we had a chance. We come\namong civilians, German civilians; and once in awhile they give us, by themselves,\nsomething to eat. Or if we couldn't, we used always to go to cover the...the roof; and we\ncould see always they had...uh...piled up like flour, or onions, or whatever. We used to steal\na little bit to take it along to the camp. This helped us something. This went on until April;\nmore or less like April. In April in '45, the same way, they said we getting evacuated from\nTroglitz, we didn't know it where.\u2019 But we know it that we are pretty close to liberation. We\nheard it already. The same way they took us to wagons, they put us on the wagons. They\ntook us I don't know how far. We thought it may be 10, 20 miles away...30 miles, whatever.\nAnd when it got dark, they told us... No, we stayed there on wagons; but the next day when it\ngot daybreak, it was around woods. And they said we could go out and spend time in the\nwoods; but in the evening, before it got dark, we had to go back on the wagons. And food\ngot to be very, very little. It was not anymore food. We could see even that the guards, the...it\nwas already Wehrmacht--elderly guards, actually. They didn't had too much to eat anymore,\nnot too much. We didn't expect anymore too much. It was not to do it. Once in awhile, they\ngave us some (pause) raw...uh... I.... don't know how you call it. In Poland...in Yiddish, we\nused to call it \"kukuryze\" (Or, Pol: kukurydza) [Trans: \"maize, corn\"| Was a food like,\n\u2019 Troglitz was evauated April 9, 1945.\nmore or less, for animals--or real poor people ate this. They usually give us...we had a\nhand...two handfuls, like this. We got a little bit water...uh...portion allowed; you know, to\nbring a bucket of water to each wagon in the evening. This was all. Otherwise, we used to\nopen our mouths when it was raining. We were after Moses, how we had our water. One\ntime we have been in the woods; and we could see the..those old guards. They didn't care too\nmuch anymore. So we had been 3 of us. We said, \"Let's sneak away.\u201d Their barometer was\nfouled up. We always say we go we pick up some wood, want burn...warm up a little bit\nwater. They let us do it. And we sneaked out. We sneaked out; we came... One time we had\nbeen already out, you know, in the area. I remember we stayed overnight in the woods far\naway a little bit. A couple of miles away from over there. And we tried to fall asleep, but it\nwas so cold. It was a fast fall. We couldn't fall asleep. So we made out that every few\nminutes--5, 10 minutes--one should go in the center, where it's a little bit warmer. And we\nwarm each other, and maybe we...to get a chance. You know, that we have a chance to warm\nup. And...uh...the morning we got up, we couldn't sleep. And finally we said we have to go\nto try, you know, to shnorr, or something--you know, to beg. We saw some houses. So we,\nmore or less... those two who looked more or less half-decent--like civil[ians]--they couldn't\nrecognize that we had been KZ prisoners. We made them that they could go and beg for\nsome food; and if they have some food, they will come. They will give me, too; and bring it.\nAnd they went out for food. And for some reason, they got caught. Somebody on a\nmotorcycle--an SS, whoever it was--caught them. They asked them if it's more people that he\nknows. And he says, \"Yes, somebody 1s in the wood.\u201d So when they showed where...where I\nam, more or less. And I, meanwhile...the sun came up, and I fall asleep. When I woke up, I\nsaw those two came back and two Volkssturm.\u00ae They been Volkssturm--means they\nmobilize people. You know, they had not been able anymore to the army to go; but for\nthings like this, to protect the country more or less... With two rifles. And they come over to\nme, and they say with rifles, \"Get up.\u201d\u2019 And I said--this must be that two, three days that we\nactually we didn't have nothing to eat and nothing to drink. But period, nothing. And when I\nfall asleep over there and he said with the rifle to get up, I tried to get up. I tried to stay on\nmy legs. I fall back down. He say they gonna shot me. I said, \"What's wrong with this?\" To\nshoot you was like you give a kid...uh...a candy! But they didn't shot me. And I tried again\nand again. And so they didn't have no food whatever. So one talked to the other one, and\ntalked it over; and they went into..uh..a private home somewhere--was not far away--and one\ncame with two carrots, raw carrots. And he gave me the two carrots. I ate those two carrots;\nand I could walk. Stand on my feet, and walk like any normal person. I still don't believe\nmyself, even, this. They took us back to the camp, to make it short. So they came the\nLagerfuhrer, a high SS man. He says, \"Why did you run away?\" All of us, we...we told him,\n\"We didn't run away. We just wanted to beg for food and come back.\u201d And he...he\ndoes...does it like that (gesturing), and...he says, \"You think I am not hungry?!\" Something\nlike this. And he says, \"7 o'clock, you get shot.\u201d Again, do me a favor! All right.\n* Volkssturm (People's Militia) was organized in October 1944 and made up largely of boys and\nolder men, men between the ages of 16 and 60 who had not otherwise been called up to serve in\nother units of the German Armed Forces.\nBut...uh...the guards, they know...they help...they got their rations 6 o'clock. And they didn't\ncare anymore. So they run for their rations. They know it if they don't go for their rations,\nthey will not have it. So they let us alone. They run for their rations; and we run to the\nwagons. And the other guys, we told them we are set up to be shot at 7 o'clock. And they\nthink when we go on the wagons, they will not know who it was, or whatever. And the guy\nwho was in charge--for each wagon, was a guard in charge--he said, \"No.\u201d He got all the\npeople. He doesn't need anymore. He count them, always, in the evening. But they sat on\neach other, to hide them. He said, \"No, we need them.\u201d So they pulled us in the wagon.\nThat's all. A day, two, later... One time, uh...we saw planes coming. When the planes are\ncoming was the same way like...like the Messiah come. We had the nice face like normal\npeople--smiling, bright smiling. And here the guards, the SS and those lot, they keep on\nlooking; and they really, they bombed the wagons...the wagons. And there, they first they\nrun away--those guards. And we had to run away; although we had been legal, actually. No,\nwe could run away. We hanged around in the woods here and there. And then they come\nagain. They start to gather us and bring us back. And, uh, they brought us back. I\nremember...I don't remember what town it was. A little German town. I know it was in the\nfront a restaurant, in the back was a large backyard. They brought us over there. And it's\nmeant like: somebody goes here, somebody here, somebody here, somebody here. And sure\nenough, we saw it. One side, actually--took us to the other side, not where I was--they shot\nthem like nothing. Everybody just...you didn't hear even a scream, not a... Like nothing\nhappened. You just saw them lying dead, all of them. They put us on wagons again. No, they\nmarched us. Meant that we have to walk. But on the way, so long we have been marching.\nYou...they allowed you to march. You didn't get no food, no nothing; but they...you could\nmarch. But if you couldn't march anymore, whatever...shot you. So both sides of the road\nbeen full with dead bodies. We didn't realize, but later we hear they keep on shooting. So we\nrealized. The beginning, we didn't know why it was so many dead bodies. We realized what\nhad happened. In Troglitz was 4, 5 thousand people alive--maybe. But when we came back\nover there to our...again to the Sammelpunkt [German: \"collecting place\" ], where they\ngathered us all together, maybe was 200. I don't know. It's hard to tell. It was not too many.\nAll other have been in the...in the side of the ditches. And this, I believe, was Leitmeritz\n[NB: Litom _ice].\u2019 Leitmeritz: the same way, no floor. You have a barrack, and they had\neverything terrible. Uh, but...uh... they didn't beat you, nothing. They...they said, \"The\nmorning, you're gonna get coffee.\u201d We didn't hear anymore about bread, even; but \"You\ngonna get coffee.\u201d And we carried around always a rusted can, you know. And we couldn't\npractically sleep the whole night. We waited already to get something a little bit warm in our\nmouth. True enough, early in the morning, they said we get the coffee. Everybody runs,\ndidn't took no chances to wait. Everybody wanted to be first. And we got over there. And I\ngot the coffee, whatever; and I dranked it down quick. Then they tell us, \"All you...you\ngonna be taken to Theresienstadt [NB: Terezin]. This is a sanitorium. It's not anymore a\nconcentration camp. You're gonna be treated like people. Oh, you don't know how lucky you\nall are!\" You know. But...uh...after I drank, suddenly I got diarrhea. I got diarrhea, and I\n\u00b0 Subcamp of Flossenbiirg. Located in Czechoslovakia.\ncouldn't stay on my legs anymore. But I had two good friends, what I had been with them\ntogether in Auschwitz--[Yankin (ph)]| and another. They say, \"Mietek, [Three or four\nYiddish sentences follow, which are undeciferable].\u201d Theresienstadt...we saw it, more or\nless. We saw it like people; because we didn't look like people. This is the truth. We didn't\nlook...when they looked at us, they got scared. They run. They run away. And here, if they\npass by like with food supplies what they cared to give out for the people, those people\nattacked. I mean, I couldn't...I couldn't walk... They attacked, and they grabbed whatever\nthey could. So we...we even looked like a wild, wild animals. I'm not talking about humans\nat all. When we came in, I was in very bad shape. And we was in the block, suddenly. And\nthey start a little bit...they said, \"You'll get a little bit food.\u201d We got a little bit food, here and\nthere. They kept us waiting. They start to disinfect...disinfection us... You know, all kind\nwoman came. They shaved us all the way, everywhere. And they gave us, more or less,\nclothes...new clothing. I mean, clean clothing. Because ours was terrible. Because we never\nchanged. I was over there [NB: in Tro\u00e9glitz] over 3 months. We never had a different shirt.\nWhatever we got in the beginning, this...this...we had it all the time on. And so they more or\nless disinfect us a little bit. And it's... But people kept on dying and dying and dying, if you\neat something. But I didn't cared. I kept on...kept on eating and eating; and I kept on feeling\nbetter and better. And I felt, actually, that I start to get a little bit more to myself...to be\nmyself. And for some reason, always they picked me...they picked me. They needed over\nthere to keep an eye to give out the supply ...food supply, what it came from the Red Cross.\nFrom Switzerland, from Sweden. That I should help over there giving it out. Alright, I came\nover there. And over there was from the best breads, from the best butters, from the\nbest..uh..sausages. You name it. Over there was...was it, over there. Only thing you...1f you\ncould eat it. And who could eat it, everybody really got real ...like normal; strong back. And\nfor some reason, I had to go in the same way; count always the people in the blocks, where\nwe supplied them with food. And I don't know what it happened. Suddenly, I lost mine\nappetite. I couldn't eat anymore. And they put me over there, like in a hospital. Was no\ndoctors, no taking care. You just laid. You wait until you drop dead, because everyday\nwhatever they put in over there is very seldom somebody walked out from it. And I was over\nthere, didn't had no treatment. No, I didn't know what it was 'til today. But I know one thing.\nWhenever I could have the best food and eating, was my...my mouth was locked up--like\nwith a lock.\u201d I used to take, along a park, Theresienstadt. They still had parks. And I said, \"I\ngo in fresh air, sit on a bench. Maybe I'll be able [to eat].\u201d\u201d Nothing helped. I was over there\nmaybe a week, laying around. And I still don't know--I had a chance to walk out to over\nthere, and I could walk already. My appetite start to come little by little. I... know I never\nfight for my life, actually. In fact, I was upset why I am alive. It was much more better\npeople than me. (Long pause - crying). Yeah, then...then I was tried to go to Poland back. I\nthought for a few or maybe I found a brother or something. I had still brothers, two sisters.\nSomebody. And I was in Radomsko--this is about 20 miles from Przedborz--and I tried to go\nin. On the way, I recognized one who used to work in the factory for us. And I called his\nname. And I said, \"[Piogotski (ph)|!\" This was his name. So he came...he passed by with\n'\u00b0 This would seem to suggest Tetanus--also known as \"Lockjaw.\"\nhorses with a carriage, with a wagon. And he said--the first thing what he asked me, \"You\nstill ywy [Pol]?!\" That means, \"You are...are you alive?!\" Like I shouldn't live over there.\nAnd then he told me about Przedborz, it was 12 people. They had been, more or less, like\nunterwald Jewish people, you know. You know people, who didn't bother... didn't care. They\njust...you know, they have been...were hidden among Poles, didn't say they're Jews. They\nsurvived. They used to live in a one Jewish home over there in Przedborz. And one night, the\nPoles came...the AK--Armia Krajowa. It's a Polish extreme radical organization. They killed\nall 12. They put up sacks on their heads, and with axes. So he told me, \"It's not too safe for\nyou to go back home.\u201d A woman saw I had the conversation and I start to cry. And I\ntold...uh...to this [Piogotski (ph)], I told him in Polish...I told him, \"You know that I didn't go\nto Auschwitz as a Jew.\u201d It was not... It was true. Because I was involved, I listened always,\nyou know, to BBC. This was everything... When the SS men, they examined--the\nGendarmerie, you know--this was all written in. And I told him, \"I went to Auschwitz...uh,\nlike...as a Pole! And now I cannot go back?\" And I start to cry, and I practically spit on him.\nSo the woman came out, and she said... And I told her what's happen; and she said, \"Please,\ndo me a favor. If you want go, go to a big city. Go to Warsaw. Go to _6d_--Litzmannstadt.\nBut you cannot go to Przedborz.\u201d So in the morning ...and she took me in, in her house, and I\nslept the night; and the morning, I went back to the train. And I went back to Prague, to\nCzechoslovakia. When I came to Czechoslovakia, I met other friends who survived in\nAuschwitz; and they went home to...to Belgium. They told me, \"Come. Come along.\u201d They\nknow it I don't have nobody. They said, \"Why don't you come along...come with us to\nBelgium?\" I said, \"Okay.\u201d So they told me...they gave me a few hints--cities. They says,\n\"When the Consul ask you, you tell them, you know, this and this and this.\u201d And I come to\nthe Consul, whatever. He asks me other questions [than] what they told me. So he said, \"You\nare not from Belgium.\u201d So, no, I didn't pass. I couldn't go. So they told me, \"Go to a\nsanitorium over there,\" where they have been. He says, \"Over there, they treat you real, real\ngood. And real nice.\u201d Then he gave me the address, and I went over there to the sanitortum.\nThey told me, \"Don't say you are from Poland.\u201d They say, \"If you're from Poland...\u201d They\nhave...uh, skirmishes--the Polish army with the Czech army--at this time. Must have been\nin...1n May '45. And so I said, \"Okay.\u201d I came to the sanitorium. They asked me, \"From\nwhere you are?\" And I told them I am from Hannover, in Germany. And they took me in.\nAnd the Czech people, it's unbelievable how decent and good people. I never saw it, and I\ncouldn't believe it, how they treat me. Finally, a doctor examined me; and he told me that\nmine heart is enlarged. This comes from hunger. He told me not to walk steps, this and this.\nAnd I ask him...I ask him, \"Is this forever?\" He said, \"No. It's not to say. If you in normal\nconditions, maybe it goes back to normal.\u201d But this was the first time I was examined. I was\nover there for about 4 weeks. And I look... I couldn't recognize myself. Used...Mrs. Benes\none time came to see us. Young girls used to come. And we still have been our head shaved.\nWe didn't look...we looked half-human. They used to say how beautiful we are. It's\nunbelievable how decent, good people they are. (Crying) Okay, this was actually in there, I\nused to go out already in Prague. And I always...I didn't care to be on the...the Russian side.\nAnd we used to hear always...used to come in the other occupation to the American side.\nAnd they used to say that, you know, that they're treated real nice. The Army take care, and\nso forth. And I...I yust didn't like to see Russian soldiers, to be honest. So I went to an\norganization where they send you home from wherever you are. So I went to this\norganization, said I want to... I told them I want to go back home; because Hannover, I think,\nwas under the British, even. And they said, \"Oh, to Hannover, they have only 1 month a\ntransport. You would have to wait 2, 3 more weeks.\u201d Then was over there a German. And he\nsays he drives his car to Stuttgart. He drives to Stuttgart; and he says, \"It's on the way.\u201d He\nsays, \"At least you'll be closer.\u201d I didn't know it the difference between Stuttgart and\nHannover. So I...he offered me. I says, \"Okay.\u201d So he took me along; and I ended up in...in\nAus...in Stuttgart. In Stuttgart, first...uh...they send me over there. It was a organization for\nKZ,'' and Germans also. They send me...they gave me food and they send me to sleep in a\nschool somewhere. It was...uh, it was at least...uh, uh...human, more or less. In the morning, I\nwent out to the city a little bit, looked around. And right away, it was other ones. They...we\nrecognize each other. And they...they said, \"It's from...from KZ?\" And I said, \"Yes.\u201d He\nsaid...they asked me, \"From where? From what?\" I told them everything. He said, \"Where\nyou stay?\" And I told them the [Akuptschule (ph)|. \"Oh!\" He told me, \"Go take the street\ncar!\" They took...they helped me. They showed me where to go, what to go. They took me\nto Degerloch;'\u201d and [in] Degerloch was uh Katz Sanitorium. Degerloch is also outside\nStuttgart. Outside Stuttgart; and 1t was over there a sanitortum. The... the US...uh, Army...\nOver there was for Germans, the sanatorium. So he chased...they chased them out; and they\ntold all...I think, KZ...those all prisoners from KZ. And the German government had to\nsupply us with the best food, with the best in everything. Everything the best. And over there\nwas really...you know, got back to normal. And I looked more like a human. And everything\ngot back to normal.",
        "A: When I wasn't in...in the sanitortum--Katz Sanitortum was the name. The one who was in\ncharge of the food supply, he went to America. This was a event already in '45; must be in\nAmerica. So they looked for somebody; and the same way, I didn't volunteer. I didn't go\nnowhere. I don't know why. And they came to me. And they told me...you know, they want\nme that I will be in charge for the supplies from the IRA\u2018 and I should give out all\nprovisions to those who live over there in the sanitorium. And I was never somebody that\nwho knowed too much what...uh...to do business with other. I was too naive, very simple.\nAnd I wanted always constantly working, actually. I went to work. So I went to work over\nthere... uh...off in IRA. Mrs. Greenbaum, she worked for IRA. She was a United States\ncitizen. She came over from here to helping IRA. And I got along with her real, real good.\na g., for former concentration camp inmates.\n'? A suburb of Stuttgart.\n\u00b0 Actually, IRO: International Refugee Organization. The IRO took over the functions of\nUNRRA with respect to refugee matters on July 1, 1947.",
        "A: I went out...when they liquidated, actually, the camp--Degerloch. They gave back the\nsanitorium to Katz, actually; they gave him back everything. And they said, \"Whoever\nwant...you want live private, you go and live private. You want go to Reinsburgstrasse, ...\u201d\nThe Reinsburg Street 1s where was the other DP, the main DP camp. In Stuttgart, was on the\nReinsburg Street. \"...you can go live over there.\u201d Uh, so I choose...I was living private. And I\nwas actually... First, I figured I have a brother in Israel. I was now in contact with him. And I\nfigured I will go to Israel. Then I changed my mind. The reason was, because I know it that\nhe is over there not so well off. He's just working.
