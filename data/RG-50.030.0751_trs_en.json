And I don't remember that I started\nschool.",

        "A: It's too early. And then from there -- I heard somebody say \"it's fire, it's war.\" We\nwanted to Uzbekistan. And my mother brought in a farm. She was collecting tomatoes.",
        "Q: Harvesting tomatoes.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. But I remember it was a frightening experience, because you know at\nthat time was already -- right before this my brother got sick before we went to\nUzbekistan. He got sick -- I don't remember she had a chance to take him to the hospital,\nno? Maybe she took him to the hospital, but he stayed there for a very short time. He\ndied. After he died, I got rheumatic fever.",
        "Q: You got rheumatic fever?",
        "A: Yeah. They took me to the hospital. When I was the last one, they put me in. It\nsecluded -- seclusion, because it was very contagious, and they didn't give us antibiotic.\nThey didn't have at that time. So they put me on the second, third floor where they were.\nThey didn't let in my mother to go in. And I was standing on the steps to talking down\nfrom the window and talking sign language with my mother. One thing I remember\nsomething was my mother -- the nurses came in and gave me a plate with a beautiful\ntangerines -- mandarinos or something -- which in Russia, it was very unusual -- the war,\nwinter especially -- they said, \"That's from your mother -- you eat it.\" So this I remember\nwas long time, over 40 days that I stayed there.",

        "A: Yiddish.",
        "Q: You spoke Yiddish with her.",
        "A: Yeah. And then, after my brother died, we decided to go to Uzbekistan. We went to\nUzbekistan. She was working for an Uzbek. His whole head was bald, but the only thing\nthat I remember 1s a beautiful braid -- a long, long braid. And he had a very big\nmustache, but the head was bald.",
        "Q: So a bald head with a braid.",
        "A: Yeah -- one braid -- a long braid from the center. And he had a mustache, you know\u201d?\nHe had -- so she was working in the field, and I was running around. And [laughing] it\nwas -- I did a mischief. I came over. I grabbed a beautiful tomato, and I bite the end.\nAnd that guy, Uzbek, came with a piece of wood, and he warned me, if I do it again, he\nwill beat me up. He scared me. This face -- his face Iremember. That I remember. So\nwe stay about -- and then we went back to Chelyabinsk.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- he also joined when he came to Poland. So we decided to go to Germany, and we\nstayed in Pocking. But my aunt, Hannah -- she stayed. She was left in Poland for a while.\nI don't know what was the reason. I think her husband started the war there or something.\nSo she said, \"You go. I will join you later.\" So we were in Pocking. And I know their\ndesire was, because every Friday they used to get together and were singing and dancing.\nSo my mother and father heard that there is a group that came from Palestine. And they\nare trying to arrange a group of people that they want to go to Palestine. So we -- we\njoined the group. We signed up. Not everybody was accepted. But they were making a\nbig, big group of people to form the ship to show the world against whom are the British\nfighting? Because the British didn't let the Jewish people to come to Palestine. And they\nwere supporting the Arabs. They tried to prevent the Jewish people to come, but they\ndidn't want to let them take over the land. So --",
        "Q: And where -- if you were in a DP camp in Germany, how do you get to a boat? How\ndid that happen?",

So he went\nto Marseille.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of what Marseille looked like?",
        "A: I think we came at night that time and they told us that we had to -- at night in the\nevening we had to one day go to the boat and -- what I remember is the boat was staying\nnot far from the beach in Marseille.

        "A: Yes.",

And my cousin -- my uncle that she married --\nand the woman, she had a boy. So he walked -- I mean, my mother walked. My father\nwalked. My uncle walked. And we walked the first, I think. And the boy, his name is\nalso Moishe. He walked before me. And he showed that he was courageous, because I\nwas afraid to walk on there. And he walked. And I was look -- he told me not to look\ndown to the ocean, not to look to the sides. Just to look at the person -- follow my eyes\nthe person that walking. So I was looking at my cousin. He was walk straight. And so,\nhe showed himself, you know, courageous. So I -- walked after him. It looked like -- it\npassed like a whole month -- you know, because it was very scary.",
        "Q: When you're little and there's water on both sides.",
        "A: Not to look down, just to look sides.",
        "Q: And so, you got on the boat?",
        "A: Yes. But I forgot to tell that my sister -- step-sister -- was born in Bratslav. And she\nwas little that time I think -- two years or something. So he was walking, and he had a\nbag, you know? Bag with stripes. And this was tied potty for a child, you know?\n[laughing] It's my cousin -- his name is Moishe. He used to call \"Moishe with the little\npotty.\" That's the name that was till he was the adult.",
        "Q: Really? Oh, he must have hated that name.",
        "A: The funny thing is I was watching him walking with this. I used to laugh to myself.\nThat is my memory of this. And I walked. I finally got to the ship. The ship was so big\nand crowded -- very crowded. And they put like shelves -- shelves, this, no more place.\nEverybody said, \"Go in the shelf and lay down.\" You know there was room. Many\npeople, they have to squeeze in. But my mother had belly so big, she couldn't go in. She\ndidn't have room to slide in.",
        "Q: That's right.",
        "A: So they let us sit on the floor near where you have to step off to the shelves. So I went\n-- entered the ship and we went there. Whoever was lucky could have slide in -- could\nhave laid down -- but we were sitting there.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they started to give out chocolate mint for the children, big pots. And every time\nthat they went near us thus far -- I mean, not every time, but it happened many times that\nthey slide or something and all chocolate fell --",
        "Q: Spills.",
        "A: Funny things that I remember. I think I don't want to remember the bad things what\nhappens.",
        "Q: Yeah. What was the name of the ship?",
        "A: The ship was Exodus.",
        "Q: So it was the Exodus ship?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: I didn't know that it was such an important name, but anyway, we were on the ship I\nremember. They accepted special families that there were pregnant women. A lot of\npregnant women. A lot of orphans, they survived the war, and they were -- their parents\nand everybody was killed. So there was a woman, she gave birth on the ship, but\nsomething got wrong. I don't know exactly what happened, but what I remember is a big\npiece of wood, and they put it near the edges of the ship. And she was laying on this.",
        "Q: She died?",
        "A: She died. And they slide her down. And I said, \"Oh my God -- my mother is also\npregnant.\" Since then, I had a horrible feeling that my mother is going to die also, and\nthey will slide her down. Thank God when the ship arrived -- but then they didn't let us\nin. The British -- the British.",
        "Q: They didn't?",
        "A: The British surrounded the ship the minute she left the port of Marseille, and they\nfollowed her. And that was the biggest ship that was supposed to (indecipherable), you\nknow? But they attacked the ship and corner of the ship was broken down, but they got\nthe ship inside. It was a big strong ship. And it was almost four and a half thousand\npeople -- something like this.

        "Q: That's right. They brought a stretcher?",
        "A: So my mother was on the stretcher. And my father was walking near the stretcher.\nAnd I couldn't walk there, because there was a lot of water in the ship. Ship started to get\nwater. It went up here, here, here, here. And [chuckling]. For me it was too deep,\nbecause I could have drowned. So I remember two people with uniforms. I think 1t was\nthe British people -- soldiers -- one of them took me on his arm, holding me. We were in\nGermany. They gave us portions, and they gave also cigarettes. And my mother told me\nshe had -- cigarettes 1s a good thing to bring to Palestine, because she can sell it and make\nsome money. I have very good coat. Nice coat. And I had a lot of pockets. And my\npockets were full of cigarettes she put. So she said because the suitcases -- whatever we\nhave -- they say to throw over the ship, and they will be picked up from other ships and\nwill be taken to Cypress. But she said, \"They won't throw me in the ocean -- on the port\non the ground.\"",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: When one of the soldiers picked me up somehow a pack of cigarettes start to fall\ndown and then another one. And they were joking saying, \"Look at this girl.\"",
        "Q: All the cigarettes.",
        "A: She may sell cigarettes or something. It was a funny moment, although I saw my\nmother's legs, she was in labor.",

        "Q: Person.",
        "A: -- yeah to get to the ground of Haifa. Because they were on the way, and they will\nsettle there. They didn't want to let them in in Palestine. They made up their minds. But\nthere were cases they had to, because some youngsters were wounded so bad that they\ngave immediate help. And my mother was this. She was in labor. And she was sinking\nin the water. I assume that the lower floors were full of water. Because I know they took\nme -- I didn't want it, but they lift me up in the arm and they took me to take me out. So\nyes. So they brought us to the Rambam Hospital. Rambam Hospital -- I believe I know\nit's a nice big hospital. But.",

They put our fingers, and they took pictures left,\nright, profiles and everything. And they sent us in Atlit. In Atlit, we were -- I don't know\n-- a few months, whatever. But, being in Atlit, we were listening to the radio. And they\nannounce that they decided to establish a Jewish state. But when I was in Atlit -- we\nwere in Atlit -- I saw many people started to dance and clap and everything. And it was a\nhappy occasion. And, you know, the people were unbelievable.

        "Q: [laughing] Never the right time. That's right.",
        "A: There's no happy medium, you know, between this and this. My kids grew up, and\nthen the grandchildren came. And I always said to him, \"I will go if you want to come.\"\nHe says he will not remember it. But you know what? He told me that this little town\ndidn't change much. Never did told me. Now, I didn't see my town that I was born. That\nI would like to see it -- yes.",

        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: -- seven years later than her. Beside that he was older than her at least 10, 12 years.",
        "Q: So he was almost 100 years old?",
        "A: Yes -- he was 97.5. But it's funny. His voice was unbelievable. He had a wonderful\nvoice. And wherever there was a chance, he used to sing. (indecipherable). But that was\nsuch a happy occasion. He used to sing, and everybody started to dance.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: People long in Philadelphia. Survivors group. It's called the New American Holocaust\nSurvivors -- yes. (indecipherable). Somebody was invited a few times there and\nwhatever and was occasionally started to sing and everybody clapped. He was a happy\nperson.",
        "Q: When I was talking with your husband, --",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: He didn't want to tell me and all the children. He couldn't talk.",
        "Q: And so, he didn't tell you details of what it's like?",
        "A: Lately he started to say \"When I was in the forest.\" It's not like -- like a history thing\nthat you tell this and this year -- a progressive. He remembers somebody told you that\nthey decided to talk now.",
        "Q: Well, not just now -- before -- a little bit earlier. But it had took many years. It was\nnot something that --",
        "A: Yes. They couldn't talk. They could not.",
        "Q: What about you? Did you tell your kids what your life was like until you got --",
        "A: I told them I was in the Exodus and that's it. I didn't talk much about it. But Exodus --\nI mean, Exodus was well-known ship.",
        "Q: Yeah. And there are, you know --",
        "A: And I -- I start to tell them I was in Exodus. And then they throw that woman that was\npregnant. She gave birth to a baby. She died. Yes.",
        "Q: And you saw them bury her at sea.",
        "A: Yeah, it was scary.",
        "Q: It was scary -- sad and scary.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is there some --",
        "A: My mother tells me that the people, some people that were from the Exodus and there\nwere some women that they -- after they left the Exodus that they gave birth, and this.\nSo, when they saw this, they say to her, \"So how are you doing after you have such a\ntrauma?\" She said, \"I'm trying to survive.\" Because they had their children with them.\nThey gave birth after. She was -- my mother started in nine month. Never happened\nwith her. Anyway, that is the story of Exodus. Yeah. I don't know how much in new\nmuseum. Did they have really -- did they have really places that they took pictures from\nthe boat or something? I don't know. I wanted to see that.",
        "Q: I don't know. There might be. But the post-war part of the story -- the post-war part\nof events is something that is not the main focus. The main focus is, of course, what\nhappens during the war and the Holocaust during the war. Is there anything you'd like to\nadd today that I didn't ask you about?",
        "A: What I want to add is that now I understand that the -- that the ship that was very\ncrowded and my parents, I mean, they're very uncomfortable sitting on the floor for the\nwhole trip. I mean, you couldn't stretch -- whatever -- it was there. But, after she came\nto Palestine, then we came Israel. She became a symbol of fighting the British\ngovernment. Although above her declaration was to give a state to the Jewish people, but\nit seems that the British ignored it. It's funny, because (indecipherable) was the first that\ncame out, now the Jewish people have to have a state of their own.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: And didn't -- didn't -- there's a lot to -- that the ship would be drowned. I know it was\nin water. When I came down the ship, they carried me out. Yeah. But that's the politics.\nYeah.",
        "Q: What would you want -- what would you want your grandkids and their kids and\nfuture generations to understand about your life, about the people of Israel who survived -\n- many who were survivors and who had come from World War II -- what would you\nwant them to understand about their lives?",
        "A: Nothing comes easy. Life 1s a battle, you know? It's a struggle. When you succeeded\nthis -- you succeed like they prove the whole world that the Jewish people are very\nstubborn and won't give up. Although, the British are very bad. I know that we lived\nthere -- my mother said that that was attack from the Arabs. Was fiery I think --\nsomething. And they -- there was an action -- something. And that was the time the\nJewish people --",
        "Q: Stop.",
        "A: Yes. And also there were a lot of crimes, a lot of -- that the people suffered a lot also.",
        "Q: Fight for the freedom.",
        "A: Yeah, oh -- the fight for the freedom, everything, yes. I remember that we came -- we\ncame and we lived at Haifa among the -- in the houses that the Arabs left; they run away.\nBut at nighttime, although the Arabs -- they had leaders -- and at nighttime they started to\ndissel [?], and they got together and tried to do different things to harm the Jewish\nsettlers. It wasn't easy.",
        "Q: So there wasn't security even there.",
        "A: No, there wasn't security. It was -- every day was a struggle --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- but you know.",
        "Q: But you had three children --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- who had their own children. So now you have a family that survived and thrived, it\nsounds like, you know?",
        "A: My poor mother -- she lost two boys. One younger than me a little bit and one, he was\na baby. She paid a lot. She used to call me, \"You are my only eye in my head.\" I said,\n\"Why? You have two eyes.\" And she said, \"No.\"",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: It's a shame.",
        "Q: Well, she did pay a price.",
        "A: Yeah. She did pay a price. But she -- she died in 1998. So Justin, you were already\nhow old? Six. >> Justin: Grandmother made it to my bar mitzvah.",
        "A: And how was he? How was it; do you remember? Huh? Perfect. He was such a\nhappy person. He was the center of a party -- always. That's what I remember. And my\nmother also had beautiful voice -- soprano -- which I remember. And then our Seder was\nvery nice. Our getting together and everything. I have a good memory from that. That's\nwhat it is. Thank God -- yes.",
        "Q: Broken?",
        "A: Yes. And although I have no brothers and sisters, but we had a nice life. And now we\nhave a nice life -- the children and their children.",
        "Q: Well, thank you.",

        "A: My husband also I told you about, he had a lot. He started as young boy and a long\ntime to struggle.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: [hope peace will be in the world. That will be the most thing that we can accomplish.",
        "Q: Okay. Thank you.",
        "A: Thank you very much.",
        "Q: Thank you very much.",
        "A: Yes. You know, I didn't want to talk, because I didn't see that I have all the picture\nstraight, you know? It was for me a little bit there, a little here, but it came.",
        "Q: It came.",
        "A: It came to me.",
        "Q: Thank you very much for what you shared. I mean, and it came well. We got a sense,\nand we got a picture of your life and your Exodus and your odyssey to Israel and beyond.\nSo thank you.",
        "A: You're welcome, and I appreciate you gave me those pictures. You developed the\nhistory. You got a view of the history. That's very nice.",

She was left in Poland for a while.\nI don't know what was the reason. I think her husband started the war there or something.\nSo she said, \"You go. I will join you later.\" So we were in Pocking. And I know their\ndesire was, because every Friday they used to get together and were singing and dancing.\nSo my mother and father heard that there is a group that came from Palestine. And they\nare trying to arrange a group of people that they want to go to Palestine. So we -- we\njoined the group. We signed up. Not everybody was accepted. But they were making a\nbig, big group of people to form the ship to show the world against whom are the British\nfighting? Because the British didn't let the Jewish people to come to Palestine. And they\nwere supporting the Arabs. They tried to prevent the Jewish people to come, but they\ndidn't want to let them take over the land. So --",

So he went\nto Marseille.",
        "A: I think we came at night that time and they told us that we had to -- at night in the\nevening we had to one day go to the boat and -- what I remember is the boat was staying\nnot far from the beach in Marseille. And they made like -- like, like a rub. How to say?\nWe put holes. It was a wooden --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And they say that everybody has to walk on this in order to get to the ship. It was a\nbig ship there I saw, but we have to walk. And my cousin -- my uncle that she married --\nand the woman, she had a boy. So he walked -- I mean, my mother walked. My father\nwalked. My uncle walked. And we walked the first, I think. And the boy, his name is\nalso Moishe. He walked before me. And he showed that he was courageous, because I\nwas afraid to walk on there. And he walked. And I was look -- he told me not to look\ndown to the ocean, not to look to the sides. Just to look at the person -- follow my eyes\nthe person that walking. So I was looking at my cousin. He was walk straight. And so,\nhe showed himself, you know, courageous. So I -- walked after him. It looked like -- it\npassed like a whole month -- you know, because it was very scary.",
        "A: Not to look down, just to look sides.",
        "A: Yes. But I forgot to tell that my sister -- step-sister -- was born in Bratslav. And she\nwas little that time I think -- two years or something. So he was walking, and he had a\nbag, you know? Bag with stripes. And this was tied potty for a child, you know?\n[laughing] It's my cousin -- his name is Moishe. He used to call \"Moishe with the little\npotty.\" That's the name that was till he was the adult.",
        "A: The funny thing is I was watching him walking with this. I used to laugh to myself.\nThat is my memory of this. And I walked. I finally got to the ship. The ship was so big\nand crowded -- very crowded. And they put like shelves -- shelves, this, no more place.\nEverybody said, \"Go in the shelf and lay down.\" You know there was room. Many\npeople, they have to squeeze in. But my mother had belly so big, she couldn't go in. She\ndidn't have room to slide in.",
        "A: So they let us sit on the floor near where you have to step off to the shelves. So I went\n-- entered the ship and we went there. Whoever was lucky could have slide in -- could\nhave laid down -- but we were sitting there.",
        "A: And they started to give out chocolate mint for the children, big pots. And every time\nthat they went near us thus far -- I mean, not every time, but it happened many times that\nthey slide or something and all chocolate fell --",
        "A: Funny things that I remember. I think I don't want to remember the bad things what\nhappens.",
        "A: The ship was Exodus.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I didn't know that it was such an important name, but anyway, we were on the ship I\nremember. They accepted special families that there were pregnant women. A lot of\npregnant women. A lot of orphans, they survived the war, and they were -- their parents\nand everybody was killed. So there was a woman, she gave birth on the ship, but\nsomething got wrong. I don't know exactly what happened, but what I remember is a big\npiece of wood, and they put it near the edges of the ship. And she was laying on this.",
        "A: She died. And they slide her down. And I said, \"Oh my God -- my mother is also\npregnant.\" Since then, I had a horrible feeling that my mother is going to die also, and\nthey will slide her down. Thank God when the ship arrived -- but then they didn't let us\nin. The British -- the British.",
        "A: The British surrounded the ship the minute she left the port of Marseille, and they\nfollowed her. And that was the biggest ship that was supposed to (indecipherable), you\nknow? But they attacked the ship and corner of the ship was broken down, but they got\nthe ship inside. It was a big strong ship. And it was almost four and a half thousand\npeople -- something like this. But anyway. The ship did not drown. The ship didn't\ndrown.",
        "A: Didn't sink. And we came in. There was few wounded. There were young people\nthat they were fighting in the building. They were throwing fish or -- different cans of\nthis. And they were fighting the British. And the British were throwing tear gas and\nusing tear gas, smoke, and smoke -- yes -- and different things.",
        "A: Yeah. On the ship -- yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but they didn't want to let us in. They didn't want to enlarge the population of\nJewish in Palestine. And I remember they brought -- what they call 1t when you lay down\na sick person? The stretcher?",
        "A: So my mother was on the stretcher. And my father was walking near the stretcher.\nAnd I couldn't walk there, because there was a lot of water in the ship. Ship started to get\nwater. It went up here, here, here, here. And [chuckling]. For me it was too deep,\nbecause I could have drowned. So I remember two people with uniforms. I think 1t was\nthe British people -- soldiers -- one of them took me on his arm, holding me. We were in\nGermany. They gave us portions, and they gave also cigarettes. And my mother told me\nshe had -- cigarettes 1s a good thing to bring to Palestine, because she can sell it and make\nsome money. I have very good coat. Nice coat. And I had a lot of pockets. And my\npockets were full of cigarettes she put. So she said because the suitcases -- whatever we\nhave -- they say to throw over the ship, and they will be picked up from other ships and\nwill be taken to Cypress. But she said, \"They won't throw me in the ocean -- on the port\non the ground.\"",
        "A: When one of the soldiers picked me up somehow a pack of cigarettes start to fall\ndown and then another one. And they were joking saying, \"Look at this girl.\"",
        "A: She may sell cigarettes or something. It was a funny moment, although I saw my\nmother's legs, she was in labor.",
        "A: She was in very bad pain crying. It was the time. And also the smoke that was on the\nship and the noise, this caused her maybe earlier -- the beginning of the ninth month or\nsomething. So it was scary, and it was funny, because I didn't know that my mother\nputted pockets in the lining --",
        "A: -- to be able to --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They boarded to the ship -- yeah. They boarded the ship. They boarded to prevent\nevery single --",
        "A: -- yeah to get to the ground of Haifa. Because they were on the way, and they will\nsettle there. They didn't want to let them in in Palestine. They made up their minds. But\nthere were cases they had to, because some youngsters were wounded so bad that they\ngave immediate help. And my mother was this. She was in labor. And she was sinking\nin the water. I assume that the lower floors were full of water. Because I know they took\nme -- I didn't want it, but they lift me up in the arm and they took me to take me out. So\nyes. So they brought us to the Rambam Hospital. Rambam Hospital -- I believe I know\nit's a nice big hospital. But.",
        "A: In Haifa.",
        "A: They let us in at Haifa, because they couldn't take us right away back to --",
        "A: Yeah. And they left us, and left a few -- tens of youngsters. They were wounded.",
        "A: I know some were dead later on I heard. But -- and they brought us to the hospital --\nRambam Hospital.",
        "A: She gave birth. It was a boy. And he survived maybe one day or two and he died. He\nwas poisoned with the smoke and all the gases that they said they -- they put gas I heard\nit. In Germany, the concentration camp, they took people to the gas chambers.",
        "A: I thought that my mother -- she was horrible. I was afraid that they would throw her in\nthe ocean like the other woman.",
        "A: She was in labor. But, you know, good thing that she survived. But there were other\nwomen that they gave birth on the ship and was fine. So we were in the Rambam\nHospital a while. And she gave birth, but the baby died. At the time that my mother was\nin the ship. And we were in the ship. And they let us out, but they put us in the camp in\nAtlit. It was a camp.",
        "A: And, when I was visiting Atlit, I saw it was like a prisoner's camp with high tile that\nyou cannot go out. So we are prisoners. They put our fingers, and they took pictures left,\nright, profiles and everything. And they sent us in Atlit. In Atlit, we were -- I don't know\n-- a few months, whatever. But, being in Atlit, we were listening to the radio. And they\nannounce that they decided to establish a Jewish state. But when I was in Atlit -- we\nwere in Atlit -- I saw many people started to dance and clap and everything. And it was a\nhappy occasion. And, you know, the people were unbelievable. That was the same year\nthat we arrived. I don't know -- we arrived, I think, in the summer. You know, it was\nsummer.",
        "A: Seven. It was called the Exodus. And in Hebrew, it was the Sea of Teropa[?], leaving\nEurope like sea of Mizraim where the people left Egypt. Therefore they called it Exodus.\nSo anyway, they were dancing there in the camp. It was such a happy occasion when\nthey went. And we stayed there -- and, I don't know -- it was the end of -- the end of --",
        "A: Yeah, I walked out, see everybody's dancing in the street. It was -- you know, for me\nthe politics in that age didn't impress me, but impress me they were dancing in the streets.",
        "A: Yeah, in the camp when I was. Because my stepfather, he was a teacher in Poland for\nHebrew. So he taught me, and I was in school there in the camp and learned Hebrew and\neverything. He prepared me. And I was quite a good student.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. And you know what? Especially my mother, my father, we went to the hospital;\nI thought I'm going to have a brother or sister. And I remember a few months before this\nI started to call him tatsy. It means 'father'. It's funny like, \"I say -- Okay, I'm going to\nhave a brother, sister, he's going to be my father.\" Start to call him tatsy. My kids don't\ntell the story that he is my stepfather.",
        "A: But I loved him very much, because he was very dedicated. He was a very good\nperson. He had a wonderful character.",

And\nthey start to convince us, \"Come stay -- come to America stay. If you live here, you'll\nfeel better -- this and that.\" Although my husband told to me, he was very active in\nfighting for Israel. He was in Palma, this and that. He said, \"Okay. I gave enough of\nmyself. Maybe I'll do it.\" And he convinced me to go to America. Which it was\ndifficult for me, because I didn't want to leave my parents. But then he said, \"Don't\nworry -- we'll come and be established here.\" So we agreed. And that what happened.\nWe came to America. First to Long Island.",
        "A: He had a friend. We lived there. And then I remember it was like a year later when\nwe came, and I told my parents that I want them to come. It was the Passover Seder, and\nthey came. And my father conducted the Seder. And my house, it was so many people --\nfriends and neighbors -- and they really had a wonderful time. My father chose in\nPhiladelphia. I remember I bought a huge table, many chairs and everything, to be able\nto celebrate the Passover.",
        "A: So my parents came, and they stayed with us. And then. Somehow I don't know what\nhappened. I think they were -- they had an apartment, and they left everything. They\ncame to visit. Then they said they want to go and give it up and do whatever. And they\nwent back to Israel to give it up. And I remember that time my daughter Hessy was in\nIsrael. She convinced them to come back to America.",
        "A: You brought them there back. \"You brought them back.\"",
        "A: She brought them back after a few months. Then they stayed here.",
        "A: He went back with a friend from Israel. My children were little when he went, --",
        "A: -- so I couldn't leave them. So he went. I'm still planning to go. We'll see. That time\nthe kids were little; now my husband says he's too old.",
        "A: There's no happy medium, you know, between this and this. My kids grew up, and\nthen the grandchildren came. And I always said to him, \"I will go if you want to come.\"\nHe says he will not remember it. But you know what? He told me that this little town\ndidn't change much. Never did told me. Now, I didn't see my town that I was born. That\nI would like to see it -- yes.",
        "A: Yes. Anyway, that's the funny thing that we always plan -- not always it comes out.\nAnyway, my parents stay with us.",
        "A: And my mother died in 1998, which was -- she was 80 years old when she died. She\ngot Parkinson's, and she started to be in bad shape, so she died. And my father lived till\n2005 --",
        "A: -- seven years later than her. Beside that he was older than her at least 10, 12 years.",
        "A: Yes -- he was 97.5. But it's funny. His voice was unbelievable. He had a wonderful\nvoice. And wherever there was a chance, he used to sing. (indecipherable). But that was\nsuch a happy occasion. He used to sing, and everybody started to dance.",
        "A: People long in Philadelphia. Survivors group. It's called the New American Holocaust\nSurvivors -- yes. (indecipherable). Somebody was invited a few times there and\nwhatever and was occasionally started to sing and everybody clapped. He was a happy\nperson.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He didn't want to tell me and all the children. He couldn't talk.",
        "A: Lately he started to say \"When I was in the forest.\" It's not like -- like a history thing\nthat you tell this and this year -- a progressive. He remembers somebody told you that\nthey decided to talk now.",
        "A: Yes. They couldn't talk. They could not.",
        "A: I told them I was in the Exodus and that's it. I didn't talk much about it. But Exodus --\nI mean, Exodus was well-known ship.",
        "A: And I -- I start to tell them I was in Exodus. And then they throw that woman that was\npregnant. She gave birth to a baby. She died. Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, it was scary.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: My mother tells me that the people, some people that were from the Exodus and there\nwere some women that they -- after they left the Exodus that they gave birth, and this.\nSo, when they saw this, they say to her, \"So how are you doing after you have such a\ntrauma?\" She said, \"I'm trying to survive.\" Because they had their children with them.\nThey gave birth after. She was -- my mother started in nine month. Never happened\nwith her. Anyway, that is the story of Exodus. Yeah. I don't know how much in new\nmuseum. Did they have really -- did they have really places that they took pictures from\nthe boat or something? I don't know. I wanted to see that.\nhappens during the war and the Holocaust during the war. Is there anything you'd like to\nadd today that I didn't ask you about?",
        "A: What I want to add is that now I understand that the -- that the ship that was very\ncrowded and my parents, I mean, they're very uncomfortable sitting on the floor for the\nwhole trip. I mean, you couldn't stretch -- whatever -- it was there. But, after she came\nto Palestine, then we came Israel. She became a symbol of fighting the British\ngovernment. Although above her declaration was to give a state to the Jewish people, but\nit seems that the British ignored it. It's funny, because (indecipherable) was the first that\ncame out, now the Jewish people have to have a state of their own.",
        "A: And didn't -- didn't -- there's a lot to -- that the ship would be drowned. I know it was\nin water. When I came down the ship, they carried me out. Yeah. But that's the politics.\nYeah.",
        "A: Nothing comes easy. Life 1s a battle, you know? It's a struggle. When you succeeded\nthis -- you succeed like they prove the whole world that the Jewish people are very\nstubborn and won't give up. Although, the British are very bad. I know that we lived\nthere -- my mother said that that was attack from the Arabs. Was fiery I think --\nsomething. And they -- there was an action -- something. And that was the time the\nJewish people --",
        "A: Yes. And also there were a lot of crimes, a lot of -- that the people suffered a lot also.",
        "A: Yeah, oh -- the fight for the freedom, everything, yes. I remember that we came -- we\ncame and we lived at Haifa among the -- in the houses that the Arabs left; they run away.\nBut at nighttime, although the Arabs -- they had leaders -- and at nighttime they started to\ndissel [?], and they got together and tried to do different things to harm the Jewish\nsettlers. It wasn't easy.",
        "A: No, there wasn't security. It was -- every day was a struggle --",
        "A: -- but you know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My poor mother -- she lost two boys. One younger than me a little bit and one, he was\na baby. She paid a lot. She used to call me, \"You are my only eye in my head.\" I said,\n\"Why? You have two eyes.\" And she said, \"No.\"",
        "A: It's a shame.",
        "A: Yeah. She did pay a price. But she -- she died in 1998. So Justin, you were already\nhow old? Six. >> Justin: Grandmother made it to my bar mitzvah.",
        "A: And how was he? How was it; do you remember? Huh? Perfect. He was such a\nhappy person. He was the center of a party -- always. That's what I remember. And my\nmother also had beautiful voice -- soprano -- which I remember. And then our Seder was\nvery nice. Our getting together and everything. I have a good memory from that. That's\nwhat it is. Thank God -- yes.",
        "A: Yes. And although I have no brothers and sisters, but we had a nice life. And now we\nhave a nice life -- the children and their children.",
        "A: [hope they will not have to struggle like me, you know? They will have their lives\neasy-going.",
        "A: Yeah -- oh yeah.",
        "A: My husband also I told you about, he had a lot. He started as young boy and a long\ntime to struggle.",
        "A: [hope peace will be in the world. That will be the most thing that we can accomplish.",
        "A: Thank you very much.",
        "A: Yes. You know, I didn't want to talk, because I didn't see that I have all the picture\nstraight, you know? It was for me a little bit there, a little here, but it came.",
        "A: It came to me.",
