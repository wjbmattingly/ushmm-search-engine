Then--then I was there for 3 days.\nSB: Um, okay let's get to that ina little while.\nLet's um did you get--did your wife have a baby any-\ntime?\nTP: Yes. My wife became pregnant in the ghetto. There\nwas a dead line when women can bear children. After\ndead line, babies had to be aborted. But my baby\ndidn't want to go through it an abortion. And the baby\nwas born after the dead line. But the papers regis-\ntered in the ghetto records, it was born before the\ndead line. It was born--the baby was delivered by a\nmid-wife because my wife knew what from the hospital,\nshe was an excellent mid-wife. The next morning out\nbeared the placenta in the back yard. And I didn't\nwitness but I time, I heard the birth of the baby but I\nuh the baby looked healthy and you know it was fine.\nBut the baby didn't know what is what he was what kind\nof life he was coming to but the little. So the baby\nwas born I would say October the 42--something like\nthat. So when the baby was killed he was about 2 anda",

My\nbrother worked--worked in a place use to sometimes the\nGermans gave a little milk. It was hard. It was rough\nto raise a child. Clothes--there was no baby clothes\nthey have here. They had to take some old clothes and\nmake it--cut it down and make fit for a baby or uh\nshoes--it was very hard. I think that people here who\nlive in the worst economic conditions in slums, things\nlike that, had a much easier way to raise baby then it\nwas in the ghetto. And you know, here we spoke Yid-\ndish. Everybody spoke Yiddish. And they spoke a lot",
        "but German. You know when he started--the baby started\nto talk and understand a little bit, he use to say,\n'T'm afraid there's a German. I'm afraid there's a\nGerman.' In Yiddish, he use to say it. And he--and I\nbuilt an underground he--to hide ourselves because we\nthought--we knew that the war iS coming to an end and\nthe Russians are coming closer. So ina couple days we\ncould hide over here. So at night I used to dig it and\ntake the dirt throughout not the Germans could see it.\nAnd the rest that was the uh ghetto police anda stay\nand stay oysh and my wife kept the baby in the cellar.\nIt was kinda a sickly temp--than going into a cabinet\nthat in order for the baby not to cry, she gave him\ninjections in his thigh.

But you know, your horse\nmeat--if you season it right, it tastes very good. It\ntastes almost like beef. It's a little bit tough\nsometimes but if you grind it up, it's--you can make a\nhorse burger. And uh people use to go to work, they\nuse to try to organize something or uh. Like when I\nwent to the airport, the Germans already were short a\nfew because they use all the trucks on the Russian\nfront. So they use to hire Lithuanians with horses and\nwith wagons. And they use to deliver all this stuff.\nSo when they came to work, use to take manage to put\npants or a shirt.
