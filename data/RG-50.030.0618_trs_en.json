        "A: At the time, well, it was all strange, that my mother started to \u2014 or my\nstepmother, that I call her mother, I noticed that she started to have somebody pack\nher furniture, and all our furniture, and \u2014 and then the truck came by and picked up\nall that furniture, and then as \u2014 well, we asked her, we says, what\u2019s happened, where\nare you going? She said no, we are all going. And I says, where are we going? She\nOctober 13, 2010\nsays, we re going to Mexico. And I says why? He says, because we were told to\nleave the United States. And si \u2014 but, does my father know about it? He knows\nabout it. My father was in Mexico, and \u2014 and he had a good job, he had graduated\nfrom engineering, and became a \u2014 an architectural engineer, and \u2014 and all things\nthat we didn\u2019t even know, while we were growing. Every door \u2014 everything was\nincognito. And so, at that time, was \u2014 by that time, I was about around nine and a\nhalf years old, close to 10, and \u2014 and where are we heading, I asked my mother. She\nsaid, we\u2019re heading toward Durango, Durango, Mexico. And so, when we arrived\nin Durango, I remember that my father had a house rented out for us to live, just a\nfew days before they get a house. And so I remember sleeping on top of the \u2014 one\nof those big suitcases, that you used to travel in a big ships, at one time. And was\nfunny how we had to just sleep on top of that, and fall down. And kid\u2019s stuff, that\nwe [indecipherable]. So that \u2014 then I started to grow up then, and my father begin\nto increase his title, his engineering, his business. He became well-known. And it\nwas altogether a different custom of life, living in Mexico, compared to in the\nUnited States.",
        "Q: How so?",
        "A: Oh, they call me the gringo, because I was born in United States, and that I\nknow half English and half Spanish. And that was kind of difficult, but before IOctober 13, 2010\nknew it, I had a teacher tell me, he says, I want you to help me to teach these ch-\nchildren to speak English. And she was an English teacher, so I tag along.",
        "Q: And what was \u2014 so you were going to school, and your father was now working\n\u2014 where was your father working now?",
        "A: My father became a director of public works for the state of Durango. And \u2014\nand so, at that time as I \u2014 as I started to grow up, he \u2014 it was time when the\nOlympics was supposed to start. Mexico was the named nation to \u2014 for the\nOlympics, world Olympics. And so my father decided to build a big Olympic\nswimming pool, which was a hundred meters long, by 50 meters wide, with all the\ndecorations, as a\u2014 a\u2014 an Olympic swimming pool would look like, and with a\u2014a\ntransmitter along the side of that swimming pool so that people could listen to the\nmusic, and \u2014 and promenade. So, while I was going to school, we all got excited\nabout the Olympics, but then there was two other fellows and myself, we al \u2014 they\nall \u2014 always called us the \u2014 the three musketeers. And I liked to make \u2014 do exercise,\nand so I \u2014 I trained re \u2014 by looking at the books my father had of Charles Atlas,\nwell-known then. And every morning we used to \u2014 well, these fellows would come\nover and pick me up, and we\u2019d go swimming at the swimming pool, five in the\nmorning. And then about seven, we\u2019d head back to s \u2014 to school. This time it was\nabout \u2014 the war had started, the 40s, 1940. And Corolla(ph), Antonio Corolla(ph)\nOctober 13, 2010\nwas my friend. He was a \u2014 a \u2014 the son of a \u2014 a diplomat, congressman. Jose Blanco\n\u2014 Pepe Blanco(ph) they call him, Pepe, he was the nephew of a railroad conductor.\nWhich he knew the Morse code very well. So we went out swimming, and Pepe\nBlanco(ph) says, Atlas, Atlas, there\u2019s a spy going on. I said, why, what do you\nknow? We are very low voice, because we hear music in the distance, and I was\nfrom the transmitter. He says that there\u2019s a Morse code going on, and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nthere \u2014 there are submarines in Baja, California connected with \u2014 with these\npeople. I says, but how? How do you know? Yeah, I hear, dara de dara dara de\ndara dara dara \u2014 so they said that we better get to your father. So we decided \u2014 we\ndashed out that swimming pool, we headed back to school. And they went to\nschool, and I went to his office, my father\u2019s office, and I knocked quick at the door\nof his office, and I told him about the situation. And soon he \u2014 before you knew it,\nhe had them arrested. And sure enough, they were spying for the Nazis, the\nGermany. Well, I didn\u2019t realize then that we had a \u2014 a German colony in \u2014 in\nMexico. And here I was associated well with the groups of fellas, Boy Scouts. We\nhad formed a Boy Scout group, and our scoutmaster, Boy Scout master was the\nSchraeder(ph), a Schraeder(ph) family that owned a hardwood store there in\nDurango. And so, by that time I was 17 and a half years old, and an amer \u2014 the\nconsul general of the United States was after me because of my age, and get ready\nOctober 13, 2010\nto go back in United States and serve your country. Yes, sir. He was very good\nfriend of \u2014 he was a very nice friend of ours. And so I said goodbye to my parents,\nand my mother pre \u2014 my mother prepared me, meaning that she \u2014 she took my coat\npocket, 200 dollars, put it \u2014 a safety pin on it. She says, this is nobody steal it from\nyou. Use it when you can. Yeah, but how am I gonna take it out of there, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s secured. All these funny things get \u2014 one asks. But anyway, I had it \u2014 I said\ngoodbye to my parents and \u2014 and I took the train from Durango to the city of\nTorreon, we transferred over \u2014 I transferred over to another train. And at that time I\ndidn\u2019t know the traveling situation, because I had never traveled. And \u2014 and I- I\nhad my little satchel with me, and little suitcase. And I heard somebody say, psst,\npsst, psst, just a \u2014 like a whistling at me through the window of the other coach\ntrain. And I went up, and he says, give it to me, he say, I have a seat here for you.\nSo we met fre \u2014 made friends, and we became friends until a year later. But PII tell\nthe story about that. I \u2014 I said goodbye to him, because he was supposed to meet his\nsister there, in Juarez. I crossed the border, and I headed to Pasadena, back to my\ncousin\u2019s. And that\u2019s where I headed for induction, the following day. And then the\n\u2014 the head of the induction center said that I needed another semester of school.\nAnd I said, why? He says, well, we don\u2019t evaluate the sc \u2014 the \u2014 what you went\nthrough in your school, is not enough. I says, I went to school seven in the morning\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 13, 2010\ntil six in the evening. Isn\u2019t that enough? And, I says, they teach us very much over\nthere. More than they teach you here. I couldn\u2019t say any more, he says, but you need\n\u2014 you need a one semester. So I went to Pasadena City College, I took a course,\nand I passed by three months in that vacation. And I wa \u2014 I got my diploma, and \u2014\nand I\u2019m in the army. So before I knew it, I was in Oregon, in Camp Adair,\nOregon. We call it Swamp Adair, because it was full of swamps. And then I was\ntransferred, and I had special letters that my father had given me, as a duc \u2014\nintroduction, showing that my efforts was to \u2014 wanted to be a doctor. And so, before\nI knew it, I was transferred from the infantry to the \u2014 to go to medical school.",
        "Q: Did you know what was going on in Europe with the situation with the Jews, or\nwhat was happening at all during the war? Were you aware of any of that?",
        "A: Until then, little by little, I started to pick up about Germany, and the spies were\ngoing on, and \u2014 and \u2014 and the frustrations of what was happening, and yet, they kept\nus so that we\u2019d be alert. So they send me to the medical school, I went for four \u2014\nfour and a half months, and gave a study for equivalent almost for a year of study.\nAnd I graduated, and I headed back to my outfit, and before you know it, I \u2014 we\u2019re\nall heading back \u2014 heading for Europe.

And I couldn\u2019t stand the waves at all, and I had to lie down for 13 days in\nthe c-cot, eating nothing but Ritz crackers, cause I couldn\u2019t stand the \u2014 I \u2014 it was \u2014 I\ngot dizzy very easy. So, then we landed in Marseilles, and we stood there for about\ntwo or three days, and I had a friend of mine, he was Jewish.",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: His name was Murray Pruzan. I always kept in touch with her \u2014 with his\nparents. And \u2014 and he was a medic also. And that night, we\u2019re bivouacking, and he\nsays \u2014 he says, Anthony \u2014 by that time they never called me Tony, called me\nAnthony. And he says, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna make it. He says, I\u2019m gonna die. I\nOctober 13, 2010\nsaid, Murray, don\u2019t speak like that. You should pray, have faith. No, no, no, I have\na feeling I\u2019m gonna die. I said, Murray, don\u2019t say that. But anyway, I changed his\nmind by talking other things. Then that \u2014 two days later we headed for \u2014 for Lyon,\nFrance. And we were delighted, he was assigned to a group, and I was assigned to\nanother group of Company B, and he was assigned to Company A something. But\nanyway, we went to battle, and on my assignment I headed with Company B, on a\nspecial assignment, and I just followed. I carried my duffel bag, and all my\nequipment with me, and everybody used to laugh at me, and yell at me, and say,\nAnthony, drop that. Drop all that stuff [indecipherable] they gonna kill you,\nyou\u2019re a sore thumb, you \u2014 I said, no, I says, that\u2019s gonna save my life. And so, we\nhad it to their assignment, what they had to do, and I just followed, and as we were\nheading back, they finished what they had to do, the battalion. And \u2014 and we were\nmarching towards a ridge, and there was a dike down below, and I heard an echo,\nmedic, medic, cause there were machine guns going on back and forth. And I was\ncarrying my stuff with me, and then \u2014 and then it\u2019s \u2014 so finally I picked up the\nsound, and I started to head downhill. And as I was heading down the hill, I tripped\non some branches. And when I tripped over those branches, then I saw up ahead, a\ncave with Germans. Well, there were about six Germans in there, with machine\nguns. And those machine guns were the umpteen, I mean, just you thought thereOctober 13, 2010\nwere thousands of them, but it turned out to be that the \u2014 those machine guns that\nbrrt, brrt, brrt. And at that time when they start shooting at me, my stuff went up\nin the air. My duffel bag and everything, it just turn up into a [indecipherable]. My\nother boots were in ping pong here and there, and so on, so forth. I fell on the\nground and I crawled to my helmet, and before I knew it I was with the fellows that\nthey were wounded, so I \u2014 by that time they had control of the \u2014 the Germans, and\nthe \u2014 and so I was doing repair jobs. First aid sutures and sewing thumbs. Cutting a\nleg off, and putting a tourniquet, and sewing up that leg, the stump. Doing this and\nthat, so \u2014 as a medic. So finally, we all started to head back and they helped me with\nthe wounded. And as we were heading back, our scout said that we couldn\u2019t get to \u2014\nback to Philippsbourg, and so we decided \u2014 he said, move over to the hill. And so\nwe went up to the hill, and there I saw Murray Pruzan, that he had been killed. He\ntried to save the \u2014 well, he did save the \u2014 our captain \u2014 commander\u2019s life. He had\nsevere wounds, and he was unconscious. But Murray was \u2014 was cut in half by\nmachine guns. I lost my friend. And, at that time, it was just like saying, all hell\nbroke loose, there on that hill.

        "A: My father became a director of public works for the state of Durango. And \u2014\nand so, at that time as I \u2014 as I started to grow up, he \u2014 it was time when the\nOlympics was supposed to start. Mexico was the named nation to \u2014 for the\nOlympics, world Olympics. And so my father decided to build a big Olympic\nswimming pool, which was a hundred meters long, by 50 meters wide, with all the\ndecorations, as a\u2014 a\u2014 an Olympic swimming pool would look like, and with a\u2014a\ntransmitter along the side of that swimming pool so that people could listen to the\nmusic, and \u2014 and promenade. So, while I was going to school, we all got excited\nabout the Olympics, but then there was two other fellows and myself, we al \u2014 they\nall \u2014 always called us the \u2014 the three musketeers. And I liked to make \u2014 do exercise,\nand so I \u2014 I trained re \u2014 by looking at the books my father had of Charles Atlas,\nwell-known then. And every morning we used to \u2014 well, these fellows would come\nover and pick me up, and we\u2019d go swimming at the swimming pool, five in the\nmorning. And then about seven, we\u2019d head back to s \u2014 to school. This time it was\nabout \u2014 the war had started, the 40s, 1940. And Corolla(ph), Antonio Corolla(ph)\nOctober 13, 2010\nwas my friend. He was a \u2014 a \u2014 the son of a \u2014 a diplomat, congressman. Jose Blanco\n\u2014 Pepe Blanco(ph) they call him, Pepe, he was the nephew of a railroad conductor.\nWhich he knew the Morse code very well. So we went out swimming, and Pepe\nBlanco(ph) says, Atlas, Atlas, there\u2019s a spy going on. I said, why, what do you\nknow? We are very low voice, because we hear music in the distance, and I was\nfrom the transmitter. He says that there\u2019s a Morse code going on, and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nthere \u2014 there are submarines in Baja, California connected with \u2014 with these\npeople. I says, but how? How do you know? Yeah, I hear, dara de dara dara de\ndara dara dara \u2014 so they said that we better get to your father. So we decided \u2014 we\ndashed out that swimming pool, we headed back to school. And they went to\nschool, and I went to his office, my father\u2019s office, and I knocked quick at the door\nof his office, and I told him about the situation. And soon he \u2014 before you knew it,\nhe had them arrested. And sure enough, they were spying for the Nazis, the\nGermany. Well, I didn\u2019t realize then that we had a \u2014 a German colony in \u2014 in\nMexico. And here I was associated well with the groups of fellas, Boy Scouts. We\nhad formed a Boy Scout group, and our scoutmaster, Boy Scout master was the\nSchraeder(ph), a Schraeder(ph) family that owned a hardwood store there in\nDurango. And so, by that time I was 17 and a half years old, and an amer \u2014 the\nconsul general of the United States was after me because of my age, and get ready\nOctober 13, 2010\nto go back in United States and serve your country. Yes, sir. He was very good\nfriend of \u2014 he was a very nice friend of ours. And so I said goodbye to my parents,\nand my mother pre \u2014 my mother prepared me, meaning that she \u2014 she took my coat\npocket, 200 dollars, put it \u2014 a safety pin on it. She says, this is nobody steal it from\nyou. Use it when you can. Yeah, but how am I gonna take it out of there, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s secured. All these funny things get \u2014 one asks. But anyway, I had it \u2014 I said\ngoodbye to my parents and \u2014 and I took the train from Durango to the city of\nTorreon, we transferred over \u2014 I transferred over to another train. And at that time I\ndidn\u2019t know the traveling situation, because I had never traveled. And \u2014 and I- I\nhad my little satchel with me, and little suitcase. And I heard somebody say, psst,\npsst, psst, just a \u2014 like a whistling at me through the window of the other coach\ntrain. And I went up, and he says, give it to me, he say, I have a seat here for you.\nSo we met fre \u2014 made friends, and we became friends until a year later. But PII tell\nthe story about that. I \u2014 I said goodbye to him, because he was supposed to meet his\nsister there, in Juarez. I crossed the border, and I headed to Pasadena, back to my\ncousin\u2019s. And that\u2019s where I headed for induction, the following day. And then the\n\u2014 the head of the induction center said that I needed another semester of school.\nAnd I said, why? He says, well, we don\u2019t evaluate the sc \u2014 the \u2014 what you went\nthrough in your school, is not enough. I says, I went to school seven in the morning\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 13, 2010\ntil six in the evening. Isn\u2019t that enough? And, I says, they teach us very much over\nthere. More than they teach you here. I couldn\u2019t say any more, he says, but you need\n\u2014 you need a one semester. So I went to Pasadena City College, I took a course,\nand I passed by three months in that vacation. And I wa \u2014 I got my diploma, and \u2014\nand I\u2019m in the army. So before I knew it, I was in Oregon, in Camp Adair,\nOregon. We call it Swamp Adair, because it was full of swamps. And then I was\ntransferred, and I had special letters that my father had given me, as a duc \u2014\nintroduction, showing that my efforts was to \u2014 wanted to be a doctor.

But\nanyway, we went to battle, and on my assignment I headed with Company B, on a\nspecial assignment, and I just followed.

And \u2014 and we were\nmarching towards a ridge, and there was a dike down below, and I heard an echo,\nmedic, medic, cause there were machine guns going on back and forth. And I was\ncarrying my stuff with me, and then \u2014 and then it\u2019s \u2014 so finally I picked up the\nsound, and I started to head downhill. And as I was heading down the hill, I tripped\non some branches. And when I tripped over those branches, then I saw up ahead, a\ncave with Germans. Well, there were about six Germans in there, with machine\nguns. And those machine guns were the umpteen, I mean, just you thought thereOctober 13, 2010\nwere thousands of them, but it turned out to be that the \u2014 those machine guns that\nbrrt, brrt, brrt. And at that time when they start shooting at me, my stuff went up\nin the air. My duffel bag and everything, it just turn up into a [indecipherable]. My\nother boots were in ping pong here and there, and so on, so forth. I fell on the\nground and I crawled to my helmet, and before I knew it I was with the fellows that\nthey were wounded, so I \u2014 by that time they had control of the \u2014 the Germans, and\nthe \u2014 and so I was doing repair jobs. First aid sutures and sewing thumbs. Cutting a\nleg off, and putting a tourniquet, and sewing up that leg, the stump. Doing this and\nthat, so \u2014 as a medic. So finally, we all started to head back and they helped me with\nthe wounded. And as we were heading back, our scout said that we couldn\u2019t get to \u2014\nback to Philippsbourg, and so we decided \u2014 he said, move over to the hill. And so\nwe went up to the hill, and there I saw Murray Pruzan, that he had been killed. He\ntried to save the \u2014 well, he did save the \u2014 our captain \u2014 commander\u2019s life. He had\nsevere wounds, and he was unconscious. But Murray was \u2014 was cut in half by\nmachine guns. I lost my friend. And, at that time, it was just like saying, all hell\nbroke loose, there on that hill. And we were there from the \u2014 oh, for days before\nChristmas until the sixth \u2014 the second of \u2014 the second of January \u2014",

Sure enough, Schraeder, I tried to ignore the \u2014 the\nOctober 13, 2010\nname, but he happened to be the owner of the \u2014 the hardware store in Durango, and\n\u2014and I kept denying. And everything I denied, he slapped my face. Then he started\nto put needles in my fingernails. He wanted to ask more questions. He says you \u2014 he\nsay, your father is so and so, your parents are so and so?

And so we were forced to stand outside until they gave up, or\notherwise they shoot us all. So they had the machine guns at us, and if we didn\u2019t re\n\u2014 come up with the two fellas, they would shoot us all. Yet, when we were forced to\nOctober 13, 2010\nleave the barracks, fellas could not have \u2014 they did not, or were not able to put their\nshoes on, or socks on, to stand out there in the snow, barefooted, or whatever.",

And so, anyway, about a week later, on the eighth of February, we were\nforced to come out of the barracks, and line up, and then the commander said, all\nAmerican Jews with names Jewish, take two steps forward.

For\na while they didn\u2019t say nothing, until you were to be completely segregated from\nthe whole groups. You were nothing but a \u2014 a little sel-selection here on one side,\nand to leave the place, and says \u2014 and the term was that we were to travel to a place\nthat we were supposed to have oh, the unique place to play ball.

So, in other words, the barracks were that the cracks \u2014 when you\nwere inside, you could see the \u2014 the wind, feel the wind coming in through the\ncracks.",

So, when they\nselected our groups into si\u2014 16 per group per tunnel, there were 11 to 12 tunnels. In\nOctober 13, 2010\neach tunnel, they had fellas go in and dig into the tunnels, to enlarge the areas inside\nof the tunnels, to \u2014 well, we didn\u2019t know why the tunnels were being built.",
        "A: Us medics were to only take of the \u2014 the sick. And then, what I did was, I asked\nthe commander, why not? If a fellas gotta work in that tunnel today, gi-give him a\nday off tomorrow, and have another group work for him, so kind of liberate him\nfrom it.",

And Cohen, when the German asked me, or told me to verify, to sh\u2014as a\nmedic, that he was shot because he tried to escape. In other words, you shoot a\nperson from a distance, okay, you gonna hit him in the back. So, the German asked\nme, I want you to check and to see that he 1s being \u2014 he was shot trying to escape. I\nsays, can I turn him over? Can I look at him? And they\u2019re saying okay. And the\nGermans was shooting in the forehead, with a wooden bullet. What did they do?\nThey stand him on a wall \u2014 behind the wall, and shoot him in the head, then they\nwaxed the hole. What does a bullet \u2014 wooden bullet do? It\u2019s just that it shoots in,\nand splinters inside the \u2014 the head. Okay, they were using that as an excuse. TheyOctober 13, 2010\nthought that I wouldn\u2019t identify the wax that covered the hole. So the Germans were\nslaughtering our men that tried to escape.",

So this got worse,\nbecause the sleeping without the clothes, it was dangerous for your health. Getting\nworse pneumonia, and all the qua \u2014 the effects, the side effects that you would get,\nwithout being able to eat at all.",
