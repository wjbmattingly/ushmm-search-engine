        "Q: That's a lot. That's a lot. When you returned to school the following fall, was it the\nsame school you were in before or was this a different one?",
        "A: No. I had been in the Lyceum which is the more classical education. And then in\nHattem there was a very good school. It was actually a Christian school. But my\ngrandmother decided that a little religion wouldn't hurt us. And that school did in three\nyears what all others did in four. And it also was recognized by the Merchant Marine\nAcademy that I wanted to go to.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: So,",
        "Q: So, you went there. Boy, you certainly had the gamut, you know, from a progressive\nschool to a Christian school.",
        "A: Yeah. But the head master was very religious, but we went sailing on Sundays. So,\nwe often met him coming back from church. He came back from church and we were\non the way to the boat. So, he gave me a hard time.",
        "Q: Because of that?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. And did the curriculum change because was it different because of the\noccupation?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, there wasn't",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "Q: There wasn't much influence by the",
        "A: No, not",
        "Q: I see. I see. So, you, you finished your studies in three years there?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: And then I went to the Merchant Marine Academy up north.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: And there by that time, all students had to sign a declaration that they agreed with the\nNazi ideas and principles and would not do anything against it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: If you didn't sign that, that was the end of your education. So, it was the end of my\nschooling too.",
        "Q: So, you didn't sign it?",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "Q: Was that unusual that people wouldn't sign?",
        "A: Oh, no. But then you run the risk you have to go in hiding. You had to work for the\nGermans either in Holland or France or Germany.",
        "Q: So, a lot of kids didn't sign and took that risk?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, right.",
        "Q: What did you do when you didn't sign? What did you",
        "A: I went back to Hattem, the place where my grandparents lived. But I went to live\nwith another family not too far away and, in a sense, in hiding.",
        "Q: Uhhuh. And during the time you were in school, were you involved in any kind of\nextracurricular activities?",
        "A: Yeah, field hockey.",
        "Q: Field hockey?",
        "A: Organized, and sailed a lot.",
        "Q: Uhhuh. But not politics and not resistance and not going, nothing like that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Didn't like the Nazis, but the Germans",
        "Q: When you then went into hiding, how did your life develop? What happened then?",
        "A: Well, I lived with them but I could not get (inaudible) cars any more. So, the\nresistance provided those I guess.",
        "Q: And this was in what year? In 1943 or '44?",
        "A: 1942.",
        "Q: Oh, in '42?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, 1940, '41,'42. And, so, you never did get to the Merchant Marine school?",
        "A: I never did. Finally I was, but it was very short.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So, in 1942 that's still your there's three more years of war left?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What happens to you after that?",
        "A: Well, I got involved in the resistance.",
        "Q: Well, tell me about it. Tell me how were you brought in? How the same sort of\nquestions. How did you start? Who involved you?",
        "A: A good friend of mine and I decided he decided that his father was an officer in,\nsay, call it the fellow police and they were mounted. And his father stayed as an officer.\nAnd then Harry felt that his father was a collaborator and a traitor and we would try to\nget to England. And he did quite a bit of research. And we went on a hiking trip and got\ninto Belgium and almost to France. There were safe houses, farms where you could\nstay. You could not camp overnight outside.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: And these safe houses Harry had figured, found out. And that way, we could get\nthrough France into Spain and then Portugal and to England. But we lost the trail and\nwe got short of food, so we started going back. And just back in the Dutch, across the\nBelgium Dutch border we were picked up by a patrol.",
        "Q: German?",
        "A: German patrol, oh, yeah. And they took us actually to a police station and we were\ninterrogated there separately. But we had a good story. We had been on a hiking trip and\nwe were on our way back home.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: So, we spent overnight in separate cells.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: And then they let us go.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then Harry's father called us and said, \"What the hell were you trying to do?\"\nAnd Harry says, \"Well, you're a traitor and we wanted to try to go to England.\" He said,\n\"Yes, but I'm involved in the resistance. So, if you want to do something, start \" we\nstarted actually taking downed airmen we called them pilots but, of course, they were\nany kind of airmen from one place to another. We would be told to go somewhere",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: and pick up a couple of guys and take them somewhere else.",
        "Q: Did Harry feel did Harry apologize to his father for having called him a traitor?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Did Harry apologize to his father for having called him a traitor after that?",
        "A: I don't remember that, but I guess so.",
        "Q: So, you would be so downed airmen, you would take them these were British\nairmen?",
        "A: Or American, yeah.",
        "Q: Or American?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you speak any English?",
        "A: A little bit.",
        "Q: A little bit?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you were your job was to go there and bring them from where they landed to",
        "A: Go to a house where, a safe house where they were. They were brought there",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: by other people. And then we had phony passports and we'd take them to another\nhouse. And then we didn't know anymore.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You never knew the people that you met.",
        "Q: Were you and Harry doing this together?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, if you had been caught, you would know about what his activities were and he\nwould know about yours?",
        "A: That was the problem, that I knew his father. I knew way too much. I also knew the\nguy who was in charge of the whole resistance of the whole areA: I just happened to\nknow the family.",
        "Q: So, how long did you do this? How long were you involved 1n this kind of activity?",
        "A: Until I was arrested.",
        "Q: And that would have been how long? A year?",
        "A: That was in on December 5, 1944.",
        "Q: Certain dates you don't forget, huh?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: There are certain dates you don't forget?",
        "A: No.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That's an easy one, though. December 5th is Sinterklaas\nin Holland.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What happened? How were you picked up? How were you\narrested?",
        "A: Well, I was staying in a house of Mrs. (inaudible). My friend's fiance lived there and\nhis two sisters. He was living somewhere else. And in the morning one morning I was\nsitting looking at a magazine when German troops, an officer and I think 10 or 12 men\ncame into the yard. And I thought at first I could have run out into the woods through\nthe back door. But then I thought nobody knows you're here, so",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I stayed. And then they arrived at the house and knocked on the door and asked the\ngirls if they would open the door and if there were any men in the house. And she said,\n\"No,\" of course.\nSo, the living room where I was,",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: the corridor is here and the door opened this way. So, I stood in the corner behind\nthe door. And they went through the house. But well, they saw a shaving brush upstairs,\nof course, and knew. Then the guy in the living room looked under the couch, which\nwas only this high, and they looked through the house and didn't find me. They were\noutside again talking. And all of a sudden, I heard the guy run back. And he pulled the\ndoor open and there I was. So, he poked a rifle in my gut and he yelled, \"Da ist er,\"\nthere he is. So, then I knew that they knew that they were looking for somebody.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, then he said, \"Where's your friend?\" I said, \"I'm the only one here.\" They said,\n\"Well, it will be more pleasant if you go with somebody.\" So, I kept saying I was the\nonly one. They said, \"Go upstairs, get your toothbrush, and get on the bike.\" And I\ncould have escaped many times on the way to their headquarters, but they would go\nright back and pick up the family there.",
        "Q: So, they already knew that the two of you were involved, that you and Harry were\ninvolved?",
        "A: Not that I was involved, simply that there was a man that lived there, or a boy, a man\nwho was not working for them.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. They picked you up because there you were,",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: you're the right age, and you're not working for them 1n any way.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And that's suspicious?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then at headquarters they asked me many questions and you saw the ID cards.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Now, Jews had a great big purple J on them.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: Of course, I'm not Jewish and I didn't have that. But they still thought with the dark\nhair maybe I could be Jewish. I said, \"No.\" They said, \"Drop your pants.\" Well, I'm not\ncircumcised, so I said, \"Okay.\"",
        "Q: Yeah. And, so, then that part was at least safe?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But then they said, \"You have to be punished.\" And but they didn't really know what\nto do with me. So, they said, \"Let's take you to the gestapo in the town across the river.\"\nAnd there the gestapo questioned me again. They never beat me. They never hurt me.\nBut my story was good.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: I'm a student up north. I came down here for a vacation. In September the trains\nstopped running for civilians, so I got stuck here.",
        "Q: That was your story?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And it was so simple and it was partially true.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, then they said, \"Well, you don't work for us. You have to be punished.\" There\nwas a hard labor camp, Klein ErikA:",
        "Q: Klein Erika?",
        "A: It was called Klein ErikA: There was also a camp called ErikA:",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: And it was very bad.",
        "Q: And these were within, within the Netherlands, these camps?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Klein Erika and Erika, the two of them?",
        "A: Klein Erika was the German name for it, but also in Dutch Small ErikA:",
        "Q: Small Erika and Erika herself?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, you were sent to Klein Erika?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: You were sent to Klein Erika camp?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What was that like? What did you",
        "A: Well, it wasn't too bad.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The camp commander had been a professor at the university in (inaudible). And the\nguy in charge of the work detail had also been a professor. But when the war got bad,\nthey were drafted and put in charge of a hard labor camp. \"When one man escapes,\nshoot two,\" you know. But",
        "Q: So, one escapee; two are shot?",
        "A: Yeah. And they had hostages. And the first morning when a new person came 1n,\nthey selected so many of them to become a hostage.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And then the old hostages were not hostages anymore.",
        "Q: They were released from being hostages?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But they were still within the camp?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. So, were you chosen to be a hostage?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, that meant if someone escaped, you were 1n line?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I run the risk. So, I looked at my buddies and said, \"If one of your guys goes, I will\ngo with you,\" but nobody ran away.",
        "Q: Okay. So, what how did things progress from there?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: How did things develop from there?",
        "A: Well, we were marched off every morning to work somewhere, install trenches and\ngunnery placements or unload barges and do any kind of hard labor.",
        "Q: Well, this was already towards the end of the war.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: When you marched, you had to sing; right?",
        "A: Pardon? Oh, yeah. When we were marching through the town, we had to sing. And\nwe had about, I think, 25 soldiers, then came the group. Then we came, soldiers on the\nside. And then behind us again we marched in fives. And behind us again, 25 soldiers.\nAnd two firemen from Rotterdam had been picked up in a raid. They were still in\nuniform. They had jumped off a train to Germany and were put in our camp. And they\nwere there, one on the left and one on the right. And then the group leader would go and\nlead a song. The guy on the left would call the name of the song. And then the guy on\nthe right would call (German phrase) whenever the feet came down and then we all\nburst out in song.",
        "Q: Oh, good God.",
        "A: I can't sing. And I was a hostage and I was miserable and I didn't like it. So, I\nmarched along quite grim.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: One of the guards along the side noticed that I wasn't singing. So, he came in behind\nme and beat me with a rifle butt and told me to sing. So, I sang off tune and I brought a\nwhole bunch of others out of, out of tune. Another guard heard the discord and finally\nfound out the source and beat me with a rifle butt again and told me to shut up, \"Halt\nmund.\"",
        "Q: Halt mund, yeah.",
        "A: \"Keep your trap shut.\"",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, I marched along. And a soldier saw that I wasn't singing, so I got beaten again.\nAnd then after that, I just mouthed it.",
        "Q: You just mouthed the words?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Oh, dear.",
        "A: I didn't have no more problems, but it took three beatings.",
        "Q: That was a hard lesson.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. What kind of work were you doing once you got to the place you had to go to?",
        "A: We were digging trenches for, along the river",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: at gunnery placements and ammunition bunkers. We also unloaded barges, did all\nsorts of stuff. Once in a while, we had to unload the barge with carbide. Carbide makes\nacetylene gas, so it comes in steel drums. Two men could easily lift them and then pick\nthem up and roll them down the gangway",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: to shore. So, we would break it, crack it, and made sure that it ran into the water.\nSo, a lot of gas would come out and the Germans would scream and panic.",
        "Q: Sabotage?",
        "A: Yeah. And everybody would be evacuated and sent to wait until the boat stopped.\nSo, we got a break that way.",
        "Q: When you were arrested, it was December?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: When you were arrested, it was December 5th, '44?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And how long did it take between the time you were arrested and the time you were\nin this labor camp, Klein Erika? Was it a week?",
        "A: The evening of the same day.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It was that fast?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did anybody interrogate you about resistance activities?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: My story was simple and good.",
        "Q: And, so, they didn't question it?",
        "A: The train stopped running for civilians. I couldn't get back and that's why I'm here.",
        "Q: When you were in Klein Erika, though, there are two things that come to mind. One,\nit's wintertime. It's December, January. And, so, conditions probably are not very\ncomfortable. But I want to ask you about that. And, number two, we're already going\ninto 1945 and there's only four months left of the war. Were there battles that were\nalready being fought around the area where you were?",
        "A: No. That was further south. The allies didn't come up September, '44, it was not part\nof Holland. And, actually, later on in '45 our area was liberated before the western part\nof Holland.",
        "Q: Okay.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: My father did mention that they would use their shovels\nas helmets from the antiaircraft fire.",
        "Q: Yeah, tell me about that. You said you used shovels?",
        "A: We were digging the trenches",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: from the bridges across the river. One was a railroad bridge. The other one was a\ntraffic bridge. And the allies would come by and try and bomb these. And then the\nGermans would and also heavy antiaircraft. And when the shells broke, of course the\nfragments have to come down again. So, we would sit in the trench and have the shovels\nover our head for the",
        "Q: So it wouldn't hit you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did they ever land on one of the people who was a prisoner?",
        "A: The guy next to me had one land on his shoulder. He was wearing an overcoat and a\njacket. Both had padded shoulders",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: but it tore both padding out and it knocked him down.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But he, he had a sore shoulder, but it didn't break the skin. Thanks for reminding me.",
        "Q: Uhhuh. So, how long did this continue for you?",
        "A: Well, you've maybe heard about the Battle of Arnhem or A Bridge Too Far.\" It was a\nmovie. Well, the allies were on the south side of the river. The Germans were digging in\nand the allies were shooting them. So, they lost too many troops. So, they decided that\nthey had expendables in camps. So, our camp was one of the camps that provided labor\nto the area. And that night, it was my turn and there was always confusion. The gates\nwere open. It was a blackout, quite dark. Two guards came marching towards each other\nand presented arms, about face, and marched back. And they did it and I watched them\nfor a while. And, like I say, it was very black out. And the trucks were there ready to\ndrive off. The gates were open. And I went up there and walked out.",
        "Q: You just simply walked out?",
        "A: Yeah. I had nothing to lose. Not too far away was the house of a friend of mine.\nNow, he and his father were in hiding somewhere. But I knocked on the door and I\nborrowed a bicycle there and went back to my apartment the other side of the river.",
        "Q: A bicycle with rubber? With wheels?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: The bicycle had wheels?",
        "A: It had even tires.",
        "Q: It had tires?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But she never saw the bike again.",
        "Q: So, you went back to this was your grandparents' place?",
        "A: Yeah, but I didn't go to her house.",
        "Q: Your grandmother's house?",
        "A: I went to the house where I had been arrested, where I'd been in hiding.",
        "Q: I see. And what why did you go back there?",
        "A: Well, my grandmother's house was right in between two estates that the Germans\noccupied. Actually, my grandmother's garage had a cannon in it. The Germans had put\nit there.",
        "Q: They stored their cannon in her garage?",
        "A: Yeah. And at that time, somehow she had been able to stay in the house. And later\non, she was kicked out and the Germans took over. But",
        "Q: Uhhuh. So, this when you walked out and escaped from Klein Erika, that was when?\nJanuary already or February?",
        "A: No, it was about March.",
        "Q: Oh, so you still were there for quite a few months?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. So, it's March and you go back to this other house. And was it safe for you\nthere to be 1n that place? Wouldn't they come looking for you again?",
        "A: I didn't think that the camp would really know who had brought me there. So,",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And where else could I go?",
        "Q: And, so, what did you do then? After that, you returned to this house. Did you go\nback into hiding?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I stayed there. And, gosh, we had, we had weapons. We had stun guns.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: So, our group went near the bridge across the canal. The river was further to the east.\nAnd the Canadians were coming up on that side. So, we were supposed to hold the\nbridge in case they came, the Canadians came across. They never did. And then one day\nthe Germans came and they wanted our house. So, we could not go there.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: And that night the Germans ambushed the guys that were at the bridge and they were\nwiped out.",
        "Q: So, this was part of your resistance?",
        "A: And the farmer and his wife were hung in the door of the barn.",
        "Q: Who was hung in the door of the barn?",
        "A: There was a farm, and the farmer and his wife were strung up in the door of the barn.",
        "Q: Because they were suspected of having helped?",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Then later on we were asked a German General Blaskowitz had been in the southern\npart of Holland or not the southern, central part of Holland. And he had been harassed\nthere. Then he was in Hilversum where the allies had their headquarters. And he had\ncome to our area and we were asked to harass him. And, so, we went and cut his wires,\ntelephone wires across there was a small road into the woods with three rows of birches\non each side. It was somekind of a fire break. But there were two paths you could walk\nthrough more or less.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: There were several houses, summer homes that now the Germans occupied. The\ntelephone wires strung through, across the road through the trees.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: And we were asked to cut the wires.",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "A: They said that I was the most technical, so it was my job. But we had to pull down\nthe wires and cut out about six feet so they couldn't just splice them back. And we did.\nAnd then we cut several wires. Then somehow the Germans started blowing whistles\nand they all barged out and started shooting at each other and we backed out through the\nwoods. I had a whole bunch of wires wrapped around my waist.",

        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: So, we went to talk with the officer of the Germans and he said he would not\nsurrender to terrorists, only to an allied officer, equal or superior rank. But he also said\nthat we could blow him up so he would not do anything anymore. And we put a guard",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: next to the place for there was a chance that people in the town would come up and\nharass them.",

        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: And when that happened, when the area was then liberated, what did you do?",
        "A: What did we do? Get drunk.\n(Laughter)",
        "A: No, I don't really know. We became the police force.",
        "Q: Yeah?",

        "Q: And what did you do then as a Marine?",
        "A: Well, I trained here with American Marines for the final hit against Japan. But then\nwhile we were training, Japan surrendered. And we had signed up for the duration of the\nwar plus so many months. But at the bottom of the contract it said unless the Minister of\nthe Army or the Navy decides otherwise.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: So, he decided otherwise and we finished our training and were sent to Java and\nwere there for two and a half years.",

        "A: She didn't want to know. Yes, she did for in the beginning sometimes we would at\nnight clean our stun guns. So, she, she knew, but",
        "Q: Okay. And when do you did you start communicating with your father and, and his\nwife and child? When did that happen?",
        "A: In the Marine Corps we went first to Scotland to a transient camp and then came here\nto the states. But it was in Scotland I told them that my father or my parents lived in\nEngland.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: The sergeant in charge of our group they were all professionals who didn't really\nlike us for we were much better educated than they were.",
        "Q: Oh.",

        "A: I had copied the letter. I had just written another one. I said, \"My parents live here. I\nhaven't seen them since '38, and I had requested transport.\" And he looked at it and he\ncalled out he signed the orders and gave me money. And he called the Sergeant that had\nrefused to give my request and he caught hell. And I was on the train a few hours later\nto London.",

        "A: And my younger brother I think was six years old.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: And he spoke English very fast and I wasn't all that good. So, I asked him to slow\ndown. And he looked up at me and said, \"Don't be silly.\"",
        "Q: The things a person remembers.",

        "A: Well, for the Marine Corps I had applied for the artillery or the tanks. But I was\ngiven some kind of aptitude test. And I'm good with tools, so they made me a motor\nmechanic and a driver. So, I learned to drive the jeeps, the trucks and tanks, any of the\nmotor vehicles. And they made me a motor mechanic.",

        "Q: Oh, for the cattle?",

        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: And then there was a brick furnace on one end to heat the air. And then there was a\nrotating drum and the cyclone where the air the grass was blown in, chopped up, and\nthen dried quickly; high protein, high carotene. And then it was ground into meal and\nthen made into pellets for cattle food.",
        "Q: Uhhuh. How long did you work there?",
        "A: Oh, until 1950. And then I, I that job gave an awful lot of free time. It was a very\ngenerous salary. So, I was doing quite well and I sailed a lot in the free time. I sailed the\nsouth coast of England and the Channel.\nAnd then in 1950 we decided that it might be fun to sail across to over here and then\nrace in the transatlantic race back to England.",
        "Q: Wow, what adventures.",

        "A: To knock about.",
        "Q: Pardon?",
        "A: Just to knock around.",
        "Q: Just to knock around?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then I got her fish dish and she never came back. Then later on the afternoon\nshe was sitting on the deck chair on deck and I asked her if she had been able to get\nback on the deck on time. And then we would still talk.",
        "Q: And that was the beginning of a conversation that has lasted until now?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And, so, when you came to the United States, neither of you had intended to stay\nhere?",
        "A: No.",

And I\nmilked cows for a while. And then we got married in Vermont. But then I came down\nhere to (inaudible) Manor and they needed a dairy manager. So, it worked out for a\nwhile. And then somehow",

        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: I don't know. They just",

        "A: Yeah. Well, he spoke fluent German. And, you know, a lieutenant I guess it was the\nsecond lieutenant he had been addressed in fluent German by an older man and he\npacked up and left.",

        "A: Yes, and Dutch of course.",
        "A: No. I had been in the Lyceum which is the more classical education. And then in\nHattem there was a very good school. It was actually a Christian school. But my\ngrandmother decided that a little religion wouldn't hurt us. And that school did in three\nyears what all others did in four. And it also was recognized by the Merchant Marine\nAcademy that I wanted to go to.",
        "A: So,",
        "A: Yeah. But the head master was very religious, but we went sailing on Sundays. So,\nwe often met him coming back from church. He came back from church and we were\non the way to the boat. So, he gave me a hard time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "A: No, not",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And then I went to the Merchant Marine Academy up north.",
        "A: And there by that time, all students had to sign a declaration that they agreed with the\nNazi ideas and principles and would not do anything against it.",
        "A: If you didn't sign that, that was the end of your education. So, it was the end of my\nschooling too.",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "A: Oh, no. But then you run the risk you have to go in hiding. You had to work for the\nGermans either in Holland or France or Germany.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, right.",
        "A: I went back to Hattem, the place where my grandparents lived. But I went to live\nwith another family not too far away and, in a sense, in hiding.",
        "A: Yeah, field hockey.",
        "A: Organized, and sailed a lot.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Didn't like the Nazis, but the Germans",
        "A: Well, I lived with them but I could not get (inaudible) cars any more. So, the\nresistance provided those I guess.",
        "A: 1942.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I never did. Finally I was, but it was very short.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I got involved in the resistance.",
        "A: A good friend of mine and I decided he decided that his father was an officer in,\nsay, call it the fellow police and they were mounted. And his father stayed as an officer.\nAnd then Harry felt that his father was a collaborator and a traitor and we would try to\nget to England. And he did quite a bit of research. And we went on a hiking trip and got\ninto Belgium and almost to France. There were safe houses, farms where you could\nstay. You could not camp overnight outside.",
        "A: And these safe houses Harry had figured, found out. And that way, we could get\nthrough France into Spain and then Portugal and to England. But we lost the trail and\nwe got short of food, so we started going back. And just back in the Dutch, across the\nBelgium Dutch border we were picked up by a patrol.",
        "A: German patrol, oh, yeah. And they took us actually to a police station and we were\ninterrogated there separately. But we had a good story. We had been on a hiking trip and\nwe were on our way back home.",
        "A: So, we spent overnight in separate cells.",
        "A: And then they let us go.",
        "A: And then Harry's father called us and said, \"What the hell were you trying to do?\"\nAnd Harry says, \"Well, you're a traitor and we wanted to try to go to England.\" He said,\n\"Yes, but I'm involved in the resistance. So, if you want to do something, start \" we\nstarted actually taking downed airmen we called them pilots but, of course, they were\nany kind of airmen from one place to another. We would be told to go somewhere",
        "A: and pick up a couple of guys and take them somewhere else.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: I don't remember that, but I guess so.",
        "A: Or American, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: A little bit.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Go to a house where, a safe house where they were. They were brought there",
        "A: by other people. And then we had phony passports and we'd take them to another\nhouse. And then we didn't know anymore.",
        "A: You never knew the people that you met.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That was the problem, that I knew his father. I knew way too much. I also knew the\nguy who was in charge of the whole resistance of the whole areA: I just happened to\nknow the family.",
        "A: Until I was arrested.",
        "A: That was in on December 5, 1944.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: No.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That's an easy one, though. December 5th is Sinterklaas\nin Holland.",
        "A: Well, I was staying in a house of Mrs. (inaudible). My friend's fiance lived there and\nhis two sisters. He was living somewhere else. And in the morning one morning I was\nsitting looking at a magazine when German troops, an officer and I think 10 or 12 men\ncame into the yard. And I thought at first I could have run out into the woods through\nthe back door. But then I thought nobody knows you're here, so",
        "A: I stayed. And then they arrived at the house and knocked on the door and asked the\ngirls if they would open the door and if there were any men in the house. And she said,\n\"No,\" of course.\nSo, the living room where I was,",
        "A: the corridor is here and the door opened this way. So, I stood in the corner behind\nthe door. And they went through the house. But well, they saw a shaving brush upstairs,\nof course, and knew. Then the guy in the living room looked under the couch, which\nwas only this high, and they looked through the house and didn't find me. They were\noutside again talking. And all of a sudden, I heard the guy run back. And he pulled the\ndoor open and there I was. So, he poked a rifle in my gut and he yelled, \"Da ist er,\"\nthere he is. So, then I knew that they knew that they were looking for somebody.",
        "A: So, then he said, \"Where's your friend?\" I said, \"I'm the only one here.\" They said,\n\"Well, it will be more pleasant if you go with somebody.\" So, I kept saying I was the\nonly one. They said, \"Go upstairs, get your toothbrush, and get on the bike.\" And I\ncould have escaped many times on the way to their headquarters, but they would go\nright back and pick up the family there.",
        "A: Not that I was involved, simply that there was a man that lived there, or a boy, a man\nwho was not working for them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And then at headquarters they asked me many questions and you saw the ID cards.",
        "A: Now, Jews had a great big purple J on them.",
        "A: Of course, I'm not Jewish and I didn't have that. But they still thought with the dark\nhair maybe I could be Jewish. I said, \"No.\" They said, \"Drop your pants.\" Well, I'm not\ncircumcised, so I said, \"Okay.\"",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But then they said, \"You have to be punished.\" And but they didn't really know what\nto do with me. So, they said, \"Let's take you to the gestapo in the town across the river.\"\nAnd there the gestapo questioned me again. They never beat me. They never hurt me.\nBut my story was good.",
        "A: I'm a student up north. I came down here for a vacation. In September the trains\nstopped running for civilians, so I got stuck here.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And it was so simple and it was partially true.",
        "A: So, then they said, \"Well, you don't work for us. You have to be punished.\" There\nwas a hard labor camp, Klein ErikA:",
        "A: It was called Klein ErikA: There was also a camp called ErikA:",
        "A: And it was very bad.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Klein Erika was the German name for it, but also in Dutch Small ErikA:",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, it wasn't too bad.",
        "A: The camp commander had been a professor at the university in (inaudible). And the\nguy in charge of the work detail had also been a professor. But when the war got bad,\nthey were drafted and put in charge of a hard labor camp. \"When one man escapes,\nshoot two,\" you know. But",
        "A: Yeah. And they had hostages. And the first morning when a new person came 1n,\nthey selected so many of them to become a hostage.",
        "A: And then the old hostages were not hostages anymore.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I run the risk. So, I looked at my buddies and said, \"If one of your guys goes, I will\ngo with you,\" but nobody ran away.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Well, we were marched off every morning to work somewhere, install trenches and\ngunnery placements or unload barges and do any kind of hard labor.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: When you marched, you had to sing; right?",
        "A: Pardon? Oh, yeah. When we were marching through the town, we had to sing. And\nwe had about, I think, 25 soldiers, then came the group. Then we came, soldiers on the\nside. And then behind us again we marched in fives. And behind us again, 25 soldiers.\nAnd two firemen from Rotterdam had been picked up in a raid. They were still in\nuniform. They had jumped off a train to Germany and were put in our camp. And they\nwere there, one on the left and one on the right. And then the group leader would go and\nlead a song. The guy on the left would call the name of the song. And then the guy on\nthe right would call (German phrase) whenever the feet came down and then we all\nburst out in song.",
        "A: I can't sing. And I was a hostage and I was miserable and I didn't like it. So, I\nmarched along quite grim.",
        "A: One of the guards along the side noticed that I wasn't singing. So, he came in behind\nme and beat me with a rifle butt and told me to sing. So, I sang off tune and I brought a\nwhole bunch of others out of, out of tune. Another guard heard the discord and finally\nfound out the source and beat me with a rifle butt again and told me to shut up, \"Halt\nmund.\"",
        "A: \"Keep your trap shut.\"",
        "A: So, I marched along. And a soldier saw that I wasn't singing, so I got beaten again.\nAnd then after that, I just mouthed it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I didn't have no more problems, but it took three beatings.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We were digging trenches for, along the river",
        "A: at gunnery placements and ammunition bunkers. We also unloaded barges, did all\nsorts of stuff. Once in a while, we had to unload the barge with carbide. Carbide makes\nacetylene gas, so it comes in steel drums. Two men could easily lift them and then pick\nthem up and roll them down the gangway",
        "A: to shore. So, we would break it, crack it, and made sure that it ran into the water.\nSo, a lot of gas would come out and the Germans would scream and panic.",
        "A: Yeah. And everybody would be evacuated and sent to wait until the boat stopped.\nSo, we got a break that way.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The evening of the same day.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: My story was simple and good.",
        "A: The train stopped running for civilians. I couldn't get back and that's why I'm here.",
        "A: No. That was further south. The allies didn't come up September, '44, it was not part\nof Holland. And, actually, later on in '45 our area was liberated before the western part\nof Holland.",
        "A: We were digging the trenches",
        "A: from the bridges across the river. One was a railroad bridge. The other one was a\ntraffic bridge. And the allies would come by and try and bomb these. And then the\nGermans would and also heavy antiaircraft. And when the shells broke, of course the\nfragments have to come down again. So, we would sit in the trench and have the shovels\nover our head for the",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The guy next to me had one land on his shoulder. He was wearing an overcoat and a\njacket. Both had padded shoulders",
        "A: but it tore both padding out and it knocked him down.",
        "A: But he, he had a sore shoulder, but it didn't break the skin. Thanks for reminding me.",
        "A: Well, you've maybe heard about the Battle of Arnhem or A Bridge Too Far.\" It was a\nmovie. Well, the allies were on the south side of the river. The Germans were digging in\nand the allies were shooting them. So, they lost too many troops. So, they decided that\nthey had expendables in camps. So, our camp was one of the camps that provided labor\nto the area. And that night, it was my turn and there was always confusion. The gates\nwere open. It was a blackout, quite dark. Two guards came marching towards each other\nand presented arms, about face, and marched back. And they did it and I watched them\nfor a while. And, like I say, it was very black out. And the trucks were there ready to\ndrive off. The gates were open. And I went up there and walked out.",
        "A: Yeah. I had nothing to lose. Not too far away was the house of a friend of mine.\nNow, he and his father were in hiding somewhere. But I knocked on the door and I\nborrowed a bicycle there and went back to my apartment the other side of the river.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: It had even tires.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But she never saw the bike again.",
        "A: Yeah, but I didn't go to her house.",
        "A: I went to the house where I had been arrested, where I'd been in hiding.",
        "A: Well, my grandmother's house was right in between two estates that the Germans\noccupied. Actually, my grandmother's garage had a cannon in it. The Germans had put\nit there.",
        "A: Yeah. And at that time, somehow she had been able to stay in the house. And later\non, she was kicked out and the Germans took over. But",
        "A: No, it was about March.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: I didn't think that the camp would really know who had brought me there. So,",
        "A: And where else could I go?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I stayed there. And, gosh, we had, we had weapons. We had stun guns.",
        "A: So, our group went near the bridge across the canal. The river was further to the east.\nAnd the Canadians were coming up on that side. So, we were supposed to hold the\nbridge in case they came, the Canadians came across. They never did. And then one day\nthe Germans came and they wanted our house. So, we could not go there.",
        "A: And that night the Germans ambushed the guys that were at the bridge and they were\nwiped out.",
        "A: And the farmer and his wife were hung in the door of the barn.",
        "A: There was a farm, and the farmer and his wife were strung up in the door of the barn.",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: Then later on we were asked a German General Blaskowitz had been in the southern\npart of Holland or not the southern, central part of Holland. And he had been harassed\nthere. Then he was in Hilversum where the allies had their headquarters. And he had\ncome to our area and we were asked to harass him. And, so, we went and cut his wires,\ntelephone wires across there was a small road into the woods with three rows of birches\non each side. It was somekind of a fire break. But there were two paths you could walk\nthrough more or less.",
        "A: There were several houses, summer homes that now the Germans occupied. The\ntelephone wires strung through, across the road through the trees.",
        "A: And we were asked to cut the wires.",
        "A: They said that I was the most technical, so it was my job. But we had to pull down\nthe wires and cut out about six feet so they couldn't just splice them back. And we did.\nAnd then we cut several wires. Then somehow the Germans started blowing whistles\nand they all barged out and started shooting at each other and we backed out through the\nwoods. I had a whole bunch of wires wrapped around my waist.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That was about March or April, yeah.",
        "A: Near the end of the war.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: We did ourselves.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, the Canadians were on the east side of the River IJssel and the resistance\ndecided to like I said, there were two estates with ammunition in them and a small\ngroup of Germans. But then they decided that we could take over.",
        "A: So, we went to talk with the officer of the Germans and he said he would not\nsurrender to terrorists, only to an allied officer, equal or superior rank. But he also said\nthat we could blow him up so he would not do anything anymore. And we put a guard",
        "A: next to the place for there was a chance that people in the town would come up and\nharass them.",
        "A: So, it was very how would you call it quite friendly actually.",
        "A: And then we waited until the Canadians came close, and we got one officer to come\nover and they surrendered.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, they disappeared. I don't know where they went.",
        "A: I guess to a POW camp.",
        "A: No, that was later. That was probably, yeah, late April.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: What did we do? Get drunk.\n(Laughter)",
        "A: No, I don't really know. We became the police force.",
        "A: Yeah. We, we then had to guard the bridge and we also we had to be recruited.\nSeveral people from the village, we taught them how to shoot, just operate a rifle and\ngave them, I guess, about five or six rounds to shoot. And then from headquarters, they\nwould police the areA:",
        "A: And we were police. And then we felt that our resistance group, that we had done\nenough and wanted out, but we couldn't.",
        "A: We became part of the internal military forces.",
        "A: And the only way to get out was to join the regular military. So, we all signed up for\nthe Army, the Navy,",
        "A: Air Force, and the Marine Corps.",
        "A: And two other guys and I were called by the Marines. My brother was called by the\nAir Force. And then they said, \"We have enough pilots. Why don't you go and work at a\nfarm for a while.\" So, he went into the expeditionary forces. He was trained in England.",
        "A: Well, I trained here with American Marines for the final hit against Japan. But then\nwhile we were training, Japan surrendered. And we had signed up for the duration of the\nwar plus so many months. But at the bottom of the contract it said unless the Minister of\nthe Army or the Navy decides otherwise.",
        "A: So, he decided otherwise and we finished our training and were sent to Java and\nwere there for two and a half years.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, got shot at by people that wanted to be free like we wanted to be.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That was Sukarno?",
        "A: Yeah, Sukarno.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: I was in Hattem.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think she did.",
        "A: She didn't want to know. Yes, she did for in the beginning sometimes we would at\nnight clean our stun guns. So, she, she knew, but",
        "A: In the Marine Corps we went first to Scotland to a transient camp and then came here\nto the states. But it was in Scotland I told them that my father or my parents lived in\nEngland.",
        "A: The sergeant in charge of our group they were all professionals who didn't really\nlike us for we were much better educated than they were.",
        "A: So, he said to write a letter to request a pass.",
        "A: But he never, he never sent the letter or gave the letter to the headquarters.",
        "A: Then I was in transport for AmericA: And, so, I went to the headquarters and\nwanted to talk to the Colonel. Well, I talked to a Captain and I told him",
        "A: I had copied the letter. I had just written another one. I said, \"My parents live here. I\nhaven't seen them since '38, and I had requested transport.\" And he looked at it and he\ncalled out he signed the orders and gave me money. And he called the Sergeant that had\nrefused to give my request and he caught hell. And I was on the train a few hours later\nto London.",
        "A: And then my father was in America. So, I never saw him.",
        "A: In Watford just outside London.",
        "A: And my younger brother I think was six years old.",
        "A: And he spoke English very fast and I wasn't all that good. So, I asked him to slow\ndown. And he looked up at me and said, \"Don't be silly.\"",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, for the Marine Corps I had applied for the artillery or the tanks. But I was\ngiven some kind of aptitude test. And I'm good with tools, so they made me a motor\nmechanic and a driver. So, I learned to drive the jeeps, the trucks and tanks, any of the\nmotor vehicles. And they made me a motor mechanic.",
        "A: Pardon?\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: How you learned to drive a stick shift.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, I didn't know anything I was in England in a truck. I knew how to drive\na civilian car.",
        "A: And the trucks there needed double clutching. What did I know about double\nclutching so I could shift? But",
        "A: It was with the left hand. But I really screeched the gears.",
        "A: Yeah.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You used to take your cigarette packs and put them on\ntop of the wheel.",
        "A: Oh, that was later in AmericA:\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Oh, okay.",
        "A: The Royal Netherlands Marine Corps.",
        "A: Yeah.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: He was being trained by the American Marine Corps, but\nas a member of the Royal Dutch Marines.",
        "A: Yeah. I drove more, but",
        "A: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: I came back to Holland for demobilization and then I went to England. And I gota\njob there with grass dryers. England and Europe did not have dollars, and cattle food\nwith high protein and carotene was very scarce. It had to come from here.",
        "A: They had no dollars. So, there was a Dutchman that found out that if you dried grass,\nit grows to about four to six inches high very quickly.",
        "A: It was high in carotene and protein.",
        "A: Yeah, for cattle. And then it could be ground up.",
        "A: And these were not small factories. And I got involved with that company through\nmy father.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And the somehow with the grass dryers my first job would be to lay out the anchor\nbolts in the concrete slabs and then supervise the building of these things. I have a\npicture somewhere. I don't know where.",
        "A: And then there was a brick furnace on one end to heat the air. And then there was a\nrotating drum and the cyclone where the air the grass was blown in, chopped up, and\nthen dried quickly; high protein, high carotene. And then it was ground into meal and\nthen made into pellets for cattle food.",
        "A: Oh, until 1950. And then I, I that job gave an awful lot of free time. It was a very\ngenerous salary. So, I was doing quite well and I sailed a lot in the free time. I sailed the\nsouth coast of England and the Channel.\nAnd then in 1950 we decided that it might be fun to sail across to over here and then\nrace in the transatlantic race back to England.",
        "A: So, in '50 I quit my job and went sailing.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, of course.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And then on the steamer across I met a woman who didn't want the fish. The ship\nwas on the way out to the North SeA: When lunch was served, there was open tables. I\nhad already reserved a seat at another table, but",
        "A: Soup was served. Then the steward came by with fish.",
        "A: And the woman next",
        "A: Yeah. Then the steward came by with the second serving of fish. And the woman\nnext to me refused and said, \"No, I don't want the fish. I have to go on deck to wave to\nsomebody before we pass the yoke of Holland.\" So, the steward asked would I mind to\ntake her dish and I said, \"No.\" We smiled at each other.",
        "A: And then I got her fish dish and she never came back. Then later on the afternoon\nshe was sitting on the deck chair on deck and I asked her if she had been able to get\nback on the deck on time. And then we would still talk.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah. Then we had decided we might like to get married. So, she went to\nWashington, D.C., and I went to Stamford, Connecticut.",
        "A: When I told my father that I wanted to go back to the states and knock around, he\nsaid, \"But you know about grass dryers. They don't need them in AmericA: They're no\ngood. Learn to milk cows.\"",
        "A: He said, \"In the midwest, a good dairy, you can always find a job if you run out of\nmoney.\" So, I had to work as a pupil and pay a farm to learn to milk by hand",
        "A: first. He said, \"Learn to milk by hand first.\" So, after a couple months, they gave me\na good record, a letter, and I went to another farm to learn to milk by machine.",
        "A: No. That was",
        "A: In the states, in England.",
        "A: Then when I came to Stamford, a friend of the family there had just bought a farm in\nVermont and needed somebody. And, well, I went with them for I needed a job. And I\nmilked cows for a while. And then we got married in Vermont. But then I came down\nhere to (inaudible) Manor and they needed a dairy manager. So, it worked out for a\nwhile. And then somehow",
        "A: Yes, until we retired. Then we went to FloridA: Well, every winter we took a\nvacation and we went to FloridA:",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And then in, in well, yeah, I fell and hurt my shoulder in FloridA: I couldn't climb a\nladder anymore to take the ventilators off the roof during a hurricane. And David said,\n\"You're too far away. If something happens to you guys, I can't just rush over. Why\ndon't you come here.\" So,",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And a granddaughter.",
        "A: And a daughterinlaw.",
        "A: And a grandson.",

        "A: Pardon?\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You were responsible for a German officer getting shot.",
        "A: Oh, that was still just after liberation.",
        "A: When the resistance took over and became the police force, then we had several\nother guys that enlisted as police. But I taught them. I was in charge of a whole bunch of\nweapons,",
        "A: also European and American. I would teach them how to shoot a few rounds and\nthat was it.",
        "A: And they would unload the weapons. And I told them that because upstairs we had\nseveral prisoners, all Nazis, that normally you're taught to hold the weapon up and\nunload it. But we said, \"Hold it between your legs and if somehow a round goes off, it\ngoes through the floor.\"",
        "A: And that went fine. And then one day I think it was a Sergeant of the Professional\nDutch Army came in",
        "A: in uniform and he saw the guys unload rifles. Then he took over and said, \"No way.\"\nThere were people living above us. And he just counted five rounds. But some of the\nguys would hold the top round down and put another one in the chamber and then close\nthe bolt. So, they had six. It went fine for a while. But then he hit one with six and it\nfired and went through the floor and killed the guy, the third highest Nazi in the, Dutch\nNazi in Holland.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "A: No, he was Dutch.",
        "A: He was Dutch Nazi.",
