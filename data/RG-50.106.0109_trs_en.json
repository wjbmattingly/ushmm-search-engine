        "A: Well, according to the latest arrangements, Przemysl is almost at the border, the\nPolish-Russian border, because Lvov has become a Russian city, it\u2019s not Polish any\nmore. But when I lived there, it was a town of about 60,000 people, of which 22,000\nwere Jewish. I went to a Catholic school. My father didn\u2019t want to send me to the\nHebrew gymnasium because it was co-educational with the boys. So I went to a\nCatholic school. And I find the arrangements that they had were very smart. On 44\nAugust 15, 1998\ngirls, we were 20 Jewish. So we had a religion class. We had to leave the class and\ngo to another, we Jewish girls. And we had a rabbi who came and gave us a lesson\nin religion. I liked the priest better, he was young and handsome. We had to stand up\nat the beginning of our classes and listen. Not say it, but li \u2014 stand in the respect of\ntheir prayer. And we had to stand up before we left for home. That was the only\nthing we had to do. Otherwise, we had our religion class. And we had a few Jewish\nteachers, even though it was a Catholic school. We didn\u2019t have nuns. The only \u2014 the\nonly way they could prove that it was a Catholic school was that we had the prayer\nin the morning and the prayer in the afternoon, which we didn't participate in, we\njust stood and listened, and that was all. Was a very fine school, and a very fine\neducation.",

My father, as a 16 \u2014\nmy grandmother, poor, limping grandmother, who had one leg shorter than the\nother, she was very small, had 11 children, of which 10 were boys and one girl. She\nwas very happy when they took off and went to America. The boys. I know of two\nAugust 15, 1998\nwere here, living here in \u2014 in New York, but my father came here as a 16 year old\nboy. He was a very handsome boy and he was addicted to the theater, to the Yiddish\ntheater. So when he came to New York, besides learning a trade to become a tailor,\nhe joined the Yiddish theater in New York. And I grew up on stories of great Boris\nTomachevsky and Luther Adler. And he played with a young boy by the name of\nMuni(ph) Weisenthal, which was pel \u2014 Paul Muni later. And I still remember my\nfather in Poland, in a Jewish theater, where he played King Lear.",
        "Q: King Lear in Yiddish?",
        "A: In Yiddish, absolutely. But, after staying in New York City for 11 years in very,\nvery poor conditions, he got sick. He had TB. And at that time TB was not easily\ncured as it is now, so he was so frightened that he took a boat and went back to\nmama, to Poland. He never returned. But we lived with New York times all the\ntime and I lived with the stories of the Yiddish theater, and that was my dream when\nI was a young girl, to come to New York.",
        "Q: What was your father\u2019s name?",
        "A: Isadore(ph). I remember him in the Yiddish theater, and so was my mother. I\nthink they met in the Yiddish theater. My father was an extremely handsome man.",

        "A: Yeah, I know. He \u2014 he did very well in his profession, he was very successful, he\nhad a good business, and he had workers working for him. He specialized in ladies\u2019\ncoats and suits, no dresses, and he used me as a model. He would say, put on a coat\nand go for a walk. My mother helped him in the business and he was very\nsuccessful. My father by \u2014 he \u2014 he used to call himself a \u2014 a \u2014 a socialist. He be \u2014 he\nbelonged to the Polish socialist party. And when the Russians cov \u2014 came into our\ntown, I was very concerned about him because he was wealthy, very well known.\nThey didn\u2019t touch him. They didn\u2019t touch him. He closed his business and he was\nsitting home, working there, and he survived. I was afraid they will take him to\nSiberia. And I shouldn\u2019t have been afraid, it would have been better had they \u2014 had\nthey taken him. Well, they didn't. When the Germans came in, he became one of the\n\u2014 you \u2014 are you familiar with the Judenrat?",

        "Q: Yeah, let\u2019s talk a little bit about your mother\u2019s family.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s family. I don\u2019t remember my mother\u2019s family as well as my\nfather\u2019s. He \u2014 she had a sister, older sister who lived also in PrzemysSl. They all \u2014\nwho had \u2014 they had three children, two boys and a girl, they all died, m-my mother\u2019s\nsister and her family, they all died. She also had a brother who worked for my\nAugust 15, 1998\nfather, he was a tailor and was married and had a little boy. They all died. From my\nfamily, nobody survived. I\u2019m the only one, unfortunately. From my husband\u2019s\nfamily, his father and mother came to Przemysl during the war, we got them there.\nWe thought we can take better care of them. I took them to the train.",
        "Q: So, what was your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: Anna. She was a very, very smart, clever woman. She was the one to \u2014 who\nencouraged me to go into hiding during the war.",
        "Q: Well again, we\u2019ll talk about that later.",
        "A: Yes, we will talk about.",

        "Q: How religious was your house, yo-you \u2014",
        "A: It was, I would say a standard religious home. In other words, my father was a\npresident of a shul, oh yes, and he used to take me with him where men were\nAugust 15, 1998\npraying, until I rebelled one day and I said I don\u2019t want \u2014 I want to go where women\nare, and to this day it bothers me when I sit together with men. But my mother was\nless religious. She would be in the store on a Friday and she would forget to light the\ncandles, or couldn\u2019t go home. She would say to me, go home and light the candles,\nso Father wouldn\u2019t know. He didn't like it. He was \u2014 he was a \u2014 in his way he was a\nreligious man, yes. He \u2014 he \u2014I used to love Seders because my father would come\nhome freshly shaven from the barber, smelling of powder and \u2014 and we would sit at\nthe table and he would say dom(ph) sefredyah(ph) and instead of doing that, I\nwould do this [indecipherable] always \u2014 he always smiled at me when we did that.",
        "Q: These are the plagues?",
        "A: Yes. He was very well known in town. My father had \u2014 my mother was the brain\nof the family, my father was the heart. He had a big heart. From the age of 10 to 18,\nI went every summer with my father for a whole month of July, to the Polish Tatra\nmountains. There was a resort in that Polish Tatra mountains on the \u2014 almost on the\nCzechoslovakian border, where people with TB would come, first of all because of\nthe weather. It was marvelous, it was in demand. Secondly, they had special waters.\nThere was one water that was specially for people with lung problems, and the water\nwas later bottled and sold in pharmacies. So we went every year, and he would\nalways rent two rooms. I never slept in the same room where my father was. I was\nAugust 15, 1998\nnot allowed to enter the room where my father slept, he was so afraid that I might\ncatch the TB from him, although he was under doctors\u2019 care. A \u2014 but nevertheless,\nhe always rented two rooms with an adjoining ba-balcony, and I \u2014 one was for me,\nand one was for him. And we would fight constantly, he and I, constantly. Every\nyear at the end of the season when we were in those mountains, I would say, I will\nnever go with you again. He says, if you pay me I wouldn\u2019t go with you. Until the\nnext year. And the next year, May came, I saw his eyes looking at me and he says,\nare you Starting to pack? And we went. We left Mother in the store, she was\nprobably very glad to get rid of us. And \u2014",
        "Q: What was the name of the town?",
        "A: Przemysl.",
        "Q: No, no, the \u2014 th-the resort in the mountains.",
        "A: Oh, the resort. That\u2019s hard, Szezawnica, s-z-c \u2014 c-z-a-w-n-i-c-a, Szezawnica. It\nwas a place that was \u2014 there was no train station there, there was no bus. So we went\nto the nearest town and we hired a taxi and we would go there. And the reason I am\ntelling you this is because I was about 14 years old, I always travel with my music, I\nplayed piano. And my father had very few requirements of me, but one of those was\nthat he rented always for me, a piano, where I could go and play an hour a day,\npractice my piano. We arrived to the station, and those Jews living there knew him,\nAugust 15, 1998\nbecause he was there year after year after year. So they were waiting for him to\narrive. And as soon as we arrived, they would tell him something, something very\nimportant, and he would turn to me and say, do you have your music with you? I\nsaid, yes, of course I have my music, I always have it. He says, well, there is a\u2014a\nfamily, a mother and father, Jewish family and two children and they are very poor\nand they don\u2019t have enough food. So I, being a spoiled little thing, I said to him,\nFather, I don\u2019t understand, if they are so poor, why do they go to a summer resort?\nWhich was a logical question. But he was enraged. He says, you mean to tell me that\nthe \u2014 only the wealthy can have good air and good waters? We have to do something\nabout it, he decided. He says to me, do you have that pink chiffon dress that the\ndressmaker just finished for you? I said yes, I have it. He looked at my hair and he\nsaid, we\u2019 ll take you to the hairdresser and have some very nice curls made. And I\nsaid, what do you have in mind? You\u2019re going to play the piano, we\u2019ll give a concert\nand we\u2019ll collect money. I said no, I\u2019m not going, I am not prepared to give any\nconcert. I was 14 years old. He says, we will find a boy who\u2019ll play the fiddle. And\nif they see a girl and a boy playing, who cares whether you playing well or not?\nWe'll collect the money. And here\u2019s exactly what he did. He hired a place, he found\na boy, I played with my music because I didn\u2019t memorize anything, and he, he didn't\nAugust 15, 1998\ncare, he collected the money for the people. That was my father, always caring about\npeople, a lot.",
        "Q: You had said that he was politically oriented.",
        "A: Yes, he was a social \u2014 he used to say he was a socialist and I would \u2014 I would\njoke and say, a wealthy socialist.",
        "Q: So you would describe your family as being upper class?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, I would describe as being \u2014 he never mastered the Polish language\nand I felt very embarrassed because of that. He \u2014 he spoke English, he spoke\nYiddish, and they spoke Yiddish to each other, but never to me.",
        "Q: What did you speak to him?",
        "A: Polish. And I offered him that I would teach him Polish. He didn't want to. But I\nfound later that the knowledge of Yiddish was very helpful to me. I didn\u2019t know I\nknew it. When I came to Munich, Germany, and I taught piano in a DP camp, I had\nchildren from all over Europe, but they didn\u2019t speak German and they didn\u2019t speak\nPolish. So I didn't know how to reach them. I started with my broken Yiddish, and\nthat\u2019s the way I reached them. That\u2019s the mail.",
        "Q: What kind of neighborhood did you live in?",
        "A: I lived like you would live here, let\u2019s say on Connecticut Avenue. The main\nstreet of the city.\nAugust 15, 1998",

        "Q: And did you \u2014",
        "A: It was a lovely city. We never had any crime, we never had to lock our doors\nwhen we went out. When \u2014 there was one taxi standing at the station and if\nsomebody took that taxi, the whole town knew it. At the same \u2014 at this \u2014 at the house\nwhere we lived, downstairs were three \u2014 two young ladies. They were not so young,\nthey were older. Unmarried, who had a \u2014 a store with sweets; candies and things like\nthat. And that was my mother\u2019s favorite store, she \u2014 there was a chair for her there\nand she would always sit in the evening and chat with them. I never had to pay for\nanything. I didn't need any money. As soon as I say who I am, it went on paper and\nmy mother later paid for 1t somehow, I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: After that I started to go to a conservatorium, which was Ukrainian, in Przemysl.\nThere \u2014 it was a very, very funny arrangement because I \u2014 I didn\u2019t speak Ukrainian,\nbut I could understand it. They spoke to me in Ukrainian, I answered in Polish, and\nwe understood each other.",
        "Q: This is a music school?",
        "A: Music, yes, where I studied piano, yes.",
        "Q: Did you notice when you were younger, even in those eight grades or 1n the\nconservatory, any indication of anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Absolutely not. Absolutely not. In all my years in that school, I have never heard\nsomething said against Jews, or against us as Jewish girls. As I said, we \u2014 I had \u2014 I\nhad two \u2014 three teachers who were Jewish. I didn\u2019t feel at all, any anti-Semitism.\nAnd I think my hu \u2014 from what my husband was telling me he felt very comfortable\nin his school too.\nAugust 15, 1998",

Well, I used to joke because when my\nmother \u2014 mother has a pair of very beautiful diamond earrings, and she \u2014 that was\nher pride and joy, and she kept it in a safe deposit. When sh \u2014 I knew when the\nJewish holiday is coming because Mother took out her earrings, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself? Were you a very independent child? Were\nyou \u2014",
        "A: I was totally immersed in my studies. Totally. I\u2014 well, of course my father was\nvery strict as far as boys are concerned. I mean, there was no dating, absolutely\nnothing But I \u2014 I was a very good scholar in school, and I also had to spend a lot of\ntime pratic \u2014 practicing my piano.

        "Q: Were you interested in sports, or art?",
        "A: No, no, the only sport my father allowed me was tennis. He did not allowed me g\n\u2014 to go skating. He was afraid that I probably break my leg, probably. I wasn\u2019t\nparticularly \u2014 but, in Przemysl, the city is divided by a river. A river with very, very\nclean water. And in the summer we had kind of a arrangement. They built a wooden\n\u2014 wooden cabanas at the edge of the river. And it was done very smartly, that you\ndidn\u2019t feel that you have a proper figure and you wanted to have a b \u2014 wear a\nbathing suit. You could go to the wood cabana, there were steps there going down\ninto the water. You could emerge in the water without being seen by anybody. And\nthis is how we spend our summers, beautifully. Beautiful river. It was a good life, it\nwas a very peaceful life, until the war.",
        "Q: Yeah. What kind of relationship did you have with your mother?",
        "A: My mother used to whack me, until I was 16 years old. And she used a coppered\nbeater as her favorite object, and I got my beating only for the piano lessons. You\nsee, I had a notebook. For each piano lesson she would write in the date, what was\nmy next assignment and at the bottom was a mark from each lesson. If I had a A ora\nB, it was all right. If I had a C, I was licked. And yet, she was my best friend. When\nI grew up, she was my best friend. When I got married, it was already 1940. Times\nwere starting to be very bad, I discovered that I\u2019m pregnant, and I went to my\nAugust 15, 1998\nmother and I said, Mother, I am pregnant. She didn\u2019t \u2014 she didn\u2019t bat an eyelid. She\nsaid, then we have to get an abortion. She went with me. She got the doctor. In\nPoland, to get an abortion 1s like to spit. As long you have enough money, no\nproblem. She got the women doctor and another doctor who was present. She took\nme there. I got an abortion. She says, you cannot have a baby now. And if I had that\nbaby, I wouldn\u2019t have survived, that\u2019s for sure. And after that she said to me, you\ncan rest for 10 minutes, then we walk back home. And we walked home, and on the\nway there she must have seen that I was tired. She said \u2014 we passed an ice cream\nparlor and she says, would you like some ice cream? So we sat down. She was a\nvery smart woman. She treated me to the ice cream, then she took me home.\nWalking, mind you. And then, when we came home, she said, Father must not know\nabout it. You go now, undress and go to bed and lie down. But at dinnertime I want\nyou dressed, sitting at the table, eating dinner with your father. And this 1s exactly\nwhat I did. He never knew that. He was much more sentimental that she was. She\nwas a very great realist. She knew what is going on. Very smart woman.",

        "A: Weitz. W \u2014 w-e-i-t-z, Weitz.",

        "A: It\u2019s funny, I wasn\u2019t aware of it at all. I mean, I knew he is in Germany, but we\nwere \u2014 this seemed so far away. Total \u2014 we were totally not concerned about it. Even\nin \u201938 I wasn\u2019t concerned about it. In \u201939, when he finally attacked Poland, this is\nwhen I realized that very hard times are coming.",
        "Q: So, up to September 1939, your life went on?",
        "A: Was very peaceful, very peaceful. I met my husband when I was 14 years old. I\nhad a cousin who lived in Lvov. She was a perpetual matchmaker. And she probably\nfigured out, here is that boy who \u2014 he was a \u2014 kind of tutoring children on the upper\nfloor where she lived, and she thought he was a very nice boy, she liked him. And\nhere I have that cousin of mine who is 14, let me introduce them to each other. And\nshe did that. She invited me for \u2014 for Pesach, to come and visit with her, and I did.\nAnd I went there and she introduced me to that boy. And he \u2014 the first thing he\nasked me was to go for a walk in the park with him. And I forgot my gloves and my\nhands were very cold, and I was always preoccupied about my hands because of the\npiano. So we were walking in the park and he took my hands into his hands and he\nsay \u2014 he was \u2014 see, he said to me, I will always keep you warm. He was ready to go\nto medical school, and there was innumerous clauses in Poland, as you know. And\nas his brother lived in Italy, in Genoa, and was a very known dentist, he was ready\nto go to his brother to study medicine. So when \u2014 he took me to the train when I left,\nAugust 15, 1998\nbrought me some flowers, and I came home and my father said, what are those\nflowers from? And I said, well, a boy gave it to me. My father said, throw it away.\nHe went to Genoa and he wrote letters to me, and of course I wasn\u2019t allowed to date\nanyhow, so there was no danger of my dating, but \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re still 14?",
        "A: Iam 14. And for vacation he came to Poland, so he came to us to visit us. And\nmy mother was absolutely crazy about him.",
        "Q: His name?",
        "A: Julian. He was \u2014 he was her ideal. He was very well dressed, very sophisticated,\nit seemed to her. And my father would say, well, it seems he is a nice boy, but \u2014\nthere was always a but \u2014 you are too young.",
        "Q: He would come to school to wait for me and my girlfriends were so jealous. But\nof course I didn\u2019t date anybody else, and \u2014 and it \u2014 I waited for him seven years. Oh,\nI \u2014 one didn\u2019t get married, not unless your husband can support you. So I waited for\nhim seven years. And then he came to Poland in 1938, and he was stuck; 1939 the\nwar started. So that\u2019s where our tragedy started.",
        "Q: So wha \u2014 when did you get married, what date?",

        "A: Yes. We wrote \u2014 he wrote letters and I answered him letters. And I \u2014 I felt very\ncomfortable with his family. I \u2014 I really fitted very well with his cousins, his aunts,\nhis parents, I liked them very much.",
        "Q: Did he \u2014 did he talk about what was happening in Germany at all? Was he\naware?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t talk much about it. No, he was in Italy, having a very good time, living\nwith his brother and sister-in-law in a beautiful apartment. So, we didn't talk about\nit. It seemed so remote at the time.",

        "A: Not in Poland. And if \u2014 and it\u2019s funny because Julian was living in Italy, where\nMussolini was at that time. But this was before he \u2014 he w \u2014 formed the friendship\nwith Hitler. And Mussolini at the time was very nice to Jews there. He changed\nlater. So, in 19 \u2014 you know, Przemysl has quite a past in politics. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 not\na \u2014I don\u2019t think a lot of people know about it. But in 1939, the Germans came from\nthe west, the Russians from the east, and this is where they met, in Przemysl. The\nriver was the border. And it stayed like that for almost a year, until 1940. And then I\n\u2014at that time I lived in Lvov with my husband, we got married and I lived there in\nthe beginning. But my father was telling me later that one night, without any\npreparation or anything, they were not aware that it\u2019s coming. They started shooting\nat each other, the Germans and the Russians, and it was in my town. And my father\nsaid it was the most heroic shooting that he has ever witnessed. For some reason, the\nRussians must have gotten an order to just leave it and pull back. So they did. Asa\nAugust 15, 1998\nconsequence the \u2014 the Germans occupied the whole city. And that\u2019s when the\ntrouble started. [break]",

I\nknow only that the war was, without \u2014 without pity, without \u2014 without any \u2014 they\nwere so \u2014 the Russians were fighting beautifully, but they had an order to leave the\nwhole city and move back. So they left the city and the Germans consequently\nmoved in. And this is when trouble started.",
        "Q: What was your first impressions of the Germans?",
        "A: Well, I didn't \u2014 I really didn\u2019t realize what is going on. At first I saw some simple\nsoldiers in the city, the SS didn\u2019t move in yet. And it was relatively peaceful in the\nbeginning. They didn't start right away with the ghetto, the ghetto was formed much\nlater. But my father was very depressed, he probably felt that it\u2019s going to be very\nhard. And the first thing they did is to choose a Judenrat. You know what a\nJudenrat is?",
        "Q: The Jewish council.",
        "A: The Jewish council. And my father was chosen as one of those. So we always\nthought that because he is a part of the Judenrat he is relatively safe. The first thing\nthat I remember is that we were sitting in our apartment, 1t was \u2014 we were not in the\nghetto yet, there was no ghetto yet. And a few German soldiers knocked at our door\nAugust 15, 1998\nand I came to the door. And my father was sitting in the dining room at the table.\nThey didn\u2019t see him. And I came to the door and they ask me whether there are any\nmen in the house? And I said no, it\u2019s just me and my mother. And they looked at\nme, they \u2014 they thought about it for a moment, and they left. They didn\u2019t go in. Had\nthey gone in they probably would have taken my father, that was the first time I\nsaved him. And \u2014",

You know, they wanted\nmoney from the members of the Judenrat and you had to collect the money to give\nit to them to pacify them. And then my father came home one day and said, I think\nwe are going to move to a ghetto. They are forming a ghetto.",
        "Q: Were there many refugees from other parts of Poland in Tremisz(ph) by then?",
        "A: Not by then. They came later. They formed the ghetto on the other side of the\ncity, which was not primarily Jewish. In other words, it was not occupied by Jews.\nAnd \u2014",

        "Q: You were going to the music school all the way up to the time of the war\nstarting?",
        "A: No. There was one year when I took off. I forgot to tell you about it. I\u2014 I ask my\nfather permission. I wanted to study cosmetology in Lvov, as I had that cousin and I\ncould have stayed with her. It took a year. My father was terribly against it, he said,\nyou want to become a hairdresser? I said, no, as a hairdresser, I want to study\ncosmetology. Well, he said all right. So I went to Lvov and I spent a whole year\nthere. And that was in 1938. And it was a very happy year, very nice year. I worked\nthere and my \u2014 when my husband would come for occasion, he would teach me\nabout skin layers, because he was \u2014 he was a medical student, so he knew more than\nI did. And I spent that year in Lvov, and then I came back home. But \u2014",

        "A: Well, it became, first of all, much more complicated, because there was a\nstruggle for food. There was a struggle for \u2014 the insecurity, especially was very,\nvery, very \u2014 I mean, you didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen the next day. They\nconstantly had different orders, especially with the Judenrat. I used to help out in\nthe Judenrat, my father asked me to come and do some work there. So I would sit\nthere and I would watch them. But this was relatively s \u2014 quiet the first year. When\nit became really bad was when they formed the ghetto.",

        "Q: When?",
        "A: He closed his business when the Russians occupied our part of \u2014 of the city,\nbecause he was afraid that they might send him to Siberia, God forbid. So people\nwho owned businesses closed them most of the \u2014 most of the time they were closed.",

        "A: No. He was very much against Zionism. You know, I had terrible discussions\nwith my father. I was very much in favor of Israel, state of Israel forming, and my\nfather did not. He said \u2014 and I very often think of his words, he said, the Arab state\nwill never let Israel exist. Israel doesn\u2019t stand a chance, he said to me, and I was\nvery angry with him. I said, how can you say that? He says, that\u2019s the truth, why\ndon\u2019t you face it? So now whenever something happens in Israel, I think of my\nfather, yes.",
        "Q: Whe \u2014 when did you decide to get married?",
        "A: Well, when Julian came back from Italy in 1938, end of 1938, beginning of\n1939, we started thinking about it, and eventually we thought, well he is here, he\ndoesn\u2019t \u2014 he has no chance to leave the country and go somewhere else. We \u2014 in the\nbeginning we thought we will get married and then we will go to Italy or whe \u2014\nwhere his brother was. But his brother, when Mussolini made the pact with Hitler,\nhis brother felt that it\u2019s time to leave. So the only country that gave him a visa was\nAustralia and he went to s \u2014 to Brisbane, which we visited him about 10 years ago,\nwe were there. Yeah, he was a very \u2014 he was \u2014 he was a Zionist. His \u2014 his brother\nAugust 15, 1998\nwas \u2014 was a marvelous man.

        "Q: Was it influenced by the fact that the war had started?",
        "A: Yes, absolutely, absolutely, otherwise it would have been probably much larger,\nmuch bigger wedding, but \u2014 and we lived in a small apartment in \u2014 in Lvov, when\none day my father decided that it\u2019s very dangerous in Lvov to be there and we have\nto come to Przemysl. And he sent a \u2014 a truck with some soldiers, I don\u2019t know, he\npaid them probably, I don\u2019t know where he found them. And they came to get us,\nand we went to Przemysl.

But I \u2014 I really don\u2019t remember being involved in \u2014 or worrying about\nwhat I\u2019m going to wear. This was so immaterial at the time. It was not important at\nall. That\u2019s funny. And yet, he and I, both of us, worked outside of the ghetto. It is a\nvery important part of my life. We worked in a place called \u2014 do you know German?",
        "Q: No, but that\u2019s all right.",
        "A: Enklausungstella(ph). It was a place where they have specia \u2014 they had special\nmachines where they brought uniforms from the front, full of lice and other things\nand they put them through those machines to disinfect them, to clean them. We\nwould march out every morning.",
        "Q: We being who?",
        "A: Julian and I. He was with a group of men, I was with the women. And we had\nthe armbands and we were not allowed to walk where people walked, but we had to\ngo where the cars and th \u2014 the horses were going, in the middle of the street. And\nthey would take us every morning out of the ghetto, to that place where we spend\nthe whole day, and in the evening they would \u2014 in the af \u2014 late afternoon they would\nbring us back. The reason why this 1s important 1s because there was one German \u2014 |\ncannot talk about it \u2014 about him without crying \u2014 whom I was so grateful to. The\ndirector of that camp, he was not a Nazi, he was a newspaperman from Berlin. He\nwas lovely. He said to me \u2014 he was always address me the German way, Frau\nAugust 15, 1998\nDoktor, because in German language, the woman gets the title of her husband, if he\nis a doctor. So he would come to me and he would say, I am so ashamed, I am so\nembarrassed, but I know I am being watched. And according to their rules, if\nsomebody was caught stealing something, what could you steal something there? A\ndirty pair of socks or a dirty pair of pants. He has to give them public beating. So\none day he came to me and he said \u2014 there was a 15 year old boy there working, and\nhe was caught stealing the pair of socks, and he says, I am supposed to give him a\npublic licking. Tell him to scream as loud as he can. I will not hurt him, but I have to\npretend that I am doing it, I have been watched. I know I am being watched. So I did\nthat. He didn\u2019t let me work with the \u2014 with the uniforms. He says, you are not going\nto work there. You stay in the kitchen and peel potatoes. And to this day I cannot\npeel potatoes without turning my head away. When the SS would drop in\nsometimes, if they didn\u2019t have any theater or any recreation they thought that they\nwill go, and all the women, young or old, had to undress as God has made them.\nTotally naked. Stand in the row \u2014 I have seen it, and if \u2014 they would look them over,\nand if they didn\u2019t like a pair of breasts, they would hit with the whip. Anyway they\ndidn\u2019t like the back, they would hit in the back. He would come running to the\nkitchen and say to me, you don\u2019t go there. I will hide you and you can take a shower\nwhenever you feel like it. And somebody could have thought that maybe there was a\nAugust 15, 1998\nspecial interest in him in me, and it wasn\u2019t. He was \u2014 he was as much dedicated to\nmy husband as he was to me. He said to me one day, my parents have a farm near\nBerlin, and I\u2019m making some papers for you so you could go there and spend the\nrest of the war there working on that farm. Then somebody gave him out, that he\u2019s\ntoo good to the Jews. And one day they sent him out to the front, to the Russian\nfront. And the first thing I did when I got out of hiding, I tried to find out what has\nhappened to him. And I found a boy who was with him, and he told me that he was\nkilled at the Russian front. I still remember his last name, Burba, b-u-r-b-a. He was\na newspaperman. He was so nice.",
        "Q: How old a man was he?",
        "A: I would say 26 maybe.",
        "Q: He was young?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what was his first name?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember his first name, just the last name. He was very nice. He wasn\u2019t\nnice only to me, he was nice to everybody. He really felt \u2014 he was embarrassed. He\nwas very nice. It shows you that even among them, you could find somebody who\nwas nice. So we worked there, day after day after day until \u2014 until they made another\naktion, as they call it, they tried to get people. And I had a cousin, a young girl, who\nAugust 15, 1998\nwas supposed to go to the train. And my in-laws were supposed to go to the train.\nMy husband couldn\u2019t make himself take them, so I took them. I took them to the\ntrain. Of course, rumors were \u2014 we knew where they are going. They had to\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: How did you know \u2014 how did you know?",
        "A: Rumors. Rumors started that there is a concentration camp, that they gas people.\nBut we all believed that maybe it was exaggeration. You know, nobody wants to\nbelieve that. So I took them to the train and it was started to rain. And my mother-in-\nlaw had beautiful, heavy hair. She didn\u2019t wear anything, and I had a s \u2014 some scarf\naround my neck. So I took it off and put it on her. And she \u2014 she \u2014 she embraced me\nand she said, you tell \u2014 tell my son that I said you will survive the war. I loved my\nmother-in-law. She was the sweetest woman. The nicest person. I never heard a\nword of criticism from her to any of her daughters-in-law. She was lovely. So, that\nwas it. That must have been in the summer of \u00b042.",
        "Q: Right, this is \u2014 we\u2019re talking about July \u00b042.",
        "A: Yes. Must have been maybe later. While we were \u2014 funny how it happens in life.\nWhile we were working in that Enklausungstella(ph), Polish woman \u2014 women used\nto come there to buy some bargains from the Jewish women. We were not allowed\nto carry anything in our hands. So what we did is, I know I had all my \u2014 my\nAugust 15, 1998\nbeautiful pure silk nightgowns, hand embroidered, which I didn\u2019t need. I used to put\none on top of another on myself, and this way I could carry it with me. And that\nPolish woman, whose husband worked in that camp, because some Polish \u2014 Polish\npeople worked in the camp when they were mechanics or they did something with\nthe machines. Her husband worked there, she would come there. And one day we\nwere conducting a transaction, I was selling her my nightgowns, she was buying\nthat. And mind you, she was a total stranger to me. And I was young. And she\nwould say \u2014 she said suddenly to me, my God, you are so young, and you are so\npretty \u2014 I was pretty at the time \u2014 and I feel so sorry for you. If you want to hide,\ncome to me. I was flabbergasted. I says, do you realize what you are saying? Do you\nknow that if you are caught, they put you to death? She said, I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m not\nafraid. She was the happy-go-lucky type. That was our luck. Well, from that day on,\nJulian tried to find out where they lived. And they lived on the other side of the city,\nquite a distance from us. Her husband would come every evening to the ghetto \u2014 is it\nworking? \u2014 to the ghetto wall, and Julian would make a package of our things, and\nthrough the Jewish policeman give it to him, and he would take that home. So, we\nthought, in case we would have to go and hide, we will have some things there. And\nthat was going on for some while, until November \u201942, when the \u2014 when the rumors\nstarted to circulate that there will be a new aktion and they will take people. That\nAugust 15, 1998\nday Julian said, this time we are not going to give anything, we are going out. My\nfather wasn\u2019t home, because if my father had been home, he would never let me go.\nSo my mother said to me, you go better before your father come home \u2014 comes\nhome. We left, it was getting darker, and you know, we had a curfew hour. So we\nhad to be \u2014 go out before the curfew. And as we were going down the stairs to go\nout \u2014 there was no light in the stairway at the time, 1t was dark \u2014 I heard my father\u2019s\nfootsteps, he was coming up. And this stands with me, all those years, I still dream\nof that. And th \u2014 my first impulse was to go to him, but Julian was behind me and\nhe stopped me. And I let my father pass me, and I didn't say goodbye to him. That\nwas the \u2014 the worst thing, I think, in my life. But before we go to that, I \u2014 I have to\nstep back, before I tell you a \u2014\n[break]",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollent \u2014 collection interview with Lena Jurand. This is tape number two, side A.",
        "A: Well, there was one requirement of the SS. One day they came to the Judenrat,\nand they required in a very specific way, they wanted the Judenrat members to do\ntheir dirty work. They needed 1,000 boys, age 12 to 16 being taken from homes.\nAnd that was the only time I saw my father crying. I opened the door, he was\nstanding there crying, and I said, what happened? And he was telling me, and I said\nAugust 15, 1998\nto him, if they want 1,000 boys, you have to give them \u2014 them 1,000 boys. And he\nsaid to me, how can you say that, you are my daughter, how can \u2014 how can I go to\none mother saying, you son will go, and the other mother, your son will stay? Am I\nGod? I said, you have to do it, because if you don\u2019t do it, you know what will\nhappen. The Nazis will take this \u2014 this 1,000 boys, but they will shoot another 1,000\non the way. And he said, you are right. And they let them have 1,000 boys during\nthat particular night. Nobody slept, of course. Of course the boys were never seen\nagain. And I went out in the morning, about six o\u2019clock in the morning, outside.\nThere was not a living soul, nothing. Total stillness. There was not a bird, not a\nwind, not a breeze, nothing. I went into a rage, and I looked up and I said God damn\nyou, wherever you are. This is not the God I want. I don\u2019t want any part of you. And\nwhat\u2019s more, I don\u2019t want you to save me. That was one thing. As you see, it didn\u2019t\nhappen. The other thing was, one day they let me know that the SS came to the\nJudenrat and took all the members of the Judenrat to the train. And I went wild.\nSo I ran to the Judenrat. We didn't live far away, and I had some friends there, and\nthey said to me, don\u2019t go in. He is a wild animal. He just shot some people, he will\nshoot you. And I couldn\u2019t care less. I went in. I didn\u2019t knock at the door, I just\nopened the door, and I can still see him as is it was yesterday. He was the most\nbeautiful young man I have ever seen. Very tall, very blonde, very Nordic looking,\nAugust 15, 1998\nwith blue eyes like two blue ice cubes. And he was leaning on the desk holding in\none hand, in the right hand, he had a \u2014 a gun that was obviously shot a short time\nago, in the other a whip. I opened the door, he didn\u2019t even look at me. And I didn\u2019t \u2014\ndidn\u2019t say anything, I was just standing there. He said to me, what do you want? In\nGerman. So I answered in German. I said, I came to inquire about my father. And I\ntell him he is a member of the Judenrat and I hear that he was taken. He still didn\u2019t\nlook at me. He wasn't interested at all in what I was saying. What puzzled him was\nthat I used such a good German language. That impressed him. He said to me, where\ndid you learn German so well? I said, well German was my best foreign language, I\nhad it eight years in high school. And I \u2014 I really risk a lot, because I was getting\nfresh, and I said, would you like me to recite you some Goethe? Then he looked at\nme and he said, what about your father? I said, well, I hear he is on the train going to\nAuschwitz. He called two germ \u2014 two Jewish policemen and he said, where is that\nman? So they told him he is on the train and they are going to Auschwitz. He said to\nme, you go home and wait. I promise you I will get your father. I didn\u2019t have any\nother \u2014 I had to go. I came home, and all my neighbors were there and my mother.\nAnd when I told them, they said, don\u2019t believe it. Nobody has ever come out of the\ntrain going to Auschwitz. And we waited and waited and was getting dark outside.\nAbout 10 o\u2019clock at night we heard some footsteps. Two Jewish policemen brought\nAugust 15, 1998\nmy father home. Later I was told that they stopped the train on the way and they\nstarted calling his name Salzburg. My father was so fatumult that he didn\u2019t even\nreact to that. But somebody sitting next to him said to him, isn\u2019t that your name? He\nsaid yes. So he got up and went out of the train and those two Jewish policemen\nbrought him home. He was unconscious for about two days. He didn't know what\nwas going on. After he got better and he realized that he is home, he took my hand,\nand he said thank you. So I gave him a \u2014I gave him a-about a year of miserable life,\nbut life. I still to this day don\u2019t understand what made this German keep his word. It\nwas puzzling to me. But he did. They stopped the train, actually. Nobody believed it.\nThose are the two things I wanted to tell you about our ghetto experience. Now,\ngoing back to coming out of the ghetto \u2014",

        "A: Well, we had enough food, because first of all my father was a member of the\nJudenrat, and second we had money to buy the food.

        "Q: Okay. What did other people think of the Judenrat?",
        "A: Well, what do they think? They probably resented it up to a certain extent,\nbecause whenever the Germans needed something, they went to the Judenrat, and it\nwas a vicious circle, and the Judenrat had to accommodate them, to keep peace.\nThey thought they would; of course, they didn\u2019t. And also, everybody was resentful\nAugust 15, 1998\nto a certain extent because they thought that the Judenrat is safe, and it wasn\u2019t. It\nwas just delaying it a little bit.",

        "Q: How was your health at that time?",
        "A: You know, this is the most amazing thing. When we were 22 months in hiding,\nwhen we went out of the ghetto, we bribed \u2014 Julian bribed a Jewish policeman, who\nprobably bribed the other one, and they let us out. They closed their eyes. Julian\nwent with him, with her husband, who led the way, and I was behind, walking. And\nas we had to pass the Gestapo building on the way there. There was no other way to\ngo. And there was a soldier standing, watching. At a certain moment, when Julian\nwas with him, he said, halt. Stopped them. So Julian said \u2014 first he thought he 1s\ngoing to ask for his papers, so he says, I have [speaks foreign language here]\nwhich means, I have a \u2014 I am allowed to walk after curfew. He had that document.\nAugust 15, 1998\nHe says [speaks foreign language], it\u2019s not important. Julian had a \u2014 what do you\ncall it? Not lantern.",
        "Q: Flashlight?",
        "A: Flashlight in his pocket and it just happened that the flashlight was on and the\nlight was seeking through. So he \u2014 that\u2019s why he stopped him. And he thought he \u2014\nhe is going to ask him for papers, and things like that. That was one thing. Then we\ncame there. Now, we came to hide, we were hidden for 22 months, from November\nto August \u00b044. It was a kitchen, you entered, there was a little hall, and a pantry\nwithout the window. That pantry was very important. And then you entered the\nkitchen and there was one room behind the kitchen. There was no separate entrance\nto the room, it had to be through the kitchen. They lived all their lives, especially in\nthe winter, in the kitchen, because there was the stove and it was warm. She\nentertained German soldiers in that kitchen. We were in the room. We could not \u2014\ncan you imagine in 22 months you cannot sneeze, you cannot cough, you cannot say\na lot of word, and you cannot make a \u2014 a loud step, and you cannot be sick. We lived\nlike that in that room for 22 months. There was no toilet in that apartment. In other\nwords, if we wanted to use the facilities, you had to go a half a flight stairs down,\nand there was, probably for \u2014 for many people, there was the facility. People have,\nwhen I talk to my granddaughter\u2019s class about it, one boy got up and said, how did\nAugust 15, 1998\nyou do without a toilet? I said, that\u2019s a good question. There was a fire in th \u2014 in the\nstove, constantly, and that fire helped. Whatever you had to burn, you burned. And\nthe rest you pour out down the drain. So he was satisfied when I explained to him. I\nsaid, believe me, it wasn\u2019t easy. Julian developed such a magnificent sense of\nhearing that he knew what was going on in the kitchen before I knew it. From\ncertain \u2014 he knew which \u2014 which place the floor was squeaking. One time an\nelectrical man came to check the electricity. We didn't know he 1s coming. And of\ncourse he had to come to the room. So that was a \u2014 there was a mirror with a\u2014a\npiece of furniture with a mirror standing in the corner, but cutting off that corner, so\none could hide behind it. Well Julian s \u2014 only heard the words, electricity, and he\npointed to me to go behind that thing and he went under the bed. And the room had\nto look always unoccupied, always. He came in with her, and I heard her say [sighs].\nAnd he looked at the ri \u2014 lamps or something, checked. And when he left, she came\nin and she says, good work guys. The first 10 months, because we accumulate a lot\nof things, of clothing in her house, she would sell 1t for us, and we would give her\nthe money for the food. Well, after 10 months, my things have run out, and I told\nher, we don\u2019t have any money any more. So she was \u2014 she was very good about tt.\nWhen he didn\u2019t see, she would open the door and quickly push in a \u2014 a\u2014 a\u2014 some\nsoup, let\u2019s say, or some bread. We ate very little, but whatever it was. There was a\nAugust 15, 1998\nwindow in that room that was overlooking a field, and a young girl would come\nevery day with her cow to let the cow roam around. And I wouldn\u2019t stand at the\nwindow because I was afraid somebody might spot me. So I would kneel at the\nwindow and look at her. And I would say to Julian, what I wouldn\u2019t give to be this\ncow. I mean, people don\u2019t know what it means. 22 months. She worked for a\nGerman place. She spoke German. She didn\u2019t know how to read it, but she spoke\nGerman, for some reason she did. And once in awhile she would invite those\nGerman soldiers over for a party. So I help her cook and bake. And then we would\nhide in that pantry. And she would give them enough to \u2014 drinks to make them half\ndrunk, and they would lie down on her bed and sleep. And when they were asleep,\nwe would come in, go right near. I looked at them when they were asleep, and go to\nother room. When finally the war was almost over, there was a terrible fighting\nbetween the German and the Russian armies. Terrible fighting. The entire household\nwent down to the basement, except us. So we were sitting in the pantry, and Julian\nkept his hands over my ears so I wouldn\u2019t hear that shooting. When suddenly the\nshooting stopped, and I said to Julian, am I crazy, or did I hear a Russian words\nthere? At the moment when I said that, she opened the door and she said, you are\nfree. The Russians are here, you can go out. There was no joy in me. Absolutely\nnothing. So I said \u2014 my reaction was, now I am going to sleep. And I went to sleep\nAugust 15, 1998\nwithout fear, once. At least once without fear, and I slept 24 hours. Julian went out\nright away. I couldn\u2019t make myself go out for about a week. I was afraid to face the\nworld. So finally we went out, one Sunday afternoon. Beautiful, sunny afternoon.\nMy town, where I was born, where I went to school, I didn\u2019t know a living soul.\nAnd as we were walking, I said to Julian, where are we going? He says, I don\u2019t\nknow, let\u2019s just walk. And as we were walking a man approached us. And he saw\nme, and he stood there and said, I don\u2019t believe it. Aren\u2019t you Isadore Salzburg\u2019s\ndaughter? I said yes. Was a lawyer, Jewish lawyer. Said to us, where are you going?\nI said, I don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t have a place. He says, come with me, I just opened an\napartment, it belonged to a Nazi. So we went with him. There were no beds, but it\ndidn\u2019t matter. I slept on the desk, Julian slept on the floor. And this was our first\napartment. And from that day on, I was going out every day, looking for Jews that\ncame out from hiding. And our apartment was full of people in a very short time.\nYou were \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t believe, we would spend entire evenings telling s \u2014 each\nother stories. Of course, I didn\u2019t have a penny to mours \u2014 to our soul. So I \u2014 one day\nI saw a woman coming out of hiding, and I could recognize them coming out of\nhiding a mile away, there was something about the \u2014 the way they were walking,\nlike we did. And I \u2014I saw that woman coming out of hiding, and she was a wife of a\nlawyer, her husband died. And she came out of hiding, so I said, come with me. We\nAugust 15, 1998\nhad a \u2014 a-an apartment full of people. And she \u2014 the first thing she said to me, she\ntook out some money, pocket money \u2014 paper money from her pocket and said, do\nyou need any money\u201d It was so unimportant. Here, have some. And that was the first\nmoney we got. Then Julian joined the army, Polish army as a \u2014 as a physician.",
        "Q: Be-Before we go on to that, I wanted to ask you a few more questions.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: What was the name of the family of the woman that you \u2014 that hid you?",
        "A: Maria Dambrowska(ph). Her grandson is still alive in Przemysl and I sent him\nmoney. Yeah. And my son graduated medical school, he decided to go to Poland for\na visit. He understands Polish, he speaks a little Polish. He went to Przemysl, she\nwas still alive. Of course, I gave him money for her. And I was very curious what\nshe will say. When he came back I said, what did she say when she saw you? He\nsays, Mother, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. She put her arms around me and started to\ncry. You know, that after we moved out to that apartment that the man gave us, she\ncouldn\u2019t stand it. She moved out from her place and moved to the same house, to the\nsame floor, opposite our apartment. So she lived there with us again.",
        "Q: How did you know when you were in the ghetto that you could trust her when\nshe made the offer?\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Of course I didn't know, but did \u2014 did we have any choice? Was either that or\nbeing on the train. Sooner or later. I mean, is \u2014 it was inevitable that we will end on\nthe train.",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A: Because so many people went. I mean, we couldn\u2019t be an exception. Maybe not\nsooner, maybe a little later. I finally \u2014 you know I found out that my father was\ntaken.",
        "Q: Tell me about it.",
        "A: Oh, I \u2014 I didn't tell you that. As we were \u2014 as we were in hiding, one evening\nsomebody came to the kitchen. We didn\u2019t know who it was, we just heard the voice.\nAnd we were \u2014 from what he said we could understand that he was a Jewish man\nwho happened to know her, he knew her. And you would always try to find a way,\nsomebody who \u2014 who could help you. So he thought he would go out of the ghetto\nand go to her place, maybe she can take him. He didn\u2019t know she had us. I felt very\nguilty about that later. And as he was sitting in the kitchen and talking to her, she\nasked him what happened to Mr. Salzburg? And he says, oh, he was \u2014 he and his\nwife were taken on the train to Auschwitz. And when Julian heard that he put both\nhands on my ears so I wouldn\u2019t hear it, but I heard it. So later \u2014 my mother went to\nAuschwitz. After the war, I met a boy who was with my father on the train, who\nAugust 15, 1998\nsurvived Auschwitz, and he told me that on the way to Auschwitz the SS very often\nwas making some \u2014 they tried to find people who had money, and people usually\nhad some money with them. So my father, who was very \u2014 a person that \u2014 that\ncaught the eye, he asks him whether he has any money. He said no. He started sh \u2014\nlooking through his pockets and he found some money. So he told him to go straight\nahead and he shot him in the head. At least he was saved Auschwitz. Yeah. But she\ndid accomplish quite a lot I must say, this woman. Wasn\u2019t easy to have two people\nhidden in a small apartment.",
        "Q: Why do you think she did it?",
        "A: She didn\u2019t do it for money, because after the war, when Julian joined the army,\nand the first money I got, I went to her, and I gave it to \u2014 I wanted to give it to her,\nshe wouldn\u2019t take it. I think she really felt something for us. I don\u2019t know why, I\ndon\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know the reason, really, but she felt something. You know, to\naccomplish \u2014 to have 22 months with people where you can \u2014 and I told her, when\nshe first told me \u2014 suggested this to me, I said, do you know what will happen to you\nwhen you are caught? Oh, I am not afraid. She was the happy go lucky type.",
        "Q: How old a woman was she?",
        "A: She was older than I was. She was in her, maybe close to 40 at the time, maybe\n35.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "Q: And what was your relation to her husband?",
        "A: Actually, it wasn\u2019t her husband. You know, the funny thing is that we didn\u2019t\nknow it. She was carrying his name and we thought they were married. Then we\nfound out that she\u2019d left her husband and she \u2014 he was just living with her. And th \u2014\nthe dangerous thing was that when he \u2014 he used to drink quite a lot. And when he\ndrank he would threaten her with us. And that was dangerous. So we were very\nafraid sometimes about him. But she could control him somehow. And she was\nfunny. I used to read German papers and tell her what\u2019s going on in the world so\nwhen she would go to work \u2014 she worked for a German firm, she could tell them,\nand she was well informed. She was a character.",
        "Q: What kind of work did she do?",
        "A: Some \u2014 not very important. Something in the \u2014 in the office, maybe. But she\nspoke German, but she didn\u2019t know how to read it, and she didn\u2019t want to admit it.",
        "Q: Now, when you were there for those 22 months, you said your health was good,\nyou did not get sick, you or your husband?",
        "A: Not once. Not once. And when Doris Schulman(ph) was wondering about it, she\nsays, don\u2019t you get a \u2014 didn\u2019t you get a cold, didn\u2019t you have to sneeze? I said I\ncouldn't afford to sneeze. Because well, to the kitchen, her neighbors used to come\nto the kitchen and they couldn\u2019t hear us. They \u2014 they \u2014 actually the first rule of being\nAugust 15, 1998\nhidden by somebody in this situation was that absolutely nobody must know it,\nbecause was enough if one person would know, and the word spreads. About two\nweeks before we were liberated, I had a friend in school who came from a very\nOrthodox Jewish family and the 15 people of that family were hidden somewhere.\nAnd two weeks before the war ended somebody gave them out and they were all\nshot. So this was terribly important that nobody, absolutely nobody would know.\nOnce it happened that I was wearing \u2014 I was wearing a housecoat, and she said to\nme, come in, and I was standing, you know, at the door of the room, between the\nroom and the kitchen, talking to her, when her neighbor didn\u2019t knock at the door,\njust opened the door, came in and saw me. And my first impulse was to hide, you\nknow, but she didn\u2019t lose her nerve. She said \u2014 she immediately had a story. Tho \u2014\nthey were \u2014 those are Polish people and they were in black market, black marketing\nand the police stopped them and they came here to hide for a few hours. And as soon\nshe got her out of the apartment, that woman. And then she managed to get her back\n\u2014 she was very clever \u2014 and she said, look through the window, there they are, you\nsee? They left now. They felt more secure so they \u2014 they went away. Here they are\naround the corner. And she made it so that the woman never suspected. [break]",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Lena Jurand. This is tape number two, side B,\nAugust 15, 1998\nand we were just talking about the conditions when you were 1n hiding for 22\nmonths. While you were in hiding, were you aware of what was happening in the\nghetto? You sa \u2014 you had mentioned about the one man coming and you heard about",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 your father. Did you hear about other things that were going on?",
        "A: He sometimes went to the ghetto door \u2014 gate and got some news, als \u2014",
        "Q: Who 1\u2014 who 1s he?",
        "A: He 1s the \u2014 the \u2014 her supposed husband.",
        "Q: And his name?",
        "A: Stanislaw, I believe. And he once, twice or three times brought a letter from my\nmother. She came to the ghetto gate and probably handed him the letter. And one\ntime he brought me a \u2014 a ball of yarn, and I was very surprised to see it. I was\nthinking what \u2014 what is \u2014 why did my mother send me a ball of yarn? Then Julian\nstarted to rewind the yarn, there was a ring inside. But \u2014 well, I knew that the\nconditions are getting worse. They \u2014 they \u2014 he told me and he heard it in \u2014 and you\nhear it from other people talking, Polish people who are talking about the conditions.\nIt was expected. As the \u2014 as the war was going to the inevitable end, 1t was expected\nthat they won\u2019t \u2014 won\u2019t leave the Jews alone.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "Q: Why do you say that?",
        "A: Well, they almost \u2014 they almost \u2014 all of the Jewish population of the ghetto\nalmost went out to Auschwitz, unless you could hide, which was not very often.",
        "Q: What did you know about Auschwitz at th \u2014 at that time?",
        "A: We knew that they have \u2014 that they gas people. Oh, we knew that.",
        "Q: Where did you get that information from?",
        "A: Gossip. Letters probably. Maybe somebody escaped once in awhile. I \u2014 I doubt\nthat, but there were rumors. They were not really news, they were rumors. But you\nknew that they do something with the people. They had to do something with the\npeople. You know, when the Russians came in, and finally I \u2014 we went out and had\nthis empty apartment, I met a Russian high ranked officer on the street, who said to\n\u2014 the first thing he said to me is, where is your papa? Where is your daddy? He\nknew him from before. He said to me, he was a fine man. Strange, how this happens\nin life. I had \u2014 I had two black women come here one day with a bible. And they ask\nme \u2014 they wanted to convert me, and they ask me whether I believe in God, and I\nsaid no, I don\u2019t. How can I? But, on the other side, I am \u2014 I am here. This is my\nfourth life, you know. First life was in Przemysl as a girl, was very happy. Very\nhappy life, no problems. Then the second life was under the occupation, and hiding.\nAnd the third life was after the war. And since my husband died, it\u2019s my fourth life.\nAugust 15, 1998\nHe didn\u2019t have a right to leave me alone. Oh, there\u2019s something I wanted to tell you,\nvery important. When we went into hiding, we were planning it, I said to him, I\nwon\u2019t go u-unless you meet my conditions. You have to have poison with you\nbecause I will not go in German \u2014 to German\u2019s hands alive. He says, you can be sure\nPll have it. All right. We went into hiding and there was one night when the German\ncars were passing by [makes tooting noise]. And a neighbor came in and said,\nMarie, you don\u2019t have to be nervous, they\u2019re just going from house to house looking\nfor Jews. Would you believe that they went from one house to another, this is the\nonly house they didn\u2019t enter? There is something written in the stars. At that time\nwhen I heard those cars and she said they are going looking for Jews, I said to\nJulian, I want the poison now. He says no. When they will enter this house, Pll give\nit to you. They never entered. That\u2019s na \u2014 that\u2019s not the end of the story. After the\nwar, as Julian didn\u2019t have anything else but one pair of pant and a shirt, and he was\nalways a snappy dresser, he ask me to press his pants. I picked them up, and you\nknow the European pants are finished with the belt of the same material. And as I\npicked them up, there was something stiff there. So I said to him, Julian, I cannot\npress it like that, there is something in that belt, you have to take it out. What do you\nthink it was? Poison. And at that time I gave him such hell for telling me that he\ndoesn\u2019t have it. I said, you promise, you don\u2019t keep your promise. I was angry at\nAugust 15, 1998\nhim. He said, if I would have shown it to you, you would have taken it then. This\nway, you waited. And he took it out from his pants. That\u2019s a story, huh? He was a\nvery good man. When they t \u2014 when he died they gave him a beautiful memorial at\nSaint Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital. He was clinical director there. And they really were very\nnice. Nice people. Everybody liked him.",
        "Q: At the time of liberation you said you slept for 24 hours, it was the first time you\ncould sleep.",
        "A: Peacefully, without being afraid, because you know, it\u2019s a terrible thing when\nyou are afraid at night.",
        "Q: When you walked out, what was \u2014 what was it like to walk out of that apartment\nonto the street \u2014",
        "A: It was a [indecipherable]",
        "Q: \u2014 for the very first time?",
        "A: It was an incredible experience. Julian went out the first time, he had a cane and\nhe walked with a cane. When I went with him, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a strange experience when\nyou don\u2019t own anything. Nothing. I had a skirt and a blouse. He had a pair of pants\nand a shirt. And we walked. And we didn\u2019t go \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where we are\ngoing. We didn\u2019t know what \u2014 where we are going to sleep at night. We didn\u2019t own\nAugust 15, 1998\nanything. In a way it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s exhilarating, you don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\nYou don\u2019t own anything.",
        "Q: You hadn\u2019t really had any physical activity in those 22 months \u2014",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: \u2014 you were confined to the apartment.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: So what kind \u2014 again, what kind of physical con-condition were you in?",
        "A: Amazingly well. Amazingly well. When my friends ask me now how come I \u2014 I\nkeep so well, I say I ha \u2014I had a good training.",
        "Q: Did you have any health \u2014 physical repercussions from the abortion in 1940?",
        "A: No, healthy as a horse. Nothing. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 while you were in hiding, did you still get your period?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you handle that?",
        "A: The way you handle it in Europe all the way, a piece of paper.",
        "Q: And you burned that 1n the stove?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Amazing, amazing. You know then, when Julian started with the \u2014\nwith the army, he made friends with \u2014 with the cook and he used to bring home\npieces of meat like that, and all day long I cooked, because I had so many people.\nAugust 15, 1998\nThen one day, somebody knocked at my door \u2014 I wonder whether she 1s still alive?\nAnd I opened the door, and I couldn\u2019t figure it out, whether it was a wom \u2014 a \u2014a girl\nor a man. The creature was very tall, very skinny. Shaven head, and she spoke\nGerman to me. She was Hungarian. She said she was with a group of women from\nMajdanek, Hungarian women, trying to go back to Budapest. They stopped in\nPrzemysl. Each one of them went to a different house, knocking at the door, trying\nto get some food or something, some money. So I said to her, come in, come in. And\nshe came in and I gave her dinner. And she says she was a daughter of a restaurateur\nin Budapest, she doesn\u2019t know whether her parents are alive. She survived\nMajdanek with a group of other girls, each one were \u2014 and I told her to bring others\nhere, I would have all fed them. And I tried to get together some money for her for\nthe train trip to \u2014 to Hungary. I don\u2019t know whether she survived that, but I was so\n\u2014I was so touched by her looks. I mean, she wore a \u2014 a \u2014 kind of a uniform coat, and\nshe was so skinny. Oh, the people that we had, it was very interesting after the war\nwhen I found those people coming out of hiding, and we all stayed together. Didn\u2019t\nmatter where we slept. Then I found out that two my cousins survived the war near\nWarsaw as Polish women. And the first occasion I had, I send them money and\nasked them to come to me, and they came.",
        "Q: How did you find out about them?\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember who told me. Somebody told me. I think it was the brother of\none of the girls, who is still alive in Florida.",
        "Q: How did you find out about your mother?",
        "A: That man who came looking for \u2014 for a place to stay, he said that they took Mr.\nSalzburg and Mrs. Salzburg. So that\u2019s how I found my mother, otherwise I didn\u2019t\nknow. But it was very interesting to see all those people and we would sit at the\nevening and each one could write a book. And it\u2019s amazing what people can go th \u2014\ngo through and survive and still have \u2014 so those cousins of mine came to me, and the\nfirst thing Julian took them to the army \u2014 to the \u2014 to the shoemaker to have them\nmake some shoes for them. One of those cousins is still alive and she lives in\nMilburn, New Jersey. The other one passed away. So that was an experience.",
        "Q: So now it\u2019s after liberation and \u2014 and can you tell me what you did then?",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we \u2014 we tried to get some beds for the apartment, and the first thing\nmy husband bought \u2014 got for me, and I don\u2019t know where he got it, was a concert\ngrand piano. And we put it in a room that was totally empty. The concert grand was\nin the center of the room, so all three of us, all the two girls that came to stay with\nus, all three of us played the piano, so we gave concerts.",
        "Q: You decided to stay in the town?\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Well we stayed only temporary. Then my husband was shipped as a army\nphysician to another town called Zheshev(ph), not far from Przemysl.",
        "Q: So he went into the Polish army\u201d?",
        "A: Oh, he went into the Polish army as a captain.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because this way he got food and everything, it was easy. And they looked for\ndoctors there, so he went as a\u2014 as a\u2014 a captain [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Was he \u2014 was he a specific kind of doctor?",
        "A: Yes, he was. It wasn\u2019t for the army. He was \u2014 his specialty was venereal diseases.\nI used to call him the king of the horrors. And we \u2014 he went to Zheshev(ph) as a \u2014\nas a army physician, but he didn't want me to go there because it was a\u2014 sucha\nsmall town. So I and this cousin of mine, who lives in Milburn, New Jersey, we\nmoved [phone ringing] \u2014 we moved to Krakow. We stayed in Krakow only a few\nmonths. In the meantime my uncle, who was in New York, found out that I am\nalive. I wrote to him, and he had some friends, one of whom was a director of a DP\ncamp in Munich, Germany. The other was a director of a DP camp outside of\nMunich, Germany. And those t \u2014 those two sent a Jeep with two young men\ndressed in UNRRA uniforms, who came from Munich, Germany to get us out of\nPoland. And they came in and they said, you have two hours to decide. We cannot\nAugust 15, 1998\nstay here, we are illegally here. Either you come with us, or you have to stay. It\nhappened that my husband was at that time with us in Krakow \u2014 with me in\nKrakow. And I said, let\u2019s go.

And the soldiers found that little puppy dog, they put him in a suitcase or\nwhatever and brought him to me. And I was so geared tomas food \u2014 towards food,\nthat when I heard something moving in that \u2014 in that little suitcase, I was sure it\u2019s a\nchicken. That was the dog. He was a puppy, and he became our baby. So I have a\npicture where I\u2019m standing on the top of a house in Cieszyn, where the border\nbetween Poland ch \u2014 Czechoslovakia was. And Julian \u2014 w-we stayed with a\nOrthodox family, it was a Friday evening when we arrived there. We stayed\novernight, they were very nice to us. And the next morning the daughter of the\nhousehold went to talk to the soldier, because we didn\u2019t have any papers. She talked\nto him and she probably convinced him, so he let her open the \u2014 the \u2014 the border, the\nthing, the \u2014 and we went through.",

My father kept it up. And my \u2014 I had two \u2014 two of my father\u2019s brothers and\nmy mother\u2019s sister living in New York. So I \u2014 I had no regrets of leaving. There was\nnothing in me at the time. And my only preoccupation was to cross those borders,\nbecause we were illegally.",

Well, we crossed the border, we went on that trip with the\ndog to Praga. We stayed in Praga one or two nights, I don\u2019t remember exactly. We\ndidn\u2019t have a penny to our soul, we couldn\u2019t buy anything. They provided food for\nus, the two boys who came to get us. When we \u2014 the same way we crossed the\nCzechoslovakian-German border, when we finally came to Munich, we were lucky\nbecause \u2014 because of my uncle\u2019s friends, we didn\u2019t have to stay ina DP camp, we\nstayed with the UNRRA people, which was lovely. Beautiful house with a cook,\nwith everything. It was my first contact with Americans. I used to go in a Jeep when\nshe was touring the neighborhood, with her. Was very nice. And when \u2014 as we were\nstaying there, I took a job to teach some children music in that DP camp in Munich.\nAugust 15, 1998\nAnd Julian works \u2014 works as physician there. And it was very rewarding because I\ncould give something to those children, I like that very much. Except they didn\u2019t\nspeak my language, so I had to start with the Yiddish.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to put your foot down in Germany? Did it mean\nanything to you?",
        "A: It meant a lot. I hated every minute of it. I \u2014 I \u2014 Julian insisted I should get a\ngood piano teacher to continue my piano education. Well, I got a teacher from the\nconservatory in Munich who would come home to me, but I hated him, because\nevery time I would say something about the war, he would say, we didn\u2019t know\nanything. And I said you mean to tell me you didn\u2019t know? All those golden teeth,\nyou didn\u2019t know where they came from? All the jewelry? The work of art? I said to\nhim, you know, if I would find one German who would say yes, I knew what was\ngoing on, but we couldn\u2019t do anything about it, I would have some respect for him. I\nhated \u2014 it came to a point \u2014 I found out through my cousin, the one who called here,\nthat in a neighborhood hospital for \u2014 from where we lived, was a family, a mother\nand daughter and son-in-law, all three very sick people, Jews, of course. So I said to\nher, let\u2019s go. We went to the hospital and I brought something with me and I\nintroduced myself. And we became very, very friendly, but the son-in-law had\nleukemia. They were \u2014 they were hidden in terrible conditions and he died there in\nAugust 15, 1998\nthe hospital. And I would go every other day, I would take the train from Munich to\nGarmisch-Partenkirchen where the sanitorium was. And I would take my dog\nalong, and I buy a ticket for my dog and he had a seat. You know what means to be\nangry\u2019? I was \u2014 I had so much anger in me towards this ger \u2014 German people. I\ncouldn\u2019t help myself. I would take a chocolate with me on the train, and when would\nI do it otherwise? I saw those children, German children sitting across from me,\nlooking at me, and they were looking at the chocolate bars that I had. And I would\nunpack a chocolate bar and put the whole chocolate bar into my dog\u2019s mouth. I had\nsome satisfaction. Cruel, but satisfaction. After awhile, I said to my husband, I don\u2019t\ncare why I live, I can\u2019t stay in Germany. It\u2019s killing me. Absolutely killing me. So\nhe found out that there was a train of Italians who were brought to Germany by\nHitler to work in Germany and they were going back to Italy. So he volunteered as\na physician, I went as a nurse, and the dog we \u2014 went as a dog. So we were t \u2014 to\nItaly by train. And Julian had a very dear friend of his and his brother\u2019s. She was\nDutch and she lived in Merano \u2014 Merano. When we crossed the Italian border, this\nis where we went. And \u2014",

        "A: Neue Freiman(ph) lager.",
        "Q: And so you went into the camp itself?",
        "A: Oh yes, every day. I didn\u2019t live there, but I went to the camp.",
        "Q: Can you paint me a picture of what the camp looked like?",
        "A: Well, there were little wooden houses. Now, Lucia, the one who called me now,\nshe lived there, in camp. Not bad. They had enough food. I have somewhere a\npicture wa \u2014 at the train station there. And I went every day because I taught the kids\nand Julian went because he had some patients there. It wasn\u2019t bad.

        "Q: Did they \u2014 did they talk about their experience? The children?",
        "A: No. Not to me. I taught piano. They were nice. So we left finally Germany, to\nmy joy and we went to Italy. And it \u2014 Italy, we didn't have money again, we tried to\nfind a place to stay, so we found a room on the eighth floor without an elevator, and\nI had the dog who had to go out three times a day. It didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t matter.\nJulian graduated medical school in Genoa. This was his second language, Italy.\nAnd he adored Italy. So, because he had an Italian diploma, he could practice\nmedicine there. So we f \u2014 we found a room in the old part of Genoa in the port of\nGenoa where he opened his office, so to speak. That\u2019s why I called him the king of\nthe horrors, he \u2014 we would go for a walk and from up every lantern came a greeting.\nAugust 15, 1998\nAnd I volunteered as his helper because we couldn\u2019t afford sa \u2014 to pay somebody.\nSo I would help him, but he wasn\u2019t pleased with me. You know, hi-his specialty was\nskin and venereal diseases. This goes together in Italy. So he asked me to volunte \u2014\nto stay by when he had a patient who had something that had to be burned on her\nskin. And I don\u2019t know whether you know what burning of skin smells like. I was\nstanding next to him and I was getting paler and paler. And he gave one look at me\nand he said, get out. I am firing you, you are not a good helper. So we stayed in\nItaly for five years. I learned Italian. In the meantime, my uncle couldn't stand it, the\none in New York. In 1947 he send me a ticket to come to New York for a visit. And\nI came on a Polish boat, because I couldn\u2019t speak English. I had a ball on that boat,\nit was lovely. I came here with a visa for three months, visitor\u2019s visa. I stayed with\nhim in Long Island where he had his house and I must say his wife was beautiful to\nme, she was such a lovely woman. I have never met her before.

And then I had an uncle, my mother\u2019s \u2014 my\n\u2014my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s husband, who was a photographer in Yonkers. So I went\nthere and he went absolutely bananas with me. He \u2014 where is that other picture that\nis so beautiful I have to show you? He was taking me \u2014 my pictures constantly. And\nI would travel all over New York, and then my uncle got tired of living in Long\nIsland because he had to commute downtown, it was a little hard on him. He found\nan apartment on 96\" West, and I had a room overlooking Central Park, which was\nabsolutely beautiful. I stayed the three months, after three months my visa was about\nto expire.

So I said, excuse me, let me talk.\nAnd I said to the man, look, I am a survivor of the Holocaust. I finally came here\nand I have the time of my life, and I am totally in love with New York. I would like\nto stay another three months. I have a husband in Italy and I intend to go back.\nWithout another word, I got three more months in New York. Then I sent a\ntelegram to Julian, ar-arriving Ciampino Rome, TWA, this and this time. He gets\nthe [indecipherable] and he said he knows what is Ciampino Rome, but what the\ndevil is TWA? He couldn\u2019t figure it out. He came to Rome to wait for me and I\ncome out from the plane, I\u2019m very proud of myself, I had the new hat, with the\nfeather. And at that time they started to wear those shoes with the strap at the ankle,\nand I had those shoes. I was very proud of myself. I had the new suit. My other\nuncle, my \u2014 my father\u2019s older brother was in fur business on 28\" Street and he gave\nme a beautiful brown Persian coat, full length coat, beautiful.

Those were very\nhappy months for me, I really loved it. I wa \u2014 it was a love affair wi \u2014 between me\nand New York, a total love affair. I love New York. Very happy.

I\nmean, this can happen. Very seriously he said, then I won\u2019t go. He went to the\nAmerican embassy in Genoa. He got every shot given to the dog by the veterinarian\nthere, we got a pile of papers, we paid $50 for his \u2014 we \u2014 we came by boat here.

And we found there is, near Neptune, New Jersey is a small\nplace where they don\u2019t let cars on Sunday. And we found an Italian woman who\nrented the place to us, a\u2014 a room to us with the dog, and she didn't know we were\nJewish.

        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because when I came out of hiding, I swore that I will never have a cha \u2014 a child,\nbecause I saw what children went through. I was totally discouraged to have any\nfamily. And then my brother-in-law, Julian\u2019s brother, who never had children,\nstarted writing letters to me begging me, if I can, to have a child. So I decided\nAugust 15, 1998\nmaybe I\u2019ll try it. Never regretted it, he was a wonderful boy. It was a good\nexperience. But, we stayed there and then Julian found a job in Grantsville, which\nis between Annapolis and Baltimore. A state hospital.

        "A: Iam sure I would have been different. First of all, maybe I would have been\nmore religious, which I am not. Second, I think it gave me a certain insight into\nhuman s-suffering, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have known it. I led a very sheltered life as\na young girl, very sheltered. Good life. And I didn\u2019t know much about human\nsuffering. I learned a lot. So I \u2014I think \u2014 I think in this respect \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say that\nthe war was beneficial for me, it isn\u2019t beneficial to anybody.

I\u2014I am\nspecially very vulnerable if it comes to children suffering. And when I see, let\u2019s say\nin \u2014 in Yugoslavia, the children who are without food, without medication, I suffer.\nI do. Because I thought maybe \u2014 maybe we have filled out the \u2014 the suffering of\npeople. Maybe it\u2019s enough. But it isn\u2019t enough. It goes on and on and on. Why?\nEven \u2014 even this last [indecipherable] the bombs, that so many Americans have\ndied, and local people. Any crazy person can \u2014 you know, my father was a socialist\nand I used to discuss politics with him, and I \u2014 I was very angry at him because he\nsaid he doesn\u2019t believe in forming the state of Israel. And I said, why? He says,\nbecause the Arabs will never, never leave them alone. Very often when I hear the\nnews, I can see that he was right in many ways. But, look, we will always have wars.\nThere will be always crazy people who will try to do so much damage. We cannot\nhelp it. We are not responsible for everybody. I wish Julian would have lived\nlonger. I still feel that he didn't have any right to leave me alone. He never left me\nalone in 57 years. If it wouldn\u2019t have been for him, I wouldn\u2019t have survived the\nwar. I am sure of it. I didn't \u2014 I was very sheltered all my life.

        "A: To some extent yes, but don\u2019t forget that he grew up, his first years were in the\ncountry, which was very nice. We had the nice community there, rather\ninternational. We had a doctor from Vienna, and we had a doctor from\nCzechoslovakia. We had a nice group of people.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through these very difficult times and others did\nnot, sitting in this country, let\u2019s say.",

        "Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial in Israel\u2019?",
        "A: I would have killed him. I was very happy that the Israelis got him. Serves him\nright. Too bad he didn't get more. And I looked at him as he was standing at that trial\nand I was thinking, you know, he looked like a little Jewish man. Didn\u2019t he? It\u2019s\nfunny how it happens. But I was very glad they got him. Very. No pity.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Germany today? The modern Germans.",
        "A: I know. I wouldn\u2019t live there if you give me millions. I don\u2019t buy anything that\u2019s\nmade in Germany. I used to tell my son, when you will be older, and you want to\nmarry somebody, you can marry anybody of any religion you want. But if you ever\nmarry a German, I will not know you. I resent them very greatly. Greatly. As a\nmatter of fact I had a friend who was a wife of a rabbi. She was a very dear friend of\nmine, she worked with my husband in the hospital here. And her daughter, the\nAugust 15, 1998\ndaughter of a rabbi went to Germany to study something and she met a German and\nshe married him. And she lives in Germany. And every time I saw her, I was\nthinking, how can she? How can she have any relationship with those people? I\ncannot. I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t do it. As a matter of fact, about 12 years ago\n[indecipherable] we went to Vienna and Budapest. Julian had some meeting in\nBudapest. When we were going to Vienna, he said to me, you will love Vienna.\nOh, you will absol \u2014 well, I hated it. Every time I was in Vienna and I had to listen\nto that German and I was thinking, this is the country that gave us Hitler, I couldn\u2019t\nstand it. I enjoyed Budapest very much, but not Vienna. A funny thing happened to\nus, we went to Jerusalem. There was a \u2014 Julian was supposed to read the paper,\nthere was a psychiatric meeting in Jerusalem, and he was reading a paper on \u2014 on\nthe war, something about the war. And we were sta \u2014 we were \u2014 we were staying at\nthe Hilton in Jerusalem and we met another couple. Very handsome man, who had\non a golden chain, a big letter chai. So you thought he was Jewish, yeah. He was a\nPresbyterians minister. And I still have a letter that his wife wrote to me. We\nbecame very friendly with this couple and we had one taxi, and the taxi driver drove\nus around. And I said to [indecipherable] how come you speak English so well? He\nsays to me, I am from Brooklyn. And we were \u2014 we s \u2014 we went to a kibbutz where\nwe spend the night. Was a nice kibbutz, well kept. And we went to Mosada(ph), of\nAugust 15, 1998\ncourse. And then we \u2014 we traveled to the ocean. Oh, we had a great time in\nJerusalem, I loved it. She came running to me, his wife, on a Friday and said, Lena,\nquickly, quickly, you have to get ready. I want to see the Jews dancing at the wailing\nwall.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Israel?",
        "A: About what?",
        "Q: Israel.",
        "A: I liked it very much, but \u2014 but I am not very optimistic about it \u2014 Israel. You\nknow, if they keep giving away \u2014 Israel is small, if they keep wanting more and\nmore from Israel, how long will they stay? I am \u2014 I am a little hesitant about\nNetanyahu, | don\u2019t know whether he is doing such a good job. But I love the\natmosphere. I felt very comfortable there. That \u2014",
        "Q: Why did you feel comfortable?",
        "A: Because it\u2019s such a relaxed atmosphere the Israelis have. With everything that\u2019s\ngoing around them, it\u2019s amazing that they can forget about it. Or maybe not forget,\nbut try to forget. It\u2019s beautiful.",
        "Q: Are you more comfortable around people who went through the war, than those\nwho did not?",
        "A: No-\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "Q: More comfortable around other survivors?",
        "A: You know, this is a very strange question that you ask me, and I\u2019Il tell you why.\nThere is a couple here, they\u2019re not Jewish, very nice couple who \u2014 whom I met at\nsome friend\u2019s house. And they probably thought \u2014 they knew somebody else who\nwas from Poland, also a survivor. So they thought that if they put me together with\nanother survivor, I will feel mu-much more relaxed and so on. And they invited me\nto dinner one time. And I went to dinner and there was the other woman. And I\ndidn't like her and she didn't like me, and I know it. So you never know. I \u2014 I get\nbeautifully along with Americans, I love Americans. I think \u2014 I don\u2019t have to have\npeople who \u2014 who went through everything, as I did. Course, we enjoy it. As I was\ntelling you that I went to see that family in the hospital with their gra \u2014 son-in-law.\nWell, the woman, the young woman was a public prosecutor in Poland. She was a\nlawyer by profession and she wanted to come to this country desperately. So, we\nwent together for the \u2014 you know, befo \u2014 it took five years for the amer \u2014 for the\nAmericans immigration office to give us a visa to come here. That\u2019s why I get so\nupset when I see that they let so many people in without \u2014 without really knowing\nanything about them. They x-rayed us, we went to Naples, we had to go through\nsome questions and well, the x-rayed showed \u2014 her x-rayed showed that she had a\ntiny spot on her lungs. Every doctor, including Julian gave her a statement that\nAugust 15, 1998\nthere\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with her lungs, they wouldn\u2019t let her in here. So\nshe went to Israel. And she became a lawyer there in Haifa. We visited her when\nwe were there. And a\u2014 but why do I say that? In connection with what? I don\u2019t\nknow. She passed away since then.",
        "Q: Di\u2014 did your \u2014",
        "A: She used to write to me.",
        "Q: Did your husband do any studies, any research on survivors? You had said that\nhe gave a paper on it \u2014 on them.",
        "A: Oh \u2014 oh yes, he wrote the paper, yes.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did he do research on survivors?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: What kind of research?",
        "A: He met with all kinds of people. I wasn't involved in that, he didn't involve me in\nthat. But he did meet with the people who survived the sp \u2014 from the psychiatric\npoint of view, what \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 where they had left anything. Well, of course,\neverybody who survived that war has to be affected in some way or other. I mean,\nyou cannot be a normal person after surviving this. Like being hidden for 22 months\nwithout being able to say a word loud, or \u2014 or sneeze or cough. How can you be\nnormal? I mean normal, depending what you mean by normal. But that\u2019s very hard.\nAugust 15, 1998\nVery hard. I find that my \u2014 my attitude to people is completely different. I mistrust\npeople much more than I did when I was young. I didn't know anything about life.\nWell, here I am, at the end of my rope.",
        "Q: As you\u2019ve gotten older, do you think more about this time in your life, the war\ntime?",
        "A: Do I think more? Yes.",
        "Q: A-As you\u2019ve gotten older.",
        "A: Yes, yes, absolutely. Much more. I analyze much more. I would love to go once\nmore to my town.",
        "Q: Had you ever been back?",
        "A: Never. Never. When I left Poland I swore I'll never come back.",
        "Q: Why do you say now you would like to go back?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Why do you say now that you would like to go back?",
        "A: Cause I\u2019m getting older. I think a \u2014 1t would be nice to see the old place. It was\nsuch a nice town. We didn't have any crime. Nothing ever happened. Only once a\nwoman, a Jewish woman divorced her husband and married somebody else. It was\nthe greatest scandal the town has ever heard of. It was a very peaceful life. Nice life,\nnice life.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "Q: Do you feel Polish in any way?",
        "A: Absolutely. I read Polish books. I like the Pope because he is Polish. Julian left\nquite a few Polish books, I didn\u2019t realize when I was looking through the books. So I\nstarted reading them. I didn't read them since I was 18 years old. Quite an\nexperience. At the beginning I thought [ll have a hard time, but 1t wasn\u2019t working\nthat way. It\u2019s nice.",
        "Q: What language do you think 1n every day?",
        "A: What language do I think? Mostly English, mostly English. When I am with my\nPolish friends we speak Polish, but \u2014",
        "Q: These are Polish-Jewish friends, or \u2014",
        "A: Not Jewish. Non-Jewish.",
        "Q: You have Polish friends here?",
        "A: Yes, yes. As a matter of fact, I have some books which I want to give them. But I\nsp \u2014 I think mostly in English, yes. Became a habit.",
        "Q: So, do you harbor any feelings, negative feelings towards the Polish people\nduring the war?",
        "A: I personally don\u2019t. I have no reason, I have been saved by a Polish woman. I\ndon\u2019t think we would have survived the war without her. Whether she did it \u2014 she\nAugust 15, 1998\ndidn\u2019t do it for money. Why she did it, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m grateful to her. So\nthat\u2019s why I take care of her grandson.",
        "Q: Do you receive any reparation money? Money for reparations?",
        "A: No. No. I know people get it from Switzerland. First of all, I don\u2019t know\nwhether my parents had any account. No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t need that money. I \u2014 I have\ntwo granddaughters and I hope they will never know what it means to go through a\nwar. It\u2019s devastating. I often think about it. But I had a good husband and he was \u2014\nhe pulled me through it. I would have never survived without him. First of all, I\nwould have gone with my father, and second, I didn't know how to do it. He was \u2014\nhe was the one who arranged everything for me, yeah. Strange. I never thought\nwhen I was young that I will go through such a war. What makes one crazy man do\nthings? And they were \u2014 there were some very bright, intelligent people in his group\nwho followed him. That is the tragic thing. When I read the story of \u2014 what was the\nname of his \u2014 his main \u2014 like here it, 1t was the \u2014 the forces, the \u2014 his for \u2014 he \u2014\nRommel. He was a bright, intelligent man, but he was caught. He was caught. There\nwere more men like that. This is \u2014 this is tho \u2014 though it\u2019s not an explanation why\npeople followed him. So you work for the memorial hospital \u2014 for the Holocaust\nMuseum? Pardon me.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "Q: Y-Yes, this is an interview for the museum. You said you had spoken to your\ngranddaughter\u2019s class \u2014 classes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell me why you\u2019re doing that and what your thoughts are?",
        "A: Well, my son asked me would we sp \u2014 would \u2014 at that time Julian was with me.\nAnd we spoke to her class, which was the \u2014 this \u2014 you know, she is now 13, but\nmust have been \u2014 maybe she was eight, something like that. And then they ask us in\nthat school would we speak to the older kids, and we did. And I was amazed, really\namazed at the attention they gave us. And the questions they ask us, they were very\nbright questions. Especially about the \u2014 the part where we described in what\nconditions we were hidden. Very bright.",
        "Q: Why did you do this?",
        "A: Well, he wanted us to talk to them. The principal was curious and he wanted us\nto talk to them, and I \u2014 I thought it was \u2014 be very interesting for kids to know what\npeople go through, and they still live a normal life. And he even ask me this year too\nto talk to, but I didn\u2019t, because I didn\u2019t feel up to it, but maybe I \u2014 I'll do it, if he\nasks me again.",
        "Q: You said you wanted to let the children know that you can go this \u2014 through this\nand live a normal life. You feel your life was normal after the war?\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Since we came to this country, I feel that we have led a very\nnormal life, yes. I am happy.",
        "Q: Do \u2014 do you feel totally assimilated into American culture?",
        "A: Yes and no. I am quite critical about the president, you know. And \u2014 but yes, I\nam, I am. I like this country. I\u2019m very happy here, and I often think of my father, he\nloved this country. The lower east side of New York. He loved it. My mother had\nanother sister who was a very active with a Jewish newspaper here in New York, is\nit Forward\u2019?",
        "Q: \u201cThe Forward.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah. Yes. But she passed away. She lived there, downtown New York. I used to\nvisit her quite often. So that\u2019s my life history.",
        "Q: Is there anything else we \u2014 you would like to say that we haven\u2019t covered?",
        "A: What else to say to you? You know, my son, when he was 20 years old and was\nin medical school, he fell in love with a very lovely Jewish girl. And I \u2014 I thought\nthey were a little bit too young to marry, but he insisted \u2014 they were both 20 \u2014 he\ninsisted they get married. They got married, they had a little apartment near GW\nwhere he was going to medical school. And I thought everything was beautiful until\nabout maybe six or seven months after they got married, he ask us to come over and\nwe did. And she was sitting next to the window, and I says, what is it sweetheart?\nAugust 15, 1998\nMaybe we come here maybe too often, I thought, maybe it\u2019s too much for her. She\nsays no, you know, I love you, but I just don\u2019t want to be married any more. And it\nwas a terrific blow to him, really bad. She was the one who got the divorce and as\nfar as I know, to this day she didn\u2019t remarry. So then he met this girl, and she\u2019s not\nJewish. And he married her, and seem like a good marriage. She works for the\nWorld Bank. She\u2019s a good mother. I would have preferred marry a Jewish girl, but\nwho am I to say something? And he seems to be working out very nicely. He took\nover the psychiatric division of the hospital in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and he\ndirected now a play in the theater, he goes in his father\u2019s footsteps. And he wants me\nto move there. So I don\u2019t know what life will bring, whatever it is. And I think it\u2019s\nvery nice of you to sit here and listen to me for such a long time. You must be\nexhausted.",

So we went every year, and he would\nalways rent two rooms. I never slept in the same room where my father was. I was\nAugust 15, 1998\nnot allowed to enter the room where my father slept, he was so afraid that I might\ncatch the TB from him, although he was under doctors\u2019 care. A \u2014 but nevertheless,\nhe always rented two rooms with an adjoining ba-balcony, and I \u2014 one was for me,\nand one was for him. And we would fight constantly, he and I, constantly. Every\nyear at the end of the season when we were in those mountains, I would say, I will\nnever go with you again. He says, if you pay me I wouldn\u2019t go with you. Until the\nnext year. And the next year, May came, I saw his eyes looking at me and he says,\nare you Starting to pack? And we went. We left Mother in the store, she was\nprobably very glad to get rid of us. And \u2014",

        "A: Oh, the resort. That\u2019s hard, Szezawnica, s-z-c \u2014 c-z-a-w-n-i-c-a, Szezawnica. It\nwas a place that was \u2014 there was no train station there, there was no bus. So we went\nto the nearest town and we hired a taxi and we would go there. And the reason I am\ntelling you this is because I was about 14 years old, I always travel with my music, I\nplayed piano. And my father had very few requirements of me, but one of those was\nthat he rented always for me, a piano, where I could go and play an hour a day,\npractice my piano. We arrived to the station, and those Jews living there knew him,\nAugust 15, 1998\nbecause he was there year after year after year. So they were waiting for him to\narrive. And as soon as we arrived, they would tell him something, something very\nimportant, and he would turn to me and say, do you have your music with you? I\nsaid, yes, of course I have my music, I always have it. He says, well, there is a\u2014a\nfamily, a mother and father, Jewish family and two children and they are very poor\nand they don\u2019t have enough food. So I, being a spoiled little thing, I said to him,\nFather, I don\u2019t understand, if they are so poor, why do they go to a summer resort?\nWhich was a logical question. But he was enraged. He says, you mean to tell me that\nthe \u2014 only the wealthy can have good air and good waters? We have to do something\nabout it, he decided. He says to me, do you have that pink chiffon dress that the\ndressmaker just finished for you? I said yes, I have it. He looked at my hair and he\nsaid, we\u2019 ll take you to the hairdresser and have some very nice curls made. And I\nsaid, what do you have in mind? You\u2019re going to play the piano, we\u2019ll give a concert\nand we\u2019ll collect money. I said no, I\u2019m not going, I am not prepared to give any\nconcert. I was 14 years old. He says, we will find a boy who\u2019ll play the fiddle. And\nif they see a girl and a boy playing, who cares whether you playing well or not?\nWe'll collect the money. And here\u2019s exactly what he did. He hired a place, he found\na boy, I played with my music because I didn\u2019t memorize anything, and he, he didn't\nAugust 15, 1998\ncare, he collected the money for the people. That was my father, always caring about\npeople, a lot.",

        "A: Polish. And I offered him that I would teach him Polish. He didn't want to. But I\nfound later that the knowledge of Yiddish was very helpful to me. I didn\u2019t know I\nknew it. When I came to Munich, Germany, and I taught piano in a DP camp, I had\nchildren from all over Europe, but they didn\u2019t speak German and they didn\u2019t speak\nPolish. So I didn't know how to reach them. I started with my broken Yiddish, and\nthat\u2019s the way I reached them. That\u2019s the mail.",

When \u2014 there was one taxi standing at the station and if\nsomebody took that taxi, the whole town knew it. At the same \u2014 at this \u2014 at the house\nwhere we lived, downstairs were three \u2014 two young ladies. They were not so young,\nthey were older. Unmarried, who had a \u2014 a store with sweets; candies and things like\nthat. And that was my mother\u2019s favorite store, she \u2014 there was a chair for her there\nand she would always sit in the evening and chat with them. I never had to pay for\nanything. I didn't need any money. As soon as I say who I am, it went on paper and\nmy mother later paid for 1t somehow, I don\u2019t know.\nAugust 15, 1998",

They spoke to me in Ukrainian, I answered in Polish, and\nwe understood each other.",

As I said, we \u2014 I had \u2014 I\nhad two \u2014 three teachers who were Jewish.

When sh \u2014 I knew when the\nJewish holiday is coming because Mother took out her earrings, yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: I was totally immersed in my studies. Totally. I\u2014 well, of course my father was\nvery strict as far as boys are concerned. I mean, there was no dating, absolutely\nnothing But I \u2014 I was a very good scholar in school, and I also had to spend a lot of\ntime pratic \u2014 practicing my piano.

I wasn\u2019t\nparticularly \u2014 but, in Przemysl, the city is divided by a river. A river with very, very\nclean water. And in the summer we had kind of a arrangement. They built a wooden\n\u2014 wooden cabanas at the edge of the river. And it was done very smartly, that you\ndidn\u2019t feel that you have a proper figure and you wanted to have a b \u2014 wear a\nbathing suit. You could go to the wood cabana, there were steps there going down\ninto the water. You could emerge in the water without being seen by anybody. And\nthis is how we spend our summers, beautifully. Beautiful river. It was a good life, it\nwas a very peaceful life, until the war.",
        "A: My mother used to whack me, until I was 16 years old. And she used a coppered\nbeater as her favorite object, and I got my beating only for the piano lessons. You\nsee, I had a notebook. For each piano lesson she would write in the date, what was\nmy next assignment and at the bottom was a mark from each lesson. If I had a A ora\nB, it was all right. If I had a C, I was licked. And yet, she was my best friend. When\nI grew up, she was my best friend. When I got married, it was already 1940. Times\nwere starting to be very bad, I discovered that I\u2019m pregnant, and I went to my\nAugust 15, 1998\nmother and I said, Mother, I am pregnant. She didn\u2019t \u2014 she didn\u2019t bat an eyelid. She\nsaid, then we have to get an abortion. She went with me. She got the doctor. In\nPoland, to get an abortion 1s like to spit. As long you have enough money, no\nproblem. She got the women doctor and another doctor who was present. She took\nme there. I got an abortion. She says, you cannot have a baby now. And if I had that\nbaby, I wouldn\u2019t have survived, that\u2019s for sure. And after that she said to me, you\ncan rest for 10 minutes, then we walk back home. And we walked home, and on the\nway there she must have seen that I was tired. She said \u2014 we passed an ice cream\nparlor and she says, would you like some ice cream? So we sat down. She was a\nvery smart woman. She treated me to the ice cream, then she took me home.\nWalking, mind you. And then, when we came home, she said, Father must not know\nabout it. You go now, undress and go to bed and lie down. But at dinnertime I want\nyou dressed, sitting at the table, eating dinner with your father. And this 1s exactly\nwhat I did. He never knew that. He was much more sentimental that she was. She\nwas a very great realist. She knew what is going on. Very smart woman.",

Even\nin \u201938 I wasn\u2019t concerned about it. In \u201939, when he finally attacked Poland, this is\nwhen I realized that very hard times are coming.",
        "A: Was very peaceful, very peaceful. I met my husband when I was 14 years old. I\nhad a cousin who lived in Lvov. She was a perpetual matchmaker. And she probably\nfigured out, here is that boy who \u2014 he was a \u2014 kind of tutoring children on the upper\nfloor where she lived, and she thought he was a very nice boy, she liked him. And\nhere I have that cousin of mine who is 14, let me introduce them to each other. And\nshe did that. She invited me for \u2014 for Pesach, to come and visit with her, and I did.\nAnd I went there and she introduced me to that boy. And he \u2014 the first thing he\nasked me was to go for a walk in the park with him. And I forgot my gloves and my\nhands were very cold, and I was always preoccupied about my hands because of the\npiano. So we were walking in the park and he took my hands into his hands and he\nsay \u2014 he was \u2014 see, he said to me, I will always keep you warm. He was ready to go\nto medical school, and there was innumerous clauses in Poland, as you know. And\nas his brother lived in Italy, in Genoa, and was a very known dentist, he was ready\nto go to his brother to study medicine. So when \u2014 he took me to the train when I left,\nAugust 15, 1998\nbrought me some flowers, and I came home and my father said, what are those\nflowers from? And I said, well, a boy gave it to me. My father said, throw it away.\nHe went to Genoa and he wrote letters to me, and of course I wasn\u2019t allowed to date\nanyhow, so there was no danger of my dating, but \u2014",

        "A: He didn\u2019t talk much about it. No, he was in Italy, having a very good time, living\nwith his brother and sister-in-law in a beautiful apartment. So, we didn't talk about\nit. It seemed so remote at the time.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Of course.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: But this was in Germany, you know, it wouldn\u2019t come to us, it was there. That\u2019s\nwhat we thought. It\u2019s funny, nobody realized what is going to happen.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely, very Jewish, very Jewish. And \u2014",
        "A: Not in Poland. And if \u2014 and it\u2019s funny because Julian was living in Italy, where\nMussolini was at that time. But this was before he \u2014 he w \u2014 formed the friendship\nwith Hitler. And Mussolini at the time was very nice to Jews there. He changed\nlater.

But in 1939, the Germans came from\nthe west, the Russians from the east, and this is where they met, in Przemysl. The\nriver was the border. And it stayed like that for almost a year, until 1940. And then I\n\u2014at that time I lived in Lvov with my husband, we got married and I lived there in\nthe beginning. But my father was telling me later that one night, without any\npreparation or anything, they were not aware that it\u2019s coming. They started shooting\nat each other, the Germans and the Russians, and it was in my town. And my father\nsaid it was the most heroic shooting that he has ever witnessed. For some reason, the\nRussians must have gotten an order to just leave it and pull back. So they did. Asa\nAugust 15, 1998\nconsequence the \u2014 the Germans occupied the whole city. And that\u2019s when the\ntrouble started. [break]",
        "A: In 1939 they came to my town, but occupied only one part of the town. There\u2019s\nthe center river, was the border. The other side was occupied by the Russians.",

I\nknow only that the war was, without \u2014 without pity, without \u2014 without any \u2014 they\nwere so \u2014 the Russians were fighting beautifully, but they had an order to leave the\nwhole city and move back. So they left the city and the Germans consequently\nmoved in. And this is when trouble started.",
        "A: Well, I didn't \u2014 I really didn\u2019t realize what is going on. At first I saw some simple\nsoldiers in the city, the SS didn\u2019t move in yet. And it was relatively peaceful in the\nbeginning. They didn't start right away with the ghetto, the ghetto was formed much\nlater. But my father was very depressed, he probably felt that it\u2019s going to be very\nhard. And the first thing they did is to choose a Judenrat. You know what a\nJudenrat is?",
        "A: The Jewish council. And my father was chosen as one of those. So we always\nthought that because he is a part of the Judenrat he is relatively safe. The first thing\nthat I remember is that we were sitting in our apartment, 1t was \u2014 we were not in the\nghetto yet, there was no ghetto yet. And a few German soldiers knocked at our door\nAugust 15, 1998\nand I came to the door. And my father was sitting in the dining room at the table.\nThey didn\u2019t see him. And I came to the door and they ask me whether there are any\nmen in the house? And I said no, it\u2019s just me and my mother. And they looked at\nme, they \u2014 they thought about it for a moment, and they left. They didn\u2019t go in. Had\nthey gone in they probably would have taken my father, that was the first time I\nsaved him. And \u2014",

You know, they wanted\nmoney from the members of the Judenrat and you had to collect the money to give\nit to them to pacify them. And then my father came home one day and said, I think\nwe are going to move to a ghetto. They are forming a ghetto.",
        "A: Not by then. They came later. They formed the ghetto on the other side of the\ncity, which was not primarily Jewish. In other words, it was not occupied by Jews.\nAnd \u2014\nAugust 15, 1998",

I wanted to study cosmetology in Lvov, as I had that cousin and I\ncould have stayed with her. It took a year. My father was terribly against it, he said,\nyou want to become a hairdresser? I said, no, as a hairdresser, I want to study\ncosmetology. Well, he said all right. So I went to Lvov and I spent a whole year\nthere. And that was in 1938. And it was a very happy year, very nice year. I worked\nthere and my \u2014 when my husband would come for occasion, he would teach me\nabout skin layers, because he was \u2014 he was a medical student, so he knew more than\nI did.

        "A: Well, when Julian came back from Italy in 1938, end of 1938, beginning of\n1939, we started thinking about it, and eventually we thought, well he is here, he\ndoesn\u2019t \u2014 he has no chance to leave the country and go somewhere else. We \u2014 in the\nbeginning we thought we will get married and then we will go to Italy or whe \u2014\nwhere his brother was.

And he sent a \u2014 a truck with some soldiers, I don\u2019t know, he\npaid them probably, I don\u2019t know where he found them. And they came to get us,\nand we went to Przemysl.

        "A: He couldn\u2019t do it \u2014 think about it. How do you handle it? You appease the \u2014 the\nenemy. That\u2019s the only way you could handle it. Until that night when they took the\n1,000 boys from the ghetto, but there\u2019s another story.",
        "A: Well, I remember \u2014 I remember that we had a beautiful dining room set still. And\nI remember a German woman came with a soldier looking at that apartment. And\nshe said to him, I want that table. There was a very beautiful tablecloth on the table,\nso my mother tried to take it off and she said no, the tablecloth goes with the table.\nAnd they took it. In other words, they could come in your house, your apartment and\nwhatever they \u2014 they liked, they could take.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember my reaction. I was shocked probably, but \u2014 I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand it how somebody \u2014 my \u2014 my mother was much, much broadminded\nAugust 15, 1998\nabout it. She says, as long they take the table, it\u2019s all right, as long it doesn\u2019t concern\nthe people. Which was smart. I wasn\u2019t so smart at that time. But, in other words,\nthey could do, those wives of the officers, or SS or whatever, could come to you and\ntake whatever they wanted.",
        "A: My personal things? Well, they \u2014 they did take jewelry yes, yes, I remember that.\nBut I \u2014 I have very vague impressions about that. Not until we came to the ghetto.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, we wore an armband with the Jewish star.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s funny, nothing. Nothing, because we all wore it. This didn\u2019t\nmatter at all to us. And then when we were in the ghetto, of course, it was very\nimportant that you do \u2014 do some work, that you do something that might justify your\nexistence, so to speak.",
        "A: It was a white armband about that wide, and it had a \u2014 a blue St-Star of David on\nit.\nAugust 15, 1998",

        "A: Even before the ghetto, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, the Judenrat did that.",
        "A: That I don\u2019t remember. I am trying to remember whether I had, I \u2014 must have\nbeen some special identification card, but I don\u2019t remember it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You know, I keep thinking about \u2014 are you talking about ghetto years?",
        "A: Before that?",
        "A: The only person I talked about it to was my mother. I don\u2019t remember talking to\nany girlfriends. I don\u2019t remember any girlfriend \u2014 Jewish girlfriends. Yes, I had one\ngirlfriend who visited me in the ghetto. I don\u2019t know what happened to her.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: That\u2019s a bad year.",
        "A: Very.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, we knew about it.",
        "A: From \u2014 from my father, from the Judenrat, of course. He was very depressed at\nthat time. He knew that we are losing it, and there was not a thing we could do about\nit. At the time when \u2014 are you talking about the ghetto years?",
        "A: Immediately before. Immediately before, we \u2014 we received an announcement that\nwe all have to move to this part of town.",
        "A: Right. And \u2014 and we had to find a place to live there, which we did for \u2014 my\nfather found an apartment for us.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Yes, yes, with my parents, yes.",
        "A: No. No, in the beginning when we lived in Lvov, we had a little apartment. When\nwe moved to Przemysl we lived with them. And then, when we moved to the\nghetto, we decided to get his parents from Lvov. So my father managed to send\nsomebody and they brought them to Przemysl and we found them a little apartment\non the same floor where we lived.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the name of the street. It\u2019s funny. It was a part of city that I\nnever went to. I know you had to cross a \u2014 a bridge over the \u2014 the train station, was a\nbridge you ca \u2014 you had to cross the bridge and it was \u2014 it was a \u2014 a lower standard\npart of the city. And they built a f\u2014 a fence there.",
        "A: No, it was a \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 brick. Brick fence. And they moved the Judenrat there, of course, and we\nmoved there.",
        "A: The apartment in the ghetto? It was two rooms and a kitchen.",
        "A: For the four of us, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well, we had beds. We had a bedroom set, my parents\u2019 bedroom set, and there\nwas one set for us. Not set, really, beds.",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t remember. Must have been a truck, but a \u2014 must \u2014 probably my father\narranged it. I don\u2019t remember this. And then when his parents came, they had a one\nbedroom apartment on the same floor.",
        "A: Very little, really. I don\u2019t even remember. I don\u2019t remember being troubled by\nchanging my clothes or \u2014 or \u2014 or not having enough clothing. I must have had\nenough, I always had enough. But \u2014 but I remember very little about it, really.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t remember that either. The only thing \u2014 I know that my husband, who\nwas always a very particular dresser, and I know that I was standing there, and I had\nan ironing board and an iron and I would iron his pants, because he wouldn\u2019t wear it\nAugust 15, 1998\notherwise. But I \u2014 I really don\u2019t remember being involved in \u2014 or worrying about\nwhat I\u2019m going to wear. This was so immaterial at the time. It was not important at\nall. That\u2019s funny. And yet, he and I, both of us, worked outside of the ghetto. It is a\nvery important part of my life. We worked in a place called \u2014 do you know German?",
        "A: Enklausungstella(ph). It was a place where they have specia \u2014 they had special\nmachines where they brought uniforms from the front, full of lice and other things\nand they put them through those machines to disinfect them, to clean them. We\nwould march out every morning.",
        "A: Julian and I. He was with a group of men, I was with the women. And we had\nthe armbands and we were not allowed to walk where people walked, but we had to\ngo where the cars and th \u2014 the horses were going, in the middle of the street. And\nthey would take us every morning out of the ghetto, to that place where we spend\nthe whole day, and in the evening they would \u2014 in the af \u2014 late afternoon they would\nbring us back. The reason why this 1s important 1s because there was one German \u2014 |\ncannot talk about it \u2014 about him without crying \u2014 whom I was so grateful to. The\ndirector of that camp, he was not a Nazi, he was a newspaperman from Berlin. He\nwas lovely. He said to me \u2014 he was always address me the German way, Frau\nAugust 15, 1998\nDoktor, because in German language, the woman gets the title of her husband, if he\nis a doctor. So he would come to me and he would say, I am so ashamed, I am so\nembarrassed, but I know I am being watched. And according to their rules, if\nsomebody was caught stealing something, what could you steal something there? A\ndirty pair of socks or a dirty pair of pants. He has to give them public beating. So\none day he came to me and he said \u2014 there was a 15 year old boy there working, and\nhe was caught stealing the pair of socks, and he says, I am supposed to give him a\npublic licking. Tell him to scream as loud as he can. I will not hurt him, but I have to\npretend that I am doing it, I have been watched. I know I am being watched. So I did\nthat. He didn\u2019t let me work with the \u2014 with the uniforms. He says, you are not going\nto work there. You stay in the kitchen and peel potatoes. And to this day I cannot\npeel potatoes without turning my head away. When the SS would drop in\nsometimes, if they didn\u2019t have any theater or any recreation they thought that they\nwill go, and all the women, young or old, had to undress as God has made them.\nTotally naked. Stand in the row \u2014 I have seen it, and if \u2014 they would look them over,\nand if they didn\u2019t like a pair of breasts, they would hit with the whip. Anyway they\ndidn\u2019t like the back, they would hit in the back. He would come running to the\nkitchen and say to me, you don\u2019t go there. I will hide you and you can take a shower\nwhenever you feel like it. And somebody could have thought that maybe there was a\nAugust 15, 1998\nspecial interest in him in me, and it wasn\u2019t. He was \u2014 he was as much dedicated to\nmy husband as he was to me. He said to me one day, my parents have a farm near\nBerlin, and I\u2019m making some papers for you so you could go there and spend the\nrest of the war there working on that farm. Then somebody gave him out, that he\u2019s\ntoo good to the Jews. And one day they sent him out to the front, to the Russian\nfront. And the first thing I did when I got out of hiding, I tried to find out what has\nhappened to him. And I found a boy who was with him, and he told me that he was\nkilled at the Russian front. I still remember his last name, Burba, b-u-r-b-a. He was\na newspaperman. He was so nice.",
        "A: I would say 26 maybe.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember his first name, just the last name. He was very nice. He wasn\u2019t\nnice only to me, he was nice to everybody. He really felt \u2014 he was embarrassed. He\nwas very nice. It shows you that even among them, you could find somebody who\nwas nice. So we worked there, day after day after day until \u2014 until they made another\naktion, as they call it, they tried to get people. And I had a cousin, a young girl, who\nAugust 15, 1998\nwas supposed to go to the train. And my in-laws were supposed to go to the train.\nMy husband couldn\u2019t make himself take them, so I took them. I took them to the\ntrain. Of course, rumors were \u2014 we knew where they are going. They had to\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Rumors. Rumors started that there is a concentration camp, that they gas people.\nBut we all believed that maybe it was exaggeration. You know, nobody wants to\nbelieve that. So I took them to the train and it was started to rain. And my mother-in-\nlaw had beautiful, heavy hair. She didn\u2019t wear anything, and I had a s \u2014 some scarf\naround my neck. So I took it off and put it on her. And she \u2014 she \u2014 she embraced me\nand she said, you tell \u2014 tell my son that I said you will survive the war. I loved my\nmother-in-law. She was the sweetest woman. The nicest person. I never heard a\nword of criticism from her to any of her daughters-in-law. She was lovely. So, that\nwas it. That must have been in the summer of \u00b042.",
        "A: Yes. Must have been maybe later. While we were \u2014 funny how it happens in life.\nWhile we were working in that Enklausungstella(ph), Polish woman \u2014 women used\nto come there to buy some bargains from the Jewish women. We were not allowed\nto carry anything in our hands. So what we did is, I know I had all my \u2014 my\nAugust 15, 1998\nbeautiful pure silk nightgowns, hand embroidered, which I didn\u2019t need. I used to put\none on top of another on myself, and this way I could carry it with me. And that\nPolish woman, whose husband worked in that camp, because some Polish \u2014 Polish\npeople worked in the camp when they were mechanics or they did something with\nthe machines. Her husband worked there, she would come there. And one day we\nwere conducting a transaction, I was selling her my nightgowns, she was buying\nthat. And mind you, she was a total stranger to me. And I was young. And she\nwould say \u2014 she said suddenly to me, my God, you are so young, and you are so\npretty \u2014 I was pretty at the time \u2014 and I feel so sorry for you. If you want to hide,\ncome to me. I was flabbergasted. I says, do you realize what you are saying? Do you\nknow that if you are caught, they put you to death? She said, I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m not\nafraid. She was the happy-go-lucky type. That was our luck. Well, from that day on,\nJulian tried to find out where they lived. And they lived on the other side of the city,\nquite a distance from us. Her husband would come every evening to the ghetto \u2014 is it\nworking? \u2014 to the ghetto wall, and Julian would make a package of our things, and\nthrough the Jewish policeman give it to him, and he would take that home. So, we\nthought, in case we would have to go and hide, we will have some things there. And\nthat was going on for some while, until November \u201942, when the \u2014 when the rumors\nstarted to circulate that there will be a new aktion and they will take people. That\nAugust 15, 1998\nday Julian said, this time we are not going to give anything, we are going out. My\nfather wasn\u2019t home, because if my father had been home, he would never let me go.\nSo my mother said to me, you go better before your father come home \u2014 comes\nhome. We left, it was getting darker, and you know, we had a curfew hour. So we\nhad to be \u2014 go out before the curfew. And as we were going down the stairs to go\nout \u2014 there was no light in the stairway at the time, 1t was dark \u2014 I heard my father\u2019s\nfootsteps, he was coming up. And this stands with me, all those years, I still dream\nof that. And th \u2014 my first impulse was to go to him, but Julian was behind me and\nhe stopped me. And I let my father pass me, and I didn't say goodbye to him. That\nwas the \u2014 the worst thing, I think, in my life. But before we go to that, I \u2014 I have to\nstep back, before I tell you a \u2014\n[break]",
        "A: Well, there was one requirement of the SS. One day they came to the Judenrat,\nand they required in a very specific way, they wanted the Judenrat members to do\ntheir dirty work. They needed 1,000 boys, age 12 to 16 being taken from homes.\nAnd that was the only time I saw my father crying. I opened the door, he was\nstanding there crying, and I said, what happened? And he was telling me, and I said\nAugust 15, 1998\nto him, if they want 1,000 boys, you have to give them \u2014 them 1,000 boys. And he\nsaid to me, how can you say that, you are my daughter, how can \u2014 how can I go to\none mother saying, you son will go, and the other mother, your son will stay? Am I\nGod? I said, you have to do it, because if you don\u2019t do it, you know what will\nhappen. The Nazis will take this \u2014 this 1,000 boys, but they will shoot another 1,000\non the way. And he said, you are right. And they let them have 1,000 boys during\nthat particular night. Nobody slept, of course. Of course the boys were never seen\nagain. And I went out in the morning, about six o\u2019clock in the morning, outside.\nThere was not a living soul, nothing. Total stillness. There was not a bird, not a\nwind, not a breeze, nothing. I went into a rage, and I looked up and I said God damn\nyou, wherever you are. This is not the God I want. I don\u2019t want any part of you. And\nwhat\u2019s more, I don\u2019t want you to save me. That was one thing. As you see, it didn\u2019t\nhappen. The other thing was, one day they let me know that the SS came to the\nJudenrat and took all the members of the Judenrat to the train. And I went wild.\nSo I ran to the Judenrat. We didn't live far away, and I had some friends there, and\nthey said to me, don\u2019t go in. He is a wild animal. He just shot some people, he will\nshoot you. And I couldn\u2019t care less. I went in. I didn\u2019t knock at the door, I just\nopened the door, and I can still see him as is it was yesterday. He was the most\nbeautiful young man I have ever seen. Very tall, very blonde, very Nordic looking,\nAugust 15, 1998\nwith blue eyes like two blue ice cubes. And he was leaning on the desk holding in\none hand, in the right hand, he had a \u2014 a gun that was obviously shot a short time\nago, in the other a whip. I opened the door, he didn\u2019t even look at me. And I didn\u2019t \u2014\ndidn\u2019t say anything, I was just standing there. He said to me, what do you want? In\nGerman. So I answered in German. I said, I came to inquire about my father. And I\ntell him he is a member of the Judenrat and I hear that he was taken. He still didn\u2019t\nlook at me. He wasn't interested at all in what I was saying. What puzzled him was\nthat I used such a good German language. That impressed him. He said to me, where\ndid you learn German so well? I said, well German was my best foreign language, I\nhad it eight years in high school. And I \u2014 I really risk a lot, because I was getting\nfresh, and I said, would you like me to recite you some Goethe? Then he looked at\nme and he said, what about your father? I said, well, I hear he is on the train going to\nAuschwitz. He called two germ \u2014 two Jewish policemen and he said, where is that\nman? So they told him he is on the train and they are going to Auschwitz. He said to\nme, you go home and wait. I promise you I will get your father. I didn\u2019t have any\nother \u2014 I had to go. I came home, and all my neighbors were there and my mother.\nAnd when I told them, they said, don\u2019t believe it. Nobody has ever come out of the\ntrain going to Auschwitz. And we waited and waited and was getting dark outside.\nAbout 10 o\u2019clock at night we heard some footsteps. Two Jewish policemen brought\nAugust 15, 1998\nmy father home. Later I was told that they stopped the train on the way and they\nstarted calling his name Salzburg. My father was so fatumult that he didn\u2019t even\nreact to that. But somebody sitting next to him said to him, isn\u2019t that your name? He\nsaid yes. So he got up and went out of the train and those two Jewish policemen\nbrought him home. He was unconscious for about two days. He didn't know what\nwas going on. After he got better and he realized that he is home, he took my hand,\nand he said thank you. So I gave him a \u2014I gave him a-about a year of miserable life,\nbut life. I still to this day don\u2019t understand what made this German keep his word. It\nwas puzzling to me. But he did. They stopped the train, actually. Nobody believed it.\nThose are the two things I wanted to tell you about our ghetto experience. Now,\ngoing back to coming out of the ghetto \u2014",

        "A: In the ghetto, in the ghetto.",
        "A: Well, what do they think? They probably resented it up to a certain extent,\nbecause whenever the Germans needed something, they went to the Judenrat, and it\nwas a vicious circle, and the Judenrat had to accommodate them, to keep peace.\nThey thought they would; of course, they didn\u2019t. And also, everybody was resentful\nAugust 15, 1998\nto a certain extent because they thought that the Judenrat is safe, and it wasn\u2019t. It\nwas just delaying it a little bit.",

For that mission they usually send some Jewish\npolicemen with \u2014 with somebody younger. Well, the Jewish policemen had to do\ntheir job. They thought that it \u2014 probably that they will save their life, which they\ndidn\u2019t, cause a vicious circle.\nAugust 15, 1998",

        "A: Somewhere in the ghetto we bought it. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the details, I\nonly know that we gave enough money to buy a ring.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: We talked very little. We talked very little because there was nothing good to talk\nabout. I remember coming back from work. We were \u2014 we were six people in a row\nworking. And I happened to be at the end of the row. And a Italian officer saw me\nand started walking alongside with me. And at that time I knew a little Italian, very\nlittle, from Julian. And he said something to me and I answered and he \u2014 he took\nout the package of cigarettes and wanted to treat me to some cigarettes and I says, I\ndon\u2019t smoke, but may I take it for my husband? And he gave it to me. So I\nremember that, but I only remember that he was very nice to us, and very apologetic.\nAnd that really, that man who was in charge, he felt \u2014 he felt guilty, although he di \u2014\nhe himself didn\u2019t do anything, but he felt guilty for his fellow \u2014 for \u2014 for other\npeople.

        "A: Very little. Very little. Because, first of all, we didn\u2019t want to attract attention,\nprobably. You tried to be as impersonal as you possibly can. It\u2019s funny, there were\nsome women with me in the kitchen working too, and I cannot remember them.",

When we were 22 months in hiding,\nwhen we went out of the ghetto, we bribed \u2014 Julian bribed a Jewish policeman, who\nprobably bribed the other one, and they let us out. They closed their eyes. Julian\nwent with him, with her husband, who led the way, and I was behind, walking. And\nas we had to pass the Gestapo building on the way there. There was no other way to\ngo. And there was a soldier standing, watching. At a certain moment, when Julian\nwas with him, he said, halt. Stopped them. So Julian said \u2014 first he thought he 1s\ngoing to ask for his papers, so he says, I have [speaks foreign language here]\nwhich means, I have a \u2014 I am allowed to walk after curfew. He had that document.\nAugust 15, 1998\nHe says [speaks foreign language], it\u2019s not important. Julian had a \u2014 what do you\ncall it? Not lantern.",
        "A: Flashlight in his pocket and it just happened that the flashlight was on and the\nlight was seeking through. So he \u2014 that\u2019s why he stopped him. And he thought he \u2014\nhe is going to ask him for papers, and things like that. That was one thing. Then we\ncame there. Now, we came to hide, we were hidden for 22 months, from November\nto August \u00b044. It was a kitchen, you entered, there was a little hall, and a pantry\nwithout the window. That pantry was very important. And then you entered the\nkitchen and there was one room behind the kitchen. There was no separate entrance\nto the room, it had to be through the kitchen. They lived all their lives, especially in\nthe winter, in the kitchen, because there was the stove and it was warm. She\nentertained German soldiers in that kitchen. We were in the room. We could not \u2014\ncan you imagine in 22 months you cannot sneeze, you cannot cough, you cannot say\na lot of word, and you cannot make a \u2014 a loud step, and you cannot be sick. We lived\nlike that in that room for 22 months. There was no toilet in that apartment. In other\nwords, if we wanted to use the facilities, you had to go a half a flight stairs down,\nand there was, probably for \u2014 for many people, there was the facility. People have,\nwhen I talk to my granddaughter\u2019s class about it, one boy got up and said, how did\nAugust 15, 1998\nyou do without a toilet? I said, that\u2019s a good question. There was a fire in th \u2014 in the\nstove, constantly, and that fire helped. Whatever you had to burn, you burned. And\nthe rest you pour out down the drain. So he was satisfied when I explained to him. I\nsaid, believe me, it wasn\u2019t easy. Julian developed such a magnificent sense of\nhearing that he knew what was going on in the kitchen before I knew it. From\ncertain \u2014 he knew which \u2014 which place the floor was squeaking. One time an\nelectrical man came to check the electricity. We didn't know he 1s coming. And of\ncourse he had to come to the room. So that was a \u2014 there was a mirror with a\u2014a\npiece of furniture with a mirror standing in the corner, but cutting off that corner, so\none could hide behind it. Well Julian s \u2014 only heard the words, electricity, and he\npointed to me to go behind that thing and he went under the bed. And the room had\nto look always unoccupied, always. He came in with her, and I heard her say [sighs].\nAnd he looked at the ri \u2014 lamps or something, checked. And when he left, she came\nin and she says, good work guys. The first 10 months, because we accumulate a lot\nof things, of clothing in her house, she would sell 1t for us, and we would give her\nthe money for the food. Well, after 10 months, my things have run out, and I told\nher, we don\u2019t have any money any more. So she was \u2014 she was very good about tt.\nWhen he didn\u2019t see, she would open the door and quickly push in a \u2014 a\u2014 a\u2014 some\nsoup, let\u2019s say, or some bread. We ate very little, but whatever it was. There was a\nAugust 15, 1998\nwindow in that room that was overlooking a field, and a young girl would come\nevery day with her cow to let the cow roam around. And I wouldn\u2019t stand at the\nwindow because I was afraid somebody might spot me. So I would kneel at the\nwindow and look at her. And I would say to Julian, what I wouldn\u2019t give to be this\ncow. I mean, people don\u2019t know what it means. 22 months. She worked for a\nGerman place. She spoke German. She didn\u2019t know how to read it, but she spoke\nGerman, for some reason she did. And once in awhile she would invite those\nGerman soldiers over for a party. So I help her cook and bake. And then we would\nhide in that pantry. And she would give them enough to \u2014 drinks to make them half\ndrunk, and they would lie down on her bed and sleep. And when they were asleep,\nwe would come in, go right near. I looked at them when they were asleep, and go to\nother room. When finally the war was almost over, there was a terrible fighting\nbetween the German and the Russian armies. Terrible fighting. The entire household\nwent down to the basement, except us. So we were sitting in the pantry, and Julian\nkept his hands over my ears so I wouldn\u2019t hear that shooting. When suddenly the\nshooting stopped, and I said to Julian, am I crazy, or did I hear a Russian words\nthere? At the moment when I said that, she opened the door and she said, you are\nfree. The Russians are here, you can go out. There was no joy in me. Absolutely\nnothing. So I said \u2014 my reaction was, now I am going to sleep. And I went to sleep\nAugust 15, 1998\nwithout fear, once. At least once without fear, and I slept 24 hours. Julian went out\nright away. I couldn\u2019t make myself go out for about a week. I was afraid to face the\nworld. So finally we went out, one Sunday afternoon. Beautiful, sunny afternoon.\nMy town, where I was born, where I went to school, I didn\u2019t know a living soul.\nAnd as we were walking, I said to Julian, where are we going? He says, I don\u2019t\nknow, let\u2019s just walk. And as we were walking a man approached us. And he saw\nme, and he stood there and said, I don\u2019t believe it. Aren\u2019t you Isadore Salzburg\u2019s\ndaughter? I said yes. Was a lawyer, Jewish lawyer. Said to us, where are you going?\nI said, I don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t have a place. He says, come with me, I just opened an\napartment, it belonged to a Nazi. So we went with him. There were no beds, but it\ndidn\u2019t matter. I slept on the desk, Julian slept on the floor. And this was our first\napartment. And from that day on, I was going out every day, looking for Jews that\ncame out from hiding. And our apartment was full of people in a very short time.\nYou were \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t believe, we would spend entire evenings telling s \u2014 each\nother stories. Of course, I didn\u2019t have a penny to mours \u2014 to our soul. So I \u2014 one day\nI saw a woman coming out of hiding, and I could recognize them coming out of\nhiding a mile away, there was something about the \u2014 the way they were walking,\nlike we did. And I \u2014I saw that woman coming out of hiding, and she was a wife of a\nlawyer, her husband died. And she came out of hiding, so I said, come with me. We\nAugust 15, 1998\nhad a \u2014 a-an apartment full of people. And she \u2014 the first thing she said to me, she\ntook out some money, pocket money \u2014 paper money from her pocket and said, do\nyou need any money\u201d It was so unimportant. Here, have some. And that was the first\nmoney we got. Then Julian joined the army, Polish army as a \u2014 as a physician.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Maria Dambrowska(ph). Her grandson is still alive in Przemysl and I sent him\nmoney. Yeah. And my son graduated medical school, he decided to go to Poland for\na visit. He understands Polish, he speaks a little Polish. He went to Przemysl, she\nwas still alive. Of course, I gave him money for her. And I was very curious what\nshe will say. When he came back I said, what did she say when she saw you? He\nsays, Mother, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. She put her arms around me and started to\ncry. You know, that after we moved out to that apartment that the man gave us, she\ncouldn\u2019t stand it. She moved out from her place and moved to the same house, to the\nsame floor, opposite our apartment. So she lived there with us again.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Of course I didn't know, but did \u2014 did we have any choice? Was either that or\nbeing on the train. Sooner or later. I mean, is \u2014 it was inevitable that we will end on\nthe train.",
        "A: Because so many people went. I mean, we couldn\u2019t be an exception. Maybe not\nsooner, maybe a little later. I finally \u2014 you know I found out that my father was\ntaken.",
        "A: Oh, I \u2014 I didn't tell you that. As we were \u2014 as we were in hiding, one evening\nsomebody came to the kitchen. We didn\u2019t know who it was, we just heard the voice.\nAnd we were \u2014 from what he said we could understand that he was a Jewish man\nwho happened to know her, he knew her. And you would always try to find a way,\nsomebody who \u2014 who could help you. So he thought he would go out of the ghetto\nand go to her place, maybe she can take him. He didn\u2019t know she had us. I felt very\nguilty about that later. And as he was sitting in the kitchen and talking to her, she\nasked him what happened to Mr. Salzburg? And he says, oh, he was \u2014 he and his\nwife were taken on the train to Auschwitz. And when Julian heard that he put both\nhands on my ears so I wouldn\u2019t hear it, but I heard it. So later \u2014 my mother went to\nAuschwitz. After the war, I met a boy who was with my father on the train, who\nAugust 15, 1998\nsurvived Auschwitz, and he told me that on the way to Auschwitz the SS very often\nwas making some \u2014 they tried to find people who had money, and people usually\nhad some money with them. So my father, who was very \u2014 a person that \u2014 that\ncaught the eye, he asks him whether he has any money. He said no. He started sh \u2014\nlooking through his pockets and he found some money. So he told him to go straight\nahead and he shot him in the head. At least he was saved Auschwitz. Yeah. But she\ndid accomplish quite a lot I must say, this woman. Wasn\u2019t easy to have two people\nhidden in a small apartment.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t do it for money, because after the war, when Julian joined the army,\nand the first money I got, I went to her, and I gave it to \u2014 I wanted to give it to her,\nshe wouldn\u2019t take it. I think she really felt something for us. I don\u2019t know why, I\ndon\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know the reason, really, but she felt something. You know, to\naccomplish \u2014 to have 22 months with people where you can \u2014 and I told her, when\nshe first told me \u2014 suggested this to me, I said, do you know what will happen to you\nwhen you are caught? Oh, I am not afraid. She was the happy go lucky type.",
        "A: She was older than I was. She was in her, maybe close to 40 at the time, maybe\n35.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Actually, it wasn\u2019t her husband. You know, the funny thing is that we didn\u2019t\nknow it. She was carrying his name and we thought they were married. Then we\nfound out that she\u2019d left her husband and she \u2014 he was just living with her. And th \u2014\nthe dangerous thing was that when he \u2014 he used to drink quite a lot. And when he\ndrank he would threaten her with us. And that was dangerous. So we were very\nafraid sometimes about him. But she could control him somehow. And she was\nfunny. I used to read German papers and tell her what\u2019s going on in the world so\nwhen she would go to work \u2014 she worked for a German firm, she could tell them,\nand she was well informed. She was a character.",
        "A: Some \u2014 not very important. Something in the \u2014 in the office, maybe. But she\nspoke German, but she didn\u2019t know how to read it, and she didn\u2019t want to admit it.",
        "A: Not once. Not once. And when Doris Schulman(ph) was wondering about it, she\nsays, don\u2019t you get a \u2014 didn\u2019t you get a cold, didn\u2019t you have to sneeze? I said I\ncouldn't afford to sneeze. Because well, to the kitchen, her neighbors used to come\nto the kitchen and they couldn\u2019t hear us. They \u2014 they \u2014 actually the first rule of being\nAugust 15, 1998\nhidden by somebody in this situation was that absolutely nobody must know it,\nbecause was enough if one person would know, and the word spreads. About two\nweeks before we were liberated, I had a friend in school who came from a very\nOrthodox Jewish family and the 15 people of that family were hidden somewhere.\nAnd two weeks before the war ended somebody gave them out and they were all\nshot. So this was terribly important that nobody, absolutely nobody would know.\nOnce it happened that I was wearing \u2014 I was wearing a housecoat, and she said to\nme, come in, and I was standing, you know, at the door of the room, between the\nroom and the kitchen, talking to her, when her neighbor didn\u2019t knock at the door,\njust opened the door, came in and saw me. And my first impulse was to hide, you\nknow, but she didn\u2019t lose her nerve. She said \u2014 she immediately had a story. Tho \u2014\nthey were \u2014 those are Polish people and they were in black market, black marketing\nand the police stopped them and they came here to hide for a few hours. And as soon\nshe got her out of the apartment, that woman. And then she managed to get her back\n\u2014 she was very clever \u2014 and she said, look through the window, there they are, you\nsee? They left now. They felt more secure so they \u2014 they went away. Here they are\naround the corner. And she made it so that the woman never suspected. [break]\nAugust 15, 1998\nand we were just talking about the conditions when you were 1n hiding for 22\nmonths. While you were in hiding, were you aware of what was happening in the\nghetto? You sa \u2014 you had mentioned about the one man coming and you heard about",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He sometimes went to the ghetto door \u2014 gate and got some news, als \u2014",
        "A: He 1s the \u2014 the \u2014 her supposed husband.",
        "A: Stanislaw, I believe. And he once, twice or three times brought a letter from my\nmother. She came to the ghetto gate and probably handed him the letter. And one\ntime he brought me a \u2014 a ball of yarn, and I was very surprised to see it. I was\nthinking what \u2014 what is \u2014 why did my mother send me a ball of yarn? Then Julian\nstarted to rewind the yarn, there was a ring inside. But \u2014 well, I knew that the\nconditions are getting worse. They \u2014 they \u2014 he told me and he heard it in \u2014 and you\nhear it from other people talking, Polish people who are talking about the conditions.\nIt was expected. As the \u2014 as the war was going to the inevitable end, 1t was expected\nthat they won\u2019t \u2014 won\u2019t leave the Jews alone.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Well, they almost \u2014 they almost \u2014 all of the Jewish population of the ghetto\nalmost went out to Auschwitz, unless you could hide, which was not very often.",
        "A: We knew that they have \u2014 that they gas people. Oh, we knew that.",
        "A: Gossip. Letters probably. Maybe somebody escaped once in awhile. I \u2014 I doubt\nthat, but there were rumors. They were not really news, they were rumors. But you\nknew that they do something with the people. They had to do something with the\npeople. You know, when the Russians came in, and finally I \u2014 we went out and had\nthis empty apartment, I met a Russian high ranked officer on the street, who said to\n\u2014 the first thing he said to me is, where is your papa? Where is your daddy? He\nknew him from before. He said to me, he was a fine man. Strange, how this happens\nin life. I had \u2014 I had two black women come here one day with a bible. And they ask\nme \u2014 they wanted to convert me, and they ask me whether I believe in God, and I\nsaid no, I don\u2019t. How can I? But, on the other side, I am \u2014 I am here. This is my\nfourth life, you know. First life was in Przemysl as a girl, was very happy. Very\nhappy life, no problems. Then the second life was under the occupation, and hiding.\nAnd the third life was after the war. And since my husband died, it\u2019s my fourth life.\nAugust 15, 1998\nHe didn\u2019t have a right to leave me alone. Oh, there\u2019s something I wanted to tell you,\nvery important. When we went into hiding, we were planning it, I said to him, I\nwon\u2019t go u-unless you meet my conditions. You have to have poison with you\nbecause I will not go in German \u2014 to German\u2019s hands alive. He says, you can be sure\nPll have it. All right. We went into hiding and there was one night when the German\ncars were passing by [makes tooting noise]. And a neighbor came in and said,\nMarie, you don\u2019t have to be nervous, they\u2019re just going from house to house looking\nfor Jews. Would you believe that they went from one house to another, this is the\nonly house they didn\u2019t enter? There is something written in the stars. At that time\nwhen I heard those cars and she said they are going looking for Jews, I said to\nJulian, I want the poison now. He says no. When they will enter this house, Pll give\nit to you. They never entered. That\u2019s na \u2014 that\u2019s not the end of the story. After the\nwar, as Julian didn\u2019t have anything else but one pair of pant and a shirt, and he was\nalways a snappy dresser, he ask me to press his pants. I picked them up, and you\nknow the European pants are finished with the belt of the same material. And as I\npicked them up, there was something stiff there. So I said to him, Julian, I cannot\npress it like that, there is something in that belt, you have to take it out. What do you\nthink it was? Poison. And at that time I gave him such hell for telling me that he\ndoesn\u2019t have it. I said, you promise, you don\u2019t keep your promise. I was angry at\nAugust 15, 1998\nhim. He said, if I would have shown it to you, you would have taken it then. This\nway, you waited. And he took it out from his pants. That\u2019s a story, huh? He was a\nvery good man. When they t \u2014 when he died they gave him a beautiful memorial at\nSaint Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital. He was clinical director there. And they really were very\nnice. Nice people. Everybody liked him.",
        "A: Peacefully, without being afraid, because you know, it\u2019s a terrible thing when\nyou are afraid at night.",
        "A: It was a [indecipherable]",
        "A: It was an incredible experience. Julian went out the first time, he had a cane and\nhe walked with a cane. When I went with him, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a strange experience when\nyou don\u2019t own anything. Nothing. I had a skirt and a blouse. He had a pair of pants\nand a shirt. And we walked. And we didn\u2019t go \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where we are\ngoing. We didn\u2019t know what \u2014 where we are going to sleep at night. We didn\u2019t own\nAugust 15, 1998\nanything. In a way it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s exhilarating, you don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\nYou don\u2019t own anything.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Amazingly well. Amazingly well. When my friends ask me now how come I \u2014 I\nkeep so well, I say I ha \u2014I had a good training.",
        "A: No, healthy as a horse. Nothing. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The way you handle it in Europe all the way, a piece of paper.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Amazing, amazing. You know then, when Julian started with the \u2014\nwith the army, he made friends with \u2014 with the cook and he used to bring home\npieces of meat like that, and all day long I cooked, because I had so many people.\nAugust 15, 1998\nThen one day, somebody knocked at my door \u2014 I wonder whether she 1s still alive?\nAnd I opened the door, and I couldn\u2019t figure it out, whether it was a wom \u2014 a \u2014a girl\nor a man. The creature was very tall, very skinny. Shaven head, and she spoke\nGerman to me. She was Hungarian. She said she was with a group of women from\nMajdanek, Hungarian women, trying to go back to Budapest. They stopped in\nPrzemysl. Each one of them went to a different house, knocking at the door, trying\nto get some food or something, some money. So I said to her, come in, come in. And\nshe came in and I gave her dinner. And she says she was a daughter of a restaurateur\nin Budapest, she doesn\u2019t know whether her parents are alive. She survived\nMajdanek with a group of other girls, each one were \u2014 and I told her to bring others\nhere, I would have all fed them. And I tried to get together some money for her for\nthe train trip to \u2014 to Hungary. I don\u2019t know whether she survived that, but I was so\n\u2014I was so touched by her looks. I mean, she wore a \u2014 a \u2014 kind of a uniform coat, and\nshe was so skinny. Oh, the people that we had, it was very interesting after the war\nwhen I found those people coming out of hiding, and we all stayed together. Didn\u2019t\nmatter where we slept. Then I found out that two my cousins survived the war near\nWarsaw as Polish women. And the first occasion I had, I send them money and\nasked them to come to me, and they came.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember who told me. Somebody told me. I think it was the brother of\none of the girls, who is still alive in Florida.",
        "A: That man who came looking for \u2014 for a place to stay, he said that they took Mr.\nSalzburg and Mrs. Salzburg. So that\u2019s how I found my mother, otherwise I didn\u2019t\nknow. But it was very interesting to see all those people and we would sit at the\nevening and each one could write a book. And it\u2019s amazing what people can go th \u2014\ngo through and survive and still have \u2014 so those cousins of mine came to me, and the\nfirst thing Julian took them to the army \u2014 to the \u2014 to the shoemaker to have them\nmake some shoes for them. One of those cousins is still alive and she lives in\nMilburn, New Jersey. The other one passed away. So that was an experience.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we \u2014 we tried to get some beds for the apartment, and the first thing\nmy husband bought \u2014 got for me, and I don\u2019t know where he got it, was a concert\ngrand piano. And we put it in a room that was totally empty. The concert grand was\nin the center of the room, so all three of us, all the two girls that came to stay with\nus, all three of us played the piano, so we gave concerts.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Well we stayed only temporary. Then my husband was shipped as a army\nphysician to another town called Zheshev(ph), not far from Przemysl.",
        "A: Oh, he went into the Polish army as a captain.",
        "A: Because this way he got food and everything, it was easy. And they looked for\ndoctors there, so he went as a\u2014 as a\u2014 a captain [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, he was. It wasn\u2019t for the army. He was \u2014 his specialty was venereal diseases.\nI used to call him the king of the horrors. And we \u2014 he went to Zheshev(ph) as a \u2014\nas a army physician, but he didn't want me to go there because it was a\u2014 sucha\nsmall town. So I and this cousin of mine, who lives in Milburn, New Jersey, we\nmoved [phone ringing] \u2014 we moved to Krakow. We stayed in Krakow only a few\nmonths. In the meantime my uncle, who was in New York, found out that I am\nalive. I wrote to him, and he had some friends, one of whom was a director of a DP\ncamp in Munich, Germany. The other was a director of a DP camp outside of\nMunich, Germany. And those t \u2014 those two sent a Jeep with two young men\ndressed in UNRRA uniforms, who came from Munich, Germany to get us out of\nPoland. And they came in and they said, you have two hours to decide. We cannot\nAugust 15, 1998\nstay here, we are illegally here. Either you come with us, or you have to stay. It\nhappened that my husband was at that time with us in Krakow \u2014 with me in\nKrakow. And I said, let\u2019s go. So we took our dog and we boarded the Jeep and we\nwent to cross the Polish-Czechoslovakian border.",
        "A: We got the dog when he was in the army \u2014 with the army in Przemysl. They\nwent for some maneuvers to some residential prin \u2014 a [indecipherable] or\nsomething. And the soldiers found that little puppy dog, they put him in a suitcase or\nwhatever and brought him to me. And I was so geared tomas food \u2014 towards food,\nthat when I heard something moving in that \u2014 in that little suitcase, I was sure it\u2019s a\nchicken. That was the dog. He was a puppy, and he became our baby. So I have a\npicture where I\u2019m standing on the top of a house in Cieszyn, where the border\nbetween Poland ch \u2014 Czechoslovakia was. And Julian \u2014 w-we stayed with a\nOrthodox family, it was a Friday evening when we arrived there. We stayed\novernight, they were very nice to us. And the next morning the daughter of the\nhousehold went to talk to the soldier, because we didn\u2019t have any papers. She talked\nto him and she probably convinced him, so he let her open the \u2014 the \u2014 the border, the\nthing, the \u2014 and we went through.",
        "A: That was in 1944. Yes, in the summer 1944, very early. So \u2014",
        "A: After what? After the war?",
        "A: Liberated. Not long, a few months, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: [had no regrets. There was nothing in me. Look, we went through so much, that\nleaving was \u2014 first of all, all my life I wanted to be in America, as I said before, as a\nchild. My father kept it up. And my \u2014 I had two \u2014 two of my father\u2019s brothers and\nmy mother\u2019s sister living in New York. So I \u2014 I had no regrets of leaving. There was\nnothing in me at the time. And my only preoccupation was to cross those borders,\nbecause we were illegally.",
        "A: The people that I found on the streets, yes, the ones who were hidden like a \u2014 we\nwere, yes. Oh, we talked all the time. All the time, absolutely.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Louise Koch(ph). She married. That\u2019s her m \u2014 her husband was also a medical\ndoctor, whom I knew when I was a girl.",
        "A: Zarvin(ph). That\u2019s a very difficult name, Zarvin(ph). She was \u2014 she was \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 this was \u2014 her mother was the one who introduced Julian to me, and I told\nyou, that was her mother. Well, we crossed the border, we went on that trip with the\ndog to Praga. We stayed in Praga one or two nights, I don\u2019t remember exactly. We\ndidn\u2019t have a penny to our soul, we couldn\u2019t buy anything. They provided food for\nus, the two boys who came to get us. When we \u2014 the same way we crossed the\nCzechoslovakian-German border, when we finally came to Munich, we were lucky\nbecause \u2014 because of my uncle\u2019s friends, we didn\u2019t have to stay ina DP camp, we\nstayed with the UNRRA people, which was lovely. Beautiful house with a cook,\nwith everything. It was my first contact with Americans. I used to go in a Jeep when\nshe was touring the neighborhood, with her. Was very nice. And when \u2014 as we were\nstaying there, I took a job to teach some children music in that DP camp in Munich.\nAugust 15, 1998\nAnd Julian works \u2014 works as physician there. And it was very rewarding because I\ncould give something to those children, I like that very much. Except they didn\u2019t\nspeak my language, so I had to start with the Yiddish.",
        "A: It meant a lot. I hated every minute of it. I \u2014 I \u2014 Julian insisted I should get a\ngood piano teacher to continue my piano education. Well, I got a teacher from the\nconservatory in Munich who would come home to me, but I hated him, because\nevery time I would say something about the war, he would say, we didn\u2019t know\nanything. And I said you mean to tell me you didn\u2019t know? All those golden teeth,\nyou didn\u2019t know where they came from? All the jewelry? The work of art? I said to\nhim, you know, if I would find one German who would say yes, I knew what was\ngoing on, but we couldn\u2019t do anything about it, I would have some respect for him. I\nhated \u2014 it came to a point \u2014 I found out through my cousin, the one who called here,\nthat in a neighborhood hospital for \u2014 from where we lived, was a family, a mother\nand daughter and son-in-law, all three very sick people, Jews, of course. So I said to\nher, let\u2019s go. We went to the hospital and I brought something with me and I\nintroduced myself. And we became very, very friendly, but the son-in-law had\nleukemia. They were \u2014 they were hidden in terrible conditions and he died there in\nAugust 15, 1998\nthe hospital. And I would go every other day, I would take the train from Munich to\nGarmisch-Partenkirchen where the sanitorium was. And I would take my dog\nalong, and I buy a ticket for my dog and he had a seat. You know what means to be\nangry\u2019? I was \u2014 I had so much anger in me towards this ger \u2014 German people. I\ncouldn\u2019t help myself. I would take a chocolate with me on the train, and when would\nI do it otherwise? I saw those children, German children sitting across from me,\nlooking at me, and they were looking at the chocolate bars that I had. And I would\nunpack a chocolate bar and put the whole chocolate bar into my dog\u2019s mouth. I had\nsome satisfaction. Cruel, but satisfaction. After awhile, I said to my husband, I don\u2019t\ncare why I live, I can\u2019t stay in Germany. It\u2019s killing me. Absolutely killing me. So\nhe found out that there was a train of Italians who were brought to Germany by\nHitler to work in Germany and they were going back to Italy. So he volunteered as\na physician, I went as a nurse, and the dog we \u2014 went as a dog. So we were t \u2014 to\nItaly by train. And Julian had a very dear friend of his and his brother\u2019s. She was\nDutch and she lived in Merano \u2014 Merano. When we crossed the Italian border, this\nis where we went. And \u2014",

        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Oh yes, every day. I didn\u2019t live there, but I went to the camp.",
        "A: Well, there were little wooden houses. Now, Lucia, the one who called me now,\nshe lived there, in camp. Not bad. They had enough food. I have somewhere a\npicture wa \u2014 at the train station there. And I went every day because I taught the kids\nand Julian went because he had some patients there. It wasn\u2019t bad. I mean, it looks\nlike a \u2014 like a camp, but it was cleaner than most of the camps were, and the direc \u2014",
        "A: Where did they take money from?",
        "A: Everybody was talking about their experiences. This was the \u2014 the usual team of\ntalk. We couldn't talk about anything else.",
        "A: Yeah, they were mostly about six, seven, eight.",
        "A: Maybe hidden. I don\u2019t know. I didn't talk to the parents. They were nice kids.\nMaybe a little older. [indecipherable]",
        "A: No. Not to me. I taught piano. They were nice. So we left finally Germany, to\nmy joy and we went to Italy. And it \u2014 Italy, we didn't have money again, we tried to\nfind a place to stay, so we found a room on the eighth floor without an elevator, and\nI had the dog who had to go out three times a day. It didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t matter.\nJulian graduated medical school in Genoa. This was his second language, Italy.\nAnd he adored Italy. So, because he had an Italian diploma, he could practice\nmedicine there. So we f \u2014 we found a room in the old part of Genoa in the port of\nGenoa where he opened his office, so to speak. That\u2019s why I called him the king of\nthe horrors, he \u2014 we would go for a walk and from up every lantern came a greeting.\nAugust 15, 1998\nAnd I volunteered as his helper because we couldn\u2019t afford sa \u2014 to pay somebody.\nSo I would help him, but he wasn\u2019t pleased with me. You know, hi-his specialty was\nskin and venereal diseases. This goes together in Italy. So he asked me to volunte \u2014\nto stay by when he had a patient who had something that had to be burned on her\nskin. And I don\u2019t know whether you know what burning of skin smells like. I was\nstanding next to him and I was getting paler and paler. And he gave one look at me\nand he said, get out. I am firing you, you are not a good helper. So we stayed in\nItaly for five years. I learned Italian. In the meantime, my uncle couldn't stand it, the\none in New York. In 1947 he send me a ticket to come to New York for a visit. And\nI came on a Polish boat, because I couldn\u2019t speak English. I had a ball on that boat,\nit was lovely. I came here with a visa for three months, visitor\u2019s visa. I stayed with\nhim in Long Island where he had his house and I must say his wife was beautiful to\nme, she was such a lovely woman. I have never met her before. I have seen him\nbecause he used to come to Poland for a visit, yes, but I never knew his wife. And\nshe was very nice to me, very.",

He had a business on 24\" Street downtown, with\n\u2014 you know when they made \u201cThe King and I,\u201d he \u2014 he put all those rhinestones as\nstones on the costumes. This was his business. And he would take me down there to\nAugust 15, 1998\nhis workers and introduce me, he was very proud of me. And I stayed \u2014 and he\nwould hire \u2014 he hired a young woman teacher from Columbia University, who\ncame to my house every other day to give me a lesson in English. So after being\nthree months there, I had a ball. I traveled all over New York, I was in love with\nnew \u2014 I still am in love with New York. And then I had an uncle, my mother\u2019s \u2014 my\n\u2014my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s husband, who was a photographer in Yonkers. So I went\nthere and he went absolutely bananas with me. He \u2014 where is that other picture that\nis so beautiful I have to show you? He was taking me \u2014 my pictures constantly. And\nI would travel all over New York, and then my uncle got tired of living in Long\nIsland because he had to commute downtown, it was a little hard on him. He found\nan apartment on 96\" West, and I had a room overlooking Central Park, which was\nabsolutely beautiful. I stayed the three months, after three months my visa was about\nto expire. He said, I'll send a lawyer, I have a friend lawyer who will go with you to\nthe apart \u2014 department of \u2014 what is it?",
        "A: Yes, immigration department. Maybe you can get a \u2014 prolong \u2014 prolong your\nvisa. I come with that \u2014 at that time I spoke a little English already. I came to the\ndepartment and he starts, well she is sick and she has to have some medical\nattention, and I can see in the face of that man there that he doesn\u2019t believe a word\nAugust 15, 1998\nhe is saying, and I looked like a picture of health. So I said, excuse me, let me talk.\nAnd I said to the man, look, I am a survivor of the Holocaust. I finally came here\nand I have the time of my life, and I am totally in love with New York. I would like\nto stay another three months. I have a husband in Italy and I intend to go back.\nWithout another word, I got three more months in New York. Then I sent a\ntelegram to Julian, ar-arriving Ciampino Rome, TWA, this and this time. He gets\nthe [indecipherable] and he said he knows what is Ciampino Rome, but what the\ndevil is TWA? He couldn\u2019t figure it out. He came to Rome to wait for me and I\ncome out from the plane, I\u2019m very proud of myself, I had the new hat, with the\nfeather. And at that time they started to wear those shoes with the strap at the ankle,\nand I had those shoes. I was very proud of myself. I had the new suit. My other\nuncle, my \u2014 my father\u2019s older brother was in fur business on 28\" Street and he gave\nme a beautiful brown Persian coat, full length coat, beautiful. So I was very proud of\nmyself and I come out of the train and Julian gives one look at me, and he says, you\nhave to ta \u2014 change those shoes, you look like an Italian whore. Those were very\nhappy months for me, I really loved it. I wa \u2014 it was a love affair wi \u2014 between me\nand New York, a total love affair. I love New York. Very happy. And unfortunately\nhis wife later died, my uncle\u2019s wife. And he remarried another European woman. He\nAugust 15, 1998\nis dead by now. He was very good to me, very good. Like a \u2014 like a \u2014 he suffered\nbecause of loss of his brother. So that\u2019s my history.",
        "A: I come back to Italy, yes, and we waited for our immigration visa. And I said to\nmy husband, what will happen if they don\u2019t late \u2014 let the dog go to America? I\nmean, this can happen. Very seriously he said, then I won\u2019t go. He went to the\nAmerican embassy in Genoa. He got every shot given to the dog by the veterinarian\nthere, we got a pile of papers, we paid $50 for his \u2014 we \u2014 we came by boat here.

And the first thing Julian said, I want to\nsee the accommodations for th \u2014 my dog. So he went to the upper dock \u2014 deck and\nhe comes back and says, I am not going to put my dog there.

And we found there is, near Neptune, New Jersey is a small\nplace where they don\u2019t let cars on Sunday. And we found an Italian woman who\nrented the place to us, a\u2014 a room to us with the dog, and she didn't know we were\nJewish. And then after awhile I told her and she says, it doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t\nwant to park your car \u2014 you don\u2019t want to drive your car on Sunday here. It was very\nnice, very nice.

        "A: Because when I came out of hiding, I swore that I will never have a cha \u2014 a child,\nbecause I saw what children went through. I was totally discouraged to have any\nfamily. And then my brother-in-law, Julian\u2019s brother, who never had children,\nstarted writing letters to me begging me, if I can, to have a child. So I decided\nAugust 15, 1998\nmaybe I\u2019ll try it. Never regretted it, he was a wonderful boy. It was a good\nexperience. But, we stayed there and then Julian found a job in Grantsville, which\nis between Annapolis and Baltimore. A state hospital. And we lived there for six\nyears, in Grantsville. That was very happy years.",
        "A: No, no. No, he wa \u2014 since he took this \u2014 his state exam, he \u2014 he went to \u2014 to\npsychiatry. This was a psychiatric hospital where we lived.",

        "A: In Washington, D.C., yes. And then Julian, with time he became clinical\ndirector of Saint Elizabeth\u2019s hospital before he retired. And then we came to this\nhouse. And my son lives now in West Virginia. He is also in psychiatry. He goes in\nhis father\u2019s footsteps. He just directed a play. You know, we started a play \u2014-a-\u2014a-\u2014\na theater in Annapolis. Yes, we bought an old garage, we bought some chairs from\nan old movie house, and Julian directed the first play, which was Pygmalion. It was\nAugust 15, 1998\na smash hit.

        "A: Probably.",

Second, I think it gave me a certain insight into\nhuman s-suffering, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have known it. I led a very sheltered life as\na young girl, very sheltered. Good life. And I didn\u2019t know much about human\nsuffering. I learned a lot. So I \u2014I think \u2014 I think in this respect \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say that\nthe war was beneficial for me, it isn\u2019t beneficial to anybody. But I think that I gained\nmore understanding for people. For people suffering, especially. I hope so.",

I\u2014I am\nspecially very vulnerable if it comes to children suffering. And when I see, let\u2019s say\nin \u2014 in Yugoslavia, the children who are without food, without medication, I suffer.\nI do. Because I thought maybe \u2014 maybe we have filled out the \u2014 the suffering of\npeople. Maybe it\u2019s enough. But it isn\u2019t enough. It goes on and on and on. Why?\nEven \u2014 even this last [indecipherable] the bombs, that so many Americans have\ndied, and local people. Any crazy person can \u2014 you know, my father was a socialist\nand I used to discuss politics with him, and I \u2014 I was very angry at him because he\nsaid he doesn\u2019t believe in forming the state of Israel. And I said, why? He says,\nbecause the Arabs will never, never leave them alone. Very often when I hear the\nnews, I can see that he was right in many ways. But, look, we will always have wars.\nThere will be always crazy people who will try to do so much damage. We cannot\nhelp it. We are not responsible for everybody. I wish Julian would have lived\nlonger. I still feel that he didn't have any right to leave me alone. He never left me\nalone in 57 years. If it wouldn\u2019t have been for him, I wouldn\u2019t have survived the\nwar. I am sure of it. I didn't \u2014 I was very sheltered all my life. I didn\u2019t know how to\nAugust 15, 1998\ncope with it. And it was he who \u2014 who staged it, who arranged it. He was\nresponsible for everything, even after the war.

        "A: To some extent yes, but don\u2019t forget that he grew up, his first years were in the\ncountry, which was very nice. We had the nice community there, rather\ninternational. We had a doctor from Vienna, and we had a doctor from\nCzechoslovakia. We had a nice group of people.",

And I looked at him as he was standing at that trial\nand I was thinking, you know, he looked like a little Jewish man. Didn\u2019t he? It\u2019s\nfunny how it happens. But I was very glad they got him. Very. No pity.",
        "A: I know. I wouldn\u2019t live there if you give me millions. I don\u2019t buy anything that\u2019s\nmade in Germany. I used to tell my son, when you will be older, and you want to\nmarry somebody, you can marry anybody of any religion you want. But if you ever\nmarry a German, I will not know you. I resent them very greatly. Greatly. As a\nmatter of fact I had a friend who was a wife of a rabbi. She was a very dear friend of\nmine, she worked with my husband in the hospital here. And her daughter, the\nAugust 15, 1998\ndaughter of a rabbi went to Germany to study something and she met a German and\nshe married him. And she lives in Germany. And every time I saw her, I was\nthinking, how can she? How can she have any relationship with those people? I\ncannot. I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t do it. As a matter of fact, about 12 years ago\n[indecipherable] we went to Vienna and Budapest. Julian had some meeting in\nBudapest. When we were going to Vienna, he said to me, you will love Vienna.\nOh, you will absol \u2014 well, I hated it. Every time I was in Vienna and I had to listen\nto that German and I was thinking, this is the country that gave us Hitler, I couldn\u2019t\nstand it. I enjoyed Budapest very much, but not Vienna. A funny thing happened to\nus, we went to Jerusalem. There was a \u2014 Julian was supposed to read the paper,\nthere was a psychiatric meeting in Jerusalem, and he was reading a paper on \u2014 on\nthe war, something about the war. And we were sta \u2014 we were \u2014 we were staying at\nthe Hilton in Jerusalem and we met another couple. Very handsome man, who had\non a golden chain, a big letter chai. So you thought he was Jewish, yeah. He was a\nPresbyterians minister. And I still have a letter that his wife wrote to me. We\nbecame very friendly with this couple and we had one taxi, and the taxi driver drove\nus around. And I said to [indecipherable] how come you speak English so well? He\nsays to me, I am from Brooklyn. And we were \u2014 we s \u2014 we went to a kibbutz where\nwe spend the night. Was a nice kibbutz, well kept. And we went to Mosada(ph), of\nAugust 15, 1998\ncourse. And then we \u2014 we traveled to the ocean. Oh, we had a great time in\nJerusalem, I loved it. She came running to me, his wife, on a Friday and said, Lena,\nquickly, quickly, you have to get ready. I want to see the Jews dancing at the wailing\nwall.",
        "A: About what?",
        "A: I liked it very much, but \u2014 but I am not very optimistic about it \u2014 Israel. You\nknow, if they keep giving away \u2014 Israel is small, if they keep wanting more and\nmore from Israel, how long will they stay? I am \u2014 I am a little hesitant about\nNetanyahu, | don\u2019t know whether he is doing such a good job. But I love the\natmosphere. I felt very comfortable there. That \u2014",
        "A: Because it\u2019s such a relaxed atmosphere the Israelis have. With everything that\u2019s\ngoing around them, it\u2019s amazing that they can forget about it. Or maybe not forget,\nbut try to forget. It\u2019s beautiful.",
        "A: No-\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: You know, this is a very strange question that you ask me, and I\u2019Il tell you why.\nThere is a couple here, they\u2019re not Jewish, very nice couple who \u2014 whom I met at\nsome friend\u2019s house. And they probably thought \u2014 they knew somebody else who\nwas from Poland, also a survivor. So they thought that if they put me together with\nanother survivor, I will feel mu-much more relaxed and so on. And they invited me\nto dinner one time. And I went to dinner and there was the other woman. And I\ndidn't like her and she didn't like me, and I know it. So you never know. I \u2014 I get\nbeautifully along with Americans, I love Americans. I think \u2014 I don\u2019t have to have\npeople who \u2014 who went through everything, as I did. Course, we enjoy it. As I was\ntelling you that I went to see that family in the hospital with their gra \u2014 son-in-law.\nWell, the woman, the young woman was a public prosecutor in Poland. She was a\nlawyer by profession and she wanted to come to this country desperately. So, we\nwent together for the \u2014 you know, befo \u2014 it took five years for the amer \u2014 for the\nAmericans immigration office to give us a visa to come here. That\u2019s why I get so\nupset when I see that they let so many people in without \u2014 without really knowing\nanything about them. They x-rayed us, we went to Naples, we had to go through\nsome questions and well, the x-rayed showed \u2014 her x-rayed showed that she had a\ntiny spot on her lungs. Every doctor, including Julian gave her a statement that\nAugust 15, 1998\nthere\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with her lungs, they wouldn\u2019t let her in here. So\nshe went to Israel. And she became a lawyer there in Haifa. We visited her when\nwe were there. And a\u2014 but why do I say that? In connection with what? I don\u2019t\nknow. She passed away since then.",
        "A: She used to write to me.",
        "A: Oh \u2014 oh yes, he wrote the paper, yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "A: He met with all kinds of people. I wasn't involved in that, he didn't involve me in\nthat. But he did meet with the people who survived the sp \u2014 from the psychiatric\npoint of view, what \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 where they had left anything. Well, of course,\neverybody who survived that war has to be affected in some way or other. I mean,\nyou cannot be a normal person after surviving this. Like being hidden for 22 months\nwithout being able to say a word loud, or \u2014 or sneeze or cough. How can you be\nnormal? I mean normal, depending what you mean by normal. But that\u2019s very hard.\nAugust 15, 1998\nVery hard. I find that my \u2014 my attitude to people is completely different. I mistrust\npeople much more than I did when I was young. I didn't know anything about life.\nWell, here I am, at the end of my rope.",
        "A: Do I think more? Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, absolutely. Much more. I analyze much more. I would love to go once\nmore to my town.",
        "A: Never. Never. When I left Poland I swore I'll never come back.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Cause I\u2019m getting older. I think a \u2014 1t would be nice to see the old place. It was\nsuch a nice town. We didn't have any crime. Nothing ever happened. Only once a\nwoman, a Jewish woman divorced her husband and married somebody else. It was\nthe greatest scandal the town has ever heard of. It was a very peaceful life. Nice life,\nnice life.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Absolutely. I read Polish books. I like the Pope because he is Polish. Julian left\nquite a few Polish books, I didn\u2019t realize when I was looking through the books. So I\nstarted reading them. I didn't read them since I was 18 years old. Quite an\nexperience. At the beginning I thought [ll have a hard time, but 1t wasn\u2019t working\nthat way. It\u2019s nice.",
        "A: What language do I think? Mostly English, mostly English. When I am with my\nPolish friends we speak Polish, but \u2014",
        "A: Not Jewish. Non-Jewish.",
        "A: Yes, yes. As a matter of fact, I have some books which I want to give them. But I\nsp \u2014 I think mostly in English, yes. Became a habit.",
        "A: I personally don\u2019t. I have no reason, I have been saved by a Polish woman. I\ndon\u2019t think we would have survived the war without her. Whether she did it \u2014 she\nAugust 15, 1998\ndidn\u2019t do it for money. Why she did it, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m grateful to her. So\nthat\u2019s why I take care of her grandson.",
        "A: No. No. I know people get it from Switzerland. First of all, I don\u2019t know\nwhether my parents had any account. No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t need that money. I \u2014 I have\ntwo granddaughters and I hope they will never know what it means to go through a\nwar. It\u2019s devastating. I often think about it. But I had a good husband and he was \u2014\nhe pulled me through it. I would have never survived without him. First of all, I\nwould have gone with my father, and second, I didn't know how to do it. He was \u2014\nhe was the one who arranged everything for me, yeah. Strange. I never thought\nwhen I was young that I will go through such a war. What makes one crazy man do\nthings? And they were \u2014 there were some very bright, intelligent people in his group\nwho followed him. That is the tragic thing. When I read the story of \u2014 what was the\nname of his \u2014 his main \u2014 like here it, 1t was the \u2014 the forces, the \u2014 his for \u2014 he \u2014\nRommel. He was a bright, intelligent man, but he was caught. He was caught. There\nwere more men like that. This is \u2014 this is tho \u2014 though it\u2019s not an explanation why\npeople followed him. So you work for the memorial hospital \u2014 for the Holocaust\nMuseum? Pardon me.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, my son asked me would we sp \u2014 would \u2014 at that time Julian was with me.\nAnd we spoke to her class, which was the \u2014 this \u2014 you know, she is now 13, but\nmust have been \u2014 maybe she was eight, something like that. And then they ask us in\nthat school would we speak to the older kids, and we did. And I was amazed, really\namazed at the attention they gave us. And the questions they ask us, they were very\nbright questions. Especially about the \u2014 the part where we described in what\nconditions we were hidden. Very bright.",
        "A: Well, he wanted us to talk to them. The principal was curious and he wanted us\nto talk to them, and I \u2014 I thought it was \u2014 be very interesting for kids to know what\npeople go through, and they still live a normal life. And he even ask me this year too\nto talk to, but I didn\u2019t, because I didn\u2019t feel up to it, but maybe I \u2014 I'll do it, if he\nasks me again.\nAugust 15, 1998",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Since we came to this country, I feel that we have led a very\nnormal life, yes. I am happy.",
        "A: Yes and no. I am quite critical about the president, you know. And \u2014 but yes, I\nam, I am. I like this country. I\u2019m very happy here, and I often think of my father, he\nloved this country. The lower east side of New York. He loved it. My mother had\nanother sister who was a very active with a Jewish newspaper here in New York, is\nit Forward\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah. Yes. But she passed away. She lived there, downtown New York. I used to\nvisit her quite often. So that\u2019s my life history.",
        "A: What else to say to you? You know, my son, when he was 20 years old and was\nin medical school, he fell in love with a very lovely Jewish girl. And I \u2014 I thought\nthey were a little bit too young to marry, but he insisted \u2014 they were both 20 \u2014 he\ninsisted they get married. They got married, they had a little apartment near GW\nwhere he was going to medical school. And I thought everything was beautiful until\nabout maybe six or seven months after they got married, he ask us to come over and\nwe did. And she was sitting next to the window, and I says, what is it sweetheart?\nAugust 15, 1998\nMaybe we come here maybe too often, I thought, maybe it\u2019s too much for her. She\nsays no, you know, I love you, but I just don\u2019t want to be married any more. And it\nwas a terrific blow to him, really bad. She was the one who got the divorce and as\nfar as I know, to this day she didn\u2019t remarry. So then he met this girl, and she\u2019s not\nJewish. And he married her, and seem like a good marriage. She works for the\nWorld Bank. She\u2019s a good mother. I would have preferred marry a Jewish girl, but\nwho am I to say something? And he seems to be working out very nicely. He took\nover the psychiatric division of the hospital in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and he\ndirected now a play in the theater, he goes in his father\u2019s footsteps. And he wants me\nto move there. So I don\u2019t know what life will bring, whatever it is. And I think it\u2019s\nvery nice of you to sit here and listen to me for such a long time. You must be\nexhausted.",
