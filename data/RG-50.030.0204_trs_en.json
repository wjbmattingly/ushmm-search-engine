        "A: ... that's a small place, small town...uh...near what was at that time before the first world\nwar...uh...the Austrian/Russian boarder because that part of Poland was...uh...in the\nAustria...Austria...I think they called it Austria/Hungarian empire. Austria/Hungarian I\ndon't know how...how you would say that in English really. Uh...And the grandparents\nalso came from very close to that place. They lived there til the outbreak of the first world\nwar, 1914, when my father was indoctrinated into the Austrian Army and\nMother...uh...who at that time was pregnant with my older sister, Leah and we called her\nTont...uh...fled from that area...took her mother along by the name of Freda\nand...uh...fled to Vienna. My oldest sister was born on the way in Hungary. Uh...Ever\nsince then until they had to escape from Vienna after the Nazis came in in 1938,...uh... we\nlived...we lived in Vienna. As a matter of fact, as far as I know we lived in the same\nhouse until the last 2 or 3 months of 1938.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me...uh...please a little bit about your father's occupation. What did he do?",
        "A: After my father was demobilized from the army...uh...he... uh... built up a...uh... wine\nbusiness and over a period of 20 years he built it into a very substantial wine wholesale\nbusiness. Uh...finally, we had...uh...large cellars in the...I think it was in the 18th District\nin \u2019\u2019I....1 remember the place very well. It is a magnificent large court yard with chestnut\ntrees...uh...three offices...uh...and extensive underground cellars. At least I was very\nimpressive by the fact that they were...uh....uh...barrels of wine higher than I was, which\nwasn't very difficult. I wasn't very tall at the time, but they were about the height of a\nman. And...uh...there were rows and rows of them. And there was an escalator going\ndown...uh...along which I guess they were transferring the barrels into bottles and so on\nand so forth. And he supplied mainly restaurants and hotels. Some of the wine we also\nimported from other countries, like Yugoslavia and I expect Hungary and so on. Uh...",
        "Q: You as a child! Tell me a little bit about your childhood. Did you go to school? Did you\nhave friends?",
        "A: Yes. Well, uh...first of all, what I...I have to say something in general about the nature of\nmy memories. Uh...the Nazi period stretches across...uh...the landscape of my memories\nof my mind almost like a Chinese war. You can...there are chinks here and there. You can\nlook through them. You can catch a glimpse of some of the things that happened beyond\nthe war...before it, but...uh...this...this huge war has cast a long shadow, both backwards\nand forwards, and really dominates the landscape. But I do remember some of the things.\nUh...We were substantially a middle class family. As I say, we always lived in the same\nhouse in which really means a street of front gardens. Each apartment house had little\nfront gardens. I remember vividly these were beautiful gardens with...uh...flower\nbeds...uh...carnations, forget me naught, roses...uh...and huge lilies. This was lilies I\nbelieve. Uh...The house itself...uh...uh...was really properly built. You know, in...1n\nVienna, you had houses that were built for centuries...uh...marble and...and brass\nand...and oak to us and so on and so forth, absolutely beautifully fitted out. Uh...At first\nwe lived on the third floor and then we moved down stairs to a mezzanine, which is a\nkind of half floor. It's almost on the level of the second floor as they would call it here\nbecause the ground floor is called the first floor in...1n...1n America. Uh...We always had\nas far...as long as I remember it any way, live in maids. These were generally girls who\ncame from the country and...uh...Mother...uh... was a very...uh... friendly and\ncompassionate person. She was always... always busy in the house, mainly on cooking\nwhich was at that time a task that...that took up a good part of the day. Uh...The house\nwas sparkling. Uh... was a bookworm. I remember lying on my belly on the floor and\nseeing my reflection in the linoleum. Uh...I was lost in books. Uh...But I also had friends\nout in the streets and...uh...used to play...uh...kicking the ball around and playing with\nthose little marbles which at that time were clay, glossy clay balls. As a matter of fact,\nsome were glass, but I liked the clay better because they were so beautifully colored.\nUh...I do remember vividly. Now before...before I come to the elementary school, I want\nto say that there were two...uh...facts that I vividly recall. First of all, I had a rather strict\nfather. And that was very much in accordance with the fashion of the times. These were\npatriotic figures. And I loved him very much. I remember the intense joy that I had when\nI heard the... his key grating in the lock. I knew it was my father's key. And I knew more\nor less what time he would come home. Mother was a very affectionate woman. I am\nafraid that she...uh...she spoiled me. She was over-protective. She was always hovering\nover me when I was eating. The side effect, of course, was that I became the worst eater\nin Europe. I mean it just came to a point that I couldn't even look at a cup of coffee or\nmilk or whatever and not feel sick. I was a very, very bad eater. Yal. So that...that...that\nwas...that was a strong memory. Uh...Somehow...uh...I was very much of a dreamer.\nBooks were my world of escape. And I managed to enter this world and close the door\nbehind me and live in it for a long time. Elementary school was just around the corner.\nUh...Well around the corner. It was in a part of the street called, oddly enough, means\nbeautiful street. It wasn't nothing very beautiful about that street, but the elementary\nschool was called at the time. And I remember the first...I was a person...uh...not very\nindependent, probably as a result of the kind of education of the upbringing. As I said, I\nwas over-protected, and...uh...1t was difficult for me to separate myself from home and go\nto school in the first place. But...uh...I remember vividly on one of the first days, the\nprincipal of the school, I remember the name of Pakoni lifted me on to his knee and I can\nsee his friendly face. He was a person of Czech extraction, I believe. Uh...so he spoke a\nperfect German. I suspect that he might even have been born in Vienna. But, of course,\nyou know, the Austrian empire at the time incorporated...uh... No, it had incorporated. At\nthat time when I was born and Czechoslavakia was already an independent country. But\nbefore that it was part of the empire. Uh...So he took me on his knee and he asked me\nwhom I loved more, my mother or him. I was intensely embarrassed. I'm telling this story\nto show that...uh...uh... Vienna was a place of mixed emotions for me. Anti-Semitism was\nendemic in Vienna but there were loving persons, of course. There were individuals who\nand I did experience affection and love from some of them. As a matter of fact, when he\nasked me this question, the door opened and Mother came in. (Laughter) So that just adds\nto my embarrassment. (Laughter) I don't know how I wiggled out of that one.\nSubsequently, we had a...a teacher by the name of Kanote. Uh...and...uh...she also singled\nme out as...uh...I guess I am...I am really sorry to say as one of her preferred students\nbecause I don't like this whole business of really singling out anybody. I am today for\ninstance Professor at Rutgers University and...uh.... am very much guided by...uh...maybe\nthis experience and others that...uh...that I just like all my students. I like all the kids\nthere. Uh...But in any case, she had...she had the Jewish pets and the Gentile pets. I was\nthe Jewish. The Gentile was a fellow by the name of who 1s the son of policeman. I\nremember all these things so..so..so vividly. Uh...The reason I mention this again was to\nshow you a little bit of the atmosphere there. Uh...And I remember one occasion\nwhen...uh...she would sometimes go out because I think that...uh...she had a bit of a flirt\ngoing with a...with another teacher by the name of Flashman in the class. And she asked\nme to monitor the class. And as soon as she left, the class broke out into some kind of\nrowdy behavior and I immediately was able somehow to control that and what I learned\nabout myself instinctively, you know, and I only recall this on reflection now...was that\nin....in times of tension and so, I seemed to have...to...to psychologically understand ways\nof controlling myself, of being in...1n complete possession of myself and consequently of\nthe situation and it was something that stood me in good stead when the Nazis came in.\nUh...",
        "Q: Let's talk about that.",
        "A: Right...Well..",
        "Q: When the Nazis came in.",
        "A: Yes. At that time...uh...that was, of course, I believe...uh... the date was the 11th of\nMarch, 1938. And...uh...We had at that time a live-in maid by the name of Fritzi\nShumberger. The reason I mention her was she did play a little bit of a role afterwards\nand also she had a little emblem on her lapel. It was . It was...uh...in the shape of a boot,\nand subsequently we learned that it was the emblem of the leading Nazis. I say illegal\nbecause before the Nazis marched in, the Nazi party was not legal in Austria. However,\npersonally, she was not...uh...hostile to us and I don't think that she behaved badly when\nall is said and done. Uh...I do remember the speech of Shoosnick who was at that time\nChancellor, \u201d Chancellor.",
        "Q: Where were you?",
        "A: I was...I was in that apartment...1n our apartment in 186 204. That was the first apartment\non the left side...uh...as you came into the house and stepped up quite a number of steps.\nUh...And I listed to...uh...his speech and do...do recall...uh...some of the words he said. I\nbelieve he said To the death with red, white red, which is the color of the Austrian flag.\nRed, white, red. Uh...At least my memory tells me that he said the things that he said.\nAnd...uh...Fritzi Shumberger, that maid, and my brother next to me (clearing throat)\nExcuse me. Guess I'll have to drink something.",
        "Q: That's fine.",
        "A: (Drinking water) Uh...My brother Leo. He was the next oldest. I was the youngest in a\nfamily of four which was also was a kind of situation that...uh...had me on my guard most\nof the time. And...and what separated me from the next one was a period of 6 years, very\nsubstantial. But the other three...uh...were only separated in terms of 2 years and there\nwas... So really there were two families. It was they and I. I always regarded myself as an\noutsider and I expect it was because of that large separation of time. Anyway, Leo was\nthere and Fritzi and she said something, \"Oh wonderful and so on and so forth.\"\nUh...Because obviously, I think she was going out with somebody who was a Nazi and\nthey...they were very joyful about Hitler coming in. As a matter of fact, many Austrians\nwere....uh...",
        "Q: Excuse me. I'm confused. Who was joyful.",
        "A: Fritzi Shumberger, our... our maid was very joyful about it and many Austrians were. In\nany case...uh...and my brother remarked...he made some kind of...uh...negative remark\nabout it, saying that...uh...,you know, there may not be that much reason to be happy.\n[...In any case...I do...I do remember that. I also remember the next day looking out. First\nof all, there were...there were bombers going...coming overhead. Hugh,\nhugh...uh...machines, droning and very low, almost...uh...scraping the...the...the tops...the\ntops of the houses. Black, black planes. They looked black to me or maybe that's just a\npsychological memory. Uh...And every house was draped with a spastic of flags. Every\nhouse! And these were hugh flags. I am talking about apartment houses, five floors. And\nthese were flags that...that went from the roof right almost down to the...to the sidewalk\nand I should imagine that...uh...there was a very active, highly organized Nazi\nunderground movement. And they distributed all these these flags over night. Also, there\nwere many Nazis in all the houses. There was a substantial proportion of Austrians and\nNazis. Austria has always...uh... managed to portray itself only as the victim and I have to\nsay most emphatically...and I don't want to be unjust to the many people in Austria who\nwere good people and kind people...but there was a large population of haters in Austria.\nAnd I don't think there was a single country in the world that embraced Hitler so\nfervently as the Austrian nation. And those of us who were there know it, experienced it.\nUh...I do remember that...uh...somehow or other I managed to either to allow my mother\nto go out or slip...I probably slipped out. And I went pretty far afield because I found\nmyself...uh...and this was probably not on the first week. It was probably some weeks\nafter the entry. But it was a time when...when Hitler...uh...was...uh...uh...going around in\na procession. I remember him...I remember him standing in a motor car, standing upright.\nIt was an open...uh... car. And the sidewalks were thronged with people. I mean there was\njust one mass of people all waving and shouting and...and...and jubilant. Uh...There was\nan ecstasy of joy. And I was standing there very quietly observing this. Uh...At that\ntime...uh...people who knew you before suddenly didn't know you. (Clearing throat) In\nour apartment house, we had...uh...there were quite a number of Jewish families in our\napartment house. Uh...There were not many Gentile families, but I think... There were\nprobably...it was probably half half. There might have been three or four...of two I know\ndefinitely that they were Nazis. Uh...One was called Garla, and he will appear later on\nbecause he tried to blackmail my father and caused his arrest. Uh...and the other one was\nSargi, and this Sargi, you know, there was this special story there because they are...there\nwas daughter and two sons. The two sons had been friends of my brothers. But the\nfriendship, I think had already more or less fizzled out...uh...uh...maybe a year or two\nbefore the Nazis came, but...uh...actually entered, but obviously, it was probably on the\nside of their becoming Nazis. One was called Franz and the other Willi. Willi Sargi\nbecame an SS man, and Franz Sargi became an SR man. Uh...And it's...they...they never\npersonally undertook any action against us, these people. And as a matter of fact, the\ndaughter...I don't know her name...who was working...uh...as probably some secretary in\nthe police headquarters, local police headquarters, was helpful to my mother.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: I don't recall the exact circumstances. I think it probably was...it might have been\nconnected with the arrest of my father. I am going to talk about it a little later on. But I\nknow that my mother went...uh...to her and I seem to remember that when she came back\nthat she said some nice things about...about her. But I don't remember the exact\ncircumstances. I wasn't even told exactly what happened at that time. Uh...If I can stop a\nmoment here because I have a sense that there was something happening...",
        "Q: Can you hold...hold the tape a minute? Is that what you what you would like to do. H",
        "A: Yal.",
        "Q: Can you stop the tape a minute. Tell me when it's on Bonnie. Okay.",
        "A: One of the things that...that I remember vividly...uh...was, of course, the fact\nthat...uh...shortly after...uh...the annexation...uh...we had to stay there. And there was\na...some obvious peculiar about celebrating festival of freedom of liberation. And I do\nremember my father sitting there at the table and saying...uh...that he really didn't have\nthe heart to do it. But we decided that we do it anyway. And I...] am sure it was the\nhardest and most difficult that we ever had. Just because it is a festival of liberation,\nand...uh...I don't need to tell you how we felt at that time. Uh...One of the...I had\nmentioned...I had mentioned...uh...Incidently I mentioned Willi Sargi, and I just want to\nadd to this that...and it's strange how sometimes little things...uh...become memories\nthat...that stand out way and beyond the significance. Because my...my sister, Leah, and\nwe actually always called her Toni for some reason so I am going to refer to her as Toni.\nUh...She had managed to blot out most of the things that happened at the time, but one\nthing she...she remembers vividly and she's told me about it two or three times. I mean\nwhenever she mentions that, I can feel it...the strong emotions tied up with it, and it's a\nlittle thing. She remembers herself walking into the house one day and Willi Sarg,\nthat...that fellow who had been friends of...uh...my family, of my brothers and possibly\nher too, was walking ahead and he opened the door and he closed it right in her face. It's\nsuch a little thing, but it will live with her as long as she lives. And so I say memories are\nstrange things because so many more horrendous things happened afterwards. Uh...At\nthat time, I was going to...the \u201d * gymnasium. That was a Jewish High School. A very,\nvery good high school. One of the two best in Vienna. Uh...And they had a very\nselect...uh...cadre of...uh... teachers. One of them was a pretty woman poetist and...uh...,\nof course, at that time, you know, the curriculum and the standards of education are very\nhigh. That school closed its door in... after I graduated...uh... in 1938. It closed its door\nfor good for over 50 years. I think they only recently reopened again, last year or so I\nthink I've heard. And I remember that...uh...when we...uh... left...uh.. on the last day of\nschool...uh...and there was a group of boys waiting outside to beat us up, but...uh...that\nwas...that was the gymnasium. Uh...I had two brothers...uh...the oldest by the name of\nGabe. He left for the United States...uh... early in 1938. He missed most of the...uh... Nazi\nperiod. I think he left...uh...uh...1n the early summer, late spring or early summer.",
        "Q: How did he get out?",
        "A: We have...a part of my mother's family is American...had settled in America...uh...a\ngeneration or two ago. And they sent us affidavits and...uh...Gabe was the first one able\nto make use of it. So he went straight...uh...you know, as a important little passenger on\nthe ship, he could close the door and luckily he missed...uh... most of the terrible\nthings...uh...that happened afterwards.",
        "Q: Why did the rest of you not go with him?",
        "A: Well, ...uh...it took time. Affidavits, you know, affidavits, the processing and\neverything...uh...wasn't such a simple and easy matter. It took...uh...i1t took father almost a\nyear...uh...to get out...uh...for instance. Uh...Leo...Leo was the second one who left,\nbut...but his...uh...exodus was fraught with difficulties. In the first place, in summer he\ntried to escape over the border into France and he went with a friend by the name of .\nAnd...uh...he was caught by the French police and returned. And...uh...since...since my\nbrother was...he was a very handsome fellow and quite a personality I would say...uh...\nHe had no difficulty with the German border police and there were some SR SS men\nthere. Uh...He had no problem whatsoever and they just let him go. Yal. And he returned\nto Vienna. And I...I still remember him coming up the street. I happened to be outside,\nand he was tanned and he...he...he looked so wonderful, like somebody who came from\nthe mountain already or something like that. Uh...Shortly after that, he...uh...he went\nagain. He escaped by Italy and by illegal ship...uh...to Palestine. So he got into Palestine,\nit was probably late summer of 1938, and when war broke out...uh... early in 1940 in\nGermany he volunteered. And he fought through all the campaigns...uh...so...uh...1n\nNorth Africa and...uh... practically the whole length of Italy.",
        "Q: With which army?",
        "A: He was...uh...with the British army, the RASC. I think he was first in the Palestine corps.\nThere was...there was, in fact,...he was involved in a very significant rescue mission of\nJews...uh...in northern Italy who were held captive by the Gestapo and...uh...the group\nof...uh...Jewish soldiers...uh... I don't know that they were in command of the whole\ngroup or only of that particular transport of that particular truck...uh...crossed-through the\nGerman border at the time and there was only a local armistice, a local armistice between\nthe commanders and the Germans were still armed. And they went right up to that\nparticular headquarter, and the Gestapo had fled at that time. And they took all over a 100\nJews back to...to Rome. I have to say, however, that my brother told me about this only\nonce and that is when I saw him for the first time in 1953. Uh...That is...uh... practically\n15 years after...uh...the Nazi invasion or Nazi annexation out of Austria. And we had a\nlong talk in Israel. He told me once about it and never talked about it again and...uh...now\nthat I have a chance, I am going to try to get historical documentation because my brother\nwas...uh... a rather quiet and extremely restrained sort of person and he...he's never\nmentioned it again. And I think it was a significant...was a very significant...uh... episode.\nAs a matter of fact he told me that when they came back to Rome, he formed...uh... the\nAmerican Army and said that he instructions from British Headquarters that here was a\ngroup of people who had to be taken care of and...uh...they...they were obviously people\nin very poor condition of health. Yal. So he surrended them...he surrended them to...to the\nAmericans and he said to them when...when they first arrived and the Jews saw them,\nsomething fell underneath and said they were angels. ....school. My parents registered\nme in a...in a training course for carpenters. There were a number of different (clearing\nthroat) vocational courses being given under the auspices of...uh...the Coltis Commander,\nwhich was the Jewish...uh...uh...organization, the Organization of Jewry in Vienna. And I\nguess the idea was (a) since I would have to leave and they tried to send me out as early\npossible because obviously every day was..uh...I was threatened there...uh...to get me out\nof harm's way, to get me away from the apartment which was a trap and also to give\nsome qualifications, some sort of another. And...uh... I remember...and I am going a little\nahead and I will afterwards go backward, but I am going a little ahead of time because I\nremember on the day of the Kristallnacht which I believed was the 9th to the 11th of\nNovember, 1938. I was in that carpentry workshop and there was a call on the telephone\nand the manager of the shop...uh... went to the phone and listened very seriously and then\nhe turned to us and said, \"There is some action on the way and you will be safer at\nhome.\" I am going to talk abut this in detail a little later on because there was lots of\nthings that happened in between. And I want to talk about them now. Uh...First of\nall,...uh...a... a number of times...uh...the Nazis came to our place, to our apartment. They\ncame to our apartment. They weren't exactly break-ins, but they weren't exactly visits\neither because these people came and..uh... they didn't bother to ring the bell or knock on\nthe door. They...they generally beat on the door with their boats so we knew exactly what\nkind of gentlemen were waiting out there.",
        "Q: Do you need some water?",
        "A: Yes. Please.",
        "Q: I must really sound very hoarse here.",
        "A: That's fine. Take your time. Take some water.",
        "Q: Uh...I remember a number of these occasions. I think I happened to have been present at\npractically every one of them cause I was mostly at home except when I was in that\ncarpentry workshop later on. Uh...On one occasion they came and...uh...they asked for\nmy father. And my father was a very sick man at that time. At the sight of what\nhappened...uh...Of course, as I said, the business was Aryonized. He lost the business\nand, consequently, in his mind he lost the...uh...the very reason for existence. He lost the\nstructure of his life. Uh...He...uh...became so sick that every day he had attacks that he\nsimply...uh... fell unconscious. He became unconscious. I remember he did the blood\ndrained from his face. His face became ashen. He sank back and for about 10, 15 minutes\nhe was as if dead. And then he always recovered. And that happened day after day, day\nafter day, day after day. Yal. You can imagine what kind of impact it had on me. At least\nit's difficult to imagine, really difficult to imagine. Uh...I later on, I subsequently learned\n(clearing throat) from a sister that these were epileptic attacks. He had developed\nepilepsy. I didn't even know that at the time. Uh...his...hair, which had always been\nblond, turned gray in a week. So, and he had always had heart trouble and so on. So when\nthe Nazis came on one occasions, this was , I heard my mother say, \"Why don't you take\nme. He's a...he's a very sick man. He has a very sick heart. Why don't you take me\ninstead?\" And the Nazi looked at her. There were two of them. And one said, you know,\n\"Lock your door. We are going to say that nobody is home. And don't open for anybody.\"\nAnd they left. On another occasion, and I am mentioning the little...the little visit at first.\nOn another occasion...uh...they came and they asked for...1f there were any males around,\nany men. I was the only one. And...uh...I always looked about 5 years younger. That was\nas a result of eating so badly I guess. And it was really what saved me from the\nconcentration camp. (Clearing throat) Because he looked at me and he thought I was\nabout 10, and I was really 14. (Laughter) He didn't even bother to say anything. He just\nturned around. It's like...uh...throwing a little fish back, you know, and left. That was the\nsecond visit. The third one, and I don't know whether I have the order correctly because\nmemories are strange. You remember things vividly, but you don't always remember the\norder in which they happened. Uh...About at least 3 or 4, this SR man came to our\napartment in and I remember at that time, this...this must have been before mid-summer\nbecause I was still in school. I remember I was in school because I had visited a friend by\nthe name of Amile Krueger. He was a genius in mathematics and I was excellent in Latin,\nthe Classics and Literature, so we used to help each other. And I was visiting his place\nand came home and as I knocked on the door, either the moment I knocked on the door or\njust a little before I heard noises in the apartment and knew they were not noises from my\nfamily. I still remember I was rooted by fear, and I had an immediate impulse for flight.\nBut whether it was solidarity or fear or whatever it was or the swiftness with which things\nhappen, I didn't turn...turn away, and the door opened and instead of my mother, there\nwas this giant man. And I was pulled in somehow...uh...and there was my father, mother\nand myself. My sister was married at the time and she had a separate apartment, not too\nfar from us. And there was Fritzi Shaumberger, our maid, and they made us stand against\nthe wall. I was in the which 1s...uh...the...uh..the foyer, the lobby, you know. It's a sort of\nL shape, very long L shaped room. They made us stand against the wall by the corner\nwindow and one of them shouted, Where's the gold? Where've you hidden the gold?\"\nThese were very primitive people. Yal. They must have thought we were Fort Knox or\nsomething. I mean, gold. I know my mother had a wedding ring, but...uh...hidden gold,\nburied it. Uh...My father said, \"We have no gold.\" So they stood us against the wall. They\ntook out their pistols and they put the pistol on our chest. It was father, mother and\nmyself. And father said to them...and Fritzi Shumberger, the maid, was standing in the\ndoorway of the kitchen and watching... What could she do really? And father said, \"Why\ndon't you shoot us?\" And I am quoting almost verbatim. He said, \"I'd rather you shoot us\nstraight away than have this insult and...uh...indignity, you know, without end.\" And\nactually that...that...that...uh...brings up another memory in my mind. They didn't shoot\nus. Uh...They...at that time apparently didn't have the authority to do that. Or possibly\nthey were still after the gold and you can't get gold from dead Jews, whatever the case\nmay be. And they took my father away. They took him to our business. At that time it\nwas still in our possession in the district, and my brother, Leo, was still there at the time.\nAnd I remember Leo had some money somewhere on an inside pocket, but he said he had\nno money. You see we needed that money desperately because...uh...there was no\nbusiness anymore and we knew that without money, we won't be able to get out.\nSo...uh...they didn't find the money on him. We were always walking on a tight rope. Yal.\nWhether the arrested father at the time or not, I do not know. I know Father was arrested\nat least twice. But...uh...my mother and I were locked into the kitchen after they left. And\nthey left this SR man to guard us. This marshall of people, you know, these heroic\nfigures, the Aryonrosher...superman in their imagination. I had learned to be\ncontemptuous of anti-Semites and I will come back to this...uh...afterwards, but in any\ncase, I was a very, restless, impatient sort of person and I had inherited a little bit of the\ntemper from my father. And all the time that temper was rising within me and remember\nI was a book worm. It was never clear when I left the world of reality and walked over\ninto a world of imagination. Yal. In the world of imagination, I was just a I mean I...So\neventually, I got so fed up, I got so angry in the kitchen I said to my mother, \"I have to do\nhomework and they prevent me from doing the homework and I am going\nto...to...uh...take them to task over this.\" And I don't know if my mother tried to restrain\nme, but, you know, what could she do. I went out and I confronted this Nazi and said,\n\"You know that I am supposed to do my homework. I am supposed to bring it in\ntomorrow and if I can't do it because of you, you will come with me tomorrow and you\nwill come to the teacher. Yal. And you tell her whose responsible for this. Yal.\" He didn't\nknow how to cope with this. And...and this is where my memory ends. I really do not\nknow what happened, you know. He didn't beat me up. That is for sure because I would\nhave remembered that. Yal. But whether I was allowed to do the homework or whether\nthey pushed me inside again or what, I...I do not recall. That...that was one visit. Uh...Our\nflat...our apartment was...was broken in on another occasion. We don't know who did it. I\nshould imagine it was done really by so-called \u2019\u2019in courte officials because...uh...the\napartment was sealed by the Nazis. And...uh...",
        "Q: What do you mean it was sealed.",
        "A: It was sealed. Sealed by Gestapos. We were not allowed to enter again. It was just sealed.\nIt was put under seal, lock and seal.",
        "Q: Where did you go to live.",
        "A: I...1...I'll tell you that. Probably...Actually...we actually went to our sister. If my sister\nhadn't been there, well, I guess we still had a...I still had a aunt. They had a very small\napartment. But we...we lived with our sister for the...for the last 2 or 3 months...uh...\nUh...What happened there was that I had...whatever money we had left... don't know\nwhether at that time we had already lost the business or not, but in any case, there was\nlittle business and people wouldn't pay us anyway even if we supplied. Uh...So we had no\nmoney coming 1n and so we had a substantial business but you know as a businessman,\nwe weren't that rich. We had some money left to pay for expenses to move out or what,\nbut whatever money we had left was our lifeline for escape. And I had become extremely\nadept at hiding things and at finding things. And the reason why I had become adept was\nthat, as I told you, I was a book worm and I would read through libraries. I mean literally\nshelf after shelf cause I remember my mother would take me to a worker's library 1n this,\nI believe they called them, you know. The Social Democrats built wonderful apartment\nbuildings in Vienna. They...they become quite well renowned. And they had libraries\nthere and health clinics and...uh...kindergarten and gardens inside. It was really a splendid\nworld. Yal. And they had these libraries, and my mother would take me there and for me\nthis was a paradise. And actually as I remember, they were really little rooms, but the\nglorious thing was there was these bookcases and they were stacked with books from the\nfloor to the ceiling and I knew that each book was a world. And it just entranced me. Yall.\nAnd I would read indiscriminately, but they were mostly good books. They were...at\nhome also we had, our saloon was stacked. We had all the classics. At that time we had\npaperbacks also the crown books they were called. That was before the Penguins. And I\nknew all the classics and I knew the Russians and the French, the dossiers and all these\npeople. But my mother used to hide books from me that were classics even because they\nwere too serious. For instance,...uh...and what an innocent world it was at the time, for\ninstance...uh...and , Crime and Punishment. I am mentioning this because it later on plays\nactually a role. However, there was no place they could hide a book that I didn't find.\nAnd...uh...the most peculiar place that my mother found was the stove pipe, you know, in\nthe saloon and I found that too because I always...I put myself in her place. Now\nwhere...where would I hide something. A book...a book isn't such a small object you see.\nSo I became extremely skilled in nosing out things, where they might be hidden, and\nhiding things. And I was the person consequently selected...you see how negative\nqualities become virtues in a world that's gone crazy...to hide whatever money we had\nleft. And what I did, and that was just before our apartment was ransacked and sealed,\nwas...uh...we had these brass beds which had hollow legs and you could unscrew\nthe...uh...the wheels. So I stuffed some money up there in the legs and then we had\ncurtain rods that were also brass. Hugh things! And I stuffed some money there. Actually,\nyou could only get them out with very, very long thin stick. Yal. The Nazis, however,\nwho were never book worms, never learned...uh...to learn to look..to look for things\n(laughter), you know, in those little hollow hiding places. And they never found the\nmoney. Now, then the apartment, after the apartment was sealed, and we were\nordered...and we had no money... Yal. We were literally penniless. So one day, Mother\ntook me to the Gestapo headquarters...Central City...It was in the hotel. I forgotten the\nname of the hotel. And I want to explain to you exactly what happened because I vividly\nremember every moment of it. And, of course, she had me by the arm, you know, and we\nwalked in and there was this...this splendid lobby. And there were people standing\naround. I don't whether they wore uniforms or not, but there were people in there. It was\na lovely place, and there was a spiral staircase to the right and at the foot of the staircase\nwas a Soldier. I believe he was a soldier and not a SR man. He might have been a SR\nman, but I seemed to remember he was a soldier. (Clearing throat) Sorry. And he had a\nrifle there with a bayonet, a naked bayonet planted in...uh...the...uh...what you call\nthat?...the...uh... on top of the rifle planted there. And as we came in, he jumped mother\nand he saw a woman with...with a child there and he immediately decided we're Jewish\nand he shot at something like . They used this expression. It's like 1s like sow. It's a\nfemale pig, you know. And they combined it with...with the term Jew. And for them that\nwas the way to call us. And he...he...he advanced the rifle into a ready position and that's\nanother heroic measure...here's a woman with a child. Yal. And he made some kind of\nthreatening movement, and my mother brushed by him as if he didn't exist. Yal. Totally\nignored him. And he was an attack dog who...who had not been instructed how to deal\nwith a situation like that. And this is what happened sometimes 1n those situations. If you\nwere really plucky or if you were desperate to the point that you didn't\ncare...uh...sometimes you overwhelmed them. Sometimes. But you had to have some\npresence in that control. As I said something that I learned in school early. However, it\ndidn't stand...it didn't help me in this situation because when we came in I was so\nembarrassed. It was, of course, a mixture of embarrassment and fear, but I honestly think\nit was about 90 percent or 80 percent embarrassment. I was a very shy youngster, and\nhere everybody was looking at us. And I was pulling at my mother's arms...let's get out of\nhere, you know. I was so ashamed. Yal. Just to be in the center of attraction, even if it\nhadn't been for...even it had been for purposes. But my mother let me go. I ran out of the\nhotel, but I was sufficiently able to see her, to watch her go up the staircase. Well, my\nmother came out of this hotel with the key to our apartment. You have seen her\nphotograph. She was a very impressive person and somehow when no matter who, like\nthe Nazi, the SR man...the underling who came, and who must have had a spark of\nhumanity in his mind and who left without doing any harm to us and even cautioned us to\nlock up and not open to anybody. And here...this Gestapo officials of high rank, because\nthey were the officials in the headquarters and they gave her the keys. But they gave her\nthe key for 24 hours...24 hours or 48 hours. I think 24 hours. It was enough for us to go\nin, take the money out that we had there and so make it possible for us to survive. That\nwas the second substantial visit. It was really not a visit. It was...uh...say...1t was really a\nbreak-in to our apartment. Subsequently, of course, she returned the key. Uh...Now...Now\nI want to...to...to go back or to go forward rather to speak about the Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Okay. Could we hold it? If you're moving to there, we're about ready to change tapes, so\nlet's do that at this point.",
        "A: Right. Okay. Good.",
        "Q: You can take some water.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Okay. We're back. You were going to take it up with Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Alright. Uh...Yal. Just before I go to Kristallnacht, there's something really significant I\nhave to mention. As I said, Father...Father was a broken man because....uh...he had lost\nhis business. Essentially, he had lost, in his eyes, his role. His role was that of protector.\nAnd now he couldn't protect us. Mother, on the other hand, had gained a role because she\nhad to do everything she had done before and more. And she was always...uh...a\nhousewife, a house person. So Mother became stronger but Father just broke. And Father\nwanted to die. He...he wanted...he wanted...as a matter of fact, he really wanted that all of\nus should commit suicide. And...and not only, and as I told you before, that he lost\nconsciousness...uh...every day and it was really a death that he wished. He wanted us all\nto die. He wanted that all of us should commit suicide. It was the only way out that...that\nhe saw possible. And every time that a Jewish family that we knew had chosen this\npath...had committed suicide... In one case I remember he was talking abut the family that\nwent out to the cemetery and they committed suicide at the grave site, probably of their\nparents. He came home and he said, \"What a wonderful thing these people did. We\nshould do the same thing.\" Uh...",
        "Q: How did your mother respond to that?",
        "A: My mother very quietly...uh...I...I...1 don't even remember her saying anything. She just\ndidn't accept his advice. Yes. But all the time what had happened inside of me was in\nsituations like this...uh...something grows up between you and your world, the world\noutside. It's...it's that wall that I talked about before, which had started to build up and\nyou can really only survive at a very, very significant price. And the price is...uh...that\nyou detach yourself from your emotions and when you lose your emotions...when you\nlose your connection with your feeling, you essentially become...uh...an automated...you\nessentially become a sort of person drained of vitality because you don't want to\nexperience what is happening around you, so you can't experience anything. Uh...And\nonce that happens...it isn't something...it's not like shoes you can put on and take off...and\nactually it sometimes lasts in some ways a life time. Not in that horrendous form, but I\nwill explain to you later how I emerged from all this into England. But it\ncertainly...uh...helps you escape and...uh... Unfortunately, we didn't know. The world\ndidn't know how to cope with this psychological situation at the time so they thought you\ngot out of it. Let's forget it. And that is essentially what happen, except you may forget it,\nbut it doesn't forget you and...uh...it just goes on living within you. Alright. Uh...The\nKristallnacht and its generally known that...uh...what triggered it was...uh...the\nassignation by a young Jewish boy...I think his name was...uh...Green...",
        "Q: Greenspan.",
        "A: Greenspan. Yal. Who had...uh....shot...uh... some German official at the Paris...the\nGermany Embassy in Paris by the name of\u201d *. Because...uh...they had...uh...I believe\nkilled his parents.",
        "Q: Don't worry about that. What happened...Where were you at Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Okay. Uh...I was on Kristallnacht, actually that day I was...I was in the carpentry\nworkshop. And...uh...I mentioned before the telephone call came so when the manager of\nthe workshop took the call and turned to us and said, \"Look. There is something going on\nin town. You'll be better off at home.\" We knew immediately what...what is going to be.\nWe packed our...our stuff and...uh...we...uh... went...went home. I remember...I had\nforgotten where this ...this carpentry workshop was, but I should imagine by the\nappearance of the...uh...the neighborhood because I was waiting for a train. I took a train,\nbut I know what kind of...uh... streets we went through. Uh...It seemed to have been the\ninner city which is an unusual place for a workshop because these were splendid\nbuildings. And I remember standing...you see the...the...the trains in Vienna had an open\nplatform...uh...either at...at the rear end so you could easily jump on and off and you\ncould be standing there. And I was standing along side. It was close to me. There was an\nelegant couple and, you know, in those times when people were elegant, they were\nelegant. There was a very attractive lady and she was dressed in a beautiful silk dress it\nseemed to me, and a gentlemen and she was looking at the newspaper and seeing\nsomething and she turned to the man and said, \"Look at this terrible things they're doing\nto the Jews in Germany. Surely, this couldn't happen here.\" I remember those words\nbecause...uh...first of all, there are a lot of... Really, the only words I remember from\nthat...from that period actually spoken because within a few seconds or a few minutes or\nmoments or very short time after that, we passed a side street. The train went on a side\nstreet and there was this magnificent temple in flames. And there was a Jew in costume\nwith a long beard. Obviously he must have been praying in the synagogue and he was\nrunning and there was a crowd running after him and he was like one of those you know,\nin the classic books that I was reading. Uh...with a poem by Sheller about a Kraut chasing\nsomething or other. And you flash by. I mean the train, you know, how long does it take.\nIt was just a. And it was an ironic commentary on what that lady said...uh..to the man. I\nremember coming home, which was actually the apartment of my sister and...uh...there I\nknocked on the door and you must...and you must...uh...not remember because you don't\nknow of this, but bear in mind that these were heavy reinforced doors with not only\nmassive...uh...wood, but also not the kind of plywood that is used now, but genuine oak\nor something like, but also...uh...uh...steel bars inside. There's a whole...there's a whole\nsteel door inside. So these were fortresses. I don't know why they were fortresses because\nthere were very few thefts there. But nonetheless, at least before the Nazis, in which case\nthese were really thefts, but...uh...these...these doors were difficult to break down. When I\ncame home they very cautiously opened the door. My...I found there my...my...my\nmother, my sister and her baby. Her baby was...uh...only about 2 months old at the time.\nRose was born in August 1938. So I can...I can position this in time because I...she was\nborn in August 1938. I left on the 18th of December 38. Of course, it's the Kristallnacht,\n11th of November. Well, I knew that before. So...uh...she was 2 months...2 months old.\nAnd Father wasn't there. I believe he must have been arrested. And...uh...my brother-in-\nlaw had been arrested. My...my sister says that happened on the morning of the\nKristallnacht, but at any rate I know that he was...uh...sent to Dachau and he was in\nDachau in fact over...over half a year. Uh...How he got out of it alive, but...uh..and he\nwent through terrible time there. In any case, when I came home, something strange\nhappened. I mean I was always the youngster, the kid and so on. And now I...I was the\nonly man. And I don't know whether this is some genetics or the biology of relatives, I\njust...[...the diffident, the shy, the book worm and so on, assumed control quite naturally\nand I said, \"If somebody comes, we won't open the door. We just don't open.\" And\nthis...well, my sister was always a person...my sister was not a person who was very\nassertive. In any case, she would have taken a rather quiet role in the background. But my\nmother was a very courageous person. But I think as a result of all that had happened...of\nwhat happened to Father...of the fact that both of them were arrested, she became...she\nwas very quiet and she just accepted...uh...my suggestion without any demurring. Well,\nwe didn't have to wait long. Shortly after, it was before lunch time, we heard these...uh...\nvery well known...uh... boots beating on the door and they weren't just beating on the\ndoor, generally accompanied by shouts...open up this that and so on. We didn't open.\nAnd I think probably...I have gone through some different phases in my life, but this must\nhave been one of them because...uh... we tiptoed into the kitchen and so as not to be seen\nfrom outside or so we were on the fifth floor, but the house was built around the court\nyard and you could have looked in from the opposite wing. So we had to stand pressed\nagainst the wall. And my sister had to put her hand on the mouth of the baby. It was a 2\nmonth old baby. And always be afraid that either she might stifle her inadvertently or that\nthe baby would cry. And here these men were battering on the door and you know, with\nthe jack boots you can subject a door to some treatment and it went on, it seemed to me,\nfor an eternity. And what went through my mind was the scene of in Crime and\nPunishment. was a criminal. Yal. But nonetheless, it was a scene of the most...and they\nwere standing there in, I believe in the kitchen, after having committed the deed, and they\nhear some...some steps going up and then the door rattling and he is afraid that the lock\nmight...might open up because...uh...this...uh...was just some...some kind of...uh... what\ndo you call it in English? It's...uh...we call it a..It wasn't...1t wasn't locked with a key, but\nit was locked with some...some kind of mechanical device.",
        "Q: Yal. I know what you mean.",
        "A: Uh...And that scene flashed through my mind because I was always living half in the\nbook and half outside. And then we...and we could hear everything that was going on\noutside and then...uh...one man said to the other...apparently, he was the leader of the\ngroup. He said to the other, \"or whatever the name was, Go down and fetch a crow bar.\"\nAnd this fellow went down. And, of course, our...way back...uh...was closed. We couldn't\nopen. They would have thrown us out the window. At that moment, the door from a\nneighboring apartment opened and there was a woman... I had never spoken to her.\nMother had never spoken to her. I don't know whether my daughter knew her. She was a\nGentile obviously. And she said, \"You know, I saw them go out about a hour ago. You're\nwasting your time\"...or words to that effect. You could hear everything in that apartment.\nYou could hear things through the door. And they went away. And in the afternoon, they\ncame back. And, of course, I had said, \"Look. They come back in the afternoon. We open\nimmediately. I don't want to go through this again.\" Yal. So when they came, we opened\nstraight away. But I, you know, my temper was...was sort of moving up, you know, again\nand I decided that I was going to sit at...uh... the coffee table in the saloon...uh...drinking\na cup of coffee or tea or whatever was there as if...uh... I couldn't care a damn about what\nwas going on, just to show my disdain, you understand. I thought that this would make a\nsignificant impression. I was really, you know, half serious, half child...uh. And that's\nwhat I did. And they came in and my sister had...uh...a side porch, you know with sliding\nglass doors and she displayed all kinds of...uh...lots of precious things...porcelain,\ncrystal...uh...the things that you got for our wedding...uh...heirlooms, stuff of that sort.\nAnd, of course, they were after it. And one of the Nazis, a kind of clumsy fellow, who\nhad never handled doors like this tried to open and he sort of fumbled around and he\ncouldn't figure out how this...this door opened. Yal. Because the only door probably that\nhe...he got to know was the door on hinges. And I could see him sort of...I could almost\nread his mind...and holding his foot, his leg up in order to kick the door in, and I jumped\nup. Yal. And confronted him as much as I could confront him. I mean my head was\nprobably the height of his breast bone. And I said you know...and I again remember the\nwords verbatim...there are two ways of opening this door. I said, \"One is you lift your leg\nand kick it in like that, and I just imitated what he was doing, and the other one is like this\nand I put out one little finger and I just made the door open. And don't you think that's a\nbetter way. And I looked him in the face and he looked back and no words were\nexchanged...no further word was exchanged between us. And, of course, they packed all\nthe stuff up and took it away and walked out. And that was another visit. It was the most\nterrible because of what happened in the morning and that could have easily ended up, as\nI say, with our flying out of the window. Uh...If you don't mind, a few things occur to me.\nI want to go back to them. First of all (clearing throat), there was first of all two...two\npersonal encounters and...uh...that I think of. Uh...I had...I told you before that I had...I\nhad learned in some way that in certain critical situations I could face up to things and\nsomehow assert control. It was almost a kind of...uh...psychological insight...some...some\nmeasure of certainty that I had at the time. Some...some voice that came to me from\noutside myself. And I remember that one of the times it happened was even before the\nNazis came in. Uh...It was winter time and I was dressed...uh...in a very nice winter coat.\nIt was a new coat. with a herringbone and a velvet collar. And here was a much bigger\nboat but ragged, obviously from very poor circumstances who came up and our steps met\nat the corner and I knew that he wasn't going to shake my hands. I realized that he was\ngonna beat me up. And I always had empathy for the underdog. I had a very, very strong\nempathy. I had really always a strong heart for poor people, for animals, for all things of\nthat sort, and I felt ashamed actually of my...of our circumstances. Even so, God\nknows,...uh...I was luxuriating my...the presence of the coat with normally books, you\nknow, or games of skills. They never bought me a model set because I might break my\nleg or something, which I probably would have (chuckle) if they bought me one. But I\nalways had that...that feeling that...uh...I felt uncomfortable of having more than\nsomebody else and so I didn't have to fake anything. I...I really had an understanding for\nhim and a feeling for him. And it may have been this fact that sort of edged away fear\nbecause it took the place of fear. It was...it was the feeling that possessed me. And I said\nto him...uh...\" You know, I want...uh...there's something I want to tell you.\" And I said it\nin a way that...uh...somehow or other seemed to engage him, seemed to engage his\ninterest. I was listening and I told him about the fact that I wanted to go to Palestine and\nthat many of us, even those of us who come from so-called...uh...homes that were more\naffluent really wanted to choose this life for ourselves and that I understand where he\ncame from and understand his circumstances that...that many of...of friends of mine,\npeople I know have chosen a life of work on the land, hard work. Yal. And there wasn't\nreally as much difference between us as might appear. And that I wasn't responsible for\nthe fact that...that he was poor and that he was in difficult circumstances and we almost\nbecame friendly and they told...he told me about the fact that his father was beating him\nup and so on and so forth and, you know, his father was a drunkard. But I will never\nforget the words that he said to me at the end and the words were...and this was a poor,\nmaybe semi-literate, ragged youth, maybe a year before the Nazis came...I would say\nabout... He says, \"You know, Hitler is going to come here and then I am sorry...I am\ngoing to be sorry for all of you.\" And these are words that I have forgotten easily. That\nwas one encounter. The other one was already under the...under the Nazis. I was...uh...I\nthink walking home at the time and...it was and it was the place where our shul was, the\nlittle synagogue. Uh...There were sitting in the front pew. My father incidentally was the\nvice-president of the other group, which 1s...which was a Zionist philanthropic\norganization. And my father was very active in public affairs and as a philanthropist,\nsomething that once saved him from the Nazis because I remember in a\nprocession...procession that came by, and I was sort of listening at the window, and\nsomebody was shouting, \"Let's take old Schmeltzer,\" and...uh...somebody else said, \"Oh,\nleave him. At least he helps his own kind.\" So strange things happened...uh...even in\nthose times. There was this shul in the and I was not far away. As a matter of fact,\nmidway up that street, in the where our shul was. Our shul was at the corner of the where\nwe lived in this. Midway up there was a restaurant at that time. And as I was walking...\nprobably...I don't remember exactly whether I was walking home or walking away\nfrom...at any rate I suddenly was surrounded by something like a dozen boys. It was like\na ring around me. And there were closing in on me. And it was clear that they were going\nto beat me up. All of them! Together! And again that particular sense came over me that\nallowed me to detach myself from my personal circumstance and take on another voice.\nIt was almost as if I was reading a book. And imagination has its place at times. And I\nsaid to them...I... raised my hand because I realized you know, I have to do something\nthat attracts attention...I raised my hand at the time and said, \"Look. Before you beat me\nup, I have something interesting to tell you. And, of course, you know, rich boy...\nmean...everybody is curious...1 mean no matter what. I said, You know, what's happening\nhere. There's a dozen of you Gentiles, Christians who want to beat up one of me, one\nJew. Now what are you doing there. You're really declaring that one Jew is as good as 12\nof you.\" And that...that sort of...that sort of made them look up. Yal. And I said, \"I am\ngoing to tell the Nazi party about it and, you see, they'll be very angry at you.\" (Laughter)\nGod knows where this came from. Yal. It's really absolutely absurd. It's ridiculous, but it\nsomehow engaged their attention and they started to discuss this matter amongst each\nother. (Laughter) Because they were as little...uh...learning. They had just...they picked\nup anti-Semitism probably from early childhood because it was endemic in Austria. And\nas they were discussing things, a little gap opened. They...you know, at one point they\ndrew apart. It was just enough for me to flee through and I ran. At that time the person\nwho held the world's record in long distance running was a fellow called ...I think I\noutran him. I ran so fast up, away from our home, up the to which was a parallel street, a\nvery, very magnificent. Well, it's a very lively vital street that led up to the ticket of the I\nover took a train and remember I told you they had these open platforms and I jumped up\nand there weren't sufficiently close to me. I mean they couldn't overtake me and they\ncouldn't get on the train and so I got away that particular time. Now I had mentioned\nsomething about shuls. I want to go back to this because something else comes up in my\nmind. A year before I had Bar Mitzvah and I remember standing in front of the mirror in\nour L-shaped hall, the one that I described to you before. My mother plunked some kind\nof blue hat on me which almost blotted my face out. I had this little round face you know,\nand I was frightened out of my wits, and I was led to...uh...the shul almost like a calf to\nslaughter and I had to give this long you know which was half in Hebrew and half in\nGerman and these...these were long affairs and you had to know them by heart. It took at\nleast half an hour or later. Yal. You studied it for it months. And I remember (clearing\nthroat) I stood there and I looked at the people and the shul was full of people and my\nheart sank. This was definitely not a moment of control. And my voice said bye bye, just\ntook leave of me and when I opened my voice...my mouth, almost no voice came out.\nYal. And my teacher, Hebrew teacher...his name was Daft, D A F T...was a young,\nmodern man actually. He sat behind me and he leaned forward at this point and he said to\nme, \"You know, if Mussolini can do it, you can do it.\" I mean, again, outrageous\nstatement, but this man understood something in me because I got so enraged at the fact\nthat this is doing something and I can't doing it....Yal...that I completely forgot myself\nand I delivered a splendid oratory and everybody was weeping and the last one who\nwasn't weeping was my sister and I considered this as a personal affront. And then I sort\nof focused my look. I beamed it at her like a lazer beam and I said one or two sentences\nas I glazed and then she started weeping. I was very happy. And then our...our family\ndoctor, Frye, he was crying too. Everybody was crying (laughter) in that synagogue.\nNow, I...I mention this because Daft, who was my teacher, under the Nazi unfortunately\nsomething very tragic befell of him...befell him. One day his wife came to my mother and\nshe was literally wringing her hands and said she doesn't know what to do because her\nhusband had simply become mad. He picked up a knife. He said that she wanted to\npoison him. She was afraid of her life. She was afraid to go to the authorities. And...here\nyou had a world of madness inside in response to madness outside...uh... It was literally a\nworld where all the controls, all the dams broke. Uh...And I don't really know what\nhappened. But I do know that I once visited his place. That was in the good times before\nmy Bar Mitzvah and I was so impressed by the stacks of books he had and there was and\nI read the title of every one....\nEND OF TAPE 2, SIDE 2\nservice people of medical who were guarding the prisoners inside. And they were\noutside. And inside were hundreds of German prisoners of war. And these were giants.\nThey were sailors. They were apparently caught...uh...you know either on the ships or\nwhatever. You can imagine. Here was a group of 30, 40 young Jewish school children, all\nfrom whatever happened in Europe and...uh...I think...I don't want to be adamant about it.\nI seemed to remember there was swastika flags inside. Yal. But I am not going to sign\nthat underwriting. Uh...Certainly, there was..uh..a planned Nazi atmosphere also. Yal.\nThere were no demonstrations against us. It was just enough to see these fellows around\nand we in the midst. There were only 30, 40 of us and we were children..very young boys\nof 16. None was older than 16. There were only a few Polish among them. Then what\nhappened was... we were about 2 or 3 months in that camp. What happened was that\nsome of us were Orthodox. Now I wasn't Orthodox myself, but some of us were\nOrthodox, and they were strictly kosher, and they would not eat a non-kosher food. And\nthere was no provision for non-kosher food, and we all declared solidarity with those who\nwere Orthodox. So they wouldn't eat non-kosher food. We didn't eat non-kosher food.\nThe result of it we were all starving and we were literally starving because...uh...all you\ncould eat was cheese...uh...when...when it was served. And I remember the mostly\nseemed to serve meat which we couldn't eat. Yal. And I ate plenty of toast with jam\nbecause I was working in the kitchen. I was very partial to toast and jam, must have eaten\nso much I couldn't stand it anymore. But we were literally starving and in the end became\nso...uh...drained of strength...uh...that sometimes...sometimes we were lying out there on\nthe grass and we couldn't even...hardly could get up. We were really that much\nweakened. I remember the Polish lad that was...I told you about this man, this , who\nbecome a friend of mine, was giving us daily lectures and he had extensive knowledge in\nvarious areas. And I remember in biology in particular, biology and literature and history\nand politics. These were his main subjects...and in psychology. And this man was so well\nread that through the three months he could give us daily lectures of 2 or 3 hours every\nday... Yal...and really have us riveted. And...and through this camp, there passed different\ngroups. Someones, there was a group of Jewish adults and of a group of Italian adults. I\nremember the Italian were so different from the Germans. They transformed the...the\ncamp into a soccer stadium. Yal. You know, I...I later make friends with Italians. I love\nthese people. I mean they are just so human. Prison or no prison, they were kicking that\nball around. Yal. So different from the very...and I am not saying this against the German\nas such, but they were very solemn and stodgy. Yal. There was no note of joy.\nNothing...nothing to remember. One thing was they all...a lot of them carved things. They\nwere wonderful at carving things. They made little sailing boats that you could push\nthrough the neck of a bottle you know. And I watched that and they carved pipes with all\nkinds of...uh...legendary monsters with shaped faces on them. One day, one of the Nazis\nthere...uh...was named Putsy Humstanker. Now I am saying this from just hearing about\nit. But Putsy Humstanker, I was told was a friend of Hitler's. How he had gotten\nhimself...uh...captured or what, I don't know. And...and I was told that he was...he was a\nfellow who played piano, entertained with Hitler's piano and so on. Putsy Humstanker\ncame to us one afternoon drunk and he said, \"Look. The Germans are plotting to get rid\nof you. And I am your friend.\" Yal. Such friends I can do without, but...we weren't. So,\nwe couldn't look to the British where we could say. They weren't...[ mean they were\noutside. Uh...We armed ourselves with clubs, this, that and the other and sit guards at\nnight, but you know in a sense maybe because we were young and maybe because...well,\nwe were the way we were...We would betroy slogans on our hearts and...and then and\nHebrew...uh...slogans...and so on. We did not allow the fact that we were really just a tiny\ngroup in this German sea. To the tourist to anyway. But nonetheless, there were difficult\ntimes and don't forget this was just about the time that France fell in May. I remember...I\nremember one day that we lying outside. It was also a day of marvelous summer, blue\nskies, so radiant. And not far away from us, there was a...a military...uh...Yal... a\nmilitary...uh...airport and I saw some riding from there and it was so close by that they\nskimmed over us. I was lying there with some others and we were looking up in the sky\nand there was these planes. There were so close you could see the heads of the pilots.\nAnd we could see the scarves flying up and the German bombers were up there...up deep\nin the sky up above. We could hear them them droning. And those marvelous youngsters\nwere flying straight at them. Yal. It's... You know, war is a terrible thing, but I have to\nadmit it's one of the most beautiful sights that I have seen. And to see those silver planes.\nI mean if you detach yourself from the horror and to see afterwards the denotations\nblossoming like great yellow, red flowers and then parachuting and then when the planes\nburst, there was a deeper color and then, the parachutes coming down like thistles. Yal.\nThat was an unforgettable sight. I...I felt very, very proud of those fighters that went up,\nand I am not a military person. But, 1n any case, as I said to go back or to go forward,\nFrance fell and the Germans became very cocky, very arrogant. And some of them threw\ntheir finger across the throat when they passed us. Yal. And I don't know what our\nfeelings were at the time, frankly. I think so many things had happened to us in the\nbeginning that suddenly, I didn't...I didn't function too much emotionally. Yal. Uh...And\nsuddenly, one day they decided to evacuate us to send us either to Canada or Australia. I\nam not sure. And we were...uh...meant to go on a certain ship. I believe the name was\nAndora Star. Somehow that name stuck in my mind. I always associated it with that\nparticular situation. And all the Germans...uh... in our camp were sent on the Andora Star\nand there were some Jewish people, including a brother of my brother-in-law, from other\ncamps. He was interned too, of course, who was in the Andora Star. Now we were taken\noff maybe a day or two before embarkation because...uh...Jewish...the Jewish Federation\nit. All kinds of people were working frantically behind the scenes with the home office,\nwith the war office, this that and the other thing. Look...what...this...our Jewish with\nthe... They are boys. What you want to send them to Canada or Australia for with\nGermans. They took us off the last moment. You know what happened to the Andora\nStar. It was torpedoed. My brother-in-law's brother was killed among the others and later\non when I was in again in another place called... I met one of the rare Jewish survivors of\nthat ship incidentally so I...so I...I know the story all around. And what he told me was\nthat when the ship was torpedoed, the Jews were down in the steerage. I mean they were\ndown, and the Germans and the British were up and they were close to...and they...they\ntook possession of all the lifeboats and the Jews were not allowed into the life boats and\nhe was swimming along and he said he must have been in the water a hour or so. You\ncan't measure time in that condition. And he was almost losing his last ounce of strength,\njust couldn't go on and there was this life boat near him and he managed to swim up to it\nand stretch out his hand and get hold of it. And I have to say this ironic episode that\nhappened was that a British person...a British, one of the mates of the ship, said, \"Sorry,\nold boy. You know, full up. This is not the last boat.\" And the Germans said, \"Oh, let the\npoor bastard on.\" And they pulled him up and so he was saved. Yal. And I think he must\nhave been one of the very, very, very rare Jewish survivors from the Andora Star. And\nthere was another occasion when death was just moving past me as if he didn't know\nme...or didn't know me or didn't really want to know me...uh...and...and...and\nmany...many other people have stories of this kind. And those of us who escaped...uh...\nmany of us had many escapes before you could finally get away. That takes us up\nto...uh...beyond...beyond the Andora Star and the return to...to internment to Lensfield.\nNo...We didn't return. They didn't take us out, of course. We remained in Lensfield, but\nshortly afterwards...uh...we were finally released and I remember the commandant of the\ncamp wept. Uh..There were a number of sterling British figures I have to say. Uh...As I\ntold...as I told you, Britain is one of the countries I have warm affection. It's not that\neverybody was a saint, but you make an overall appraisal of a nation, of a civilization and\nin England I loved them and my...my brother in Palestine did not. He saw...he saw the\nBritish from another...another angle, but I have to say that I experienced them in their\nown country and there are some just lovely, marvelous...uh...persons there and the\ngeneral tone is...1s...1S just lot more civilized than the one I encountered generally in\nAustria. I have to say that. Very different. Now...uh...uh...there was another officer there\nin the internment camp. We called him Auntie. We called him Auntie because he was\nsuch a passionately devoted soul. He was such a lovely man. Out of his own pockets, he\nwould buy us things...socks and undergarments and stuff. He was another one who cried\nwhen we left. Yal. He was a marvelous person. Now...Don't...don't think that every\nBritish was like this, but you don't need to meet that many persons and they do\nleave...uh...a strong...uh...1mpression behind them. Yal. They sort of light the way. It's\nalmost as if fate...uh...has decided well, you know, you've gone through this, that and the\nother. We'll send you a little light. Yal. So afterwards, when I got out of the\ninternment...uh...there was an episode and here I am not absolutely certain about\nthe...uh... timing of things or the sequence of events, but I know that my sister was\nevacuated to Spalding and I managed to be there. I managed to be for a few months there,\nworking the land, because I was then at the time on the war essential work order.\nUh...just to be close to her and I managed to survive some bombing attacks that\npractically pulled the house down over us because the Germans mistook Spalding for\nwhich was a nearby railroad station, you know. And they bombed...they released all the\nbombs on Spalding. Uh...Amongst other things...uh...they destroyed the zoo and killed a\nlot of animals there. Uh...After that I...I was in...uh...[ was in London for some time and I\ncan't date that. I know that I worked in a factory. I know that I...uh...I thought up ways of\nspeeding up production by a multiple of 2 or 3 by...because there were more machines\nthere than...than people. And I worked out a mathematical system whereby you could\nkeep 3 or 4 machines in operation, you know, only attended by | person. And you could\ndo it faultlessly. It wasn't even difficult. However, I was watched by the supervisor. You\nknow it is very strange, you know. And incidentally, I had a similar encounter because\nnot everybody in Britain was giving their best for the war effort obviously, but many did\nand many were very heroic. So again, humanity and with all its...but...uh...there was\nanother occasion in Spalding. In Spalding...uh...I worked for a period of time in the sugar\nrefinery near the laboratory and...uh...I had...uh...another encounter of a similar nature\nwhere I wanted to be a little more productive than a certain person, a certain woman\nand...uh... She then...She became so angry with me because she...because I was in the\nlaboratory...I was supposed to be testing the molasses in the various stages of preparation\nas to be come to refinement. And she spread the story about me that I was a German spy.\nBut unfortunately...fortunately, rather, she was known as a liar. Nobody paid any\ncredence to her. Uh...I was also in Cambridge. So that was a very intense time. I was also\nin Cambridge at some time...uh...but this was after I had gotten to... I returned to... It was\nin... That was a place around... You know... the great...uh...J am making and liquor\nmaking and so on. And we...we were living there in really terrible conditions. The\ndifference between and was difference between night and day...day and night rather\nbecause was an unsanitary camp. It had been condemned by the British. It had no\nfacilities, no toilet facilities even and so on and so forth. And we worked like slaves on\nthe land. I was there for about half a year. Uh...I eventually left and I went to Cambridge.\nI was followed by some of the...uh...at that time, a friend of mine, my alter ego almost\nand he went to Cambridge and...uh...I had the childish idea that I only needed to go to\nCambridge and all universities would open their door and say, \"Herr Schmeltzer, you\nknow, now you are here. Why didn't you come earlier? You see, we have just the place\nfor you.\" Well, I ended up as a gardener in College. (Laughter) And I have to tell you\nit's...1t's a really amusing little tale because at that time I was preparing...I was on one of\nmy studies. You see, in...1n Vienna because my parents' forced me to study. I didn't want\nto do it. But once I had left and I wasn't under constraint, I felt that what I most\npassionately wanted in life was to study. Yal. I always read intensively and extensively,\nyou understand. Now I wanted to study. So I thought going to Cambridge somehow or\nother was all you needed to do and say here I am and that's it. Well, as I say, I became a\ngardener and I...1 am ashamed to say I used part of my time actually for study purposes.\nWhat I did was that I...I organized the study plan to two areas. Uh...the...uh...liberal art\nthings if you like, languages and literature and that kind of stuff and grammar, I had this\nlittle notebook that I could hold in the palm of my hand. Mathematics and other\nthings...mathematics I would rake out and smooth out a plot of land, you know, and I\nwould...I would draw geometric figures and so on on the land and work them out. And\nthen I would enter them 1n a little notebook. But it turned out that the which were an\nadministrative group of they were looking behind the window sills you know in the\nstately buildings and they were observing this strange person who was drawing figures in\nthe soil, you understand. And they couldn't figure out what it was I was actually doing,\nbut it seemed to occupy me for an enormously length of periods of time and I seemed to\nbe absolutely obsessed with it. So I was eventually called there and the words that...that\n[...that they said to me were, you know, we have observed you over a period of time\nand...uh...frankly, most of the time you seemed to be scratching things in the ground or\nlooking at the palm of your hand. We couldn't figure out what it is you are doing, but you\ndidn't do enough work so I am afraid we have to fire you. So I drew myself up to...and I\nam not very enormous length at the time...I said, \"I am really ashamed of you because\nthis 1s supposed to be an intellectual...uh... institution and...uh...I can tell you that I am\nprobably more intelligent than any of the students you have, but they have lots more\nmoney than I have and if you were really an institution of learning and not of money, you\nwould say, \"Look. We really want you here as a student, but obviously you don't know\nanything about things of that sort. Good Day.\" And I walked out. And afterwards I was\nreally kind of...I was almost trembling because I wasn't... wasn't cock sure at all. Yal. I\nthink it was...1t was part of my general nature. Anger that was kind of spilling out, you\nknow. In retrospect...uh...there was very little...they... they... they...that they could do\nabout it. I guess they were only acting according to their best understanding of the way\nthe world worked. And I was little...a bit outside the scheme of things. So after\nCambridge I thought...I almost...almost was 18. I wanted to volunteer to be a fighter pilot.\nMaybe this period of the planes flying over...also the fact...the fact that I...I just wanted\nto...to...1 wanted revenge.",
        "Q: May I...We have 10 minutes left on this tape, so what I am going to suggest we do 1s if\nyou can encapsulate what happened to you and tell us what happened because I want to\nbring you...uh...to where we had discussed earlier. I want to bring you to after the war in\nCanada.",
        "A: Alright. Yal.",
        "Q: If you could just tell me what happened.",
        "A: Yal. I can.... can Yal. I can do that. Uh... Because it doesn't take too long time. The fact\nof the matter is that I...volunteered as a fighter pilot and...uh...I went through medical\nexamination. There were examinations and they seemed to work out well, but I did get a\nletter eventually...sorry they couldn't take me. They didn't take any at the time. And I\nwasn't called an...I was an Austrian Jew. Austria was an enemy. So in England I was an\nAustrian. I was an enemy. In Austria I was a Jew. I fell between the cracks. Uh...At that\ntime I could have volunteered for the corps, but I wasn't going to be in a service corps. I\nwant to be in a fighting unit. I thought...again, here my childish naivet\u00e9 came\nthrough...that if I...that the moment they allowed us to..to...volunteer to join a...a combat\nunit...uh...I would be allowed to join my brother. It was again a strong urge that I had to\njoin...and I always worshiped...I really worshipped my brother even so he sometimes beat\nme up. I have to say that. But he was a great person. He was really one of the heroes in\nmy life. And there are not many of them. maybe, in retrospect, was the great hero, but\nLeo of my family was not among them. And I had the feeling...somebody told me, one of\nthe person recruitment said to me, \"Yes, you...you volunteer and we'll send you wherever\nyou want to go.\" I believed it. Of course (laugh), you see, the moment we were allowed\nto volunteer for the combat unit...I volunteered and I was...uh...accepted. That...1t took\nsome time because I only joined in the early 43 I believe it. It wasn't 43 for sure. I don't\nhave the date on me exactly.",
        "Q: Where were you sent? Where were you sent?",
        "A: Well, first of all we went through 16...16 weeks of training. You know there was 6\nweeks and then 10 weeks.",
        "Q: We don't have the time. After training, where were you sent after training.",
        "A: I was...I was sent to a mountain unit, the... I think it was the 52nd Division and I am\nquoting from my memory and...uh...this was a division that was essentially stationed in\nthe northern mountains of Scotland where the snow and ice conditions are at least where\nwe went into training, not where the general camp was. It approximated the conditions in\nthe Arctic Circle. Uh...And I contracted a very severe condition. We...we slept in snow\nand sometimes it was even worse when we went below the snow line. And we slept\nliterally in icy water. And...and we went out for training sometimes for 2 weeks at a\nstretch, 10 days to 2 weeks at a stretch. I might sleep about, at most, an hour a night til\nyou woke up in the icy water. You only slept out of exhaustion. I contracted a fairly\nserious arthritic condition, you know, with pain the swollen limbs and so on. And\neventually...uh...this...uh... went on for about 2 years. Essentially I understood that we are\nstationed there to...uh...1n case there was a German attack from Norway...from Northern\nEurope, you know, to protect his flank. Eventually this unit was sent off...uh...2 or 3\nweeks before Dunkirk...not Dunkirk... That happened before, of course... Before\nthe...uh...invasion of Europe and...uh...again, I was taken off the unit about a couple of\ndays before the unit in training and I want to tell you what happened.",
        "Q: If we have time. That's the problem. You were just taken off?",
        "A: I was...I was...I was taken off...[ was actually commanded...uh...not to go and...uh...it's\nunfortunate if you don't have time because it's only three sentences.",
        "Q: Okay. Go ahead.",
        "A: Yal. It was really through the intervention of an officer who...uh...was a poet or some\nliterary person who had gone on walks with me. We talked about literature and so on and\nhe said to me, \" Look. You are a sick person. You have this arthritic conditions. You\ncould go and should go and have yourself examined by doctors because you're not in\ncondition to go.\" And I said, \"Under no circumstances I am going to do this. I\nvolunteered and I will never do it.\" And this man had an order sent to me by the medical\nboard which commanded me to appear before them. I appeared before them and to my\nutter amazement, I was downgraded from A to C-2. It was really a strange story. Uh...I\nwas taken off a day or two before the...the unit went in training. I was broken up over\nthat. I was really...I...I had extremely mixed emotions over this whole thing...uh...because\n[...] thought maybe I could have gone, but there was no way I could have gone. H",
        "Q: You stayed in Britain... We have about 2 minutes. Uh... You stayed in Britain until the\nend of the war.",
        "A: Oh, sure. I stay...I stayed in Britain until the war. I was demobilized in 1947. And as a\nmatter of fact, I...you know when you're demobilized you're given...uh...certain\nthings...uh...few dozen belongings, what not...underwear. The most magnificent thing\nwas the raincoat. And the first... This was a really marvelous raincoat, and the first thing\nthat I did was to go to Hyde park and again it was beautiful summer. At least this was a\nsummery day. And so I didn't need to put the raincoat on, you know. I had it over my\narm. And there in Hyde Park, if you have ever been there, there's a lake there, a boating\nlake. And I put my rain...rain coat simply on...on the bench and then walked away from it\nand walked to the lake to look at the boats and then I remembered I had a raincoat. So I\nreturned to the bench and I didn't have a raincoat anymore. Uh...It was the shortest person\never was and there was a fellow near there who said, Oh you...you are the owner of the\nraincoat. Well, I have got to tell you, there was a prostitute here and she saw the raincoat\nand just picked it up and walked away with it. So...uh...I have to say, here was...here\nwas...uh...the legacy to the government of the British Army, you know. But, at least, at\nleast, it was good for one person. Let us.

        "A: ... that's a small place, small town...uh...near what was at that time before the first world\nwar...uh...the Austrian/Russian boarder because that part of Poland was...uh...in the\nAustria...Austria...I think they called it Austria/Hungarian empire. Austria/Hungarian I\ndon't know how...how you would say that in English really. Uh...And the grandparents\nalso came from very close to that place. They lived there til the outbreak of the first world\nwar, 1914, when my father was indoctrinated into the Austrian Army and\nMother...uh...who at that time was pregnant with my older sister, Leah and we called her\nTont...uh...fled from that area...took her mother along by the name of Freda\nand...uh...fled to Vienna. My oldest sister was born on the way in Hungary. Uh...Ever\nsince then until they had to escape from Vienna after the Nazis came in in 1938,...uh... we\nlived...we lived in Vienna. As a matter of fact, as far as I know we lived in the same\nhouse until the last 2 or 3 months of 1938.",
        "A: After my father was demobilized from the army...uh...he... uh... built up a...uh... wine\nbusiness and over a period of 20 years he built it into a very substantial wine wholesale\nbusiness. Uh...finally, we had...uh...large cellars in the...I think it was in the 18th District\nin \u2019\u2019I....1 remember the place very well. It is a magnificent large court yard with chestnut\ntrees...uh...three offices...uh...and extensive underground cellars. At least I was very\nimpressive by the fact that they were...uh....uh...barrels of wine higher than I was, which\nwasn't very difficult. I wasn't very tall at the time, but they were about the height of a\nman. And...uh...there were rows and rows of them. And there was an escalator going\ndown...uh...along which I guess they were transferring the barrels into bottles and so on\nand so forth. And he supplied mainly restaurants and hotels. Some of the wine we also\nimported from other countries, like Yugoslavia and I expect Hungary and so on. Uh...",
        "A: Yes. Well, uh...first of all, what I...I have to say something in general about the nature of\nmy memories. Uh...the Nazi period stretches across...uh...the landscape of my memories\nof my mind almost like a Chinese war. You can...there are chinks here and there. You can\nlook through them. You can catch a glimpse of some of the things that happened beyond\nthe war...before it, but...uh...this...this huge war has cast a long shadow, both backwards\nand forwards, and really dominates the landscape. But I do remember some of the things.\nUh...We were substantially a middle class family. As I say, we always lived in the same\nhouse in which really means a street of front gardens. Each apartment house had little\nfront gardens. I remember vividly these were beautiful gardens with...uh...flower\nbeds...uh...carnations, forget me naught, roses...uh...and huge lilies. This was lilies I\nbelieve. Uh...The house itself...uh...uh...was really properly built. You know, in...1n\nVienna, you had houses that were built for centuries...uh...marble and...and brass\nand...and oak to us and so on and so forth, absolutely beautifully fitted out. Uh...At first\nwe lived on the third floor and then we moved down stairs to a mezzanine, which is a\nkind of half floor. It's almost on the level of the second floor as they would call it here\nbecause the ground floor is called the first floor in...1n...1n America. Uh...We always had\nas far...as long as I remember it any way, live in maids. These were generally girls who\ncame from the country and...uh...Mother...uh... was a very...uh... friendly and\ncompassionate person. She was always... always busy in the house, mainly on cooking\nwhich was at that time a task that...that took up a good part of the day. Uh...The house\nwas sparkling. Uh... was a bookworm. I remember lying on my belly on the floor and\nseeing my reflection in the linoleum. Uh...I was lost in books. Uh...But I also had friends\nout in the streets and...uh...used to play...uh...kicking the ball around and playing with\nthose little marbles which at that time were clay, glossy clay balls. As a matter of fact,\nsome were glass, but I liked the clay better because they were so beautifully colored.\nUh...I do remember vividly. Now before...before I come to the elementary school, I want\nto say that there were two...uh...facts that I vividly recall. First of all, I had a rather strict\nfather. And that was very much in accordance with the fashion of the times. These were\npatriotic figures. And I loved him very much. I remember the intense joy that I had when\nI heard the... his key grating in the lock. I knew it was my father's key. And I knew more\nor less what time he would come home. Mother was a very affectionate woman. I am\nafraid that she...uh...she spoiled me. She was over-protective. She was always hovering\nover me when I was eating. The side effect, of course, was that I became the worst eater\nin Europe. I mean it just came to a point that I couldn't even look at a cup of coffee or\nmilk or whatever and not feel sick. I was a very, very bad eater. Yal. So that...that...that\nwas...that was a strong memory. Uh...Somehow...uh...I was very much of a dreamer.\nBooks were my world of escape. And I managed to enter this world and close the door\nbehind me and live in it for a long time. Elementary school was just around the corner.\nUh...Well around the corner. It was in a part of the street called, oddly enough, means\nbeautiful street. It wasn't nothing very beautiful about that street, but the elementary\nschool was called at the time. And I remember the first...I was a person...uh...not very\nindependent, probably as a result of the kind of education of the upbringing. As I said, I\nwas over-protected, and...uh...1t was difficult for me to separate myself from home and go\nto school in the first place. But...uh...I remember vividly on one of the first days, the\nprincipal of the school, I remember the name of Pakoni lifted me on to his knee and I can\nsee his friendly face. He was a person of Czech extraction, I believe. Uh...so he spoke a\nperfect German. I suspect that he might even have been born in Vienna. But, of course,\nyou know, the Austrian empire at the time incorporated...uh... No, it had incorporated. At\nthat time when I was born and Czechoslavakia was already an independent country. But\nbefore that it was part of the empire. Uh...So he took me on his knee and he asked me\nwhom I loved more, my mother or him. I was intensely embarrassed. I'm telling this story\nto show that...uh...uh... Vienna was a place of mixed emotions for me. Anti-Semitism was\nendemic in Vienna but there were loving persons, of course. There were individuals who\nand I did experience affection and love from some of them. As a matter of fact, when he\nasked me this question, the door opened and Mother came in. (Laughter) So that just adds\nto my embarrassment. (Laughter) I don't know how I wiggled out of that one.\nSubsequently, we had a...a teacher by the name of Kanote. Uh...and...uh...she also singled\nme out as...uh...I guess I am...I am really sorry to say as one of her preferred students\nbecause I don't like this whole business of really singling out anybody. I am today for\ninstance Professor at Rutgers University and...uh.... am very much guided by...uh...maybe\nthis experience and others that...uh...that I just like all my students. I like all the kids\nthere. Uh...But in any case, she had...she had the Jewish pets and the Gentile pets. I was\nthe Jewish. The Gentile was a fellow by the name of who 1s the son of policeman. I\nremember all these things so..so..so vividly. Uh...The reason I mention this again was to\nshow you a little bit of the atmosphere there. Uh...And I remember one occasion\nwhen...uh...she would sometimes go out because I think that...uh...she had a bit of a flirt\ngoing with a...with another teacher by the name of Flashman in the class. And she asked\nme to monitor the class. And as soon as she left, the class broke out into some kind of\nrowdy behavior and I immediately was able somehow to control that and what I learned\nabout myself instinctively, you know, and I only recall this on reflection now...was that\nin....in times of tension and so, I seemed to have...to...to psychologically understand ways\nof controlling myself, of being in...1n complete possession of myself and consequently of\nthe situation and it was something that stood me in good stead when the Nazis came in.\nUh...",
        "A: Right...Well..",
        "A: Yes. At that time...uh...that was, of course, I believe...uh... the date was the 11th of\nMarch, 1938. And...uh...We had at that time a live-in maid by the name of Fritzi\nShumberger. The reason I mention her was she did play a little bit of a role afterwards\nand also she had a little emblem on her lapel. It was . It was...uh...in the shape of a boot,\nand subsequently we learned that it was the emblem of the leading Nazis. I say illegal\nbecause before the Nazis marched in, the Nazi party was not legal in Austria. However,\npersonally, she was not...uh...hostile to us and I don't think that she behaved badly when\nall is said and done. Uh...I do remember the speech of Shoosnick who was at that time\nChancellor, \u201d Chancellor.",
        "A: I was...I was in that apartment...1n our apartment in 186 204. That was the first apartment\non the left side...uh...as you came into the house and stepped up quite a number of steps.\nUh...And I listed to...uh...his speech and do...do recall...uh...some of the words he said. I\nbelieve he said To the death with red, white red, which is the color of the Austrian flag.\nRed, white, red. Uh...At least my memory tells me that he said the things that he said.\nAnd...uh...Fritzi Shumberger, that maid, and my brother next to me (clearing throat)\nExcuse me. Guess I'll have to drink something.",
        "A: (Drinking water) Uh...My brother Leo. He was the next oldest. I was the youngest in a\nfamily of four which was also was a kind of situation that...uh...had me on my guard most\nof the time. And...and what separated me from the next one was a period of 6 years, very\nsubstantial. But the other three...uh...were only separated in terms of 2 years and there\nwas... So really there were two families. It was they and I. I always regarded myself as an\noutsider and I expect it was because of that large separation of time. Anyway, Leo was\nthere and Fritzi and she said something, \"Oh wonderful and so on and so forth.\"\nUh...Because obviously, I think she was going out with somebody who was a Nazi and\nthey...they were very joyful about Hitler coming in. As a matter of fact, many Austrians\nwere....uh...",
        "A: Fritzi Shumberger, our... our maid was very joyful about it and many Austrians were. In\nany case...uh...and my brother remarked...he made some kind of...uh...negative remark\nabout it, saying that...uh...,you know, there may not be that much reason to be happy.\n[...In any case...I do...I do remember that. I also remember the next day looking out. First\nof all, there were...there were bombers going...coming overhead. Hugh,\nhugh...uh...machines, droning and very low, almost...uh...scraping the...the...the tops...the\ntops of the houses. Black, black planes. They looked black to me or maybe that's just a\npsychological memory. Uh...And every house was draped with a spastic of flags. Every\nhouse! And these were hugh flags. I am talking about apartment houses, five floors. And\nthese were flags that...that went from the roof right almost down to the...to the sidewalk\nand I should imagine that...uh...there was a very active, highly organized Nazi\nunderground movement. And they distributed all these these flags over night. Also, there\nwere many Nazis in all the houses. There was a substantial proportion of Austrians and\nNazis. Austria has always...uh... managed to portray itself only as the victim and I have to\nsay most emphatically...and I don't want to be unjust to the many people in Austria who\nwere good people and kind people...but there was a large population of haters in Austria.\nAnd I don't think there was a single country in the world that embraced Hitler so\nfervently as the Austrian nation. And those of us who were there know it, experienced it.\nUh...I do remember that...uh...somehow or other I managed to either to allow my mother\nto go out or slip...I probably slipped out. And I went pretty far afield because I found\nmyself...uh...and this was probably not on the first week. It was probably some weeks\nafter the entry. But it was a time when...when Hitler...uh...was...uh...uh...going around in\na procession. I remember him...I remember him standing in a motor car, standing upright.\nIt was an open...uh... car. And the sidewalks were thronged with people. I mean there was\njust one mass of people all waving and shouting and...and...and jubilant. Uh...There was\nan ecstasy of joy. And I was standing there very quietly observing this. Uh...At that\ntime...uh...people who knew you before suddenly didn't know you. (Clearing throat) In\nour apartment house, we had...uh...there were quite a number of Jewish families in our\napartment house. Uh...There were not many Gentile families, but I think... There were\nprobably...it was probably half half. There might have been three or four...of two I know\ndefinitely that they were Nazis. Uh...One was called Garla, and he will appear later on\nbecause he tried to blackmail my father and caused his arrest. Uh...and the other one was\nSargi, and this Sargi, you know, there was this special story there because they are...there\nwas daughter and two sons. The two sons had been friends of my brothers. But the\nfriendship, I think had already more or less fizzled out...uh...uh...maybe a year or two\nbefore the Nazis came, but...uh...actually entered, but obviously, it was probably on the\nside of their becoming Nazis. One was called Franz and the other Willi. Willi Sargi\nbecame an SS man, and Franz Sargi became an SR man. Uh...And it's...they...they never\npersonally undertook any action against us, these people. And as a matter of fact, the\ndaughter...I don't know her name...who was working...uh...as probably some secretary in\nthe police headquarters, local police headquarters, was helpful to my mother.",
        "A: I don't recall the exact circumstances. I think it probably was...it might have been\nconnected with the arrest of my father. I am going to talk about it a little later on. But I\nknow that my mother went...uh...to her and I seem to remember that when she came back\nthat she said some nice things about...about her. But I don't remember the exact\ncircumstances. I wasn't even told exactly what happened at that time. Uh...If I can stop a\nmoment here because I have a sense that there was something happening...",
        "A: Yal.",
        "A: One of the things that...that I remember vividly...uh...was, of course, the fact\nthat...uh...shortly after...uh...the annexation...uh...we had to stay there. And there was\na...some obvious peculiar about celebrating festival of freedom of liberation. And I do\nremember my father sitting there at the table and saying...uh...that he really didn't have\nthe heart to do it. But we decided that we do it anyway. And I...] am sure it was the\nhardest and most difficult that we ever had. Just because it is a festival of liberation,\nand...uh...I don't need to tell you how we felt at that time. Uh...One of the...I had\nmentioned...I had mentioned...uh...Incidently I mentioned Willi Sargi, and I just want to\nadd to this that...and it's strange how sometimes little things...uh...become memories\nthat...that stand out way and beyond the significance. Because my...my sister, Leah, and\nwe actually always called her Toni for some reason so I am going to refer to her as Toni.\nUh...She had managed to blot out most of the things that happened at the time, but one\nthing she...she remembers vividly and she's told me about it two or three times. I mean\nwhenever she mentions that, I can feel it...the strong emotions tied up with it, and it's a\nlittle thing. She remembers herself walking into the house one day and Willi Sarg,\nthat...that fellow who had been friends of...uh...my family, of my brothers and possibly\nher too, was walking ahead and he opened the door and he closed it right in her face. It's\nsuch a little thing, but it will live with her as long as she lives. And so I say memories are\nstrange things because so many more horrendous things happened afterwards. Uh...At\nthat time, I was going to...the \u201d * gymnasium. That was a Jewish High School. A very,\nvery good high school. One of the two best in Vienna. Uh...And they had a very\nselect...uh...cadre of...uh... teachers. One of them was a pretty woman poetist and...uh...,\nof course, at that time, you know, the curriculum and the standards of education are very\nhigh. That school closed its door in... after I graduated...uh... in 1938. It closed its door\nfor good for over 50 years. I think they only recently reopened again, last year or so I\nthink I've heard. And I remember that...uh...when we...uh... left...uh.. on the last day of\nschool...uh...and there was a group of boys waiting outside to beat us up, but...uh...that\nwas...that was the gymnasium. Uh...I had two brothers...uh...the oldest by the name of\nGabe. He left for the United States...uh... early in 1938. He missed most of the...uh... Nazi\nperiod. I think he left...uh...uh...1n the early summer, late spring or early summer.",
        "A: We have...a part of my mother's family is American...had settled in America...uh...a\ngeneration or two ago. And they sent us affidavits and...uh...Gabe was the first one able\nto make use of it. So he went straight...uh...you know, as a important little passenger on\nthe ship, he could close the door and luckily he missed...uh... most of the terrible\nthings...uh...that happened afterwards.",
        "A: Well, ...uh...it took time. Affidavits, you know, affidavits, the processing and\neverything...uh...wasn't such a simple and easy matter. It took...uh...i1t took father almost a\nyear...uh...to get out...uh...for instance. Uh...Leo...Leo was the second one who left,\nbut...but his...uh...exodus was fraught with difficulties. In the first place, in summer he\ntried to escape over the border into France and he went with a friend by the name of .\nAnd...uh...he was caught by the French police and returned. And...uh...since...since my\nbrother was...he was a very handsome fellow and quite a personality I would say...uh...\nHe had no difficulty with the German border police and there were some SR SS men\nthere. Uh...He had no problem whatsoever and they just let him go. Yal. And he returned\nto Vienna. And I...I still remember him coming up the street. I happened to be outside,\nand he was tanned and he...he...he looked so wonderful, like somebody who came from\nthe mountain already or something like that. Uh...Shortly after that, he...uh...he went\nagain. He escaped by Italy and by illegal ship...uh...to Palestine. So he got into Palestine,\nit was probably late summer of 1938, and when war broke out...uh... early in 1940 in\nGermany he volunteered. And he fought through all the campaigns...uh...so...uh...1n\nNorth Africa and...uh... practically the whole length of Italy.",
        "A: He was...uh...with the British army, the RASC. I think he was first in the Palestine corps.\nThere was...there was, in fact,...he was involved in a very significant rescue mission of\nJews...uh...in northern Italy who were held captive by the Gestapo and...uh...the group\nof...uh...Jewish soldiers...uh... I don't know that they were in command of the whole\ngroup or only of that particular transport of that particular truck...uh...crossed-through the\nGerman border at the time and there was only a local armistice, a local armistice between\nthe commanders and the Germans were still armed. And they went right up to that\nparticular headquarter, and the Gestapo had fled at that time. And they took all over a 100\nJews back to...to Rome. I have to say, however, that my brother told me about this only\nonce and that is when I saw him for the first time in 1953. Uh...That is...uh... practically\n15 years after...uh...the Nazi invasion or Nazi annexation out of Austria. And we had a\nlong talk in Israel. He told me once about it and never talked about it again and...uh...now\nthat I have a chance, I am going to try to get historical documentation because my brother\nwas...uh... a rather quiet and extremely restrained sort of person and he...he's never\nmentioned it again. And I think it was a significant...was a very significant...uh... episode.\nAs a matter of fact he told me that when they came back to Rome, he formed...uh... the\nAmerican Army and said that he instructions from British Headquarters that here was a\ngroup of people who had to be taken care of and...uh...they...they were obviously people\nin very poor condition of health. Yal. So he surrended them...he surrended them to...to the\nAmericans and he said to them when...when they first arrived and the Jews saw them,\nsomething fell underneath and said they were angels. ....school. My parents registered\nme in a...in a training course for carpenters. There were a number of different (clearing\nthroat) vocational courses being given under the auspices of...uh...the Coltis Commander,\nwhich was the Jewish...uh...uh...organization, the Organization of Jewry in Vienna. And I\nguess the idea was (a) since I would have to leave and they tried to send me out as early\npossible because obviously every day was..uh...I was threatened there...uh...to get me out\nof harm's way, to get me away from the apartment which was a trap and also to give\nsome qualifications, some sort of another. And...uh... I remember...and I am going a little\nahead and I will afterwards go backward, but I am going a little ahead of time because I\nremember on the day of the Kristallnacht which I believed was the 9th to the 11th of\nNovember, 1938. I was in that carpentry workshop and there was a call on the telephone\nand the manager of the shop...uh... went to the phone and listened very seriously and then\nhe turned to us and said, \"There is some action on the way and you will be safer at\nhome.\" I am going to talk abut this in detail a little later on because there was lots of\nthings that happened in between. And I want to talk about them now. Uh...First of\nall,...uh...a... a number of times...uh...the Nazis came to our place, to our apartment. They\ncame to our apartment. They weren't exactly break-ins, but they weren't exactly visits\neither because these people came and..uh... they didn't bother to ring the bell or knock on\nthe door. They...they generally beat on the door with their boats so we knew exactly what\nkind of gentlemen were waiting out there.",
        "A: Yes. Please.",
        "A: That's fine. Take your time. Take some water.\nand, consequently, in his mind he lost the...uh...the very reason for existence. He lost the\nstructure of his life. Uh...He...uh...became so sick that every day he had attacks that he\nsimply...uh... fell unconscious. He became unconscious. I remember he did the blood\ndrained from his face. His face became ashen. He sank back and for about 10, 15 minutes\nhe was as if dead. And then he always recovered. And that happened day after day, day\nafter day, day after day. Yal. You can imagine what kind of impact it had on me. At least\nit's difficult to imagine, really difficult to imagine. Uh...I later on, I subsequently learned\n(clearing throat) from a sister that these were epileptic attacks. He had developed\nepilepsy. I didn't even know that at the time. Uh...his...hair, which had always been\nblond, turned gray in a week. So, and he had always had heart trouble and so on. So when\nthe Nazis came on one occasions, this was , I heard my mother say, \"Why don't you take\nme. He's a...he's a very sick man. He has a very sick heart. Why don't you take me\ninstead?\" And the Nazi looked at her. There were two of them. And one said, you know,\n\"Lock your door. We are going to say that nobody is home. And don't open for anybody.\"\nAnd they left. On another occasion, and I am mentioning the little...the little visit at first.\nOn another occasion...uh...they came and they asked for...1f there were any males around,\nany men. I was the only one. And...uh...I always looked about 5 years younger. That was\nas a result of eating so badly I guess. And it was really what saved me from the\nconcentration camp. (Clearing throat) Because he looked at me and he thought I was\nabout 10, and I was really 14. (Laughter) He didn't even bother to say anything. He just\nturned around. It's like...uh...throwing a little fish back, you know, and left. That was the\nsecond visit. The third one, and I don't know whether I have the order correctly because\nmemories are strange. You remember things vividly, but you don't always remember the\norder in which they happened. Uh...About at least 3 or 4, this SR man came to our\napartment in and I remember at that time, this...this must have been before mid-summer\nbecause I was still in school. I remember I was in school because I had visited a friend by\nthe name of Amile Krueger. He was a genius in mathematics and I was excellent in Latin,\nthe Classics and Literature, so we used to help each other. And I was visiting his place\nand came home and as I knocked on the door, either the moment I knocked on the door or\njust a little before I heard noises in the apartment and knew they were not noises from my\nfamily. I still remember I was rooted by fear, and I had an immediate impulse for flight.\nBut whether it was solidarity or fear or whatever it was or the swiftness with which things\nhappen, I didn't turn...turn away, and the door opened and instead of my mother, there\nwas this giant man. And I was pulled in somehow...uh...and there was my father, mother\nand myself. My sister was married at the time and she had a separate apartment, not too\nfar from us. And there was Fritzi Shaumberger, our maid, and they made us stand against\nthe wall. I was in the which 1s...uh...the...uh..the foyer, the lobby, you know. It's a sort of\nL shape, very long L shaped room. They made us stand against the wall by the corner\nwindow and one of them shouted, Where's the gold? Where've you hidden the gold?\"\nThese were very primitive people. Yal. They must have thought we were Fort Knox or\nsomething. I mean, gold. I know my mother had a wedding ring, but...uh...hidden gold,\nburied it. Uh...My father said, \"We have no gold.\" So they stood us against the wall. They\ntook out their pistols and they put the pistol on our chest. It was father, mother and\nmyself. And father said to them...and Fritzi Shumberger, the maid, was standing in the\ndoorway of the kitchen and watching... What could she do really? And father said, \"Why\ndon't you shoot us?\" And I am quoting almost verbatim. He said, \"I'd rather you shoot us\nstraight away than have this insult and...uh...indignity, you know, without end.\" And\nactually that...that...that...uh...brings up another memory in my mind. They didn't shoot\nus. Uh...They...at that time apparently didn't have the authority to do that. Or possibly\nthey were still after the gold and you can't get gold from dead Jews, whatever the case\nmay be. And they took my father away. They took him to our business. At that time it\nwas still in our possession in the district, and my brother, Leo, was still there at the time.\nAnd I remember Leo had some money somewhere on an inside pocket, but he said he had\nno money. You see we needed that money desperately because...uh...there was no\nbusiness anymore and we knew that without money, we won't be able to get out.\nSo...uh...they didn't find the money on him. We were always walking on a tight rope. Yal.\nWhether the arrested father at the time or not, I do not know. I know Father was arrested\nat least twice. But...uh...my mother and I were locked into the kitchen after they left. And\nthey left this SR man to guard us. This marshall of people, you know, these heroic\nfigures, the Aryonrosher...superman in their imagination. I had learned to be\ncontemptuous of anti-Semites and I will come back to this...uh...afterwards, but in any\ncase, I was a very, restless, impatient sort of person and I had inherited a little bit of the\ntemper from my father. And all the time that temper was rising within me and remember\nI was a book worm. It was never clear when I left the world of reality and walked over\ninto a world of imagination. Yal. In the world of imagination, I was just a I mean I...So\neventually, I got so fed up, I got so angry in the kitchen I said to my mother, \"I have to do\nhomework and they prevent me from doing the homework and I am going\nto...to...uh...take them to task over this.\" And I don't know if my mother tried to restrain\nme, but, you know, what could she do. I went out and I confronted this Nazi and said,\n\"You know that I am supposed to do my homework. I am supposed to bring it in\ntomorrow and if I can't do it because of you, you will come with me tomorrow and you\nwill come to the teacher. Yal. And you tell her whose responsible for this. Yal.\" He didn't\nknow how to cope with this. And...and this is where my memory ends. I really do not\nknow what happened, you know. He didn't beat me up. That is for sure because I would\nhave remembered that. Yal. But whether I was allowed to do the homework or whether\nthey pushed me inside again or what, I...I do not recall. That...that was one visit. Uh...Our\nflat...our apartment was...was broken in on another occasion. We don't know who did it. I\nshould imagine it was done really by so-called \u2019\u2019in courte officials because...uh...the\napartment was sealed by the Nazis. And...uh...",
        "A: It was sealed. Sealed by Gestapos. We were not allowed to enter again. It was just sealed.\nIt was put under seal, lock and seal.",
        "A: I...1...I'll tell you that. Probably...Actually...we actually went to our sister. If my sister\nhadn't been there, well, I guess we still had a...I still had a aunt. They had a very small\napartment. But we...we lived with our sister for the...for the last 2 or 3 months...uh...\nUh...What happened there was that I had...whatever money we had left... don't know\nwhether at that time we had already lost the business or not, but in any case, there was\nlittle business and people wouldn't pay us anyway even if we supplied. Uh...So we had no\nmoney coming 1n and so we had a substantial business but you know as a businessman,\nwe weren't that rich. We had some money left to pay for expenses to move out or what,\nbut whatever money we had left was our lifeline for escape. And I had become extremely\nadept at hiding things and at finding things. And the reason why I had become adept was\nthat, as I told you, I was a book worm and I would read through libraries. I mean literally\nshelf after shelf cause I remember my mother would take me to a worker's library 1n this,\nI believe they called them, you know. The Social Democrats built wonderful apartment\nbuildings in Vienna. They...they become quite well renowned. And they had libraries\nthere and health clinics and...uh...kindergarten and gardens inside. It was really a splendid\nworld. Yal. And they had these libraries, and my mother would take me there and for me\nthis was a paradise. And actually as I remember, they were really little rooms, but the\nglorious thing was there was these bookcases and they were stacked with books from the\nfloor to the ceiling and I knew that each book was a world. And it just entranced me. Yall.\nAnd I would read indiscriminately, but they were mostly good books. They were...at\nhome also we had, our saloon was stacked. We had all the classics. At that time we had\npaperbacks also the crown books they were called. That was before the Penguins. And I\nknew all the classics and I knew the Russians and the French, the dossiers and all these\npeople. But my mother used to hide books from me that were classics even because they\nwere too serious. For instance,...uh...and what an innocent world it was at the time, for\ninstance...uh...and , Crime and Punishment. I am mentioning this because it later on plays\nactually a role. However, there was no place they could hide a book that I didn't find.\nAnd...uh...the most peculiar place that my mother found was the stove pipe, you know, in\nthe saloon and I found that too because I always...I put myself in her place. Now\nwhere...where would I hide something. A book...a book isn't such a small object you see.\nSo I became extremely skilled in nosing out things, where they might be hidden, and\nhiding things. And I was the person consequently selected...you see how negative\nqualities become virtues in a world that's gone crazy...to hide whatever money we had\nleft. And what I did, and that was just before our apartment was ransacked and sealed,\nwas...uh...we had these brass beds which had hollow legs and you could unscrew\nthe...uh...the wheels. So I stuffed some money up there in the legs and then we had\ncurtain rods that were also brass. Hugh things! And I stuffed some money there. Actually,\nyou could only get them out with very, very long thin stick. Yal. The Nazis, however,\nwho were never book worms, never learned...uh...to learn to look..to look for things\n(laughter), you know, in those little hollow hiding places. And they never found the\nmoney. Now, then the apartment, after the apartment was sealed, and we were\nordered...and we had no money... Yal. We were literally penniless. So one day, Mother\ntook me to the Gestapo headquarters...Central City...It was in the hotel. I forgotten the\nname of the hotel. And I want to explain to you exactly what happened because I vividly\nremember every moment of it. And, of course, she had me by the arm, you know, and we\nwalked in and there was this...this splendid lobby. And there were people standing\naround. I don't whether they wore uniforms or not, but there were people in there. It was\na lovely place, and there was a spiral staircase to the right and at the foot of the staircase\nwas a Soldier. I believe he was a soldier and not a SR man. He might have been a SR\nman, but I seemed to remember he was a soldier. (Clearing throat) Sorry. And he had a\nrifle there with a bayonet, a naked bayonet planted in...uh...the...uh...what you call\nthat?...the...uh... on top of the rifle planted there. And as we came in, he jumped mother\nand he saw a woman with...with a child there and he immediately decided we're Jewish\nand he shot at something like . They used this expression. It's like 1s like sow. It's a\nfemale pig, you know. And they combined it with...with the term Jew. And for them that\nwas the way to call us. And he...he...he advanced the rifle into a ready position and that's\nanother heroic measure...here's a woman with a child. Yal. And he made some kind of\nthreatening movement, and my mother brushed by him as if he didn't exist. Yal. Totally\nignored him. And he was an attack dog who...who had not been instructed how to deal\nwith a situation like that. And this is what happened sometimes 1n those situations. If you\nwere really plucky or if you were desperate to the point that you didn't\ncare...uh...sometimes you overwhelmed them. Sometimes. But you had to have some\npresence in that control. As I said something that I learned in school early. However, it\ndidn't stand...it didn't help me in this situation because when we came in I was so\nembarrassed. It was, of course, a mixture of embarrassment and fear, but I honestly think\nit was about 90 percent or 80 percent embarrassment. I was a very shy youngster, and\nhere everybody was looking at us. And I was pulling at my mother's arms...let's get out of\nhere, you know. I was so ashamed. Yal. Just to be in the center of attraction, even if it\nhadn't been for...even it had been for purposes. But my mother let me go. I ran out of the\nhotel, but I was sufficiently able to see her, to watch her go up the staircase. Well, my\nmother came out of this hotel with the key to our apartment. You have seen her\nphotograph. She was a very impressive person and somehow when no matter who, like\nthe Nazi, the SR man...the underling who came, and who must have had a spark of\nhumanity in his mind and who left without doing any harm to us and even cautioned us to\nlock up and not open to anybody. And here...this Gestapo officials of high rank, because\nthey were the officials in the headquarters and they gave her the keys. But they gave her\nthe key for 24 hours...24 hours or 48 hours. I think 24 hours. It was enough for us to go\nin, take the money out that we had there and so make it possible for us to survive. That\nwas the second substantial visit. It was really not a visit. It was...uh...say...1t was really a\nbreak-in to our apartment. Subsequently, of course, she returned the key. Uh...Now...Now\nI want to...to...to go back or to go forward rather to speak about the Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Right. Okay. Good.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: Alright. Uh...Yal. Just before I go to Kristallnacht, there's something really significant I\nhave to mention. As I said, Father...Father was a broken man because....uh...he had lost\nhis business. Essentially, he had lost, in his eyes, his role. His role was that of protector.\nAnd now he couldn't protect us. Mother, on the other hand, had gained a role because she\nhad to do everything she had done before and more. And she was always...uh...a\nhousewife, a house person. So Mother became stronger but Father just broke. And Father\nwanted to die. He...he wanted...he wanted...as a matter of fact, he really wanted that all of\nus should commit suicide. And...and not only, and as I told you before, that he lost\nconsciousness...uh...every day and it was really a death that he wished. He wanted us all\nto die. He wanted that all of us should commit suicide. It was the only way out that...that\nhe saw possible. And every time that a Jewish family that we knew had chosen this\npath...had committed suicide... In one case I remember he was talking abut the family that\nwent out to the cemetery and they committed suicide at the grave site, probably of their\nparents. He came home and he said, \"What a wonderful thing these people did. We\nshould do the same thing.\" Uh...",
        "A: My mother very quietly...uh...I...I...1 don't even remember her saying anything. She just\ndidn't accept his advice. Yes. But all the time what had happened inside of me was in\nsituations like this...uh...something grows up between you and your world, the world\noutside. It's...it's that wall that I talked about before, which had started to build up and\nyou can really only survive at a very, very significant price. And the price is...uh...that\nyou detach yourself from your emotions and when you lose your emotions...when you\nlose your connection with your feeling, you essentially become...uh...an automated...you\nessentially become a sort of person drained of vitality because you don't want to\nexperience what is happening around you, so you can't experience anything. Uh...And\nonce that happens...it isn't something...it's not like shoes you can put on and take off...and\nactually it sometimes lasts in some ways a life time. Not in that horrendous form, but I\nwill explain to you later how I emerged from all this into England. But it\ncertainly...uh...helps you escape and...uh... Unfortunately, we didn't know. The world\ndidn't know how to cope with this psychological situation at the time so they thought you\ngot out of it. Let's forget it. And that is essentially what happen, except you may forget it,\nbut it doesn't forget you and...uh...it just goes on living within you. Alright. Uh...The\nKristallnacht and its generally known that...uh...what triggered it was...uh...the\nassignation by a young Jewish boy...I think his name was...uh...Green...",
        "A: Greenspan. Yal. Who had...uh....shot...uh... some German official at the Paris...the\nGermany Embassy in Paris by the name of\u201d *. Because...uh...they had...uh...I believe\nkilled his parents.",
        "A: Okay. Uh...I was on Kristallnacht, actually that day I was...I was in the carpentry\nworkshop. And...uh...I mentioned before the telephone call came so when the manager of\nthe workshop took the call and turned to us and said, \"Look. There is something going on\nin town. You'll be better off at home.\" We knew immediately what...what is going to be.\nWe packed our...our stuff and...uh...we...uh... went...went home. I remember...I had\nforgotten where this ...this carpentry workshop was, but I should imagine by the\nappearance of the...uh...the neighborhood because I was waiting for a train. I took a train,\nbut I know what kind of...uh... streets we went through. Uh...It seemed to have been the\ninner city which is an unusual place for a workshop because these were splendid\nbuildings. And I remember standing...you see the...the...the trains in Vienna had an open\nplatform...uh...either at...at the rear end so you could easily jump on and off and you\ncould be standing there. And I was standing along side. It was close to me. There was an\nelegant couple and, you know, in those times when people were elegant, they were\nelegant. There was a very attractive lady and she was dressed in a beautiful silk dress it\nseemed to me, and a gentlemen and she was looking at the newspaper and seeing\nsomething and she turned to the man and said, \"Look at this terrible things they're doing\nto the Jews in Germany. Surely, this couldn't happen here.\" I remember those words\nbecause...uh...first of all, there are a lot of... Really, the only words I remember from\nthat...from that period actually spoken because within a few seconds or a few minutes or\nmoments or very short time after that, we passed a side street. The train went on a side\nstreet and there was this magnificent temple in flames. And there was a Jew in costume\nwith a long beard. Obviously he must have been praying in the synagogue and he was\nrunning and there was a crowd running after him and he was like one of those you know,\nin the classic books that I was reading. Uh...with a poem by Sheller about a Kraut chasing\nsomething or other. And you flash by. I mean the train, you know, how long does it take.\nIt was just a. And it was an ironic commentary on what that lady said...uh..to the man. I\nremember coming home, which was actually the apartment of my sister and...uh...there I\nknocked on the door and you must...and you must...uh...not remember because you don't\nknow of this, but bear in mind that these were heavy reinforced doors with not only\nmassive...uh...wood, but also not the kind of plywood that is used now, but genuine oak\nor something like, but also...uh...uh...steel bars inside. There's a whole...there's a whole\nsteel door inside. So these were fortresses. I don't know why they were fortresses because\nthere were very few thefts there. But nonetheless, at least before the Nazis, in which case\nthese were really thefts, but...uh...these...these doors were difficult to break down. When I\ncame home they very cautiously opened the door. My...I found there my...my...my\nmother, my sister and her baby. Her baby was...uh...only about 2 months old at the time.\nRose was born in August 1938. So I can...I can position this in time because I...she was\nborn in August 1938. I left on the 18th of December 38. Of course, it's the Kristallnacht,\n11th of November. Well, I knew that before. So...uh...she was 2 months...2 months old.\nAnd Father wasn't there. I believe he must have been arrested. And...uh...my brother-in-\nlaw had been arrested. My...my sister says that happened on the morning of the\nKristallnacht, but at any rate I know that he was...uh...sent to Dachau and he was in\nDachau in fact over...over half a year. Uh...How he got out of it alive, but...uh..and he\nwent through terrible time there. In any case, when I came home, something strange\nhappened. I mean I was always the youngster, the kid and so on. And now I...I was the\nonly man. And I don't know whether this is some genetics or the biology of relatives, I\njust...[...the diffident, the shy, the book worm and so on, assumed control quite naturally\nand I said, \"If somebody comes, we won't open the door. We just don't open.\" And\nthis...well, my sister was always a person...my sister was not a person who was very\nassertive. In any case, she would have taken a rather quiet role in the background. But my\nmother was a very courageous person. But I think as a result of all that had happened...of\nwhat happened to Father...of the fact that both of them were arrested, she became...she\nwas very quiet and she just accepted...uh...my suggestion without any demurring. Well,\nwe didn't have to wait long. Shortly after, it was before lunch time, we heard these...uh...\nvery well known...uh... boots beating on the door and they weren't just beating on the\ndoor, generally accompanied by shouts...open up this that and so on. We didn't open.\nAnd I think probably...I have gone through some different phases in my life, but this must\nhave been one of them because...uh... we tiptoed into the kitchen and so as not to be seen\nfrom outside or so we were on the fifth floor, but the house was built around the court\nyard and you could have looked in from the opposite wing. So we had to stand pressed\nagainst the wall. And my sister had to put her hand on the mouth of the baby. It was a 2\nmonth old baby. And always be afraid that either she might stifle her inadvertently or that\nthe baby would cry. And here these men were battering on the door and you know, with\nthe jack boots you can subject a door to some treatment and it went on, it seemed to me,\nfor an eternity. And what went through my mind was the scene of in Crime and\nPunishment. was a criminal. Yal. But nonetheless, it was a scene of the most...and they\nwere standing there in, I believe in the kitchen, after having committed the deed, and they\nhear some...some steps going up and then the door rattling and he is afraid that the lock\nmight...might open up because...uh...this...uh...was just some...some kind of...uh... what\ndo you call it in English? It's...uh...we call it a..It wasn't...1t wasn't locked with a key, but\nit was locked with some...some kind of mechanical device.",
        "A: Uh...And that scene flashed through my mind because I was always living half in the\nbook and half outside. And then we...and we could hear everything that was going on\noutside and then...uh...one man said to the other...apparently, he was the leader of the\ngroup. He said to the other, \"or whatever the name was, Go down and fetch a crow bar.\"\nAnd this fellow went down. And, of course, our...way back...uh...was closed. We couldn't\nopen. They would have thrown us out the window. At that moment, the door from a\nneighboring apartment opened and there was a woman... I had never spoken to her.\nMother had never spoken to her. I don't know whether my daughter knew her. She was a\nGentile obviously. And she said, \"You know, I saw them go out about a hour ago. You're\nwasting your time\"...or words to that effect. You could hear everything in that apartment.\nYou could hear things through the door. And they went away. And in the afternoon, they\ncame back. And, of course, I had said, \"Look. They come back in the afternoon. We open\nimmediately. I don't want to go through this again.\" Yal. So when they came, we opened\nstraight away. But I, you know, my temper was...was sort of moving up, you know, again\nand I decided that I was going to sit at...uh... the coffee table in the saloon...uh...drinking\na cup of coffee or tea or whatever was there as if...uh... I couldn't care a damn about what\nwas going on, just to show my disdain, you understand. I thought that this would make a\nsignificant impression. I was really, you know, half serious, half child...uh. And that's\nwhat I did. And they came in and my sister had...uh...a side porch, you know with sliding\nglass doors and she displayed all kinds of...uh...lots of precious things...porcelain,\ncrystal...uh...the things that you got for our wedding...uh...heirlooms, stuff of that sort.\nAnd, of course, they were after it. And one of the Nazis, a kind of clumsy fellow, who\nhad never handled doors like this tried to open and he sort of fumbled around and he\ncouldn't figure out how this...this door opened. Yal. Because the only door probably that\nhe...he got to know was the door on hinges. And I could see him sort of...I could almost\nread his mind...and holding his foot, his leg up in order to kick the door in, and I jumped\nup. Yal. And confronted him as much as I could confront him. I mean my head was\nprobably the height of his breast bone. And I said you know...and I again remember the\nwords verbatim...there are two ways of opening this door. I said, \"One is you lift your leg\nand kick it in like that, and I just imitated what he was doing, and the other one is like this\nand I put out one little finger and I just made the door open. And don't you think that's a\nbetter way. And I looked him in the face and he looked back and no words were\nexchanged...no further word was exchanged between us. And, of course, they packed all\nthe stuff up and took it away and walked out. And that was another visit. It was the most\nterrible because of what happened in the morning and that could have easily ended up, as\nI say, with our flying out of the window. Uh...If you don't mind, a few things occur to me.\nI want to go back to them. First of all (clearing throat), there was first of all two...two\npersonal encounters and...uh...that I think of. Uh...I had...I told you before that I had...I\nhad learned in some way that in certain critical situations I could face up to things and\nsomehow assert control. It was almost a kind of...uh...psychological insight...some...some\nmeasure of certainty that I had at the time. Some...some voice that came to me from\noutside myself. And I remember that one of the times it happened was even before the\nNazis came in. Uh...It was winter time and I was dressed...uh...in a very nice winter coat.\nIt was a new coat. with a herringbone and a velvet collar. And here was a much bigger\nboat but ragged, obviously from very poor circumstances who came up and our steps met\nat the corner and I knew that he wasn't going to shake my hands. I realized that he was\ngonna beat me up. And I always had empathy for the underdog. I had a very, very strong\nempathy. I had really always a strong heart for poor people, for animals, for all things of\nthat sort, and I felt ashamed actually of my...of our circumstances. Even so, God\nknows,...uh...I was luxuriating my...the presence of the coat with normally books, you\nknow, or games of skills. They never bought me a model set because I might break my\nleg or something, which I probably would have (chuckle) if they bought me one. But I\nalways had that...that feeling that...uh...I felt uncomfortable of having more than\nsomebody else and so I didn't have to fake anything. I...I really had an understanding for\nhim and a feeling for him. And it may have been this fact that sort of edged away fear\nbecause it took the place of fear. It was...it was the feeling that possessed me. And I said\nto him...uh...\" You know, I want...uh...there's something I want to tell you.\" And I said it\nin a way that...uh...somehow or other seemed to engage him, seemed to engage his\ninterest. I was listening and I told him about the fact that I wanted to go to Palestine and\nthat many of us, even those of us who come from so-called...uh...homes that were more\naffluent really wanted to choose this life for ourselves and that I understand where he\ncame from and understand his circumstances that...that many of...of friends of mine,\npeople I know have chosen a life of work on the land, hard work. Yal. And there wasn't\nreally as much difference between us as might appear. And that I wasn't responsible for\nthe fact that...that he was poor and that he was in difficult circumstances and we almost\nbecame friendly and they told...he told me about the fact that his father was beating him\nup and so on and so forth and, you know, his father was a drunkard. But I will never\nforget the words that he said to me at the end and the words were...and this was a poor,\nmaybe semi-literate, ragged youth, maybe a year before the Nazis came...I would say\nabout... He says, \"You know, Hitler is going to come here and then I am sorry...I am\ngoing to be sorry for all of you.\" And these are words that I have forgotten easily. That\nwas one encounter. The other one was already under the...under the Nazis. I was...uh...I\nthink walking home at the time and...it was and it was the place where our shul was, the\nlittle synagogue. Uh...There were sitting in the front pew. My father incidentally was the\nvice-president of the other group, which 1s...which was a Zionist philanthropic\norganization. And my father was very active in public affairs and as a philanthropist,\nsomething that once saved him from the Nazis because I remember in a\nprocession...procession that came by, and I was sort of listening at the window, and\nsomebody was shouting, \"Let's take old Schmeltzer,\" and...uh...somebody else said, \"Oh,\nleave him. At least he helps his own kind.\" So strange things happened...uh...even in\nthose times. There was this shul in the and I was not far away. As a matter of fact,\nmidway up that street, in the where our shul was. Our shul was at the corner of the where\nwe lived in this. Midway up there was a restaurant at that time. And as I was walking...\nprobably...I don't remember exactly whether I was walking home or walking away\nfrom...at any rate I suddenly was surrounded by something like a dozen boys. It was like\na ring around me. And there were closing in on me. And it was clear that they were going\nto beat me up. All of them! Together! And again that particular sense came over me that\nallowed me to detach myself from my personal circumstance and take on another voice.\nIt was almost as if I was reading a book. And imagination has its place at times. And I\nsaid to them...I... raised my hand because I realized you know, I have to do something\nthat attracts attention...I raised my hand at the time and said, \"Look. Before you beat me\nup, I have something interesting to tell you. And, of course, you know, rich boy...\nmean...everybody is curious...1 mean no matter what. I said, You know, what's happening\nhere. There's a dozen of you Gentiles, Christians who want to beat up one of me, one\nJew. Now what are you doing there. You're really declaring that one Jew is as good as 12\nof you.\" And that...that sort of...that sort of made them look up. Yal. And I said, \"I am\ngoing to tell the Nazi party about it and, you see, they'll be very angry at you.\" (Laughter)\nGod knows where this came from. Yal. It's really absolutely absurd. It's ridiculous, but it\nsomehow engaged their attention and they started to discuss this matter amongst each\nother. (Laughter) Because they were as little...uh...learning. They had just...they picked\nup anti-Semitism probably from early childhood because it was endemic in Austria. And\nas they were discussing things, a little gap opened. They...you know, at one point they\ndrew apart. It was just enough for me to flee through and I ran. At that time the person\nwho held the world's record in long distance running was a fellow called ...I think I\noutran him. I ran so fast up, away from our home, up the to which was a parallel street, a\nvery, very magnificent. Well, it's a very lively vital street that led up to the ticket of the I\nover took a train and remember I told you they had these open platforms and I jumped up\nand there weren't sufficiently close to me. I mean they couldn't overtake me and they\ncouldn't get on the train and so I got away that particular time. Now I had mentioned\nsomething about shuls. I want to go back to this because something else comes up in my\nmind. A year before I had Bar Mitzvah and I remember standing in front of the mirror in\nour L-shaped hall, the one that I described to you before. My mother plunked some kind\nof blue hat on me which almost blotted my face out. I had this little round face you know,\nand I was frightened out of my wits, and I was led to...uh...the shul almost like a calf to\nslaughter and I had to give this long you know which was half in Hebrew and half in\nGerman and these...these were long affairs and you had to know them by heart. It took at\nleast half an hour or later. Yal. You studied it for it months. And I remember (clearing\nthroat) I stood there and I looked at the people and the shul was full of people and my\nheart sank. This was definitely not a moment of control. And my voice said bye bye, just\ntook leave of me and when I opened my voice...my mouth, almost no voice came out.\nYal. And my teacher, Hebrew teacher...his name was Daft, D A F T...was a young,\nmodern man actually. He sat behind me and he leaned forward at this point and he said to\nme, \"You know, if Mussolini can do it, you can do it.\" I mean, again, outrageous\nstatement, but this man understood something in me because I got so enraged at the fact\nthat this is doing something and I can't doing it....Yal...that I completely forgot myself\nand I delivered a splendid oratory and everybody was weeping and the last one who\nwasn't weeping was my sister and I considered this as a personal affront. And then I sort\nof focused my look. I beamed it at her like a lazer beam and I said one or two sentences\nas I glazed and then she started weeping. I was very happy. And then our...our family\ndoctor, Frye, he was crying too. Everybody was crying (laughter) in that synagogue.\nNow, I...I mention this because Daft, who was my teacher, under the Nazi unfortunately\nsomething very tragic befell of him...befell him. One day his wife came to my mother and\nshe was literally wringing her hands and said she doesn't know what to do because her\nhusband had simply become mad. He picked up a knife. He said that she wanted to\npoison him. She was afraid of her life. She was afraid to go to the authorities. And...here\nyou had a world of madness inside in response to madness outside...uh... It was literally a\nworld where all the controls, all the dams broke. Uh...And I don't really know what\nhappened. But I do know that I once visited his place. That was in the good times before\nmy Bar Mitzvah and I was so impressed by the stacks of books he had and there was and\nI read the title of every one....\nEND OF TAPE 2, SIDE 2\nservice people of medical who were guarding the prisoners inside. And they were\noutside. And inside were hundreds of German prisoners of war. And these were giants.\nThey were sailors. They were apparently caught...uh...you know either on the ships or\nwhatever. You can imagine. Here was a group of 30, 40 young Jewish school children, all\nfrom whatever happened in Europe and...uh...I think...I don't want to be adamant about it.\nI seemed to remember there was swastika flags inside. Yal. But I am not going to sign\nthat underwriting. Uh...Certainly, there was..uh..a planned Nazi atmosphere also. Yal.\nThere were no demonstrations against us. It was just enough to see these fellows around\nand we in the midst. There were only 30, 40 of us and we were children..very young boys\nof 16. None was older than 16. There were only a few Polish among them. Then what\nhappened was... we were about 2 or 3 months in that camp. What happened was that\nsome of us were Orthodox. Now I wasn't Orthodox myself, but some of us were\nOrthodox, and they were strictly kosher, and they would not eat a non-kosher food. And\nthere was no provision for non-kosher food, and we all declared solidarity with those who\nwere Orthodox. So they wouldn't eat non-kosher food. We didn't eat non-kosher food.\nThe result of it we were all starving and we were literally starving because...uh...all you\ncould eat was cheese...uh...when...when it was served. And I remember the mostly\nseemed to serve meat which we couldn't eat. Yal. And I ate plenty of toast with jam\nbecause I was working in the kitchen. I was very partial to toast and jam, must have eaten\nso much I couldn't stand it anymore. But we were literally starving and in the end became\nso...uh...drained of strength...uh...that sometimes...sometimes we were lying out there on\nthe grass and we couldn't even...hardly could get up. We were really that much\nweakened. I remember the Polish lad that was...I told you about this man, this , who\nbecome a friend of mine, was giving us daily lectures and he had extensive knowledge in\nvarious areas. And I remember in biology in particular, biology and literature and history\nand politics. These were his main subjects...and in psychology. And this man was so well\nread that through the three months he could give us daily lectures of 2 or 3 hours every\nday... Yal...and really have us riveted. And...and through this camp, there passed different\ngroups. Someones, there was a group of Jewish adults and of a group of Italian adults. I\nremember the Italian were so different from the Germans. They transformed the...the\ncamp into a soccer stadium. Yal. You know, I...I later make friends with Italians. I love\nthese people. I mean they are just so human. Prison or no prison, they were kicking that\nball around. Yal. So different from the very...and I am not saying this against the German\nas such, but they were very solemn and stodgy. Yal. There was no note of joy.\nNothing...nothing to remember. One thing was they all...a lot of them carved things. They\nwere wonderful at carving things. They made little sailing boats that you could push\nthrough the neck of a bottle you know. And I watched that and they carved pipes with all\nkinds of...uh...legendary monsters with shaped faces on them. One day, one of the Nazis\nthere...uh...was named Putsy Humstanker. Now I am saying this from just hearing about\nit. But Putsy Humstanker, I was told was a friend of Hitler's. How he had gotten\nhimself...uh...captured or what, I don't know. And...and I was told that he was...he was a\nfellow who played piano, entertained with Hitler's piano and so on. Putsy Humstanker\ncame to us one afternoon drunk and he said, \"Look. The Germans are plotting to get rid\nof you. And I am your friend.\" Yal. Such friends I can do without, but...we weren't. So,\nwe couldn't look to the British where we could say. They weren't...[ mean they were\noutside. Uh...We armed ourselves with clubs, this, that and the other and sit guards at\nnight, but you know in a sense maybe because we were young and maybe because...well,\nwe were the way we were...We would betroy slogans on our hearts and...and then and\nHebrew...uh...slogans...and so on. We did not allow the fact that we were really just a tiny\ngroup in this German sea. To the tourist to anyway. But nonetheless, there were difficult\ntimes and don't forget this was just about the time that France fell in May. I remember...I\nremember one day that we lying outside. It was also a day of marvelous summer, blue\nskies, so radiant. And not far away from us, there was a...a military...uh...Yal... a\nmilitary...uh...airport and I saw some riding from there and it was so close by that they\nskimmed over us. I was lying there with some others and we were looking up in the sky\nand there was these planes. There were so close you could see the heads of the pilots.\nAnd we could see the scarves flying up and the German bombers were up there...up deep\nin the sky up above. We could hear them them droning. And those marvelous youngsters\nwere flying straight at them. Yal. It's... You know, war is a terrible thing, but I have to\nadmit it's one of the most beautiful sights that I have seen. And to see those silver planes.\nI mean if you detach yourself from the horror and to see afterwards the denotations\nblossoming like great yellow, red flowers and then parachuting and then when the planes\nburst, there was a deeper color and then, the parachutes coming down like thistles. Yal.\nThat was an unforgettable sight. I...I felt very, very proud of those fighters that went up,\nand I am not a military person. But, 1n any case, as I said to go back or to go forward,\nFrance fell and the Germans became very cocky, very arrogant. And some of them threw\ntheir finger across the throat when they passed us. Yal. And I don't know what our\nfeelings were at the time, frankly. I think so many things had happened to us in the\nbeginning that suddenly, I didn't...I didn't function too much emotionally. Yal. Uh...And\nsuddenly, one day they decided to evacuate us to send us either to Canada or Australia. I\nam not sure. And we were...uh...meant to go on a certain ship. I believe the name was\nAndora Star. Somehow that name stuck in my mind. I always associated it with that\nparticular situation. And all the Germans...uh... in our camp were sent on the Andora Star\nand there were some Jewish people, including a brother of my brother-in-law, from other\ncamps. He was interned too, of course, who was in the Andora Star. Now we were taken\noff maybe a day or two before embarkation because...uh...Jewish...the Jewish Federation\nit. All kinds of people were working frantically behind the scenes with the home office,\nwith the war office, this that and the other thing. Look...what...this...our Jewish with\nthe... They are boys. What you want to send them to Canada or Australia for with\nGermans. They took us off the last moment. You know what happened to the Andora\nStar. It was torpedoed. My brother-in-law's brother was killed among the others and later\non when I was in again in another place called... I met one of the rare Jewish survivors of\nthat ship incidentally so I...so I...I know the story all around. And what he told me was\nthat when the ship was torpedoed, the Jews were down in the steerage. I mean they were\ndown, and the Germans and the British were up and they were close to...and they...they\ntook possession of all the lifeboats and the Jews were not allowed into the life boats and\nhe was swimming along and he said he must have been in the water a hour or so. You\ncan't measure time in that condition. And he was almost losing his last ounce of strength,\njust couldn't go on and there was this life boat near him and he managed to swim up to it\nand stretch out his hand and get hold of it. And I have to say this ironic episode that\nhappened was that a British person...a British, one of the mates of the ship, said, \"Sorry,\nold boy. You know, full up. This is not the last boat.\" And the Germans said, \"Oh, let the\npoor bastard on.\" And they pulled him up and so he was saved. Yal. And I think he must\nhave been one of the very, very, very rare Jewish survivors from the Andora Star. And\nthere was another occasion when death was just moving past me as if he didn't know\nme...or didn't know me or didn't really want to know me...uh...and...and...and\nmany...many other people have stories of this kind. And those of us who escaped...uh...\nmany of us had many escapes before you could finally get away. That takes us up\nto...uh...beyond...beyond the Andora Star and the return to...to internment to Lensfield.\nNo...We didn't return. They didn't take us out, of course. We remained in Lensfield, but\nshortly afterwards...uh...we were finally released and I remember the commandant of the\ncamp wept. Uh..There were a number of sterling British figures I have to say. Uh...As I\ntold...as I told you, Britain is one of the countries I have warm affection. It's not that\neverybody was a saint, but you make an overall appraisal of a nation, of a civilization and\nin England I loved them and my...my brother in Palestine did not. He saw...he saw the\nBritish from another...another angle, but I have to say that I experienced them in their\nown country and there are some just lovely, marvelous...uh...persons there and the\ngeneral tone is...1s...1S just lot more civilized than the one I encountered generally in\nAustria. I have to say that. Very different. Now...uh...uh...there was another officer there\nin the internment camp. We called him Auntie. We called him Auntie because he was\nsuch a passionately devoted soul. He was such a lovely man. Out of his own pockets, he\nwould buy us things...socks and undergarments and stuff. He was another one who cried\nwhen we left. Yal. He was a marvelous person. Now...Don't...don't think that every\nBritish was like this, but you don't need to meet that many persons and they do\nleave...uh...a strong...uh...1mpression behind them. Yal. They sort of light the way. It's\nalmost as if fate...uh...has decided well, you know, you've gone through this, that and the\nother. We'll send you a little light. Yal. So afterwards, when I got out of the\ninternment...uh...there was an episode and here I am not absolutely certain about\nthe...uh... timing of things or the sequence of events, but I know that my sister was\nevacuated to Spalding and I managed to be there. I managed to be for a few months there,\nworking the land, because I was then at the time on the war essential work order.\nUh...just to be close to her and I managed to survive some bombing attacks that\npractically pulled the house down over us because the Germans mistook Spalding for\nwhich was a nearby railroad station, you know. And they bombed...they released all the\nbombs on Spalding. Uh...Amongst other things...uh...they destroyed the zoo and killed a\nlot of animals there. Uh...After that I...I was in...uh...[ was in London for some time and I\ncan't date that. I know that I worked in a factory. I know that I...uh...I thought up ways of\nspeeding up production by a multiple of 2 or 3 by...because there were more machines\nthere than...than people. And I worked out a mathematical system whereby you could\nkeep 3 or 4 machines in operation, you know, only attended by | person. And you could\ndo it faultlessly. It wasn't even difficult. However, I was watched by the supervisor. You\nknow it is very strange, you know. And incidentally, I had a similar encounter because\nnot everybody in Britain was giving their best for the war effort obviously, but many did\nand many were very heroic. So again, humanity and with all its...but...uh...there was\nanother occasion in Spalding. In Spalding...uh...I worked for a period of time in the sugar\nrefinery near the laboratory and...uh...I had...uh...another encounter of a similar nature\nwhere I wanted to be a little more productive than a certain person, a certain woman\nand...uh... She then...She became so angry with me because she...because I was in the\nlaboratory...I was supposed to be testing the molasses in the various stages of preparation\nas to be come to refinement. And she spread the story about me that I was a German spy.\nBut unfortunately...fortunately, rather, she was known as a liar. Nobody paid any\ncredence to her. Uh...I was also in Cambridge. So that was a very intense time. I was also\nin Cambridge at some time...uh...but this was after I had gotten to... I returned to... It was\nin... That was a place around... You know... the great...uh...J am making and liquor\nmaking and so on. And we...we were living there in really terrible conditions. The\ndifference between and was difference between night and day...day and night rather\nbecause was an unsanitary camp. It had been condemned by the British. It had no\nfacilities, no toilet facilities even and so on and so forth. And we worked like slaves on\nthe land. I was there for about half a year. Uh...I eventually left and I went to Cambridge.\nI was followed by some of the...uh...at that time, a friend of mine, my alter ego almost\nand he went to Cambridge and...uh...I had the childish idea that I only needed to go to\nCambridge and all universities would open their door and say, \"Herr Schmeltzer, you\nknow, now you are here. Why didn't you come earlier? You see, we have just the place\nfor you.\" Well, I ended up as a gardener in College. (Laughter) And I have to tell you\nit's...1t's a really amusing little tale because at that time I was preparing...I was on one of\nmy studies. You see, in...1n Vienna because my parents' forced me to study. I didn't want\nto do it. But once I had left and I wasn't under constraint, I felt that what I most\npassionately wanted in life was to study. Yal. I always read intensively and extensively,\nyou understand. Now I wanted to study. So I thought going to Cambridge somehow or\nother was all you needed to do and say here I am and that's it. Well, as I say, I became a\ngardener and I...1 am ashamed to say I used part of my time actually for study purposes.\nWhat I did was that I...I organized the study plan to two areas. Uh...the...uh...liberal art\nthings if you like, languages and literature and that kind of stuff and grammar, I had this\nlittle notebook that I could hold in the palm of my hand. Mathematics and other\nthings...mathematics I would rake out and smooth out a plot of land, you know, and I\nwould...I would draw geometric figures and so on on the land and work them out. And\nthen I would enter them 1n a little notebook. But it turned out that the which were an\nadministrative group of they were looking behind the window sills you know in the\nstately buildings and they were observing this strange person who was drawing figures in\nthe soil, you understand. And they couldn't figure out what it was I was actually doing,\nbut it seemed to occupy me for an enormously length of periods of time and I seemed to\nbe absolutely obsessed with it. So I was eventually called there and the words that...that\n[...that they said to me were, you know, we have observed you over a period of time\nand...uh...frankly, most of the time you seemed to be scratching things in the ground or\nlooking at the palm of your hand. We couldn't figure out what it is you are doing, but you\ndidn't do enough work so I am afraid we have to fire you. So I drew myself up to...and I\nam not very enormous length at the time...I said, \"I am really ashamed of you because\nthis 1s supposed to be an intellectual...uh... institution and...uh...I can tell you that I am\nprobably more intelligent than any of the students you have, but they have lots more\nmoney than I have and if you were really an institution of learning and not of money, you\nwould say, \"Look. We really want you here as a student, but obviously you don't know\nanything about things of that sort. Good Day.\" And I walked out. And afterwards I was\nreally kind of...I was almost trembling because I wasn't... wasn't cock sure at all. Yal. I\nthink it was...1t was part of my general nature. Anger that was kind of spilling out, you\nknow. In retrospect...uh...there was very little...they... they... they...that they could do\nabout it. I guess they were only acting according to their best understanding of the way\nthe world worked. And I was little...a bit outside the scheme of things. So after\nCambridge I thought...I almost...almost was 18. I wanted to volunteer to be a fighter pilot.\nMaybe this period of the planes flying over...also the fact...the fact that I...I just wanted\nto...to...1 wanted revenge.",
        "A: Alright. Yal.",
        "A: Yal. I can.... can Yal. I can do that. Uh... Because it doesn't take too long time. The fact\nof the matter is that I...volunteered as a fighter pilot and...uh...I went through medical\nexamination. There were examinations and they seemed to work out well, but I did get a\nletter eventually...sorry they couldn't take me. They didn't take any at the time. And I\nwasn't called an...I was an Austrian Jew. Austria was an enemy. So in England I was an\nAustrian. I was an enemy. In Austria I was a Jew. I fell between the cracks. Uh...At that\ntime I could have volunteered for the corps, but I wasn't going to be in a service corps. I\nwant to be in a fighting unit. I thought...again, here my childish naivet\u00e9 came\nthrough...that if I...that the moment they allowed us to..to...volunteer to join a...a combat\nunit...uh...I would be allowed to join my brother. It was again a strong urge that I had to\njoin...and I always worshiped...I really worshipped my brother even so he sometimes beat\nme up. I have to say that. But he was a great person. He was really one of the heroes in\nmy life. And there are not many of them. maybe, in retrospect, was the great hero, but\nLeo of my family was not among them. And I had the feeling...somebody told me, one of\nthe person recruitment said to me, \"Yes, you...you volunteer and we'll send you wherever\nyou want to go.\" I believed it. Of course (laugh), you see, the moment we were allowed\nto volunteer for the combat unit...I volunteered and I was...uh...accepted. That...1t took\nsome time because I only joined in the early 43 I believe it. It wasn't 43 for sure. I don't\nhave the date on me exactly.",
        "A: Well, first of all we went through 16...16 weeks of training. You know there was 6\nweeks and then 10 weeks.",
        "A: I was...I was sent to a mountain unit, the... I think it was the 52nd Division and I am\nquoting from my memory and...uh...this was a division that was essentially stationed in\nthe northern mountains of Scotland where the snow and ice conditions are at least where\nwe went into training, not where the general camp was. It approximated the conditions in\nthe Arctic Circle. Uh...And I contracted a very severe condition. We...we slept in snow\nand sometimes it was even worse when we went below the snow line. And we slept\nliterally in icy water. And...and we went out for training sometimes for 2 weeks at a\nstretch, 10 days to 2 weeks at a stretch. I might sleep about, at most, an hour a night til\nyou woke up in the icy water. You only slept out of exhaustion. I contracted a fairly\nserious arthritic condition, you know, with pain the swollen limbs and so on. And\neventually...uh...this...uh... went on for about 2 years. Essentially I understood that we are\nstationed there to...uh...1n case there was a German attack from Norway...from Northern\nEurope, you know, to protect his flank. Eventually this unit was sent off...uh...2 or 3\nweeks before Dunkirk...not Dunkirk... That happened before, of course... Before\nthe...uh...invasion of Europe and...uh...again, I was taken off the unit about a couple of\ndays before the unit in training and I want to tell you what happened.",
        "A: I was...I was...I was taken off...[ was actually commanded...uh...not to go and...uh...it's\nunfortunate if you don't have time because it's only three sentences.",
        "A: Yal. It was really through the intervention of an officer who...uh...was a poet or some\nliterary person who had gone on walks with me. We talked about literature and so on and\nhe said to me, \" Look. You are a sick person. You have this arthritic conditions. You\ncould go and should go and have yourself examined by doctors because you're not in\ncondition to go.\" And I said, \"Under no circumstances I am going to do this. I\nvolunteered and I will never do it.\" And this man had an order sent to me by the medical\nboard which commanded me to appear before them. I appeared before them and to my\nutter amazement, I was downgraded from A to C-2. It was really a strange story. Uh...I\nwas taken off a day or two before the...the unit went in training. I was broken up over\nthat. I was really...I...I had extremely mixed emotions over this whole thing...uh...because\n[...] thought maybe I could have gone, but there was no way I could have gone. H",
        "A: Oh, sure. I stay...I stayed in Britain until the war. I was demobilized in 1947. And as a\nmatter of fact, I...you know when you're demobilized you're given...uh...certain\nthings...uh...few dozen belongings, what not...underwear. The most magnificent thing\nwas the raincoat. And the first... This was a really marvelous raincoat, and the first thing\nthat I did was to go to Hyde park and again it was beautiful summer. At least this was a\nsummery day. And so I didn't need to put the raincoat on, you know. I had it over my\narm. And there in Hyde Park, if you have ever been there, there's a lake there, a boating\nlake. And I put my rain...rain coat simply on...on the bench and then walked away from it\nand walked to the lake to look at the boats and then I remembered I had a raincoat. So I\nreturned to the bench and I didn't have a raincoat anymore. Uh...It was the shortest person\never was and there was a fellow near there who said, Oh you...you are the owner of the\nraincoat. Well, I have got to tell you, there was a prostitute here and she saw the raincoat\nand just picked it up and walked away with it. So...uh...I have to say, here was...here\nwas...uh...the legacy to the government of the British Army, you know. But, at least, at\nleast, it was good for one person. Let us. I just want to assume that she was a needy\nperson and she really needed that raincoat. (Laughter)",
        "A: I... Yal. After...after the war essentially I...1 managed...I went into the Polytechnic...\nPolytechnic for a year because it was too late to go to a college. In...in Britain the\nUniversity went to external and internal. And then I passed some examination. I have to\nsay, with a certain touch of modesty I hope, that I did extremely well.",
        "A: Yes. I got in of Economics. I got my degree in political science in economics and...uh...1\nworked just for a few months...uh..in a bank, but I had decided already to go to Israel\nand...uh...uh...that is what I did. Now the whole...the whole thing about",
