        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gisela Zamora,\nconducted by Amy Rubin on June first, 2003, in Scarsdale, New York. This is tape number one,\nside A. If you would just begin by telling me your name, and when and where you were born.",
        "Answer: I am Gisela Zamora. I was born -- my maiden name was Eckstain, in Battenberg unda\nAida in Germany.",
        "Q: And tell me a little bit about Battenberg, and your family.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s family had lived in Battenberg at least for two or three generations. They were\nknown as the Lanksdorfs. My mother was a born Neuberger, and sh -- I\u2019m sorry, she was an -- a\nborn Marx, and the Neubergers married a Lanksdorf, and the children all came, more or less\nfrom that family.",
        "Q: And what was -- what is -- can you describe Battenberg for somebody who\u2019s never --",
        "A: Battenberg 1s a beautiful little 1 -- town, it\u2019s actually a village located at 800 meters elevation,\nand was considered in Germany sort of a spa, what they called Luftcore art. And it had\napproximately, I would say, seven or eight Jewish families. My grandfather Marx, Moses Marx,\ncame from the Rhineland, Achen, and established himself there, married my grandmother, and\nhad a -- a shoe business. He sold sh -- shoes all over the area. He went by bicycle many times,\nand we had the -- a regular store at the bottom of our building, which was quite big.",
        "Q: So this sounds like a very small Jewish community.",
        "A: Very small Jewish community, definitely.",
        "Q: And did you know everyone, all the families?",
        "A: We knew everyone, and some were even interrelated. I\u2019m in touch with the second cousin,\nthat lives across the river, in nua -- Nyack, and we see each other occasionally.",
        "Q: So tell me a little bit about -- I -- I remember you mentioned your father\u2019s work. What -- what\nwas your father\u2019s work?",
        "A: Yeah, my fa -- my mother was introduced to my father, she was a youngest daughter of some\nMarx\u2019s, they had six children, three boys, and three girls, and she was the youngest, and felt after\nmy grandfather passed away, she had to take care of her mother, Beena Marx. And Sevra stayed\nin Battenberg. My father was born in Fleet bachin Hesse, sort of as -- bigger town, which was\nwhat you call a Christstadt in German. And he went to a technical school to learn agronomy.\nAnd he was employed by a man named Louie Marx, who was my mother\u2019s brother. Ne -- not\nLouie Marx himself, but his -- his firma, which was at that time called Deutsch and Marx or\nsomething like that, I don\u2019t remember. And Louie Marx took my father once up to Battenberg,\nand this way my mother met him, and they became engaged, and married in 1926.",
        "Q: So tell me about you.",
        "A: So my father, who was an academic man, had during the early years a very good job with the\nWhymara government, inst -- instructing the farmers how to slaughter, when to slaughter, the\nright time to sow, or to reap, because Germany was very much interested in having a good\nagricultural f -- f -- what you would call a method, to feed it\u2019s people without too much imports\nat that time. But in 1933, when Hitler came to power, my father lost his job, because he was\ngovernment employed. And he took over my fath -- my grandfather\u2019s shoe business, but at that\ntime already, it was going downhill, and he couldn\u2019t really make a very good living from that. So\nthis went through a couple of months, even I would say a year or two, and the anti-Semitism\ncame to Battenberg very early. It was really a nest -- I call it a real nest of Nazis, and trying to\nget rid of all the Jews, and specially confiscate their business. So my mo -- my father decided it\nwas better for him, and for us, for the family, to move to Friedberg where his parents had a\nhome. At that time in the Judengasser, which was at -- at very early times in the 16\" century,\nghetto. But it was quite a nice little street, the houses were one on the -- one on the other, and we\nhad the three floor house, my father put in plumbing, which by that time they didn\u2019t have there.\nAnd we children, I had a brother by the way, his name was Norbert, who was born two years\nafter me, in 1930, went to school in Bard Nowheim, which was a spa approximately three\nkilometers from Friedberg and had a Jewish cabearks -- ca -- gaminda shula, excuse me. A -- as\n-- a school that took in all the children from the surrounding area. It was located in a beautiful\narea, and had very good reputation as a -- a school of first class. And we went to this school till\n1938, I would say -- \u00b039, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: Do you mind if I back up for a moment?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you, just in brief, to describe the personalities of your family. Your parents,\nand you had one sibling, your brother.",
        "A: Yes. Well, unfortunately we were children, didn\u2019t realize the difficult times my parents went\nthrough, especially raising us, bringing in the money to send us to school, and to feed us and so\non. My mother was very fragile, but my father was a very strong man. He was an officer in the\nfirst World War, so he was wounded, and had a paralysis on the right hand, and the right arm\nwas completely stiff. He was wonderful, he was able to do everything with his left. And made\nsure that we children go to school, was -- got very disciplined, and my mother sort of was weak\nin this. And we -- when we wanted something, we always went to our father, especially me. I\ncannot talk to -- about my -- my brother, we sort of at that time were very young, and had many\nlittle fights, or spats, I would call them.",
        "Q: And you remember Battenberg even though you were young, you remember living there?",
        "A: Iremember very much living there, and I loved the area, because it\u2019s in a what\u2019s called\nThrowtargabeerga in German, and on the Aida, which was the biggest -- had the biggest dam,\nabout 10 kilometers away in Germany. As a matter of fact, it was just finished when Hitler was\nin power, and he made a lot of propaganda for it. He wanted to imitate the Hoover dam at that\ntime.",
        "Q: Did you have also, non-Jewish friends there? It --",
        "A: Definitely. I have a non-Jewish friend who is writing me regularly, we are in contact. But we\nonly got in contact three years ago when I went back to Battenberg just to see the town, and I\ndidn\u2019t recognize it, 1t had changed so much.",
        "Q: But you also -- you also remember anti-Semitic incidents?",
        "A: Very -- yes. The one thing we had there, we had a neighbor who was -- his name was George,\nI don\u2019t remember his last name, he threw stones into our windows all the time, and we had\nconstantly to repair windows. They were -- and we children were persecuted. We had to walk\napproximately one and a half miles to school, I would say, since we lived on the upper part of the\ntown, and the ch -- the school was in the lower part. So children were already throwing stones at\nus, and we were ostracized. As a matter of fact, at the end they put us 1n the back row in school,\nnext to the Gypsies.",
        "Q: And did you feel -- you were very young, I mean, maybe you can remind me how old you\nwere by the time you left Battenberg, but you -- you felt this impending persecution.",
        "A: I felt this very much.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I -- I -- I felt this per -- persecution, and an incident happened, I should really not tell this\nhere, but it\u2019s -- since these Gypsies sat next to us, there were two boys, they all the time exposed\nthemselves towards us, and played around with their sex organ, and that left a terrible impression\non me all my life. And there was one Jewish -- one non-Jewish boy, who was the son of the\nphysician in the town, who went up to the teacher and told her, and she actually did nothing\nabout it, because she was part of the Nazi party. But my father realized it\u2019s time that we have to\ngo. And since our immigration was pulled here, and pulled there, because of my father\u2019s injury\nduring the first World War, it was s -- rejected by the US at that time, and we tried other\ncountries, and you needed an awful lot of money, and since my father was not employed since\n1933, it was very difficult. We lived really, on a very wealthy aunt, who send us money and --\nand bought us clothing, and helped us all along, as long as she could.",
        "Q: How old were you when you left Battenberg?",
        "A: 10 years. Wait a minute, yes, I was born twen -- 10 years.",
        "Q: So at that time your family was aware enough of what was happening, or what seemed to be\nhappening, to try to emigrate, to try to leave.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And -- and couldn\u2019t, and then the next step was to go --",
        "A: To Friedberg.",
        "Q: To Friedberg. So what are your memories of living there? How different was it from\nBattenberg?",
        "A: It was much more -- less tense, and much more liberal in a way. And there were a couple of\nhalf Jewish people, families, that helped us during the night. We had -- my father was a -- a -- a -\n- a special person to an old woman, who was in her 70\u2019s at that time. She came in the middle of\nthe night to bring us some food. She was very di -- attached to my father. And the town itself 1s\nlarger, it\u2019s like White Plains, New York. As a matter of -- see, 1t was a -- it\u2019s county seats -- the\ncounty seat of Hesse, Nassaw.",
        "Q: Tell --",
        "A: Actually Hesse, not Nassaw, Hesse.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your family\u2019s connection to holidays, religious holidays. How -- how\nwas that in your home, was that --",
        "A: My mother was very observant of the Jewish laws, and she cooked kosher, and ub -- I would\nnot say that it was overly kosher, but my father was very much on the other side, since he used to\ngo to farmers, and they used to give him pork and sausages when he was an agronomist and\nworked for the government. So he didn\u2019t believe in any of these dietary laws. And sometimes he\ntook us children along, and we tasted pork, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell your mom.\u201d The first thing\nwhen we came into the house, naturally children say, \u201cDo you know where we went? Daddy\ntook us to this and this farmer, and we had a wonderful bratwurst.\u201d And my mother almost\nexploded. But those were incidents that were still pretty good. And 1 -- when we were then in\nFriedberg, my father had a lot of friends. School friends, and he was a good athlete. He used to\nplay very good football, and he used to belong to a league, and some of the Germans that tried to\ncontact us -- or contact him, did so. But it got less and less as time goes on. And --",
        "Q: And tell me -- and tell me a little bit also about -- about religious holidays for your family.",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: And your favorite ones, what -- what you remember.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if they didn\u2019t leave any spa -- the favorite one was probably Passover. Well,\nnaturally Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. At that time I was too immature to know what it 1s.\nNow, in my old age, I\u2019m searching for my background, and for different, and look into different\nreligions, and I\u2019m comparing it to, specially Yoga, Redunta and Buddhism. I\u2019m very much into\nthat right now.",
        "Q: So -- so now your family -- and tell me the year when you moved to -- to Friedberg, tell me\nalso about you going to school in -- in Friedberg.",
        "A: We -- we -- well, we went to school in Bad Nauheim, we took the train every morning, which\nwas only 10 minutes. And the schools there was also a children\u2019s home, where children who --\nwho pa -- whose parents were already separated, or immigrated someplace. It had a children\u2019s\nhome, but at the same time it took all the children by -- how would you call it, coming there from\nthe surrounding area. You didn\u2019t have to live in this children\u2019s home to go to that school. It was\ncalled the besere -- Bitseerik shula. That means of the whole county, Jewish children could come\nby train, by bus, whatever. And I remember I have a very good friend, Eva Forest, whose --\nwhose maiden name was Warburg. She was brought by limousine still, since she was a relative\nof the Warburgs, a wealthy Jewish family.",
        "Q: And when was this? What year now?",
        "A: I would say it was \u00b038, \u201939 and maybe beginning of \u201940, but then they closed that school, the\nNazis closed the school, and if you wanted to further our e-education, we had to get to Frankfurt\namine. So through the joint Jewish community of the German gu -- [indecipherable] German\nReich, at that time, made sure that children that didn\u2019t have the means to lodge there, to place\nthem in homes, and also children\u2019s homes. And I would say we went there in beginning of 40\nfor about a year and a half, which was a wonderful experience. Frankfurt is a big city, very\nliberal for German standards. It was always against the -- the Kaiser, and had some prominent\nnon-Nazis. So some of the Jewish institutions were still working, and one of them is the\nphilanthrop -- was the philanthropine, the school that was boser [indecipherable] and a -- a part\nof the school taught even in English, you could get your diploma in English, and regular German\nfolkshula. Ma -- my husband, by the way, has a diploma, or let\u2019s say high school f -- liseum\ndiploma from philanthropine in Frankfurt.",
        "Q: Oh he --",
        "A: He was several years older than I was, so --",
        "Q: So you never met there?",
        "A: No, never. He was seven years older than I was.",
        "Q: So we\u2019re already up to 1940, it sounds like. Can we go back for a moment, and can you tell\nme did you -- do you have recollections in 1938 of Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Oh definitely, I remember that, and so well. In the morning they came for my father, and he\nwas rounded up with a lot of men to Buchenwald, which we later found out that, we didn\u2019t know\nat that time. And my mother, since we had that three story building, had a big attic, my mother\nput us all the way up into the attic, and said, \u201cYou be very quiet when they come here.\u201d And they\ndid come, but they never went the s -- above the second floor, but they threw out all our -- my\nmother had a lot of miesen, and porc -- other porcelain, crystal, threw it out of the windows.\nDemolished the dining room, and living room, sort of furniture threw out of the window. But\nphysically we were not apprehended, because first of all they never knew where we children\nwere, and weren\u2019t interested. And my mother, I have no recollection where she stayed. She must\nhave stayed on the third floor also, and just watched. But my father was gone for about four and\na half weeks, till he came back from Buchenwald. And I remember my mother preparing a bath\nfor him. At that time we didn\u2019t have bathrooms like here, except we had a flush toilet. And she\nmade hot water in a sink ba -- basin, and washed my father from top to head, because he was\nsmelling so much. And the -- we continued to live in Friedberg during all this time, going to\nschool in Frankfurt, and my parents living in Friedberg, coming occasionally to Frankfurt to visit\nus, to see how we are doing. And also on vacation time we went home. And in 1940, or \u00b041 -- I\nhave a friend who could -- who knows the exact date, but I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: The schools were closed, all Jewish schools, all education to all J-Jewish people was -- was\neliminated.",
        "Q: How did you -- how did you feel not only then, but also after Kristallnacht, after what your\nfather went through, how do you remember --",
        "A: I was --",
        "Q: -- personally feeling? Did you feel that things were getting worse? How did you feel about it?",
        "A: I did not realize this, and we were too young to realize it. I was barely 14, my brother was 12.\nSo we felt it in a way, but not really that it -- it harmed us in a way. We still had Jewish children\nto play with, till later on everybody immigrated and very few children were left. That was the\ngreatest thing that I feel now is that was very sad, that I had nobody to play with, to talk to. Only\nmy brother.",
        "Q: When did that happen?",
        "A: During the year \u201940, \u201941, that was sad time, and people still could immigrate.",
        "Q: So do you remember your father telling you about what happened at Buchenwald?",
        "A: Never, never, he -- they were absolutely don\u2019t tell the children. My mother and my father kept\nthis from us. They were very protective. I would never have known. I didn\u2019t know till I myself\nended up in Auschwitz, how these things might have been. The one thing that happened during\nthat time, my father was one of 12 children, and he had a brother, the oldest brother really, who\nwas married to a non-Jew, because he learned watch making in Switzerland, and he met this\nwoman, and got her pregnant, and my grandfather insi -- my grandmother insisted on him\nmarrying this girl. And she came to us in 19 -- goes back to 1920 -- \u201928, I guess. I wasn\u2019t even\nborn yet. So she was part of the family, and he was with my f -- my uncle was with my father in\nBuchenwald, and he was the first one to be killed there. They send his ashes to his wife, who was\nSwiss born, and all her children, the children that they had, had half Swiss citizenship, so they\ncouldn\u2019t do anything to them, they survived.",
        "Q: And did you hear at the time how he was killed, or what happened?",
        "A: Yes, somehow or other we heard about it, as -- as children, but it didn\u2019t make much\nimpression.",
        "Q: I mean, it seems like you were still young enough that you didn\u2019t really know how to\nunderstand all these things happening.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And school was generally -- when you were still in school, was it a good and positive --",
        "A: A very positive experience, because I was with only Jewish children.",
        "Q: And did you still have non-Jewish friends otherwise, at the time?",
        "A: No, not -- not at that time any more. A-Also, there was a half-Jewish couple, he was non-\nJewish, and she was Jewish, but they were -- were Communists, very Leftist, and he was, at one\ntime in the Wymar Republic, like a delegate to the Congress in Berlin. And they came to see us,\nand he was not afraid. He was a non-Jew, his wife was a Jewish woman. He was not afraid of\nthem, and he had many bouts with them -- the Nazis and at the end he was also brought to\nDachau, but he survived. And I lived with them till I came to this country. To -- with him, his\nwife was killed. But that\u2019s after the war.",
        "Q: Okay, so you were going to school in Frankfurt, your family was still living in Freidburg at\nthe time?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you were not separated from them, or you were, you were living with another family?",
        "A: I wa -- at first I was in the children\u2019s home, and then they placed us in families, because they -\n- they had such an overflow in the kinderheim, that they had to take -- they had to get Jewish\nfamily that had enough room, were wealthy, to take in some of these children. So I came to one\nwealthy family in the west end of Frankfurt who owned a -- a palatial home, which was naturally\nconfiscated while I was there, by the Nazis, and they had --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gisela\nZamora. This is tape one, side B. Okay, continue to tell me about the family you were living\nwith. Also, will you tell me --",
        "A: Say --",
        "Q: -- when this was, and how long you were separated from your own family, not living with\nthem?",
        "A: Well, I was never separated really, only by small distances at that time. I still could go home.\nIt meant you had to take a train from Frankfurt to Friedberg, which was possible. Even so, we\nwere -- we wore the star, the yellow star already, and we had to be s-sitting in a certain\ncompartment. And it was very shameful for us kids, somehow. I mean, we were a little bit\nintimidated, sitting where we were sitting. And -- but what I remember about this family is they\nhad a housekeeper who came from Battenberg, and she had a terrible nervous condition, and\nshook with her hands, and her head, and this is now coming into my mind when I think about\nmyself getting old, and sometimes I have these anxiety attacks, and I start to shake a little bit,\nand that brings me back to that time.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Selma Lermenstein. I don\u2019t think she survived.",
        "Q: So this family, their home was confiscated, what did you think at that time?",
        "A: They went to Theresienstadt where we were transported at that time too, in 1942. But before\nthat, they already -- since the schools were closed, they already were placed in a -- an -- an old\nage home, more or less, and I don\u2019t know what happened to Selma Lermenst-stein. We children\ncame back home, and waited for deportation.",
        "Q: And what do you remember, when did you start -- when did you need -- when were you\nforced to wear the -- the Star of David, the -- and it was a yellow?",
        "A: It was yellow star, with black rim. Well we -- we had to, as soon as we went to school in Bad\nNauheim, already we had that ta -- I think in 1939, right away when this -- before the war yet. I\nwould say \u00b039, after the war with Poland had started. It came slowly, everything came slowly.\nMy mother had to part with her fur coat, with her silver, and her jewelry. Every year there was,\nor every couple of months there was a raid that you had to bring certain things for the possible\nwar that they are going to fight against the allies. And this was a very hard thing for my mother,\nto -- dawa -- to part with material possessions. I think I learned from that. I am giving away\nalready now many of my possessions, and I am very grateful that I had a husband who made\ngood money during his career, and I had a nice home, but I know that I will have to leave it, and\nI\u2019m trying to learn non-attachment to material things.",
        "Q: Did your -- did you -- did you learn very much about the beginning of the war in Poland?\nWhat did you learn, and -- and when?",
        "A: We -- we weren\u2019t allowed to listen to any foreign stations, but this Communist, this -- who\nwas married to a Jewish wife, used to come and tell my father what was said, because he was\nlistening clandestinely, apparently, in -- in a group of people, and used to tell him what\nhappened. But at that time the Germans made big progress into Poland, then into France, and by\nthat time a lot of Jews were already deported to the east, and we were lucky to be there yet till\n\u201940 -- lucky? I wouldn\u2019t say lucky -- till September \u201942, when we were rounded up. And as I\nsaid, our luck was that my father was an officer in the first World War, and he had the Purple\nCross, the German ahtler, and whe -- we were privileged to go to Theresienstadt. And needless to\nsay, for my parents it was a very terrible thing, but we children didn\u2019t realize what it meant for\nthem. We came to Theresienstadt, and we saw a lot of children, and we were able to play, and\ncongregate with them, and that was very important for my psyche, because I was so\nexcommunicated from -- from children in Germany, let\u2019s say, or separated. I don\u2019t find the right\nword I want to express.",
        "Q: So you -- you actually felt initially, when you were at Theresienstadt that things felt a little bit\nbetter for you?",
        "A: Mu -- yes, better for me, and at -- the good thing was that my father, since he was also an\nacademic, and he had a background in the Whymara government that he got a job in the Judenrat\nin Theresienstadt, which was a big privilege. Also, he was a very minor, minor official. My\nmother used to say he probably has to sweep the floors of the -- of the Judenrat, of the bigshots\nthere. That\u2019s about all that -- but that enabled him for us, between my brother and myself, to get\nus into kinderheim. At first we thought we both were going to go to the kinderheim, but\nsomehow or other there was such an overflow of children they didn\u2019t have enough room, so we\nhad to choose between -- my parents had to choose between my brother and myself, and they\ndecided that I should go to the kinderheim.",
        "Q: Do you know why they decided that?",
        "A: I have no idea, my -- I -- I couldn\u2019t get along with my mother so well, like girls do with --\nsometimes, with mothers. My father thought that I was the older one, that I should go. That was\nactually for me a wonderful experience, since food was naturally the first thing on our mind, but\nbeing with the same group of people, being able to communicate it, to learn. Because in the\nkinderheim, every room had a sort of a teacher that had to keep us busy. And I remembered we\nhad a girl named Hoyman -- Eta Hoyman, she was very well known in Germany in the Zionist\nmovement. And she read books with us, we learned history of Palestine, and it was a very good,\nwonderful experience. However, it didn\u2019t last, like nothing lasts. Unfortunately, my brother\nduring that time became sick with typhus and was quarantined. My mother was terribly upset\nabout it, and I had to try to cheer her up a little bit here and there, and I have made acquaintance\nwith a pianist in Theresienstadt, and she was in the entertainment part, and she got us tickets to\nvarious performances. And my mother liked it very much, and I used to go with her in the\nafternoons or evenings.",
        "Q: So there were certain cultural activities?",
        "A: Yes, only in Theresienstadt. It was the -- as everybody knows, the camp that they -- the\nghettos that was open to show how well the Jews were treated.",
        "Q: What are your first recollections of seeing, or meeting Nazis, even before, perhaps, before\ngoing to Theresienstadt?",
        "A: I -- my mother always said, \u201cAs soon as you see these black shirts, or the brown shirts\nmarching down the main street,\u201d in Battenberg when we were small, because that was a nest of\nNazis, \u201cyou come straight into the house.\u201d They -- they put a -- a fear into us children.",
        "Q: And did you have any personal interactions you recall?",
        "A: Only as I said, when we walked to the school in the morning, many times children of -- of\nNazis were trying to persecute us, and hit us, and -- but somehow or other, I had sort of a lucky\nstar, and I don\u2019t remember the real bad, bad, bad episodes, except that at night we always were\nafraid to go to sleep, because of the stones that came into the window.",
        "Q: And that was still in Battenberg.",
        "A: That was still in Battenberg, in Friedberg that never happened.",
        "Q: And also later di -- in your -- in the schools you were attending, I read something once that\nsaid the Gestapo was already monitoring these schools, like in Frankfurt the school you attended.\nDid you -- did you see any officials -- Nazi officials around your schools?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I really don\u2019t remember, but it could well be. I have a book here from the\nphila -- about the philanthropine, and maybe we can look it up.",
        "Q: I was just curious if any of that -- you know, if you remembered.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that, I only remember that in the last few months I did not go to school\nany more, I stayed home with my parents, and I helped out in a old age home, washing floors, I\nwas 14, and they made me scrub the floors. Had to kneel down -- was backbreaking work for a\n14 year old.",
        "Q: And that was after you were no longer allowed to go?",
        "A: Na -- just -- it\u2019s a school. Between \u00b041 and \u201942, till our deportation.",
        "Q: So when you were deported, what did you know about what was about to happen at that time?\nWhat were you aware of at the moment that they -- you know, describe to me sort of that -- that\nparticular part of your experience of being deported.",
        "A: The de -- de -- deportation was a horrible experience because we were all taken to a point in\nDarmstardt, which is south of Frankfurt, a major city, and apparently they had Quonset huts\nthere, and they rounded up all the Jews from the arou -- surrounding areas, all the people from\nHesse, Frankfurt, and the bigger cities nearby. And we were sort of divided in groups, and it\ndepended on your status in Germany, and as I said, my father had that luck, that we -- wasn\u2019t the\nluck for him, unfortunately, he lost his life, but that we were on the -- so that we are put on the\nside to go to Theresienstadt. His brother -- and we were very close to them, this -- this 1s not the\nsame brother as the one that was killed in Buchenwald -- well, that was really later -- a younger\nbrother, who lived in Bad Nauheim with his family, they had two boys, and they were put on the\nside to go to the east. And my father tried everything to -- for them to be with us, but it didn\u2019t --\nhe couldn\u2019t do anything about it. So then the actual, when we find -- I don\u2019t know what we ate\nthere, I\u2019ve no idea what -- what the rations were. The rations in Germany already were very poor.\nFor us poorer than for the general public, but we -- we depended on potatoes, cabbage, and what\ndo you call these? Halloween --",
        "Q: Oh, pumpkins?",
        "A: Pumpkins. I mean, they were not like -- they were not quite as big as pumpkins, but some\nkind of --",
        "Q: Like a turnip?",
        "A: Like a turnip, that\u2019s right, it was a turnip, a sort of a winter vegetable that you could still s --\nkeep over the window, and the Germans had warehouses of these things, apparently. Potatoes by\nthe -- they had to, because they had nothing else. And finally, two or three days later, we were\nput into a -- a -- into a railroad. Naturally the -- what do you call them, the wagons that had no\nwindows, and they are used for transport of good and animals. And we got taken to\nTheresienstadt.",
        "Q: What did you bring with you? What were you able to bring?",
        "A: We had each a -- a -- I would say s -- we were allowed certain amount of pounds, I don\u2019t\nremember, maybe 50 pounds in the suitcases. Food, my mother packed up some food, clothing,\nand everybody, we had to carry our own. My parents -- my father ke -- tried to carry my\nbrother\u2019s package, whatever, and we came to Theresienstadt with our own clothes yet. Whatever\nwe could take along. We left many things behind.",
        "Q: And when was this?",
        "A: In 1940 -- September 1942.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay -- you were first taken to -- it was sort of a transit center?",
        "A: [indecipherable] centers -- transit center, that\u2019s exa -- darmshtart.",
        "Q: And how long you were there?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t s -- I don\u2019t remember, maybe a week or two.",
        "Q: And from there? And people were taken from there to different places --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- and from there you were taken to Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Theresienstadt, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And the trip itself you remember pretty vividly, or is 1t hard to remember?",
        "A: Yes, I remember it was a beautiful fall day, and somehow or other, I -- I looked out -- I don\u2019t\nknow if it had windows, or just holes, and I saw the landscape, I was very much impressed,\nbecause he went along the Elba, down to S-Sudatenland, which is today Czechoslovakia. It was a\nbeautiful, scenic area, always was impressed by nature, because Battenberg was such a beautiful,\nbeautiful situated town.",
        "Q: So -- and you didn\u2019t know where you were headed at that point?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know. When we arrived -- I don\u2019t know, maybe my parents knew, but I doubt it.\nWhen we got to Theresienstadt, we were all put into a -- a compound, and my father, as usual,\nwas able to get to a compound where there were prominent Jews, like lawyers, and professionals.\nThey sort of had this all divided there. And we stayed on the floor, and we had straw sacks to\nsleep on, maybe -- it depended on the room how many people, 20 - 25, and that is not very nice.",
        "Q: And how long were you staying in that situation?",
        "A: As -- when -- when my father finally -- I would say about less than a half a year. Then I was\nable to get to the kinderheim.",
        "Q: So for the first six months at Theresienstadt, you were in these cramped, crowded living\nconditions?",
        "A: Yes, definitely, and there were a lot of Slovakian Jews, Czechs Jews, and Jews from all parts\nof Germany, some Austrians, and later on we also had Dutch Jews. And somehow or other there\nwas ill-feelings sometimes between this Jews, where they came from, what they did, and so on\nand so forth. I have to think of this today, cause humankind does not learn from -- from these\nthings, apparently. It continues, and continues in this world.",
        "Q: So you were able to stay with your family, together?",
        "A: Yeah, together till I was put into the na -- kinderheim, which was just a couple of blocks\naway, but that was a revelation for me, and I loved the learning there. It -- 1t was something that -\n- and spiritually it helped me to be with other Jewish children, en masse. There was competition\nin school, in writing, in reading, and knowing certain answers and so on. And I always had a\ndrive to be -- I had a big ego to be on top, whatever, which naturally I had competitions there\nvery much, but it kept me alive.",
        "Q: The first half year, was it depressing to you?",
        "A: Yes, because a lot of the old people around us passed away. They just couldn\u2019t take it. And\nwe saw that, even in our room, and every morning somebody was sick, had even -- had diarrhea,\nand it smelled, or vomiting, and awful -- awful things. This was very, very bad for us children,\nbut since I later on decided in this country to be working in the medical profession, when I think\nabout this now, it really is part of human suffering.",
        "Q: So you were -- you were in the kinderheim, you were feeling -- I think you wrote that it was\nan intellectually prosperous, or fruitful --",
        "A: [indecipherable] time.",
        "Q: -- time for you. And it sounds like what you were able to learn there was not censored, or\nrestricted, it sounds like --",
        "A: No, it was between ourselves, since we had Eta Hoyman, we learned a lot of -- about\nPalestine, the history of the Zionist movement, and she wanted to inflame in all of us a desire to\ngo to the homeland of the Jews.",
        "Q: Did you feel that interest, and -- and --",
        "A: Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know. I -- I did and I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: But you still enjoyed learning everything?",
        "A: I enjo-joyed learning and reading classical novels. She read to us every night for at least an\nhour. And some of the children, naturally didn\u2019t pay attention, but I was there, I -- I couldn\u2019t pull\nmyself away from that.",
        "Q: And did you get involved in any cultural performances or activities?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, I had a -- a flair for gardening, so they selected me to work in what they\ncalled the [indecipherable] garden. And I had a girlfriend, passed away not so long ago, we both\nwere working there, we raised, for the Nazis naturally, tomatoes and spinach, and -- but we were\nable to eat here and there a tomato, when nobody looked. And they noticed that I made very nice\nbeds, you know, the flower, not -- the beds for the vegetables, so they selected me to rake -- to\nrake the beds nice and straight, and make them four or five inches high from the ground, and so\non. And that I enjoyed very much. And every night I went home, putting a tomato, or a potato\nunder my armpits. If we had been caught, we would have been sent right away to some prison.\nThere was a prison nearby, but I brought this to my mother, and she was forever grateful when\nshe had something like this, to feed my brother.",
        "Q: So tell me your -- your --",
        "A: But it was a short time, it was maybe one summer, and one fall. Is it finished?",
        "Q: You want to take a break?",
        "A: Yes, please. I --",
        "Q: I just want to make sure before we continue talking about your experiences, would you just\nmake sure to tell me the full names of your family members, your parents and your brother?",
        "A: Yes. My father\u2019s name was Bertholdt Eckstain. My mother\u2019s name was Bertha Eckstain, born\nMarx, M-a-r-x. My brother\u2019s name was Norbert, N-o-r-b-e-r-t Eckstain.",
        "Q: And you originally had a middle name, it sounds like that was also from your family.",
        "A: My middle name was Bina, B-i-n-a, which was my grandmother\u2019s name, on mother\u2019s side.",
        "Q: And how did you -- and how about your first name, did you get that from someone in your\nfamily?",
        "A: Yes, I had an aunt, she was more German than the Germans, very wealthy woman, married to\na very wealthy horse dealer, in -- Jewish horse dealer in Germany, and she was thinking it should\nbe a German name. She had a preference for me. She as herself couldn\u2019t get children, so she\nnamed me Gisela.",
        "Q: And would you say that your family in general was very assimilated into German society?",
        "A: I would say so. They were very assimilated, especially my mother\u2019s family. You had to be if\nyou lived in a small town.",
        "Q: Okay, so now to return to I think where we left off, we were talking about sort of the early\ntime period when you were in Theresienstadt, and I actually have a map, and I would -- \u2019'm\nwondering if you recognize sort of where you were.",
        "A: I know that I was in L four -- 414 in the kinderheim, but before that --",
        "Q: This looks like the main square.",
        "A: Yeah, I understand. And near there was a kine -- it doesn\u2019t say there.",
        "Q: This may not be detailed enough.",
        "A: Yes, it was on the right side of the kinderheim.",
        "Q: This apparently --",
        "A: [indecipherable] children\u2019s home.",
        "Q: So when you first arrived, where were you in terms of this main square?",
        "A: We were -- we were in the Hanover barracks when we arrived, till I got to the kinderheim,\nwhich was L fear hundred -- 414, the German kinderheim.",
        "Q: And at that time you were then separated from your parents, or did you see your family?",
        "A: Oh, I could see them any time. It was a little walk to get to them, but most of my time was\nspent with the other children. We were always busy. We were kept busy from morning till night.",
        "Q: And then -- and then you stayed in the kinderheim for how long?",
        "A: Till we were deported.",
        "Q: So you were there for the rest of the time?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, in looking at this example of the map, just so I have a better understanding, were you\nusually -- did you usually stay in a very small portion of the overall area, or did you wind up in\nmany different, you know, parts.",
        "A: Oh, it -- when we were allowed to go out without -- we could go anywheres without\nguardians, Jewish guardians. So we once in awhile went just through to the main square, or went\nto a concert, or something that was offered at that time.",
        "Q: And the garden, you worked in a garden, is that?",
        "A: Yes, I worked -- we worked in the Veshalie garden, which 1s outside the ghetto, we were\nmarched there, and we were marched back. And I --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: And occasionally we\u2019re examined if we took anything into the camp, so everybody was very\nafraid if you took a potato or two, or a tomato or two, or some spinach underneath our clothing.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: That we brought -- I brought to my mother, she was very grateful for this.",
        "Q: So would you tell me --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gisela Zamora,\nconducted by Amy Rubin, on June first, 2003, in Scarsdale, New York. This is tape number two,\nside A. So I was just about to ask you if you could describe to me the daily routine or what a -- a\nday was like for you there. I guess we\u2019re talking about the time that you entered, you know, the\nkinderheim, and -- and you were working in the garden. What was a typical day like for you?",
        "A: Well, we had to get up early in the morning, get our ration of food, whatever it was, and we\nhad a very string -- string -- strict -- I\u2019m sorry, strict teacher, that led us to -- in -- in to a sort of a\ncircle, we sat down on the floor, and she told us -- she read to us, and we had naturally, intervals\nwhere we could go to the bathroom. Many of us had diarrhea from the food, from unsanitary\nconditions. We slept too many people in -- on one bunk, and usually on the -- on Saturdays we\nwere free. And I had my first experience of relationship with the opposite text -- sex. That means\nonly platonically. He was a singer from the Czech opera, and I happened to be, on a nice sunny\nday, in a new outfit that my mother made for me from some rags. And I sat myself down on\nsome stones, and there comes this man, sat next to me, and I recognized him right away, and told\nhim that he was at the opera. So he gave me a kiss, and hugged me. And he promised to be there\nthe next week, and unfortunately I arrived, waited there for an hour with tears in my eyes, and I\nnever saw him again.",
        "Q: Do you know his name?",
        "A: Iam sorry, I forgot.",
        "Q: But you had a little crush on him?",
        "A: I had a crush on him. That was my first crush.",
        "Q: And how old were you at this time?",
        "A: Pm going on 15 --",
        "Q: So the f --",
        "A: -- or f -- almost 16.",
        "Q: So -- so you were enjoying yourself in school, but the food situation was not very good, right?",
        "A: No, we always were hungry, and if we could somehow or other catch anywheres a little bit\nextra, that was special.",
        "Q: And otherwise you saw your family in the evenings?",
        "A: Yes, and sometimes in the afternoons, and then when my f -- my brother got sick with typhus,\nI was not allowed to go there for awhile, because it was disinfected, and my mother didn\u2019t want\nme to come there. So I met them on the outside once in awhile. But generally I was so happy and\n-- to be in the kinderheim, that I had not this desire that I would have today to see my parents.\nWe were young, and so wrapped up with being young, trying to learn and enjoy ourselves. So,\nthese horrible things were left sort of not to dwell on. We saw every day wagons with corpses\ngoing by, because we were right on the main street, and they were being taken out of the ghetto\nto a mass grave. But your -- every day you saw at least two or three wagons with several people\nin there. Mostly elderly people.",
        "Q: And did you give much thought to it at the time?",
        "A: None at all. We were so -- we were so childlike. I think today\u2019s teenagers would think\ndifferent, but we were so ignorant.",
        "Q: And what did you hear -- I -- I get the impression that Theresienstadt was unusual, that\nsometimes people could write letters, and send information from the outside. Did your family --\nwere you aware of your family receiving packages or letters?",
        "A: No, we ne -- I don\u2019t think I remember anybody sending us packages, because all my family\nfrom my mother\u2019s side -- [phone rings] Ah, I\u2019m sorry. [indecipherable] where we were.",
        "Q: Does this map look familiar to you, or not very familiar, actually?",
        "A: Not at all. I know the main square.",
        "Q: And this says post office.",
        "A: Street.",
        "Q: Street, or [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. The only thing is maybe this --",
        "Q: Number 13.",
        "A: -- teen was what? SS billets, no. Let\u2019s see why -- what.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see now, maybe if we read this, it might tell you something that you would recognize.",
        "A: I look -- children\u2019s pavilion during the embellishment. No, that was not [indecipherable |",
        "Q: That was in preparation for the Red Cross.",
        "A: Yeah, no, we were put there. We were taken there when they came and inspected us, and we -\n- we all were fixed up with beautiful hairdos, flowers, and new clothing if -- if they had.",
        "Q: Did you understand what was happening at that time?",
        "A: Not at all. I-I can\u2019t even remember.",
        "Q: But you know that something was different, you know that you were given --",
        "A: Yes, yes, later on we heard that this was an inspection for the Red Cross, for the international\nRed Cross.",
        "Q: And did you meet anybody from the Red Cross at that time, or see anybody coming through?\nWere you aware of their visit?",
        "A: I -- no, I -- a ve -- we -- you know, I was way in the back, and there were a lot of children, a\nlot of people that they brought there. I think now I\u2019m finds it. L -- Main Street. We were on the\nMain Street. I would say maybe here, these two buildings, one was for just Czech, Slovak\npeople, and one was for the German Dutch children.",
        "Q: So when -- so what else do you remember, if anything about the time period right before --\nwell, when did the Red Cross come to visit, and what do you remember about that whole time\nperiod?",
        "A: I do remember nothing very much, except that I was happy to be in company with my own\ngrade -- kind, and I was not a good eater before we left Germany, and that\u2019s why my -- my\nhunger, probably was not so bad that time. I didn\u2019t feel it. Or I felt it, but whatever we got at that\ntime seemed to be a little bit sufficient, even though probably it wasn\u2019t sufficient. But I think it\nwas sufficient for me if they ar -- selected me in Auschwitz to go on labor.",
        "Q: And you were --",
        "A: Even so, I was small, skinny, not very tall compared to a lot of other girls that were hefty, and\ntal -- and robust, muscular and so on.",
        "Q: So what were your -- what were your actual barracks like, and -- and how crowded were\nthey?",
        "A: Well, as I said, the barracks where my parents were e -- were first brought, where one family\nwas put in one little compound, in a corner, next to another family, another family, another\nfamily and so on. And as I said, it was th-the more elite part of the ghetto that we were brought\nto. There were only lawyers, doctors, and prominent people. I remember even one of my\nmathematics teacher from Frankfurt with his family, Dr. Naleftchuwitz, that he was right near us,\nacross this -- from our compound, the same big room. Then there was a famous lawyer,\nLervenstein, whose daughter Ruth Lervenstein? I forgot her first name now, was a very\naccomplished pianist, and performed on the stage in Theresienstadt, and she took me to many of\nher concerts. What I remember most is that a -- the last night before our deportation, my mother\nand | -- that means my father was deported already, a month later my mother and I went to a\nperformance of Hayden\u2019s Creation, and I never will forget that. Next morning we were all\nrounded up for Auschwitz. .",
        "Q: And the night before you were very happy, would you say, or --",
        "A: Ah, yeah, it impressed me very much to hear that chorus, and I have a ticket to hear it at\nLincoln Center a -- a -- on August 23\", and I wonder what reaction it gives me.",
        "Q: So did you have many interactions with any of the Nazis overseeing, or I believe there were\nsome Czech gendarmes who were also the guards?",
        "A: Yes, the Czech gen -- gendarmes were with us in the Vesherie garden on the outside. On the\ngeneral they were very humane, let\u2019s say as humane an -- as they could be. They let us work, we\n-- we naturally had to work, but they were not like the Nazis.",
        "Q: And you did see Nazis inside Theresienstadt?",
        "A: I never really -- I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: When -- when were you aware of your father leaving? Did you know beforehand?",
        "A: No, all of a sudden they said tomorrow -- this is -- in this time my father and lots of other men\nhave to be ready to go on labor on the outside, and they rounded up all younger men in their 30\u2019s\nand 40\u2019s. My father was at that time -- born in \u00b093, f -- about 51 or 52, but very tall, and not\noverweight, and he was amongst those that were selected on this first trip to Auschwitz from\nTheresienstadt, the first men\u2019s transport.",
        "Q: And when was that?",
        "A: August, 1944.",
        "Q: Had you heard anything about Auschwitz at this point?",
        "A: Nothing. Maybe it was mentioned, but nobody could make any il -- illustration how it would\nlook. I don\u2019t think I heard anything about it. They only talked about labor camps for the Reich.",
        "Q: And you did not know your father was going to Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, no. As a matter of fact, they duped us when one month later, they said all wifes and\nchildren of the men that were transported last month will now be able to go to the labor camp,\nand live with their husbands. So it should be an enticement to go on this trip. I don\u2019t know if my\nmother f -- did that out of her free will and registered us, or if we were just selected.",
        "Q: Did you have any -- do you remember any holidays, religious holidays in Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Well, as we -- as we had a very Zionistic, and also religious hofsayren instead of teacher, Eta\nNoyman, a prominent Zionist and Judaic scholar, she made sure we had a nice celebration on the\nvarious Jewish holidays.",
        "Q: So by the time -- oh, I wanted to ask you -- here, I can take that -- I wanted to ask you, when\nyou were, you know, studying and learning, and this was a fruitful time for you, did you have\nany dreams, or aspirations for what you would like to do later, as you grew up?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but I was so -- so hungry for knowledge, for knowing things. I was always\ncompetitive even in Frankfurt in the ha -- in the school we went to. And I basically was not a top\nstudent like my friend Eva Warburg, but I was a good student.",
        "Q: What were the subjects that you liked the most in school?",
        "A: Science. I was good in mathematics. That was my father\u2019s influence. He had us do arithmetic\nwhen we were four years old. And I remember as a child three years, or four years old, playing\naround with w, because I liked that letter, and made out two v\u2019s and turned it around to make an\nm. All these things, and the n, I made into a u upside down. And those were sort of -- I think\ningenious ideas that not every child has.",
        "Q: And -- and you were -- 1t wasn\u2019t necessarily every other child around you who was as hungry\nfor knowledge, right? It was sort of unusual.",
        "A: N-No, no, that\u2019s true. But I sought out those kids that had the same interest.",
        "Q: And who were your closest friends at that time in Theresienstadt?",
        "A: As I said, Eva Hashkowitz Goodman, who just published a book in German. Ouse wonderum\nforloifish nish merklish. She was a good friend of mine, and it was by coincidence that we were -\n- met again in Auschwitz, and she gave me a half a loaf of bread, and I\u2019ll never, never forget that.",
        "Q: Any other good friends in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yeah, I had a lot of good friends in Theresienstadt that came from my neighborhood in\nFriedberg. Her name was Ruth Wertheim. She married a Mitchell Bakehow, a lawyer in Detroit -\n- in Pontiac, Michigan. And we were lifelong friends. She saved my life on several occasions in\nAuschwitz by being like a mother, very protective.",
        "Q: Before you were sent to Auschwitz, you also had another job in Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Yes, I was washing children\u2019s diapers in cold water. I remember it was fiercely cold that\nwinter, and my hands used to freeze, and I\u2019m surprised I don\u2019t have any frostbites or anything.\nThat was part of my job.",
        "Q: You did that outside in the winter?",
        "A: We did it -- we -- I don\u2019t remember. No, we did that inside, but no heat. Cold water only.",
        "Q: Oh, and in -- in your living arrangements after you were with your parents all together, then\nyou are with other young women your age, and --",
        "A: Yes, a -- as I said, the twins -- the Hashkowitz twins were on my ps -- on my bunk.",
        "Q: And was it very uncomfortable, was everybody crowded in? Was it hard to --",
        "A: We sort of maked go -- do. I don\u2019t remember that, but I know we suffered from the -- from\nlice, and from bedbugs. Bedbugs were s -- I was terribly allergic to bedbugs.",
        "Q: What happened to you?",
        "A: Oh, my -- my body was full of pustules. They treated us with disinfectant, whatever they had,\nbut that was not enough, it was so endemic. And the lice, they were all over our head, and no\nwashing and cleaning could bring that out. So this was one bad thing.",
        "Q: But everything got better for a little while when the Red Cross was going to come, and then\ndid things change back to the sort of normal, the Jewish --",
        "A: Yes, and right away after that really, the deportations from Theresienstadt started.",
        "Q: So the day that you were deported, what do you remember that day?",
        "A: It was in September, I think it was September 17\", and my mother said, \u201cIt must be Rosh\nHashanah,\u201d when our -- Rosh Hashanah just passed. I don\u2019t remember exactly what she said, and\nwe were together in wagons again, coal wagons, or whatever they were, and taken to Auschwitz.\nThat was a terrible trip. There was one pail where we could go and defecate and urinate, and at\nsome stations the SS came, and somebody had it to empty them. Then the trip went on, and it\ntook about two or three days to li -- to get to Auschwitz. Luckily, it was cool, and we didn\u2019t need\ntoo much water. But I remember that sitting 1n the -- 1n -- in the middle of the wagon, without\nany backrest, or so on, was very painful. My mother must have suffered tremendously, because\nwhen I think about my back now, and it\u2019s -- bother it gives me, I think back how these older\npeople suffered.",
        "Q: Did you eat, or have anything to drink?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but as I said, my mother took some things along, probably, because\neverything was confiscated in Auschwitz then. But till we got to Auschwitz, we did have\nsomething. I don\u2019t remember what it was.",
        "Q: And were you scared? What did you think?",
        "A: T -- well, I wasn\u2019t scared, just ignorant, we all were ignorant. Maybe the older people knew,\nbut basically I wonder what other testimonials people give if they have -- young people, if they\nhave had 1 -- any idea what would happen.",
        "Q: I think it seems that most of the time people either didn\u2019t know, or couldn\u2019t believe that this\nwould be truly happening.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. I could -- I could not believe. I absolutely was stunned.",
        "Q: So when you arrived, what did you see?",
        "A: I never saw the crematorium, that was later on pointed out to me, after we were in -- in -- in\nour bunks already. But we were on this platform, and Mengele makes the selection, and my --\nmy mother, my brother were taken from me. I was taken t-to the other side, and luckily my\nfriend Ruth Wertheim was there, and we two held hands, and kept together, and were put into the\nsame barrack, slept on the same bed. There we met another girl. Her name was Hannah Laura\nBreaker. She immigrated to Israel a long, long time ago. And the second time I came to Israel,\nshe had passed away already. She was very much taken, and suffered greatly from her\nexperience. She took it in very, very much, and I think that led her to an early death. Also my\nfriend Ruth Hershkowitz Goodman, and her sister -- can\u2019t think of her name. I'll look it up after.\nThe twins. Not identical twins. She also was selected to our area, but sin-since they were twins,\nwere taken out to be with -- for experimentation. But somehow or other they had the luck that\nMengele left -- let them be for last, and used them as messengers. So that they were able to get a\nlittle bread here and there, and once when I met Ruth Hershkowitz on the way out of Auschwitz,\nshe gave me a half a loaf of bread, and she mentions it in her book.",
        "Q: Did -- did you know this -- this doctor was named Mengele at the time, or --",
        "A: No, no, not at all, didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: It\u2019s much later when you learned.",
        "A: Yes, who know -- knew anything. We knew our -- when we got to the labor camp, we knew\nthe German woman that was our -- a -- a real terrible bitch, if I can say that she was. Inhuman.\nInhuman and how would I say, a -- had no scruples whatsoever to hit us, or to kill us, or\nwhatever. She always wore a revolver in her polster, and was ready to shoot anybody.",
        "Q: And who was she? Who -- what\u2019s her name?",
        "A: That wa -- I don\u2019t remember her name. I think her first name was Ilsa. I only remember when\nwe were liberated by the Russians, some of the Polish girls in the labor camp took her and\nshaved her hair, and gave her over to the Russians. I don\u2019t know what happened to her. I was too\nsick at that time.",
        "Q: I wanted to go back for a moment, one thing I didn\u2019t get a chance to ask you. When you were\nstill in Germany, and growing up, and moving from one place to the other, once Hitler came to\npower, or even right before that, what -- what was your awareness of Hitler? Had you been\nhearing anything he said over the radio? Did you parents talk about this person, Hitler? What did\n-- what did you know, what was your awareness?",
        "A: You know that since we went to -- still to German schools in the beginning, we took all these\nthings in, and when all the young people were selected for the youth -- the Hitler yugen, and for\nthe gymnast -- gymnastic classes and so on, no Jews were allowed to enter, nor half-Jews. And\nthat was really the only thing that bothered me. Everything else, we copied, sort of. When they\nsang German folk songs, and we went right along with it.",
        "Q: Did you feel that sense of German nationalism then, that --",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t -- you know, they -- they said the Polacks, the Polish people, and the French\npeople, they are so dirty, they don\u2019t wash themselves, they had all kinds of preconceived notions,\nor -- that was drilled into the German youth. And we staying there, and being with them,\nbelieved the same things.",
        "Q: And you felt very German?",
        "A: And we felt very German. After all, my father was more German than the Germans, I would\nsay. He -- he belonged to the Reichpont yudizhafront soldaten. That means the ri -- the reich --\nthe club of the reich of the Jewish s -- soldier of the front.",
        "Q: And so you, for a while you actually had non-Jewish friends who were joining the Hitler\nyouth, and you were wondering why --",
        "A: Oh yes, all the time.",
        "Q: -- Jewish people weren\u2019t allowed to --",
        "A: Yes, yes. And then, after awhile, they -- their -- their parents said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to this Jewish\ngirl any more. Don\u2019t -- don\u2019t play with her. Stay away.\u201d So we were really alone. We were sort\nof es -- ostracized then, really.",
        "Q: And do you remember hearing Hitler\u2019s speeches at all?",
        "A: No. But my husband told me he went, when he opened up the airport in Frankfurt, he went\nwith his father to hear him, and that gave him the first time an idea that this man 1s a dictator. My\nhusband was seven years older, and had much more knowledge, was very brilliant. And he told\nme this later, when we were married, naturally. He said that he could not understand it, that\nGerman people were so after him, spe -- especially some women that were enamored in him.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: -- morial Museum interview with Gisela Zamora. This is tape two, side B. This is also a map\nhere of Birkenau, and I think this is around the time when you would have been there, it says late\nOctober --",
        "A: Mm-hm, yes.",
        "Q: -- \u00b044.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When did -- when did you arrive? You arrived in September, 44?",
        "A: In ma -- in September \u201944, and was shipped out of Auschwitz in October, late October, to --",
        "Q: To --",
        "A: -- Mattsdorf [indecipherable] to work at Krumstar, Maidna and Franna.",
        "Q: Do you recognize where you would have been in the maps here?",
        "A: No, no, no, they were so close together, I could never tell this. I -- I have absolutely no\nrecollection.",
        "Q: But you were in Birkenau, you were in Auschwitz two, right?",
        "A: Yes. I -- I really didn\u2019t know at that time that it was Birkenau, but in the mornings we used to\nstand at the barbed wire, and we used to see naked men, and real musselmen go by, and waving\nand sought -- were -- were scr-screaming across the wire if they knew of this and this person,\neither their wife, their mothers, or whatever.",
        "Q: They were on the outside, asking --",
        "A: They were -- yes, they were in the men\u2019s -- in the men\u2019s camp.",
        "Q: So you were there for approximately four to five weeks?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And dur --",
        "A: Longer I wouldn\u2019t have survived.",
        "Q: And during that time you said at one point you did become aware of the crematorium, when\nwas that?",
        "A: Yes, the girls, first of all -- the first -- after the first night in Auschwitz, we got out on appelle,\nto be s-standing in line and being counted. There was one girl missing, and we saw her at the\nbarbed wire, she had committed suicide. And there -- there was a big to-do in that camp, in our\nbarrack, what happened, there\u2019s one missing. And then finally somebody got up and said, \u201cShe is\nlying near the barbed wire.\u201d",
        "Q: Was this a real shock to you?",
        "A: Yes, it was a shock, I saw it. I saw the woman. A very good looking, Czech, Jewish, a\nyounger woman, maybe in her early 20\u2019s.",
        "Q: And did you already have a sense that this was a very different place than Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Yes, yes. We talked among ourselves that -- we stood outside for hours, and I didn\u2019t -- I was\ngiven one shirt, sort of, that went down to my knees. It was a little flannel inside, thank God. No\nsocks, no underwear, nothing. Somehow or other, later on somehow, I got a -- a rag somewheres,\nand I used that around my -- my sp -- private par -- parts to be like an underpair of -- under --\npair of pantyhose, or panties. I was always cold in Auschwitz, I cannot remember that I wasn\u2019t\ncold, and suddenly I noticed that I -- my breathing started to be short, and I realized I had fever,\nand was coughing. Those were the first signs of having TB. I didn\u2019t realize it, and my friend\nRuth said, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything, just stay and we\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d",
        "Q: So do you feel like at this stage you were starting to feel more depressed or hopeless about\nthings, or -- or did you still somehow not realize what was possibly going to happen?",
        "A: We all didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us, but we felt -- we -- we smelt a stench\nfrom the crematoria. By that time we knew that there was gassing going on. I mean, that was the\n-- the underground informed us. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t behave you\u2019re going to go there too,\u201d they\nsaid, \u201cso just do what they say.\u201d And since I was the smallest, or one of the smallest, I was\nalways hidden by taller girls, and good looking girls. And somehow I escaped, this way.",
        "Q: You think this helped you, to be small?",
        "A: It -- it helped me at that moment, yes.",
        "Q: Were you searching for your mother, your father, your brother?",
        "A: I -- I would have liked, I wasn\u2019t -- yes, I was trying to find out what happened to them, but we\nwere So occupied in our own psyche, that it was just self-determination to stay alive, that we\ndidn\u2019t think about anybody else.",
        "Q: Did you help each other out, the -- the women you were with?",
        "A: Oh, I must say, these -- we -- the three girls that we were -- Hannah Laura Breaker, Ruth\nWertheim and myself, we were like three sisters. We helped each other.",
        "Q: You shared food, and you --",
        "A: Well, the -- the -- this comes later, when -- after we left Auschwitz, naturally we -- we\ncouldn\u2019t share foods, we each got our plate of soup, and a piece of bread, and everybody said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t hide your bread, it\u2019s going to be stolen, eat it as soon as you get it.\u201d And that was the\ntruth, because some of the girls, if they hid their bread for the night, or for whatever, they were\ngone. Some of the other mates were so hungry, and at that time you were doing anything you\ncould to get more food. Later on, when we were already deported to Mattsdorf and\nReasonkeperga, which happened at dusk, really, it was almost dark in October, very dreary day,\nand maybe Mengele didn\u2019t see how small I was, and said I was being selected to go out, because\nthere was nobody among those girls that was as small and perishable as I was. So emaciated, I\nwould say already, and coughing. And that\u2019s when I red -- I met Rose Hershkowitz with the half\na loaf of bread. And we went out of Auschwitz that night, and arrived in Mattsdorf, it\u2019s a\nkrumstin maidnon farflanna parachute factory. And right away we were put in our bunks, and\nassigned to work for the next day. I was put on the machine that was absolutely one of the worst.\nYou had to take raw flax, which came from the outside, the door was always open, and they\nthrew that flax in and I had to lift 1t up and put it into the machine, to take off the seeds on the\ntop. They had to be put in a certain way into the machine. [phone rings]",
        "Q: Okay. Okay, before we move on to talk about the labor camp, just a little bit more of a sense\nof what it was like day by day in Auschwitz. Did you ever do any work in Auschwitz, or every\nday you were just sort of fighting to -- to stay healthy? You know, what was -- what was --",
        "A: We were -- first of all, I spent an awful lot of time on the latrines, I had terrible diarrhea, and I\ntook every minute I could to run to the latrine, which was not always allowed, and it had a\npermanent affect on my bowels, which I suffer today. We -- we were asked by different older\nsupervisors of our -- our kind in the barrack if we want to bring the soup up. It was a steep little\nhill, and I volunteered a couple of times, but I found it very, very hard to shlep maybe 20 liters or\nmore of soup in the barrel. And I remember that as the worst labor for me in Auschwitz. I -- we\ndidn\u2019t do anything, we just stood at the appelle morning and night, cleaned the barracks if\npossible, if they let us, and waited for our meal. We were just the reserve for going out, and not\nemployed in any way in Auschwitz itself.",
        "Q: Were you worried about being sent to the crematorium at that time?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: Sometimes one wished already that it\u2019s -- it might be, but the self-preservation within one was\nso strong that you wanted to survive under any circumstances.",
        "Q: Did you think that your -- your family was still alive?",
        "A: Is -- I thought of it till the end of the war, and that\u2019s why I went back to Friedberg. The\nRussian soldiers, and the Russian Jewish officer wanted me to go with him to Russia. I said,\n\u201cNo, I have to go west.\u201d",
        "Q: Did you ever -- later, did you ever receive any confirmation of exactly how they died?",
        "A: Yes, when we wrote to Garovstein and we found out that this -- the day when they arrived in\nAuschwitz, that\u2019s their death day, that\u2019s the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And that was your mother and brother?",
        "A: Mother, and my father also, before. I have all the -- the documents about this. The funny thing\nis, my poor husband never could find out where his mother was, and we have a letter that they\ndon\u2019t know where she passed away. We think -- or he thought that she died in Litzmannstadt, in\nLodz, in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Did you -- the documentation that you have about your family, did you ever send copies or\nany of that to the museum?",
        "A: I think they have it. I\u2019m sure -- my husband did all of this, I am not aware of it.",
        "Q: Okay, so -- so now tell me about -- tell me about the day that you were sent out of Auschwitz,\nand -- and the circumstances. What -- what exactly happened that day?",
        "A: We were up -- we were rounded up, about 800 - 900 young girls, Hungarians, German Jews,\nPolish Jews. The German Jews were a minority -- I was among those, and Czech. Our Czech\nbrothers and si -- our Czech sisters that were -- came from Theresienstadt with us, we assembled\non the plaza, and then gi -- Mengele came and selected about four to 500 women. Among them\nwas me. I had held the hand of my friend Ruth Wertheim, who probably pulled me over, because\nI was so small, and sickly already. And he might not have seen it, 1t was dusk, and gray and\nevening, and we were put on the train, on the last wagon again, a closed train, and were taken to\nMattsdorf and Reasonkeperga. We arrived there the next day, and were unloaded, and the thing\nwas they didn\u2019t have enough room for us, so they quickly built Quonset huts on top of the\nfactory, and that\u2019s where we were located. That was a -- an plus for us, because the heat rises up\nfrom the machinery that went on 24 hours a day in the factory, and we felt the first time a little\nwarmth. And also, the factory had to get rid of dirty water that -- hot water that came out of the\nmachinery, since they were cooled by water, and we washed ourselves, and we kept ourselves\npretty clean during that time. But that was a time I got sick very fast, and a doctor came and put\nme in the infirmary. I was coughing, I had a mastitis which was draining. My I-le -- ma -- in ma -\n- on my ri-right breast for eight months, even after we were liberated yet. It gave me terrible\npain, and I had absolutely no incentive or will to live at that time any more. But my friend Ruth\nWertheim, and Hannah Laura Breaker, both kept me going. One day as we were standing there\nand talking in appelle, somehow or other, the foreman of the factory came by, and he said, \u201cHow\ncome you girls speak so well German?\u201d So we said, \u201cWe -- we are Germans. We went to\nGerman schools.\u201d He couldn\u2019t understand it. So next day he brought us an apple, and we divided\nthe apple in three. And that was the first time that a German showed some kind of compassion.",
        "Q: Was he an SS?",
        "A: No, he was a worker, a -- a -- the foreman. Not -- not an SS. If the f -- SS would have known,\nprobably he would have been fired, or whatever. But at that time, it was towards the end of the\nwar, and they were very much wrapped up with the Russian front that was very close to us. We\nheard the shooting all night long.",
        "Q: Can you describe, approximately where -- where this labor camp was? You -- you were\nsaying --",
        "A: It was very near Gross-Rosen, and right across from us was a labor camp of French prisoners\nof war. They actually wor-worked in our factory, too -- do -- to -- did some heavy man\u2019s labor.\nAnd some girls even sort of befriended them, or made some kind of contact with them.",
        "Q: So in your factory it was only for women, is that right?",
        "A: That, yes, that part was only for women, where -- where the flax was made into -- mixed with\na certain synthetic material for parachutes.",
        "Q: And you were telling me before, when the tape ran out, the exact job that you were doing.",
        "A: Yes, I was -- as the raw flax, which -- which made sores on my hand because they are stalks,\nand you had to be fast putting it into the machine. My hands were always bloody, and injured\nfrom this job. And the seeds went into a bucket used for something else, and the stalks w-were\nput through other machines, and refined towards cha -- changing it into a material.",
        "Q: And this was pretty hard -- you know, difficult labor, would you say?",
        "A: It was very difficult labor. I was on one of the worst machines. My friend Ruth Wertheim was\nlucky, she was actually in a part of the sewing part, where they already mixed the nylon, or\nwhatever they had, some synthetic type of process, with the flax material. And it was easier. So,\nactually, I was on the worst end of the labor. That\u2019s why I got sick very fast. The -- the door was\nalways open for the flax to be thrown in, which was also done by girls, and some French\nprisoners brought the heavy bundles. And this went for eight -- almost eight months, from\nOctober to May, 1945. We almost worked towards the very, very end of April in -- fully on these\nmachines.",
        "Q: Were you hearing any news about the war?",
        "A: Yes, we heard that they were coming nearer, nearer. The French soldiers warned us that they\nmight blow us up, so one morning all of a sudden, all the Germans were gone. They were -- the\nfactory was locked up, all Quonset huts were locked up, and everything. We thought they are\ngoing to blow us up, but nothing happened, nobody was around, nuth -- nobody came. That went\non for 24 hours, and we searched for food, and there was really nothing left. And then finally we\nsaw a Russian soldier come on the bicycle, and s-somebody yelled out of a window, or whatever,\nand he came and alerted the Russian army. And the first thing the girls did -- I was too sick,\nslaughter a cow, or Sa -- or a -- or something, or [indecipherable] just to get some f -- real good\nfood into us.",
        "Q: There was a cow nearby, you mean, or --",
        "A: Oh, there were farms nearby. It was a very beautiful area. Oh, besides our regular job, many\ntimes in middle of the night, some of us were taken, every time a different c-cloud to shovel coal,\nto di -- ti -- when the coal wagons were brought in, we had to empty them so they could be used\nright away. And I remember one night was terribly cold, snow on the ground, and we found\nsomething that looked so red, we took it, and was a liver from some kind of an animal, or\nwhatever. And we took it into the barracks, and my friend Ruth put it on some kind of a heating\nmechanism, maybe a radiator, or a machine that had heat, and sort of fried it a little, and the three\nof us divided it and ate it.",
        "Q: You were with a third friend as well there?",
        "A: That Hannah Laura Breaker, three of us.",
        "Q: How was -- you said there was one woman in particular, she was a -- a German guard there?",
        "A: Yes, that -- that was in Auschwitz. There too, there wa -- there were two Polish girls, and they\nclaimed that they were lesbians. Polish Jewish girls that this German woman used them for\nsexual whatever, I don\u2019t know. And they were put in charge of us. And afterwards we really got\nafter the two.",
        "Q: The two in -- in Auschwitz, or in the labor camp?",
        "A: In -- in -- in the labor camp, not in Auschwitz. In Auschwitz I don\u2019t see -- I have seen a non --\nnone except SS.",
        "Q: But in the labor camp, these two women --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: The Polish Jewish women --",
        "A: -- Jewish women, yeah.",
        "Q: -- were in charge of your group.",
        "A: [indecipherable] group, yeah. A -- except in the morning that we stood outside, were counted\nby that SS woman.",
        "Q: And she was very harsh?",

        "Q: A whip?",
        "A: Whip. And used to, if you didn\u2019t stand strai -- straight, hit you over the shoulder, on your\nhands, or whatever.",
        "Q: So when -- when you were not feeling well, you were also given some medical attention\nwhile you were in the labor camp, right?",
        "A: Yes, that was after awhile. A man came, a Dr. Hoffman, and apparently he was only a medic,\nhe was not a doctor, we found out after the war. We searched him. He actually helped a lot of the\ngirls. Few girls that -- that came with us to the labor camp were pregnant, and had babies there,\nand miscarriages. Maybe three or four, but I think two survived and took their babies. And --",
        "Q: They were able to keep their babies there, at the camp?",
        "A: At the -- I don\u2019t know, it was so late in the year already. March, April, I mean how -- the g --\nthe Germans were afraid of everything already. They knew it was going towards the end, and\nthey were so afraid of the Russians. And no more trains, and no more gas chambers in\nAuschwitz, you know. Auschwitz was dismantled in January. So they --",
        "Q: Had -- had you heard about any of those developments?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know about this. We didn\u2019t know. But the French soldiers informed us a lot\nabout. They -- they talked to some of the girls.",
        "Q: Now were you regularly having your menstrual cycles, or were you So --",
        "A: No-o, I had -- that is the funniest thing, my friend Ruth Wertheim had it a few times, and she\nhad nothing to use, she used paper, or whatever she found, even flax. I had my menstrual period\nonce in Theresienstadt, and that was it. But one month after liberation, I had it again, and\nregularly till 1t stopped at age 52.",
        "Q: But for almost the entire time during the war?",
        "A: I had none, none at all. I had -- I had maybe three, four menstruations before we were\ndeported, because I was about 14 and a half, or whatever.",
        "Q: And you -- you did get fairly ill by the end, it seems.",
        "A: I was very ill. As a matter of fact, it took me many -- I would say a year or two to recover.\nAnd how I ever got to Friedberg -- I walked, with French prisoners of war, with Germans, on this\ngeneral exodus from the east towards Germany, and I had my yellow stripe on a jacket, and we\nlooted some things in German houses, so I had enough cl-clothes to wear. And I went e -- west.\nAnd it was a beautiful June, I remember. Oh, first there was one month -- I\u2019m sorry, I was taken\nto a -- to a German hospital that was taken over by the Russians, and I stayed there four weeks,\nand they sort of healed m -- healed me, they helped me to get much better and stronger.",
        "Q: Well now, when liberation occurred.--",
        "A: Everybody left, but the ones that were in the sick brai -- sick --",
        "Q: Sick bay?",
        "A: Bay. Couldn\u2019t go. So I was --",
        "Q: How many were there?",
        "A: Oh, there were about, I would say, 25 to 30 girls. And the ones that --",
        "Q: So you were already there for -- how long before liberation were you in the sick bay?",
        "A: I would say two or three months.",
        "Q: And you were not working during that time?",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: And you had tuberculosis? What did you have at the time?",
        "A: I\u2019ve had tuberculosis, and the mastitis. And I had a fever all the time.",
        "Q: So when liberation took place, j1 -- and you were still so unwell health-wise, did you feel free\nand happy? Wha --",
        "A: I was so happy, and so elated that we were free, we could do now whatever we wanted to, and\nit was -- this feeling, I wished I could get back. This was nirvana.",
        "Q: So you really understood this was the end of the war, this was it. It had really happened, and\nyou were --",
        "A: It had happened. But then I realized I was alone in this world, and luckily when I arrived at\nFriedberg, I got a ride with a -- an American, with two American soldiers as soon as I came to\nHolf and Saxon, they gave me a ride to Birkenback in Germany, and from there some trains were\nleaving, going towards Frankfurt, and I took a train to Hanau, which was very close to Friedberg,\nbecause the train from Frankfurt did not go to Friedberg yet. So from Hanau I took the train to --\nwhere I got the money from, I don\u2019t remember, but everything was on the -- on the road. I got to\nFriedberg, and I wa -- a-asked the stationmaster, \u201cDo you know if Mr. Mowra, Edgar Mowra is\nhere, and where does he live?\u201d And he said, \u201cHe just came back from Dachau.\u201d He was in\nDachau, and he told me where he was. And that\u2019s where I ended up, and stayed with him, his\nson, and the housekeeper till my papers came through. Actually not the whole time. He felt that I\nshould be taken care of with my tuberculosis, and took me to the hospital in Bad Nauheim. And a\nvery fine German radiologist said, \u201cWell, she has pretty bad tuberculosis on the left side of -- the\nleft lung. And we should give her pneumothorax.\u201d So I s --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",

Since we were\njust cut off then, tell me again -- if you would also, just make sure I understand the chronology\nfrom the labor camp, and where you went next, and then of course, tell me about the medical\nprocedure that you had.",
        "A: I had a medical procedure in the labor camp, by the way. This Dr. Hoffman, or medic\nHoffman that arrived there, who came from Bardkissingin, which we lateler -- we later found out\nhe was a medic with the German army corps. He made two incisions in my cyst, or whatever it\nwas in my right breast, and the pus finally came out, and he entered a canula and this drained for\neight months. But he did a pretty good job, and even though he was just a medic, not a medical\nphysician, it helped me to survive through the other months. However, I continued coughing,\nsuffered very much from shortness of breath, and know that I have had something -- I have\nsomething with my lungs. And when I finally arrived in Friedberg, and stayed at Edgar Mowra\u2019s,\nI was very grateful that he took me to the hospital in Bad Nauheim, which is known as one of the\ntop heart spas in the world, and had an excellent, at that time, staff in it\u2019s hospitals. A woman\nphysician, a radiologist, was very kind to me, and explained everything, and said, \u201cYou need a\npneumothorax for eight -- for as long as we can do it. We collapse your left lung so it can rest.\u201d\nAnd they pump air into the cavity, but very shortly already, water filled up -- fluid, after the\ncavity was empty, and that\u2019s the danger of this procedure.

        "Q: So -- so after -- after liberation, and -- well, what -- tell me what happened to your close\nfriends you were with at that time.",
        "A: Oh, this is very interesting, too. I -- I -- my friend Hannah Laura Breaker was living pretty far\naway from Friedberg, where I was, and she decided -- and call -- t-told me that she will not stay\nin Germany, she does not want really to go to America, but she might go to America in order to\nget to Israel. She went to the U.S. -- she ca -- with one of the first refugee transports in 1946, at\nthe end of \u201946, and stayed with her relatives in Washington Heights in New York, and then\ndecided to join an aliyah. And one year later went to Israel to live there. She lived in Moetine,\nand I visited her the first time when I got to Israel in 1963. She wa -- had married, and had\nchildren, was a heavy smoker, and a -- gained it -- lot of weight, and when my husband and I\nreturned in 1973, we looked up again where she was living, and she had passed away. My friend\nRuth Wertheim I kept in touch all along in this country. We were like sisters. We called each\nother almost weekly. She understood more of the horrible times we went through, and she had\nlost a sister before she got to Theresienstadt, because she was -- she gave [indecipherable]",

And this left a terrible scar on my friend Ruth during\nall this time. She married this lawyer, who was very good to her, had two children, a boy and a\ngirl.

        "Q: And -- and your friend Ruth also came to the U.S.?",
        "A: Yes, that was -- and she had many good years, she had a good life in Pontiac. I visited her\nthere twice. And we were like sisters, and she had the quadruple or quintuple bypass in Boston at\nBrigham Hospital, and unfortunately it didn\u2019t help her, she passed away two years later. I was\nmore lucky, I had only a triple bypass. Dr. Eric Rose, who does now only heart transplants did\nmine, and did a good job.",
        "Q: When you were back in -- in Friedberg, did you also look for your family?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s why I went back, and we\u2019d searched. Edgar Mowra helped me very much to\nsearch, he went to the authorities. At that time Germany was in chaos.

        "A: You know, it\u2019s a funny thing, is that I felt happy to be so liberal-lated, that I was able to -- to\npartake in everything. And it never crossed my mind what the Germans did to us, really.\nIgnorance.",
        "Q: You think you just weren\u2019t thinking of it in that sense? I mean, you knew that the Germans\nwere responsible for the war --",
        "A: Yes, definitely.",
        "Q: -- starting the war.",
        "A: As time went on, and as I talked to American soldiers, and my uncle here in America, Louie\nMarx, my mother\u2019s brother, made sure that I come as soon as possible. He put everything into\nmotion, and he asked my relatives here in Scarsdale, who were bor -- she was a born Lanksdorf,\nand a distant relative to my grandmother on my mother\u2019s side, to help, and they did, and brought\nme over in 1947.",

        "A: Yes, oh yes, they -- an American soldier, unfortunately I don\u2019t remember his name, and I\nnever kept a record of it, he published an announcement in the Offbau to say that Gisela Eckstain\nis looking for relatives, and a friend from Battenberg read it, and called my uncle, she knew\nwhere he was in Washington Heights, and told him, \u201cYour niece is looking for you.\u201d And that\u2019s\nhow I got in contact. And I lived with them for a little while. But unfortunately my uncle had a\nhorrible wife. She was a witch.",

        "Q: And at the time you actually felt you would have preferred to have stayed in Germany, is that\nright?",
        "A: You know, I was so attached to the Mowra family, they were so good to me. And the\nhousfrau -- the -- the -- the housekeeper is one of my most -- the person that gave me the most\nsoul input. I have to show you a picture, it\u2019s on the wall there, of all my favorites.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s her name?",

        "Q: And you didn\u2019t feel anti-Semitism after the war in Germany?",
        "A: No, but I think they didn\u2019t like that there were coming so many refugees.",
        "Q: How did you -- there was also, I think, a document you sent to the museum, something from a\nRussian sergeant allowing you to go from one zone to the next.",
        "A: Yes, I am going to show you the original.",
        "Q: The museum have a copy of this? Do you know?",
        "A: They have the copy.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This is the original, prayerbushka, made out by a Russian officer, and he was wonderful to\nme, because I didn\u2019t understand any Russian, and he talked Yiddish to me, or German a little bit,\nand he helped me so much when I was in this lotsarett 1t was called, in Mattsdorf and\nReasonkeperga.",
        "Q: And what does it say, or what do you -- what -- what did it help you to do?",
        "A: That\u2019s my husband. Jewish museum in Frankfurt. That has a wonderful Jewish museum. They\nwere trying to find his mother, they never found her. Elinore Zamoira. They changed the name\nfrom Zamora to Zamoira -- ets -- so -- from Zamoira to -- to Zamora in Italy. They were in Italy.",
        "Q: So tell me about this document, when did y -- how did you --",
        "A: This document helped me to get from the Polish -- through the Polish zone, to the -- it was the\nRussian zone, and then into the American zone. It was quite a -- a big deal to get from one to the\nother, but somehow or other, I kept this. I also had a document from Krumstar, Maidna and Fron,\nand I think they have that too at the museum, but I don\u2019t have -- I can\u2019t find the copy. However,\nthe German gir -- government acknowledged that I worked there, and that I got my compensation\nfor that.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: Oh I'd -- I just found this, my husband had so much -- oh, I -- I put my -- my parents and his\nparents in -- on the Miami Holocaust Museum --",
        "Q: Memorial?",
        "A: Memorial. Have you seen that?",
        "Q: No, not in Miami.",
        "A: It\u2019s beautiful, really beautiful.",
        "Q: So from my understanding, after the war, you were first in a hospital for about five weeks in -\n- in the same area --",
        "A: Bad Nauheim.",
        "Q: But -- but -- but before that, were you still --",
        "A: Oh, I was in a Russian -- I -- I mean a German lotsarett, which 1s like a -- a field hospital for\nsoldiers, which the Russians took over after they liberated this area, and made it into a Russian\nhospital, and took in some refugees that were sick, and I stayed there for approximately six\nweeks. And the food I remember very well, was every day a herring, which was so salty, and\ngrits, or something like a cereal. They didn\u2019t have much themselves. And black bread.",
        "Q: Is that where you met the Russian sergeant who gave you this document?",
        "A: Yes. I -- I talked to all the Russian soldiers there, and some of them were Jewish. They were\nvery interested in our stories.",
        "Q: And had you grown up speaking Yiddish, did you know Yiddish?",
        "A: I learned a little Yiddish in Theresienstadt, but not really -- they -- they understood German\nsomewhat.",
        "Q: And did you grow up learning Hebrew?",
        "A: No, not really. My husband did. He was a specialist in languages. As a matter of fact, he\ntranslated a book from Hebrew into English.",
        "Q: So after -- after that is when you walked. You walked, and then you took a train in the end of\nyour journey.",
        "A: A train, yes, after I got this lift from Saxony, approximately, there were no trains going\nwhatsoever, no transportation. And then finally somebody hold it for me, and gave me a lift. And\nnobody was afraid at that time of hijacking, and so on, so forth. They deposited me at the\nrailroad station in Wordsport, not Werdham -- Werdham -- Wordsport, not Werdham back. And\nI found my way back to Friedberg.",
        "Q: How long were you on this walking journey, were you with other people?",
        "A: Two ow -- two weeks, with other people, we slept in hay lofts, we slept with farmers, and I\neven was enamored in a German soldier that walked with us. Just -- 1t was such a liberating idea,\nand everything. I didn\u2019t think what they did to us really.",
        "Q: Did you have any feelings of resentment toward anybody at that time?",
        "A: No resentment. I still must say I don\u2019t want to sis -- resentment to c-come into my heart. I\nhave contact with some very fine Germans that could have been probably more helpful, but I\ndon\u2019t know if -- what we would have done in the circumstances. Their lives were put on the\nedge, too, when it came to help Jews.",
        "Q: So what is your feeling about this idea of forgiveness, or do you think about it in that way?",
        "A: Well, today\u2019s world is so full of turmoil, and hate between various peoples. And I hope that\nIsrael and the Palestinians will come to some kind of accord, that would be a blessing for all the\nJews. But the Jews have to give also, they cannot just take all the time. And we must learn a\nlesson, that there are ways to find one\u2019s own salvation, and can still be active in the Jewish faith.\nI\u2019m reading a letter f -- about Judaism now, very -- pretty much at the end of my life, I want to\nreturn to my original upbringing, and so on. But I have reservations. When I think about all the\nceremonies that we have, and circumcisions, and these feasts. They are two, 3000 years old.\nThey don\u2019t have to be replicated in the way we are replicating them.",
        "Q: And you have shown an interest in studying other religions, as well.",
        "A: Yes, I would say monotheism is not the answer, it\u2019s monism. One self above all. And\neverybody has some of that self, and maybe it\u2019s the same as God. And monotheism is not so far\naway from monism. I have learned a lot from Ratunda, I had a wonderful, wonderful teacher. A\nswami that was here for several years is teaching now in Chile. And what I learned through my\nhusband -- I myself would na -- would not have come to this, is -- is not to be -- it -- it\u2019s gold to\nme. It\u2019s more than gold, it\u2019s an inner richness that I received.",
        "Q: Do you consider yourself to have a religion in the way that people label religion these days?",
        "A: No, definitely not. I -- I\u2019m a free thinker, and as I said, I had some -- I have some friends at\nthe Quakers, I have attended some of their sittings, just for meditation, and they are very good to\nme. I don\u2019t know if my family here in Scarsdale ap -- appreciates it. They are very much into the\nReform Judaism, which is very good. I go with them at the Jewish holidays for service there. But\nit\u2019s too much materialism amongst we Jews. And they have to do much more self searching, and\ngiving. With that I want to end.",
        "Q: What\u2019s that?",
        "A: With that I want to end.",
        "Q: Oh, you want to end.",
        "A: And I still have anot --",
        "Q: One thing I\u2019m wondering about is when it was that you finally felt healthy again, after the\nwar, and after being in the hospital, a couple different places. When were you feeling healthy?",
        "A: I would say a hundred percent healthy I did not f-feel ever. I ge -- always had a tiredness\nabout myself. Wasn\u2019t very able to do a lot of things, and very soon exhausted. But once I met my\nhusband, who was a mountain climber, a hiker -- I was also a hiker before that, I must say I have\nwalked, I love to walk. He changed my whole outlook, and introduced me to the eastern\nphilosophies, and I learned yoga, I taught it about eight years here in Greenburg, in the adult\neducation center, and also at the high school, at -- at the co -- co-op in the Bronx, Truman High\nSchool for adult education, and also for teenagers towards the end. And I also taught yoga here\nand there when I was asked by some organization, or make a demonstration. When the Madison\nSquare Garden was still in existence, I had a headstand on the stage of Madison Square Garden.\nNot alone, with two other students of the swami at that time.",
        "Q: And how do you see your experiences, what you went through during the war, having\naffected your -- your own interest in religion? Do you think it\u2019s directly connected what you\nwent through, and then sort of this exploration that you\u2019ve been on?",
        "A: I-I think that is a question of development. I was very much impressed first with science. But\nscience also does not give all the answers. And I was in the medical field, in laboratories, doing\nresearch, especially in human blood, and sera, and so on, and so forth. And routine analysis of all\nfluids. My husband also was a chemist, and we discussed a lot of s-sciences, and so on and so\nforth. It left me with some questions and doubt, and it was sometimes quasi quasi, there were not\nhundred percent answers to anything. When my husband branched out into philosophy and\nreligion, I got a whiff of it, and he passed it on to me, and he would be proud today if he would\nbe alive to see me pursue it so vigorously.",
        "Q: Do you feel in other ways that -- that what you experienced during the war really stayed with\nyou throughout the years after? Are there certain things that --",
        "A: That humans can be very cruel to each other, and we talk about heart, and love, and so on and\nso forth, but the -- the principle of self preservation is so strong, that any human being resorts to\nany criminal action, even killing another human being, maybe a -- even a sibling for his self\npreservation. So this all has to be worked out by men. And I think I got wiser by having had this\nexperience, and I wonder what the other side will bring, if there is another side, and so more\nlearning, and more experiencing. We don\u2019t know. I have my doubts, like everybody else, and to\nerase doubt is the hardest thing of any journey, I think. If you don\u2019t have any more doubts, then\nyou are a saint.",
        "Q: Did you -- I -- I felt that you had told me over the phone that perhaps one -- one way that the\nexperiences during the Holocaust stayed with you is that you decided not to have children, is that\n-- 1s that right?",
        "A: That was my husband\u2019s decision, more or less. And then I had this toxic pregnancy, or\nwhatever it was, it was never found out. But I had a very bad case of hepatitis, and was sick for\nseven weeks in Presbyterian Hospital in New York. So after that, my gynecologist, who was Dr.\nGisela Pearl said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want children, just don\u2019t have them.\u201d And the sex life was not the\nmost important thing for me. Maybe when I was younger, yes, but not at that time.",
        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t as much an active decision not to bring children into the world, as --",
        "A: No, it was not an act of precision, but my husband took precaution always.",

        "A: He didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t want. He had a strong feelings that the suffering on this planet is very --\nhe said planet earth is one of the most insignificant planets in this universe. And he learned that\nfrom Gerchiev, the Russian philosopher mystic. And he dabbled into that, and why perpetuate\nthis race, and we really don\u2019t know if we ever will know.

        "A: No, I must say, very little. Very little. It sort of vanished. It\u2019s not preoccupying my mind.\nUnfortunately, my physical body gives me a lot of problems on. I dwell on that too much. If I\ncould get over that, and re-realize that a body 1s just the case of -- or the temple of our real\nexistence, if we -- if I could bring that to a real understanding, and strong idea, I would be better\noff. But I have only si -- grace, I think was given to me, to survive, and to -- to learn, and to\nreach this country, and learn, and I\u2019m still learning.",
        "Q: And did you have -- do you remember having any dreams or night mares during the war,\nanything that came to you on a regular, recurring basis back then?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. It\u2019s too bad. But I must say occasionally now when I\u2019m -- I am alone, and I\nhave had periods of depression and anxiety, once or twice I have had bad dreams where I jumped\nout of bed, and the dream is just -- flies away, and I can\u2019t remember. But these are not very nice\nexperiences. I don\u2019t know if they have to do with the war, because I don\u2019t remember too much\nabout it.",
        "Q: And what about your parents and brother, do you -- do you try to not think about them, do\nyou try to think of them?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think of them very much, unfortunately, I should. My brother\u2019s birthday is coming up,\nwould -- he would be now two years younger than I am. So I think about him because he was so\nyoung taken away, and he suffered so much more by having had typhus in Theresienstadt, and --\nand right away to the gas chambers, it\u2019s very, very sad. And I see him sometimes in the attic\nwhere we lived in Battenberg with me, and that night when Crystal Night took place. How we\ntwo huddled together. We were innocent, young. Didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "Q: Well, one thing I just wanted to ask. When we started the interview I actually forgot to make\nsure that you stated the date, and the year you were born. So, if you wouldn\u2019t mind just\nrepeating, saying your name, and where you were born, and the date you were born.",
        "A: I was born on the fifth of February, 1928, by a midwife helping my mother, in Battenberg on\nthe Aida in Germany.",
        "Q: And finally, is there anything else you would like to add that maybe I forgot to ask, that you\nwould like to say during this interview?",
        "A: No, I think I talked already too much. I gave a lot of myself, and my husband always warned\nme, he said, \u201cKeef -- kit -- keep it for yourself, keep it inside, it helps you to develop.\u201d So maybe\nI made a mistake to open myself.",
        "Q: [hope not, and I don\u2019t think so. I think -- I think it -- I think it\u2019s also good to help others\nunderstand what you experienced. I think that\u2019s part of sharing, and --",

        "Q: And you didn\u2019t feel anti-Semitism after the war in Germany?",
        "Q: How did you -- there was also, I think, a document you sent to the museum, something from a\nRussian sergeant allowing you to go from one zone to the next.",
        "Q: The museum have a copy of this? Do you know?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And what does it say, or what do you -- what -- what did it help you to do?",
        "Q: So tell me about this document, when did y -- how did you --",
        "Q: So --",
        "Q: Memorial?",
        "Q: No, not in Miami.",
        "Q: So from my understanding, after the war, you were first in a hospital for about five weeks in -\n- in the same area --",
        "Q: But -- but -- but before that, were you still --",
        "Q: Is that where you met the Russian sergeant who gave you this document?",
        "Q: And had you grown up speaking Yiddish, did you know Yiddish?",
        "Q: And did you grow up learning Hebrew?",
        "Q: So after -- after that is when you walked. You walked, and then you took a train in the end of\nyour journey.",
        "Q: How long were you on this walking journey, were you with other people?",
        "Q: Did you have any feelings of resentment toward anybody at that time?",
        "Q: So what is your feeling about this idea of forgiveness, or do you think about it in that way?",
        "Q: And you have shown an interest in studying other religions, as well.",
        "Q: Do you consider yourself to have a religion in the way that people label religion these days?",
        "Q: What\u2019s that?",
        "Q: Oh, you want to end.",
        "Q: One thing I\u2019m wondering about is when it was that you finally felt healthy again, after the\nwar, and after being in the hospital, a couple different places. When were you feeling healthy?",
        "Q: And how do you see your experiences, what you went through during the war, having\naffected your -- your own interest in religion? Do you think it\u2019s directly connected what you\nwent through, and then sort of this exploration that you\u2019ve been on?",
        "Q: Do you feel in other ways that -- that what you experienced during the war really stayed with\nyou throughout the years after? Are there certain things that --",
        "Q: Did you -- I -- I felt that you had told me over the phone that perhaps one -- one way that the\nexperiences during the Holocaust stayed with you is that you decided not to have children, is that\n-- 1s that right?",
        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t as much an active decision not to bring children into the world, as --",
        "Q: He -- he felt he did not want children.",

        "Q: And did you have -- do you remember having any dreams or night mares during the war,\nanything that came to you on a regular, recurring basis back then?",
        "Q: And what about your parents and brother, do you -- do you try to not think about them, do\nyou try to think of them?",
        "Q: Well, one thing I just wanted to ask. When we started the interview I actually forgot to make\nsure that you stated the date, and the year you were born. So, if you wouldn\u2019t mind just\nrepeating, saying your name, and where you were born, and the date you were born.",
        "Q: And finally, is there anything else you would like to add that maybe I forgot to ask, that you\nwould like to say during this interview?",
        "Q: [hope not, and I don\u2019t think so. I think -- I think it -- I think it\u2019s also good to help others\nunderstand what you experienced. I think that\u2019s part of sharing, and --",
        "Q: But thank you. Thank you very much. This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum interview with Gisela Zamora."

        "Answer: I am Gisela Zamora. I was born -- my maiden name was Eckstain, in Battenberg unda\nAida in Germany.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s family had lived in Battenberg at least for two or three generations. They were\nknown as the Lanksdorfs. My mother was a born Neuberger, and sh -- I\u2019m sorry, she was an -- a\nborn Marx, and the Neubergers married a Lanksdorf, and the children all came, more or less\nfrom that family.",
        "A: Battenberg 1s a beautiful little 1 -- town, it\u2019s actually a village located at 800 meters elevation,\nand was considered in Germany sort of a spa, what they called Luftcore art. And it had\napproximately, I would say, seven or eight Jewish families. My grandfather Marx, Moses Marx,\ncame from the Rhineland, Achen, and established himself there, married my grandmother, and\nhad a -- a shoe business. He sold sh -- shoes all over the area. He went by bicycle many times,\nand we had the -- a regular store at the bottom of our building, which was quite big.",
        "A: Very small Jewish community, definitely.",
        "A: We knew everyone, and some were even interrelated. I\u2019m in touch with the second cousin,\nthat lives across the river, in nua -- Nyack, and we see each other occasionally.",
        "A: Yeah, my fa -- my mother was introduced to my father, she was a youngest daughter of some\nMarx\u2019s, they had six children, three boys, and three girls, and she was the youngest, and felt after\nmy grandfather passed away, she had to take care of her mother, Beena Marx. And Sevra stayed\nin Battenberg. My father was born in Fleet bachin Hesse, sort of as -- bigger town, which was\nwhat you call a Christstadt in German. And he went to a technical school to learn agronomy.\nAnd he was employed by a man named Louie Marx, who was my mother\u2019s brother. Ne -- not\nLouie Marx himself, but his -- his firma, which was at that time called Deutsch and Marx or\nsomething like that, I don\u2019t remember. And Louie Marx took my father once up to Battenberg,\nand this way my mother met him, and they became engaged, and married in 1926.",
        "A: So my father, who was an academic man, had during the early years a very good job with the\nWhymara government, inst -- instructing the farmers how to slaughter, when to slaughter, the\nright time to sow, or to reap, because Germany was very much interested in having a good\nagricultural f -- f -- what you would call a method, to feed it\u2019s people without too much imports\nat that time. But in 1933, when Hitler came to power, my father lost his job, because he was\ngovernment employed. And he took over my fath -- my grandfather\u2019s shoe business, but at that\ntime already, it was going downhill, and he couldn\u2019t really make a very good living from that. So\nthis went through a couple of months, even I would say a year or two, and the anti-Semitism\ncame to Battenberg very early. It was really a nest -- I call it a real nest of Nazis, and trying to\nget rid of all the Jews, and specially confiscate their business. So my mo -- my father decided it\nwas better for him, and for us, for the family, to move to Friedberg where his parents had a\nhome. At that time in the Judengasser, which was at -- at very early times in the 16\" century,\nghetto. But it was quite a nice little street, the houses were one on the -- one on the other, and we\nhad the three floor house, my father put in plumbing, which by that time they didn\u2019t have there.\nAnd we children, I had a brother by the way, his name was Norbert, who was born two years\nafter me, in 1930, went to school in Bard Nowheim, which was a spa approximately three\nkilometers from Friedberg and had a Jewish cabearks -- ca -- gaminda shula, excuse me. A -- as\n-- a school that took in all the children from the surrounding area. It was located in a beautiful\narea, and had very good reputation as a -- a school of first class. And we went to this school till\n1938, I would say -- \u00b039, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Well, unfortunately we were children, didn\u2019t realize the difficult times my parents went\nthrough, especially raising us, bringing in the money to send us to school, and to feed us and so\non. My mother was very fragile, but my father was a very strong man. He was an officer in the\nfirst World War, so he was wounded, and had a paralysis on the right hand, and the right arm\nwas completely stiff. He was wonderful, he was able to do everything with his left. And made\nsure that we children go to school, was -- got very disciplined, and my mother sort of was weak\nin this. And we -- when we wanted something, we always went to our father, especially me. I\ncannot talk to -- about my -- my brother, we sort of at that time were very young, and had many\nlittle fights, or spats, I would call them.",
        "A: Iremember very much living there, and I loved the area, because it\u2019s in a what\u2019s called\nThrowtargabeerga in German, and on the Aida, which was the biggest -- had the biggest dam,\nabout 10 kilometers away in Germany. As a matter of fact, it was just finished when Hitler was\nin power, and he made a lot of propaganda for it. He wanted to imitate the Hoover dam at that\ntime.",
        "A: Definitely. I have a non-Jewish friend who is writing me regularly, we are in contact. But we\nonly got in contact three years ago when I went back to Battenberg just to see the town, and I\ndidn\u2019t recognize it, 1t had changed so much.",
        "A: Very -- yes. The one thing we had there, we had a neighbor who was -- his name was George,\nI don\u2019t remember his last name, he threw stones into our windows all the time, and we had\nconstantly to repair windows. They were -- and we children were persecuted. We had to walk\napproximately one and a half miles to school, I would say, since we lived on the upper part of the\ntown, and the ch -- the school was in the lower part. So children were already throwing stones at\nus, and we were ostracized. As a matter of fact, at the end they put us 1n the back row in school,\nnext to the Gypsies.",
        "A: I felt this very much.",
        "A: I -- I -- I felt this per -- persecution, and an incident happened, I should really not tell this\nhere, but it\u2019s -- since these Gypsies sat next to us, there were two boys, they all the time exposed\nthemselves towards us, and played around with their sex organ, and that left a terrible impression\non me all my life. And there was one Jewish -- one non-Jewish boy, who was the son of the\nphysician in the town, who went up to the teacher and told her, and she actually did nothing\nabout it, because she was part of the Nazi party. But my father realized it\u2019s time that we have to\ngo. And since our immigration was pulled here, and pulled there, because of my father\u2019s injury\nduring the first World War, it was s -- rejected by the US at that time, and we tried other\ncountries, and you needed an awful lot of money, and since my father was not employed since\n1933, it was very difficult. We lived really, on a very wealthy aunt, who send us money and --\nand bought us clothing, and helped us all along, as long as she could.",
        "A: 10 years. Wait a minute, yes, I was born twen -- 10 years.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: To Friedberg.",
        "A: It was much more -- less tense, and much more liberal in a way. And there were a couple of\nhalf Jewish people, families, that helped us during the night. We had -- my father was a -- a -- a -\n- a special person to an old woman, who was in her 70\u2019s at that time. She came in the middle of\nthe night to bring us some food. She was very di -- attached to my father. And the town itself 1s\nlarger, it\u2019s like White Plains, New York. As a matter of -- see, 1t was a -- it\u2019s county seats -- the\ncounty seat of Hesse, Nassaw.",
        "A: Actually Hesse, not Nassaw, Hesse.",
        "A: My mother was very observant of the Jewish laws, and she cooked kosher, and ub -- I would\nnot say that it was overly kosher, but my father was very much on the other side, since he used to\ngo to farmers, and they used to give him pork and sausages when he was an agronomist and\nworked for the government. So he didn\u2019t believe in any of these dietary laws. And sometimes he\ntook us children along, and we tasted pork, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell your mom.\u201d The first thing\nwhen we came into the house, naturally children say, \u201cDo you know where we went? Daddy\ntook us to this and this farmer, and we had a wonderful bratwurst.\u201d And my mother almost\nexploded. But those were incidents that were still pretty good. And 1 -- when we were then in\nFriedberg, my father had a lot of friends. School friends, and he was a good athlete. He used to\nplay very good football, and he used to belong to a league, and some of the Germans that tried to\ncontact us -- or contact him, did so. But it got less and less as time goes on. And --",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if they didn\u2019t leave any spa -- the favorite one was probably Passover. Well,\nnaturally Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. At that time I was too immature to know what it 1s.\nNow, in my old age, I\u2019m searching for my background, and for different, and look into different\nreligions, and I\u2019m comparing it to, specially Yoga, Redunta and Buddhism. I\u2019m very much into\nthat right now.",
        "A: We -- we -- well, we went to school in Bad Nauheim, we took the train every morning, which\nwas only 10 minutes. And the schools there was also a children\u2019s home, where children who --\nwho pa -- whose parents were already separated, or immigrated someplace. It had a children\u2019s\nhome, but at the same time it took all the children by -- how would you call it, coming there from\nthe surrounding area. You didn\u2019t have to live in this children\u2019s home to go to that school. It was\ncalled the besere -- Bitseerik shula. That means of the whole county, Jewish children could come\nby train, by bus, whatever. And I remember I have a very good friend, Eva Forest, whose --\nwhose maiden name was Warburg. She was brought by limousine still, since she was a relative\nof the Warburgs, a wealthy Jewish family.",
        "A: I would say it was \u00b038, \u201939 and maybe beginning of \u201940, but then they closed that school, the\nNazis closed the school, and if you wanted to further our e-education, we had to get to Frankfurt\namine. So through the joint Jewish community of the German gu -- [indecipherable] German\nReich, at that time, made sure that children that didn\u2019t have the means to lodge there, to place\nthem in homes, and also children\u2019s homes. And I would say we went there in beginning of 40\nfor about a year and a half, which was a wonderful experience. Frankfurt is a big city, very\nliberal for German standards. It was always against the -- the Kaiser, and had some prominent\nnon-Nazis. So some of the Jewish institutions were still working, and one of them is the\nphilanthrop -- was the philanthropine, the school that was boser [indecipherable] and a -- a part\nof the school taught even in English, you could get your diploma in English, and regular German\nfolkshula. Ma -- my husband, by the way, has a diploma, or let\u2019s say high school f -- liseum\ndiploma from philanthropine in Frankfurt.",
        "A: He was several years older than I was, so --",
        "A: No, never. He was seven years older than I was.",
        "A: Oh definitely, I remember that, and so well. In the morning they came for my father, and he\nwas rounded up with a lot of men to Buchenwald, which we later found out that, we didn\u2019t know\nat that time. And my mother, since we had that three story building, had a big attic, my mother\nput us all the way up into the attic, and said, \u201cYou be very quiet when they come here.\u201d And they\ndid come, but they never went the s -- above the second floor, but they threw out all our -- my\nmother had a lot of miesen, and porc -- other porcelain, crystal, threw it out of the windows.\nDemolished the dining room, and living room, sort of furniture threw out of the window. But\nphysically we were not apprehended, because first of all they never knew where we children\nwere, and weren\u2019t interested. And my mother, I have no recollection where she stayed. She must\nhave stayed on the third floor also, and just watched. But my father was gone for about four and\na half weeks, till he came back from Buchenwald. And I remember my mother preparing a bath\nfor him. At that time we didn\u2019t have bathrooms like here, except we had a flush toilet. And she\nmade hot water in a sink ba -- basin, and washed my father from top to head, because he was\nsmelling so much. And the -- we continued to live in Friedberg during all this time, going to\nschool in Frankfurt, and my parents living in Friedberg, coming occasionally to Frankfurt to visit\nus, to see how we are doing. And also on vacation time we went home. And in 1940, or \u00b041 -- I\nhave a friend who could -- who knows the exact date, but I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: The schools were closed, all Jewish schools, all education to all J-Jewish people was -- was\neliminated.",
        "A: I was --",
        "A: I did not realize this, and we were too young to realize it. I was barely 14, my brother was 12.\nSo we felt it in a way, but not really that it -- it harmed us in a way. We still had Jewish children\nto play with, till later on everybody immigrated and very few children were left. That was the\ngreatest thing that I feel now is that was very sad, that I had nobody to play with, to talk to. Only\nmy brother.",
        "A: During the year \u201940, \u201941, that was sad time, and people still could immigrate.",
        "A: Never, never, he -- they were absolutely don\u2019t tell the children. My mother and my father kept\nthis from us. They were very protective. I would never have known. I didn\u2019t know till I myself\nended up in Auschwitz, how these things might have been. The one thing that happened during\nthat time, my father was one of 12 children, and he had a brother, the oldest brother really, who\nwas married to a non-Jew, because he learned watch making in Switzerland, and he met this\nwoman, and got her pregnant, and my grandfather insi -- my grandmother insisted on him\nmarrying this girl. And she came to us in 19 -- goes back to 1920 -- \u201928, I guess. I wasn\u2019t even\nborn yet. So she was part of the family, and he was with my f -- my uncle was with my father in\nBuchenwald, and he was the first one to be killed there. They send his ashes to his wife, who was\nSwiss born, and all her children, the children that they had, had half Swiss citizenship, so they\ncouldn\u2019t do anything to them, they survived.",
        "A: Yes, somehow or other we heard about it, as -- as children, but it didn\u2019t make much\nimpression.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: A very positive experience, because I was with only Jewish children.",
        "A: No, not -- not at that time any more. A-Also, there was a half-Jewish couple, he was non-\nJewish, and she was Jewish, but they were -- were Communists, very Leftist, and he was, at one\ntime in the Wymar Republic, like a delegate to the Congress in Berlin. And they came to see us,\nand he was not afraid. He was a non-Jew, his wife was a Jewish woman. He was not afraid of\nthem, and he had many bouts with them -- the Nazis and at the end he was also brought to\nDachau, but he survived. And I lived with them till I came to this country. To -- with him, his\nwife was killed. But that\u2019s after the war.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I wa -- at first I was in the children\u2019s home, and then they placed us in families, because they -\n- they had such an overflow in the kinderheim, that they had to take -- they had to get Jewish\nfamily that had enough room, were wealthy, to take in some of these children. So I came to one\nwealthy family in the west end of Frankfurt who owned a -- a palatial home, which was naturally\nconfiscated while I was there, by the Nazis, and they had --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Say --",
        "A: Well, I was never separated really, only by small distances at that time. I still could go home.\nIt meant you had to take a train from Frankfurt to Friedberg, which was possible. Even so, we\nwere -- we wore the star, the yellow star already, and we had to be s-sitting in a certain\ncompartment. And it was very shameful for us kids, somehow. I mean, we were a little bit\nintimidated, sitting where we were sitting. And -- but what I remember about this family is they\nhad a housekeeper who came from Battenberg, and she had a terrible nervous condition, and\nshook with her hands, and her head, and this is now coming into my mind when I think about\nmyself getting old, and sometimes I have these anxiety attacks, and I start to shake a little bit,\nand that brings me back to that time.",
        "A: Selma Lermenstein. I don\u2019t think she survived.",
        "A: They went to Theresienstadt where we were transported at that time too, in 1942. But before\nthat, they already -- since the schools were closed, they already were placed in a -- an -- an old\nage home, more or less, and I don\u2019t know what happened to Selma Lermenst-stein. We children\ncame back home, and waited for deportation.",
        "A: It was yellow star, with black rim. Well we -- we had to, as soon as we went to school in Bad\nNauheim, already we had that ta -- I think in 1939, right away when this -- before the war yet. I\nwould say \u00b039, after the war with Poland had started. It came slowly, everything came slowly.\nMy mother had to part with her fur coat, with her silver, and her jewelry. Every year there was,\nor every couple of months there was a raid that you had to bring certain things for the possible\nwar that they are going to fight against the allies. And this was a very hard thing for my mother,\nto -- dawa -- to part with material possessions. I think I learned from that. I am giving away\nalready now many of my possessions, and I am very grateful that I had a husband who made\ngood money during his career, and I had a nice home, but I know that I will have to leave it, and\nI\u2019m trying to learn non-attachment to material things.",
        "A: We -- we weren\u2019t allowed to listen to any foreign stations, but this Communist, this -- who\nwas married to a Jewish wife, used to come and tell my father what was said, because he was\nlistening clandestinely, apparently, in -- in a group of people, and used to tell him what\nhappened. But at that time the Germans made big progress into Poland, then into France, and by\nthat time a lot of Jews were already deported to the east, and we were lucky to be there yet till\n\u201940 -- lucky? I wouldn\u2019t say lucky -- till September \u201942, when we were rounded up. And as I\nsaid, our luck was that my father was an officer in the first World War, and he had the Purple\nCross, the German ahtler, and whe -- we were privileged to go to Theresienstadt. And needless to\nsay, for my parents it was a very terrible thing, but we children didn\u2019t realize what it meant for\nthem. We came to Theresienstadt, and we saw a lot of children, and we were able to play, and\ncongregate with them, and that was very important for my psyche, because I was so\nexcommunicated from -- from children in Germany, let\u2019s say, or separated. I don\u2019t find the right\nword I want to express.",
        "A: Mu -- yes, better for me, and at -- the good thing was that my father, since he was also an\nacademic, and he had a background in the Whymara government that he got a job in the Judenrat\nin Theresienstadt, which was a big privilege. Also, he was a very minor, minor official. My\nmother used to say he probably has to sweep the floors of the -- of the Judenrat, of the bigshots\nthere. That\u2019s about all that -- but that enabled him for us, between my brother and myself, to get\nus into kinderheim. At first we thought we both were going to go to the kinderheim, but\nsomehow or other there was such an overflow of children they didn\u2019t have enough room, so we\nhad to choose between -- my parents had to choose between my brother and myself, and they\ndecided that I should go to the kinderheim.",
        "A: I have no idea, my -- I -- I couldn\u2019t get along with my mother so well, like girls do with --\nsometimes, with mothers. My father thought that I was the older one, that I should go. That was\nactually for me a wonderful experience, since food was naturally the first thing on our mind, but\nbeing with the same group of people, being able to communicate it, to learn. Because in the\nkinderheim, every room had a sort of a teacher that had to keep us busy. And I remembered we\nhad a girl named Hoyman -- Eta Hoyman, she was very well known in Germany in the Zionist\nmovement. And she read books with us, we learned history of Palestine, and it was a very good,\nwonderful experience. However, it didn\u2019t last, like nothing lasts. Unfortunately, my brother\nduring that time became sick with typhus and was quarantined. My mother was terribly upset\nabout it, and I had to try to cheer her up a little bit here and there, and I have made acquaintance\nwith a pianist in Theresienstadt, and she was in the entertainment part, and she got us tickets to\nvarious performances. And my mother liked it very much, and I used to go with her in the\nafternoons or evenings.",
        "A: Yes, only in Theresienstadt. It was the -- as everybody knows, the camp that they -- the\nghettos that was open to show how well the Jews were treated.",
        "A: I -- my mother always said, \u201cAs soon as you see these black shirts, or the brown shirts\nmarching down the main street,\u201d in Battenberg when we were small, because that was a nest of\nNazis, \u201cyou come straight into the house.\u201d They -- they put a -- a fear into us children.",
        "A: Only as I said, when we walked to the school in the morning, many times children of -- of\nNazis were trying to persecute us, and hit us, and -- but somehow or other, I had sort of a lucky\nstar, and I don\u2019t remember the real bad, bad, bad episodes, except that at night we always were\nafraid to go to sleep, because of the stones that came into the window.",
        "A: That was still in Battenberg, in Friedberg that never happened.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I really don\u2019t remember, but it could well be. I have a book here from the\nphila -- about the philanthropine, and maybe we can look it up.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that, I only remember that in the last few months I did not go to school\nany more, I stayed home with my parents, and I helped out in a old age home, washing floors, I\nwas 14, and they made me scrub the floors. Had to kneel down -- was backbreaking work for a\n14 year old.",
        "A: Na -- just -- it\u2019s a school. Between \u00b041 and \u201942, till our deportation.",
        "A: The de -- de -- deportation was a horrible experience because we were all taken to a point in\nDarmstardt, which is south of Frankfurt, a major city, and apparently they had Quonset huts\nthere, and they rounded up all the Jews from the arou -- surrounding areas, all the people from\nHesse, Frankfurt, and the bigger cities nearby. And we were sort of divided in groups, and it\ndepended on your status in Germany, and as I said, my father had that luck, that we -- wasn\u2019t the\nluck for him, unfortunately, he lost his life, but that we were on the -- so that we are put on the\nside to go to Theresienstadt. His brother -- and we were very close to them, this -- this 1s not the\nsame brother as the one that was killed in Buchenwald -- well, that was really later -- a younger\nbrother, who lived in Bad Nauheim with his family, they had two boys, and they were put on the\nside to go to the east. And my father tried everything to -- for them to be with us, but it didn\u2019t --\nhe couldn\u2019t do anything about it. So then the actual, when we find -- I don\u2019t know what we ate\nthere, I\u2019ve no idea what -- what the rations were. The rations in Germany already were very poor.\nFor us poorer than for the general public, but we -- we depended on potatoes, cabbage, and what\ndo you call these? Halloween --",
        "A: Pumpkins. I mean, they were not like -- they were not quite as big as pumpkins, but some\nkind of --",
        "A: Like a turnip, that\u2019s right, it was a turnip, a sort of a winter vegetable that you could still s --\nkeep over the window, and the Germans had warehouses of these things, apparently. Potatoes by\nthe -- they had to, because they had nothing else. And finally, two or three days later, we were\nput into a -- a -- into a railroad. Naturally the -- what do you call them, the wagons that had no\nwindows, and they are used for transport of good and animals. And we got taken to\nTheresienstadt.",
        "A: We had each a -- a -- I would say s -- we were allowed certain amount of pounds, I don\u2019t\nremember, maybe 50 pounds in the suitcases. Food, my mother packed up some food, clothing,\nand everybody, we had to carry our own. My parents -- my father ke -- tried to carry my\nbrother\u2019s package, whatever, and we came to Theresienstadt with our own clothes yet. Whatever\nwe could take along. We left many things behind.",

        "A: I wouldn\u2019t s -- I don\u2019t remember, maybe a week or two.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Theresienstadt, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes, I remember it was a beautiful fall day, and somehow or other, I -- I looked out -- I don\u2019t\nknow if it had windows, or just holes, and I saw the landscape, I was very much impressed,\nbecause he went along the Elba, down to S-Sudatenland, which is today Czechoslovakia. It was a\nbeautiful, scenic area, always was impressed by nature, because Battenberg was such a beautiful,\nbeautiful situated town.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know. When we arrived -- I don\u2019t know, maybe my parents knew, but I doubt it.\nWhen we got to Theresienstadt, we were all put into a -- a compound, and my father, as usual,\nwas able to get to a compound where there were prominent Jews, like lawyers, and professionals.\nThey sort of had this all divided there. And we stayed on the floor, and we had straw sacks to\nsleep on, maybe -- it depended on the room how many people, 20 - 25, and that is not very nice.",
        "A: As -- when -- when my father finally -- I would say about less than a half a year. Then I was\nable to get to the kinderheim.",
        "A: Yes, definitely, and there were a lot of Slovakian Jews, Czechs Jews, and Jews from all parts\nof Germany, some Austrians, and later on we also had Dutch Jews. And somehow or other there\nwas ill-feelings sometimes between this Jews, where they came from, what they did, and so on\nand so forth. I have to think of this today, cause humankind does not learn from -- from these\nthings, apparently. It continues, and continues in this world.",
        "A: Yeah, together till I was put into the na -- kinderheim, which was just a couple of blocks\naway, but that was a revelation for me, and I loved the learning there. It -- 1t was something that -\n- and spiritually it helped me to be with other Jewish children, en masse. There was competition\nin school, in writing, in reading, and knowing certain answers and so on. And I always had a\ndrive to be -- I had a big ego to be on top, whatever, which naturally I had competitions there\nvery much, but it kept me alive.",
        "A: Yes, because a lot of the old people around us passed away. They just couldn\u2019t take it. And\nwe saw that, even in our room, and every morning somebody was sick, had even -- had diarrhea,\nand it smelled, or vomiting, and awful -- awful things. This was very, very bad for us children,\nbut since I later on decided in this country to be working in the medical profession, when I think\nabout this now, it really is part of human suffering.",
        "A: [indecipherable] time.",
        "A: No, it was between ourselves, since we had Eta Hoyman, we learned a lot of -- about\nPalestine, the history of the Zionist movement, and she wanted to inflame in all of us a desire to\ngo to the homeland of the Jews.",
        "A: Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know. I -- I did and I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: I enjo-joyed learning and reading classical novels. She read to us every night for at least an\nhour. And some of the children, naturally didn\u2019t pay attention, but I was there, I -- I couldn\u2019t pull\nmyself away from that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, I had a -- a flair for gardening, so they selected me to work in what they\ncalled the [indecipherable] garden. And I had a girlfriend, passed away not so long ago, we both\nwere working there, we raised, for the Nazis naturally, tomatoes and spinach, and -- but we were\nable to eat here and there a tomato, when nobody looked. And they noticed that I made very nice\nbeds, you know, the flower, not -- the beds for the vegetables, so they selected me to rake -- to\nrake the beds nice and straight, and make them four or five inches high from the ground, and so\non. And that I enjoyed very much. And every night I went home, putting a tomato, or a potato\nunder my armpits. If we had been caught, we would have been sent right away to some prison.\nThere was a prison nearby, but I brought this to my mother, and she was forever grateful when\nshe had something like this, to feed my brother.",
        "A: But it was a short time, it was maybe one summer, and one fall. Is it finished?",
        "A: Yes, please. I --",
        "A: Yes. My father\u2019s name was Bertholdt Eckstain. My mother\u2019s name was Bertha Eckstain, born\nMarx, M-a-r-x. My brother\u2019s name was Norbert, N-o-r-b-e-r-t Eckstain.",
        "A: My middle name was Bina, B-i-n-a, which was my grandmother\u2019s name, on mother\u2019s side.",
        "A: Yes, I had an aunt, she was more German than the Germans, very wealthy woman, married to\na very wealthy horse dealer, in -- Jewish horse dealer in Germany, and she was thinking it should\nbe a German name. She had a preference for me. She as herself couldn\u2019t get children, so she\nnamed me Gisela.",
        "A: I would say so. They were very assimilated, especially my mother\u2019s family. You had to be if\nyou lived in a small town.",
        "A: I know that I was in L four -- 414 in the kinderheim, but before that --",
        "A: Yeah, I understand. And near there was a kine -- it doesn\u2019t say there.",
        "A: Yes, it was on the right side of the kinderheim.",
        "A: [indecipherable] children\u2019s home.",
        "A: We were -- we were in the Hanover barracks when we arrived, till I got to the kinderheim,\nwhich was L fear hundred -- 414, the German kinderheim.",
        "A: Oh, I could see them any time. It was a little walk to get to them, but most of my time was\nspent with the other children. We were always busy. We were kept busy from morning till night.",
        "A: Till we were deported.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, it -- when we were allowed to go out without -- we could go anywheres without\nguardians, Jewish guardians. So we once in awhile went just through to the main square, or went\nto a concert, or something that was offered at that time.",
        "A: Yes, I worked -- we worked in the Veshalie garden, which 1s outside the ghetto, we were\nmarched there, and we were marched back. And I --",
        "A: And occasionally we\u2019re examined if we took anything into the camp, so everybody was very\nafraid if you took a potato or two, or a tomato or two, or some spinach underneath our clothing.",
        "A: That we brought -- I brought to my mother, she was very grateful for this.\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, we had to get up early in the morning, get our ration of food, whatever it was, and we\nhad a very string -- string -- strict -- I\u2019m sorry, strict teacher, that led us to -- in -- in to a sort of a\ncircle, we sat down on the floor, and she told us -- she read to us, and we had naturally, intervals\nwhere we could go to the bathroom. Many of us had diarrhea from the food, from unsanitary\nconditions. We slept too many people in -- on one bunk, and usually on the -- on Saturdays we\nwere free. And I had my first experience of relationship with the opposite text -- sex. That means\nonly platonically. He was a singer from the Czech opera, and I happened to be, on a nice sunny\nday, in a new outfit that my mother made for me from some rags. And I sat myself down on\nsome stones, and there comes this man, sat next to me, and I recognized him right away, and told\nhim that he was at the opera. So he gave me a kiss, and hugged me. And he promised to be there\nthe next week, and unfortunately I arrived, waited there for an hour with tears in my eyes, and I\nnever saw him again.",
        "A: Iam sorry, I forgot.",
        "A: I had a crush on him. That was my first crush.",
        "A: Pm going on 15 --",
        "A: -- or f -- almost 16.",
        "A: No, we always were hungry, and if we could somehow or other catch anywheres a little bit\nextra, that was special.",
        "A: Yes, and sometimes in the afternoons, and then when my f -- my brother got sick with typhus,\nI was not allowed to go there for awhile, because it was disinfected, and my mother didn\u2019t want\nme to come there. So I met them on the outside once in awhile. But generally I was so happy and\n-- to be in the kinderheim, that I had not this desire that I would have today to see my parents.\nWe were young, and so wrapped up with being young, trying to learn and enjoy ourselves. So,\nthese horrible things were left sort of not to dwell on. We saw every day wagons with corpses\ngoing by, because we were right on the main street, and they were being taken out of the ghetto\nto a mass grave. But your -- every day you saw at least two or three wagons with several people\nin there. Mostly elderly people.",
        "A: None at all. We were so -- we were so childlike. I think today\u2019s teenagers would think\ndifferent, but we were so ignorant.",
        "A: No, we ne -- I don\u2019t think I remember anybody sending us packages, because all my family\nfrom my mother\u2019s side -- [phone rings] Ah, I\u2019m sorry. [indecipherable] where we were.",
        "A: Not at all. I know the main square.",
        "A: Street.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. The only thing is maybe this --",
        "A: -- teen was what? SS billets, no. Let\u2019s see why -- what.",
        "A: I look -- children\u2019s pavilion during the embellishment. No, that was not [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, no, we were put there. We were taken there when they came and inspected us, and we -\n- we all were fixed up with beautiful hairdos, flowers, and new clothing if -- if they had.",
        "A: Not at all. I-I can\u2019t even remember.",
        "A: Yes, yes, later on we heard that this was an inspection for the Red Cross, for the international\nRed Cross.",
        "A: I -- no, I -- a ve -- we -- you know, I was way in the back, and there were a lot of children, a\nlot of people that they brought there. I think now I\u2019m finds it. L -- Main Street. We were on the\nMain Street. I would say maybe here, these two buildings, one was for just Czech, Slovak\npeople, and one was for the German Dutch children.",
        "A: I do remember nothing very much, except that I was happy to be in company with my own\ngrade -- kind, and I was not a good eater before we left Germany, and that\u2019s why my -- my\nhunger, probably was not so bad that time. I didn\u2019t feel it. Or I felt it, but whatever we got at that\ntime seemed to be a little bit sufficient, even though probably it wasn\u2019t sufficient. But I think it\nwas sufficient for me if they ar -- selected me in Auschwitz to go on labor.",
        "A: Even so, I was small, skinny, not very tall compared to a lot of other girls that were hefty, and\ntal -- and robust, muscular and so on.",
        "A: Well, as I said, the barracks where my parents were e -- were first brought, where one family\nwas put in one little compound, in a corner, next to another family, another family, another\nfamily and so on. And as I said, it was th-the more elite part of the ghetto that we were brought\nto. There were only lawyers, doctors, and prominent people. I remember even one of my\nmathematics teacher from Frankfurt with his family, Dr. Naleftchuwitz, that he was right near us,\nacross this -- from our compound, the same big room. Then there was a famous lawyer,\nLervenstein, whose daughter Ruth Lervenstein? I forgot her first name now, was a very\naccomplished pianist, and performed on the stage in Theresienstadt, and she took me to many of\nher concerts. What I remember most is that a -- the last night before our deportation, my mother\nand | -- that means my father was deported already, a month later my mother and I went to a\nperformance of Hayden\u2019s Creation, and I never will forget that. Next morning we were all\nrounded up for Auschwitz. .",
        "A: Ah, yeah, it impressed me very much to hear that chorus, and I have a ticket to hear it at\nLincoln Center a -- a -- on August 23\", and I wonder what reaction it gives me.",
        "A: Yes, the Czech gen -- gendarmes were with us in the Vesherie garden on the outside. On the\ngeneral they were very humane, let\u2019s say as humane an -- as they could be. They let us work, we\n-- we naturally had to work, but they were not like the Nazis.",
        "A: I never really -- I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No, all of a sudden they said tomorrow -- this is -- in this time my father and lots of other men\nhave to be ready to go on labor on the outside, and they rounded up all younger men in their 30\u2019s\nand 40\u2019s. My father was at that time -- born in \u00b093, f -- about 51 or 52, but very tall, and not\noverweight, and he was amongst those that were selected on this first trip to Auschwitz from\nTheresienstadt, the first men\u2019s transport.",
        "A: August, 1944.",
        "A: Nothing. Maybe it was mentioned, but nobody could make any il -- illustration how it would\nlook. I don\u2019t think I heard anything about it. They only talked about labor camps for the Reich.",
        "A: No, no. As a matter of fact, they duped us when one month later, they said all wifes and\nchildren of the men that were transported last month will now be able to go to the labor camp,\nand live with their husbands. So it should be an enticement to go on this trip. I don\u2019t know if my\nmother f -- did that out of her free will and registered us, or if we were just selected.",
        "A: Well, as we -- as we had a very Zionistic, and also religious hofsayren instead of teacher, Eta\nNoyman, a prominent Zionist and Judaic scholar, she made sure we had a nice celebration on the\nvarious Jewish holidays.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but I was so -- so hungry for knowledge, for knowing things. I was always\ncompetitive even in Frankfurt in the ha -- in the school we went to. And I basically was not a top\nstudent like my friend Eva Warburg, but I was a good student.",
        "A: Science. I was good in mathematics. That was my father\u2019s influence. He had us do arithmetic\nwhen we were four years old. And I remember as a child three years, or four years old, playing\naround with w, because I liked that letter, and made out two v\u2019s and turned it around to make an\nm. All these things, and the n, I made into a u upside down. And those were sort of -- I think\ningenious ideas that not every child has.",
        "A: N-No, no, that\u2019s true. But I sought out those kids that had the same interest.",
        "A: As I said, Eva Hashkowitz Goodman, who just published a book in German. Ouse wonderum\nforloifish nish merklish. She was a good friend of mine, and it was by coincidence that we were -\n- met again in Auschwitz, and she gave me a half a loaf of bread, and I\u2019ll never, never forget that.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I had a lot of good friends in Theresienstadt that came from my neighborhood in\nFriedberg. Her name was Ruth Wertheim. She married a Mitchell Bakehow, a lawyer in Detroit -\n- in Pontiac, Michigan. And we were lifelong friends. She saved my life on several occasions in\nAuschwitz by being like a mother, very protective.",
        "A: Yes, I was washing children\u2019s diapers in cold water. I remember it was fiercely cold that\nwinter, and my hands used to freeze, and I\u2019m surprised I don\u2019t have any frostbites or anything.\nThat was part of my job.",
        "A: We did it -- we -- I don\u2019t remember. No, we did that inside, but no heat. Cold water only.",
        "A: Yes, a -- as I said, the twins -- the Hashkowitz twins were on my ps -- on my bunk.",
        "A: We sort of maked go -- do. I don\u2019t remember that, but I know we suffered from the -- from\nlice, and from bedbugs. Bedbugs were s -- I was terribly allergic to bedbugs.",
        "A: Oh, my -- my body was full of pustules. They treated us with disinfectant, whatever they had,\nbut that was not enough, it was so endemic. And the lice, they were all over our head, and no\nwashing and cleaning could bring that out. So this was one bad thing.",
        "A: Yes, and right away after that really, the deportations from Theresienstadt started.",
        "A: It was in September, I think it was September 17\", and my mother said, \u201cIt must be Rosh\nHashanah,\u201d when our -- Rosh Hashanah just passed. I don\u2019t remember exactly what she said, and\nwe were together in wagons again, coal wagons, or whatever they were, and taken to Auschwitz.\nThat was a terrible trip. There was one pail where we could go and defecate and urinate, and at\nsome stations the SS came, and somebody had it to empty them. Then the trip went on, and it\ntook about two or three days to li -- to get to Auschwitz. Luckily, it was cool, and we didn\u2019t need\ntoo much water. But I remember that sitting 1n the -- 1n -- in the middle of the wagon, without\nany backrest, or so on, was very painful. My mother must have suffered tremendously, because\nwhen I think about my back now, and it\u2019s -- bother it gives me, I think back how these older\npeople suffered.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but as I said, my mother took some things along, probably, because\neverything was confiscated in Auschwitz then. But till we got to Auschwitz, we did have\nsomething. I don\u2019t remember what it was.",
        "A: T -- well, I wasn\u2019t scared, just ignorant, we all were ignorant. Maybe the older people knew,\nbut basically I wonder what other testimonials people give if they have -- young people, if they\nhave had 1 -- any idea what would happen.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. I could -- I could not believe. I absolutely was stunned.",
        "A: I never saw the crematorium, that was later on pointed out to me, after we were in -- in -- in\nour bunks already. But we were on this platform, and Mengele makes the selection, and my --\nmy mother, my brother were taken from me. I was taken t-to the other side, and luckily my\nfriend Ruth Wertheim was there, and we two held hands, and kept together, and were put into the\nsame barrack, slept on the same bed. There we met another girl. Her name was Hannah Laura\nBreaker. She immigrated to Israel a long, long time ago. And the second time I came to Israel,\nshe had passed away already. She was very much taken, and suffered greatly from her\nexperience. She took it in very, very much, and I think that led her to an early death. Also my\nfriend Ruth Hershkowitz Goodman, and her sister -- can\u2019t think of her name. I'll look it up after.\nThe twins. Not identical twins. She also was selected to our area, but sin-since they were twins,\nwere taken out to be with -- for experimentation. But somehow or other they had the luck that\nMengele left -- let them be for last, and used them as messengers. So that they were able to get a\nlittle bread here and there, and once when I met Ruth Hershkowitz on the way out of Auschwitz,\nshe gave me a half a loaf of bread, and she mentions it in her book.",
        "A: No, no, not at all, didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, who know -- knew anything. We knew our -- when we got to the labor camp, we knew\nthe German woman that was our -- a -- a real terrible bitch, if I can say that she was. Inhuman.\nInhuman and how would I say, a -- had no scruples whatsoever to hit us, or to kill us, or\nwhatever. She always wore a revolver in her polster, and was ready to shoot anybody.",
        "A: That wa -- I don\u2019t remember her name. I think her first name was Ilsa. I only remember when\nwe were liberated by the Russians, some of the Polish girls in the labor camp took her and\nshaved her hair, and gave her over to the Russians. I don\u2019t know what happened to her. I was too\nsick at that time.",
        "A: You know that since we went to -- still to German schools in the beginning, we took all these\nthings in, and when all the young people were selected for the youth -- the Hitler yugen, and for\nthe gymnast -- gymnastic classes and so on, no Jews were allowed to enter, nor half-Jews. And\nthat was really the only thing that bothered me. Everything else, we copied, sort of. When they\nsang German folk songs, and we went right along with it.",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t -- you know, they -- they said the Polacks, the Polish people, and the French\npeople, they are so dirty, they don\u2019t wash themselves, they had all kinds of preconceived notions,\nor -- that was drilled into the German youth. And we staying there, and being with them,\nbelieved the same things.",
        "A: And we felt very German. After all, my father was more German than the Germans, I would\nsay. He -- he belonged to the Reichpont yudizhafront soldaten. That means the ri -- the reich --\nthe club of the reich of the Jewish s -- soldier of the front.",
        "A: Oh yes, all the time.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And then, after awhile, they -- their -- their parents said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to this Jewish\ngirl any more. Don\u2019t -- don\u2019t play with her. Stay away.\u201d So we were really alone. We were sort\nof es -- ostracized then, really.",
        "A: No. But my husband told me he went, when he opened up the airport in Frankfurt, he went\nwith his father to hear him, and that gave him the first time an idea that this man 1s a dictator. My\nhusband was seven years older, and had much more knowledge, was very brilliant. And he told\nme this later, when we were married, naturally. He said that he could not understand it, that\nGerman people were so after him, spe -- especially some women that were enamored in him.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",

There was one girl missing, and we saw her at the\nbarbed wire, she had committed suicide. And there -- there was a big to-do in that camp, in our\nbarrack, what happened, there\u2019s one missing. And then finally somebody got up and said, \u201cShe is\nlying near the barbed wire.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, it was a shock, I saw it. I saw the woman. A very good looking, Czech, Jewish, a\nyounger woman, maybe in her early 20\u2019s.",
        "A: Yes, yes. We talked among ourselves that -- we stood outside for hours, and I didn\u2019t -- I was\ngiven one shirt, sort of, that went down to my knees. It was a little flannel inside, thank God. No\nsocks, no underwear, nothing. Somehow or other, later on somehow, I got a -- a rag somewheres,\nand I used that around my -- my sp -- private par -- parts to be like an underpair of -- under --\npair of pantyhose, or panties. I was always cold in Auschwitz, I cannot remember that I wasn\u2019t\ncold, and suddenly I noticed that I -- my breathing started to be short, and I realized I had fever,\nand was coughing. Those were the first signs of having TB. I didn\u2019t realize it, and my friend\nRuth said, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything, just stay and we\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d",
        "A: We all didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us, but we felt -- we -- we smelt a stench\nfrom the crematoria. By that time we knew that there was gassing going on. I mean, that was the\n-- the underground informed us. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t behave you\u2019re going to go there too,\u201d they\nsaid, \u201cso just do what they say.\u201d And since I was the smallest, or one of the smallest, I was\nalways hidden by taller girls, and good looking girls. And somehow I escaped, this way.",
        "A: It -- it helped me at that moment, yes.",
        "A: I -- I would have liked, I wasn\u2019t -- yes, I was trying to find out what happened to them, but we\nwere So occupied in our own psyche, that it was just self-determination to stay alive, that we\ndidn\u2019t think about anybody else.",
        "A: Oh, I must say, these -- we -- the three girls that we were -- Hannah Laura Breaker, Ruth\nWertheim and myself, we were like three sisters. We helped each other.",
        "A: Well, the -- the -- this comes later, when -- after we left Auschwitz, naturally we -- we\ncouldn\u2019t share foods, we each got our plate of soup, and a piece of bread, and everybody said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t hide your bread, it\u2019s going to be stolen, eat it as soon as you get it.\u201d And that was the\ntruth, because some of the girls, if they hid their bread for the night, or for whatever, they were\ngone. Some of the other mates were so hungry, and at that time you were doing anything you\ncould to get more food. Later on, when we were already deported to Mattsdorf and\nReasonkeperga, which happened at dusk, really, it was almost dark in October, very dreary day,\nand maybe Mengele didn\u2019t see how small I was, and said I was being selected to go out, because\nthere was nobody among those girls that was as small and perishable as I was. So emaciated, I\nwould say already, and coughing. And that\u2019s when I red -- I met Rose Hershkowitz with the half\na loaf of bread. And we went out of Auschwitz that night, and arrived in Mattsdorf, it\u2019s a\nkrumstin maidnon farflanna parachute factory. And right away we were put in our bunks, and\nassigned to work for the next day. I was put on the machine that was absolutely one of the worst.\nYou had to take raw flax, which came from the outside, the door was always open, and they\nthrew that flax in and I had to lift 1t up and put it into the machine, to take off the seeds on the\ntop. They had to be put in a certain way into the machine. [phone rings]",
        "A: We were -- first of all, I spent an awful lot of time on the latrines, I had terrible diarrhea, and I\ntook every minute I could to run to the latrine, which was not always allowed, and it had a\npermanent affect on my bowels, which I suffer today. We -- we were asked by different older\nsupervisors of our -- our kind in the barrack if we want to bring the soup up. It was a steep little\nhill, and I volunteered a couple of times, but I found it very, very hard to shlep maybe 20 liters or\nmore of soup in the barrel. And I remember that as the worst labor for me in Auschwitz. I -- we\ndidn\u2019t do anything, we just stood at the appelle morning and night, cleaned the barracks if\npossible, if they let us, and waited for our meal. We were just the reserve for going out, and not\nemployed in any way in Auschwitz itself.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: Sometimes one wished already that it\u2019s -- it might be, but the self-preservation within one was\nso strong that you wanted to survive under any circumstances.",
        "A: Is -- I thought of it till the end of the war, and that\u2019s why I went back to Friedberg. The\nRussian soldiers, and the Russian Jewish officer wanted me to go with him to Russia. I said,\n\u201cNo, I have to go west.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, when we wrote to Garovstein and we found out that this -- the day when they arrived in\nAuschwitz, that\u2019s their death day, that\u2019s the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mother, and my father also, before. I have all the -- the documents about this. The funny thing\nis, my poor husband never could find out where his mother was, and we have a letter that they\ndon\u2019t know where she passed away. We think -- or he thought that she died in Litzmannstadt, in\nLodz, in the ghetto.",
        "A: I think they have it. I\u2019m sure -- my husband did all of this, I am not aware of it.",
        "A: We were up -- we were rounded up, about 800 - 900 young girls, Hungarians, German Jews,\nPolish Jews. The German Jews were a minority -- I was among those, and Czech. Our Czech\nbrothers and si -- our Czech sisters that were -- came from Theresienstadt with us, we assembled\non the plaza, and then gi -- Mengele came and selected about four to 500 women. Among them\nwas me. I had held the hand of my friend Ruth Wertheim, who probably pulled me over, because\nI was so small, and sickly already. And he might not have seen it, 1t was dusk, and gray and\nevening, and we were put on the train, on the last wagon again, a closed train, and were taken to\nMattsdorf and Reasonkeperga. We arrived there the next day, and were unloaded, and the thing\nwas they didn\u2019t have enough room for us, so they quickly built Quonset huts on top of the\nfactory, and that\u2019s where we were located. That was a -- an plus for us, because the heat rises up\nfrom the machinery that went on 24 hours a day in the factory, and we felt the first time a little\nwarmth. And also, the factory had to get rid of dirty water that -- hot water that came out of the\nmachinery, since they were cooled by water, and we washed ourselves, and we kept ourselves\npretty clean during that time. But that was a time I got sick very fast, and a doctor came and put\nme in the infirmary. I was coughing, I had a mastitis which was draining. My I-le -- ma -- in ma -\n- on my ri-right breast for eight months, even after we were liberated yet. It gave me terrible\npain, and I had absolutely no incentive or will to live at that time any more. But my friend Ruth\nWertheim, and Hannah Laura Breaker, both kept me going. One day as we were standing there\nand talking in appelle, somehow or other, the foreman of the factory came by, and he said, \u201cHow\ncome you girls speak so well German?\u201d So we said, \u201cWe -- we are Germans. We went to\nGerman schools.\u201d He couldn\u2019t understand it. So next day he brought us an apple, and we divided\nthe apple in three. And that was the first time that a German showed some kind of compassion.",
        "A: No, he was a worker, a -- a -- the foreman. Not -- not an SS. If the f -- SS would have known,\nprobably he would have been fired, or whatever. But at that time, it was towards the end of the\nwar, and they were very much wrapped up with the Russian front that was very close to us. We\nheard the shooting all night long.",
        "A: It was very near Gross-Rosen, and right across from us was a labor camp of French prisoners\nof war. They actually wor-worked in our factory, too -- do -- to -- did some heavy man\u2019s labor.\nAnd some girls even sort of befriended them, or made some kind of contact with them.",
        "A: That, yes, that part was only for women, where -- where the flax was made into -- mixed with\na certain synthetic material for parachutes.",
        "A: Yes, I was -- as the raw flax, which -- which made sores on my hand because they are stalks,\nand you had to be fast putting it into the machine. My hands were always bloody, and injured\nfrom this job. And the seeds went into a bucket used for something else, and the stalks w-were\nput through other machines, and refined towards cha -- changing it into a material.",
        "A: It was very difficult labor. I was on one of the worst machines. My friend Ruth Wertheim was\nlucky, she was actually in a part of the sewing part, where they already mixed the nylon, or\nwhatever they had, some synthetic type of process, with the flax material. And it was easier. So,\nactually, I was on the worst end of the labor. That\u2019s why I got sick very fast. The -- the door was\nalways open for the flax to be thrown in, which was also done by girls, and some French\nprisoners brought the heavy bundles. And this went for eight -- almost eight months, from\nOctober to May, 1945. We almost worked towards the very, very end of April in -- fully on these\nmachines.",
        "A: Yes, we heard that they were coming nearer, nearer. The French soldiers warned us that they\nmight blow us up, so one morning all of a sudden, all the Germans were gone. They were -- the\nfactory was locked up, all Quonset huts were locked up, and everything. We thought they are\ngoing to blow us up, but nothing happened, nobody was around, nuth -- nobody came. That went\non for 24 hours, and we searched for food, and there was really nothing left. And then finally we\nsaw a Russian soldier come on the bicycle, and s-somebody yelled out of a window, or whatever,\nand he came and alerted the Russian army. And the first thing the girls did -- I was too sick,\nslaughter a cow, or Sa -- or a -- or something, or [indecipherable] just to get some f -- real good\nfood into us.",
        "A: Oh, there were farms nearby. It was a very beautiful area. Oh, besides our regular job, many\ntimes in middle of the night, some of us were taken, every time a different c-cloud to shovel coal,\nto di -- ti -- when the coal wagons were brought in, we had to empty them so they could be used\nright away. And I remember one night was terribly cold, snow on the ground, and we found\nsomething that looked so red, we took it, and was a liver from some kind of an animal, or\nwhatever. And we took it into the barracks, and my friend Ruth put it on some kind of a heating\nmechanism, maybe a radiator, or a machine that had heat, and sort of fried it a little, and the three\nof us divided it and ate it.",
        "A: That Hannah Laura Breaker, three of us.",
        "A: Yes, that -- that was in Auschwitz. There too, there wa -- there were two Polish girls, and they\nclaimed that they were lesbians. Polish Jewish girls that this German woman used them for\nsexual whatever, I don\u2019t know. And they were put in charge of us. And afterwards we really got\nafter the two.",

        "A: Yes, that was after awhile. A man came, a Dr. Hoffman, and apparently he was only a medic,\nhe was not a doctor, we found out after the war. We searched him. He actually helped a lot of the\ngirls. Few girls that -- that came with us to the labor camp were pregnant, and had babies there,\nand miscarriages. Maybe three or four, but I think two survived and took their babies. And --",
        "A: At the -- I don\u2019t know, it was so late in the year already. March, April, I mean how -- the g --\nthe Germans were afraid of everything already.

So they --",

        "A: No-o, I had -- that is the funniest thing, my friend Ruth Wertheim had it a few times, and she\nhad nothing to use, she used paper, or whatever she found, even flax. I had my menstrual period\nonce in Theresienstadt, and that was it. But one month after liberation, I had it again, and\nregularly till 1t stopped at age 52.",
        "A: I had none, none at all. I had -- I had maybe three, four menstruations before we were\ndeported, because I was about 14 and a half, or whatever.",

As a matter of fact, it took me many -- I would say a year or two to recover.\nAnd how I ever got to Friedberg -- I walked, with French prisoners of war, with Germans, on this\ngeneral exodus from the east towards Germany, and I had my yellow stripe on a jacket, and we\nlooted some things in German houses, so I had enough cl-clothes to wear. And I went e -- west.\nAnd it was a beautiful June, I remember. Oh, first there was one month -- I\u2019m sorry, I was taken\nto a -- to a German hospital that was taken over by the Russians, and I stayed there four weeks,\nand they sort of healed m -- healed me, they helped me to get much better and stronger.",

        "A: It had happened. But then I realized I was alone in this world, and luckily when I arrived at\nFriedberg, I got a ride with a -- an American, with two American soldiers as soon as I came to\nHolf and Saxon, they gave me a ride to Birkenback in Germany, and from there some trains were\nleaving, going towards Frankfurt, and I took a train to Hanau, which was very close to Friedberg,\nbecause the train from Frankfurt did not go to Friedberg yet. So from Hanau I took the train to --\nwhere I got the money from, I don\u2019t remember, but everything was on the -- on the road. I got to\nFriedberg, and I wa -- a-asked the stationmaster, \u201cDo you know if Mr. Mowra, Edgar Mowra is\nhere, and where does he live?\u201d And he said, \u201cHe just came back from Dachau.\u201d He was in\nDachau, and he told me where he was. And that\u2019s where I ended up, and stayed with him, his\nson, and the housekeeper till my papers came through. Actually not the whole time. He felt that I\nshould be taken care of with my tuberculosis, and took me to the hospital in Bad Nauheim. And a\nvery fine German radiologist said, \u201cWell, she has pretty bad tuberculosis on the left side of -- the\nleft lung. And we should give her pneumothorax.\u201d So I s --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",

This Dr. Hoffman, or medic\nHoffman that arrived there, who came from Bardkissingin, which we lateler -- we later found out\nhe was a medic with the German army corps. He made two incisions in my cyst, or whatever it\nwas in my right breast, and the pus finally came out, and he entered a canula and this drained for\neight months. But he did a pretty good job, and even though he was just a medic, not a medical\nphysician, it helped me to survive through the other months. However, I continued coughing,\nsuffered very much from shortness of breath, and know that I have had something -- I have\nsomething with my lungs. And when I finally arrived in Friedberg, and stayed at Edgar Mowra\u2019s,\nI was very grateful that he took me to the hospital in Bad Nauheim, which is known as one of the\ntop heart spas in the world, and had an excellent, at that time, staff in it\u2019s hospitals. A woman\nphysician, a radiologist, was very kind to me, and explained everything, and said, \u201cYou need a\npneumothorax for eight -- for as long as we can do it. We collapse your left lung so it can rest.\u201d\nAnd they pump air into the cavity, but very shortly already, water filled up -- fluid, after the\ncavity was empty, and that\u2019s the danger of this procedure.

        "A: No resentment. I still must say I don\u2019t want to sis -- resentment to c-come into my heart. I\nhave contact with some very fine Germans that could have been probably more helpful, but I\ndon\u2019t know if -- what we would have done in the circumstances. Their lives were put on the\nedge, too, when it came to help Jews.",
        "A: Well, today\u2019s world is so full of turmoil, and hate between various peoples. And I hope that\nIsrael and the Palestinians will come to some kind of accord, that would be a blessing for all the\nJews. But the Jews have to give also, they cannot just take all the time. And we must learn a\nlesson, that there are ways to find one\u2019s own salvation, and can still be active in the Jewish faith.\nI\u2019m reading a letter f -- about Judaism now, very -- pretty much at the end of my life, I want to\nreturn to my original upbringing, and so on. But I have reservations. When I think about all the\nceremonies that we have, and circumcisions, and these feasts. They are two, 3000 years old.\nThey don\u2019t have to be replicated in the way we are replicating them.",
        "A: Yes, I would say monotheism is not the answer, it\u2019s monism. One self above all. And\neverybody has some of that self, and maybe it\u2019s the same as God. And monotheism is not so far\naway from monism. I have learned a lot from Ratunda, I had a wonderful, wonderful teacher. A\nswami that was here for several years is teaching now in Chile. And what I learned through my\nhusband -- I myself would na -- would not have come to this, is -- is not to be -- it -- it\u2019s gold to\nme. It\u2019s more than gold, it\u2019s an inner richness that I received.",
        "A: No, definitely not. I -- I\u2019m a free thinker, and as I said, I had some -- I have some friends at\nthe Quakers, I have attended some of their sittings, just for meditation, and they are very good to\nme. I don\u2019t know if my family here in Scarsdale ap -- appreciates it. They are very much into the\nReform Judaism, which is very good. I go with them at the Jewish holidays for service there. But\nit\u2019s too much materialism amongst we Jews. And they have to do much more self searching, and\ngiving. With that I want to end.",
        "A: With that I want to end.",
        "A: And I still have anot --",
        "A: I would say a hundred percent healthy I did not f-feel ever. I ge -- always had a tiredness\nabout myself. Wasn\u2019t very able to do a lot of things, and very soon exhausted. But once I met my\nhusband, who was a mountain climber, a hiker -- I was also a hiker before that, I must say I have\nwalked, I love to walk. He changed my whole outlook, and introduced me to the eastern\nphilosophies, and I learned yoga, I taught it about eight years here in Greenburg, in the adult\neducation center, and also at the high school, at -- at the co -- co-op in the Bronx, Truman High\nSchool for adult education, and also for teenagers towards the end. And I also taught yoga here\nand there when I was asked by some organization, or make a demonstration. When the Madison\nSquare Garden was still in existence, I had a headstand on the stage of Madison Square Garden.\nNot alone, with two other students of the swami at that time.",
        "A: I-I think that is a question of development. I was very much impressed first with science. But\nscience also does not give all the answers. And I was in the medical field, in laboratories, doing\nresearch, especially in human blood, and sera, and so on, and so forth. And routine analysis of all\nfluids. My husband also was a chemist, and we discussed a lot of s-sciences, and so on and so\nforth. It left me with some questions and doubt, and it was sometimes quasi quasi, there were not\nhundred percent answers to anything. When my husband branched out into philosophy and\nreligion, I got a whiff of it, and he passed it on to me, and he would be proud today if he would\nbe alive to see me pursue it so vigorously.",
        "A: That humans can be very cruel to each other, and we talk about heart, and love, and so on and\nso forth, but the -- the principle of self preservation is so strong, that any human being resorts to\nany criminal action, even killing another human being, maybe a -- even a sibling for his self\npreservation. So this all has to be worked out by men. And I think I got wiser by having had this\nexperience, and I wonder what the other side will bring, if there is another side, and so more\nlearning, and more experiencing. We don\u2019t know. I have my doubts, like everybody else, and to\nerase doubt is the hardest thing of any journey, I think. If you don\u2019t have any more doubts, then\nyou are a saint.",
        "A: That was my husband\u2019s decision, more or less. And then I had this toxic pregnancy, or\nwhatever it was, it was never found out. But I had a very bad case of hepatitis, and was sick for\nseven weeks in Presbyterian Hospital in New York. So after that, my gynecologist, who was Dr.\nGisela Pearl said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want children, just don\u2019t have them.\u201d And the sex life was not the\nmost important thing for me. Maybe when I was younger, yes, but not at that time.",
        "A: No, it was not an act of precision, but my husband took precaution always.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t want. He had a strong feelings that the suffering on this planet is very --\nhe said planet earth is one of the most insignificant planets in this universe. And he learned that\nfrom Gerchiev, the Russian philosopher mystic. And he dabbled into that, and why perpetuate\nthis race, and we really don\u2019t know if we ever will know. The real, final answer 1s -- every\nscientist is groping for it, every f -- philosopher, and ever -- every religious thing are -- is grabbi\n-- grabbing with it, and have their opinions, and --\nEnd of Tape three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: No, I must say, very little. Very little. It sort of vanished. It\u2019s not preoccupying my mind.\nUnfortunately, my physical body gives me a lot of problems on. I dwell on that too much. If I\ncould get over that, and re-realize that a body 1s just the case of -- or the temple of our real\nexistence, if we -- if I could bring that to a real understanding, and strong idea, I would be better\noff. But I have only si -- grace, I think was given to me, to survive, and to -- to learn, and to\nreach this country, and learn, and I\u2019m still learning.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. It\u2019s too bad. But I must say occasionally now when I\u2019m -- I am alone, and I\nhave had periods of depression and anxiety, once or twice I have had bad dreams where I jumped\nout of bed, and the dream is just -- flies away, and I can\u2019t remember. But these are not very nice\nexperiences. I don\u2019t know if they have to do with the war, because I don\u2019t remember too much\nabout it.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think of them very much, unfortunately, I should. My brother\u2019s birthday is coming up,\nwould -- he would be now two years younger than I am. So I think about him because he was so\nyoung taken away, and he suffered so much more by having had typhus in Theresienstadt, and --\nand right away to the gas chambers, it\u2019s very, very sad. And I see him sometimes in the attic\nwhere we lived in Battenberg with me, and that night when Crystal Night took place. How we\ntwo huddled together. We were innocent, young. Didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "A: I was born on the fifth of February, 1928, by a midwife helping my mother, in Battenberg on\nthe Aida in Germany.",
        "A: No, I think I talked already too much. I gave a lot of myself, and my husband always warned\nme, he said, \u201cKeef -- kit -- keep it for yourself, keep it inside, it helps you to develop.\u201d So maybe\nI made a mistake to open myself.",
