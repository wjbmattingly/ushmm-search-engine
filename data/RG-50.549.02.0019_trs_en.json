        "Question: The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Mrs. Barbara Letterman Rodbell, conducted by Steve Roland on\nAugust fifth, 1998, in her home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. This 1s a follow up\n1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and\nToby Herr, for making this interview possible. This is the beginning of that tape number one\nand there we are.",
        "Answer: Okay.",
        "Q: And the answer to your question about why they want these?",
        "A: Epps. It\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: I -- I don\u2019t know exactly.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know. I -- I think that the idea is just to have -- I -- I don\u2019t know academically, or\nin the research community, as people are studying the Holocaust and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s effects. I -- I\nsuspect that there -- that there\u2019s some interest in trying to see what kind of effect the\nexperience had on people as a group. I know that Simone had a very interesting\nconversation with me yesterday. She explained to me that there have been some studies\ndone on the hidden children.",
        "A: Yes, there were, yeah.",
        "Q: And that the conclusion was essentially that those children fared just about as well as\neverybody else in the world, in terms of success or lack of success or divorce, or --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- continuing marriage. That there was not really any big difference. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t\nknow the answer to the question. I just got involved -- my -- my personal involvement was\nthat I\u2019ve been doing audio production and interviews, for many years. And went to the\nHolocaust Museum about five years ago and was really devastated by the experience. And\ncalled them and started to beg them to allow me to contribute some small way, what could I\ndo? And they put me on this list of -- of interviewers and said, \u201cWell, maybe you can help\nus with these.\u201d And then they just said, \u201cWell, look, this is what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re doing\nthis project of follow up interviews and trying to talk to people about their -- their\nexperiences.",
        "A: Yeah, this -- the hidden child thing 1s -- 1s very good. You know we -- I don\u2019t know if\nSimone mentioned to you -- what is her name now? I\u2019m drawing a blank. Last name is Fink.\nShe -- she was a hidden child, in Holland, she was four or five when her mother --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: She -- there\u2019s definitely -- in her story, you can definitely see that her life was influenced\nby the situation -- by her past, yeah. I have always thought that my life -- it might have been\ndifferent, because I would have never left Germany, you know. I was born in Berlin and I\nwould have lived in Berlin and probably married in Germany or whatever. And I would\nhave never had this broad experience of life, which I ended up having. Because Germany\nwas very narrow. They were very focused upon themselves, they were the greatest, the best,\nthe this and the that. And you would have never had this wide experience. But I would have\nhad a very interesting life, wa -- you know, one way or the other. I don\u2019t know if it would\nhave -- from that point, if you had -- it made a difference, in the sense that I was kicked out -\n- you know, that I had to leave, that I had to live a broader life than I would have otherwise.\nBut as far as the history of humanity goes, that you have children -- that you marry and you\nhave chi -- you grow up, marry and have children, I don\u2019t think that would have been very\ndifferent. Would have been in a different country, but it wouldn\u2019t have been very different. I\ndo think that my outlook ended up much broader than it would have been if I\u2019d never left\nGermany, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you explain that?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I said, that because you -- I had to leave Europe. I didn\u2019t really\nhave to leave Europe, but because I left Europe and I s -- I looked at Europe from the\noutside. And I still f -- when I\u2019m in Europe now, I still feel very European, very European. I\n-- | don\u2019t feel like an American in Europe. I -- I feel European. But when I\u2019m here, I also do\nnot feel a stranger at all, here. And if you want to go a little chronologically, you know, I\nnever really did feel very strange here, you know. It was when I first came over, I felt\nextremely lonely, of course. I was terribly lonely.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you tell me the circumstances of your coming? Wh-Why did you come here?",
        "A: Well, after the war -- you know, I was a dancer in Amsterdam. I lived in Amsterdam,\nfirst of all, not in Germany.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I was there all during the war. I was with a group of young people, we wer -- we\nsurvived the war intact. Not one of us got taken and it was due to the leader of the pack.\nThat was Manfred Greenback, who 1s still alive and who 1s still in Amsterdam and -- and\nwho is actually getting a pension from the Dutch government for the work he and his sister,\nboth -- she also s -- also has a kind of a small pension from the Dutch government, for the\nwork that they did during the war. But, as a -- I was in that group with hi -- with them.",
        "Q: But this was a -- this was illegal work that he did at the time, right?",
        "A: This was -- during the war, it was underground work.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In the underground. But he definitely -- he and his sister both, definitely saved us. With\nthe -- through their organization, their ability to get the various papers that you needed to\nsurvive and to get food stamps and -- and their connections with other groups. And it was\nlike a large spider web of -- of underground activity. They were all connected, one way or\nthe other, even though their beliefs might have been and their reasons for doing the work\nmight have been very different from each other. During the war, they all worked together.\nAnd anyway, I sa -- we survived the war and after the war, I was in the ballet with Sonia\nGasco. It is a -- the ballet that -- that later became Niederlancer Balletta, the big Dutch ballet\nin -- in the Stutz-Hober, the big theater in -- in amst -- the state ballet. It was then called the\nBallet 1945, when -- when I was in it. That was the beginning. And Madame Gasco, who --\nwho started it, started organizing this last month before the war was ended. We -- we\nalready knew, you know, that the war was going to end and we started practicing and -- and\n-- and rehearsing and doing all these things. And we were ready -- not quite -- by the time\nthe war was -- was actually ended. And I -- I worked with her and I danced with the ballet\nand I had various other jobs. I also did photography. I studied photography with a friend of\nmy mother\u2019s, who had also survived the war and had actually sort of held her hand over my\nhead, even though I didn\u2019t even know it. But she had sort of protected me from various\nthings that went on during the war. So it\u2019s all very complicated, but -- but it -- that\u2019s how it\nwas.",
        "Q: Ca-Can you give me an example?",
        "A: Well, during the war, I was -- I was dancing. I -- I -- I think I tell all that on the -- on the\nother tape.",
        "Q: You tell -- oh, yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t really want to --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- go over it all again.",
        "Q: No, I just meant about the way this woman was -- was protecting you.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s right, she was protecting me in the sense that they decided that some of the\nthings I was during -- doing during the war, was endangering myself.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And she saw to it that I had to stop doing them. She never talked to me, but she talked to\nthe people who I\u2019m do -- I was doing it with and they managed to -- without letting me\nknow why -- to dissuade me from continuing what I was doing. And so in that sense, I\ndidn\u2019t know til after the war that it was her -- she who had done this. It was very interesting.\nSo, as I was saying, it was a spider web and -- and it was extended to me, I was part of it\nand they took care of me. So, even though I didn\u2019t know it. But anyway -- so, after the war,\nI was dancing with ga -- Sonia Gasco and friends of my parents started writing letters to our\nold address and -- and saying, \u201cWell, what happened to your family? What happened?\u201d You\nknow, and these were people all over the world. I mean Australia and South America and\nAmerica -- you know, was North America. Canada, every -- letters came from all over the\nworld. And I went back to our old apartment, which was the place they all wrote to. And I\ntold the lady where I was and she -- she forwarded all the mail. When I saw them all -- all\nthese letters, I ch -- answered only the ones that I could remember, because many of these\npeop -- they were all friends of my parents, not of mine. And some of them I didn\u2019t\nremember and some of them I did. And the one I remembered best, was Dr. Kalinoffsky\u2019s\nfamily, because in Berlin we used to have gymnastics with their two daughters, they had\ntwo daughters, Hilda and Lothar Kalinoffsky. And we had gymnastics with them in Berlin\nand when we came to Holland, they had gone -- he was a psychiatrist in Berlin and they had\ngone to Rome. And he had to study again, he got a degree in Rome. And he was a\npsychiatrist in Rome. And then, when a -- when he felt like things weren\u2019t going so well in\nItaly, he decided to go to the United States. He went to the United States with his family and\nhe had to do a third degree -- the third -- you know, he got -- he got his doctorate in\npsychiatry in New York. And that\u2019s where he was, in New York. So when I got their letter, I\nwrote. And it turned out that he had been asked to help establish the Department of\nPsychiatry at the free University of Berlin. I think it\u2019s in Dallem. It\u2019s in Dallem or wherever\nit is. It\u2019s in -- near Berlin -- in Berlin. And so h-he decided he was going to go via\nAmsterdam and -- to Berlin, from -- from the in -- from New York. So he came by and he\nsaid, \u201cCome to the United States. Come -- we take care of it, come.\u2019 You know? Well, I was\ndoing very well at that time and I kept saying, \u201cNo, I -- I can\u2019t make up my mind.\u201d He kept\nsaying, \u201cLook, your parents aren\u2019t going to come back and --\u201d as I\u2019m telling on the other\ntape, I kept thinking, \u201cYes, maybe they will come back, and my sister. Somebody will show\nup, you know, they will be all r -- somebody will come, I can\u2019t come right away.\u201d So I\npostponed and postponed. Finally, in 1947, he ca -- I mean, he kept coming, every three,\nfour months, when he had to go to Berlin, and say, \u201cCome, come, come.\u201d And he sent me an\naffidavit. And I got a call from the American embassy in Rotterdam and they were saying,\n\u201cWell, do you want to come, or don\u2019t you want to come? You got plenty of people who\nwant to come, I mean, what\u2019s going on there?\u201d And so I took a deep breath and I went. It\nwas terribly hard. I mean, I had a boyfriend and I had -- you know, I was -- I was in the\nballet, I was doing well and I was getting up there and it was just terribly hard to leave. But\non the other hand, I really -- I didn\u2019t see a real future and I -- I thought, well, you know, my\nparents were killed, my sister was gone, my grandmother was gone, my -- I had family. I\nhad a lot of family still, my mother\u2019s family there. And even a cousin of my father\u2019s, Heinz\nKemfer was still there and -- in Holland. And -- but it wasn\u2019t really my own, you know? It\nwasn\u2019t close enough and -- so many changes had taken place, and I should make a change.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t have to be forever, I kept taying -- saying to myself. You know, I mean, after\nall, I could come back and you know, if I -- if I really didn\u2019t like it, you know, I could come\nback and --",
        "Q: And what was your immediate plan? What would you be going when you got here?",
        "A: Well, that -- tha -- I didn\u2019t even think about that because he\u2019s -- well, I thought I was\ngoing to dance, actually. Yes, I thought I was going to dance. Well, it turned out that they\nlived on Long Island. And I -- I\u2019m having trouble remembering the town. I know that the\nsecond house that they had was -- oh yeah, I know, it was Babylon, I think. I think it was\nBabylon, but I\u2019m not sure. The second place they lived was Brightwaters. They moved\npretty soon after I had came, they had -- they moved to Brightwaters and that\u2019s -- you know,\nit is a ways from New York. It -- you have to take the Long Island railroad. And as I found\nout pretty soon, you know, it was difficult. I had to be in New York for the dance -- for my\nclasses at the American School of Ballet and it was hard to get to and fro -- get the timing\nright. I could never date, because I -- the train came -- you know, the train -- I had to take a\ncertain train back. And it was just too complicated t-to -- to live out on the island if you\nwanted to be in New York, which I did. And so I met a girl, Ellen Crooks, I met her in -- at\nthe balle -- in the ballet class, at the American School of Ballet. And she was born and\nraised in Greenwich Village and her mother had a spare apartment. And so she and I moved\nin together to -- in Greenwich Village. And it was wonderful to have her, because I mean,\nshe was -- she knew every little corner of -- of Greenwich Village, having been raised there.\nAnd she was very nice girl -- very good girl and -- and we -- we had -- we lived together.\nWe finally took another -- a girl -- a woman -- a girl, I guess we were then. And we lived\nthere together and where we lived was on Third Street, where now is the library of New\nYork University, the law library of the uni -- and at the time, they were already trying to\nempty the buildings, you know, so there were quite a lot of empty apartments, people whose\nlease had run out and they weren\u2019t replacing these people, because they wanted to empty the\nbuildings, but they had to go to the end of people\u2019s contract. And -- and her mother\u2019s\ncontract was very long. So we were just -- there were a few people left in the building, so it\nwas -- got quite creepy, because there were many, you know, people kem -- kept sleeping\nup on the stairs, you know, bums and -- and hobos and whatever you have there. And it was\nquite an exciting time in Greenwich Village. It was still a little bit of the old Greenwich\nVillage, you know, that you -- that you hear about. Many Italians -- downstairs was a li -- a\nsmall Italian restaurant, that was where our telephone was. He -- he would keep message\nand get messages for us and we could, you know, go and get the messages and we could\nmake calls there. And many, many a time. So -- but it was very nice. I mean, it was exciting,\nscary and nice. I had to learn how to ride those subways. I mean, I came out of Amsterdam,\nafter the war and it was -- I mean, when I got here with the clothes that I thought were very\nfancy -- I had taken my mother\u2019s -- I had some of my mother\u2019s clothes in Holland and I had\nthem remade for the United States. Well I got to the United States and I looked like a spook,\ncompared to the other people in the United States. It was -- there was something going on\ncalled the new look. Remember, they wore these -- these very -- these skirts with many\nruffles, sort of wide with -- with underskirts underneath, sticking out a little bit on the -- on\nthe borders and I mean I looked absolutely -- what I thought was high elegance, I looked\nweird, highly weird. So the first day that we were there, Mrs. Kalinoffsky took me into New\nYork, went to Macy\u2019s and she got me outfitted. I got a new coat -- Pll never forget the coat.\nThese kind of things, you remember.",
        "Q: Where did you get money to pay for these things?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Where did you get money\u201d?",
        "A: She -- she -- she did it, she bought it for me.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: [had a little money. My father had given my Uncle Bep Person who also lived in New\nYork, who was an announcer with CBS. Especially during the war, we kept hearing him,\nbecause he did the Dutch, the Belgian and I think one of the Nor-Nordic countries. H-He did\nthe news for -- for those countries. So I kept hearing my Uncle Bep Person all the time. He\nworked, as I said, for CBS, for their foreign department, during the war. And after the war,\nhe worked for the United Nations. That\u2019s really what he did, til he died. He worked at -- you\nknow, he was a journalist at the United Nations. He wrote all the news from the United\nNations and he -- he had been an editor of the Haffsupost in the -- in -- in the Hague and he\nhad worked -- always been a journalist, so -- anyway, he -- in 1939, he took his family to the\nUnited States. He -- he had said to the Haffsupost, he says, \u201cI think it\u2019s time that you have in\ninternational correspondent.\u201d And they said, \u201cYes, you know, we -- we like to b-broaden\nou-our news and ti -- cli -- go.\u201d So he had job here, in New York. He was in New York\nwith his family. Actually, he lived in Great Neck, they lived in Great Neck, Long Island, but\nhe worked in New York. And my father had given him a Shell stock to take. And after the\nwar, Uncle Bep wrote me that he had that for me. And, so when I came, I had a little money.\nIt wasn\u2019t tremendous amount, but it was enough, because I went to work, you know. So\nanyway, the Kalinoffsky\u2019s, they would have helped me a lot more, if I\u2019d asked for it. You\nknow, I didn\u2019t want to ask for it.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] can you -- can you -- I -- I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m a little unclear. What was your\nrelationship with them?",
        "A: Well, they were friends of my parents.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And they -- he decided to -- they were really good friends of my parents and -- and they\nbrought me over. They were the ones that gave me the affidavit and they had two daughters,\nyou know, that were my -- who were my age and I never reme -- and I never forget opening\nup their closet when I first came to their house. In -- then Babylon, I guess. There were all\nthese clothes hanging, these gorgeous clothes and -- hanging in the girl\u2019s closets. And I\ncould not imagine how anybody could have so much clothes. I mean, now I -- you know, I\nthink it\u2019s all normal and every -- but then, I mean, we had nothing, absolutely nothing, you\nknow, during all those years of s -- of underground, the underground. I had a skirt and a\nsweater and a blouse. You know, and here, closets full, all matched things, you know, the\nsweater sets and the -- the skirts that went like the triangles and -- and gorgeous things. So,\nwhere was I?",
        "Q: Tell -- I wanted to ask you what -- you know, it\u2019s hard for me to imagine somebody\nhaving gone through the experiences which you did in the underground and then coming\nand saying that you were intimidated by being in New York, or that you were scared.",
        "A: Well, I was not inti -- you see, that was actually one of the funny -- the strange things. I\narrived -- I came on the Queen Mary and I -- I -- sh -- Mrs. Kalinoffsky picked me up and\nshe drove me through New York to get to the Long Island thruway, what -- whatever it\u2019s\ncalled [indecipherable]. And she kept saying, \u201cI'll take you to Broadway the next one --\nnext day, you know, when we go shopping. We\u2019ll go to Macy\u2019s and then we\u2019ll go shopping,\nyou know, and Pll show you New Yo --\u201d I went and I saw New York and I wasn\u2019t\nimpressed. She was very sad. And now I know, you know, that -- there are many people\nwho come from Europe and I take them around. Th-Things change. And they are often not\nimpressed. Now, why is that, ac -- I explain it to her, that I had seen so many films -- I had\nseen so many films of New York, of Broadway and of -- you know, the -- the -- at the time,\nthe man was blowing smoke rings, or the woman, whatever it was. And I mean, it was pretty\nwonderful, but at the time, I -- I wasn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t impressed. I had a very hard time leaving\n-- leaving Europe and what happened was that I flew from Amsterdam -- from\n[indecipherable] to London and it -- it -- this is very normal now, but there weren\u2019t that\nmany planes in 1947. I -- I left in November of 1947. And friends of my parents again,\n[indecipherable] picked me up and I was going to have a week or so in London with them,\nbut what happened 1s that I got a kind of a nervous breakdown. I was shaking and crying. I\ncouldn\u2019t control anything I was doing. I was so upset. I -- it turned out I -- I had left very\nbravely, you know, taken to the airport by my boyfriend and my best girlfriend together,\nthey were -- and I got on the plane very bravely, I walked over there. I had a bunch of tulips\nfor -- for the Ronas with me. And I remember handing it over to them and then breaking\ndown right there at the airport. And I cried for four solid days. I just couldn\u2019t -- and finally\nthe doctor -- I guess I got some Valium or something to calm me down and that was --\nfriend of my Uncle Heinz was there -- actually the brother of Ava Kempfer, his wife -- my\ncousin\u2019s wife, was there and he wanted to take me out, you know. And he took me out and I\n-- he said, \u201cMa -- Your eyes -- what -- something wrong with your eyes?\u201d They were so red\n-- rot -- red and swollen and he took me out and the funny thing, he took me to his club.\nAnd w-we went to his club and they fed me something. I -- I will -- I think 1t was -- I had\nscrambled eggs with ham or some sort of thing and there was something wrong with the\nham and I ended up sick in London from -- from eating that -- that ham and this cousin, he -\n- he had been just wonderful to me. He had saved his clothing coupons, there -- in England,\nand also in Holland, we still, in \u201847, had clothing coupons. And he had saved his clothing\npoop -- coupons and he went to a store with me and he let me choose a blouse or whatever I\nwanted -- it was a blouse -- from his coupons. It was the sweetest thing, and --",
        "Q: This was your cousin Heinz?",
        "A: This wa -- no, this was actually the brother-in-law of my cousin Heinz.",
        "Q: Okay. And what was his name?",
        "A: His name was Gunther Ver-Vernon. Their real name -- you talk about real name, their\nreal name was Vershenski and his -- his -- they changed their name to Vernon. Anyway,\nGunther Vernon, he saved his coupons -- his clothing coupons for me and bought me a\nblouse. But, the poor guy, he fed me something -- he didn\u2019t, I mean the -- the restaurant\nthere in his club. So, I was sick from that and I was sick of heart, of leaving Europe. I was\nscared to death, you know, really to be on my own in a huge country. I mean, to come from\nHolland, which 1s the first thing the Dutch always say to you, \u201cHow do you like Holland,\nisn\u2019t it small?\u201d You know, this is -- it\u2019s one sentence that they\u2019re saying. Of course now,\nyou know, it\u2019s going to be Europe and it\u2019s going to be bigger, but --",
        "Q: Well, be -- k -- k -- k -- can you explain something to me, just so I\u2019m clear about it,\nbecause I -- I\u2019m not -- what I\u2019m not clear about is, what was the impetus to leave and to\ncome to the United States, other than it\u2019s sort of the general dream, of going to the Uni-\nUnited States?",
        "A: Well, I was at a point, you know, where I had to make up my mind what in the world\nwas going to happen to me. I had a relationship, which really --",
        "Q: This was with Otmar?",
        "A: With Otmar.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And -- and I just thought I\u2019m getting on in age and I want children and -- you might have\nheard, you know, Otmar did not want children.",
        "Q: Yeah, I thought that was a very important [indecipherable]",
        "A: It was a very important point and I said, \u201cOh, my goodness, you know, I\u2019m getting to be\n22.\u201d In those day, people married pretty early. Not as early in Europe as they married in the\nUnited States, but they did marry pretty early. And I was getting to be 22 and he didn\u2019t want\nchildren. And I was crazy about him. But -- and I think that\u2019s why I had the nervous\nbreakdown, because I just -- I didn\u2019t want to leave him, but I knew I had to leave him. I\nmean -- and that\u2019s how I am. If -- I mean even -- even if it breaks my heart, if I know I have\nto do something, I\u2019m my own protector. I have to take of -- care of myself and that is what I\nhave to do. And so I decided this was a point where I had to leave. Another thing was that\nthe Dutch had not given me citizenship. Now, you have to understand that my mother really\nwas Dutch. She was Dutch, she was born Dutch. My grandfather was Dutch. My\ngrandmother wasn\u2019t, but my grandfather was Dutch.",
        "Q: You mother\u2019s mother?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s mother.",
        "Q: I mean, your mother\u2019s father.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s father, yes. Hendrick -- Hendrick Zeetroon. But he lived in Berlin and he\nhad married a German wife, Ellen Fillipi.

I always\nknew that we were the best. I mean, we were -- you know, and -- and we were just right,\nyou know, my father was -- was an intellectual, he played the violin, he -- my mother played\nthe piano, we always had music. We had wonderful friends, I adored my parents friends.\nThey were all fantastic, you know. That is -- I used to sit around, listen to them talk and they\nwere wonderful, witty, well-based, intellectual kind of talks. And I adored it. I -- I just -- I\nwould sit there and listen and listen. And I -- I would read the books they gave me and the\nbooks that I found and I\u2019ve always liked that. I\u2019ve never been a scholarly person. I\u2019ve never\nbeen as somebody who -- I -- although I like school, you know, history and things like that,\nbut I\u2019ve never been a s -- a real scholarly person. I\u2019m more toward the arts and toward the\ntouchy-feely kind of things and -- but I love to listen and I -- I enjoy that kind of\natmosphere. And amazingly enough, when I came to the States, the Kalinoffsky\u2019s, as\nwonderful as they were, you know, they didn\u2019t have it. There wasn\u2019t a painting in the house.\nI gave a painting to Mrs. Kalinoffsky for Christmas. A painting that was made by somebody\nin Greenwich Village, whom I liked very much, a -- a German girl who was there. She\nnever hung it up. I looked at -- I looked at it. I couldn\u2019t frame it, you know, I couldn\u2019t afford\nto frame it, because I had to pay her -- my goodness, I think it was 50 dollars. And 50\ndollars -- for me to make 50 dollars, I think that\u2019s what I made a week, you know? So I\nsaved the money for -- for this painting and I bought the painting and I gave it to her.

        "A: I remember Christmas at home in Berlin. I do remember some Hanukkahs in -- in\nAmsterdam, but that was, you know, a-after the emergency, you know? It was because we\nwere thrown into this peculiar situation of being not really at home. You know, I mean, we -\n- we were just -- we had moved to Holland and things were different in Holland, you know\nand we were sort of thrown in a society of people like us.

        "Q: When -- when was that?",
        "A: -- that -- well, it was just this year, in the spring I guess it was. Oh, it was very -- still\nvery cold, so it must be early s -- early spring. I found out that the neighborhood where we\nlived in was brand new when we came. I -- I had no idea about that, you know, I ha -- I -- I\nsaw it as a child. You moved in somewhere [indecipherable], but now I know that it was a\nnew neighborhood at the time, just been built and that\u2019s why there were so many people like\nus. You know, German Jewish refugees, actually, who lived in that neighborhood. But it\nmade it a very -- it wasn\u2019t strictly like that, but a lot. And so that\u2019s why the Franks were\nthere. And -- and the family of the woman he finally married and -- and -- and you know, I\nmean, just name it. Maria Austria was there, who became my foot -- photography teacher\nafter the war and who also took many of the very beautiful pictures of our family at the\ntime. And I worked as a model for her and for her sister, who had been a buwhouse weaver.\nAnd I wore the sweaters and things she designed and Maria photographed them and it got\ninto the various magazines in Holland. LeBella and some of the other ones. And, so that\nneighborhood was very cozy in -- in that way, because -- and you didn\u2019t feel like a stranger,\nbecause everybody -- not everybody, but quite a few people were like that. I never felt -- I\ncannot remember, I should say, maybe there were moments, but I cannot remember feeling\nlike a stranger.",
        "Q: In Amsterdam?",
        "A: In Amsterdam. Or an -- or an outsider. I might have been, because now people say that\nthe Dutch really weren\u2019t very nice to the foreigners, they resented them and this and that.\nBut I -- I personally can\u2019t remember it. Now I was just a dumb child and I was busy with\nmyself and probably didn\u2019t pay attention. But I never felt like an outsider.",
        "Q: Now when -- when you rephr -- I know you say you didn\u2019t feel like an outsider, but --\nbut are you s -- the -- as an outsider as someone from Berlin, or someone who is Jewish?",
        "A: Now, this is a very interesting question. I never thought about Jewish. And, to tell you\nthe truth, I -- I have never thought -- unless people ask me and I\u2019m sort of -- stand back and\nlook at it, you know. I really never thought about Jewish. In Holland, I never realized\nanything. People are not -- were not very religious in Holland. They are not very religious in\nHolland. I remember in Sweden, which isn\u2019t quite the same, but still, people were telling me\nth-they were saying, \u201cWell you know, we were really heathens. We\u2019re really heathens,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cWe\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re baptized and we die in the church.\u201d I mean, for the rest -- you\nknow the church. And in Sweden they actually tax everybody a dollar or [indecipherable] a\ncertain percentage, so that the churches can be kept, because otherwise nobody would take\ncare of them, you know? And it -- it -- in Holland, it\u2019s not quite like that, but it is like it,\nquite a bit. You know, religion really didn\u2019t mean much to me, I mean it\u2019s -- it -- it never\nhas.",
        "Q: Well, tell -- can you tell me a little bit about your -- a-about the atmosphere. Y-You\nstarted to describe the atmosphere in your -- in your home when you were little.",

        "A: Eight -- I was seven. I had my eighth birthday in Amsterdam.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, either one, whatever you can recall. What I\u2019m interested in is that -- the --\nsort of the -- what -- what your family was like.",
        "A: Okay.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know anything about the code of ethics. I don\u2019t even know what it means.",
        "Q: Well, [indecipherable] that\u2019s a weird phrase.",
        "A: I mean, my father was a lawyer.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And he never did anything that was not right. That\u2019s kil -- that\u2019s what killed him. I mean,\nhe could not go outside of what was at the moment, the law. He could not see past that, you\nknow? I mean -- and what saved me was that at the time this all happened, I was 16 years\nold. I mean -- I mean in Holland and I was just starting to develop my own little group of\npeople, my -- young people. And they were different. I met Manfred and that was my luck,\ndumb luck. And he was politically interested. Now, he was 19 or 20 when I met him and he\nwas political, but I didn\u2019t know anything about political. One thing I didn\u2019t know anything\nabout was political. I knew we moved to Holland because of Hitler, but otherwise, it was\njust a move for me. And it was a struggle, that first year, to go from German to -- to Dutch\nin school. I was very b -- I mean, I had been excellent at school in Germany.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Which was in the same street, actually, or the street next to ours, that I could walk there,\nyou know, to the school. And I came and -- by the way, and this -- this would interest you.\nOne day -- now, I\u2019m talking about Germany now. This was in the second grade. We got to\ntake home a little letter, which said, \u201cFrom now on, Barbara should be in school at 10:30 on\n-- on Tuesdays, because the other children will have religious instruction, which was\nLutheran. And in case -- you know, she doesn\u2019t have to come til 10:30, that\u2019s when school\nstarts. Well, I cried and cried. My father had to sign this little note, that he had gotten the\nmessage and he s -- I -- I said, \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I go there?\u201d And he says, \u201cI don\u2019t know why\nyou shouldn\u2019t go there. You want to go there, you go there.\u201d So he wrote to the teacher,\n\u201cBarbara would like to attend.\u201d Come at nine o\u2019clock, attend to school. So I had religious\ninstruction, Lutheran -- the Lutheran religion. And I loved it. I was one of the best ones\ntelling these stories, my goodness. Bread into wine -- I mean br -- you know, I mean bread -\n- | mean how he fed all the hundreds and I mean, it was just fabulous. I d -- I was a good\nstoryteller and I got my -- the highest grade. I did very well. So, coming to Holland was\nhard for me, because I had to start all over, making my place in the class and -- and trying to\n-- and who was in my class but Margot Frank. And that\u2019s why we got to be so friendly,\nbecause we started the same year, the same day, the same everything, you know. And we\nlived in the same neighborhood, so we walked home together. And that\u2019s how the families\nmet each other.",
        "Q: So, but what -- so what was your ed -- what was your parent\u2019s religiousness like?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Did they go -- did they go to synagogue on a regular basis?",
        "A: No.",

        "Q: But your father had been Bar Mitzvahed?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t even know that. I presume he was, because my grandfather was -- I\nthink he was religious. My grandfather -- on both sides, my grandfathers, were religious.\nMy mother\u2019s grandfather, I remember him putting on the Tefillen and davnen in the\nmorning. But for the rest, you never heard anything about Jewish. You know, I mean, he --\nhe did that. I think they like, lit the candles on s -- on s -- Friday evening. I think they did.\nI\u2019m pretty sure they did. I think they had Hanukkah and not Christmas, but we had\nChristmas.",
        "Q: Your parents?",
        "A: At home?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We -- I remember we had a big hall and I remember this gorgeous Christmas tree.

I remember the plates, with the nuts and the marzipan and the -- and the\napples, the red, red apples and the -- you know, what you get at Christmas. And we had a lot\nof maids and people, you know, and they were Christians and they were mostly Catholics,\nactually. And they -- and I remember also, that they all got presents, we got presents. I\nremember my father saying that -- not to forget to give him money in an envelope, because\nwhen he get -- went to court, there were all the people, you know, at the door of the court\nand the people who worked for him in the office and he was giving presents out, Christmas.\nAnd we had -- definitely had -- I remember that wonderful smell of the pine an-and I\u2019m\nprobably romanticizing it, but I can see it, how it was.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s a --",
        "A: Memories will make things prettier than they probably were. But it was very pretty, and -",
        "Q: Well, those are powerful memories for children.",
        "A: And you know, it was also that ma -- where my parents went skiing, or they went on\ntrips, I had a Catholic maid, she was a Red Cross nurse. Sh-She wasn\u2019t a maid, she was a\nnurse. And she took me with her, to her parents. So, that was in Bavaria and it was\ncompletely, you know, Christian and I have still pictures of that and everything. And I\nwould go -- later, when I had a governess and my sister had the -- the -- her -- Maria, my\nnurse, I resented my sister because of that, she got my Maria. And I got a -- an governess.\nThat governess went to -- she was also Catholic and I remember her -- going to church with\nher, because on Sundays, when my parents weren\u2019t there and she wanted to go to church,\nshe couldn\u2019t leave me home. So I would -- I would go to church with her. And I -- I\nremember my parents coming home one night and my mother was giving me a hug and\nthere was something crackling on my chest and she looked under the blanket and there was\none of these holy cards, you know, the saint cards.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know what that is.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, it was like that, little bit longer, a little narrower and it had the picture of the saint\nand then it had some of his sayings or poe-poem about him. And what it was supposed to\ndo, was protect me during the night, from anything bad that could happen to me. I mean,\nthat was what -- what they did -- what -- what she did. She meant nothing but good with it.\nAnd my mother was very upset. I remember her being upset.",
        "Q: Because\u201d?",
        "A: Well, I presume -- I presume that she said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s all right to take her to -- to church\nwith you, but, I mean, how far can you go? You know, after all, you know, that\u2019s not her\nreligion.\u201d",
        "Q: Now I want -- I just want to do something here, I want to -- I want you to just go over the\nnames of the people in your families, to make sure that we have them. Or -- or who you can\nremember, but your grandfathers, what did your grandfathers do? What was their\nprofessions?",
        "A: My grandfather -- my mother\u2019s father --",
        "Q: Right, was his name [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay, that was just a Dutchman -- he was the Dutchman.",
        "Q: And his name?",
        "A: And his name was Hendrick Ruloff Zeetroon.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And my grandmother\u2019s name was Ellen Filipi [indecipherable] Zeetroon. And my\nfather\u2019s -- oh, he was a furrier. He had a furrier business and that\u2019s a wonderful story,\nbecause -- I don\u2019t know if I told that, probably on the tape also --",
        "Q: I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: Well, he -- he was, of course, born in Amsterdam and he was born at number one\nCulverstrat, which is right across from the palace. It\u2019s a little narrow street, which is now\nnothing but a big junk heap. I mean it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t give you an example of a street\nthat\u2019s like that. One store next to the other and not very classy. But they still owned the\nhouse. The family -- Cargill Zeetroon owns that house and -- and a jewelry store that they\nall came out of that jewelry store. My great-grandfather Ruda -- Ruloff owned a jewelry\nstore, which he, I think had already inherited from his grandfather at number one\nCulverstrat. And that house still is owned by the Zeetroons. It now 1s called Shrapzeetune or\nFundumzeetune or something like that, the store itself, but my cousin Carroll has the upper -\n- is only on the upper -- has an office now only, on the upper floor. He only does antique --\nantique jewelry now. But there were 15 children or 16 children and it was sort of half and\nhalf -- half girls, half boys. And there was, of course, no possibility of all the boys inheriting\nthis business. So --",
        "Q: Because\u201d?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s never done. The oldest inherits it and the rest has to, you know. The girls get\nsome help, you know, they get dowries and st -- they got dowries and stuff. But the boys\nwere on their own and it was typical of the times that boys were walking around Europe, the\n-- not just Jewish boys, I mean all boys. Second sons, third sons, fourth sons, you know.\nThey were not inheriting anything. They were on their own. So, my grandfather walked --\nhe had an uncle in Berlin and he walked. He walked first -- he was sent to Borna. In Borna,\nthat\u2019s where the family spunyard came from, and that is --",
        "Q: Family what?",
        "A: Spunyard -- spanyard -- it was called spanyard.",
        "Q: What is it?",
        "A: Well, spunyard is -- at a translation is Spaniard. A person from Spain, Spaniard. Well,\nthe spunyard family had a business 1n Borna, which was a mill and they produced cloth\nmaterial, that\u2019s what they did. And he was sent there to learn the business. So there is my\ngrandfather Hendrick in this teeny tiny town in the west -- in the west -- pardon me, in the\neast of Holland. He hated it with such a passion. Now, those people were very religious. My\ngrandfather was religious, he was raised very Jewish, but he wasn\u2019t like they were, they\nwere narrow about it. And so he fled, after awhile and he started going east. And he kept\ngoing east and he told these stories about first he got to Dusseldorf, one of those towns. And\nhe had to have some money. So he took a job with a furrier, and what did he have to do?\nThe furriers would get furs from all over Europe, mostly Russia and -- and -- and the\nScandinavian countries. And he had to scrape the flesh off of the furs, so you can imagine\nthe stink in there. I mean, it was horrendous. And since he was the littlest, because he was\nonly like -- I don\u2019t know exactly his age, but he was very young. And he would be -- the\nbag, because it stank so much, was hung out of the window -- where the scrapes were\nscraped into. And because he was the littlest, he was put into the bag to stamp it down. To --\nto -- to compress that stuff, because he -- because -- then they could put more in the bag,\nthese bags were leather and they were then taken somewhere and -- and emptied, I imagine.\nAnd he was telling these ta -- he --we -- used tell these awful stories, how terrible that all\nwas and he didn\u2019t want to do that, so he fled again and he kept walking east -- east -- east --\neast. There was another uncle in -- in Berlin. And he got to Berlin and that uncle ha -- wa --\nhad a furrier business and he took furs that were already scraped and ready to go, you know,\nto be made into coats. And that\u2019s where my grandfather Hendrick learned his business. It\nwas very -- it\u2019s a very amusing story, because what happened then -- he was quite handsome\n-- he was very blonde, very blue eyed -- sort of a reddish blonde hair. I was called a st --\ncalled a Dutchman. And he was -- there were Jewish families in Berlin that had been there a\nlong time, were very settled and one of them was the Filipis. And they were extremely rich\nand -- and one day the daughter, Ellen, my future grandmother had her 16th or 18th\nbirthday. And my great-grandfather, Louis -- Louis -- Luis, I think his name was -- who\nrode horses and did crazy things all -- all his life, gave a huge party for her. It was a g -- like\na coming out party, sort of -- you would call it now. And he invited every eligible bachelor\nin Berlin to that party. And so my grandfather knew he wasn\u2019t eligible at all. I mean, he was\njust, you know, a poor boy, really, working in -- in somebody\u2019s business. But he heard -- a\nfriend of his told him that there was going to be this great party, in this fabulous house and -\n- and he said, \u201cWell, I want to go.\u201d And the friend said, \u201cWell you have to have an\ninvitation.\u201d And he says, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll manage somehow.\u201d You know, \u201cWe\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll\nmanage it. Just take me with you,\u201d you know. So they rented a suit for him and they went\nand somehow he got in and because he was really very handsome. He was tall and he was\nnice looking and -- and blonde, she f -- Ellen liked him, of all the boys there, you know,\nwith beautiful names, that had been in Berlin for age -- she chose Hendrick Zeetroon. And\nher father, after the party, said, \u201cWell, which one shall it be?\u201d Because he knew that\nwhoever he chose, with all his money, she was going to get. So she said, \u201cHendrick\nZeetroon.\u201d And he\u2019d never heard of him -- anybody like that. It was a disaster. He | -- he\nsaid, \u201cNever,\u201d you know. And she said, \u201cOh, yes.\u201d And she locked herself in her room and\nshe wouldn\u2019t eat and she wouldn\u2019t drink and she wouldn\u2019t this and she wouldn\u2019t that and\nshe had the key and he couldn\u2019t get -- they couldn\u2019t get into the -- into the room. There\nwere lots of sisters in her family and brothers also. But they couldn\u2019t -- he loved Ellen\nbecause she was just as strong as he was. This was my grandfather I\u2019m talking about, Louie.\nAnd --",
        "Q: Your great -- great -- great-grandfather.",
        "A: My great-grandfather, yeah. So she won and she married Hendrick. It was a total\ndisaster, but nevertheless, you know, it was a -- she got whom she wanted, and he got so\nmuch money. I mean, now it would be a million and a half -- something like that, dowry. I\nmean it -- it was just tremendous. I have a tape that my Uncle Huntz made. That was -- is\nmy mother\u2019s youngest brother and that\u2019s where he tells this story. And he\u2019s the one where I\nget my figures from. So -- so -- so my grandfather suddenly was rich. And there are other\nfunny stories about the fact that he wanted my -- my great-grandfather said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He\nthought he would win out a little bit by that -- through that. He said, \u201cOkay, if you want to\nmarry him, he has to be a -- he has to become German. You can\u2019t marry anybody but a\nGerman, the Dutch are terrible all day. They have no culture, they have no this,\u201d you know,\n\u201cor that.\u2019 So, he tried to become a German. And -- and they have the papers, the family of\nmy Uncle Heinz has the papers for that. He applied to become a German citizen and my\nUncle Heinz has the answer of the German government to this and they said, \u201cIf you\nactually marry Ellen Filipi and if you have children and if they get to be 18 years old\nwithout any problem with the police or any kind of trouble with business or whatever. And\nif you haven\u2019t had any trouble with business, then you will be allowed to reapply for\ncitizenship.\u201d So they got married.",
        "Q: That\u2019s funny. Now was there any -- any question about or issue of their -- of his\nJewishness?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They were all Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He -- they were Jewish, but, you know, the Germans considered German -- Berlinners,\nthey considered these Jews -- I mean the Dutch, the Dutch were peasants to them. All the\nDutch were peasants to them. You know, nice little grab bag of -- of peasants.",
        "Q: Okay, now tell us -- let\u2019s spend a couple of minutes talking about your father\u2019s parents.",
        "A: Okay, my father.",
        "Q: And just the other ones and then we\u2019ll go on to some [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay, let\u2019s go to my fam -- par -- now, my father was born in Hirschbeck in\nAubershlasian, Upper Salasia, in Hirschbeck. Now, I have looked at where that is. I called\nthe German embassy, because when we went -- we\u2019re going to Prague, actually and I knew\nit wasn\u2019t too far from Prague. And I thought it was in Germany. It -- I mean, at the time that\nhe was born, it was Germany. These are these border areas that kept turning -- changing\nnationality. They -- they were -- they were German or they were Polish. Every time -- now,\nHirschbeck actually always was German, but guess what, it\u2019s Polish now. It is called\nYelenagura and it is up in the mountains in the most gorgeous country that you can imagine.\nIt\u2019s a little mountaintop town. I guess it\u2019s bigger now, a lot bigger. But I went there -- the\nlast time that I went there, I was six and a half, seven, sort of like that. That was when I was\nallowed to go walking with them. And I remember how gorgeous it was. I remember the\nfields with the weaving wheat and the red poppies and the blue cornflowers around the\nedges, mostly poppies. It was so gorgeous, with the mountains up there. Anyway, that\u2019s\nwhere my father was born and where I guess his father was born also. I had hoped to go\nthere and when I asked the German embassy, they said, \u201c\u201cWe don\u2019t have -- yes, they said, we\nhave two or three Hirschbecks. Which one do you want?\u201d And I said, \u201cUpper Salasia.\u201d\u201d And\nshe said, \u201cWe don\u2019t own that any more.\u201d After the second World War, it was given to\nPoland.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So, it\u2019s now Polish.",
        "Q: Why would that prevent you from going there?",
        "A: No, it wouldn\u2019t prevent me from going, but it does put a little bit of -- I -- I\u2019m not\nanxious to go to anything Polish. I -- I don\u2019t know why that is, but I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s interesting. You\u2019re -- you\u2019re more comfortable in Germany than in Poland.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Because what?",
        "A: Well, I can\u2019t -- I -- the Germans I can understand, you know. I can\u2019t speak a word of\nPolish. And -- and I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying and I\u2019ve heard nothing but bad things\nabout it. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very strange, because of course, as a European, I didn\u2019t know many\nbad things about Poland, what they did to the Jews and this and that, but as an American,\nnow, I met a lot of people whose descent is Polish and it\u2019s nothing but rotten. You know,\nthe things that you he -- that -- that I hear out of it.

        "A: Why?",
        "Q: I think it\u2019s just important to understand -- you know, for me, like for instance, one of the\nthings that -- that\u2019s a question that is -- some -- some people who have -- some people refuse\nto buy German products.",

        "A: No, I -- I have a hard time. I would like to buy a Mercedes, very much, but I would have\nto give myself a real shove to do it. I would -- really would like it. And no -- now when I\nwas in -- in -- in Germany now, you know, and I met so many nice people. I mean, I met\nnothing but nice people.

Because my father had many, many nice friends. And\nthere didn\u2019t seem to be, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: At least I didn\u2019t notice anything.",

And, to think of him -- it was the first time that I saw a model of the -- of the\npath that they had to go to get to the ovens.

I mean I -- I looked at that and I\u2019'd known it, after all. I have imagination\nenough. I had known all this and still, it just hit me so hard, that particular thing. The\nmurder -- you know, the films that they show, the -- the videos that they show of the\nmurdering, you know, where you have to look over the edge -- those things at the museum,\nso that kids can\u2019t see it right off.

And they cleaned it out\nand they sort of made it a makeshift gas chamber. What was really upsetting to me, was\nwhen you go two miles down the road to Birkenau and you see that they have worked with\nthis small facility at Auschwitz and it wasn\u2019t proper -- it wasn\u2019t designed well, it wasn\u2019t\nefficient. So they\u2019re going to build from the ground up, with all of their knowledge about\nhow to slaughter people.",

And then they --\ntheir -- these are lined up and they were all -- they\u2019re -- most of them are burned, because\nthey -- because they tried to burn them all down as they were running away.

And my grandfather was a lawyer and he was on\nthis town council and he was quite well known and -- and busy in that town and I think they\nlived very happily. I also think he was religious -- belonged to the -- whatever congregation\nthey had in Hirschbeck and -- and the -- I don\u2019t know how big the community was there.\nBut there obviously was one. The story is that he actually died giving a talk in the\nsynagogue on Rosh Hashanah, which was supposed to be an honor, to die in such a way.\nBut I -- this is his story and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so, I\u2019ve been trying to find out, you know, how old, actually, my grandfather was\nand my great-grandfa -- and my grandmother. My grandmother I only knew as a black\ndressed very old lady, with a very high hat, with -- with a black sort of drape coming off of\nit -- veil, sort of, coming off of it. She knit a lot of things for me, I remember that, having\nlittle dresses that she knit and -- and having scarves and things that she knit. And -- can you\nturn it off for a minute?",
        "Q: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: The -- the sad thing is that I don\u2019t know much about this grandfather. His -- his name\nwas Benno -- Benjamin Leiderman. And I understand that his father too -- I think his father\n-- my great-grandfather -- my great-grandfather had been a teacher in Hirschbeck. So that\u2019s\nalready, you know, quite a few generations that they lived there. They ha-had a wonderful\nhouse, which I remember, a really old-fashioned German tall house. And my grandmother --\nat the time she was quite old and she had a stiff leg, which has worried me all my life,\nbecause I keep thinking, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to get the same thing that she had.\u201d Which I don\u2019t\nremember quite well what it was, but I know that they s -- made one of her legs stiff,\nbecause that was probably easier on her than -- than whatever she had, you know? They\ndidn\u2019t have so many medical things as they have now. She always had somebody who lived\nwith her and I know that in 19 -- during the time -- when Germany had it\u2019s -- it\u2019s bank\nbreakdown, you know, which was earlier than the United States. I guess United States was\n\u201829 --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: When -- we -- yeah, this was earlier -- that she lost the house. And I know that my father\nand his sister rented the house, from the person who -- who bought it, for my grandmother,\nso she never knew that she had lost that house. Because they didn\u2019t want her to -- you know,\nI mean those were terrible days. My father was -- was studying in Breslau, I think he was in\nBreslau. Actually, he wasn\u2019t studying, he was interning in Breslau at the time. And he was\ntelling me these stories about how he would get paid at the end of the week and -- and he\nwould get an -- a paper bag full of money and he would run to the store and buy whatever\nhe could buy, you know, in food and things, because if you waited at all, for a minute, that\nwhole bag might buy you one little wurst, you know. That\u2019s how the money went down, I\nmean, the money was just worth nothing in Germany. And -- and I forget now when that --\nwhen that was, \u201822? \u201820? So it -- it was earlier than -- than that.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay, instead of H-a-n-s. And you said Ha-Heinz and Ava, who had a bagel -- the baby\ndid go underground.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: My father was just so upset because he said if they ever find him, they will be punished\nmore than the Jews are already punished.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: At the time they thought all Jews would go to the labor camp and just work. Heinz was\nhis favorite cousin, he was worried.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you want their story? And then she said no.",
        "A: That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So I -- I want --",
        "A: That\u2019s what I told you about this morning.",
        "Q: I would like to hear the story.",
        "A: You would like to hear the story?",
        "Q: Yes, very much.",
        "A: Okay. I hope I don\u2019t make mistakes in them, but -- because I wasn\u2019t there. The story was\nthat -- that Heinz and Ava were still able to bring all their things from Germany, so they had\nbeautiful furniture and lovely silver. Ava came from a very, very well-to-do family. And it\nwas her brother with whom I went out in London and who saved his coupons for me.",
        "Q: Ava\u2019s brother?",
        "A: Ava\u2019s brother, Gunther. His name was Gunther. She had two brothers, they both were in\nEngland. And okay, so Ava and Heinz lived in the Hague and it was very interesting,\nbecause Heinz worked for a German company in Berlin and that German company, when\nthey saw things were getting tight for the Jews, sent him to Holland and he worked in\nHolland for this same company. And believe it or not, after the war, he worked for that same\ncompany, in Holland. And he became a vice president and had a wonderful life.",
        "Q: What kind of company was it?",
        "A: It was -- it had something to do with iron and smelting and metal and that kind of thing.\nHe traveled all over the world and was a great collector of oriental art, mostly Japanese.\nAnd after he retired, he became extremely well known because he -- there\u2019s a small group of\ncollectors all over the world, of these particular things that he was collecting. And he wrote\nmany articles in the -- their papers and in their -- in their journals and magazines and that\nwas the interesting thing about that side also, of the family, how very artistic -- how very\ninternationally artistic they were. They all were like that -- I ver -- 1t was really amazing\nbecause Ray -- th-the son, who lives 1n Israel, he\u2019s also like that, he\u2019s also collecting and\nhe\u2019s also, you know, very interested in history and in -- in -- in that whole oriental art. And I\nremember Heinz coming to visit in -- in Washington, when we still lived up there in -- in --\nat Chevy Chase and he went to the Freer gallery the director knew him, you know? The\nhead of the gallery knew him -- his name, anyway and he took him down into the stacks and\nhe saw -- my hus -- Marty went with him -- my husband Martin went with him and so he\ntold me how they saw things that was never -- you know, that was never, or hardly ever\ndisplayed, because the Freer never had enough gallery space to display. No museum really\nhas everything that they have. So Heinz was qu -- he made quite a second life for himself\nafter he retired. Okay, what happened to them in the war was that they had friends who\nhelped them go underground and who also took all their things and hid -- with them and\nkept it for them. And Heinz and Ava were underground with a farmer, who had a big farm\nsomewhere in -- in Holland. And they could not keep Ray with them. Ray was only year\nand a half, or two -- something like that and they had to hide Ray. Now Ray was very\nJewish looking, different from them, actually. Heinz looked a bit like you and Ava was --\nyou couldn\u2019t tell what she was. So, but -- but Ray had quite, you know, he had a definite\nkind of darkness, which in Holland you don\u2019t see much. And he was hard to hide and he\nwas very little. And so, somehow the underground managed to hide him and just recently --\nI thought -- I thought that he\u2019d only been in one place the whole time. But just recently Ray\ntold me that he was in many places, that he was handed around, you know, in many places.\nAnd that he felt -- was -- really had a terrible time, til the very end, the last people ended up\nbeing absolutely wonderful. And he\u2019s still in touch with them and he still ta -- you know, he\n-- he -- when their children come over here, he takes care of them. I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t mean over\nhere, when they ever come to Israel. The Dutch like to go to Israel, so they do come. And\nwhen he goes to Holland, he always visits that family. And 1t was most amazing how close\nthey really had gotten.",
        "Q: How long did he live with them?",
        "A: But he was such a little -- I mean, h -- pardon me?",
        "Q: How long did he live with them?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, exactly. Must have been the last year -- the -- the last year, but he\nsaid that -- that in one place, the people hated him. I mean, they were so awful that they\nburned him with cigarette burns and -- and all sorts of -- you know, he just had a terrible\ntime. I have heard that in Holland, people were really wonderful. The ones I met were all\nwonderful, you know. But I\u2019ve heard that there were really quite difficult thing -- for\ninstance, the mayor of Amsterdam, he -- he wrote an article and he describe -- he was in 10\ndifferent places, he -- he was handed from one place, he couldn\u2019t get along -- you know, he\nwas already a little older, so he had ideas. And in this one family, where he was -- I\u2019m\ntalking about the mayor of Amsterdam, the -- the ex-mayor of Amsterdam. It was his\nbirthday and they didn\u2019t say anything about his birthday, and he knew that they knew it was\nhis birthday. And it happened to be that in their religion, you don\u2019t make a fuss about\nanybody\u2019s birthday.",
        "Q: What religion is that?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. But it -- but that was 1n their -- in their particular brand.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so he couldn\u2019t -- he was a little boy, you know, and he couldn\u2019t keep his mouth\nclosed, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday. You didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d And they were so angry at\nhim. They were so terribly angry and he was already so lost and so -- you know, he -- this\nall came out when that hidden child business -- he was one of the hidden children. And he\nreally had, also, it -- it was the first time that I realized what happened to some of those\nchildren. They were much worse off than I. I mean, you know, I was the perfect age, I\ndescribed that off the tape.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It -- but the hidden children, oh my God.",
        "Q: So you mentioned that, yeah, yesterday, you know, that in -- basically in her -- her -- I\nthink in the general theories of -- of -- of child upbringing, that many of the children who\nhad gotten beyond a certain age, I\u2019m not sure, maybe five, that they had previously had such\nwarm and nurturing families --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- that it prepared them to put up with this nightmare and also that they -- that those\nchildren had -- what was done to them was done to their whole family and not -- was not an\ninternal problem within the family.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Which made it easier -- you know, so you didn\u2019t have the same kind of emotional effect.\nBut what you\u2019re describing are children who are even younger than that, who have to go\nthrough that critical period of nurturing in a very roller-coaster kind of experience.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- that\u2019s very interesting, because Ray -- when r -- when the war was finished\nand Ray got back to his parents, it was extremely hard. I mean the --I -- he must have\nrealized that these were really his parents, you know? But I think he was afraid. He never --\nhe didn\u2019t have a very nice youth. Another thing was, that for Ray\u2019s generation, there were\nreally no Jewish kids, or very, very few Jewish kids his age alive. Th-There weren\u2019t any.",
        "Q: Where did he spend the rest of his childhood?",
        "A: Well, in Holland.",
        "Q: In Holland?",
        "A: In amste -- in, sorry, no, in the Hague. And he was extremely careful and -- and a bit\nworried always. And then he looked so Jewish and -- and there weren\u2019t anybody else around\nthat looked like him.",
        "Q: And you say he has a brother, right?",
        "A: Now, he has a brother. Now let\u2019s --",
        "Q: Who was born when?",
        "A: \u201846. The year after the war ended. The guy has been a meteor. I mean, he shot up, you\nknow. He was beautiful, he was tall. He looks like Prince Charles, exactly. Handsomer, I\nmean. He\u2019s younger. And he -- he had millions of friends. He was easy going. He knew, in\nshort, from nothing, you know? From -- he knew nothing of what Ray went through and his\ndepth of experience, and -- anyway, Ray has a lot more soul than -- than -- than Steve has.\nYou know, it\u2019s built in, one way or the other. And he\u2019s doing -- he married somebody who\nwasn\u2019t Jewish, whereas Ray -- in Holland, as I said, there were so few Jewish people. So\nwhat they did was, they got the young generation together once or twice or three times a\nyear, in a particular place. The Jewish people got together and organized that so the kids\ncould meet each other. That\u2019s how he met his wife. He met his wife somewhere in Utrect or\nsomewhere where one -- where that meeting was. Because, where he lived, there weren\u2019t\nenough to even choose from.",
        "Q: And Steven? Where does he live now and what does he do?",
        "A: Well, Steven lives in London, but he has a house in Connecticut and he has a house\noutside of -- of London, in the countryside. He is a stockbroker. He is extremely well off.\nHe married a beautiful non-Jewish Dutch girl and they have three gorgeous sons. I mean, it\nseems like the sun is shining, you know, wherever he goes. And when Tante Ava died and\nthere was a lot of the art work, that -- the art articles that Uncle Heinz collected, you know --\nSteven wouldn\u2019t give up anything, I -- you know? I mean, to -- Ray lives in -- lives in\nJerusalem. He -- he is the head of a huge -- of a nice department at one of the universities.\nHe is very successful in his work, but you know, he makes no money hardly at all. I mean,\nhe should have, you know --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nBarbara Rodbell. This is tape number two, side B.",
        "A: He is a stockbroker. He is extremely well off. He married a beautiful non-Jewish Dutch\ngirl and they have three gorgeous sons. I mean, it seems like the sun is shining, you know,\nwherever he goes. And when Tante Ava died and there was a lot of the art work, that -- the\nart articles that Uncle Heinz collected, you know -- Steven wouldn\u2019t give up anything, I --\nyou know? I mean, t-to -- Ray lives in -- lives in Jerusalem. He -- he is the head of a huge --\nof a nice department at one of the universities. He is very successful in his work, but you\nknow, he makes no money hardly at all. I mean, he should have, you know, I mean, if I had\nbeen Steven, I would have said, \u201cTake it -- you know, it\u2019s yours.\u201d Uh-uh. And so d -- it\u2019s\nvery different kind of -- I love Steven, he\u2019s great, but you know, nothing -- you know, I can\nunderstand Ray\u2019s resentment and he has it, he has resentment. He thinks, \u201cLook what I go --\nwen-went through. Look what hap --\u201d you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And -- yeah. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- that is a typical story. Anyway, let me tell you what\nhappened to Heinz and -- Heinz and Ava and -- themselves, so I told you about Ray.",
        "Q: Okay, then we\u2019ll get back to you.",
        "A: Heinz and Ava went underground with this farmer. And the underground had a rule that\nif you took 1n people to hide them, you weren\u2019t supposed to do anything else under -- you\nknow, under kind of illegal work or anything.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But this farmer had a son and this son -- and they had a lot of land. And the son\npermitted the British to drop weapons, in big wooden crates, for the underground, on his\nland. And some other things, you know, that -- anyway the son got found out.",
        "Q: I was going to say, that must have been pretty dangerous.",
        "A: Oho, that\u2019s an understatement. So -- so one day the Germans appeared. They -- they had\n-- they had been given away or they had -- they weren\u2019t looking for Ava and Heinz, they\nweren\u2019t looking for underground people, they were looking for weapons that had been, you\nknow, dropped from the sky or hidden there in the barns. And when that happened, they --\nthey were warned and Ava -- they -- o-or if they weren\u2019t warned, Ava was -- they picked up\nall the men. They picked up Heinz, they picked up the farmer and his son and you know,\nwhoever else they picked up there, but not the women, they left the women. So, Ava was --\nthe underground came, took Ava and hid her somewhere else. They hid her with a farmer in\nthe south of Holland, in -- in Zout, Holland and Heinz they took to Westerbork, which was\nthe collection camp, before you went to the east. And in that collection camp, there was a\nfriend of his named Otto Bierman -- Otto Bierman.",
        "Q: How -- how do you spell that?",
        "A: B-i-e-r-m-a-n. Otto Bierman and Otto was a very intelligent man and he had convinced\nthe head of the camp of Westerbork that he could produce something that would make him -\n- this -- this head of the camp -- ingratiate him with -- with Hitler and his upper -- the upper\nechelons. He said -- and -- and the man -- an-and he said, \u201cWell, what would that be?\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cYou know, what is it that the German weremarkt really needs? One of the things it\nneeds is toothpaste.\u201d Now Otto Bierman was a chemist and so the -- the commandant said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, can you get it together?\u201d And you know, and, \u201cWhat do you need, you\nknow, to do this?\u201d And Otto gave him a list and this and that and -- and he said, \u201cWell, I\nwill need so many people to do this, to produce whatever you need, which is quite a bit.\u201d So\nI forget how many people it was, but one of them was Heinz and that saved his life, because\nhe was still there after the commandant was gone, you know, at -- at the -- when -- when the\nwar was over.",
        "Q: Making toothpaste?",
        "A: Making toothpaste.",
        "Q: We-Were they making it for the whole army? The whole Germany army?",
        "A: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, whatever they could do.",
        "Q: Or -- yeah, well --",
        "A: You know, they made as many as is --",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So that Bierman really -- he, later on, Bierman and his wife, actually, who -- whom he\nmet in the camp, who was the sist -- the reason I know Bierman so well is because he was\nthe sister -- he married the sister of Maria Austria, who was my photography teacher. The\none who lived the same place Anne Frank lived.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, it\u2019s all sort of interwoven.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In that small community. And they then raised two children, who belonged to her\nbrother, who had been killed.",
        "Q: Who -- who raised the children?",
        "A: The Biermans. So Otto and -- and Li -- and Liese raised the children of her brother.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Her brother and sister died of illness in ca -- in Bergen-Belsen. And but -- and the girls\nhad been with them in Bergen-Belsen, but survived.",
        "Q: And where are they now?",
        "A: In Amsterdam.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: I see them all the ti -- whenever I go, I see them, yeah. We\u2019re pretty close, actually. One\nof them just --",
        "Q: So they -- and the relationship was with -- with Bierman was --",
        "A: Bierman married Lisa -- Elise Ershtrasher -- Liesel Ershtrasher and Liesel Ershtrasher\nwas the sister of Maria Austria. Ershtrasher -- Austria, it\u2019s the same thing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Who was my photography teacher and a friend of my mother\u2019s.",
        "Q: Really? Okay.",
        "A: And who lived on the Mawaydaplane.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Next -- actually the next stoop from Anne Frank -- the next --",
        "Q: And they were -- and he -- they were -- they were -- previously they were good friends\nwith Heinz?",
        "A: This Bierman saved Heinz.",
        "Q: But did he know Heinz from before?",
        "A: He must have. He must have. I don\u2019t know about that, but I think he must have. Because\nhe asked for him. Because Heinz of course, he was in a Straffbabacker, which means in one\nof the punishment barracks. One of the barracks that had an S on it for punishment.",
        "Q: What -- I wanted to ask you a question, when you -- when we -- when the very\nbeginning, when we first started to talk today, you were talking about your friend Manfred.\nCould you tell -- I -- I don\u2019t know if you can, but can you talk a little bit about what it\u2019s like\nto -- to have someone like that in your life, who had -- who was so responsible for saving\nyour life?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how to -- to -- I met Manfred -- this 1s rather interesting. I -- I told you I\nknow nothing about politics. Here I am 16 years old and I describe in the other tape how\nwhen you were 16, you were considered a family on your own and you needed your own\nstamp of -- of security, so you wouldn\u2019t be taken away. Th-The Franks went, for instance,\nOtto Frank, the Franks went underground when Margot got called up to be sent to so-called\nwork camps, right? Well, to avoid that situation, to not be called up, you needed to work in\nsomething that the Germans considered essential. Up to 16 years, your father or mother,\nwhoever in your family worked for one of those organizations, like the Jewish -- the\nYoteserrat, th -- some kind of organizations that the Germans recognized as necessary. Do\nyou get that?",
        "Q: Yeah, but what were they -- what were they -- what was this --",
        "A: So -- well, my father, for instance, had one of those stamps, he was a translator for the\nYoteserrat, for the Jewish organization that really oversaw the shipping off -- the organized\nshipping off of the Jews to the east.",
        "Q: So they were necessary to the German shipping -- help in the --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- the deportations.",
        "A: Yes. So -- but that\u2019s not what the Germans told him they were doing, you know, that --\nthe Germans told them that they were helping their own people and things like that, you\nknow they -- so -- and they would re -- that -- that they would remain after everybody else\nwas gone and this and that, which 1s all nonsense, because everybody went. But this -- this\nis hindsight. You know, it\u2019s very stran -- it\u2019s very different to look at something from the\nhistorical point of view --",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: -- than when you\u2019re in it, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to -- what the future will hold. So\n-- what were we saying?",
        "Q: I -- well, I was asking you about what it\u2019s like to have somebody who saved your life?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, but how did I get to the Yoteserrat? Oh, there was an organization in ea -- 1n\nthe east of Amsterdam, which was called -- and I have na -- now I -- totally escape. It was\ncalled Hershelsander -- Hershelsander. And it was supposed to be a culture -- Jewish\ncultural organization that would train Jews to be ready to go to Israel or some other country\nso that they could have a craft or a -- a profession that they could use. It\u2019s one of those hoax,\nnonsense, idiotic things that the Germans thought up. And that organization, it so happened,\nthere were lots of Communists 1n it. There were lots of people that -- that had -- maybe they\nweren\u2019t really Communists, but they had a political opinion.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they knew about things before they happened, you know? And th-they had some\nkind of a view. They had some people that came from Germany, for instance, out of the\ncamps, the early camps, you know, in \u201840 -- in -- in 39, \u201840, who told stories about what\nwas really happening in Germany, what -- what wasn\u2019t written in the press. And these\npeople were knowledgeable and one of them was Manfred. I didn\u2019t know anything about\nthat.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I met -- my father managed to get me a place to work in that particular organization. He\ndidn\u2019t -- also knew nothing about them. He only knew that that was one place where he\ncould get a secure place for me, becoming 16 years old.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I went there. What did we do? We organized courses -- for instance sewing, cooking,\ngarde-gardening, I guess. I mean se -- landscape -- land -- lundbow as they called it. You\nknow, something to do with the earth, agriculture -- agriculture. However, we also had\ncourses on Moliere and Shakespeare. Well, in the course on Moli\u00e9re, I met Manfred. I -- I\nwas working there and he was working there -- or he came there to take a course, I can\u2019t\nremember, maybe he wasn\u2019t even working there, but he knew the people. I didn\u2019t know the\npeople, but he knew the people that were working there. This was an organization that really\nhad been there before and was doing the same sort of thing. It had to do with the Allia, you\nknow, the -- the s -- the people who were just wanting to go to Israel. I guess Zionists or\nsomething, although these people were no Zionists. But -- but they were training -- this\norganization had been there before and the Germans just took it over and used it as what I\ndescribed, an organization [indecipherable]. So what I did was draw up the names of the\npeople who wanted to take the courses, make up schedules for courses. Get the prou -- help\nget the professors for the courses and that kind of thing. You know, that\u2019s was my job.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Had nothing to do with anything for the German. So anyway, I met Manfred in there.\nAnd I was 16 - 17, ?\u2019'd never had a boyfriend, never gone out, never anything. You couldn\u2019t\nride the trolleys, you couldn\u2019t ride the bus, you had to walk. So -- being Jewish -- so --",
        "Q: Jews weren\u2019t allowed to ride on the bus?",
        "A: No. No -- no trolley, no bus, no nothing. So I had -- we had the yellow star and maybe I\nhad a bicycle, I -- I can\u2019t remember. We -- we could bike for a long time, but then -- then we\ncouldn\u2019t even bike any more. So Manfred and I started -- I mean I started walking home or\nriding bike home or whatever it was, I can\u2019t remember details.",
        "Q: Yeah. You tell some of this [indecipherable]",
        "A: And we\u2019d started getting together, you know, doing that and I got to meet him and I\nreally liked him and he really liked me and so that was my first boyfriend. And that\u2019s how I\ngot involved with this whole thing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he knew more than I knew.",
        "Q: I understand that, but --",
        "A: And he started telling me all these things.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he\u2019s -- I -- I -- I s-suddenly started seeing beyond my parents. My father said, \u201cIf\nyou get called up, you have to go, because oth-otherwise we will get punished.\u201d It\u2019s\ndifferent from -- from Margot Frank, you know, where her father said, \u201cIf you get called up,\nwe -- we go underground.\u201d My father was -- at the time, he was -- he was born in 1889, so\nin four -- in -- in \u201841, how old was he?",
        "Q: 52?",
        "A: Yeah. He was getting on. And he -- he had already had to make or that -- that move from\nGermany to Holland, it was too much for him, he couldn\u2019t do another one. And he knew he\ncouldn\u2019t do another one. And when my mother, who was so much younger, started to talk\nabout going underground, he couldn\u2019t face it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that was the -- the situation. And so Manfred started talking about all these things and\nmy eyes -- my head, you know. And so I -- I started believing him, I started looking at\nthings through his eyes and through -- I saw things I had never seen before. You know, I\nsaw people going on trains with singing and Manfred said that they get killed. And they said\nthey were going to go to work, and sit around a campfire at night. And, as difficult as it was,\nI started to believe him. It didn\u2019t seem likely, you know, what they were telling me. And\npeople -- young -- other young people started coming and telling me stories and saying, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want to die.\u201d I remember my -- one girlfriend, Zucker, her name was -- her last name\nwas Zucker, with a Z, you know, like sugar, in German. She came to me and she -- she said\n-- she sat there crying in my room, I can see her, you know, a little woman -- little girl, 16.\nSaid, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die, I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d I didn\u2019t even think -- I never did think of\ndying and I didn\u2019t then. I don\u2019t know, they were taken away. I -- I don\u2019t know if she\nsurvived, or what.",
        "Q: My question was --",
        "A: How did you f --",
        "Q: -- probably hard -- harder to answer, but I\u2019m just curious what it\u2019s like since the war.",
        "A: Oh, since the war.",
        "Q: After the war. What is it like to have people in your life -- I mean, obviously -- I mean\nit\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a different experience, okay? It\u2019s something that in -- like I -- I -- I don\u2019t think --\nI mean other than my parents, I don\u2019t think that there are people in my life who have saved\nmy life, to whom I have this eternal debt, you know?",
        "A: Yeah, well.",
        "Q: I saved somebody\u2019s life, a stranger\u2019s life once in a swimming pool, somebody who was\ndrowning.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: And I just remem -- he didn\u2019t even, you know, it\u2019s like I never kept in touch with him or\nanything, but it was a mom -- but it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not --",
        "A: But we lived together -- I mean we lived together in a group. We lived together for years,\nafter all. And it is strange, and I\u2019ve seen it in other tight situations. When the war was over -\n- now, from a personal point of view, toward the end of the war, I knew I was not going to\nmarry Manfred and we were talking about marria -- he want -- he wanted to get married and\nI knew I couldn\u2019t marry him. And it had partly to do with the fact that he kept telling me\nthat my father had killed my family. And what he meant was that he didn\u2019t want to go\nunderground. My father -- Manfred offered -- he -- he offered the papers and my mother\nsaid -- got -- got him the money. My mother had the papers. Manfred said even if she hadn\u2019t\npaid, he would have gotten the papers, because he could not -- he would have had a bad\nconscience all his life, he wouldn\u2019t have done for them what he did for me, you know.\nAlthough I didn\u2019t get my first papers through Manfred. I got my first false papers through\nother people. But my mother gave me the money for it. And she had to ask my father for the\nmoney and my father did not believe in this. But my mother put her foot down. And she\ndidn\u2019t do that very often. She became the strength of the whole family. And she loved\nManfred. And she kept telling me, \u201cStick with him, he is strong, he is true. He -- stick with\nhim, stick with him.\u201d And my sister loved him. She was younger than I was and she kept\nsaying how wonderful he was. And I was worried about him. But he -- he was wonderful\nand he did save my life, but I never really thought about that til way afterwards. I mean,\nwhen you live your life, you live your life. And I did the cooking and I did the cleaning and\nI worked very hard, so did he -- I mean so did we all, so did his sister, who turned out to be\nas important -- maybe not more important than he was. He -- after the war, as I said, I -- I\nknew I wasn\u2019t going to marry him and we split up. I lived -- went to live somewhere else. I\nhad met Otmar through Manfred, really. And although I wasn\u2019t sure there was any future in\nthere, I lived by myse -- I went and got an apartment somewhere else, which was great luck\nthat I could even find anything after the war. And then of course, my Uncle Paul came back\nand Heinz came back and they were the two anchors, you know, that I had, even though\nthey were so busy with themselves, you can\u2019t imagine. After having all this happening to\nyou, that to try to pick up the normal strand of normal life was not easy for people who had\nfamilies and for anybody else as well. And I went, immediately, I was already in the ballet\nthe month before the war was ended, I immediately went into the ballet, which took all my\nmind and all my strength. We hadn\u2019t had any food. And to work as hard physically as I had\nto work, took all I had and a bit more, you know? We started to have a little bit better food.\nIt took a long time for the food to come in. And although I had not been as hungry as most\npeople had for as long -- because in the end we were very hungry, I still was really\nunderfed. And I\u2019ve heard it said that my generation of dancers, did not last physically as\nlong as most generations last.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: I mean that -- yes, that was a phenomenon of -- of the times, yeah. So, as I say, I went\nand lived somewhere else and -- and Manfred, he was unhappy, but he soon, you know,\nfound -- he also felt he had to go on with his life and he had -- and he found somebody else\nand he had two children. And although the marriage didn\u2019t last, you know, very long and\nManfred started messing around. He\u2019s always told me, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault.\u201d He --\nevery time he sees me, he says this, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault.\u201d He\u2019s been married several times,\nthree, four. So -- so, but the last 20 years he\u2019s had the same wife, much younger and very\nnice and I stayed with them last year. I h -- I stayed with them and it was funny, you know,\nthe first and the last of his wives -- the so-called wives. We had a lot of fun.",
        "Q: Hm. Wh -- and what was his -- what became his profession?",
        "A: Well he -- even before the war was over, he knew what he w-wanted to do. He wanted to\nstart a factory of women\u2019s clothing. And he started collecting sewing machines. Now I had\none and that was the first one. Yeah, I had one from my mo-mother and that was the first\none. It wasn\u2019t electrified and he got a motor and -- but he -- he found -- he bought -- he went\naround looking for sewing machines, even before the war was quite, quite over. And he\nknew that he was -- wanted to -- wanted to do that. And he knew where there was a -- a\ncache -- I mean a number of -- a cloth that was difficult, you know, to find. There wasn\u2019t\nany material, there was no cloth. And this se -- first wife he married, Maurecia, she had been\nin that business and she knew how to do it. And she was a great help to him. That was part\nof their getting together, because she -- she was really knowledgeable in that. And she also -\n- because she had lost a great deal -- I forget what -- what she had lost, but she got at some\nmoney and she got some money from the government -- from the amer -- Dutch government\nas well as the ger -- I -- I can\u2019t remember, but she got a lot of -- she got some money and he\nneeded the money. We did strange things, you know. After the war, they had money left\nover, my -- Manfred, I don\u2019t know what he did, but there was money. Now, there was no\nway to explain this money. And I -- I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know anything about it. But\nthe only one who could have had some money was me, you know, because I -- I could have\ns -- you know, I could have had some money from my parents, from jewelry that was sold,\nor this or that. And so you had to take in this money and get the new money that -- the\ncurrent money that they were putting out. And so I did that for them, even though we\nweren\u2019t together any more. So I -- I kept in touch and I did -- you know, I went there and I\ns-signed saying this was my money and you know, stuff like that.",

        "A: The bad -- evil. Pure and simple. And often have to do, I think, that often has to do with\nthis terrific feeling of inferiority. And -- or uselessness, don\u2019t know what the hell to do with\nthemselves, nothing but brawn, no brain, you know?",

        "Q: I think it\u2019s -- want to stop?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah...",
        "A: Yeah, well. What I was saying was about the compartmentalization. I -- I sometimes\nworry about myself, that I -- Iam too cool about things. Too -- I look ahead, I -- I try to plan\nand get myself ready for what comes next. And what I -- I think P\u2019ve always been like that,\nbut it might be just in my older age, you know, that I\u2019m that way, because I\u2019ve gotten older.\nBut I\u2019m so enormously prag -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s pragmatic, or -- if that\u2019s what you call\npragmatic. I\u2019m very practical. I can get -- I can get past my moods, past my -- I can get past\nfeelings, by being pragmatic, you know. It\u2019s a -- the feelings come afterwards, first you do\nsomething and then -- it\u2019s just funny, my father used to say, first your duty and then your\npleasure. And I think that that stuck with me. It\u2019s very German, you know. And I definitely,\nyou know, I ha -- do first what I have to do and then I can let myself go, you know, I can\nalso let myself go, but I don\u2019t do that before I do what I have to do. It\u2019s very strange. It\u2019s\nvery strange, I -- I remember when I came to United States, you know, I had no money at\nall. Once I left New York, once I decided I could not really make a living dancing or in\nphotography or something like that and I thought I had to leave New York, because that\u2019s\nwhat I did in New York.",
        "Q: How long did you -- did you stay in New York?",
        "A: Nearly two years, not quite. Nearly two years. And -- and part of that time, I wasn\u2019t\nthere, I was other places. I was in the -- you know, I took jobs out of New York, because I\ndid get into thr -- I did three auditions and I got into each one of the shows that I auditioned\nfor. And one of them was the Ballet Rousse, with Danilova -- or Danilova. And I couldn\u2019t --\nwhen I went to sign the contract, I couldn\u2019t do it, because they didn\u2019t pay me enough to pay\nthe rent and to buy my shoes and to eat. So, I didn\u2019t sign for it. So I ended up -- and in the\nother shows that I tried for and I got chosen for each one I tried, there was either the star\ndropped out and they couldn\u2019t raise all the money that they needed, or something else\nhappened, some contract fell through or some kind -- some of them I even started rehearsing\nand we had to stop because something happened with the finances or something like that. So\nin the end, I had no -- very, very little money and I\u2019d worked at Macy\u2019s and I\u2019d worked at --\nyou know, what actors and dancers do during -- in New York, during the -- while they\u2019re\nlooking for a job. I\u2019d done all that and I decided, I\u2019ve got to get out of New York or -- you\nknow, I joined a circus. I tried for the circus, after I\u2019d tried all the other things, you know,\nthe real -- the shows, the Broadway shows and -- and the ballets and I got into all that stuff\nand then every time something terrible happened, each time your heart jumps, you know\nand -- and bung, doesn\u2019t work out. So, I went to an audition at the circus, with Ellen Crooks,\nthe -- the girl I had the apartment with in Greenwich Village and we both got in there and\nwe went down to --",
        "Q: As -- as -- and as what?",
        "A: Ringling Brothers. Dancers.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I -- they asked me if I wanted to do, you know, other things. And I said, \u201cOh, yes.\u201d\nSo I did the small aerial, which was 25 dollars extra. And I -- in the end, I ended up also\ndoing elephants. One of the gals that was riding elephants got hurt and she couldn\u2019t do it.\nAnd so the guy who directed the show, choreographed the -- choreographed the whole\nthing, he knew my name. He called -- he called me the tawny Pippit. And he -- and his name\nwas Babbette and he shouted, \u201cThe tawny pippit, get on that elephant.\u201d And -- she fell off,\nbroke her leg, got carried away and I got on there. And he said, \u201cNow you know why she\ngot hurt.\u201d You know, she didn\u2019t fold her legs behind her when the elephants were standing\nstill, which means -- and the elephants liked to rub up against the walls and she really got\nwhammed. So I put my legs behind me. Sitting and fold your legs behind you so the\nelephants can\u2019t hurt them. So I did the show. I went -- you know, we ended up in Madison\nSquare Garden and all the way up and down, you know, the -- the coast and stuff. And then\nthey went inland, to the west. And that\u2019s when I got scared.",
        "Q: Scared of what?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want to let go of that east coast. I -- I quit.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: I was really a coward. I had six month -- I was -- well, we had rehear -- you know, we\nhad all the weeks in, in Florida.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Sarasota, rehearsing and then I guess I stained -- I stayed about half a year or something\nlike that.",
        "Q: And did you enjoy it while you were doing it?",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was terrific. But -- but -- and it was very adventurous, I mean, gosh. You\nknow, we lived on a train and we ate in the -- and we -- I made enormous money, because I\ndidn\u2019t spend a nickel. I wanted to save for when I came back, that I had some money. And I\nhad the apartment, so -- so that\u2019s what happened, that, you know, I got back to New York, I\nhad a lot of money. And then I took a job at -- was it Macy\u2019s? Yeah, I as -- guess I took a\njob -- Christmas job at Macy\u2019s. So -- and there I made a fortune, because they put me -- they\ngave me a job -- you got a bonus for always being on time. You got a bonus for not miss-\nmissing any days. And you got a bonus for -- they put me to sell difficult merchandise.\nMerchandise that had some kind of a damage to it. For instance, I was selling a paint set for\nkids that was -- you put -- there -- it had a brush, it had some liquid and it had paper, that\u2019s\nall that was in the box. But when you stuck the brush in the liquid and you went over the\npaper, all sorts of colors and pictures came up. However, should you by any chance drop a\ndrop of this liquid on the floor, it would eat the rug. So this was merchandise that was\ndifficult to sell, because they had to put a warning on it and they did put a warning on it. So\nthe people who bought it knew that, you know, there was no doubt about it, Macy\u2019s did the\nright thing, except they should never have bought the stuff, right? And I sold that. I sold a\ndoll that ha -- was dangerous for kids, because it had some kind of a finger that stuck out or\nsomething, that might get into some kid\u2019s eye. So there was all sorts of merchandise that\nwas -- that was dangerous to s -- or -- or did something, or didn\u2019t -- and for each piece that\nyou sold, you got credit. So, I tell you, I did all those things. I ran every morning. I had to\ntake two subways or a bus and a subway, or something like that to get there. 34th Street and\nI lived on East and this was 34 --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] something, when you say you ran every morning, you don\u2019t mean you\ngot up and jogged every morning?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t mean job. People didn\u2019t jog in 1950.",
        "Q: Okay, [indecipherable]",
        "A: In 1950. No, I -- or \u201849 it was. No, I ran up the elevator, which wasn\u2019t running, you\nknow? And just trying to be on time. And I did, I was there. I made a fortune that Christmas.\nHowever, it was also a terrible Christmas for me, because the Kalinoffsky\u2019s had a house full\nof people and couldn\u2019t have me. And I was lonely to such a degree, I -- I can\u2019t describe it. It\nwas too absolutely horrible. It was absolutely horrible. And -- so I had a lot of mo -- but I\nhad another one of my really going kaput, you know, situations and you had to give an\nemergency number on your application and a buyer who was very nice, he was very nice to\nme and he called Kalinoffsky, who had been my emergency number and Kalinoffsky came\nand said he wanted to talk to me and stuff and -- so we did meet. We met for lunch or I went\nover one -- after Christmas they had a time that I could come to their pla -- and I always felt\nso beholden. Is he all right?",
        "Q: I think he\u2019s asleep.",
        "A: Oh good. So -- so I always felt so beholden, I didn\u2019t want to ask them for anything. And\nso, at the -- and he talked to me and he said, \u201cYou know, I wonder if you still think you\u2019re\ngoing to go back to Holland?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I am thinking that.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t think\nit.\u201d He -- and he started explaining to me about Otmar. He said, \u201cA person like that -- face\nhim with it. You have to know that he really doesn\u2019t want to get married. You have to know\nthat,\u201d he said. He thought that was the case. But I should know it and I should hear it from\nOtmar. If I had it in the back of my mind that maybe we could get married, and maybe he\nwould give in to having children, you know, he said, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to settle down\nhere. And you have to make up your mind.\u201d I had not gone out with anybody, during this\nentire period. I mean, I kept thinking. I -- I don\u2019t know what I thought, but I just didn\u2019t want\nto, you know, make any kind of commitment or even date, so that I might make a\ncommitment or some -- and he -- so I did. I wrote a letter to Otmar and I said, \u201c\u201cOtmar, I\nwant you -- want to know, you know -- I -- I really ha -- what is the situation?\u201d And I got a\nletter back and I\u2019m -- again one of these letters, you know, with a lot of prevarications\n[indecipherable]. Is that the right word? You know, with -- with a lot of not saying one thing\nand not saying yes and not saying no and not -- you know, what he -- what either way he\nwas, you know? Not being able to make his mind up about anything, so -- and it was a\nterrible loss, because he was a psychiatrist and he wouldn\u2019t join any group in Holland. I kept\nthinking, you know, he should join a group and be a part of something, but he\u2019s never done\nthat in all his life. He -- he is now 80 some years old. He\u2019s never, during all his working life,\njoined up with anything. He always was working alone. He always did this and did that. He\nnever made up his mind about anything and [indecipherable]. And I -- I saw him -- when\nMarty and I went to Holland, we went for -- on sabbatical. We were in Holland for a year, in\n1960. We already had all the kids. The youngest one was seven months. And he came for\ndinner, he -- Otmar did, in -- in the Hague. He lives in Amsterdam and we were in the\nHague. And he came for dinner and he said to me, he said, \u201cI should have left Europe long\nago. I should have gone with you. I should have -- you know, I should have made changes\nand this and that,\u201d he said he just couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t do it, [inaudible]. So, you\nknow, he never really changed. And he married somebody who could not have a -- children.\nShe had one son and she had some kind of disease, she couldn\u2019t have another.",
        "Q: You mentioned that in the other [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. So, and he\u2019s not had an easy life, because she\u2019s been very sick all the time with\nthat disease, you know, that she had right from the beginning. And he became something I\ndid not really like very much. And I -- I said to myself, you know, \u201cOh, what luck, what\nluck. Oh, was I lucky.\u201d You know?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think it was luck.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think it was luck.",
        "A: Probably not.",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: But, I mean, I must have had some kind of insight. Well, I don\u2019t know, I was so in love,\nwhat kind of insight can you have when you\u2019re so in love? But I just knowed it wasn\u2019t good\nfor me.",
        "Q: Yeah. Ca-Can you -- this may be very difficult, but can you distinguish the attachment\nthat you had to Ot-Otmar? And we don\u2019t have to go into this either. Can you distinguish the\nattachment -- you have the personal attachment and how it may have been clouded by the\ngeneral excitement that you had about the war being over?",
        "A: Huh. Good question. Well. Huh. No, I think that -- that -- I think there\u2019s a whole other\nangle to this. Otmar was German and my father had always adored everything German and\nhe always spoke about the good Germany, you know, when the things went wrong, he kept\nsaying, the humanistic tradition and how he was raised and everything he knew was from\nGermany and that all the good things that he was came out of Germany and, you know, that\nyou always have to choose -- my father said, with what you pick up from any kind of\ncivilization. And that if you pick the good things, you\u2019re very lucky, you know, if you can\nhave a peaceful life, which he didn\u2019t, of course. And Otmar was the good things in\nGermany. And he was German and somewhere in my background, there was this belief that\nGermany was the best. That the good things of Germany were better than anything --\nanything or anyone else in the -- any -- anywhere. That must have been in my li -- in my\nhead. And that must have been this -- that gave me this enormous, you know, attraction.\nBecause there were many things about Otmar that were very bad. I mean, first of all, I think\nthat basically he was a little anti-Semitic, here and there. [indecipherable]. And -- and he\nwould never believe that, but I -- I -- it wasn\u2019t that obvious, 1t came out 1-1n various things,\nyou know? The person he worked for, in the beginning, after the war, who really helped him\nlike crazy, [indecipherable] the boss, who really let him work for -- in his practice, and who\ngave him a chance to get established in Holland -- in Amsterdam and -- and the remarks\nabout Coon were not nice. They might have been partly right, but they weren\u2019t nice, because\nthey were based on being Jewish rather than on being the person that he was.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know? And that\u2019s not the way to judge anybody. And I -- that sort of worried me. I\nmust say that that kind of sort of worried me, because I knew Coon very well and I knew all\nhis good things, especially his wife, with whom I\u2019m still very friendly. And -- and very\nattached to, actually, Magda. And it just --",
        "Q: She still lives in Amsterdam?",
        "A: She still lives in Amsterdam. And that worried me, it worried me. I thought if -- if -- he\nalso -- I think he had a hard time taking me to see his family. Now, at the time, of course, it\nwas right after the war, he couldn\u2019t have gone anyway, to Germany. He was a deserter. His\nfamily, you know, his family was good and would have accept y -- anything and was happy\nthat he was alive and there and all that. His family wasn\u2019t like that at all -- was not Fascist or\nin any way. But -- but I don\u2019t know, deserting is another thing. And coming with a Jewish\nwife, to Germany after the war, eh. All that worried me. I thought, a life, a whole life and a\nchild, maybe that was half Jewish? These things have changed. I mean, the next generation,\nit would have been all right. As a matter of fact, I think 1t would have been a star in his -- in\nhis crown. But the first generation, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: And maybe it worried him more than it would have worried his people, you know? But\nhe was already insecure from -- from what he -- what he himself had done. He couldn\u2019t go\nback to Germany for many years after the war. I don\u2019t know when the first time was that he\ndid go back to Germany. Anyway, so as I say, it was -- it was not what you were saying --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- but it was more Otmar himself that --",
        "Q: Okay, so when [indecipherable] say he wrote the --",
        "A: -- that worried me --",
        "Q: -- he wrote the letter and he sent a vague --",
        "A: Who sent --",
        "Q: -- a vague response?",
        "A: -- th-th -- again the vague response and that\u2019s when I said to myself, \u201cIt is no.\u201d",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I -- [have to go on. I mean, now I am 24. I\u2019m -- you know, you get, you can\u2019t -- you --\nyou -- or 24 yeah, was 24. So I looked in the paper and I looked for a job that was going to\ntake me out of New York. And there was a job, with a cosmetic company, who was\ndemonstrating -- wi -- who needed demonstrators and who was going to train in New York,\nand then sent you out. And that seemed like the perfect solution. They were paying during\ntraining, enough for me to eat and to pay my rent. And they were going to pay a lot then,\nplus percentage, after you were trained. And that\u2019s what I did. I -- I went to work for this\ncompany -- cosmetic company, who isn\u2019t -- which name I have forgotten. And they were\nselling creams for your hair and -- and lotions and brushes and combs -- with particular\ncircular brushes and combs, which was new then. And I had the perfect hair for it. And I\ncould speak -- I had an accent, m-more than now.",
        "Q: Did you have long hair?",
        "A: No, like this.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But it -- my accent was an advantage, because people were going to listen to this accent.\nSo, I had to -- di -- di -- you got a lamp, you know the company would get a lamp that was\nfocused on you and you would give a speech about the combs and the brushes and the hair\nand answer questions and stuff. And the first place they sent us, because they sent two\nwomen together, always. After the training -- I trained all over New York. I was at\nGimbel\u2019s, I was at Macy\u2019s, I was at something Strauss -- Abraham Strauss, was it?",
        "Q: Yeah, Abraham and Strauss.",
        "A: Yeah, and I was at another one and I was in Brooklyn, was the first time I ever made --\nset foot in Brooklyn and I was all over New York. And then they send us and the first place\nthey sent us was Baltimore, and we were a huge success. I mean, I sold enormous amount of\ncomb -- and because we were a success, we stayed and stayed. And I got to know the buyer\nof the department, who was a Jewish fellow and I -- and he was very nice. He said, \u201cYou\nknow, you were here so long, you really should be doing something with your evening,\nsomething useful. And aren\u2019t you lonely?\u201d And I was, because she was a gal who\ndisappeared after work. And she had no interests that I had. And so he took me, one time,\nfor lunch. He wasn\u2019t allowed to fraternize, you know, anything. But he took me to a place\nthat during the day was a small restaurant where they -- very small, they don\u2019t have small\nplaces like that, hardly, any more, where they made sandwiches and stuff. And at night, the\nstudents from the various universities in Baltimore would come and play chess and he had\nsome music and once in awhile he had somebody to talk and stuff. And my hotel was not\ntoo far from there. I could walk it and I could go there. And I met some people from the\nvarious universities. And I met some people who were in the acting sections and stuff and\nthey said, \u201cGee, it would be nice, you know, why don\u2019t you come and try out?\u201d And I said,\n\u201cT can\u2019t, because I won\u2019t be here long enough.\u201d Well, after six weeks, they sent us to\nCincinnati. And we get to Cincinnati and she of course, 1s gone at night and I decided\nmaybe I should see something of Cincinnati and stuff and there was a fellow in the\ndepartment, who said he knew some people. Well, it turned out to be German -- ex -- ex-\nGermans -- immigrants and they took me to a beerholla -- a beer hall and stuff and I -- I\nhated it, I couldn\u2019t tell you how I hated it. You know, they were all locking arms and\nsinging, ah, la la la la, you know, and these beer songs and I thought, \u201cThat I need? I don\u2019t\nneed that,\u201d you know? I mean, I could have gone back to Germany and had that -- the real\nthing, it wouldn\u2019t be as obnoxious as this. So I telegraphed the guy in Baltimore and I said --\nhe had said, \u201cIf you want a job, let me know.\u201d This -- the buyer at the company. And I said,\n\u201cTs there still a job? Do you still have a job and if so, could you let me know?\u201d And he --\ntelegraphed back, \u201cJob available, arranged for you to come and you can stay with so and\nso.\u201d A woman in the department who was just divorced or something, has lots of room and\njust come. And I came. That\u2019s how I got to Baltimore, of all places, you know. And --",
        "Q: Was that where you met ra -- Martin?",
        "A: Well, I did, because these people from the university, of course they saw me again and\nthey said, \u201cCome and try out for a play.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m a real actress, I\u2019m a -- I was a\nprofessional, I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d And they started explaining to me about amateur\ntheater in -- in the United States and come on. And -- and I said, \u201cAnd my terrible accent,\u201d\nand they said, \u201cOh well, you know, we\u2019ll find parts that are just right.\u201d So I went and I tried\nout for Moli\u00e9re\u2019s \u201cSchool for Wives.\u201d \u201cSchool for Wives.\u201d It had a wonderful director and\nhe didn\u2019t take me, because of my accent. He said, \u201cThey\u2019re going to listen hard to try to\nunderstand you and they won\u2019t hear the play.\u201d And it\u2019s like a Broadway thing, had it just\nbeen a Broadway thing, because the girl that he did choose did -- got sick, couldn\u2019t make it -\n- he didn\u2019t want to have -- he was mid -- in the middle of rehearsals, he didn\u2019t want to have\nanother audition. He called me and said, \u201cIll get somebody, the Hopkins Department of\nLinguistics has said they would help me, come and do the play with us.\u201d And I did. And\nthat\u2019s where I met a lot of people I liked, you know. And all my age and -- and it was just\ngreat. I was just a little older than they.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one question, just about your frame of mind at that point. Was there --\ncould you -- could you perceive a difference in your state of mind and your ambitions,\nbased on the fact that you had been through the experiences in Europe that you had been\nthrough and the Americans that you were with had not?",
        "A: Yes. Oh, yes. The answer is yes. And it was the first time there that I had -- when I\nstarted meeting me -- boys, you know? That\u2019s when I thought, \u201cThis 1s impossible. I can\nnever marry an American. Never.\u201d",
        "Q: Can you el-elaborate on it? What were you --",
        "A: Yes, because the people -- it so happened that a couple of the -- the -- the fellows I met,\nhad been just on the cusp, you know, of the -- of the age that did -- didn\u2019t go into the war.\nYou know, weren\u2019t old enough to be drafted or to get into the war. And those were the --\nmy first acquaintances. Fraternity kind of fellows. And I used to laugh. They would wait for\nme outside my apartment, when I came back from work. And I would see them standing\nthere and I would laugh, I would laugh. This is ridiculous. I mean, I\u2019m a woman -- I\u2019m a\nwoman and I am a grown-up, I\u2019ve -- you know, these are so innocent. They\u2019re so damn\ninnocent. It\u2019s impossible. I can never, never, never get together with them. I could never\nfind a level on which we could talk together as equals. I don\u2019t mean intellectually, but even\nthat -- I mean, you know, they -- they had no idea about anything. About arts or anything\nabout theater -- about the war they had completely wrong notions, just completely wrong. I\nhad to explain everything. You know, it just didn\u2019t work, no, it didn\u2019t work. And that was,\nof course, also Baltimore because in New York it was a little better, although there I didn\u2019t\ndate very much either. But it just -- 1-it was just so -- they were so childish.",
        "Q: And how would you characterize the general American --",
        "A: Th-The males -- the males in Baltimore, the ones that I met -- and I wanted to meet -- I\ndidn\u2019t care whom I met, you know, whether were Jewish or not Jewish.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They were just too -- too childish, too -- too immature. They -- I mean they were just out\nof rah-rah high school and college, you know? Football kind of guys. Even though I met\nsome very intellectual. I met Russ Baker. I met, you know, I met -- you know, the people\nwho were the same age -- actually, he went to school with Marty. He was very nice. He was\ncertainly an intellectual. But he wasn\u2019t -- had never been allowed to really show it. Cause\nthe girls wouldn\u2019t take it.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: You know? It took him awhile. And he actually had a girl. He was between, you know,\nhaving broken up with her and coming -- going back to her when -- when I dated. We didn\u2019t\nreally date many times, a couple times. But -- but it really was -- he was very nice, he was\nthe best of them.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the writer, Russell Baker, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It -- it - it\u2019s just -- I just -- I met him, you know, Marty and I, when Marty got his Nobel,\nwe -- we met him several times. And I said, \u201cDo you know that you and I had a couple of\ndates?\u201d He couldn\u2019t remember and -- and I could remember, because he was -- you know, I\nhad been following his -- his writing. And it -- 1t ma -- left no special impression, except he\nwas a bit more, you know, when he knew he could re --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nBarbara Rodbell. This is tape number three, side B.",
        "A: He couldn\u2019t remember and -- and I could remember, because he was -- you know, I had\nbeen following his -- his writing. And it -- it ma -- left no special impression, except he was\na bit more, you know, when he knew he could relax and actually talk about something.\nSomething more than football or baseball, which he had no interest in. And the-then -- you\nknow, he -- he relaxed.",
        "Q: And how did -- how did Americans in general, who now felt like they had been -- you\nknow, they had helped win the war and liberate everybody. How did they treat people like\nyou?",
        "A: They -- they were good from that point of view. They -- they were -- they were good\nfrom that point of view. You know, the boys didn\u2019t want to talk about the war. That was --\nthat was -- that was really one of the things. Well, I didn\u2019t meet that many, you know, that --\nthat I could really -- that\u2019s why the circus was interesting, because they were Europeans.\nThere were some Arabs, North African. There were -- there were various Germans, quite a\nfew Germans. There were, you know, people who had really been through things, that it\nwas, in a way, a bit of home, you know? I felt more, like belonging and -- and we were all\nsort of footloose and fancy free in a strange country. That gave me a feeling of home and\ncomfort in the circus. But American boys, no. I mean your average -- your average\nAmerican boy, it was just impossible. Now, what happened was, was that the one fellow\nthat I -- I got to know quite well, after awhile, he had to go to -- to bloom -- to go for his\ngraduate school. And he told Marty -- he had taken Marty to see me at \u201cSchool for Wives.\u201d\nAnd Marty had a girlfriend then and you know, there was no reason for us to get together.\nAnd -- but when he left -- when this Danny left, to go to Bloomington for his grad school,\nhe told Marty to come and see me. You know, check up on me once in awhile, til he was\ngoing to come back Christmas, or he was going to come back Easter. But -- but Marty\nshould go and see me. So Marty came to see me and I was deathly sick. He\u2019s always telling\nthis story and I'll tell it very fast. He -- Marty -- there was a knock on my door and Marty\ncame in and I was so sick I couldn\u2019t get up. And he couldn\u2019t believe it. I had a nice place, in\na brownstone on Charles Street, near Mount Vernon Place in ba -- in Baltimore. And Marty\ntook one look at me and touched my head, knew I had a fever and he went home to his mom\nand he said -- there was nothing in my refrigerator, he looked in the refrigerator and there\nwas nothing there. So he went home and said to his mom, \u201cI need food. I need a pot of --\u201d\nAnd ma -- his mom had a pot of chicken soup. So he took some of it. His -- his parents had\na grocery store. So he took so-some food from the store and he took some what his mom\nhad and he came back and he fed me. And from then on, you know, I was his -- his -- what\ndo you call it? His --",
        "Q: Patient?",
        "A: Patient, yeah, sort of. And he kept coming back and -- and making sure, you know, that I\nhave food and that -- that ge -- I mean, I couldn\u2019t move, I was so sick. You know, I was -- of\ncourse I had something from the war. I mean -- for instance, when I had my first child, my\ngums just erupted, I had -- they -- they ended up painting them purple, because you know, I\ndidn\u2019t have any vitamins, you know, nothing during my last growing spurt. You know,\nbetween 16 and 18 you cans still grow. You know, I had no food. So there was something,\nyou know, innately wrong with me. So, I wasn\u2019t quite as strong to resist some of the bugs\nthat were going around and Marty had a friend, Helmut Sonenfeld, whose parents had both\ncome from Germany, they were both doctors. And when they got to Baltimore, they placed\nthemselves -- they went, bought a big house in a black neighborhood and they treated the\npoor. They said, \u201cWe survived, we have to do something back.\u201d",
        "Q: And who were these people?",
        "A: Their name was Sonenfeld and they were two doctors from Germany. They had two\nsons. One of them was Helmut, who ended up as the sidekick of Kissinger, especially --\nwell, that\u2019s -- Marty knew him from -- I think from Hopkins, but maybe even before that.\nHelmut, you know, is a rush -- a specialist in Russia, an expert and still very important. I\nthink he teaches at the school of international something or other in -- in Baltimore. And\nHelmut -- Marty called Helmut and said, \u201cI have this German girl who -- or Dutch girl who\ndoesn\u2019t have a cent and who 1s deathly ill. Would you ask your parents?\u201d And they said,\n\u201cYes, bring her.\u201d\u2019 And so these parents, I mean they did everything. They -- they checked\nme over, they knew that I nearly had pneumonia, you know. They got the medication, they\nbought it, they -- they really babied me. They really took care of me. And I didn\u2019t like\nHelmut. Helmut and I didn\u2019t get along. I -- I never did get along with anybody from over\nthere. When I first came to -- to New York, the friends of my parents, they had heard from\nthe Kalinoffsky\u2019s that I was there, they got all their sons, you know, to come, because the\ndaughter of Dr. Leiderman, you know, I mean, it should be terrific and stuff. And so I got\ninvited to these fancy houses, all around New -- New York City and out in the -- out in the\ncountry, you know, Larchmont and all those lovely areas. Connecticut, upper Conne --\nlower Connecticut and stuff and it was awful. There were all these fancy things. Boys --\nyoung men, who had been in the United States forever, as far as I\u2019m concerned and who\nspoke with an accent thicker than mine. I mean, it was just horrible. I mean, I said to myself,\nif I have to live in the United States, I\u2019m going to marry an Americ -- marry and American.\nAnd one of the big shocks, when I finally got into this Hopkins group, was the split between\nthe Russian Polish group and the German group. Now, I naturally should have belonged to\nthe German group, but I despised what they were standing for. It was so horrible. After all\nthe things we had gone through as Jews -- of course, they didn\u2019t go through anything, but I -\n- you know, I was not going to make -- I knew that it didn\u2019t help you to make a difference\nbetween Jews. I mean, you were a human being, you were a Jew, you were a German Jew\nand you were a snob? I can\u2019t tell you what kind of expression I would like to use, but it\u2019s a\nbad one. I was very angry at those Phi Ebs, which was the Jewish fraternity -- the German\nJewish fraternity and the other ones, which Marty belonged to. His parents -- you know, I\nmean it was just awful, I despi -- and I got telephone calls. I got calls saying, \u201cWhat are you\ndoing, going out with those people?\u201d",
        "Q: With what people?",
        "A: With the -- with the Polish Russian group of Jews.",
        "Q: Oh, the Germans were calling you?",
        "A: Yeah. They were -- they were calling. And Marty doesn\u2019t believe me, but that\u2019s what I\ngot. And I couldn\u2019t stand it -- and I couldn\u2019t stand it and I went out with one boy who was --\nhe was an architect and he had left that group for a long time and he was German Jewish\nand -- and he -- I was very fond of him, but he was highly neurotic and everything. And he\ntook me to see his parents. And I had dinner there and I could see these parents, they didn\u2019t\nlike it. I mean, I didn\u2019t have any money. And that\u2019s what they were after, even though they\nwere [indecipherable], they were very rich. You know, but it was the idea that class came\nnot from you, as a person, but class came out of your pocketbook.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, and I had to laugh, because all their parents and grandparents had been\ngrocers and -- and whatever they were, you know, which I didn\u2019t give a hoot what they\nwere, I only cared what kind of person they were. And here my parents, you know, came fr -\n- I mean, I felt like I was much better than they were and -- and they were saying, \u201cWell,\nyou haven\u2019t got a --\u201d Well, at the moment I didn\u2019t have any money. And s -- it was lucky. It\nwas lucky. I was just lucky. Because I decided I was going to go with something strong and\nthe Polish Russian ones were the strong ones. And when -- when Marty came and we started\ngoing out and we were very careful, because this was -- this friend of his was his best friend,\nDanny, who went to Bloomington. And hi -- I guess Marty had dated several of ma -- of\nDanny\u2019s ex-girlfriends and Danny wasn\u2019t happy about it and he was very careful not -- and I\nwas very careful. Course, I didn\u2019t want any trouble, you know, in anything. So finally\nDanny called and said he couldn\u2019t come home Easter, because he had to take care of his\ndrizoffulla flies, which is a -- for his research. He says, \u201cI can\u2019t let my flies die.\u201d",
        "Q: Fr-Fruit -- fruit flies, right?",
        "A: Yes. Marty came over that day and he said he\u2019d had a note from Danny saying he was --\nand I had had the same letter. And he said, \u201cYou know, Barbara, that\u2019s just too bad for\nDanny.\u201d We were going out for three months. All we did was ever hold hands, vaguely.\nAnd I felt like such a child, I thought. But Marty, you see, had been in the war. Marty had\nbeen in the Pacific. He\u2019d lived over -- he\u2019d lived in China for eight months. He had seen\ndifferent people, he had been together -- thrown together with all these people, which Danny\nhadn\u2019t and other people that I went out with, didn\u2019t have. And Marty was much more\nmature. Much more mature. And he was a couple of years older than -- than most of the\nothers, because he\u2019d been in the war for two and half, three years, you know\u201d? So he was not\nso childish.",
        "Q: Was he o-older than you?",
        "A: No. I\u2019m 0 -- three months older than him.",
        "Q: Oh, so you\u2019re the same.",
        "A: We were exactly the same. And -- but -- but he was older than these guys I happened to\nhave met, you know? And he was -- having been in different surroundings, having seen the\nsuffering -- the Chinese were suffering like crazy when he was there. And having seen\nhunger and having seen all that, you know, he -- he was much more mature -- much more\nmature. And he had interests, and he was interested in a mature way, in what I wanted to do.\nAnd sport was okay, but it wasn\u2019t anything that interested him very much. And so we -- we\nreally -- you know, we had the same political outlook. We had, for instance, I lost a\nboyfriend in New York, when we -- I first was in New York, because he voted for Dewey,\nyou know? I mean, I could not see even voting for Dewey, I\u2019d -- oh, let\u2019s say voting not for\nRoosevelt party. So I sent him away, I sa -- and this was a good deal, this guy. But the\npolitics were important to me. After living in Europe, you know and -- and -- and seeing the\nthings that happened in Europe because people did not care, the intellectuals did not care\nabout politics and did not -- they thought it was below them, you know? So -- so Is -- I\nthought, people have to care about politics.",
        "Q: Now, just so I understand, are you -- are you s-saying or suggesting that part of the\nproblem in Europe escalated because people were not involved?",
        "A: What do you mean? Not invo --",
        "Q: Part of the -- part of the -- of the Holocaust happening was because -- because the\nintellectuals were not involved?",
        "A: Yes, oh yes. I think that in the beginning, even Germans who were good -- really great\npeople, good people, they did not involve themselves. Well, you didn\u2019t talk about politics,\nthat was for -- I don\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t classy. It just wasn\u2019t done. You know, I mean intellectuals\ncared about intellectual things and politics was not intellectual.",
        "Q: You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s funny, I\u2019ve never really had anybody say that to me before.",
        "A: Well, maybe I\u2019m wrong, but -- but this is my impression.",
        "Q: No, I think you\u2019re probably right.",
        "A: My father never talked about 1t. My group -- the whole group never talked about it. I\nknew about Hitler because I heard the maids talk. I heard my governess talk. I heard Maria,\nmy -- the -- the nurse talk. I heard the cook, the -- you know, I heard all these different\npeople talk about Hitler in the house, when my parents weren\u2019t around. Because I remember\ntaking a walk, I was six years old, we were out in the country. We\u2019d had whooping cough\nand -- and it was terrible, there was nothing to be done about whooping cough. And so they\ntook us out of Berlin, into the country, into the clean air and we lived at -- on a farm for\nabout two months, because my sister and I both had -- my sister was very ill, I wasn\u2019t so\nterribly ill. And that\u2019s where I heard everybody talk. All these people were with us. And I\nheard them talk. And I remember taking a walk with my father and they were talking about\nelections coming up and I said, \u201cI know,\u201d I was ru -- jumping around. \u201cI know who you\u2019re\ngoing to vote for. You going to vote for Hitler.\u201d That was the only name I knew. I didn\u2019t\nknow any other name. And why I remember that, I think because my father must have\nshook me or something. But it stuck in my head, that I was so stupid. That I was -- was\nsaying that. I must have gotten punished for it or something. Or anyway, told not to -- my\nparents didn\u2019t tum -- punish. But they must have told me very definitely, that 1s not\nsomething -- you know, we talk about around -- you know, not to talk with the s -- help or\nsomething about puli -- politics or something. There was some reason I remember this\noccasion. This was when I was six. Anyway, I -- that\u2019s my -- my view of it. Yes, I think that\npeople didn\u2019t want to think about it. People who were, in any way, intellectual. And -- and\ndidn\u2019t have to be involved in politics, you know, it was a profession -- it was a profession.",
        "Q: So this -- so this then affected your involvement with things? I -- I mean what was your -\n- what became your involvement with politics here?",
        "A: Well, th -- be -- I was not involved in anything. I never was involved in anything. I\u2019m a\nmember of the democratic party now. I don\u2019t think I was until we got here, you know? But I\nvoted democratic.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] When -- when -- when did you come to North Carolina?",
        "A: In \u201885, yeah. And then -- and here there were some people who -- you know, I didn\u2019t\nhave the kids to -- or anything to -- to think about and so I started to sort of reach out and\nfind a few new things that I was interested in and somebody came to the door, actually and\nasked, you know, what our -- well, we had to register to vote and I\u2019ve always voted. There\nhasn\u2019t been a time that I didn\u2019t vote. When we were in Holland, I used to go to Rotterdam to\nvote, with the, you know, your absentee ballots and when we were in Switzerland we voted\nabsentee ballots, you know. We -- we always -- I always voted. And when Marty gets\ndisgusted -- and he does, nowadays -- get disgusted with, you know, always voting against\nsomething, rather than for something, I say it doesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t vote at all, it\u2019s for\nit, rather than against it and it\u2019s better to vote again -- you know, it just -- you have to vote --\nyou have to vote, it\u2019s so in me. I can\u2019t -- I -- I -- the kids -- \u201cYou\u2019ve got to vote. You don\u2019t\nvote, I don\u2019t vote, I don\u2019t talk to you.\u201d I mean all four of them. \u201cYou -- you vote. You\u2019re --\u201d",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about the children for a little while.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Are we fin -- is 1t okay? Can we [indecipherable]?",
        "A: Yes, oh yeah.",
        "Q: Good. So, first tell -- tell me their names.",
        "A: Well, you know, we had children all over this country because Marty and I got married\nin Baltimore and we immediately went to Seattle, the next day. We -- we took off for\nSeattle, where he was going to be working on his Ph.D. He asked me to marry him -- he\ncame out to Long Island because I was there to do a show. I was doing -- dancing and acting\nin a show that was playing out on Long Island. And he came there and he said, \u201cDo you\nwant to marry me?\u201d And I had just gotten the first agent interested in me and my partner,\nwho was a girl -- we were -- she had very black hair, she reminded me of my sister, you\nknow? Very black hair, white skin. And I had blonde hair and blue eyes and we were a good\ncouple and we danced together very well. And he wanted us as a couple, you know, to\ndance. And Marty came and asked, \u201cDo you want to get -- marry me?\u201d And I said -- I\nthought to myself, I\u2019m 23, you know -- I\u2019m 24. Yeah, I was 24. I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and --",
        "Q: Right away?",
        "A: And we married -- three or four marries -- I went -- we went back to Baltimore after the\nshow --",
        "Q: Did you say re -- yes, right there on the spot?",
        "A: I said yes on the spot. I's -- I thought to myself, \u201cYou know, you can think about this and\nyou can think about this and --\u201d you know, I wanted -- I was sure of one thing, I wanted\nsomebody that I was starting with. I didn\u2019t want anybody who was already -- had a lot of\nmoney, that I would have had to say thank you to. I didn\u2019t want somebody who was a lot\nolder, because I had a boyfriend there in -- in Baltimore that I was very fond of, but he was\na finished person. He was already 41 or 40 or something and I was 25. So I -- and that was\nthe same as my parents, 15 years different, and I said to myself, that\u2019s not good. So here was\nthe perfect thing, I mean he was -- he was starting on his graduate school, so I would have to\nwork, we would start this thing together. And I liked him. But, you know, it wasn\u2019t what --\nthis overwhelming feeling that I had had with Otmar or anything. But, I thought, he\u2019s the\nbest guy. I could -- you know, I liked him very much and he -- so I said yes. I said, \u201cYes,\nthat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d So when I got back to Baltimore, I went to a shorthand and\ntyping st -- school, to do shorthand and typing, because I knew I had to go to work. I\ncouldn\u2019t count on acting or dancing or -- and it\u2019s exactly what happened. I got a job before\nhe got a job and we went to Seattle and we were -- we were there, he did very well and --\nand we -- we were there for about three years. It took four years to get your Ph.D. in those\ndays, takes longer now. And that was the ideal circumstance and -- and that was four years.\nSo I worked for three years or even longer. I worked up to the day that Paul was born. And\nwe had nothing -- we had very, very little money and we were happy as clams because we\nlived in a community of students, and -- and who were all pregnant with -- five of us\npregnant at the same time. And Marty was doing tests to see if he could figure out whether\nwe were g-going to have boys or girls.",
        "Q: What kind of tests?",
        "A: Well, they thought there was -- he -- at the time they thou -- now, they have, of course,\ngreat things, you know, but -- but at the time they thought maybe a saliva -- you know, a\nurine or something. We all did the tests and the only one that was right was mine. So the test\nwas not a good, de-definitive test. So, anyway, I had Paul in Seattle.",
        "Q: In what year?",
        "A: \u201853. And I had done a lot of acting in Seattle. There was the theater at the university, the\n-- the -- our own theater, we started a theater of our own. And we had -- I mean I did a lot of\nacting, next to my full time job, which was downtown in a bank. And okay, in -- so that was\n\u00b053. In \u201854 Marty graduated and we moved to Urbana, Illinois for two years and that\u2019s\nwhere I had Susie. I did a lot of acting in Urbana. Acting and dancing.",
        "Q: She was born in \u201855?",
        "A: She was born in \u201854.",
        "Q: *54.",
        "A: Well, December 30th. I mean, you know, just about -- hanging on. Good tax deduction,\nshe was. And then in -- the next one -- Andy was born -- oh yeah, in \u201856 we moved to\nBethesda. We lived in Silver Spring, actually, but that\u2019s when he went to NIH. He was at\nNIH for -- we went to NIH and that\u2019s where he stayed. So Andy was born in \u201857 and Philip\nwas born in \u201859, December \u201859. And that was our house, that was it. And then in -- in \u201860,\nwe went to Holland for a year, on sabbatical. And that\u2019s -- you know, that was terrific, I\nmean that --",
        "Q: Well -- okay, now what -- well, tell me about that, I have something -- there\u2019s one thing\nwe forgot -- I forgot to ask you, but tell me about going to Holland with the family.",
        "A: Okay, well, that was most amazing, because --",
        "Q: Was that your first time back?",
        "A: That was my first time back, so that was what -- I -- I left in -- in \u201847, November and I\ngot back in \u201860, I guess July or August it was. July, maybe. And my Uncle Huntz, my\nmother\u2019s youngest brother, who had gone to Israel after the war -- he also has a great story.\nAnyway he we -- he ended up as ambassador from Israel to Holland, cause he was Dutch\noriginally, you know? So he spoke Dutch, so they sent him to Holland. And he was there in\n1960, when we came, in -- as ambassador, with my Aunt Ruth and his daughter -- their\ndaughter Alliane and of course, they had other kids, but they stayed in Israel. And so it was\ngreat. They had gotten a house for us and we looked at the house and it was dark and\nmiserable. So we looked further and we found a wonderful house on the ocean. Many dunes\nin front of it -- I mean you\u2019re not right on the ocean, you can\u2019t see the water, but it\u2019s the\nnearest thing you can get to -- to the water. And we brought a girl from -- from America to\ntake -- help take care -- a young girl, six -- 16 - 17, who\u2019ll take care of the kids. And then we\n-- we hired somebody to cook and to -- to clean, because I wanted to do photography. My\nUncle Paul is still alive, he\u2019s a painter.",
        "Q: What kind of photography were you doing?",
        "A: I was doing portraiture, landscapes, things like that.",
        "Q: And what -- were you selling -- were you selling them?",
        "A: I was -- I was selling them, but not in Holland -- not while I was in Holland. I was just\nworking with people in Holland and I found wonderful people to work with right near us. I\ncouldn\u2019t go back to Maria Austria, who -- who had been my teacher, because that was in\nAmsterdam, but near the Hague, there was a friend, Veekmon was her name and I worked\nwith her. And it was -- and I had a dark room in the house. It -- it was fantastic. I worked\nvery hard. I finally got to -- he really -- and my Uncle Pa -- 1t was a wonderful -- 1t was a\nfantastic year. What happened was that Marty really was in Brussels that year, for six -- for\nsix months and we -- we were going to be in Brussels and my family then, Heinz and Ava\nsaid, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, you know, you\u2019re going to be in bru -- in Europe for the first time\nwith all your kids, we want to see your kids, you know. Don\u2019t go to Brussels.\u201d You know,\nthen -- this too far. So, the house that we had was just two blocks from them and that was\nreally nice. I mean it was -- it was unbelievable to be back in Holland with my own kids. I\nshopped in the same stores for them. I took them to Amsterdam, of course -- we were in the\nHague. But I had known the Hague very well. Uncle Paul was in Vosinar, which is -- which\nis between the Hague and Amsterdam. I mean, it was -- for me it was one of the best years I\ncould ever remember. I mean, imagine I went to stores in Amsterdam, met some company\nwhere we used to shop and -- and there was -- an aunt of mine was sitting there, and -- was\nan aunt of my mother\u2019s really, was sitting there. \u201cBarbara,\u201d she says, \u201chow are you?\u201d I\nmean, this doesn\u2019t\u2019 happen to me in the States. I mean, it was just -- 1t was a wonderful year.\nI -- I ended up -- we -- you know, I had so much family that was still living there and many\nof them are dead. My uncle\u2019s dead, his wife is dead. You know, and etcetera. My cousins\nare alive. So I do go there and I visit with them.",
        "Q: And -- and did you meet th -- at that time, did you meet people that you had worked with\nin the underground?",
        "A: Yes, I met everybody, of course.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, I me -- we went to see Manfred and on -- the funniest thing was Marty, my\nhusband, because I had -- he had -- always wanted to hear stories about Europe and the\nunderground and this and that and I had been telling him these stories. And I guess he\nbelieved them, but you know, it was so colorful. I had -- I mean, my uncle who was a\npainter and who knew everybody in the art world. And the -- and -- and my -- my dancing\nbuddies and my -- and then, when we came to Holland, Marty had never been in Europe. He\nhad been 1n the Pacific in the war, but never in Europe. So this was his first time. He met all\nthese people and every bit of it was true. As a matter of fact, you know, he could flesh it out.\nIt was more colorful than he had ever thought, you know. He met my uncles and my -- my\ncousins and my f -- my family and my friends. All the underground people were then alive.\nHe met Coon and he met Magda and he met Maurecia Austria, the photographer that I used\nto work with, he met her husband, he was still there, that husband. And -- and he -- he met\nManfred and his cu -- then wife, Maria. And he met their chil -- I mean, it was just -- for\nhim it was like a picture gallery opening up.",
        "Q: Wh-What were Mar -- I forgot to ask you, where were Marty\u2019s family from? They were\nfrom Poland?",
        "A: Well, he -- they weren\u2019t --",
        "Q: Originally.",
        "A: -- they were all born here.",
        "Q: Yeah, but before that?",
        "A: But originally they were Polish, yes. His grandfather -- his grandfather was the one that,\ngran -- and grandmother. His grandmother was from Lithuania. His grandfather was from\nWarsaw. And they met in the United States, so already Marty\u2019s father was born in -- in\nBaltimore. And his mother actually was born when his family -- when her family moved\nfrom Poland to -- to -- I guess it was the United States, but she was born in London, on the\nway. And she was three when she came to the United States. It was a funny thing because\nshe never got the American citizenship. Because it was past the time that when you married\nan American, you would get American citizenship. And she never -- she said -- she always\nsaid -- you know, we asked her to come visit us in Europe. That\u2019s when all this came up.\nShe wasn\u2019t a citizen, she didn\u2019t have a passport. She says, \u201cI\u2019m as American as anybody.\u201d I\nmean, she\u2019d never been anywhere else. She was three years when she came. So she was\nvery proud of it and she would not take the test. She says, \u201cI don\u2019t have to take a test, I\u2019ve\nnever been anywhere.\u201d It was funny as heck. She -- you know, she\u2019s -- although she\u2019d never\nbeen in a -- in Poland, she was -- she had all the sort of behavior, you know, that -- that\ncomes from the east. You know, th-the kind of bit of superstition and -- and nothing bad,\nyou know, just -- just the kind of thing. She cooked like a whiz. You know, and it tasted\nbetter than anything I\u2019d ever eaten. You know, she -- she -- I don\u2019t know what she did,\nprobably chicken fat we -- we think now. But it was wonderful. And her baking, it was\nheaven. So -- so -- so as I say, she came when she was three. So his parents really, you\nknow, were Americans. They had been born and raised here.",
        "Q: He says something, let me find it [indecipherable] little --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nBarbara Rodbell. This is tape number four, side A.",
        "A: -- tasted better than anything I\u2019d ever eaten. You know, she -- she -- I don\u2019t know what\nshe did, probably chicken fat we -- we think now. But it was wonderful. And her baking, it\nwas heaven. So -- so -- so as I say, she came when she was three. So his parents really, you\nknow, were Americans. They had been born and raised here.",
        "Q: He says something, let me find it [indecipherable] little article that he wrote. I just\nwanted to ask you about it. What did I do with it? It was just an interesting -- well, one thing\nthat he w -- that he acknowledges -- there\u2019s something about your relationship to -- about\nhis re -- his -- his involvement with European culture.",
        "A: Well, you know, he got very friendly with my Uncle Paul. And Uncle Paul would take\nhim places, I couldn\u2019t always get away and he would take him places, so he met a lot of\nPaul\u2019s buddies -- you know, his painting buddies and his co -- his other buddies. People\nwere alive then, who were older than my Uncle Paul, you know, and who -- who are real\nclassics, now -- whole groups of Dutch painters. And --",
        "Q: Oh yeah, here it is, he says, \u201cThe -- the year in Belgium and Holland, however, proved to\nbe most important because of the cultural impact of European civilization on my life. I have\nbeen wedded to Europe since then.",
        "A: Well, it was -- 1t was because of all the -- he finally saw it all and took it in, you know?\nWe traveled. We -- we -- because we had help with the children, so we could travel and we\ntook a big trip. We drove, you know, around and we -- we went south. We actually drove to\nVenice and took a boat to Israel.",
        "Q: Israel?",
        "A: Yeah, because my Uncle Huntz, you know, he -- he was -- wait a mi -- was that in \u201861? I\nthink it was \u201861. Huntz was back. Why was Huntz back? I think it was \u201861? Or was that in\n\u201867? We were in Geneva twice and I da -- I can\u2019t keep it quite apart from each other. I think\nit was \u201861. Now, why would Huntz be in Israel in \u201861?",
        "Q: This is Huntz or Heinz?",
        "A: Huntz -- Huntz. My mother\u2019s family.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Huntz -- si -- cr -- Hanan Cidor -- he\u2019s in -- in Israel he changed his name from Huntz to\nHanan, which is spelled H-a-n-a-n, Hanan. And s -- and he -- from Zeetroon, citron, from\nZeetroon, he changed it to Cidor, C-i-d-o-r.",
        "Q: C-1-d-o-r, oh.",
        "A: d-o-r. That means nothing. That -- that\u2019s just a name, Cidor.",
        "Q: Okay. And what -- what was the purpose of the change?",
        "A: Well, he worked for the government and you should have an Israeli name. It wasn\u2019t just\nthat he worked for the government, he wanted to have an Israeli name.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that\u2019s what he did. So he changed it -- of course, again, he was not religious, but I\nremember when we were in Holland in \u201860 or \u201861, he -- we -- the first boy born after the war\nin the Jewish community, was Bar Mitzvahed at 13 and this boy was Harry -- Harry\nZeetroon. So in my family, the Zeetroon family. And Huntz -- Hanan Cidor, who was the\nambassador from Israel to the Netherlands did the officiating at it. He wasn\u2019t the rabbi, but\nhe officiated at it, he was the representative of Israel, he was -- he wa -- he was the official\nmaven there. And that was quite an occasion. I mean, the first boy Bar Mitzvahed. And I\u2019m\nactually surprised, because what happened to my cousin Steven, who was born in \u201846, if I\u2019m\nright, what is that? \u201c46 and 13.",
        "Q: Would be \u201859.",
        "A: So -- \u201859 -- so he should have been Bar Mitzvahed, he must have been the first. This was\n\u201861. So I don\u2019t know what -- what the situation is. Maybe he wasn\u2019t Bar Mitzvahed,\nalthough I can\u2019t believe --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s possible that he wasn\u2019t Bar Mitzvahed.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: It was very interesting. And we went to it, of course, we were invited. And Hanan was\nnot at all religious and so was that whole government in the beginning, wasn\u2019t -- 1n Israel,\nwasn\u2019t religious.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, was nothing special, but he knew what to do, you know, he was ri -- I mean they\ntrained him to be representative of Israel. And so --",
        "Q: Hm. So -- so tell -- tell me about your children and about being a mother.",
        "A: Okay. Well, when I had Paul, that was my first one, that was in \u201853 and again, I had a\nbreakdown. I had Paul -- Paul was born in May. May sixth, 1953 and I had no trouble\ncarrying, I was very nauseous at the beginning and I got Vitamin B shots and then I had -- I\nwas member of group health of Pugeot Sound, which is still in existence and one of the\noldest of the group -- group health. It was a wonderful organization at the time, just terrific.\nAnd I had my baby in their hospital and it was very difficult, took a long time. He had the\ncord wrapped around his neck and stuff. But after I had him, the -- you know, how the first\nthree days, before your milk comes in and all that? I had a real breakdown, because I\nsuddenly started missing my mother and started thinking about my -- th-this was like a huge\nshock to me. I mean, there wasn\u2019t anybody who really cared, I thought. And there was\nnobody who cared about my baby, you know and me, that I had this child. It meant nothing\nto anybody, except myself and Marty. And I cried for three days and they -- they tried\neverything at that hospital. You know, they finally took me out of the room -- I was with\nfour -- three other people. This was very helpful, actually. They were all experienced\nmothers, I was the only first timer and they took me out and -- and they talked to me and\nsaid, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d And I remember that I said to them, \u201cNobody cares. I have this child,\nwhich is so special and my family --\u201d and my -- in my Dutch German family, this was\nsomething fantastic, when you had a child. I mean, it was rare, people didn\u2019t have so many\nchildren. Here, people had a lot of children, in my generation, they didn\u2019t have many\nchildren and -- and -- my mother\u2019s generation. And I -- you know, and I cried and cried,\nnobody cares and my mother and that was -- you know, I wanted my mo -- my parents in\nthe worst way. And -- and they said, \u201cBut you have a wonderful husband, I mean he\u2019s -- you\nknow, very -- he\u2019s everything anybody ever would want and -- and you know, he cares --\u201d\nand they tried everything, you know\u201d? But what -- 1t was a physical change as mu -- now I\nknow, it was a physical thing as much as a mental situation. And when the milk came in, I\nsettled down and by the time I went home -- in those days, you stayed five, six days in the\nhospital and by that time, Marty\u2019s mother and father had come. And that was very helpful. I\nwa --",
        "Q: How did they get there? I\u2019m just curious, did they fly?",
        "A: They drew -- they drove.",
        "Q: They drove? From Baltimore to Seattle?",
        "A: Baltimore, yes. They had -- they took -- a fa -- his father was retired then and they drove\nvery slowly across country, stayed in various places and then they -- me -- they\u2019ve had it\nfigured out just right. And they -- and she -- people said, \u201cWe asked, are the Rodbell\u2019s\nmoving? Because your mother-in-law emptied out this little house that we had and put\neverything out in the grass and cleaned the place.\u201d She was a fabulous cleaner, I never\ncaught up --",
        "Q: Your house?",
        "A: yes.",
        "Q: Your house?",
        "A: Yes, well, when you say house, you know it was -- th-the University of Washington had\n-- all the universities were packed after the war and they didn\u2019t have housing for their\nstudents and -- grad students or anybody, and -- not enough. And there was this influx of\nsoldiers, you know, re -- people who came back from the army and they -- we finally got a\nlittle house and this was -- the army -- the officers houses from the army. So these were\nshacks, you know, they were shacks and -- and we had a-an entrance that had a stove in It.\nNow, let\u2019s see -- gee, I guess it was already the real stove. It wasn\u2019t the barracks, it was a\nlittle house by itself. And it just had a living room, that had a kitchen along it -- a Pullman\ntype kitchen, you know? One bedroom, a small bathroom. I guess it had a shower, it surely\nhad no bath and -- and a closet. I think -- that was all it was. So that was -- and the furniture\nwe bought at the Goodwill, you know? But it was -- looked very nice. And all put together,\nyou know, different things. If I didn\u2019t like something, I put -- I bought a piece of cloth at the\nmaterials she -- at the shop and put it over it. You know, decorate it over. But she cleaned it\nall, you know, by the time I came home, that was spic and span, whatever there was of it.\nAnd they stayed in a hotel -- I mean, they couldn\u2019t stay with us. So she cooked and she took\ncare, you know, and she saw Paul and they saw it, so -- for -- that was very nice.",
        "Q: You -- you got along well?",
        "A: Well, yes, we got along, but not we -- not very much. They also would have liked Marty\nto marry somebody with some money and some -- you know -- I think they were\ndisappointed. I\u2019m sure they were, yeah. She didn\u2019t take care well, of my things. You know, I\nhad rug -- I had some -- some Or-Oriental rugs and they got wet in the basement and they\njust threw it out. They didn\u2019t know what was good, really. And -- but they -- and what they\ndid was, they went into my -- into my trunk and they got out the pictures to see about my\nhistory and stuff. They didn\u2019t trust -- they also sent somebody to my -- before we married,\nthey sent s -- a d -- they ha -- they asked somebody to go see my uncle -- my Uncle Bep\nPerson to see what kind of family 1t was. You kn -- if it was true, what I had told. I mean,\nhere was this girl, alone, living thi -- and there was no family with it, nothing. [doorbell]\nThis I have to answer.",
        "Q: Okay. [inaudible] At what point did you ever find out the fate of your parents and your\nsister?",
        "A: Ah, never. Well, no that\u2019s not true. I was trying to get a death certificate, because I\ncouldn\u2019t inherit -- I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t lay claim to anything. Not that there was much, or\nanything, actually. But I couldn\u2019t -- there was no proof of anything, you know, that I had a\nright -- why did I need it? There was some reason that I needed a death certificate and there\nwasn\u2019t any and so the Red Cross, at a certain point, in 19 -- I don\u2019t know exactly the date,\nbut they gave a blanket death certificate to all the peop -- because of this, th-the inability to\ninhe -- you know and the inability go on with your life, practically.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They gave a blanket death certificate. But I had heard -- I knew th-they -- I found out --\nsomebody told me what transport they had gone on, which was November 19th, 1953. That\nthey were sent to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Say what -- what was the date?",
        "A: November 19th, I think, 1943, that they were sent to Auschwitz and that particular --",
        "Q: Three -- three of them go? Your sister too?",
        "A: Yeah. And that particular transport was immediately sent to the ovens. It never -- you\nknow how in other transports, there was right and left, sort of?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: This, no. This particular transport, they were not tortured first. They were killed right\naway. And that the Red Cross knew. And they knew that they had been in that parti --\nbecause Westerbork had records. You know, the collection place in Holland had records.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they knew that that transport went to Auschwitz at a certain date and Auschwitz\nhad records and -- they knew that that whole transport was killed the day it arrived, which\nwas maybe the 20 -- the 23rd of November, 24th of November. And one thing that\u2019s always\ngotten me is that I keep thinking, what did I do that day? I mean, you know? That is so --\nthat is something that got stuck in my mind. You know, another reason I know when they\nleft, is because my Uncle Heinz was there in Westerbork. He saw them go. His mother was\non the same transport. My Aunt Kait, my father\u2019s oldest sister. So -- so she had been\nunderground, but she had been given away by somebody and she was -- she was in that\nsame transport. So that they all went together. And -- and that\u2019s something, you know, I\nthink, what did I do? What did I do? As a -- it\u2019s an incredible thing. Of course, you don\u2019t\nknow what goes on. I mean, you know I can be -- sit here and Marty can -- you know,\nsomething happens to him at the hospital two, three blocks away and I don\u2019t know what\ngoes on. And in the war, you didn\u2019t know what went on three blocks away, unless\nsomebody told you. You know, it just -- I mean that -- the way I escaped, for instance, you\nknow, the people did not know the -- M-Manfred did not know what had happened in our\npart of Amsterdam, the part where I had been. Well, this is all on the other tape, but you\nnever know what went -- what went on. No, unless you heard shooting, you didn\u2019t know\nsomebody had been killed. You know, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s an in -- absolutely incredible\nthings. And -- and -- and guilt, let\u2019s talk about guilt. I -- I -- I think I have less guilt feelings\nthan most people and I don\u2019t know why that is. I often think that I have not as much\nsensibility as other people. And it worries me. But -- but maybe it is because I decided to do\nwhat I did, you know\u201d? I decided to escape. And that I don\u2019t think that putting yourself in\ndanger, in any way, makes you a better person. I think it makes you a stupid person, if you\nhave a choice. If you have a choice -- like people who climb Mount Everest, if they die, hm.\nWhose fault is that? If you have a choice and you put yourself in danger -- and I had a\nchoice. I didn\u2019t know whether I was going to make it -- you know, whether I was -- do you\nknow what I\u2019m talking about? When I escaped from -- that was the day they were taken\naway, I escaped. So, anyway, I --",
        "Q: They day that -- that who was taken away?",
        "A: My parents.",
        "Q: You escaped?",
        "A: Yeah, I escaped fr-from the situation that they were tak --",
        "Q: But you had already escaped, hadn\u2019t you?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Weren\u2019t you already separated from them?",
        "A: I was, but I\u2019d gone back home. I was home the day it all happened.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So -- so I -- I -- I\u2019m -- I did it, I made -- made up my mind and I tell you, when I went to\nHolland and we went for the documentary, that your --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: They took me to the bridge that I escaped from. We didn\u2019t know exactly which bridge it\nwas, but I remembered that I tried three bridges and it was the last one, I succeeded to get\nover. The first two didn\u2019t succeed. And we went to that bridge and I looked at it -- now this\nis 50 some years ago, you know? And I thought -- and things have changed a little bit in the\nneighborhood, but not too much on that side. And it -- it was a shock, you know? I\u2019d never\nbeen back there, consciously. And there was that damn bridge and I just saw this guy\nstanding there, the one who let me out. I tell you, I -- and -- and to go to my house. To go to\nmy apartment, where we lived, on the Notaramstellat. And to -- to ride in the trolley. We\nrode in the trolley that I escaped from and do you know that I miss -- that I thought that the\ntrolley that I escaped on was the trolley that was in front of my house. It turns out it was the\none across the street. The one in front of my house went the other way. I had it wrong.\nEither I had it wrong, or they changed. I -- I -- I still would like to find that out. But they\nfilmed in the trolley. I didn\u2019t escape the second time on that trolley, the fir -- I escaped\ntwice. And the first time, I was on -- I did it on the trolley. The second time, there was no\ntrolley. And I had to walk to the bridge. But anyway, it -- it -- 1t -- I often think that this\nfeeling that I don\u2019t feel so guilty that I am alive. I feel terrible, terrible, about them not being\nalive and about my sister. That\u2019s the worst thing. Because I remember Manfred telling my\nparents, \u201cIf anything happens, please put her in the hideaway.\u201d There was a hideaway in the\nhouse. \u201cPlease put her in there, please put her in there\u201d And as I left, I said, \u201cSusan-\nSusanna, you go in that hiding place. They won\u2019t come. It\u2019s too big a rattsia, it\u2019s too big a\npogrom, it\u2019s too big a pick up situation. They cannot go into every house, they won\u2019t go into\nevery house.\u201d And they didn\u2019t. She could have been there and we could have gotten her out.\nBut she was three years younger than I was, so that means I was -- she was 14. And in those\ndays, 14 was a very little girl and she didn\u2019t want to leave her parents. And they didn\u2019t force\nher to. There were some parents who sent their kids to England. There were some paren --\nwhich was horrible. There were some parents like -- like this girl Fink, I told you about,\nwho handed their kids over to people. But my parents didn\u2019t do this to Susan. They didn\u2019t\ntell her to stay in there. I said we would send somebody to get her, you know? And they did\nnot do this, they -- we did -- we -- Manfred went in the evening, when all was dark and was\nquiet, you couldn\u2019t see anything that had happened in that neighborhood. And -- which was\na very mixed neighborhood and people were on the streets and everything was normal. And\nManfred went into -- I had the key, after all and he went into the house and he took out a lot\nof silver and he took out a lot of stuff. Rugs he took out and everything, that -- which we\nsold to live during the occupation. So he could safely do that un-under cover of darkness\nand with his false papers, which were quite excellent. They said that he was a German and\nall that kind of stuff. And -- but Susanna wasn\u2019t there. You know, he went there to get her\nout.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, cause maybe I didn\u2019t quite pick up the whole story from the video tape, but\njust explain to me -- you had -- you had already left the family and were already working\nunderground?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: I was already underground.",
        "Q: And I know that there was some tension, because there was a fear that you had that if it\nwas understood that you had gone underground, that your parents might get in trouble.",
        "A: Well, that was their fear. We -- we were saying it won\u2019t make any difference.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: What -- what the Germans said was, they put in you in a s -- they\u2019re going to put you ina\nspecial barrack and you will sent -- be -- be sent away before anybody else. That\u2019s what\nthey had said. Now the thing was, where would they send you? You would die one way or\nyou would die a -- this is what Manfred told me.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: He said, \u201cDev -- dead is dead and there won\u2019t be any difference. So you come and you\ngo underground.\u201d But let me explain to you. I had gone underground and I was living\nsomewhere else and it was a holiday, the 20th of June. And my f -- my father called, or I\ncalled home to see how things were and he said, \u201cPlease come. Please, please, please. We\nhaven\u2019t seen you in eight -- in so many months,\u201d I forget how many months. \u201cPlease come,\nyou know. We\u2019re still here, it does -- seems okay, you know, and it\u2019s not to be too\ndangerous.\u201d So I told Manfred -- I wasn\u2019t living with him then, I was living in a poncion, in\na boarding house. And -- and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t go. I don\u2019t think anything will happen, in\nparticular, but why would you make -- endanger yourself like that?\u201d I hadn\u2019t been wearing a\nstar, I had been underground. Had good pa -- not good papers, but I had some papers. And,\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t endanger yourself like that.\u201d",
        "Q: Just to travel?",
        "A: Just to go from -- no -- yes, to go from -- and be there. Why should you go somewhere\nwhere something could happen, you know? And of course I did want to see my parents.\nAnd I went to friends of ours, a Jewish friend and I put on my star, very lightly, just at the\npoints. And I went to see my parents. And that same night, somebody came to see us and\ntold us what was going to happen in our neighborhood.",
        "Q: Which was?",
        "A: A big rattsia. An enormous pogrom. An enormous pick up of Jewish people. Very mixed\nneighborhood, so it wasn\u2019t like it was all going to be emptied out. They\u2019re going to -- were\ngoing to be people there. And for instance, the people called Erstrasher, you know Liesel,\nEmma and Maria Austria and all of them, they were there when -- when that big rattsia\nhappened and they did what I asked my parents to do with Su-Susie. They went in a hiding\nplace that they had, upstairs. They did the same thing, we had double walls. They sat in the\ndouble wall. They had a dr -- a drawers that they pulled toward them. They had a handle on\nthe back of drawers and they pulled it -- from the hole in the wall, they pulled it toward\nthem.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: So if people would come up, it wouldn\u2019t look like enis -- anybody there. It was a Sunday.\nOn Sunday people go away. They -- it was a beautiful day, it was June, you know, people\ngo for walking, they go fo -- to the beach and do -- go whatever. And -- so they didn\u2019t have\nto be there. The Germans came, there were loudspeakers, they were saying all Jews have to\nprepare themselves, nobody else is allowed on the street. And so, the Jews just went\ndownstairs and went on there. On -- on the wagons, the cars that they had, the trucks. But\nthe ones that didn\u2019t come, didn\u2019t come. And the Germans did not go and eve -- if they\nknocked on doors, which I don\u2019t know if they did, if people didn\u2019t answer, they didn\u2019t break\nthe doors down. They didn\u2019t come. There were too many people involved. Crowds of\npeople, crowds of Jews that came down. Everybody -- all the others stood at the windows\nwatching, after all.",
        "Q: Wh-What -- and -- but wasn\u2019t there a sense that there was great danger? To get on the\ntransport?",
        "A: Of course they knew if was danger, but they si -- that was the rule. I mean, most people\ndo what they\u2019re told to do, you know\u201d?",
        "Q: And just that -- so I understand, in -- in relationship, time-wise, wh -- at what point did\nthe Franks go into hiding?",
        "A: Oh, way ahead.",
        "Q: What -- much before that?",
        "A: They went -- they went into hiding when Margot, in the beginning, you see, in \u201842,\npeople were called up by name. And Margot Frank got a letter -- a note which said she had\nto be at the train station on that and that date, at that and that time. And she had to bring a\nrucksack, she couldn\u2019t take more than a small -- etcetera.",
        "Q: Yeah. But you\u2019re -- and your parents knew that they had gone in to hiding, right?",
        "A: No. We didn\u2019t know they had gone into hiding.",
        "Q: Where did you think they were?",
        "A: In Switzerland.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Some people -- people with money could escape and the Franks had -- you know, they\nmight be -- get caught, but they tried. And -- and -- but the Franks had family in -- be -- in\nBasil, we knew that. And that was the rumor that was spread, because they had a person\nwho was renting a room in their house. And he was there and I remember going there,\nasking -- wanting to ask Margot to come out -- to -- to talk.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he opened the door and he said, \u201cOh no, they\u2019re gone. They went to Switzerland.\u201d\nThat -- they wanted him to say that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s exactly what happened. Of course I spread the rumor. People were\nasking, \u201cWell, where are the Franks?\u201d I said, \u201cI guess they went to Switzerland.\u201d",
        "Q: I see. So you found out that th-there was going to be this round up and you did what?",
        "A: And we -- we found out that -- about the round up. Amazingly a lot -- enough, through a\nwoman that -- whom we always had called Cassandra. She came and she told us. And at that\npoint, my father had always said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t go -- don\u2019t go underground,\u201d because of what\nwe mentioned before.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: This time he said, \u201cGo.\u201d And -- and my mother, w-we -- I couldn\u2019t take anything,\nbecause they thought, if I get picked up with anything, you know what I\u2019m --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So I just took a towel, a bathing suit and my toothbrush, or something. I forget what I\ntook. A -- a piece of soap maybe, for a --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: As if I was at the pool. I don\u2019t want to tell that story. But anyway, that was when I tri --\nwent by the --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- bridges, and --",
        "Q: And you took your star off?",
        "A: Oh yes, the star was off. And -- but I was the only one on the street, because Jews had to\nget ready and they had an hour to get ready and no gentiles were allowed, nobody else was\nallowed on the street. But I was on the street. So anyway, that always gives me the shakes.\nAnd I tell it on the other tapes, I --",
        "Q: No, I -- I know. I\u2019m sorry to [indecipherable]",
        "A: So -- but we went to my house -- my apartment and I -- I looked up and I saw that there\nwere lamps and things sort of leaning up against the window and I thought, \u201cThere\u2019s\nsomething wrong. There\u2019s probably nobody there. Maybe they\u2019 re painting -- they\u2019re\npainting, or something. And the woman underneath us -- th-there was a woman und -- at the\nwindow, watching the filming, which they did in front of our house, of me. They filmed me\nwalking up to the house and looking up, etcetera, etcetera, as you do. And she saw that. So\nthey -- Barbara rang the bell at her house and said, \u201cLook, could we -- since this doesn\u2019t\nseem to be anybody up there, could we come in your house?\u201d And they said yes. Now this\napartment was a little different from ours, because ours was two levels. We had an\ndownstairs and an upstairs and hers was just one level, but she had a -- done a beautiful job\nredoing her house. It was just wonderful. And I saw again what a lovely neighborhood that\nwas. I mean, it really was and -- but it was just unbelievable.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Me-Memorial Museum interview\nwith Barbara Rodbell. This is tape number four, side B.",
        "A: We -- since this doesn\u2019t seem to be anybody up there, could we come in your house?\u201d\nAnd they said yes. Now this apartment was a little different from ours, because ours was\ntwo levels. We had an downstairs and an upstairs and hers was just one level, but she had a -\n- done a beautiful job redoing her house. It was just wonderful. And I saw again what a\nlovely neighborhood that was. I mean, it really was, and -- but it was just unbelievable to be\nin there. Just -- just unbelievable. What had happened upstairs was that these people, who\nhad lived there all the time, since 19 -- I don\u2019t know what -- just after the war, I guess. They\nhad just died. They had just died and their -- their children were cleaning up the apartment\nand they didn\u2019t feel that anybody could be in there, which was logical. So that\u2019s why we\nwent to the apartment underneath there. Yeah, and we looked -- I looked out of the window\nand I saw this -- what I always used to see. Nothing had changed there. What had changed is\nthe store -- there was a store on the corner and that had changed. Was -- it\u2019s a dentist now,\nwhich 1s not nice, instead of a -- a baker, yes I think, yeah.",
        "Q: So te-tell me a little bit more about this transition to motherhood and having your own\nchildren and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and building a family once again.",
        "A: Well, it -- it -- it felt like old hat. I mean -- I -- it felt like I should have done it all the\ntime. I mean, I was 25. I -- no, really I was older, I was 27 and a half, maybe, when I had my\nfirst child. We were married when I was 25 and I had my first child in 1953. We were\nmarried in \u201850. Two and a half years. And I f -- it felt absolutely wonderful. I mean, I had a\nwonderful mother, I had a caring surroundings as a child myself, and I guess the way you\ndo, you pass it on. And that -- we have a wonderful family. We all -- we all get along and --\nand it\u2019s very loving with all of them and very close. I have one daughter and three sons and\nthe boys are wonderful. As nice, as wonderful as the daughter and it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s just been\nvery good. And, to my great surprise, when I was mentioning that you were coming, and\nalso during discussion of the -- during discussion of the film that was being -- was made, I\nasked them these questions which I had never asked them. \u201cWe-Were you influenced at all\nby my having had this history?\u201d Because I never felt that we were in any way different from\nanybody else. And they said, \u201cWell, we didn\u2019t have any family. We didn\u2019t have much\nfamily.\u201d Well, we had Marty\u2019s family, but they\u2019re very small family. Marty had one sibling\nand he\u2019s not close with her. Sh-She\u2019s six years younger. And his father died early and his\nmother was a bit s-strange and -- but she came, so we had some connection with his mother.\nWe weren\u2019t enemies in any way, we were friendly with his mother, although not close. He\ndid -- never cared too much for his mother. And so that was something they did care about.\nNow, we had many friends and they had children and we had a close knit group, so I had lot\n-- they had lots of people around. We have lots of pictures of Sunday brunches. We always\ngave Sunday brunches. And we had lunch of -- lots of parties and we had people in the\nneighborhood and people from his work and we always had a very lively surroundings. It\nwasn\u2019t that they felt lonely. But they did -- now, they all married people with big families.\nWhich was ju -- is -- is maybe not surprising. I mean, after the war, people had lots of kids,\nso they had lots -- we had four kids, after all, you know? And these kids have family --\nhave -- have siblings. And they say, \u201cOh, I come from -- my -- my husband or wife has lots\nof family,\u201d because they have four -- you know, they have three siblings. So they all have\nhuge families on the other side. All of them.",
        "Q: Now what -- what -- what do they do?",
        "A: Paul is a small businessman. He has a degree in business and in geology, a small degree\nin geology and a big degree in business. But he is 1n business and he\u2019s in business for\nhimself. Now, one thing, he can\u2019t stand authority, so he can\u2019t really work for anybody. But\nhe works for himself, he does very interesting things. He goes to South America, that\u2019s one\nof his things there. He -- and -- and he buys goods and he sells them. He sells wholesale and\nhe sells on the street, sometimes.",
        "Q: And where 1s he living?",
        "A: And he lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, so in the same area that we lived in all the time.\nHe\u2019s not married. And I keep thinking, is that anything to do with our history? He says that\nhe has felt different from other people his age and his group, as long as he can remember.",
        "Q: Because\u201d?",
        "A: And that is very strange to me. Because of me. Or because of him knowing what he -- his\nbackground, you know, his grandparents -- happened to his grandparents and this and that.\nNow, I want to tell you, we never discussed it. I mean, we talked about it, if 1t came up. You\nknow, if there was something in the paper about the Holocaust or about the war, we\ndiscussed it. Dad -- Marty told about the Pacific war and what he -- what happened to him\nand I would te -- or he told a lot about -- about China, where he was -- eight months he was\nin China. And I -- and they would ask me and I did tell. I told a little bit, but never from a\ngruesome kind of point of view, you know? I did not see a dead person, all during the war.\nAs impossible as that seemed, I didn\u2019t. We weren\u2019t bombed to any degree in Amsterdam.\nAnd I never worked in the underground where you killed people or did anything like that.\nAnd you know, there was nothing that I would tell that would scare them in any way. But I\nremember that when it was brought up in school -- and it was, you know, when he had\nhistory and -- or something at school, in high school -- that they came back with these tales\nand that they asked me, you know, \u201cWas it like this?\u201d And, \u201cWas it like that?\u201d And -- and h\n-- they hated the Germans. I mean they just hated them. I didn\u2019t hate them at all. I mean, I --\nI look at people as people and I don\u2019t expect too much from them. I don\u2019t expect from an --\nan average person to put himself in danger for anybody else, not even for themselves. Most\npeople just go along with what\u2019s going on where they live. It takes character to -- or -- it\ntakes character or it takes absolute willpower to -- to be an ideologue of some sort. To -- to\nact differently than your surroundings. And there are very few people who would do that,\nyou know? Very few people who stand up and -- up and say, \u201cDo me something, but I feel\nthis and that way.\u201d You know, bang. I mean, what\u2019s the good of it? So -- so you don\u2019t\nexpect too much. You don\u2019t expect people to be other than normal in trying to stay alive.\nThat seems to be the human condition. The -- the necessity to stay alive, really overcomes\nall other concerns that a person might have. And people will do nearly anything to -- of ne --\nof -- of momentary necessity to achieve that goal, the goal of staying alive. They sometimes\nwill kill, because staying alive might say -- might need food and if there is very little food,\nyou have to -- might have to do something to get it. I often think of that when we\u2019re stand in\nline at the grocery store. I think we can be -- we can afford to be friendly, because we know\nthere\u2019s plenty more in the store, you know? But if there isn\u2019t -- so the human condition is\nvery, very weak and shaky and it\u2019s built on certain assumptions, the assumptions of the\nmoment.

        "Q: And that -- how do you feel about that?",
        "A: I feel fine about it. I feel very fine about it. And I think it has to do with -- with\nsomething very stupid and -- and of course goes back to my background, that I feel that\nthere\u2019s more secure, if they\u2019re not all Jewish -- the children. And that -- you know, this is\ngoing back to Hitler, I mean. Nothing like this might ever happen in the same kind of way\nas it happened in Europe in the -- in the 40\u2019s, but y-you can only protect yourself against\nwhat you know, and this is what I know. So -- so -- however limited it is. And I do not\nreally -- I would not -- I do not really believe in any religion -- in religion per se, I should\nsay. So I would not like any of the in-laws to be religious, and they\u2019re not. None of them\nand their families are in any way religious. But the danger exists in my mind, you know,\nthat -- that one of the children will end up religious. It\u2019s up to them, they can go a --\nwhichever way they want and it\u2019s their choice.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: I think the important thing here is choice and I do not choose it. I did not cheese --\nchoose the people they married, either. And so I -- you know, that\u2019s their business.",
        "Q: Do -- do you think that your -- your experience -- the experience of the -- what -- what\nhappened to your family, your parents, did it affect in any way, your belief in God?",
        "A: I cannot say that has. I cannot think that I was ever religious in any which way. When we\nwere in Holland, the Franks and us, there was -- you know, in the -- not right away, but\nwhen times got bad -- w-we got there in \u201833, I don\u2019t know -- I think about \u201838 or nine or\nsomething, they set up a -- a Reform kind of temp -- you know, religious group. There was\nno Temple, but there was a religious group. And I think that the Franks and us were in there.\nI remember sitting in a class and -- and learning some Hebrew letters and things, which I\ndon\u2019t remember anything about. But the Franks hadn\u2019t been in any of that, either. Neither\none of us had been -- as far as I remember it, in any way involved. I remember my money --\nmy mother lighting a candles on Friday. And she knew the browhouse -- the re-- the\nreligious things you say when you light the candles. And she must have learned it\nsomewhere. Now, whether she learned it at her father\u2019s knee, did her mother do it? Yes, it\nmight hav -- be so. But I can\u2019t remember it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s very likely that she learned that, you know, from her mother. But I don\u2019t even know\nif Huntz was Bar Mitzvahed. I imagine he was -- of -- or Paul was Bar Mitzvahed. My pay -\n- my -- my Uncle Paul.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I imagine it -- 1t was -- they were, but I -- I have no proof of that. I really should ask me\nIsraeli cousin. I have two real cousins. One of them Huntz\u2019s and one from my Uncle Paul.\nOne from my Uncle Huntz and one from my Uncle Paul.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: And Martin\u2019s becoming a scientist --",
        "A: Martin -- Martin was Bar Mitzvahed.",
        "Q: Yeah. But did he becoming a scientist affect his association with religion and God?",
        "A: No. He was never religious either and neither were his parents. He was Bar Mitzvahed, it\nwas understood. It was like a ritual, but -- but it was not -- they never -- they did not go to\nTemple, except on Rosh Hashanah. They did go on Rosh Hashanah, because the whole\nfamily went.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They have the huge family in Baltimore. One reason Marty said he left Baltimore with\nme, after we were married, was because he said, \u201cYou have nobody on your side, but I have\nthis huge family, you\u2019re going to be drowned and we don\u2019t want that.\u201d He was -- he\nobviously wasn\u2019t that fond, you know? He liked his family. He liked his family and unc --\ncousins and uncles and aunts, was huge. 150 - 200 people, I mean, you know. But I know\nhis grandmother, Sara Rodbell and I don\u2019t know her own na -- Calman -- no, wasn\u2019t\nCalman. She -- I knew her very well. She\u2019s the one who came from po -- from Lithuania\nand then came from -- via -- with her husband, from Warsaw. She was anti-religious in the\nworst way, because her mother was married, of course, they -- her father was one of these\nitinerant rabbi\u2019s in Poland. And he died of pneumonia or something, you know, in Poland,\nbecause he had to travel from one place to another and it was very cold. And his mother\nmarried some family of his here in Baltimore. That\u2019s why -- her mother rather, married -- so\nwhen she -- the mother -- my grandm -- his grand -- start over. Marty\u2019s grandmother, named\nSara, married -- came to this country, Baltimore, when she was 12. And her father had died\nin Poland and her mother married a relation of the father, here in Baltimore. There were five\nchildren when -- when she came. This woman came here with five children and she had\nthree more with this fellow from -- this family member that -- that she married. Calman --\nhis name was Calman. And this Calman was in Shul the whole time. And so Marty\u2019s\ngrandmother, Sara, saw her mother work and work and work and work. He never\ncontributed anything to that family, except more children. So -- so she hated religion with a\npassion. It killed her father and it did nothing for her mother. On the contrary, it kept the\nsecond husband in Shul the whole time.",
        "Q: That\u2019s funny, I have a similar story in mine --",
        "A: Really?",
        "Q: It was my mother, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. But anyway, so that grandm -- so -- so Marty\u2019s grandmother was anti-religious, so\nher f -- his father didn\u2019t get any religion because his -- the father of -- her -- his gran --\nMarty\u2019s grandfather, the father of his father, was a wonderful guy and he wasn\u2019t religious in\nany way, either. Very lively fella. So --",
        "Q: So this is anoth-another kind of very broad and very difficult question to answer, but can\nyou tell me at all about how this whole compendium of experiences, both the horrible things\nthat happened in the war and the wonderful things that have happened -- how they have\nshaped your -- your view of humankind?",
        "A: You know, I have to tell you -- aside from getting, I hope wiser and -- y -- with age, after\nhave -- after having assimilated everything that happened to me in my 72 years, I cannot\nthink that I\u2019 ve changed very much, you know? I think that after all I\u2019ve been through over\nthese 72 years, I think I\u2019m getting easier on people. I\u2019m much easier on people. I mean, I\nforgive them nearly everything. Because I know how hard it is to live. Just to live is\ndifficult. I mean, if you think about the irony of what we build up and -- and work at and it\u2019s\njust so we die in the end. I mean, it\u2019s just ridiculous situation. We\u2019re put in such an ironical\nsituation by being born or after being born, of having to deal with the fact that we have to\ntake everything that goes on in the world very seriously, because after all, it\u2019s our life and\nwe have to function within it. And in the end, just to die. You know? It is really a very\nironical situation. I mean, I -- I think of these people on Long Island who recently died, who\nhad this fantastic collection of paintings. I mean, they went all over the world, they\ncollected, they collected, they collected. They spent billions, millions, you know, collecting,\ncollecting. And when they died, people didn\u2019t even know what to do with the stuff. They\njust put in on auction, it went all over the world, it di -- so what, you know? I mean, it just is\n-- it is really ironic, it is so ironic. So what can you do? What can you do? I\u2019m -- I\u2019m trying\nto figure out what you can do. The only thing you can do that is worth something in life, is\nbe good to your fellow man. The other travelers who happen to be on this earth, accidentally\nat the same time that you are. You know? And trying to help them, if you\u2019re better off than\nthey are, in their trip across the years. I mean, it\u2019s just the only thing you can do. And also\nthe only thing you can do 1s -- is take care of the people that you can reach. You know, it\u2019s\nas if your arms have a certain length and they stretch out as wide as they can and they hold\nwhatever they can and they -- they do good to the ends of their fingertips. I mean, that\u2019s the\nonly thing you can do. And I think that is a Jewish thing. Although, I must say, I\u2019ve met\nmany, many Gentiles who have exactly that same feelings. And -- and in my basically being\nJewish, you know, I think, who knows about their forebears? Who knows who they were?\nThere must be some Jewish in them. Because you know, it is -- it is amazing, at the\ninterfaith council. I mean they\u2019re nearly all Jewish -- I mean they\u2019re nearly all Gentiles and\nthey have exactly the same outlook. So maybe it\u2019s not Jewish after all. Maybe it\u2019s just being\na good human being and -- and trying to [indecipherable] the best you can while you are\nliving. So I do.",
        "Q: I think that\u2019s a good place to stop, huh?",
        "A: -- and some people -- now you\u2019re missing the beginning of the sentence.",

        "A: \u2019m re -- you know, I\u2019m thinking about the very beginning of things when -- when Jews\nwere a tribe in the desert -- everybody was Jewish, right? There was nothing else, except\nmaybe the pagans. But mostly it was -- anybody who was religious probably was Jewish or\nsomething. Some kind of offshoot of that.

        "Q: But I -- no, but the -- the planning.",

        "Q: It was just my ignorance, but I didn\u2019t know that, so I -- so I went there and I saw it and\nit\u2019s -- number one, it\u2019s -- 1-1-it\u2019s -- it\u2019s serene looking.

And they cleaned it out\nand they sort of made it a makeshift gas chamber. What was really upsetting to me, was\nwhen you go two miles down the road to Birkenau and you see that they have worked with\nthis small facility at Auschwitz and it wasn\u2019t proper -- it wasn\u2019t designed well, it wasn\u2019t\nefficient.

        "A: Yeah, this -- the hidden child thing 1s -- 1s very good. You know we -- I don\u2019t know if\nSimone mentioned to you -- what is her name now? I\u2019m drawing a blank. Last name is Fink.\nShe -- she was a hidden child, in Holland, she was four or five when her mother --",
        "A: She -- there\u2019s definitely -- in her story, you can definitely see that her life was influenced\nby the situation -- by her past, yeah. I have always thought that my life -- it might have been\ndifferent, because I would have never left Germany, you know. I was born in Berlin and I\nwould have lived in Berlin and probably married in Germany or whatever. And I would\nhave never had this broad experience of life, which I ended up having. Because Germany\nwas very narrow. They were very focused upon themselves, they were the greatest, the best,\nthe this and the that. And you would have never had this wide experience. But I would have\nhad a very interesting life, wa -- you know, one way or the other. I don\u2019t know if it would\nhave -- from that point, if you had -- it made a difference, in the sense that I was kicked out -\n- you know, that I had to leave, that I had to live a broader life than I would have otherwise.\nBut as far as the history of humanity goes, that you have children -- that you marry and you\nhave chi -- you grow up, marry and have children, I don\u2019t think that would have been very\ndifferent. Would have been in a different country, but it wouldn\u2019t have been very different. I\ndo think that my outlook ended up much broader than it would have been if I\u2019d never left\nGermany, yeah.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I said, that because you -- I had to leave Europe. I didn\u2019t really\nhave to leave Europe, but because I left Europe and I s -- I looked at Europe from the\noutside. And I still f -- when I\u2019m in Europe now, I still feel very European, very European. I\n-- | don\u2019t feel like an American in Europe. I -- I feel European. But when I\u2019m here, I also do\nnot feel a stranger at all, here. And if you want to go a little chronologically, you know, I\nnever really did feel very strange here, you know. It was when I first came over, I felt\nextremely lonely, of course. I was terribly lonely.",
        "A: Well, after the war -- you know, I was a dancer in Amsterdam. I lived in Amsterdam,\nfirst of all, not in Germany.",
        "A: And I was there all during the war. I was with a group of young people, we wer -- we\nsurvived the war intact. Not one of us got taken and it was due to the leader of the pack.\nThat was Manfred Greenback, who 1s still alive and who 1s still in Amsterdam and -- and\nwho is actually getting a pension from the Dutch government for the work he and his sister,\nboth -- she also s -- also has a kind of a small pension from the Dutch government, for the\nwork that they did during the war. But, as a -- I was in that group with hi -- with them.",
        "A: This was -- during the war, it was underground work.",
        "A: In the underground. But he definitely -- he and his sister both, definitely saved us. With\nthe -- through their organization, their ability to get the various papers that you needed to\nsurvive and to get food stamps and -- and their connections with other groups. And it was\nlike a large spider web of -- of underground activity. They were all connected, one way or\nthe other, even though their beliefs might have been and their reasons for doing the work\nmight have been very different from each other. During the war, they all worked together.\nAnd anyway, I sa -- we survived the war and after the war, I was in the ballet with Sonia\nGasco. It is a -- the ballet that -- that later became Niederlancer Balletta, the big Dutch ballet\nin -- in the Stutz-Hober, the big theater in -- in amst -- the state ballet. It was then called the\nBallet 1945, when -- when I was in it. That was the beginning. And Madame Gasco, who --\nwho started it, started organizing this last month before the war was ended. We -- we\nalready knew, you know, that the war was going to end and we started practicing and -- and\n-- and rehearsing and doing all these things. And we were ready -- not quite -- by the time\nthe war was -- was actually ended. And I -- I worked with her and I danced with the ballet\nand I had various other jobs. I also did photography. I studied photography with a friend of\nmy mother\u2019s, who had also survived the war and had actually sort of held her hand over my\nhead, even though I didn\u2019t even know it. But she had sort of protected me from various\nthings that went on during the war. So it\u2019s all very complicated, but -- but it -- that\u2019s how it\nwas.",
        "A: Well, during the war, I was -- I was dancing. I -- I -- I think I tell all that on the -- on the\nother tape.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t really want to --",
        "A: -- go over it all again.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s right, she was protecting me in the sense that they decided that some of the\nthings I was during -- doing during the war, was endangering myself.",
        "A: And she saw to it that I had to stop doing them. She never talked to me, but she talked to\nthe people who I\u2019m do -- I was doing it with and they managed to -- without letting me\nknow why -- to dissuade me from continuing what I was doing. And so in that sense, I\ndidn\u2019t know til after the war that it was her -- she who had done this. It was very interesting.\nSo, as I was saying, it was a spider web and -- and it was extended to me, I was part of it\nand they took care of me. So, even though I didn\u2019t know it. But anyway -- so, after the war,\nI was dancing with ga -- Sonia Gasco and friends of my parents started writing letters to our\nold address and -- and saying, \u201cWell, what happened to your family? What happened?\u201d You\nknow, and these were people all over the world. I mean Australia and South America and\nAmerica -- you know, was North America. Canada, every -- letters came from all over the\nworld. And I went back to our old apartment, which was the place they all wrote to. And I\ntold the lady where I was and she -- she forwarded all the mail. When I saw them all -- all\nthese letters, I ch -- answered only the ones that I could remember, because many of these\npeop -- they were all friends of my parents, not of mine. And some of them I didn\u2019t\nremember and some of them I did. And the one I remembered best, was Dr. Kalinoffsky\u2019s\nfamily, because in Berlin we used to have gymnastics with their two daughters, they had\ntwo daughters, Hilda and Lothar Kalinoffsky. And we had gymnastics with them in Berlin\nand when we came to Holland, they had gone -- he was a psychiatrist in Berlin and they had\ngone to Rome. And he had to study again, he got a degree in Rome. And he was a\npsychiatrist in Rome. And then, when a -- when he felt like things weren\u2019t going so well in\nItaly, he decided to go to the United States. He went to the United States with his family and\nhe had to do a third degree -- the third -- you know, he got -- he got his doctorate in\npsychiatry in New York. And that\u2019s where he was, in New York. So when I got their letter, I\nwrote. And it turned out that he had been asked to help establish the Department of\nPsychiatry at the free University of Berlin. I think it\u2019s in Dallem. It\u2019s in Dallem or wherever\nit is. It\u2019s in -- near Berlin -- in Berlin. And so h-he decided he was going to go via\nAmsterdam and -- to Berlin, from -- from the in -- from New York. So he came by and he\nsaid, \u201cCome to the United States. Come -- we take care of it, come.\u2019 You know? Well, I was\ndoing very well at that time and I kept saying, \u201cNo, I -- I can\u2019t make up my mind.\u201d He kept\nsaying, \u201cLook, your parents aren\u2019t going to come back and --\u201d as I\u2019m telling on the other\ntape, I kept thinking, \u201cYes, maybe they will come back, and my sister. Somebody will show\nup, you know, they will be all r -- somebody will come, I can\u2019t come right away.\u201d So I\npostponed and postponed. Finally, in 1947, he ca -- I mean, he kept coming, every three,\nfour months, when he had to go to Berlin, and say, \u201cCome, come, come.\u201d And he sent me an\naffidavit. And I got a call from the American embassy in Rotterdam and they were saying,\n\u201cWell, do you want to come, or don\u2019t you want to come? You got plenty of people who\nwant to come, I mean, what\u2019s going on there?\u201d And so I took a deep breath and I went. It\nwas terribly hard. I mean, I had a boyfriend and I had -- you know, I was -- I was in the\nballet, I was doing well and I was getting up there and it was just terribly hard to leave. But\non the other hand, I really -- I didn\u2019t see a real future and I -- I thought, well, you know, my\nparents were killed, my sister was gone, my grandmother was gone, my -- I had family. I\nhad a lot of family still, my mother\u2019s family there. And even a cousin of my father\u2019s, Heinz\nKemfer was still there and -- in Holland. And -- but it wasn\u2019t really my own, you know? It\nwasn\u2019t close enough and -- so many changes had taken place, and I should make a change.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t have to be forever, I kept taying -- saying to myself. You know, I mean, after\nall, I could come back and you know, if I -- if I really didn\u2019t like it, you know, I could come\nback and --",
        "A: Well, that -- tha -- I didn\u2019t even think about that because he\u2019s -- well, I thought I was\ngoing to dance, actually. Yes, I thought I was going to dance. Well, it turned out that they\nlived on Long Island. And I -- I\u2019m having trouble remembering the town. I know that the\nsecond house that they had was -- oh yeah, I know, it was Babylon, I think. I think it was\nBabylon, but I\u2019m not sure. The second place they lived was Brightwaters. They moved\npretty soon after I had came, they had -- they moved to Brightwaters and that\u2019s -- you know,\nit is a ways from New York. It -- you have to take the Long Island railroad. And as I found\nout pretty soon, you know, it was difficult. I had to be in New York for the dance -- for my\nclasses at the American School of Ballet and it was hard to get to and fro -- get the timing\nright. I could never date, because I -- the train came -- you know, the train -- I had to take a\ncertain train back. And it was just too complicated t-to -- to live out on the island if you\nwanted to be in New York, which I did. And so I met a girl, Ellen Crooks, I met her in -- at\nthe balle -- in the ballet class, at the American School of Ballet. And she was born and\nraised in Greenwich Village and her mother had a spare apartment. And so she and I moved\nin together to -- in Greenwich Village. And it was wonderful to have her, because I mean,\nshe was -- she knew every little corner of -- of Greenwich Village, having been raised there.\nAnd she was very nice girl -- very good girl and -- and we -- we had -- we lived together.\nWe finally took another -- a girl -- a woman -- a girl, I guess we were then. And we lived\nthere together and where we lived was on Third Street, where now is the library of New\nYork University, the law library of the uni -- and at the time, they were already trying to\nempty the buildings, you know, so there were quite a lot of empty apartments, people whose\nlease had run out and they weren\u2019t replacing these people, because they wanted to empty the\nbuildings, but they had to go to the end of people\u2019s contract. And -- and her mother\u2019s\ncontract was very long. So we were just -- there were a few people left in the building, so it\nwas -- got quite creepy, because there were many, you know, people kem -- kept sleeping\nup on the stairs, you know, bums and -- and hobos and whatever you have there. And it was\nquite an exciting time in Greenwich Village. It was still a little bit of the old Greenwich\nVillage, you know, that you -- that you hear about. Many Italians -- downstairs was a li -- a\nsmall Italian restaurant, that was where our telephone was. He -- he would keep message\nand get messages for us and we could, you know, go and get the messages and we could\nmake calls there. And many, many a time. So -- but it was very nice. I mean, it was exciting,\nscary and nice. I had to learn how to ride those subways. I mean, I came out of Amsterdam,\nafter the war and it was -- I mean, when I got here with the clothes that I thought were very\nfancy -- I had taken my mother\u2019s -- I had some of my mother\u2019s clothes in Holland and I had\nthem remade for the United States. Well I got to the United States and I looked like a spook,\ncompared to the other people in the United States. It was -- there was something going on\ncalled the new look. Remember, they wore these -- these very -- these skirts with many\nruffles, sort of wide with -- with underskirts underneath, sticking out a little bit on the -- on\nthe borders and I mean I looked absolutely -- what I thought was high elegance, I looked\nweird, highly weird. So the first day that we were there, Mrs. Kalinoffsky took me into New\nYork, went to Macy\u2019s and she got me outfitted. I got a new coat -- Pll never forget the coat.\nThese kind of things, you remember.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: She -- she -- she did it, she bought it for me.",
        "A: [had a little money. My father had given my Uncle Bep Person who also lived in New\nYork, who was an announcer with CBS. Especially during the war, we kept hearing him,\nbecause he did the Dutch, the Belgian and I think one of the Nor-Nordic countries. H-He did\nthe news for -- for those countries. So I kept hearing my Uncle Bep Person all the time. He\nworked, as I said, for CBS, for their foreign department, during the war. And after the war,\nhe worked for the United Nations. That\u2019s really what he did, til he died. He worked at -- you\nknow, he was a journalist at the United Nations. He wrote all the news from the United\nNations and he -- he had been an editor of the Haffsupost in the -- in -- in the Hague and he\nhad worked -- always been a journalist, so -- anyway, he -- in 1939, he took his family to the\nUnited States. He -- he had said to the Haffsupost, he says, \u201cI think it\u2019s time that you have in\ninternational correspondent.\u201d And they said, \u201cYes, you know, we -- we like to b-broaden\nou-our news and ti -- cli -- go.\u201d So he had job here, in New York. He was in New York\nwith his family. Actually, he lived in Great Neck, they lived in Great Neck, Long Island, but\nhe worked in New York. And my father had given him a Shell stock to take. And after the\nwar, Uncle Bep wrote me that he had that for me. And, so when I came, I had a little money.\nIt wasn\u2019t tremendous amount, but it was enough, because I went to work, you know. So\nanyway, the Kalinoffsky\u2019s, they would have helped me a lot more, if I\u2019d asked for it. You\nknow, I didn\u2019t want to ask for it.",
        "A: Well, they were friends of my parents.",
        "A: And they -- he decided to -- they were really good friends of my parents and -- and they\nbrought me over. They were the ones that gave me the affidavit and they had two daughters,\nyou know, that were my -- who were my age and I never reme -- and I never forget opening\nup their closet when I first came to their house. In -- then Babylon, I guess. There were all\nthese clothes hanging, these gorgeous clothes and -- hanging in the girl\u2019s closets. And I\ncould not imagine how anybody could have so much clothes. I mean, now I -- you know, I\nthink it\u2019s all normal and every -- but then, I mean, we had nothing, absolutely nothing, you\nknow, during all those years of s -- of underground, the underground. I had a skirt and a\nsweater and a blouse. You know, and here, closets full, all matched things, you know, the\nsweater sets and the -- the skirts that went like the triangles and -- and gorgeous things. So,\nwhere was I?",
        "A: Well, I was not inti -- you see, that was actually one of the funny -- the strange things. I\narrived -- I came on the Queen Mary and I -- I -- sh -- Mrs. Kalinoffsky picked me up and\nshe drove me through New York to get to the Long Island thruway, what -- whatever it\u2019s\ncalled [indecipherable]. And she kept saying, \u201cI'll take you to Broadway the next one --\nnext day, you know, when we go shopping. We\u2019ll go to Macy\u2019s and then we\u2019ll go shopping,\nyou know, and Pll show you New Yo --\u201d I went and I saw New York and I wasn\u2019t\nimpressed. She was very sad. And now I know, you know, that -- there are many people\nwho come from Europe and I take them around. Th-Things change. And they are often not\nimpressed. Now, why is that, ac -- I explain it to her, that I had seen so many films -- I had\nseen so many films of New York, of Broadway and of -- you know, the -- the -- at the time,\nthe man was blowing smoke rings, or the woman, whatever it was. And I mean, it was pretty\nwonderful, but at the time, I -- I wasn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t impressed. I had a very hard time leaving\n-- leaving Europe and what happened was that I flew from Amsterdam -- from\n[indecipherable] to London and it -- it -- this is very normal now, but there weren\u2019t that\nmany planes in 1947. I -- I left in November of 1947. And friends of my parents again,\n[indecipherable] picked me up and I was going to have a week or so in London with them,\nbut what happened 1s that I got a kind of a nervous breakdown. I was shaking and crying. I\ncouldn\u2019t control anything I was doing. I was so upset. I -- it turned out I -- I had left very\nbravely, you know, taken to the airport by my boyfriend and my best girlfriend together,\nthey were -- and I got on the plane very bravely, I walked over there. I had a bunch of tulips\nfor -- for the Ronas with me. And I remember handing it over to them and then breaking\ndown right there at the airport. And I cried for four solid days. I just couldn\u2019t -- and finally\nthe doctor -- I guess I got some Valium or something to calm me down and that was --\nfriend of my Uncle Heinz was there -- actually the brother of Ava Kempfer, his wife -- my\ncousin\u2019s wife, was there and he wanted to take me out, you know. And he took me out and I\n-- he said, \u201cMa -- Your eyes -- what -- something wrong with your eyes?\u201d They were so red\n-- rot -- red and swollen and he took me out and the funny thing, he took me to his club.\nAnd w-we went to his club and they fed me something. I -- I will -- I think 1t was -- I had\nscrambled eggs with ham or some sort of thing and there was something wrong with the\nham and I ended up sick in London from -- from eating that -- that ham and this cousin, he -\n- he had been just wonderful to me. He had saved his clothing coupons, there -- in England,\nand also in Holland, we still, in \u201847, had clothing coupons. And he had saved his clothing\npoop -- coupons and he went to a store with me and he let me choose a blouse or whatever I\nwanted -- it was a blouse -- from his coupons. It was the sweetest thing, and --",
        "A: This wa -- no, this was actually the brother-in-law of my cousin Heinz.",
        "A: His name was Gunther Ver-Vernon. Their real name -- you talk about real name, their\nreal name was Vershenski and his -- his -- they changed their name to Vernon. Anyway,\nGunther Vernon, he saved his coupons -- his clothing coupons for me and bought me a\nblouse. But, the poor guy, he fed me something -- he didn\u2019t, I mean the -- the restaurant\nthere in his club. So, I was sick from that and I was sick of heart, of leaving Europe. I was\nscared to death, you know, really to be on my own in a huge country. I mean, to come from\nHolland, which 1s the first thing the Dutch always say to you, \u201cHow do you like Holland,\nisn\u2019t it small?\u201d You know, this is -- it\u2019s one sentence that they\u2019re saying. Of course now,\nyou know, it\u2019s going to be Europe and it\u2019s going to be bigger, but --",
        "A: Well, I was at a point, you know, where I had to make up my mind what in the world\nwas going to happen to me. I had a relationship, which really --",
        "A: With Otmar.",
        "A: And -- and I just thought I\u2019m getting on in age and I want children and -- you might have\nheard, you know, Otmar did not want children.",
        "A: It was a very important point and I said, \u201cOh, my goodness, you know, I\u2019m getting to be\n22.\u201d In those day, people married pretty early. Not as early in Europe as they married in the\nUnited States, but they did marry pretty early. And I was getting to be 22 and he didn\u2019t want\nchildren. And I was crazy about him. But -- and I think that\u2019s why I had the nervous\nbreakdown, because I just -- I didn\u2019t want to leave him, but I knew I had to leave him. I\nmean -- and that\u2019s how I am. If -- I mean even -- even if it breaks my heart, if I know I have\nto do something, I\u2019m my own protector. I have to take of -- care of myself and that is what I\nhave to do. And so I decided this was a point where I had to leave. Another thing was that\nthe Dutch had not given me citizenship. Now, you have to understand that my mother really\nwas Dutch. She was Dutch, she was born Dutch. My grandfather was Dutch. My\ngrandmother wasn\u2019t, but my grandfather was Dutch.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s mother.",

And when he died, in \u201831, my grandfather, when\nhe died, my grandmother, my Dutch grandmother -- she had become Dutch, moved to\nAmsterdam. So, when things got tight -- well, we actually went to Holland on vacation. I sa\n-- I\u2019m telling that in the other story, we went to Holland on vacation and again this Uncle\nBep, my -- the journalist, he\u2019s the one who said, \u201cDon\u2019t go back,\u201d to my mother.

If I don\u2019t get out of there, I\u2019m going to stuck with Otmar and I\u2019Il never have children.\nAnd the one thing I want, is children. I need something that is my own, my own.

I always\nknew that we were the best. I mean, we were -- you know, and -- and we were just right,\nyou know, my father was -- was an intellectual, he played the violin, he -- my mother played\nthe piano, we always had music. We had wonderful friends, I adored my parents friends.\nThey were all fantastic, you know. That is -- I used to sit around, listen to them talk and they\nwere wonderful, witty, well-based, intellectual kind of talks. And I adored it. I -- I just -- I\nwould sit there and listen and listen. And I -- I would read the books they gave me and the\nbooks that I found and I\u2019ve always liked that. I\u2019ve never been a scholarly person. I\u2019ve never\nbeen as somebody who -- I -- although I like school, you know, history and things like that,\nbut I\u2019ve never been a s -- a real scholarly person. I\u2019m more toward the arts and toward the\ntouchy-feely kind of things and -- but I love to listen and I -- I enjoy that kind of\natmosphere. And amazingly enough, when I came to the States, the Kalinoffsky\u2019s, as\nwonderful as they were, you know, they didn\u2019t have it. There wasn\u2019t a painting in the house.\nI gave a painting to Mrs. Kalinoffsky for Christmas. A painting that was made by somebody\nin Greenwich Village, whom I liked very much, a -- a German girl who was there. She\nnever hung it up. I looked at -- I looked at it. I couldn\u2019t frame it, you know, I couldn\u2019t afford\nto frame it, because I had to pay her -- my goodness, I think it was 50 dollars. And 50\ndollars -- for me to make 50 dollars, I think that\u2019s what I made a week, you know? So I\nsaved the money for -- for this painting and I bought the painting and I gave it to her.

It was because we\nwere thrown into this peculiar situation of being not really at home. You know, I mean, we -\n- we were just -- we had moved to Holland and things were different in Holland, you know\nand we were sort of thrown in a society of people like us.

You moved in somewhere [indecipherable], but now I know that it was a\nnew neighborhood at the time, just been built and that\u2019s why there were so many people like\nus. You know, German Jewish refugees, actually, who lived in that neighborhood. But it\nmade it a very -- it wasn\u2019t strictly like that, but a lot. And so that\u2019s why the Franks were\nthere. And -- and the family of the woman he finally married and -- and -- and you know, I\nmean, just name it. Maria Austria was there, who became my foot -- photography teacher\nafter the war and who also took many of the very beautiful pictures of our family at the\ntime. And I worked as a model for her and for her sister, who had been a buwhouse weaver.\nAnd I wore the sweaters and things she designed and Maria photographed them and it got\ninto the various magazines in Holland. LeBella and some of the other ones. And, so that\nneighborhood was very cozy in -- in that way, because -- and you didn\u2019t feel like a stranger,\nbecause everybody -- not everybody, but quite a few people were like that.

Now I was just a dumb child and I was busy with\nmyself and probably didn\u2019t pay attention. But I never felt like an outsider.",
        "A: Now, this is a very interesting question. I never thought about Jewish. And, to tell you\nthe truth, I -- I have never thought -- unless people ask me and I\u2019m sort of -- stand back and\nlook at it, you know. I really never thought about Jewish. In Holland, I never realized\nanything. People are not -- were not very religious in Holland. They are not very religious in\nHolland. I remember in Sweden, which isn\u2019t quite the same, but still, people were telling me\nth-they were saying, \u201cWell you know, we were really heathens. We\u2019re really heathens,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cWe\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re baptized and we die in the church.\u201d I mean, for the rest -- you\nknow the church. And in Sweden they actually tax everybody a dollar or [indecipherable] a\ncertain percentage, so that the churches can be kept, because otherwise nobody would take\ncare of them, you know? And it -- it -- in Holland, it\u2019s not quite like that, but it is like it,\nquite a bit. You know, religion really didn\u2019t mean much to me, I mean it\u2019s -- it -- it never\nhas.",

He could not see past that, you\nknow? I mean -- and what saved me was that at the time this all happened, I was 16 years\nold. I mean -- I mean in Holland and I was just starting to develop my own little group of\npeople, my -- young people. And they were different. I met Manfred and that was my luck,\ndumb luck. And he was politically interested. Now, he was 19 or 20 when I met him and he\nwas political, but I didn\u2019t know anything about political. One thing I didn\u2019t know anything\nabout was political. I knew we moved to Holland because of Hitler, but otherwise, it was\njust a move for me. And it was a struggle, that first year, to go from German to -- to Dutch\nin school. I was very b -- I mean, I had been excellent at school in Germany.",
        "A: Which was in the same street, actually, or the street next to ours, that I could walk there,\nyou know, to the school. And I came and -- by the way, and this -- this would interest you.\nOne day -- now, I\u2019m talking about Germany now. This was in the second grade. We got to\ntake home a little letter, which said, \u201cFrom now on, Barbara should be in school at 10:30 on\n-- on Tuesdays, because the other children will have religious instruction, which was\nLutheran. And in case -- you know, she doesn\u2019t have to come til 10:30, that\u2019s when school\nstarts. Well, I cried and cried. My father had to sign this little note, that he had gotten the\nmessage and he s -- I -- I said, \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I go there?\u201d And he says, \u201cI don\u2019t know why\nyou shouldn\u2019t go there. You want to go there, you go there.\u201d So he wrote to the teacher,\n\u201cBarbara would like to attend.\u201d Come at nine o\u2019clock, attend to school. So I had religious\ninstruction, Lutheran -- the Lutheran religion. And I loved it. I was one of the best ones\ntelling these stories, my goodness. Bread into wine -- I mean br -- you know, I mean bread -\n- | mean how he fed all the hundreds and I mean, it was just fabulous. I d -- I was a good\nstoryteller and I got my -- the highest grade. I did very well. So, coming to Holland was\nhard for me, because I had to start all over, making my place in the class and -- and trying to\n-- and who was in my class but Margot Frank. And that\u2019s why we got to be so friendly,\nbecause we started the same year, the same day, the same everything, you know. And we\nlived in the same neighborhood, so we walked home together.

My grandfather -- on both sides, my grandfathers, were religious.\nMy mother\u2019s grandfather, I remember him putting on the Tefillen and davnen in the\nmorning. But for the rest, you never heard anything about Jewish. You know, I mean, he --\nhe did that. I think they like, lit the candles on s -- on s -- Friday evening. I think they did.\nI\u2019m pretty sure they did. I think they had Hanukkah and not Christmas, but we had\nChristmas.",

And we had a lot\nof maids and people, you know, and they were Christians and they were mostly Catholics,\nactually. And they -- and I remember also, that they all got presents, we got presents. I\nremember my father saying that -- not to forget to give him money in an envelope, because\nwhen he get -- went to court, there were all the people, you know, at the door of the court\nand the people who worked for him in the office and he was giving presents out, Christmas.\nAnd we had -- definitely had -- I remember that wonderful smell of the pine an-and I\u2019m\nprobably romanticizing it, but I can see it, how it was.",

And she took me with her, to her parents. So, that was in Bavaria and it was\ncompletely, you know, Christian and I have still pictures of that and everything. And I\nwould go -- later, when I had a governess and my sister had the -- the -- her -- Maria, my\nnurse, I resented my sister because of that, she got my Maria. And I got a -- an governess.\nThat governess went to -- she was also Catholic and I remember her -- going to church with\nher, because on Sundays, when my parents weren\u2019t there and she wanted to go to church,\nshe couldn\u2019t leave me home. So I would -- I would go to church with her.

And what it was supposed to\ndo, was protect me during the night, from anything bad that could happen to me. I mean,\nthat was what -- what they did -- what -- what she did.

        "A: Well, he -- he was, of course, born in Amsterdam and he was born at number one\nCulverstrat, which is right across from the palace. It\u2019s a little narrow street, which is now\nnothing but a big junk heap. I mean it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t give you an example of a street\nthat\u2019s like that. One store next to the other and not very classy. But they still owned the\nhouse. The family -- Cargill Zeetroon owns that house and -- and a jewelry store that they\nall came out of that jewelry store. My great-grandfather Ruda -- Ruloff owned a jewelry\nstore, which he, I think had already inherited from his grandfather at number one\nCulverstrat. And that house still is owned by the Zeetroons. It now 1s called Shrapzeetune or\nFundumzeetune or something like that, the store itself, but my cousin Carroll has the upper -\n- is only on the upper -- has an office now only, on the upper floor. He only does antique --\nantique jewelry now. But there were 15 children or 16 children and it was sort of half and\nhalf -- half girls, half boys. And there was, of course, no possibility of all the boys inheriting\nthis business. So --",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s never done. The oldest inherits it and the rest has to, you know. The girls get\nsome help, you know, they get dowries and st -- they got dowries and stuff. But the boys\nwere on their own and it was typical of the times that boys were walking around Europe, the\n-- not just Jewish boys, I mean all boys. Second sons, third sons, fourth sons, you know.\nThey were not inheriting anything. They were on their own. So, my grandfather walked --\nhe had an uncle in Berlin and he walked. He walked first -- he was sent to Borna. In Borna,\nthat\u2019s where the family spunyard came from, and that is --",
        "A: Spunyard -- spanyard -- it was called spanyard.",
        "A: Well, spunyard is -- at a translation is Spaniard. A person from Spain, Spaniard. Well,\nthe spunyard family had a business 1n Borna, which was a mill and they produced cloth\nmaterial, that\u2019s what they did. And he was sent there to learn the business. So there is my\ngrandfather Hendrick in this teeny tiny town in the west -- in the west -- pardon me, in the\neast of Holland. He hated it with such a passion. Now, those people were very religious. My\ngrandfather was religious, he was raised very Jewish, but he wasn\u2019t like they were, they\nwere narrow about it. And so he fled, after awhile and he started going east. And he kept\ngoing east and he told these stories about first he got to Dusseldorf, one of those towns. And\nhe had to have some money. So he took a job with a furrier, and what did he have to do?\nThe furriers would get furs from all over Europe, mostly Russia and -- and -- and the\nScandinavian countries. And he had to scrape the flesh off of the furs, so you can imagine\nthe stink in there. I mean, it was horrendous. And since he was the littlest, because he was\nonly like -- I don\u2019t know exactly his age, but he was very young. And he would be -- the\nbag, because it stank so much, was hung out of the window -- where the scrapes were\nscraped into. And because he was the littlest, he was put into the bag to stamp it down. To --\nto -- to compress that stuff, because he -- because -- then they could put more in the bag,\nthese bags were leather and they were then taken somewhere and -- and emptied, I imagine.\nAnd he was telling these ta -- he --we -- used tell these awful stories, how terrible that all\nwas and he didn\u2019t want to do that, so he fled again and he kept walking east -- east -- east --\neast. There was another uncle in -- in Berlin. And he got to Berlin and that uncle ha -- wa --\nhad a furrier business and he took furs that were already scraped and ready to go, you know,\nto be made into coats. And that\u2019s where my grandfather Hendrick learned his business. It\nwas very -- it\u2019s a very amusing story, because what happened then -- he was quite handsome\n-- he was very blonde, very blue eyed -- sort of a reddish blonde hair. I was called a st --\ncalled a Dutchman. And he was -- there were Jewish families in Berlin that had been there a\nlong time, were very settled and one of them was the Filipis. And they were extremely rich\nand -- and one day the daughter, Ellen, my future grandmother had her 16th or 18th\nbirthday. And my great-grandfather, Louis -- Louis -- Luis, I think his name was -- who\nrode horses and did crazy things all -- all his life, gave a huge party for her. It was a g -- like\na coming out party, sort of -- you would call it now. And he invited every eligible bachelor\nin Berlin to that party. And so my grandfather knew he wasn\u2019t eligible at all. I mean, he was\njust, you know, a poor boy, really, working in -- in somebody\u2019s business. But he heard -- a\nfriend of his told him that there was going to be this great party, in this fabulous house and -\n- and he said, \u201cWell, I want to go.\u201d And the friend said, \u201cWell you have to have an\ninvitation.\u201d And he says, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll manage somehow.\u201d You know, \u201cWe\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll\nmanage it. Just take me with you,\u201d you know. So they rented a suit for him and they went\nand somehow he got in and because he was really very handsome. He was tall and he was\nnice looking and -- and blonde, she f -- Ellen liked him, of all the boys there, you know,\nwith beautiful names, that had been in Berlin for age -- she chose Hendrick Zeetroon. And\nher father, after the party, said, \u201cWell, which one shall it be?\u201d Because he knew that\nwhoever he chose, with all his money, she was going to get. So she said, \u201cHendrick\nZeetroon.\u201d And he\u2019d never heard of him -- anybody like that. It was a disaster. He | -- he\nsaid, \u201cNever,\u201d you know. And she said, \u201cOh, yes.\u201d And she locked herself in her room and\nshe wouldn\u2019t eat and she wouldn\u2019t drink and she wouldn\u2019t this and she wouldn\u2019t that and\nshe had the key and he couldn\u2019t get -- they couldn\u2019t get into the -- into the room. There\nwere lots of sisters in her family and brothers also. But they couldn\u2019t -- he loved Ellen\nbecause she was just as strong as he was. This was my grandfather I\u2019m talking about, Louie.\nAnd --",
        "A: My great-grandfather, yeah. So she won and she married Hendrick. It was a total\ndisaster, but nevertheless, you know, it was a -- she got whom she wanted, and he got so\nmuch money. I mean, now it would be a million and a half -- something like that, dowry. I\nmean it -- it was just tremendous. I have a tape that my Uncle Huntz made. That was -- is\nmy mother\u2019s youngest brother and that\u2019s where he tells this story. And he\u2019s the one where I\nget my figures from. So -- so -- so my grandfather suddenly was rich. And there are other\nfunny stories about the fact that he wanted my -- my great-grandfather said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He\nthought he would win out a little bit by that -- through that. He said, \u201cOkay, if you want to\nmarry him, he has to be a -- he has to become German. You can\u2019t marry anybody but a\nGerman, the Dutch are terrible all day. They have no culture, they have no this,\u201d you know,\n\u201cor that.\u2019 So, he tried to become a German. And -- and they have the papers, the family of\nmy Uncle Heinz has the papers for that. He applied to become a German citizen and my\nUncle Heinz has the answer of the German government to this and they said, \u201cIf you\nactually marry Ellen Filipi and if you have children and if they get to be 18 years old\nwithout any problem with the police or any kind of trouble with business or whatever. And\nif you haven\u2019t had any trouble with business, then you will be allowed to reapply for\ncitizenship.\u201d So they got married.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He -- they were Jewish, but, you know, the Germans considered German -- Berlinners,\nthey considered these Jews -- I mean the Dutch, the Dutch were peasants to them. All the\nDutch were peasants to them. You know, nice little grab bag of -- of peasants.",
        "A: Okay, my father.",
        "A: Okay, let\u2019s go to my fam -- par -- now, my father was born in Hirschbeck in\nAubershlasian, Upper Salasia, in Hirschbeck. Now, I have looked at where that is. I called\nthe German embassy, because when we went -- we\u2019re going to Prague, actually and I knew\nit wasn\u2019t too far from Prague. And I thought it was in Germany. It -- I mean, at the time that\nhe was born, it was Germany. These are these border areas that kept turning -- changing\nnationality. They -- they were -- they were German or they were Polish. Every time -- now,\nHirschbeck actually always was German, but guess what, it\u2019s Polish now. It is called\nYelenagura and it is up in the mountains in the most gorgeous country that you can imagine.\nIt\u2019s a little mountaintop town. I guess it\u2019s bigger now, a lot bigger. But I went there -- the\nlast time that I went there, I was six and a half, seven, sort of like that. That was when I was\nallowed to go walking with them. And I remember how gorgeous it was. I remember the\nfields with the weaving wheat and the red poppies and the blue cornflowers around the\nedges, mostly poppies. It was so gorgeous, with the mountains up there. Anyway, that\u2019s\nwhere my father was born and where I guess his father was born also. I had hoped to go\nthere and when I asked the German embassy, they said, \u201c\u201cWe don\u2019t have -- yes, they said, we\nhave two or three Hirschbecks. Which one do you want?\u201d And I said, \u201cUpper Salasia.\u201d\u201d And\nshe said, \u201cWe don\u2019t own that any more.\u201d After the second World War, it was given to\nPoland.",
        "A: So, it\u2019s now Polish.",
        "A: No, it wouldn\u2019t prevent me from going, but it does put a little bit of -- I -- I\u2019m not\nanxious to go to anything Polish. I -- I don\u2019t know why that is, but I don\u2019t --",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Well, I can\u2019t -- I -- the Germans I can understand, you know. I can\u2019t speak a word of\nPolish. And -- and I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying and I\u2019ve heard nothing but bad things\nabout it. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very strange, because of course, as a European, I didn\u2019t know many\nbad things about Poland, what they did to the Jews and this and that, but as an American,\nnow, I met a lot of people whose descent is Polish and it\u2019s nothing but rotten. You know,\nthe things that you he -- that -- that I hear out of it. It\u2019s of course ridiculous, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not\nall true now, or that there are exceptions, you know, you shouldn\u2019t generalize, but --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

        "A: -- you know, to the opening. And I -- I went through the museum. Do you know -- I\nmean, I knew that my parents died in the ovens, I knew it.

I also think he was religious -- belonged to the -- whatever congregation\nthey had in Hirschbeck and -- and the -- I don\u2019t know how big the community was there.\nBut there obviously was one. The story is that he actually died giving a talk in the\nsynagogue on Rosh Hashanah, which was supposed to be an honor, to die in such a way.\nBut I -- this is his story and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true.",

So that\u2019s\nthe -- that the -- the combination. Kaita was 10 years older than my father. So that\u2019s quite a\nlot.",
        "A: And so, I\u2019ve been trying to find out, you know, how old, actually, my grandfather was\nand my great-grandfa -- and my grandmother. My grandmother I only knew as a black\ndressed very old lady, with a very high hat, with -- with a black sort of drape coming off of\nit -- veil, sort of, coming off of it. She knit a lot of things for me, I remember that, having\nlittle dresses that she knit and -- and having scarves and things that she knit. And -- can you\nturn it off for a minute?",
        "A: The -- the sad thing is that I don\u2019t know much about this grandfather. His -- his name\nwas Benno -- Benjamin Leiderman. And I understand that his father too -- I think his father\n-- my great-grandfather -- my great-grandfather had been a teacher in Hirschbeck. So that\u2019s\nalready, you know, quite a few generations that they lived there. They ha-had a wonderful\nhouse, which I remember, a really old-fashioned German tall house. And my grandmother --\nat the time she was quite old and she had a stiff leg, which has worried me all my life,\nbecause I keep thinking, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to get the same thing that she had.\u201d Which I don\u2019t\nremember quite well what it was, but I know that they s -- made one of her legs stiff,\nbecause that was probably easier on her than -- than whatever she had, you know? They\ndidn\u2019t have so many medical things as they have now. She always had somebody who lived\nwith her and I know that in 19 -- during the time -- when Germany had it\u2019s -- it\u2019s bank\nbreakdown, you know, which was earlier than the United States. I guess United States was\n\u201829 --",
        "A: When -- we -- yeah, this was earlier -- that she lost the house. And I know that my father\nand his sister rented the house, from the person who -- who bought it, for my grandmother,\nso she never knew that she had lost that house. Because they didn\u2019t want her to -- you know,\nI mean those were terrible days. My father was -- was studying in Breslau, I think he was in\nBreslau. Actually, he wasn\u2019t studying, he was interning in Breslau at the time. And he was\ntelling me these stories about how he would get paid at the end of the week and -- and he\nwould get an -- a paper bag full of money and he would run to the store and buy whatever\nhe could buy, you know, in food and things, because if you waited at all, for a minute, that\nwhole bag might buy you one little wurst, you know. That\u2019s how the money went down, I\nmean, the money was just worth nothing in Germany. And -- and I forget now when that --\nwhen that was, \u201822? \u201820? So it -- it was earlier than -- than that.",
        "A: It was before he got married, yeah.",
        "A: And he got -- he got married in \u201824.",
        "A: His mother? Okay. That grandmother that I\u2019m telling you about --",
        "A: -- with the stiff leg --",
        "A: Her name was -- was Lutcia -- Lutcia -- Lutcia Schachtel. Her name was Schachtel -- a\nschachtel -- ein schachtel is a box, you know. You carry a box of groceries. This is ein\nschachtel, it\u2019s a bo -- a carton, actually -- a carton.",

It\u2019s\nreally strange how little I know. So, from that side of the family, my Aunt Kaita, my -- hers\n-- my father\u2019s sister married somebody -- they lived in Posen, and Posen -- I used to know\nthe Polish name of it -- but in Posen -- Posen also kept changing from Germany to Poland,\nfrom ger -- and it -- they moved each time, they stayed in Germany. Whatever -- whatever\nwas German, you know, they stayed in. But -- and she had one son, I think and that\u2019s was\nmy Uncle Heinz -- my cousin Heinz. I called him uncle because he was so much older than -\n- his mo -- he was my mother\u2019s age. And my father was sort of a father to Heinz, because\nher -- my Aunt Kaita\u2019s husband died very young. So this Uncle Heinz had two sons and I\nam in contact with both of those. So they lived --",

        "A: Yeah. So he\u2019s still working hard. And my Aunt Ava, Heinz\u2019s wife, just died. She was 82\nand she just -- she lived in Holland -- she lived in amst -- in the Hague and I was very fond\nof her. She was really the nearest relation in the sense that she had the German as well as the\nDutch experience, the same as I had. And I remember her coming to Holland. Heinz came\nearlier and he went back to Berlin and married her and brought her and I remember her\ncoming, the day that she came.",
        "A: In 1936.",
        "A: We were th -- we were there in \u201833 and she came in \u201836, but Heinz had already been\nthere since \u201833. He came -- he was very close to us, because my father was sort of his best\nfriend and his father, you know?",

        "A: You would like to hear the story?",
        "A: Okay. I hope I don\u2019t make mistakes in them, but -- because I wasn\u2019t there. The story was\nthat -- that Heinz and Ava were still able to bring all their things from Germany, so they had\nbeautiful furniture and lovely silver. Ava came from a very, very well-to-do family. And it\nwas her brother with whom I went out in London and who saved his coupons for me.",
        "A: Ava\u2019s brother, Gunther. His name was Gunther. She had two brothers, they both were in\nEngland. And okay, so Ava and Heinz lived in the Hague and it was very interesting,\nbecause Heinz worked for a German company in Berlin and that German company, when\nthey saw things were getting tight for the Jews, sent him to Holland and he worked in\nHolland for this same company. And believe it or not, after the war, he worked for that same\ncompany, in Holland. And he became a vice president and had a wonderful life.",
        "A: It was -- it had something to do with iron and smelting and metal and that kind of thing.\nHe traveled all over the world and was a great collector of oriental art, mostly Japanese.\nAnd after he retired, he became extremely well known because he -- there\u2019s a small group of\ncollectors all over the world, of these particular things that he was collecting. And he wrote\nmany articles in the -- their papers and in their -- in their journals and magazines and that\nwas the interesting thing about that side also, of the family, how very artistic -- how very\ninternationally artistic they were. They all were like that -- I ver -- 1t was really amazing\nbecause Ray -- th-the son, who lives 1n Israel, he\u2019s also like that, he\u2019s also collecting and\nhe\u2019s also, you know, very interested in history and in -- in -- in that whole oriental art. And I\nremember Heinz coming to visit in -- in Washington, when we still lived up there in -- in --\nat Chevy Chase and he went to the Freer gallery the director knew him, you know? The\nhead of the gallery knew him -- his name, anyway and he took him down into the stacks and\nhe saw -- my hus -- Marty went with him -- my husband Martin went with him and so he\ntold me how they saw things that was never -- you know, that was never, or hardly ever\ndisplayed, because the Freer never had enough gallery space to display. No museum really\nhas everything that they have. So Heinz was qu -- he made quite a second life for himself\nafter he retired. Okay, what happened to them in the war was that they had friends who\nhelped them go underground and who also took all their things and hid -- with them and\nkept it for them. And Heinz and Ava were underground with a farmer, who had a big farm\nsomewhere in -- in Holland. And they could not keep Ray with them. Ray was only year\nand a half, or two -- something like that and they had to hide Ray. Now Ray was very\nJewish looking, different from them, actually. Heinz looked a bit like you and Ava was --\nyou couldn\u2019t tell what she was. So, but -- but Ray had quite, you know, he had a definite\nkind of darkness, which in Holland you don\u2019t see much. And he was hard to hide and he\nwas very little. And so, somehow the underground managed to hide him and just recently --\nI thought -- I thought that he\u2019d only been in one place the whole time. But just recently Ray\ntold me that he was in many places, that he was handed around, you know, in many places.\nAnd that he felt -- was -- really had a terrible time, til the very end, the last people ended up\nbeing absolutely wonderful. And he\u2019s still in touch with them and he still ta -- you know, he\n-- he -- when their children come over here, he takes care of them. I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t mean over\nhere, when they ever come to Israel. The Dutch like to go to Israel, so they do come. And\nwhen he goes to Holland, he always visits that family. And 1t was most amazing how close\nthey really had gotten.",
        "A: But he was such a little -- I mean, h -- pardon me?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, exactly. Must have been the last year -- the -- the last year, but he\nsaid that -- that in one place, the people hated him. I mean, they were so awful that they\nburned him with cigarette burns and -- and all sorts of -- you know, he just had a terrible\ntime. I have heard that in Holland, people were really wonderful. The ones I met were all\nwonderful, you know. But I\u2019ve heard that there were really quite difficult thing -- for\ninstance, the mayor of Amsterdam, he -- he wrote an article and he describe -- he was in 10\ndifferent places, he -- he was handed from one place, he couldn\u2019t get along -- you know, he\nwas already a little older, so he had ideas. And in this one family, where he was -- I\u2019m\ntalking about the mayor of Amsterdam, the -- the ex-mayor of Amsterdam. It was his\nbirthday and they didn\u2019t say anything about his birthday, and he knew that they knew it was\nhis birthday. And it happened to be that in their religion, you don\u2019t make a fuss about\nanybody\u2019s birthday.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. But it -- but that was 1n their -- in their particular brand.",
        "A: And so he couldn\u2019t -- he was a little boy, you know, and he couldn\u2019t keep his mouth\nclosed, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday. You didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d And they were so angry at\nhim. They were so terribly angry and he was already so lost and so -- you know, he -- this\nall came out when that hidden child business -- he was one of the hidden children. And he\nreally had, also, it -- it was the first time that I realized what happened to some of those\nchildren. They were much worse off than I. I mean, you know, I was the perfect age, I\ndescribed that off the tape.",
        "A: It -- but the hidden children, oh my God.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- that\u2019s very interesting, because Ray -- when r -- when the war was finished\nand Ray got back to his parents, it was extremely hard. I mean the --I -- he must have\nrealized that these were really his parents, you know? But I think he was afraid. He never --\nhe didn\u2019t have a very nice youth. Another thing was, that for Ray\u2019s generation, there were\nreally no Jewish kids, or very, very few Jewish kids his age alive. Th-There weren\u2019t any.",
        "A: Well, in Holland.",
        "A: In amste -- in, sorry, no, in the Hague. And he was extremely careful and -- and a bit\nworried always. And then he looked so Jewish and -- and there weren\u2019t anybody else around\nthat looked like him.",
        "A: Now, he has a brother. Now let\u2019s --",
        "A: \u201846. The year after the war ended. The guy has been a meteor. I mean, he shot up, you\nknow. He was beautiful, he was tall. He looks like Prince Charles, exactly. Handsomer, I\nmean. He\u2019s younger. And he -- he had millions of friends. He was easy going. He knew, in\nshort, from nothing, you know? From -- he knew nothing of what Ray went through and his\ndepth of experience, and -- anyway, Ray has a lot more soul than -- than -- than Steve has.\nYou know, it\u2019s built in, one way or the other. And he\u2019s doing -- he married somebody who\nwasn\u2019t Jewish, whereas Ray -- in Holland, as I said, there were so few Jewish people. So\nwhat they did was, they got the young generation together once or twice or three times a\nyear, in a particular place.

        "A: Oho, that\u2019s an understatement. So -- so one day the Germans appeared.

So, Ava was --\nthe underground came, took Ava and hid her somewhere else. They hid her with a farmer in\nthe south of Holland, in -- in Zout, Holland and Heinz they took to Westerbork, which was\nthe collection camp, before you went to the east. And in that collection camp, there was a\nfriend of his named Otto Bierman -- Otto Bierman.",
        "A: B-i-e-r-m-a-n. Otto Bierman and Otto was a very intelligent man and he had convinced\nthe head of the camp of Westerbork that he could produce something that would make him -\n- this -- this head of the camp -- ingratiate him with -- with Hitler and his upper -- the upper\nechelons. He said -- and -- and the man -- an-and he said, \u201cWell, what would that be?\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cYou know, what is it that the German weremarkt really needs? One of the things it\nneeds is toothpaste.\u201d Now Otto Bierman was a chemist and so the -- the commandant said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, can you get it together?\u201d And you know, and, \u201cWhat do you need, you\nknow, to do this?\u201d And Otto gave him a list and this and that and -- and he said, \u201cWell, I\nwill need so many people to do this, to produce whatever you need, which is quite a bit.\u201d So\nI forget how many people it was, but one of them was Heinz and that saved his life, because\nhe was still there after the commandant was gone, you know, at -- at the -- when -- when the\nwar was over.",

Because Heinz of course, he was in a Straffbabacker, which means in one\nof the punishment barracks. One of the barracks that had an S on it for punishment.\nto -- to have someone like that in your life, who had -- who was so responsible for saving\nyour life?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how to -- to -- I met Manfred -- this 1s rather interesting. I -- I told you I\nknow nothing about politics. Here I am 16 years old and I describe in the other tape how\nwhen you were 16, you were considered a family on your own and you needed your own\nstamp of -- of security, so you wouldn\u2019t be taken away. Th-The Franks went, for instance,\nOtto Frank, the Franks went underground when Margot got called up to be sent to so-called\nwork camps, right? Well, to avoid that situation, to not be called up, you needed to work in\nsomething that the Germans considered essential. Up to 16 years, your father or mother,\nwhoever in your family worked for one of those organizations, like the Jewish -- the\nYoteserrat, th -- some kind of organizations that the Germans recognized as necessary. Do\nyou get that?",
        "A: So -- well, my father, for instance, had one of those stamps, he was a translator for the\nYoteserrat, for the Jewish organization that really oversaw the shipping off -- the organized\nshipping off of the Jews to the east.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes. So -- but that\u2019s not what the Germans told him they were doing, you know, that --\nthe Germans told them that they were helping their own people and things like that, you\nknow they -- so -- and they would re -- that -- that they would remain after everybody else\nwas gone and this and that, which 1s all nonsense, because everybody went. But this -- this\nis hindsight. You know, it\u2019s very stran -- it\u2019s very different to look at something from the\nhistorical point of view --",
        "A: -- than when you\u2019re in it, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to -- what the future will hold. So\n-- what were we saying?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, but how did I get to the Yoteserrat? Oh, there was an organization in ea -- 1n\nthe east of Amsterdam, which was called -- and I have na -- now I -- totally escape. It was\ncalled Hershelsander -- Hershelsander. And it was supposed to be a culture -- Jewish\ncultural organization that would train Jews to be ready to go to Israel or some other country\nso that they could have a craft or a -- a profession that they could use. It\u2019s one of those hoax,\nnonsense, idiotic things that the Germans thought up. And that organization, it so happened,\nthere were lots of Communists 1n it. There were lots of people that -- that had -- maybe they\nweren\u2019t really Communists, but they had a political opinion.",
        "A: And they knew about things before they happened, you know? And th-they had some\nkind of a view. They had some people that came from Germany, for instance, out of the\ncamps, the early camps, you know, in \u201840 -- in -- in 39, \u201840, who told stories about what\nwas really happening in Germany, what -- what wasn\u2019t written in the press. And these\npeople were knowledgeable and one of them was Manfred. I didn\u2019t know anything about\nthat.",
        "A: I met -- my father managed to get me a place to work in that particular organization. He\ndidn\u2019t -- also knew nothing about them. He only knew that that was one place where he\ncould get a secure place for me, becoming 16 years old.",
        "A: So I went there. What did we do? We organized courses -- for instance sewing, cooking,\ngarde-gardening, I guess. I mean se -- landscape -- land -- lundbow as they called it. You\nknow, something to do with the earth, agriculture -- agriculture. However, we also had\ncourses on Moliere and Shakespeare. Well, in the course on Moli\u00e9re, I met Manfred. I -- I\nwas working there and he was working there -- or he came there to take a course, I can\u2019t\nremember, maybe he wasn\u2019t even working there, but he knew the people. I didn\u2019t know the\npeople, but he knew the people that were working there. This was an organization that really\nhad been there before and was doing the same sort of thing. It had to do with the Allia, you\nknow, the -- the s -- the people who were just wanting to go to Israel. I guess Zionists or\nsomething, although these people were no Zionists. But -- but they were training -- this\norganization had been there before and the Germans just took it over and used it as what I\ndescribed, an organization [indecipherable]. So what I did was draw up the names of the\npeople who wanted to take the courses, make up schedules for courses. Get the prou -- help\nget the professors for the courses and that kind of thing. You know, that\u2019s was my job.",
        "A: Had nothing to do with anything for the German. So anyway, I met Manfred in there.\nAnd I was 16 - 17, ?\u2019'd never had a boyfriend, never gone out, never anything. You couldn\u2019t\nride the trolleys, you couldn\u2019t ride the bus, you had to walk. So -- being Jewish -- so --",
        "A: No. No -- no trolley, no bus, no nothing. So I had -- we had the yellow star and maybe I\nhad a bicycle, I -- I can\u2019t remember. We -- we could bike for a long time, but then -- then we\ncouldn\u2019t even bike any more. So Manfred and I started -- I mean I started walking home or\nriding bike home or whatever it was, I can\u2019t remember details.",
        "A: And we\u2019d started getting together, you know, doing that and I got to meet him and I\nreally liked him and he really liked me and so that was my first boyfriend. And that\u2019s how I\ngot involved with this whole thing.",
        "A: And he knew more than I knew.",
        "A: And he started telling me all these things.",
        "A: And he\u2019s -- I -- I -- I s-suddenly started seeing beyond my parents. My father said, \u201cIf\nyou get called up, you have to go, because oth-otherwise we will get punished.\u201d It\u2019s\ndifferent from -- from Margot Frank, you know, where her father said, \u201cIf you get called up,\nwe -- we go underground.\u201d My father was -- at the time, he was -- he was born in 1889, so\nin four -- in -- in \u201841, how old was he?",
        "A: Yeah. He was getting on. And he -- he had already had to make or that -- that move from\nGermany to Holland, it was too much for him, he couldn\u2019t do another one. And he knew he\ncouldn\u2019t do another one. And when my mother, who was so much younger, started to talk\nabout going underground, he couldn\u2019t face it.",
        "A: So that was the -- the situation. And so Manfred started talking about all these things and\nmy eyes -- my head, you know. And so I -- I started believing him, I started looking at\nthings through his eyes and through -- I saw things I had never seen before. You know, I\nsaw people going on trains with singing and Manfred said that they get killed. And they said\nthey were going to go to work, and sit around a campfire at night. And, as difficult as it was,\nI started to believe him. It didn\u2019t seem likely, you know, what they were telling me. And\npeople -- young -- other young people started coming and telling me stories and saying, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want to die.\u201d I remember my -- one girlfriend, Zucker, her name was -- her last name\nwas Zucker, with a Z, you know, like sugar, in German. She came to me and she -- she said\n-- she sat there crying in my room, I can see her, you know, a little woman -- little girl, 16.\nSaid, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die, I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d I didn\u2019t even think -- I never did think of\ndying and I didn\u2019t then. I don\u2019t know, they were taken away. I -- I don\u2019t know if she\nsurvived, or what.",
        "A: How did you f --",
        "A: Oh, since the war.",
        "A: Yeah, well.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: But we lived together -- I mean we lived together in a group. We lived together for years,\nafter all. And it is strange, and I\u2019ve seen it in other tight situations. When the war was over -\n- now, from a personal point of view, toward the end of the war, I knew I was not going to\nmarry Manfred and we were talking about marria -- he want -- he wanted to get married and\nI knew I couldn\u2019t marry him. And it had partly to do with the fact that he kept telling me\nthat my father had killed my family. And what he meant was that he didn\u2019t want to go\nunderground. My father -- Manfred offered -- he -- he offered the papers and my mother\nsaid -- got -- got him the money. My mother had the papers. Manfred said even if she hadn\u2019t\npaid, he would have gotten the papers, because he could not -- he would have had a bad\nconscience all his life, he wouldn\u2019t have done for them what he did for me, you know.\nAlthough I didn\u2019t get my first papers through Manfred. I got my first false papers through\nother people. But my mother gave me the money for it. And she had to ask my father for the\nmoney and my father did not believe in this. But my mother put her foot down. And she\ndidn\u2019t do that very often. She became the strength of the whole family. And she loved\nManfred. And she kept telling me, \u201cStick with him, he is strong, he is true. He -- stick with\nhim, stick with him.\u201d And my sister loved him. She was younger than I was and she kept\nsaying how wonderful he was. And I was worried about him. But he -- he was wonderful\nand he did save my life, but I never really thought about that til way afterwards. I mean,\nwhen you live your life, you live your life. And I did the cooking and I did the cleaning and\nI worked very hard, so did he -- I mean so did we all, so did his sister, who turned out to be\nas important -- maybe not more important than he was. He -- after the war, as I said, I -- I\nknew I wasn\u2019t going to marry him and we split up. I lived -- went to live somewhere else. I\nhad met Otmar through Manfred, really. And although I wasn\u2019t sure there was any future in\nthere, I lived by myse -- I went and got an apartment somewhere else, which was great luck\nthat I could even find anything after the war. And then of course, my Uncle Paul came back\nand Heinz came back and they were the two anchors, you know, that I had, even though\nthey were so busy with themselves, you can\u2019t imagine. After having all this happening to\nyou, that to try to pick up the normal strand of normal life was not easy for people who had\nfamilies and for anybody else as well. And I went, immediately, I was already in the ballet\nthe month before the war was ended, I immediately went into the ballet, which took all my\nmind and all my strength. We hadn\u2019t had any food. And to work as hard physically as I had\nto work, took all I had and a bit more, you know? We started to have a little bit better food.\nIt took a long time for the food to come in. And although I had not been as hungry as most\npeople had for as long -- because in the end we were very hungry, I still was really\nunderfed. And I\u2019ve heard it said that my generation of dancers, did not last physically as\nlong as most generations last.",
        "A: I mean that -- yes, that was a phenomenon of -- of the times, yeah. So, as I say, I went\nand lived somewhere else and -- and Manfred, he was unhappy, but he soon, you know,\nfound -- he also felt he had to go on with his life and he had -- and he found somebody else\nand he had two children. And although the marriage didn\u2019t last, you know, very long and\nManfred started messing around. He\u2019s always told me, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault.\u201d He --\nevery time he sees me, he says this, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault.\u201d He\u2019s been married several times,\nthree, four. So -- so, but the last 20 years he\u2019s had the same wife, much younger and very\nnice and I stayed with them last year. I h -- I stayed with them and it was funny, you know,\nthe first and the last of his wives -- the so-called wives. We had a lot of fun.",
        "A: Well he -- even before the war was over, he knew what he w-wanted to do. He wanted to\nstart a factory of women\u2019s clothing. And he started collecting sewing machines. Now I had\none and that was the first one. Yeah, I had one from my mo-mother and that was the first\none. It wasn\u2019t electrified and he got a motor and -- but he -- he found -- he bought -- he went\naround looking for sewing machines, even before the war was quite, quite over. And he\nknew that he was -- wanted to -- wanted to do that. And he knew where there was a -- a\ncache -- I mean a number of -- a cloth that was difficult, you know, to find. There wasn\u2019t\nany material, there was no cloth. And this se -- first wife he married, Maurecia, she had been\nin that business and she knew how to do it. And she was a great help to him. That was part\nof their getting together, because she -- she was really knowledgeable in that. And she also -\n- because she had lost a great deal -- I forget what -- what she had lost, but she got at some\nmoney and she got some money from the government -- from the amer -- Dutch government\nas well as the ger -- I -- I can\u2019t remember, but she got a lot of -- she got some money and he\nneeded the money. We did strange things, you know. After the war, they had money left\nover, my -- Manfred, I don\u2019t know what he did, but there was money. Now, there was no\nway to explain this money. And I -- I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know anything about it. But\nthe only one who could have had some money was me, you know, because I -- I could have\ns -- you know, I could have had some money from my parents, from jewelry that was sold,\nor this or that. And so you had to take in this money and get the new money that -- the\ncurrent money that they were putting out. And so I did that for them, even though we\nweren\u2019t together any more. So I -- I kept in touch and I did -- you know, I went there and I\ns-signed saying this was my money and you know, stuff like that.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",

And I couldn\u2019t --\nwhen I went to sign the contract, I couldn\u2019t do it, because they didn\u2019t pay me enough to pay\nthe rent and to buy my shoes and to eat. So, I didn\u2019t sign for it. So I ended up -- and in the\nother shows that I tried for and I got chosen for each one I tried, there was either the star\ndropped out and they couldn\u2019t raise all the money that they needed, or something else\nhappened, some contract fell through or some kind -- some of them I even started rehearsing\nand we had to stop because something happened with the finances or something like that.

        "A: Oh yeah, it was terrific. But -- but -- and it was very adventurous, I mean, gosh. You\nknow, we lived on a train and we ate in the -- and we -- I made enormous money, because I\ndidn\u2019t spend a nickel. I wanted to save for when I came back, that I had some money. And I\nhad the apartment, so -- so that\u2019s what happened, that, you know, I got back to New York, I\nhad a lot of money. And then I took a job at -- was it Macy\u2019s? Yeah, I as -- guess I took a\njob -- Christmas job at Macy\u2019s. So -- and there I made a fortune, because they put me -- they\ngave me a job -- you got a bonus for always being on time. You got a bonus for not miss-\nmissing any days. And you got a bonus for -- they put me to sell difficult merchandise.\nMerchandise that had some kind of a damage to it. For instance, I was selling a paint set for\nkids that was -- you put -- there -- it had a brush, it had some liquid and it had paper, that\u2019s\nall that was in the box. But when you stuck the brush in the liquid and you went over the\npaper, all sorts of colors and pictures came up. However, should you by any chance drop a\ndrop of this liquid on the floor, it would eat the rug. So this was merchandise that was\ndifficult to sell, because they had to put a warning on it and they did put a warning on it. So\nthe people who bought it knew that, you know, there was no doubt about it, Macy\u2019s did the\nright thing, except they should never have bought the stuff, right? And I sold that. I sold a\ndoll that ha -- was dangerous for kids, because it had some kind of a finger that stuck out or\nsomething, that might get into some kid\u2019s eye. So there was all sorts of merchandise that\nwas -- that was dangerous to s -- or -- or did something, or didn\u2019t -- and for each piece that\nyou sold, you got credit. So, I tell you, I did all those things. I ran every morning. I had to\ntake two subways or a bus and a subway, or something like that to get there. 34th Street and\nI lived on East and this was 34 --",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t mean job. People didn\u2019t jog in 1950.",
        "A: In 1950. No, I -- or \u201849 it was. No, I ran up the elevator, which wasn\u2019t running, you\nknow? And just trying to be on time. And I did, I was there. I made a fortune that Christmas.\nHowever, it was also a terrible Christmas for me, because the Kalinoffsky\u2019s had a house full\nof people and couldn\u2019t have me. And I was lonely to such a degree, I -- I can\u2019t describe it. It\nwas too absolutely horrible. It was absolutely horrible. And -- so I had a lot of mo -- but I\nhad another one of my really going kaput, you know, situations and you had to give an\nemergency number on your application and a buyer who was very nice, he was very nice to\nme and he called Kalinoffsky, who had been my emergency number and Kalinoffsky came\nand said he wanted to talk to me and stuff and -- so we did meet. We met for lunch or I went\nover one -- after Christmas they had a time that I could come to their pla -- and I always felt\nso beholden. Is he all right?",
        "A: Oh good. So -- so I always felt so beholden, I didn\u2019t want to ask them for anything. And\nso, at the -- and he talked to me and he said, \u201cYou know, I wonder if you still think you\u2019re\ngoing to go back to Holland?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I am thinking that.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t think\nit.\u201d He -- and he started explaining to me about Otmar. He said, \u201cA person like that -- face\nhim with it. You have to know that he really doesn\u2019t want to get married. You have to know\nthat,\u201d he said. He thought that was the case. But I should know it and I should hear it from\nOtmar. If I had it in the back of my mind that maybe we could get married, and maybe he\nwould give in to having children, you know, he said, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to settle down\nhere. And you have to make up your mind.\u201d I had not gone out with anybody, during this\nentire period. I mean, I kept thinking. I -- I don\u2019t know what I thought, but I just didn\u2019t want\nto, you know, make any kind of commitment or even date, so that I might make a\ncommitment or some -- and he -- so I did. I wrote a letter to Otmar and I said, \u201c\u201cOtmar, I\nwant you -- want to know, you know -- I -- I really ha -- what is the situation?\u201d And I got a\nletter back and I\u2019m -- again one of these letters, you know, with a lot of prevarications\n[indecipherable]. Is that the right word? You know, with -- with a lot of not saying one thing\nand not saying yes and not saying no and not -- you know, what he -- what either way he\nwas, you know? Not being able to make his mind up about anything, so -- and it was a\nterrible loss, because he was a psychiatrist and he wouldn\u2019t join any group in Holland. I kept\nthinking, you know, he should join a group and be a part of something, but he\u2019s never done\nthat in all his life. He -- he is now 80 some years old. He\u2019s never, during all his working life,\njoined up with anything. He always was working alone. He always did this and did that. He\nnever made up his mind about anything and [indecipherable]. And I -- I saw him -- when\nMarty and I went to Holland, we went for -- on sabbatical. We were in Holland for a year, in\n1960. We already had all the kids. The youngest one was seven months. And he came for\ndinner, he -- Otmar did, in -- in the Hague. He lives in Amsterdam and we were in the\nHague. And he came for dinner and he said to me, he said, \u201cI should have left Europe long\nago. I should have gone with you. I should have -- you know, I should have made changes\nand this and that,\u201d he said he just couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t do it, [inaudible]. So, you\nknow, he never really changed. And he married somebody who could not have a -- children.\nShe had one son and she had some kind of disease, she couldn\u2019t have another.",
        "A: Yeah. So, and he\u2019s not had an easy life, because she\u2019s been very sick all the time with\nthat disease, you know, that she had right from the beginning. And he became something I\ndid not really like very much. And I -- I said to myself, you know, \u201cOh, what luck, what\nluck. Oh, was I lucky.\u201d You know?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Probably not.",
        "A: But, I mean, I must have had some kind of insight. Well, I don\u2019t know, I was so in love,\nwhat kind of insight can you have when you\u2019re so in love? But I just knowed it wasn\u2019t good\nfor me.",
        "A: Huh. Good question. Well. Huh. No, I think that -- that -- I think there\u2019s a whole other\nangle to this. Otmar was German and my father had always adored everything German and\nhe always spoke about the good Germany, you know, when the things went wrong, he kept\nsaying, the humanistic tradition and how he was raised and everything he knew was from\nGermany and that all the good things that he was came out of Germany and, you know, that\nyou always have to choose -- my father said, with what you pick up from any kind of\ncivilization. And that if you pick the good things, you\u2019re very lucky, you know, if you can\nhave a peaceful life, which he didn\u2019t, of course. And Otmar was the good things in\nGermany. And he was German and somewhere in my background, there was this belief that\nGermany was the best. That the good things of Germany were better than anything --\nanything or anyone else in the -- any -- anywhere. That must have been in my li -- in my\nhead. And that must have been this -- that gave me this enormous, you know, attraction.\nBecause there were many things about Otmar that were very bad. I mean, first of all, I think\nthat basically he was a little anti-Semitic, here and there. [indecipherable]. And -- and he\nwould never believe that, but I -- I -- it wasn\u2019t that obvious, 1t came out 1-1n various things,\nyou know? The person he worked for, in the beginning, after the war, who really helped him\nlike crazy, [indecipherable] the boss, who really let him work for -- in his practice, and who\ngave him a chance to get established in Holland -- in Amsterdam and -- and the remarks\nabout Coon were not nice. They might have been partly right, but they weren\u2019t nice, because\nthey were based on being Jewish rather than on being the person that he was.",
        "A: You know? And that\u2019s not the way to judge anybody. And I -- that sort of worried me. I\nmust say that that kind of sort of worried me, because I knew Coon very well and I knew all\nhis good things, especially his wife, with whom I\u2019m still very friendly. And -- and very\nattached to, actually, Magda. And it just --",
        "A: She still lives in Amsterdam. And that worried me, it worried me. I thought if -- if -- he\nalso -- I think he had a hard time taking me to see his family. Now, at the time, of course, it\nwas right after the war, he couldn\u2019t have gone anyway, to Germany. He was a deserter. His\nfamily, you know, his family was good and would have accept y -- anything and was happy\nthat he was alive and there and all that. His family wasn\u2019t like that at all -- was not Fascist or\nin any way. But -- but I don\u2019t know, deserting is another thing. And coming with a Jewish\nwife, to Germany after the war, eh. All that worried me. I thought, a life, a whole life and a\nchild, maybe that was half Jewish? These things have changed. I mean, the next generation,\nit would have been all right. As a matter of fact, I think 1t would have been a star in his -- in\nhis crown. But the first generation, no.",
        "A: And maybe it worried him more than it would have worried his people, you know? But\nhe was already insecure from -- from what he -- what he himself had done. He couldn\u2019t go\nback to Germany for many years after the war. I don\u2019t know when the first time was that he\ndid go back to Germany. Anyway, so as I say, it was -- it was not what you were saying --",
        "A: -- but it was more Otmar himself that --",
        "A: -- that worried me --",
        "A: Who sent --",
        "A: -- th-th -- again the vague response and that\u2019s when I said to myself, \u201cIt is no.\u201d",
        "A: I -- [have to go on. I mean, now I am 24. I\u2019m -- you know, you get, you can\u2019t -- you --\nyou -- or 24 yeah, was 24. So I looked in the paper and I looked for a job that was going to\ntake me out of New York. And there was a job, with a cosmetic company, who was\ndemonstrating -- wi -- who needed demonstrators and who was going to train in New York,\nand then sent you out. And that seemed like the perfect solution. They were paying during\ntraining, enough for me to eat and to pay my rent. And they were going to pay a lot then,\nplus percentage, after you were trained. And that\u2019s what I did. I -- I went to work for this\ncompany -- cosmetic company, who isn\u2019t -- which name I have forgotten. And they were\nselling creams for your hair and -- and lotions and brushes and combs -- with particular\ncircular brushes and combs, which was new then. And I had the perfect hair for it. And I\ncould speak -- I had an accent, m-more than now.",
        "A: No, like this.",
        "A: But it -- my accent was an advantage, because people were going to listen to this accent.\nSo, I had to -- di -- di -- you got a lamp, you know the company would get a lamp that was\nfocused on you and you would give a speech about the combs and the brushes and the hair\nand answer questions and stuff. And the first place they sent us, because they sent two\nwomen together, always. After the training -- I trained all over New York. I was at\nGimbel\u2019s, I was at Macy\u2019s, I was at something Strauss -- Abraham Strauss, was it?",
        "A: Yeah, and I was at another one and I was in Brooklyn, was the first time I ever made --\nset foot in Brooklyn and I was all over New York. And then they send us and the first place\nthey sent us was Baltimore, and we were a huge success. I mean, I sold enormous amount of\ncomb -- and because we were a success, we stayed and stayed. And I got to know the buyer\nof the department, who was a Jewish fellow and I -- and he was very nice. He said, \u201cYou\nknow, you were here so long, you really should be doing something with your evening,\nsomething useful. And aren\u2019t you lonely?\u201d And I was, because she was a gal who\ndisappeared after work. And she had no interests that I had. And so he took me, one time,\nfor lunch. He wasn\u2019t allowed to fraternize, you know, anything. But he took me to a place\nthat during the day was a small restaurant where they -- very small, they don\u2019t have small\nplaces like that, hardly, any more, where they made sandwiches and stuff. And at night, the\nstudents from the various universities in Baltimore would come and play chess and he had\nsome music and once in awhile he had somebody to talk and stuff. And my hotel was not\ntoo far from there. I could walk it and I could go there. And I met some people from the\nvarious universities. And I met some people who were in the acting sections and stuff and\nthey said, \u201cGee, it would be nice, you know, why don\u2019t you come and try out?\u201d And I said,\n\u201cT can\u2019t, because I won\u2019t be here long enough.\u201d Well, after six weeks, they sent us to\nCincinnati. And we get to Cincinnati and she of course, 1s gone at night and I decided\nmaybe I should see something of Cincinnati and stuff and there was a fellow in the\ndepartment, who said he knew some people. Well, it turned out to be German -- ex -- ex-\nGermans -- immigrants and they took me to a beerholla -- a beer hall and stuff and I -- I\nhated it, I couldn\u2019t tell you how I hated it. You know, they were all locking arms and\nsinging, ah, la la la la, you know, and these beer songs and I thought, \u201cThat I need? I don\u2019t\nneed that,\u201d you know? I mean, I could have gone back to Germany and had that -- the real\nthing, it wouldn\u2019t be as obnoxious as this. So I telegraphed the guy in Baltimore and I said --\nhe had said, \u201cIf you want a job, let me know.\u201d This -- the buyer at the company. And I said,\n\u201cTs there still a job? Do you still have a job and if so, could you let me know?\u201d And he --\ntelegraphed back, \u201cJob available, arranged for you to come and you can stay with so and\nso.\u201d A woman in the department who was just divorced or something, has lots of room and\njust come. And I came. That\u2019s how I got to Baltimore, of all places, you know. And --",
        "A: Well, I did, because these people from the university, of course they saw me again and\nthey said, \u201cCome and try out for a play.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m a real actress, I\u2019m a -- I was a\nprofessional, I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d And they started explaining to me about amateur\ntheater in -- in the United States and come on. And -- and I said, \u201cAnd my terrible accent,\u201d\nand they said, \u201cOh well, you know, we\u2019ll find parts that are just right.\u201d So I went and I tried\nout for Moli\u00e9re\u2019s \u201cSchool for Wives.\u201d \u201cSchool for Wives.\u201d It had a wonderful director and\nhe didn\u2019t take me, because of my accent. He said, \u201cThey\u2019re going to listen hard to try to\nunderstand you and they won\u2019t hear the play.\u201d And it\u2019s like a Broadway thing, had it just\nbeen a Broadway thing, because the girl that he did choose did -- got sick, couldn\u2019t make it -\n- he didn\u2019t want to have -- he was mid -- in the middle of rehearsals, he didn\u2019t want to have\nanother audition. He called me and said, \u201cIll get somebody, the Hopkins Department of\nLinguistics has said they would help me, come and do the play with us.\u201d And I did. And\nthat\u2019s where I met a lot of people I liked, you know. And all my age and -- and it was just\ngreat. I was just a little older than they.\nbased on the fact that you had been through the experiences in Europe that you had been\nthrough and the Americans that you were with had not?",
        "A: Yes. Oh, yes. The answer is yes. And it was the first time there that I had -- when I\nstarted meeting me -- boys, you know? That\u2019s when I thought, \u201cThis 1s impossible. I can\nnever marry an American. Never.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, because the people -- it so happened that a couple of the -- the -- the fellows I met,\nhad been just on the cusp, you know, of the -- of the age that did -- didn\u2019t go into the war.\nYou know, weren\u2019t old enough to be drafted or to get into the war. And those were the --\nmy first acquaintances. Fraternity kind of fellows. And I used to laugh. They would wait for\nme outside my apartment, when I came back from work. And I would see them standing\nthere and I would laugh, I would laugh. This is ridiculous. I mean, I\u2019m a woman -- I\u2019m a\nwoman and I am a grown-up, I\u2019ve -- you know, these are so innocent. They\u2019re so damn\ninnocent. It\u2019s impossible. I can never, never, never get together with them. I could never\nfind a level on which we could talk together as equals. I don\u2019t mean intellectually, but even\nthat -- I mean, you know, they -- they had no idea about anything. About arts or anything\nabout theater -- about the war they had completely wrong notions, just completely wrong. I\nhad to explain everything. You know, it just didn\u2019t work, no, it didn\u2019t work. And that was,\nof course, also Baltimore because in New York it was a little better, although there I didn\u2019t\ndate very much either. But it just -- 1-it was just so -- they were so childish.",
        "A: Th-The males -- the males in Baltimore, the ones that I met -- and I wanted to meet -- I\ndidn\u2019t care whom I met, you know, whether were Jewish or not Jewish.",
        "A: They were just too -- too childish, too -- too immature. They -- I mean they were just out\nof rah-rah high school and college, you know? Football kind of guys. Even though I met\nsome very intellectual. I met Russ Baker. I met, you know, I met -- you know, the people\nwho were the same age -- actually, he went to school with Marty. He was very nice. He was\ncertainly an intellectual. But he wasn\u2019t -- had never been allowed to really show it. Cause\nthe girls wouldn\u2019t take it.",
        "A: You know? It took him awhile. And he actually had a girl. He was between, you know,\nhaving broken up with her and coming -- going back to her when -- when I dated. We didn\u2019t\nreally date many times, a couple times. But -- but it really was -- he was very nice, he was\nthe best of them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It -- it - it\u2019s just -- I just -- I met him, you know, Marty and I, when Marty got his Nobel,\nwe -- we met him several times. And I said, \u201cDo you know that you and I had a couple of\ndates?\u201d He couldn\u2019t remember and -- and I could remember, because he was -- you know, I\nhad been following his -- his writing. And it -- 1t ma -- left no special impression, except he\nwas a bit more, you know, when he knew he could re --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: He couldn\u2019t remember and -- and I could remember, because he was -- you know, I had\nbeen following his -- his writing. And it -- it ma -- left no special impression, except he was\na bit more, you know, when he knew he could relax and actually talk about something.\nSomething more than football or baseball, which he had no interest in. And the-then -- you\nknow, he -- he relaxed.",
        "A: They -- they were good from that point of view. They -- they were -- they were good\nfrom that point of view. You know, the boys didn\u2019t want to talk about the war. That was --\nthat was -- that was really one of the things. Well, I didn\u2019t meet that many, you know, that --\nthat I could really -- that\u2019s why the circus was interesting, because they were Europeans.\nThere were some Arabs, North African. There were -- there were various Germans, quite a\nfew Germans. There were, you know, people who had really been through things, that it\nwas, in a way, a bit of home, you know? I felt more, like belonging and -- and we were all\nsort of footloose and fancy free in a strange country. That gave me a feeling of home and\ncomfort in the circus. But American boys, no. I mean your average -- your average\nAmerican boy, it was just impossible. Now, what happened was, was that the one fellow\nthat I -- I got to know quite well, after awhile, he had to go to -- to bloom -- to go for his\ngraduate school. And he told Marty -- he had taken Marty to see me at \u201cSchool for Wives.\u201d\nAnd Marty had a girlfriend then and you know, there was no reason for us to get together.\nAnd -- but when he left -- when this Danny left, to go to Bloomington for his grad school,\nhe told Marty to come and see me. You know, check up on me once in awhile, til he was\ngoing to come back Christmas, or he was going to come back Easter. But -- but Marty\nshould go and see me. So Marty came to see me and I was deathly sick. He\u2019s always telling\nthis story and I'll tell it very fast. He -- Marty -- there was a knock on my door and Marty\ncame in and I was so sick I couldn\u2019t get up. And he couldn\u2019t believe it. I had a nice place, in\na brownstone on Charles Street, near Mount Vernon Place in ba -- in Baltimore. And Marty\ntook one look at me and touched my head, knew I had a fever and he went home to his mom\nand he said -- there was nothing in my refrigerator, he looked in the refrigerator and there\nwas nothing there. So he went home and said to his mom, \u201cI need food. I need a pot of --\u201d\nAnd ma -- his mom had a pot of chicken soup. So he took some of it. His -- his parents had\na grocery store. So he took so-some food from the store and he took some what his mom\nhad and he came back and he fed me. And from then on, you know, I was his -- his -- what\ndo you call it? His --",
        "A: Patient, yeah, sort of. And he kept coming back and -- and making sure, you know, that I\nhave food and that -- that ge -- I mean, I couldn\u2019t move, I was so sick. You know, I was -- of\ncourse I had something from the war. I mean -- for instance, when I had my first child, my\ngums just erupted, I had -- they -- they ended up painting them purple, because you know, I\ndidn\u2019t have any vitamins, you know, nothing during my last growing spurt. You know,\nbetween 16 and 18 you cans still grow. You know, I had no food. So there was something,\nyou know, innately wrong with me. So, I wasn\u2019t quite as strong to resist some of the bugs\nthat were going around and Marty had a friend, Helmut Sonenfeld, whose parents had both\ncome from Germany, they were both doctors. And when they got to Baltimore, they placed\nthemselves -- they went, bought a big house in a black neighborhood and they treated the\npoor. They said, \u201cWe survived, we have to do something back.\u201d",
        "A: Their name was Sonenfeld and they were two doctors from Germany. They had two\nsons. One of them was Helmut, who ended up as the sidekick of Kissinger, especially --\nwell, that\u2019s -- Marty knew him from -- I think from Hopkins, but maybe even before that.\nHelmut, you know, is a rush -- a specialist in Russia, an expert and still very important. I\nthink he teaches at the school of international something or other in -- in Baltimore. And\nHelmut -- Marty called Helmut and said, \u201cI have this German girl who -- or Dutch girl who\ndoesn\u2019t have a cent and who 1s deathly ill. Would you ask your parents?\u201d And they said,\n\u201cYes, bring her.\u201d\u2019 And so these parents, I mean they did everything. They -- they checked\nme over, they knew that I nearly had pneumonia, you know. They got the medication, they\nbought it, they -- they really babied me. They really took care of me. And I didn\u2019t like\nHelmut. Helmut and I didn\u2019t get along. I -- I never did get along with anybody from over\nthere. When I first came to -- to New York, the friends of my parents, they had heard from\nthe Kalinoffsky\u2019s that I was there, they got all their sons, you know, to come, because the\ndaughter of Dr. Leiderman, you know, I mean, it should be terrific and stuff. And so I got\ninvited to these fancy houses, all around New -- New York City and out in the -- out in the\ncountry, you know, Larchmont and all those lovely areas. Connecticut, upper Conne --\nlower Connecticut and stuff and it was awful. There were all these fancy things. Boys --\nyoung men, who had been in the United States forever, as far as I\u2019m concerned and who\nspoke with an accent thicker than mine. I mean, it was just horrible. I mean, I said to myself,\nif I have to live in the United States, I\u2019m going to marry an Americ -- marry and American.\nAnd one of the big shocks, when I finally got into this Hopkins group, was the split between\nthe Russian Polish group and the German group. Now, I naturally should have belonged to\nthe German group, but I despised what they were standing for. It was so horrible. After all\nthe things we had gone through as Jews -- of course, they didn\u2019t go through anything, but I -\n- you know, I was not going to make -- I knew that it didn\u2019t help you to make a difference\nbetween Jews. I mean, you were a human being, you were a Jew, you were a German Jew\nand you were a snob? I can\u2019t tell you what kind of expression I would like to use, but it\u2019s a\nbad one. I was very angry at those Phi Ebs, which was the Jewish fraternity -- the German\nJewish fraternity and the other ones, which Marty belonged to. His parents -- you know, I\nmean it was just awful, I despi -- and I got telephone calls. I got calls saying, \u201cWhat are you\ndoing, going out with those people?\u201d",
        "A: With the -- with the Polish Russian group of Jews.",
        "A: Yeah. They were -- they were calling. And Marty doesn\u2019t believe me, but that\u2019s what I\ngot. And I couldn\u2019t stand it -- and I couldn\u2019t stand it and I went out with one boy who was --\nhe was an architect and he had left that group for a long time and he was German Jewish\nand -- and he -- I was very fond of him, but he was highly neurotic and everything. And he\ntook me to see his parents. And I had dinner there and I could see these parents, they didn\u2019t\nlike it. I mean, I didn\u2019t have any money. And that\u2019s what they were after, even though they\nwere [indecipherable], they were very rich. You know, but it was the idea that class came\nnot from you, as a person, but class came out of your pocketbook.",
        "A: You know, and I had to laugh, because all their parents and grandparents had been\ngrocers and -- and whatever they were, you know, which I didn\u2019t give a hoot what they\nwere, I only cared what kind of person they were. And here my parents, you know, came fr -\n- I mean, I felt like I was much better than they were and -- and they were saying, \u201cWell,\nyou haven\u2019t got a --\u201d Well, at the moment I didn\u2019t have any money. And s -- it was lucky. It\nwas lucky. I was just lucky. Because I decided I was going to go with something strong and\nthe Polish Russian ones were the strong ones. And when -- when Marty came and we started\ngoing out and we were very careful, because this was -- this friend of his was his best friend,\nDanny, who went to Bloomington. And hi -- I guess Marty had dated several of ma -- of\nDanny\u2019s ex-girlfriends and Danny wasn\u2019t happy about it and he was very careful not -- and I\nwas very careful. Course, I didn\u2019t want any trouble, you know, in anything. So finally\nDanny called and said he couldn\u2019t come home Easter, because he had to take care of his\ndrizoffulla flies, which is a -- for his research. He says, \u201cI can\u2019t let my flies die.\u201d",
        "A: Yes. Marty came over that day and he said he\u2019d had a note from Danny saying he was --\nand I had had the same letter. And he said, \u201cYou know, Barbara, that\u2019s just too bad for\nDanny.\u201d We were going out for three months. All we did was ever hold hands, vaguely.\nAnd I felt like such a child, I thought. But Marty, you see, had been in the war. Marty had\nbeen in the Pacific. He\u2019d lived over -- he\u2019d lived in China for eight months. He had seen\ndifferent people, he had been together -- thrown together with all these people, which Danny\nhadn\u2019t and other people that I went out with, didn\u2019t have. And Marty was much more\nmature. Much more mature. And he was a couple of years older than -- than most of the\nothers, because he\u2019d been in the war for two and half, three years, you know\u201d? So he was not\nso childish.",
        "A: No. I\u2019m 0 -- three months older than him.",
        "A: We were exactly the same. And -- but -- but he was older than these guys I happened to\nhave met, you know? And he was -- having been in different surroundings, having seen the\nsuffering -- the Chinese were suffering like crazy when he was there. And having seen\nhunger and having seen all that, you know, he -- he was much more mature -- much more\nmature. And he had interests, and he was interested in a mature way, in what I wanted to do.\nAnd sport was okay, but it wasn\u2019t anything that interested him very much. And so we -- we\nreally -- you know, we had the same political outlook. We had, for instance, I lost a\nboyfriend in New York, when we -- I first was in New York, because he voted for Dewey,\nyou know? I mean, I could not see even voting for Dewey, I\u2019d -- oh, let\u2019s say voting not for\nRoosevelt party. So I sent him away, I sa -- and this was a good deal, this guy. But the\npolitics were important to me. After living in Europe, you know and -- and -- and seeing the\nthings that happened in Europe because people did not care, the intellectuals did not care\nabout politics and did not -- they thought it was below them, you know? So -- so Is -- I\nthought, people have to care about politics.",
        "A: What do you mean? Not invo --",
        "A: Yes, oh yes. I think that in the beginning, even Germans who were good -- really great\npeople, good people, they did not involve themselves. Well, you didn\u2019t talk about politics,\nthat was for -- I don\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t classy. It just wasn\u2019t done. You know, I mean intellectuals\ncared about intellectual things and politics was not intellectual.",
        "A: Well, maybe I\u2019m wrong, but -- but this is my impression.",
        "A: My father never talked about 1t. My group -- the whole group never talked about it. I\nknew about Hitler because I heard the maids talk. I heard my governess talk. I heard Maria,\nmy -- the -- the nurse talk. I heard the cook, the -- you know, I heard all these different\npeople talk about Hitler in the house, when my parents weren\u2019t around. Because I remember\ntaking a walk, I was six years old, we were out in the country. We\u2019d had whooping cough\nand -- and it was terrible, there was nothing to be done about whooping cough. And so they\ntook us out of Berlin, into the country, into the clean air and we lived at -- on a farm for\nabout two months, because my sister and I both had -- my sister was very ill, I wasn\u2019t so\nterribly ill. And that\u2019s where I heard everybody talk. All these people were with us. And I\nheard them talk. And I remember taking a walk with my father and they were talking about\nelections coming up and I said, \u201cI know,\u201d I was ru -- jumping around. \u201cI know who you\u2019re\ngoing to vote for. You going to vote for Hitler.\u201d That was the only name I knew. I didn\u2019t\nknow any other name. And why I remember that, I think because my father must have\nshook me or something. But it stuck in my head, that I was so stupid. That I was -- was\nsaying that. I must have gotten punished for it or something. Or anyway, told not to -- my\nparents didn\u2019t tum -- punish. But they must have told me very definitely, that 1s not\nsomething -- you know, we talk about around -- you know, not to talk with the s -- help or\nsomething about puli -- politics or something. There was some reason I remember this\noccasion. This was when I was six. Anyway, I -- that\u2019s my -- my view of it. Yes, I think that\npeople didn\u2019t want to think about it. People who were, in any way, intellectual. And -- and\ndidn\u2019t have to be involved in politics, you know, it was a profession -- it was a profession.",
        "A: Well, th -- be -- I was not involved in anything. I never was involved in anything. I\u2019m a\nmember of the democratic party now. I don\u2019t think I was until we got here, you know? But I\nvoted democratic.",
        "A: In \u201885, yeah. And then -- and here there were some people who -- you know, I didn\u2019t\nhave the kids to -- or anything to -- to think about and so I started to sort of reach out and\nfind a few new things that I was interested in and somebody came to the door, actually and\nasked, you know, what our -- well, we had to register to vote and I\u2019ve always voted. There\nhasn\u2019t been a time that I didn\u2019t vote. When we were in Holland, I used to go to Rotterdam to\nvote, with the, you know, your absentee ballots and when we were in Switzerland we voted\nabsentee ballots, you know. We -- we always -- I always voted. And when Marty gets\ndisgusted -- and he does, nowadays -- get disgusted with, you know, always voting against\nsomething, rather than for something, I say it doesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t vote at all, it\u2019s for\nit, rather than against it and it\u2019s better to vote again -- you know, it just -- you have to vote --\nyou have to vote, it\u2019s so in me. I can\u2019t -- I -- I -- the kids -- \u201cYou\u2019ve got to vote. You don\u2019t\nvote, I don\u2019t vote, I don\u2019t talk to you.\u201d I mean all four of them. \u201cYou -- you vote. You\u2019re --\u201d",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, oh yeah.",
        "A: Well, you know, we had children all over this country because Marty and I got married\nin Baltimore and we immediately went to Seattle, the next day. We -- we took off for\nSeattle, where he was going to be working on his Ph.D. He asked me to marry him -- he\ncame out to Long Island because I was there to do a show. I was doing -- dancing and acting\nin a show that was playing out on Long Island. And he came there and he said, \u201cDo you\nwant to marry me?\u201d And I had just gotten the first agent interested in me and my partner,\nwho was a girl -- we were -- she had very black hair, she reminded me of my sister, you\nknow? Very black hair, white skin. And I had blonde hair and blue eyes and we were a good\ncouple and we danced together very well. And he wanted us as a couple, you know, to\ndance. And Marty came and asked, \u201cDo you want to get -- marry me?\u201d And I said -- I\nthought to myself, I\u2019m 23, you know -- I\u2019m 24. Yeah, I was 24. I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and --",
        "A: And we married -- three or four marries -- I went -- we went back to Baltimore after the\nshow --",
        "A: I said yes on the spot. I's -- I thought to myself, \u201cYou know, you can think about this and\nyou can think about this and --\u201d you know, I wanted -- I was sure of one thing, I wanted\nsomebody that I was starting with. I didn\u2019t want anybody who was already -- had a lot of\nmoney, that I would have had to say thank you to. I didn\u2019t want somebody who was a lot\nolder, because I had a boyfriend there in -- in Baltimore that I was very fond of, but he was\na finished person. He was already 41 or 40 or something and I was 25. So I -- and that was\nthe same as my parents, 15 years different, and I said to myself, that\u2019s not good. So here was\nthe perfect thing, I mean he was -- he was starting on his graduate school, so I would have to\nwork, we would start this thing together. And I liked him. But, you know, it wasn\u2019t what --\nthis overwhelming feeling that I had had with Otmar or anything. But, I thought, he\u2019s the\nbest guy. I could -- you know, I liked him very much and he -- so I said yes. I said, \u201cYes,\nthat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d So when I got back to Baltimore, I went to a shorthand and\ntyping st -- school, to do shorthand and typing, because I knew I had to go to work. I\ncouldn\u2019t count on acting or dancing or -- and it\u2019s exactly what happened. I got a job before\nhe got a job and we went to Seattle and we were -- we were there, he did very well and --\nand we -- we were there for about three years. It took four years to get your Ph.D. in those\ndays, takes longer now. And that was the ideal circumstance and -- and that was four years.\nSo I worked for three years or even longer. I worked up to the day that Paul was born. And\nwe had nothing -- we had very, very little money and we were happy as clams because we\nlived in a community of students, and -- and who were all pregnant with -- five of us\npregnant at the same time. And Marty was doing tests to see if he could figure out whether\nwe were g-going to have boys or girls.",
        "A: Well, they thought there was -- he -- at the time they thou -- now, they have, of course,\ngreat things, you know, but -- but at the time they thought maybe a saliva -- you know, a\nurine or something. We all did the tests and the only one that was right was mine. So the test\nwas not a good, de-definitive test. So, anyway, I had Paul in Seattle.",
        "A: \u201853. And I had done a lot of acting in Seattle. There was the theater at the university, the\n-- the -- our own theater, we started a theater of our own. And we had -- I mean I did a lot of\nacting, next to my full time job, which was downtown in a bank. And okay, in -- so that was\n\u00b053. In \u201854 Marty graduated and we moved to Urbana, Illinois for two years and that\u2019s\nwhere I had Susie. I did a lot of acting in Urbana. Acting and dancing.",
        "A: She was born in \u201854.",
        "A: Well, December 30th. I mean, you know, just about -- hanging on. Good tax deduction,\nshe was. And then in -- the next one -- Andy was born -- oh yeah, in \u201856 we moved to\nBethesda. We lived in Silver Spring, actually, but that\u2019s when he went to NIH. He was at\nNIH for -- we went to NIH and that\u2019s where he stayed. So Andy was born in \u201857 and Philip\nwas born in \u201859, December \u201859. And that was our house, that was it. And then in -- in \u201860,\nwe went to Holland for a year, on sabbatical. And that\u2019s -- you know, that was terrific, I\nmean that --",
        "A: Okay, well, that was most amazing, because --",
        "A: That was my first time back, so that was what -- I -- I left in -- in \u201847, November and I\ngot back in \u201860, I guess July or August it was. July, maybe. And my Uncle Huntz, my\nmother\u2019s youngest brother, who had gone to Israel after the war -- he also has a great story.\nAnyway he we -- he ended up as ambassador from Israel to Holland, cause he was Dutch\noriginally, you know? So he spoke Dutch, so they sent him to Holland. And he was there in\n1960, when we came, in -- as ambassador, with my Aunt Ruth and his daughter -- their\ndaughter Alliane and of course, they had other kids, but they stayed in Israel. And so it was\ngreat. They had gotten a house for us and we looked at the house and it was dark and\nmiserable. So we looked further and we found a wonderful house on the ocean. Many dunes\nin front of it -- I mean you\u2019re not right on the ocean, you can\u2019t see the water, but it\u2019s the\nnearest thing you can get to -- to the water. And we brought a girl from -- from America to\ntake -- help take care -- a young girl, six -- 16 - 17, who\u2019ll take care of the kids. And then we\n-- we hired somebody to cook and to -- to clean, because I wanted to do photography. My\nUncle Paul is still alive, he\u2019s a painter.",
        "A: I was doing portraiture, landscapes, things like that.",
        "A: I was -- I was selling them, but not in Holland -- not while I was in Holland. I was just\nworking with people in Holland and I found wonderful people to work with right near us. I\ncouldn\u2019t go back to Maria Austria, who -- who had been my teacher, because that was in\nAmsterdam, but near the Hague, there was a friend, Veekmon was her name and I worked\nwith her. And it was -- and I had a dark room in the house. It -- it was fantastic. I worked\nvery hard. I finally got to -- he really -- and my Uncle Pa -- 1t was a wonderful -- 1t was a\nfantastic year. What happened was that Marty really was in Brussels that year, for six -- for\nsix months and we -- we were going to be in Brussels and my family then, Heinz and Ava\nsaid, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, you know, you\u2019re going to be in bru -- in Europe for the first time\nwith all your kids, we want to see your kids, you know. Don\u2019t go to Brussels.\u201d You know,\nthen -- this too far. So, the house that we had was just two blocks from them and that was\nreally nice. I mean it was -- it was unbelievable to be back in Holland with my own kids. I\nshopped in the same stores for them. I took them to Amsterdam, of course -- we were in the\nHague. But I had known the Hague very well. Uncle Paul was in Vosinar, which is -- which\nis between the Hague and Amsterdam. I mean, it was -- for me it was one of the best years I\ncould ever remember. I mean, imagine I went to stores in Amsterdam, met some company\nwhere we used to shop and -- and there was -- an aunt of mine was sitting there, and -- was\nan aunt of my mother\u2019s really, was sitting there. \u201cBarbara,\u201d she says, \u201chow are you?\u201d I\nmean, this doesn\u2019t\u2019 happen to me in the States. I mean, it was just -- 1t was a wonderful year.\nI -- I ended up -- we -- you know, I had so much family that was still living there and many\nof them are dead. My uncle\u2019s dead, his wife is dead. You know, and etcetera. My cousins\nare alive. So I do go there and I visit with them.",
        "A: Yes, I met everybody, of course.",
        "A: Yes, I me -- we went to see Manfred and on -- the funniest thing was Marty, my\nhusband, because I had -- he had -- always wanted to hear stories about Europe and the\nunderground and this and that and I had been telling him these stories. And I guess he\nbelieved them, but you know, it was so colorful. I had -- I mean, my uncle who was a\npainter and who knew everybody in the art world. And the -- and -- and my -- my dancing\nbuddies and my -- and then, when we came to Holland, Marty had never been in Europe. He\nhad been 1n the Pacific in the war, but never in Europe. So this was his first time. He met all\nthese people and every bit of it was true. As a matter of fact, you know, he could flesh it out.\nIt was more colorful than he had ever thought, you know. He met my uncles and my -- my\ncousins and my f -- my family and my friends. All the underground people were then alive.\nHe met Coon and he met Magda and he met Maurecia Austria, the photographer that I used\nto work with, he met her husband, he was still there, that husband. And -- and he -- he met\nManfred and his cu -- then wife, Maria. And he met their chil -- I mean, it was just -- for\nhim it was like a picture gallery opening up.",
        "A: Well, he -- they weren\u2019t --",
        "A: -- they were all born here.",
        "A: But originally they were Polish, yes. His grandfather -- his grandfather was the one that,\ngran -- and grandmother. His grandmother was from Lithuania. His grandfather was from\nWarsaw. And they met in the United States, so already Marty\u2019s father was born in -- in\nBaltimore. And his mother actually was born when his family -- when her family moved\nfrom Poland to -- to -- I guess it was the United States, but she was born in London, on the\nway. And she was three when she came to the United States. It was a funny thing because\nshe never got the American citizenship. Because it was past the time that when you married\nan American, you would get American citizenship. And she never -- she said -- she always\nsaid -- you know, we asked her to come visit us in Europe. That\u2019s when all this came up.\nShe wasn\u2019t a citizen, she didn\u2019t have a passport. She says, \u201cI\u2019m as American as anybody.\u201d I\nmean, she\u2019d never been anywhere else. She was three years when she came. So she was\nvery proud of it and she would not take the test. She says, \u201cI don\u2019t have to take a test, I\u2019ve\nnever been anywhere.\u201d It was funny as heck. She -- you know, she\u2019s -- although she\u2019d never\nbeen in a -- in Poland, she was -- she had all the sort of behavior, you know, that -- that\ncomes from the east. You know, th-the kind of bit of superstition and -- and nothing bad,\nyou know, just -- just the kind of thing. She cooked like a whiz. You know, and it tasted\nbetter than anything I\u2019d ever eaten. You know, she -- she -- I don\u2019t know what she did,\nprobably chicken fat we -- we think now. But it was wonderful. And her baking, it was\nheaven. So -- so -- so as I say, she came when she was three. So his parents really, you\nknow, were Americans. They had been born and raised here.\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: -- tasted better than anything I\u2019d ever eaten. You know, she -- she -- I don\u2019t know what\nshe did, probably chicken fat we -- we think now. But it was wonderful. And her baking, it\nwas heaven. So -- so -- so as I say, she came when she was three. So his parents really, you\nknow, were Americans. They had been born and raised here.",
        "A: Well, you know, he got very friendly with my Uncle Paul. And Uncle Paul would take\nhim places, I couldn\u2019t always get away and he would take him places, so he met a lot of\nPaul\u2019s buddies -- you know, his painting buddies and his co -- his other buddies. People\nwere alive then, who were older than my Uncle Paul, you know, and who -- who are real\nclassics, now -- whole groups of Dutch painters. And --",
        "A: Well, it was -- 1t was because of all the -- he finally saw it all and took it in, you know?\nWe traveled. We -- we -- because we had help with the children, so we could travel and we\ntook a big trip. We drove, you know, around and we -- we went south. We actually drove to\nVenice and took a boat to Israel.",
        "A: Yeah, because my Uncle Huntz, you know, he -- he was -- wait a mi -- was that in \u201861? I\nthink it was \u201861. Huntz was back. Why was Huntz back? I think it was \u201861? Or was that in\n\u201867? We were in Geneva twice and I da -- I can\u2019t keep it quite apart from each other. I think\nit was \u201861. Now, why would Huntz be in Israel in \u201861?",

        "A: Huntz -- si -- cr -- Hanan Cidor -- he\u2019s in -- in Israel he changed his name from Huntz to\nHanan, which is spelled H-a-n-a-n, Hanan. And s -- and he -- from Zeetroon, citron, from\nZeetroon, he changed it to Cidor, C-i-d-o-r.",
        "A: d-o-r. That means nothing. That -- that\u2019s just a name, Cidor.",
        "A: Well, he worked for the government and you should have an Israeli name. It wasn\u2019t just\nthat he worked for the government, he wanted to have an Israeli name.",
        "A: And that\u2019s what he did. So he changed it -- of course, again, he was not religious, but I\nremember when we were in Holland in \u201860 or \u201861, he -- we -- the first boy born after the war\nin the Jewish community, was Bar Mitzvahed at 13 and this boy was Harry -- Harry\nZeetroon. So in my family, the Zeetroon family. And Huntz -- Hanan Cidor, who was the\nambassador from Israel to the Netherlands did the officiating at it. He wasn\u2019t the rabbi, but\nhe officiated at it, he was the representative of Israel, he was -- he wa -- he was the official\nmaven there. And that was quite an occasion. I mean, the first boy Bar Mitzvahed. And I\u2019m\nactually surprised, because what happened to my cousin Steven, who was born in \u201846, if I\u2019m\nright, what is that? \u201c46 and 13.",
        "A: So -- \u201859 -- so he should have been Bar Mitzvahed, he must have been the first. This was\n\u201861. So I don\u2019t know what -- what the situation is. Maybe he wasn\u2019t Bar Mitzvahed,\nalthough I can\u2019t believe --",
        "A: It\u2019s possible that he wasn\u2019t Bar Mitzvahed.",
        "A: It was very interesting. And we went to it, of course, we were invited. And Hanan was\nnot at all religious and so was that whole government in the beginning, wasn\u2019t -- 1n Israel,\nwasn\u2019t religious.",
        "A: So, was nothing special, but he knew what to do, you know, he was ri -- I mean they\ntrained him to be representative of Israel. And so --",
        "A: Okay. Well, when I had Paul, that was my first one, that was in \u201853 and again, I had a\nbreakdown. I had Paul -- Paul was born in May. May sixth, 1953 and I had no trouble\ncarrying, I was very nauseous at the beginning and I got Vitamin B shots and then I had -- I\nwas member of group health of Pugeot Sound, which is still in existence and one of the\noldest of the group -- group health. It was a wonderful organization at the time, just terrific.\nAnd I had my baby in their hospital and it was very difficult, took a long time. He had the\ncord wrapped around his neck and stuff. But after I had him, the -- you know, how the first\nthree days, before your milk comes in and all that? I had a real breakdown, because I\nsuddenly started missing my mother and started thinking about my -- th-this was like a huge\nshock to me. I mean, there wasn\u2019t anybody who really cared, I thought. And there was\nnobody who cared about my baby, you know and me, that I had this child. It meant nothing\nto anybody, except myself and Marty. And I cried for three days and they -- they tried\neverything at that hospital. You know, they finally took me out of the room -- I was with\nfour -- three other people. This was very helpful, actually. They were all experienced\nmothers, I was the only first timer and they took me out and -- and they talked to me and\nsaid, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d And I remember that I said to them, \u201cNobody cares. I have this child,\nwhich is so special and my family --\u201d and my -- in my Dutch German family, this was\nsomething fantastic, when you had a child. I mean, it was rare, people didn\u2019t have so many\nchildren. Here, people had a lot of children, in my generation, they didn\u2019t have many\nchildren and -- and -- my mother\u2019s generation. And I -- you know, and I cried and cried,\nnobody cares and my mother and that was -- you know, I wanted my mo -- my parents in\nthe worst way. And -- and they said, \u201cBut you have a wonderful husband, I mean he\u2019s -- you\nknow, very -- he\u2019s everything anybody ever would want and -- and you know, he cares --\u201d\nand they tried everything, you know\u201d? But what -- 1t was a physical change as mu -- now I\nknow, it was a physical thing as much as a mental situation. And when the milk came in, I\nsettled down and by the time I went home -- in those days, you stayed five, six days in the\nhospital and by that time, Marty\u2019s mother and father had come. And that was very helpful. I\nwa --",
        "A: They drew -- they drove.",
        "A: Baltimore, yes. They had -- they took -- a fa -- his father was retired then and they drove\nvery slowly across country, stayed in various places and then they -- me -- they\u2019ve had it\nfigured out just right. And they -- and she -- people said, \u201cWe asked, are the Rodbell\u2019s\nmoving? Because your mother-in-law emptied out this little house that we had and put\neverything out in the grass and cleaned the place.\u201d She was a fabulous cleaner, I never\ncaught up --",
        "A: yes.",
        "A: Yes, well, when you say house, you know it was -- th-the University of Washington had\n-- all the universities were packed after the war and they didn\u2019t have housing for their\nstudents and -- grad students or anybody, and -- not enough. And there was this influx of\nsoldiers, you know, re -- people who came back from the army and they -- we finally got a\nlittle house and this was -- the army -- the officers houses from the army. So these were\nshacks, you know, they were shacks and -- and we had a-an entrance that had a stove in It.\nNow, let\u2019s see -- gee, I guess it was already the real stove. It wasn\u2019t the barracks, it was a\nlittle house by itself. And it just had a living room, that had a kitchen along it -- a Pullman\ntype kitchen, you know? One bedroom, a small bathroom. I guess it had a shower, it surely\nhad no bath and -- and a closet. I think -- that was all it was. So that was -- and the furniture\nwe bought at the Goodwill, you know? But it was -- looked very nice. And all put together,\nyou know, different things. If I didn\u2019t like something, I put -- I bought a piece of cloth at the\nmaterials she -- at the shop and put it over it. You know, decorate it over. But she cleaned it\nall, you know, by the time I came home, that was spic and span, whatever there was of it.\nAnd they stayed in a hotel -- I mean, they couldn\u2019t stay with us. So she cooked and she took\ncare, you know, and she saw Paul and they saw it, so -- for -- that was very nice.",
        "A: Well, yes, we got along, but not we -- not very much. They also would have liked Marty\nto marry somebody with some money and some -- you know -- I think they were\ndisappointed. I\u2019m sure they were, yeah. She didn\u2019t take care well, of my things. You know, I\nhad rug -- I had some -- some Or-Oriental rugs and they got wet in the basement and they\njust threw it out. They didn\u2019t know what was good, really. And -- but they -- and what they\ndid was, they went into my -- into my trunk and they got out the pictures to see about my\nhistory and stuff. They didn\u2019t trust -- they also sent somebody to my -- before we married,\nthey sent s -- a d -- they ha -- they asked somebody to go see my uncle -- my Uncle Bep\nPerson to see what kind of family 1t was. You kn -- if it was true, what I had told. I mean,\nhere was this girl, alone, living thi -- and there was no family with it, nothing. [doorbell]\nThis I have to answer.",
        "A: Ah, never. Well, no that\u2019s not true. I was trying to get a death certificate, because I\ncouldn\u2019t inherit -- I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t lay claim to anything. Not that there was much, or\nanything, actually. But I couldn\u2019t -- there was no proof of anything, you know, that I had a\nright -- why did I need it? There was some reason that I needed a death certificate and there\nwasn\u2019t any and so the Red Cross, at a certain point, in 19 -- I don\u2019t know exactly the date,\nbut they gave a blanket death certificate to all the peop -- because of this, th-the inability to\ninhe -- you know and the inability go on with your life, practically.",
        "A: They gave a blanket death certificate. But I had heard -- I knew th-they -- I found out --\nsomebody told me what transport they had gone on, which was November 19th, 1953. That\nthey were sent to Auschwitz.",
        "A: November 19th, I think, 1943, that they were sent to Auschwitz and that particular --",
        "A: Yeah. And that particular transport was immediately sent to the ovens. It never -- you\nknow how in other transports, there was right and left, sort of?",
        "A: This, no. This particular transport, they were not tortured first. They were killed right\naway. And that the Red Cross knew. And they knew that they had been in that parti --\nbecause Westerbork had records. You know, the collection place in Holland had records.",
        "A: And they knew that that transport went to Auschwitz at a certain date and Auschwitz\nhad records and -- they knew that that whole transport was killed the day it arrived, which\nwas maybe the 20 -- the 23rd of November, 24th of November. And one thing that\u2019s always\ngotten me is that I keep thinking, what did I do that day? I mean, you know? That is so --\nthat is something that got stuck in my mind. You know, another reason I know when they\nleft, is because my Uncle Heinz was there in Westerbork. He saw them go. His mother was\non the same transport. My Aunt Kait, my father\u2019s oldest sister. So -- so she had been\nunderground, but she had been given away by somebody and she was -- she was in that\nsame transport. So that they all went together. And -- and that\u2019s something, you know, I\nthink, what did I do? What did I do? As a -- it\u2019s an incredible thing. Of course, you don\u2019t\nknow what goes on. I mean, you know I can be -- sit here and Marty can -- you know,\nsomething happens to him at the hospital two, three blocks away and I don\u2019t know what\ngoes on. And in the war, you didn\u2019t know what went on three blocks away, unless\nsomebody told you. You know, it just -- I mean that -- the way I escaped, for instance, you\nknow, the people did not know the -- M-Manfred did not know what had happened in our\npart of Amsterdam, the part where I had been. Well, this is all on the other tape, but you\nnever know what went -- what went on. No, unless you heard shooting, you didn\u2019t know\nsomebody had been killed. You know, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s an in -- absolutely incredible\nthings. And -- and -- and guilt, let\u2019s talk about guilt. I -- I -- I think I have less guilt feelings\nthan most people and I don\u2019t know why that is. I often think that I have not as much\nsensibility as other people. And it worries me. But -- but maybe it is because I decided to do\nwhat I did, you know\u201d? I decided to escape. And that I don\u2019t think that putting yourself in\ndanger, in any way, makes you a better person. I think it makes you a stupid person, if you\nhave a choice. If you have a choice -- like people who climb Mount Everest, if they die, hm.\nWhose fault is that? If you have a choice and you put yourself in danger -- and I had a\nchoice. I didn\u2019t know whether I was going to make it -- you know, whether I was -- do you\nknow what I\u2019m talking about? When I escaped from -- that was the day they were taken\naway, I escaped. So, anyway, I --",
        "A: My parents.",
        "A: Yeah, I escaped fr-from the situation that they were tak --",
        "A: What?",
        "A: I was, but I\u2019d gone back home. I was home the day it all happened.",
        "A: So -- so I -- I -- I\u2019m -- I did it, I made -- made up my mind and I tell you, when I went to\nHolland and we went for the documentary, that your --",
        "A: They took me to the bridge that I escaped from. We didn\u2019t know exactly which bridge it\nwas, but I remembered that I tried three bridges and it was the last one, I succeeded to get\nover. The first two didn\u2019t succeed. And we went to that bridge and I looked at it -- now this\nis 50 some years ago, you know? And I thought -- and things have changed a little bit in the\nneighborhood, but not too much on that side. And it -- it was a shock, you know? I\u2019d never\nbeen back there, consciously. And there was that damn bridge and I just saw this guy\nstanding there, the one who let me out. I tell you, I -- and -- and to go to my house. To go to\nmy apartment, where we lived, on the Notaramstellat. And to -- to ride in the trolley. We\nrode in the trolley that I escaped from and do you know that I miss -- that I thought that the\ntrolley that I escaped on was the trolley that was in front of my house. It turns out it was the\none across the street. The one in front of my house went the other way. I had it wrong.\nEither I had it wrong, or they changed. I -- I -- I still would like to find that out. But they\nfilmed in the trolley. I didn\u2019t escape the second time on that trolley, the fir -- I escaped\ntwice. And the first time, I was on -- I did it on the trolley. The second time, there was no\ntrolley. And I had to walk to the bridge. But anyway, it -- it -- 1t -- I often think that this\nfeeling that I don\u2019t feel so guilty that I am alive. I feel terrible, terrible, about them not being\nalive and about my sister. That\u2019s the worst thing. Because I remember Manfred telling my\nparents, \u201cIf anything happens, please put her in the hideaway.\u201d There was a hideaway in the\nhouse. \u201cPlease put her in there, please put her in there\u201d And as I left, I said, \u201cSusan-\nSusanna, you go in that hiding place. They won\u2019t come. It\u2019s too big a rattsia, it\u2019s too big a\npogrom, it\u2019s too big a pick up situation. They cannot go into every house, they won\u2019t go into\nevery house.\u201d And they didn\u2019t. She could have been there and we could have gotten her out.\nBut she was three years younger than I was, so that means I was -- she was 14. And in those\ndays, 14 was a very little girl and she didn\u2019t want to leave her parents. And they didn\u2019t force\nher to. There were some parents who sent their kids to England. There were some paren --\nwhich was horrible. There were some parents like -- like this girl Fink, I told you about,\nwho handed their kids over to people. But my parents didn\u2019t do this to Susan. They didn\u2019t\ntell her to stay in there. I said we would send somebody to get her, you know? And they did\nnot do this, they -- we did -- we -- Manfred went in the evening, when all was dark and was\nquiet, you couldn\u2019t see anything that had happened in that neighborhood. And -- which was\na very mixed neighborhood and people were on the streets and everything was normal. And\nManfred went into -- I had the key, after all and he went into the house and he took out a lot\nof silver and he took out a lot of stuff. Rugs he took out and everything, that -- which we\nsold to live during the occupation. So he could safely do that un-under cover of darkness\nand with his false papers, which were quite excellent. They said that he was a German and\nall that kind of stuff. And -- but Susanna wasn\u2019t there. You know, he went there to get her\nout.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I was already underground.",
        "A: Well, that was their fear. We -- we were saying it won\u2019t make any difference.",
        "A: What -- what the Germans said was, they put in you in a s -- they\u2019re going to put you ina\nspecial barrack and you will sent -- be -- be sent away before anybody else. That\u2019s what\nthey had said. Now the thing was, where would they send you? You would die one way or\nyou would die a -- this is what Manfred told me.",
        "A: He said, \u201cDev -- dead is dead and there won\u2019t be any difference. So you come and you\ngo underground.\u201d But let me explain to you. I had gone underground and I was living\nsomewhere else and it was a holiday, the 20th of June. And my f -- my father called, or I\ncalled home to see how things were and he said, \u201cPlease come. Please, please, please. We\nhaven\u2019t seen you in eight -- in so many months,\u201d I forget how many months. \u201cPlease come,\nyou know. We\u2019re still here, it does -- seems okay, you know, and it\u2019s not to be too\ndangerous.\u201d So I told Manfred -- I wasn\u2019t living with him then, I was living in a poncion, in\na boarding house. And -- and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t go. I don\u2019t think anything will happen, in\nparticular, but why would you make -- endanger yourself like that?\u201d I hadn\u2019t been wearing a\nstar, I had been underground. Had good pa -- not good papers, but I had some papers. And,\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t endanger yourself like that.\u201d",
        "A: Just to go from -- no -- yes, to go from -- and be there. Why should you go somewhere\nwhere something could happen, you know? And of course I did want to see my parents.\nAnd I went to friends of ours, a Jewish friend and I put on my star, very lightly, just at the\npoints. And I went to see my parents. And that same night, somebody came to see us and\ntold us what was going to happen in our neighborhood.",
        "A: A big rattsia. An enormous pogrom. An enormous pick up of Jewish people. Very mixed\nneighborhood, so it wasn\u2019t like it was all going to be emptied out. They\u2019re going to -- were\ngoing to be people there. And for instance, the people called Erstrasher, you know Liesel,\nEmma and Maria Austria and all of them, they were there when -- when that big rattsia\nhappened and they did what I asked my parents to do with Su-Susie. They went in a hiding\nplace that they had, upstairs. They did the same thing, we had double walls. They sat in the\ndouble wall. They had a dr -- a drawers that they pulled toward them. They had a handle on\nthe back of drawers and they pulled it -- from the hole in the wall, they pulled it toward\nthem.",
        "A: So if people would come up, it wouldn\u2019t look like enis -- anybody there. It was a Sunday.\nOn Sunday people go away. They -- it was a beautiful day, it was June, you know, people\ngo for walking, they go fo -- to the beach and do -- go whatever. And -- so they didn\u2019t have\nto be there. The Germans came, there were loudspeakers, they were saying all Jews have to\nprepare themselves, nobody else is allowed on the street. And so, the Jews just went\ndownstairs and went on there. On -- on the wagons, the cars that they had, the trucks. But\nthe ones that didn\u2019t come, didn\u2019t come. And the Germans did not go and eve -- if they\nknocked on doors, which I don\u2019t know if they did, if people didn\u2019t answer, they didn\u2019t break\nthe doors down. They didn\u2019t come. There were too many people involved. Crowds of\npeople, crowds of Jews that came down. Everybody -- all the others stood at the windows\nwatching, after all.",
        "A: Of course they knew if was danger, but they si -- that was the rule. I mean, most people\ndo what they\u2019re told to do, you know\u201d?",
        "A: Oh, way ahead.",
        "A: They went -- they went into hiding when Margot, in the beginning, you see, in \u201842,\npeople were called up by name. And Margot Frank got a letter -- a note which said she had\nto be at the train station on that and that date, at that and that time. And she had to bring a\nrucksack, she couldn\u2019t take more than a small -- etcetera.",
        "A: No. We didn\u2019t know they had gone into hiding.",

And -- and -- but the Franks had family in -- be -- in\nBasil, we knew that. And that was the rumor that was spread, because they had a person\nwho was renting a room in their house. And he was there and I remember going there,\nasking -- wanting to ask Margot to come out -- to -- to talk.",
        "A: And he opened the door and he said, \u201cOh no, they\u2019re gone. They went to Switzerland.\u201d\nThat -- they wanted him to say that.",
        "A: And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s exactly what happened. Of course I spread the rumor. People were\nasking, \u201cWell, where are the Franks?\u201d I said, \u201cI guess they went to Switzerland.\u201d",
        "A: And we -- we found out that -- about the round up. Amazingly a lot -- enough, through a\nwoman that -- whom we always had called Cassandra. She came and she told us. And at that\npoint, my father had always said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t go -- don\u2019t go underground,\u201d because of what\nwe mentioned before.",
        "A: This time he said, \u201cGo.\u201d And -- and my mother, w-we -- I couldn\u2019t take anything,\nbecause they thought, if I get picked up with anything, you know what I\u2019m --",

And -- but I was the only one on the street, because Jews had to\nget ready and they had an hour to get ready and no gentiles were allowed, nobody else was\nallowed on the street. But I was on the street. So anyway, that always gives me the shakes.\nAnd I tell it on the other tapes, I --",
        "A: So -- but we went to my house -- my apartment and I -- I looked up and I saw that there\nwere lamps and things sort of leaning up against the window and I thought, \u201cThere\u2019s\nsomething wrong. There\u2019s probably nobody there. Maybe they\u2019 re painting -- they\u2019re\npainting, or something. And the woman underneath us -- th-there was a woman und -- at the\nwindow, watching the filming, which they did in front of our house, of me. They filmed me\nwalking up to the house and looking up, etcetera, etcetera, as you do. And she saw that. So\nthey -- Barbara rang the bell at her house and said, \u201cLook, could we -- since this doesn\u2019t\nseem to be anybody up there, could we come in your house?\u201d And they said yes. Now this\napartment was a little different from ours, because ours was two levels. We had an\ndownstairs and an upstairs and hers was just one level, but she had a -- done a beautiful job\nredoing her house. It was just wonderful. And I saw again what a lovely neighborhood that\nwas. I mean, it really was and -- but it was just unbelievable.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: We -- since this doesn\u2019t seem to be anybody up there, could we come in your house?\u201d\nAnd they said yes. Now this apartment was a little different from ours, because ours was\ntwo levels. We had an downstairs and an upstairs and hers was just one level, but she had a -\n- done a beautiful job redoing her house. It was just wonderful. And I saw again what a\nlovely neighborhood that was. I mean, it really was, and -- but it was just unbelievable to be\nin there. Just -- just unbelievable. What had happened upstairs was that these people, who\nhad lived there all the time, since 19 -- I don\u2019t know what -- just after the war, I guess. They\nhad just died. They had just died and their -- their children were cleaning up the apartment\nand they didn\u2019t feel that anybody could be in there, which was logical. So that\u2019s why we\nwent to the apartment underneath there. Yeah, and we looked -- I looked out of the window\nand I saw this -- what I always used to see. Nothing had changed there. What had changed is\nthe store -- there was a store on the corner and that had changed. Was -- it\u2019s a dentist now,\nwhich 1s not nice, instead of a -- a baker, yes I think, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, it -- it -- it felt like old hat. I mean -- I -- it felt like I should have done it all the\ntime. I mean, I was 25. I -- no, really I was older, I was 27 and a half, maybe, when I had my\nfirst child. We were married when I was 25 and I had my first child in 1953. We were\nmarried in \u201850. Two and a half years. And I f -- it felt absolutely wonderful. I mean, I had a\nwonderful mother, I had a caring surroundings as a child myself, and I guess the way you\ndo, you pass it on. And that -- we have a wonderful family. We all -- we all get along and --\nand it\u2019s very loving with all of them and very close. I have one daughter and three sons and\nthe boys are wonderful. As nice, as wonderful as the daughter and it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s just been\nvery good. And, to my great surprise, when I was mentioning that you were coming, and\nalso during discussion of the -- during discussion of the film that was being -- was made, I\nasked them these questions which I had never asked them. \u201cWe-Were you influenced at all\nby my having had this history?\u201d Because I never felt that we were in any way different from\nanybody else. And they said, \u201cWell, we didn\u2019t have any family. We didn\u2019t have much\nfamily.\u201d Well, we had Marty\u2019s family, but they\u2019re very small family. Marty had one sibling\nand he\u2019s not close with her. Sh-She\u2019s six years younger. And his father died early and his\nmother was a bit s-strange and -- but she came, so we had some connection with his mother.\nWe weren\u2019t enemies in any way, we were friendly with his mother, although not close. He\ndid -- never cared too much for his mother. And so that was something they did care about.\nNow, we had many friends and they had children and we had a close knit group, so I had lot\n-- they had lots of people around. We have lots of pictures of Sunday brunches. We always\ngave Sunday brunches. And we had lunch of -- lots of parties and we had people in the\nneighborhood and people from his work and we always had a very lively surroundings. It\nwasn\u2019t that they felt lonely. But they did -- now, they all married people with big families.\nWhich was ju -- is -- is maybe not surprising. I mean, after the war, people had lots of kids,\nso they had lots -- we had four kids, after all, you know? And these kids have family --\nhave -- have siblings. And they say, \u201cOh, I come from -- my -- my husband or wife has lots\nof family,\u201d because they have four -- you know, they have three siblings.

And there are very few people who would do that,\nyou know? Very few people who stand up and -- up and say, \u201cDo me something, but I feel\nthis and that way.\u201d You know, bang. I mean, what\u2019s the good of it? So -- so you don\u2019t\nexpect too much. You don\u2019t expect people to be other than normal in trying to stay alive.\nThat seems to be the human condition. The -- the necessity to stay alive, really overcomes\nall other concerns that a person might have. And people will do nearly anything to -- of ne --\nof -- of momentary necessity to achieve that goal, the goal of staying alive. They sometimes\nwill kill, because staying alive might say -- might need food and if there is very little food,\nyou have to -- might have to do something to get it. I often think of that when we\u2019re stand in\nline at the grocery store. I think we can be -- we can afford to be friendly, because we know\nthere\u2019s plenty more in the store, you know? But if there isn\u2019t -- so the human condition is\nvery, very weak and shaky and it\u2019s built on certain assumptions, the assumptions of the\nmoment. The assumption of -- that there 1s enough food and there\u2019s good water and there is\ngood this and that and that is the wrong assumption. And you have to do something for tt.\nAnd to do something for it might be difficult. Like what you told me about the underground\nwater being polluted in certain --",

Nothing like this might ever happen in the same kind of way\nas it happened in Europe in the -- in the 40\u2019s, but y-you can only protect yourself against\nwhat you know, and this is what I know. So -- so -- however limited it is. And I do not\nreally -- I would not -- I do not really believe in any religion -- in religion per se, I should\nsay. So I would not like any of the in-laws to be religious, and they\u2019re not. None of them\nand their families are in any way religious.

When we\nwere in Holland, the Franks and us, there was -- you know, in the -- not right away, but\nwhen times got bad -- w-we got there in \u201833, I don\u2019t know -- I think about \u201838 or nine or\nsomething, they set up a -- a Reform kind of temp -- you know, religious group. There was\nno Temple, but there was a religious group. And I think that the Franks and us were in there.\nI remember sitting in a class and -- and learning some Hebrew letters and things, which I\ndon\u2019t remember anything about. But the Franks hadn\u2019t been in any of that, either. Neither\none of us had been -- as far as I remember it, in any way involved. I remember my money --\nmy mother lighting a candles on Friday. And she knew the browhouse -- the re-- the\nreligious things you say when you light the candles. And she must have learned it\nsomewhere. Now, whether she learned it at her father\u2019s knee, did her mother do it? Yes, it\nmight hav -- be so. But I can\u2019t remember it.",
        "A: It\u2019s very likely that she learned that, you know, from her mother. But I don\u2019t even know\nif Huntz was Bar Mitzvahed. I imagine he was -- of -- or Paul was Bar Mitzvahed. My pay -\n- my -- my Uncle Paul.",
        "A: I imagine it -- 1t was -- they were, but I -- I have no proof of that. I really should ask me\nIsraeli cousin. I have two real cousins. One of them Huntz\u2019s and one from my Uncle Paul.\nOne from my Uncle Huntz and one from my Uncle Paul.",
        "A: And one of them lives in Israel and I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t get alan -- long very well. And --\nand one [indecipherable] lives in Holland, we are very close. I don\u2019t know if she would\nknow if my Uncle Paul was ever Bar Mitzvahed.",
        "A: Martin -- Martin was Bar Mitzvahed.",
        "A: No. He was never religious either and neither were his parents. He was Bar Mitzvahed, it\nwas understood. It was like a ritual, but -- but it was not -- they never -- they did not go to\nTemple, except on Rosh Hashanah. They did go on Rosh Hashanah, because the whole\nfamily went.",
        "A: They have the huge family in Baltimore. One reason Marty said he left Baltimore with\nme, after we were married, was because he said, \u201cYou have nobody on your side, but I have\nthis huge family, you\u2019re going to be drowned and we don\u2019t want that.\u201d He was -- he\nobviously wasn\u2019t that fond, you know? He liked his family. He liked his family and unc --\ncousins and uncles and aunts, was huge. 150 - 200 people, I mean, you know. But I know\nhis grandmother, Sara Rodbell and I don\u2019t know her own na -- Calman -- no, wasn\u2019t\nCalman. She -- I knew her very well. She\u2019s the one who came from po -- from Lithuania\nand then came from -- via -- with her husband, from Warsaw. She was anti-religious in the\nworst way, because her mother was married, of course, they -- her father was one of these\nitinerant rabbi\u2019s in Poland. And he died of pneumonia or something, you know, in Poland,\nbecause he had to travel from one place to another and it was very cold. And his mother\nmarried some family of his here in Baltimore. That\u2019s why -- her mother rather, married -- so\nwhen she -- the mother -- my grandm -- his grand -- start over. Marty\u2019s grandmother, named\nSara, married -- came to this country, Baltimore, when she was 12. And her father had died\nin Poland and her mother married a relation of the father, here in Baltimore. There were five\nchildren when -- when she came. This woman came here with five children and she had\nthree more with this fellow from -- this family member that -- that she married. Calman --\nhis name was Calman. And this Calman was in Shul the whole time. And so Marty\u2019s\ngrandmother, Sara, saw her mother work and work and work and work. He never\ncontributed anything to that family, except more children. So -- so she hated religion with a\npassion. It killed her father and it did nothing for her mother. On the contrary, it kept the\nsecond husband in Shul the whole time.",
        "A: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. But anyway, so that grandm -- so -- so Marty\u2019s grandmother was anti-religious, so\nher f -- his father didn\u2019t get any religion because his -- the father of -- her -- his gran --\nMarty\u2019s grandfather, the father of his father, was a wonderful guy and he wasn\u2019t religious in\nany way, either. Very lively fella. So --",
        "A: You know, I have to tell you -- aside from getting, I hope wiser and -- y -- with age, after\nhave -- after having assimilated everything that happened to me in my 72 years, I cannot\nthink that I\u2019 ve changed very much, you know? I think that after all I\u2019ve been through over\nthese 72 years, I think I\u2019m getting easier on people. I\u2019m much easier on people. I mean, I\nforgive them nearly everything. Because I know how hard it is to live. Just to live is\ndifficult. I mean, if you think about the irony of what we build up and -- and work at and it\u2019s\njust so we die in the end. I mean, it\u2019s just ridiculous situation. We\u2019re put in such an ironical\nsituation by being born or after being born, of having to deal with the fact that we have to\ntake everything that goes on in the world very seriously, because after all, it\u2019s our life and\nwe have to function within it. And in the end, just to die. You know? It is really a very\nironical situation. I mean, I -- I think of these people on Long Island who recently died, who\nhad this fantastic collection of paintings. I mean, they went all over the world, they\ncollected, they collected, they collected. They spent billions, millions, you know, collecting,\ncollecting. And when they died, people didn\u2019t even know what to do with the stuff. They\njust put in on auction, it went all over the world, it di -- so what, you know? I mean, it just is\n-- it is really ironic, it is so ironic. So what can you do? What can you do? I\u2019m -- I\u2019m trying\nto figure out what you can do. The only thing you can do that is worth something in life, is\nbe good to your fellow man. The other travelers who happen to be on this earth, accidentally\nat the same time that you are. You know? And trying to help them, if you\u2019re better off than\nthey are, in their trip across the years. I mean, it\u2019s just the only thing you can do. And also\nthe only thing you can do 1s -- is take care of the people that you can reach. You know, it\u2019s\nas if your arms have a certain length and they stretch out as wide as they can and they hold\nwhatever they can and they -- they do good to the ends of their fingertips. I mean, that\u2019s the\nonly thing you can do. And I think that is a Jewish thing. Although, I must say, I\u2019ve met\nmany, many Gentiles who have exactly that same feelings. And -- and in my basically being\nJewish, you know, I think, who knows about their forebears? Who knows who they were?\nThere must be some Jewish in them. Because you know, it is -- it is amazing, at the\ninterfaith council. I mean they\u2019re nearly all Jewish -- I mean they\u2019re nearly all Gentiles and\nthey have exactly the same outlook. So maybe it\u2019s not Jewish after all. Maybe it\u2019s just being\na good human being and -- and trying to [indecipherable] the best you can while you are\nliving. So I do.",

        "A: \u2019m re -- you know, I\u2019m thinking about the very beginning of things when -- when Jews\nwere a tribe in the desert -- everybody was Jewish, right? There was nothing else, except\nmaybe the pagans. But mostly it was -- anybody who was religious probably was Jewish or\nsomething. Some kind of offshoot of that.

And monotruism, where you [indecipherable]\nmonotruism, you know, where you can\u2019t see anything in front of you, you have to do it all\nin your head, the abstraction of God, it\u2019s very difficult.
