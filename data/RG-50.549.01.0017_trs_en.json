        "Question: So, | thought maybe we should start with some of those, just a couple\nthings about the war that you didn't cover too much in the previous interview. You\nmentioned that there were a lot of times that you and your brothers, brother and\nsisters were almost caught. You told one or two stories but | wonder if there were\nsome other moments that you remember coming close to being caught by the Nazis.",
        "Answer: Well the, the only ones that I\u2019m aware of were when they were going to\ninterview us on the, on the train, when they were, they found the teacher with the\nCommunist books and soon. That's the only time that I\u2019m aware of and I\u2019m not sure\n| mentioned then, I, |, as | said, I\u2019m not sure | remember this then but I, |, we just went\nback to Holland and for the first time we visited the house where we had been in\nhiding during the war in Biltoven(ph) and we had, had to move out of that house.\nAnd | can remember a couple of times, not in, when we were in that house but when\nwe moved to | think the third house that we lived in, in Bilthoven(ph), that several\ntimes we were told to leave the house because there was, was gonna be a raid on\nthe house and that we had to go into the back yard and go to neighbors and that we\nhad to stay away, until, in effect, we were told to come back. So, clearly, there was\na lot of suspicion that, that the family we stayed with, the Bookas(ph) were hiding\nchildren, but, and I'm not sure what they did with our clothes but there were other\nchildren there who were not Jewish so, that, they could easily have probably used\nour things to say those don't belong, those belong to the children who were clearly\nnot Jewish. So, anyway, so several times that we had to, to disappear, to avoid the\nraids and that is, that is something | remembered only later as we visited the third\nhouse, actually, we went past it this past April. But, but what I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve done\nAnita Frank 2\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 2\nsome reading since | did that interview about my parents. My parents have, we\nasked them to put their memories on videotape, on audiotape. And they, |, | didn't\nrealize how very often they came close to being taught, caught, that, that, at least\nfour or five times the police were after them because, because my grandfather lived\nwith them and, and his story was that he was from Switzerland but he didn\u2019t have his\npapers and other papers didn\u2019t come on time and then my father didn\u2019t have a job so\nany of those situations aroused the suspicion of the police. And at one point,\nactually, my mother, it was a guy named Pete, Pete who worked in Falkenburg\nwhere, where my parents were in hiding, came to visit them and, and, and\ninterrogated them. And my mother basically said to him, \u201cPete, do not ask any more\nquestions, because you don't want to know.\u201d And Pete, who was not a Nazi and\nnot a traitor, said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So, it, it was times like that or, another time when in effect\nthey were told that unless the papers came, were available they would be taken to,\nto police headquarters and they frantically tried to contact the man who had Mr.\nFrompinksteron(ph), who, who in effect had provided us with the false papers. And,\nand how my father, he couldn't telephone of course, from the town, he had to walk\nabout ten or fifteen kilometers to a, to a place to make telephone calls so he wouldn't\nbe traced. Situations like that, that |, we weren\u2019t aware of because we weren\u2019t with\nthem but it, they happened many a time because my parents also lived out in the\nopen like we did. That in a way they were continually exposed to danger and that's\nwhy they had the razor blades. They had their razor blades handy and miraculously\nwe encountered, we encountered, they encountered police that were not with the,\nAnita Frank 3\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 3\nwith the NS Bay,(ph) which was the Dutch Nazi Party. At least four, five times, so,\nit was tenuous. And, and the reasons they had the raids, they didn't want to betray\nus. They did not. They hoped that if they were caught, at least that we children\nwould be safe.",
        "Q: And the Dutch, just before this interview when we were talking for a couple\nminutes, you mentioned that it was a small percentage of the Dutch who, who actually\ndidn\u2019t betray Jews. Can you talk a little bit more about, | mean, obviously that\u2019s how\nyou survived, right?",
        "A: Was because we were not betrayed. | need to stress, |, what, what my sense\nabout Holland during the war was based on, based on history, basically, data and in\nretrospect, is that there was a small percentage perhaps five, five percent, if that\nmany who actively tried to help Jews if, I\u2019m not sure there were that many, who were,\nwho risked their own lives. And they were truly the noble, the very noble people,\nbecause it\u2019s hard to ask people to do that for others. So, about five percent perhaps\nthat, I\u2019m not even sure it was, were that many, that actually, actively did something.\nMy feeling is that 80 percent didn\u2019t care. I\u2019m not saying that they would have\nbetrayed but also that they didn't care. But we had a significant, | would say fifty to\ntwenty percent who were traitors. A huge percentage that were part of the, they\nbelonged to the NS Bay(ph) which is the National Socialist Party, actively, who\nactively worked with the, with the Nazis, with the Germans and betrayed Jews.\nMost Dutch Jews probably were betrayed by Dutch rather than those were in hiding.\n| think they, they said something like 35,000 were in hiding, 15,000 were betrayed.\nAnita Frank 4\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 4\nThat\u2019s a significant number. Probably mostly by the Dutch. Dutch people who got\na few dollars for it, a few guilders which the Dutch thing. They got guilders so each\nperson had a, had a monetary value attached. And Holland only now is coming to\nterms with the fact that as a, as a people, they were not, they were not all that, | hate\nto say this, they were not all that different from the German people in that a lot of\nthem just turned their heads. Most just turned their heads, let it happen.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk to Betty Booka(ph) about this, later?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: What were her thoughts?",
        "A: Well, she was truly one of the extraordinary heroines, a remarkable woman who,\nbecause of her background, the Quaker background, she was British, one of the\nCadbury(ph) families. She couldn't tolerate what was happening. From the very\nbeginning, she couldn't tolerate this kind of injustice and absolutely, absolutely made\nit part of her, her life, her commitment to save as many as she could. And this was\nwho she was. This was her, her mission in life and that\u2019s what | gather, was true for\nmost of the rescuers. They saw something happening that was so intolerable to\nthem that, that they could not live with themselves and let this, let this happen to\nothers. And they, they, they basically did what they, they did what they did because\nthey couldn't do anything else. Those are the rescuers.",
        "Q: How many people did she save, do you think?",
        "A: Oh, she, tens | would say because, | didn't realize there were other Jewish children\nIn the house, course we didn't know that there were. But there were others, she hid\nAnita Frank 9)\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 5\nother Jews and helped others to hide others and there was a whole system the\nshe and her husband Case(ph) created. They, they. there was a\ngroup of Jewish children living close by that they took care of and tried to save. So\nthey, throughout the war, went out of their way to, to save, to save Jewish children.",
        "Q: And could have died themselves.",
        "A: Oh yes, as a matter of fact, one of the terrifying stories was that, there was a, an\nact of sabotage. Some, some underground, members of the underground blew up\na, a train with Nazi munitions and they, they took Case Booka(ph), in to, to the prison\nand they said, \u201cunless those who had planned this act, this sabotage and who had\ndone it, that, that Case Booka(ph) would be shot. And one of the, one of the, one of\nthe perpetrators of this, of blowing up, who blew up the train was a young Jewish\nman. And he gave himself up. He did not want Case(ph) to be killed. And he was\nimmediately tortured and shot, this young man. And he was part of the, he was in\nthe Underground but he was Jewish, also.",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: In 1943.",
        "Q: My God.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh yeah, they endangered themselves, the Bookas(ph) endangered,\nanybody who hid Jews endangered themselves. And the family, it was interesting\ncause | just spent, as | said, we were in Holland in April, just, just a few months ago\nand | spent quite a bit of time with the daughters, three of the daughters of the Booka\nfamily. And | asked them if they knew we were Jewish and you know what? They\nAnita Frank 6\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 6\nreally didn\u2019t. They, it wasn't discussed, it was never discussed. They just knew that\nthey, that they had to help hide people. But it was all, it was all hidden and it was\njust part of their, of their ethic that they would not cooperate and collaborate with the\nNazis and they would do what they could to help those in need.",
        "Q: Do you think Betty and Case(ph) didn\u2019t tell them just, to not give them information\nthat they might betray by mistake?",
        "A: Right. Nottoimplicate. Right. And itwas Betty by the way, it was, in retrospect,\nit was Betty who insisted doing this, not Case(ph). | don\u2019t know, we're not even sure\nCase(ph) knew we were Jewish, because they took in other children. It was Betty\nwho did it.",
        "Q: What kind of woman was she?",
        "A: Extraordinary, a gentle, little, beautiful, sweetest face in the world, kind, caring,\nconcerned, loving, extraordinary woman who, who just, she couldn't do anything\ndifferent. And we stayed in close touch with her after the war and she came to visit\nus and whenever we went back to Holland, of course, we visited her until she died.\nAnd, and the interesting thing about her is, she was so concerned about others that\nin some way, she neglected her own children. She had eight children, they had\neight children themselves and, and that, you see that often in those who are truly\ncommitted to the well-being of others that, very often, there is some, you, you sort of\nassume your own children will manage. So | think, I, | think there\u2019s some bitterness\nthere now, among her children.",
        "Q: You sense that when you talk to them?\nAnita Frank 7\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 7",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, they admired her, they loved her very much but | still have a real\nsense that they themselves did not probably, did not get what they needed because\nBetty was so concerned for, for others. You only have so much energy.",
        "Q: Did you ever see her show emotion during the war over the situation?",
        "A: No. No, because basically we were told never to tell anybody and so, we didn't\nexcept those little lapses. And | didn\u2019t even know that she knew we were Jewish. |\ncan remember, and that was, that was just the whole thing that | was so torn up\nabout. | mean, we were told never to tell anybody, so as far as we were concerned,\nwe were non-Jewish children living with these people and | had no idea who knew\nand who didn\u2019t know. So | couldn't tell anybody. So it was that, that horrendous\nfear of being discovered that stayed with me and the inability to talk to anybody about\nit, for two years. So all | Knew was that we had to be there because we'd be killed\nbut | did not know that Betty knew we were Jewish. It turned out she did but really,\nmost others didn't, in the family.",
        "Q: Have you seen any of the other children who stayed in that house at that time?",
        "A: No. Yeah, well no, that\u2019s not true, where, as a matter of fact yes we did, | did, just\nIn, in April. Eric, Eric State(ph) was there, the whole time we were there, my brother\nand | were there. Eric lived there and Eric has, he had a, | don't know, | think he had\na serious illness and so he\u2019s, he\u2019s, almost a form of autism and he\u2019s now, so we saw\nhim, | saw him for the first in 50 years. We visited him in his, in his apartment. In\nJulia,(ph), no it was Kondia Booka(ph) and | went to visit.\nAnita Frank 8\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 8",
        "Q: But your brother went with you to Holland? Who, who did you say went with you?\nOr did you go with your husband?",
        "A: Oh with my husband.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: No, no, my brother tragically just died. My, the, my brother with whom | was in\nhiding, Norman, just died April, May 28\", May 29\" of pancreatic cancer.",
        "Q: Oh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that was very sad and that was the terrifying thing of going to Europe\nand knowing, not knowing whether he would live. He didnt, he did live until we\nreturned and we were able to be with him but now he tragically died.",
        "Q: Oh boy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You said that your, your father said your mother\u2019s couraged, courage saved the\nfamily.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you elaborate on that please?",
        "A: It was my mother, my father admitted that he was in total despair at times and that\nwhen they were in hiding in Falkenburg, well in the first place, she saved my father\u2019s\nlife by taking the, | talked about that on the tape, taking the Cross of Merit to the, that\nher father had earned in World War | to the German commander of our town. And\nwho in effect excused my father from that transport where they took first, they first\ntook the men to, totally debilitate the families. And so she did that and then my father\nAnita Frank 9\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 9\nsaid many times that during the war, when in effect the, the police would come and\nwhen in effect they were told to produce papers that they couldn\u2019t produce, and when\nin effect these threats were made of transporting us, of, of interrogating us on the\ntrain because they notified my parents this might happen, that my father said she, he\nwould just be in despair and my mother just would support him and encourage him\nand say, \u201cNo, let's, lets go and see what we can do and lets contact\nFrompinksteron(ph) but be careful about it,\u201d and she just, she just, she just is the one\nwho, who persevered. She's the one who said to Pete, this policeman, \u201cPete, you\ndon't want to know these questions, don't ask us.\u201d | mean, she would come up, it\u2019s\nalmost like her intuition allowed her to do the right things at the right time.",
        "Q: Because that was dangerous.",
        "A: Exceedingly dangerous. It would have been the end of it again. |, had he been\nwith the Nazi, the NS Bay(ph), that would have been the end of the family. But she\ntook risks, somehow almost intuitively knowing what was to, at the same time, she\ndidn't want him to continue asking because she did not want him to know this\ninformation. So it was just amazing.",
        "Q: | wonder what, how he answered to his superiors when he didn\u2019t get ...",
        "A: He said things are fine, probably. Probably went back and said things are okay,\nand looked at the papers and things are okay. He covered up for them, whoever\nthis Pete was.",
        "Q: Amazing.\nAnita Frank 10\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 10",
        "A: But then after the war, my mother suffered horrendously. She never recovered.\nThen she had her nervous breakdowns and then she turned from really this, this very\npositive, | gathered from my cousin who still lives in Holland who adored, who lived\na year with my parents before the war, who, she just said my mother was the most\nloving and positive and, and, and affectionate woman. But after the war, she just,\nthat was all. | can't say it was all lost, she remained very caring but she became so\nbitter and so unhappy and so distraught, so desperate.",
        "Q: Well, your family had a very difficult time in those early years right after the war.",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "Q: Economically, housing ...",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "Q: What were, besides the British censorship job, what were some of the other jobs\nyour father did?",
        "A: Well, he didn't, | think that was his first job. We came, we were liberated in, in\nSeptember, September 17\u00b0, \u201944, in Lindbergh,(ph), in Howtem(ph), we stayed and\nthen we moved to, we moved to a house where the, where the, traitor\u2019s house where\nhe was in prison and the woman was forced to take us in. Then in April of \u201940, \u201945,\njust before, just before the end of World War Il in, in Holland which was May, | think\nit was May five, May 5\", when Holland was liberated. In April we went to, back to\nand we lived in this bombed-out house and his first job there was with\nEnglish censorship so my mother was left alone with us. And then he came back\nfrom that and then he went back to the Ferda(ph) which was the, the clothing factory\nAnita Frank 11\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 11\nwith whom he\u2019d worked before the war so he went back to them and then, after that,\nhe left them and went to another clothing, worked for another clothing manufacturers,\nas a representative.",
        "Q: A salesman?",
        "A: A salesman, yeah. They called them factory representatives. He would go to\nstores and, and, and, yeah, sell their, their line of clothing.",
        "Q: Which probably, or was that a difficult job after the war given the, the economy of\nthe country?",
        "A: Yeah, it was very hard but he had some old customers who when they, who had,\nas a matter of fact one of his customers was very helpful to us during the war. They\nhid some of my parents\u2019 silver and they lived in Lindbergh(ph), northern\nLindbergh(ph), and Findlow(ph), and they were, they were very helpful to my parents.\nSo when my, my father again took that job, they, | think they bought from him. He\nwas a lousy salesman. He, he should never have been into sales. But it was his\nwhole family\u2019s business but my father was an intellectual and he should never have\nbeen a salesperson. He was, hated that, wasn\u2019t good at it, totally honest, totally\nethical, totally non-pushy, totally not the characteristics of somebody who\u2019s going to\nmake it big in sales, exact opposite. Oh, I\u2019m probably insulting salespeople now.",
        "Q: So, in other words, those first few years, economically your family was, would you\ndescribe it as on the edge?",
        "A: Oh, we were continually on the edge. | mean, we came back with nothing. Our,\nmy, my mother, because she came from a very wealthy family had, had, we\u2019d lived\nAnita Frank 12\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 12\nin this house and my mother had all these gorgeous things which were all mostly\ntaken away, also by Dutch people who didn\u2019t return them to us after the war. \u201cAfter\nall,\u201d they said, \u201cyou gave them to us.\u201d And so, like my parents knew who had taken\nthe, the bedroom set, which was a gorgeous bedroom set, people absolutely refused\nto return these things to us. It\u2019s hard to believe that Dutch people, support\nfrom what they called the Commission or something like that so we got\na little bit of money but that was not until | think a year afterwards which allowed my\nparents to buy some furniture. We never got any reparation, we were never got a\npenny for what happened to us during the war. Not from the Nazis, not from the,\nnot from the Germans, we call them Nazis, not from the Germans, not from the Dutch\ngovernment, except a, a little bit that allowed my parents to buy some furniture. And,\nand the reason we survived the war was not because my parents had any money\nbut my, my aunt and uncle in, in Ossin(ph), my father\u2019s sister and her husband who\nhad been very close to my parents. They made money available to us and their two\ndaughters survived the war. One is the, and one tragically killed herself after the\nwar. Another, another consequence of the war. And, and, and, they in effect\nallowed my parents to survive because my parents did have to pay for us. Not\nmuch, but they paid the Bookas(ph), | saw the, | saw the records, they paid the\nBookas(ph) to have us stay there. And of course they had to live themselves. But\nthat was made possible because my aunt and uncle who tragically were taken out\nof, they were both very ill and taken out of the hospital and put in cattle cars and died\nbefore they got to, to Poland. And that, and so that money was gone by the end of\nAnita Frank 13\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 13\nthe war and it was, it was very rough financially, there was no money until my father\nsort of got back into selling some stuff and so we lived carefully. And, and then when\nhe got his new job, he did okay, he did, actually remember one year we actually made\nenough on commissions that we had a little bit of extra which allowed me to go to\nParis, in 1940. | was fifteen so that must have been 1951, before we came to\nAmerica. One of the soldiers who had been in the Liberation Army in Lindbergh(ph),\na wonderful young man, Jewish, and we had stayed in touch with him and he\u2019d gone\nback to America, married a journalist. And they wentto Paris. They, and they lived\nin Paris and invited one of us, and as the oldest girl | had privilege, to come and\nspend six weeks in Paris. And | remember, finally, my parents having little bit of\nextra money they could afford the train fare to, to Paris. It was a big adventure and\nit was the same summer they were able to rent a, a cabin on the beach. So |\nremember there was the one summer that we had a little bit of money. But for the\nrest, it was, It was minimal.",
        "Q: Do you remember the food that you ate before the war, during the war, and right\nafter the war?",
        "A: Not before the war. It was good food. My mother was, she had some help and\nmy aunt, my mother\u2019s only sister, they had gotten her out of Germany in 1936 so she\nlived with us for awhile and my parents, and my mother\u2019s parents lived with us. So\n| think my mother\u2019s mother did much of the cooking until she died in 1938. But it\nwas the Dutch eat potatoes and the, the staples really were bread and potatoes and\na little bit of meat, porridge, food like that, vegetables. But meat was very\nAnita Frank 14\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 14\nexpensive. Eggs were very expensive so you didn't have much of that so it was\nmostly the carbohydrates. And then during the war, | remember very clearly getting\nminute portions of butter, it was margarine, just like perhaps two tablespoons of\nbutter, that, the margarine had to last us the whole week. So, |, |, what | remember\nwere the, the extreme small rations we had and how you had to just be so careful\nthat you just took a little bit and put that on your bread. And, and again, mostly what\nwe ate were bread, potatoes. That, that was most of our staples. It was, | think\nsevere vitamin | think we lacked, had severe vitamin deficiency. Not, probably not\nprotein, not, protein yes but not calorie deficiency but certainly vitamin deficiencies\nwhich manifested itself in me when | was in 1943, we went to visit our parents for\nChristmas. It was the first time we went to see them and we were hit by a sleigh.\nWe were watching people coming down the hill and we were hit by a sleigh and it\nmade a huge gash in my leg and it got horrendously infected and that infection lasts\nfrom Christmas to Easter. And | remember Betty taking me to the doctor every\nweek. | just had sores all over my legs and | just didn't heal. And | think that had\nto do with, just deficiencies, vitamin deficiencies, more susceptible to illness. And\nthen after the war, there were severe shortages again so really the whole time that |\nwas in Holland until 52, things were rationed. | can remember seeing my first\norange, getting it from the Americans, as first orange. Seeing my first pineapple in\n1949 or so, in a store which was just sort of put there prominently and | not knowing\nwhat a pineapple was, so very simple foods after the war when, after things became,\nHolland was in horrendous shape because of the war. And it took a long time and\nAnita Frank 15\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 15\nthat\u2019s where the Marshall Plan was so incredibly helpful. It took a long time for the\neconomies of Europe to begin to recover from the horrors. And | can remember, we\nwould have meat once a week. And we'd have one chicken which we'd divide and\nwe'd get just a little piece and we'd have an egg if we were lucky once a week. We\nwould have cheese though, cheese and jams, those things were our favorite.",
        "Q: Do you think your gaining a bit of weight in California later at all was a\ncompensation for that lack of food?",
        "A: Hadn't thought about that. Yeah. You live with shortages and then all of a\nsudden this, [talkover] unending supply of food. Yeah, it became my, my salvation.\nSome salvation. But that, that\u2019s, that\u2019s very possible, yes. This, like, eat it now\nbecause it may disappear. Hadn't thought about that to be honest. | just, | knew it\nbecame a crutch for me and it was my antidepressant but it became like food was\nsomething | could fill my empty soul with.",
        "Q: And all those years of lack.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, makes, it makes sense.",
        "Q: See, maybe | should have been a counselor.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Just kidding. Letmesee what else | have onthe war. Time. | wondered if after\nthe war you had any recurring dreams or nightmares? Or during?",
        "A: | don\u2019t remember about the dreams and nightmares. What | do remember were\nfeelings of | will never leave my parents, meaning | couldn't imagine that | would ever\nmarry and want to leave my parents, that they represented my safety, my base, my\nAnita Frank 16\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 16\nsolidity, my comfort. And that | had a very strong sense that, that, that they, that\nthey represented all that was good for me. And, and | think that had to do with not\nhaving had them during the war, not being with them. | remember being, of course,\nhorrendously ashamed and I\u2019ve talked about that, | think. [End of side 1 of tape 1].\nOkay, so these, these, the feelings and that, that, so that involved fear and also it\nwas because during the war, I, | had this real sense that | had to be perfect, that |\ncouldn't make any mistakes, that | couldn't do anything wrong, | mean that was, as\nlong as | just stayed perfect, that wouldn't, | wouldn't be killed. | mean, | wouldn't\nbetray myself, or even more so, as long as | stayed perfect, nobody would betray me\nto the Germans, nobody would think | was a bad person and, and betray me to the\nGermans. And that sense of having to be this perfect child became part of who |,\nwho I, | was after the war. And it meant that | couldn't assert myself. | was afraid\nof, | was afraid of asserting myself. And | remember having a feeling of, crazy, that\n| saw other children doing, doing bad, quote, bad things, not terribly bad but being\ndisobedient or being rude and | can remember thinking, and | was about 11 years\nold. | can remember thinking, why can't | be like that? Why can't | be a little bit\nbad? So, so, clearly, there was, there remained an overriding fear in me that | had\nto be, | had to be good, | had to be perfect, otherwise something bad was going to\nhappen to me. But there was also something in me already that said why can't | be\nlike other children? And, and that, that need to please others, that need not to\ndisagree with others stayed with me. And then, | remember one occasion. We\nwere playing ball on the street. Tennis balls, we had tennis balls. And a woman\nAnita Frank 17\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 17\nwas riding her bicycle and she, she hit one of the balls and she fell and she was\npregnant. And she, she ripped her stockings. And | can remember, she came and\nshe was really angry at us and | can remember saying to her, \u201cWell, you should have\nlooked out,\u201d or something like that. | was being rude and it was like, it was almost\nlike something in me said, now is your opportunity to be rude and it was most\ninappropriate really. | mean | chose the wrong person and then, but she came into\nourhouse. My mother was very felt, was very apologetic and paid for new stockings\nand stuff like that. And thank heavens the baby wasn't harmed. But, but | can\nremember that was my one moment of rudeness. But the way, the way this came\nout was, and | mentioned that, was that | became immobilized in school. | stopped\nlearning. It was just like something in me got just so blocked is, the ability to be who\n| really was. And I\u2019m not saying I'm a a bad person or | wanted to be rude, but |,\nthis, this sort of need to, to, to speak up for what you think or what you want didn\u2019t\nhave, I, | just couldn't do that so that sort of came out then in school where | just\nbecame emotionally, just horrendously blocked. | couldn't, couldn't study, couldn't\nwork and there, not being this perfect person, not being this top student which |\nalways have been, I, I, that was just something | had no control over, | felt, so, I, | felt\nvery bad about it because | knew | disappointed my father because he had such high\nexpectations of me. But atleast | felt | had no control over that.",

        "Q: You mentioned that a key turning point was making the friendship with Elizabeth\nDixon(ph)?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Are you still friends with her?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m sadly enough not. She, we had a, so we were great friends until | married\nmy husband and then she went through a very difficult time. She got divorced and\nI'm afraid that, of, | went to go and visit her one day and, well, | don\u2019t particularly want\nto tell the story. But very unfortunate things where she got furious with me for not\nhaving notified her. | did, | wrote, | called her, | wrote her. She said to me come\nanytime you want to. | took her at her word. | sent her a card from, from New\nHampshire where we were then, saying we'll be there on that day, and we got to the\nhouse and she had tickets to the ballet or something. And wrote me this furious\nletter about how inconsiderate | was and thoughtless | was. And |, I\u2019m afraid that\nthis, she, because of her own miseries, she projected a whole bunch of her anger of\nme and | had been sort of the good little girl. | mean, | was the one who just adored\nher and admired her and, and just thought a world of her and then when | married,\n| became this independent woman and no longer this adoring creature who needed\nher as much. And | think that type of role, | mean, | may be analyzing it too much.\nBut it was very tragic, this soon after a marry, this, after | was married, | just, our\nrelationship changed. And it ended, sadly enough.",
        "Q: And yet you said the friendship was key for you.\nAnita Frank 19\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 19",
        "A: It, what was key was that after, after coming to America and having my ego totally\ndestroyed, | feel, no, that\u2019s nonsense. Having my ego severely damaged even\nfurther by Henry Coster(ph) who, |, | think | told that story where, basically he, when\n|, when | was promised | could go to the opening of the rope(ph) and then was told\nto stay home with Peter because he was sick and, |, | dared, here, for the first time, |\ndared complain. | dared express some of my needs and that was literally the first\ntime I\u2019d done that. Since, since the war because | had been so careful, | have no\nneeds. | just, | just managed, | just coped. | had noneeds. So there, |, first time\nthat | remember basically going to Peggy Coster(ph) and saying, \u201cI\u2019m really sad, |\nreally, | really had been looking forward to this and I\u2019m really unhappy.\u201d And then\nPeggy telling Henry Coster(ph) that | had complained and Henry Coster(ph) calling\nme in and telling me | had no right to do that. That devastated me. That absolutely\nconfirmed the fact that | had no right. | had no right to complain. | had no right to\nexpress my feelings or express my needs and it, that stayed with me for years and\nyears and years and make me feel | had no value. Until | went to the Soviet Union\nand with, and Elizabeth Dixon(ph) was there on the second exhibit, no it was the first\nexhibit, and where in effect she seemed to really like me. And she was lonely there\nand she was a real friend to me and I, she provided me with a home and | remember\nvery distinctly thinking she is a person of value. She values me so there must be\nsome value to me. |, | absolutely went through those thought processes. And then\nthat, that was enormous boost to me, that she\u2019d really cared about me, the first\nperson in this country to really do so. And that was a long time after I'd been here,\nAnita Frank 20\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 20\nthat was in 1962. That was ten years, ten years after I\u2019d come to this country, that,\nthat\u2019s, that\u2019s when | really began to feel there had to be something worthwhile in me.",
        "Q: How do you view Henry Coster(ph) now in your life?",
        "A: Well, again, I\u2019m intensely grateful to him because he was our sponsor and he\nmade it possible for us to come to this country. And coming to this country,\nnotwithstanding the miserable first ten years, was liberation, was, was our, was for\nme true liberation. Because eventually allowed me to come, become the person\nwho lam today. Tragically, he, so there I\u2019m very grateful to him. But tragically, he\nwas, he\u2019s part of this Hollywood garbage dump. And, and what a fake life those\npeople lead. Nothing is real, nothing is authentic. I\u2019m exaggerating as usual. But\nvery little is authentic and, and, even, naive and innocent as | was when | came to\nCalifornia, living in this fake environment, even | knew that these people weren't real.\nEven | knew that these expressions of interest meant nothing. And so he, he did\nnot, and I\u2019m not blaming him, but he clearly and neither did Peggy, | think, Peggy is\na, was a sweet, she was always very sweet, | need to stress that. But, but Henry\nruled the roost. And | don\u2019t think he had any sense of what was going on with me at\nall. And! don\u2019t know whether | can blame him for that or not. | don\u2019t blame because\n| don't hold him, he did what he knew how. But you know, you live, you grow up in\nthat world of fakery and you grow up in that, you live in that world where all these\npeople play pretend and so little is real and people don't even know what is real and\nwhat is not real. And | gather there now, there\u2019s a group now, stars that may have\na somewhat stronger grip on reality. But in those days, it was just about as fake as\nAnita Frank 21\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 21\nyou could imagine. Yeah, | don't think he knew any better, so, |, | prefer to look at\nhim and say thank you for bringing us to America. |, | like not, | don\u2019t, | don\u2019t focus\non the bad.",
        "Q: But no, no one in that family ever asked you about your wartime experiences?",
        "A: No. Never. That\u2019s, that\u2019s what | mean. We lived, it was like secrets. It was\nlike, it was like, that was, | think, the horror of, of the war years. It wasn't just the war\nyears, it was afterwards when quote, nothing had happened. It was as if we had to,\nwe had to continue our whole lifestyle as if nothing had happened. As if we had just\nhad this normal kind of life. And so that\u2019s what we believed, that we just had to go\non as if nothing had happened to us. And so we couldn't ever get in touch with the\nhorrors of the war and we couldn't even, we, we couldn't even, sort of begin to think\nabout it and say hey, how did this impact us? Because it was never talked about, it\nwas never discussed. In contrary, on the contrary, we just had to go on and we had\nto be good, good kids and we hadnt, shouldn't cause anybody any problems.",
        "Q: Have you maintained any contact with his children since you left the babysitting\njob?",
        "A: Well, yes, as a matter of fact, Peter the younger son, Nicky, Nicky tragically died.\nHe was a psychiatrist and died of, under very unfortunate circumstances. And Peter\nand his mother Peggy were here a year and a half ago, almost two years ago. They,\nthey came to visit for the first time, the first time I'd seen Peter. Henry Coster(ph)\ndied in, about ten years ago. But Peggy was, was very nice to see her and Peter\ncame with his wife. So we had a lovely, lovely reunion here.\nAnita Frank 22\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 22",
        "Q: Did you guys talk at all about, was she surprised, for instance to see how much\nyou changed and grown and so on?",
        "A: Yeah, | think so, escept(ph) what was so amazing is my parents had four children,\nand Henry Coster(ph) had two children is really, that given our circumstances, is how\nwell the four of us had done. And that yeah, that, this little fat girl that stayed with\nthem for year and a half had sort of turned into rather competent human being and,\n| think they were. But you know what, | could not talk to them about my real\nexperiences there. | could, | did not feel that | could say to them, do you know what\nhappened to me? And so it, it remained superficial. The discussion wasn\u2019t a real,\nsort of recognition of what had happened those, that year and a half | stayed with\nthem it was. Talking about people we knew and things we'd done and stuff like\nthat.",
        "Q: Well, then, they would have to accept some responsibility for not being more\nsympathetic and understanding.",
        "A: Yes. And | didn't, | didn\u2019t, | didn\u2019t want to bring this up now. Peter, of course,\nhad nothing to do with it. | always adored Peter so Peter was just six, bless his little\nheart and he was a marvelous child. So it was, it was with Peggy, and | just didn't\nwant to do that because | don't think she would have understood. | don't think she\nwould have understood. And that\u2019s too, when you have just one day together, you\ndon't want to, one evening together, you don't want to bring up those issues.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: At least | don't.\nAnita Frank 23\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 23",
        "Q: Well, also, there\u2019s that, that balance thing where they also sponsored you and\ngave you this opportunity...",
        "A: Absolutely. For which, in the long run, | mean, | have recovered from that. For\ntotally, for sure, in spades as a matter of fact. And, and in, indeed, | am unbelievable\ngrateful that they made it possible for us to come to this country. So, that\u2019s, that\u2019s\nmore important to me than the rest.",
        "Q: Did you ever find out more about how your father and Henry Coster(ph) became\nfriends in the beginning?",
        "A: No. Really, all | know is that they had my, they had a friend called, a woman\nnamed Tanta Onna Headsfeld(ph), | think her name was. And they met through her\nand she was my mother's sister\u2019s mother-in-law. \u2018Kay, so, my mother\u2019s, my mother\nhad a sister, Tanta Powla(ph), it was her husband\u2019s mother who was the one who\nbrought my father and Henry Coster(ph) together. And all | know was that was in\nthe twenties and my father was traveling in Germany and the Dutch economy\u2019s doing\nwell, reasonably well, that the German economy was disastrous and my father\nhelped Henry Coster(ph). And they were pretty good friends but again, it was really\nsad because after, when we came to America and when my parents moved to\nCalifornia in 1958, we, in 52 we went to St. Louis and \u201958 they moved to California.\nHenry, really, had nothing to do, they, they really, perhaps saw my parents once\nevery two years. But there was no effort at really having a relationship with my\nfather. Because he was, he was a hotshot director and my father was a lowly,\n, let's see in California he ran, he managed a motel.\nAnita Frank 24\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 24",
        "Q: What was that like for your parents to come to America and have to take minimum\nwage jobs and basically start all over once again?",
        "A: That's, I've thought about that a lot. Again, they never had an opportunity to talk\nabout anything so they, like the rest of us, they just did what was expected of them.\nAnd they came to America for us and so my father, my mother who had never worked\noutside the house, took these job, first job was in a handbag, handbag factory. My\nfather worked in a paint factory, got horrendous paint, lead poisoning there,\npractically died. They never did anything for him there. They had, cheap(ph) job\nas custodians, | mean, they had these, my mother worked as a nurse's aide ina\nhospital. Horrible jobs. Horrible jobs. Never complained. Never complained.\nNever even regretted having left Holland because even though that, it must have\nbeen just so hard for them to totally shift focus. They did it. They were totally\nremarkable and, and what, they did it for us. And they, | think all of us, perhaps all\nof us felt a strong obligation to our parents. That was never ever lost throughout that\nlifetime that, that we, we also made sure that when we became adults and we were\ncapable, we took care of them. So they never, | bought \u2018em a house in Washington,\nafter they, my father retired from the motel. | lived in Washington. They came to\nWashington. My sister and | bought \u2018em a house and then | supported \u2018em in the\nhouse. And they lived in that house in, in Rockville, Maryland. Nice little house for\nabout, until from 1965 until 1971, | think. And then my sister came with her husband.\nThey, she had been in the Air Force in Thailand, and then they moved my parents,\nlock, stock and barrel to, to Florida. And then they lived with my sister there for 20\nAnita Frank 25\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 25\nyears. And then after my father died, my mother came and lived with my other sister\nin Baltimore and her last eight months, she lived with me. That we, | just could not\ntolerate sending, she was, she had mild dementia, she'd broken hips and she was\ncrippled and |, we could never have put her ina home. I, 1, and she died. Both my\nparents died at home, thank God. So they were never abandoned. We never\nabandoned them.",
        "Q: How old were they when they died?",
        "A: My, both, both 90. My father was 90 when he died of a, of a heart attack. My\nmother was 90 when she, basically she, she had TIAs, transeedischemic(ph) attacks\nand just these little strokes and, and just mentally was confused but she lived with\nme and then in, in July she had a stroke which left her paraplegic. And then she\ndied in August.",
        "Q: Did your family speak English while you lived in Holland?",
        "A: My father did. My father spoke three languages fluently. | studied English in\nHolland and, it was a, | still don\u2019t know | did it, studied just for two years, came to\nAmerica, went to Beverly Hills, California and started school. We came to, we\narrived in America December 7. | went to California about December 16\" and\nstarted school January and | took finals end of January in public speaking and English\nand | did better than a whole bunch of the kids who'd been inclass. | learned English\njust, justinnotime. Just, | still don\u2019t know how | did it but | was pretty fluent in English\nin a very short time.",
        "Q: What about the rest of your family?\nAnita Frank 26\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 26",
        "A: Not as quickly. My, my mother had the hardest time. My younger sisters learned\nit in school. When you're young, it\u2019s easy to learn another language. My father\nspoke it. My mother had the hardest time learning English but bless her heart, she\ndid. Unlike a lot of foreigners who just never learn, she did. So we ended up all, in\na way that was sad, we all ended up speaking English to each other, instead of Dutch.\nBut I\u2019ve, I've kept my Dutch up. I, | can still speak it.",
        "Q: Did your mother also read English?",
        "A: Yeah. Oh yes, oh, devout reader of the paper. Every morning she'd read the\npaper.",
        "Q: How do you think your parents worked on their recovery? Did you say that they\ndidn't really recover say as fully as you did?",
        "A: My mother never recovered. As a matter of fact, one of the great horrors to, to\nthink about how, how you can never forget, is because you never forget, is that as\nshe became, as she became more demented, | hate that word, as she began to lose\nher memory more, the past started coming back and she became terrified that the,\nthat the Gestapo was around. When she was my sister she said, \u201cWho are these\npeople outside? Are they, is that the Gestapo? Close the windows, don\u2019t let \u2018em see\nus.\u201d When, when she was me, | start crying every time | think about that, is that she,\nat one point, she was sitting at the table and she said, \u201cAnita,\u201d she said, \u201cDid my sister\ndie a natural death?\u201d | know, her sister died in Auschwitz. And | said yes she did.\n| mean,! wasn't about to say to her, no she died in Auschwitz. But, and then, and\nthen when friends came to visit and they were very lovely to her, after they left she\nAnita Frank 27\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 27\nsaid, \u201cDo they know we're Jewish?\u201d So she was back, she was back. And then\nshe would sit in the chair and she'd say, \u201c| want to go home.\u201d And | said, \u201cWhere do\nyou want to go?\u201d And she was thinking, she want to go home to her parents.\nThat's, that\u2019s, and | said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid, I\u2019m afraid that your parents aren't here anymore.\u201d\nAnd she'd say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, they're dead.\u201d But she wanted, she wanted\nsomething, | know, | Know what she, she wanted to go back to a place where she\nwas safe. And really after the war | don\u2019t think there was anymore safe place for\nher.",
        "Q: She\u2019d just been through too much.",
        "A: Through too much. And again, no recognition, no, no acknowledgment after the\nwar about what had happened to Jews. Basically, the message in Holland was to\nJews, is come on, why don\u2019t you just forget it, just, just, like this woman | heard on\ntelevision, why don\u2019t you just go forget it, go on with your life? And this deliberate\neffort to, to pretend that what had happened to the Jews was not different from what\nhappened to other Dutch people. And you got that from the Dutch. Well, we have\nsuffered too. Well, they had no concept of the difference between their suffering.\nWell, my brother had to hide, yes, my brother had to hide. They had no concept of\nthe difference between quote their suffering. And I\u2019m not saying the Dutch didn't\nsuffer. But I\u2019m also saying that there was no recognition of the difference between\nwhat happened to us and what happened to the rest of the Dutch who were not\nsingled out, who suffered as a people, but we were singled out because of who we\nwere.\nAnita Frank 28\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 28",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you tell that story that, about the restaurant in Chicago where the\nwoman was interviewed after the Berlin Wall fell?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, again, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, | even heard this from a friend of mine, \u201cWhy don\u2019t\nyou just forget it?\u201d It\u2019s, it\u2019s the kind of thing even though | personally feel that | have\ndone extraordinarily well because I\u2019ve dealt with it for so many years now. I've, I\u2019ve\nbeen able to come to terms with happened and recognize how present behaviors are\nrelated to the past and made every effort not to allow the past to control my, my\npresent behavior. But the, the reality is, is that those of us who went through it will\nnever forget. And so to listen to people telling me that we should just forget it, |, |\nwant to shoot \u2018em. And one of the most striking memories is when the Berlin Wall\ncame down, PBS had a program in which they talked about how wonderful it was to\nhave the wall come down but recognizing that, that some of the Jew survivors, the\nHolocaust survivors weren't so happy about the wall coming down, that in effect, that,\nthat there had been several expressions of deep concern about a united Germany\nand what that meant. Basically, what it meant to Europe. And, and the interviewer\nwent to an ethnic restaurant, a German ethnic, in Chicago | think it was and talked to\nthis woman and said, well they were celebrating, they were celebrating the wall\ncoming down. And this interviewer saying to this woman, \u201cWell, what do you think?\nThere are some people who are deeply concerned about this wall coming down,\nabout, in terms of what it means for a united Germany?\u201d And her response was, \u201cAhh,\nwhy can't they just forget it?\u201d | wanted to kill her. I, I, not that | never would,\nbecause | can\u2019t but that\u2019s, that was my thought. You miserable witch. If |, if | had\nAnita Frank 29\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 29\nbeen there, I, | don\u2019t know what | would have done to her because how can we forget?\nYeah, we survived but our families didn\u2019t, our relatives didn\u2019t. We had, we came to\nAmerica and fortunately | have three cousins who survived. Two who live in\nCalifornia with their families and one who still lives in Holland and that\u2019s it. And, we\nhad to start from scratch. | went to a wonderful wedding yesterday with Jewish\nfamily, dear wonderful, wonderful friends and they were blessed. Hundreds, they\nhad a hundred of their relatives there and their families had left Europe, thank God,\nin the, in the early 1900\u2019s, came to America. Even though they\u2019d lost distant\nrelatives, they were able to come with their families and build and have this wonderful\nextended family and how | envy them because they have got, they\u2019ve got the cousins\nand the aunts and the uncles. We don\u2019t. We had to start from scratch. We're\nstarting with our little family and | must say, we lost more than most. We lost most,\nmy father had seven brothers and sisters and only he and the older brother survived\nwith some cousins. My mother had just one sister and her daughter and they were\nmurdered so, that, that leaves very little family. And so you come here and you start\nfrom scratch. you start from scratch without your, but you also, you have\nthe memories, you don't, you don\u2019t forget that. You live with that. |, there, rarely a\nday | don\u2019t think about my, my aunt or my cousins who were murdered. _| just, that\u2019s\nnot something you forget and every thing that reminds you of them makes, and those\npeople who were killed in the concentration camps, those are not strangers, that\u2019s\nfamily. So you don't forget, you can't forget and you shouldn't forget.\nAnita Frank 30\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 30",
        "Q: And is it like when you hear someone being so insensitive, like the woman in the\nrestaurant in Chicago, Is it like that person is denying your experience, your suffering,\nyour, your loss?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, right, that\u2019s, that\u2019s what they do. It\u2019s, it's, what kind of assininity is\nthat? What kind of stupidity is that? They should go through something like this for\nthem to understand. And I\u2019m thinking of the horrors of Bosnia. They're not gonna\nforget. It's gonna be etched in their minds and their memories and they're gonna\nlive forever with the loss of their, of their families and their relatives. They'll never\nforget. Ruwanda. The horrors of the Tootsie(ph) Massacres. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s beyond\nmy understanding that people can think these things can happen and you don't\nremember. Or you're not gonna, you\u2019re gonna forget. You can't ever, ever forget.\nYou live with that for the rest of your life and your children will live with it, like my son.\nHe's got, well he\u2019s got no grandparents and thank heavens | have two sisters and my\nbrother tragically is gone but he\u2019s got two children and his wife is still there and his\ntwo children each have three children so he\u2019s got cousins. He\u2019s, he now has cousins\nfor which I\u2019m very grateful and I\u2019ve got a, I\u2019ve got two sisters whom | love very much\nwith their families so we have that. And we're in touch, close touch with my cousins\nin California which is nice. But that\u2019s it. And then, and then just knowing that the\nrest just didn't live their lives but they were murdered.",

But,\ncertainly, the Crusades, the, the Inquisition in Spain, | mean, blaming Jews for the\nplague. | mean it, all you have to do is go through European history and if you look\nat the Bible, this increasing anti-Semitism, this, this hatred of Jews. You see that\ndeveloping in the Bible, it wasn't, that was not the original, the original disciples were\nnot, they were Jews themselves. But you see, as, as Rome became Christian, they\nof course had to, to blame Jesus\u2019 death, not on the, the, the, the Romans but they\nhad to blame it on the Jews. And you see this shift, this shift in the Bible itself to an\nincreasingly more anti-Semitic perspective about Jews as Christ killers. And that\nbecame the great montra(ph) in, in European Christianity. Both Catholicism,\nLutheranism is Jews the Christ killers, Jews the blood-suckers, the Jews the\nDamned, Jews are not gonna go to heaven, it\u2019s only the select Christians who\nsomehow have got the one right answer who are gonna go, who are gonna go to\nheaven. And so you have the dominant religion which of course Christianity is, in,\nin Europe. You've got the dominant religion saying of another group of people that\nthey're damned and they're gonna go to hell and they're, they suck the blood of\nChristian children. It becomes, they become the, the Jews, the dirty Jews, the ones,\nthe dangerous people and then of course with the, with the Christians curtailing the\nAnita Frank 33\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 33\nJewish, the Jewish, the possibility for Jews, jobs, professions and so on, were in a,\nin effect, Jews can only be, they could lend money because it was dirty for Christians\nto lend money. So they could do the dirty jobs. And then Jews become successful\nthere, they're being killed because they did. They became the money lenders and\nyou have Shakespeare and Merchant of Venice and Charlotan(ph), that perpetrating\nthose horrors. And, and so you've got a whole culture of anti-Semitism which was,\nyou have it in France with the Dryfuss(ph) Affair, | mean you have it all through\nEurope. In, in eastern Europe with the progroms, you have it all through Europe\nthroughout with intermittent periods where in effect certain rulers(ph) who'd be\ntolerant of the Jews because they could use them. So it wasn\u2019t unmitigated, | mean\nit wasn't totally consistent but it certainly was consistent over time with periods of, of,\nof some, of some allowance to, to let Jews live their lives and flourish. And | must\nsay that\u2019s where Holland has had us, on the whole, a, a better history, not perfect but\ncertainly a better history of tolerance for Jews because they did allow the Sofottic(ph)\nJews with the Inquisition to come to Holland and Holland has had a relatively,\nextraodinarily wonderful history of, of religious freedom. And has allowed its Jews\nto live in relative peace. But in Germany, Germany with all of its, its effort that\nbecoming a nation-state which it didn\u2019t become until Bismarck with all of its in-fighting\nand then, and, and a population which is the same as in Holland, this, this, a\npopulation that has as its dogma the Christian belief that if you just, the Calvinistic\nbelief if, if you just do everything right and you follow God's word and you do it, then\ngood things are gonna come to you. And that basically, you obey. It\u2019s very\nAnita Frank 34\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 34\nimportant to do what you're told, not to question this sort of authoritarian, sort of ethic\nof, of, of children must listen to their parents, children must obey, children must not\nquestion. Father knows best. So you've got this, this sort of a cultural pattern of\nnot questioning what goes on, a religious pattern of, if something bad happens to\npeople, they deserve it. And then a historical pattern of extreme anti-Semitism, then\nyou ve got this great combination that when things go bad, as of course Hitler came\nto power after this horrendous inflation, well, first the defeat for Germany in World\nWar | which was a horrendous blow to their morale and then, this, this terrible inflation\nthat impoverished millions of people. What you do is you find a scapegoat. And\nHitler, Hitler was always a rabid anti-Semite. But people become very vulnerable to,\nbecoming comfortable to, yes, it\u2019s all the Jews\u2019 fault. Blame somebody else, | mean\nwe do it in this country all the time, is blaming somebody else. Blame the\nimmigrants. Blame, blame the illegal aliens. Blame everybody. Even blame\noutside terrorists when we're breeding our own terrorists. We have the militia who\nIs SO dangerous here. So you blame, you start blaming others. And then\neverybody else is doing it and it becomes really comfortable and then you obey\norders and you don't question and you become self-satisfied and smug because\nthings are getting better. It\u2019s not, not difficult then to understand the Jews, the\ntraditional scapegoat in Europe became an obvious scapegoat here. And then with\nGerman propaganda, they did an unbelievable job of painting Jews as rats. As\nvermin. Destroying the fiber of the great Aryan nation. And that propaganda is, is\nstaggering, you see some of those propaganda films. So you put all that together, it\u2019s\nAnita Frank 35\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 35\nnot surprising. It\u2019s not difficult to make people hate others. And that\u2019s why for me,\nquestioning, always questioning, never accepting what people tell you without really\nexamining the validity of any of it and never allowing others to dictate your moral\nstands. It\u2019s just so vital.",
        "Q: But weren't Jews fully integrated into German society and wasn't there a lot of\ninterchange ...",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yeah. But that didn\u2019t seem to bother most people in Germany. That was exactly\nright because Jews were given a chance. It\u2019s been just remarkable. Jews, | don't\nknow how they manage. But they have, they're like that little ball that you put down\nit comes on up, Jews have always been like that little ball. They just, they just\nsomehow cope. And so indeed, in the early 19, in the early 1900s, there had been\na period of, of freedom for Jews and Jews had done extraordinarily well in Germany\nand they were the heart and soul of the cultural scene in Berlin. | mean that was the\ngreat and others, great artists, great painters were Jews and,\nand merchants and, yes.",

My grandfather had some stores, was a very wealthy man and a very\nAnita Frank 36\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 36\nprominent man in his little town which before the war was Germany. After World\nWar | became part of Poland. Zupolni(ph), it was Simpleburg(ph) then and he had\ngiven hundreds of thousands of marks for the German war effort. That's how come\nhe got his, his cross, he got his Cross of Merit which saved my, my father\u2019s life, but\nmy grandfather, yes, he was a German. And yeah, right. And so, yes, you're\nabsolutely right. And it's amazing how easy it is to turn that around and so your\nneighbors whom you, whom you loved before are now become your enemies. You\nsee it in Bosnia, you saw it in Sarajevo, you saw it in Mostar(ph), where Muslims and\nCroats who'd lived and served, who'd lived together as friends, all of a sudden start\nbetraying and even murdering each other.

All it has\nto be is some evil, evil men and it's mostly men who feed into people\u2019s stupidity,\nignorance and then who will light that what is evil in men and then, and then makes\nthem justify the murder of their neighbors.

Basically, | have this very peaceful concept of what I, | look at the\nworld roundly and | say there was something greater than just we humans but | see\nAnita Frank 38\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 38\nit as a great spirit of love that allows for all the best in us to flourish. Basically, it\u2019s a\nlife on earth here that is the test of what we do with our lives but that in terms of a\nGod, whatever happens to us afterwards, there is no discrimination there. God does\nnot discriminate, a God does not perpetuate evil, a God does not condone, a God is\nnot petty the way the Christian god is, a petty god who says you've gotta do it this\nway, you've gotta do it that way, otherwise you're gonna be damned. That's nota\ngod, that\u2019s a human, that\u2019s a human being.

        "Q: What is your problem with the god of Judaism?",
        "A: It\u2019s a pretty, pretty judgmental god, too, it\u2019s too judgmental. It\u2019s, it\u2019s a god that tells\npeople what to do and what not to do. If you look at it, it\u2019s, show your belief in me\nby sacrificing your, your son, Isaac.

My brother, by the way, converted\nto Christianity and became extremely religious. His two children are very religious\nChristians. And my mother was telling the nurse who was also a very religious man,\nChristian, she was telling him about the war experiences and about how we were\nsaved, miraculously saved and his words were, \u201cWell, God must have had very\nspecial plans for you.\u201d And | just exploded.

        "Q: Is there something, in your opinion, about religion, say both Jewish and Catholic\nand Protestant and all that, Christianity to group them all, is there something that you\nthink also perhaps perpetuates people not thinking for themselves completely and\ntaking responsibilities?",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. You can\u2019t think too much. Asa matter of fact, it\u2019s really\ninteresting. My son is involved with a lovely young woman who is Catholic and she\nwanted to, she decided she was gonna be Catholic, she wanted to be the best\nCatholic possible so she thought of becoming a nun. And then she said, \u201cWell then\n| better really go and know, read the Bible.\u201d And she said she started reading the\nBible. And the more she read the Bible, the more she began to see the internal\ncontradictions that, that the Bible is full of because she\u2019s a real scholar. She\u2019s a real\nintellect. And she said, she said, then she said she went to her friends and said,\n\u201cPlease convince me how to be a good Catholic,\u201d and none of her friends could\nconvince her. And because basically, in order to be a good anything, you can't read,\nread the Bible from a scholarly perspective. So | discussed it with some very lovely,\nlovely young people who are also devout, devoted Christians and | said, \u201cWell, how\ndo you deal with this? That the innumerable contradictions in the Bible.\u201d And they\nAnita Frank 41\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 41\nsaid, \u201cWell, basically, it's important to study it but you can\u2019t go too far because what\nyou need to have is you need to have faith that basically what the Bible tells you is\ncorrect. So you cant,\u201d they said, their words were, \u201cthe theologians who really\nexamine the Bible carefully, they just, they just go too far.\u201d So there is a limit to what\nyou, you can read the Bible but don't read the Bible too far and | gather in Catholicism\nthis has been the thing. That's why you had the catechism because the catechism\ngives you the one correct line. Yes, and then this whole issue of control. As long\nas | tell what the right way is and if there\u2019s only one right way. and if you question,\nyou're gonna be damned. _ Just think of the power and control involved in that, how\ndangerous that potentially is.

        "Q: | know, they didn\u2019t actually tell me to get so intellectual but to me the, well actually\nNina Ellis(ph) did bring up God because she said a lot of people have done some\nvery, very critical thinking about religion since the war. Who lived, why me?",
        "A: Why, why us? Pure unadulterated luck. That's why we survived. Not because\nGod chose us. That\u2019s an evil God who would do that and there\u2019s no such thing as\nan evil God. That\u2019s contradictory, it's a oxymoron.",

        "Q: It is a, an intellectual religion.",

        "A: No, after the war, after the war, after liberated | had to go to a Catholic school and\nboy did they push religion there and again, that\u2019s why in this country, this, this\nseparation between church and state is so important because they don't have that in\nHolland. The, the state supports all sorts of religions and what it breeds is, is, is\nseparatism. Now again the Dutch, bless their hearts, are, are really quite\nremarkable. They've, they've seen the light and our, have become many ways\nAnita Frank 43\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 43\nprobably among the most tolerant of all people in this world. |\u2019m very impressed with\nthem, at least the ones I\u2019ve met. But, but you have to go to Catholic schools, very\npainful to be only non-Catholics and soon as, course soon as we were liberated there\nwas, we could tell people we were Jewish, then there were immediately excluded.\nDirty Jews, Christ killers. Right smack after we're liberated, the war wasn\u2019t even\nover. As long as we weren't Jewish, it was safe but as soon as we were freed and\nwe became Jewish, it became unsafe again and so that\u2019s why we had to hide it. It\nwasn't safe to be Jewish in Holland and, and, it\u2019s very interesting, | just read in the\npaper last week about a group of young Germans who want to atone for their parents\u2019\nand grandparents\u2019, sins of, they, they have come to America because there are no\nJews left in Germany or very few. They've come to America to work in homes for\nthe, for the aged. Really wonderful. I\u2019msoimpressed. And they said that it\u2019s, they\nwere so grateful that they were not, they were not judged here. They were so\ngrateful that they were not damned here and they said it was also wonderful for them\nto get to know Jews because she said in Germany being a Jew is still bad. And |\nwas saying yes, | know it. Even in Holland, people are uncomfortable with people\nwho are Jewish. When | tell people I\u2019m Jewish, you can feel the discomfort. Not\nall, but some.",

We, the town we lived in before the war had a synagogue,\nhad Jewish life after the war, 152 in the Jewish Museum in Amsterdam. |, on the\nlittle computer you can, you can get those numbers. There were 152 Jews before\nthe war in Braydare(ph), 12 of us survived. Twelve came back and we were six of\nthe 12. | know all the ones who survived, can tell you, even give their names, still\ngive you theirnames. There was no Jewish life left. | remember once after the war,\nit must have been 1948 and we went at night. It was, | think, was it Yom Kippur or\nwas it, may have been Yom Kippur, we went to, because then there was no, no\nJewish community left, no temple, we went to a Jewish service. And we went at\nnight when it was dark, so it was fallen, it was dark and it was just like we still had to\nbe careful not to be seen.

        "A: | think \u201948. And then nothing after that. There were no Jews left, they killed\neverybody. So, and then so, you, you combine the fact that the destruction of all\nyour Jewish life and then of all your fellow Jews and then living in the country being\na Jew was a bad thing, because that was basically the message to us still, but being\nAnita Frank 45\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 45\na Jew, much safer for you to keep your mouth shut. And as far as I\u2019m concerned,\nmost Jews who still live in Holland are still in hiding. | went to a conference in 1992,\nthe first conference of the Hidden Children. Five hundred of us were there,\nin Amsterdam, was a wonderful experience forme. And about a quarter of the Jews,\nthe surviving Jews emigrated to, mostly to America, Canada, Australia and of course,\nIsrael and, and so a bunch of us came back. It was, was wonderful but there were\nJews there, survivors, who had know each other and had not known they were\nsurvivors. They knew each other as Jews but not as survivors. You didn't talk\nabout it. You wenton with your life. You didn't deal with it. I\u2019ve got, not my cousin,\nbut my cousin\u2019s cousin in Holland, | don\u2019t want to deal with this, just, just forget it and\njust from the, my cousin, my one surviving cousin in seething with anger.

        "A: Well, no, | mean, she has, | have asked her questions and she talks about it but\nit\u2019s too painful for her. She survived because she escaped the Dutch concentration\ncamp and she was there with her little sister. And, oh gosh, you think about this.\nShe was there with little sister, she was there when her parents were taken to the\nconcentration camps, taken out of the hospital, taken to Westerbork, and put on the\ntrain to Auschwitz and she begged them to please leave her little sister, was exactly\nmy age, little, few months older, Lainie(ph) was her name. She begged them to\nAnita Frank 46\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 46\nplease... [End of side 1 of tape 2]... begged her, she, she was, she was,\nshe was at Westerbork, the Dutch concentration camp, she was there when her\nparents then came. And they were both very sick and they first took the sick and\nthey, to the gas chambers and she begged them to please leave Lainie(ph) with her\nbecause that somehow was still possible. Her parents insisted Lainie(ph) would go\nwith them. To Auschwitz. That's what she has to live with. This hard. When we\nwere just in Holland right now, we went to the, May 4\" is Memorial Day and so we\nwent to the Jewish Cemetery in Ossin(ph), which is, most of my father\u2019s family was\nall from northern Holland, from Ossin(ph), Emmen,(ph), Hoanigan(ph), that area,\nand there was, we went to the Jewish, Jewish Cemetery in Holland which\nmiraculously was not destroyed by the Nazis. And they have Memorial there, too,\nto the 500 Dutch Jews who were either taken to Auschwitz from that little town or\nthose who died in the concentration camp in Westerbork and there is my aunt and\nmy uncle and my, and her, and it's my, my cousin's sister and her parents. And so\nthe great blessing of, of being America is at least | don\u2019t have the daily reminders of\nthat either. That at least, here you can, here, not you cannot forget it but at least\nyou don't have the continual reminders of what happened. Where you were, easier.",
        "Q: And what about the other two cousins, you said there\u2019s two others who came to\nAmerica?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How are they doing? Where are they?\nAnita Frank 47\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 47",
        "A: Exceedingly well. | must say, we've all done so well in this country. Yeah, my,\nthey, they were my father\u2019s oldest brother who survived, he\u2019s the only one who\nsurvived, children. He had three children. Their son, Bertus(ph), was | gather, just\na wonderful young man. He was among the first one killed because he was on the\ntrain and made some anti-Nazi remark. When they found out he was a Jew, they\nwere shot immediately. He had two daughters who all, they survived in hiding.\nHetty(ph), the oldest, who just turned 80 as a matter, no, is turning 80 in August 16\",\nshe, she married and, and, she married in 1940, | think just before the war broke out.\nNo, just after the war had broken out. She married July 4\" to a very nice guy and\nthen she had a baby in 1942 and that baby was put in, in with hundreds of other, |\ndon\u2019t know how many hundred, shuffled from one family to the next, her name is\nBetty, after her brother. And then there was Sarai(ph), who was 12 and they, they\nalso, they survived on hidings like we did except | think they were, they were not out\nin the open the way we were. And so they, after the war, we came to America in\n1952, Hetty(ph) and Herman(ph) came in 1953. And we left Holland because\nHolland just, just was not a good place to be in those days. And they, they came to\nCalifornia and did extraordinarily well. Her, she had then three children when the\ncame and those three young ladies all married and have children and have sort of\nlived the American dreams. However, however, as far as I\u2019m concerned, there is\nhorrendous damage in all of them because of the war. On the surface, they are the\nabsolute, outstanding examples of survivors but | know, | know what horrendous pain\nthey've gone through and how, what horrendous damage has been done.\nAnita Frank 48\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 48",
        "Q: Are there any ways that you can describe them when you're with them that you\nsee that come up?",
        "A: | have to be very careful because what\u2019s interesting is that Hetty(ph) and\nHerman(ph) who | adore, just absolutely wonderful people, they did exactly what the\nrest of us did, is that forget it, forget it. Try to forget it, go on with your life. Don't\ntalk about it, don\u2019t deal with it but for heaven\u2019s sakes, and | think that has been a\nhallmark for at least our family, is prove that the Germans, that the Nazis were wrong,\nprove that you're okay. Prove that you're a person of value. And so how do you\nprove that? By accomplishing things. And by golly, did they accomplish. But in that\neffort to accomplish, they, the children, except for the youngest, the two older girls\nhad to fend for, had to fend for themselves a great deal and were to some extent\nneglected. And not because they wanted to do that but because they, they had,\nthey felt they had to work so hard to, to make it in this country. And they did make\nin this country. And then all of that tension and all of the pain was never discussed\nso it, it affected their lives and these girls grew up knowing about their background\npartly but not dealing with it. Not, it, without it being discussed. And so they\nbecome adults and they, they have to deal with it in, in their own way, and, and, again\n| don't wanna talk about their circumstances because that\u2019s not up to me to do so.\nBut | Know, because of my background, that tremendous harm was done and that,\nthere was enormous pain and my, the oldest one, Betty, who is, who, who was born\nduring the war, | mean she knows it, she\u2019s done a lot of talking about it and, and she\nis aware of, of, she\u2019s aware of the horrendous pain. And she also\u2019s been trying, try\nAnita Frank 49\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 49\nto do her best and yet has not really actualized herself the way I, phenomenal\npotential, highly intelligent young woman. They all are very bright, very competent.\nBut unlike my family, where my parents never were successful, though they spent,\nso they spent a lot of time with us, we, we have, | think, my sisters, we have all really\ntruly actualized ourselves, intellectually, emotionally. | don\u2019t, except for the\nyoungest, who came along young enough that | think her parents had more time for\nher, the other two just haven't. And | think it\u2019s causing, it\u2019s caused a lot of pain. And\nthen the war years, again, the, the lack of open discussions, up until lately, up until\njust the last couple of years, means that there\u2019s all this stuff in your background and\nyou, you know something went wrong but you don't, you don't discuss it. You\npretend everything is just perfect and wonderful and they're prototype of that.\nEverything is perfect and wonderful always. Particularly with Hetty and Herman(ph),\nwhen you talk to them, man, it\u2019s always perfect.",
        "Q: Like the Ozzie Nelson family?",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: The Nelson family? What was that show, Father Knows Best? We, in America\nwe had all these programs that made the typical American family seem so perfect.",
        "A: Perfect, yes.",
        "Q: Nothing ever went wrong, noone...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ever humiliated the family?\nAnita Frank 50\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 50",
        "A: Absolutely and everybody's always doing, everybody\u2019s always doing perfectly and\nthe kids are always great, and this is fine and this Is fine and this is fine. That's, you\nget that particularly from the parents more than from the, from the daughters. And\nyou just, | wanna, sometimes say for God sakes, that\u2019s not really what\u2019s going on and\n| know it and how much healthier to be able to deal with it and recognize that there is\npain and misery.",
        "Q: And your sisters, is there a contrast in how they dealt with recovering from those\ntraumas?",
        "A: Yeah. I\u2019ve been by far the most verbal, by far. That's because | have the best\nmemory, too. They, Ingrid is two years, one year younger and Helga\u2019s two years\nyounger. So, | was six when the war broke out, Ingrid\u2019s five and Helga was four\nand | have much better memories than, than they do. | also, | also developed myself\nintellectually, I\u2019m the, I\u2019m the only one who immediately went to college and then to\ngraduate school and ended up with a PhD. They, | have enormous, enormous\nrespect for my sisters. They, they both went to nursing school and became nurses.\nBut then my youngest sister went on and went to college and got her degree and\nthen went on and became a, a nurse pediatric clinician. So, and this, she is a\nremarkable young lady, | mean was, she, all of us did very badly in Holland.\nAcademically, all of us fell apart. And Helga, my youngest sister developed a\nhorrendous thyroid condition and, and stopped learning and stopped, she just, oh,\ntense and miserable and unhappy. So when, so she didn\u2019t go to school anymore.\nSo she was 14 and missed enormous amounts of school. We came to America,\nAnita Frank 51\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 51\nagain thank God, and, and, and she, we came to America in December of \u201952 and\nthe following summer, she was operated on in Jewish hospital and they took out this\nhuge goiter. It was benign and she grew five inches. She was just tiny developed\nand went back to school and she\u2019s a very bright young lady. But she had to,\nwhereas | sort of followed the classic route high school and college and graduate\nschool, she, they went to nursing school which doesn't really, in those days, she\ndidn't go to the university but to a hospital nursing program so they never had the\nchance to really develop their, oh how do | say this, their intellect in a way that | had.\nAnd so they did it later and then Ingrid also went to college and ended up as a, she,\nshe graduated also from college so they, in their adulthood, they did phenomenally\nand Helga, my youngest sister is, has just done spectacularly. She worked for the\nWorld Council of Nurses and does workshops around the world on delivering primary\ncare in underserved areas. She is a expert on, on infant and maternal healthcare.",
        "Q: But so did their recovery come later if they examined some of these issues later?",
        "A: You know we all have different backgrounds. | was the child who tried to be\nperfect, so | had this total sense of worthlessness so my recovery had to be believing\nmyself again. My middle sister, | don\u2019t think, | mean my middle sister has also\naccomplished a great deal. Build a business but | think still suffers tremendously\nfrom low self-esteem, a lack of self-worth. So | don\u2019t think, | don\u2019t think she has\nrecovered and they have not dealt with it as extensively. My youngest sister, it's\nhard for me to say. She functions exquisitely. She is married, has four children, is\na grandmother, just, just also has fulfilled the American dream. A wonderful mother,\nAnita Frank 52\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 52\nwonderful grandmother, but also | don\u2019t think has, we can talk. She and | can talk.\nBut | don\u2019t think she has worked as extensively as | have at sort of making all the\nconnections so | cannot, okay, the way, and so the way it manifested for her that she,\nlike me, when she was raising her children, she also had to be perfect. She also\nhad to do everything right. She also had to cope. She also never could complain.\nShe\u2019s another one of those, and so is my middle sister too, unbelievable women who\njust do. Just like my mother. But in the process of doing for others, that\u2019s not so\nhot either because then your children don't really get the message that they need to\ndo for themselves so what we have done to our children, we\u2019ve done too much for\nour children. And | think that |, more than the others, was aware of that. | think\nthat\u2019s the big difference, that in raising our son, that | would, that | was over, | was\noverprotective of him but from the very beginning | would say to him, \u201cLoren(ph), this\nis my problem, not your problem. | am sorry that | need to know where you are all\nthe time. It\u2019s not because | don\u2019t trust you, it\u2019s because inside of me, | cannot still\ncannot believe that you're really, that, that you're gonna be with me. That | just to\nknow. So please, please understand where I\u2019m coming from.\u201d So from the very\nbeginning I, | would, | would, when | did those things that could have been destructive,\n| let Loren(ph) know that it wasn\u2019t his fault and that was my problem and because he\nis so incredibly bright and sensitive, he understood and tolerated that. So he, he\nhas all his life been willing to, to work with me and let me know where he is, | mean\nthat's been the major thing. Let, just let me Know where you are and he's always\ndone so, throughout his adolescence. If he would be late, he\u2019d call me up. Never\nAnita Frank 53\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 53\nresented it. And, and | think part of it was that | let him know that, | let him know\nwhat my problems were because of the war. My overprotectiveness, my fear of\nlosing him. Whereas my sisters, | think did the same thing but in a, they, they didn't\nquite communicate all these ideas to their children. Now the kids have been, they're\nfine but, but, but whereas Loren(ph) has extraordinarily high self-esteem,\nextraordinarily, | mean, is so confident about who he is and so directed and so\npurposeful and so at peace with himself. |, he is, he is a, he\u2019s one of the healthiest\npeople I\u2019ve ever met in my life. And | think that a lot of it has to do with, with my\nunderstanding of my own neuroses. And talking about those things with him from\nthe time he was very small.",
        "Q: And where is he now?",
        "A: Loren(ph) is at MIT. He is a third year graduate student at MIT, in cognitive\nsystems neuroscience. He is a, he is a, he is an incredible, wonderful young man.",
        "Q: And he graduated, did he graduate from Carlton(ph)?",
        "A: He graduated from Carlton(ph). He went here to the Academy, Albuquerque\nAcademy, and graduated from Carlton(ph) College just ...",
        "Q: In Minneapolis?",
        "A: In, in Northfield, Northfield south of Minneapolis. Summa cum laude and the\nwhole bit. Phi Beta Kappa and whatever else and got a National Science\nFoundation Fellowship which is to, to MIT. Pretty much had his choice of where he\nwanted to go and has just been this incredibly, incredibly bright, but more, even more\nimportant than that, sensitive, aware and healthy. This, this incredibly healthy\nAnita Frank 54\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 54\nhuman being who is the exact opposite of the classic Nazi follower. Loren(ph)\ndoesn't take anything for granted. Loren(ph) will question anything. Loren(ph) will\nexplore. Loren(ph) will research. Loren(ph), | mean |, it's one of the great joys,\nLoren(ph) thinks for himself.",
        "Q: Which is probably one of your larger goals with him?",
        "A: From the very beginning. We would have, my, Alan is a psychiatrist and I\u2019m in\nthis field also and so we discuss always discuss ideas with him, always. And ask\nhis opinion and he, from the time he was very young, had these remarkable insights\ninto people! Incredible insights into people. But the very beginning we would\nencourage these discussions and encourage the questioning and, and never insist\nthat he do it our way, just really encouraging to do it his way within a framework of\ncourse, of limits. | mean, I\u2019m not saying there weren't limits, there were limits, but,\nand it\u2019s just had such a huge payoff because he\u2019s so inner directed and motivated\nand at peace with himself with who he is. The exact opposite of who | was, it\u2019s just\namazing.",
        "Q: Does he see the world as a very safe place for him basically?",
        "A: | think he sees himself, which is to me the clue to happiness, he sees himself as\nbeing safe in this world. It\u2019s not that the world is safe and | don't, | know the world\nisn't safe but | also now feel safe in this world because | know! can cope. And that\u2019s\nhow Loren(ph) feels. Loren(ph) is safe. Loren(ph) is convinced that he can do what\nhe wants to do, meaning, not in that he can do anything he wants to do but that when\nhe sets his, when he sets his mind on accomplishing something, he will accomplish\nAnita Frank 995\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 55\nit. He\u2019s totally inner directed, he has complete sense, internal sense of locus(ph)\ncontrol. And, and a complete belief that things will work out for him because he is\nsafe in this world. And it\u2019s amazing, | feel safe in this world now, too. It's amazing\nwhen you feel that way, how things do go right. And it\u2019s not because the world is\nSafe.",
        "Q: Right, | asked the question sort of backwards.",
        "A: Yeah, no, but I, | think you\u2019re hitting critical perspective from my, because, because\nwe were raised, | mean we, my sisters, my brother and | were raised in this\nhorrendously dangerous world. | mean the world was so unsafe for us and it\nremained unsafe for so many years and the clue to happiness, the clue to no, the\nclue to our well-being has been to be able to begin to feel safe in this, in this world.\nAnd that\u2019s not an easy transition to make because it basically means you stop looking\nat the outer world to become safe for you but you, you become safe within yourself.",
        "Q: How do you do that?",
        "A: Hard work. Hard work. It\u2019s, it's, as | work with people, that\u2019s what | really try and\nteach them is how do you do that and, and, for me, the, the single most important\nclue is that when | was so unsafe and felt so defeated, | let the whole world define\nme. Itwas Anita who had to be this perfect, obedient, good, accepting, non-creative\nbasically, because if | did anything creative, my goodness, it might annoy people so\nthis trapped in a, in a box person who tried to please everybody and tried to avoid\nmaking anybody mad so that at least | would get positive input from others. | mean\ngoing back to Elizabeth Dixon is, she, | had to translate that at least she values me.\nAnita Frank 56\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 56\nWell, if she values me, there must be some value to me \u2018cause | didn\u2019t feel it. So it\nis stopping that, it\u2019s stopping looking to others to make you feel safe and begin to\nreally get to Know yourself and define yourself. It\u2019s at self-definition. It's knowing\nwho you are. Its Knowing your strengths, knowing your weaknesses. It is when\npeople are mad at you, it's not to say oh my gosh, I'm a bad person but to say, oh,\nyou're mad atme. Well, who's problem is it? Is it your problem, is it really something\nI've done? If it\u2019s something I\u2019ve done, that\u2019s something | can learn from. What do |\nneed to, | need to work on changing that so it\u2019s not closing myself off from others, it\u2019s\nremaining open to the input that others give me but at a very, on a very limited basis.\nBecause | recognize that everybody else is probably crazier than | am and to let other\npeople define me, hah! What a joke that is. | mean we, the Nazis defined us as dirty,\nfilthy Jews worthy of extermination. No one will ever define me again. So it\u2019s partly\nagain, it\u2019s a reaction to that. Nobody will define me. | will define myself. But within\nthe context of my environment so to avoid becoming this extreme narcissist, you, you\nwant to remain open to input but you want to weigh it against what you know about\nyourself. That\u2019s, and this way you keep on growing and the, and the most wonderful\nthing is the more at peace you are with yourself, the nicer you can be to other people.\nYou don't, cause you don't have to destroy others to feel good about yourself. Asa\nmatter of fact, it hurts you to be negative or destructive to others and so you know\nthat those who are destructive, there\u2019s something wrong with them. Because if you\ntruly feel good about yourself, you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to hurt others, cause it hurts\nyou if you are.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnita Frank of\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 57",
        "Q: Did you ever go through any psychotherapy and examine these kinds of issues?",
        "A: Never. I\u2019ve done a lot of it, no.",
        "Q: And you married the man who is in the field.",
        "A: Yeah. Who never psychoanalyzed me, ever, ever, ever. Whose greatest gift to\nme | still think is to basically say, Anita you\u2019ve gotta go take care of yourself. And\nAnita thought, okay, | don\u2019t particularly like that but that makes a lot of sense. And\nwho said, okay, I\u2019m gonna do this and that has been Alan\u2019s lack of control over me\nand lack of need to, to have me be a particular way but whose support for me, for\nmyself, whoever | wanted to become was always there. Was just my, has been my\nperfect partner. Absolutely perfect partner. | don\u2019t think | would be the person | am\nnow without sort of having, without having been with that person who was so\nwonderful about letting me be who | basically had a potential to be. Was nice.",
        "Q: Sounds great.",
        "A: Itis. Its wonderful, it\u2019s rare. It\u2019s so rare.",
        "Q: And even more rare probably for people in their fifties and, and in terms of man\nbeing that way...",
        "A: Oh yes, and particularly for a psychiatrist. My goodness, after all they know how\nthe world works. As far as he was concerned, he didn\u2019t and it was up to me to figure\nit out for myself. And |, what is interesting in my work with people, I\u2019ve learned a lot\nfrom working with people. They have been my teachers. Right now | work at the\nmedical school. | have a wonderful job at the medical school but when | worked with\nAnita Frank 58\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 58\npatients, | learned from them. And | learned what not to do and I, I, | integrated and\nincorporated all those ideas in my own, in my own behavior.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s when you were counseling?",
        "A: Yeah, then |, for years | did counseling. My way. Never anybody else\u2019s way,\nalways my way.",
        "Q: What does that mean? What rules did you break?",
        "A: Oh, | broke all the rules. | broke every rule and that is that the classic rules of\ncounseling are that all these worries about transference and counter-transference\nand all this other garbage and how you need to let the patient come up with all the\nsolutions and how you don't insert yourself into it and how you don't, all these things.\n| broke every single one of those rules. And what | basically, what I, the way |\nperceived it, it was more reeducating people, the way | had to reeducate myself and\nthat is to help people to begin to define, learn how to define themselves and, and\nbegin to appreciate themselves and how, how to do that. I\u2019ve got a whole schema\nfor doing that and, and | would come up with ideas but always in such a way that |\nwould say look. I\u2019m just gonna share these with you. These are tools. It,\neverything is in your control. Everything is within your power so always leave you\nthe power and leave in the control with, with my clients. And as a result, | could\ndevelop very equal relationships and people never saw me as telling what to do but\nit was a sharing which was super healing. _ It, it just, and it was amazing how quickly\npeople, not everybody but an overwhelming majority were able to just begin to look\nat their life from a different perspective and learn different ways of dealing with it.\nAnita Frank 59\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 59",
        "Q: So in other words, you didn\u2019t exercise that power that the authority figure or expert\nhas?",
        "A: Exactly, never. | was never the expert. | always let them know they were the\nexpert. All that | had were some tools and some ideas that | was willing to share\nwith them. But they had to tell me whether they fit it, they might not, and | would tell\nthem, look, this may not be right for you. Let me know, you know better than | do.\nIf we talk about something that, that you don\u2019t, you find offensive, let me know. So\nthat it was, | was, I\u2019ve never been the expert. | mean, and I, in my work at the\nmedical school, |\u2019m trying to teach our medical students, that as future physicians,\nit\u2019s still the patient who is the expert on the patient.",
        "Q: That\u2019s novel.",
        "A: It's not the physician. The physician may be the expert on the disease and on\nsome treatment but the patient is the expert on, on what's wrong with the patient\nand if you don\u2019t respect that and don't elicit from the patient what's going on and what\nthey think what\u2019s going on, you're gonna lose three quarters of your information.\nAnd particularly true in management of illness is that, always three quarters of that is\nwithin the patient's domain. Because | can't prescribe, | mean, that\u2019s why | will tell\nwith my clients, | mean | can suggest that you might try this but it\u2019s up to you to do it.\nNow is this going to be possible for you? And some of them will say, yes and | say\nwell, how do you see yourself doing this? It\u2019s letting always your clients come up with\na plan, always have them, have them come up with the ideas as much as possible\nabout what\u2019s gonna work for them. And have them be in charge of their own healing\nAnita Frank 60\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 60\nbecause only then is there gonna be a chance that they will actually pursue the ideas.\nBut if | tell somebody else what to do, the chance of \u2018em doing it are very small. It\nshouldn't, and so to that, and, but where | differ from classic counseling is that | will\ncome up with, | will say, | won't say a lot of counseling is how do you feel about this,\nhow do you feel about this, how do you feel about this. |, like you feel about it is only\nmarginally useful. | much more focus, okay, what are you gonna do about it. I\u2019m\nmuch more focused\nEnd of Tape 2.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnita Frank 61\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 61\nTape 3",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s, it's going back to, to my, my the difference is that, and that, that has, that\ngoes back to my history is you need to understand how your past has impacted on\nyou. That's critical because otherwise you remain a victim of your past. But then\nyou need to free yourself from your past as much as possible. Now, | won't ever be\nable to free myself completely and that\u2019s okay because | should never forget. But\nwhat | can do and what also my clients mostly need to do is they need to overcome\nthe horrendous messages of their childhood. They need to take control over their\nlives and so | prefer focusing on the healing process instead of on the, just\non the past.",
        "Q: And, and it worked for you ...",
        "A: Exactly right.",
        "Q: And you've seen it work for your patients as well?",
        "A: Yes. It works unbelievably well. Unbelievably well with my clients.",
        "Q: And what is the actual class that you teach, at, is it U and M Medical?",
        "A: | don't teach, | don't teach classes necessarily. | teach on the behavioral\nscientists for the, we have a problem-based learning curriculum at our medical\nschool.",
        "Q: A what based?",
        "A: Problem-based learning. It basically means that they have, it\u2019s a modified\nproblem-based learning so they meet in tutorial groups and there is a lot of\nresponsibility for self learning, for hypothesizing. | mean all the things, all the things\nAnita Frank 62\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 62\nthat | think are important, thinking, problem-solving, analyzing and my job as the\nbehavioral scientist, | see as my major job is to, to teach our medical students to see\npatients at the partners, as their partners and not as diseases because medical\nschool is heavily biological and so our, our physicians are trained to look at the\ndisease process and at very little else. And so my major job is to keep the patient\nin mind, and to keep the patient as the focus and to deal with the patient as a partner\nand not just as the carrier of a disease. And it\u2019s very exciting and, and I\u2019m\nparticularly interested in the management treatment part of it where basically the\npatient should, we should have very different approaches. Physicians have a\ntendency to tell patients what to do, this is what you should, without explaining much,\nwithout looking at a patient\u2019s circumstances to see whether in effect they can one,\nbuy the medicine, take, take the medicine. Can they relax, can they adhere, do they\nunderstand what's going on? What are the pressures, what are the miseries, what\nare the situations at home? | mean, you can tell somebody to stop smoking, well,\nthat\u2019s not gonna to do a bit of good. You need to understand what role smoking\nplays in this, this person\u2019s life. And are they interested in quitting? And where are\nthey and how often have they tried? So, it\u2019s a, its a much of a comprehensive,\npatient-centered approach. Very respectful of the patient.",
        "Q: Sounds awfully new to me.",
        "A: That's what most people say. But that\u2019s what we are, we hope to accomplish at\nour medical school and we're succeeding. Our, our young, our medical students are\nAnita Frank 63\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 63\nwonderful, wonderful. Not all, but most. And very tuned into this. It\u2019s really, it\u2019s\nwonderful to talk with them and, and see their sensitivity.",
        "Q: How old or new is this program?",
        "A: We're going in our fourth year. So. We're having our fourth class. Our, our first\nclass is graduating next year and they're sort of my babies. They\u2019re, | came in with\nthem and they're, I\u2019m gonna miss \u2018em a lot.",
        "Q: It\u2019s exciting.",
        "A: Itis. They\u2019re wonderful. It\u2019s a great place to work.",
        "Q: It also sounds good on the level that | interviewed a doctor for a story | was working\non recently and he said, \u201cPeople don't realize how prone physicians are to problems;\ndrug problems, stress, enormous, enormous stress.\u201d So it sounds like perhaps this\ngives them some tools to work on their problems too.",
        "A: Yes. Verynice. Yes. Because we expect physicians to be super-human. And\nthey're just people, bright people on the whole, and caring people on the whole. But\nthat\u2019s all they are. And one of the great tragedies is is that in the traditional\napproach, our physicians are taught, it becomes, because they tend to be obsessive-\ncompulsive, they tend to be perfectionists, they tend to be hard-driven and so on.\nWhat they want to do is they want to fix things. And they're happy when they can\nfix something. And when they can't fix something, they get very unhappy and very\nstressed and so what happens very often is that, particularly during the dying process\nwhen they can\u2019t do anymore for a patient, they abandon the patient. Because they\ncant do anymore. And so you see this avoidance behavior. That's because\nAnita Frank 64\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 64\nthey're uncomfortable. They can't, they can't fix, the other focus for me is is that\nthere is very little fixing you guys can do. _ If you\u2019re lucky you can cut out a, you can\ncure a bacterial illness with some antibiotics and you can cut out a cancer and you\ncan do, you can do some other things that truly fix things. But most of the time, it\nisn\u2019t as simple as that. Most of the time you just have to learn to work with your\npatient to make it as, to make it better. But that means you need to be in partnership\nwith your patient. And don\u2019t worry so much about fixing it.",
        "Q: And, and don\u2019t take all the responsibility.",
        "A: Don't take all the responsibility. Leave the responsibility where it belongs but then\nbehave in ways that you communicate that clearly. |, that\u2019s certainly what I\u2019ve done\nin my counseling, always left the power with my clients. Always.",
        "Q: And you learned that through your own experience?",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. And, and even in my, that, that has worked so well for\nme because even when | was, when Loren(ph) was small and | was raising him and\nas he went on to high school, middle school and high school, we'd have discussions\nabout smoking and drugs and work and I'd say, I'd, | remember saying, \u201cLoren,\u201d(ph),\nremember this conversation, \u201cLoren(ph), do you think you'll, you'll\u2019, well | knew he\nwould never smoke. Because when he was three years old, my husband's ex-\nbrother-in-law came who sat in this house for two days smoking two to three packs\nof cigarette a day, cigarettes a day and drinking all our sherry. We had a bottle of\nsherry. And smoking in the bedroom and putting the cigarette, his butts, his butts\nand his matches next to the bed. Anyway, Loren(ph) came home from school that\nAnita Frank 65\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 65\nfirst day and the house was covered in smoke. It was gray and he said, \u201cMommy, it\nstinks.\u201d He was three years old. | said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s cigarettes.\u201d He says, and |\ntook him outside, | didn\u2019t wanna be him, | didn\u2019t him to be in that environment. Well,\n| tell you, as far as he\u2019s concerned, cigarettes have always stunk. So he never\nsmoked. But then when he went to high school, | talked to him about, | said,\n\u201cLoren(ph), what do you think about alcohol and drugs? Do you think you\u2019re ever\ngoing to try those things?\u201d And his response to me was, \u201cI don\u2019t know, how can | tell\nya?\u201d | said, \u201cWell, what do you think right now? Do you think that you\u2019re, that, do\nyou see yourself as experimenting with, with drugs?\u201d \u201cWell, | might.\u201d | said, \u201cWell,\nLoren(ph), | just want you to know, it\u2019s gonna be your life that you\u2019re gonna louse up.\n| mean, it\u2019s gonna hurt me but it\u2019s gonna be your life, not my life.\u201d | said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got\nthis magnificent brain, if you wanna destroy it, you wanna ruin it by getting into drugs,\nit's gonna be your problem. And | just, it\u2019s hard for me to imagine that you would be\nthat stupid.\u201d Left it at that. Same thing with working. \u201cLoren(ph), if you decide not\nto work here, we're paying a lot of tuition, if you decide, | mean, your part of the\nbargain is for you to, to put in your effort. If you decide not to do that, I\u2019m gonna\nregret it but again, you're gonna be doing the most harm to yourself. And, and, in the,\nI'm not interested in paying a lot of tuition for you to louse up so again, you make\nthose decisions.\u201d So, early in the game | let him know where | stood, what my hopes\nwere, but always leaving the responsibility with him and he got drunk once in college\n\u2018cause he wanted to find out what getting drunk was like and that was the first and\nlast time he did it. He hated it. He didn't like being out of control.\nAnita Frank 66\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 66",
        "Q: Does he drink at all now?",
        "A: Barely. Nope. Never used drugs. Never smoked.",
        "Q: Coffee?",
        "A: No. Drink, does he drink coffee? |know. Notbecause, we, we offer hima glass\nof wine. We will have some wine sometimes. He doesn\u2019t like alcohol.",
        "Q: Interesting when you have the freedom to abuse yourself.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t have to. He didn\u2019t have to because he knew that, he knew that as far\nas we were concerned, he would punish himself the most. If he was, and | used that\nword stupid several times. | said, \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna be that stupid or it\u2019s hard for me\nto think that you would be that stupid.\u201d So, basically | expressed my total disdain for\nthat kind of behavior. That! could not imagine that somebody as bright as he, and\nthen what I, and the other things | did with him, | always expressed my total\nconfidence in him. | just said, \u201cLoren(ph), you\u2019ve got this just remarkable\u201d, even if\nhe didn't do well, | said, \u201cLoren(ph)\u201d, | said, \u201cI just think you have the intelligence that\nis going to make you shine as you get older. | just believe so strongly in your\npotential.\u201d So that even when he wasn't, when he wasn\u2019t working hard, wasn't doing\nwell | never, it was never ahhh! It was just, just my total overwhelming belief in him,\nas just a young being of enormous value, with enormous value. | wanted to give\nhim everything | never felt or | hadn't felt wnen | was his age.",
        "Q: Or that you would have felt had it not been for the war?",
        "A: Yeah. | think so.",
        "Q: Sounds like your parents were pretty respectful.\nAnita Frank 67\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 67",
        "A: Yes. Yes they were. Absolutely. My father, even when | did so badly in\nHolland, what saved my life was his belief in me as an intelligent person. | know\nthat. If he hadn't been there for me, the whole time. | knew that he thought | was\nsmart. Even though my, my performance absolutely denied it. It was just like, and\nthen indeed, | did better and better and better after | came to America. It seems like\neven now I'm doing better and better and better all the time. It's amazing to me.\nI'm continually learning. My life is continually expanding.",
        "Q: Well, is part of that because you've recovered so, so much, do you think?",
        "A: | think so. | think so.",
        "Q: And that you\u2019ve worked so hard on it?",
        "A: Yeah. There's little doubt in my mind that | have freed myself from those evil\nmessages of my past. | truly have because they controlled me. | truly, | truly have\nfreed myself from those. Totally. Nah, that\u2019s not true, not totally. | still have some\nfears that | can\u2019t get out. | still, | still, wnen my husband doesn\u2019t come home when |\nexpect him to, there\u2019s immediately, my heart just sinks. | still, I\u2019m in terror of losing\nhim or, or my family, my child, yeah. | still have that. 1, | don\u2019t seem to be able to\nget over that.",
        "Q: | think a lot of people have that fear about losing a loved one but do you think\nyours is greater?",
        "A: Yeah. Because | can try to talk myself intellectually out of it and | just, it just, just,\nit just, my feelings, the feelings overwhelm me. Even though, statistically, | should\nAnita Frank 68\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 68\nnot worry about it. But and, it\u2019s gotten better. I\u2019m much better now than | used to\nbe.",
        "Q: Have you thought of buying them cell phones for Christmas?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not so worried about Loren(ph) anymore because Loren(ph) now\nhas a, has a young woman in his life who looks after him so | have now a, and for\nme, instead of a threat to me, it\u2019s a joy because there\u2019s somebody else who loves\nhim and who will look after him so that it\u2019s not totally my responsibility.

        "Q: Okay, I'll just go one by one. | wondered when you left Holland if your family had\na thought or talked at all about going to Israel?",
        "A: Never. It's interesting. No. No. America was always the land of opportunity.\nA lot of the Jewish, the survivors, the Holocaust, the concentration camp survivors, |\nthink, went to Israel and certainly after the war, the children whose parents had been\nkilled and, in Holland, if, if they had fled to Holland from eastern European countries\nto escape Nazism, and, and if those parents were killed, the children were put in\nhiding, those children were all sent to Israel. So, I\u2019m not sure Israel ever came up\nfor us. It\u2019s interesting.\nAnita Frank 69\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 69",
        "Q: Maybe you just didn\u2019t have an opportunity or no one invited you.",
        "A: No. No one invited us. | don't think tt even dawned on us. | mean, it was going\nto America really was to a land of opportunity to sort of, my parents felt that there was\nlittle opportunity for us in Holland. | think they just wanted to get away from it. So,\nIsrael was, | mean too much stress and tension, | mean you, after all these years, |\nthink it would have been very hard to go to a country where that was still the midst of\nturmoil.",
        "Q: And still is.",
        "A: And still is, yes.",
        "Q: Let me move this a little bit closer. Is that okay?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Thanks. And you took a ship [talkover]",
        "A: Oh yeah, the _\u2014_\u2014__| got so seasick.",
        "Q: | just wondered what that was like.",
        "A: Awful, it just, | remember there were two other Dutch girls and fiancee, left Holland,\nthey were just going for a visit and of course we went with my family. And everything\nwe had, my parents sold the furniture because that\u2019s to pay for the voyage so we just\nhad | think, 16 or 17 suitcases and boxes with us, perhaps not that many, nine, | don't\nknow how many. But that was all we had. And it was amazing, it was November\nand it was rough and all, what | remember most from that journey was just being so\nsick to my stomach and throwing up in the bathroom. And then when we got to New\nYork, it was sort of amazing too, \u2018cause we got to New York, and Henry Coster(ph)\nAnita Frank 70\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 70\nand his wife, Peggy, happened to be in New York for, for film, to watch, to watch films\nor plays or whatever itwas. And they knew when we were, when, | guess they knew\nthat, our arrival time. And, and, but we had no idea they would be there so we really\nhad no idea what to do when we got to New York. So it was really interesting. We\nwere waiting for all our luggage to get off the boat. There | saw this man looking and\nI'd seen his picture and | went up to him and | said, \u201cAre you Henry Coster(ph)?\u201d And\nhe says, \u201cYes.\u201d And \u2018cause he didn't recognize us and here we were, you think a\nfamily with four children. But I, |, and why, | just remembered him from his picture,\nso, which was, which turned out to be very nice. He'd rented a big car and found us\na cheap hotel. So we stayed a couple of days in New York and then took the bus to\nSt. Louis. And then seven days later or four days later, | took the bus to California.\nSo, I\u2019m taking a bus ride and coming, coming through Albuquerque for the first time.",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. It was exciting. It was hard for us to imagine what\nAmerica would look like and arriving New York is so overwhelming, all these\nbuildings. One most terrifying things were the, the ambulance sirens, | mean,\nbecause they sound just like our sirens during the war and that was terrifying. Every\ntime we heard sirens, we ducked. So it was really hard getting used to the, to the\nfire engines and the ambulances, the police cars. That was the most distressing\npart. But it was sort of amazing to be in this huge city and | can remember we would\nbuy food and eat in our hotel room. And my mother had some ancient aunts who\nlived in New York, we visited them. Tanta(ph), they were, as a matter of fact, they\nAnita Frank 71\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 71\nwere my grandfather's sisters. Tanta Rebecca(ph), Tanta Rosa(ph). And, and\nthen we, and then my mother had some distant cousins in St. Louis who had agreed\nto help us and so we stayed there for couple of weeks. My parents did and | went\nto California.",
        "Q: | wondered also if you have, still have contact with that Jewish American soldier\nyou met during the Liberation time?",
        "A: Bob Fenton(ph)? No.",
        "Q: Is that his name?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The one who also brought you to Paris?",
        "A: Yes. No, he died, he died of melanoma, | think, many, many years ago. But,\nand his wife remarried, Mary Fenton(ph) and they moved to the east coast and | think\nmy youngest sister, Helga, has had some contact with her but | haven't. We did,\nafter we came to America because he lived in California and when my parents moved\nto California in 1958, they spent some time with him. And so they were friends, they\nremained friends. But then he, | forgot my, and then in 1965, my parents moved to\nWashington because that\u2019s where | was and | think we lost contact then.",
        "Q: And, and how was it that you actually met him?",
        "A: Oh, my sister, my youngest sister Helga would pick them up. I, she, this was, we\nlived in, in this little town near Falkenburg , In Holland, Lindbergh(ph),\nand what we would do, the American soldiers, the white soldiers were, were sort of\nbivouacked in, in a hotel and then the blacks were right across the fields in tents.\nAnita Frank 72\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 72\nAnd we'd go down and just sort of stand there, my mother had always told us not to\never ask for anything \u2018cause that was impolite, so, American soldiers just adored us\nbecause there were cute little girls, eight, six, seven and eight. And they just looked\nthere, at the, at these soldiers and so we always ended up with the most goodies.\nAnd I'm not quite sure but my youngest sister, Helga, she\u2019d, she\u2019d come home, she\njust sort of told him to come with us, so, so, one day Bob Fenton(ph) came. One\nday she came home with a chaplain and said, \u201cMommy, that\u2019s the best | could find.\u201d\nGood taste. So, it was mostly that, it was safe, totally safe for us those days. And\nwe just sort of, I\u2019m not quite sure in retrospect, that we just asked them to come home\nwith us. And of course they would, they loved being in a home \u2018cause these poor\nguys had been out in a field and so on so, it was fun and it was incredible to meet\nJewish soldiers \u2018cause that immediately formed a tie. | can remember, was another\nsoldier named Jimmy. Jimmy would knock us on our head and he also told us that\nthe first one who learned Mary Had a Little Lamb would get ten cents. | won ten\ncents. And then, first one my father taught me, my first words in English were, he\nsaid, \u201cIf people ask you if you speak English, just answer, just, just a few words.\u201d So\nmy, my first knowledge of English consisted of just a few words. And those were\nthe only words | knew. But! learned English quickly. It's amazing how quickly we\npicked up.",
        "Q: And Bob Fenton(ph), do you remember anything in particular about that friendship\nbecause it seemed lasted, it\u2019s beyond ...\nAnita Frank 73\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 73",
        "A: Oh yes, well, what happened in those days is that the, after, they, we had were\nliberated these soldiers would go to, they went to Germany. And they sent us\npackages from Germany. And they went into homes and | guess stole, stole\nclothings. For quite a while, we were clothed in German, dresses and stuff like that.\nSort of hate the thought now but in those days, that was all we had. And yeah, we\njust, he was just a lovely guy and he stayed in touch with us. He was tall and dark\nhair, curly dark hair, and just warm and caring and it was just, it, it, you cannot imagine\nwhat it is like to look at soldiers and know they could kill you. For four years that\nthey were these dangerous creatures. And then to get, have the Americans come\nand have them be your friends and your liberators and your lifesavers basically, it\u2019s,\nit's an extraordinary feeling so of course we felt all this love and warmth for American\nsoldiers. They really represented everything that was, well our life. They\nrepresented our life to us.",
        "Q: And a Jewish soldier probably himself felt quite a bit, knowing what, what Jews\nhad been through.",
        "A: I'm not sure, that was before they went into Germany, was 1944. I\u2019m not sure\nthey, those soldiers knew. | don't think so. | don't think so. That was before they\nliberated the concentration camps. | think Auschwitz, the, the Soviets liberated\nAuschwitz. So | don't think the Americans were as aware. _| think the first German\nconcentration camp, camp liberated was Dachau and then Bergen-Belsen by the\nBritish. Was a while | think before the Americans just recognized, whether they\nAnita Frank 74\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 74\neven, whether these soldiers actually knew, | doubt, | mean the government and\nother people knew but I\u2019m not sure the soldiers knew.",

        "A: Yes, it could have, yes it could have. | know.",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s another cause for deep and long rumination.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you happen to choose Russian studies as a ...",
        "A: Oh my goodness. Well, | was at Washington University and | remember my first\nmajor was chemistry and that didn't work out so well. | decided | wasn't a born\nchemist. And then | went to French, and then one day | took a political science\ncourse and sometimes you just hit your love and | just absolutely became enchanted\nwith political science and | was already a junior in college. And! was just fascinated\nby the Soviet Union. It was my first course with international relations course and |\nbecame fascinated by the Soviet Union. And I\u2019m trying to think why. I, | don\u2019t know\nwhy. In retrospect the, it was a country that was mysterious, they were, this was in\nthe fifties, | went to college in \u201954 to \u201858. So that was the height of the Cold War.\nAnd | think it just grabbed my attention perhaps because of my experiences during\nthe war as it was Nazi power, with the Nazi Germany as a great power, that perhaps,\nAnita Frank 75\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 75\nperhaps | felt that understanding the Soviet Union better might help me do something\nworthwhile or some, something like that. It was certainly not because | had any\nCommunist interest. It was truly because the Soviet Union represented danger |\nthink and, and another great power and fascination. And then I, then | went to\nHarvard in the Russian Studies program and | was, and | was right because it was a\nwonderful choice because it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a, has an unbelievable history. Russian history\nis, is unbelievable history. And the Russian, and | spent a lot of time in the Soviet\nUnion and the Russian people are remarkable people in many ways so it, it, intuitively\n|, | just picked the right country to be particularly interested in.",
        "Q: That\u2019s great. That also leads to another question about what you did for the\nRand(ph) Corporation?",
        "A: | did research on Soviet Military and Foreign Affairs. | actually read Pravda and\n, the papers and translated articles and really tried to come up with themes\nand sort of whether we could learn anything from the open press. But! was a\nresearch assistant to senior researchers in, in Soviet foreign and military affairs.",
        "Q: What does the Rand(ph) Corporation do?",
        "A: Well, they, they were the research organization for the Air Force really. And they\nprimarily did military, they did primarily military and economic and foreign policy\nresearch for the Air Force. It was sort of, it was the research arm of the Air Force.\nNow they've expanded. They, they do a lot of research in health areas. _| still think\nthat their major contractor is the Air Force but they've, they do, they do superb\nresearch. They attracts very high caliber people and but now they've expanded to\nAnita Frank 76\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 76\nresearch in education, research on health issues, research on public welfare issues\nand prison, prison systems. They, they tend to do massive studies. They, drug,\ndrug intervention studies. So they\u2019ve expanded far away a focus on international\nand, and foreign affairs issues of, in China, Russia, Europe. | mean they, they cover\nthe whole field to, to now also national issues.",
        "Q: And did you speak Russian as well?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. That's what we studied, | studied at Harvard. And then | spent, |\nspent about ten and a half months in the Soviet Union as a guide in American exhibit.\nThat certainly helped my Russian a lot. But tragically, I\u2019ve forgotten most of it now\nbecause | haven't used it in so long but one of the great experiences in my life was\nbeing a guide on a, ona U.S., part of the U.S. - Soviet cultural exchange program.\nIncredible experience. That's where | met Elizabeth Dixon, was in, in Moscow.\nWas it Moscow or Leningrad? Leningrad, was Leningrad, were in Leningrad.\n[talkover] Near St. Petersburg.",
        "Q: Americans would come over and you would show them around and talk about the\nhistory ...",
        "A: No, Americans, Russians. This was a U.S., a U.S. sponsored exhibit, American\nexhibit in the Soviet Union. So we'd speak to Russians. They'd come and see the\nwonders of, of America and one of the great experiences, I'll never forget and of\ncourse this was still in the early sixties, still the Cold War was raging. One of the,\nseveral very powerful experiences there. One was a man came and he was a, he\nwas a Party member and he was telling us about the glories of the Soviet Union and\nAnita Frank 77\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 77\nhe was seemed exceedingly nice and he asked us about the United States and he\nasked about unemployment and racism and we were very open about...\n[End of side one of tape 3]",
        "Q: Could you go back to you were open about the [talkover]",
        "A: That, they would ask a lot about the negative things: unemployment, racism,\ndiscrimination, poverty, etc., etc., and we'd, we'd very, were very open about that\nunlike the Soviets where everything had to be perfect. But yes, that we had those\nissues but the way it had been, it was so interesting, on the one hand they were told\nthat they must overtake the United States. On the other hand they were told what a\nterrible country America was. Now it\u2019s pretty hard to overtake a country that is so\nterrible so there was some internal, were some internal contradictions. But anyway,\nthis guy came and so he asked, he was very kind and he asked all these sort of\nquestions about unemployment and yeah. | talked with him and then | happened to\nsee him outside of the exhibit hall in, in, sort of on the stairs. And we started to talk\nand it turns out, he\u2019s told me he was Jewish. And | said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m Jewish, too.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cYou are?\u201d And it was just like this total change came, came over him and he\nsaid, \u201cIs there really unemployment in America? Is there really any racism ?\u201d | mean,\nit's just like he\u2019s, talk the party line but then when it came to trusting me because he\nfelt that he could, it was just like questioning everything. So that was sort of, yeah,\nand | said, \u201cyes, we do,\u201d but, I, | tried to put in context of yes, there is racism but\nthere\u2019s also something we're working on. Yes, there is unemployment but people\nare not just out in the streets starving to death, we have unemployment. | mean just\nAnita Frank 78\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 78\ntrying to put an end to, and there's yes, there is poverty. | mean, we've got all the\nproblems but you look, anyway. And so that was, that was sort of a nice story and\nthen another, one of the most touching stories was in, in, | think it was in Leningrad,\nit was in Leningrad again. The first one was in Moscow, the second one was in\nLeningrad, now St. Petersburg. Where a woman came and wanted a San Francisco\nphone book and, and | gave her the phone book and she looked up some addresses\nand, and then disappeared. Just before the exhibit closed, the same woman came\nback and her face was just beaming. She was absolutely, she said, \u201cI found my\nsister.\u201d And she, her sister had left, also Jewish. The sister had left for the United\nStates before the war and she hadn\u2019t heard from her in, that was, this was now \u201965,\nin 25 years. And she'd found her sister's name in the phone book, had telegrammed\nher or called her and she sent, she showed me the telegram from her sister. |, |,\nshe said, \u201cOverjoyed at hearing from you.\u201d So it brought, and it, couple of times,\nsome Russians, particularly Jews, found relatives that had gone to America because\nwe had phone books from all over the country, so.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "A: Yeah and amazing stories.",
        "Q: Did you feel a particular warmth for the Russian people having sacrificed so much\nduring World War II?",
        "A: Yes. Absolutely. And | think they felt that warmth with me because | could\nunderstand them. | mean, what, what they had suffered was beyond imagination.\nAnd so | think they could feel from me my enormous sympathy for them. And\nAnita Frank 79\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 79\nwhereas for most Americans they did not know Russian history as much nor did they\nunderstand the horrors, particularly what Leningrad went through. Leningrad and\nKiev turned out that both exhibits went to Moscow, Kiev and Leningrad. And Kiev\nalso was just destroyed and of course in Kiev we had the, the horrendous massacre\nof the Jews at Babiy Yar. And so we went to Babiy Yar and, and it was interesting\nthat particularly the, in Kiev, the survivors, the, the Jewish survivors connected\nstrongly with those of us, we didn\u2019t have too many Jews in the exhibit, but connected\nstrongly with those of us who were Jewish. And it was, it was, it was a wonderful\nthing. It was a real connector. It just transcended, being Jewish transcended\nnationality.",
        "Q: And the Cold War?",
        "A: And the, and the, and the Cold War. It certainly transcended the Cold War, no\nquestion about it.",
        "Q: That's lovely. | wonder if you had any continuing fears that are kind of left over\nscars or wounds from the war. Like you said you feared when your husband was\nlate, do you still or does a knock on the door ever trigger a fear or a siren?",
        "A: No, no, no. Not those things. And |, and | don't have any idea whether this is\nfear-related or whether this related to the war but whereas intellectually I\u2019m totally\ncomfortable with making mistakes, emotionally, when people disapprove of\nsomething that I\u2019ve done or angry with me, it still gives me a pang of ahhhh. But |\nget over that very quickly. It is, but I, but | think that is so common to most of us\nwomen and to most people that I\u2019m not sure where that\u2019s a remnant of the war years\nAnita Frank 80\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 80\nor whether that is, that is a, whether, whether that is just part of being, most, few of\nus sort of like to be corrected or, or criticized or disapproved of so, | think, | still, there\u2019s\npart of me that still wants to please others even though intellectually | know that\u2019s not\nwhat | should be doing. But | know a large part of me is still is into, | mean little\nthings. | will be talking to somebody and | won't ever be the first one to walk away.\nJust always being aware of who else is involved and including them, it\u2019s, somebody\nsays you wanna do that, instead of saying no | can\u2019t, | will say | can, I'll try. It\u2019s that\nstill, | still, part of me still tries to please more than I\u2019m comfortable with. | think that\u2019s\npart of the war. |, | still think that\u2019s part of the old me. But that\u2019s, that\u2019s about it.\nThose are not necessarily bad, bad things. No fears, driving sometimes, | worry\nabout my husband's driving, and I'm always but that\u2019s common. No, it\u2019s amazing,\n| really don\u2019t. My mother did but! don\u2019t. That's one of the great blessings of having\nbeen a child. | didn\u2019t integrate, at least | did not integrate the horror of the war, |\nreally didn't. |, that\u2019s not fair. 1, not the way | would have as an adult because I, as\nnow, I\u2019m totally aware of what happened but as a child all | knew that | would be killed\nif they discovered if, which is a heavy thing for a child to live with. But! did not\nunderstand everything else that was going on. That was not until much later. So,\nthank God | didn\u2019t, I, it\u2019s beyond my understanding how concentration camp survivors\ncan live with all their memories. _ It\u2019s, it\u2019s unbearable and for some it\u2019s so unbearable\nthat, in effect, it\u2019s, I've heard one of my friends who survived four concentration camps\nincluding, as a matter of fact he\u2019s a Schindler, he was on Schindler's list for a while.\nHe\u2019s a Schindler Jew. And he survived the Auschwitz and | think Dachau-\nAnita Frank 81\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 81\nBookenvalt(ph) and he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t survive.\u201d And | totally understand that. Totally\nunderstand that. He\u2019s living, he lives still. But you don\u2019t survive that. So I\u2019m\nintensely grateful that | don\u2019t have to live with those horrendous memories.",
        "Q: I've also noticed and, and again | don't know ff this is related at all to the Holocaust\nor this is just your family, but it seems like there\u2019s an extraordinary number of people\nin your close family who are in caring professions like medicine, nursing ...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Psychiatry, helping, helping, helping. Is that just a family trait or is that at alla\nwar and Holocaust related do you think?",
        "A: Huh. You're absolutely right. | have, | think, | think that is in generally true, that\u2019s\ngenerally true for Holocaust survivors. Many have gone to the helping professions,\nmany have become therapists are staggering, | mean effort to understand the self is\nto help others. Yeah, you wanna do something to make it, to make this a better\nworld. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. | mean, initially | wasn\u2019t, but I've ended up in a\nhelping profession. But even trying to understand the Soviet Union for me was trying\nto understand something that posed a threat, | think in those days.",
        "Q: And perhaps gives you a measure of control ...",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, understand your enemy. Yes. And | think that\u2019s, that\u2019s true for\nmany Holocaust survivors, that that\u2019s, that\u2019s, that's been an area that has been a\nsource of comfort for them is to go into the quote helping professions.",
        "Q: But even then their children too.\nAnita Frank 82\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 82",
        "A: Yeah. Well, they get in, inoculated by us. Yeah, because my sister, my sister's,\nmy youngest sister has one physician and one medical anthropologist, one nurse\nand one molecular biologist. And she\u2019s got two PhD, and an MD and a nurse in her,\nas her four children and my _ middle sister has a nurse, | mean has a medical student,\nand a, be a doctor, and her other daughter wants to be a nursery school teacher and\nthen, my son, I\u2019m not sure, he wants to just figure out how the brain works.",
        "Q: That could be helpful to humanity.",
        "A: Yeah, perhaps, yes.",
        "Q: But on a very intellectual high plane.",
        "A: Very high plane, right.",
        "Q: Probably higher than my own capacity.",
        "A: Oh, way beyond mine, way beyond mine.",
        "Q: When you were babysitting for the Costers,(ph), | wondered if you actually worked\nfor free and, or...",
        "A: | got twelve dollars a week. | got room and board and twelve dollars a week, so.",
        "Q: And | don\u2019t Know what the wages were in those days so is that what regular\nbabysitters got, do you know? Or is that, was there a little bit of payback for his\nhelping to sponsor you guys to come?",
        "A: Again, | don\u2019t really know. I\u2019m, | mean they paid for my room and board. | mean\n|, | lived there and that didn't cost my anything and | could save some money, | didn't\nspend any money. Sometimes they bought me clothes. | never, to be honest, you\nknow what, | never questioned it. And twelve dollars in those days was pretty good\nAnita Frank 83\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 83\nand | cannot tell you, | mean, babysitting, you paid babysitters fifty, fifty cents an hour\nso | think that probably was not an unreasonable amount. Wasa good deal for them\nbecause it gave them the freedom to go out and not have to worry about babysitters\nfor their two boys who were six and nine.",
        "Q: Then your parents didn\u2019t mind giving up their own babysitter?",
        "A: | wasn't a babysitter, | mean my, my sisters were, | was 16, almost 17, they were\n14 and 15 so.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t need you for that.",
        "A: No, not, oh, no, no, no. They, well past that. Besides my parents were, they,\nthey got jobs but girls went to school and my brother joined the Air Force right away\nand they were home. | mean they, they were home in the evening.",
        "Q: | guess I\u2019m just a little bit surprised that you went so far away from your family so\nsoon in America since you also expressed earlier today how much you determined\nto stay with your family.",
        "A: Yeah. Again was a, | think it was a real mistake that | did it. In retrospect |\nshouldn't have done it. But they thought it was a great opportunity for me and | did\nwhat was expected of me. It was just, in a way it was an adventure, going to Beverly\nHills, California. And again, | did, | did wnat | was supposed to do. | didn\u2019t question,\n| wasn't, | mean when | look at my own son and all his questioning and all his rebellion\nand all his, well not so much rebellion but certainly insistence on doing his own thing,\n|, that wasn\u2019t my style. | did what was asked of me and | did it. | didn\u2019t ask whether\nit was good for me, | just, they wanted one of us to come and so | was the oldest girl,\nAnita Frank 84\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 84\n| was the obvious one, obvious and by far the most mature one. Although | was so,\nnaive and innocent, | went.",
        "Q: But it was safe too, so.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: And again, all the good food.",
        "A: Oh that food, the ice cream.",
        "Q: You discovered Baskin Robbins?",
        "A: | don't think Baskin Robbins, Robbins had been discovered yet. No but they had\na freezer with ice cream. | couldn't believe anybody having ice cream at home.\nWe'd had no refrigerator in Holland. We had a little gas stove. | mean, goodness\ngracious, you come from little tiny Holland to this mansion with a butler and maid and\naye, aye, aye. Whataculture shock.",
        "Q: Opulence after so much deprivation.",
        "A: Oh unbelievable, absolutely. Mind-blowing, ridiculous, overwhelming.",
        "Q: Have you done very much reading and studying about the war and the Holocaust\nsince then to try and get more understanding?",
        "A: Yes, yeah, got lots of books. It\u2019s interesting, | find it harder and harder to do so.\nIt just, in my, | think my rage has intensified. That doesn\u2019t sound consistent with\nwhat I\u2019ve said because I\u2019m, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not guided by that rage, I\u2019m not controlled by\nthat rage. But when | read about it, it just, my incomprehension just increases. |\ncannot imagine, | cannot imagine this actually happening and the older | get | think\nyou sort of have, your child is grown, you've done, you've, you're sort of at a pretty\nAnita Frank 85\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 85\nstable level and you can think back on, on life and put it more in perspective and the\nmore | try to put it in perspective, the more incomprehensible it becomes. So | find\nmyself, |, | just find it harder and harder to, to read about it and to certainly to see, to\nsee the films. They\u2019re just unbearable. Instead of getting easier, gets, gets harder.",
        "Q: Oh, | can imagine that, | think that makes sense. | mean certainly a person\u2019s not\ngonna grow more tolerant of that.",
        "A: No, exact opposite [talkover].",
        "Q: Reinforces the horror and the anger.",
        "A: Yeah, incomprehensible. That people let this happen, that it did happen. And\nthat | Keep on thinking of the million and a half children who never had a chance.\nAnd what this world would have been like if they had been allowed to live because\nthe potential, the unbelievable potential of that population. And they just annihilated\nit. And all these millions were deprived of living and experiencing love and affection.\nAnd the other thing | think about is I, | cannot bear to think and this happened, this\nbecame stronger after, after Loren(ph) was born. It\u2019s just, | cannot imagine what it\nmust have been like for parents to see their children gassed. And |, | just, it, it\u2019s, or\nto live with the horrendous fear of what was gonna happen to them. It\u2019s beyond my\ncomprehension. | think about that a lot.",
        "Q: I, | think you're right. | think the world would have been a different place. We\nlost all kinds of gifted people.",
        "A: Allsorts. All sorts. In Europe, in the horror in some way, Hitler, Hitler succeeded\nyou see. He made Europe youdenrine(ph), free of Jews. That was his, his major\nAnita Frank 86\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 86\naim. And it\u2019s not totally free of Jews. | mean, Holland has about 35,000 Jews we\nthink out of a population of 16 million. They used to have ten percent about of its\npopulation was Jewish, not it\u2019s just a tiny percentage. French has, France has what,\nhalf a million Jews, | don\u2019t Know, probably not that much, what 50 thousand Jews, |\ndon't know. Germany has a few, Poland has practically none and Poland had three\nmillion before the war, so. | mean, they, they succeeded. They really succeeded.\nAnd | think the Europe is the poorer for it.",
        "Q: Well also if intolerance has grown enormously because of that, that\u2019s another\nrepercussions, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sure the repercussions and the ripples of what was lost in\nsome ways go on and on and on, if you keep thinking about that.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right. It doesn\u2019t end. It doesn\u2019t end.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s all hypothetical ...",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: Because you don\u2019t know what those other people would have contributed.",
        "A: But all that you can do is look at the survivors and what they have accomplished\nwhich is pretty, pretty impressive. | look at my own family and | look at my cousins\nand you look at the children and it\u2019s incredible who these children are. We know the\nchildren of the children who survived. It\u2019s just, they are incredible people and we're\njust a tiny percentage. | mean, they're real contributors to society.",
        "Q: How many survivors were there, do you know?",
        "A: Where?",
        "Q: In Europe, Jews?\nAnita Frank 87\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 87",
        "A: It depended on the country. Holland lost, | think, 80 percent of its Jews. France\nlost about, France and Germany didn't lose that many. In Germany, many of \u2018em\nemigrated, thank God. Russia lost, Poland lost three million. Poland lost almost 95\npercent of its Jews and that was a heavily, the heaviest population of Jews was in\neastern, really was in Europe and, and western Russia. And they lost | think that,\nfrom the west, probably like, well probably couple of hundred thousand. I\u2019ve got the\nnumbers actually, I\u2019ve got the, got a book with all the numbers of, but |, at least half\nthe Jewish population. Atleast half the population of European Jews was killed and\nthen a quarter, the rest emigrated. So what's left is just perhaps a quarter, if that\nmany.",
        "Q: Yeah, | have a, a wonderful book that, that | read too but I\u2019m not very good at\nremembering numbers and | just all of a sudden realized that I\u2019d, in some ways\nalways concentrated on the numbers of the victims and the lost people rather than\nthe ...",
        "A: Yeah. [talkover] | think they killed, they killed at least half. | think there were\nabout 11 million Jews. They killed 6 million of us. So perhaps 5 million survived.\nThey survived in Russia itself, in Moscow, Kiev, not Kiev, but Moscow, Leningrad.\nCause Leningrad lost over a hundred thousand people because of the, the blockade.\nMany of whom were Jews. But, but Russia must have lost, I\u2019m sure, over a million\nJews, at least. Then Lithuania, all those and \u2018course in those countries were just\nviolently anti-Semitic, Lithuanians, Latvians, Ukrainians, awful, just horrible. Awful.",
        "Q: Going back.\nAnita Frank 88\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 88",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Going back in time [talkover]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did you do when you were associate director of the Clearinghouse on Higher\nEducation?",
        "A: | started it. |, |, that, for nine months |, that was part of the Eric(ph) System, the\nclearinghouse system that the Office of Education started then, started one higher\neducation and I, | was the associate director. | had no director so | got the whole\nthing going. So that was really my major job there was to get the documents. What\nit does it gets the unpublished documents in education and puts them, and makes\nthem available through publications. And so what it meant, was that\u2019s how | met my\nhusband, actually. On one of those trips. | had to, | traveled to various universities\nand, who had lots of publications and got \u2018em all into the Eric(ph) System and\npublished the abstracts and the syllabi and stuff like that. Was fun. Great job, lots\nof travel, met my husband so what more and then I, and | only stayed there for nine\nday, for nine months because then |, | met Alan. | started it in September, | met Alan\nin October and got married the following May so I\u2019m afraid that | was a, my great job\nbut not a very long-lasting job. But | got a director just before | left so that was\nperfect. |, got the stuff, got the thing going and then was able to leave.",
        "Q: And did you meet him here in Albuquerque?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You came out here?\nAnita Frank 89\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 89",
        "A: On my one day trip to Albuquerque. The president of UNM, the University of New\nMexico was giving a dinner for our group and Alan had just come here as a new\npsychiatrist for the department and a, and he was invited to this party also because\nhe was a new faculty member and he had been widowed and we met at this party.\nIt was just amazing and we started to talk and | fully expected him to say oh gee, I\u2019ve\ngotta go see so and so. He didnt. | had no interest in meeting somebody else.\nSo we sort of talked and he wrote and eventually | wrote back and | visited him and |\nvisited him again and that was it. It was very quick. And | was, let's see, 1968, so\nalmost 28 years ago. Amazing, huh?",
        "Q: Really. And, and it sounds like the marriage has been really good for all of your\nfeeling ...",
        "A: Yeah, perfect.",
        "Q: and blossoming.",
        "A: Oh no, not a perfect marriage. But it\u2019s been, |, | don\u2019t think | would have done as\nwell with anybody else that, that Alan was just pretty much the ideal person in terms\nof letting me become the person, | think I\u2019m, |, | think that who | am today was exactly\nthe potential that | had as a two-year-old and, and it just has been allowed to blossom.\nAnd that may sound very, very self-serving but | like who | am today. | am very\ncontent with the person who | am and | like what I\u2019m doing and | like how | feel.\nYeah. And I\u2019m in control of my life and it\u2019s, it\u2019s a good feeling of being where you\nwanna be and being who you wanna be.\nAnita Frank 90\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 90",
        "Q: And it\u2019s a even greater accomplishment considering what happened during the\nHolocaust and afterwards, don't you think?",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah, because who | was after the Holocaust, after the war was the\nexact, in some ways the exact opposite of who | am today. | was scared, terrified,\nno self-esteem, just, just, just, just, just totally defined by the world outside of me and,\nand no sense of self at all.",
        "Q: And even Betty Booka(ph) is that her name?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Didn't she tell you that you had changed a lot, the first time she saw you after the\nwar?",
        "A: Yes. After the war, yes. Because those changes, you see during the war, it was,\nit was totally different but after the war, yeah, she told me after she came to, she\ncame to visit us in America as a matter of fact. She said she felt I'd changed a lot\nand was Clearly, she wasn't happy with my changes.",
        "Q: Too bad she couldn't see you now.",
        "A: Well, |, she saw me after we were married. | was pregnant with Loren(ph). We\nvisited, the last time | saw her | think was \u201972 and it was wonderful to see her then\nand | think she saw that, as a matter of fact she commented | was back to her old\nLeesha(ph).",
        "Q: Right, and, and, so she in some ways still called you Leesha(ph) which was your\nAnita Frank 91\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 91",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, was my hidden name, well the, my name in hiding. Yeah. Old\nLeesha(ph).",
        "Q: Just a couple more things. When you worked in child development and family\nrelations, what was your concentration or was there a sort of a something that\nespecially you [talkover]",
        "A: Yeah. Family relationships, marriage, child development, infant development. _ It\nwas, it was the developmental interactional part of, that I, that | focused on. So |\ntaught a lot of courses on marriage and personal development and on family\ninteraction and on child development and on, some on communication and infant\ngrowth and development. Oh, human growth seminars and human growth and\ndevelopment.",
        "Q: And was that, was your interest in that at all related to perhaps your own\nexperiences as a child, do you think?",
        "A: Well, again, I, | sort of, | think I\u2019m the kind of person who's easily interested in what\ngoes on around her and so after | married Alan and | was thinking now what am |\ngonna do with my life and my masters in Russian Studies didn\u2019t help me much here\nin Albuquerque, New Mexico. | decided well I\u2019m go back to school and basically |\ngot pregnant and went back to school at exactly the same time. And just started\ntaking child development courses and fell in love with those like I'd like fallen in love\nwith Russian foreign policy. | just found them fascinating and I\u2019ve never taken a\npsychology course at Washington University so, it was just a whole new world\nopening forme. So again, it just, | found something else that interested me. | think\nAnita Frank 92\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 92\nthat\u2019s how my life is. I\u2019m, I\u2019m easily interested in what\u2019s going on in the world so, |,\nI've lots of, | get excited about a whole bunch of things.",
        "Q: And you had obviously just starting your family [talkover]",
        "A: It was perfect.",
        "Q: A nice...",
        "A: It was perfect, absolutely perfect. | remember as Loren(ph) was growing up,\nkeeping track of whether he was on target or not. Thank heavens he tended to be\non target.",
        "Q: Did you let him know how he was doing as he went along? Did you say, when\nhe spoke his first word did you say good, Loren(ph), you\u2019re a month ahead of\nschedule?",
        "A: No, but it was very clear to me from the very beginning that he clearly was a very\nbright child so | was a very proud obnoxious mother, I\u2019m afraid. He, and |\nencouraged that enormously, interesting. That\u2019s certainly part of my heritage is that\n| didn\u2019t care if he was an athlete or not, at all. | couldn\u2019t have cared less. What! did\ncare about was his intellectual development. And if he had wanted to punish me all\nhe would have had to do is flunk out of school. Because for me, education has been\nthe absolutely essential ingredient for taking control of life and, and so when he was\ndeveloping into this incredibly delightful bright kid,\nEnd of Tape 3.\nAnita Frank 93\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 93\nTape 4",
        "Q: Could you just say that again about what he, he turned out to be as a child?",
        "A: [talkover] He turned out to be exactly the kind of child that | had hoped for. |\nmean, | don\u2019t think | could have designed a child more to my dreams than Loren(ph)\nactually turned out to be, so what a fortunate parent | am. | give him 95 percent of\nthe credit, I'll take about five.",
        "Q: How much does Alan get?",
        "A: Alan gets, well, he, he\u2019s included the 95. Alan gets five, | get five and Loren(ph)\ngets 90.",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s see. | think that might be, oh, |, just | think this is it but |, | wanted to\njust ask you to talk about something we talked about before we started the tape and\nthat was your, what you like about America being a self-examining society of sorts.\nWould you mind ending with that?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, | think that, that\u2019s really significant from my perspective and that is\nthat one of the great blessings from my perspective about this country is, is that we\u2019ve\nmade a lot of mistakes. You and | talked a little bit before we put the tape on, we\ntalked a little bit about America\u2019s role during the war and the fact that the State\nDepartment had lots of anti-Semites in it and, and that this country knew, the\ngovernment knew was happening to Jews and didn't do anything. That | think\nRoosevelt tried, there, absolutely no support for it, that the Jewish Underground\nbegged the British and Americans who bombed the rail lines and the concentration\ncamps and that, there were no bombs available or some excuses were given why\nAnita Frank 94\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 94\nthat couldn't be done. And how many lives could have been saved if, if some\nrelatively simple measures had been taken. And that then of course then America\ninvited all these Nazis, these Nazi scientists, Gunter(ph), what is it, Gunter von\nBraun(ph), that was the guy, to come to America and, and to work on the weapons\nprograms here. And we've hidden, | mean, we still, we\u2019re discovering Nazis left and\nright still. It\u2019s pretty late now. So | think this, and of course the, the horror of not\nletting the Jews and the, they, they, the ones who left Hamburg | think or Bramen(ph)\non the, the ship, St. Louis and they were refused entry here and had to go back to\nan, to Germany or taken to the gas chamber. So, this country has no, has not an\nunblemished record, far from it in many ways. And that is | think, true in Europe. |,\n|, | think there isn\u2019t, Denmark perhaps, Denmark really had a small number of Jews\nand they, the king as a leader, behaved nobly and its population followed. They, as\na country, get a lot of credit. And, and I, | expect the, | accept the fact that we all\nmake mistakes but what! cannot accept is that we don't acknowledge our mistakes.\n| think one of the great blessings of this country is, is we, we allow, we encourage\nourselves to examine our past and our policies and our history and we, there is a lot\nof self-criticism going on. And there is a lot of, we have a lot of controversy and we\nhave a lot of people who have courage to examine the past and to look at the past\nand to say this is where we went wrong or this is where we didnt behave\nappropriately. And one of the things that has been so missing in Europe has been\nthat honest self-examination. And, and you even know it, you go to the museum in\nParis, the war museum and the, the, the kind of sickening chauvinism of the French\nAnita Frank 95\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 95\nis just enough to, to appall anybody. And that is a, if you look at their museum, it\u2019s\nas if Charles de Gaulle(ph) won the war. There is absolutely nothing about French\ntreachery. There's nothing about French cooperation with the Nazis. There's\nnothing about the police\u2019s happy cooperation, rounding of the Jews and betraying\nJews, there is nothing of that in France. Only now are they coming to terms with it.\nIn Holland also, Holland is better. It's now beginning to examine its past but it\u2019s\ntaken them so long. For the longest time Holland had this, whenever | talked about\nHolland not having been so, such a glorious country during the war, people said\nsurprised, \u201cOh, | thought they were so noble.\u201d Cause Holland fostered that. We\nthe noble Dutch, we resisted the Nazis. Well they didn\u2019t. Some did. Butno whole\npopulation can take credit for the enormous courage of a few and, and so, to me, one\nof the great poisonous, and, and | must admit | think that\u2019s where western Germany\nhas, has done a relatively good job is they have a significant number of people who,\nwho are aware of how vital it's been to examine their past. But overall, it\u2019s taken\nthem a long time, too. And where in eastern Germany, this hasn't happened at all.\nAnd where you see these, these fascist movements rising. You see it in France,\nyou see it in Germany. It\u2019s, it's scary to me. And so, from my perspective that\u2019s\nsomething that we never must stop doing. We need to always reexamine our past.\nWe need to learn from history and we need to be critical of ourselves and we need\nto learn and | applaud this country that, that looks at itself and says, you know what,\nthat stank. That was no good. Many of us, it takes along while to change, but this\nis, this is a country that we had McCarthy, that fascist in the fifties, Joseph McCarthy.\nAnita Frank 96\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 96\nEventually, he was brought down. Eventually, we had people of courage who, who\nbrought him down even while this country was scared. And we need to make sure\nthat we never give rise to other fascists like him who will happily destroy whole people\nbecause of this irrational fear of, then it was Communism, infiltration of the Red\nMenace, and it\u2019s just, it's just dangerous. And so allowing dissent and allowing\ndisagreement and examining ourselves all the time, | think is what\u2019s gonna keep this\ncountry on a reasonably healthy path.",
        "Q: And at least acceptance that terrible persecution has occurred and recognizing\nthat that was a mistake.",
        "A: Oh, oh you mean in its own history. Oh sure, | mean slavery and the Japanese.\nYes, | mean terrible, terrible things have happened in this country. Without question.\nAnd, and but the critical, it wouldn't, that would be even worse if we didn't\nacknowledge our horrendous mistakes and try to make sure that those things don't\nhappen again. And that doesn't mean that we're not gonna continue to have misery\nand racism because I\u2019m not that optimistic about people to be very honest. I'm just\nnot. But | think that\u2019s where our government needs to take strong stands about\npeople's individual rights and privileges and responsibilities.",
        "Q: Does it scare you at all when you see some of the recent terrorist bombings of\nsay the Olympics and the airliner and so on that then civil liberties will be curbed to\ntry to protect the population at large? Are there any possible innocent victims?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s such a interesting question. To be honest, | see no infringement of\nmy rights if there\u2019re gonna be tracers in these fertilizer things. That, as far as I\u2019m\nAnita Frank 97\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 97\nconcerned, is only sensible. And to put taps on phones of suspected terrorists, that\ndoesn't, we can exaggerate those potential dangers. And that's something that\nreally bothers me. You can look at everything and, and make a huge case out of it\nand say what ff, if, if, yes and as a result you can immobilize people to do absolutely\nnothing. And so | think we need to be at all times careful that we, that we preserve\nour liberties but there\u2019s also something like the common good. And we must at all\ntimes weigh the common good against the protection of individual liberties. And |\ndon't think it\u2019s just a one-way street. I, | have a firm commitment to the common\ngood, also, and to my, in my opinion, and that\u2019s why with gun-control, | am so strongly\nfor gun-control. | just, just that, this society is so violent and you see it, you see these\n12 year old killing each other and killing others. It\u2019s just, it's insanity to, to scream\nabout, from my perspective, about everybody\u2019s right to, to bear guns versus the, the\ncommunity\u2019s rights to some, to a sense of safety. So again, a balance never, | see\nthat generally is the answer to most of life\u2019s problems is to find a balance that takes\ninto account both the common and individual rights.",
        "Q: And that will be continued forever, all those discussions of balance.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",

You told one or two stories but | wonder if there were\nsome other moments that you remember coming close to being caught by the Nazis.",
        "Q: And the Dutch, just before this interview when we were talking for a couple\nminutes, you mentioned that it was a small percentage of the Dutch who, who actually\ndidn\u2019t betray Jews. Can you talk a little bit more about, | mean, obviously that\u2019s how\nyou survived, right?",

        "Answer: Well the, the only ones that I\u2019m aware of were when they were going to\ninterview us on the, on the train, when they were, they found the teacher with the\nCommunist books and soon. That's the only time that I\u2019m aware of and I\u2019m not sure\n| mentioned then, I, |, as | said, I\u2019m not sure | remember this then but I, |, we just went\nback to Holland and for the first time we visited the house where we had been in\nhiding during the war in Biltoven(ph) and we had, had to move out of that house.\nAnd | can remember a couple of times, not in, when we were in that house but when\nwe moved to | think the third house that we lived in, in Bilthoven(ph), that several\ntimes we were told to leave the house because there was, was gonna be a raid on\nthe house and that we had to go into the back yard and go to neighbors and that we\nhad to stay away, until, in effect, we were told to come back. So, clearly, there was\na lot of suspicion that, that the family we stayed with, the Bookas(ph) were hiding\nchildren, but, and I'm not sure what they did with our clothes but there were other\nchildren there who were not Jewish so, that, they could easily have probably used\nour things to say those don't belong, those belong to the children who were clearly\nnot Jewish. So, anyway, so several times that we had to, to disappear, to avoid the\nraids and that is, that is something | remembered only later as we visited the third\nhouse, actually, we went past it this past April. But, but what I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve done\nAnita Frank 2\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 2\nsome reading since | did that interview about my parents. My parents have, we\nasked them to put their memories on videotape, on audiotape. And they, |, | didn't\nrealize how very often they came close to being taught, caught, that, that, at least\nfour or five times the police were after them because, because my grandfather lived\nwith them and, and his story was that he was from Switzerland but he didn\u2019t have his\npapers and other papers didn\u2019t come on time and then my father didn\u2019t have a job so\nany of those situations aroused the suspicion of the police. And at one point,\nactually, my mother, it was a guy named Pete, Pete who worked in Falkenburg\nwhere, where my parents were in hiding, came to visit them and, and, and\ninterrogated them. And my mother basically said to him, \u201cPete, do not ask any more\nquestions, because you don't want to know.\u201d And Pete, who was not a Nazi and\nnot a traitor, said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So, it, it was times like that or, another time when in effect\nthey were told that unless the papers came, were available they would be taken to,\nto police headquarters and they frantically tried to contact the man who had Mr.\nFrompinksteron(ph), who, who in effect had provided us with the false papers. And,\nand how my father, he couldn't telephone of course, from the town, he had to walk\nabout ten or fifteen kilometers to a, to a place to make telephone calls so he wouldn't\nbe traced. Situations like that, that |, we weren\u2019t aware of because we weren\u2019t with\nthem but it, they happened many a time because my parents also lived out in the\nopen like we did. That in a way they were continually exposed to danger and that's\nwhy they had the razor blades. They had their razor blades handy and miraculously\nwe encountered, we encountered, they encountered police that were not with the,\nAnita Frank 3\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 3\nwith the NS Bay,(ph) which was the Dutch Nazi Party. At least four, five times, so,\nit was tenuous. And, and the reasons they had the raids, they didn't want to betray\nus. They did not. They hoped that if they were caught, at least that we children\nwould be safe.",
        "A: Was because we were not betrayed. | need to stress, |, what, what my sense\nabout Holland during the war was based on, based on history, basically, data and in\nretrospect, is that there was a small percentage perhaps five, five percent, if that\nmany who actively tried to help Jews if, I\u2019m not sure there were that many, who were,\nwho risked their own lives. And they were truly the noble, the very noble people,\nbecause it\u2019s hard to ask people to do that for others. So, about five percent perhaps\nthat, I\u2019m not even sure it was, were that many, that actually, actively did something.\nMy feeling is that 80 percent didn\u2019t care. I\u2019m not saying that they would have\nbetrayed but also that they didn't care. But we had a significant, | would say fifty to\ntwenty percent who were traitors. A huge percentage that were part of the, they\nbelonged to the NS Bay(ph) which is the National Socialist Party, actively, who\nactively worked with the, with the Nazis, with the Germans and betrayed Jews.\nMost Dutch Jews probably were betrayed by Dutch rather than those were in hiding.\n| think they, they said something like 35,000 were in hiding, 15,000 were betrayed.\nAnita Frank 4\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 4\nThat\u2019s a significant number. Probably mostly by the Dutch. Dutch people who got\na few dollars for it, a few guilders which the Dutch thing. They got guilders so each\nperson had a, had a monetary value attached. And Holland only now is coming to\nterms with the fact that as a, as a people, they were not, they were not all that, | hate\nto say this, they were not all that different from the German people in that a lot of\nthem just turned their heads. Most just turned their heads, let it happen.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "A: Well, she was truly one of the extraordinary heroines, a remarkable woman who,\nbecause of her background, the Quaker background, she was British, one of the\nCadbury(ph) families. She couldn't tolerate what was happening. From the very\nbeginning, she couldn't tolerate this kind of injustice and absolutely, absolutely made\nit part of her, her life, her commitment to save as many as she could. And this was\nwho she was. This was her, her mission in life and that\u2019s what | gather, was true for\nmost of the rescuers. They saw something happening that was so intolerable to\nthem that, that they could not live with themselves and let this, let this happen to\nothers. And they, they, they basically did what they, they did what they did because\nthey couldn't do anything else. Those are the rescuers.",
        "A: Oh, she, tens | would say because, | didn't realize there were other Jewish children\nIn the house, course we didn't know that there were. But there were others, she hid\nAnita Frank 9)\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 5\nother Jews and helped others to hide others and there was a whole system the\nshe and her husband Case(ph) created. They, they. there was a\ngroup of Jewish children living close by that they took care of and tried to save. So\nthey, throughout the war, went out of their way to, to save, to save Jewish children.",
        "A: Oh yes, as a matter of fact, one of the terrifying stories was that, there was a, an\nact of sabotage. Some, some underground, members of the underground blew up\na, a train with Nazi munitions and they, they took Case Booka(ph), in to, to the prison\nand they said, \u201cunless those who had planned this act, this sabotage and who had\ndone it, that, that Case Booka(ph) would be shot. And one of the, one of the, one of\nthe perpetrators of this, of blowing up, who blew up the train was a young Jewish\nman. And he gave himself up. He did not want Case(ph) to be killed. And he was\nimmediately tortured and shot, this young man. And he was part of the, he was in\nthe Underground but he was Jewish, also.",
        "A: In 1943.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh yeah, they endangered themselves, the Bookas(ph) endangered,\nanybody who hid Jews endangered themselves. And the family, it was interesting\ncause | just spent, as | said, we were in Holland in April, just, just a few months ago\nand | spent quite a bit of time with the daughters, three of the daughters of the Booka\nfamily. And | asked them if they knew we were Jewish and you know what? They\nAnita Frank 6\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 6\nreally didn\u2019t. They, it wasn't discussed, it was never discussed. They just knew that\nthey, that they had to help hide people. But it was all, it was all hidden and it was\njust part of their, of their ethic that they would not cooperate and collaborate with the\nNazis and they would do what they could to help those in need.",
        "A: Right. Nottoimplicate. Right. And itwas Betty by the way, it was, in retrospect,\nit was Betty who insisted doing this, not Case(ph). | don\u2019t know, we're not even sure\nCase(ph) knew we were Jewish, because they took in other children. It was Betty\nwho did it.",
        "A: Extraordinary, a gentle, little, beautiful, sweetest face in the world, kind, caring,\nconcerned, loving, extraordinary woman who, who just, she couldn't do anything\ndifferent. And we stayed in close touch with her after the war and she came to visit\nus and whenever we went back to Holland, of course, we visited her until she died.\nAnd, and the interesting thing about her is, she was so concerned about others that\nin some way, she neglected her own children. She had eight children, they had\neight children themselves and, and that, you see that often in those who are truly\ncommitted to the well-being of others that, very often, there is some, you, you sort of\nassume your own children will manage. So | think, I, | think there\u2019s some bitterness\nthere now, among her children.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, they admired her, they loved her very much but | still have a real\nsense that they themselves did not probably, did not get what they needed because\nBetty was so concerned for, for others. You only have so much energy.",
        "A: No. No, because basically we were told never to tell anybody and so, we didn't\nexcept those little lapses. And | didn\u2019t even know that she knew we were Jewish. |\ncan remember, and that was, that was just the whole thing that | was so torn up\nabout. | mean, we were told never to tell anybody, so as far as we were concerned,\nwe were non-Jewish children living with these people and | had no idea who knew\nand who didn\u2019t know. So | couldn't tell anybody. So it was that, that horrendous\nfear of being discovered that stayed with me and the inability to talk to anybody about\nit, for two years. So all | Knew was that we had to be there because we'd be killed\nbut | did not know that Betty knew we were Jewish. It turned out she did but really,\nmost others didn't, in the family.",
        "A: No. Yeah, well no, that\u2019s not true, where, as a matter of fact yes we did, | did, just\nIn, in April. Eric, Eric State(ph) was there, the whole time we were there, my brother\nand | were there. Eric lived there and Eric has, he had a, | don't know, | think he had\na serious illness and so he\u2019s, he\u2019s, almost a form of autism and he\u2019s now, so we saw\nhim, | saw him for the first in 50 years. We visited him in his, in his apartment. In\nJulia,(ph), no it was Kondia Booka(ph) and | went to visit.\nAnita Frank 8\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 8",
        "A: Oh with my husband.",
        "A: No, no, my brother tragically just died. My, the, my brother with whom | was in\nhiding, Norman, just died April, May 28\", May 29\" of pancreatic cancer.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that was very sad and that was the terrifying thing of going to Europe\nand knowing, not knowing whether he would live. He didnt, he did live until we\nreturned and we were able to be with him but now he tragically died.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was my mother, my father admitted that he was in total despair at times and that\nwhen they were in hiding in Falkenburg, well in the first place, she saved my father\u2019s\nlife by taking the, | talked about that on the tape, taking the Cross of Merit to the, that\nher father had earned in World War | to the German commander of our town. And\nwho in effect excused my father from that transport where they took first, they first\ntook the men to, totally debilitate the families. And so she did that and then my father\nAnita Frank 9\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 9\nsaid many times that during the war, when in effect the, the police would come and\nwhen in effect they were told to produce papers that they couldn\u2019t produce, and when\nin effect these threats were made of transporting us, of, of interrogating us on the\ntrain because they notified my parents this might happen, that my father said she, he\nwould just be in despair and my mother just would support him and encourage him\nand say, \u201cNo, let's, lets go and see what we can do and lets contact\nFrompinksteron(ph) but be careful about it,\u201d and she just, she just, she just is the one\nwho, who persevered. She's the one who said to Pete, this policeman, \u201cPete, you\ndon't want to know these questions, don't ask us.\u201d | mean, she would come up, it\u2019s\nalmost like her intuition allowed her to do the right things at the right time.",
        "A: Exceedingly dangerous. It would have been the end of it again. |, had he been\nwith the Nazi, the NS Bay(ph), that would have been the end of the family. But she\ntook risks, somehow almost intuitively knowing what was to, at the same time, she\ndidn't want him to continue asking because she did not want him to know this\ninformation. So it was just amazing.",
        "A: He said things are fine, probably. Probably went back and said things are okay,\nand looked at the papers and things are okay. He covered up for them, whoever\nthis Pete was.\nAnita Frank 10\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 10",
        "A: But then after the war, my mother suffered horrendously. She never recovered.\nThen she had her nervous breakdowns and then she turned from really this, this very\npositive, | gathered from my cousin who still lives in Holland who adored, who lived\na year with my parents before the war, who, she just said my mother was the most\nloving and positive and, and, and affectionate woman. But after the war, she just,\nthat was all. | can't say it was all lost, she remained very caring but she became so\nbitter and so unhappy and so distraught, so desperate.",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "A: Well, he didn't, | think that was his first job. We came, we were liberated in, in\nSeptember, September 17\u00b0, \u201944, in Lindbergh,(ph), in Howtem(ph), we stayed and\nthen we moved to, we moved to a house where the, where the, traitor\u2019s house where\nhe was in prison and the woman was forced to take us in. Then in April of \u201940, \u201945,\njust before, just before the end of World War Il in, in Holland which was May, | think\nit was May five, May 5\", when Holland was liberated. In April we went to, back to\nand we lived in this bombed-out house and his first job there was with\nEnglish censorship so my mother was left alone with us. And then he came back\nfrom that and then he went back to the Ferda(ph) which was the, the clothing factory\nAnita Frank 11\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 11\nwith whom he\u2019d worked before the war so he went back to them and then, after that,\nhe left them and went to another clothing, worked for another clothing manufacturers,\nas a representative.",
        "A: A salesman, yeah. They called them factory representatives. He would go to\nstores and, and, and, yeah, sell their, their line of clothing.",
        "A: Yeah, it was very hard but he had some old customers who when they, who had,\nas a matter of fact one of his customers was very helpful to us during the war. They\nhid some of my parents\u2019 silver and they lived in Lindbergh(ph), northern\nLindbergh(ph), and Findlow(ph), and they were, they were very helpful to my parents.\nSo when my, my father again took that job, they, | think they bought from him. He\nwas a lousy salesman. He, he should never have been into sales. But it was his\nwhole family\u2019s business but my father was an intellectual and he should never have\nbeen a salesperson. He was, hated that, wasn\u2019t good at it, totally honest, totally\nethical, totally non-pushy, totally not the characteristics of somebody who\u2019s going to\nmake it big in sales, exact opposite. Oh, I\u2019m probably insulting salespeople now.",
        "A: Oh, we were continually on the edge. | mean, we came back with nothing. Our,\nmy, my mother, because she came from a very wealthy family had, had, we\u2019d lived\nAnita Frank 12\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 12\nin this house and my mother had all these gorgeous things which were all mostly\ntaken away, also by Dutch people who didn\u2019t return them to us after the war. \u201cAfter\nall,\u201d they said, \u201cyou gave them to us.\u201d And so, like my parents knew who had taken\nthe, the bedroom set, which was a gorgeous bedroom set, people absolutely refused\nto return these things to us. It\u2019s hard to believe that Dutch people, support\nfrom what they called the Commission or something like that so we got\na little bit of money but that was not until | think a year afterwards which allowed my\nparents to buy some furniture. We never got any reparation, we were never got a\npenny for what happened to us during the war. Not from the Nazis, not from the,\nnot from the Germans, we call them Nazis, not from the Germans, not from the Dutch\ngovernment, except a, a little bit that allowed my parents to buy some furniture. And,\nand the reason we survived the war was not because my parents had any money\nbut my, my aunt and uncle in, in Ossin(ph), my father\u2019s sister and her husband who\nhad been very close to my parents. They made money available to us and their two\ndaughters survived the war. One is the, and one tragically killed herself after the\nwar. Another, another consequence of the war. And, and, and, they in effect\nallowed my parents to survive because my parents did have to pay for us. Not\nmuch, but they paid the Bookas(ph), | saw the, | saw the records, they paid the\nBookas(ph) to have us stay there. And of course they had to live themselves. But\nthat was made possible because my aunt and uncle who tragically were taken out\nof, they were both very ill and taken out of the hospital and put in cattle cars and died\nbefore they got to, to Poland. And that, and so that money was gone by the end of\nAnita Frank 13\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 13\nthe war and it was, it was very rough financially, there was no money until my father\nsort of got back into selling some stuff and so we lived carefully. And, and then when\nhe got his new job, he did okay, he did, actually remember one year we actually made\nenough on commissions that we had a little bit of extra which allowed me to go to\nParis, in 1940. | was fifteen so that must have been 1951, before we came to\nAmerica. One of the soldiers who had been in the Liberation Army in Lindbergh(ph),\na wonderful young man, Jewish, and we had stayed in touch with him and he\u2019d gone\nback to America, married a journalist. And they wentto Paris. They, and they lived\nin Paris and invited one of us, and as the oldest girl | had privilege, to come and\nspend six weeks in Paris. And | remember, finally, my parents having little bit of\nextra money they could afford the train fare to, to Paris. It was a big adventure and\nit was the same summer they were able to rent a, a cabin on the beach. So |\nremember there was the one summer that we had a little bit of money. But for the\nrest, it was, It was minimal.",
        "A: Not before the war. It was good food. My mother was, she had some help and\nmy aunt, my mother\u2019s only sister, they had gotten her out of Germany in 1936 so she\nlived with us for awhile and my parents, and my mother\u2019s parents lived with us. So\n| think my mother\u2019s mother did much of the cooking until she died in 1938. But it\nwas the Dutch eat potatoes and the, the staples really were bread and potatoes and\na little bit of meat, porridge, food like that, vegetables. But meat was very\nAnita Frank 14\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 14\nexpensive. Eggs were very expensive so you didn't have much of that so it was\nmostly the carbohydrates. And then during the war, | remember very clearly getting\nminute portions of butter, it was margarine, just like perhaps two tablespoons of\nbutter, that, the margarine had to last us the whole week. So, |, |, what | remember\nwere the, the extreme small rations we had and how you had to just be so careful\nthat you just took a little bit and put that on your bread. And, and again, mostly what\nwe ate were bread, potatoes. That, that was most of our staples. It was, | think\nsevere vitamin | think we lacked, had severe vitamin deficiency. Not, probably not\nprotein, not, protein yes but not calorie deficiency but certainly vitamin deficiencies\nwhich manifested itself in me when | was in 1943, we went to visit our parents for\nChristmas. It was the first time we went to see them and we were hit by a sleigh.\nWe were watching people coming down the hill and we were hit by a sleigh and it\nmade a huge gash in my leg and it got horrendously infected and that infection lasts\nfrom Christmas to Easter. And | remember Betty taking me to the doctor every\nweek. | just had sores all over my legs and | just didn't heal. And | think that had\nto do with, just deficiencies, vitamin deficiencies, more susceptible to illness. And\nthen after the war, there were severe shortages again so really the whole time that |\nwas in Holland until 52, things were rationed. | can remember seeing my first\norange, getting it from the Americans, as first orange. Seeing my first pineapple in\n1949 or so, in a store which was just sort of put there prominently and | not knowing\nwhat a pineapple was, so very simple foods after the war when, after things became,\nHolland was in horrendous shape because of the war. And it took a long time and\nAnita Frank 15\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 15\nthat\u2019s where the Marshall Plan was so incredibly helpful. It took a long time for the\neconomies of Europe to begin to recover from the horrors. And | can remember, we\nwould have meat once a week. And we'd have one chicken which we'd divide and\nwe'd get just a little piece and we'd have an egg if we were lucky once a week. We\nwould have cheese though, cheese and jams, those things were our favorite.",
        "A: Hadn't thought about that. Yeah. You live with shortages and then all of a\nsudden this, [talkover] unending supply of food. Yeah, it became my, my salvation.\nSome salvation. But that, that\u2019s, that\u2019s very possible, yes. This, like, eat it now\nbecause it may disappear. Hadn't thought about that to be honest. | just, | knew it\nbecame a crutch for me and it was my antidepressant but it became like food was\nsomething | could fill my empty soul with.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: | don\u2019t remember about the dreams and nightmares. What | do remember were\nfeelings of | will never leave my parents, meaning | couldn't imagine that | would ever\nmarry and want to leave my parents, that they represented my safety, my base, my\nAnita Frank 16\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 16\nsolidity, my comfort. And that | had a very strong sense that, that, that they, that\nthey represented all that was good for me. And, and | think that had to do with not\nhaving had them during the war, not being with them. | remember being, of course,\nhorrendously ashamed and I\u2019ve talked about that, | think. [End of side 1 of tape 1].\nOkay, so these, these, the feelings and that, that, so that involved fear and also it\nwas because during the war, I, | had this real sense that | had to be perfect, that |\ncouldn't make any mistakes, that | couldn't do anything wrong, | mean that was, as\nlong as | just stayed perfect, that wouldn't, | wouldn't be killed. | mean, | wouldn't\nbetray myself, or even more so, as long as | stayed perfect, nobody would betray me\nto the Germans, nobody would think | was a bad person and, and betray me to the\nGermans. And that sense of having to be this perfect child became part of who |,\nwho I, | was after the war. And it meant that | couldn't assert myself. | was afraid\nof, | was afraid of asserting myself. And | remember having a feeling of, crazy, that\n| saw other children doing, doing bad, quote, bad things, not terribly bad but being\ndisobedient or being rude and | can remember thinking, and | was about 11 years\nold. | can remember thinking, why can't | be like that? Why can't | be a little bit\nbad? So, so, clearly, there was, there remained an overriding fear in me that | had\nto be, | had to be good, | had to be perfect, otherwise something bad was going to\nhappen to me. But there was also something in me already that said why can't | be\nlike other children? And, and that, that need to please others, that need not to\ndisagree with others stayed with me. And then, | remember one occasion. We\nwere playing ball on the street. Tennis balls, we had tennis balls. And a woman\nAnita Frank 17\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 17\nwas riding her bicycle and she, she hit one of the balls and she fell and she was\npregnant. And she, she ripped her stockings. And | can remember, she came and\nshe was really angry at us and | can remember saying to her, \u201cWell, you should have\nlooked out,\u201d or something like that. | was being rude and it was like, it was almost\nlike something in me said, now is your opportunity to be rude and it was most\ninappropriate really. | mean | chose the wrong person and then, but she came into\nourhouse. My mother was very felt, was very apologetic and paid for new stockings\nand stuff like that. And thank heavens the baby wasn't harmed. But, but | can\nremember that was my one moment of rudeness. But the way, the way this came\nout was, and | mentioned that, was that | became immobilized in school. | stopped\nlearning. It was just like something in me got just so blocked is, the ability to be who\n| really was. And I\u2019m not saying I'm a a bad person or | wanted to be rude, but |,\nthis, this sort of need to, to, to speak up for what you think or what you want didn\u2019t\nhave, I, | just couldn't do that so that sort of came out then in school where | just\nbecame emotionally, just horrendously blocked. | couldn't, couldn't study, couldn't\nwork and there, not being this perfect person, not being this top student which |\nalways have been, I, I, that was just something | had no control over, | felt, so, I, | felt\nvery bad about it because | knew | disappointed my father because he had such high\nexpectations of me. But atleast | felt | had no control over that.",

        "A: No, I\u2019m sadly enough not. She, we had a, so we were great friends until | married\nmy husband and then she went through a very difficult time. She got divorced and\nI'm afraid that, of, | went to go and visit her one day and, well, | don\u2019t particularly want\nto tell the story. But very unfortunate things where she got furious with me for not\nhaving notified her. | did, | wrote, | called her, | wrote her. She said to me come\nanytime you want to. | took her at her word. | sent her a card from, from New\nHampshire where we were then, saying we'll be there on that day, and we got to the\nhouse and she had tickets to the ballet or something. And wrote me this furious\nletter about how inconsiderate | was and thoughtless | was. And |, I\u2019m afraid that\nthis, she, because of her own miseries, she projected a whole bunch of her anger of\nme and | had been sort of the good little girl. | mean, | was the one who just adored\nher and admired her and, and just thought a world of her and then when | married,\n| became this independent woman and no longer this adoring creature who needed\nher as much. And | think that type of role, | mean, | may be analyzing it too much.\nBut it was very tragic, this soon after a marry, this, after | was married, | just, our\nrelationship changed. And it ended, sadly enough.\nAnita Frank 19\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 19",
        "A: It, what was key was that after, after coming to America and having my ego totally\ndestroyed, | feel, no, that\u2019s nonsense. Having my ego severely damaged even\nfurther by Henry Coster(ph) who, |, | think | told that story where, basically he, when\n|, when | was promised | could go to the opening of the rope(ph) and then was told\nto stay home with Peter because he was sick and, |, | dared, here, for the first time, |\ndared complain. | dared express some of my needs and that was literally the first\ntime I\u2019d done that. Since, since the war because | had been so careful, | have no\nneeds. | just, | just managed, | just coped. | had noneeds. So there, |, first time\nthat | remember basically going to Peggy Coster(ph) and saying, \u201cI\u2019m really sad, |\nreally, | really had been looking forward to this and I\u2019m really unhappy.\u201d And then\nPeggy telling Henry Coster(ph) that | had complained and Henry Coster(ph) calling\nme in and telling me | had no right to do that. That devastated me. That absolutely\nconfirmed the fact that | had no right. | had no right to complain. | had no right to\nexpress my feelings or express my needs and it, that stayed with me for years and\nyears and years and make me feel | had no value. Until | went to the Soviet Union\nand with, and Elizabeth Dixon(ph) was there on the second exhibit, no it was the first\nexhibit, and where in effect she seemed to really like me. And she was lonely there\nand she was a real friend to me and I, she provided me with a home and | remember\nvery distinctly thinking she is a person of value. She values me so there must be\nsome value to me. |, | absolutely went through those thought processes. And then\nthat, that was enormous boost to me, that she\u2019d really cared about me, the first\nperson in this country to really do so. And that was a long time after I'd been here,\nAnita Frank 20\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 20\nthat was in 1962. That was ten years, ten years after I\u2019d come to this country, that,\nthat\u2019s, that\u2019s when | really began to feel there had to be something worthwhile in me.",
        "A: Well, again, I\u2019m intensely grateful to him because he was our sponsor and he\nmade it possible for us to come to this country. And coming to this country,\nnotwithstanding the miserable first ten years, was liberation, was, was our, was for\nme true liberation. Because eventually allowed me to come, become the person\nwho lam today. Tragically, he, so there I\u2019m very grateful to him. But tragically, he\nwas, he\u2019s part of this Hollywood garbage dump. And, and what a fake life those\npeople lead. Nothing is real, nothing is authentic. I\u2019m exaggerating as usual. But\nvery little is authentic and, and, even, naive and innocent as | was when | came to\nCalifornia, living in this fake environment, even | knew that these people weren't real.\nEven | knew that these expressions of interest meant nothing. And so he, he did\nnot, and I\u2019m not blaming him, but he clearly and neither did Peggy, | think, Peggy is\na, was a sweet, she was always very sweet, | need to stress that. But, but Henry\nruled the roost. And | don\u2019t think he had any sense of what was going on with me at\nall. And! don\u2019t know whether | can blame him for that or not. | don\u2019t blame because\n| don't hold him, he did what he knew how. But you know, you live, you grow up in\nthat world of fakery and you grow up in that, you live in that world where all these\npeople play pretend and so little is real and people don't even know what is real and\nwhat is not real. And | gather there now, there\u2019s a group now, stars that may have\na somewhat stronger grip on reality. But in those days, it was just about as fake as\nAnita Frank 21\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 21\nyou could imagine. Yeah, | don't think he knew any better, so, |, | prefer to look at\nhim and say thank you for bringing us to America. |, | like not, | don\u2019t, | don\u2019t focus\non the bad.",
        "A: No. Never. That\u2019s, that\u2019s what | mean. We lived, it was like secrets. It was\nlike, it was like, that was, | think, the horror of, of the war years. It wasn't just the war\nyears, it was afterwards when quote, nothing had happened. It was as if we had to,\nwe had to continue our whole lifestyle as if nothing had happened. As if we had just\nhad this normal kind of life. And so that\u2019s what we believed, that we just had to go\non as if nothing had happened to us. And so we couldn't ever get in touch with the\nhorrors of the war and we couldn't even, we, we couldn't even, sort of begin to think\nabout it and say hey, how did this impact us? Because it was never talked about, it\nwas never discussed. In contrary, on the contrary, we just had to go on and we had\nto be good, good kids and we hadnt, shouldn't cause anybody any problems.",
        "A: Well, yes, as a matter of fact, Peter the younger son, Nicky, Nicky tragically died.\nHe was a psychiatrist and died of, under very unfortunate circumstances. And Peter\nand his mother Peggy were here a year and a half ago, almost two years ago. They,\nthey came to visit for the first time, the first time I'd seen Peter.

And that yeah, that, this little fat girl that stayed with\nthem for year and a half had sort of turned into rather competent human being and,\n| think they were. But you know what, | could not talk to them about my real\nexperiences there. | could, | did not feel that | could say to them, do you know what\nhappened to me? And so it, it remained superficial.

        "A: Yes. And | didn't, | didn\u2019t, | didn\u2019t want to bring this up now. Peter, of course,\nhad nothing to do with it. | always adored Peter so Peter was just six, bless his little\nheart and he was a marvelous child. So it was, it was with Peggy, and | just didn't\nwant to do that because | don't think she would have understood. | don't think she\nwould have understood.

        "A: No. Really, all | know is that they had my, they had a friend called, a woman\nnamed Tanta Onna Headsfeld(ph), | think her name was. And they met through her\nand she was my mother's sister\u2019s mother-in-law. \u2018Kay, so, my mother\u2019s, my mother\nhad a sister, Tanta Powla(ph), it was her husband\u2019s mother who was the one who\nbrought my father and Henry Coster(ph) together. And all | know was that was in\nthe twenties and my father was traveling in Germany and the Dutch economy\u2019s doing\nwell, reasonably well, that the German economy was disastrous and my father\nhelped Henry Coster(ph). And they were pretty good friends but again, it was really\nsad because after, when we came to America and when my parents moved to\nCalifornia in 1958, we, in 52 we went to St. Louis and \u201958 they moved to California.\nHenry, really, had nothing to do, they, they really, perhaps saw my parents once\nevery two years.

        "A: That's, I've thought about that a lot. Again, they never had an opportunity to talk\nabout anything so they, like the rest of us, they just did what was expected of them.\nAnd they came to America for us and so my father, my mother who had never worked\noutside the house, took these job, first job was in a handbag, handbag factory. My\nfather worked in a paint factory, got horrendous paint, lead poisoning there,\npractically died. They never did anything for him there. They had, cheap(ph) job\nas custodians, | mean, they had these, my mother worked as a nurse's aide ina\nhospital. Horrible jobs. Horrible jobs. Never complained. Never complained.\nNever even regretted having left Holland because even though that, it must have\nbeen just so hard for them to totally shift focus. They did it. They were totally\nremarkable and, and what, they did it for us. And they, | think all of us, perhaps all\nof us felt a strong obligation to our parents. That was never ever lost throughout that\nlifetime that, that we, we also made sure that when we became adults and we were\ncapable, we took care of them. So they never, | bought \u2018em a house in Washington,\nafter they, my father retired from the motel. | lived in Washington. They came to\nWashington. My sister and | bought \u2018em a house and then | supported \u2018em in the\nhouse. And they lived in that house in, in Rockville, Maryland. Nice little house for\nabout, until from 1965 until 1971, | think. And then my sister came with her husband.\nThey, she had been in the Air Force in Thailand, and then they moved my parents,\nlock, stock and barrel to, to Florida. And then they lived with my sister there for 20\nAnita Frank 25\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 25\nyears. And then after my father died, my mother came and lived with my other sister\nin Baltimore and her last eight months, she lived with me. That we, | just could not\ntolerate sending, she was, she had mild dementia, she'd broken hips and she was\ncrippled and |, we could never have put her ina home. I, 1, and she died.

        "A: My mother never recovered. As a matter of fact, one of the great horrors to, to\nthink about how, how you can never forget, is because you never forget, is that as\nshe became, as she became more demented, | hate that word, as she began to lose\nher memory more, the past started coming back and she became terrified that the,\nthat the Gestapo was around. When she was my sister she said, \u201cWho are these\npeople outside? Are they, is that the Gestapo? Close the windows, don\u2019t let \u2018em see\nus.\u201d When, when she was me, | start crying every time | think about that, is that she,\nat one point, she was sitting at the table and she said, \u201cAnita,\u201d she said, \u201cDid my sister\ndie a natural death?\u201d | know, her sister died in Auschwitz. And | said yes she did.\n| mean,! wasn't about to say to her, no she died in Auschwitz.

And then\nshe would sit in the chair and she'd say, \u201c| want to go home.\u201d And | said, \u201cWhere do\nyou want to go?\u201d And she was thinking, she want to go home to her parents.\nThat's, that\u2019s, and | said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid, I\u2019m afraid that your parents aren't here anymore.\u201d\nAnd she'd say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, they're dead.\u201d But she wanted, she wanted\nsomething, | know, | Know what she, she wanted to go back to a place where she\nwas safe. And really after the war | don\u2019t think there was anymore safe place for\nher.",
        "A: Through too much. And again, no recognition, no, no acknowledgment after the\nwar about what had happened to Jews. Basically, the message in Holland was to\nJews, is come on, why don\u2019t you just forget it, just, just, like this woman | heard on\ntelevision, why don\u2019t you just go forget it, go on with your life? And this deliberate\neffort to, to pretend that what had happened to the Jews was not different from what\nhappened to other Dutch people. And you got that from the Dutch. Well, we have\nsuffered too. Well, they had no concept of the difference between their suffering.\nWell, my brother had to hide, yes, my brother had to hide. They had no concept of\nthe difference between quote their suffering. And I\u2019m not saying the Dutch didn't\nsuffer. But I\u2019m also saying that there was no recognition of the difference between\nwhat happened to us and what happened to the rest of the Dutch who were not\nsingled out, who suffered as a people, but we were singled out because of who we\nwere.\nAnita Frank 28\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 28",
        "A: Yeah. Well, again, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, | even heard this from a friend of mine, \u201cWhy don\u2019t\nyou just forget it?\u201d It\u2019s, it\u2019s the kind of thing even though | personally feel that | have\ndone extraordinarily well because I\u2019ve dealt with it for so many years now. I've, I\u2019ve\nbeen able to come to terms with happened and recognize how present behaviors are\nrelated to the past and made every effort not to allow the past to control my, my\npresent behavior. But the, the reality is, is that those of us who went through it will\nnever forget. And so to listen to people telling me that we should just forget it, |, |\nwant to shoot \u2018em. And one of the most striking memories is when the Berlin Wall\ncame down, PBS had a program in which they talked about how wonderful it was to\nhave the wall come down but recognizing that, that some of the Jew survivors, the\nHolocaust survivors weren't so happy about the wall coming down, that in effect, that,\nthat there had been several expressions of deep concern about a united Germany\nand what that meant. Basically, what it meant to Europe. And, and the interviewer\nwent to an ethnic restaurant, a German ethnic, in Chicago | think it was and talked to\nthis woman and said, well they were celebrating, they were celebrating the wall\ncoming down. And this interviewer saying to this woman, \u201cWell, what do you think?\nThere are some people who are deeply concerned about this wall coming down,\nabout, in terms of what it means for a united Germany?\u201d And her response was, \u201cAhh,\nwhy can't they just forget it?\u201d | wanted to kill her. I, I, not that | never would,\nbecause | can\u2019t but that\u2019s, that was my thought. You miserable witch. If |, if | had\nAnita Frank 29\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 29\nbeen there, I, | don\u2019t know what | would have done to her because how can we forget?\nYeah, we survived but our families didn\u2019t, our relatives didn\u2019t. We had, we came to\nAmerica and fortunately | have three cousins who survived. Two who live in\nCalifornia with their families and one who still lives in Holland and that\u2019s it. And, we\nhad to start from scratch. | went to a wonderful wedding yesterday with Jewish\nfamily, dear wonderful, wonderful friends and they were blessed. Hundreds, they\nhad a hundred of their relatives there and their families had left Europe, thank God,\nin the, in the early 1900\u2019s, came to America. Even though they\u2019d lost distant\nrelatives, they were able to come with their families and build and have this wonderful\nextended family and how | envy them because they have got, they\u2019ve got the cousins\nand the aunts and the uncles. We don\u2019t. We had to start from scratch. We're\nstarting with our little family and | must say, we lost more than most. We lost most,\nmy father had seven brothers and sisters and only he and the older brother survived\nwith some cousins. My mother had just one sister and her daughter and they were\nmurdered so, that, that leaves very little family. And so you come here and you start\nfrom scratch. you start from scratch without your, but you also, you have\nthe memories, you don't, you don\u2019t forget that. You live with that. |, there, rarely a\nday | don\u2019t think about my, my aunt or my cousins who were murdered. _| just, that\u2019s\nnot something you forget and every thing that reminds you of them makes, and those\npeople who were killed in the concentration camps, those are not strangers, that\u2019s\nfamily.

        "A: Well, you asked, you asked why, how, how was Hitler possible and, and | just, as\n| said we had answers to that, we'd know better. But! mean |, when | put in context\nis, is we have had two years, two thousand years, perhaps that's a little bit, no, really\ntwo thousand of unmitigated anti-Semitism in, in, in Europe, perhaps 1500. But,\ncertainly, the Crusades, the, the Inquisition in Spain, | mean, blaming Jews for the\nplague. | mean it, all you have to do is go through European history and if you look\nat the Bible, this increasing anti-Semitism, this, this hatred of Jews. You see that\ndeveloping in the Bible, it wasn't, that was not the original, the original disciples were\nnot, they were Jews themselves. But you see, as, as Rome became Christian, they\nof course had to, to blame Jesus\u2019 death, not on the, the, the, the Romans but they\nhad to blame it on the Jews. And you see this shift, this shift in the Bible itself to an\nincreasingly more anti-Semitic perspective about Jews as Christ killers. And that\nbecame the great montra(ph) in, in European Christianity. Both Catholicism,\nLutheranism is Jews the Christ killers, Jews the blood-suckers, the Jews the\nDamned, Jews are not gonna go to heaven, it\u2019s only the select Christians who\nsomehow have got the one right answer who are gonna go, who are gonna go to\nheaven. And so you have the dominant religion which of course Christianity is, in,\nin Europe. You've got the dominant religion saying of another group of people that\nthey're damned and they're gonna go to hell and they're, they suck the blood of\nChristian children. It becomes, they become the, the Jews, the dirty Jews, the ones,\nthe dangerous people and then of course with the, with the Christians curtailing the\nAnita Frank 33\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 33\nJewish, the Jewish, the possibility for Jews, jobs, professions and so on, were in a,\nin effect, Jews can only be, they could lend money because it was dirty for Christians\nto lend money. So they could do the dirty jobs. And then Jews become successful\nthere, they're being killed because they did. They became the money lenders and\nyou have Shakespeare and Merchant of Venice and Charlotan(ph), that perpetrating\nthose horrors. And, and so you've got a whole culture of anti-Semitism which was,\nyou have it in France with the Dryfuss(ph) Affair, | mean you have it all through\nEurope. In, in eastern Europe with the progroms, you have it all through Europe\nthroughout with intermittent periods where in effect certain rulers(ph) who'd be\ntolerant of the Jews because they could use them. So it wasn\u2019t unmitigated, | mean\nit wasn't totally consistent but it certainly was consistent over time with periods of, of,\nof some, of some allowance to, to let Jews live their lives and flourish. And | must\nsay that\u2019s where Holland has had us, on the whole, a, a better history, not perfect but\ncertainly a better history of tolerance for Jews because they did allow the Sofottic(ph)\nJews with the Inquisition to come to Holland and Holland has had a relatively,\nextraodinarily wonderful history of, of religious freedom. And has allowed its Jews\nto live in relative peace. But in Germany, Germany with all of its, its effort that\nbecoming a nation-state which it didn\u2019t become until Bismarck with all of its in-fighting\nand then, and, and a population which is the same as in Holland, this, this, a\npopulation that has as its dogma the Christian belief that if you just, the Calvinistic\nbelief if, if you just do everything right and you follow God's word and you do it, then\ngood things are gonna come to you. And that basically, you obey. It\u2019s very\nAnita Frank 34\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 34\nimportant to do what you're told, not to question this sort of authoritarian, sort of ethic\nof, of, of children must listen to their parents, children must obey, children must not\nquestion. Father knows best. So you've got this, this sort of a cultural pattern of\nnot questioning what goes on, a religious pattern of, if something bad happens to\npeople, they deserve it. And then a historical pattern of extreme anti-Semitism, then\nyou ve got this great combination that when things go bad, as of course Hitler came\nto power after this horrendous inflation, well, first the defeat for Germany in World\nWar | which was a horrendous blow to their morale and then, this, this terrible inflation\nthat impoverished millions of people. What you do is you find a scapegoat. And\nHitler, Hitler was always a rabid anti-Semite. But people become very vulnerable to,\nbecoming comfortable to, yes, it\u2019s all the Jews\u2019 fault. Blame somebody else, | mean\nwe do it in this country all the time, is blaming somebody else. Blame the\nimmigrants. Blame, blame the illegal aliens. Blame everybody. Even blame\noutside terrorists when we're breeding our own terrorists. We have the militia who\nIs SO dangerous here. So you blame, you start blaming others. And then\neverybody else is doing it and it becomes really comfortable and then you obey\norders and you don't question and you become self-satisfied and smug because\nthings are getting better. It\u2019s not, not difficult then to understand the Jews, the\ntraditional scapegoat in Europe became an obvious scapegoat here. And then with\nGerman propaganda, they did an unbelievable job of painting Jews as rats. As\nvermin. Destroying the fiber of the great Aryan nation. And that propaganda is, is\nstaggering, you see some of those propaganda films. So you put all that together, it\u2019s\nAnita Frank 35\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 35\nnot surprising. It\u2019s not difficult to make people hate others. And that\u2019s why for me,\nquestioning, always questioning, never accepting what people tell you without really\nexamining the validity of any of it and never allowing others to dictate your moral\nstands. It\u2019s just so vital.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. But that didn\u2019t seem to bother most people in Germany. That was exactly\nright because Jews were given a chance. It\u2019s been just remarkable. Jews, | don't\nknow how they manage. But they have, they're like that little ball that you put down\nit comes on up, Jews have always been like that little ball. They just, they just\nsomehow cope. And so indeed, in the early 19, in the early 1900s, there had been\na period of, of freedom for Jews and Jews had done extraordinarily well in Germany\nand they were the heart and soul of the cultural scene in Berlin. | mean that was the\ngreat and others, great artists, great painters were Jews and,\nand merchants and, yes.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely the intellectuals, | mean, my goodness. They came to America,\nAlbert Einstein and many of the great physicists who fled.

My grandfather had some stores, was a very wealthy man and a very\nAnita Frank 36\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 36\nprominent man in his little town which before the war was Germany. After World\nWar | became part of Poland. Zupolni(ph), it was Simpleburg(ph) then and he had\ngiven hundreds of thousands of marks for the German war effort. That's how come\nhe got his, his cross, he got his Cross of Merit which saved my, my father\u2019s life, but\nmy grandfather, yes, he was a German. And yeah, right. And so, yes, you're\nabsolutely right. And it's amazing how easy it is to turn that around and so your\nneighbors whom you, whom you loved before are now become your enemies. You\nsee it in Bosnia, you saw it in Sarajevo, you saw it in Mostar(ph), where Muslims and\nCroats who'd lived and served, who'd lived together as friends, all of a sudden start\nbetraying and even murdering each other.

So you cant,\u201d they said, their words were, \u201cthe theologians who really\nexamine the Bible carefully, they just, they just go too far.\u201d So there is a limit to what\nyou, you can read the Bible but don't read the Bible too far and | gather in Catholicism\nthis has been the thing.

She survived because she escaped the Dutch concentration\ncamp and she was there with her little sister. And, oh gosh, you think about this.\nShe was there with little sister, she was there when her parents were taken to the\nconcentration camps, taken out of the hospital, taken to Westerbork, and put on the\ntrain to Auschwitz and she begged them to please leave her little sister, was exactly\nmy age, little, few months older, Lainie(ph) was her name. She begged them to\nAnita Frank 46\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 46\nplease... [End of side 1 of tape 2]... begged her, she, she was, she was,\nshe was at Westerbork, the Dutch concentration camp, she was there when her\nparents then came.

Her parents insisted Lainie(ph) would go\nwith them. To Auschwitz. That's what she has to live with. This hard. When we\nwere just in Holland right now, we went to the, May 4\" is Memorial Day and so we\nwent to the Jewish Cemetery in Ossin(ph), which is, most of my father\u2019s family was\nall from northern Holland, from Ossin(ph), Emmen,(ph), Hoanigan(ph), that area,\nand there was, we went to the Jewish, Jewish Cemetery in Holland which\nmiraculously was not destroyed by the Nazis.

Yeah, my,\nthey, they were my father\u2019s oldest brother who survived, he\u2019s the only one who\nsurvived, children. He had three children. Their son, Bertus(ph), was | gather, just\na wonderful young man. He was among the first one killed because he was on the\ntrain and made some anti-Nazi remark. When they found out he was a Jew, they\nwere shot immediately. He had two daughters who all, they survived in hiding.\nHetty(ph), the oldest, who just turned 80 as a matter, no, is turning 80 in August 16\",\nshe, she married and, and, she married in 1940, | think just before the war broke out.\nNo, just after the war had broken out. She married July 4\" to a very nice guy and\nthen she had a baby in 1942 and that baby was put in, in with hundreds of other, |\ndon\u2019t know how many hundred, shuffled from one family to the next, her name is\nBetty, after her brother. And then there was Sarai(ph), who was 12 and they, they\nalso, they survived on hidings like we did except | think they were, they were not out\nin the open the way we were. And so they, after the war, we came to America in\n1952, Hetty(ph) and Herman(ph) came in 1953. And we left Holland because\nHolland just, just was not a good place to be in those days. And they, they came to\nCalifornia and did extraordinarily well. Her, she had then three children when the\ncame and those three young ladies all married and have children and have sort of\nlived the American dreams. However, however, as far as I\u2019m concerned, there is\nhorrendous damage in all of them because of the war.

        "A: | have to be very careful because what\u2019s interesting is that Hetty(ph) and\nHerman(ph) who | adore, just absolutely wonderful people, they did exactly what the\nrest of us did, is that forget it, forget it. Try to forget it, go on with your life. Don't\ntalk about it, don\u2019t deal with it but for heaven\u2019s sakes, and | think that has been a\nhallmark for at least our family, is prove that the Germans, that the Nazis were wrong,\nprove that you're okay. Prove that you're a person of value. And so how do you\nprove that? By accomplishing things. And by golly, did they accomplish. But in that\neffort to accomplish, they, the children, except for the youngest, the two older girls\nhad to fend for, had to fend for themselves a great deal and were to some extent\nneglected. And not because they wanted to do that but because they, they had,\nthey felt they had to work so hard to, to make it in this country. And they did make\nin this country. And then all of that tension and all of the pain was never discussed\nso it, it affected their lives and these girls grew up knowing about their background\npartly but not dealing with it. Not, it, without it being discussed. And so they\nbecome adults and they, they have to deal with it in, in their own way, and, and, again\n| don't wanna talk about their circumstances because that\u2019s not up to me to do so.\nBut | Know, because of my background, that tremendous harm was done and that,\nthere was enormous pain and my, the oldest one, Betty, who is, who, who was born\nduring the war, | mean she knows it, she\u2019s done a lot of talking about it and, and she\nis aware of, of, she\u2019s aware of the horrendous pain. And she also\u2019s been trying, try\nAnita Frank 49\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 49\nto do her best and yet has not really actualized herself the way I, phenomenal\npotential, highly intelligent young woman. They all are very bright, very competent.\nBut unlike my family, where my parents never were successful, though they spent,\nso they spent a lot of time with us, we, we have, | think, my sisters, we have all really\ntruly actualized ourselves, intellectually, emotionally. | don\u2019t, except for the\nyoungest, who came along young enough that | think her parents had more time for\nher, the other two just haven't. And | think it\u2019s causing, it\u2019s caused a lot of pain. And\nthen the war years, again, the, the lack of open discussions, up until lately, up until\njust the last couple of years, means that there\u2019s all this stuff in your background and\nyou, you know something went wrong but you don't, you don't discuss it. You\npretend everything is just perfect and wonderful and they're prototype of that.\nEverything is perfect and wonderful always.

        "A: Yeah. I\u2019ve been by far the most verbal, by far. That's because | have the best\nmemory, too. They, Ingrid is two years, one year younger and Helga\u2019s two years\nyounger. So, | was six when the war broke out, Ingrid\u2019s five and Helga was four\nand | have much better memories than, than they do. | also, | also developed myself\nintellectually, I\u2019m the, I\u2019m the only one who immediately went to college and then to\ngraduate school and ended up with a PhD. They, | have enormous, enormous\nrespect for my sisters. They, they both went to nursing school and became nurses.\nBut then my youngest sister went on and went to college and got her degree and\nthen went on and became a, a nurse pediatric clinician. So, and this, she is a\nremarkable young lady, | mean was, she, all of us did very badly in Holland.\nAcademically, all of us fell apart. And Helga, my youngest sister developed a\nhorrendous thyroid condition and, and stopped learning and stopped, she just, oh,\ntense and miserable and unhappy. So when, so she didn\u2019t go to school anymore.\nSo she was 14 and missed enormous amounts of school. We came to America,\nAnita Frank 51\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 51\nagain thank God, and, and, and she, we came to America in December of \u201952 and\nthe following summer, she was operated on in Jewish hospital and they took out this\nhuge goiter. It was benign and she grew five inches. She was just tiny developed\nand went back to school and she\u2019s a very bright young lady. But she had to,\nwhereas | sort of followed the classic route high school and college and graduate\nschool, she, they went to nursing school which doesn't really, in those days, she\ndidn't go to the university but to a hospital nursing program so they never had the\nchance to really develop their, oh how do | say this, their intellect in a way that | had.\nAnd so they did it later and then Ingrid also went to college and ended up as a, she,\nshe graduated also from college so they, in their adulthood, they did phenomenally\nand Helga, my youngest sister is, has just done spectacularly.

        "A: You know we all have different backgrounds. | was the child who tried to be\nperfect, so | had this total sense of worthlessness so my recovery had to be believing\nmyself again. My middle sister, | don\u2019t think, | mean my middle sister has also\naccomplished a great deal. Build a business but | think still suffers tremendously\nfrom low self-esteem, a lack of self-worth. So | don\u2019t think, | don\u2019t think she has\nrecovered and they have not dealt with it as extensively. My youngest sister, it's\nhard for me to say. She functions exquisitely. She is married, has four children, is\na grandmother, just, just also has fulfilled the American dream. A wonderful mother,\nAnita Frank 52\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 52\nwonderful grandmother, but also | don\u2019t think has, we can talk. She and | can talk.\nBut | don\u2019t think she has worked as extensively as | have at sort of making all the\nconnections so | cannot, okay, the way, and so the way it manifested for her that she,\nlike me, when she was raising her children, she also had to be perfect. She also\nhad to do everything right. She also had to cope. She also never could complain.\nShe\u2019s another one of those, and so is my middle sister too, unbelievable women who\njust do. Just like my mother. But in the process of doing for others, that\u2019s not so\nhot either because then your children don't really get the message that they need to\ndo for themselves so what we have done to our children, we\u2019ve done too much for\nour children. And | think that |, more than the others, was aware of that. | think\nthat\u2019s the big difference, that in raising our son, that | would, that | was over, | was\noverprotective of him but from the very beginning | would say to him, \u201cLoren(ph), this\nis my problem, not your problem. | am sorry that | need to know where you are all\nthe time. It\u2019s not because | don\u2019t trust you, it\u2019s because inside of me, | cannot still\ncannot believe that you're really, that, that you're gonna be with me. That | just to\nknow.

So he, he\nhas all his life been willing to, to work with me and let me know where he is, | mean\nthat's been the major thing. Let, just let me Know where you are and he's always\ndone so, throughout his adolescence. If he would be late, he\u2019d call me up. Never\nAnita Frank 53\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 53\nresented it. And, and | think part of it was that | let him know that, | let him know\nwhat my problems were because of the war. My overprotectiveness, my fear of\nlosing him. Whereas my sisters, | think did the same thing but in a, they, they didn't\nquite communicate all these ideas to their children. Now the kids have been, they're\nfine but, but, but whereas Loren(ph) has extraordinarily high self-esteem,\nextraordinarily, | mean, is so confident about who he is and so directed and so\npurposeful and so at peace with himself. |, he is, he is a, he\u2019s one of the healthiest\npeople I\u2019ve ever met in my life.

        "A: Yeah, no, but I, | think you\u2019re hitting critical perspective from my, because, because\nwe were raised, | mean we, my sisters, my brother and | were raised in this\nhorrendously dangerous world. | mean the world was so unsafe for us and it\nremained unsafe for so many years and the clue to happiness, the clue to no, the\nclue to our well-being has been to be able to begin to feel safe in this, in this world.\nAnd that\u2019s not an easy transition to make because it basically means you stop looking\nat the outer world to become safe for you but you, you become safe within yourself.",
        "A: Hard work. Hard work. It\u2019s, it's, as | work with people, that\u2019s what | really try and\nteach them is how do you do that and, and, for me, the, the single most important\nclue is that when | was so unsafe and felt so defeated, | let the whole world define\nme. Itwas Anita who had to be this perfect, obedient, good, accepting, non-creative\nbasically, because if | did anything creative, my goodness, it might annoy people so\nthis trapped in a, in a box person who tried to please everybody and tried to avoid\nmaking anybody mad so that at least | would get positive input from others. | mean\ngoing back to Elizabeth Dixon is, she, | had to translate that at least she values me.\nAnita Frank 56\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 56\nWell, if she values me, there must be some value to me \u2018cause | didn\u2019t feel it. So it\nis stopping that, it\u2019s stopping looking to others to make you feel safe and begin to\nreally get to Know yourself and define yourself. It\u2019s at self-definition. It's knowing\nwho you are. Its Knowing your strengths, knowing your weaknesses. It is when\npeople are mad at you, it's not to say oh my gosh, I'm a bad person but to say, oh,\nyou're mad atme. Well, who's problem is it? Is it your problem, is it really something\nI've done? If it\u2019s something I\u2019ve done, that\u2019s something | can learn from. What do |\nneed to, | need to work on changing that so it\u2019s not closing myself off from others, it\u2019s\nremaining open to the input that others give me but at a very, on a very limited basis.\nBecause | recognize that everybody else is probably crazier than | am and to let other\npeople define me, hah! What a joke that is. | mean we, the Nazis defined us as dirty,\nfilthy Jews worthy of extermination. No one will ever define me again. So it\u2019s partly\nagain, it\u2019s a reaction to that. Nobody will define me. | will define myself. But within\nthe context of my environment so to avoid becoming this extreme narcissist, you, you\nwant to remain open to input but you want to weigh it against what you know about\nyourself. That\u2019s, and this way you keep on growing and the, and the most wonderful\nthing is the more at peace you are with yourself, the nicer you can be to other people.\nYou don't, cause you don't have to destroy others to feel good about yourself. Asa\nmatter of fact, it hurts you to be negative or destructive to others and so you know\nthat those who are destructive, there\u2019s something wrong with them. Because if you\ntruly feel good about yourself, you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to hurt others, cause it hurts\nyou if you are.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnita Frank of\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 57",

They have been my teachers. Right now | work at the\nmedical school. | have a wonderful job at the medical school but when | worked with\nAnita Frank 58\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 58\npatients, | learned from them.

        "A: Oh, | broke all the rules. | broke every rule and that is that the classic rules of\ncounseling are that all these worries about transference and counter-transference\nand all this other garbage and how you need to let the patient come up with all the\nsolutions and how you don't insert yourself into it and how you don't, all these things.\n| broke every single one of those rules. And what | basically, what I, the way |\nperceived it, it was more reeducating people, the way | had to reeducate myself and\nthat is to help people to begin to define, learn how to define themselves and, and\nbegin to appreciate themselves and how, how to do that. I\u2019ve got a whole schema\nfor doing that and, and | would come up with ideas but always in such a way that |\nwould say look. I\u2019m just gonna share these with you. These are tools. It,\neverything is in your control. Everything is within your power so always leave you\nthe power and leave in the control with, with my clients. And as a result, | could\ndevelop very equal relationships and people never saw me as telling what to do but\nit was a sharing which was super healing. _ It, it just, and it was amazing how quickly\npeople, not everybody but an overwhelming majority were able to just begin to look\nat their life from a different perspective and learn different ways of dealing with it.\nAnita Frank 59\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 59",

Let me know, you know better than | do.\nIf we talk about something that, that you don\u2019t, you find offensive, let me know. So\nthat it was, | was, I\u2019ve never been the expert. | mean, and I, in my work at the\nmedical school, |\u2019m trying to teach our medical students, that as future physicians,\nit\u2019s still the patient who is the expert on the patient.",
        "A: It's not the physician. The physician may be the expert on the disease and on\nsome treatment but the patient is the expert on, on what's wrong with the patient\nand if you don\u2019t respect that and don't elicit from the patient what's going on and what\nthey think what\u2019s going on, you're gonna lose three quarters of your information.\nAnd particularly true in management of illness is that, always three quarters of that is\nwithin the patient's domain. Because | can't prescribe, | mean, that\u2019s why | will tell\nwith my clients, | mean | can suggest that you might try this but it\u2019s up to you to do it.\nNow is this going to be possible for you? And some of them will say, yes and | say\nwell, how do you see yourself doing this? It\u2019s letting always your clients come up with\na plan, always have them, have them come up with the ideas as much as possible\nabout what\u2019s gonna work for them. And have them be in charge of their own healing\nAnita Frank 60\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 60\nbecause only then is there gonna be a chance that they will actually pursue the ideas.\nBut if | tell somebody else what to do, the chance of \u2018em doing it are very small. It\nshouldn't, and so to that, and, but where | differ from classic counseling is that | will\ncome up with, | will say, | won't say a lot of counseling is how do you feel about this,\nhow do you feel about this, how do you feel about this. |, like you feel about it is only\nmarginally useful. | much more focus, okay, what are you gonna do about it.

That's critical because otherwise you remain a victim of your past. But then\nyou need to free yourself from your past as much as possible. Now, | won't ever be\nable to free myself completely and that\u2019s okay because | should never forget. But\nwhat | can do and what also my clients mostly need to do is they need to overcome\nthe horrendous messages of their childhood.

        "A: Problem-based learning. It basically means that they have, it\u2019s a modified\nproblem-based learning so they meet in tutorial groups and there is a lot of\nresponsibility for self learning, for hypothesizing. | mean all the things, all the things\nAnita Frank 62\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 62\nthat | think are important, thinking, problem-solving, analyzing and my job as the\nbehavioral scientist, | see as my major job is to, to teach our medical students to see\npatients at the partners, as their partners and not as diseases because medical\nschool is heavily biological and so our, our physicians are trained to look at the\ndisease process and at very little else. And so my major job is to keep the patient\nin mind, and to keep the patient as the focus and to deal with the patient as a partner\nand not just as the carrier of a disease. And it\u2019s very exciting and, and I\u2019m\nparticularly interested in the management treatment part of it where basically the\npatient should, we should have very different approaches. Physicians have a\ntendency to tell patients what to do, this is what you should, without explaining much,\nwithout looking at a patient\u2019s circumstances to see whether in effect they can one,\nbuy the medicine, take, take the medicine. Can they relax, can they adhere, do they\nunderstand what's going on? What are the pressures, what are the miseries, what\nare the situations at home? | mean, you can tell somebody to stop smoking, well,\nthat\u2019s not gonna to do a bit of good. You need to understand what role smoking\nplays in this, this person\u2019s life. And are they interested in quitting? And where are\nthey and how often have they tried? So, it\u2019s a, its a much of a comprehensive,\npatient-centered approach. Very respectful of the patient.",

        "A: Itis. They\u2019re wonderful. It\u2019s a great place to work.",
        "A: Yes. Verynice. Yes. Because we expect physicians to be super-human. And\nthey're just people, bright people on the whole, and caring people on the whole. But\nthat\u2019s all they are. And one of the great tragedies is is that in the traditional\napproach, our physicians are taught, it becomes, because they tend to be obsessive-\ncompulsive, they tend to be perfectionists, they tend to be hard-driven and so on.\nWhat they want to do is they want to fix things. And they're happy when they can\nfix something. And when they can't fix something, they get very unhappy and very\nstressed and so what happens very often is that, particularly during the dying process\nwhen they can\u2019t do anymore for a patient, they abandon the patient. Because they\ncant do anymore. And so you see this avoidance behavior. That's because\nAnita Frank 64\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 64\nthey're uncomfortable. They can't, they can't fix, the other focus for me is is that\nthere is very little fixing you guys can do. _ If you\u2019re lucky you can cut out a, you can\ncure a bacterial illness with some antibiotics and you can cut out a cancer and you\ncan do, you can do some other things that truly fix things. But most of the time, it\nisn\u2019t as simple as that. Most of the time you just have to learn to work with your\npatient to make it as, to make it better. But that means you need to be in partnership\nwith your patient. And don\u2019t worry so much about fixing it.",

And everything\nwe had, my parents sold the furniture because that\u2019s to pay for the voyage so we just\nhad | think, 16 or 17 suitcases and boxes with us, perhaps not that many, nine, | don't\nknow how many. But that was all we had. And it was amazing, it was November\nand it was rough and all, what | remember most from that journey was just being so\nsick to my stomach and throwing up in the bathroom. And then when we got to New\nYork, it was sort of amazing too, \u2018cause we got to New York, and Henry Coster(ph)\nAnita Frank 70\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 70\nand his wife, Peggy, happened to be in New York for, for film, to watch, to watch films\nor plays or whatever itwas. And they knew when we were, when, | guess they knew\nthat, our arrival time. And, and, but we had no idea they would be there so we really\nhad no idea what to do when we got to New York. So it was really interesting. We\nwere waiting for all our luggage to get off the boat. There | saw this man looking and\nI'd seen his picture and | went up to him and | said, \u201cAre you Henry Coster(ph)?\u201d And\nhe says, \u201cYes.\u201d And \u2018cause he didn't recognize us and here we were, you think a\nfamily with four children. But I, |, and why, | just remembered him from his picture,\nso, which was, which turned out to be very nice. He'd rented a big car and found us\na cheap hotel. So we stayed a couple of days in New York and then took the bus to\nSt. Louis. And then seven days later or four days later, | took the bus to California.\nSo, I\u2019m taking a bus ride and coming, coming through Albuquerque for the first time.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. It was exciting. It was hard for us to imagine what\nAmerica would look like and arriving New York is so overwhelming, all these\nbuildings. One most terrifying things were the, the ambulance sirens, | mean,\nbecause they sound just like our sirens during the war and that was terrifying. Every\ntime we heard sirens, we ducked. So it was really hard getting used to the, to the\nfire engines and the ambulances, the police cars. That was the most distressing\npart. But it was sort of amazing to be in this huge city and | can remember we would\nbuy food and eat in our hotel room. And my mother had some ancient aunts who\nlived in New York, we visited them. Tanta(ph), they were, as a matter of fact, they\nAnita Frank 71\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 71\nwere my grandfather's sisters. Tanta Rebecca(ph), Tanta Rosa(ph). And, and\nthen we, and then my mother had some distant cousins in St. Louis who had agreed\nto help us and so we stayed there for couple of weeks. My parents did and | went\nto California.",
        "A: Bob Fenton(ph)? No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. No, he died, he died of melanoma, | think, many, many years ago. But,\nand his wife remarried, Mary Fenton(ph) and they moved to the east coast and | think\nmy youngest sister, Helga, has had some contact with her but | haven't. We did,\nafter we came to America because he lived in California and when my parents moved\nto California in 1958, they spent some time with him. And so they were friends, they\nremained friends. But then he, | forgot my, and then in 1965, my parents moved to\nWashington because that\u2019s where | was and | think we lost contact then.",
        "A: Oh, my sister, my youngest sister Helga would pick them up. I, she, this was, we\nlived in, in this little town near Falkenburg , In Holland, Lindbergh(ph),\nand what we would do, the American soldiers, the white soldiers were, were sort of\nbivouacked in, in a hotel and then the blacks were right across the fields in tents.\nAnita Frank 72\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 72\nAnd we'd go down and just sort of stand there, my mother had always told us not to\never ask for anything \u2018cause that was impolite, so, American soldiers just adored us\nbecause there were cute little girls, eight, six, seven and eight. And they just looked\nthere, at the, at these soldiers and so we always ended up with the most goodies.\nAnd I'm not quite sure but my youngest sister, Helga, she\u2019d, she\u2019d come home, she\njust sort of told him to come with us, so, so, one day Bob Fenton(ph) came. One\nday she came home with a chaplain and said, \u201cMommy, that\u2019s the best | could find.\u201d\nGood taste. So, it was mostly that, it was safe, totally safe for us those days. And\nwe just sort of, I\u2019m not quite sure in retrospect, that we just asked them to come home\nwith us. And of course they would, they loved being in a home \u2018cause these poor\nguys had been out in a field and so on so, it was fun and it was incredible to meet\nJewish soldiers \u2018cause that immediately formed a tie. | can remember, was another\nsoldier named Jimmy. Jimmy would knock us on our head and he also told us that\nthe first one who learned Mary Had a Little Lamb would get ten cents. | won ten\ncents. And then, first one my father taught me, my first words in English were, he\nsaid, \u201cIf people ask you if you speak English, just answer, just, just a few words.\u201d So\nmy, my first knowledge of English consisted of just a few words. And those were\nthe only words | knew. But! learned English quickly. It's amazing how quickly we\npicked up.",
        "A: Oh yes, well, what happened in those days is that the, after, they, we had were\nliberated these soldiers would go to, they went to Germany. And they sent us\npackages from Germany. And they went into homes and | guess stole, stole\nclothings. For quite a while, we were clothed in German, dresses and stuff like that.\nSort of hate the thought now but in those days, that was all we had. And yeah, we\njust, he was just a lovely guy and he stayed in touch with us. He was tall and dark\nhair, curly dark hair, and just warm and caring and it was just, it, it, you cannot imagine\nwhat it is like to look at soldiers and know they could kill you. For four years that\nthey were these dangerous creatures. And then to get, have the Americans come\nand have them be your friends and your liberators and your lifesavers basically, it\u2019s,\nit's an extraordinary feeling so of course we felt all this love and warmth for American\nsoldiers. They really represented everything that was, well our life. They\nrepresented our life to us.",
        "A: I'm not sure, that was before they went into Germany, was 1944. I\u2019m not sure\nthey, those soldiers knew. | don't think so. | don't think so. That was before they\nliberated the concentration camps. | think Auschwitz, the, the Soviets liberated\nAuschwitz. So | don't think the Americans were as aware. _| think the first German\nconcentration camp, camp liberated was Dachau and then Bergen-Belsen by the\nBritish. Was a while | think before the Americans just recognized, whether they\nAnita Frank 74\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 74\neven, whether these soldiers actually knew, | doubt, | mean the government and\nother people knew but I\u2019m not sure the soldiers knew.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Yes, they did.",
        "A: Yes, it could have, yes it could have. | know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh my goodness. Well, | was at Washington University and | remember my first\nmajor was chemistry and that didn't work out so well. | decided | wasn't a born\nchemist. And then | went to French, and then one day | took a political science\ncourse and sometimes you just hit your love and | just absolutely became enchanted\nwith political science and | was already a junior in college. And! was just fascinated\nby the Soviet Union. It was my first course with international relations course and |\nbecame fascinated by the Soviet Union. And I\u2019m trying to think why. I, | don\u2019t know\nwhy. In retrospect the, it was a country that was mysterious, they were, this was in\nthe fifties, | went to college in \u201954 to \u201858. So that was the height of the Cold War.\nAnd | think it just grabbed my attention perhaps because of my experiences during\nthe war as it was Nazi power, with the Nazi Germany as a great power, that perhaps,\nAnita Frank 75\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 75\nperhaps | felt that understanding the Soviet Union better might help me do something\nworthwhile or some, something like that. It was certainly not because | had any\nCommunist interest. It was truly because the Soviet Union represented danger |\nthink and, and another great power and fascination. And then I, then | went to\nHarvard in the Russian Studies program and | was, and | was right because it was a\nwonderful choice because it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a, has an unbelievable history. Russian history\nis, is unbelievable history. And the Russian, and | spent a lot of time in the Soviet\nUnion and the Russian people are remarkable people in many ways so it, it, intuitively\n|, | just picked the right country to be particularly interested in.",
        "A: | did research on Soviet Military and Foreign Affairs. | actually read Pravda and\n, the papers and translated articles and really tried to come up with themes\nand sort of whether we could learn anything from the open press.

        "A: Well, they, they were the research organization for the Air Force really. And they\nprimarily did military, they did primarily military and economic and foreign policy\nresearch for the Air Force. It was sort of, it was the research arm of the Air Force.\nNow they've expanded. They, they do a lot of research in health areas. _| still think\nthat their major contractor is the Air Force but they've, they do, they do superb\nresearch. They attracts very high caliber people and but now they've expanded to\nAnita Frank 76\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 76\nresearch in education, research on health issues, research on public welfare issues\nand prison, prison systems. They, they tend to do massive studies. They, drug,\ndrug intervention studies. So they\u2019ve expanded far away a focus on international\nand, and foreign affairs issues of, in China, Russia, Europe. | mean they, they cover\nthe whole field to, to now also national issues.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. That's what we studied, | studied at Harvard. And then | spent, |\nspent about ten and a half months in the Soviet Union as a guide in American exhibit.\nThat certainly helped my Russian a lot. But tragically, I\u2019ve forgotten most of it now\nbecause | haven't used it in so long but one of the great experiences in my life was\nbeing a guide on a, ona U.S., part of the U.S. - Soviet cultural exchange program.\nIncredible experience. That's where | met Elizabeth Dixon, was in, in Moscow.\nWas it Moscow or Leningrad? Leningrad, was Leningrad, were in Leningrad.\n[talkover] Near St. Petersburg.",
        "A: No, Americans, Russians. This was a U.S., a U.S. sponsored exhibit, American\nexhibit in the Soviet Union. So we'd speak to Russians. They'd come and see the\nwonders of, of America and one of the great experiences, I'll never forget and of\ncourse this was still in the early sixties, still the Cold War was raging. One of the,\nseveral very powerful experiences there. One was a man came and he was a, he\nwas a Party member and he was telling us about the glories of the Soviet Union and\nAnita Frank 77\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 77\nhe was seemed exceedingly nice and he asked us about the United States and he\nasked about unemployment and racism and we were very open about...\n[End of side one of tape 3]",
        "A: That, they would ask a lot about the negative things: unemployment, racism,\ndiscrimination, poverty, etc., etc., and we'd, we'd very, were very open about that\nunlike the Soviets where everything had to be perfect. But yes, that we had those\nissues but the way it had been, it was so interesting, on the one hand they were told\nthat they must overtake the United States. On the other hand they were told what a\nterrible country America was. Now it\u2019s pretty hard to overtake a country that is so\nterrible so there was some internal, were some internal contradictions. But anyway,\nthis guy came and so he asked, he was very kind and he asked all these sort of\nquestions about unemployment and yeah. | talked with him and then | happened to\nsee him outside of the exhibit hall in, in, sort of on the stairs. And we started to talk\nand it turns out, he\u2019s told me he was Jewish. And | said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m Jewish, too.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cYou are?\u201d And it was just like this total change came, came over him and he\nsaid, \u201cIs there really unemployment in America? Is there really any racism ?\u201d | mean,\nit's just like he\u2019s, talk the party line but then when it came to trusting me because he\nfelt that he could, it was just like questioning everything. So that was sort of, yeah,\nand | said, \u201cyes, we do,\u201d but, I, | tried to put in context of yes, there is racism but\nthere\u2019s also something we're working on. Yes, there is unemployment but people\nare not just out in the streets starving to death, we have unemployment. | mean just\nAnita Frank 78\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 78\ntrying to put an end to, and there's yes, there is poverty. | mean, we've got all the\nproblems but you look, anyway. And so that was, that was sort of a nice story and\nthen another, one of the most touching stories was in, in, | think it was in Leningrad,\nit was in Leningrad again. The first one was in Moscow, the second one was in\nLeningrad, now St. Petersburg. Where a woman came and wanted a San Francisco\nphone book and, and | gave her the phone book and she looked up some addresses\nand, and then disappeared. Just before the exhibit closed, the same woman came\nback and her face was just beaming. She was absolutely, she said, \u201cI found my\nsister.\u201d And she, her sister had left, also Jewish. The sister had left for the United\nStates before the war and she hadn\u2019t heard from her in, that was, this was now \u201965,\nin 25 years. And she'd found her sister's name in the phone book, had telegrammed\nher or called her and she sent, she showed me the telegram from her sister. |, |,\nshe said, \u201cOverjoyed at hearing from you.\u201d So it brought, and it, couple of times,\nsome Russians, particularly Jews, found relatives that had gone to America because\nwe had phone books from all over the country, so.",
        "A: Yeah and amazing stories.",
        "A: Yes. Absolutely. And | think they felt that warmth with me because | could\nunderstand them. | mean, what, what they had suffered was beyond imagination.\nAnd so | think they could feel from me my enormous sympathy for them. And\nAnita Frank 79\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 79\nwhereas for most Americans they did not know Russian history as much nor did they\nunderstand the horrors, particularly what Leningrad went through. Leningrad and\nKiev turned out that both exhibits went to Moscow, Kiev and Leningrad. And Kiev\nalso was just destroyed and of course in Kiev we had the, the horrendous massacre\nof the Jews at Babiy Yar. And so we went to Babiy Yar and, and it was interesting\nthat particularly the, in Kiev, the survivors, the, the Jewish survivors connected\nstrongly with those of us, we didn\u2019t have too many Jews in the exhibit, but connected\nstrongly with those of us who were Jewish. And it was, it was, it was a wonderful\nthing. It was a real connector. It just transcended, being Jewish transcended\nnationality.",
        "A: And the, and the, and the Cold War. It certainly transcended the Cold War, no\nquestion about it.",
        "A: No, no, no. Not those things. And |, and | don't have any idea whether this is\nfear-related or whether this related to the war but whereas intellectually I\u2019m totally\ncomfortable with making mistakes, emotionally, when people disapprove of\nsomething that I\u2019ve done or angry with me, it still gives me a pang of ahhhh. But |\nget over that very quickly. It is, but I, but | think that is so common to most of us\nwomen and to most people that I\u2019m not sure where that\u2019s a remnant of the war years\nAnita Frank 80\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 80\nor whether that is, that is a, whether, whether that is just part of being, most, few of\nus sort of like to be corrected or, or criticized or disapproved of so, | think, | still, there\u2019s\npart of me that still wants to please others even though intellectually | know that\u2019s not\nwhat | should be doing. But | know a large part of me is still is into, | mean little\nthings. | will be talking to somebody and | won't ever be the first one to walk away.\nJust always being aware of who else is involved and including them, it\u2019s, somebody\nsays you wanna do that, instead of saying no | can\u2019t, | will say | can, I'll try. It\u2019s that\nstill, | still, part of me still tries to please more than I\u2019m comfortable with. | think that\u2019s\npart of the war. |, | still think that\u2019s part of the old me. But that\u2019s, that\u2019s about it.\nThose are not necessarily bad, bad things. No fears, driving sometimes, | worry\nabout my husband's driving, and I'm always but that\u2019s common. No, it\u2019s amazing,\n| really don\u2019t. My mother did but! don\u2019t. That's one of the great blessings of having\nbeen a child. | didn\u2019t integrate, at least | did not integrate the horror of the war, |\nreally didn't. |, that\u2019s not fair. 1, not the way | would have as an adult because I, as\nnow, I\u2019m totally aware of what happened but as a child all | knew that | would be killed\nif they discovered if, which is a heavy thing for a child to live with. But! did not\nunderstand everything else that was going on. That was not until much later. So,\nthank God | didn\u2019t, I, it\u2019s beyond my understanding how concentration camp survivors\ncan live with all their memories. _ It\u2019s, it\u2019s unbearable and for some it\u2019s so unbearable\nthat, in effect, it\u2019s, I've heard one of my friends who survived four concentration camps\nincluding, as a matter of fact he\u2019s a Schindler, he was on Schindler's list for a while.\nHe\u2019s a Schindler Jew. And he survived the Auschwitz and | think Dachau-\nAnita Frank 81\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 81\nBookenvalt(ph) and he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t survive.\u201d And | totally understand that.

And again, | did, | did wnat | was supposed to do. | didn\u2019t question,\n| wasn't, | mean when | look at my own son and all his questioning and all his rebellion\nand all his, well not so much rebellion but certainly insistence on doing his own thing,\n|, that wasn\u2019t my style. | did what was asked of me and | did it. | didn\u2019t ask whether\nit was good for me, | just, they wanted one of us to come and so | was the oldest girl,\nAnita Frank 84\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 84\n| was the obvious one, obvious and by far the most mature one.

        "A: | don't think Baskin Robbins, Robbins had been discovered yet. No but they had\na freezer with ice cream. | couldn't believe anybody having ice cream at home.\nWe'd had no refrigerator in Holland. We had a little gas stove. | mean, goodness\ngracious, you come from little tiny Holland to this mansion with a butler and maid and\naye, aye, aye. Whataculture shock.",
        "A: Oh unbelievable, absolutely. Mind-blowing, ridiculous, overwhelming.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, got lots of books. It\u2019s interesting, | find it harder and harder to do so.\nIt just, in my, | think my rage has intensified. That doesn\u2019t sound consistent with\nwhat I\u2019ve said because I\u2019m, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not guided by that rage, I\u2019m not controlled by\nthat rage. But when | read about it, it just, my incomprehension just increases. |\ncannot imagine, | cannot imagine this actually happening and the older | get | think\nyou sort of have, your child is grown, you've done, you've, you're sort of at a pretty\nAnita Frank 85\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 85\nstable level and you can think back on, on life and put it more in perspective and the\nmore | try to put it in perspective, the more incomprehensible it becomes. So | find\nmyself, |, | just find it harder and harder to, to read about it and to certainly to see, to\nsee the films. They\u2019re just unbearable. Instead of getting easier, gets, gets harder.",
        "A: No, exact opposite [talkover].",
        "A: Yeah, incomprehensible. That people let this happen, that it did happen. And\nthat | Keep on thinking of the million and a half children who never had a chance.\nAnd what this world would have been like if they had been allowed to live because\nthe potential, the unbelievable potential of that population. And they just annihilated\nit. And all these millions were deprived of living and experiencing love and affection.\nAnd the other thing | think about is I, | cannot bear to think and this happened, this\nbecame stronger after, after Loren(ph) was born. It\u2019s just, | cannot imagine what it\nmust have been like for parents to see their children gassed. And |, | just, it, it\u2019s, or\nto live with the horrendous fear of what was gonna happen to them. It\u2019s beyond my\ncomprehension. | think about that a lot.",
        "A: Allsorts. All sorts. In Europe, in the horror in some way, Hitler, Hitler succeeded\nyou see. He made Europe youdenrine(ph), free of Jews. That was his, his major\nAnita Frank 86\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 86\naim. And it\u2019s not totally free of Jews. | mean, Holland has about 35,000 Jews we\nthink out of a population of 16 million. They used to have ten percent about of its\npopulation was Jewish, not it\u2019s just a tiny percentage. French has, France has what,\nhalf a million Jews, | don\u2019t Know, probably not that much, what 50 thousand Jews, |\ndon't know. Germany has a few, Poland has practically none and Poland had three\nmillion before the war, so. | mean, they, they succeeded. They really succeeded.\nAnd | think the Europe is the poorer for it.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right. It doesn\u2019t end. It doesn\u2019t end.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: But all that you can do is look at the survivors and what they have accomplished\nwhich is pretty, pretty impressive. | look at my own family and | look at my cousins\nand you look at the children and it\u2019s incredible who these children are. We know the\nchildren of the children who survived. It\u2019s just, they are incredible people and we're\njust a tiny percentage. | mean, they're real contributors to society.",
        "A: Where?",
        "A: It depended on the country. Holland lost, | think, 80 percent of its Jews. France\nlost about, France and Germany didn't lose that many. In Germany, many of \u2018em\nemigrated, thank God. Russia lost, Poland lost three million. Poland lost almost 95\npercent of its Jews and that was a heavily, the heaviest population of Jews was in\neastern, really was in Europe and, and western Russia. And they lost | think that,\nfrom the west, probably like, well probably couple of hundred thousand. I\u2019ve got the\nnumbers actually, I\u2019ve got the, got a book with all the numbers of, but |, at least half\nthe Jewish population. Atleast half the population of European Jews was killed and\nthen a quarter, the rest emigrated. So what's left is just perhaps a quarter, if that\nmany.",
        "A: Yeah. [talkover] | think they killed, they killed at least half. | think there were\nabout 11 million Jews. They killed 6 million of us. So perhaps 5 million survived.\nThey survived in Russia itself, in Moscow, Kiev, not Kiev, but Moscow, Leningrad.\nCause Leningrad lost over a hundred thousand people because of the, the blockade.\nMany of whom were Jews. But, but Russia must have lost, I\u2019m sure, over a million\nJews, at least. Then Lithuania, all those and \u2018course in those countries were just\nviolently anti-Semitic, Lithuanians, Latvians, Ukrainians, awful, just horrible. Awful.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: | started it. |, |, that, for nine months |, that was part of the Eric(ph) System, the\nclearinghouse system that the Office of Education started then, started one higher\neducation and I, | was the associate director. | had no director so | got the whole\nthing going. So that was really my major job there was to get the documents. What\nit does it gets the unpublished documents in education and puts them, and makes\nthem available through publications. And so what it meant, was that\u2019s how | met my\nhusband, actually. On one of those trips. | had to, | traveled to various universities\nand, who had lots of publications and got \u2018em all into the Eric(ph) System and\npublished the abstracts and the syllabi and stuff like that. Was fun. Great job, lots\nof travel, met my husband so what more and then I, and | only stayed there for nine\nday, for nine months because then |, | met Alan. | started it in September, | met Alan\nin October and got married the following May so I\u2019m afraid that | was a, my great job\nbut not a very long-lasting job. But | got a director just before | left so that was\nperfect. |, got the stuff, got the thing going and then was able to leave.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: On my one day trip to Albuquerque. The president of UNM, the University of New\nMexico was giving a dinner for our group and Alan had just come here as a new\npsychiatrist for the department and a, and he was invited to this party also because\nhe was a new faculty member and he had been widowed and we met at this party.\nIt was just amazing and we started to talk and | fully expected him to say oh gee, I\u2019ve\ngotta go see so and so. He didnt. | had no interest in meeting somebody else.\nSo we sort of talked and he wrote and eventually | wrote back and | visited him and |\nvisited him again and that was it. It was very quick. And | was, let's see, 1968, so\nalmost 28 years ago. Amazing, huh?",
        "A: Yeah, perfect.",
        "A: Oh no, not a perfect marriage. But it\u2019s been, |, | don\u2019t think | would have done as\nwell with anybody else that, that Alan was just pretty much the ideal person in terms\nof letting me become the person, | think I\u2019m, |, | think that who | am today was exactly\nthe potential that | had as a two-year-old and, and it just has been allowed to blossom.\nAnd that may sound very, very self-serving but | like who | am today. | am very\ncontent with the person who | am and | like what I\u2019m doing and | like how | feel.\nYeah. And I\u2019m in control of my life and it\u2019s, it\u2019s a good feeling of being where you\nwanna be and being who you wanna be.\nAnita Frank 90\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 90",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah, because who | was after the Holocaust, after the war was the\nexact, in some ways the exact opposite of who | am today. | was scared, terrified,\nno self-esteem, just, just, just, just, just totally defined by the world outside of me and,\nand no sense of self at all.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. After the war, yes. Because those changes, you see during the war, it was,\nit was totally different but after the war, yeah, she told me after she came to, she\ncame to visit us in America as a matter of fact. She said she felt I'd changed a lot\nand was Clearly, she wasn't happy with my changes.",
        "A: Well, |, she saw me after we were married. | was pregnant with Loren(ph). We\nvisited, the last time | saw her | think was \u201972 and it was wonderful to see her then\nand | think she saw that, as a matter of fact she commented | was back to her old\nLeesha(ph).",

        "A: Yeah. Family relationships, marriage, child development, infant development. _ It\nwas, it was the developmental interactional part of, that I, that | focused on.

Oh, human growth seminars and human growth and\ndevelopment.",
        "A: Well, again, I, | sort of, | think I\u2019m the kind of person who's easily interested in what\ngoes on around her and so after | married Alan and | was thinking now what am |\ngonna do with my life and my masters in Russian Studies didn\u2019t help me much here\nin Albuquerque, New Mexico. | decided well I\u2019m go back to school and basically |\ngot pregnant and went back to school at exactly the same time. And just started\ntaking child development courses and fell in love with those like I'd like fallen in love\nwith Russian foreign policy. | just found them fascinating and I\u2019ve never taken a\npsychology course at Washington University so, it was just a whole new world\nopening forme. So again, it just, | found something else that interested me. | think\nAnita Frank 92\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 92\nthat\u2019s how my life is. I\u2019m, I\u2019m easily interested in what\u2019s going on in the world so, |,\nI've lots of, | get excited about a whole bunch of things.",
        "A: It was perfect.",
        "A: It was perfect, absolutely perfect. | remember as Loren(ph) was growing up,\nkeeping track of whether he was on target or not. Thank heavens he tended to be\non target.",
        "A: No, but it was very clear to me from the very beginning that he clearly was a very\nbright child so | was a very proud obnoxious mother, I\u2019m afraid. He, and |\nencouraged that enormously, interesting. That\u2019s certainly part of my heritage is that\n| didn\u2019t care if he was an athlete or not, at all. | couldn\u2019t have cared less. What! did\ncare about was his intellectual development. And if he had wanted to punish me all\nhe would have had to do is flunk out of school. Because for me, education has been\nthe absolutely essential ingredient for taking control of life and, and so when he was\ndeveloping into this incredibly delightful bright kid,\nEnd of Tape 3.\nAnita Frank 93\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 93\nTape 4",
        "A: [talkover] He turned out to be exactly the kind of child that | had hoped for. |\nmean, | don\u2019t think | could have designed a child more to my dreams than Loren(ph)\nactually turned out to be, so what a fortunate parent | am. | give him 95 percent of\nthe credit, I'll take about five.",
        "A: Alan gets, well, he, he\u2019s included the 95. Alan gets five, | get five and Loren(ph)\ngets 90.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, | think that, that\u2019s really significant from my perspective and that is\nthat one of the great blessings from my perspective about this country is, is that we\u2019ve\nmade a lot of mistakes. You and | talked a little bit before we put the tape on, we\ntalked a little bit about America\u2019s role during the war and the fact that the State\nDepartment had lots of anti-Semites in it and, and that this country knew, the\ngovernment knew was happening to Jews and didn't do anything. That | think\nRoosevelt tried, there, absolutely no support for it, that the Jewish Underground\nbegged the British and Americans who bombed the rail lines and the concentration\ncamps and that, there were no bombs available or some excuses were given why\nAnita Frank 94\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 94\nthat couldn't be done. And how many lives could have been saved if, if some\nrelatively simple measures had been taken. And that then of course then America\ninvited all these Nazis, these Nazi scientists, Gunter(ph), what is it, Gunter von\nBraun(ph), that was the guy, to come to America and, and to work on the weapons\nprograms here. And we've hidden, | mean, we still, we\u2019re discovering Nazis left and\nright still. It\u2019s pretty late now. So | think this, and of course the, the horror of not\nletting the Jews and the, they, they, the ones who left Hamburg | think or Bramen(ph)\non the, the ship, St. Louis and they were refused entry here and had to go back to\nan, to Germany or taken to the gas chamber. So, this country has no, has not an\nunblemished record, far from it in many ways. And that is | think, true in Europe. |,\n|, | think there isn\u2019t, Denmark perhaps, Denmark really had a small number of Jews\nand they, the king as a leader, behaved nobly and its population followed. They, as\na country, get a lot of credit. And, and I, | expect the, | accept the fact that we all\nmake mistakes but what! cannot accept is that we don't acknowledge our mistakes.\n| think one of the great blessings of this country is, is we, we allow, we encourage\nourselves to examine our past and our policies and our history and we, there is a lot\nof self-criticism going on. And there is a lot of, we have a lot of controversy and we\nhave a lot of people who have courage to examine the past and to look at the past\nand to say this is where we went wrong or this is where we didnt behave\nappropriately. And one of the things that has been so missing in Europe has been\nthat honest self-examination. And, and you even know it, you go to the museum in\nParis, the war museum and the, the, the kind of sickening chauvinism of the French\nAnita Frank 95\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 95\nis just enough to, to appall anybody. And that is a, if you look at their museum, it\u2019s\nas if Charles de Gaulle(ph) won the war. There is absolutely nothing about French\ntreachery. There's nothing about French cooperation with the Nazis. There's\nnothing about the police\u2019s happy cooperation, rounding of the Jews and betraying\nJews, there is nothing of that in France. Only now are they coming to terms with it.\nIn Holland also, Holland is better. It's now beginning to examine its past but it\u2019s\ntaken them so long. For the longest time Holland had this, whenever | talked about\nHolland not having been so, such a glorious country during the war, people said\nsurprised, \u201cOh, | thought they were so noble.\u201d Cause Holland fostered that. We\nthe noble Dutch, we resisted the Nazis. Well they didn\u2019t. Some did. Butno whole\npopulation can take credit for the enormous courage of a few and, and so, to me, one\nof the great poisonous, and, and | must admit | think that\u2019s where western Germany\nhas, has done a relatively good job is they have a significant number of people who,\nwho are aware of how vital it's been to examine their past. But overall, it\u2019s taken\nthem a long time, too. And where in eastern Germany, this hasn't happened at all.\nAnd where you see these, these fascist movements rising. You see it in France,\nyou see it in Germany. It\u2019s, it's scary to me. And so, from my perspective that\u2019s\nsomething that we never must stop doing. We need to always reexamine our past.\nWe need to learn from history and we need to be critical of ourselves and we need\nto learn and | applaud this country that, that looks at itself and says, you know what,\nthat stank. That was no good. Many of us, it takes along while to change, but this\nis, this is a country that we had McCarthy, that fascist in the fifties, Joseph McCarthy.\nAnita Frank 96\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 96\nEventually, he was brought down. Eventually, we had people of courage who, who\nbrought him down even while this country was scared. And we need to make sure\nthat we never give rise to other fascists like him who will happily destroy whole people\nbecause of this irrational fear of, then it was Communism, infiltration of the Red\nMenace, and it\u2019s just, it's just dangerous. And so allowing dissent and allowing\ndisagreement and examining ourselves all the time, | think is what\u2019s gonna keep this\ncountry on a reasonably healthy path.",
        "A: Oh, oh you mean in its own history. Oh sure, | mean slavery and the Japanese.\nYes, | mean terrible, terrible things have happened in this country. Without question.\nAnd, and but the critical, it wouldn't, that would be even worse if we didn't\nacknowledge our horrendous mistakes and try to make sure that those things don't\nhappen again. And that doesn't mean that we're not gonna continue to have misery\nand racism because I\u2019m not that optimistic about people to be very honest. I'm just\nnot. But | think that\u2019s where our government needs to take strong stands about\npeople's individual rights and privileges and responsibilities.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s such a interesting question. To be honest, | see no infringement of\nmy rights if there\u2019re gonna be tracers in these fertilizer things. That, as far as I\u2019m\nAnita Frank 97\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 97\nconcerned, is only sensible. And to put taps on phones of suspected terrorists, that\ndoesn't, we can exaggerate those potential dangers. And that's something that\nreally bothers me. You can look at everything and, and make a huge case out of it\nand say what ff, if, if, yes and as a result you can immobilize people to do absolutely\nnothing. And so | think we need to be at all times careful that we, that we preserve\nour liberties but there\u2019s also something like the common good. And we must at all\ntimes weigh the common good against the protection of individual liberties. And |\ndon't think it\u2019s just a one-way street. I, | have a firm commitment to the common\ngood, also, and to my, in my opinion, and that\u2019s why with gun-control, | am so strongly\nfor gun-control. | just, just that, this society is so violent and you see it, you see these\n12 year old killing each other and killing others. It\u2019s just, it's insanity to, to scream\nabout, from my perspective, about everybody\u2019s right to, to bear guns versus the, the\ncommunity\u2019s rights to some, to a sense of safety. So again, a balance never, | see\nthat generally is the answer to most of life\u2019s problems is to find a balance that takes\ninto account both the common and individual rights.",
