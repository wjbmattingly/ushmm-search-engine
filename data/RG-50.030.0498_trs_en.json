        "A: You could feel it, yeah.",
        "Q: You could feel it.",
        "A: You could feel it. And then you saw them, you know, marching, and they came up the steps,\nyou know, with their boots, and stuff, and you could just feel creepy. And they never tried to\nscare us, always tried -- oh, you know, it\u2019s going to be better. But yet she was so worried because\nshe didn\u2019t know where Papa was. So for four weeks we had no idea where he was. Then finally\nsomebody told us that there -- a bunch of men in a basement, someplace in ha -- so then she went\nthere, and she finally saw him.",
        "Q: Still in Vienna?",
        "A: You know, they waved -- still in Vienna -- waving to her, and we knew that he was a smoker,\nso she was worried, you know, he should have -- now we would take away cigarettes, but at that\ntime she was worried that he\u2019d be miserable without his cigarette. But they wouldn\u2019t let her give\nhim the cigarettes. Anyway, and then they took him away. All of a sudden he\u2019s not there. So then\nagain we waited to see where. And he was able to write finally, in fact, I have letters.",
        "Q: You do?",
        "A: Yes, I have letters that he wrote.",

        "A: Yeah. Well, my grandmother, I think she -- we didn\u2019t know what was wrong, but now\nthinking back, I think she had arthritis badly. But they didn\u2019t have anything to give her to make\nher feel better. She was -- but she never complained, she just sat in her chair, tried be warm, and\nI -- warm things on her.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to get papers.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then, I don\u2019t know if anybody told you, but she had to walk out of the house with a pail\nand a brush in case they decided to make her wash the floors in Vienna. Not the floors, the --",
        "Q: Streets.",
        "A: -- the street, you know.",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So how are you surviving in this year? Ho -- who has money and how do you get food?",
        "A: Well, first of all, my father had his parents still alive, which, you know, we were -- went there\ntoo, to see them, and they were, you know. And he had two brothers. Two brothers and two\nsisters. There were five of them. So there was family on that side. Only my mother\u2019s side there\nwasn\u2019t much family. So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",

        "Q: So everybody -- you must have felt as a child, a -- a -- a lot of the nerves of everybody.\nEverybody must have been --",
        "A: Yes, yes, and -- and yet, they were so trying to protect us that they didn\u2019t tell us half of the\nthings what was going on. You know, nowadays, say you have to be honest with children, well, I\nguess they were brought up differently.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Children -- like 1-1f someone died, the children never knew the person died.",
        "Q: They just went away.",
        "A: Just went away. I don\u2019t know why, but that\u2019s --",
        "Q: Do you think that was a bad thing? Do you think they should have told you more?",
        "A: No, I think I really appreciated that they didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I really did.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I really did. And we left -- Mother got some papers, so -- for him to get out of the camp, but\nwe were able to take him out, but if he wouldn\u2019t leave in 24 hours, Vienna, they take you back\nand that\u2019s it, that -- you only had one chance. So thank God, she got papers, spend a lot of\nmoney, whatever she had on them, and they weren't worth anything.",
        "Q: The papers were not worth anything?",
        "A: Worth anything. And just on time, Italy opened up, all you needed was a passport, you could\ngo to Italy, so -- which was a blessing, because whatever she had, Uruguay, Paraguay, I don\u2019t\nknow where all the papers were, but you couldn\u2019t travel with them.",
        "Q: You mean, so she had papers for him to go out of the country?",
        "A: Out of the country.",
        "Q: But those papers were worthless --",
        "A: Worth -- worthless.",
        "Q: -- she paid money for nothing.",
        "A: Exactly. With a lot of harassment when -- while she was trying to get them. And I know that\nwas so sad, because sometimes she rushed to be first, you know, to get there, and if you were\nfirst, then they put you at the end of the line. You know, they did -- tried anything to give you a\nhard time. So sometimes she came home crying.",
        "Q: Yeah. So that must have been very tough for you.",
        "A: So -- but she, you know, she did everything she could. So we got -- she got the passport from\nPapa, and then he didn\u2019t have a picture, so quickly when he gonna came out, he took a picture,\nand that\u2019s all the passport needed. And you can see his face is swollen like that. They gave him\ncertain things that swelled the people up, especially the ones that they let out, to show that he 1s -",
        "Q: That he\u2019s okay.",
        "A: That he is okay. But it was not a healthy look he had, you know? So --",
        "Q: Did he -- did he return to Vienna before he went to Milan?",
        "A: Yes, he came --",
        "Q: He did, so did you see him for that day?",
        "A: Yes, yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: Was that a great day for you?",
        "A: The best.",
        "Q: It was the best. So you missed him a lot, didn\u2019t you? Yeah.",
        "A: I went to the -- to the sta -- train station to get him. And a lot of them were [indecipherable]\nright in, he wasn\u2019t there yet, but he came [indecipherable]. That was the best sight.",
        "Q: And -- and did you --",
        "A: And then we had to tell him, you know, that he has to get out.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So Milan, that was the closest, you know, to Italy that he could go. But we were so lucky that\nthey let us in, just with the passport. And then he got there, and he -- I don\u2019t know, he must have\nwritten, or I guess just a letter saying that -- we said we would follow him, your mother said that\nshe would follow him with me and my brother. And he wrote, don\u2019t come yet, because I cannot\nfind work, and I don\u2019t speak the language. Obviously. And Mom wrote him back, don\u2019t write\nany more. We\u2019re coming this and this time, wait for us at the station, at the railroad station in\nMilan. And that\u2019s what she did, and that\u2019s how she saved our life.",
        "Q: By not paying attention to him.",
        "A: See, he was still so stupid -- excuse me, Dad -- after going through what he went through, he\nstill didn\u2019t believe that they would touch children and old people. He didn\u2019t believe that. Or\nwomen.",
        "Q: It was just the men.",
        "A: He thought just the men. And then he would leave us alone, but obviously, as we know later,\nthey didn\u2019t leave anybody alone.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he figured that we should stay safely at home, rather than going into the -- how would you\nsay, into the world without knowing where we\u2019re going, okay? But Mom was smart enough to --\nand we wanted to take, you know, the grandparents, to follow us even, and his brother. One got\nout to England, the youngest one. The older one had a wife and a baby, cutest baby. And no, he\nhad -- she had a father, and he had the parents he wouldn\u2019t leave, you know, and he still had a\nsister. They didn\u2019t believe.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t believe.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t believe, because they, you know, they took them all, after. I -- I finally went to\nVienna, I made one trip to Vienna, after 35 years, 40 years, I\u2019m not sure. And I asked if they\nknow what happened to my family, grandparents.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So then they wrote me with a list of what camp they were taken to. Camps that I never heard\nof. But they said there was nothing unusual because they had like 250 camps. You know, you\nonly knew about the big ones --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- like Dachau, Buchenwald, Auschwitz, and Bergen-Belsen, all those. But the little ones you\ndidn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Yeah, there were hundreds of them.",
        "A: Hundreds of, yes. And they wrote me, you know, where they were killed, and wa -- they even\nhad written down what day they wer -- died. They don\u2019t say killed, the day they were died. Some\nof them I think they had wrong names, but I had an idea of, you know, when it happened.",
        "Q: So, who did travel with you besides your -- your -- or you went, you -- they didn\u2019t travel with\nyou, but --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- you and your mother and --",

        "A: In Milan, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And did your grandparents come, or not?",

        "A: Just the four of us. Nobody else made it out. Nobody else made it out.",
        "Q: And you took a train to Milan from Vienna?",
        "A: Yeah, we took a train. And we got very nervous c-crossing, you know the -- the border, cause\nyou never know --",

        "Q: Was your mother able to take out any money, do you know?",
        "A: Not much.",
        "Q: Not much.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have much.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we were afraid to take any possessions because we didn\u2019t trust them, you know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] in the border. So we just took like we were -- we wanted to take -- the\nwarm blankets like they had in Austri --",

        "Q: A down?",
        "A: A down.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, we all had down, and Mother wanted to take for us. And then my brother says,\ndon\u2019t take it, don\u2019t take it. He was afraid, you know. So then later, while we still were able to\nconverse with them in Vienna, my aunt decided she\u2019s gonna s-send one to us.",
        "Q: You --",
        "A: Never got that.",
        "Q: -- never got that.",
        "A: Never got that. But I know she did. And none of the jewelry or anything.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t take anything. My mother\u2019s, you know, just wedding ring. I had a charm bracelet,\nyou know, which I was so fond of, but we had a feeling like maybe my aunt put it in the quilt,\nbecause she knew that I liked it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But maybe that\u2019s when they found that, they just took everything away.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You just never knew what they were -- and I forgot to tell you that in the morning they came\nto pick up my father. If he wasn\u2019t gone --",
        "Q: They would have picked him up.",
        "A: They would have picked him up, yeah. They would have taken him. W-We could hear it on\nthe steps, too, you know, they were --",
        "Q: The boots? The shoes?",
        "A: Yeah, the boots, coming up the steps and knocking on the door like crazy. And my poor\ngrandmother was so, you know, scared. But --",
        "Q: So they came to your grandmother\u2019s house?",
        "A: They came to my grandmother\u2019s house, because Mother, you know, was with us more than\nshe was -- she gave up the apartment.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But what\u2019s the use, you know, to pay rent there, and you know, not be there.",

        "Q: And her passport.",
        "A: And her pa -- she didn\u2019t have a passport then.",
        "Q: She only had the passport when you were leaving?",
        "A: For Papa, yeah. For Father. That was the important one.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah, that he got away.",
        "Q: When you were on the train, do you remember feeling scared?",
        "A: Yes. Til we crossed the border [indecipherable] to border. One of the -- one of the borders\nwhich was very tense. When they come in -- they really scare you when they walk in, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They were so scary looking. Well, they let us go, and that\u2019s the main thing. My brother, I\nthink, was more scared than me, even. Maybe cause he was older, he was smarter to be scared\nthan me. So he was really nervous when they got --",
        "Q: Were you in a compartment in the train?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Alone? Or were there other people there?",
        "A: No, other people.",
        "Q: There were other people?",
        "A: Other people, yeah, other people.",

        "A: I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: So there was no",
        "A: Maybe they knew, but they didn\u2019t -- Mother didn\u2019t tell me.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t tell you.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Were you holding onto your mother a lot?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. I was just sitting scared, too scared.",
        "Q: Did you feel, at that age, closer to your father than your mother, in some way?",
        "A: I felt closer -- no, I felt pretty protected by Mom, but I felt closer to Dad, because they took\nhim.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know? I was worried about him.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: So you had a lot of protective instincts, didn\u2019t you, as a kid? Interesting at such a young age,\nto be like that.",
        "A: I worried about him. Whew. But thank God --",
        "Q: He was okay.",
        "A: -- he came out. There was -- and you know, my father never talked about.",
        "Q: Never? Did you want him to?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t really want him to, not at that young age. Maybe later on I would have liked to know\ncertain things. But I tell you why he didn\u2019t. He felt insulted by the situation, you know? He felt\nso degraded. He didn\u2019t think that he was deserving of such a thing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, no. Was strange, but he never talked about it. The only\nthing 1s, you know, when they -- in the street when they were walking, and they met someone\nfrom -- they used to say K. Z., K. Z. lager, and they knew each other, and then they called my\nfather\u2019s name, it was like this, you know, he was jumping. So it was always a hard thing when he\n-- when he met someone in the street and they called his name, he was like an attention. And was\nso sad to see that.",
        "Q: And this was happening in Italy?",
        "A: It was happening in Italy.",
        "Q: We have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Evelyn, do you remember arriving in Milan?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Remember getting off the train?",
        "A: Train? Yes, because my dad was there.",

        "A: It was happiness.",
        "Q: Did -- did you and your mother s -- and your brother study a little bit of Italian before you\nleft?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No. How long --",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have time.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea how long it was between when your father got there, and when you got\nthere?",
        "A: I would say maybe a couple of weeks.",
        "Q: That\u2019s all?",
        "A: Yes, we rushed. I think. It might have been longer, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So you think you got there 1939?",
        "A: 1939 -- end of \u201939, I guess. I have to look it up.",
        "Q: You have to look.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure. Let me see. I don\u2019t even know if it says here. Think there were some dates here.\nThere\u2019s -- maybe here. Okay. 1930 -- 1940 was already.",
        "Q: 1940? So it was after the war started? After the attack on Poland.",
        "A: Escape from Vienna. Yeah, must -- must have been the end of 1939, \u201940.",
        "Q: \u201940, something like that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. So where did you live when you were -- after you we --",
        "A: Well, he had an apartment.",
        "Q: He did?",
        "A: Yeah, with one -- one room, you know, just one room. And I don\u2019t have a big memory of\nMilan at all.",
        "Q: Were you there for very -- you weren\u2019t there for very long, were you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think very long, no. But a few weeks, quite a few weeks.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t have a very good memory of that. I remember being there, not knowing -- and I\nremember coming down stair -- steps, and whoever was there, the landlady or whatever you call\nher, tried to teach me to say, you know, good morning, good evening. And then I tried to\nremember which was morning, which was evening, you know. That was kind of hard, you know,\nto learn all of a sudden, a language.",
        "Q: So what\u2019s good morning in Italian?",
        "A: Buon giorno.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s good evening?",
        "A: Buona sera.",
        "Q: So you eventually learned, didn\u2019t you?",
        "A: Yes, I did learn. My favorite language.",
        "Q: Is it?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a beautiful language.",
        "A: Yes, I think so.",
        "Q: Your father didn\u2019t have work when you were there?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How did he get an apartment, do you know?",
        "A: I guess with the little money that he took with him, you know. But then we had to leave\nMilan, then someone talked us into going to France, that we could be saved in France. So we\nwent to Italian city, Ventimiglia, which was on the border of someplace. And over there there\nwere people that were leaders, to take you over to France, through mountains and woods, you\nknow? But they needed money, you know, they wanted money, they did it for money.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we stayed there for awhile, and waited for the right people to come to take us. And some\npeople came back. I remember that so clearly, they couldn\u2019t get them across. And here comes\nthis young woman, we were sitting and having lunch. We had like, I remember, a lunch -- you\nknow, lunch is the big meal in Europe, just one, either one minestr -- minestrone, you know, the\nvegetable soup.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Which filled you up and it was good. And that\u2019s all we could afford, you know, just have this\nplate of soup, or -- I didn\u2019t get used to spaghettis yet, you know, I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t eat the spaghettis. The only one between the four of us, my mom. She\nliked them right away. But we didn\u2019t, so we had the soup. And we\u2019re sitting in the restaurant, and\nhe -- here comes this young woman, scratched from top to bottom, just scratches on her. And she\nstands by the door, like out of her mind, and she pees in front of everybody, just standing there\non the door. She lost her mind. She absolutely lost her mind trying to get up, you know, the\nmountains, and they had so many thorns there that wherever they were going, it just scratched\nthe hell out of her, you know? And mu -- she must have gone through such a terrible thing that\nshe just didn\u2019t know what she was doing. She was crying, just crying. And I told my parents,\n\u201cWe have to go through that? That\u2019s terrible.\u201d So Mother said, \u201cYeah, but we already gave them\nall our money, you know, we have to go. We don\u2019t have anything left.\u201d But then some word\ncame that it\u2019s over. They\u2019re not going any more to France. So we didn\u2019t have money, we didn\u2019t\nhave a ride, we didn\u2019t have anything. So we went to the -- to the station, to the railroad station to\nget out of Ventimiglia. And somehow, I guess -- I don\u2019t know if the Jewish emi -- Jewish people\nhelped, or who helped, I don\u2019t know. But they got us -- we were able to get on the train to\nGenoa, okay? So we got on the train -- we got on the train and my dad, he is -- was such a good\nperson, he was the leader. He had a little more, you know, brain than some of the people, so he\nwas the leader and he got everybody on the train, and he was left behind.",
        "Q: You were on the train, and he was not on the train?",
        "A: Do you I have to tell you more? Did this get -- did I get hysteric -- you darn right I got\nhysterical. And they had soldiers on the train, they were all trying to comfort me, I don\u2019t know --\ndidn\u2019t understand what they were saying to me, you know. But I know they were nice to me.\nYou know, the Italian? And they tried to calm me down. And the -- I don\u2019t know what you call\nthe guy that was running -- not running the train, but the people that are on the train, don\u2019t worry,\ndon\u2019t worry, because next stop -- he tried to explain to me the next stop, they gonna put him on\nthe next train and we just have to wait. But that was 100 years we waited. You know? We had\njust gotten him, and now to lost him again, it was horrible.",
        "Q: So did they hold your train? They would --",
        "A: No, they -- we -- we got to Genoa and just waited at the station --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- for the next train.",
        "Q: The next train.",
        "A: Til he finally got out.",
        "Q: Got out.",
        "A: So then, we were in Genoa, where do we go? You know, what do we do?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So there was a piazza, you know, in Italy, they have a lot of piazzas, and there was a piazza\nChristopher Columbus. And that\u2019s where we wanted to go because we felt closer to America,\nbeing --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- Columbus was there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So we went on that piazza.",
        "Q: Now this is after your dad comes?",
        "A: After my dad, sure --",
        "Q: You wait --",
        "A: -- we waited",
        "Q: -- you\u2019re waiting for him.",
        "A: -- oh yeah --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- oh yeah. And then we needed something, we hadn\u2019t eaten a long time, too, and they had\nlike milk, you know, they sell milk, warm milk in Italy, big -- big cups, like a bowl more. And\nwe had some of that with some bread in that, you know, which was any thing inexpensive that\nwe could get. And so we had a bite of that, what did we do now? So then the Italian government\ngave us a Subsidy.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: They did, yes, they did give us some money. I don\u2019t know exactly how many liras, but it\nhelped -- helped us, you know? And then we got into an apartment. They helped us to get into an\napartment. I am saying apartment, I\u2019m -- it\u2019s a room, we got a room with pens -- a penzione.\nPenzione. Fact, I got some pictures from that, too. And -- and we got one big room, and it was\nlike below the level of the street, but we didn\u2019t care, you know, as long as we were together, and\n-- in fact, we snuck in some people that were, you know, needy, didn\u2019t know where to go, so we\n-- they slept with us on the floor, whatever. We snuck them in at night. I remember that. Of\ncourse, Mother never told us that we were sneaking them in, but I think we were smart enough to\nknow.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t pay us, you know, they didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Did this room have furniture?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It did?",
        "A: It had beds, and closet, and --",
        "Q: Now, ho-how were you and your brother -- are you just good kids?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You know that the situation --",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. We were good kids, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They never had trouble with us, no.",
        "Q: Unless you got separated.",
        "A: We never wanted to get separated --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- no, we stuck together like glue. So -- and then -- then came the order. I don\u2019t know why,\nthat we had to leave Genoa, but the men had to be separated from the women and children.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something before we go to that. How -- about how long are you in Genoa?",
        "A: I would say --",
        "Q: Is it a few months? You could check.",
        "A: Well, actually, my brother was Bar Mitzvah\u2019d in Genoa.",
        "Q: He was?",
        "A: He was. He was 13 then. He was barmit -- okay, let\u2019s see.",
        "Q: You\u2019re eight or nine years old --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: Eight or nine.",
        "Q: So he\u2019s 13.",
        "A: Yeah, he\u2019s 13, and I is -- again skipped something. While we were in Genoa, the Jewish\ncommunity sent the children -- the Jewi -- Italian people were taking in children to feed them\nlunch, you know, lunch is the big meal. They were giving us lunch. But I -- to this day I don\u2019t\nunderstand why they separated my brother and I. I went to one family and he went to a different\nfamily to eat lunch. And it was very scary because there were already sirens going on, you know,\nthe war was already beginning, or I don\u2019t know what it was, but I had to walk quite a way to get\nto this -- was a woman that was -- her name was Celestina Weiss. And I remember her name.",
        "Q: Celestina Weiss.",
        "A: Celestina Weiss. And she prepared lunch for -- not she, she had a -- a woman there who was\ncooking lunch for us, just the two of us.",
        "Q: Just the two of you?",
        "A: Just the two of --",
        "Q: You were the only kid?",
        "A: Yeah. Why couldn\u2019t my brother be there with me, you know? So we would have walked\ntogether, I wouldn\u2019t have to be so scared to walk by myself when the sirens came, and then the\nha -- in Genoa they have large tunnels. So I rushed like crazy into the tunnel, cause that was like\nprotection from the bombs.",
        "Q: Was their air raids?",
        "A: Air raid --",
        "Q: There were air raids, weren\u2019t there?",
        "A: Air raids, yeah. And you know, nobody would let you in once the air raids, so I\u2019m running\ninto those tunnels like crazy, til it\u2019s over. But I\u2019m by myself, I\u2019m a little kid by myself, you\nknow?",
        "Q: So how come your mother or your father didn\u2019t walk with you, do you think?",
        "A: They were not supposed to.",
        "Q: They weren\u2019t supposed to.",
        "A: No. I came -- I think when I -- they had a little bit of schooling at the synagogue in Genoa, so\nfrom the school I had to go to the -- to it. And that there was so much left over, and I was\nthinking, why don\u2019t she give it to me for my parents, but you know, I -- I was -- I couldn\u2019t -- you\nknow, I was not brought up that way, to say anything.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I was just thankful for the meal. And my brother went to a different family, who was also\nvery nice to him, but only him. And then when the Bar Mitzvah was, we went all to the\nsynagogue there, and this family that was feeding my brother, they send us to -- they made\nreservations in a restaurant to -- you know, to celebrate his Bar Mitzvah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know they -- nobody came with us, just four of us. Now I\u2019m thinking why? Why would\nnot one of the parents, or -- I don\u2019t understand that.",
        "Q: You mean no -- the -- one of -- the -- the parents where he was going --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- didn\u2019t come?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Just you --",
        "A: They made reservation for the four of us to eat in a restaurant together, finally we were\ntogether in the meal.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You know, I --",
        "Q: But nobody else.",
        "A: But nobody else. Can you figure that one out? No. But that was war, I guess, and people were\nStrange.",
        "Q: Now the woman where you were eating lunch, did you -- did she talk with you? Di -- was it\nnice --",
        "A: Yeah, she was nice.",
        "Q: -- she was a nice person?",
        "A: Very nice.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Very nice.",
        "Q: And a lot of families were doing this for the Jewish --",
        "A: And you could see the richness in her house.",

        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: So you know, tragedies like that happen. They were such a nice couple. I just loved them.\nAnd they had a lot of -- in Ferramonti they had a lot of wild dogs. See, the dogs came, and it was\nso hot that they were a little wild, cause the heat and no food. And they came, and this couple\nwere hiding a dog that they got attached to. But then came the order that all the dogs had to be\nkilled. And I remember them sitting and just crying, you know. And still holding on and thinking\nanother day, another day. They tried to keep that dog just as long as they could. But then they\nwere searching room by room, you know, for the dog, because they said the dogs got mad, you\nknow, like from the heat, and from -- by the hundreds they came to Ferramonti, because we were\n-- we were feeding them, I guess, and they came, but not enough, so they -- they were dangerous,\nthey said. So you could just hear fire them -- firing.",

        "A: They made us go there.",
        "Q: They made you leave. Did everybody --",
        "A: Because we wanted to be together with my dad, and we requested to go either to him or he\ncome to us.",

        "A: Oh. We had to leave because they\u2019re gonna close the camp.",
        "Q: They were going to close it?",
        "A: Yeah, they going to close out the camp, cause of sickness, I think, and I don\u2019t know, they\nwere gonna close it. So we had a choice where to go, you know in Italy, always in Italy. So we\ndidn't want to stay too far down, and we didn\u2019t -- my dad didn\u2019t want to go to close to Germany -",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Up too high.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: See? So we chose like in the middle, like in Toscana, there. So they came up then, when we\nsaid the middle, that\u2019s what they came up with, Grosseto.",
        "Q: Grosseto.",
        "A: Which was the big city, and we went to Pari, which was the town where we went.",

        "A: It\u2019s a province of Grosseto.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And when we arrived on a bus, that I remember, we were on a bus. We got off the bus, and\nthe Italian knew the children, the Jews are coming. So they looked at us, and then a few of them\ncame to touch us, I swear to you, to touch us. And then they said, you feel just like we do. You\nknow, you don\u2019t feel any different. You know, because they heard on the radio so much from\nHitler that we are such different people, beasts or whatever. So we have to feel different. Well,\nthey didn\u2019t see that. So they got very affectionate with us, and we became friends with the people\nin -- in the town, and my dad and my brother started to work in the fields, to make, you know,\nsome money, or even for trading for food.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they worked very hard, they worked so hard, they had to -- you know, they got jobs, wa -\n- but nobody really wanted, I mean, they were doing it, but as long as they had someone else to\ndo it -- like to build trenches for the grapes, you know, you had [indecipherable] but they were\nfull of stone and rock, and with that thing that they were knocking, you know. I mean, their\nhands were just a mess, everything was a mess. And -- but you know, they tried their best to go\ndo it, and they did their job. And then came summer, so they worked in the fields again to cut\nweed, you know, cut the weed. Why do I remember that? Because in the biggest heat, we had to\ngo and bring them lunch, okay? Mom cooked, and I had to go and take it to them in a basket, you\nknow, the hot food. I don\u2019t know why you needed hot food, it\u2019s hot like hell. Excuse me. And\nthat was the rule, they had to have lunch. And I hated to walk there, it was so hot. Didn\u2019t have\nthe best shoes, you know, to walk, but I did, and I brought them food there. And whenever I\ndidn\u2019t have to, I was very happy. Sometimes my mom went, you know, which was even harder\nfor her. I was -- I was a little spoiled rotten kid, I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I did. And --",
        "Q: You were a spoiled rotten kid? You don\u2019t sound like -- you didn\u2019t sound like one before, all\nof a sudden?",
        "A: I know, all of a sudden I\u2019m a spoiled rotten --",
        "Q: Did people tell you you were spoiled?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. But you really felt --",
        "A: I was not spoiled.",
        "Q: You weren't spoiled.",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t. And then --",
        "Q: Where were you living in Pari?",
        "A: Pari? Yeah -- 1-1n a house, we were living 1n a house. Trying to think. The f -- when we first\ngot there, we lived in a house with -- we each a room, but we lived with another family for the\nkitchen -- we shared the kitchen. But we had the room, but that didn\u2019t work out too good, and\nthen something opened up that we were able to move into a house. The only good thing was that\nhouse had a bathroom, while this house did not have a bathroom, which was nothing unusual not\nto have a bathroom. And -- but there was a sta -- sta -- a stalla -- stall where the -- where the\nCOWS Were going in.",
        "Q: A barn?",
        "A: A barn.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Under the house that was, like. So we had to go there to go to the bathroom, with the --",

        "A: Yeah -- no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, was just there.",
        "Q: Just there.",
        "A: Yeah, very, very embarrassing to me, I --I was very upset about it. And anyway, was not easy.\nSo we lived there in that house, and in -- in that town you had to -- you baked your own bread,\nokay? I went to work. I went to work. I started to sew with different dressmakers, they taught me\nhow. Okay, I went to a dressmak -- I couldn\u2019t go to school, we were not allowed to go to school.\nAnd my ma --",
        "Q: Because you were Jews?",
        "A: Because we were Jews. And my mother knew that I like, you know, to work with my hands,\nso she says, how about if you would -- so they accepted me, you know, the dressmakers, and I\nstarted to work for different dressmaker, you know, whenever one needed me, I went there and I\nworked, and I learned, too, you know, while I work. They tried to teach me, and -- ironing, you\nknow, whatever needed to be done. Sf -- finishing -- first it was finishing work, which now\ndoesn\u2019t exist, finishing, the machine finish it. But 1t was all done by hand, you know, finishing,\nand then I made garments, slowly, you know.",
        "Q: And do you remember if this is 1942 - 1943? So are you, 12 years old, you\u2019re 13 years old?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You're 12.",
        "A: Going on 11, maybe.",
        "Q: You think it was \u201942?",
        "A: 11, yeah. Something like that. Because then I went into the woods, so I know. But --",
        "Q: So you\u2019re going every day to this work? Five days a week?",
        "A: I go every day to this work, and what was bad, we didn\u2019t have much food in the house,\nbecause the Italian people, as wonderful as they are, they were stingy with giving you food,\nokay? Cause they tried to horde whatever they could. So, many times my mother and I walked\nmiles to see by the farmers what they -- what we could get. Like we went -- you\u2019re familiar with\nricotta cheese?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They -- wonderful ricotta cheese. Sometimes we had luck that they gave us some. May -- we\nwere ready to pay, we didn\u2019t want for nothing. And sometimes they said they don\u2019t have, or --\nusually at noon they were all, the farmers sitting on a big table having a feast. And we say could\nwe have -- I don\u2019t know, some jelly, some whatever. Oh, we\u2019re just out of it today. You know. I\nwas so hungry, I walked so much, you know. And they just -- some didn\u2019t want to give. Some\ndidn\u2019t want to give. And some made me a sandwich, maybe, and gave it to me. But they were not\n-- the farmers were not that generous. They were more generous, my friends in the ci -- in the\ntown, than the farmers were. Like a potato in one, and something, you know. And I think to this\nday I hate the walking, because I walked so much for nothing, you know. Anyway, it\u2019s a good\nexcuse. And so then -- yeah, we -- I was sewing, and I enjoyed it, different -- yeah, I know what I\nwanted to say. And they always had midday, in the morning, the kids all had something to eat,\nthey brought there stuff to eat. Well, I didn\u2019t always have, you know, so I just walked out,\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to see, and yet I was hungry, you know, children. So once in awhile they\nwould give me something, and -- but most of the time not. And then in the afternoon was the\nsame thing. They were eating in the afternoon. And I had just enough for lunch, I didn\u2019t have\nleftover from. So I was hungry, I was always hungry. But they just didn\u2019t give, you know, so --\none day I was so hungry, and I looked every place in the house for something to eat, and all I\ncould find was an onion, a small onion. And I bit into it like I don\u2019t know what. And I just ate the\nlast thing in the house, that day, you know, the next day we got again something, but just to tell\nyou how hungry I was.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, children get so hungry. So I was young. Like to say, I wasn\u2019t even 11 yet, I don\u2019t\nthink. Yeah, I was 11 while I was in the woods, so [indecipherable |",
        "Q: So this was earlier.",
        "A: Yeah. I remember because of -- got my period in the woods.",
        "Q: In the woods, yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I remember that I -- my age. Which was another terrible thing. But anyway,\nbefore I get into the woods, how did we get int -- to the woods? You had to do your own bread,\nokay? Now, you made the bread, and there was one bakery in town, where you call them in the\nevening and you say, I\u2019m making bread, so they come and pick it up and put it in the oven. So\nmy mother called in, went to them that she is making bread. So she says, okay, I'll be there to get\nit in the morning. So they made the bread, and then next thing you know, somebody comes to tell\nus, you better leave right now, cause five o\u2019clock in the morning the Germans are going to be\nhere to pick you up. We don\u2019t have bread, you know, obviously, and one of our Italian friends\ngave us a bread, you know, to take, and my cat, my Muschi, she wanted -- you know, we had to\nleave her, so I left her with a friend. And it was pouring rain. I had open shoes, but that\u2019s all I\nhad, you know. So anyway, we said okay, let\u2019s go. There was two more families there with --\nactually three. Two of them in a different direction -- there was a couple -- like my brother said,\nsomebody Russian. There was a Russian man, Russian Jew. He was married to a Gentile German\nlady, who stuck with him. They were like so tall, and especially I was so little, I thought they\nwere two giant. But they were tall. And they went one way with another couple who had two\nboys from Vienna, they were from Vienna. And we went with a couple with two children. Small\n-- little smaller than me, a boy and a girl, so there\u2019s -- they came with us, in the same place. So\nwe kept on walking and walking and walking, and all of a sudden we were ready to enter the\nwoods, and I hear a cat. My cat followed me into the woods. I don\u2019t know how she got out. And,\nyou know, cats don\u2019t like wet, don\u2019t like rain, she came right in the rain with us. So, of course,\nwith everything else, I had the cat, so I picked her up, I don\u2019t care, you know, I picked her up\nbecause I felt sorry for her. But later on you will see, the cat li -- saved our life. So anyway, I\npick up the cat, and we go into the woods. We have no place to stay, and it\u2019s raining. We had\nlike a tarp, and we put on the floor, and -- to sit on, you know, and it was -- we didn't have much\nfood, the -- these friends gave us some bread, and I don\u2019t know, maybe a piece of cheese, I don\u2019t\nremember what she gave us. But whatever she wa -- she gave us, was wonderful. So in the\nmorning, then we heard later, this woman comes. \u201cMia,\u201d that was my mother, \u201ca far il pane.\u201d\nMake bread. Because she gives you the signal when to make the bread, and then she comes and\npicks it up. Well, Mia\u2019s not answering, and she cannot understand, so she is knocking, and no -- I\n-- that\u2019s what they told us later, she\u2019s knocking and knocking and she runs up, she sees\nsomething is wrong, and she finds we\u2019re gone. And 10 minutes later the Germans were there to\npick us up. And nobody knew, you know, what happened to us. And this woman says she called\nto make bread, that\u2019s impossible, they have to be here. Well, somebody saved our life.",
        "Q: Do you know who that was?",
        "A: Later on we found out who it was. It was a bishop from Grosseto, a bishop that called, I guess\nthe priest of the town, I don\u2019t know who exactly, but he left word for us to leave. So he must\nhave been, you know -- heard or whatever. And boy was he right, you know? He just saved all\nour lives.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And we went into the woods, and there was only a couple of people that knew where we were\ngoing, what woods, because there lots of woods. And eventually, while we were there, they\nbrought us some bread, or something, you know.",
        "Q: From the town? From Pari?",
        "A: From the town, from Pari, yes.",
        "Q: So how did -- how did people find out in Pari, where you were? Did someone go back and tell\nthem?",
        "A: Not -- not people, certain people.",
        "Q: Certain people.",
        "A: Certain people. Certain people -- there was one guy, he would have given his life if somebody\nwould have told him where we are, you know?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: A Fascist, a real Fascist. But they knew it, and nobody told him where we are. And -- and in\nthose mountains we had people that made coal, carbonia, a -- well, they were coal. And they\nknew us, and they wanted to keep us safe, you know. And once in awhile they gave us, if they\nhad leftover bread or something, they gave us. And then one day they\u2019re sitting around, and here\ncomes the Fascist, and they knew, you know, the Fascist. So they\u2019re talking to him, which I\nheard later, and one of the guys is just there with one of those things that you chop wood with,\nyou know?",
        "Q: An axe?",
        "A: An axe. And just talked to him, and just does that with the axe, you know, so he got the\npicture that if you talk, or if you don\u2019t behave -- do you know where these Jews are? You know,\nhe was asking. I would like to give them, you know, bring them some food or something. And he\nsaid we have no idea where they are, and he was going, you know -- so you know, we had close\ncalls, very close calls. But nobody spoke, nobody gave us away, where we are. Now --",
        "Q: Now, these were Germans who were coming after you.",
        "A: No, no --",
        "Q: Not Italian.",
        "A: -- Italian.",
        "Q: There\u2019s --",
        "A: Oh, the Germans were going to come and pick us up --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- yes, yes.",
        "Q: But this Fascist is a --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- is an Italian.",
        "A: An Italian, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. And he would have given anything if he could have caught -- catch us. I don\u2019t know\nwhy, we didn\u2019t do anything to him, but it was a Fascist, a -- we didn\u2019t do anything to the Nazis\neither, but they did to us. So anyway, nobody spoke, and then we had a very hard time. Finally,\nthey helped us build a shack, just to have a little, you know, protection from the weather. And it\nwas like from the trees, the branches, made from branches, cause these people knew how to do\nthat, and they helped us, the people that -- the coal miners. And then you had to take from the\nearth, and you know, fill in, and then they made like beds from th -- from the branches, and then\nput straw on it, you know, to lay on it, but a -- small. And we were trying to be close. And one\nturned, the other one had to turn, you know what I mean? It was so hard, because you know,\nbranches are not -- nothing is smooth, and the straw was falling right through. Anyway --",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t such a great situ --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a great situation, but 1t was a little bit -- you know, we were real prepared for the bad\nweather, because it was snowing, too. And you had to whisper the whole time, cause in the\nwoods your voice carries, far away, you know?",
        "Q: So what are you ins -- excuse me --",
        "A: Inside --",
        "Q: -- inside the woods, o -- and --",
        "A: -- in this thing, and the first night, in fact, the thing, the roof fell in, so all the men -- the two\nmen and my brother and the other boy, all night had to sit with something to hold it up, you\nknow, the roof up. We couldn\u2019t make much of a fire because we didn\u2019t want anybody to see the\nsmoke. During the day was completely a no-no with the fire, but in the night we tried to do little\nbit open fire to keep a little warm, you know? And we still had the cat. And the cat disappeared,\nand I was beside myself, the Germans killed my cat, they took my cat. But she found herself a\nboyfriend.",
        "Q: She found herself a boyfriend?",
        "A: And she came -- she came home pregnant.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. That we didn\u2019t need, believe me. So she came home pregnant and had four little\nkittens.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: So then we got -- we asked this guy that brought us food to leave the -- the cha -- the little\nbasket, so we can put in, you know. And then he had to find us someone to want the little -- after\n-- you know, after awhile, to take them. And she was just marching behind, you know, her\nkittens, when we were moving from place to place, cause we never tried to stay too long in one\nplace. Even when we came to sleep and we always tried to go away from the place, and watch\nwho goes by and --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- you know, we were constantly in fear, constantly. We never knew. And then there were\nbombardments, and we were next to a river, and it sounded -- you know the sound was so harsh,\nor strong. And we thought always, we\u2019re next, you know, they\u2019re gonna bombard us next. But it\ndidn\u2019t happen, but the fear was constant, the fear was constant. And whispering. Then one day,\nthis couple, that Russian couple, she, poor woman, got hysterical, you know, from all of the stuff\ngoing on. I don\u2019t know what she was, but she started to scream. And that\u2019s the worst thing you\ncan do in -- in the woods. So he tried to calm her down and everything, but, you know, she went\nthrough a lot of stress, and she probably was thinking, why am I here? You know, I have no\nreason, but she stuck it out, but she just lost it. And we were -- so we had to move from there\nright away, cause we thought, uh-oh. And another thing what was having, they had a forest fires.\nSo we were worried about that, you know, that\u2019s it\u2019s gonna -- we could feel, you know, the heat\nfrom the fire. So again we were on the run. Constantly on the run, in the woods, in the rain, in the\nheat. And oh, was -- one day it was snowing so hard. And we were without anything. We didn\u2019t\nhave a piece of bread, we didn\u2019t have anything to eat. So we thought, okay we\u2019ll just -- you\nknow, nothing you can do. And here comes this man, this blessed man.",
        "Q: With food. And is this somebody that you knew?",
        "A: He\u2019s the one that a -- that brought us food --",
        "Q: Before.",
        "A: -- before. He was really not from Pari, he was from the big city, he was what they called\nsfolato. When -- when they started to bombard the big cities, they all came to the small town. We\nhad a lot of people from Pisa. In fact, I fell in love with a guy from Pisa. And he was -- but he\nwas from Siena, I think. And he was wonderful, can you believe it? The biggest snow, here\ncomes this man. He says, \u201cI knew you didn\u2019t have.\u201d An angel. Angel.",
        "Q: That\u2019s fabulous. Okay, I have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: What was the name of the man who brought you the food?",
        "A: Dario.",
        "Q: And wa -- was Dario from Pari?",
        "A: Ye -- yeah, he lived in Pari because he was from the city and I think he had some relatives in\nPari, and that\u2019s how he got to Pari.",
        "Q: And how do you think he found you? Do people know, were there --",
        "A: I think -- wait a minute, I think word was sent to him where we are. You see, I -- I had one --\none change of clothes, I didn\u2019t have much, but we had a big oversea case, you know, one of\nthose wooden things that we left at the church. The priest took it in for us. So when we need a\npiece of something, somebody went there and got it, and brought it to us. And this other couple\nthat was with us, was -- this woman there was about my size, only she was taller, she was a\nwoman, I was a child, so -- but that\u2019s besides the point. Anyway, I was -- my skirt was getting --\nnot that I was getting so tall, but still I was growing, and my skirt was getting shorter and shorter.\nSo it was not a good thing, you know? Anyway that\u2019s that. Okay.",
        "Q: Two more questions now, for this -- for this particular part. One 1s, how in heaven\u2019s name did\nyou get a cat in the first place? How did you get Muschi?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s not hard to get a cat in Italy.",
        "Q: No? Lots of cats?",
        "A: No. Lots of cats. And -- and we got her, you know, somebody gave her to me when she was a\nlittle kitten, and you know, it was just perfect. Wherever you went there was a cat, so I had a cat\nof my own, which was great. But we all loved Muschi, everybody loved Muschi, and -- except\nour people that were in the roo -- in the thing with us didn\u2019t like it because she stole some food\nfrom them. But she put it under the be -- under the thing. I mean, they know we have a cat, so\nwhy did they put it under there? Anyway.",
        "Q: And you gave the cat the name of your doll?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Muschi.",
        "Q: What did Muschi look like? Was she a light cat, a dark cat?",
        "A: She was a gray cat with white. She was perfect.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: She was perfect, just beautiful cat. I always promised her I\u2019Il take her to the United States\nwith me. And I would have, had she survived. But see, with all the bombardments and with all\nthe shooting, she went wild.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Sh-She turned wild. I was holding her when we were liberated -- getting ahead of myself, but\nwe were liberate -- I was carrying her because a lot of dogs and other animals came, so I figured\nshe might be afraid. So I h-held her. And then she si -- this dog barked at her and she jumped off\nmy hand and scratched me from here to here, which she never, ever did, from fear, and she went\nback to where we stayed, the farmers told us that they saw her. And that is quite a trip she took\nback, I guess looking for us, poor cat. But she couldn\u2019t -- and we told them, you know, if you\never see her, please, you know, we want her back. But the farmer said they never saw her again.\nShe just kept on looking for us and looking for us, I guess. So I couldn\u2019t keep my promise and\nbring her.",
        "Q: Yeah, couldn\u2019t bring her.",
        "A: Which was very hard.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because as we got into the woods -- I told you that she saved our life --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- cause finally we got away from wherever we were, far away, and there was a farmhouse, an\nempty farmhouse. I don\u2019t know if it was a farmhouse -- anyway, was a -- was a building, okay,\nwhere they stored hay and everything for the animals. And they had a lot of cherry trees around\nthere, so we have, you know, food. And so we went in there, we were two -- by then we were\ntwo couples, you know, the other couple with two children and -- and us. And Muschi was with\nus, and I look at Muschi, and she\u2019s looking in -- in a direction. And I\u2019m following her eyes,\nthere\u2019s four German soldiers coming our way.",
        "Q: And she\u2019s not making a sound --",
        "A: And she\u2019s looking --",
        "Q: -- she\u2019s just looking.",
        "A: -- looking. But I could see the -- where she was looking, thank God she is looking 1n the right\ndirection. And just sat there, you know, and looked. So I told -- you know, everybody, they are\nhere. So the men got out of that building, which was him, his son, and my brother, my father,\nfour of them jumped out of the building, and we didn\u2019t know where they were going, but out.\nAnd we quickly -- I put on a kerchief, you know, I made myself really look like -- all of us like\nfarmers, we\u2019re all farmers. Course we didn\u2019t speak German, you know, or anything. And all of a\nsudden, we hear a gunshot. A gunshot, we didn\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t know if somebody shot us,\nand we didn\u2019t know if someone shot them. So then here they come to the door, the Germans to\nour door. And they say something in German, and we just said [indecipherable] you know, like\nwe don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. But then they say -- one says to the other, you idiot,\nyou didn\u2019t kill the cat. Thank God. They were shooting at the cat, and as they were talking, the\ncat came running inside, see? So we were relieved that they didn\u2019t kill the cat, and thank God\nthey didn\u2019t shoot at the men. But the men didn\u2019t know that yet, okay? So they left. They left. We\nwere not important, they left. They saw there was nothing but hay there, and [indecipherable]. So\nthen, we could hardly wait for the men to see -- so here they come, God, all in one piece, you\nknow, with like -- but we knew we had to leave that place. So what we did, outside that house,\nwe made room for our pictures. We buried the pictures, and my dad knew shorthand, and he\nwrote shorthand every day of our stay in the woods, the whole life he wrote in shorthand. So he\nput that down there, and pictures of ours from family, you know, whatever we had. I don\u2019t think\nthere was money. Whatever -- anyway, we all buried it. And we figure, but -- you know, pretty\ndown deep so it shouldn\u2019t get wet. And we left there, and we went -- you know, inside the woods\na long different direction. And then -- trying to think, you know what happened first, it\u2019s hard to\nremember. Went there, and we buried that, and then -- and then we went on. Which was a big\nmistake, cause we got caught in the middle of shooting, the Germans -- and the French liberated\nus, the French and the Moroccans. And they were shooting at each other, and we were in the\nmiddle. Okay? The French -- we finally saw a Frenchman, and we\u2019re so happy, and he says, go\naway, go away. And we didn\u2019t know why he say -- tell us to go away. You know, you\u2019re so\nstupid sometimes. Anyway, all of a sudden we\u2019re just in the middle of all this fighting going on.\nAnd my poor dad and mom wanted to protect us, so they each laid on us. Dad laid on me, and\nMom laid on my brother, so that things shouldn\u2019t hit us. We laid there for hours. And then\nfinally, it\u2019s kind of stopped, so we kind of thought, let\u2019s go back to the house and get our stuff\nand get out of -- out of here. So when we got to the house, everything was -- they ripped the\npictures, whoever found. See, they thought maybe we had money that we buried. Mut --\nsomebody must have seen us do that, but they thought maybe it was money and when that wasn\u2019t\nmoney, they was mad, so they ripped things, you know. And so my Dad\u2019s -- all that writing\nwent, and we lost a lot of pictures, which we were holding onto like dear life, okay?",
        "Q: You got some pictures back? Some of them were still okay? Nothing?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: Nothing was still okay, everything was torn apart. And yeah, the pictures of grandparents, you\nknow, and the brothers and sisters. So then we went, and all of a sudden -- we got out of the\nhouse, we figured well, you know, we\u2019ll go and see what -- which side we\u2019re gonna go on, we\ndidn\u2019t know where to go. So one of the Moroccans here got -- one of them are on the mule -- on\nthose big mules, and they are up there, and we\u2019re down here. And they point to me, and they\npoint to the other lady, the mother of the other, she was still a younger woman, blonde, you\nknow. And she wants us -- she want -- he wants us to go with him. So we all started to cry, you\nknow? My mother is on her knees, begging. The kids are crying. I mean, it was a scene. And\nwe're trying to think what to give him, he shouldn\u2019t take us, you know? And my mother had the\nwedding ring. So she says here, you want this do -- and there were no -- not much conversation\nbecause they -- they didn\u2019t understand each other, but I think with hands and movements you\ncould tell what we were about. So Mother takes off that, and my brother had a watch, so -- and\ntook off the watch to give to him. He took it. He took it. So we didn\u2019t know, are we safe now, or\nwhat does he want, you know? And he\u2019s still pointing to me and her. And my mother grow\nhysterical, you know? Being liberated and not liberated. So finally there were like some cows\nthere on the field. And somehow he -- he said to us, okay, you can have the cows, or some --\nthat\u2019s how we understood, you know, we don\u2019t know what he said. And they all have gold teeth,\nyou know, and they\u2019re so disgusting, you know, they\u2019re not -- the beards, and oh, horrible\nlooking. Anyway, he left. He left. My mother faints.",
        "Q: Your mother fainted.",
        "A: So we got her, you know, going. Said, we have to leave this place. Then the other lady -- my\nskirt was up to here, you know? So she gave me one of her skirts, which covered me, and a\nblouse with long sleeves. You know, they made me look, you know, unattractive as possible.\nAnd a-again, you know, scarf on the head, anything they could do to make me look bad. So I\nsaid, okay, we are going. And we started to walk towards a town, different town. And we\u2019re\ngoing, and all of a sudden here\u2019s this guy.",
        "Q: Again?",
        "A: The same guy. My poor mom, she passed out again.",
        "Q: She --",
        "A: She passed out again. I thought this time she died. I was sure she\u2019s gone. Anyway, he rode --\nhe rode away.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t say anything?",
        "A: He ro -- he didn\u2019t -- he said something, but don\u2019t ask me what, and he rode away. And we\nrushed to a farmhouse, where we knew partisans usually, you know, met, or I don\u2019t know what\nwe knew. Anyway, we go there, and they have surrounded the -- that room, that house. The\nMoroccans, they surrounded that house, barefoot, you know, they come and sneak up on you. I\nmean, it\u2019s a horrible thing. And we finally opened the door and got in and here are the partisans\ninside. And I am hysterical. And then -- til then I was fine. And when I saw them, I got hi -- I -- I\nreally lost it, I was hysterical crying to them. They were so sweet and so nice. They assured me\neverything will be okay, you know, and stuff like that. Was horrible. So then they left, the -- the\nguys left.",
        "Q: Which ones?",
        "A: The Moroccans --",
        "Q: The Moroccan --",
        "A: -- left. And they kind of helped us to get into a town that was not too far from the woods, and\n-- which we did. In fear every step of the way. We were liberated, and not liberated. You\nunderstand?",
        "Q: Sure, because everything\u2019s 1n chaos.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know if -- if they\u2019re coming back, or if they -- we didn\u2019t know what they were\ngonna do. They could have shot us, they could have -- and they could have shot my parents and\nthen taken us, and you know, we just didn\u2019t know what they were gonna do. Because for 24\nhours the Moroccan had free hand, they can do whatever they want to women. And they did a lot\nof damage. They were very, very rude, very mean. So we were lucky that we -- we got away\nwith that.",
        "Q: Was this something that you understood what your mother was really afraid of, that you\nwould be raped? Did you --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t realize. You knew it wasn\u2019t good.",
        "A: I know it wasn\u2019t good. I know it wasn\u2019t good to go with this guy. And I wouldn\u2019t want to go\nwith this guy, I knew that. Gosh, I knew it. But of course, I didn\u2019t see as much danger as my\nparents did, you know? Oh, it was horrible. And that -- that was our liberation, don\u2019t forget. And\nthen, I could not stand to see a soldier, I was afraid of every soldier I saw.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t matter what soldier --",
        "Q: Who they were, uh-huh.",
        "A: -- they were. I was afraid. We finally stopped in a town where we got a little break and\nwashed up, and some people gave us some food, you know. Was not Pari, was town before Pari,\nbut they helped us, you know? And we walked all the time, just walk and walk and walk.",
        "Q: But were you trying to get to Pari? Is that where you\u2019re trying to go --",
        "A: We tried to get to Pari --",
        "Q: -- you\u2019re trying to get back to Pari?",
        "A: -- Pari, yeah. But I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: Because you know people there, and you know that they would help you.",
        "A: Yeah, and we have our stuff there still, and --",
        "Q: The woods that you were in, was it south of Pari, or east of --",
        "A: It was actually -- was the Siena woods, not Grosseto woods.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: We went into Siena woods. We just kept walking, we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, we just\nkept walking.",
        "Q: And this other couple with the two kids, do they remain with you? Or they left?",
        "A: Yes, they were --",
        "Q: They remained with you.",
        "A: They remained with us all the way through. The -- the Russian, which is why -- they went to a\ndifferent woods. They went somebody else, and the other couple from Vienna, with two boys, I\nunderstand that the Germans too -- found one of the boys. He tried to, you know, talk his way out\nof that he\u2019s from the farm, you know, and I don\u2019t really know whatever happened to them. Lost\ncontact, cause they didn\u2019t come back to Pari, so it was just rumor, we didn\u2019t know exactly --",
        "Q: Exactly, right.",
        "A: -- what happened. And they were sad. In fact, one was Heinz --",
        "Q: Same name.",
        "A: -- one of the boys was Heinz, and one was Walter. The boys, you know. And so I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to them. But we went back to Pari, and then we\u2019re waiting to get to America,\nstill. Again, you know. And then my dad wo -- my brother, they took the bus to Grosseto, to talk\nto the American, you know, for the liberation, whatever. And my dad says they were\ninterrogating him, and my brother -- you did this, ooh, ooh, ooh. And my dad says to my brother,\n\u201cThis idiot thinks we\u2019re spies.\u201d In German.",
        "Q: In German?",
        "A: In German.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But he understood German, so he started to laugh. So, you know. Then we got -- he got some\npapers, and -- that we were okay to go, that we were not spies, by no means. I know I\u2019m leaving\nsomething out, but I can\u2019t think --",
        "Q: Well let me -- let me go back --",
        "A: -- yeah, ask me, ask me question, yeah.",
        "Q: -- I know that you -- let -- when you were in the Siena woods, I know it makes you\nuncomfortable, but it\u2019s really important as a woman --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- to hear about this. You\u2019re a young girl --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and you get your period for the first time in the terrible circumstances.",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "Q: So that taking care of yourself under those circumstances seems almost --",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "Q: -- impossible.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have anything.",

        "Q: Have something, yeah.",
        "A: And they had a river where we went to wash things. But always afraid who is seeing, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I could never really wash myself because I always thought somebody sitting in -- in the tree,\nyou know? And I never felt clean enough, you know. And it was so embarrassing to me, so\nembarrassing, oh.",
        "Q: Did you know about menstruation before it happened, had you been told that this might -- this\nwas going to happen?",
        "A: Not a great deal.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: A little bit I was told, but not in my imagination --",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But -- and always the wrong time. Whe -- when is the right time, you know, but always the\nwrong time. And I was terribly upset with it because I just had a hard time to handle. And the\nother girl that was with us, she was jealous because she wanted. I said you stupid.",
        "Q: She wanted to get it [indecipherable]",
        "A: She wanted to --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- she felt more grown up, I guess. Was almost 12, I guess --",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t have -- we had the little soap, somebody wa -- was shaving soap, you know, with like\na tube. And that was the only soap. It\u2019s a miracle I didn\u2019t have lice because I -- my hair was long,\nyou know.",

        "Q: Maybe it was fortunate that you were outside in that way.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Because maybe the air helped you.",
        "A: Maybe. I did not remember any terrible smell, you know, for some reason.",
        "Q: Now, when you left Ferramonti and went to Pari -- I\u2019m trying to figure out the t -- the -- the\ntime frame when the allies have gone into Italy.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: When you leave Ferramonti, the allies are not there yet.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So Italy is still run by the Italians. So you don\u2019t, in fact --",
        "A: By the Germans, by the Germans.",

        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- they were together in cahoots.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There was one incident when a -- before I -- we left into the woods. Pari was again, you\nknow, round. Up on a hill and round. So I\u2019m there by a friend at the beginning of Pari, and the\nhighway, like the street, you know, were cars, two cars that come, come up the street, and I\u2019m\nstanding there with her and I\u2019m watching the road to see if somebody\u2019s coming. And sure\nenough, four soldiers. They were always walking in four, I don\u2019t know why. Four German\nsoldiers g -- are coming. So I was like -- that was before the woods. I was like stuck to the floor,\nyou know? I didn\u2019t know run back in or run back out or what do I do? So I just stood there, and -\n- and the farmer, they were talking to one of the guys down there, and he goes like this. I feel he\nis pointing at me. So I\u2019m really paralyzed now, but I don\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I\nstayed there and they\u2019re coming up, they\u2019re coming up and they\u2019re asking me where is a bar?",
        "Q: Where\u2019s the barn?",
        "A: Bar.",
        "Q: Oh, bar.",
        "A: Bar. So I figured, what do I do? They told them that I speak German, maybe. Do I answer\nGerman, do I answer in Italian. Are they testing me? I did not know. So I said, ober dar, you\nknow, like broken German, like I knew, and they went away and then they kind of looked back,\nlike thinking, what did she say, you know? Again, I was panicking. I ran back in the house,\nfinally. I was so worried, you know, that I did the wrong thing when I didn\u2019t know what to do,\nyou know? Cause the way he pointed, I think that he pointed at me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He couldn\u2019t talk to these people, so he pointed at me. Oh my God. That\u2019s one of -- another\none of those fear-y things.",
        "Q: But it was okay.",
        "A: Yeah, it turned out okay.",
        "Q: They went to the bar and that was it.",
        "A: They went to the bar, hope they --",
        "Q: You hope they got drunk.",
        "A: They got drunk, and other things.",
        "Q: And other things. And sick.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And we have to change the tape.",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: Is there anything that we need to know more about what happened to you in the forest? Are\nthere things --",
        "A: In the forest.",
        "Q: -- anything that stands out?",
        "A: Hunger, a lot of hunger. Always scared that somebody\u2019s gonna discover us. Broken up\nbecause the sleep, and again, going to the bathroom. Don\u2019t forget, you had to go into the woods,\nyou know. And I was one to be sure everybody\u2019s here, nobody is going where I\u2019m going.",
        "Q: You wanted a lot of privacy.",
        "A: I wanted privacy.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then you never knew who was gonna be out there, either. It was very, very difficult,\nanother difficult time. And what else? Waiting for food, worrying about my Muschi, and just\nworrying about everything, you know, I was always worrying about things.",
        "Q: How did you all get along? The two families.",
        "A: We got along pretty good --",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: -- with this family. I really cannot say that we had any -- the only time we had really a fight\nwas because of the cat.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Cause they finally had some meat and the cat took it, and not only that, brought her boyfriend\nin to help her eat it.",
        "Q: Did she leave you to go see her boyfriend a lot?",
        "A: Well, for awhile we thought we lost her.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: We thought we lost her, and then here she comes, home pregnant, just like a bad girl.",
        "Q: But she didn\u2019t feel like a bad girl, I guess.",
        "A: No, she was a good girl. No.",
        "Q: So you did not keep her -- there was -- there was no way to keep her --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- inside or anything.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: She just roamed wherever she wanted.",
        "A: She -- wherever she wanted, you know.",
        "Q: Did she stick close to you very often?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Then she [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, you see she followed us in the worst weather --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- so she felt good with us, but she just was a bad girl.",
        "Q: Yes. She found a boyfriend [indecipherable]",
        "A: Found a boyfriend and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Did you have any religious beliefs as a little kid?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a very sore subject. I had religious beliefs because I was told to have religious\nbeliefs. I had to, you know, go to synagogue, and when I went to synagogue -- we went to\nsynagogue where the women were upstairs, the men downstair, that was my grandparents, you\nknow. They were kosher. But my mother never wa -- believed in it. She was a rebel then, to the\nend. And -- but she didn\u2019t disturb their kitchen or anything. But when we went out, or when she\nwent out -- you don\u2019t go out to eat in Vienna that much. But when she did go out, she did not eat\nkosher food, okay? But she -- she respected whatever the hou --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t even tear the toilet paper on Shabbes. You know, had to be done Friday, cause\nyou\u2019re not supposed to tear. And when I drove my mother crazy the whole week I didn\u2019t want to\ndo anything, but came Saturday, I wanted to knit, I wanted to sew, I wanted to clean. Drove her\nnuts. The whole week you don\u2019t want to do and s -- come Saturday, you want to do it.",
        "Q: So this was when you were living with your grandparents?",
        "A: Yes. Grandparents, or even when I was with Mother visiting, or whatever.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Wherever I was --",
        "Q: You were a problem.",
        "A: I was a problem. They never let me do what I wanted to do. And -- but they were wonderful\ngrandparents, wonderful. So were my parents were wonderful grandparents, too, I must say.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Too good. They gave everything to their grandkids, they loved the grandkids. So I guess it\u2019s -\n- okay you asked me about belief.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I thought -- you know, I never gave it much thought as a child. I knew I was Jewish, and I\nwas Jewish. Big deal, I\u2019m thinking now. I didn\u2019t have to go through all of that, you know, but\nI\u2019m Jewish, I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t believe in miracles, you know. I don\u2019t know what else I would believe\nin if it wasn\u2019t Jewish. I don\u2019t believe in a lot of things. You know, they all say the Bible, the\nBible is a wonderful thing. But it\u2019s written by people. God didn\u2019t write the Bible, you know?\nThat\u2019s what I always feel. So what else am I gonna believe? I\u2019m not over religious, I\u2019m not. And\nI think -- for some reason I\u2019m not, which I cannot completely say. I can\u2019t say.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t pray when you were in the forest, you didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Not much.",
        "Q: Do you think your parents did?",
        "A: My brother. My brother was laying Tefillin every day.",
        "Q: You\u2019re kidding me.",
        "A: After the -- he was Bar Mitvah\u2019d.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: He was very religious. But -- unbelievable.",
        "Q: So he carried the Tefillin with him.",
        "A: Yes, he carried the Tefillin and everything.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: But then, you know, he got away from it because he married a non-Jewish girl who did not\nbelieve in what he believes, which is okay, but went a little bit about it the wrong way, okay, and\nhurt us all a little bit too much. What can I tell you? So there\u2019s not too much to argue about there.",
        "Q: But you never -- you never had much of a belief?",
        "A: I think the reason I didn\u2019t have much of a belief, because of what happened to my brother. I\nthink that\u2019s kind of -- kind of upset me so much, and what happened to my parents, such\ndisappointment that they had. And -- and they didn't even ask for what they were accused of\nasking for. So anyway, I don\u2019t want to tell you.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. You -- there -- a -- on the one side when you talk about the\nItalians, they\u2019re wonderful.",
        "A: Wonderful.",
        "Q: On the other side, you get put into a concentration camp, you are certainly on the run, and --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- in really terrible circumstances --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- for at least a year, if not longer.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: That\u2019s still in the context of Italy, so is Italy a sort of a puzzle to you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not?",
        "A: Italy 1s wonderful.",
        "Q: It\u2019s wonderful.",
        "A: Wonderful. If it wasn\u2019t for Italy we wouldn\u2019t be alive. They helped us, the people were\nwonderful. The people that we knew, not -- there were some son-of-a-gun that wanted to have\nour neck, okay, the heck with them. But most people were helpful, most people were\nunderstanding. They were wonderful, that\u2019s all I can tell you. They warned us, you know. They\nfed us whenever they could. Now there were some people that had, but didn\u2019t want to show that\nthey have, so they didn\u2019t give, and -- cause they were afraid for themselves, maybe. I don\u2019t\nknow. But they\u2019re wonderful people, they really are. I love them dearly, I really do.",
        "Q: Yeah. So let\u2019s talk a bit about the DP camp you went to. It\u2019s Cinecetta?",

        "Q: Citta.",
        "A: That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: I\u2019m not trying it --",
        "A: Cinecitta.",
        "Q: Cinecitta. So this is in Rome, which is --",

        "Q: Which it then became afterwards again?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So is this the central place in Italy where the DPs were?",
        "A: DPs, yes, it really was. And they all got jobs there. My husband\u2019s mother was a cook in one\nof the kitchens. My mother was a cook in the big kitchen where all the refugees came. And my\nfather was in -- kitchen employed. I was in the kitchen employed to give out cards so people\nshouldn\u2019t double up on their food, see because they came twice, if it\u2019s leftover, they were\nwelcome, but not take away from somebody else the first one.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. So I had to turn cards, and give them numbers, you know, if there was one meal,\nthat\u2019s what I was doing. And then I helped in the Red Cross, too, I was sewing mattress covers in\nthe Red Cross.",
        "Q: With a machine?",
        "A: With a machine. And then came the rule that they were going to pay something for that work,\nbut again, I was too young to get paid.",
        "Q: Cause you were what, thir --",
        "A: I was not fif -- not quite 15, so my mother said she\u2019s too young to get paid, she\u2019s too young to\nwork, good-bye, You\u2019re not working any more. And that was that, she didn\u2019t let me work, cause\nthey didn\u2019t want to pay me.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re not going to school.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re not working.",

        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s -- but it started in the DP camp?",
        "A: Oh yeah, always in the DP camp. I was -- I loved to dance, just loved to dance, and the first --\nI was 13 in camp, when this soldier, a British soldier in fact, took me to dance. So I danced, it\nwas nice, you know, I started to make different steps which I didn\u2019t really know. And he was so\npatient, he was so nice, he was not fresh, he was a gentleman. And the trouble was he left, and I\ncould only dance with him, I thought, you know. That\u2019s how silly a person is. So then another\nguy wanted to dance with me, so I said, I can\u2019t dance with you, you dance different, I can\u2019t dance\nwith you. Oh yes, you can. So then he took me to dance. Okay, so I danced with this guy. But\nthen there was this great dancer. He was a black guy, not American black, from Abyssinia,\nEthiopia now. He was wonderful. He was Fred Astaire. And he really taught me to dance. I was\nthe first one on the dance floor, the last one off. He was terrific. And except that he was black,\nhis features were white, you know? And he spoke perfect Italian. And you know, just a dancing\npartner. So my parents said, look, we\u2019re going down to dance, we\u2019ll be with you, I don\u2019t want\nyou to dance with him all the time. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have to dance with him at all if you don\u2019t want\nme to dance,\u201d you know. Fresh little me. So I stuck close to them, I made believe I don\u2019t see\nhim. So this guy was smarter than me or them, came over and said -- you know, greeted my\nparents nicely and said, \u201cDo you mind if your dau -- 1f your daughter dances with me?\u201d Put them\non the spot, and I had to dance again.",
        "Q: So good, you got a chance.",
        "A: So that was good, yeah.",
        "Q: That was good.",
        "A: That was good. And that was, you know. But then he left, and then my mother-in-law -- at\nthat time I had no idea it was gonna be my mother-in-law, there was a Hungarian guy in camp\nthey wanted to dance with me. I could not stand him. I absolutely could not stand him. And my\nmother-in-law kept on talking to him, giving him ideas how he could endear himself to me. And\ntalked to him, you know, Hungarian, they were Hungarian. And he kept on bugging me. He was\n-- he took a job cleaning the hallways in Cinecitta so he could see me, you know, in my room\nand when I come out. I didn\u2019t come out.

        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I did. That\u2019s how I could not stand him. I was -- washed the floor in our room, and I took the\npail to go to the bathroom to spill it out, he was there, he wanted to do it. I didn\u2019t want him to do\nit. I didn\u2019t want him anywhere near me. I think my mother-in-law knew something. She tried to\nget rid of me a long time ago, it didn\u2019t work. No, we had a good relations -- his mother lived with\nme for 40 years.",

        "A: The -- yeah, family friend, and my brother was friends --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so my husband has a different version of how we got back in touch than I do.",
        "Q: I see, okay, I want your version.",
        "A: My version is that they s -- they came here after us, right, in \u00b049.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, I think he looked in the phone book for Arzt, the name. And he found Arzt. Then he\ncalled up us, and then of course we wanted to see them right away, and we made arrangements to\nsee them. And my husband thinks because they were in the paper that we saw the paper, and got\nahold of them, but it wasn\u2019t like that, but it\u2019s okay, either story 1s okay. But I think I\u2019m right.",
        "Q: But you think you\u2019re right. I -- I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: He never asks me. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: So what -- when you re-met, it was different?",
        "A: Yeah, when we -- when we re-met, I was -- I had a boyfriend.",
        "Q: You had a boyfriend?",
        "A: [had a boyfriend.",
        "Q: Oh, ho, ho.",
        "A: Yeah. So, he was jealous of the boyfriend.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the boyfriend was jealous of him. So it was a fun -- a fun time. But I guess he won.",
        "Q: I guess he won. And we\u2019ll change the tape.",
        "A: He won the jackpot.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: So did you choose, or did they -- did Zdenko choose, between you? You were in the middle.",
        "A: Choose me?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t choose him.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t believe it.",
        "A: I gave in.",
        "Q: You gave in.",
        "A: I gave in.",
        "Q: You got tired.",
        "A: I was tired of saying no. But yo -- he called from Kansas City to New York as often as\npossible. Will you marry me? No. Will you marry me? No. Then he got, okay. Every day, will\nyou marry me. So -- and I was so tired. Then my mother said, \u201cYou\u2019re driving him crazy, just\nmake up your mind.\u201d I said, \u201cI did make up my mind, but he doesn\u2019t leave my mind alone.\u201d So --\nand everybody, you know, liked him, and they liked me and what do you mean, you belong\ntogether. I said, no. I was fighting and fighting it, but --",
        "Q: But you gave up fighting.",
        "A: Yeah. And in -- now I\u2019m really talking. The morning -- no, the morning before our wedding,\nthe day before our wedding, I got a letter from my ex-boyfriend wishing me well, and -- a very\nlovely letter saying how nice it was to know me, and blah, blah, blah. And my mother brings the\nletter just when my husband is there -- who wasn\u2019t my husband yet. So nosy wants to know. So\nhere, read it. I mean, it\u2019s nothing wrong what he wrote. You send this letter back to him. Why?\nHe has no business writing you a letter. I said, he\u2019s just has good wishes for us, why not? I don\u2019t\nwant the letter. You don\u2019t have the letter, I have -- anyway, back and forth and back and forth.\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t send the letter back. So he says, you don\u2019t send the letter back, I don\u2019t want to\nmarry you. I said, it\u2019s a deal. You don\u2019t want to marry me, fine. Okay, we\u2019ll talk tonight, you\ncome over to his family --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and we\u2019ll see what his cousin -- he relied a lot on his cousin, older cousin, see what he says.\nI said, okay, take -- I brought the letter, I let George read it. George said, nothing wrong with the\nletter, you know. And he 1s hysterical with this letter. So I said, here George, you keep the letter,\nbut I\u2019m not sending it back. Anyway, said goodnight, you want to go -- okay, Pll see you\ntomorrow, maybe. So then --",
        "Q: He said -- he said maybe? Oh, you said maybe.",
        "A: And then in the morning he called me up and aggravates me yet about the letter. So I said,\nyou better stop, don\u2019t want to hear it, you want to get married? Yeah, but you should, you know,\nit\u2019s not right, and blah, blah, blah. So I hung up on him. The morning of our wedding, I hung up\non him, okay? But I knew he was gonna come around, so I did get dressed, you know? Can you\nsee the picture of all that?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So anyway, I got dressed, and you\u2019re not familiar with New York, are you?",
        "Q: Yes, I am, sure.",
        "A: Ye -- are you? Well, we got married in Brooklyn.",
        "Q: It\u2019s where I was born.",
        "A: Yeah? Oh good --",
        "Q: Queens.",
        "A: -- so you know. On Pitkin Avenue, in -- in a place called Little Oriental. Very nice, you know,\nnot -- they had everything ready for me, I didn\u2019t have to get a -- a rabbi, not a hazzan, a singer, a\nmusic, they arranged everything. The food, wonderful, kosher from top to bottom, and so cheap,\nyou know. Now it\u2019s -- would be like nothing, you know, but for us it was sort of expensive, you\nknow. So anyway we had this wonderful wedding, and the guy said, well you don\u2019t have to\nworry because we had guards at the door if the groom wants to run away. I said, \u201cI think you\nmight need guards for me, not for him.\u201d Oh. So anyway, we got married, obviously.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Had a lot of fights in between, but we\u2019re still here.",
        "Q: Yeah, so you kept each other on your toes.",
        "A: We kept each other on our toes, and what can I tell you?",
        "Q: And you were close with his mother and father?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know --",
        "Q: So she was very happy.",
        "A: Yes. My -- my parents came over to Kansas City and they usually brought the kids with them,\nmy nephews.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah, and they came. Even on the bus, you know, couldn\u2019t afford really to fly them, four or\nfive of them, so Mother was schlepping on that bus, poor woman. She wanted to come, you\nknow, and be with me too. And --",
        "Q: Guess it must have been hard for her for you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- to be out in Kansas City.",
        "A: Especially we got married in July, and we were supposed to move back in October, okay?",
        "Q: Move back to New York?",
        "A: Move back to New York.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t get my stuff out of New York, seven years later. Not my sewing machine, not all the\ngifts, everything. I didn\u2019t open anything cause I thought I\u2019m moving back.",
        "Q: I see. So you sti --",
        "A: Speaking of tricking.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Speaking of tricking, he had no intention of moving back.",
        "Q: He had no intention?",
        "A: No. He lied through his teeth.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: He couldn\u2019t leave his parents, but I could leave my parents, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And stuff like that. So --",
        "Q: So did you adjust to Kansas City?",
        "A: I did adjust to Kansas City.",
        "Q: You like it now?",
        "A: I like Kansas City. I\u2019m very glad I did not move back --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- to be honest, but I don\u2019t want him to know that.",
        "Q: No, we\u2019re not going to tell him this.",
        "A: You\u2019re not going to tell anybody.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But no, I wouldn\u2019t change it.",
        "Q: And did you eventually get all your presents to Kansas City?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t open my presents til I moved into the house. We lived in an apartment for seven years\nbefore we build the house.",
        "Q: House.",
        "A: And then I finally got everything in the house.",
        "Q: And then you opened your presents?",
        "A: And then I opened my presents.",
        "Q: Did you then send thank you notes to people, or not?",
        "A: Most of the boxes I opened, I did send thank you notes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yeah. I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s in them any more, you know?",
        "Q: This must have been the longest period of time --",
        "A: Very long.",
        "Q: -- that anyone held their wedding presents.",
        "A: Very long time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I lived on this street called Truman Road.",
        "Q: Truman\u2019?",
        "A: Truman Road, which led to his house, you know, a little bit. He\u2019s in Independence --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you\u2019ve heard of Independence.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And we were not -- well, we were on the same road with Truman. And we had an apartment\nthere with my in-laws, of course. And they were very nice to me, and they loved me, and I loved\nthem. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t always easy.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know? It wasn\u2019t easy for them probably either. But -- you don\u2019t have much privacy,\nthat\u2019s the only thing.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But you have a good cook.",
        "Q: You were sure of that.",
        "A: Yeah, a good cook.",
        "Q: And you went to work pretty much right away?",
        "A: Yeah, I did. My first job was in -- see, I never worked in a factory. I always worked in New\nYork, custom made clothes. And -- fine clothes, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know what a factory is. And then when I came he -- to Kansas City they didn\u2019t have\ncustom made stuff.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: There was only one store and they didn\u2019t need anybody, you know? Alterations I never did, I\ndidn\u2019t know. So I went to work at a factory that was making maternity clothes. And I started\nthere -- was my first job there. I started to work there in the biggest heat. That year, in \u201954,\nKansas City had the biggest heat. And I\u2019m in the factory, I thought I\u2019d die. I didn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] and you know, they don\u2019t have air condition. The fans going, that just gave you\na headache. It was very, very hard time ahead. So I tried to, after awhile -- the boss was very nice\nto me, in fact at first, you know, he gave me a certain how much he\u2019s gonna pay. But then when\nhe saw me, he gave me a little more, which is good. And then I started to look for other jobs. But\nI just couldn\u2019t get used to the factory work. So then this lady calls me, and she says, do you do\nalterations? And th -- from the Jewish vocational service. I said, no, I never did alterations. Well,\nyou know how to sew? Yes. You want to try? I said, I don\u2019t know. I know I don\u2019t like factory.\nDo you know how to shorten sleeves? I said, I should know how to shorten sleeve. Well, mens\u2019s\nsleeves. So I said, you know, I never shorten a man\u2019s sleeve. So she says, why don\u2019t you come\nin, try, okay? We need some help, try, see how it works. Okay. I went to try and stayed there 15\nyears. There\u2019s no hope for me. So they wouldn\u2019t let me go. Shin -- he showed me once, you\nknow, how you -- men\u2019s little different. But if you know how to sew, it\u2019s not that difficult.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And so I wound up doing most of the women\u2019s stuff, besides po -- besides shortening sleeves\nfor the men\u2019s coat. And they were very fond of me, and were nice to me except for the money,\nthey were not too generous. He was a Polish refugee who married an American girl, Jewish girl\nin Kansas City. And he was good to me, very good, but the money was a different story, he was\nstingy. So then everybody said why don\u2019t you go on your own, why do you have to work for\nhim. And I wanted to get out, I tell you why. He was very nice, but he got ill, you know? And it\nupset me that he was ill, and he was nervous. So I figure, maybe it\u2019s time to leave, cause he is\nnot going to be able to work much longer, and besides, you know, I just -- maybe they\u2019re right,\nmaybe I should go on my own. So then a friend of mine said that she would go in with me, that\nshe would, you know. So -- and that\u2019s how I opened up a business. We found a spot, a store, and\nwe open it up, and of course anybody that came to s -- to s -- him and say where\u2019s Evie, he didn\u2019t\nknow where I went. Cause he knew, but I mean, he didn\u2019t know. He would say, I don\u2019t know. I\ndon\u2019t know where she 1s. He was very, very upset that I left, you know. Because he could go on\nvacation and leave me, you know, he -- he trusted me, and so it hur -- I understand that he was\nupset that I left, but after all, I had to live too. So I went into business, 29 years.",
        "Q: 29 years. So were you making custom clothes then?",
        "A: No, alterations.",
        "Q: Alterations still, right.",
        "A: I did a few -- I snuck a few custom clothes in, but it\u2019s hard to do both. You have to do one or\nthe other because you need different spots, and a different table, different machine. And you\nneed too much patience, which at the end I\u2019m not -- I didn\u2019t have any more. But I still have\nenough patience, people still come to me. See, the trouble is with custom made clothes, they see\na paper, you know a magazine, and they think, I want that, they think they\u2019re gonna look like the\nmagazine.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, they\u2019re not going to look like the magazine. So then they start to pick. I think this sleeve\nis a quarter of an inch, or maybe just an eighth of an inch too long. And they make you, you\nknow, do it over for nothing.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You know, just because it\u2019s custom made, so they think they have to. So I said, no, I don\u2019t\nwant to make anything custom made. When they buy the clothes, they know what they\u2019re\ngetting, you know, they can see. I\u2019d rather do alter -- which I never thought I would like.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Never thought I would like. But I liked it for awhile, but then when I started to not have\npatience, I said it\u2019s time to retire.",
        "Q: Right. 29 years is a long time.",
        "A: Cause I don\u2019t -- and 15 years in [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, they\u2019re still coming to me.",
        "Q: I bet.",
        "A: And I only kept -- I only kept the cream of the crop.",
        "Q: I would come to you.",
        "A: I bet you would.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I wish you could.",
        "Q: In a minute.",
        "A: Wish you could. So, you know, they still trust my work --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and -- but I don\u2019t want to -- I do it, but don\u2019t rush me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know? I been rushed all my life, I don\u2019t want to be rushed. No, I give you a week. I said,\nthat\u2019s rushing. They\u2019re teasing me, you know.",
        "Q: When did you start to think of yourself as a survivor of the Holocaust? Was it late, was it\nright away?",
        "A: Right --",
        "Q: Away.",
        "A: I think.",
        "Q: Did you talk about it?",
        "A: No, not too much.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Not too much.",
        "Q: Recently have you t-talked about it more?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve talked about it more since the book came out in Kansas City.",
        "Q: And what book is that?",
        "A: That\u2019s the book, it\u2019s called, \u201cFrom the Heart.\u201d Our pictures -- all the people that are in the\nbook, the pictures are on the front page. Mine is the only colored picture --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- so there I am, as a bride, see? And Johnny\u2019s next -- Zdenko\u2019s next to me. And then you turn\nit around what we are now, oh my gosh, okay? They had to do that. And inside, whoever\u2019s in the\nbook, there\u2019s a story, you know, to the --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- what they interviewed, you know. I told you the one that interviewed me just wanted to\nknow about my childhood --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and she didn\u2019t understand that I didn\u2019t have a childhood.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. So I couldn\u2019t really express the way I wanted to express. And -- but that\u2019s what\nhappened.",
        "Q: And what was that, w-wa -- was that in the 90\u2019s?",
        "A: That\u2019s when they -- that\u2019s how I started to think more.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: It was about 10 years ago.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That that started. And then they had a big get together, celebrating 10 years of this book, and\neverything. In fact, Zenie came with her husband, and my nephew, my first nephew and his\ngirlfriend, because after 35 years they decided to divorce, and so he came with his girlfriend.\nAnd that was wonderful, to have my family there.",
        "Q: Oh yeah, sure.",
        "A: That meant so much to me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They gave us a beautiful, beautiful dinner, all the Holocaust survivors. And Dudu Fisher, you\nknow Dudie Fisher?",
        "Q: I know the name.",
        "A: He\u2019s an Israeli singer.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: He came to entertain. Wonderful.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Just wonderful. And like I said, it meant so much that they came. And so that\u2019s when I\nstarted, 10 years ago to think. And then certain things come to me and I said, my God, I almost\nforgot that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know? And things like that. You know. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you very much, for coming from Kansas City and for being who you\nare.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: It\u2019s been a pleasure to be with you.",
        "A: You\u2019re sweet, thank you. ...This is a picture in Vienna. It is I, my brother, and my little\ncousin, who we just were crazy about. He was just a little -- this picture really doesn\u2019t do him\njustice because he was so much cuter. But he makes a funny face, and I think the sun was shining\nin somehow. But he is one that got killed, they did not let him live.",
        "Q: And what year do you think this was?",
        "A: I think it must have been \u201939. \u201939, because I think my dad was gone by then, and we went to\nsee. \u00b038 or \u00b039, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: This is my brother and I, when we got to Genoa. So that was before his Bar Mitzvah, so I\nguess -- we figured out yesterday when was that, \u201940?",
        "Q: No --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- he was born in \u201929 --",
        "A: It\u2019s \u201927 he was born.",
        "Q: Twen -- oh, \u201927.",
        "A: 1927, so must have been \u201940, that\u2019s just 13.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: 1940. We\u2019d -- had just gotten to Genoa, and I think my parents wanted us to have a picture\nlike that.",
        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: This is when we got to Genoa. Again, 1t was done the same time as the one before. It\u2019s my\nparents, me in the middle, and my mother\u2019s in the middle a-at the bottom. And on one side the\nbigger woman, yeah, she was the landlady, and there was a maid there. And they took very nice\ncare of us. They were wonderful to us. We lived there long as we were in Genoa. I can still\nremember the name of the street, which was via Goito. So, little after that, started bombardments,\nand things were a little bit more difficult. But they were so good to us.",
        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: This picture is my brother in Pari, teaching these wonderful girls, and one is prettier than the\nother, which he loved, teaching them German. They had nothing else to do, they were coming to\nPari to get away from the big city\u2019s bombardments and so on. I\u2019m not sure what town they came\nfrom, whether it was just as close as Siena or Florence, or maybe even Pisa, I don\u2019t know.\nAnyway, there nothing else to do, so they thought they would learn German.",
        "Q: And this shot?",
        "A: And this is me, and my parents, and my brother, and I remember my outfit being gray with a\npink blouse, and was so pretty. And it was a -- a Jewish holiday. Of course, there was no -- you\nknow, no synagogue or anything, but my mother always made sure, somehow she managed to\ngive us some new clothes on holidays.",
        "Q: And this was in Pari?",

        "A: Just went away. I don\u2019t know why, but that\u2019s --",
        "A: No, I think I really appreciated that they didn\u2019t.",
        "A: I really did.",
        "A: I really did. And we left -- Mother got some papers, so -- for him to get out of the camp, but\nwe were able to take him out, but if he wouldn\u2019t leave in 24 hours, Vienna, they take you back\nand that\u2019s it, that -- you only had one chance. So thank God, she got papers, spend a lot of\nmoney, whatever she had on them, and they weren't worth anything.",
        "A: Worth anything. And just on time, Italy opened up, all you needed was a passport, you could\ngo to Italy, so -- which was a blessing, because whatever she had, Uruguay, Paraguay, I don\u2019t\nknow where all the papers were, but you couldn\u2019t travel with them.",
        "A: Out of the country.",
        "A: Worth -- worthless.",
        "A: Exactly. With a lot of harassment when -- while she was trying to get them. And I know that\nwas so sad, because sometimes she rushed to be first, you know, to get there, and if you were\nfirst, then they put you at the end of the line. You know, they did -- tried anything to give you a\nhard time. So sometimes she came home crying.",
        "A: So -- but she, you know, she did everything she could. So we got -- she got the passport from\nPapa, and then he didn\u2019t have a picture, so quickly when he gonna came out, he took a picture,\nand that\u2019s all the passport needed. And you can see his face is swollen like that. They gave him\ncertain things that swelled the people up, especially the ones that they let out, to show that he 1s -",
        "A: That he is okay. But it was not a healthy look he had, you know? So --",
        "A: Yes, he came --",
        "A: Yes, yes, oh yes.",
        "A: The best.",
        "A: I went to the -- to the sta -- train station to get him. And a lot of them were [indecipherable]\nright in, he wasn\u2019t there yet, but he came [indecipherable]. That was the best sight.",
        "A: And then we had to tell him, you know, that he has to get out.",
        "A: So Milan, that was the closest, you know, to Italy that he could go. But we were so lucky that\nthey let us in, just with the passport. And then he got there, and he -- I don\u2019t know, he must have\nwritten, or I guess just a letter saying that -- we said we would follow him, your mother said that\nshe would follow him with me and my brother. And he wrote, don\u2019t come yet, because I cannot\nfind work, and I don\u2019t speak the language. Obviously. And Mom wrote him back, don\u2019t write\nany more. We\u2019re coming this and this time, wait for us at the station, at the railroad station in\nMilan. And that\u2019s what she did, and that\u2019s how she saved our life.",
        "A: See, he was still so stupid -- excuse me, Dad -- after going through what he went through, he\nstill didn\u2019t believe that they would touch children and old people. He didn\u2019t believe that. Or\nwomen.",
        "A: He thought just the men. And then he would leave us alone, but obviously, as we know later,\nthey didn\u2019t leave anybody alone.",
        "A: So he figured that we should stay safely at home, rather than going into the -- how would you\nsay, into the world without knowing where we\u2019re going, okay? But Mom was smart enough to --\nand we wanted to take, you know, the grandparents, to follow us even, and his brother. One got\nout to England, the youngest one. The older one had a wife and a baby, cutest baby. And no, he\nhad -- she had a father, and he had the parents he wouldn\u2019t leave, you know, and he still had a\nsister. They didn\u2019t believe.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t believe, because they, you know, they took them all, after. I -- I finally went to\nVienna, I made one trip to Vienna, after 35 years, 40 years, I\u2019m not sure. And I asked if they\nknow what happened to my family, grandparents.",
        "A: So then they wrote me with a list of what camp they were taken to. Camps that I never heard\nof. But they said there was nothing unusual because they had like 250 camps. You know, you\nonly knew about the big ones --",
        "A: -- like Dachau, Buchenwald, Auschwitz, and Bergen-Belsen, all those. But the little ones you\ndidn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Hundreds of, yes. And they wrote me, you know, where they were killed, and wa -- they even\nhad written down what day they wer -- died. They don\u2019t say killed, the day they were died. Some\nof them I think they had wrong names, but I had an idea of, you know, when it happened.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Ju -- and father --",
        "A: -- and mother.",
        "A: In Milan, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Just the four of us.",
        "A: Just the four of us. Nobody else made it out. Nobody else made it out.",
        "A: Yeah, we took a train. And we got very nervous c-crossing, you know the -- the border, cause\nyou never know --",
        "A: -- what they\u2019re gonna do with you. And the passport has a big J on it, so there was no -- you\nknow, they\u2019re asking me always when there\u2019s my name, middle name, you have a middle name?\nAt that time they did not -- children did not get middle names like now. But Hitler gave us a\nmiddle name.",
        "A: Sarah. Sarah, Sarah -- all the Jewish people were Sarah and the men were Israel. Even in the\npassport it tells there, you know.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, on my mother\u2019s passport.",
        "A: Yeah. Mine.",
        "A: Heinz, too, yeah.",
        "A: Mother\u2019s passport, three of us on one passport, mm-hm.",
        "A: Not much.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have much.",
        "A: And we were afraid to take any possessions because we didn\u2019t trust them, you know --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] in the border. So we just took like we were -- we wanted to take -- the\nwarm blankets like they had in Austri --",
        "A: A quilt, a [indecipherable]",
        "A: A down.",
        "A: You know, we all had down, and Mother wanted to take for us. And then my brother says,\ndon\u2019t take it, don\u2019t take it. He was afraid, you know. So then later, while we still were able to\nconverse with them in Vienna, my aunt decided she\u2019s gonna s-send one to us.",
        "A: Never got that.",
        "A: Never got that. But I know she did. And none of the jewelry or anything.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t take anything. My mother\u2019s, you know, just wedding ring. I had a charm bracelet,\nyou know, which I was so fond of, but we had a feeling like maybe my aunt put it in the quilt,\nbecause she knew that I liked it.",
        "A: But maybe that\u2019s when they found that, they just took everything away.",
        "A: You just never knew what they were -- and I forgot to tell you that in the morning they came\nto pick up my father. If he wasn\u2019t gone --",
        "A: They would have picked him up, yeah. They would have taken him. W-We could hear it on\nthe steps, too, you know, they were --",
        "A: Yeah, the boots, coming up the steps and knocking on the door like crazy. And my poor\ngrandmother was so, you know, scared. But --",
        "A: They came to my grandmother\u2019s house, because Mother, you know, was with us more than\nshe was -- she gave up the apartment.",
        "A: But what\u2019s the use, you know, to pay rent there, and you know, not be there.",
        "A: So, she was wi --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. And --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Her sign was the pail. The pail and the brush.",
        "A: And her pa -- she didn\u2019t have a passport then.",
        "A: For Papa, yeah. For Father. That was the important one.",
        "A: Yeah, that he got away.",
        "A: Yes. Til we crossed the border [indecipherable] to border. One of the -- one of the borders\nwhich was very tense. When they come in -- they really scare you when they walk in, you know?",
        "A: They were so scary looking. Well, they let us go, and that\u2019s the main thing. My brother, I\nthink, was more scared than me, even. Maybe cause he was older, he was smarter to be scared\nthan me. So he was really nervous when they got --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, other people.",
        "A: Other people, yeah, other people.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Maybe they knew, but they didn\u2019t -- Mother didn\u2019t tell me.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I was just sitting scared, too scared.",
        "A: I felt closer -- no, I felt pretty protected by Mom, but I felt closer to Dad, because they took\nhim.",
        "A: You know? I was worried about him.",
        "A: SO --",
        "A: I worried about him. Whew. But thank God --",
        "A: -- he came out. There was -- and you know, my father never talked about.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t really want him to, not at that young age. Maybe later on I would have liked to know\ncertain things. But I tell you why he didn\u2019t. He felt insulted by the situation, you know? He felt\nso degraded. He didn\u2019t think that he was deserving of such a thing.",
        "A: So he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, no. Was strange, but he never talked about it. The only\nthing 1s, you know, when they -- in the street when they were walking, and they met someone\nfrom -- they used to say K. Z., K. Z. lager, and they knew each other, and then they called my\nfather\u2019s name, it was like this, you know, he was jumping. So it was always a hard thing when he\n-- when he met someone in the street and they called his name, he was like an attention. And was\nso sad to see that.",
        "A: It was happening in Italy.\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Train? Yes, because my dad was there.",
        "A: That\u2019s how you remember.",
        "A: It was happiness.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have time.",
        "A: I would say maybe a couple of weeks.",
        "A: Yes, we rushed. I think. It might have been longer, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: 1939 -- end of \u201939, I guess. I have to look it up.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure. Let me see. I don\u2019t even know if it says here. Think there were some dates here.\nThere\u2019s -- maybe here. Okay. 1930 -- 1940 was already.",
        "A: Escape from Vienna. Yeah, must -- must have been the end of 1939, \u201940.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, he had an apartment.",
        "A: Yeah, with one -- one room, you know, just one room. And I don\u2019t have a big memory of\nMilan at all.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think very long, no. But a few weeks, quite a few weeks.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t have a very good memory of that. I remember being there, not knowing -- and I\nremember coming down stair -- steps, and whoever was there, the landlady or whatever you call\nher, tried to teach me to say, you know, good morning, good evening. And then I tried to\nremember which was morning, which was evening, you know. That was kind of hard, you know,\nto learn all of a sudden, a language.",
        "A: Buon giorno.",
        "A: Buona sera.",
        "A: Yes, I did learn. My favorite language.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, I think so.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I guess with the little money that he took with him, you know. But then we had to leave\nMilan, then someone talked us into going to France, that we could be saved in France. So we\nwent to Italian city, Ventimiglia, which was on the border of someplace. And over there there\nwere people that were leaders, to take you over to France, through mountains and woods, you\nknow? But they needed money, you know, they wanted money, they did it for money.",
        "A: So we stayed there for awhile, and waited for the right people to come to take us. And some\npeople came back. I remember that so clearly, they couldn\u2019t get them across. And here comes\nthis young woman, we were sitting and having lunch. We had like, I remember, a lunch -- you\nknow, lunch is the big meal in Europe, just one, either one minestr -- minestrone, you know, the\nvegetable soup.",
        "A: Which filled you up and it was good. And that\u2019s all we could afford, you know, just have this\nplate of soup, or -- I didn\u2019t get used to spaghettis yet, you know, I didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t eat the spaghettis. The only one between the four of us, my mom. She\nliked them right away. But we didn\u2019t, so we had the soup. And we\u2019re sitting in the restaurant, and\nhe -- here comes this young woman, scratched from top to bottom, just scratches on her. And she\nstands by the door, like out of her mind, and she pees in front of everybody, just standing there\non the door. She lost her mind. She absolutely lost her mind trying to get up, you know, the\nmountains, and they had so many thorns there that wherever they were going, it just scratched\nthe hell out of her, you know? And mu -- she must have gone through such a terrible thing that\nshe just didn\u2019t know what she was doing. She was crying, just crying. And I told my parents,\n\u201cWe have to go through that? That\u2019s terrible.\u201d So Mother said, \u201cYeah, but we already gave them\nall our money, you know, we have to go. We don\u2019t have anything left.\u201d But then some word\ncame that it\u2019s over. They\u2019re not going any more to France. So we didn\u2019t have money, we didn\u2019t\nhave a ride, we didn\u2019t have anything. So we went to the -- to the station, to the railroad station to\nget out of Ventimiglia. And somehow, I guess -- I don\u2019t know if the Jewish emi -- Jewish people\nhelped, or who helped, I don\u2019t know. But they got us -- we were able to get on the train to\nGenoa, okay? So we got on the train -- we got on the train and my dad, he is -- was such a good\nperson, he was the leader. He had a little more, you know, brain than some of the people, so he\nwas the leader and he got everybody on the train, and he was left behind.",
        "A: Do you I have to tell you more? Did this get -- did I get hysteric -- you darn right I got\nhysterical. And they had soldiers on the train, they were all trying to comfort me, I don\u2019t know --\ndidn\u2019t understand what they were saying to me, you know. But I know they were nice to me.\nYou know, the Italian? And they tried to calm me down. And the -- I don\u2019t know what you call\nthe guy that was running -- not running the train, but the people that are on the train, don\u2019t worry,\ndon\u2019t worry, because next stop -- he tried to explain to me the next stop, they gonna put him on\nthe next train and we just have to wait. But that was 100 years we waited. You know? We had\njust gotten him, and now to lost him again, it was horrible.",
        "A: No, they -- we -- we got to Genoa and just waited at the station --",
        "A: -- for the next train.",
        "A: Til he finally got out.",
        "A: So then, we were in Genoa, where do we go? You know, what do we do?",
        "A: So there was a piazza, you know, in Italy, they have a lot of piazzas, and there was a piazza\nChristopher Columbus. And that\u2019s where we wanted to go because we felt closer to America,\nbeing --",
        "A: -- Columbus was there.",
        "A: So we went on that piazza.",
        "A: After my dad, sure --",
        "A: -- we waited",
        "A: -- oh yeah --",
        "A: -- oh yeah. And then we needed something, we hadn\u2019t eaten a long time, too, and they had\nlike milk, you know, they sell milk, warm milk in Italy, big -- big cups, like a bowl more. And\nwe had some of that with some bread in that, you know, which was any thing inexpensive that\nwe could get. And so we had a bite of that, what did we do now? So then the Italian government\ngave us a Subsidy.",
        "A: They did, yes, they did give us some money. I don\u2019t know exactly how many liras, but it\nhelped -- helped us, you know? And then we got into an apartment. They helped us to get into an\napartment. I am saying apartment, I\u2019m -- it\u2019s a room, we got a room with pens -- a penzione.\nPenzione. Fact, I got some pictures from that, too. And -- and we got one big room, and it was\nlike below the level of the street, but we didn\u2019t care, you know, as long as we were together, and\n-- in fact, we snuck in some people that were, you know, needy, didn\u2019t know where to go, so we\n-- they slept with us on the floor, whatever. We snuck them in at night. I remember that. Of\ncourse, Mother never told us that we were sneaking them in, but I think we were smart enough to\nknow.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t pay us, you know, they didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It had beds, and closet, and --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. We were good kids, yeah.",
        "A: They never had trouble with us, no.",
        "A: We never wanted to get separated --",
        "A: -- no, we stuck together like glue. So -- and then -- then came the order. I don\u2019t know why,\nthat we had to leave Genoa, but the men had to be separated from the women and children.",
        "A: I would say --",
        "A: Well, actually, my brother was Bar Mitzvah\u2019d in Genoa.",
        "A: He was. He was 13 then. He was barmit -- okay, let\u2019s see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Eight or nine.",
        "A: Yeah, he\u2019s 13, and I is -- again skipped something. While we were in Genoa, the Jewish\ncommunity sent the children -- the Jewi -- Italian people were taking in children to feed them\nlunch, you know, lunch is the big meal. They were giving us lunch. But I -- to this day I don\u2019t\nunderstand why they separated my brother and I. I went to one family and he went to a different\nfamily to eat lunch. And it was very scary because there were already sirens going on, you know,\nthe war was already beginning, or I don\u2019t know what it was, but I had to walk quite a way to get\nto this -- was a woman that was -- her name was Celestina Weiss. And I remember her name.",
        "A: Celestina Weiss. And she prepared lunch for -- not she, she had a -- a woman there who was\ncooking lunch for us, just the two of us.",
        "A: Just the two of --",
        "A: Yeah. Why couldn\u2019t my brother be there with me, you know? So we would have walked\ntogether, I wouldn\u2019t have to be so scared to walk by myself when the sirens came, and then the\nha -- in Genoa they have large tunnels. So I rushed like crazy into the tunnel, cause that was like\nprotection from the bombs.",
        "A: Air raid --",
        "A: Air raids, yeah. And you know, nobody would let you in once the air raids, so I\u2019m running\ninto those tunnels like crazy, til it\u2019s over. But I\u2019m by myself, I\u2019m a little kid by myself, you\nknow?",
        "A: They were not supposed to.",
        "A: No. I came -- I think when I -- they had a little bit of schooling at the synagogue in Genoa, so\nfrom the school I had to go to the -- to it. And that there was so much left over, and I was\nthinking, why don\u2019t she give it to me for my parents, but you know, I -- I was -- I couldn\u2019t -- you\nknow, I was not brought up that way, to say anything.",
        "A: I was just thankful for the meal. And my brother went to a different family, who was also\nvery nice to him, but only him. And then when the Bar Mitzvah was, we went all to the\nsynagogue there, and this family that was feeding my brother, they send us to -- they made\nreservations in a restaurant to -- you know, to celebrate his Bar Mitzvah.",
        "A: You know they -- nobody came with us, just four of us. Now I\u2019m thinking why? Why would\nnot one of the parents, or -- I don\u2019t understand that.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They made reservation for the four of us to eat in a restaurant together, finally we were\ntogether in the meal.",
        "A: You know, I --",
        "A: But nobody else. Can you figure that one out? No. But that was war, I guess, and people were\nStrange.",
        "A: Yeah, she was nice.",
        "A: Very nice.",
        "A: Very nice.",
        "A: And you could see the richness in her house.",
        "A: You know? I think where my brother was going, there were younger people, because they had\nchildren and this woman was -- right now, a -- a -- she doesn\u2019t s-sound like she was that old, but\nyou know, at the time, when you\u2019re eight or nine, you would think she is -- maybe she was 50,\nand I thought she was 95, you know, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I would say within a year [indecipherable]",
        "A: I was already -- I was doing pretty good, not -- not as good as I wanted to, but --",
        "A: I\u2019m -- I was getting along, okay?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "A: Not at all.",
        "A: I -- I feel safe, yes. Til the order did come to separate us again. That was very bad.",
        "A: As you can imagine.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s a --",
        "A: -- Jewish school, at the synagogue.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s subjects besides religion, yes.",
        "A: Yes, they were trying to teach us, I guess, a little bit language, and math, and --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember homework.",
        "A: No. Don\u2019t remember homework.",

        "A: Not remember them.",

        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No.",

        "A: We\u2019re living on subsidy.",
        "A: No. Just enough to exist, you know?",
        "A: Well, you hear war because of the sirens, you know -- you know, and bom -- they were\nbombarding already.",
        "A: There were bombardments. So, but you don\u2019t really know what goes on here, you know?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah, I ask, but they didn\u2019t know. I think my uncle was one that was -- w-was the last one\nthat wrote. Th -- that\u2019s my father\u2019s brother.",
        "A: He went to see my other grandparents, in my mother\u2019s side.",
        "A: And he was giving us report, you know, that -- there\u2019s certain toys that we had there, that he\nwant my -- my grandfather wouldn\u2019t give it away for anything. He had like a stepstool, and my\nbrother put nails in it with his initials, see? So my uncle wanted it for his son. And says, I give\nyou everything, but I won\u2019t give you this away.",
        "A: Who knows who -- who got ahold of that --",
        "A: -- you know? But one thing my grandfather did, I had a big book of -- of fairy tales, Grimm --\nGrimm fairy tales. Was this thick, you know, all the fairy tales, and I loved that book. I loved to\nlisten to the stories all the time, and try to read them myself, too. And Mother said no way can\nyou take that book. And my grandfather, when we got to -- to Italy, there it was.",
        "A: He snuck it into the suitcase?",
        "A: My grandfather.",
        "A: One of the suitcases, there it was. Course, we had to get rid of it on the way, you know, the\nrunning we had to do, but --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, I was able to read it --",
        "A: -- yes, sure. I was reading pretty early, yeah. Then I turned dumb later, but I was smart as a\nkid.",
        "A: Well -- something with the government, I don\u2019t know exactly who 1s at fault doing that. And\nthe way they send us wherever they wanted to. But why did they separate us, we don\u2019t know.\nThat was such a mystery. There was one more woman with two children, and Mother with two\nchildren. And I know we moved in together in a -- they had a bigger house, you know, so we\nwere able to live together. And -- and that was in Potenza. The name of the town was Viggiano.",
        "A: Viggiano.",

        "A: I couldn\u2019t swear",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that. So that\u2019s where we went. I know we had to go down -- you know, the\ntowns in Italy are all up. You had to go up and then come down. Everything was hilly, and --",
        "A: -- you know. And we had to go to register with the police every day.",
        "A: Every day, that we didn\u2019t escape, or I don\u2019t know where they -- what they thought. I don\u2019t\nknow why. But that\u2019s how we got our subsidy, too, I think.",
        "A: By seeing the police.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He left, yeah.",
        "A: Yes. I -- we knew where.",
        "A: Yeah, he\u2019s -- was in Tortoreto.",
        "A: Tortoreto, yeah. So he was there, and then we were able to write to each other. They didn\u2019t\nhave cell phones then.",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t call. And then they -- I don\u2019t know if it was Tortoreto, Campania. He went two pla -\n- he went two pla -- different places.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: City -- a town, yeah. And then what we did is we made a request that maybe he could come to\nus, or we could come to him so we\u2019re together.",
        "A: You know, it was so hard to be apart. So they send us together to a camp in Italy. It was\ncalled Ferramonti. You heard of it, I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: Yeah, di Tarsia. So they send us there instead of -- nice place, you know, li -- to be free. So --",
        "A: In the south yes.",
        "A: Very hot.",
        "A: Hot during the day, lot of malaria and stuff like that going on.",
        "A: Below Rome, yeah, right.",
        "A: Maybe by truck? By truck -- truck? Maybe trucks, or buses.",
        "A: Something like that, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, we just go --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: And -- and when we got there, to f -- Ferramonti, it was so quiet there. It was the time for\nwhen they were counting, you know the people, like the soldiers were, they -- they had a --\nappelle.",
        "A: Appelle, yeah. So nobody was in the street. And my brother didn\u2019t want to go in. There\u2019s\nbarbed wire all around, he was afraid to go in. He says, that\u2019s it, the end for us, you know? So I\nsaid, and Mother too, Papa\u2019s here, we have to go in, we cannot leave him. The police had to get -",
        "A: Wouldn\u2019t go in. My brave brother wouldn\u2019t go in. So, poor guy. He says if there\u2019s barbed\nwire, and soldiers, it\u2019s not a good sign.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: 14, yeah, must be 14.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm. At least 14 going on 15, I guess.",
        "A: So we get there, and like I say, it\u2019s quiet, and there\u2019s a guy going around us like a nut, like\nthis, around and, \u201c\u201cHaben sie die Basel, Haben sie die Basel, Haben sie die Basel.\u201d",
        "A: You know, constantly is asking us for a paper, a newspaper, Basel.",

        "A: You know.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He kept circling the three of us, you know, because they were just coming out of the barracks\nat that time, and so he wanted some news, you know --",
        "A: -- poor man.",
        "A: But finally my dad came out, so that was again a good thing. We didn\u2019t feel so abandoned\nwhen he came.",
        "A: Yes. He was a little man, but strong.\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Yeah. On my mother\u2019s side, my grandfather\u2019s name was Marcus, and my grandmother was\nRose. And their last name was Leer, L double e - r.",

        "A: Toby.",
        "A: But they called her Toni.",
        "A: Toni, because Toby is too Jewish, it was too Jewish, so they tried to -- Vienna, you know, you\nhad to watch your name, your language. See, there was never a Jewish word spoken in the house,\nbecause when they went into the workforce, they didn\u2019t want the children to say Jewish words,\nbecause they were right away discriminated against. So they were very careful with Jewish\nwords.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: We were Jewish, definitely, but we tried to live in a non-Jewish world. They were so\nprejudice that --",
        "A: -- we -- we -- not talking about me --",
        "A: I\u2019m talking about my parents and grandparents --",

        "A: Yeah, before even, yeah.",
        "A: You had to be careful.",
        "A: In Italy, let\u2019s see, in Genoa, no, I felt -- except that, you know, the divisions, and I was very\nupset. I never complained about it, I never spoke about it, but thinking back, I know that I was so\nupset that we had food, and not that my parents were starving, but they had to, you know, hold\nback. So I couldn\u2019t -- now, I cannot understand why. There was so much food these people had,\nand they were rich, why couldn\u2019t they feed a family, or keep two kids together? I couldn\u2019t -- I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not adults, just --",
        "A: Well, they had some.",
        "A: They were not, you know, that -- you know, they -- simple things, you know --",
        "A: -- maybe a sandwich, or Mom -- Mother made maybe some soup, or -- you know, something.\nI don\u2019t think they were starving at that time, but it would have been nice if, you know, they could\nhave had better --",
        "A: -- I would have been happier.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, light meal. Light meal. Of course, children get more hungry than adults too, you know?",
        "A: We were so hungry.",
        "A: Yeah, it was tough when you\u2019re hungry. And I just feel for people that are hungry. I can feel\nthe pain, the hunger, you know, that I went through. It\u2019s not good. Not a good thing. And you\ndon\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be -- I remember -- well, that\u2019s later. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of\nmyself.",
        "A: No, I won\u2019t forget.",
        "A: When we get to the next town, in Ferramonti?",
        "A: We lived in barracks, one room, you know, four of us in one room.",
        "A: Small, small, very small room. And I think outside the barracks there was like toilet -- I can\u2019t\nremember where the toilets were. I don\u2019t remember bath -- baths. I think we just washed\nourselves in --",
        "A: -- sink -- no, we didn\u2019t have a sink [indecipherable] you know, in --",
        "A: Bowl, yeah.",
        "A: Purposely made for [indecipherable] I -- I don\u2019t remember baths there. There might have\nbeen, but my memory\u2019s not there.",
        "A: And my mother was so busy feeding us that her stomach sank. Do you ever hear of that?",
        "A: By her not eating, her stomach sank and she kept on fainting. You know, she walked, and she\nfainted, and she walked and she fainted. So the camp allowed us children to go outside the camp,\nor ma -- or the police, the milizia was there, the soldiers, they had booths in front of the camp in\na few places. And they could sell you some th -- God bless the Italians, they could -- she needed\na lot of vitamins, like lemons, oranges, so we bought from them that stuff. And then once in\nawhile we were able to go to one of the farms to bring for Mom some stuff that she needed, you\nknow? They didn\u2019t have vitamins like we have now to get her back on -- her health back. She\nwas just so sick, and I had to do, you know, all the labor. The washing -- and washing was not\neasy because no running water, obviously and so we carried water into the house, and then we\nhad to wash and then carry it out. And of course, you didn\u2019t have that much clothes that you have\nnow, so you had to be careful, you know, what you did, and I had a father and a brother, and --\nyou know, and I was very --",
        "A: I was doing the laundry.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think I had out -- it dried in a minute because it was so hot. It was so hot, you couldn\u2019t go\nout during the day. And we always got a lot of -- and at night it was cold.",
        "A: So there was malaria, s -- that\u2019s how you get the malaria.",
        "A: And they were so sick, people. So the government gave us shots for anti -- and then we used\nto eat quinine -- quinine, a lot every day we had to take quinine. But on top of it we got shots for\ntyphus and stuff like that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not the German, the Italian.",
        "A: In comparison to German, oh yes. But you still were restricted, and I think they had a mess\nhall, if I\u2019m not mistaken.",
        "A: I think they did have a mess hall.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the food.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "A: Give it to me now.",
        "A: Yes, I li -- I like it a lot. But -- but we ate there, I think they had so much food, and then we\nkind of got, would you say chummy, or -- the camp director, he had the little girl about my age,\nso I was friendly with her, and -- I\u2019m moving things. And he gave us a little bit more privileges,\nthe father, you know, the camp director, very nice man. But in that way my mother slowly gave\naway everything I owned to that little girl.",
        "A: I had one do -- one doll that I took from Vienna. My very favorite I couldn\u2019t take with me.\nThis was like a soft doll, and her name was Muschi.",
        "A: Muschi was a certain name this doll had. So my mother ha -- gave it to her, you know, cause\nshe liked the doll, and that\u2019s a war, you have to do that. And a lot of my clothes, which was okay,\nbecause I grew out of them, you know, and she was a little smaller. And they were all like\ncustom made, you know, from Vienna.",
        "A: And my dad working in the factory where fabrics were, from a little sample I was able to have\na dress because I was a little kid. So that\u2019s how we, you know, we paid our way and the -- you\nknow, you go through things that you have to do.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think losing the doll was I think worse than my clothes. Really was, the doll.\nAnd I lost my book, couldn\u2019t have the book to schlep with me, you know, was too heavy and --\nyou know, I understood and I didn\u2019t understand, you know? I understood that I couldn\u2019t, but I\nwish I could have, and you know.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: I did, yeah. And in Kansas City they came to interview me. You know, we have a book, I\ndon\u2019t know if you are familiar with the book, which the Kansas City Star did. And this woman\nthat came to interview me only wanted to know wa -- how was it before a -- when I was a child.\nHow was it then? I couldn\u2019t tell her very much. I tried to tell her, I was not a child, you know, I\ngrew up too fast. She didn\u2019t get it, you know. So -- I mean, I told her, and I got away a little bit\nfrom it, but I never was able to really express the way wi -- things really were.",
        "A: But that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Yeah, I --",
        "A: -- yes --",
        "A: -- taken away.",
        "A: And I never was a child again.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know --",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know whether she did or not. She liked the doll, and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: There were peo -- people married to non-Jews, you know, that stuck with their husbands,\nsome women do stick with their Jewish husband.",
        "A: Some people don\u2019t, yes, and they were there with them. In fact, we had next door to us a\ncouple that was -- he was Jewish, she was not. But they loved each other a lot and -- cause they\nwere together. And then they separated them, we heard later. And they told him that they killed\nher, and she wasn\u2019t any more alive. Well, he went out of his mind, this poor man killed himself.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t true.",
        "A: So you know, tragedies like that happen. They were such a nice couple. I just loved them.\nAnd they had a lot of -- in Ferramonti they had a lot of wild dogs. See, the dogs came, and it was\nso hot that they were a little wild, cause the heat and no food. And they came, and this couple\nwere hiding a dog that they got attached to. But then came the order that all the dogs had to be\nkilled. And I remember them sitting and just crying, you know. And still holding on and thinking\nanother day, another day. They tried to keep that dog just as long as they could. But then they\nwere searching room by room, you know, for the dog, because they said the dogs got mad, you\nknow, like from the heat, and from -- by the hundreds they came to Ferramonti, because we were\n-- we were feeding them, I guess, and they came, but not enough, so they -- they were dangerous,\nthey said. So you could just hear fire them -- firing.",
        "A: And I felt so bad for them, you know.",
        "A: Especially people I -- we didn\u2019t get any dog, no.",
        "A: Right now I would, but at that time, no. And I felt so bad for them.",
        "A: I was friendly with the dog next door --",
        "A: -- you know, with these people. But I was a little bit afraid, to be truthful, cause he was quite\na big dog, and --",
        "A: -- and they were scaring us what the dog is gonna do, and you know, that they can bite you\nand attack you, and -- I didn\u2019t see any dog doing that, but --",
        "A: -- they could have, you know? W-We got a lot of injections. And another thing where my\nbrother didn\u2019t want any inject --",
        "A: Here comes the police again, to get him to the doctor.",
        "A: Yes, yes. They were very nice to -- to do that. And I think that was -- and later on, you know,\nthe typhus was really rampant.",
        "A: So with those shots, we were --",
        "A: Yes, we were protected, we didn\u2019t even know how much, when we moved out of the camp.\nThere were a lot of doctors in that camp. Like -- I understand like over 200 doctors.",
        "A: Yes. Lot of doctors. And they were looking for work, they were so bored. So one day I\u2019m\ncarrying a -- a jug with water, and that was, you know, a jug from [indecipherable] you know,\nlike --",
        "A: -- would be ma -- ceramic, kind of. And somehow The jug hit my hand, and I was bleeding,\nyou know, I hit the vein just there. And I was ble -- you should have seen, a hundred came\nrunning. They were so happy somebody was bleeding.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They had a school. In fact, I have one picture left from that camp, with all the kids, only one\npicture. My brother is on it, and Iam. You know, real small picture.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how that one got saved. I'll tell you later how we got rid of our pictures. But\nsomehow that picture is there. There was a school, and they had exercise in the morning for the\nchildren, and this neighbor, he was our math teacher, he was also from Vienna with his wife.\nAnd they had -- they had, I think, even religion in there, they had religion, and singing, you\nknow, and it was -- and I made a lot of friends, girlfriends.",
        "A: I made some girlfriends, and I still have little doilies from Ferramonti that one of the -- my\nfriends had, and she gave them to me. There were like four -- five sisters, and she gave them to\nme to embroider. Cause you know, I was always with the needle in my hand. And so I started to\nembroider, you know, to ey -- I loved to do those things. Not now any more, but I did then. So I\nstill have that, would you believe it? Never finished them.",
        "A: Never finished them. But I cannot part with them. Isn\u2019t that silly?",
        "A: Yeah, they\u2019re small, and what you can do is you can then put them together --",
        "A: -- and make, you know --",
        "A: Yeah. I ha -- still have those.",
        "A: I just picked it up. Like I said, Mother taught me to knit. Thank God she didn\u2019t teach me to\nsew, because she couldn\u2019t sew on a button. I don\u2019t know how come I could. But she was a\nterrific knitter. She knitted beautifully. And crochet so-so, but she was knitter. She made my\ncoat, my dress, you know, knitted sweaters and stuff like that. She was good at it. And I don\u2019t\nknow why I did -- did.",
        "A: Because going in and out of school.",
        "A: Well, I liked school in Ferramonti. That was my last school. I didn\u2019t go to school til I came to\nthe States. And I was si -- almost 16. I hated every second of it. I hated it so much, I cannot tell\nyou, because they didn\u2019t know where to put me. I didn\u2019t have school, I was old --",
        "A: -- old, ancient.",
        "A: Wh-Where do you put a person like that? So they put me in the seventh grade.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Awful, awful.",
        "A: Go with the children, and you know, I was just -- not only children, dumb children in my\neyes, because they hadn\u2019t lived.",
        "A: You know? They didn't know anything about life, and I knew too much, and that wasn\u2019t so\ngood. And I just -- I just hate it.",
        "A: Yes, I di -- Ferramonti.",
        "A: Only I wasn\u2019t good in math, and I\u2019m still not good in math.",
        "A: I was good in history. I was good in language. I was pretty good in Hebrew, now I can\u2019t read\nanything any more, cause I didn\u2019t keep it up. And wasn\u2019t good in too many things, but in seventh\ngrade I was in honor roll, so I did something good, you know?",
        "A: But, 1t was bad. It was very bad for me to go to school then.",

So they looked at us, and then a few of them\ncame to touch us, I swear to you, to touch us. And then they said, you feel just like we do. You\nknow, you don\u2019t feel any different. You know, because they heard on the radio so much from\nHitler that we are such different people, beasts or whatever. So we have to feel different. Well,\nthey didn\u2019t see that. So they got very affectionate with us, and we became friends with the people\nin -- in the town, and my dad and my brother started to work in the fields, to make, you know,\nsome money, or even for trading for food.",
        "A: And they worked very hard, they worked so hard, they had to -- you know, they got jobs, wa -\n- but nobody really wanted, I mean, they were doing it, but as long as they had someone else to\ndo it -- like to build trenches for the grapes, you know, you had [indecipherable] but they were\nfull of stone and rock, and with that thing that they were knocking, you know. I mean, their\nhands were just a mess, everything was a mess. And -- but you know, they tried their best to go\ndo it, and they did their job. And then came summer, so they worked in the fields again to cut\nweed, you know, cut the weed. Why do I remember that? Because in the biggest heat, we had to\ngo and bring them lunch, okay? Mom cooked, and I had to go and take it to them in a basket, you\nknow, the hot food. I don\u2019t know why you needed hot food, it\u2019s hot like hell. Excuse me. And\nthat was the rule, they had to have lunch. And I hated to walk there, it was so hot. Didn\u2019t have\nthe best shoes, you know, to walk, but I did, and I brought them food there. And whenever I\ndidn\u2019t have to, I was very happy. Sometimes my mom went, you know, which was even harder\nfor her.

        "A: Pari? Yeah -- 1-1n a house, we were living 1n a house. Trying to think. The f -- when we first\ngot there, we lived in a house with -- we each a room, but we lived with another family for the\nkitchen -- we shared the kitchen. But we had the room, but that didn\u2019t work out too good, and\nthen something opened up that we were able to move into a house. The only good thing was that\nhouse had a bathroom, while this house did not have a bathroom, which was nothing unusual not\nto have a bathroom. And -- but there was a sta -- sta -- a stalla -- stall where the -- where the\nCOWS Were going in.",

        "A: Yeah, very, very embarrassing to me, I --I was very upset about it. And anyway, was not easy.\nSo we lived there in that house, and in -- in that town you had to -- you baked your own bread,\nokay? I went to work. I went to work. I started to sew with different dressmakers, they taught me\nhow. Okay, I went to a dressmak -- I couldn\u2019t go to school, we were not allowed to go to school.\nAnd my ma --",
        "A: Because we were Jews. And my mother knew that I like, you know, to work with my hands,\nso she says, how about if you would -- so they accepted me, you know, the dressmakers, and I\nstarted to work for different dressmaker, you know, whenever one needed me, I went there and I\nworked, and I learned, too, you know, while I work. They tried to teach me, and -- ironing, you\nknow, whatever needed to be done. Sf -- finishing -- first it was finishing work, which now\ndoesn\u2019t exist, finishing, the machine finish it. But 1t was all done by hand, you know, finishing,\nand then I made garments, slowly, you know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Going on 11, maybe.",
        "A: 11, yeah. Something like that. Because then I went into the woods, so I know. But --",
        "A: I go every day to this work, and what was bad, we didn\u2019t have much food in the house,\nbecause the Italian people, as wonderful as they are, they were stingy with giving you food,\nokay? Cause they tried to horde whatever they could. So, many times my mother and I walked\nmiles to see by the farmers what they -- what we could get. Like we went -- you\u2019re familiar with\nricotta cheese?",
        "A: They -- wonderful ricotta cheese. Sometimes we had luck that they gave us some. May -- we\nwere ready to pay, we didn\u2019t want for nothing. And sometimes they said they don\u2019t have, or --\nusually at noon they were all, the farmers sitting on a big table having a feast. And we say could\nwe have -- I don\u2019t know, some jelly, some whatever. Oh, we\u2019re just out of it today. You know. I\nwas so hungry, I walked so much, you know. And they just -- some didn\u2019t want to give. Some\ndidn\u2019t want to give. And some made me a sandwich, maybe, and gave it to me. But they were not\n-- the farmers were not that generous. They were more generous, my friends in the ci -- in the\ntown, than the farmers were. Like a potato in one, and something, you know. And I think to this\nday I hate the walking, because I walked so much for nothing, you know. Anyway, it\u2019s a good\nexcuse. And so then -- yeah, we -- I was sewing, and I enjoyed it, different -- yeah, I know what I\nwanted to say. And they always had midday, in the morning, the kids all had something to eat,\nthey brought there stuff to eat. Well, I didn\u2019t always have, you know, so I just walked out,\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to see, and yet I was hungry, you know, children. So once in awhile they\nwould give me something, and -- but most of the time not. And then in the afternoon was the\nsame thing. They were eating in the afternoon. And I had just enough for lunch, I didn\u2019t have\nleftover from. So I was hungry, I was always hungry. But they just didn\u2019t give, you know, so --\none day I was so hungry, and I looked every place in the house for something to eat, and all I\ncould find was an onion, a small onion. And I bit into it like I don\u2019t know what. And I just ate the\nlast thing in the house, that day, you know, the next day we got again something, but just to tell\nyou how hungry I was.",
        "A: You know, children get so hungry. So I was young. Like to say, I wasn\u2019t even 11 yet, I don\u2019t\nthink. Yeah, I was 11 while I was in the woods, so [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah. I remember because of -- got my period in the woods.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I remember that I -- my age. Which was another terrible thing. But anyway,\nbefore I get into the woods, how did we get int -- to the woods? You had to do your own bread,\nokay? Now, you made the bread, and there was one bakery in town, where you call them in the\nevening and you say, I\u2019m making bread, so they come and pick it up and put it in the oven. So\nmy mother called in, went to them that she is making bread. So she says, okay, I'll be there to get\nit in the morning. So they made the bread, and then next thing you know, somebody comes to tell\nus, you better leave right now, cause five o\u2019clock in the morning the Germans are going to be\nhere to pick you up. We don\u2019t have bread, you know, obviously, and one of our Italian friends\ngave us a bread, you know, to take, and my cat, my Muschi, she wanted -- you know, we had to\nleave her, so I left her with a friend. And it was pouring rain. I had open shoes, but that\u2019s all I\nhad, you know. So anyway, we said okay, let\u2019s go. There was two more families there with --\nactually three. Two of them in a different direction -- there was a couple -- like my brother said,\nsomebody Russian. There was a Russian man, Russian Jew. He was married to a Gentile German\nlady, who stuck with him. They were like so tall, and especially I was so little, I thought they\nwere two giant. But they were tall. And they went one way with another couple who had two\nboys from Vienna, they were from Vienna. And we went with a couple with two children. Small\n-- little smaller than me, a boy and a girl, so there\u2019s -- they came with us, in the same place. So\nwe kept on walking and walking and walking, and all of a sudden we were ready to enter the\nwoods, and I hear a cat. My cat followed me into the woods. I don\u2019t know how she got out. And,\nyou know, cats don\u2019t like wet, don\u2019t like rain, she came right in the rain with us. So, of course,\nwith everything else, I had the cat, so I picked her up, I don\u2019t care, you know, I picked her up\nbecause I felt sorry for her. But later on you will see, the cat li -- saved our life. So anyway, I\npick up the cat, and we go into the woods. We have no place to stay, and it\u2019s raining. We had\nlike a tarp, and we put on the floor, and -- to sit on, you know, and it was -- we didn't have much\nfood, the -- these friends gave us some bread, and I don\u2019t know, maybe a piece of cheese, I don\u2019t\nremember what she gave us. But whatever she wa -- she gave us, was wonderful. So in the\nmorning, then we heard later, this woman comes. \u201cMia,\u201d that was my mother, \u201ca far il pane.\u201d\nMake bread. Because she gives you the signal when to make the bread, and then she comes and\npicks it up. Well, Mia\u2019s not answering, and she cannot understand, so she is knocking, and no -- I\n-- that\u2019s what they told us later, she\u2019s knocking and knocking and she runs up, she sees\nsomething is wrong, and she finds we\u2019re gone. And 10 minutes later the Germans were there to\npick us up. And nobody knew, you know, what happened to us. And this woman says she called\nto make bread, that\u2019s impossible, they have to be here. Well, somebody saved our life.",
        "A: Later on we found out who it was. It was a bishop from Grosseto, a bishop that called, I guess\nthe priest of the town, I don\u2019t know who exactly, but he left word for us to leave. So he must\nhave been, you know -- heard or whatever. And boy was he right, you know? He just saved all\nour lives.",
        "A: And we went into the woods, and there was only a couple of people that knew where we were\ngoing, what woods, because there lots of woods. And eventually, while we were there, they\nbrought us some bread, or something, you know.",
        "A: From the town, from Pari, yes.",
        "A: Not -- not people, certain people.",
        "A: Certain people. Certain people -- there was one guy, he would have given his life if somebody\nwould have told him where we are, you know?",
        "A: A Fascist, a real Fascist. But they knew it, and nobody told him where we are. And -- and in\nthose mountains we had people that made coal, carbonia, a -- well, they were coal. And they\nknew us, and they wanted to keep us safe, you know. And once in awhile they gave us, if they\nhad leftover bread or something, they gave us. And then one day they\u2019re sitting around, and here\ncomes the Fascist, and they knew, you know, the Fascist. So they\u2019re talking to him, which I\nheard later, and one of the guys is just there with one of those things that you chop wood with,\nyou know?",
        "A: An axe. And just talked to him, and just does that with the axe, you know, so he got the\npicture that if you talk, or if you don\u2019t behave -- do you know where these Jews are? You know,\nhe was asking. I would like to give them, you know, bring them some food or something. And he\nsaid we have no idea where they are, and he was going, you know -- so you know, we had close\ncalls, very close calls. But nobody spoke, nobody gave us away, where we are. Now --",
        "A: No, no --",
        "A: -- Italian.",
        "A: Oh, the Germans were going to come and pick us up --",
        "A: -- yes, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: An Italian, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And he would have given anything if he could have caught -- catch us. I don\u2019t know\nwhy, we didn\u2019t do anything to him, but it was a Fascist, a -- we didn\u2019t do anything to the Nazis\neither, but they did to us. So anyway, nobody spoke, and then we had a very hard time. Finally,\nthey helped us build a shack, just to have a little, you know, protection from the weather. And it\nwas like from the trees, the branches, made from branches, cause these people knew how to do\nthat, and they helped us, the people that -- the coal miners. And then you had to take from the\nearth, and you know, fill in, and then they made like beds from th -- from the branches, and then\nput straw on it, you know, to lay on it, but a -- small. And we were trying to be close. And one\nturned, the other one had to turn, you know what I mean? It was so hard, because you know,\nbranches are not -- nothing is smooth, and the straw was falling right through. Anyway --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a great situation, but 1t was a little bit -- you know, we were real prepared for the bad\nweather, because it was snowing, too. And you had to whisper the whole time, cause in the\nwoods your voice carries, far away, you know?",
        "A: Inside --",
        "A: -- in this thing, and the first night, in fact, the thing, the roof fell in, so all the men -- the two\nmen and my brother and the other boy, all night had to sit with something to hold it up, you\nknow, the roof up. We couldn\u2019t make much of a fire because we didn\u2019t want anybody to see the\nsmoke. During the day was completely a no-no with the fire, but in the night we tried to do little\nbit open fire to keep a little warm, you know? And we still had the cat. And the cat disappeared,\nand I was beside myself, the Germans killed my cat, they took my cat. But she found herself a\nboyfriend.",
        "A: And she came -- she came home pregnant.",
        "A: Yeah. That we didn\u2019t need, believe me. So she came home pregnant and had four little\nkittens.",
        "A: So then we got -- we asked this guy that brought us food to leave the -- the cha -- the little\nbasket, so we can put in, you know. And then he had to find us someone to want the little -- after\n-- you know, after awhile, to take them. And she was just marching behind, you know, her\nkittens, when we were moving from place to place, cause we never tried to stay too long in one\nplace. Even when we came to sleep and we always tried to go away from the place, and watch\nwho goes by and --",
        "A: -- you know, we were constantly in fear, constantly. We never knew. And then there were\nbombardments, and we were next to a river, and it sounded -- you know the sound was so harsh,\nor strong. And we thought always, we\u2019re next, you know, they\u2019re gonna bombard us next. But it\ndidn\u2019t happen, but the fear was constant, the fear was constant. And whispering. Then one day,\nthis couple, that Russian couple, she, poor woman, got hysterical, you know, from all of the stuff\ngoing on. I don\u2019t know what she was, but she started to scream. And that\u2019s the worst thing you\ncan do in -- in the woods. So he tried to calm her down and everything, but, you know, she went\nthrough a lot of stress, and she probably was thinking, why am I here? You know, I have no\nreason, but she stuck it out, but she just lost it. And we were -- so we had to move from there\nright away, cause we thought, uh-oh. And another thing what was having, they had a forest fires.\nSo we were worried about that, you know, that\u2019s it\u2019s gonna -- we could feel, you know, the heat\nfrom the fire. So again we were on the run. Constantly on the run, in the woods, in the rain, in the\nheat. And oh, was -- one day it was snowing so hard. And we were without anything. We didn\u2019t\nhave a piece of bread, we didn\u2019t have anything to eat. So we thought, okay we\u2019ll just -- you\nknow, nothing you can do. And here comes this man, this blessed man.",
        "A: He\u2019s the one that a -- that brought us food --",
        "A: -- before. He was really not from Pari, he was from the big city, he was what they called\nsfolato. When -- when they started to bombard the big cities, they all came to the small town. We\nhad a lot of people from Pisa. In fact, I fell in love with a guy from Pisa. And he was -- but he\nwas from Siena, I think. And he was wonderful, can you believe it? The biggest snow, here\ncomes this man. He says, \u201cI knew you didn\u2019t have.\u201d An angel. Angel.\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: Dario.",
        "A: Ye -- yeah, he lived in Pari because he was from the city and I think he had some relatives in\nPari, and that\u2019s how he got to Pari.",
        "A: I think -- wait a minute, I think word was sent to him where we are. You see, I -- I had one --\none change of clothes, I didn\u2019t have much, but we had a big oversea case, you know, one of\nthose wooden things that we left at the church. The priest took it in for us. So when we need a\npiece of something, somebody went there and got it, and brought it to us. And this other couple\nthat was with us, was -- this woman there was about my size, only she was taller, she was a\nwoman, I was a child, so -- but that\u2019s besides the point. Anyway, I was -- my skirt was getting --\nnot that I was getting so tall, but still I was growing, and my skirt was getting shorter and shorter.\nSo it was not a good thing, you know? Anyway that\u2019s that. Okay.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s not hard to get a cat in Italy.",
        "A: No. Lots of cats. And -- and we got her, you know, somebody gave her to me when she was a\nlittle kitten, and you know, it was just perfect. Wherever you went there was a cat, so I had a cat\nof my own, which was great. But we all loved Muschi, everybody loved Muschi, and -- except\nour people that were in the roo -- in the thing with us didn\u2019t like it because she stole some food\nfrom them. But she put it under the be -- under the thing. I mean, they know we have a cat, so\nwhy did they put it under there? Anyway.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Muschi.",
        "A: She was a gray cat with white. She was perfect.",
        "A: She was perfect, just beautiful cat. I always promised her I\u2019Il take her to the United States\nwith me. And I would have, had she survived. But see, with all the bombardments and with all\nthe shooting, she went wild.",
        "A: Sh-She turned wild. I was holding her when we were liberated -- getting ahead of myself, but\nwe were liberate -- I was carrying her because a lot of dogs and other animals came, so I figured\nshe might be afraid. So I h-held her. And then she si -- this dog barked at her and she jumped off\nmy hand and scratched me from here to here, which she never, ever did, from fear, and she went\nback to where we stayed, the farmers told us that they saw her. And that is quite a trip she took\nback, I guess looking for us, poor cat. But she couldn\u2019t -- and we told them, you know, if you\never see her, please, you know, we want her back. But the farmer said they never saw her again.\nShe just kept on looking for us and looking for us, I guess. So I couldn\u2019t keep my promise and\nbring her.",
        "A: Which was very hard.",
        "A: Because as we got into the woods -- I told you that she saved our life --",
        "A: -- cause finally we got away from wherever we were, far away, and there was a farmhouse, an\nempty farmhouse. I don\u2019t know if it was a farmhouse -- anyway, was a -- was a building, okay,\nwhere they stored hay and everything for the animals. And they had a lot of cherry trees around\nthere, so we have, you know, food. And so we went in there, we were two -- by then we were\ntwo couples, you know, the other couple with two children and -- and us. And Muschi was with\nus, and I look at Muschi, and she\u2019s looking in -- in a direction. And I\u2019m following her eyes,\nthere\u2019s four German soldiers coming our way.",
        "A: And she\u2019s looking --",
        "A: -- looking. But I could see the -- where she was looking, thank God she is looking 1n the right\ndirection. And just sat there, you know, and looked. So I told -- you know, everybody, they are\nhere. So the men got out of that building, which was him, his son, and my brother, my father,\nfour of them jumped out of the building, and we didn\u2019t know where they were going, but out.\nAnd we quickly -- I put on a kerchief, you know, I made myself really look like -- all of us like\nfarmers, we\u2019re all farmers. Course we didn\u2019t speak German, you know, or anything. And all of a\nsudden, we hear a gunshot. A gunshot, we didn\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t know if somebody shot us,\nand we didn\u2019t know if someone shot them. So then here they come to the door, the Germans to\nour door. And they say something in German, and we just said [indecipherable] you know, like\nwe don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. But then they say -- one says to the other, you idiot,\nyou didn\u2019t kill the cat. Thank God. They were shooting at the cat, and as they were talking, the\ncat came running inside, see? So we were relieved that they didn\u2019t kill the cat, and thank God\nthey didn\u2019t shoot at the men. But the men didn\u2019t know that yet, okay? So they left. They left. We\nwere not important, they left. They saw there was nothing but hay there, and [indecipherable]. So\nthen, we could hardly wait for the men to see -- so here they come, God, all in one piece, you\nknow, with like -- but we knew we had to leave that place. So what we did, outside that house,\nwe made room for our pictures. We buried the pictures, and my dad knew shorthand, and he\nwrote shorthand every day of our stay in the woods, the whole life he wrote in shorthand. So he\nput that down there, and pictures of ours from family, you know, whatever we had. I don\u2019t think\nthere was money. Whatever -- anyway, we all buried it. And we figure, but -- you know, pretty\ndown deep so it shouldn\u2019t get wet. And we left there, and we went -- you know, inside the woods\na long different direction. And then -- trying to think, you know what happened first, it\u2019s hard to\nremember. Went there, and we buried that, and then -- and then we went on. Which was a big\nmistake, cause we got caught in the middle of shooting, the Germans -- and the French liberated\nus, the French and the Moroccans. And they were shooting at each other, and we were in the\nmiddle. Okay? The French -- we finally saw a Frenchman, and we\u2019re so happy, and he says, go\naway, go away. And we didn\u2019t know why he say -- tell us to go away. You know, you\u2019re so\nstupid sometimes. Anyway, all of a sudden we\u2019re just in the middle of all this fighting going on.\nAnd my poor dad and mom wanted to protect us, so they each laid on us. Dad laid on me, and\nMom laid on my brother, so that things shouldn\u2019t hit us. We laid there for hours. And then\nfinally, it\u2019s kind of stopped, so we kind of thought, let\u2019s go back to the house and get our stuff\nand get out of -- out of here. So when we got to the house, everything was -- they ripped the\npictures, whoever found. See, they thought maybe we had money that we buried. Mut --\nsomebody must have seen us do that, but they thought maybe it was money and when that wasn\u2019t\nmoney, they was mad, so they ripped things, you know. And so my Dad\u2019s -- all that writing\nwent, and we lost a lot of pictures, which we were holding onto like dear life, okay?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: Nothing was still okay, everything was torn apart. And yeah, the pictures of grandparents, you\nknow, and the brothers and sisters. So then we went, and all of a sudden -- we got out of the\nhouse, we figured well, you know, we\u2019ll go and see what -- which side we\u2019re gonna go on, we\ndidn\u2019t know where to go. So one of the Moroccans here got -- one of them are on the mule -- on\nthose big mules, and they are up there, and we\u2019re down here. And they point to me, and they\npoint to the other lady, the mother of the other, she was still a younger woman, blonde, you\nknow. And she wants us -- she want -- he wants us to go with him. So we all started to cry, you\nknow? My mother is on her knees, begging. The kids are crying. I mean, it was a scene. And\nwe're trying to think what to give him, he shouldn\u2019t take us, you know? And my mother had the\nwedding ring. So she says here, you want this do -- and there were no -- not much conversation\nbecause they -- they didn\u2019t understand each other, but I think with hands and movements you\ncould tell what we were about. So Mother takes off that, and my brother had a watch, so -- and\ntook off the watch to give to him. He took it. He took it. So we didn\u2019t know, are we safe now, or\nwhat does he want, you know? And he\u2019s still pointing to me and her. And my mother grow\nhysterical, you know? Being liberated and not liberated. So finally there were like some cows\nthere on the field. And somehow he -- he said to us, okay, you can have the cows, or some --\nthat\u2019s how we understood, you know, we don\u2019t know what he said. And they all have gold teeth,\nyou know, and they\u2019re so disgusting, you know, they\u2019re not -- the beards, and oh, horrible\nlooking. Anyway, he left. He left. My mother faints.",
        "A: So we got her, you know, going. Said, we have to leave this place. Then the other lady -- my\nskirt was up to here, you know? So she gave me one of her skirts, which covered me, and a\nblouse with long sleeves. You know, they made me look, you know, unattractive as possible.\nAnd a-again, you know, scarf on the head, anything they could do to make me look bad. So I\nsaid, okay, we are going. And we started to walk towards a town, different town. And we\u2019re\ngoing, and all of a sudden here\u2019s this guy.",
        "A: The same guy. My poor mom, she passed out again.",
        "A: She passed out again. I thought this time she died. I was sure she\u2019s gone. Anyway, he rode --\nhe rode away.",
        "A: He ro -- he didn\u2019t -- he said something, but don\u2019t ask me what, and he rode away. And we\nrushed to a farmhouse, where we knew partisans usually, you know, met, or I don\u2019t know what\nwe knew. Anyway, we go there, and they have surrounded the -- that room, that house. The\nMoroccans, they surrounded that house, barefoot, you know, they come and sneak up on you. I\nmean, it\u2019s a horrible thing. And we finally opened the door and got in and here are the partisans\ninside. And I am hysterical. And then -- til then I was fine. And when I saw them, I got hi -- I -- I\nreally lost it, I was hysterical crying to them. They were so sweet and so nice. They assured me\neverything will be okay, you know, and stuff like that. Was horrible. So then they left, the -- the\nguys left.",
        "A: The Moroccans --",
        "A: -- left. And they kind of helped us to get into a town that was not too far from the woods, and\n-- which we did. In fear every step of the way. We were liberated, and not liberated. You\nunderstand?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know if -- if they\u2019re coming back, or if they -- we didn\u2019t know what they were\ngonna do. They could have shot us, they could have -- and they could have shot my parents and\nthen taken us, and you know, we just didn\u2019t know what they were gonna do. Because for 24\nhours the Moroccan had free hand, they can do whatever they want to women. And they did a lot\nof damage. They were very, very rude, very mean. So we were lucky that we -- we got away\nwith that.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t --",
        "A: I know it wasn\u2019t good. I know it wasn\u2019t good to go with this guy. And I wouldn\u2019t want to go\nwith this guy, I knew that. Gosh, I knew it. But of course, I didn\u2019t see as much danger as my\nparents did, you know? Oh, it was horrible. And that -- that was our liberation, don\u2019t forget. And\nthen, I could not stand to see a soldier, I was afraid of every soldier I saw.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t matter what soldier --",
        "A: -- they were. I was afraid. We finally stopped in a town where we got a little break and\nwashed up, and some people gave us some food, you know. Was not Pari, was town before Pari,\nbut they helped us, you know? And we walked all the time, just walk and walk and walk.",
        "A: We tried to get to Pari --",
        "A: -- Pari, yeah. But I don\u2019t --",
        "A: Yeah, and we have our stuff there still, and --",
        "A: It was actually -- was the Siena woods, not Grosseto woods.",
        "A: We went into Siena woods. We just kept walking, we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, we just\nkept walking.",
        "A: Yes, they were --",
        "A: They remained with us all the way through. The -- the Russian, which is why -- they went to a\ndifferent woods. They went somebody else, and the other couple from Vienna, with two boys, I\nunderstand that the Germans too -- found one of the boys. He tried to, you know, talk his way out\nof that he\u2019s from the farm, you know, and I don\u2019t really know whatever happened to them. Lost\ncontact, cause they didn\u2019t come back to Pari, so it was just rumor, we didn\u2019t know exactly --",
        "A: -- what happened. And they were sad. In fact, one was Heinz --",
        "A: -- one of the boys was Heinz, and one was Walter. The boys, you know. And so I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to them. But we went back to Pari, and then we\u2019re waiting to get to America,\nstill. Again, you know. And then my dad wo -- my brother, they took the bus to Grosseto, to talk\nto the American, you know, for the liberation, whatever. And my dad says they were\ninterrogating him, and my brother -- you did this, ooh, ooh, ooh. And my dad says to my brother,\n\u201cThis idiot thinks we\u2019re spies.\u201d In German.",
        "A: In German.",
        "A: But he understood German, so he started to laugh. So, you know. Then we got -- he got some\npapers, and -- that we were okay to go, that we were not spies, by no means. I know I\u2019m leaving\nsomething out, but I can\u2019t think --",
        "A: -- yeah, ask me, ask me question, yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have anything.",
        "A: My mother -- there are men here, that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Pll ignore them.",
        "A: My mother took off her slip and tore it apart so that I should have something.",
        "A: And they had a river where we went to wash things. But always afraid who is seeing, you\nknow.",
        "A: I could never really wash myself because I always thought somebody sitting in -- in the tree,\nyou know? And I never felt clean enough, you know. And it was so embarrassing to me, so\nembarrassing, oh.",
        "A: Not a great deal.",
        "A: A little bit I was told, but not in my imagination --",
        "A: -- did I think --",
        "A: -- this was happening to me. You know, and I was only 11, don\u2019t forget.",
        "A: Quite young.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t get it at the very beginning. I didn\u2019t get it at the very beginning, I got it little\nlater.",
        "A: But -- and always the wrong time. Whe -- when is the right time, you know, but always the\nwrong time. And I was terribly upset with it because I just had a hard time to handle. And the\nother girl that was with us, she was jealous because she wanted. I said you stupid.",
        "A: She wanted to --",
        "A: -- she felt more grown up, I guess. Was almost 12, I guess --",
        "A: -- when I got it, but more 11 than --",
        "A: Yeah, she was.",
        "A: They must have. Never told me.",
        "A: Never knew.",
        "A: Never knew. They\u2019re unbelievable what they did in those days.",
        "A: Gos --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right, yes.",
        "A: Oh, it was --",
        "A: Oh, awful, awful, awful. Really awful. So -- and don\u2019t forget, I couldn\u2019t wash my hair,\ncouldn\u2019t brush my teeth, didn\u2019t have anything.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t have -- we had the little soap, somebody wa -- was shaving soap, you know, with like\na tube. And that was the only soap. It\u2019s a miracle I didn\u2019t have lice because I -- my hair was long,\nyou know.",
        "A: Long, I had braids, braided hair.",
        "A: But there was no way to wash it.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t --",
        "A: -- maybe I\u2019m so -- was so used to the smell that it didn\u2019t smell, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Maybe. I did not remember any terrible smell, you know, for some reason.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: By the Germans, by the Germans.",
        "A: With the Italians, they were --",
        "A: -- you know --",
        "A: -- they were together in cahoots.",
        "A: There was one incident when a -- before I -- we left into the woods. Pari was again, you\nknow, round. Up on a hill and round. So I\u2019m there by a friend at the beginning of Pari, and the\nhighway, like the street, you know, were cars, two cars that come, come up the street, and I\u2019m\nstanding there with her and I\u2019m watching the road to see if somebody\u2019s coming. And sure\nenough, four soldiers. They were always walking in four, I don\u2019t know why. Four German\nsoldiers g -- are coming. So I was like -- that was before the woods. I was like stuck to the floor,\nyou know? I didn\u2019t know run back in or run back out or what do I do? So I just stood there, and -\n- and the farmer, they were talking to one of the guys down there, and he goes like this. I feel he\nis pointing at me. So I\u2019m really paralyzed now, but I don\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I\nstayed there and they\u2019re coming up, they\u2019re coming up and they\u2019re asking me where is a bar?",
        "A: Bar.",
        "A: Bar. So I figured, what do I do? They told them that I speak German, maybe. Do I answer\nGerman, do I answer in Italian. Are they testing me? I did not know. So I said, ober dar, you\nknow, like broken German, like I knew, and they went away and then they kind of looked back,\nlike thinking, what did she say, you know? Again, I was panicking. I ran back in the house,\nfinally. I was so worried, you know, that I did the wrong thing when I didn\u2019t know what to do,\nyou know? Cause the way he pointed, I think that he pointed at me.",
        "A: He couldn\u2019t talk to these people, so he pointed at me. Oh my God. That\u2019s one of -- another\none of those fear-y things.",
        "A: Yeah, it turned out okay.",
        "A: They went to the bar, hope they --",
        "A: They got drunk, and other things.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: In the forest.",
        "A: Hunger, a lot of hunger. Always scared that somebody\u2019s gonna discover us. Broken up\nbecause the sleep, and again, going to the bathroom. Don\u2019t forget, you had to go into the woods,\nyou know. And I was one to be sure everybody\u2019s here, nobody is going where I\u2019m going.",
        "A: I wanted privacy.",
        "A: And then you never knew who was gonna be out there, either. It was very, very difficult,\nanother difficult time. And what else? Waiting for food, worrying about my Muschi, and just\nworrying about everything, you know, I was always worrying about things.",
        "A: We got along pretty good --",
        "A: -- with this family. I really cannot say that we had any -- the only time we had really a fight\nwas because of the cat.",
        "A: Cause they finally had some meat and the cat took it, and not only that, brought her boyfriend\nin to help her eat it.",
        "A: Well, for awhile we thought we lost her.",
        "A: We thought we lost her, and then here she comes, home pregnant, just like a bad girl.",
        "A: No, she was a good girl. No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no.",

        "A: Then she [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, you see she followed us in the worst weather --",
        "A: -- so she felt good with us, but she just was a bad girl.",
        "A: Found a boyfriend and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a very sore subject. I had religious beliefs because I was told to have religious\nbeliefs. I had to, you know, go to synagogue, and when I went to synagogue -- we went to\nsynagogue where the women were upstairs, the men downstair, that was my grandparents, you\nknow. They were kosher. But my mother never wa -- believed in it. She was a rebel then, to the\nend. And -- but she didn\u2019t disturb their kitchen or anything. But when we went out, or when she\nwent out -- you don\u2019t go out to eat in Vienna that much. But when she did go out, she did not eat\nkosher food, okay? But she -- she respected whatever the hou --",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t even tear the toilet paper on Shabbes. You know, had to be done Friday, cause\nyou\u2019re not supposed to tear. And when I drove my mother crazy the whole week I didn\u2019t want to\ndo anything, but came Saturday, I wanted to knit, I wanted to sew, I wanted to clean. Drove her\nnuts. The whole week you don\u2019t want to do and s -- come Saturday, you want to do it.",
        "A: Yes. Grandparents, or even when I was with Mother visiting, or whatever.",
        "A: Wherever I was --",
        "A: I was a problem. They never let me do what I wanted to do. And -- but they were wonderful\ngrandparents, wonderful. So were my parents were wonderful grandparents, too, I must say.",
        "A: Too good. They gave everything to their grandkids, they loved the grandkids. So I guess it\u2019s -\n- okay you asked me about belief.",
        "A: I thought -- you know, I never gave it much thought as a child. I knew I was Jewish, and I\nwas Jewish. Big deal, I\u2019m thinking now. I didn\u2019t have to go through all of that, you know, but\nI\u2019m Jewish, I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t believe in miracles, you know. I don\u2019t know what else I would believe\nin if it wasn\u2019t Jewish. I don\u2019t believe in a lot of things. You know, they all say the Bible, the\nBible is a wonderful thing. But it\u2019s written by people. God didn\u2019t write the Bible, you know?\nThat\u2019s what I always feel. So what else am I gonna believe? I\u2019m not over religious, I\u2019m not. And\nI think -- for some reason I\u2019m not, which I cannot completely say. I can\u2019t say.",

        "A: Yes, he carried the Tefillin and everything.",
        "A: But then, you know, he got away from it because he married a non-Jewish girl who did not\nbelieve in what he believes, which is okay, but went a little bit about it the wrong way, okay, and\nhurt us all a little bit too much. What can I tell you? So there\u2019s not too much to argue about there.",
        "A: I think the reason I didn\u2019t have much of a belief, because of what happened to my brother. I\nthink that\u2019s kind of -- kind of upset me so much, and what happened to my parents, such\ndisappointment that they had. And -- and they didn't even ask for what they were accused of\nasking for. So anyway, I don\u2019t want to tell you.",

The people that we knew, not -- there were some son-of-a-gun that wanted to have\nour neck, okay, the heck with them. But most people were helpful, most people were\nunderstanding. They were wonderful, that\u2019s all I can tell you. They warned us, you know. They\nfed us whenever they could. Now there were some people that had, but didn\u2019t want to show that\nthey have, so they didn\u2019t give, and -- cause they were afraid for themselves, maybe. I don\u2019t\nknow.

And my\nfather was in -- kitchen employed. I was in the kitchen employed to give out cards so people\nshouldn\u2019t double up on their food, see because they came twice, if it\u2019s leftover, they were\nwelcome, but not take away from somebody else the first one.",

        "A: Well, we had little rooms --",
        "A: -- on top where the dressing rooms were for the stars, okay? So we -- being that we were\nworking in Cinecitta, we got the rooms. There were a lot of people there, had to live in big -- in\nthe big rooms with divisions.",
        "A: Like tents, drapes and something like that. But we were lucky that we were able to get -- they\nu -- we Started out there, but then they let us move up. And then when my brother got married, he\ngot a room, too. A different place, but he got a room, too.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",

        "A: He was friends -- friends with my brother, there was a whole clique of them, whole bunch of\ntroublemakers, including my brother, who was the instigator.",
        "A: Yes, he was instigating, but he never did, you know? He was, let them do the dirty work. Was\nhim and the guy that still, you know, lives in Kansas City, who also is from Vienna, name of\nHeinz Winkler. And --",
        "A: Some trouble. I mean, stupid kid\u2019s trouble, you know, no big troubles. But there was one\ncrazy woman on the hall, and they made her a little crazier, you know, and stuff like that. Just\nmischief.",
        "A: Nothing serious, mischief. I think my husband will be able to tell you more about all the\nmischief, yeah.",

        "A: Not always, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, it hard, very hard, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t think much because I always felt my parents protecting me in every way, you\nknow. As long as I had them, I didn\u2019t worry.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t remember ever doing that. I don\u2019t re -- my mother was very strict. I couldn\u2019t wear\nlipstick til I was 18. I couldn\u2019t date, forget about dating, my God. I took a picture with a friend, a\nguy, and I did like -- held my head like this against him. I thought the roof was gonna cave in.\nWith a strange guy you\u2019re taking a picture like that? I had fur coat on, fur coat -- m-mouton --\nmouton --",
        "A: -- do you remember mouton?",
        "A: That was terrible -- it was good coat, warm, but don\u2019t ever let it rain on you, cause you smell\nlike crazy. So anyway, I was holding like this, and oh she had a fit. You know, stupid things like\nthat, she -- and now don\u2019t stay out too late, you know, I can\u2019t sleep if you\u2019re not here. Every\nSaturday night I heard that.",
        "A: Yes, in New York, in New York already.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, always in the DP camp. I was -- I loved to dance, just loved to dance, and the first --\nI was 13 in camp, when this soldier, a British soldier in fact, took me to dance. So I danced, it\nwas nice, you know, I started to make different steps which I didn\u2019t really know. And he was so\npatient, he was so nice, he was not fresh, he was a gentleman. And the trouble was he left, and I\ncould only dance with him, I thought, you know. That\u2019s how silly a person is. So then another\nguy wanted to dance with me, so I said, I can\u2019t dance with you, you dance different, I can\u2019t dance\nwith you. Oh yes, you can. So then he took me to dance. Okay, so I danced with this guy. But\nthen there was this great dancer. He was a black guy, not American black, from Abyssinia,\nEthiopia now. He was wonderful. He was Fred Astaire. And he really taught me to dance. I was\nthe first one on the dance floor, the last one off. He was terrific. And except that he was black,\nhis features were white, you know? And he spoke perfect Italian. And you know, just a dancing\npartner. So my parents said, look, we\u2019re going down to dance, we\u2019ll be with you, I don\u2019t want\nyou to dance with him all the time. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have to dance with him at all if you don\u2019t want\nme to dance,\u201d you know. Fresh little me. So I stuck close to them, I made believe I don\u2019t see\nhim. So this guy was smarter than me or them, came over and said -- you know, greeted my\nparents nicely and said, \u201cDo you mind if your dau -- 1f your daughter dances with me?\u201d Put them\non the spot, and I had to dance again.",
        "A: So that was good, yeah.",
        "A: That was good. And that was, you know. But then he left, and then my mother-in-law -- at\nthat time I had no idea it was gonna be my mother-in-law, there was a Hungarian guy in camp\nthey wanted to dance with me. I could not stand him. I absolutely could not stand him. And my\nmother-in-law kept on talking to him, giving him ideas how he could endear himself to me. And\ntalked to him, you know, Hungarian, they were Hungarian. And he kept on bugging me. He was\n-- he took a job cleaning the hallways in Cinecitta so he could see me, you know, in my room\nand when I come out. I didn\u2019t come out. I didn\u2019t want to come out. And when I went to the\ndance, he came over, kissed the hand, you know. Very polite guy. He wanted to dance with me.\nYou know, I was mean enough to say no.",
        "A: I did. That\u2019s how I could not stand him. I was -- washed the floor in our room, and I took the\npail to go to the bathroom to spill it out, he was there, he wanted to do it. I didn\u2019t want him to do\nit. I didn\u2019t want him anywhere near me. I think my mother-in-law knew something. She tried to\nget rid of me a long time ago, it didn\u2019t work. No, we had a good relations -- his mother lived with\nme for 40 years.",
        "A: Yes. He lived -- she was -- she lived til she was 96.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s good we got along. My father-in-law died a little younger, and then her sister came from\nItaly, and she stayed with us. And they both died the same year.",
        "A: It was sad. So we got along, but I reminded her of what she was doing to me --",
        "A: -- with Mr. kiss the hand.",
        "A: Laughs, you know, it was so funny. [indecipherable] it\u2019s not funny, I was miserable. You\nmade me so miserable. She did, but she didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah, it was an okay place to be. How can I say, how can I explain it? The boys had a\nwonderful time.",
        "A: The boys did, more than -- more than the girls. I mean, certain girls had a ball too, but I was\nnot brought up to have a good time. I had to be a good girl all the time.",
        "A: And to this day, shoot.",
        "A: Yes, I resent that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t get out even -- I just couldn\u2019t get out of it. She demanded. She demanded that I be a\ngood girl.",
        "A: So I cow -- I obliged, yeah. You can\u2019t go back, you know?",
        "A: And I didn\u2019t want to be bad, but I wanted a little more freedom. Not every time. And then\ncame Sunday morning. My cute little nephews woke me up every Sunday morning. They could\nhardly wait to have me home. And then snuck in bed with me, and then my mother invited\nbachelors that didn\u2019t have family, for lunch on Sunday.",
        "A: We\u2019re talking about New York --",
        "A: -- so I had to get up, because the house had to be clean, and lunch had to be made, and the\nkids had to be fed. And I loved those kids. I loved them so much. And then she came along, you\nknow my niece?",
        "A: Zenie.",

        "A: My father started to be a busboy.",
        "A: But then he worked for Globe factory, which they made pie fillings and jellies.",
        "A: Yeah, which was not easy either. When he started he was in the cooking [indecipherable].\nThen later he worked himself up in shipping, so at least he didn\u2019t have to be in that heat.",
        "A: You know, was so hot there. And he was a shipping clerk. I guess they would say clerk.",
        "A: Bless you. And he -- he was there all the time, yeah. Then the factory moved from Brooklyn\nto Jersey and he moved with them. Yeah, and that\u2019s wi --",

        "A: My version is that they s -- they came here after us, right, in \u00b049.",
        "A: So, I think he looked in the phone book for Arzt, the name. And he found Arzt. Then he\ncalled up us, and then of course we wanted to see them right away, and we made arrangements to\nsee them. And my husband thinks because they were in the paper that we saw the paper, and got\nahold of them, but it wasn\u2019t like that, but it\u2019s okay, either story 1s okay. But I think I\u2019m right.",

Every day, will\nyou marry me. So -- and I was so tired. Then my mother said, \u201cYou\u2019re driving him crazy, just\nmake up your mind.\u201d I said, \u201cI did make up my mind, but he doesn\u2019t leave my mind alone.\u201d So --\nand everybody, you know, liked him, and they liked me and what do you mean, you belong\ntogether. I said, no. I was fighting and fighting it, but --",
        "A: Yeah. And in -- now I\u2019m really talking. The morning -- no, the morning before our wedding,\nthe day before our wedding, I got a letter from my ex-boyfriend wishing me well, and -- a very\nlovely letter saying how nice it was to know me, and blah, blah, blah. And my mother brings the\nletter just when my husband is there -- who wasn\u2019t my husband yet. So nosy wants to know. So\nhere, read it. I mean, it\u2019s nothing wrong what he wrote. You send this letter back to him. Why?\nHe has no business writing you a letter. I said, he\u2019s just has good wishes for us, why not? I don\u2019t\nwant the letter. You don\u2019t have the letter, I have -- anyway, back and forth and back and forth.\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t send the letter back. So he says, you don\u2019t send the letter back, I don\u2019t want to\nmarry you. I said, it\u2019s a deal. You don\u2019t want to marry me, fine. Okay, we\u2019ll talk tonight, you\ncome over to his family --",
        "A: -- and we\u2019ll see what his cousin -- he relied a lot on his cousin, older cousin, see what he says.\nI said, okay, take -- I brought the letter, I let George read it. George said, nothing wrong with the\nletter, you know. And he 1s hysterical with this letter. So I said, here George, you keep the letter,\nbut I\u2019m not sending it back. Anyway, said goodnight, you want to go -- okay, Pll see you\ntomorrow, maybe. So then --",
        "A: And then in the morning he called me up and aggravates me yet about the letter. So I said,\nyou better stop, don\u2019t want to hear it, you want to get married? Yeah, but you should, you know,\nit\u2019s not right, and blah, blah, blah. So I hung up on him. The morning of our wedding, I hung up\non him, okay? But I knew he was gonna come around, so I did get dressed, you know? Can you\nsee the picture of all that?",
        "A: So anyway, I got dressed, and you\u2019re not familiar with New York, are you?",

Very nice, you know,\nnot -- they had everything ready for me, I didn\u2019t have to get a -- a rabbi, not a hazzan, a singer, a\nmusic, they arranged everything. The food, wonderful, kosher from top to bottom, and so cheap,\nyou know. Now it\u2019s -- would be like nothing, you know, but for us it was sort of expensive, you\nknow. So anyway we had this wonderful wedding, and the guy said, well you don\u2019t have to\nworry because we had guards at the door if the groom wants to run away. I said, \u201cI think you\nmight need guards for me, not for him.\u201d Oh. So anyway, we got married, obviously.",
        "A: Had a lot of fights in between, but we\u2019re still here.",

        "A: Yeah, and they came. Even on the bus, you know, couldn\u2019t afford really to fly them, four or\nfive of them, so Mother was schlepping on that bus, poor woman. She wanted to come, you\nknow, and be with me too. And --",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: And stuff like that. So --",
        "A: I did adjust to Kansas City.",
        "A: I like Kansas City. I\u2019m very glad I did not move back --",

        "A: And we were not -- well, we were on the same road with Truman. And we had an apartment\nthere with my in-laws, of course. And they were very nice to me, and they loved me, and I loved\nthem. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t always easy.",
        "A: You know? It wasn\u2019t easy for them probably either. But -- you don\u2019t have much privacy,\nthat\u2019s the only thing.",
        "A: But you have a good cook.",
        "A: Yeah, a good cook.",
        "A: Yeah, I did. My first job was in -- see, I never worked in a factory. I always worked in New\nYork, custom made clothes. And -- fine clothes, you know?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know what a factory is. And then when I came he -- to Kansas City they didn\u2019t have\ncustom made stuff.",
        "A: There was only one store and they didn\u2019t need anybody, you know? Alterations I never did, I\ndidn\u2019t know. So I went to work at a factory that was making maternity clothes. And I started\nthere -- was my first job there. I started to work there in the biggest heat. That year, in \u201954,\nKansas City had the biggest heat. And I\u2019m in the factory, I thought I\u2019d die. I didn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] and you know, they don\u2019t have air condition. The fans going, that just gave you\na headache. It was very, very hard time ahead. So I tried to, after awhile -- the boss was very nice\nto me, in fact at first, you know, he gave me a certain how much he\u2019s gonna pay. But then when\nhe saw me, he gave me a little more, which is good. And then I started to look for other jobs. But\nI just couldn\u2019t get used to the factory work. So then this lady calls me, and she says, do you do\nalterations? And th -- from the Jewish vocational service. I said, no, I never did alterations. Well,\nyou know how to sew? Yes. You want to try? I said, I don\u2019t know. I know I don\u2019t like factory.\nDo you know how to shorten sleeves? I said, I should know how to shorten sleeve. Well, mens\u2019s\nsleeves. So I said, you know, I never shorten a man\u2019s sleeve. So she says, why don\u2019t you come\nin, try, okay? We need some help, try, see how it works. Okay. I went to try and stayed there 15\nyears. There\u2019s no hope for me. So they wouldn\u2019t let me go. Shin -- he showed me once, you\nknow, how you -- men\u2019s little different. But if you know how to sew, it\u2019s not that difficult.",
        "A: And so I wound up doing most of the women\u2019s stuff, besides po -- besides shortening sleeves\nfor the men\u2019s coat. And they were very fond of me, and were nice to me except for the money,\nthey were not too generous. He was a Polish refugee who married an American girl, Jewish girl\nin Kansas City. And he was good to me, very good, but the money was a different story, he was\nstingy. So then everybody said why don\u2019t you go on your own, why do you have to work for\nhim. And I wanted to get out, I tell you why. He was very nice, but he got ill, you know? And it\nupset me that he was ill, and he was nervous. So I figure, maybe it\u2019s time to leave, cause he is\nnot going to be able to work much longer, and besides, you know, I just -- maybe they\u2019re right,\nmaybe I should go on my own. So then a friend of mine said that she would go in with me, that\nshe would, you know. So -- and that\u2019s how I opened up a business. We found a spot, a store, and\nwe open it up, and of course anybody that came to s -- to s -- him and say where\u2019s Evie, he didn\u2019t\nknow where I went. Cause he knew, but I mean, he didn\u2019t know. He would say, I don\u2019t know. I\ndon\u2019t know where she 1s. He was very, very upset that I left, you know. Because he could go on\nvacation and leave me, you know, he -- he trusted me, and so it hur -- I understand that he was\nupset that I left, but after all, I had to live too. So I went into business, 29 years.",
        "A: No, alterations.",
        "A: I did a few -- I snuck a few custom clothes in, but it\u2019s hard to do both. You have to do one or\nthe other because you need different spots, and a different table, different machine. And you\nneed too much patience, which at the end I\u2019m not -- I didn\u2019t have any more. But I still have\nenough patience, people still come to me. See, the trouble is with custom made clothes, they see\na paper, you know a magazine, and they think, I want that, they think they\u2019re gonna look like the\nmagazine.",
        "A: Well, they\u2019re not going to look like the magazine. So then they start to pick. I think this sleeve\nis a quarter of an inch, or maybe just an eighth of an inch too long. And they make you, you\nknow, do it over for nothing.",
        "A: You know, just because it\u2019s custom made, so they think they have to. So I said, no, I don\u2019t\nwant to make anything custom made. When they buy the clothes, they know what they\u2019re\ngetting, you know, they can see. I\u2019d rather do alter -- which I never thought I would like.",
        "A: Never thought I would like. But I liked it for awhile, but then when I started to not have\npatience, I said it\u2019s time to retire.",
        "A: Cause I don\u2019t -- and 15 years in [indecipherable]",
        "A: So, they\u2019re still coming to me.",
        "A: And I only kept -- I only kept the cream of the crop.",
        "A: I bet you would.",
        "A: I wish you could.",
        "A: Wish you could. So, you know, they still trust my work --",
        "A: -- and -- but I don\u2019t want to -- I do it, but don\u2019t rush me.",
        "A: You know? I been rushed all my life, I don\u2019t want to be rushed. No, I give you a week. I said,\nthat\u2019s rushing. They\u2019re teasing me, you know.",
        "A: Right --",
        "A: I think.",
        "A: No, not too much.",
        "A: Not too much.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve talked about it more since the book came out in Kansas City.",
        "A: That\u2019s the book, it\u2019s called, \u201cFrom the Heart.\u201d Our pictures -- all the people that are in the\nbook, the pictures are on the front page. Mine is the only colored picture --",
        "A: -- so there I am, as a bride, see? And Johnny\u2019s next -- Zdenko\u2019s next to me. And then you turn\nit around what we are now, oh my gosh, okay? They had to do that. And inside, whoever\u2019s in the\nbook, there\u2019s a story, you know, to the --",
        "A: -- what they interviewed, you know. I told you the one that interviewed me just wanted to\nknow about my childhood --",
        "A: -- and she didn\u2019t understand that I didn\u2019t have a childhood.",
        "A: You know. So I couldn\u2019t really express the way I wanted to express. And -- but that\u2019s what\nhappened.",
        "A: That\u2019s when they -- that\u2019s how I started to think more.",
        "A: It was about 10 years ago.",
        "A: That that started. And then they had a big get together, celebrating 10 years of this book, and\neverything. In fact, Zenie came with her husband, and my nephew, my first nephew and his\ngirlfriend, because after 35 years they decided to divorce, and so he came with his girlfriend.\nAnd that was wonderful, to have my family there.",
        "A: That meant so much to me.",
        "A: They gave us a beautiful, beautiful dinner, all the Holocaust survivors. And Dudu Fisher, you\nknow Dudie Fisher?",
        "A: He\u2019s an Israeli singer.",
        "A: He came to entertain. Wonderful.",
        "A: Just wonderful. And like I said, it meant so much that they came. And so that\u2019s when I\nstarted, 10 years ago to think. And then certain things come to me and I said, my God, I almost\nforgot that.",
        "A: You know? And things like that. You know. That\u2019s it.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: You\u2019re sweet, thank you. ...This is a picture in Vienna. It is I, my brother, and my little\ncousin, who we just were crazy about. He was just a little -- this picture really doesn\u2019t do him\njustice because he was so much cuter. But he makes a funny face, and I think the sun was shining\nin somehow. But he is one that got killed, they did not let him live.",
        "A: I think it must have been \u201939. \u201939, because I think my dad was gone by then, and we went to\nsee. \u00b038 or \u00b039, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "A: This is my brother and I, when we got to Genoa. So that was before his Bar Mitzvah, so I\nguess -- we figured out yesterday when was that, \u201940?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u201927 he was born.",
        "A: 1927, so must have been \u201940, that\u2019s just 13.",
        "A: 1940. We\u2019d -- had just gotten to Genoa, and I think my parents wanted us to have a picture\nlike that.",
        "A: This is when we got to Genoa. Again, 1t was done the same time as the one before. It\u2019s my\nparents, me in the middle, and my mother\u2019s in the middle a-at the bottom. And on one side the\nbigger woman, yeah, she was the landlady, and there was a maid there. And they took very nice\ncare of us. They were wonderful to us. We lived there long as we were in Genoa. I can still\nremember the name of the street, which was via Goito. So, little after that, started bombardments,\nand things were a little bit more difficult. But they were so good to us.",
        "A: This picture is my brother in Pari, teaching these wonderful girls, and one is prettier than the\nother, which he loved, teaching them German. They had nothing else to do, they were coming to\nPari to get away from the big city\u2019s bombardments and so on. I\u2019m not sure what town they came\nfrom, whether it was just as close as Siena or Florence, or maybe even Pisa, I don\u2019t know.\nAnyway, there nothing else to do, so they thought they would learn German.",
        "A: And this is me, and my parents, and my brother, and I remember my outfit being gray with a\npink blouse, and was so pretty. And it was a -- a Jewish holiday. Of course, there was no -- you\nknow, no synagogue or anything, but my mother always made sure, somehow she managed to\ngive us some new clothes on holidays.",
        "A: And this was in Pari, yeah. She liked that wall, I guess, she always took pictures on that wall.\nAnd we were all together, and that was always the main thing, we stuck together. Ma -- one was\nworrying about the other.",
        "A: The bigger one is my mom and I in Pari. Just taking pictures for no reason. I guess he had\nsome extra film in the camera. And the other picture 1s my brother and I.",
        "A: Same wall. That wall was famous.",
        "A: This 1s all children that used to go to school in Ferramonti. Ferramonti was the camp, and they\ntried to keep the children busy with teaching, you know, and like a school. The barracks are in\nthe background, whatever you can see, that\u2019s -- was our living quarters.",
        "A: Right there in the middle, between two girls, yeah. And one group was like five sisters, I\nthink, four and five sisters. That\u2019s the only thing left.",
        "A: And that\u2019s again Cinecitta and my dad and I, and I\u2019m carrying my job in my hand. Those\nwere cards that I -- every time somebody ate, I turned the card around so that I know they ate.\nAnd that was my job. That was in the -- working in the kitchen that was for working people.\nBecause for the big kitchen, I needed a much bigger card, you know, to carry --",
        "A: -- like this. And that\u2019s my dad, just -- just looking good. Looking to the future, which he\ndidn\u2019t know what was going to be.",
        "A: Okay, that\u2019s my brother driving a Jeep, with a friend who later also wound up in -- in Kansas\nCity. And he loved cars, and loved those Jeeps, any -- and then he drove big trucks, too, but\nloved to drive cars. So whenever he could, he was in a car.",
        "A: This is in Cinecitta, too.",
        "A: This is my dad and his youngest brother, who lived in Huntington, New York\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: The brother\u2019s name? Emil. Emil. Emil Arzt. And he worked for airplane -- how can I remind,\nI forgot? For airplane -- whatever, making --",
        "A: -- for the government.",
        "A: No, the government -- if my husband will know, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: This is the best looking couple you ever saw, and that was taken July 4\", 1954, just a couple\nof years ago. And believe it or not, we\u2019re still together, alive. We have not killed each other yet?",
        "A: The wedding was in Brooklyn, New York, on Pitkin Avenue, in the Little Oriental was the\nname of the place. And it was a wonderful affair, and I was stuck. This is me, Evelyn Bergl with\nmy loving dog, Cuk1. She is the best dog, and I love her so much, and she knows it. And she\u2019s\nspoiled rotten, but that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s what she\u2019s here for.",
        "A: But I wanted the world to see that I love that dog, and she loved me. I was sure of that, of\nnothing else.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nConclusion of Interview\n"
