        "Q: Mr. Schnell, would you identify yourself? Tell us your name and the date of your birth,\nplease.",
        "A: My name is Walter Schnell. And I was born on April 16, 1904.",
        "Q: OK. Where?",
        "A: In Strehlen. This is Silesia...is the province of Silesia in Germany.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: You're welcome.",
        "Q: Tell me...tell me something about your family and your childhood, would you? What was it\nlike? What was your family like?",
        "A: My family was in four generations in the same place--in that little town of Strehlen, what is\nvery famous by a very famous man, name of Paul Ehrlich.\u2019 And we had a business in glass\nporcelain or crystal for four generation. It was by... my great grandfather found[ed] it. And\nhe came originally from a little town of Chels, Upper Silesia. That was the only place where\nJews could settle. And then the law got that people Jews could settle in other parts. So they\nsettled down in that little town and bought a house on the market place just opposite the city\nhall and we had this store for 110 years in the family. It went from father to son. And what\nhappened, if it wouldn't be that the Nazis came to power with the SA and SSA and SS,\nspecial life in this small towns were impossible anymore. And that is the reason we finally\ndecided to give it up and sell it, even we couldn't find a buyer who paid a lot money--because\nthey know that Jews had to sell 1t. So we had to sell..sold the business for a very low price.\nAnd we moved to the big city what was Breslau [NB: Wroclaw].",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: That was in the...we sold it the end of 1937. And then we moved to the capital what was\nBreslau and we settled...we got a apartment in the Jewish section. That was Wall Street--\nWallstrasse. It was direct next to the Jewish Federation--they called it Judische Gemeinde--\nthe Jewish community. It was next door. And uh, we lived there. It was direct for all the\nJewish people on this same street were the seminar, the rabbinical seminar, what was very\nfamous. And also the...we had access to both the orthodox synagogue there--they called the\n' Winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine for 1908.\nStorch Synagogue. That was all next door.",
        "Q: OK. Tell me. Go back a little bit because we have gone... we have jumped from really\nchildhood to 1937. And it's a big jump. Tell me about...you are a young man...tell me...by\n'37... Tell me, when you say \"we,\" were you married by this time? What was it like first\ngrowing up in that family? About your courtship a little. What were you doing?",
        "A: I was originally... You know, my parents wanted me to get...learn a trade. So I...they send me\nto the big cities. First I was in very big stores in Breslau; and after I finished there, they sent\nme to Berlin--what was at that time the capital...Capital of Germany--where I worked in the\nlargest store...largest firm what was in the wholesale 1n porcelain. They always also had to\nhave their own factory; and I took care of the business and I sold there. And I was very\nhappy there. But one day, one of my uncles came to visit. And he said, \"Better come home,\nbecause this will get worse and worse. The business...was the time already the Nazis started\nin 1933. And it got worse and worse. So I had to come back. That was in...in the year of\n1926. And help my father in the business. So it went...but it went worse and worse, and it\nwas impossible to continue for a long time.",
        "Q: I see. So this is in... Wait a minute. You came back in 1926?",
        "A: I came back. I was in Berlin from 1924 'til 1926. But I came back, because I unk...uh...about\nthe situation, what was very unbearable in the small towns. Much...it was much worse than\nliving in the big city, what not everybody know the other person.",
        "Q: Tell me about that. How do you mean worse? Because in '26, it was...1t not yet Hitler in full\npower, but things were happening. That's important.",
        "Q: Yes. I tell you what happened. The people...it was not Hitler didn't come to power, but also it\nwas the anti-Semitism was very worse. And they made on the big...opposite our... We was,\nas I mentioned before, in the main marketplace, opposite the city hall. And they erected in\nthe...in front of the city hall, a special sign for Streicher. Everybody knew who Streicher was.\nHe was one of the worst Nazi. He had a paper they called the Der Sttirmer; and the put all the\npictures. And they put on a sign: \"Kauft Nicht bei Juden\"--\"Don't buy in Jewish stores.\" So\nin other word, people should sabotage the Jewish stores. We were only a few. We were not\nmany Jews families. Just a few families. And there was opposite our store also a little\ndepartment store belong to Jews. And they had signs there, and said, \"Go to Palestine!\"\nThey put it even in front of the railway station. \"Jews get out! Go to Palestine!\" So in other\nword, it was not that Hitler was in power, but it was the anti-Semitism was always in..in\nGermany a big factor. It also in this...1n this schule, I went there to the gymnasium. In\nGermany, they call the high school... They don't call 1t high school; they call it \"gymnasium.\"\nAnd it was when you was only one of the few Jewish people, you got ignored. Or the people\ndidn't like the Jews.",
        "Q: Okay. Thank you. That's very important. It's very interesting. Alright. So it's...so the year is\n1926. You are back helping your father. What happened? Now move it forward for us. Tell\nus what happened.",
        "A: What happened. It...year by year...I mean I tried the best. We had a big window and one\nnight, the Nazis just destroyed all the windows. They throw stones and also...what\nhappened...you couldn't have...they brought laws out...you couldn't hire...only employee\nAryan people. That mean...Aryan mean German people. We had in our household what you\ncall a maid, and the father came there and said...told her, \"Get out. You shouldn't work for\nthe Jews.\" So big...so it was the anti-semitism that they all was afraid or there was special to\nthe propaganda was so big that Gentile shouldn't work. Now I tell you another story. I used\nto go in the evening after the store closed to work. And it was geting worse and worse. And\nwe know in the small town, everybody knew everybody. The other...the Gentile people\ndidn't even look at you and didn't greet you. I remember one night I went to the railway\nstation to pick up my parents who went to the big city...to pick...picked them up. I was\nfollowed by the Nazis. They followed me everyday and they...I was afraid to go out\nespecially in the evening. It was getting worse and worse. That what happened between 1926\nand '37. So we had...even my father said, \"This business is for hundred ten years 1n the\nfamily. It should be in the family. You shouldn't sell it.\" Now I have to make an interruption.\nWhen we had our hundred anniversary-- and this was in 1926. It was a big celebration in that\nlittle town, because there was no other business was...was that long hundred years existing.\nSo not only the mayor came, and everybody, all the big..the big uh people in the town. And it\nwas real...a big celebration. And this paper, the largest paper...there were two papers in the\ntown...they both made all big stories about the business. They even made the poem and it\nwas just wonderful. And as..as a matter of fact, the editor came the day before to me and\ninterviewed me and the...the whole paper was full about our hundred year anniversary. But it\nchanged radically. Just after this, a few years...years later, people didn't come in the store. In\nother words, we were unable to exist because people were afraid because our store was direct\non the...on the...most visible place at the marketplace so they were afraid to come in the\nstore. And then became the big boycott. That was on the Ist of April 1933. They put Nazis in\nfront of the store and say don't buy at Jews...buy Jews. So in other words, people were afraid\nto come and buy. So in other words, we had to make the very difficult decision. We couldn't\nget on see as big...as good as possible and we..uh. organized a sale. There was only allowed\nif the sale is for giving up the store. So...and that was on the end of 1937 when we had to sell\nour store, and we had a big house there too. And, uh, even the people who lived there as our\nrenters were afraid to live in the house what belonged to Jews.",
        "Q: Okay. So when you sold the business finally, you had to sell the house as well?",
        "A: We had to sell the house, and we sold the house together with the..with the..with the\nbusiness, and as you can imagine, they gave very little because they know that the...that we\nhad to do it. So in other words, the price was...was not what the house was worth and what\nthe...what the..business was worth.",
        "Q: Now...you said, now you go to Breslau from there?",
        "A: Yes. We moved...we moved to Breslau. That is not far away, is about 25 miles, 35\nkilometers, and we settled weeks before. We went there. My mother went there and...uh...we\nfound a apartment in a house what were Jewish...owned by Jewish people. It was next to the\nJewish community center.",
        "Q: Who is we? Who is with you? Who is part of the family?",
        "A: This I tell you. We were only 2 children, and my parents and...and...my...my...my sister and\nme. That was 4 people. And the apartment was not...it was...belonged to...to\nothers...to...to...to Jewish sisters, so we...we rented it from them, but were were very\ncomfortable. It was..uh..not big. It was a few rooms, but we were glad that we was in a, ina\nplace where we...nobody knew us. And that was the advantage that in the beginning in the\nbig city you could go on the street and nobody called you names of the Jew because in the\nbig city opposite in this war, everyone 1n the city....this small city had only about 10,000\npopulation. So in other words, we were relieved. But it didn't last long. As you know,\nthat...Hitler gave all the laws against the Jews, and that was in...in 1938. To just remind you\nthat what happened in Paris, a Jew by the name of Hershel Grynszpan shot an officer in\nParis, you know, from the German Embassy. And then that what happened the Aktion\nagainst the Jews.",
        "Q: Right. Let's talk about you. Where were you during Kristallnacht? What happened to you?",
        "A: No. I'll tell you what happened. When we moved to the big city, I didn't want to sit and do\nnothing. So, we had in our business a lot of people what we know who came from the other\nplaces and showed what...we had somebody in Breslow who owned a wholesale...a glass\nbusiness. So I went to them and, uh, I got a job there. I worked there to go around in the\ncity...g0 out...go to several enterprises and sold them...and that what what I did. Sold the\nglassware what..what the...what their business was. And then, in the meantime, the Nazis\nhad prepared also already what to do in the case of emergency. What did they do? They had\nregistered at all the Jews at the..the headquarters. In other words, when the Kristallnacht\nstarted and the order by Goebbels to arrest all the Jews. They had the names. So they went\nto every apartment, every house, and picked them up. But what happened...I wasn't there,\nbecause I was in the business--which was about maybe 10 blocks away. So they came to my\nfather; and they asked him, \"Where's your son?\" And he said, \"He works in a place.\" \"Give\nus the address.\" He said, \"I don't know.\" Even if he know, he didn't want to tell them. So I\nwas Safe at that time. As a matter of fact, when I came home that night they were surprised\nthat I was surprised. Because I was hiding. I know what was... what happened, what went on.\nSo I was hiding in the attic all day, when I went home. I didn't imagine it would it would\ncontinue the next day. But at first, I want to tell you what happened in the Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Just to you. Just to you.",
        "A: Just to me.",
        "Q: Just to you.",
        "A: So I had my own room in that building what I told you was just next door. When in the\nnight, middle of the night, I hear that terrible noise and I didn't know what...what happened.\nWhat happened was that the Nazis came in the back of the Jewish community center..was\nthe orthodox synagogue of Breslau. And they called it Storch Synagogue. But the Nazis was\nafraid. It was this building was direct in the middle of...of many apartment houses, and they\nwere afraid to put it afire...sit afire, because it would have burned out the whole\nneighborhood. So what they did, they just crushed and destroyed the windows and the\ninterior and that was that noise. But in the meantime, that was the main synagogue that was\nabout 10 blocks away, they called the new Synagogue. The most beautiful building with a\nbig cupola, and they set it afire. And this was what I saw and what I heard in the\nKristallnacht. But the main thing happened the next day, they not only went to the every\nhouse...and in that neighborhood, there was only Jews living...in the streets where we lived,\nbut they went also in the street in the buses and they..they caught all on the street. Jews what\nthey caught. And brought them...brought them to the police stations. Now, I tell you what\nhappened with me. I went the next morning to a business because I was the impression that\nthe razzia against the Jews was finished, but I made a big mistake. They continued and so\nwhen I made the mistake at lunchtime to go out of our complex where the business were.\nWhen I run direct in the hands of the Gestapo. When I came out I saw four people. Two\nGestapo who just had arrested two Jews. They asked me, \"Are you a Jew?\" Well, no; I\ncouldn't say not. \"So...so come with us.\" If] would run away, they would they would have\nshoot at me...shoot me..shot me. So there was about..from there a few blocks away was the\nlocal police station. And when we came there we found a lot of people already there. So they\ncalled up the main headquarters...police headquarters...was just opposite where the new\nsynagogue was. Please send us a big truck. We have a lot of people here. And we all was\nbrought to the headquarters from the Gestapo. They took all our belongings and they took\nthe fingerprints and we had downstairs was a big garden or a place. There was thousand and\nthousand people and they kept us there the whole day...the evening. And they had a big\nreason for that. They wanted to wait til 1t was dark because they didn't want to show the\npopulation what's going on. When it was dark, they put us in a big column. There was a few\nthousand people and they walked with us through the whole city to the main railway station.\nBut we came by the...the synagogue and we were so shocked to see what happened to that\nbeautiful place. It was all burned out. When we came finally, after walking a half hour, to the\nmain station, there was always already a train waiting so they put us all in a train and in each\nplace they put a special of their people, a police man. And I was surprised. I met a lot of\npeople there, and we went...we had no idea where the train would go. Nobody knew about it.\nWe traveled the whole night, about 20...over 20 hours. And finally we arrived at a very\nfamous place, the city of Weimar. Weimar is very famous by two big poets, Goethe and\nSchiller. And we knew exactly that here that city was a big concentration camp.",
        "Q: You knew about the camp before you got there?",
        "A: I tell you exactly what happened. I knew, because an uncle of mine was about 6 months\nbefore there. And they had arrested him in Berlin and sent him there. And he died there,\nbecause he was on a special diet and he couldn't get the food. And I went special...I told my\nfather, I went to... When they sent the ashes to Berlin, I went special there; and it was there\non the big cemetery in Weissensee (ph) in Berlin and they had a big chapel. And I had my\ncase...briefcase; but the whole ceremony were observed... witnessed by the Nazi, by the\nGestapo. So I was afraid to move around, because they was looking for something. So that 1s\nwhy I know that my uncle was there. And what...what was his crime? He went one evening\nto the synagogue, he had a yahrtzeit [Yidd: remembrance of a deceased person on the\nanniversary of his or her death] for his father--my grandfather. And when he came there, the\nplace was closed. And he want to know...and he went around to the Gestapo watched him.\n\"What...what you want to do here?\" So they arrested him; and they took him right away to\nthe Gestapo headquarters in Berlin and they sent him to Buchenwald. And there where he\ndied. So in other words, I knew about Buchenwald. I heard about Buchenwald, so he was\nthere before I came there. So what...what happened now? We had to ran in Weimar. They\nput us in the station; and they warn, \"Don't move.\" And then we had to run through an\nunderground tunnel. And there was on both sides Gestapo Nazi men with [Gemitkolben\n(ph)], with uh...",
        "Q: Clubs.",
        "A: With clubs. And they beat us, beat up. Everybody beat up. And I know I saw when people\nfell down, among them was my boss where I worked in Breslau. He was a wonderful Jewish\nman and he also died in Buchenwald because they beat him...they beat him to death. That\nwent before we came to the buses. Then they loaded us on the buses. And they shouted,\n\"Don't look. Don't look on this side.\" And I made the mistake. I looked and they threw a\nstone at me. And it was a miracle the stone didn't...didn't hit me. So finally we arrived in\nBuchenwald and there was already 20,000 people there. When we came they didn't know\nthat so many people were coming. They came from all over Germany. So the...our place\nwhere we were supposed to stay wasn't finished. And they were still building. So we...we\nhad to...out...the whole day sitting outside on the grass and sitting and waiting. Then in the\nevening we went in that place and people got crazy. They had around watchtowers and they\nhad a electric fence. I remember the first three nights was worst night I ever remember\nbecause people were not allowed to go outside. The people lost their mind. They run around.\nThere was five buildings. They run around the buildings and just from the watchtowers, the\npeople on the watchtowers starting shooting them...shot them and the people shouted and\ncried and I heard that all night. But the worst thing happened the next day. We were allowed\non the day to go out, but many people didn't go out. It was terrible cold. Buchenwald is...1s\nhigh in the mountains... that camp, and it was special built for this purpose. What happened\npeople went and went to the electric fence..fence. As soon as they touched them, they got\nkilled, automatically. But not only this, everybody who touched this same person got also\nkilled. When I saw that, how people fell down on the floor. When they let them laying there.\nAnd it was a terrible sight, but there was a much worse thing. It was impossible to escape\nfrom there. Every morning we had appeal at 6:00. They called us out and we had to stay\nthere and they counted us, and when somebody was missing we had to stay there the whole\nday until they found the person, brought. But some people were able to escape, and they\nescaped to Czechoslovakia, and the...the German government what was already the Nazi\ngovernment demanded to send them back. So the worse day was...1n Buchenwald was when\nthis man was sent back and he was condemned to die on the gallows. And we were\nforced...there was an announcement through the loud speaker [and] everybody from all the\nbarracks had to come out and watch. And, of course, it was a terrible thing to see what\nhappened. And we were supposed to watch this, the hanging of this man. So you can\nimagine what the mood was. We were not allowed to walk to work because...but they\nwanted us to do something, so we had to move everyday the stones from one place to the\nother, to the other corner, and we was busy this. The food, of course, the food were terrible.\nIn the beginning they gave us nothing and then they got...they get everybody should go and\nget the money what they had brought and what they took away from the people, they brought\nthe food. But, of course, the dishes, we all had to drink the soup from the same bowl--\neverybody. And they gave us [wall fish (ph)]...[wall fish (ph)] food. So the conditions were\nworse and worse. We had special arranged services and the Rabbis there went around and\nsay \"Please eat\" because there was many people they didn't want to eat the food because it\nwasn't kosher. So the rabbis went around and told the people, but some didn't...they didn't do\nit anyway. But what happened is that we had secretly arranged services. Every morning we\nput outside...somebody watched that nobody came from the...from the people there...from\nthe Nazis...and we had our prayers. But another thing happened every day on the appell. On\nthe morning appell, that the Nazi what were in charge, they took off and counted and they\npunched the people. So I was smart enough not to stand in the first row that I didn't get\npunched. But what happened that the people...the conditions got everyday worse, and people\ndied from starving. We was...the conditions in the barracks was even worse. We were laying\non just wood. There was no blanket. There was nothing. And there was some people had\nfood. Some people had money. They could buy. So they helped the people, the others. Now\nwe come to the first Erev of Hanukkah. I was there; and that was a wonderful thing. We\nwere sitting in our barracks and sung the Hanukkah songs. And we also had prepared... The\npeople had money. They brought special cookies and a cake.",
        "Q: How did they get it?",
        "A: There was a store. They had a store there; and the people who got money, they could go and\nbuy it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But for me, the most surprise happened on the second day of Hanukkah. In the morning, I\nheard over the loudspeaker my name called. And they said, \"Please...\" Not \"please.\" \"Come\nall the people...\"--I was not the only one--\"Come after, to the office.\" So when I came to the\noffice, they told me that they got a paper from Breslau, from my parents, that they had\nbooked for me a passage to Panama. And that was the one what my cousin told him [that]\nmy mother went to the Consulate. And I have the documents; and so that was the only reason\nthat they let me go. So after that, in the afternoon, they put us on buses. They gave us even\nsome money; because it was a long, a long trip with the railway. So we went first with the\nbus to Weimar, and they put us there in that...1n that train. On this train, was the first station\nwas Leipzig. That was a very big city. It's very famous. There goes to there every year a very\nbig fair. And there lived a lot of Jews, maybe...mostly Jews from the east from Poland. And\nthey had prepared for us a special reception; and they gave us some... And so we was on the,\nof course, on this station was a very large station. But I wanted to go out, because I know this\ncity very well. Because I went every...every year to that fair. And I went in the night for a\nwalk. And I was amazed I saw how the Jewish store was all destroyed, all the windows. And\nit was terrible. I went all the places and all the streets; and I saw it. And so it happened in\nevery city in Germany. They destroyed in the night from the 8th to the 9th of November\n1938. That was the day of the Kristallnacht. So they destroyed it. Then I went back to the\nstation and back to the train; and we arrived in the morning. In the morning, the next\nmorning, we arrived in the...in the Breslau, in the railway station. But in...they had told us in\nBuchenwald before they let us go. They say, \"The first thing you come...you arrive at home,\nyou have to go to the Gestapo and report. And they will tell you what to do.\" But we made a\nvery big mistake, and I make the biggest mistake. In this...in this..in the station...in the train,\nwe talked to the other people. And we said, \"No, it is Friday.\" You know, Friday. We came\non Friday. \"We will go...we will not go. We will go on...\" I mean, Friday night, we thought\nwe wait for Monday. And what happened with me, when I came Monday to the Gestapo,\nthey said, \"When did you come?\" I said, \"We came Friday night.\" \"Why didn't you come\nthe next morning?\" I say the reason was that I was very dirty and all, the... when we was in\nBuchenwald we had...we couldn't change our clothes. We couldn't take no bath, no shower;\nand I wanted to be clean. But they didn't...they said, \"Wait here.\" And I waited and waited\nand waited. And my parents were worried...were very worried, because I say early I will\ncome back. So what happened? It was a Saturday. And they left me wait the whole morning\nfrom 9 o'clock til 1 o'clock. And then they called me in and said, \"Why didn't you come?\nYou know what we will do. We will send you to Dachau. To another concentration camp,\nbecause you didn't obey the order.\" And I was very scared. So finally I went home, and my\nparents...what happened. I had to wait. I was the last one but everybody...all was gone.",
        "Q: What do you mean were gone?",
        "A: Everybody was gone. So finally, we had to report every week. That was the order. Every\nweek, we had to come to the Gestapo and tell them what we have done to get out. That was\nthe condition to get out of Germany. And I was the one who really were in charge, because\nwhen the other people came on the day when everybody was asked the most people didn't do\nnothing. And they threatened them. But I had prepared already a lot. I wrote to all the...to all\nthe ship lines and everybody. And I...they promised me as soon as they have a passage... So,\nin other words, they were satisfied. So finally I went to the Gestapo: \"Do you have a ship for\nme. I want to get out.\" So anyway, I got one day a telegram from the Italian airline what was\nin Munich. And they said, \"We have a passage for you.\" It was just a holiday of Shavuos\n[NB: Shavuot] in the same week; and when I came home my parents were very upset. I said,\n\"I have...I just got a...a...telegram. And I went to Jewish Community because I had paid for\nthem a lot money to help me for my immigration. And what happened, they give me...they\ngave me the rest. So they say, \"It is too late to come to Munich. You go direct to Genoa.\"\nNot Geneva...Genoa. That was the port where the largest ship called the Bianca Mano...the\nlargest ship from the Italian airline...ship line. And I went...I went with the bus...with the\ntrain from Breslau to Genoa. But in the meantime, we went over the Alps and it was a very\nlong trip. And they didn't allow us any money. We were all only allowed one dollar. That\nwas 4 [deutsche ]mark in that time. And the rest I had to pay for the first train. So when I\narrived, I had nothing left. So when we came on at night in Genova... It wasn't night. And we\nhad no place to sleep. We was a whole...1t was maybe 20, 25 people. We walked around the\nstreets and we looked for a place where to stay. And all the places were full because this\nwas...thousands of people went there, left there for the trip. So we went...I went finally I got\na room was a attic, was not even a window. When the next morning I left for the\nheadquarters of the airline what was...",
        "Q: Airline or ship line?",
        "A: Excuse me. The ship line. And when I came tn the middle of the town, it was a sign at the\nwindow \"We moved today to the Harbor because on account that the boat is leaving.\" So in\nother words, I had to...to...to walk to the harbor. And what happened when I came there\nnobody understood English or no German, only Italian. Because they had written to me,\n\"Pick up your ticket there.\" So finally somebody helped me with the language and I got it. I\ngot my ticket. But they say, \"Don't go back to the hotel because that you don't miss the ship.\"\nThis was in the noontime...in the morning...ship left at 4:00. And I got plenty trouble.\nBecause when I left in the morning, I hadn't paid for my room. And somebody had to pay.\nAnd they looked for me, and they wanted to arrest me. And, you know, because they said,\n\"Stay here. Stay here and don't go back. Stay here, because you are here already; and go on\nthe boat and you'll get there this.\" But there was several classes there. A first class, a second\nclass, and a third class. And so the other people, they were looking for me; but they couldn't\nfind me. So when they came on our date, they wanted to get me arrested that I hadn't paid my\nhotel bill. Anyway, the trip was very painful. Because it was terrible hot and we came to\nthe...the...Red Sea, and it...it took a long time. We was impossible to sleep in the room. It\nwas too hot. We had to sleep on the...on the deck. But finally we arrived tn..in..1n Shanghai.",
        "Q: Alright. Back up a moment. You had the...this pass to Panama, but you found yourself on a\nboat to Shanghai. How did that happen?",
        "A: I tell you. That this was only...I met...I got the original document. Maybe I have it here too.\nAnd what happened they said you have to come in person to Amsterdam and to introduce\nyourself, you know. But this was only, you know, a matter to get me out from Buchenwald. I\nmean because otherwise I never would get out from the concentration camp. So 1n other\nwords and what many people didn't know, Shanghai was the only place where people could\ngo without any papers. No visa. No affidavit. My parents, especially my mother, they tried to\nwrite to all the family. She had family in America, all over, to get a visa affidavit, but they all\nwas in such a state I mean in such that they couldn't afford it. So we didn't get no...and that\nwas the only...that is the reason I never had the idea to go to Shanghai because Shanghai had\na very bad name. But Shanghai this was the only thing...and that is the most people who\nwent there, they went there because they had no other choice. So that's the reason why I\ncouldn't take about from Panama you know. You want to know anything else?",
        "Q: Yes. Can you... We'll talk about Shanghai in a minute. But you brought documents with you\nthat...that...uh... that allowed you to leave. Can you show me just the German ones at this\npoint? I'll deal with Shanghai later. Just the passes and hold them up and explain what each\none Is.",
        "A: This is the pass, what you call identification, I mean, this of course in...1n...German. And\nthey put...there's a fingerprint and a picture and this is the President of the Police and there's\nthe Jew because every passport had to read the Jew in and say the name on the...all the...uh...\nwhere I came for and for Breslau. So this was the identification to get out of Germany. This\nis called the Heimatschein. And this...it proves that I am a citizen, that I am a...was still a\ncitizen. And that was important when you go outside in other country, that I prove I ama\ncitizen of Germany. This is here in Chinese, the fingerprints. This is the identification from\nShanghai. Because we had to, every time we go there to uh...to our uh...uh to some\norganization or to some office we had to identify that we are allowed, that we as...allowed to\nstay there. The picture of the fingerprint and the Chinese, that's a Chinese identification.",
        "Q: Hold it back up. Straight like this. That's nght. And move to your right so the camera can\nsee.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Good. Thank you.",
        "A: And this is a very interesting. This is a document, Directory of Jewish Refugees. That shows\nyou that I am and everybody who was there--there was about 20,000 refugees in...Shanghai.\nAnd everybody...the Chinese government, the government of Shanghai, gave everybody this;\nbecause you have to show that. Otherwise, you would be expelled. So this 1s the Directory of\nJewish Refugees in Shanghai. I think that 1s.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This is a interesting document. This is the Reichlands in Germany. And this was an\napplication, because they wanted to help the Jews that came from the concentration camp.\nWhen they have no other way where to go, [then] Durchgangslager [Ger: \"transit camp\" |--\nthat means a place in England. To go to a place in England, just for the time being to get out\nfrom Germany. And in other words...",
        "Q: Who made these. Who created this pass?",
        "A: They created this. Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutscheland. This is the main organization\nwho represented the Jews in Germany. And they gave that out. But after I got the idea to\nShanghai to go... So many people went there--but only temporary--to England; because\nEngland wasn't safe at all. So I thought...so people asked me--my friends and my relatives--\n\"Why didn't you go there, instead [of] to Shanghai?\" So I thought they said you had to wait\nabout maybe a month to get an answer. In the meantime, it was already the rumor that pretty\nsoon the war will bring out...break out. And I thought I don't want to wait any longer. The\nother one I got right away. And that's the reason that I didn't go to England, and I went to\nShanghai. Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's change the tape now. They have to change the tape, and then we'll talk about\nShanghai.",
        "A: Okay.\nTAPE #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: Alright. I think we are ready to start again. Mr. Schnell, would you describe...you have\ndescribed the ship coming into Shanghai. Describe what it was like getting off the ship and\nyour first day there please. What did you do?",
        "A: I tell you when we arrived in Shanghai, of course we was welcomed because we were not\nthe first one. The interesting thing is there were many people there specially from Austria,\nVienna. And what I didn't mention before, on the boat there was 2,000 refuges...was the\nlargest ship whatever went to. And there was not a good...uh...uh...feeling between the\nGerman, towards, you know, Jewish. And there their meetings on the boat and we had our\nmeeting.... was not a good relationship. As a matter of fact, in Shanghai--because we came\nin...in the middle of '39--we arrived 27 of June, I think. And the other one, you remember in\nAustria happened the terrible thing when Hitler came and took over and the Jews...treated\nterribly Jews. So in other words, the right of the...the Jews from Vienna, Austria--the many\nof them went to Shanghai. So they took over the committees and everything, you know.\nThey were in charge. There was already established the Joint Distribution Committee, HIAS;\nand they had all taken over. They were in charge. So they had prepared for us, ordered big\ntrucks where they put us in, and they had already... Already there was many Jews in\nShanghai. They were already a big community. It was mostly Russian Jews. The Jews that\ncame from Vladivostok. And they arrived. They uh had everything organized. I just writing a\nbig story. You know, we have in...1n our home our uh wonderful magazine...",
        "Q: This is the Hebrew home? Tell us the name where you live.",
        "A: ...called the Resident...Resident High Journal. And I write...I write many stories of them.\nAnd I just this week, I wrote a big story and that fits in this report. And is called \"The\nSassoon Family.\" Maybe you heard the name. And I write my own experience, there's also\nyears in Los Angeles. And in that story, I mentioned that. And there was a gentlemen with\nthe name of Sir Victor Sassoon. And he 1s the one who real... The Sassoon family was\nalways famous for philantrophy. Philantrophist. And he real did a big job. I met him right in\nthe beginning, because he provided not only the homes--they..they...they called it, in\nEnglish, \"the camps.\" But in...in...1n German, \"Heime\"--that mean \"homes.\" There was\nseveral homes; and they brought us first to a home [in] Kinchow [Road].",
        "Q: And you now are in Shangha1?",
        "A: In Shanghai.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And..uh..but what happened... As a matter of fact, they brought all the most of the Jews...1n\nthe beginning, the Jews to a suburb called Hongkou [NB: Hongkew]...Hongkou. And this is\nof interest. The name 1s the street...after the street. There was a Kinchow [Road] home, and a\nSeward [Road] home, Pingliang [Road] home. So anyway, this Mr. Victor Sassoon, he was\nthe one who from his property he prepared. So we was in the beginning there. We couldn't\nstay there long, because they needed what originally school...school uh there. But 1t was\nbeginning. And it was a nice place; but later on, they put us to uh Pingliang--what I didn't\nlike it from the beginning. It was the whole ...whole thing I didn't like. It was far out. And I\nthought I would like to get in touch with a family what had a private place, because it's nicer\nto live...ltve with a family there in a home. So what happened, several people had money\nthere in the bank. And I also got from a cousin, he sent... He was able to...to Holland, to\nescape to Holland. And he worked for a big Jewish firm from Breslau, what he sent...he sent\nmoney for me. And I had it there in the Shanghai bank. So I had a little money. And I went\nto a Jewish family--also in Hongkou--and they give me a room in the attic. So they...they had\na restaurant in the...in the...in the first floor, they had a little restaurant. So that was...that was\nmuch better. But then came the proclamation. The Japanese put out a proclamation that all\nthe Jews had to live in a ghetto. And they made a ghetto all the people, the many Jews were\nable to live in..in...Shanghai in the French Concession--French district in Shanghai--and they\nall was forced to move back. Of course, this was very difficult, because they took advantage\nand...and ask a lot of money. And I had a few bosses there; because I was lucky enough to\nget a job...find a job. And, as I told you before, we founded a kitchen. We founded after Pearl\nHarbor a kosher kitchen in Shanghai...in Shanghai.",
        "Q: Before you get to that, tell me about what happened at Pearl Harbor from your end. Because\nyour memoirs talk about that?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I tell you what happened. When we was in Pearl Harbor, I was already in\nanother...1n another camp...I mean in other camp. And I heard a nice night of Pearl Harbor a\nvery big noise because we didn't live far...very far from the ocean...from the river, Yangtze\nRiver. When we heard what happened, the...the Japanese had sunk British ship. Shanghai\nwas one of the biggest, largest ports and harbors in the world. And there was everyday came\nships from all over the world, and there was in the harbor British ships and they sunk..sunk\nthe ships. And went the next morning on the street, I think I went to the service, I was\nsurprised to see Japanese guards standing on every corner and to clear the traffic, and they\nhad taken over. Before the Japanese had only...they had one section. But after Pearl Harbor,\nthe Japanese took over all Shanghai and they all... There was a police station there, and they\ngot..took over...and there was a man with the name of Ghoya.",
        "Q: Tell me about Ghoya.",
        "A: And he was the most rigorous person you have thought of. The Jews called him the \"King of\nthe Jews.\" What happened, get...every Jew, after the Japanese took over, had no right to\nmove freely. As I mentioned before, when they wanted to go to Shanghai, as I said, we all\nlived in Hongkou. Was a suburb. And they could go on the...on the bus. They had to have a\npass. And the..Japanese ordered a Pao Chia--that is a special...a special organization what\nconsisted from the refugees.\u201d They had to watch on all the exits that nobody leaves...leaves\nthe...the place where they lived. And what happened, when they had to come and make\napplication to come in the morning to that police station, what I saw it with my own eyes,\nbecause the place where I worked was just on the same street. And..uh..they had to...made\napplication, they had to stand in line. And he came out, and he punched everybody or hit\neverybody. Because if he didn't like a face or somebody and he..they were depended on him\nto get the permission. Many of them had shop. That is the reason. They had a shop in\nShanghai. But they couldn't own it. They had to special....every month to get a new...a new\npass. So he treated them...he treated them terrible. And he came...he came to our kitchen also\nand to...to...uh...to give the permission of...we have to get a permit. And he tasted it, you\nknow, and he asked me so many questions about food but I had to answer them you know,\nbecause we...we had to have a special permit to have that kitchen. So anyway I had to go to\nPolice station and get...uh, they interviewed me because he them I am the manager of the\nkitchen. So that what happened. So anyway the refugees had it...had it very hard. Very hard\nin...in all the...the..because they were watched...uh...and nobody were allowed to talk\nanything. And the same thing happened with the... we had two newspaper...our newspapers,\nwhat the refugees gave. And they were under censorship. They were not allowed to write\nanything. But there was a very interesting thing. This section where we lived, Hongkou, was\ndestroyed in the civil war in China. And it was terrible when we arrived. We saw the\nwhole...the buildings, everything was..was either hole the buildings. And they had a little\nstreet there--at the moment, I don't...the name--and what the refuges did is unbelievable.\nThey made from this condition a wonderful business street. The people, not only the Jews,\nthey came from Shanghai. They came special there. They had wonderful cafes and\nrestaurants and bakeries and grocery stores and that was all...they did it all them by\nthemselves. They even had in..a night club, where they danced at night. So that was...people\ncame from all over Shanghai. And that was a wonderful, wonderful thing what...what\nhappened.",
        "Q: Okay. It was indeed!",
        "A: So that was...that was the life in Shanghai, you know. And uh..in the evening the people\nwent a little out, you know, had a little...went to a cafe and..and...but now one terrible thing\nhappened and that is the most thing what you should know about it. After the...about in the\nyear 1944, the Americans started to bomb Shanghai. But one day they made a terrible\nmistake. They bombed the...the quarters, the Jewish quarters. But we knew that the\nAmerican came every morning exactly at 10:00. And we were ordered, all the refugees, to go\nthe worse..the biggest jail in that...where we lived...at the biggest jail. And we have to get\nthere and go in the basement to be protected from the bombing. So went everything morning\nat 10 o'clock and we went...we went in the basement and an hour later we went out and\neverything burned up But one day they came a different time. And I remember that special.\nAs I told you before, the kitchen what I had the..was a thousand people. But the most people\n* Jewish police force in the ghetto which was supervised by the Japanese.\ndidn't own...a few people ate there. Much of it, they came and they picked up their meal. And\nthey came from all over.",
        "Q: This is the Jewish community kitchen. This 1s the kitchen of the Jewish community.",
        "A: Yes. Not the Jewish community. The Jewish community was something else. But we...we\nhad our own. The Jewish community fed many more people. When I met Victor Sassoon\nwhen he came. He came direct, and looked in the kitchen and saw how everything went on.\nBut I talk now about the kosher kitchen. So I remembered exactly and this is the worse day\nwhatever happened. It was at noontime and we had just fed the people and the people were\non the way home from the kitchen when the bombs. Many people got killed. I mean for the\nrefugees. And I was...I mean I was in the...I was still there. But we found out after that,\nthere's a lot people...beside of that, of course, many Chinese people, too. They...because it\nwas a Chinese neighbourhood. And that was the worst day whatever happened. And what\nhappened must be some mistake that the American...the American, they...they bombed it.\nThe same thing what with Auschwitz, you know. They always say, \"Why didn't they bomb\nAuschwitz?\" So...and this was a terrible thing. Because we knew, of course, we knew all the\npeople, you know. And later on, when I came home, to my place where I lived... I lived that\ntime with Chinese people because we were not allowed to live anymore in the Jewish\nneighbourhood and in the camps. We had to live in the...outside...you know and I got\npermission to live outside...outside the ghetto. So I lived with Chinese people. When I come\nhome I wanted to know what happened to you...happened with the other people, you know,\nand, uh, so because a lot of people got up in flames by the bombing. A lot of people got\ndestroyed. That was the 14th of June in 1944 when that...when that happened. And..uh...then\nafter this...what happened after this, the...the American came to liberate, you know,\nafter...when the war was finished. And they came special..and that the first time that we also\nNegros, you know, they in the army. And they came the...they came in the camps and we..we\nhad big celebration. As a matter of fact, when the war over, we heard it over the radio, you\nknow. It was broadcast. And we all..we...we had always in the night somebody put on a...put\non a radio. And when it said, the war is finished, we danced in the street, you know, and, of\ncourse, that was wonderful. That we knew the war was over and we had a chance...a chance\nto go..to go and we..we could go, of course, that we go to...Shanghai to the city, and..uh...\nYes, that was...that was...uh... beautiful. Also, I want to tell you now about the famous\nJewish families there. There was a very famous families. One of the most famous was\nKadoories. And they did also a lot for the refugees. They founded...made a special school.\nAnd that school was wonderful. Because all the...there was so many Jewish children, and\nthey...they all went to that...to that school--in...in the Kadoorie school.\u2019 And as I say, the...the\nSassoons. There was also others, they real...they real... But when we...when we founded the\nkitchen, they sent me to the rich Russian Jews to get them interested, you know. And as a\nmatter of fact, they real...the realy gave...gave... They helped us. They gave money, you\nknow; because to make such a kitchen to keep... And...and I was in charge for 4...4 years of\n* This was the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association School on Tongshan Road.\nthat kitchen. And...and as I said before, our kitchen was famous, because our food was\nexcellent compared with the community kitchen. So the many people, they...they didn't even\ncare about kosher food, they came just... And we didn't ask no questions, you know. But they\nhad to pay. They had to pay you, know. Not...they didn't get it for free. So, I think this\nthe...what you are interested in.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me... Tell me about how you got kosher food there. You are in the middle of Shanghai.\nWhat did you do about a mashkiach,\u201d all of that?",
        "A: Yah. This is very interesting. I tell you we had...in our...the one room was interesting in that\nmeeting to about a kitchen was a Rabbi. What I didn't mention that we had in Shanghai about\n900 Yeshivas. And why did they come there? They never had the intentions to go to\nShanghai. They were caught up with Pearl Harbor. And they were originally in Kobe. Kobe,\n[Japan]... And they had to leave, and they came to Shanghai. And they real...they real\ncontributed to the Jewish life during the...that time, that terrible time...the years in the war a\nlot. Because they not only created the organizations, the Agudath Israel, but they\nalso...uh...was very active with Kashruth. And they had the one what was in our...in our\nRabbi Margulies. And he were appointed Mashkiach; and he came every morning. And also\nnot only that our home that where the kitchen was--and I told you it was about on the same\nstreet where the police station was. They also had, you know, in the...the holidays wonderful\nservices. And I remember, opposite lived White Russians. And they are the worst...the worst\nanti-Semites. And they real..they made...they give us a lot of trouble and they all lived in the\nsame neighborhood. And I had the man opposite, he asked me the next morning, \"Tell me\nwhat you had last night. You had a wonderful choir, you know.\" We had choir, and\nhazzanen [NB: cantors] and beautiful. So anyway, the holidays were wonderful. And...and I\nsay the...the Yeshivas, they were very active and they had, of course, an interesting...the had\nin our place...in our...they had weddings, you know. And when they have weddings, you\nknow, a Hassidishe wedding--that is the most remarkable thing. So anyway they all took\nplace in our kitchen, because they knew it was kosher. So anyway, there was about 900.\nThey came from different Yeshivas. And they had to stay. But what happened, when the war\nwas over, they were the first to leave; because they got the first opportunity to leave the\nuh...Shanghai.",
        "Q: You are describing your kitchen as sort of a major gathering place for religious Jews.",
        "A: Yes. As a matter of fact, we had, you know, services. There was, as a matter of fact, a..from\n* Yidd: a person responsible for oversight of kosher kitchens, for ensuring compliance with the\nJewish dietary laws.\nour kitchen, there was not far of the original synagogue. They called it...what would I mean...\nAnd this was...the synagogue existed a long time ago. And as I told you, they had...the real\nservice took place there. Also, they had the organization Betar--you know, a Zionist\norganization. And so this took place in...in the... They had also in Shanghai several\nsynagogues. But Askenazim, and also the Sephardim, you know. The Sephardim. And so\nuh...1n other words, there was real Jewish life. I mean, it...Jewish life went on. And they had\nmany, many uh places there. On holidays, they had special place, because in the Jewish\npersons...with the German Jews, many people who don't go to the whole year. Mainly\nAmericans even worst. They...but they go in the High Holidays. So for the High Holidays,\nwe...we rented special places for the people. So anyway, Jewish life was very, very active all\nthe years, you know. And they had...they had the...minyan every day. I remember once on a\nSunday, I...] walked on the street and there was someone: \"Please, come in.\" You know.\nSo in other words, the uh Jewish life went on very good.",
        "Q: How did you handle new refugees? Were there refugees... Jewish refugees coming in all the\ntime throughout the war?",
        "A: No. I tell you what happened finally. The Chinese or the Japanese--especially Chinese--\ncomplained that they leaved...that they let in all the people in Shanghai, you know. Because\nafter all, Shanghai was the...the largest city in China. When they complained, they say we\nwant to stop it. And they stopped it. I mean, after I came there was maybe one or two more\nboats. And there were nobody... Otherwise, they would have everybody. So they didn't. They\ndidn't allow it. They didn't allow it anymore, you know. And... uh, so it only the what were\nthere. And now you will ask how they make a living? That's also a curious, because most\npeople couldn't get...couldn't get a job. So what they did--they had a lot of people came, what\nthey brought belongings. So they went on the street, and they put up a table and sold second\nhand. Second hand. So that was the only one, because most people couldn't... I was lucky\nenough, because the Rabbi what I say they needed somebody. He said, \"Nobody is honest.\nNobody is honest.\" As a matter of fact, they had in the kitchen people and they couldn't trust\nthem. So...and they took me; and that 1s why I got the job as manager.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: Yah.",
        "Q: Okay. You talked about synagogue, and it's the original synagogue. Can you describe it?\nWhat was it like from the inside and the outside?",
        "A: I tell you. The synagogue, the one what was in that little place called Hongkou. It was on one\nof the main streets, and it was not a large one. It was not a large one. And as a matter of fact,\nyou know, in..in..in the original...in mainly most Sephardim there. But this was Askenazi;\nthis was a small, but it was...it was nice. But they had one in...in Shanghai, and that was a\nvery... Called uh Museum Road.\u201d And this was where the Yeshivas had all their... They had\nall their...where they learned, you know. Also, the matzahs, you know, they made there.\nThere was a beautiful place. As a matter of fact, there 1s a lady in the home and she 1s...she\ncome from Shanghai...but she is not a refugee. They lived for three...four generations there.\nSo...and...her son was still a year ago the...a Israel Consul General in Washington, you know.\nMaybe, his name was Jacob...Jacob.",
        "Q: Oh. Yes. Yes.",
        "A: You see.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And he was a wonderful... And he came here to visit his mother, and he real...told the people\neverything. And he lived...I think he went back to Israel. As a matter, she told me yesterday,\nher grandson comes to visit her this week. So anyway, they...they were original, and they had\neverything in...1n...in that synagogue there was a beautiful synagogue, and they had the\nservices there. As a matter of fact, we walked every Saturday afternoon. We walked all the\nway from--that was before the...before the...the ghetto--from Hongkou, we walked the way\nthe people called Broadway. But it was not a broad way, it was just a street called Broadway.\nOver the Garden Bridge; and that was about an hour walk. And every Saturday afternoon,\nthere was a very orthodox family. And they real...they had a real Oneg Shabbat, you know.\nAnd also on...on Sukkos [NB: Sukkot]. The Sukkos in ... is not like in...in America. The\nsukkahs in...in...1n China 1s all from bamboo. The whole building. And...and this family,\nthey were also philantrophists. And they invited us; and they have...after that, they had\nrefreshments. So we went every day and we had a good...we singing there. That was... But it\nis also a very...the largest synagogue 1s...was in the French sector. And there were real...the\nreal service took place. Because I know one of the men of our kitchen what was from the\nboat, he got married there. So we went there to the wedding. And that was a beautiful\nsynagogue. And that was the largest Sephardic synagogue. They had a big choir, and...and...\nSo, 1n...1n other words, there was Russian Jews; but many Jews came from...from Iran, you\nknow, the...the...the...the original Jews that lived there. But now you will say what happened\nto the Jews? Today, there is no more Jews in Shanghai. Because even after the war, they\nmade a special old age home--and I had several people there what I visited--just for the\nEuropean Jews. And they took care of the...of the old people. But after the war, you know,\nthey all left; and the few that were left over during the...during the years, they disappeared.\nAnd there is...there was a few years ago here a big exhibition about...about the...the Jews\nfrom the...the original Jews from the...the original Jews they showed...so they had it here in\nthe [Sherburn (ph)| Museum. They had that exhibition. Okay. So I think I...I give you the\nmost fact of life in Shanghai.\n> This was the Beth Aharon synagogue, a Sephardic congregation.",
        "Q: Yes. You did indeed.",
        "A: Not only Jewish life, but also general.",
        "Q: You did indeed. Thank you. Tell us what happened to you. What happened to Walter Schnell\nwhen the war was over?",
        "A: What happened when the war was over? Finally, my...I heard from my mother...two cousins\nof my mother in New York. And finally, they were able to send me affidavit, the visa;\nbecause I didn't want to stay in China. I hated it. I mean, to stay there. Because I wasn't\ninterested to...to learn the language, either. Even I had to go every morning to the market and\nbuy everything for the kitchen. But a interesting thing is what you never know that the\nChinese there, they..they spoke a language--ping liang in English. Ping liang, they called it.\nSo in other words, I could communicate. So what happened I was called to the Consul\nGeneral in Shanghai. And I went there. That was right after the war. And the Consul\ninterviewed me, and he gave me a visa. But it was not so easy because, as I told you, many\npeople want to leave, and there wasn't so many, you know, ship available. I had to wait til I\nget a boat, but there is a...a company was...was very famous. American... American Lines\nwhat you called it; and they called every boat with a different name. My ship was called\nGeneral Gordon. So...America President Lines, they called it. And...so they called all their\nships. So finally, I got...I got the... I mean, they called me...and that was a...that I have a place\non the boat. But I tell you, all my friends came to the harbor. When I went to the top of the\nboat, and I was crying, you know. They all was still dance you know, and they were a little\nbit jealous because, you know, they had to stay there because the most people they had to\nstay a few more years. I was one of the first one to leave. That was, in...1n...I think, in April\n47, I think. So anyway, we went on the boat...over Hawaii, and we had special...see that we\ngot before...we had...uh...rations what they call it...and they saw that we got rations that we\ncould eat. Otherwise, we couldn't eat the food on the boat. So we saw that we got rations--\nkosher rations--from Shanghai, what we used. Because they didn't have like they have now,\nyou can order kosher food. But what happened when we came to...when we came to Hawaii-\n-and the main city is Honolulu--they...they...they were informed that we are coming. And we\nhad special... They came, and they sent us all kosher food, wine--everything. So they...was a\nJewish community. And we...we...stayed... stayed overnight there. No, we stayed on the...on\nthe boat; but they brought us from the boat to the...the Jewish community. And they had\nprepared for us a wonderful reception. We spent there the evening and...uh...and...they gave\nus. On the next day, we...they had arranged buses for us to made a round trip, so we could\nsee the whole Waikiki Beach. And everything was very interesting. And...uh...we took...we\ntook pictures and...uh... So we stayed one...one day in..1n..in...1n Hong Kong. And then we\nleft...we left and we stopped several in Japan, but we stopped only on several Harbors of\nKobe and only that we could get off the boat. But...uh...then we arrived in San Francisco.\nAnd, of course, people came there. There was already many people there in San Francisco,\nalso refugees. The interesting thing everybody wanted to stay there. And the Committee said,\n\"No. You can go many, many other places except... except San Francisco and New York.\nAnd my relatives told me the same things. Because they know when I come to New York,\nthey have to take care of me. So when they asked me in San Francisco--and there was a\nspecial committee for the new Americans--\"Where do you want to go?\" So I told them, \"To\nCalifornia.\" They say, \"Why?\" I said, \"I don't know anybody, but they told me the climate\nis..1S the best.\" So when I arrived here, I didn't know a soul. But I got several addresses what\nthey give me in the...you know, in...1n...1n San Francisco. In...1n San Francisco, I stayed there\nabout a month. So the Rabbis in there, they gave me addresses from Rabbi Seer. And\nthey...so they...they were very nice and took care of me. And so when I came in, so I didn't\nknow a soul. But anyway, little by little, you know. And then somebody...we have here an\norganization from where they took me the first day--Jewish Group of 1933. And they...they\nhave...uh...now a new organization, the Benefactors of the Children.",

So the lady, she\ncalled up the Jewish home and so I...I got a job in Jewish home.",

        "A: My name is Walter Schnell. And I was born on April 16, 1904.",
        "A: In Strehlen. This is Silesia...is the province of Silesia in Germany.",
        "A: You're welcome.",
        "A: My family was in four generations in the same place--in that little town of Strehlen, what is\nvery famous by a very famous man, name of Paul Ehrlich.\u2019 And we had a business in glass\nporcelain or crystal for four generation. It was by... my great grandfather found[ed] it. And\nhe came originally from a little town of Chels, Upper Silesia. That was the only place where\nJews could settle. And then the law got that people Jews could settle in other parts. So they\nsettled down in that little town and bought a house on the market place just opposite the city\nhall and we had this store for 110 years in the family. It went from father to son. And what\nhappened, if it wouldn't be that the Nazis came to power with the SA and SSA and SS,\nspecial life in this small towns were impossible anymore. And that is the reason we finally\ndecided to give it up and sell it, even we couldn't find a buyer who paid a lot money--because\nthey know that Jews had to sell 1t. So we had to sell..sold the business for a very low price.\nAnd we moved to the big city what was Breslau [NB: Wroclaw].",
        "A: That was in the...we sold it the end of 1937. And then we moved to the capital what was\nBreslau and we settled...we got a apartment in the Jewish section. That was Wall Street--\nWallstrasse. It was direct next to the Jewish Federation--they called it Judische Gemeinde--\nthe Jewish community. It was next door. And uh, we lived there. It was direct for all the\nJewish people on this same street were the seminar, the rabbinical seminar, what was very\nfamous. And also the...we had access to both the orthodox synagogue there--they called the\n' Winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine for 1908.\nStorch Synagogue. That was all next door.",
        "A: I was originally... You know, my parents wanted me to get...learn a trade. So I...they send me\nto the big cities. First I was in very big stores in Breslau; and after I finished there, they sent\nme to Berlin--what was at that time the capital...Capital of Germany--where I worked in the\nlargest store...largest firm what was in the wholesale 1n porcelain. They always also had to\nhave their own factory; and I took care of the business and I sold there. And I was very\nhappy there. But one day, one of my uncles came to visit. And he said, \"Better come home,\nbecause this will get worse and worse. The business...was the time already the Nazis started\nin 1933. And it got worse and worse. So I had to come back. That was in...in the year of\n1926. And help my father in the business. So it went...but it went worse and worse, and it\nwas impossible to continue for a long time.",
        "A: I came back. I was in Berlin from 1924 'til 1926. But I came back, because I unk...uh...about\nthe situation, what was very unbearable in the small towns. Much...it was much worse than\nliving in the big city, what not everybody know the other person.\nThey put it even in front of the railway station. \"Jews get out! Go to Palestine!\" So in other\nword, it was not that Hitler was in power, but it was the anti-Semitism was always in..in\nGermany a big factor. It also in this...1n this schule, I went there to the gymnasium. In\nGermany, they call the high school... They don't call 1t high school; they call it \"gymnasium.\"\nAnd it was when you was only one of the few Jewish people, you got ignored. Or the people\ndidn't like the Jews.",
        "A: What happened. It...year by year...I mean I tried the best. We had a big window and one\nnight, the Nazis just destroyed all the windows. They throw stones and also...what\nhappened...you couldn't have...they brought laws out...you couldn't hire...only employee\nAryan people. That mean...Aryan mean German people. We had in our household what you\ncall a maid, and the father came there and said...told her, \"Get out. You shouldn't work for\nthe Jews.\" So big...so it was the anti-semitism that they all was afraid or there was special to\nthe propaganda was so big that Gentile shouldn't work. Now I tell you another story. I used\nto go in the evening after the store closed to work. And it was geting worse and worse. And\nwe know in the small town, everybody knew everybody. The other...the Gentile people\ndidn't even look at you and didn't greet you. I remember one night I went to the railway\nstation to pick up my parents who went to the big city...to pick...picked them up. I was\nfollowed by the Nazis. They followed me everyday and they...I was afraid to go out\nespecially in the evening. It was getting worse and worse. That what happened between 1926\nand '37. So we had...even my father said, \"This business is for hundred ten years 1n the\nfamily. It should be in the family. You shouldn't sell it.\" Now I have to make an interruption.\nWhen we had our hundred anniversary-- and this was in 1926. It was a big celebration in that\nlittle town, because there was no other business was...was that long hundred years existing.\nSo not only the mayor came, and everybody, all the big..the big uh people in the town. And it\nwas real...a big celebration. And this paper, the largest paper...there were two papers in the\ntown...they both made all big stories about the business. They even made the poem and it\nwas just wonderful. And as..as a matter of fact, the editor came the day before to me and\ninterviewed me and the...the whole paper was full about our hundred year anniversary. But it\nchanged radically. Just after this, a few years...years later, people didn't come in the store. In\nother words, we were unable to exist because people were afraid because our store was direct\non the...on the...most visible place at the marketplace so they were afraid to come in the\nstore. And then became the big boycott. That was on the Ist of April 1933. They put Nazis in\nfront of the store and say don't buy at Jews...buy Jews. So in other words, people were afraid\nto come and buy. So in other words, we had to make the very difficult decision. We couldn't\nget on see as big...as good as possible and we..uh. organized a sale. There was only allowed\nif the sale is for giving up the store. So...and that was on the end of 1937 when we had to sell\nour store, and we had a big house there too. And, uh, even the people who lived there as our\nrenters were afraid to live in the house what belonged to Jews.",
        "A: We had to sell the house, and we sold the house together with the..with the..with the\nbusiness, and as you can imagine, they gave very little because they know that the...that we\nhad to do it. So in other words, the price was...was not what the house was worth and what\nthe...what the..business was worth.",
        "A: Yes. We moved...we moved to Breslau. That is not far away, is about 25 miles, 35\nkilometers, and we settled weeks before. We went there. My mother went there and...uh...we\nfound a apartment in a house what were Jewish...owned by Jewish people. It was next to the\nJewish community center.",
        "A: This I tell you. We were only 2 children, and my parents and...and...my...my...my sister and\nme. That was 4 people. And the apartment was not...it was...belonged to...to\nothers...to...to...to Jewish sisters, so we...we rented it from them, but were were very\ncomfortable. It was..uh..not big. It was a few rooms, but we were glad that we was in a, ina\nplace where we...nobody knew us. And that was the advantage that in the beginning in the\nbig city you could go on the street and nobody called you names of the Jew because in the\nbig city opposite in this war, everyone 1n the city....this small city had only about 10,000\npopulation. So in other words, we were relieved. But it didn't last long. As you know,\nthat...Hitler gave all the laws against the Jews, and that was in...in 1938. To just remind you\nthat what happened in Paris, a Jew by the name of Hershel Grynszpan shot an officer in\nParis, you know, from the German Embassy. And then that what happened the Aktion\nagainst the Jews.",
        "A: No. I'll tell you what happened. When we moved to the big city, I didn't want to sit and do\nnothing. So, we had in our business a lot of people what we know who came from the other\nplaces and showed what...we had somebody in Breslow who owned a wholesale...a glass\nbusiness. So I went to them and, uh, I got a job there. I worked there to go around in the\ncity...g0 out...go to several enterprises and sold them...and that what what I did. Sold the\nglassware what..what the...what their business was. And then, in the meantime, the Nazis\nhad prepared also already what to do in the case of emergency. What did they do? They had\nregistered at all the Jews at the..the headquarters. In other words, when the Kristallnacht\nstarted and the order by Goebbels to arrest all the Jews. They had the names. So they went\nto every apartment, every house, and picked them up. But what happened...I wasn't there,\nbecause I was in the business--which was about maybe 10 blocks away. So they came to my\nfather; and they asked him, \"Where's your son?\" And he said, \"He works in a place.\" \"Give\nus the address.\" He said, \"I don't know.\" Even if he know, he didn't want to tell them. So I\nwas Safe at that time. As a matter of fact, when I came home that night they were surprised\nthat I was surprised. Because I was hiding. I know what was... what happened, what went on.\nSo I was hiding in the attic all day, when I went home. I didn't imagine it would it would\ncontinue the next day. But at first, I want to tell you what happened in the Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Just to me.",
        "A: So I had my own room in that building what I told you was just next door. When in the\nnight, middle of the night, I hear that terrible noise and I didn't know what...what happened.\nWhat happened was that the Nazis came in the back of the Jewish community center..was\nthe orthodox synagogue of Breslau. And they called it Storch Synagogue. But the Nazis was\nafraid. It was this building was direct in the middle of...of many apartment houses, and they\nwere afraid to put it afire...sit afire, because it would have burned out the whole\nneighborhood. So what they did, they just crushed and destroyed the windows and the\ninterior and that was that noise. But in the meantime, that was the main synagogue that was\nabout 10 blocks away, they called the new Synagogue. The most beautiful building with a\nbig cupola, and they set it afire. And this was what I saw and what I heard in the\nKristallnacht. But the main thing happened the next day, they not only went to the every\nhouse...and in that neighborhood, there was only Jews living...in the streets where we lived,\nbut they went also in the street in the buses and they..they caught all on the street. Jews what\nthey caught. And brought them...brought them to the police stations. Now, I tell you what\nhappened with me. I went the next morning to a business because I was the impression that\nthe razzia against the Jews was finished, but I made a big mistake. They continued and so\nwhen I made the mistake at lunchtime to go out of our complex where the business were.\nWhen I run direct in the hands of the Gestapo. When I came out I saw four people. Two\nGestapo who just had arrested two Jews. They asked me, \"Are you a Jew?\" Well, no; I\ncouldn't say not. \"So...so come with us.\" If] would run away, they would they would have\nshoot at me...shoot me..shot me. So there was about..from there a few blocks away was the\nlocal police station. And when we came there we found a lot of people already there. So they\ncalled up the main headquarters...police headquarters...was just opposite where the new\nsynagogue was. Please send us a big truck. We have a lot of people here. And we all was\nbrought to the headquarters from the Gestapo. They took all our belongings and they took\nthe fingerprints and we had downstairs was a big garden or a place. There was thousand and\nthousand people and they kept us there the whole day...the evening. And they had a big\nreason for that. They wanted to wait til 1t was dark because they didn't want to show the\npopulation what's going on. When it was dark, they put us in a big column. There was a few\nthousand people and they walked with us through the whole city to the main railway station.\nBut we came by the...the synagogue and we were so shocked to see what happened to that\nbeautiful place. It was all burned out. When we came finally, after walking a half hour, to the\nmain station, there was always already a train waiting so they put us all in a train and in each\nplace they put a special of their people, a police man. And I was surprised. I met a lot of\npeople there, and we went...we had no idea where the train would go. Nobody knew about it.\nWe traveled the whole night, about 20...over 20 hours. And finally we arrived at a very\nfamous place, the city of Weimar. Weimar is very famous by two big poets, Goethe and\nSchiller. And we knew exactly that here that city was a big concentration camp.",
        "A: I tell you exactly what happened. I knew, because an uncle of mine was about 6 months\nbefore there. And they had arrested him in Berlin and sent him there. And he died there,\nbecause he was on a special diet and he couldn't get the food. And I went special...I told my\nfather, I went to... When they sent the ashes to Berlin, I went special there; and it was there\non the big cemetery in Weissensee (ph) in Berlin and they had a big chapel. And I had my\ncase...briefcase; but the whole ceremony were observed... witnessed by the Nazi, by the\nGestapo. So I was afraid to move around, because they was looking for something. So that 1s\nwhy I know that my uncle was there. And what...what was his crime? He went one evening\nto the synagogue, he had a yahrtzeit [Yidd: remembrance of a deceased person on the\nanniversary of his or her death] for his father--my grandfather. And when he came there, the\nplace was closed. And he want to know...and he went around to the Gestapo watched him.\n\"What...what you want to do here?\" So they arrested him; and they took him right away to\nthe Gestapo headquarters in Berlin and they sent him to Buchenwald. And there where he\ndied. So in other words, I knew about Buchenwald. I heard about Buchenwald, so he was\nthere before I came there. So what...what happened now? We had to ran in Weimar. They\nput us in the station; and they warn, \"Don't move.\" And then we had to run through an\nunderground tunnel. And there was on both sides Gestapo Nazi men with [Gemitkolben\n(ph)], with uh...",
        "A: With clubs. And they beat us, beat up. Everybody beat up. And I know I saw when people\nfell down, among them was my boss where I worked in Breslau. He was a wonderful Jewish\nman and he also died in Buchenwald because they beat him...they beat him to death. That\nwent before we came to the buses. Then they loaded us on the buses. And they shouted,\n\"Don't look. Don't look on this side.\" And I made the mistake. I looked and they threw a\nstone at me. And it was a miracle the stone didn't...didn't hit me. So finally we arrived in\nBuchenwald and there was already 20,000 people there. When we came they didn't know\nthat so many people were coming. They came from all over Germany. So the...our place\nwhere we were supposed to stay wasn't finished. And they were still building. So we...we\nhad to...out...the whole day sitting outside on the grass and sitting and waiting. Then in the\nevening we went in that place and people got crazy. They had around watchtowers and they\nhad a electric fence. I remember the first three nights was worst night I ever remember\nbecause people were not allowed to go outside. The people lost their mind. They run around.\nThere was five buildings. They run around the buildings and just from the watchtowers, the\npeople on the watchtowers starting shooting them...shot them and the people shouted and\ncried and I heard that all night. But the worst thing happened the next day. We were allowed\non the day to go out, but many people didn't go out. It was terrible cold. Buchenwald is...1s\nhigh in the mountains... that camp, and it was special built for this purpose. What happened\npeople went and went to the electric fence..fence. As soon as they touched them, they got\nkilled, automatically. But not only this, everybody who touched this same person got also\nkilled. When I saw that, how people fell down on the floor. When they let them laying there.\nAnd it was a terrible sight, but there was a much worse thing. It was impossible to escape\nfrom there. Every morning we had appeal at 6:00. They called us out and we had to stay\nthere and they counted us, and when somebody was missing we had to stay there the whole\nday until they found the person, brought. But some people were able to escape, and they\nescaped to Czechoslovakia, and the...the German government what was already the Nazi\ngovernment demanded to send them back. So the worse day was...1n Buchenwald was when\nthis man was sent back and he was condemned to die on the gallows. And we were\nforced...there was an announcement through the loud speaker [and] everybody from all the\nbarracks had to come out and watch. And, of course, it was a terrible thing to see what\nhappened. And we were supposed to watch this, the hanging of this man. So you can\nimagine what the mood was. We were not allowed to walk to work because...but they\nwanted us to do something, so we had to move everyday the stones from one place to the\nother, to the other corner, and we was busy this. The food, of course, the food were terrible.\nIn the beginning they gave us nothing and then they got...they get everybody should go and\nget the money what they had brought and what they took away from the people, they brought\nthe food. But, of course, the dishes, we all had to drink the soup from the same bowl--\neverybody. And they gave us [wall fish (ph)]...[wall fish (ph)] food. So the conditions were\nworse and worse. We had special arranged services and the Rabbis there went around and\nsay \"Please eat\" because there was many people they didn't want to eat the food because it\nwasn't kosher. So the rabbis went around and told the people, but some didn't...they didn't do\nit anyway. But what happened is that we had secretly arranged services. Every morning we\nput outside...somebody watched that nobody came from the...from the people there...from\nthe Nazis...and we had our prayers. But another thing happened every day on the appell. On\nthe morning appell, that the Nazi what were in charge, they took off and counted and they\npunched the people. So I was smart enough not to stand in the first row that I didn't get\npunched. But what happened that the people...the conditions got everyday worse, and people\ndied from starving. We was...the conditions in the barracks was even worse. We were laying\non just wood. There was no blanket. There was nothing. And there was some people had\nfood. Some people had money. They could buy. So they helped the people, the others. Now\nwe come to the first Erev of Hanukkah. I was there; and that was a wonderful thing. We\nwere sitting in our barracks and sung the Hanukkah songs. And we also had prepared... The\npeople had money. They brought special cookies and a cake.",
        "A: There was a store. They had a store there; and the people who got money, they could go and\nbuy it.",
        "A: But for me, the most surprise happened on the second day of Hanukkah. In the morning, I\nheard over the loudspeaker my name called. And they said, \"Please...\" Not \"please.\" \"Come\nall the people...\"--I was not the only one--\"Come after, to the office.\" So when I came to the\noffice, they told me that they got a paper from Breslau, from my parents, that they had\nbooked for me a passage to Panama. And that was the one what my cousin told him [that]\nmy mother went to the Consulate. And I have the documents; and so that was the only reason\nthat they let me go. So after that, in the afternoon, they put us on buses. They gave us even\nsome money; because it was a long, a long trip with the railway. So we went first with the\nbus to Weimar, and they put us there in that...1n that train. On this train, was the first station\nwas Leipzig. That was a very big city. It's very famous. There goes to there every year a very\nbig fair. And there lived a lot of Jews, maybe...mostly Jews from the east from Poland. And\nthey had prepared for us a special reception; and they gave us some... And so we was on the,\nof course, on this station was a very large station. But I wanted to go out, because I know this\ncity very well. Because I went every...every year to that fair. And I went in the night for a\nwalk. And I was amazed I saw how the Jewish store was all destroyed, all the windows. And\nit was terrible. I went all the places and all the streets; and I saw it. And so it happened in\nevery city in Germany. They destroyed in the night from the 8th to the 9th of November\n1938. That was the day of the Kristallnacht. So they destroyed it. Then I went back to the\nstation and back to the train; and we arrived in the morning. In the morning, the next\nmorning, we arrived in the...in the Breslau, in the railway station. But in...they had told us in\nBuchenwald before they let us go. They say, \"The first thing you come...you arrive at home,\nyou have to go to the Gestapo and report. And they will tell you what to do.\" But we made a\nvery big mistake, and I make the biggest mistake. In this...in this..in the station...in the train,\nwe talked to the other people. And we said, \"No, it is Friday.\" You know, Friday. We came\non Friday. \"We will go...we will not go. We will go on...\" I mean, Friday night, we thought\nwe wait for Monday. And what happened with me, when I came Monday to the Gestapo,\nthey said, \"When did you come?\" I said, \"We came Friday night.\" \"Why didn't you come\nthe next morning?\" I say the reason was that I was very dirty and all, the... when we was in\nBuchenwald we had...we couldn't change our clothes. We couldn't take no bath, no shower;\nand I wanted to be clean. But they didn't...they said, \"Wait here.\" And I waited and waited\nand waited. And my parents were worried...were very worried, because I say early I will\ncome back. So what happened? It was a Saturday. And they left me wait the whole morning\nfrom 9 o'clock til 1 o'clock. And then they called me in and said, \"Why didn't you come?\nYou know what we will do. We will send you to Dachau. To another concentration camp,\nbecause you didn't obey the order.\" And I was very scared. So finally I went home, and my\nparents...what happened. I had to wait. I was the last one but everybody...all was gone.",
        "A: Everybody was gone. So finally, we had to report every week. That was the order. Every\nweek, we had to come to the Gestapo and tell them what we have done to get out. That was\nthe condition to get out of Germany. And I was the one who really were in charge, because\nwhen the other people came on the day when everybody was asked the most people didn't do\nnothing. And they threatened them. But I had prepared already a lot. I wrote to all the...to all\nthe ship lines and everybody. And I...they promised me as soon as they have a passage... So,\nin other words, they were satisfied. So finally I went to the Gestapo: \"Do you have a ship for\nme. I want to get out.\" So anyway, I got one day a telegram from the Italian airline what was\nin Munich. And they said, \"We have a passage for you.\" It was just a holiday of Shavuos\n[NB: Shavuot] in the same week; and when I came home my parents were very upset. I said,\n\"I have...I just got a...a...telegram. And I went to Jewish Community because I had paid for\nthem a lot money to help me for my immigration. And what happened, they give me...they\ngave me the rest. So they say, \"It is too late to come to Munich. You go direct to Genoa.\"\nNot Geneva...Genoa. That was the port where the largest ship called the Bianca Mano...the\nlargest ship from the Italian airline...ship line. And I went...I went with the bus...with the\ntrain from Breslau to Genoa. But in the meantime, we went over the Alps and it was a very\nlong trip. And they didn't allow us any money. We were all only allowed one dollar. That\nwas 4 [deutsche ]mark in that time. And the rest I had to pay for the first train. So when I\narrived, I had nothing left. So when we came on at night in Genova... It wasn't night. And we\nhad no place to sleep. We was a whole...1t was maybe 20, 25 people. We walked around the\nstreets and we looked for a place where to stay. And all the places were full because this\nwas...thousands of people went there, left there for the trip. So we went...I went finally I got\na room was a attic, was not even a window. When the next morning I left for the\nheadquarters of the airline what was...",
        "A: Excuse me. The ship line. And when I came tn the middle of the town, it was a sign at the\nwindow \"We moved today to the Harbor because on account that the boat is leaving.\" So in\nother words, I had to...to...to walk to the harbor. And what happened when I came there\nnobody understood English or no German, only Italian. Because they had written to me,\n\"Pick up your ticket there.\" So finally somebody helped me with the language and I got it. I\ngot my ticket. But they say, \"Don't go back to the hotel because that you don't miss the ship.\"\nThis was in the noontime...in the morning...ship left at 4:00. And I got plenty trouble.\nBecause when I left in the morning, I hadn't paid for my room. And somebody had to pay.\nAnd they looked for me, and they wanted to arrest me. And, you know, because they said,\n\"Stay here. Stay here and don't go back. Stay here, because you are here already; and go on\nthe boat and you'll get there this.\" But there was several classes there. A first class, a second\nclass, and a third class. And so the other people, they were looking for me; but they couldn't\nfind me. So when they came on our date, they wanted to get me arrested that I hadn't paid my\nhotel bill. Anyway, the trip was very painful. Because it was terrible hot and we came to\nthe...the...Red Sea, and it...it took a long time. We was impossible to sleep in the room. It\nwas too hot. We had to sleep on the...on the deck. But finally we arrived tn..in..1n Shanghai.",
        "A: I tell you. That this was only...I met...I got the original document. Maybe I have it here too.\nAnd what happened they said you have to come in person to Amsterdam and to introduce\nyourself, you know. But this was only, you know, a matter to get me out from Buchenwald. I\nmean because otherwise I never would get out from the concentration camp. So 1n other\nwords and what many people didn't know, Shanghai was the only place where people could\ngo without any papers. No visa. No affidavit. My parents, especially my mother, they tried to\nwrite to all the family. She had family in America, all over, to get a visa affidavit, but they all\nwas in such a state I mean in such that they couldn't afford it. So we didn't get no...and that\nwas the only...that is the reason I never had the idea to go to Shanghai because Shanghai had\na very bad name. But Shanghai this was the only thing...and that is the most people who\nwent there, they went there because they had no other choice. So that's the reason why I\ncouldn't take about from Panama you know. You want to know anything else?",
        "A: This is the pass, what you call identification, I mean, this of course in...1n...German. And\nthey put...there's a fingerprint and a picture and this is the President of the Police and there's\nthe Jew because every passport had to read the Jew in and say the name on the...all the...uh...\nwhere I came for and for Breslau. So this was the identification to get out of Germany. This\nis called the Heimatschein. And this...it proves that I am a citizen, that I am a...was still a\ncitizen. And that was important when you go outside in other country, that I prove I ama\ncitizen of Germany. This is here in Chinese, the fingerprints. This is the identification from\nShanghai. Because we had to, every time we go there to uh...to our uh...uh to some\norganization or to some office we had to identify that we are allowed, that we as...allowed to\nstay there. The picture of the fingerprint and the Chinese, that's a Chinese identification.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: And this is a very interesting. This is a document, Directory of Jewish Refugees. That shows\nyou that I am and everybody who was there--there was about 20,000 refugees in...Shanghai.\nAnd everybody...the Chinese government, the government of Shanghai, gave everybody this;\nbecause you have to show that. Otherwise, you would be expelled. So this 1s the Directory of\nJewish Refugees in Shanghai. I think that 1s.",
        "A: This is a interesting document. This is the Reichlands in Germany. And this was an\napplication, because they wanted to help the Jews that came from the concentration camp.\nWhen they have no other way where to go, [then] Durchgangslager [Ger: \"transit camp\" |--\nthat means a place in England. To go to a place in England, just for the time being to get out\nfrom Germany. And in other words...",
        "A: They created this. Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutscheland. This is the main organization\nwho represented the Jews in Germany. And they gave that out. But after I got the idea to\nShanghai to go... So many people went there--but only temporary--to England; because\nEngland wasn't safe at all. So I thought...so people asked me--my friends and my relatives--\n\"Why didn't you go there, instead [of] to Shanghai?\" So I thought they said you had to wait\nabout maybe a month to get an answer. In the meantime, it was already the rumor that pretty\nsoon the war will bring out...break out. And I thought I don't want to wait any longer. The\nother one I got right away. And that's the reason that I didn't go to England, and I went to\nShanghai. Okay.",
        "A: Okay.\nTAPE #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: I tell you when we arrived in Shanghai, of course we was welcomed because we were not\nthe first one. The interesting thing is there were many people there specially from Austria,\nVienna. And what I didn't mention before, on the boat there was 2,000 refuges...was the\nlargest ship whatever went to. And there was not a good...uh...uh...feeling between the\nGerman, towards, you know, Jewish. And there their meetings on the boat and we had our\nmeeting.... was not a good relationship. As a matter of fact, in Shanghai--because we came\nin...in the middle of '39--we arrived 27 of June, I think. And the other one, you remember in\nAustria happened the terrible thing when Hitler came and took over and the Jews...treated\nterribly Jews. So in other words, the right of the...the Jews from Vienna, Austria--the many\nof them went to Shanghai. So they took over the committees and everything, you know.\nThey were in charge. There was already established the Joint Distribution Committee, HIAS;\nand they had all taken over. They were in charge. So they had prepared for us, ordered big\ntrucks where they put us in, and they had already... Already there was many Jews in\nShanghai. They were already a big community. It was mostly Russian Jews. The Jews that\ncame from Vladivostok. And they arrived. They uh had everything organized. I just writing a\nbig story. You know, we have in...1n our home our uh wonderful magazine...",
        "A: ...called the Resident...Resident High Journal. And I write...I write many stories of them.\nAnd I just this week, I wrote a big story and that fits in this report. And is called \"The\nSassoon Family.\" Maybe you heard the name. And I write my own experience, there's also\nyears in Los Angeles. And in that story, I mentioned that. And there was a gentlemen with\nthe name of Sir Victor Sassoon. And he 1s the one who real... The Sassoon family was\nalways famous for philantrophy. Philantrophist. And he real did a big job. I met him right in\nthe beginning, because he provided not only the homes--they..they...they called it, in\nEnglish, \"the camps.\" But in...in...1n German, \"Heime\"--that mean \"homes.\" There was\nseveral homes; and they brought us first to a home [in] Kinchow [Road].",
        "A: In Shanghai.",
        "A: And..uh..but what happened... As a matter of fact, they brought all the most of the Jews...1n\nthe beginning, the Jews to a suburb called Hongkou [NB: Hongkew]...Hongkou. And this is\nof interest. The name 1s the street...after the street. There was a Kinchow [Road] home, and a\nSeward [Road] home, Pingliang [Road] home. So anyway, this Mr. Victor Sassoon, he was\nthe one who from his property he prepared. So we was in the beginning there. We couldn't\nstay there long, because they needed what originally school...school uh there. But 1t was\nbeginning. And it was a nice place; but later on, they put us to uh Pingliang--what I didn't\nlike it from the beginning. It was the whole ...whole thing I didn't like. It was far out. And I\nthought I would like to get in touch with a family what had a private place, because it's nicer\nto live...ltve with a family there in a home. So what happened, several people had money\nthere in the bank. And I also got from a cousin, he sent... He was able to...to Holland, to\nescape to Holland. And he worked for a big Jewish firm from Breslau, what he sent...he sent\nmoney for me. And I had it there in the Shanghai bank. So I had a little money. And I went\nto a Jewish family--also in Hongkou--and they give me a room in the attic. So they...they had\na restaurant in the...in the...in the first floor, they had a little restaurant. So that was...that was\nmuch better. But then came the proclamation. The Japanese put out a proclamation that all\nthe Jews had to live in a ghetto. And they made a ghetto all the people, the many Jews were\nable to live in..in...Shanghai in the French Concession--French district in Shanghai--and they\nall was forced to move back. Of course, this was very difficult, because they took advantage\nand...and ask a lot of money. And I had a few bosses there; because I was lucky enough to\nget a job...find a job. And, as I told you before, we founded a kitchen. We founded after Pearl\nHarbor a kosher kitchen in Shanghai...in Shanghai.",
        "A: Oh, yes. I tell you what happened. When we was in Pearl Harbor, I was already in\nanother...1n another camp...I mean in other camp. And I heard a nice night of Pearl Harbor a\nvery big noise because we didn't live far...very far from the ocean...from the river, Yangtze\nRiver. When we heard what happened, the...the Japanese had sunk British ship. Shanghai\nwas one of the biggest, largest ports and harbors in the world. And there was everyday came\nships from all over the world, and there was in the harbor British ships and they sunk..sunk\nthe ships. And went the next morning on the street, I think I went to the service, I was\nsurprised to see Japanese guards standing on every corner and to clear the traffic, and they\nhad taken over. Before the Japanese had only...they had one section. But after Pearl Harbor,\nthe Japanese took over all Shanghai and they all... There was a police station there, and they\ngot..took over...and there was a man with the name of Ghoya.",
        "A: And he was the most rigorous person you have thought of. The Jews called him the \"King of\nthe Jews.\" What happened, get...every Jew, after the Japanese took over, had no right to\nmove freely. As I mentioned before, when they wanted to go to Shanghai, as I said, we all\nlived in Hongkou. Was a suburb. And they could go on the...on the bus. They had to have a\npass. And the..Japanese ordered a Pao Chia--that is a special...a special organization what\nconsisted from the refugees.\u201d They had to watch on all the exits that nobody leaves...leaves\nthe...the place where they lived. And what happened, when they had to come and make\napplication to come in the morning to that police station, what I saw it with my own eyes,\nbecause the place where I worked was just on the same street. And..uh..they had to...made\napplication, they had to stand in line. And he came out, and he punched everybody or hit\neverybody. Because if he didn't like a face or somebody and he..they were depended on him\nto get the permission. Many of them had shop. That is the reason. They had a shop in\nShanghai. But they couldn't own it. They had to special....every month to get a new...a new\npass. So he treated them...he treated them terrible. And he came...he came to our kitchen also\nand to...to...uh...to give the permission of...we have to get a permit. And he tasted it, you\nknow, and he asked me so many questions about food but I had to answer them you know,\nbecause we...we had to have a special permit to have that kitchen. So anyway I had to go to\nPolice station and get...uh, they interviewed me because he them I am the manager of the\nkitchen. So that what happened. So anyway the refugees had it...had it very hard. Very hard\nin...in all the...the..because they were watched...uh...and nobody were allowed to talk\nanything. And the same thing happened with the... we had two newspaper...our newspapers,\nwhat the refugees gave. And they were under censorship. They were not allowed to write\nanything. But there was a very interesting thing. This section where we lived, Hongkou, was\ndestroyed in the civil war in China. And it was terrible when we arrived. We saw the\nwhole...the buildings, everything was..was either hole the buildings. And they had a little\nstreet there--at the moment, I don't...the name--and what the refuges did is unbelievable.\nThey made from this condition a wonderful business street. The people, not only the Jews,\nthey came from Shanghai. They came special there. They had wonderful cafes and\nrestaurants and bakeries and grocery stores and that was all...they did it all them by\nthemselves. They even had in..a night club, where they danced at night. So that was...people\ncame from all over Shanghai. And that was a wonderful, wonderful thing what...what\nhappened.",
        "A: So that was...that was the life in Shanghai, you know. And uh..in the evening the people\nwent a little out, you know, had a little...went to a cafe and..and...but now one terrible thing\nhappened and that is the most thing what you should know about it. After the...about in the\nyear 1944, the Americans started to bomb Shanghai. But one day they made a terrible\nmistake. They bombed the...the quarters, the Jewish quarters. But we knew that the\nAmerican came every morning exactly at 10:00. And we were ordered, all the refugees, to go\nthe worse..the biggest jail in that...where we lived...at the biggest jail. And we have to get\nthere and go in the basement to be protected from the bombing. So went everything morning\nat 10 o'clock and we went...we went in the basement and an hour later we went out and\neverything burned up But one day they came a different time. And I remember that special.\nAs I told you before, the kitchen what I had the..was a thousand people. But the most people\n* Jewish police force in the ghetto which was supervised by the Japanese.\ndidn't own...a few people ate there. Much of it, they came and they picked up their meal. And\nthey came from all over.",
        "A: Yes. Not the Jewish community. The Jewish community was something else. But we...we\nhad our own. The Jewish community fed many more people. When I met Victor Sassoon\nwhen he came. He came direct, and looked in the kitchen and saw how everything went on.\nBut I talk now about the kosher kitchen. So I remembered exactly and this is the worse day\nwhatever happened. It was at noontime and we had just fed the people and the people were\non the way home from the kitchen when the bombs. Many people got killed. I mean for the\nrefugees. And I was...I mean I was in the...I was still there. But we found out after that,\nthere's a lot people...beside of that, of course, many Chinese people, too. They...because it\nwas a Chinese neighbourhood. And that was the worst day whatever happened. And what\nhappened must be some mistake that the American...the American, they...they bombed it.\nThe same thing what with Auschwitz, you know. They always say, \"Why didn't they bomb\nAuschwitz?\" So...and this was a terrible thing. Because we knew, of course, we knew all the\npeople, you know. And later on, when I came home, to my place where I lived... I lived that\ntime with Chinese people because we were not allowed to live anymore in the Jewish\nneighbourhood and in the camps. We had to live in the...outside...you know and I got\npermission to live outside...outside the ghetto. So I lived with Chinese people. When I come\nhome I wanted to know what happened to you...happened with the other people, you know,\nand, uh, so because a lot of people got up in flames by the bombing. A lot of people got\ndestroyed. That was the 14th of June in 1944 when that...when that happened. And..uh...then\nafter this...what happened after this, the...the American came to liberate, you know,\nafter...when the war was finished. And they came special..and that the first time that we also\nNegros, you know, they in the army. And they came the...they came in the camps and we..we\nhad big celebration. As a matter of fact, when the war over, we heard it over the radio, you\nknow. It was broadcast. And we all..we...we had always in the night somebody put on a...put\non a radio. And when it said, the war is finished, we danced in the street, you know, and, of\ncourse, that was wonderful. That we knew the war was over and we had a chance...a chance\nto go..to go and we..we could go, of course, that we go to...Shanghai to the city, and..uh...\nYes, that was...that was...uh... beautiful. Also, I want to tell you now about the famous\nJewish families there. There was a very famous families. One of the most famous was\nKadoories. And they did also a lot for the refugees. They founded...made a special school.\nAnd that school was wonderful. Because all the...there was so many Jewish children, and\nthey...they all went to that...to that school--in...in the Kadoorie school.\u2019 And as I say, the...the\nSassoons. There was also others, they real...they real... But when we...when we founded the\nkitchen, they sent me to the rich Russian Jews to get them interested, you know. And as a\nmatter of fact, they real...the realy gave...gave... They helped us. They gave money, you\nknow; because to make such a kitchen to keep... And...and I was in charge for 4...4 years of\n* This was the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association School on Tongshan Road.\nthat kitchen. And...and as I said before, our kitchen was famous, because our food was\nexcellent compared with the community kitchen. So the many people, they...they didn't even\ncare about kosher food, they came just... And we didn't ask no questions, you know. But they\nhad to pay. They had to pay you, know. Not...they didn't get it for free. So, I think this\nthe...what you are interested in.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yah. This is very interesting. I tell you we had...in our...the one room was interesting in that\nmeeting to about a kitchen was a Rabbi. What I didn't mention that we had in Shanghai about\n900 Yeshivas. And why did they come there? They never had the intentions to go to\nShanghai. They were caught up with Pearl Harbor. And they were originally in Kobe. Kobe,\n[Japan]... And they had to leave, and they came to Shanghai. And they real...they real\ncontributed to the Jewish life during the...that time, that terrible time...the years in the war a\nlot. Because they not only created the organizations, the Agudath Israel, but they\nalso...uh...was very active with Kashruth. And they had the one what was in our...in our\nRabbi Margulies. And he were appointed Mashkiach; and he came every morning. And also\nnot only that our home that where the kitchen was--and I told you it was about on the same\nstreet where the police station was. They also had, you know, in the...the holidays wonderful\nservices. And I remember, opposite lived White Russians. And they are the worst...the worst\nanti-Semites. And they real..they made...they give us a lot of trouble and they all lived in the\nsame neighborhood. And I had the man opposite, he asked me the next morning, \"Tell me\nwhat you had last night. You had a wonderful choir, you know.\" We had choir, and\nhazzanen [NB: cantors] and beautiful. So anyway, the holidays were wonderful. And...and I\nsay the...the Yeshivas, they were very active and they had, of course, an interesting...the had\nin our place...in our...they had weddings, you know. And when they have weddings, you\nknow, a Hassidishe wedding--that is the most remarkable thing. So anyway they all took\nplace in our kitchen, because they knew it was kosher. So anyway, there was about 900.\nThey came from different Yeshivas. And they had to stay. But what happened, when the war\nwas over, they were the first to leave; because they got the first opportunity to leave the\nuh...Shanghai.",
        "A: Yes. As a matter of fact, we had, you know, services. There was, as a matter of fact, a..from\n* Yidd: a person responsible for oversight of kosher kitchens, for ensuring compliance with the\nJewish dietary laws.\nour kitchen, there was not far of the original synagogue. They called it...what would I mean...\nAnd this was...the synagogue existed a long time ago. And as I told you, they had...the real\nservice took place there. Also, they had the organization Betar--you know, a Zionist\norganization. And so this took place in...in the... They had also in Shanghai several\nsynagogues. But Askenazim, and also the Sephardim, you know. The Sephardim. And so\nuh...1n other words, there was real Jewish life. I mean, it...Jewish life went on. And they had\nmany, many uh places there. On holidays, they had special place, because in the Jewish\npersons...with the German Jews, many people who don't go to the whole year. Mainly\nAmericans even worst. They...but they go in the High Holidays. So for the High Holidays,\nwe...we rented special places for the people. So anyway, Jewish life was very, very active all\nthe years, you know. And they had...they had the...minyan every day. I remember once on a\nSunday, I...] walked on the street and there was someone: \"Please, come in.\" You know.\nSo in other words, the uh Jewish life went on very good.",
        "A: No. I tell you what happened finally. The Chinese or the Japanese--especially Chinese--\ncomplained that they leaved...that they let in all the people in Shanghai, you know. Because\nafter all, Shanghai was the...the largest city in China. When they complained, they say we\nwant to stop it. And they stopped it. I mean, after I came there was maybe one or two more\nboats. And there were nobody... Otherwise, they would have everybody. So they didn't. They\ndidn't allow it. They didn't allow it anymore, you know. And... uh, so it only the what were\nthere. And now you will ask how they make a living? That's also a curious, because most\npeople couldn't get...couldn't get a job. So what they did--they had a lot of people came, what\nthey brought belongings. So they went on the street, and they put up a table and sold second\nhand. Second hand. So that was the only one, because most people couldn't... I was lucky\nenough, because the Rabbi what I say they needed somebody. He said, \"Nobody is honest.\nNobody is honest.\" As a matter of fact, they had in the kitchen people and they couldn't trust\nthem. So...and they took me; and that 1s why I got the job as manager.",
        "A: Yah.",
        "A: I tell you. The synagogue, the one what was in that little place called Hongkou. It was on one\nof the main streets, and it was not a large one. It was not a large one. And as a matter of fact,\nyou know, in..in..in the original...in mainly most Sephardim there. But this was Askenazi;\nthis was a small, but it was...it was nice. But they had one in...in Shanghai, and that was a\nvery... Called uh Museum Road.\u201d And this was where the Yeshivas had all their... They had\nall their...where they learned, you know. Also, the matzahs, you know, they made there.\nThere was a beautiful place. As a matter of fact, there 1s a lady in the home and she 1s...she\ncome from Shanghai...but she is not a refugee. They lived for three...four generations there.\nSo...and...her son was still a year ago the...a Israel Consul General in Washington, you know.\nMaybe, his name was Jacob...Jacob.",
        "A: You see.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And he was a wonderful... And he came here to visit his mother, and he real...told the people\neverything. And he lived...I think he went back to Israel. As a matter, she told me yesterday,\nher grandson comes to visit her this week. So anyway, they...they were original, and they had\neverything in...1n...in that synagogue there was a beautiful synagogue, and they had the\nservices there. As a matter of fact, we walked every Saturday afternoon. We walked all the\nway from--that was before the...before the...the ghetto--from Hongkou, we walked the way\nthe people called Broadway. But it was not a broad way, it was just a street called Broadway.\nOver the Garden Bridge; and that was about an hour walk. And every Saturday afternoon,\nthere was a very orthodox family. And they real...they had a real Oneg Shabbat, you know.\nAnd also on...on Sukkos [NB: Sukkot]. The Sukkos in ... is not like in...in America. The\nsukkahs in...in...1n China 1s all from bamboo. The whole building. And...and this family,\nthey were also philantrophists. And they invited us; and they have...after that, they had\nrefreshments. So we went every day and we had a good...we singing there. That was... But it\nis also a very...the largest synagogue 1s...was in the French sector. And there were real...the\nreal service took place. Because I know one of the men of our kitchen what was from the\nboat, he got married there. So we went there to the wedding. And that was a beautiful\nsynagogue. And that was the largest Sephardic synagogue. They had a big choir, and...and...\nSo, 1n...1n other words, there was Russian Jews; but many Jews came from...from Iran, you\nknow, the...the...the...the original Jews that lived there. But now you will say what happened\nto the Jews? Today, there is no more Jews in Shanghai. Because even after the war, they\nmade a special old age home--and I had several people there what I visited--just for the\nEuropean Jews. And they took care of the...of the old people. But after the war, you know,\nthey all left; and the few that were left over during the...during the years, they disappeared.\nAnd there is...there was a few years ago here a big exhibition about...about the...the Jews\nfrom the...the original Jews from the...the original Jews they showed...so they had it here in\nthe [Sherburn (ph)| Museum. They had that exhibition. Okay. So I think I...I give you the\nmost fact of life in Shanghai.\n> This was the Beth Aharon synagogue, a Sephardic congregation.",
        "A: Not only Jewish life, but also general.",
        "A: What happened when the war was over? Finally, my...I heard from my mother...two cousins\nof my mother in New York. And finally, they were able to send me affidavit, the visa;\nbecause I didn't want to stay in China. I hated it. I mean, to stay there. Because I wasn't\ninterested to...to learn the language, either. Even I had to go every morning to the market and\nbuy everything for the kitchen. But a interesting thing is what you never know that the\nChinese there, they..they spoke a language--ping liang in English. Ping liang, they called it.\nSo in other words, I could communicate. So what happened I was called to the Consul\nGeneral in Shanghai. And I went there. That was right after the war. And the Consul\ninterviewed me, and he gave me a visa. But it was not so easy because, as I told you, many\npeople want to leave, and there wasn't so many, you know, ship available. I had to wait til I\nget a boat, but there is a...a company was...was very famous. American... American Lines\nwhat you called it; and they called every boat with a different name. My ship was called\nGeneral Gordon. So...America President Lines, they called it. And...so they called all their\nships. So finally, I got...I got the... I mean, they called me...and that was a...that I have a place\non the boat. But I tell you, all my friends came to the harbor. When I went to the top of the\nboat, and I was crying, you know. They all was still dance you know, and they were a little\nbit jealous because, you know, they had to stay there because the most people they had to\nstay a few more years. I was one of the first one to leave. That was, in...1n...I think, in April\n47, I think. So anyway, we went on the boat...over Hawaii, and we had special...see that we\ngot before...we had...uh...rations what they call it...and they saw that we got rations that we\ncould eat. Otherwise, we couldn't eat the food on the boat. So we saw that we got rations--\nkosher rations--from Shanghai, what we used. Because they didn't have like they have now,\nyou can order kosher food. But what happened when we came to...when we came to Hawaii-\n-and the main city is Honolulu--they...they...they were informed that we are coming. And we\nhad special... They came, and they sent us all kosher food, wine--everything. So they...was a\nJewish community. And we...we...stayed... stayed overnight there. No, we stayed on the...on\nthe boat; but they brought us from the boat to the...the Jewish community. And they had\nprepared for us a wonderful reception. We spent there the evening and...uh...and...they gave\nus. On the next day, we...they had arranged buses for us to made a round trip, so we could\nsee the whole Waikiki Beach. And everything was very interesting. And...uh...we took...we\ntook pictures and...uh... So we stayed one...one day in..1n..in...1n Hong Kong. And then we\nleft...we left and we stopped several in Japan, but we stopped only on several Harbors of\nKobe and only that we could get off the boat. But...uh...then we arrived in San Francisco.\nAnd, of course, people came there. There was already many people there in San Francisco,\nalso refugees. The interesting thing everybody wanted to stay there. And the Committee said,\n\"No. You can go many, many other places except... except San Francisco and New York.\nAnd my relatives told me the same things. Because they know when I come to New York,\nthey have to take care of me. So when they asked me in San Francisco--and there was a\nspecial committee for the new Americans--\"Where do you want to go?\" So I told them, \"To\nCalifornia.\" They say, \"Why?\" I said, \"I don't know anybody, but they told me the climate\nis..1S the best.\" So when I arrived here, I didn't know a soul. But I got several addresses what\nthey give me in the...you know, in...1n...1n San Francisco. In...1n San Francisco, I stayed there\nabout a month. So the Rabbis in there, they gave me addresses from Rabbi Seer. And\nthey...so they...they were very nice and took care of me. And so when I came in, so I didn't\nknow a soul. But anyway, little by little, you know. And then somebody...we have here an\norganization from where they took me the first day--Jewish Group of 1933. And they...they\nhave...uh...now a new organization, the Benefactors of the Children.",
        "A: Yes. And you know, as a matter of fact, we met the lady I mentioned--Mrs. Updike. And\nwe...she spoke last week in our place and in the other home, in the evening for Benefactors.\nSo in the...1in the temple. So any anyway, this is the newest organization. So the lady, she\ncalled up the Jewish home and so I...I got a job in Jewish home.",
        "A: And you know that was the old home that was still in...1n Los Angeles. So I am 41 years with\nthe home. Longer than anybody else. So...so now I think you know my...you know most of\nmy story.",
        "A: You're welcome. I hope I satisfied your...your expectations.",
        "A: I want to thank you very much for bringing me and interview me. I appreciate very much.",
