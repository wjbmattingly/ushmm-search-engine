        "NORBERT WOLLHEIM\nFebruary 18, 1992\nCorrection, this will be Sound Roll 1 syncing with Camera Roll 1, Take 1, Norbert Wollheim's\ninterview.\nShould I look at you or, or look at...\nYou should look at me, and I will interrupt you when we run out. When we run out, I will actually\nhear it. I'm sitting close enough to the camera. And, I'll probably let you finish your sentence, but\nthen I'll stop you.\nBeep.\nI'd like you to describe when and how your parents were deported, and the resistance that you and\nyour wife felt at the time and your joint pledge to each other.\nWell, my parents were deported in December, 1942, and they were part of the first transport, also\nfound out later to uh, Auschwitz. Um, I've never see, I've never seen them again after that. And we\nwere aware, suddenly, of the fact that one day it will be us too that will be taken away from Berlin\nor wherever we used to live at this time. My parents, uh, had lived on the Eastern part of Berlin.\nMy then wife and I were living in, in, uh West, uh, the Western part of the ----------- with our child\nof 3 and a half years, and so, therefore, we knew that certain preparations had to be made before\nthat day in a way to get uh, we had knapsacks prepared, and some books, a chess set, toys for my\nchild, and so, and, irrespectful of the fact that we didn't know where, uh, uh, uh we had to go, when\nwe would be taken away, and um, so uh, we thought that uh, to be go, to go away would just be a,\nuh, a another, another part of this chapter, and that we had just to uh, um, uh, uh...find the\nendurance to uh, to uh, to uh, to uh survive, and then in order to survive the regime and, and, and\nwait for the ------liberations because when uh, my parents were deported and the turn came on us\nuh, the tides of, of the uh, of uh the uh, military events had ch, had turned already. It was of the\nStalingrad?? and my hopes and my feelings were that this was more or less the end of the uh, uh\nsuperiority of the uh German forces, and the German military power, and it was also certainly\nalready after --------------, when the British had broken uh, the uh, power of Oman and North\nAfrica, so the Germans were, were, were on the run. So, uh, we had hope that uh, also America\nwas also already in the war, and we uh, at least I feeling that Germany couldn't match the power",
        "and the economical and military power of the uh, uh Allies, especially of the America. America\nhad become part of the, that uh, the Germans didn't have any chance to win that war. And, so uh,\nwe build up this kind of inner resistance and hope that uh.\nWe have to stop because of the timing???\nBeep.\nTwo.\nSo, actually eh, when we were deported from Berlin in uh, February, yeah, so they march in 1943.\nIt was uh, after the uh, the uh, um, defeat of Stalingrad had become obvious to the whole world.\nBut also uh, interesting enough, uh it was the time when, for the first time uh, the uh, uh, allied air\nforces showed their superiority, and because I remember uh, a week I think before we were actually\ndeported, the uh, um, American Air Force made a major raid against Berlin, and the one of the\nhopes we had were that um, the railways leading to the East or wherever 1t was where we were\ngoing would be destroyed, but this hope was in vain.\nCan you describe the actual deportation when you and your wife and son were taken.\nWell, we were, we were, you know, they appeared. The uh, the Gestapo appeared in our--we were\nliving uh, in, in our own apartments at this time. Germany never had a ghetto. In Germany never\nhad ghettos. So uh, we were living in our apt and uh I had gotten some advice that I shouldn't go to\nmy, to work. I was at this time part of the slave labor program in Berlin, and uh, stayed at home\nwith my wife, then wife and child, and uh, uh, then uh, uh, we somehow heard that in, in the\nmorning the uh, elite SS had uh occupied uh the places where Jews worked in, in working groups,\nhad taken them away. And uh, then they came and appeared in the afternoon, asked us to get\nready, and um, uh, we were not complete, full-fully surprised. But, uh, I remember my, my son\nwas just sleeping, and my ------, my wife, asked, uh, these people, who were by the way not in\nuniform, uh, to give them a few more minutes to get the child ready and so, and uh, they agree.\nAnd then when we, when we left our apt, they sealed it with a, with a, with a, with a eagle of the uh\nNazi Reich, and they walked us down, and then when we came down, we saw a truck with SS\nguards with rifles, and for a moment uh, that was um, um, uh not a, a very discouraging and, and,\nand, but um, still we didn't know what they wanted it, but they, but then um, um, ask us to, to\nascend the truck, and we found other people on that truck uh, which was completely covered.\nPeople from out-inside couldn't see what's going on on the outside, and it turned out that these",
        "people who were driven around, who had been driven around before, were people who uh, whose\nhusbands had been taken from the, the different factories in Berlin. In other words, when they took\nthis action which they called the final solution in Berlin, they took a man from the uh, from these\nplaces where they were, where they were working, and then they went after the members of the\nfamily, and their different places, so that uh, uh, uh the families uh never saw each other again.\nThey were deported in a different way. I, luckily, was with my then with my then and, and, and\nchild, and then we were taken around in Berlin, that was the time of the blackout. You, you uh,\neven if we could have uh, looked out, you wouldn't uh, know what was going on. And we were\nriding around for quite some time, and then we landed somewhere, and, later found out it was, was\nsome kind of soldier barracks, uh, uh, where we were put overnight, and then uh, shifted to, to our\ncollection point from uh -------------- in, in Berlin, and uh, then the procedure of deportation started\nwith all kind of uh paperwork. Uh, certainly the, even in the middle of that war when everything\nwas short including paper, there was enough paper for all kind of procedures and, uh, we had to uh,\nuh declare our so-called uh funds, uh, our possessions, and we were served with a uh, with a uh,\nwith a uh, kind of uh, summons if you want to, saying that we had been uh, uh declared enemy of\nthe Reich uh because of our behavior, and that we would be deprived of our property, and uh,\nthese, this uh, this was served on all of us, including my then child of 3 and a half years, uh,\nbecause of also his outrageous behavior towards the German Reich. Uh, after 2 or 3 days when we\nwere taken, uh, kept there, we were, uh, taken by trucks to uh German uh, uh Freight railroad\nstation, and uh, put on on cattle cars, and uh, then uh this train with approximately 1000 people left\nBerlin. We were uh, we were on, on each of a, uh, uh, uh, uh, of these boxcars, there were\napproximately 60 to 70 people, just a bucket for uh sanitary purposes. Uh no water. Hardly any air\nbecause these were uh, in, and uh, in, in the afternoon, if I'm not mistaken, it was March 12, 1943,\nwe left Berlin in the direction to the East. Uh, I also vividly remember it was a Friday night, and\nuh, there was a lady, when uh, remembered it, and, obviously in preparation of the event, I don't\nknow, had taken some candles along, and, uh, uh lit the candle, uh, uh to celebrate the Sabbath, the\nJewish, the Jewish uh, uh Sabbath. And uh prayers were said, and uh it 1s--------------- when you\nlook back on this, that uh, and you consider that was probably 95 of the people uh going with me\non that night, um, did not live to see the next evening anymore, but still, on that Friday night, they\nwere saying their prayers and, and, and, and, um, um, praying to God, and, and uh, uh, giving him\ncredit uh, for I don't know what.\nWe're running out.\n(Sandy and Norbert talking off camera)",
        "Beep.",

        "Uh, when we boarded the uh boxcars, uh, we found ourselves, and we were very, not too happy\nabout it, found ourselves in the presence of other young people who uh, with whom we had grown\nup in the Jewish Youth Movement. So, we were not completely alone, uh, many of the people,\nother people just were isolated uh because, their husbands, uh, or, or, other members of the families\nhave been taken custody, into custody before, and uh, somehow uh, for reasons are, are difficult to\nexplain, we had a certain amount of relief because after all these weeks of waiting and these weeks\nof expectations, knowing that so many trains in transport have left Berlin already before. We\nthought now it's, now it's a, it's a new chapter, and we were looking, we were actually um, looking\nforward to that chapter with optimism and uh hoping or believing or envisioning that we would be\ntaken to some kind of a labor camp and so where we would uh work, but survive, and wait for the\nend of the war. And, uh, uh, I was as, with my, with my child and my wife, and uh, our child slept\na lot, and, and uh, uh when, was difficult to find out where we were going, but when we saw that\nwe are going toward the east, we, my wife and I talked about uh, the time when we had made this\ntrip in this direction voluntarily on our honeymoon a couple of years earlier, in the direction to\nSilesia, and also uh, uh, she and others wrote uh cards, postcards because uh, we knew it from,\nfrom, from things what, from uh, transports which had left Berlin before, that the people have\nthrown out these cards, and these cards had been picked up on the outside and had been mailed,\ninteresting enough. So, uh, uh, to repeat, we, we were in such rather good mood that we even\nstarted to sing. There was a song in the youth movement that's uh, it's in Hebrew, how nice it is\nwhen friends sit together, and, and are together in, in friendship. So, uh, therefore, I say, in general,\nit was uh, uh a mood of expectation and, and since it was Friday evening, uh, after darkness fell in,\nuh, one of the elderly ladies uh, uh remembered that, she had taken some candles along, and she\nwas lighting the candles and saying the prayers and uh, we found this somehow encouraging uh\nthough it's so uh absolutely irrational, almost irrational, that here uh, well nobody but nobody knew\nabout it that 95% of the people uh on that train would not live to see the next evening. Uh, but\nnevertheless, uh, uh, people prayed, praising God, uh, um, for what? So, uh, the train took\napproximately 24 hours from Berlin to the East. We still didn't know exactly where it was going.\nWe saw at one point in the morning the name of Katavitz, which uh, we knew was upper Silesia,\nand then, uh, uh, not far from Katavitz, the uh, uh, train came to a halt, and, and, the sign somehow\nsaid uh, \"-------------------.\". When the train came to a full stop, the doors, which had been sealed\nwhen we left Berlin were opened, and we found uh, outside, SS guards with rifles to the same\nextent that we had seen them in Berlin, but, an almost completely different type uh acting, almost",
        "like animals, yelling and shouting and, and, and hitting with sticks, and everybody had to jump out\nfrom these boxcars which was not easy after 24 hours--it was rather cold winter night, 1t was only\nin March, and um, then came the order, um, leave all the luggage where it is, forget about the\nluggage, and, but what was far more important and, and, and more gruesome that the order came\num, men to the, to, in one group, women with children to another group, and women without\nchildren a third group. And this is, that was the moment when, when um, I said, had to say\ngoodbye to my then wife, and, and child, and my wife who had always been very courageous, very\noptimistic, uh, looking forward uh to a better future, said, \"This is actually the moment I have\nfeared most, that they would separate us.\" And um, then when we, when we were had uh, uh -------\n-----, we had to form these groups, we had to pass by uh some SS officers. I, I was, later I learned\none of them was the infamous Dr. Mengele, uh, though it was already a couple of years into the\nwar, they looked very well-fed, almost elegant in their uniforms, and uh, this SS officer asked\ncertain questions, about your age, about your occupation, about your state of health, and then with\nhis hand, with his thumb, I would say, move to left or to the right, which means, uh, to the right\nwas life, to the left was death. Uh, children, and the women with children, then, uh we noticed\nwere loaded on special other trucks, none of us had any idea what, what's going to happen with\nthem. I saw the SS trucks leaving, my wife, uh, somehow I had uh, uh found a place at the end of\nthe truck, so we waved to each other, and that's the last I have ever seen of her. Uh, the women\nwithout children were also then uh, uh loaded on trucks by a group of women in SS uniform, for\nthe first time I had seen these women in a uniform with their uh revolvers hanging out and also\nacting with their sticks and, and, and, and acting like animals. Uh, not very charming...and, and\nwomen-like. And, but then we were, we were uh, uh, from that station, which was Osvientian, we,\nthe uh, we were taken along a tremendous uh area of factories, factory buildings, and, uh, -----------\n--- place we didn't know, and then we noticed that the trucks turned into a campsite surrounded by\nbarbed wire. And, uh, watchtowers. There was SS guards on the watchtowers with machine guns,\nand then I realized that uh, uh, we had reached a point, uh, where really a question of survival was\nof utter importance, and I said to my friends with whom I luckily had found, we were always trying\nto keep together, may God help us to keep us, to get out of here alive. And this is when we, when\nwe landed in, in that camp, which uh, uh, and still we didn't know where we were, and, we were\nreceived by, by uh, uh, some, some people in peculiar kind of uniforms. I uh, never seen these kind\nof uniforms, uh, before, although I later realized that was the same kind of uniform we had to wear\nlater. We were asked, we were ordered to give away all valuables. There were hardly any\nvaluables we had on us, like, besides watches and rings and so, orders was, we take, was taken in\nby the SS uh, uh, have the people there, and uh, then uh, uh, uh, we were directed to a, to\nsomeplace uh, uh, after being undressed, where we, we they gave us a shower, and they treated us\nwith a terrible kind of an ointment, probably for disinfection purposes, and uh, they cut completely",
        "our hair, uh, which means that we lost our kind of personality in this respect. We still didn't know\nwhere we were. And, standing there and waiting and some of these people got almost alarmed\nbecause there were rumors in Berlin about uh gassing and so forth, but we really didn't know any\nfacts. And uh, then one man who came up , he always, all, uh, he was obviously an old-timer,\nwhich he wa-which he was, and uh, he had been uh political opponent of Hitler, Jewish fellow who\nhad fought in Spain against the Franco regime, had been caught there, and then been transferred to\nthe, to the Nazis, and we ask him, \"Where are you, and what's going on here?\" And then he said,\n\"Well, be aware, you have just come in to the concentration, concentration camp of Auschwitz.\nUh, don't ask about your uh, wives and your children if you have come with them. They have to\ntake care of themselves. We are here already for years and years. Praise yourself for lucky that it\ntook you that long. Uh, we are building here a, this is a place which is called Buna, which is a\nbran--\nWe have to reload.\nbeep.\nWhen you finish describing registration, can you talk a little bit about how everything happened so\nfast and you couldn't believe--take in what it was. But then go on to your decision to resist in the\ndifferent ways that you did resist.\nYes, but, uh, uh, for me uh wanted to bring to--in, what, I think which is of importance, that\ninformation then, at this moment, uh when, when we still were not fully aware, where we were,\nwhat, what uh this man, who give us the information, ---------------- if you were in Auschwitz, but\nalso give the information that we have been brought there in order to be uh slave laborers in uh a\nbig um uh, ---------------- factory, built by-------------- of Germany, which is the equivalent to\nDuPont in, in, in America, where this factory is being constructed in order to produce artificial\nrubber of which Germany was short, and uh, that this must be our task, and um, if we could do the\nwork and we would have the chance to survive, and it would not uh, uh, we, the um that would be\nthe end of our road. Um, so, suddenly having come from, from the outside, having just been there,\nthough the shock, the culture shock was tremendous because after having uh, uh seen our hair\nshaven and so and having uh received our new uniform, uh, it was not uh, it was, I mean, your\nmind was almost completely blotted out to, to accept that, and to, to realize and then to adapt to it.\nUh, but, uh, it was hardly time for that. When we were, then after these procedures, released into\nthe, into the, the barracks, and found the people who had come to this place just a week earlier or a\nfew days earlier from Berlin and so, they told us, uh, or shared their experiences with us, said that",
        "the, the work was ha-harsh, that was, that the conditions were, were, were very, very difficult, that\ncertainly your food was scarce, but that uh, uh, since most of us, of us, had worked in so-called\nforced labor in Berlin before, we were somehow trained for, for heavy work. Um, and um, then\nalso, what was important too, too, what added to this culture shock was that uh, we lost our names,\nwe lost our identity, uh, we got a number, and this number was tattooed on our arms. Uh, mine was\n107984. And, uh, uh, uh, therefore, y-y-you had become a number. And the questions which came\nup certainly, would you turn into a number? And, uh, especially at the beginning, we still, we\npledged to ourselves we will endure it, we'll, we'll try our best to fight for our lives and for survival,\nif possible, because uh, uh, we wanted to outlive Hitler. And then uh, we had a first day of\nexperience when we were uh marched to the, to the tremendous area of, of factories of Codbuna??\nUh, it was a vast area of mud in these days, uh, it was March, uh rain had uh had come down\nmercilessly, and, and, and it was, it was, there were no real roads, and so to, to walk was very\ndifficult, took a lot of strength to do it. And then uh, we were put uh, especially in, for newcomers,\nthis was the destiny, you were destined to do the most difficult work, which was transport and, and\ndigging, and uh, this was not just done in a, 1n a leisurely way, but uh, mostly running around with\ncement and iron and things like that, and, and, and uh there are certain techniques how to handle,\nfor instance, a transport of iron in order to protect yourself, and , but with, with cement it was\nterribly difficult because especially when you, when the rain came down, and these bags, these\ncement bags opened, then, uh, cement uh, turned into cake and then covered your, your, your uh,\nclothing, and your body, and uh, uh, the other side of our so-called existence or life there was that\nthere was hardly any, any chance to keep clean because we were not allowed to possess anything,\nand, no, no, no, there was certainly no money, no uh, no uh, we had no toothbrushes, we had uh,\nuh, no knives, we had, the, the, the only thing they gave us was just a, a bowl, uh, to be used for, for\nthe, for the soup uh, uh, to which they treated us, but nothing else. And, uh, so uh it was, it was,\ndifficult, almost impossible to keep uh yourself clean, especially under these working conditions,\nand we were fully aware that, that uh, uh, without uh being able to keep clean, all kind of uh, uh\ndisasters could strike, diseases and so on. Uh, one of the things, for instance, we learned very fast\nwas that when the cement bags, which had 3 different layers of paper, uh opened you could use the\nmiddle layer to uh, for as, as, as a kind of toilet paper, or to uh, to uh protect your wounds and\nthings like that. So, in other words, you come back to a very, very primitive kind of existence to\nwhich not everybody was used. And uh, after, I would say, a couple of days, we had the first\nvictims, people had enough. Uh, uh in the morning, for instance, when we www-walked this\nstretch from the camp, which was outside of the factory, to the factory which was approximately a\nmile or more. Many of those, of the people said uh, uh, they had enough, and they ran out of the, of\nour group, and the SS guards uh accompanying us, then were shooting these people to death, uh,\nwhich they liked to do because, I understand, they were, got a certain compensation for that--so and",
        "so many days uh, of vacation, and the next a bonus or something like that. So, uh, in this way we\nlost people because of exhaustion and, and, and ,and uh people lost their, their will to survive there,\ntheir, their, their ----------, will to survive, and their lon de vivre?? as the French say. Um, a\nquestion certainly came to all of us, how long will we be able to hold out. And um, uh, uh, I was,\nuh, when I was pondering that question, uh, I was lucky then to be shifted to some other command\nuh, uh, uh, different work styles, and so it still was the, the conditions were terrible, the, the, the,\nthe, the, was hardly any protection uh against the rain especially, and against the cold weather. Uh,\nour clothing was very thin. We were freezing, and, and especially in the morning temperatures,\nand that's a reason why, why, very often when we came back from the camp, we had to carry the\nbodies of our people who had perished on the spot in, in the factory, and uh, I think of the 4 weeks\nof existence there, we had lost, we were approximately 220 men, if I'm not mistaken, out of a\nthousand, who had been uh, selected for work, uh or 240 if I'm not mistaken, almost 100 had\nalready uh, uh, uh, uh perished, and so the uh, th-this group became thinner and thinner.\nTell me about your friend, Fritz Schaeffer, who sort of resisted by deciding to die.\nWell, he was one of those victims. Uh, uh, they called it an a, an a, a terrible expression, which\nwas meant in the camp for reasons I did not quite, have never quite, the etymology of it has never\nbeen, become clear to me, were called musselmen. In other words, if people were so exhausted,\nand, because, you know, the food was, was so poor that you couldn't uh work up any energy or, or\nreplenish the energy. And, he was one of those, my friend, Fritz Schaeffer, who, uh, had suffered a\nlot. He was a wonderful man, uh, he was, he was a good mmmman, he loved music, he had a\nbeautiful tenor voice, and he has, had acted uh, uh as a hobby, as a cantor, in, in his community.\nAnd, one evening, he came to me, and, and he looked terrible, and uh, he said, \"I have enough. I\nam giving up.\" And I tried to convince him that uh, that this can't be since he was a man of uh trad-\na traditional Jew. I said, \"You have no right to do that. You know the teachings of the bible.\" Uh,\nhe said, \"Well, but uh, what we see here, what we suffer here, for this, there, there's no provision in\nthe bible, and I simply cannot go on.\" And uh, he was sick. Also, he had uh, probably an uh, uh,\nuh, it was called by Pneu, pneu-pneumonia. Uh, and, in the evening of uh, uh, he had to try to be\nadmitted to the so-called hospital, which was feared by all inmates because to go in uh to the\nhospital always entailed the danger to be selected and to be sent away for death. So he had gone\nthere, and the people had refused to admit him, so in the morning after dawn, he ran against the\nbarbed wire, and it was a rule there that if any, anybody ru-was running against the barbed wire,\nwhich was electrified, by the way, that the guards will, would, would shoot this per, this person to\ndeath, and I didn't know that it was him. We heard the shooting all, all, all night, sometimes the\nguards...",
        "We have to reload.\nSo how 1s it going, all right?\nBeep.\nWhy don't you just pick that up. I thought you said before that he didn't want to be kicked to death.\nThat's right. He said, when we had ----------, uh, when we had our little talk, and I tried to convince\nhim that uh, he should go on, and try to go on, last of least because of his religious conviction, and,\nand he said that uh, the bible doesn't provide for this situation, and, and, and also, he has enough\nbecause he doesn't want to be kicked to death. And, um, then, uh, the next mor--during the night,\nwe, we heard shooting. Now, shooting was nothing unusual. Very often the guards, in order to\nkeep themselves awake, were shooting. And, uh, we heard it in the morning, and I heard it in the\nmorning. We didn't know anything, uh, but then uh, when we were walking uh, uh to work, uh, a\nfellow um, a friend of mine who had been on the, on the same block with my friend, Fritz\nSchaeffer, said, \"You know, did you hear the uh shooting this morning?\" I said, \"Yes, what\nhappened??\" He said, \"Your friend, Fritz Shaeffer, he ran against the barbed wire in order to be\nshot, and because he, he, he said, he had enough.\" So, when I heard this, and reflecting on the\ndiscussion we had the night before, the thought came to my mind, my goodness how long will you\nbe able to hold out, and isn't it what he did, actually uh, more rational. Though it might be uh\nirrational reasons. Uh, so I was pondering that question, and uh, certainly it was, uh death was\ncheap in Auschwitz, so it could be attained immediately if you wanted to. But then, uh, as, as, as\nvery often happened in, in my situation and other situations, always something special came up.\nUh, on that evening when I came back, and was an awful day again, uh, they called the people back\nto the central labor office in, in the camp. When, uh I entered, uh, Auschwitz and I was asked what\nmy occupation was, I didn't tell them that I had been a student of law, and I didn't tell them that I\nhad worked as a social worker. I told them that I have been a welder, a welder, because, as a matter\nof fact, I had uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh taken up welding in connection with my own preparations to\nfind a way out of Germany. And I was advised it would be a good idea to have some kind of trade,\nand welding would be helpful. Uh, so I trained in --------welding, the Jewish community in Berl-\nBerlin had these uh vocational training uh, uh classes, and, so I said I'm a welder. Uh, the fellow\nregistered me uh completely believed it because of my glasses and so, and, and, and, but, you\nknow, there uh, uh, uh, uh, it didn't matter. And obviously uh, uh, uh, they were interested, they,\nuh became short of manpower already because it was after Stalingrad, and uh, so they called us to",
        "that labor office, and again the question was asked, uh, what is your profession? And, we were\ntold, uh, working in that factory, that they're in need of certain special qualifications, certain special\nskills. So, I registered again as a welder, and that raised my hopes that if I had a chance to work as\na welder, I might have a chance to survive. Uh, so that gave me a new lease on life, if you want to.\nTell me about the Polish welder who sabotaged the German work.",
        "Well, I was changing from one uh command to another. I got a la- I luckily got out of that terrible\nmurder command of transportation and, and digging because of uh, the registration as a welder, and\nI was attached to a, to a man, who uh, in our command, in our group, who uh, who um, uh was\nworking with Polish civilians. Uh, the man, I was, I was, uh, I became the assistant of a man, name\nwas Smuda, and he was a, a, a some kind what I called Foksdeutsch, which means, belo-belonging\nto that group which was not, their loyalties were, were was, was a little bit doubtful, but, here was\na, fundamentally a, a, a man, a Pole with a very strong national feelings for Poland. ----------. And\nhe was an excellent welder. So uh, we worked together. And, uh, after a certain while, uh, he\nhelped me, he brought in once in a while a piece of sausage or a piece of bread, which was , which\nwas very, very helpful, and one day I ask him, when we had established a certain relationship, and\nyou don't have to forget that everything was strictly controlled there. Uh, I must uh make this uh\nremark here that at the beginning when we came to uh to uh Auschwitz, our working commands\nwere accompanied by guards, approximately 10 or 20 people and one guard and these guards were\nnot the most pleasant people under the sky. In connection with Stalingrad, and the aftermath of\nStalingrad, uh, more of these SS men were sent to the front, to the, to the, to the in order to the\nRussian front, and, the Germans and the SS build a guard, a chain around the factory so that we\nwere not watched completely by the SS guards in our, our detailed work. So therefore it was easier\nto come back to uh, to work, was smoother to communicate with him, and uh, one day I, I, I ask\nhim, uh, if he would be willing to send a letter for me to the neighbor uh, where I had lived in\nBerlin. She was a wonderful human being, uh, uh, uh opposed to Nazism, uh working in a labor\ndept in Berlin, always being very helpful whe-when we had not the right, for instance, to buy\nvegetables or, or fruits and so on, and under the protection of the blackout, very often, there was a\nknock at the door, and all of the sudden we found a, a, a little bag with, with some of these of these\nso called goodies. So, uh, and I, when I, before we left, we also had left her with some pa-part of\nour belongings, and some money, so I wrote to her uh through Smuda, and Smuda mailed that letter\nto her, and she had the courage, and, though she could not realize what it was, she was not, she was\nnot aware of Auschwitz or so, but, she reacted, and sent Smuda uh bread and money, which was\nvery important for me. I couldn't use the money because it was, we were not allowed when we had\nno use for money, but the bread was, was, was manna. And, uh, so that was Smuda did. The other",
        "thing what Smuda, as I said, since he was such an excellent welder, he had developed a technique\nsince he didn't want to, to uh help the Germans to win the war, to uh, develop a certain technique of\num, um, um sabotage. Uh, there is a certain way, when you weld, and we had this spe-our\nspecialty in welding was pipe welding, that was just the pipes under, under high pressure, for pipes\nunder high pressure, that by adjusting your, the burn off, the, off the welding tool, uh, you, you,\nyou, you um uh, uh put certain defects into the, into this uh, uh connecting uh welding uh piece,\nand that's what he did, and I must say, I loved to see that, and I loved to learn it, and I did it. Uh,\nbecause I also was not interested to uh to uh to uh to have that on my conscience later to say that I\nhelped the Germans to win the war. So, uh, uh, uh that's what we did. So, uh, uh, that was my\nexperience with Smuda, which was a very pleasant one. Uh, later I was shifted to another uh, uh\ncommando. I lost sight of him, I don't know what happened to him. I don't know uh if he was able\nto survive the war or not, uh, but uh he was a decent fellow, and I, I, I, I must, I'd like to, to pay\nrecognition to that.\nWhat is a Kapo? Just describe for me as though I don't know, what is a Kapo?\nThe etymology that led us to the origin of that never became quite clear to me. It comes, I\nunderstand, from the imperative, and the Kapo was the man who was in charge. He was the, he\nwas an inmate himself, and es-especial when you have a bigger command, like I say, of 50, 60\npeople, there were the, there was a supervisor what they called in German, the forarbeiter, and the\nfellow who was in command of this labor detatchment, and they called him Kapo. Uh, there were\nmor-they were mainly or mostly uh, an elderly hef, not an elderly, a, a haftling, who had spent uh\nquite some time in, in, in the camps already, and he had certain privileges as far as food and so is\nconcerned, but, and there were uh, a Kapo is a sensitive issue because uh, certain people uh, we had\ndifficulties especially when we came to, to Auschwitz, where these functions were mainly an ends\nof Poles, some of them were rather rabid antisemites, antisemites, and um, very, many of them\nabused the power they had, uh,\nWe have to reload.\n(Long tone)\nUnder the uh, headline uh, uh, uh spiritual resistance.\nYeah, and I don't know if it makes sense to you but...",
        "Beep.",
        "One of the reactions, certainly, of people as soon as you had uh spent at least 4 weeks or 6 weeks\nand you were still alive, was the question, how can you build up your, your, only physical\nresistance, but spiritual resistance, because we are fully aware of the fact that um, we would be\nprisoners as long as Germany uh, uh, uh, the Nazi Regime was in power, and uh, uh, obviously, uh,\nthe military operations were not fast enough uh for us uh in order to be liberated. Uh, one uh, uh\nspecific thing was that people especially, who were traditional Jews, uh, uh, uh, uh tried to build up\ntheir uh, uh spiritual resistance in this way even uh, uh under the danger of being uh, uh, uh\ndetected and uh being uh, uh punished for that, kept up for instance, trad-certain traditions. In my\nblock, uh, there was a man, uh, who had been taken from Vienna with a so-called Polish accent.\nHe was a, was a scholar. Uh, and um, um a man who had spent a couple of years before in\nBuchenwald, then had been transferred to uh, to uh Auschwitz, and, he organized uh, uh services in\nsuch a way that first of all, you had to be very, very careful not to be detected what, what you was,\ndid was, that he assembled uh in a traditional way uh Jews are praying in the morning but in the\nevening, and especially in the morning, just assembled ten men which we called a minion, uh, uh,\nassembled them for morning prayers. Certainly there were no books because we didn't have any\npapers or any books, and so, so, all these prayers were, were, were spoken by heart, and I knew\nthem very well, but just to participate in these, in these kinds of assemblies was very helpful, it\nwas, it was nourishing us, it was, 1t gave us some kind of lift up to the same extent as for instance\neven on the day of uh, of Yom Kippur which was the holiest day, in spite of everything, we\nassembled in, in the block of a friend, and their prayers were said, and whether the people were\northodox or reformed or conservative, it, it gave them something, I mean it was, was so\ncontradictory that here where we though we were forlorn, and God had forsaken us, that we were\npraying to that same God, and wrestling with our, with our uh, uh conscience, uh, uh, uh wrestling\nwith the question, \"Where is God?\" Uh, we had uh, uh in our group also a man, an elderly man,\nwhom I had befriended; he had come from Poland in his younger years after service in the Austrian\narmy, had made his way to Berlin, he was a shoemaker, and uh, he had built a nice family in Berlin,\nchildren, and he was stretching out his life, his, his existence, but then he was taken in September,\n1939 with a so-called Polish accent, and had been in a couple of the concentration camps--\nSachsenhausen then Dachau and Buchenwald, and when I met him, he, I met him in Auschwitz. A\nwonderful elderly man, simple, very pious, in spite of what everything had been done to him, he\nused to believe in his God. And one day, uh, it was a terrible day, the, the rain was beating down,\nwe were standing on the, on the --------road called, on the big square, and they were counting us.\nAnd the, these SS uh gangsters were not very good in counting, uh, you know, the order had to be\nthere, and if something was wrong it had to be uh, they had to count and recount time and again",
        "and again and again, and we were standing there, and uh, a wind was blowing mercilessly from the\nBeskit?? Mountains, and we were standing there in our, in our uh, uh thin clothing, uh clothing,\nand, and, and people collapsed, and uh, but, these are the days and the moments when, when, when\nminutes become hours and hours uh became, become weeks. And all of a sudden I saw that friend\nof mine who was standing there not far from me praying, and I was looking at him, and I ask him,\n\"Yakov, what are you doing, I mean you have said probably your morning prayers, and it's too\nearly for the evening prayers, uh what are you doing?\" He said, \"No, I, that's right, I, I say a\nspecial prayer to God.\" I said, \"What are you doing?\" He said, \"I am, uh, prai-praising God.\" I\nsaid, \"Are you out of your mind? Praising God here in this situation where we are insulated, where\nwe are isolated, left alone, uh, uh, uh, in, in, in this, in this, uh hell, and you are praying to God, and\nyou are thanking him?\" He said, \"Yes, I am thanking him.\" Said, and I was very irritated, and I\nsaid, \" What are you thinking? What are you God thanking for?\" He said, \"I'm thanking God for\nthe fact that he didn't make me like the murderers around us.\"",
        "And now, can we talk about the old-timers who tried to escape.",
        "Yeah, that was in 4, 1944,uh, we knew already because we had, we had uh, especially I had uh\nbuilt up a contact with a prisoner, with a British prisoner of war who had been brought to\nAuschwitz against the rules and regulations of the Geneva Convention. The uh British soldiers and\nI, I was able to befriend them, and luckily I was able to communicate in English with them, my\nschool English was good enough, and they had uh, uh, uh radio set even in their camp, which was\nnot far from our camp, by the way, which was not under the SS, but under the German army. And,\nwhen I became close uh with them, they uh brought me every morning news they had heard the\nnight before on BBC. So we more or less knew uh what was going on, uh, uh, how the Ger, how\nthe, uh especially that the Allied had landed at Normandy and, when the Russians came, became,\ngot closer and closer with, with their armies, and uh, so it's certainly we go excited because we\nknew that this is the moment we were waiting for because this means either life or death. And uh,\nin that uh, uh, uh fall of 1944, 3 of our, of our, uh old timers, uh, who had spent years and years in\ncamp, they had decided that uh, they tried to escape because they were not, they were not sure if\nuh, the uh, 1f we would live to see the day of liberation, if the SS would not dynamite all these\ncamps and put us to death like, like the others, who have gone before us. So, they had a certain\nplan to escape, and they, unfortunately, were caught. And uh, the penalty for this uh in the\nconcentration camps was death. And, uh, the Germans had a very, the gruesome, they made out of\nthis a gruesome spectacle of public hanging, and one evening when we came back from work, we\nsaw the gallows set up there for all 3 of them. Uh, we knew already that this was somehow\npending because we knew that they had been discovered, and that uh, the uh the uh, obviously the",
        "uh, uh, uh correspondence between Berlin and Auschwitz went back and forth, what to do with\nthem, but certainly the, the sentence was death. So, when we came in and uh, we, we, we heard\nthat there was, that they would be destined to die. And, uh, it was a, a terrible day, it was uh, in fall,\nit was, it was uh, uh, uh, uh all the 10000 of us who were in that camp were ordered to come out\nand to watch that gruesome spectacle. And, uh, then the Germans uh kept a certain formality,\nreading uh the sentence, a death sentence, uh not in the name of any court, but just in the name of\nHimmler, the, the head of the SS. And, uh, uh, just before the henchman did hi-is work, uh, one of\nthem, doesn't matter who it did, cried out in a voice that, and we were as I say standing there uh\nwith clenched uh fists and our uh, uh and, and uh talking about where's God uh at this moment, and\n--------------, by the way, has written about it because he was also there. And said, just in that\nmoment of when the, when the, when the sentence was read, and before the henchman could do his\nwork, one of them cried out in a voice which could be heard over the whole square by all the 10000\nassembled there, and they did it in German so that the henchman should understand, that the said,\n\"_----------------,\"\" which means in English \"You comrades, keep your heads, your heads high\nbecause we will be the last.\" And then in a few minutes later they were no more.\nWe're getting room tone Brett. Stay still.\nEnd room tone.\nBeep.\nUm (clears throat) I would say some kind of a watershed for the history of Jews in Germany, were\nthe events of November 9, 1938. Uh, this uh, called sometimes Kristallnacht, I don't use this\nexpression because it's a label which came out from Gobbel's uh propaganda ministry. The day\nthere after when they somehow felt ashamed about uh all these heaps of broken glass which\ncovered the streets of Berlin. Uh, in connection with these events, with the burning of the\nsynagogues, the looting of the stores, the smashing of the windows, uh also men were taken uh, en\nmasse uh, to uh German concentration camps, then within Germany. Buchenwald and Dachau and\nSachsenhausen Rhinebrook??? near Berlin. And after a couple of days, uh, uh, some of them were\nreleased, especially those who had been veterans of WWI, and but then they came out. They, they\nlooked terrible because uh they're clothing had been all the disinfectant, had been treated in a way\nthey, they were, they appeared in the streets, looked like appearing in rocks. And, in connection\nthere with the Jewish community in Berlin, uh, which also was badly damaged because uh, uh, uh\nsome of them, many of the people had been taken away, and uh, for days uh the uh administrative\nbuildings had been closed. They opened their rescue operation for those people who had re- had",
        "come out, especially in Berlin, for, from the concentration camp of ------. And, uh, people, uh, who\nuh, came uh out and were directed to the Jewish community where they got their first good meal,\nwhere they could uh, uh wash up again, and that was one of my functions, I volunteered for that,\nbecause members of the Jewish Youth Movements volunteered for all these things. Uh, I tried to\nconnect the people by telephone with their families in different parts of Germany where they had\nbeen traken from, in the middle of the night or so uh, in connection with the events of November\n9th. And when we were working there, uh, uh one of my friends was the uh, the head of that relief\nuh, support, and it was my youth leader for many, many years, he said, \"Listen, I just got a call\nfrom uh, name is --------. They just returned head of the executive head of the uh, uh, uh central\nrepresentation of Jewish in Germany. Uh, there's a job to be done. I understand that the British are\nwilling to take uh children and uh, uh to England, and uh, uh, you are supposed to, to do\nsomething, see uh, uh this uh Dr. Hirsch. Next morning I found myself in his office. As I indicated\nhe had just returned also from the concentration camp, but had returned immediately to work again\nas the executive director of the organization. And he told me that the House of Commons in\nEngland, the debate of the situation of Jews in Germany and Austria, had been, uh, there was a\ndebate in the House of Commons, and as a result there of, they have decided uh to give shelter to\napproximately 10,000 unaccompanied children from the age of 13 to 17 for the time being so the\nchildren could relax and could, could recover, and were not exposed to the persecution in, in, in, in\nNazi Germany and Austria. And, uh, that uh, operations have to be set up, and uh, he wanted to\nhelp me because there was the uh, the uh, the uh, the uh, organization had wonderful social\nworkers, but these uh, uh, uh, uh, especially ladies, had hardly any experience in technical work,\nand how to run the operations and so, I was not trained in that but uh I had a certain, a certain, uh,\nuh, uh, capability for organizational things, which I also picked up during my existence in the\nyouth movement, and I uh, uh accepted the offer to serve there. He promised me I was in the\nmiddle also of my own preparations with my then wife uh, uh to, to leave Germany uh, if possible.\nAnd, and so I got a commitment from the gentleman Hirsch?? that as soon as the work would be\ndone, he will see, the organization would see to it, that I would find also my, my way, into, to\nsafety uh outside of Germany. So I took over the uh technical, the responsibility for all technical\narrangements to be made in order to bring the children out of Germany. The project was 10000\nchildren. That's it. Now, that was not easy because we have no experience in this field. The\nchildren were selected by, by the welfare organizations in the different cities of Germany, and then\nuh, don't like to go into the procedures--uh, in a simple way they got their permits, what they hand\nout at the English consulates in, in Germany, uh, but we had to see to it that they were transported\nout of Germany, so, uh, and that was not an easy job because there was no, no, no, no, uh, uh, uh,\nuh fax uh, there were no fax machines, and there, there was uh uh no dialing system for telephones,\nand so, so this uh and uh, uh, uh ----------------, under which supervision all this certainly had to be",
        "done, was very meticulous, they wanted the exact records, uh to be checked, so all this preparatory\nwork required a lot of preparations and labor. We even were allowed to uh, uh send escorts from\nuh Germany with the children to England, and these had to be selected, and this was not easy\nbecause the Istapor??? gave permission for these escorts only under the provision that they would\nreturn to Germany from England in order to continue the work. Uh, uh, so what I had to do was to\nuh to uh to not only prepare the records, but also to see to it that on a certain day on a certain\nmorning, all these children were, were collected in Berlin, for instance, where we had special\nrailway wagons, which would take them on the way of via Berlin, Hanover, to Hopfen, Holland or\nFlushing, and to Herigen, England, where the committee in England (clears throat) excuse me, was\nwaiting for them to be then distributed (clears throat) at Liverport Street Station in London to foster\nparents or to homes or whatever it was. And uh, so, it had to be organized in such a way that they\nall had to come at a certain day at a certain time in, in order to be ready and then, because the trains\nleft approximately I think at 9 or 10 o clock in the morning, that's not important, but people had to\ncome there to a certain, so the arrangements had to be made with the railway system, and\narrangements had to made, to be made with the police also, so uh, uh, uh, and, we also had taken\nover the responsibility so that the police to keep uh order, so that the police should not interfere\nbecause certainly that was a tense situation because the parents had brought their children in order\nto uh, uh hand them over into our custody to, to transport them to England. So, uh, uh, uh, I saw all\nthe transports which left Berlin I saw off because it was my function to see to it that these things\nwere working properly. So uh, on a typical day we asked the parents to come with the children, not\nonly from Berlin, from, let us say those who were to come from East Prussia or from Bressler also,\nhad to travel the night before, but in the morning they all were there. And, that was a very special\natmosphere in the air of expectation to a certain extent, there was laughing and there were tears,\nand there was concern, and at last, last uh, uh, uh, advice by the mothers what to do and what not to\ndo, and then uh, at a certain time when the, the time of departure uh came closer, and we had, as I\nsaid, reserved wagons which, which had to be filled with these children, and the, the police had\ninsisted that the parents do not accompany, accompany, uh the uh, the uh children to the railways\nbecause there were certain difficulties, uh, they insisted that the goodbye had to be done uh, not in,\nin, in, in uh, in public. So, uh, uh, uh and, the time of departures came closer, then I, I was\nascending a chair there, that was my -------------, and I asked the uh parents uh then that, I\naddressed the parents, and told them that the day of departure has come, and they should say\ngoodbye because we're on a strict uh order by the police uh to take, just to take the children up to\nthe rail, uh railways, and they have to remain there, and uuuuuh, that I ask for their cooperation,\ntheir understanding, because only that uh, that their behavior would guarantee the continuity of our\noperations. So, um, um, then the parents said goodbye, and again there was laughing and crying\nand a last hug, and, but uh, later when I asked very often to myself the question, how did I have the",
        "courage to say that to the parents, I only can answer that at this time we didn't know and we\ncouldn't even foresee, we couldn't surmise for a moment that for many or most it would be the last\ngoodbye, that most of those children would never see their parents again, and that a year and a half\nlater, from that same, same station or the same railways, the trains which now were rolling with the\nchildren towards the West...\nWe have to stop because we just ran out. We have to do that part again.\nbeep.\nSo let's back up to where you were talking about the goodbyes, and that no one could foresee this.\nYes, I said then that as the time of departure came closer, when I was ascending a chair, telling the\nparents that now the time for goodbye has come, that we ask for their cooperation because we are\nunder strict order by the police (clears throat) not to let the chil--the uh parents uh come to the uh,\nto the uh, uh, uh railroad, the railways, uh because they didn't want to uh have uh this see the public\nbecause they wanted to avoid any scenes in public. And, I asked them for their cooperation\nbecause uh the continuity of our work depended on their behavior. So there were tears, and there\nwas laughter, and there was a last, there were hugging and kissing, but uh, this was??? a tense\nsituation, no doubt, but uh, the children oh, most of the children were in a some kind of a mood of\nexpectation, and uh, the parents tried to uh, to control their emotions, to, to show they are, they are\ncourageous, uh, uh, in order to make it, not have, to make it more difficult for the children. And,\num, very often after that I have asked myself the question where did I take the courage from to tell\nthese uh people to say uh goodbye, uh, and the answer to that is just that uh none of us, nobody of\nus, could foresee even at this moment that for most of the children and most of the parents, 1t would\nbe the last goodbye. That a year and a half later or so, from over the same railways where the train\nuh left uh to take the children to a new country and to freedom and liberty, the trains would roll\ntowards the East and take them, the parents, uh to, to the, human slaughterhouses in Auschwitz and\nother places. Uh, we had of a certain, uh, uh, attempts uh were made uh, uh also -------- received\nthe permission, our own escorts could accompany the, the children because the moment when the\nchildren said goodbye, the escorts took over, they were carefully selected, mainly teachers, we had\nsome, some uh young doctors and so uh children doctors and so, who were not busy because they\nhad lost their, their, their, their permits, their license, um, to go with these children, and uh, I myself\ndid it because last not least I wanted to see how it's working. We found, for instance, out that at\none place where the train --------------- in the direction to England from Berlin, past the border uh\nline of Bendheim, the SS uh, acting as customs officials, acted like vandals, uh, not touching the",
        "children, but, but tearing all the luggage apart and looking for valuables and so on, which uh\nfrightened certainly the children tremendously but there's nothing, nothing we could do. But the\nmoment we came to Holland, for instance, uh, we were received by wonderful human beings who\nuh, uh were the committee, and they treated the chil- the children with chocolate and sweets and\ncake and, and all kinds of goodies, and uh, then uh, uh, the trains rolled uh towards the uh these\nplaces from which the ferry went to England, uh that was to Herrich in England. Uh, as I said, I\nwent a couple of times in order to see what can be done to improve the uh technicalities, and then,\nthen if necessary to change the procedure. There are 2 stories I'd like to tell in connection there\nwith, I've never forgotten. Uh, one was when we uh ca-uh uh in, after a couple of months of these\ntransports, a couple of these transports had left, we were twice by the uh chamber of commerce I\nthink, it was in England. Then too many goods were taken into England, uh, uh, uh, uh considered\nmerchandise to be sold in England, uh, and that uh, the uh Chamber of Commerce did not like that.\nSure enough, parents had given their, their children all kind of valuables, uh, not, not, not jewels or\nso, but things they, they, they, they like them to take with them ph-photo cameras and so, which\ncous, could be uh taken along, money certainly was not allowed, the minimum, or the maximum of\nmoney you would take out at this time were 10 marks, which was nothing, hardly a pound or half a\npound. So, uh, the people came with valuable music instruments and things like that. And in one\noccasion when I was uh the uh, the uh, in charge of this transport, we landed in Herrich, and uh, the\ncustoms, uh, inspected, they were very generous, uh, but certainly they did their job, and uh, then I\nheard my name called, and I came to the cusom official, and uh, uh, he said, \"Sir, we have a\nproblem here.\" I said, \"What is the problem?\" and he said, \"Well, here's a young man, and he has\na very very valuable violin.\" Well 1t was not certainly a Stradivarius or a Vonari or Tomatus????\nbut it was obviously an Italian violin, and I said, \"Well, I cannot understand, you have to kindly\nunderstand????? uh the uh the, the boy loves music, and, and the parents gave him, gave him a, a\nviolin, and he likes to practice music. I didn't know that the boy was able to play it. So, uh, the\ncustoms official still was very doubtful, and I went there to him and said, \"Well, uh, uh, uh, uh, let\nme help you and convince you that the boy loves music, and let him play if you may, if I may.\" He\nsaid, \"It's all night. Why not?\" And as I say, I was sweating, uh, uh, cold sweat because I wasn't\nsure. So, I asked the boy then in German, \"Are you able to play?\" He said, \"Sure.\" And then he\nstarted to play, and I didn't realize in my excitement what he was going uh, uh playing, but all of\nthe sudden I saw that the custom official started uh acting, and that the people, the British people\naround him became silent, and there was complete silence in that area, and then I realized that the\nboy had started to play \"God Save the King.\" And, when I got aware of that, then I thought it was a\nlittle bit embarrassing, I wanted to stop him, but that boy was eager, he wanted, he played all 3\nstanzas of the National Hymn, and the people, and the activities there in Herrich, in the customs uh\narea stopped, and when he was finished, and uh, uh, uh operations started again, I asked the",
        "customs, said, \"Are you now convinced that the boy loves music?\" He said, \"Yes, sir. Completely.\nGo ahead.\" And that's uh the one story I, I, I, I have still very much in my memory. The other 1s\nuh, uh shows the, the, the uh kind of human reaction which I appreciated tremendously, I love to, to\ntell 1t again and again. We were under the rules not to admit uh, uh to take children on a transport\nover the age of 17. In other words, if they have completed the age of 18, they couldn't go on the\ntransport. So, uh, on one of these transports when I was in charge of it, and during the night when\nwe made the ferry from uh, uh Flushing to Herrich, we worked in order to bring all these papers\ninto shape, the permit cards in alphabetical order and so, so that the children shouldn't wait too long\nbecause uh it was a long uh train ride, and there was a, was a night in which, uh, they wouldn't\nsleep too long, and so, so we were working, in the lounge of the, of the ship??, and uh, all of the\nsudden one of my friends said, uh, came to me and said, \"Norbert, I think we have a problem here.\"\nI said, \"What is the problem?\" He said, \"Here the uhhh, permit, the landing permit said that this\nfellow is over 18 years old.\" I looked at it and I couldn't believe my eyes because it had passed the\ninspection of all of us. So, we went into a huddle and, and, we, we asked the boy to come down,\nand said there must be a mistake. So, the boy had already gone to sleep, and when they brought\nhim down, I almost fainted because I saw that he came down, uh, with his hair shaven, which\nindicated to me that he had been taken in November uh to a concentration camp, had been released\nafter a certain time and probably was under the order of the Gestapo to leave, to leave Germany, or\nwould be taken again into the camp. And we went to them after having seen that uh, we went into\na huddle with the uh, with our, with our escorts, deliberating what can we do to save the situation.\nAnd there were two opinions: one said, uh, that uh, we should reveal it and throw ourselves at the\nmercy of the civil servants, and the other, and I was uh one of those, said well, we'll simply do\nsomething else, we'll play a trick. We'll say that there was a mistake of the German police, and,\nand, and uh that they had made a mistake, and ---------, but that means that the boy had to be\nconvinced that he really was one year younger. So we explained it that that boy was standing in\nfront of us, he knew that something was wrong, and he was just shaking like a shaky bone, and I\nwas, I felt terribly sorry. So he was, and he was a...smart fellow. He was given to understand that\nwhen he will be asked how old he is, that he should then say that he was born year earlier, one year\nbefore, and uh, we even uh, arranged that that during the night somebody should wake him up to ---\n-----, to ask him, \"When were you born?\" and then he should answer. So, we landed the next\nmorning in Herrich, and ----------, suddenly, all of the sudden immigration said, \"Mr. Wollheim,\"\nsaid, the official said, uh, \"Sir, uh, there must be a terrible mistake.\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.",
        "Okay. Let's back up just a little bit.\nWell, um, the decision has been made to say it was a mistake, and to try to smuggle him in. So, the\nnext morning, we didn't sleep too much, we landed in Herrich, and uh, sure enough, soon, there\nwas a, was a, was a, I heard a voice saying, \"Mr. Wollheim, the immigration officer would like to\nsee you.\" So, uh, and I knew what was coming. So, uh, uh, he showed me this permit, and said uh,\nuh, \"Listen Sir, I cannot admit this uh boy. Uh, this young man, because uh, under the rules and\nregulations uh, uh he is not entitled to it.\". And he pointed out to the date. And I said, \"Uh, sir, this\nmust have been a mistake. Uhhh, because uh we checked carefully, and that cannot be. And, uh,\nkindly asked the boy himself, so, this boy came and he was certainly all and shaking in his boots,\nand he was white like uh, newly culped wool??, white on his face and sh-really shivering, and that\nimmigration officer looked at him, and I could see that something was working within him, and he\nsaid, he asked me, \"You really mean that the German police, which was famous for accuracy and\nreliability is making mistakes?\" And I told him, \"Yes, sir, because don't forget we're already so and\nso many years after the Nazi regime, and the quality of those people they are now serving 1s not the\nsame anymore.\" He said, \"Uh-huh.\" Then he looked again at us, and he asked me, \"Do you take it\non your responsibility to say that this is a mistake, and that the boy was born one year earlier, and\nwithout waiting, I said, \"Yes sir, I do.\" And there was a long time of silence. And I realized that he\nknew I was lying, and I knew that he knew that I was lying. And he looked at the boy again, and\nhe looked at the card, and after certain moments, which was a moment of life and death for that\nboy, he took out the stamp, 'Admitted to United Kingdom,' and he was admitted under false\npretenses, uh, which means, uh, the man knew, the civil servant, uh that uh, uh, in this situation, uh,\na human gesture would be of tremendous importance, and if I say that, because probably this man\nis not around anymore, but he has earned his place in heaven.\nHow many children altogether did you rescue, and, how did that make you feel?\nWell, um, I think the war broke out, which, uh by the way, I went, I went also to, to Sweden a\ncouple of times because Sweden took a s-a couple of small groups into their country, uh, but, we\nwere able to bring out just of Germany, and we were not allowed to work with the people in\nAustria or in, in Czechoslovakia, but we uh, war broke out, I think when we had reached\napproximately the, the, the number of 7000. Um, the only thing I can say that uh, uh, certainly I,\nwhen I came to London, and my friends there are, uh, and I told them that I'm going back to uh to\nuh to Germany, uh, and, and I had a privilege uh, to fly back, which at this time was a sensation.\nFlying was not a daily uh, a daily affair, uh, and they said, \"Are you out of your mind?\" Uh, I said,",
        "\"Well, I can't help it because uh, we are under the obligation, and I've given my word to serve as\nlong as I can, and, and also uh, uh, it was so I had my parents still living in in uh, in in uh, uh\nGermany. I had a sister for which I felt responsible, and certainly my wife and my child, and so\nthat I didn't have a right to desert them and to stay in England, uh, and also it would have meant\ncertainly that the operation would be, might come to an end, and would be the uh, would be\ndamage, so uh, as I say, I'm, I'm, I'm glad that I did it. I'm very proud of it. I paid a p-a certain\nprice for it, but nobody could foresee because the man, who, when he asked me to help him, and\npromised me, made a commitment to him--------------to get out of Germany. Uh, uh, uh, a year or a\nyear and a half later, after the war broke out, he was taken uh, uh to the concentration camp of\nMauthausen, and murdered in cold blood there.",
        "Now let's go to before 1938 and 1939. How did life change, both gradually and suddenly?",
        "Well, uh, you have to go back a little bit uh further because, because uh, nobody can forget that, uh,\nthere was a life in Germany and a Jewish life before Hitler, and it was a very active life, especially\nin the community where I grew up. We had a thriving community, an active community, and I\nparticipated as a young man, as a member of the Jewish Youth Movement. Um, we uh, Berlin also,\nand I enjoyed it especially as a student, uh, I became a student of law in 1931. Uh, Berlin was uh,\nuh a center of cultural activity. In the field of music, field of literature, field of theater, and uh, we\nfully uh participated in that, and really enjoyed it to the best of our ability. And even when we are\nstudents that didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't have the uh, the means to attend all the operas, uh because\nit was too expensive for us, and we just uh, went there, and we could do that, uh played, played uh,\nuh, uh people on the stage. Uh, we were not paid for that, but we had opportunity to, to listen and\nto participate. So, 1t was very active. After 1933, and that\u2019 interesting, um, uh, things uh, uh, went\nin waves. The first enemies Hitler took care of were not the Jews; were the unions, were the\npolitical parties like the uh social democratic, democratic, and the communist parties. For them,\nuh, he established the concentration camps. Certainly there was on April 1, 1933, we had the\nevents of so-called boycotts, which uh, uh gave us for the first time an inkling what might come\nout, but we though, uh, and I was not alone in this respect, that this is just a transitory thing. That\nuh, Hitler cannot prevail, that for economical reasons he will not be able to uh, to remain the\nChancellor of Germany. That uh, the, the countries like England and France (America at this time\nuh didn't play a role in Europe) would not let him, let him uh threaten them. And that uh, therefore,\nwe just had to have to the cou-not the courage, we had the, the uh, uh stamina to hold out. Uh,\nthen uh, things uh, uh, uh, also uh many people thought differently, then tried to get out, to get out\nwas not easy, the world was not open. America had caught us, people who'd try to get into\nPalestine needed at least 10,000 pounds. And, uh, uh, uh people would try to get into South",
        "America and so, had terrible difficulties, so, 1-immigration was not, not a ------, an easy thing.\nWhen we had the Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936, things almost looked normal, though, before\nwe had the Nuremberg Laws, and we thought, after that, we could somehow settle on the fact that,\nall right we would not be, not be citizens like, like the others, but, who wanted to be a citizen? The,\nthe, the, the Democratic regime of the Weimar Republic, which had come to an end, uh, uh, uh, uh,\ndidn't allow people under, had come to an end and, people under Hitler anyhow did not participate\nactively in any kind of political life. Uh, uh, it was a totalitarian, uh, country, and we were not\ninterested. We uh, we built, on the other hand, a tremendously active Jewish life. There were, uh,\nuh, institutions of Jewish learning uh, were created. A, a tremendous amount of uh books of Jewish\ncontent were printed. We had our own Jewish cultural activities. Uh, people who had, I wouldn't\nsay lost the faith, but, who had moved away somehow, all of the sudden came back. Uh, the\nJewish sports organizations became very active. In other words, it was a kind of life uh, almost uh,\nuh, an automono--an autonomous uh, uh, uh life within the parameter of our abilities. Um, which\nuh, was deceiving certainly, but, nobody certainly at this time could foresee what will, what at\nleast, uh, I don't have, have met anybody who, who, who, uh, who, who would say that, who would\nsay that he could exactly foresee Auschwitz or, or Treblinka or Majdanek. And, uh, then when\nHitler uh had attained more power in Europe, partly due to the weakness of the allies, uh, and that\nafter, especially after he stretched his muscles, and, and, and that, and that first Austria, and then,\nthen Czechoslovakia, then things uh, uh became more serious, and, and it became clear that the uh,\nthe uh, work outside...\n(Sandy says something)\nOh, I'm sorry.\nbeep.\nUh, I would say that we conducted in German some kind of restricted, almost normal life.\nRestricted uh because we didn't uh, uh, we were not politically active, but there was only one party,\nand there was only one totalitarian regime, so who cared. But we were left to ourselves, somehow.\nWith, with, with certain control and all this, but uh, uh, many things were produced which were,\nwhich, which were, really an achievement, especially in the field of education. Uh, the\norganizations, for instance, training people for immigration to Israel, were active, and trained the --\n----------- and the young people, the pioneers who want to go out and so. Uh, there were 2 different\nopinions in, in Germany at this time still prevailing. One would believe that it's just a matter of\ntime, and the regime might collapse, and the others who said, \"No, uh we want to get out because",
        "uh, uh, we don't see any future, especially for our children,\" and that was especially certainly true\nfor the professionals who had lost their license like lawyers and doctors and so on. An indication\nthat the uh thumbs?? were tightened more and more--we got in 1938, I would say, which certainly\nhad something to do with the political success of Hitler on the world scene, also with the fact that\nprobably the radical elements within the Nazi party thought the time has come to uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,\nuh, uh realize their param--uh, uh, uh, uh, uh concerning the Jews. And, uh, in 38, you had a\ndevelopment where uh, uh business which was still open, retail business, and, to a certain extent,\neven dept stores, then changed hands, and uh, Jews uh left the boards of big corporations, and uh, it\nstarted uh and, and then uh I would say the total change came with the events of November 10, uh,\nuh which uh received a misnomer was Crystal Night. It is actually the uh, I call it a night of\nshame, and ------------, it's interesting that in Germany, this expression Crystal Night is not being\nused. Uhhhhh, I must say, I'm grateful for that. Uh, but then when, when we saw uh what we\ncouldn't believe, that Germany which after all was considered for, for, for all of us, who were\neducated at German high schools, German universities, that Germany was once considered a center\nof civilization, uh, had handed over the uh power of, of, of uh government to thugs and to, to\npeople who, who replaced uh the, applied uhh, the political means of violence. And uh, uh, this uh,\nand it was right what the then leader of the uh, uh German Jewish community, Rabbi Beg??, who\nwas my teacher and spiritual mentor said, I think, at this time, that the historical hour of German\nJewry, which had lasted almost 2000 years, had come to an end. And, uh, then uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,\nstarted the, the running, uh trying to find a, a place somewhere outside. I, myself, uh, in connection\ntherewith, uh, uh, uh tried to learn a trade like welding. Um, but the uh, the world was more or less\nclosed, and, uh, we were, we were um, jealous of all those who had found a, a way uh, especially\nafter the November events, uh, England took in uh, uh, ten thousand children, and it is to their\nhonor, I must say that, in spite of all the policy Mr. Chamberlain had followed before with his\nappeasement, and his famous uh peace, when he came back from Munich, uh that he had seen Herr\nHitler, and he had brought back peace on our time, um, but uh, uh, uh, uh America remained closed\nbecause there were quotas, and uh, uh also, uh, uh, other countries closed their doors so um, um\njust the, the will to get out was not enough. Uh, also you have to have, find a country which was\nwilling to receive you, and that didn't exist. And there are many infamous cases, one of them, for\ninstance, the chapter of the St. Louis, the boat which went out from, from Germany with refugees,\nuh, came to Cuba, and Cuba--Batista at this time, the head of the uh, uh--------government, declared\nthe visas as invalid. The boat could not uh disembark the passengers. The uh captain turned the\nboat around after a certain time hoping that the uh, the Jewish organization would, would help, and\nthat governments would come to his help. The boat actually cruised before the coast of Miami.\nThe people on the boat saw the lights of Miami Beach, but America refused entry. And therefore\nthe people had to be taken back to uh Germany, and uh, the Captain uh who was really a hero, then",
        "very, very slow, hoping that a solution could be found, and then eventually uh, uh, uh, uh, uh ended\nthat, uh, in this way that, that France and Belgium and Holland and England agreed to take so and\nso many of these uh, uh, uh, uh refugees, uh, but certainly uh, many of them, who, who landed in\nFrance and in Belgium and Holland, later were overrun by the Germans when they conquered these\ncountried. So, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh with the November events, uh, there was a complete change, and\nalso, we then realized, especially when we worked, those of us who to save the children, that uh\nwar might be imminent. And, uh, the, the, the speed of our work was dictated uh also very strongly\nby the fact that uh, uh, we had to t-try to complete the job before uh, uh, uh there would be uh, uh\nthis terrible thing called war. And, uh, uh, uh, after Jews in Germany, and I can only speak for\nthem, were thrown out of their positions after November, uh, they were drawn into what I called,\nwe called later, uh, uh, uh, uh slave labor, uh, uh, uh, taken into labor gangs as trench boat workers,\ndiggers, and so on, and uh that was the situation uh, uh, uh prevailing between, I would say,\nNovember of 38 to the beginning of the war, which was September 1939. (Sigh)",
        "Now, looking back on all you experienced, how strongly do you feel about revenge, especially in\nAuschwitz? How did you feel about it.",
        "Um...I've been asked that question about revenge uh a couple of times last month these, when I was\ngiving evidence in, in, in, in criminal procedures against the uh the uh the uh criminals, the, the,\nthe, not war criminals, but uh the, the, the, those who had been -------------, were, were, were, were\nbrought to trial. The uh the uh, uh SS gangsters of Auschwitz and so on. Um, I personally, I can't\nspeak only personally, I never felt revenge. Uh, because this was not part of our education. Uh,\ncontempt, yes. I have a con, a deep contempt for especially those, those, those people who talked\nso much about their heroism, the heroism of the Nordic race and all that, and then at the same time,\nthey who were not fighting at the front, were fighting children, old men, and, and, and women. Uh,\nI also say that uh, uh, was, it's part, I think, of the heritage of which I am very, very proud. On the\nday of the liberation, and I liberated myself together with some friends, by running away from my\nkillers, to the uh American forces operating in Northern Germany near Shrelin--8th Division on\nthe, I think the command of General Geffin, wonderful uh man. Uh, when we got into the city of\nShrelin, and when the Americans had taken over Shrelin on May 3, 1945, you could find all kinds\nof German weapons there, from missi---from, from, from, from pistols to machine guns, to the to\nthe to the bazookas--whatever it was. You could grab them, and you could start your own private\nwar. And, uh, uh I'm certain that if we would uh, there the, the German soldiers surrendered en\nmasse to the Americans, uh, and they were very happy to surrender to them, and not to the\nRussians because also they were under the misconception that the American would welcome them,\nuh, and ask them to turn around in order to fight the war against the Russians. Uh, we uh, when we",
        "uh, uh, amongst those who surrendered there were cert-certainly quite a number of SS men, and SS\nguards and so on. And if we had taken any of these weapons there and just killed these uhhhhh,\ncriminals, I'm certain, uh, especially under the circumstances prevailing in these days, nobody\nwould uh, uh have had objections, I guess. But we didn't do it. It was not part of our education. It\nwas not part of our value system. Uh, because we believed that one day there would be justice, and\njustice should be meted out by ther proper authorities, and that would be it. That we were\ndisappointed by many of these procedures...\nLet's reload.\nBeep.\nYou may search the historical records of those days, especially after the liberation, and you will\nfind, do not find one case in which a liberated former concentration camp inmate had taken revenge\nagainst, uh, an SS guard, personally. Uh, because, yes, that's what we believed in, in justice. Ina\nproper uh, uh, uh, uh court of justice uh, these people had to, would had to answer for their crimes.\nUh, but we were later became rather disappointed, uh, especially with a practice uh in Nuremberg,\nwhere, uh, people were sentenced, and then very early released, even if they were guilty like hell.\nIncluding the uh, the tycoons of German industry, that's another chapter, a regrettable chapter,\nwhich is a part of American history, I'm sorry to say.\nCan you talk about your own personal feelings at liberation--the mixture of joy and sadness, the\nrealization you're alone.\nWell, uh, certainly uh, uh, uh, I remember that very well uh, that morning of, of uh May 3, 1945\nwhen we saw the American flag hoisted uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, in, in, hanging from the trees in the\nforest near Shrelin, and then we realized that we had been just rebor, uh, and had uh received a new\nlease on life. Uh, I remember uh we, we embraced each other. I was in a small group of uh people,\nand, and we were laughing and we were crying, and, was a tremendous uh, uh feeling of relief, but\nalso of burden because uh we realized that uh this moment for which we had waited years and\nyears, we couldn't share with uh, those of us who had deserved it--our own families. And we rea-\nrealized also something else, especially the Jewish uh, uh persecutees, that we had no home left to\ngo to. I, personally, knew that going back to Berlin would be a hopeless--I couldn't find anybody\nanymore. And I was uuhhh, therefore, uh, I had to settle for a certain transitory existence\nsomewhere else. I knew I wouldn't stay in Germany, because for me, Germany was one big\ncemetery. And therefore, uhhhhhhh, it, it, it, it was especially, and this is the specific situation for",
        "the, for the survivors, for the Jewish survivors. The world was celebrating, I remember how\njubilant the Frenchmen were amongst us when he saw the tricolor hanging from uh, from the roofs\nin Shrelin, and they were dancing. We couldn't dance. We had no right to dance. So, that was the\nmoment of, of, of, of tremendous elation, but also tremendous sadness, and, every one of us uh felt\nuh, uh, we were grateful to the Allies who had liberated us, but we were alone. Uh, individually\nalone. And uh, uh, uh, uh...looking into a future uh, uh, uh, uh, in, in which we, we had hoped will\ncome one day, but we didn't know at the moment how to handle it.\nCan you describe for me some of the different kinds of camps that existed. People don't realize that\nthere were more than one kind of camp.\nWell, uh, uh, you had in, in, in, in, in the concentration camps have a history. Uh, it started, if I'm\nnot mistaken, with the first camp in Dachau in Munich. Then you have one camp at the at the\nbeginning of the Nazi time. Then you had the uh camp near Berlin, Sachsenhausen ---------------,\nwhere I was after coming back from Auschwitz. Uh, there was Buchenwald. Uh, there were the uh\nthe uh, camps 1n, in the -------------, uh, uh, uh where mainly political prisoners were kept, but the\nSwool?? system changed completely after uh, uh, uh Hitler invaded Poland, and uh, uh, then\nentered Russia, and uh...for reasons which are still difficult to analyze, uh, the extermination camps\nwere not established in Germany proper, but on Polish soil, like Auschwitz and Treblinka and\nMajdanek and Sobibor and ---------. We had gas chambers. Crematoriums they had in all the\ncamps, but gas chambers you did not. And the major centers of extermination, which I call human\nslaughterhouses, were just Auschwitz and Treblinka and Majdanek.\nWhat about all of the work camps? What was the fate of the people in the work camps?\nWell, there were, there were different uh, uh, I'm not familiar with ---------- because I never, never,\nnever uh, uh, if I may say so, served in them. There were certain labor camps, for instance, uh, at\nthe beginning, uh people were taken out of the, of Polish cities, Jews were taken out to help to\nbuild the Audubon, the uh the uh highways and so on. Uh, and they were, some of those camps\nwere not guarded by SS, were guarded by the so-called -------------------. They were certain\ndifferent, different, different kinds of treatment. All this came to an end later when Himmler uh,\nuh, uh, and especially the SS Economical Dept uh, uh was in charge of, of, of the camps because\nfor the SS, uh, don't forget this, these camps, to a certain extent, was a good, were a good uh source\nof income. Uh, for instance, in our camp, in, in, in Buna, uh, the SS received for each worker\nworking in the -------------Factory, a certain amount of money. We, we never saw a penny of that.\nBut as --------------- paid a certain amount. For me, for instance, a little bit more because I was a",
        "so-called skilled worker. Uh, and so, the SS actually uh, uh had the benefit of the slave labor\nthere, uh, which later resulted uh, for instance, in certain suits. I, after 1951, sued Aichfarben?? for\nthe non-payment of, of wages to us, but that's another story. Anyhow, uh, the SS uh, uh, uh, uh, uh\nmanaged these camps certainly also for their own uh busin--uh profits in monetary form. It was not\nonly uh a place to keep people and to, to in, to uh, uh, to prote--uh, for, for security reasons. There\nwas also, uh, they, they uh could uh, uh squeeze out as much as they could in order to profit from\nit.\nWhat do you think survival is a matter of?\nSheer luck. I was once asked by a journalist I should explain to him the art of survival. Uh, there\nis no art on that. It's a sheer accident. I knew people who were much stronger than I am, uhhhhh,\nwho were, who were looked like, like indes, who looked like indestructible human beings, who,\nafter a certain while, also lost the uhhhh will to live because they have not enough food, or a\nsickness struck, and so, it's like uh, uh, survival, as I say, is an accident. Like uh, like the survival\nof a, of a soldier in battle. Uh, uh, he might lose, uh, he might lose a friend to the left, he might\nlose a friend to the right, he himself uh, uh can survive. Why? Nobody knows. Because, uh, uh,\nuh, uh, on the bullets uh, uh directed at him, there, there is not his name tag. Uh, we, we were in, in\ndanger of, of death, we lived with death side on side. Uh, even at the last moment when, when\neverything was lost already for the Nazis, and when, together with a small group of friends, we\nescaped the killers to reach the American lines. The uh, the uh, the forward section of the\nAmerican lines. Uh, even then they were still shooting after us. But, luckily, as I said, our nametag\nwas not on the bullets.\nWhat about choices? You made lots of choices which ended in helping you survive.\nYeah, but you never were, uh, know how, how, how this will--you never know the result. You\nknow, under normal conditions, you might uh be able to, to uh, to make a reasonable decision, and\nsay, \"It might result in this, or might result in that.\" Or, as my uh teacher, Leo Begg, always said,\n\"People are thinking, um, ahead, and they are, they are planning a hundred different possibilities,\nbut the hundred first actually occurs.\" Uh, under un-normal conditions, under outrageously un-\nnormal conditions, uh, for which actually uh the human condition is not prepared, there is no\nchoice. It is sheer luck. It, and it's, luckily, and I am one of the luckies.\nI'd like to do one more roll.",
        "Okay.\nBeep.\nCan you talk about the choices of the guards and the SS, did they have choices? Were they only\nfollowing orders? Were they acting on their own?\nWell, I'm not too familiar with the, I'm familiar only with the literature I've seen after the war. Uh,\nthere were certain, ch-first of all, I want uh state very clearly that uh, uh when the SS or some of the\nSS men in these trials pleaded uh, uh, uh, uh innocence or, or said that they're not guilty because\nthey're following orders, there's not one case known in which an SS man refused to serve in a, in a\nconcentration camp or a death camp, and was put on trial, or was, was, was, was shot or whatever it\nis. Number two, um, amongst the SS uh, uh people, there were certain people who uh, uh just tried\nto uh to uh, uh, uh show their heroism by being more brutal than the other. And, uh, interesting\nenough, this uh, uh, this uh, this uh, uh enigma or it's a miracle, I don't know, whatever you might\nsay, that especially those who originally from Austria were more brutal because they were not\nconsidered by the -----------as, as, as complete heroes, and they wanted to show them uh, that they\ncan do better. Uh, so, therefore, uh, uh, in this respect, the SS men had certain choices. Uh, he\ncould have done his guard duty, duty probably without being uh, uh brutal. Uh, but uh, uh, uh,\nmany of them volunteered for these services, and, and felt very good about it. Uh, uh...to be a, a\nmember of this group uh, uh means that you had to have a certain mentality, uh, especially these SS\nguards in, in, in the concentration camps because uh, certainly they were, they were programmed\nsomehow uh because uh, uh they were told uh, over the years that uh Jews are vermins and that\nthey have to be eradicated, and that uh they are the uh, the race, the, the, the Nordic race, they're the\nheroic race, and, and, and the Superace, and so, and they meant it, and they believed in that. Uh,\nbut it is their fault.\nDid you run into one who was kind or helped or saved anyone?\nNot that I know.\nYou saw yourself in the mirror once when you were in the -------. Can you describe that.\nWell, we had no mirrors in the camp actually, you know, but um, yes, I, I remember that. After a\ncouple of weeks when I was out of these um, um murder commandos, I uh, got a job as an assistant for\nthe, for ----------, and was able to work in a hole, protected against the elements, and uh, there was also a",
        "bathroom which could be used, uh, otherwise we were not allowed to use the bathrooms of the German\nsuper-superrace, and there found a mirror, and I looked into the mirror, and I got, I was aghast, I was, I\ncouldn't believe myself that that's me. I, I, uh, uh, not only did I, I had uh lost weight, but lost hair, but\nthe expression of my eyes and so were unbelievable to me. And, and, and, and um, it was not\nencouraging I would say. But, uh, on the other hand then I said, \"Well, uh, if that is so, uh, uh, still uh,\nthis cannot kill my spark of life, not at this moment at least.\nThat spark of life, was there ever, how did you, how did all of you relieve yourselves? Did you ever\njoke, did you ever have...\nWell, there was humor, there was real humor also, sure, sure, sure. And, I was, I must say, a lot of like,\nI'll tell you the story about my friend, contempt for those people, who, who, who we uh, uh, counted out\nof the human race somehow if I may say so. They themselves con-considered themselves as supermen,\nbut, but uh, but we does, didn't agree with them. Maybe that's clear. Uh, we counted them out. And\nwe, we the only questions we, we raised time and again, like my friends, was that uh thank God I, I, I, I\nwas not created in the image of those people uh, uh, uh try to understand, I, I remember uh discussions I\nhad with the, with the British prisoners of war. I saw to it that to give them as much information as\npossible because I told them time and again, \"You'll probably be able to uh, to uh, to survive because\nyou're under the protection of the, the National Cont--uh, uh Red Cross, and irrespective of the fact that\nthe Germans disregard the uh rules and regulations of the National Red Cross, but you have more of a\nchance to survive. And, if you should survive, and we shouldn't survive, please be aware of this and\nthis and this and that, and I told them about the things going on, and the gas chambers and so on. So\nthen one of these people, and they were wonderful, these, these boys, said, \"Norbert, explain to me one\nthing. These are, look like ordinary human beings. They have eyes like others, they have noses like\nothers. Their mouth is the same. How 1s this possible?\" And the only answer is, is that you cannot\nexplain it. And I think we, we lack explanation up to today. Well, if I may say so, especially, in face of\nthe uh, revisionists today, and and, and writing this history, what happened we know, this is, now it's\ndocumented, and one day we find another document, and so, the facts are established, more or less. The\n'why' will probably never be established.\nCan you talk a little bit about the friendships and the support.\nYes, this, this was a very important source of, of ,of resistance if I may say so. That uh, especially with\nuh, with certain people got together and said, \"Let us try to share whatever we have.\" Uh, you want to\nshare abundance, it's easy, to, to share a shortage is not easy. And, they called this uh, uh, uh 'Powkas.'\nWhere the, where the, where the uh expression came from, I don't know. So, they uh, uh, there were",
        "friendships, and I had certainly my friendships with the people who were in my transport, uh or the\nsame youth movement. We tried to always, tried to get together, to find the beds in the same area, and\nthey have a word of encouragement and so on. I unfortunately lost all of them uh, due to circumstances,\nand that hurt me badly. Uh, so I was trying then to reach out to others with whom I established contacts\nand with whom I have contact up to today, as far as they survived, because this was very important,\nespecially when we were aware that uh, the, that on the military front, things developed in our favor.\nAnd, uh, I will never forget when uh, the, the, the uh news reached us even behind the barbed wire of\nAuschwitz, that the Allies had landed in Normandy, and uh, uh, there was a mistake before because I\nthink by some, some, some error, a girl in London had given out uh, uh, uh a telegram, and later it\nturned out it was a mistake. And that also reached us. And the British ----------- and they came next\nmorning, and we heard the BBC News uh, uh told us. But, when the landing had occurred, and when\nthe uh, when the uh, when the uh, uh, uh, uh bridge had had been established, and we knew that uh the\nGermans had not been able to throw the Allies back into the sea, there was tremendous uh feeling of\nelation and joy, and, and it was almost like bread. Uh, it uh, because, because, uh, uh, human beings\nalso live on hope, and uh, there was only a question how long would it last that after the invasion in, in,\nin, in, in June 1944, it would take uh time up to May 45, that Germany would surrender. This we don't\ndidn't expect. But, 1t gave us a tremendous lift-up, there's no doubt about it. And, uh, so, uh, uh, uh, uh,\nyou know, in this respect, uh, also I have, I would say a word about something else, uh, which has\nsomething to do sprit-spiritual resistance. I was working in the camp in Auschwitz, uh, doing some\nwelding work in the camp proper, and then I heard that the British soldiers had been brought to\nAuschwitz in their own camp and were working on in the factory, and I heard this, I asked uh for a\ntransfer to a commando where, where, where I could meet these British soldiers, which was not easy.\nAnd, uh, luckily my school English was good enough to communicate with them. They were very\ncareful. The British were very, very careful. But after a certain while when they when they came to the\nconclusion that they can trust you, they became wonderful friends. There appearance in Auschwitz was\none element of not only joy, but elation and, and encouragement. They were healthy, they uh, they uh,\nthey uh, they had been transferred from, from North Africa to Italy, and from Italy to Upper Silesia, and\nuh, they had uh, the privilege of their Red Cross parcels, which they shared with us to a certain extent.\nWe have just run out.\nBeep.\nWhy don't you back up to where you said there were tremendous ------------.\nWell, the fact that when we could, when we saw the British uh soldiers, uh, who encouraged us,",
        "and, on the first day when I marched out and they came from, let us say, from the left, and we came\nfrom the right, they were throwing cigarette packages at us, and chocolate packages at us, and they\ngave us uh, they, they said, \"Don't worry, you'll be home by Christmas.\" That was, that was, that\nwas like manna, it was, was a tremendous amount of encouragement went out from them, and, uh,\nthen later when, when we had uh some, the SS guards uh were not uh, uh, uh controlling, could not\ncontrol all individual actions anymore, and we tried to get to, to somehow have contact with them,\nuh, uh, as I say, I personally uh built a wonderful bond of friendship with them to such extent that\nthey had when I, when Auschwitz was evacuated on uh January 18, 1945, uh, when the Russians\napproached by the way of Krakow already, I walked out of Auschwitz with British uh army boots,\nand, and British underwear, and uh, uh, uh, uh really, with a feeling that that, that uh they meant it.\nAs a matter of fact, uh, some of them, I met, I met after the war, uh, two of them or three of them I\nmet when I give evidence in Nuremberg against -----. Also, later I, I kept contact with them, I'm\nstill in contact with some of them. And uh, uh, even one day, I was brought over to England uh,\nuh, uh because they had a story of one of them, uh, this is your life, and 1t was a wonderful get-\ntogether with them because these were rather simple people, but wonderful solid people with, with,\nwith character, and they somehow uh extended the uh, the uh hand of solidarity of man, to these,\nuh, uh, to the, to us, to the prisoners, who were who were who were who were, who had lost\neverything, but they gave us a tremendous amount of courage and encouragement and, and uh, uh,\nuh this is a chapter, which up to now has not been described. I hope one day it will be done\nbecause uh, I said it on that occasion when I was uh, uh invited to London, that England can be\nvery, very proud of these men, who were, who really proved that even in Auschwitz uh, uh\nhumanity could prevail.",
        "Can you describe for me what were chances of survival were being ---------------- based on your age\nand your sex. I think most people don't realize what your chances were a child or if you were a\ncertain age.",
        "Well, certainly that's, there, there are 2 groups of people who had no chance, and always no chance.\nThese were the children and these were the elderly. Uh, and, also for those uh who were uh, uh\nbrought to Auschwitz, uh mothers with children uh had no chance either. Those who were, who\nwere still capable to work, as long as they were capable to work, and able to work, had a certain\nslim chance, but they had a chance, how long it lasted, that was uh a matter of, of, of uh, uh, uh\ndaily destiny, I would say. Because in the morning you wouldn't know if you would be able to see\nuh, to see uh, to reach uh the evening, and on the evening you wouldn't uh, uh be sure that you\nwould uh, be able to, to see the sun, in the next, the sun going up the next morning because death\nwas a constant companion. But, uh, uh, uh, uh, this was, this, this was, this was more or less the,",
        "uh, call it the uh, the uh, uh like an assaulting factor uh, uh, only the able-bodied, as long as they\nwere able-bodied, had a chance to survive.\nWhen you say the children and you say the elderly, what are you talking about in terms of age?\nI would say, uh, there are certain cases at the age of 10 pretended to be 12 or 14, and they managed\nto, but these are, these are uhhhhh, a few cases. Uh, elderly, well, there was one camp in, in, in\nCzechoslovakia called Theresienstadt or Terezin, where uh elderly people uh, uh found their place,\nand also, uh people who had uh, uh received the decoration as veterans of WWI. That was at a\ncertain time, and, and uh, even the Red, the National Red Cross was fooled by going in there and\nreporting that that how wonderful uh the existence (coughs), not how wonderful, but the existence,\nthere was bearable, so the Nazis tricked them into them even uh, uh organized shows and so, and\nafter the Red Cross had left, they sent the people to Auschwitz. Uh, and, but, uh, the, the, so the e-\nelderly could exist for a certain while in Theresienstadt, but many died there already on\nmalnutrition, exhaustion, sickness and so on. But then, starting especially in 1944, also the elderly\nfrom Theresienstadt was sent to Auschwitz for extermination. So uh, you know the uh the policy\nof, of the Nazis uh changed constantly, but the goal, the main goal, uh, to exterminate the Jewish\npeople, remained.\nCan you talk about how Kapos could be good or not good.\nYes, I mean, this is also a mat-a matter of uh, uh human, human disposition. Uh, there were, I\nremember, uh Kapos who were rude, rude to uh, uh who uh who uh, uh, uh, uh, had, uh, who,\nought to be, or were, were to be treated like the Nazis themselves, but I also knew people who\nreally tried to, to do the best in order to help, no doubt. Uh, a Kapo I know had become a, a, a, a\ncurse word, to a certain extent. It is not fair. In general you can say that uh, not all uh, uh passed\nthe test, but uh, I can vouch for it that many tried to behave, and tried to help, and, and, and, and uh\nhad kept their reputation intact.\nCan you tell me what an appel is.\nAn appel is a roll call. In other words, uh, uh since the Nazis were so eager on security, uh,\nespecially when I came to uh to uh, uh Auschwitz, we had at least twice uh, a roll when the\nmorning before we went out to work, in the evening when we came back, and uh, uh, so technically\nwhat happened, uh so happened that each com, each block, each uh, uh barrack, uh had its own\nplace where there, where people were counted, and uh, after they were counted, then the whole",
        "camp was called to attention, and the number uh inmates was reported to uh or to the commandant.\nNow, uh, when the, when the figures tied in properly, uh, uh, it lasted twenty, twenty-five minutes,\nhalf an hour or so. When, when, but when the figures did not tie in, then it could last hours and\nhours uh, uh when they discovered uh their mistake, and that was uh, uh rain or shine, in the winter,\nduring the summer, irrespective of this, uh, under the German motto that \"-----------------,\" which\nmeans \"there must be order.\" And only when they were satisfied that the figures were tying in\ncompletely then they, they, they released uh to, to, to, to retire to our barracks.\nWell, that's all?\nI could go on, but... We have to room tone again. That means we have to stay quiet. We're doing\nroom tone, Brett!\nThis is without motor.\n(Norbert laughing).",
