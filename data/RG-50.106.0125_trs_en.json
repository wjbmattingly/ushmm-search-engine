We saw all the blitzkrieg, all the poen \u2014 the Polish\nsoldiers are very \u2014 very tougher, yes, but they had nothing. And in Krakow we\nwere living. To Bielsko you could not go again.

He was known with\nWeizmann, | know, I remember that he was corresponding with him and was doing\nvery much and was very known, and now known in \u2014 in Israel, too.

And I \u2014 many\npeople which they were \u2014 how to say it? [speaks foreign language here] they sent\naway into \u2014 into lager, yes. And I \u2014 I remember that I had no s \u2014 I had no idea what\nit all 1s, I was very stupid, I think. And I was sitting in a \u2014 on an interview, too, and\n\u2014 and I \u2014 and a \u2014 an interview and such a small officer with eyes, a Mongol or\nsomething else, yes, was interviewing with me and I said all how it was and how \u2014\nwhere I am coming \u2014 going and so on.

And that was September, because clearly I don\u2019t know quite sure\nwhat date it was, of course, but I think it\u2019s the second half of September, we were\nagain in ro \u2014 in Krakow. We saw all the blitzkrieg, all the poen \u2014 the Polish\nsoldiers are very \u2014 very tougher, yes, but they had nothing. And in Krakow we\nwere living. To Bielsko you could not go again. Bielsko was occupied all, we lived\nat once. At the beginning we lived in the flat of my \u2014 of my aunt.

He was known with\nWeizmann, | know, I remember that he was corresponding with him and was doing\nvery much and was very known, and now known in \u2014 in Israel, too.
