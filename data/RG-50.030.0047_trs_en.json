        "A: No, when I was in high school -- first of all, when I was in public school, how my life start? I\nwent one time with my father to a dentist, and I look around and I said, \u201cI would like to be a\ndentist.\u201d So my father look at me and said, \u201cOk, if you will be a good pupil, student, you will\nbe a dentist.\u201d But this dentist, he was a good psychologist, and he said, \u201cIf you like to be a\ndentist, you can come to my office to watch after school, after homework, and you are very\nwelcome.\u201d And I was coming to him, and when I graduated from high school, still I was\ncoming to him, and I was assisting him. And I learned about everything else from his work.\nThen when war broke up, no, that's it, I couldn't do nothing. then after war was finished. I am\ngoing a little too -- then I start to study in grad school, dentistry. But during the war, first\nwhen the German attacked Polish country, this was in September Ist, 1939. There was a\nterrible time. There suddenly became airplanes and they start to bombard people on the\nstreet. There was exactly vacation finishing, and the children, they have first day at school,\nand they came in this beautiful weather. The sun was shining and they was walking on the\nstreet. And suddenly came planes. You -- we didn't know. We thought this is our own planes.\nVery low. And they suddenly start to with machine guns killing the people on the street.\nThrowing bombs, was killed, terrible thing. And then we heard on the news that this is for\nthe war. The Germans attacked Polish country. So after two or three days, there was -- the\nPresident of the Poland, he gave an order to young people to run away to east, in the\ndirection of Russia. So we went, four brothers together in the east to the city of Lvov. We\ncame there. It was terrible way because we were going only really walking, running, and\nduring the day time the planes, they are going low on the way and was killing people, he\nrefuge, the refuge -- no, the refugees. Ok, so this what happened and Lvov, when we were\nthere a few days there came Russian and the German, they went back and they took the part\nof Poland and half of part of the city of Przemysl where we were living. So the city was\ndivided by river San. One side -- east -- was Russian, and west was German. So we can see\neach other. And I worked there in polyclinic, but -- and during this time, when was Russian.\nMy parents, they still were working in our place. And my brother, elder, was in hospital.\nAnd the young-- younger brothers, they were working in the place to get some work because\neveryone supposed to working. And then started another war. And this was in June 22, 1941,\nthe German attacked Russia, and in a few hours later they were in our town and other they\ncame.\nSo it was kills. There was -- after this, the Russian came back and they was fighting about\nthe city of Przemysl one week, seven almost days. So, in the morning, there were Russian.\nAt night, there were Germans. And every person was hiding deep, you know, in the cellars\nand other, other places because we didn't know what to do. After seven days, the Russians\ngot to go back, pulling back, and the Germans are coming. So we were -- we want-- wanted\nin the beginning to go with Russian, but they said they won't take us civil people. Only they\nwas going by themselves. So we left there, and the Germans came. And after a few weeks --\nthis was 1941 -- they start to make orders, ghetto Jewish -- segregate Jewish people.\nEverybody has to work -- arbeit.\u2019 And start to be difficult life, but still we didn't know what.",
        "Q: How many of you were together?",
        "A: In this time, we were four brothers together. My sister was still in Lvov, in Lemberg.\u201d",
        "Q: Could you hold up the photograph of your family, please, so we can see it?\n' Work (German).\n* Lemberg is the German name for Lvov.",
        "A: Yes.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: But I will explain who is who. So this is my father. This is my mother. This is my older\nbrother, the physician. And this is my sister, and this is my younger brother, who were killed\nin the war -- like in ghetto. They took them to concentration camp. This is the mother-in-law\nof my youngest brother's wife. This is her mother and her father. They was together killed in\n1942. Those taken to a concentration camp from ghetto. That's my close family. This is from\nghetto, when we were there. We were working. This is for my oldest brother, the physician.\nHe worked in hospital, and there was like a field hospital in ghetto -- small hospital. He was\nworking like a physician there, and this is his ID. And this was my ID. I was working with\nhim there, the same, given in, in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: So in the beginning, when we were in ghetto, we have to go. We were organized. Young\npeople -- everybody has to go in the morning under the guard to do work. So I was working\nwith my older brother. We have to -- they took us to a special place. We were loading coals\nin the wagons forward and back, under heavy guard, from morning until late evening. And\nnothing to eat. Only you have to work in there. If you have something with you -- a piece of\nbread, anything -- you could have.\nAnd we work very hard. Then -- this was like in 1941. Then in 1942, they start to take so-\ncalled Aktion\u201d -- take people from the ghetto and make smaller ghetto. So they surround, for\nexample, one part of ghetto. And this part people couldn't live there. They have to go to the\nwagon, to the train, and they was taking them out. Nobody knows where they were sent.\nThere's only -- they're taking us another place. They will have good life working, and this\nand this. So the people cannot say no because there was an order. So you have to stay. So\nthis was in 1942. 1941, they, they asked to get -- to give to them thousand young boys. But\nthe ghetto, the -- no. In ghetto, the people who are partners like small government in ghetto,\nthey, they was taking time. They didn't like to give the young people. They wanted to have a\nlist of young people. So this was going to 1942. And then in the beginning of 1942, they\nsaid, \"Two thousand.\" And they came. They have at least -- they came to our home, and they\nwanted to take me. But my younger brother, he was a little physical stronger, he said, \"No, I\nwill go.\" And they took him to the concentration labor-like camp in Lvov. And this was the\nyoung boy who they later hanged. And they took him there. He, he voluntary -- he was going\nbecause he wanted to save my life. And I was still working with my, with my parents and,\n* Murderous campaigns undertaken by the Nazis for political, racial, or eugenic ends\n(German).\nand my brothers in ghetto. We apparently didn't know about deaths, what's happened to my\nbrother. But my wife how she told you, she was going over there. She was in contact with us.\nShe help us. She was working with my mother and father in this small shop. She was like our\nown sister, like a daughter. She was very attached to us. We were attached to her. But she\nwas Aryan.\nShe had no -- Catholic, so they didn't touch her. So she can go some. She was sneaking\nunder the fences in the ghetto, and she brought something and this and this. We have contact.\nWhen they took my brother to Lvov, she was going to see him, because she was a girl and\nshe was Catholic. She could go close and see something. He can go to the fence or\nsomething. She ask some watchman who are same day. Maybe they let her go to talk. So she\nwas in contact with him. One thing she make arrangement with him, but she will break. He\nasked her that he wanted to run away and maybe she will hide him. So she has to bring him\nsome clothes, this and this; and they make arrangement where, where he has to come to see\nher. And this time she came but they make special hours when she will meet him. But there\nwas now going the military trains, and all kinds of civil trains were stopped. First, military.\nSo it was a couple of hours, maybe two or three hours late she came, because the trains was -\n- she couldn't come. In meantime, he -- according to, to his agreement with her -- he left the,\nthe camp, and he saw a woman who was similar to my wife. He came to her. And then she\nwas not this right person. So when he was turning back, he want to go back, some\nwatchman, they find him. They saw him. Now they took him back to, to camp. And when\nmy wife came to see him, they told her it's too late. They hanged him. So she came very\ndepressed.",
        "Q: Let's make something very clear. Slow down a minute, please. Relax. We have plenty of\ntime. You are about 18? How old are you?",
        "A: 24 at this time.",
        "Q: 24 at this point, all right. Your wife was 16, 17?",
        "A: She was 17, yes.",
        "Q: All right. We need to make clear that she was obviously not yet your wife.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And that there was indeed -- because she was Catholic, you would have tended not to think\nin those directions.",
        "A: No. She was only very, very attached to us. She was like a relative. We, we love her very\nmuch, and she love us very much.",
        "Q: Let's talk now -- I want to talk about you. I don't want her story, or her side of it. I want your\nside of it, all right? Your brother has been has been taken, has been killed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you do? Where were you at this point in time?",
        "A: In ghetto, in Przemysl. And we got the message. We didn't tell the parents what was\nhappened. To them, they didn't know about it. And we work. And then -- and this was July --\nin August 1942. They make another ghetto -- smaller -- another Aktion. They took our\nparents, and they took away. And I remember when they was concentration them in the place\nI was staying, and I was crying. And there was staying a young soldier. He asked me, \"Why\nare you crying?\" I said, \"They are my parents!\" He said, \"You will never see them.\" I said,\n\"They supposed to take them to, to a job to work.\" \"They will murder,\" he said. \"You will\nnever see him -- them.\" If you want, you can bring them little tea or something to drink. But\ngo fast.\" And I was running back to home, and I prepare something for them, and I came. It\nwas too late. I saw them already pushing to the cattle wagon, with sticks. They was pushing.\nAnd my father, he turns -- like my mother was turned down; and he looked and he saw me,\nand he said like this [gesturing father waving goodbye to Josef]. And this was the last thing\nwhat I saw. Then -- and there was in the meantime other Aktion. And we still working hard.\nAnd, and November 18, 1942, there was the Aktion.\nRight before the people, they was finding out that they were an Aktion. So they make under\nthe kitchen an apartment. There was like an entrance to cellar, and we make like a bunker.\nWas hiding entrance, and we make like a bunker. And we were sitting there. There was\nalmost thirty people there, and we are sitting. And we went on November 17th at night there\nhiding. On November 18th, in the morning, start to be the Aktion. We heard noises,\nshooting, screaming. And barking dogs and everything. And we heard what's going on.\nThen, almost at the end, was almost probably before seven o\u2019clock, after six, before seven\no'clock in the evening, there was dark because the weather was snow, cold. And somebody\npushed the window, and they said it was covered with sack -- with straw. We didn't know\nabout that. Because was called a sound from the people who were Ordnungs,\u2019 the people\nwho was helping the, the, the SS men. He pushed with a stick the, the, the sack with straw,\nand was a little light. Because we were sitting in dark, but still came a little light inside. He\nsaid, \"If somebody's hiding there\" -- he said this automatically -- \"has to get out, because we\nwill throw grenades insi-- inside.\" So there was a woman near the window sitting. She\npushed her daughter, and said, \"Go. Save your life.\" She pushed her through the window.\n* Ordnungsdienst [Order Service] (German).\nThe daughter was maybe eight, nine years old. And she pushed her, and she start to scramble\ngo through the window. And suddenly, the SS man who was far away, they was almost\nfinished the job. They turned back and saw the girl coming out, and this guy, he was helping\nher. They came back. And they start to beat her and kick her with feet in, in the face in front\nof entrance. And then the mother start to scream. And they opened the doors, and they said,\n\"Out! Out! Out!\" And there was standing a row with soldiers and with policemen with rifles.\nAnd they throw us \u2014 \u201cGround! Ground!\u201d And was they hitting us with rifles. Who got down,\nthey killed him on the spot. Who could run has to go another place. And they, they -- I, I,\nwith my brother and my cousin, we were running. We got the full blows, but we survive. We\ncame to the place they keep us together. And there came a sergeant, and he said, \"Now, we\nwill shoot you. Stay in a row.\" And my older brother, who was saying to me, he said, \"Aim\nyour chest to the rifles. Because,\" he said, \"They will hit you in the arm or in your ear. They\nwill not shoot you twice. And they will put line -- put you in a great big line, and you will\nsuffocate. So try to aim yourself,\" he said, \"and stay.\" And we were staying in line, and they\nwith the rifles, they wanted to shoot us. Suddenly came an officer, an SS officer, and he's\nasking, \"What's going on here?\" They said, \"No. We find they're hiding Jewish people.\nAccording to the order, they're supposed to voluntary come here. They didn't come, so we\npicked them up. And now we have to shoot them.\" He look on us. He said, \"No. The train\nstill is under the station. We need fat Jewish people. We need there for some -- \" He said like\nsoap or something, I don't remember so. \"Put them to the train.\" And he put us -- they put us\nto the train. There was in my wagon was over a hundred people like sardine together, you\nknow. And was -- this was winter. But we were thirsty, dry mouth, dry tongue. high\ntemperature. We was sitting, and we couldn't, we couldn't breathe. And they locked the door.\nThere was barbed wires on the small window. And the train start to move. And one man, he\nhang himself in the train in the belt, and they tried to cut him off, and they cut him off and he\nwas angry.\nHe said, \u201cNo. I will not go for -- so you will have to... No! Don't! No!\" He was screaming.\nHe hanged himself. And I was going, I said to my brother, \"No, I will not go there. I will\ncommit suicide. I will not go.\" He said, \"Don't do this. Don't.\" I said, \"No, I will never go.\"\nAnd I was going little by little, they helped me came to the window. And I don't know how I\nfind in my pocket pliers. I have this small pliers. And I start to break the barbed wires. I was\nworking a long time, and I cut my hands, was bleeding. And I broke the wires. When I was\nin bunker, I had a loaf of round bread. And I saved them. They was taking us, I took the\nbread. Here I had little belt. And when I broke the wire, I said, \"Push me through the\nwindow. I will jump.\" And the people start to push me and my head forward. Was tight, but\nwhen I was looking down, I was on the running, you know, the wheels train. And then I saw\nthe tracks and the small stones, like gravels. Everything. I said, \"No. I will not go with my\nhead, because I will -- right to the wheels.\" It was like instant. One second, I wanted to\ncommit suicide. Another second -- like instant -- I said, \"Put me back! Put me back!\" They,\nthey pull me back, and I said, \"I will go with my legs forward.\" And they pushed me with\nmy legs, and I was hanging on the left hand. I was holding the window outside. I was\nhanging, and the train was 1n good speed. When the train was taking a curve, I jumped\nforward and I was sliding. And suddenly I felt severe pain in my chest, and I was\nunconscious maybe a few minutes. I don't know how long. Then when I came to my normal\ncondition, I saw in my breast there was a hole like a fist. And this hurt my chest, because I\nstopped on a small post with wires. There were some wires. And I came out, and the train\nwas far away, and I was running up the train. The train -- there was snow, and I was looking\nwhere would I find my brother. No, but I find two other boys who jumped. One has broken\nhere bone, clavicula (ph) bone, broken. One was moving.\nAnother, his face scratched, but nothing special. So I helped. I took the, the belt. I put like\nhere [showing that he tied the arm to the man\u2019s side], to, to keep the hands not moving. And\nI said, \"We have to run away.\" So we are going under the hill just like small way. There was\nsnow. And we were going to the place that was called Lipowice. Was after Przemysl maybe\nseven kilometers, maybe more. And I went there, and I told them, \"I have here a man.\" And\nnormal, in wintertime of skiing, and I was coming to him to buy tea or coffee or some\ncookies. And I said, \"I will go to him. Maybe he will give us shelter for one night. But then\nhe will think in the morning what he have to do.\" And I went to him, and I knocked on the\nwindow. He opened, and I told him who I am. He was a nice man. He was scared, very,\nbecause he knows what happens. \"Nobody has seen you?\" I said, \"No, no.\" And he gives us\nthe shelter. We were sitting on the bench all night. And he give some to drink, you know,\ncoffee or anything. People drink only water, because we have very high temperature, very.\nThen in the morning we said goodbye. And we said to each other, \"Everybody's going in\ndifferent way. They will not catch us together. Only separate way.\" As a matter of fact, after\nwar I met them. They survive. So I went to my friend, who was working in hospital. And I\nwent to him. I was holding my loaf, bread loaf, under my arm, and I was looking like a\nworking man who's going to work. And when I came to him, he was scared. I told him\nwhat's happened, and he said, \"Ok, I will try to do the best for you.\" And he was keeping me\nin a small cottage, which was his mother's cottage, but she was not in this time at home. So\nhe said, \"Stay here.\" He locked me inside. And I was there all day, and I didn't know what to\ndo. And I was...\"Maybe I can trust him, maybe no. Maybe he can go to Gestapo or\nsomething, and this will be the end.\" But on the evening, he came. Was about eight o'clock.\nHe said, \"Joe, I am sorry. I was going around. I cannot find place for you. I cannot keep you,\nbecause my wife she is scared. We cannot risk our lives. So what you want to do? Tell me. I\nwill bring you in any place.\" He worked in hospital, and he had those carriage with two\nhorses. Always he could travel, because he can ride this. So there was -- on the other side of\nthe Przemysl there was a bridge. So to go to the town where I was living before, we have to\ncross the bridge. But on the bridge, there was always watchmen, German.\nThey were watching who was crossing; they were looking inside you're not smuggling\nsomething. So he said, \"I will risk my life and your life. But you have to lie down under my\nfeet. I will cover you with a blanket. I will keep my feet on your face. And I have the pass, so\nI will try to go. But don't move. We will see. Maybe we'll be lucky.\" And really, we went\nthere. They stopped him. But they know him, and he's showed them the pass. They was\nlooking inside, but they didn't look too much. He was holding the feet on my back. And we\npassed. So they came downtown, close to my street that I was living. He said, \"Joe, good\nluck. That's it. And do what you want.\" I said thank you, and he left. So I didn't know where\nto go. I went back to the place where we were living before. And I went to cellar. There was\nnot basement, only cellar -- open cellars. And I was sitting there, and, and I saw this is not\nrealistic because the people who maybe who lives there know who was living there, they can\ncome back to cellar. They will see me. There was open space. And there's -- in fact there\nwere rats and mice and dirt. So I said, \"Maybe Stefania, maybe she will let me stay for one\nnight.\" And I went upstairs, and I was knocking at her door. And she -- first she asked me, I\ntold her quietly, \"It's me.\" And she opened the door, and she saw me. Now, I was really in\nvery bad condition. And she was very mercy to me with her really soft heart. She was most\ncaring. She helped me to wash and this -- and she gave me her bed to sleep. And her sister,\nshe was wondering what's going on. Because she saw me first, little sister. And she\nexplained her how this, anyway. And the morning, she put me under the bed; and on the\nfront of me, she put a sack with potatoes. She had a sack of potatoes there. So I was behind\nthe sack of the potatoes, and she covered me blanket. She said, \"Don't make noise, because\nthe people are coming -- friends and this -- and they cannot see you.\" So this was for a few\ndays. Then she went to my brother. He worked tn, in a farm which was under supervision of\nmilitary, belonged to the military, and they -- all brothers was going through the military.\nSo my brother was working there with his fianc\u00e9e. And when was the Aktion in the ghetto,\nthey hold the people there because they know they will go back to ghetto, and they will take\nthem. The, the -- no, the SS will take them. But they wanted to save them, because they\nneeded them for work. So they told them stay this night and one day more here. They were\nsleeping there. So my wife, she came. She told him what's happened, and she told him that I\nsurvive. I came, and I'm at her home. He was very happy. And he was crying, also, because\nwe lost the rest of the family. And then his wife, and they was taking them back to ghetto\nunder guard -- I don't know how -- she run away. And she came to us to home...to...to my\nwife's, where I was hiding temporary. No, she said, no, she will not go to ghetto. She doesn't\nlike to go. I didn't like to either go to ghetto, but my brother, he went back to ghetto with the\ngroup. And then he came there. He start to contact with us. And then he told us in the ghetto\nnow is quiet, temporarily is quiet. \"Nothing there, nothing. No Aktion. So you maybe you'll\ncome back.\" After a few days, we went back to ghetto.",
        "Q: What was the ghetto like at that time?",
        "A: This was no -- there were a few streets they surrounded with fences. And there was watch,\nlike police. Police watch-- watching men, Polish, and there was German. Was the stationary\nbecause when it was Aktion, it came special group--SS or special military group who was\ntaking the Aktion then or doing this. But when this other, they left to the domestic people to\ntake care about the ghetto. That the people cannot get out, that cannot go in. But my wife\u2019s\nlittle sister. She was going, playing and she was the messenger. She was bringing some\nmessage. We wanted something. We asked her. She would prepare in, in the evening.\nAlways I was under the fence sneaking through the town and I was coming and I took her to\npick up something. No. In the meantime, my brother, he got typhus and his friend got typhus.\nThat was terrible thing, but we need something to -- there was no medicine. Nothing but\nsomething to, to keep them strong, to fight the temperature. So my wife, she prepared a sugar\nor milk or some cheese, butter -- something. And I smuggled this back to ghetto. Some drugs\nlike painkiller drugs, you know, against high fever. This was, she could get without a, a\nprescription. So, like aspirin, you know -- such things like that. So kids, they survive, thanks\nGod. But one time -- I have to tell this story. I was going from ghetto, and, and my watch\nwas 8:30. But the, the curfew was until 9:00. After 9:00, they can catch anybody on the, on\nthe street. They can kill without asking if you have no permission to go on the pavement.\nAnd I had always dressed similar to the dress like the young Hitlerjugend,\u201d they were wear.\nThose high shoes, short tight black pants, and nice coat and a nice hat with a, with a -- with\nthe, with a -- like a, no, like a shaving thing, you know? Like a feather, yes. And I was going\nalways dressed in this. But this time I had an attach\u00e9 case, because I was going to my way to\npick up some food and my watch.\nAnd I changed my dress from my old dress to this dress. I forget to put this -- I\u2019Il show you\nthis false document. And I'm going... There was a bridge from the ghetto, which was going\nto the town, but the, the bridge was going from street to the factory which there was fixing\nbroken cars, trains and everything. So -- but on the side was entrance to ghetto, but this was\nblocked by barbed wires. And was like a road that you cannot go to ghetto. But always I was\ngoing through the holes, and I was going to the bridge down to the town. And when I was\ngoing downstairs to the town already, suddenly a flashlight went to my face. \"Oh,\" I said.\n\"That's it!\" And in German language, somebody said, \"Hande hoch!\"\u00b0 I put my \u201cHande\nhoch,\u201d and the attach\u00e9 case fell down. So he came close. And I said, \"No, this is German\npolice. That's it! They will finish me.\" But I said why. And then came this Polish policeman.\nHe was speaking German. He asked me, \"Who are you? Where are you going?\" I said, \"No,\nI will not tell him that Iam come from ghetto.\" I said, \"I am going from the factory. I worked\nfor my father.\" I said, \"Dinner -- lunch. And I -- dinner -- and I am going back from factory\n\u00b0 Hitler Youth (German).\n\u00b0 \u201cHands up!\u201d (German).\nhome.\" \"Give me your documents.\" And I am looking in pocket, and I don't have my -- they\ncalled the ID card was Kennkarte\u2019 in German, ID card. I was looking. I said, \"I am sorry. I\ndon't have in this dress. But if you like to come with me to the factory, there everybody\nknows me and, and they will tell you who I am.\" And I told, \"I will go with you back.\" Then\nwe will be close to the entrance to the block, entrance to the ghetto. I will give him a blow,\nand I will jump to ghetto. But he was smart. He said, \"No, no. No way! No way!\" I said,\n\"Why?\" He said, \"Maybe you are a spy.\" I said, \"What kind of spy? You are a Polish man,\nand I am a Polish man. And I am a spy for whom? I am spying for Germany?\" He was\nworking for Germany. \"I'm not spying for Germany.\" He said, \u201cDon't touch me.\u201d He start to\nswear to me: \"You such -- out. And you, we're going to Gestapo.\"\nAnd I know if he will go with me, and this is -- he said, \"You know, it is 9:30.\" And I show\nhim my watch, was 8:30. He said, \"Throw your watch under the running train. This is 9:30.\"\nMy watch was not working. And I was late. After curfew, curfew. So he said, \"We are going\nto Gestapo.\" And like this, and I know if he will go on the street at night with this -- with me,\nthe German, you know, police, they are going also patrols. And they will see him holding.\nThey will take me from him, and they will kill me on the spot. So I, I know the psychology\nof the Polish people. I start to talk him: \"Hey, you are a tall guy and I am a little short man.\nAnd you are holding me under gun. What you think, that I will kill you or I will run away?\nYou're supposed to be ashamed! You're a coward.\" Like this. And he said to me, \"You don't\n--\" T said, \"You're a coward.\" So he put his gun here, the rifle. He walked with me like this,\nand we start to talk Polish. I talk to him Polish. So, really, there was going a German patrol,\nbut they look on us and they didn't touch. Because he was a policeman, and I was talking to\nhim Polish. He was talking to me Polish. They didn't understand what we were talking about.\nSo they thought maybe I'm also a, a secret police. So I am going with him.\nSo one thing passed away behind me, and then we are going, there was a street up. And I see\nfrom far away, like maybe two hundred yards, a small light. And there stand a watchman as\nthe Gestapo watchman. That's the Gestapo office. I said, \"This is the end!\" And I talked to\nhim. No, no, no. He is taking me there. I said, \"Listen, if I am a partisan, you know, they are\nwatching you. Your whole family will be killed, and you will be killed. They will put in fire\nyour house. You will not survive.\" I said, \"I don't care. They will kill me, but you will -- \" He\nsaid, \"I don't care. Now this is wartime, and this is my duty.\" And sudden, I don't know,\ncame to my mind something. And I hit him with my right hand. He was taller than me. I hit\nhim once right, and then upper cut his left. He fell down like a piece of wood. I felt I have\nsuch power because this was death -- life or death. And I was so angry. I was said to him,\n\"You dirty pig! You will get what you deserve! I could kill you right now,\" I said, \"but I will\nnot do this. I will not make my hands dirty.\" And I turn around and I was going on the hill\n\"ID card (German).\nthe street down. I was not running. And then, in the last minute, I start to run away. And I\ncame to my wife at night. I was out after 10:00, and she was, \"What's happen?\" And I told\nher the story. And I was all night staying there. And next morning, I told her, \"Go look on\nthe street. Watch what's happen.\" She went. She came, said, \"Nothing. No nothing, and\nnobody.\" I don't know. You know, quiet. And in the evening, I was going back to ghetto.\nAnd when I was jumping through the bridge, I heard shooting -- [Imitating shooting sound].\nAnd I went myself, and then I saw, look what's happen. There are another like SS man or\nmaybe not SS man, but he was a secret police. There was lying a woman he took from the\ntrain. A woman, he was taking off her shoes. She was still alive, and he was taking off her\nshoes. He killed her because he felt she was a Jewish person. They found her. Anyway, I\nwent to ghetto. And I came to there, and I was there for a while.\nThen her sister always was with her and counting, and I came back. I talked to my wife was\nyet to find a place to hide, because in this place we cannot stay. I said, \"I have to come with\nmy brother, with his fianc\u00e9e, and my friend and his daughter. Would be about five to seven\npeople.\" And so we organized. She's under -- \"The beginning,\" she said, \"1t will be very\nhard.\" So I said, \"Listen. We have to do this.\" So she was looking, and she find on the hill is\nlike a side street on the border of the town. The name of Tatarska (ph) Street. And this was\nlike a nice small cottage. And I came with her once there before she made the arrangement.\nAnd I said, \"This is perfect for this purpose.\" So she make the whole thing legal. She says\nshe make -- she get the papers. And when she moved there, I came there with my friend.\nAnd first we were looking around; and I think, \"We have to make a bunker.\" So under her\nbed, I cut a piece of floor. We start to digging hole. We were digging, and she was taking in\nthe evening in a sack this ground. And there was some trees, and between them she was\nputting the, the, you know, the soil, so nobody would see the soil. And we make such in that\ntwo could stay there. The attic was too open. And there was like a ladder from the hole.\nThere was a hole between attic. So I was thinking, \"Later.\" But for first thing, I said, \"Instead\nof sit in the open attic, maybe we will be there.\" But then came the father of, the father of the\ngirl, and, and came another, my friend. So was a little more people. And I...I don't know\nwhat to do. I said, \"Now we have to go upstairs because we cannot be in the hole.\" So we\nare, we are sitting in the open attic. And then I told to my wife, \"Look, maybe we will find\nan old wood, something that we can call and make a first row similar to this round wood.\u201d\nThis would be nothing new. And I said, \"We will make a false wall, do something.\" Was\nvery difficult. She was running around many places, and then she find somebody. And they\nbrought her this, and she said she like to have this for wintertime for, for fire. So they left\nthis. And she brought this little by little inside. The neighbors was asking, \"What?\" She said,\n\"No, for I like to cut this and cut for wintertime.\" So was not for -- not I wanted. Then when\nshe brought the -- we measured everything. We cut it by little and we make numbers that\neverything will fit. Then we have to nail this. There will be noise. So I advised my wife\nmake washing, laundry -- everything. And ask them if they have ropes and nails, that you\nwill put them 1n attic, you will hang them and they will dry. The, the, you know, the washed\nlaundry. So that. So they did, and this time, instead of putting nails and put, you know, the\nropes, we know they, they were fast. Then we put a little also outside, and if you put\neverything there, there will be not now, they will be exact like 1s dirt and, and from the\nspiders. The -- took from our place they put another place. Was look exactly like old thing.\nAnd this the, the attic was shut in maybe like two yards. I make sure of it. And I make, make\nthe roof was going on an angle, so I make a small door, so that I can every time open, watch\nand close right away if somebody will come. And I was this what I have my curved spine.\nAnd that's because almost two weeks I was laying like this, because I was watching always if\nsomebody not come. And it's hard to know. We were there. It was very fine. And then the\npeople that come, little by little, from ghetto-- then my brother and his wife, they came, the\nlast ones. But so other people, they came little by little. There was story how they were\ncoming. But my wife, I think she thought about it. So anyway, we were all 13 there..\nNow we have to organize food and organize the regime control that we do not do something\nwhich can be dangerous to our life. So I make like the [indecipherable]. Every two hours\nsomebody sitting watching. They will be not snoring at night. So we have a stick with a\nrabbit, this was from a rabbit like with the tail. And I told them if somebody was snoring,\nyou go to your nose to wake up. But don't make noise. Because you have to be, perhaps\nsomebody will wake you up and try to sleep on the stomach. Everybody on the stomach, not\non the back because you will snore. That was dangerous, number one. Number two, no\nsmoking. The people, they want to smoke. They were smoking anything. I said, \"No\nsmoking, because the, the smoke will go to the place within the, the wall, or they can see at\nnight light through, or can be a fire. We don't need this.\u201d So there was really a fight to\nconvince the people that this is tragedy. This is not for us. Then one, the woman who came\nwith her two children, she got typhus there. And she, she was infected in ghetto, but after a\nfew days, after a week, the typhus develop. And she had high fever, temperature. She was\ntalking. So I was the one who was taking care of her. I said nobody could come close to her.\nSo it was really tough, because there was not too much space, but she was -- I was watching\nher. I shave her hair, and I said to my wife, \"Do anything what you wanted to get\nsomething.\" Because after experience with my brother in ghetto, to keep her going. And she\nwas trying to buy for her sugar and something, and aspirin and this and this. And anyway, I,\nI make also a prescription for heart, you know, some medicine to keep, make the heart going.\nAnd she went to pharmacy. And I said, \"Maybe, we ok. Maybe, no.\" And she made it.\n.\nI don't know how. She got started. It was another story, but a lot -- she made it, she got it, she\ncame. Anyway, the children were prepared if she, God forbidding, passed away, that we in\nthe hole will make a, we will make a hole, a grave. We will put her temporary there. Because\nwe had to be prepared for everything, I told them. But anyway, she survived, was Ok. Then I\nconvinced the people stop smoking, and about snoring. Then was problem with, with food,\nbecause this woman she wanted special, special food all the time. But something was very\ndifficult to get. This was not so easy. Was tough time. But we were sitting. Was many, many\nstories, like my wife told you. They came, they gave her two hours to move out. We asked\nher to run away, to save her life and her sister. \"No,\" she said no. And she was staying, and\nshe survived. Then came the German. They came, they have two nurses -- there were two\nnurse and their two boyfriends. And they was almost everyday sleeping there. So we were\nabove them. And sometimes there was little noise, because they can hear. And I was feeling\nthat this is very dangerous. They are there. And one time, like my wife told, they came. They\nwas holding my wife, and one nurse also was with them and one was running. There was\nlike not stairs, only there was like no...",
        "Q: Ladder.",
        "A: Ladder. And...and no -- you can hear the noise if somebody stepping on the -- so I was\nhearing something. And I closed the door. And suddenly came one of the nurse. She was\nlooking around, going around looking, not quiet. Was the last moment. And she went down,\nand she told them no. So my wife, she saw what's going on. Then she bought chicken, and\nshe was holding the chicken in, in the hole, and the chicken was making noise. Something to,\nyou know, to mask the noise. And this was what we're doing to, to try to, you know, to\ncamouflage everything. Then about food. Her little sister, she was coming bringing\nsomething bread. I have always there a few loaves of bread, which changing I make some\nmess, like a nest; and there was exchanging every time fresh and they all using what we were\neating. And to not make suspicious the, the neighbor, so she says, \u201cShe is bringing bread and\nshe is selling bread.\u201d And always was going in this way, that they couldn't count how it is.\nWhat was hiding. And she never was talking to people. She could play with little children,\nand never -- she never said a word about us. And one time, they came. My wife, she didn't\ncome to work. And there was another, she has to work. So she was -- a few days she didn't\ncome because she was feeling sick. She didn't feel good. And I see through the window --\nbecause always we were watching to see if someone could see a policeman is coming -- a\nPolish policeman and a German policeman is coming. So I told her, \"Go with us to the, to\nthe\" I said, \"to the bunker. Hide. And they will only your little sister.\n.\nShe will tell them that you went to buy some food, you know, in the village, something.\"\nAnd they knocked on the door, and she opened. They came. \"Where's your sister? Who are\nyou, your sister? Where's your sister?\" Said, \"She went to the village to...to buy some food.\"\nThe policeman, he turned and slapped her in the face. She fell down. And he said, \"Why are\nyou lying? Your neighbor, they told us that she was just now out here in the yard.\" And she\nstart stutter \"Why I, I have to lie? She went -- she has to go through the yard. So she was in\nthe yard, and she went to, to the village. How she can go to, to the village. She has to go\nthrough the yard, so maybe they saw her.\" She talk to them. I, I don't know. She told she told\nthem that she's going to, to buy food, and they look and they start to look around. She didn't\nhave nothing there. A piece of bread and a little soup. Nothing. He said, \"That's all you\nhave?\" \"Yes.\" \"You're alone at home?\" She said, \"Yes.\" \"You sleep alone?\" \"Yes.\" \"You're\nnot afraid?\" She said, \"Why I have to be afraid?\" \"That's what you are eating?\" And she said,\n\"Yes.\" They left her, and she didn't say nothing. And they left her, and, and my wife was\nhiding, and she came out. That was one episode. There was many, many episodes during the\ntime. There was almost two years. Every day, each hour was something that our life was\nthreatened with gun. At the end, when our -- one thing was good. They have a radio, the\nGerman. And they was listening to the news, and I was listening to the news. And we can,\nthey are listening to us we can thinking how they are going back. They're running away. And\nI said to my wife, \"Soon or later, very soon, you will have your Russian. Because they give\nthem hell, and they ran.\" And all my -- almost I find the day when they will come. And I\nremember the last day when we heard there was fighting. And we can hear the noise of the\ndifferent noise of different bullet, different rifles.\nThe Russians have different rifles, and the German have different rifles. We heard the\ndifference in the noise. So I said to my wife, \"Probably they will come, but they are\nfighting.\" We cannot go down, and we have to stay in the attic. But the bullets and ding,\nding, ding, you know, was hitting. I said to my all people there, \"Listen, we have to lie down.\nKeep something between your teeth. If somebody -- they will hit somebody, you cannot\nscream. If somebody will be dead, he will be dead. This is our last chance. But if they find\nus, if somebody will scream, she will be killed and her sister will be killed. And we will be\nkilled. Because everybody now look for each other. So you have to be prepared that\nsomething will happen no worse, nothing.\" And we are lying down and listening, and she\nwent down with her sister. She went down, and with the neighbors was waiting. And\nanyway, we under-- we can hear the bullet. Some start to be more close, and some start to go\naway. And I said, \"I think probably the Russian are coming. Because listen to the Russian\nsound of the bullets, the noise. But we will see.\" Then early in the morning, by six or seven\no'clock in the morning, I look through the small thing. They are going about six German\nsoldiers with rifles, the helmets. All came back going on the street up. I said, \"My God, still,\nstill there are Germans here.\" And suddenly it came out a few boys with the armbands and a\nfew soldiers, Russian soldiers and to them, \u201cHands up!\u201d And they fell down, and they were\nbegging. I said, \"Thanks God, we are free!\" And that's it. Next day, this what happened -- or\nthe same day. I don't remember. Came two Russian, White Russian. One was the lieutenant\nand one was a sergeant. And they came. She was in the window singing, and this happened.\nAnd they came, and first they asked, \"Is Germans here?\" She said, \"No, there are no\nGermans here.\" \"Can we come?\" And said, \"Ok.\" They came inside. And my wife, she\nclosed the windows; and they start to talk this and this and not so. My wife asked them\nalways, \"How far are Germans? Maybe they can come back.\" They was suspicious.\n\"What?,\" they asking. \"What?\" \"Because,\" she said, \"there was one time that he went back,\nthe Germans came back. So this is what I'm asking.\" He said, \"Don't worry. They are chasing\nthem. They are running away. They are loosing their pants, pants.\" And they said, \"They are\nrunning away. They will never come back here.\" And we heard. We were standing behind\nthe doors, but we heard this. And we came and sat. But look, we couldn't talk, because we\ndidn't talk, only were whispering for almost two years. We couldn't walk, because there was\nnot walking up and down, just not exercise. We were pale, you know, and terrible. And they\npicked up their rifles. \"Who there?\" They thought maybe partisans. So she told them. And\none of them was a Jewish lieutenant and his family was from Ukraine killed by Germans.\nAnd he -- and his sergeant, he was a regular Russian. He said, \"My, my goal is to chase the\nGerman and give them back what they did to my family, to my family.\" He was crying. He\nwas kissing us, hugging. He said to my wife, \"You are really hero! You are really hero!\nWithout weapons, without nothing, you could fight so many as 1n the little girl, the sister.\"\nThey took pictures, and said, \"What you need? We will give you what you need.\" He said,\n\"We have the German hospital here, there, there. The whole thing there. Loaded with\neverything. What you -- dresses, shoes maybe. And we will bring you meat.\" And we said,\n\"No, no. Not now. We would like to have freedom.\" And how we did it, because we were\nafraid about neighbors still. So we told them that -- it was night, we will go, the men, with\nthem back to hospital. And next day, they will bring us, we will come back like guerrillas\nwho are coming to, you know, with the army. And we will look for my wife. I will ask the\nneighbors about her. We will come like guests. We came. We survived; we will hug her, we\nwill kiss her. So they will not suspect that it was us she was hiding people. They said, \"That's\na good idea.\" And we went, and the women and children were still with my wife there. Next\nday, in the morning, we came with them. There was a wagon with horses and everything was\nthere. We had rifles with us. And I came, and I am looking; and I asked one neighbor. I\nknow them, because when I saw them, I said, \"Hey, do you know if still around a...a girl?\nHer name is Podgorska, Stefania Podgorska. She's my friend, my, my neighbor. I have to\nseek her.\" She said, 'Why, yeah, yeah, yeah. She 1s a good girl. She's...she's...\" They thought\nmaybe we would kill her. Because some people came to take advantage, maybe somebody\nthat paid them or hanged them. Said, \"No, no. She is my good friend. She's -- I'd like to see\nher.\" She said, \"Well, she lives there.\" We were going there. We knocked on the door. She\ncame: \"Ahhh! Hi. Hi.\" And we were greeting each other. And there was beautiful thing what\nshe did. They -- we start to give to her some food, bring everything. And we lived --",
        "Q: Ok, we've got about two minutes. Is there anything -- this is quite a story. When you, you\nhad embraced, you were free, where did you go?",
        "A: In town, to find an apartment to live. And next day, I find apartment. Was occupied by\nGerman, some people. German, and they run away. They left everything they had.\nEverything was there. So I moved to the apartment. And I took the apartment. And then I\nhad -- twice they came because there was some band of people who were killing people who\nsaved Jewish life and, and the survivors. They killed them. They said, \"One bullet for the\nsurvivor, two bullets for this who saved them -- for them who saved them.\" And they was\ngoing around, but after a while they caught them. They came twice to my apartment. I was\nliving with my brother, his fianc\u00e9e, my wife, her sister; and we lived there. And they came.\nThat was on the second floor, and there was a balcony outside. There was knocking on the\ndoor. So it was night, was like in winter, in February. And they said -- I said, \"Who are\nthere?\" And they said, \"Mailice! Milice!\u00ae Open!\" I said, \"What are you looking for?\" \"You\nhave to go with us to, to work. We have to fix the bridge. Is broken bridge.\" I said, \"No, I'm\nnot going at night with nobody. You have some business to me, well, come in the morning\nwhen it's lighter.\" People. I will see who's who. They start to swear to me. \"Open the door, or\nwe will break the door!\" Like this, like this. I saw who were there. I run on the balcony. I\nwas screaming for help, help -- and they start to run away. This was number one. And then a\nfew months later, another time they came. So the commandant of the city -- there was a\nRussian commandant. And I went to him, and he told me, \"Listen, you will never survive\nhere.\"",
        "Q: You left, is that true?",
        "A: Yes, I left. He said, \"Go to another part of Poland, where nobody will know you. Nobody.\nChange your name from the Pol -- Jewish name or German name to the Polish name.\" And\nwe did. \"Under new name, go and stay in another place of Poland where nobody knows you.\nMaybe you will survive.\" But the best thing that I will tell, if I don't tell you this in secret. I\nran away from him. This no place for me to live. We want to survive. \"Go west in the\ncountry. West, if you can.\" And this happened. I went to Krakow. I changed my name. And\nthen I went to Wroclaw. I was studying. I was accepted there. Again, I studied from\nbeginning my dentistry. I graduated. I was working. I was assistant, and until I left Poland;\nand now I am here, thanks God. And I am very happy I am in the United States. I went here\nto Tufts University. I graduated, and I am a dentist. Thanks God.",

The Germans attacked Polish country. So after two or three days, there was -- the\nPresident of the Poland, he gave an order to young people to run away to east, in the\ndirection of Russia. So we went, four brothers together in the east to the city of Lvov. We\ncame there. It was terrible way because we were going only really walking, running, and\nduring the day time the planes, they are going low on the way and was killing people, he\nrefuge, the refuge -- no, the refugees. Ok, so this what happened and Lvov, when we were\nthere a few days there came Russian and the German, they went back and they took the part\nof Poland and half of part of the city of Przemysl where we were living. So the city was\ndivided by river San. One side -- east -- was Russian, and west was German. So we can see\neach other. And I worked there in polyclinic, but -- and during this time, when was Russian.\nMy parents, they still were working in our place. And my brother, elder, was in hospital.\nAnd the young-- younger brothers, they were working in the place to get some work because\neveryone supposed to working. And then started another war. And this was in June 22, 1941,\nthe German attacked Russia, and in a few hours later they were in our town and other they\ncame.\nSo it was kills. There was -- after this, the Russian came back and they was fighting about\nthe city of Przemysl one week, seven almost days. So, in the morning, there were Russian.\nAt night, there were Germans. And every person was hiding deep, you know, in the cellars\nand other, other places because we didn't know what to do. After seven days, the Russians\ngot to go back, pulling back, and the Germans are coming. So we were -- we want-- wanted\nin the beginning to go with Russian, but they said they won't take us civil people. Only they\nwas going by themselves. So we left there, and the Germans came. And after a few weeks --\nthis was 1941 -- they start to make orders, ghetto Jewish -- segregate Jewish people.\nEverybody has to work -- arbeit.\u2019 And start to be difficult life, but still we didn't know what.",
        "A: In this time, we were four brothers together. My sister was still in Lvov, in Lemberg.\u201d",
        "A: Yes.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: But I will explain who is who. So this is my father. This is my mother. This is my older\nbrother, the physician. And this is my sister, and this is my younger brother, who were killed\nin the war -- like in ghetto. They took them to concentration camp. This is the mother-in-law\nof my youngest brother's wife. This is her mother and her father. They was together killed in\n1942. Those taken to a concentration camp from ghetto. That's my close family. This is from\nghetto, when we were there. We were working. This is for my oldest brother, the physician.\nHe worked in hospital, and there was like a field hospital in ghetto -- small hospital. He was\nworking like a physician there, and this is his ID. And this was my ID. I was working with\nhim there, the same, given in, in the ghetto.",
        "A: So in the beginning, when we were in ghetto, we have to go. We were organized. Young\npeople -- everybody has to go in the morning under the guard to do work. So I was working\nwith my older brother. We have to -- they took us to a special place. We were loading coals\nin the wagons forward and back, under heavy guard, from morning until late evening. And\nnothing to eat. Only you have to work in there. If you have something with you -- a piece of\nbread, anything -- you could have.\nAnd we work very hard. Then -- this was like in 1941. Then in 1942, they start to take so-\ncalled Aktion\u201d -- take people from the ghetto and make smaller ghetto. So they surround, for\nexample, one part of ghetto. And this part people couldn't live there. They have to go to the\nwagon, to the train, and they was taking them out. Nobody knows where they were sent.\nThere's only -- they're taking us another place. They will have good life working, and this\nand this. So the people cannot say no because there was an order. So you have to stay. So\nthis was in 1942. 1941, they, they asked to get -- to give to them thousand young boys. But\nthe ghetto, the -- no. In ghetto, the people who are partners like small government in ghetto,\nthey, they was taking time. They didn't like to give the young people. They wanted to have a\nlist of young people. So this was going to 1942. And then in the beginning of 1942, they\nsaid, \"Two thousand.\" And they came. They have at least -- they came to our home, and they\nwanted to take me. But my younger brother, he was a little physical stronger, he said, \"No, I\nwill go.\" And they took him to the concentration labor-like camp in Lvov. And this was the\nyoung boy who they later hanged. And they took him there. He, he voluntary -- he was going\nbecause he wanted to save my life. And I was still working with my, with my parents and,\n* Murderous campaigns undertaken by the Nazis for political, racial, or eugenic ends\n(German).\nand my brothers in ghetto. We apparently didn't know about deaths, what's happened to my\nbrother. But my wife how she told you, she was going over there. She was in contact with us.\nShe help us. She was working with my mother and father in this small shop. She was like our\nown sister, like a daughter. She was very attached to us. We were attached to her. But she\nwas Aryan.\nShe had no -- Catholic, so they didn't touch her. So she can go some. She was sneaking\nunder the fences in the ghetto, and she brought something and this and this. We have contact.\nWhen they took my brother to Lvov, she was going to see him, because she was a girl and\nshe was Catholic. She could go close and see something. He can go to the fence or\nsomething. She ask some watchman who are same day. Maybe they let her go to talk. So she\nwas in contact with him. One thing she make arrangement with him, but she will break. He\nasked her that he wanted to run away and maybe she will hide him. So she has to bring him\nsome clothes, this and this; and they make arrangement where, where he has to come to see\nher. And this time she came but they make special hours when she will meet him. But there\nwas now going the military trains, and all kinds of civil trains were stopped. First, military.\nSo it was a couple of hours, maybe two or three hours late she came, because the trains was -\n- she couldn't come. In meantime, he -- according to, to his agreement with her -- he left the,\nthe camp, and he saw a woman who was similar to my wife. He came to her. And then she\nwas not this right person. So when he was turning back, he want to go back, some\nwatchman, they find him. They saw him. Now they took him back to, to camp. And when\nmy wife came to see him, they told her it's too late. They hanged him. So she came very\ndepressed.",
        "A: 24 at this time.",
        "A: She was 17, yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. She was only very, very attached to us. She was like a relative. We, we love her very\nmuch, and she love us very much.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: In ghetto, in Przemysl. And we got the message. We didn't tell the parents what was\nhappened. To them, they didn't know about it. And we work. And then -- and this was July --\nin August 1942. They make another ghetto -- smaller -- another Aktion. They took our\nparents, and they took away. And I remember when they was concentration them in the place\nI was staying, and I was crying. And there was staying a young soldier. He asked me, \"Why\nare you crying?\" I said, \"They are my parents!\" He said, \"You will never see them.\" I said,\n\"They supposed to take them to, to a job to work.\" \"They will murder,\" he said. \"You will\nnever see him -- them.\" If you want, you can bring them little tea or something to drink. But\ngo fast.\" And I was running back to home, and I prepare something for them, and I came. It\nwas too late. I saw them already pushing to the cattle wagon, with sticks. They was pushing.\nAnd my father, he turns -- like my mother was turned down; and he looked and he saw me,\nand he said like this [gesturing father waving goodbye to Josef]. And this was the last thing\nwhat I saw. Then -- and there was in the meantime other Aktion. And we still working hard.\nAnd, and November 18, 1942, there was the Aktion.\nRight before the people, they was finding out that they were an Aktion. So they make under\nthe kitchen an apartment. There was like an entrance to cellar, and we make like a bunker.\nWas hiding entrance, and we make like a bunker. And we were sitting there. There was\nalmost thirty people there, and we are sitting. And we went on November 17th at night there\nhiding. On November 18th, in the morning, start to be the Aktion. We heard noises,\nshooting, screaming. And barking dogs and everything. And we heard what's going on.\nThen, almost at the end, was almost probably before seven o\u2019clock, after six, before seven\no'clock in the evening, there was dark because the weather was snow, cold. And somebody\npushed the window, and they said it was covered with sack -- with straw. We didn't know\nabout that. Because was called a sound from the people who were Ordnungs,\u2019 the people\nwho was helping the, the, the SS men. He pushed with a stick the, the, the sack with straw,\nand was a little light. Because we were sitting in dark, but still came a little light inside. He\nsaid, \"If somebody's hiding there\" -- he said this automatically -- \"has to get out, because we\nwill throw grenades insi-- inside.\" So there was a woman near the window sitting. She\npushed her daughter, and said, \"Go. Save your life.\" She pushed her through the window.\n* Ordnungsdienst [Order Service] (German).\nThe daughter was maybe eight, nine years old. And she pushed her, and she start to scramble\ngo through the window. And suddenly, the SS man who was far away, they was almost\nfinished the job. They turned back and saw the girl coming out, and this guy, he was helping\nher. They came back. And they start to beat her and kick her with feet in, in the face in front\nof entrance. And then the mother start to scream. And they opened the doors, and they said,\n\"Out! Out! Out!\" And there was standing a row with soldiers and with policemen with rifles.\nAnd they throw us \u2014 \u201cGround! Ground!\u201d And was they hitting us with rifles. Who got down,\nthey killed him on the spot. Who could run has to go another place. And they, they -- I, I,\nwith my brother and my cousin, we were running. We got the full blows, but we survive. We\ncame to the place they keep us together. And there came a sergeant, and he said, \"Now, we\nwill shoot you. Stay in a row.\" And my older brother, who was saying to me, he said, \"Aim\nyour chest to the rifles. Because,\" he said, \"They will hit you in the arm or in your ear. They\nwill not shoot you twice. And they will put line -- put you in a great big line, and you will\nsuffocate. So try to aim yourself,\" he said, \"and stay.\" And we were staying in line, and they\nwith the rifles, they wanted to shoot us. Suddenly came an officer, an SS officer, and he's\nasking, \"What's going on here?\" They said, \"No. We find they're hiding Jewish people.\nAccording to the order, they're supposed to voluntary come here. They didn't come, so we\npicked them up. And now we have to shoot them.\" He look on us. He said, \"No. The train\nstill is under the station. We need fat Jewish people. We need there for some -- \" He said like\nsoap or something, I don't remember so. \"Put them to the train.\" And he put us -- they put us\nto the train. There was in my wagon was over a hundred people like sardine together, you\nknow. And was -- this was winter. But we were thirsty, dry mouth, dry tongue. high\ntemperature. We was sitting, and we couldn't, we couldn't breathe. And they locked the door.\nThere was barbed wires on the small window. And the train start to move. And one man, he\nhang himself in the train in the belt, and they tried to cut him off, and they cut him off and he\nwas angry.\nHe said, \u201cNo. I will not go for -- so you will have to... No! Don't! No!\" He was screaming.\nHe hanged himself. And I was going, I said to my brother, \"No, I will not go there. I will\ncommit suicide. I will not go.\" He said, \"Don't do this. Don't.\" I said, \"No, I will never go.\"\nAnd I was going little by little, they helped me came to the window. And I don't know how I\nfind in my pocket pliers. I have this small pliers. And I start to break the barbed wires. I was\nworking a long time, and I cut my hands, was bleeding. And I broke the wires. When I was\nin bunker, I had a loaf of round bread. And I saved them. They was taking us, I took the\nbread. Here I had little belt. And when I broke the wire, I said, \"Push me through the\nwindow. I will jump.\" And the people start to push me and my head forward. Was tight, but\nwhen I was looking down, I was on the running, you know, the wheels train. And then I saw\nthe tracks and the small stones, like gravels. Everything. I said, \"No. I will not go with my\nhead, because I will -- right to the wheels.\" It was like instant. One second, I wanted to\ncommit suicide. Another second -- like instant -- I said, \"Put me back! Put me back!\" They,\nthey pull me back, and I said, \"I will go with my legs forward.\" And they pushed me with\nmy legs, and I was hanging on the left hand. I was holding the window outside. I was\nhanging, and the train was 1n good speed. When the train was taking a curve, I jumped\nforward and I was sliding. And suddenly I felt severe pain in my chest, and I was\nunconscious maybe a few minutes. I don't know how long. Then when I came to my normal\ncondition, I saw in my breast there was a hole like a fist. And this hurt my chest, because I\nstopped on a small post with wires. There were some wires. And I came out, and the train\nwas far away, and I was running up the train. The train -- there was snow, and I was looking\nwhere would I find my brother. No, but I find two other boys who jumped. One has broken\nhere bone, clavicula (ph) bone, broken. One was moving.\nAnother, his face scratched, but nothing special. So I helped. I took the, the belt. I put like\nhere [showing that he tied the arm to the man\u2019s side], to, to keep the hands not moving. And\nI said, \"We have to run away.\" So we are going under the hill just like small way. There was\nsnow. And we were going to the place that was called Lipowice. Was after Przemysl maybe\nseven kilometers, maybe more. And I went there, and I told them, \"I have here a man.\" And\nnormal, in wintertime of skiing, and I was coming to him to buy tea or coffee or some\ncookies. And I said, \"I will go to him. Maybe he will give us shelter for one night. But then\nhe will think in the morning what he have to do.\" And I went to him, and I knocked on the\nwindow. He opened, and I told him who I am. He was a nice man. He was scared, very,\nbecause he knows what happens. \"Nobody has seen you?\" I said, \"No, no.\" And he gives us\nthe shelter. We were sitting on the bench all night. And he give some to drink, you know,\ncoffee or anything. People drink only water, because we have very high temperature, very.\nThen in the morning we said goodbye. And we said to each other, \"Everybody's going in\ndifferent way. They will not catch us together. Only separate way.\" As a matter of fact, after\nwar I met them. They survive. So I went to my friend, who was working in hospital. And I\nwent to him. I was holding my loaf, bread loaf, under my arm, and I was looking like a\nworking man who's going to work. And when I came to him, he was scared. I told him\nwhat's happened, and he said, \"Ok, I will try to do the best for you.\" And he was keeping me\nin a small cottage, which was his mother's cottage, but she was not in this time at home. So\nhe said, \"Stay here.\" He locked me inside. And I was there all day, and I didn't know what to\ndo. And I was...\"Maybe I can trust him, maybe no. Maybe he can go to Gestapo or\nsomething, and this will be the end.\" But on the evening, he came. Was about eight o'clock.\nHe said, \"Joe, I am sorry. I was going around. I cannot find place for you. I cannot keep you,\nbecause my wife she is scared. We cannot risk our lives. So what you want to do? Tell me. I\nwill bring you in any place.\" He worked in hospital, and he had those carriage with two\nhorses. Always he could travel, because he can ride this. So there was -- on the other side of\nthe Przemysl there was a bridge. So to go to the town where I was living before, we have to\ncross the bridge. But on the bridge, there was always watchmen, German.\nThey were watching who was crossing; they were looking inside you're not smuggling\nsomething. So he said, \"I will risk my life and your life. But you have to lie down under my\nfeet. I will cover you with a blanket. I will keep my feet on your face. And I have the pass, so\nI will try to go. But don't move. We will see. Maybe we'll be lucky.\" And really, we went\nthere. They stopped him. But they know him, and he's showed them the pass. They was\nlooking inside, but they didn't look too much. He was holding the feet on my back. And we\npassed. So they came downtown, close to my street that I was living. He said, \"Joe, good\nluck. That's it. And do what you want.\" I said thank you, and he left. So I didn't know where\nto go. I went back to the place where we were living before. And I went to cellar. There was\nnot basement, only cellar -- open cellars. And I was sitting there, and, and I saw this is not\nrealistic because the people who maybe who lives there know who was living there, they can\ncome back to cellar. They will see me. There was open space. And there's -- in fact there\nwere rats and mice and dirt. So I said, \"Maybe Stefania, maybe she will let me stay for one\nnight.\" And I went upstairs, and I was knocking at her door. And she -- first she asked me, I\ntold her quietly, \"It's me.\" And she opened the door, and she saw me. Now, I was really in\nvery bad condition. And she was very mercy to me with her really soft heart. She was most\ncaring. She helped me to wash and this -- and she gave me her bed to sleep. And her sister,\nshe was wondering what's going on. Because she saw me first, little sister. And she\nexplained her how this, anyway. And the morning, she put me under the bed; and on the\nfront of me, she put a sack with potatoes. She had a sack of potatoes there. So I was behind\nthe sack of the potatoes, and she covered me blanket. She said, \"Don't make noise, because\nthe people are coming -- friends and this -- and they cannot see you.\" So this was for a few\ndays. Then she went to my brother. He worked tn, in a farm which was under supervision of\nmilitary, belonged to the military, and they -- all brothers was going through the military.\nSo my brother was working there with his fianc\u00e9e. And when was the Aktion in the ghetto,\nthey hold the people there because they know they will go back to ghetto, and they will take\nthem. The, the -- no, the SS will take them. But they wanted to save them, because they\nneeded them for work. So they told them stay this night and one day more here. They were\nsleeping there. So my wife, she came. She told him what's happened, and she told him that I\nsurvive. I came, and I'm at her home. He was very happy. And he was crying, also, because\nwe lost the rest of the family. And then his wife, and they was taking them back to ghetto\nunder guard -- I don't know how -- she run away. And she came to us to home...to...to my\nwife's, where I was hiding temporary. No, she said, no, she will not go to ghetto. She doesn't\nlike to go. I didn't like to either go to ghetto, but my brother, he went back to ghetto with the\ngroup. And then he came there. He start to contact with us. And then he told us in the ghetto\nnow is quiet, temporarily is quiet. \"Nothing there, nothing. No Aktion. So you maybe you'll\ncome back.\" After a few days, we went back to ghetto.",
        "A: This was no -- there were a few streets they surrounded with fences. And there was watch,\nlike police. Police watch-- watching men, Polish, and there was German. Was the stationary\nbecause when it was Aktion, it came special group--SS or special military group who was\ntaking the Aktion then or doing this. But when this other, they left to the domestic people to\ntake care about the ghetto. That the people cannot get out, that cannot go in. But my wife\u2019s\nlittle sister. She was going, playing and she was the messenger. She was bringing some\nmessage. We wanted something. We asked her. She would prepare in, in the evening.\nAlways I was under the fence sneaking through the town and I was coming and I took her to\npick up something. No. In the meantime, my brother, he got typhus and his friend got typhus.\nThat was terrible thing, but we need something to -- there was no medicine. Nothing but\nsomething to, to keep them strong, to fight the temperature. So my wife, she prepared a sugar\nor milk or some cheese, butter -- something. And I smuggled this back to ghetto. Some drugs\nlike painkiller drugs, you know, against high fever. This was, she could get without a, a\nprescription. So, like aspirin, you know -- such things like that. So kids, they survive, thanks\nGod. But one time -- I have to tell this story. I was going from ghetto, and, and my watch\nwas 8:30. But the, the curfew was until 9:00. After 9:00, they can catch anybody on the, on\nthe street. They can kill without asking if you have no permission to go on the pavement.\nAnd I had always dressed similar to the dress like the young Hitlerjugend,\u201d they were wear.\nThose high shoes, short tight black pants, and nice coat and a nice hat with a, with a -- with\nthe, with a -- like a, no, like a shaving thing, you know? Like a feather, yes. And I was going\nalways dressed in this. But this time I had an attach\u00e9 case, because I was going to my way to\npick up some food and my watch.\nAnd I changed my dress from my old dress to this dress. I forget to put this -- I\u2019Il show you\nthis false document. And I'm going... There was a bridge from the ghetto, which was going\nto the town, but the, the bridge was going from street to the factory which there was fixing\nbroken cars, trains and everything. So -- but on the side was entrance to ghetto, but this was\nblocked by barbed wires. And was like a road that you cannot go to ghetto. But always I was\ngoing through the holes, and I was going to the bridge down to the town. And when I was\ngoing downstairs to the town already, suddenly a flashlight went to my face. \"Oh,\" I said.\n\"That's it!\" And in German language, somebody said, \"Hande hoch!\"\u00b0 I put my \u201cHande\nhoch,\u201d and the attach\u00e9 case fell down. So he came close. And I said, \"No, this is German\npolice. That's it! They will finish me.\" But I said why. And then came this Polish policeman.\nHe was speaking German. He asked me, \"Who are you? Where are you going?\" I said, \"No,\nI will not tell him that Iam come from ghetto.\" I said, \"I am going from the factory. I worked\nfor my father.\" I said, \"Dinner -- lunch. And I -- dinner -- and I am going back from factory\n\u00b0 Hitler Youth (German).\n\u00b0 \u201cHands up!\u201d (German).\nhome.\" \"Give me your documents.\" And I am looking in pocket, and I don't have my -- they\ncalled the ID card was Kennkarte\u2019 in German, ID card. I was looking. I said, \"I am sorry. I\ndon't have in this dress. But if you like to come with me to the factory, there everybody\nknows me and, and they will tell you who I am.\" And I told, \"I will go with you back.\" Then\nwe will be close to the entrance to the block, entrance to the ghetto. I will give him a blow,\nand I will jump to ghetto. But he was smart. He said, \"No, no. No way! No way!\" I said,\n\"Why?\" He said, \"Maybe you are a spy.\" I said, \"What kind of spy? You are a Polish man,\nand I am a Polish man. And I am a spy for whom? I am spying for Germany?\" He was\nworking for Germany. \"I'm not spying for Germany.\" He said, \u201cDon't touch me.\u201d He start to\nswear to me: \"You such -- out. And you, we're going to Gestapo.\"\nAnd I know if he will go with me, and this is -- he said, \"You know, it is 9:30.\" And I show\nhim my watch, was 8:30. He said, \"Throw your watch under the running train. This is 9:30.\"\nMy watch was not working. And I was late. After curfew, curfew. So he said, \"We are going\nto Gestapo.\" And like this, and I know if he will go on the street at night with this -- with me,\nthe German, you know, police, they are going also patrols. And they will see him holding.\nThey will take me from him, and they will kill me on the spot. So I, I know the psychology\nof the Polish people. I start to talk him: \"Hey, you are a tall guy and I am a little short man.\nAnd you are holding me under gun. What you think, that I will kill you or I will run away?\nYou're supposed to be ashamed! You're a coward.\" Like this. And he said to me, \"You don't\n--\" T said, \"You're a coward.\" So he put his gun here, the rifle. He walked with me like this,\nand we start to talk Polish. I talk to him Polish. So, really, there was going a German patrol,\nbut they look on us and they didn't touch. Because he was a policeman, and I was talking to\nhim Polish. He was talking to me Polish. They didn't understand what we were talking about.\nSo they thought maybe I'm also a, a secret police. So I am going with him.\nSo one thing passed away behind me, and then we are going, there was a street up. And I see\nfrom far away, like maybe two hundred yards, a small light. And there stand a watchman as\nthe Gestapo watchman. That's the Gestapo office. I said, \"This is the end!\" And I talked to\nhim. No, no, no. He is taking me there. I said, \"Listen, if I am a partisan, you know, they are\nwatching you. Your whole family will be killed, and you will be killed. They will put in fire\nyour house. You will not survive.\" I said, \"I don't care. They will kill me, but you will -- \" He\nsaid, \"I don't care. Now this is wartime, and this is my duty.\" And sudden, I don't know,\ncame to my mind something. And I hit him with my right hand. He was taller than me. I hit\nhim once right, and then upper cut his left. He fell down like a piece of wood. I felt I have\nsuch power because this was death -- life or death. And I was so angry. I was said to him,\n\"You dirty pig! You will get what you deserve! I could kill you right now,\" I said, \"but I will\nnot do this. I will not make my hands dirty.\" And I turn around and I was going on the hill\n\"ID card (German).\nthe street down. I was not running. And then, in the last minute, I start to run away. And I\ncame to my wife at night. I was out after 10:00, and she was, \"What's happen?\" And I told\nher the story. And I was all night staying there. And next morning, I told her, \"Go look on\nthe street. Watch what's happen.\" She went. She came, said, \"Nothing. No nothing, and\nnobody.\" I don't know. You know, quiet. And in the evening, I was going back to ghetto.\nAnd when I was jumping through the bridge, I heard shooting -- [Imitating shooting sound].\nAnd I went myself, and then I saw, look what's happen. There are another like SS man or\nmaybe not SS man, but he was a secret police. There was lying a woman he took from the\ntrain. A woman, he was taking off her shoes. She was still alive, and he was taking off her\nshoes. He killed her because he felt she was a Jewish person. They found her. Anyway, I\nwent to ghetto. And I came to there, and I was there for a while.\nThen her sister always was with her and counting, and I came back. I talked to my wife was\nyet to find a place to hide, because in this place we cannot stay. I said, \"I have to come with\nmy brother, with his fianc\u00e9e, and my friend and his daughter. Would be about five to seven\npeople.\" And so we organized. She's under -- \"The beginning,\" she said, \"1t will be very\nhard.\" So I said, \"Listen. We have to do this.\" So she was looking, and she find on the hill is\nlike a side street on the border of the town. The name of Tatarska (ph) Street. And this was\nlike a nice small cottage. And I came with her once there before she made the arrangement.\nAnd I said, \"This is perfect for this purpose.\" So she make the whole thing legal. She says\nshe make -- she get the papers. And when she moved there, I came there with my friend.\nAnd first we were looking around; and I think, \"We have to make a bunker.\" So under her\nbed, I cut a piece of floor. We start to digging hole. We were digging, and she was taking in\nthe evening in a sack this ground. And there was some trees, and between them she was\nputting the, the, you know, the soil, so nobody would see the soil. And we make such in that\ntwo could stay there. The attic was too open. And there was like a ladder from the hole.\nThere was a hole between attic. So I was thinking, \"Later.\" But for first thing, I said, \"Instead\nof sit in the open attic, maybe we will be there.\" But then came the father of, the father of the\ngirl, and, and came another, my friend. So was a little more people. And I...I don't know\nwhat to do. I said, \"Now we have to go upstairs because we cannot be in the hole.\" So we\nare, we are sitting in the open attic. And then I told to my wife, \"Look, maybe we will find\nan old wood, something that we can call and make a first row similar to this round wood.\u201d\nThis would be nothing new. And I said, \"We will make a false wall, do something.\" Was\nvery difficult. She was running around many places, and then she find somebody. And they\nbrought her this, and she said she like to have this for wintertime for, for fire. So they left\nthis. And she brought this little by little inside. The neighbors was asking, \"What?\" She said,\n\"No, for I like to cut this and cut for wintertime.\" So was not for -- not I wanted. Then when\nshe brought the -- we measured everything. We cut it by little and we make numbers that\neverything will fit. Then we have to nail this. There will be noise. So I advised my wife\nmake washing, laundry -- everything. And ask them if they have ropes and nails, that you\nwill put them 1n attic, you will hang them and they will dry. The, the, you know, the washed\nlaundry. So that. So they did, and this time, instead of putting nails and put, you know, the\nropes, we know they, they were fast. Then we put a little also outside, and if you put\neverything there, there will be not now, they will be exact like 1s dirt and, and from the\nspiders. The -- took from our place they put another place. Was look exactly like old thing.\nAnd this the, the attic was shut in maybe like two yards. I make sure of it. And I make, make\nthe roof was going on an angle, so I make a small door, so that I can every time open, watch\nand close right away if somebody will come. And I was this what I have my curved spine.\nAnd that's because almost two weeks I was laying like this, because I was watching always if\nsomebody not come. And it's hard to know. We were there. It was very fine. And then the\npeople that come, little by little, from ghetto-- then my brother and his wife, they came, the\nlast ones. But so other people, they came little by little. There was story how they were\ncoming. But my wife, I think she thought about it. So anyway, we were all 13 there..\nNow we have to organize food and organize the regime control that we do not do something\nwhich can be dangerous to our life. So I make like the [indecipherable]. Every two hours\nsomebody sitting watching. They will be not snoring at night. So we have a stick with a\nrabbit, this was from a rabbit like with the tail. And I told them if somebody was snoring,\nyou go to your nose to wake up. But don't make noise. Because you have to be, perhaps\nsomebody will wake you up and try to sleep on the stomach. Everybody on the stomach, not\non the back because you will snore. That was dangerous, number one. Number two, no\nsmoking. The people, they want to smoke. They were smoking anything. I said, \"No\nsmoking, because the, the smoke will go to the place within the, the wall, or they can see at\nnight light through, or can be a fire. We don't need this.\u201d So there was really a fight to\nconvince the people that this is tragedy. This is not for us. Then one, the woman who came\nwith her two children, she got typhus there. And she, she was infected in ghetto, but after a\nfew days, after a week, the typhus develop. And she had high fever, temperature. She was\ntalking. So I was the one who was taking care of her. I said nobody could come close to her.\nSo it was really tough, because there was not too much space, but she was -- I was watching\nher. I shave her hair, and I said to my wife, \"Do anything what you wanted to get\nsomething.\" Because after experience with my brother in ghetto, to keep her going. And she\nwas trying to buy for her sugar and something, and aspirin and this and this. And anyway, I,\nI make also a prescription for heart, you know, some medicine to keep, make the heart going.\nAnd she went to pharmacy. And I said, \"Maybe, we ok. Maybe, no.\" And she made it.\n.\nI don't know how. She got started. It was another story, but a lot -- she made it, she got it, she\ncame. Anyway, the children were prepared if she, God forbidding, passed away, that we in\nthe hole will make a, we will make a hole, a grave. We will put her temporary there. Because\nwe had to be prepared for everything, I told them. But anyway, she survived, was Ok. Then I\nconvinced the people stop smoking, and about snoring. Then was problem with, with food,\nbecause this woman she wanted special, special food all the time. But something was very\ndifficult to get. This was not so easy. Was tough time. But we were sitting. Was many, many\nstories, like my wife told you. They came, they gave her two hours to move out. We asked\nher to run away, to save her life and her sister. \"No,\" she said no. And she was staying, and\nshe survived. Then came the German. They came, they have two nurses -- there were two\nnurse and their two boyfriends. And they was almost everyday sleeping there. So we were\nabove them. And sometimes there was little noise, because they can hear. And I was feeling\nthat this is very dangerous. They are there. And one time, like my wife told, they came. They\nwas holding my wife, and one nurse also was with them and one was running. There was\nlike not stairs, only there was like no...",
        "A: Ladder. And...and no -- you can hear the noise if somebody stepping on the -- so I was\nhearing something. And I closed the door. And suddenly came one of the nurse. She was\nlooking around, going around looking, not quiet. Was the last moment. And she went down,\nand she told them no. So my wife, she saw what's going on. Then she bought chicken, and\nshe was holding the chicken in, in the hole, and the chicken was making noise. Something to,\nyou know, to mask the noise. And this was what we're doing to, to try to, you know, to\ncamouflage everything. Then about food. Her little sister, she was coming bringing\nsomething bread. I have always there a few loaves of bread, which changing I make some\nmess, like a nest; and there was exchanging every time fresh and they all using what we were\neating. And to not make suspicious the, the neighbor, so she says, \u201cShe is bringing bread and\nshe is selling bread.\u201d And always was going in this way, that they couldn't count how it is.\nWhat was hiding. And she never was talking to people. She could play with little children,\nand never -- she never said a word about us. And one time, they came. My wife, she didn't\ncome to work. And there was another, she has to work. So she was -- a few days she didn't\ncome because she was feeling sick. She didn't feel good. And I see through the window --\nbecause always we were watching to see if someone could see a policeman is coming -- a\nPolish policeman and a German policeman is coming. So I told her, \"Go with us to the, to\nthe\" I said, \"to the bunker. Hide. And they will only your little sister.\n.\nShe will tell them that you went to buy some food, you know, in the village, something.\"\nAnd they knocked on the door, and she opened. They came. \"Where's your sister? Who are\nyou, your sister? Where's your sister?\" Said, \"She went to the village to...to buy some food.\"\nThe policeman, he turned and slapped her in the face. She fell down. And he said, \"Why are\nyou lying? Your neighbor, they told us that she was just now out here in the yard.\" And she\nstart stutter \"Why I, I have to lie? She went -- she has to go through the yard. So she was in\nthe yard, and she went to, to the village. How she can go to, to the village. She has to go\nthrough the yard, so maybe they saw her.\" She talk to them. I, I don't know. She told she told\nthem that she's going to, to buy food, and they look and they start to look around. She didn't\nhave nothing there. A piece of bread and a little soup. Nothing. He said, \"That's all you\nhave?\" \"Yes.\" \"You're alone at home?\" She said, \"Yes.\" \"You sleep alone?\" \"Yes.\" \"You're\nnot afraid?\" She said, \"Why I have to be afraid?\" \"That's what you are eating?\" And she said,\n\"Yes.\" They left her, and she didn't say nothing. And they left her, and, and my wife was\nhiding, and she came out. That was one episode. There was many, many episodes during the\ntime. There was almost two years. Every day, each hour was something that our life was\nthreatened with gun. At the end, when our -- one thing was good. They have a radio, the\nGerman. And they was listening to the news, and I was listening to the news. And we can,\nthey are listening to us we can thinking how they are going back. They're running away. And\nI said to my wife, \"Soon or later, very soon, you will have your Russian. Because they give\nthem hell, and they ran.\" And all my -- almost I find the day when they will come. And I\nremember the last day when we heard there was fighting. And we can hear the noise of the\ndifferent noise of different bullet, different rifles.\nThe Russians have different rifles, and the German have different rifles. We heard the\ndifference in the noise. So I said to my wife, \"Probably they will come, but they are\nfighting.\" We cannot go down, and we have to stay in the attic. But the bullets and ding,\nding, ding, you know, was hitting. I said to my all people there, \"Listen, we have to lie down.\nKeep something between your teeth. If somebody -- they will hit somebody, you cannot\nscream. If somebody will be dead, he will be dead. This is our last chance. But if they find\nus, if somebody will scream, she will be killed and her sister will be killed. And we will be\nkilled. Because everybody now look for each other. So you have to be prepared that\nsomething will happen no worse, nothing.\" And we are lying down and listening, and she\nwent down with her sister. She went down, and with the neighbors was waiting. And\nanyway, we under-- we can hear the bullet. Some start to be more close, and some start to go\naway. And I said, \"I think probably the Russian are coming. Because listen to the Russian\nsound of the bullets, the noise. But we will see.\" Then early in the morning, by six or seven\no'clock in the morning, I look through the small thing. They are going about six German\nsoldiers with rifles, the helmets. All came back going on the street up. I said, \"My God, still,\nstill there are Germans here.\" And suddenly it came out a few boys with the armbands and a\nfew soldiers, Russian soldiers and to them, \u201cHands up!\u201d And they fell down, and they were\nbegging. I said, \"Thanks God, we are free!\" And that's it. Next day, this what happened -- or\nthe same day. I don't remember. Came two Russian, White Russian. One was the lieutenant\nand one was a sergeant. And they came. She was in the window singing, and this happened.\nAnd they came, and first they asked, \"Is Germans here?\" She said, \"No, there are no\nGermans here.\" \"Can we come?\" And said, \"Ok.\" They came inside. And my wife, she\nclosed the windows; and they start to talk this and this and not so. My wife asked them\nalways, \"How far are Germans? Maybe they can come back.\" They was suspicious.\n\"What?,\" they asking. \"What?\" \"Because,\" she said, \"there was one time that he went back,\nthe Germans came back. So this is what I'm asking.\" He said, \"Don't worry. They are chasing\nthem. They are running away. They are loosing their pants, pants.\" And they said, \"They are\nrunning away. They will never come back here.\" And we heard. We were standing behind\nthe doors, but we heard this. And we came and sat. But look, we couldn't talk, because we\ndidn't talk, only were whispering for almost two years. We couldn't walk, because there was\nnot walking up and down, just not exercise. We were pale, you know, and terrible. And they\npicked up their rifles. \"Who there?\" They thought maybe partisans. So she told them. And\none of them was a Jewish lieutenant and his family was from Ukraine killed by Germans.\nAnd he -- and his sergeant, he was a regular Russian. He said, \"My, my goal is to chase the\nGerman and give them back what they did to my family, to my family.\" He was crying. He\nwas kissing us, hugging. He said to my wife, \"You are really hero! You are really hero!\nWithout weapons, without nothing, you could fight so many as 1n the little girl, the sister.\"\nThey took pictures, and said, \"What you need? We will give you what you need.\" He said,\n\"We have the German hospital here, there, there. The whole thing there. Loaded with\neverything. What you -- dresses, shoes maybe. And we will bring you meat.\" And we said,\n\"No, no. Not now. We would like to have freedom.\" And how we did it, because we were\nafraid about neighbors still. So we told them that -- it was night, we will go, the men, with\nthem back to hospital. And next day, they will bring us, we will come back like guerrillas\nwho are coming to, you know, with the army. And we will look for my wife. I will ask the\nneighbors about her. We will come like guests. We came. We survived; we will hug her, we\nwill kiss her. So they will not suspect that it was us she was hiding people. They said, \"That's\na good idea.\" And we went, and the women and children were still with my wife there. Next\nday, in the morning, we came with them. There was a wagon with horses and everything was\nthere. We had rifles with us. And I came, and I am looking; and I asked one neighbor. I\nknow them, because when I saw them, I said, \"Hey, do you know if still around a...a girl?\nHer name is Podgorska, Stefania Podgorska. She's my friend, my, my neighbor. I have to\nseek her.\" She said, 'Why, yeah, yeah, yeah. She 1s a good girl. She's...she's...\" They thought\nmaybe we would kill her. Because some people came to take advantage, maybe somebody\nthat paid them or hanged them. Said, \"No, no. She is my good friend. She's -- I'd like to see\nher.\" She said, \"Well, she lives there.\" We were going there. We knocked on the door. She\ncame: \"Ahhh! Hi. Hi.\" And we were greeting each other. And there was beautiful thing what\nshe did. They -- we start to give to her some food, bring everything. And we lived --",
        "A: In town, to find an apartment to live. And next day, I find apartment. Was occupied by\nGerman, some people. German, and they run away. They left everything they had.\nEverything was there. So I moved to the apartment. And I took the apartment. And then I\nhad -- twice they came because there was some band of people who were killing people who\nsaved Jewish life and, and the survivors. They killed them. They said, \"One bullet for the\nsurvivor, two bullets for this who saved them -- for them who saved them.\" And they was\ngoing around, but after a while they caught them. They came twice to my apartment. I was\nliving with my brother, his fianc\u00e9e, my wife, her sister; and we lived there. And they came.\nThat was on the second floor, and there was a balcony outside. There was knocking on the\ndoor. So it was night, was like in winter, in February. And they said -- I said, \"Who are\nthere?\" And they said, \"Mailice! Milice!\u00ae Open!\" I said, \"What are you looking for?\" \"You\nhave to go with us to, to work. We have to fix the bridge. Is broken bridge.\" I said, \"No, I'm\nnot going at night with nobody. You have some business to me, well, come in the morning\nwhen it's lighter.\" People. I will see who's who. They start to swear to me. \"Open the door, or\nwe will break the door!\" Like this, like this. I saw who were there. I run on the balcony. I\nwas screaming for help, help -- and they start to run away. This was number one. And then a\nfew months later, another time they came. So the commandant of the city -- there was a\nRussian commandant. And I went to him, and he told me, \"Listen, you will never survive\nhere.\"",
        "A: Yes, I left. He said, \"Go to another part of Poland, where nobody will know you. Nobody.\nChange your name from the Pol -- Jewish name or German name to the Polish name.\" And\nwe did. \"Under new name, go and stay in another place of Poland where nobody knows you.\nMaybe you will survive.\" But the best thing that I will tell, if I don't tell you this in secret. I\nran away from him. This no place for me to live. We want to survive. \"Go west in the\ncountry. West, if you can.\" And this happened. I went to Krakow. I changed my name. And\nthen I went to Wroclaw. I was studying. I was accepted there. Again, I studied from\nbeginning my dentistry. I graduated. I was working. I was assistant, and until I left Poland;\nand now I am here, thanks God. And I am very happy I am in the United States. I went here\nto Tufts University. I graduated, and I am a dentist. Thanks God.",
        "A: When I was hiding, I was drawing. This was the old man who passed away after war, a\nfew years after war. This is a woman and mother of two children. This is her son. And\nthis is my brother's fianc\u00e9e, and this time. No, excuse me. This is the wife of my friend,\nwho -- she was survived, my wife, she saved her life and her husband. He passed away\nin, in Jerusalem, I think so. Israel. He was a dentist. Then, here we have what? That is my\nbrother\u2019s wife. This was his fianc\u00e9. And this is a father, he\u2019s a dentist still in Poland. He\n* Militia (French, but adopted into many languages).\nwas with his daughter. We saved him and his daughter. And I was drawing at this time\nthe faces.",
