        "EMANUEL TANAY\nFebruary 24, 1992\nBeep.\nWe're starting now. Can you talk about how things changed with the coming of the Nazis, and talk\nabout the suddenness and the gradualness sort of mixed together, and how people were, didn't\nrealize what was going on.\nWe immediately at the end of the hostilities, uh, there was a return to relatively normal life in the\nlittle town of Meyerhof, where I lived in, in Poland, but then, gradually there was a, an increase in\nthe persecution by, by the Germans. First the military left and the SS came and then with the SS\ncame the uh the Ukrainians and the Lithuanians, who really were rather cruel towards the Jews. So\nthere was an ever-increasing intensity of persecution. Then, establishment of the ghetto, uh, and\nultimately the uh deportations or whatever are the term one wants to use. I think the term\ndeportation is a bit misleading.\nLet's cut because is that the answer you think?\nYes.\nWait till he gets slated.\nBeep.\nAt the end of the hostilities, that is when Poland was defeated, life came to relatively uh normal\ntype of situation in the little town of Veerhoff where I lived. Uh, but then there was a ever-\nincreasing intensity of persecution. First of all, the, the military left. The Wehrmacht, the, who\nwere relatively uh non- uh punitive towards Jews or for that matter anyone. Uh, then comes the\ncivil administration, the German administration, the SS, and with them come the uh, they hire the\nguns so to say the, uh, the Lithuanians and the Ukrainians, who were really very vicious and cruel\ntowards the Jews particularly. Uh, then ghetto is formed, and once and first the ghetto, there are\nvery inhuman conditions uh through enough, but one can still go back and forth. But, the main\npoint is that there is a slow increase in the, uh, in the nature of persecution, that there is a kind of a,\nuh, things are not all that bad. It's quite possible to survive. Uh, and after all, all along, we hope\nthat those big powers, France, England, United States, any moment, they're going to come uh, into\nreal war, and quickly defeat Germany. So, all along, there is the notion, we can somehow make it,\nand when the uh, you know, when the deportations, or as we called them, Ausedlung, or Actions,\nAction in German, uh come, uh then generally it is really too late to do anything.\nWere people, once those things started, tell me what those things were, and once things started, did\npeople know what was going on in the ghetto.\nNo, we uh, my, was a shock to me that when I looked into it, once I was in United States, that a",
        "reader of the New York Times knew a great deal more, and I have copies of those, uhhhh,\nnewspapers, than we did, who were there! Because we had no way of communicating with each\nother. Uh, in fact, in our little town, the community hired a Pole to follow the trains, so that we\nknow where the trains are going, because we didn't. And he lost track. You know, he couldn't\nfollow it, and we didn't know. That's a absolute fact that we did not know what was going on uh,\nuntil it, until after the war really. Now, somebody got the, you know, there are some people I have\nuh examined a lot of uh survivors who didn't know when they arrived in Auschwitz what was going\non. So, there was a general lack of knowledge.\nCan you talk about different conditions in Eastern and Western Europe, and also how readily\nrecognizable Jews were.\nFor a Jew in Poland to hide was generally, virtually impossible, to hide by I mean, I mean, to adopt\na non-Jewish identity, I don't mean hiding in some closet. Uh, to be on false papers, because Jews\ntalked differently, they had clear cut accent, Jewish accent, they looked differently, Poland is a\nhomogeneous society uh where uh there are no outsiders. Americans uh are used to Italians and\nSpaniards and uh Norwegians. You don't have that in Poland. It's a homogeneous society. Uh,\nJews were the only, generally, the only outsiders. They spoke differently, they behaved differently,\nand they looked differently. And last not least, if they were males, they were circumcised. The\nonly men who were circumcised were Jews. So, if you had any doubts about a male's identity, all\nyou had to do is drop his pants and you knew he was a Jew.\nAnd how was that different from other parts of Europe?\nIn other parts of Europe, the Jews were different because the Jews were assimilated. In Poland,\nthey assimilated group of Jews with uh a min--tiny minority. Uh, in Germany, majority of Jews\nwere indistinguishable from the Germans. It took all kind of research to determine that somebody\nwas a Jew. There were lots of uh German Jews who just found out thanks to Hitler that they were\nJews. You didn't have that kind of quote unquote \"problem\" in Poland. You knew you were a Jew.\nPoles around you made it clear to you that you were a Jew, so there was no doubt about it. So\nJews were assimilated in, in other parts of, of Europe. The other, the level of antisemitism was\nentirely different. Even in Germany. The Germans who, after all are responsible for the genocide\nof the Jews, were certainly not as antisemitic as Poles. I don't think anyone would argue that. So,\nthat's another factor. But the Germans behaved differently. I challenge anyone to say that the\nGermans were the same in Poland as they were in France. The same troops, I don't mean that they\nwere physically different. You take a SS unit, and you station the SS unit in Krakow, and you\ntransfer it them to Par-to Paris or Amsterdam, and they are different, because they are among\nhumans. In Poland, they were not among humans, but a-among barbarians. Their contempt for\nPoles was just a little bit less than for Jews. I mean, Jews were non-human, poles were sub-human.",
        "And, so they could behave without any kind of restraint, towards the Jews and towards the Poles.\nIn Denmark, a Danish citizen, annoyed with how the Germans behave, spit into the face of an SS\nman, and got a 30 day suspended sentence. In Poland you get a bullet between your eyes on the\nspot. It was a different world. The Germans behaved differently in Poland than in Western\nEurope.\nWhat were deportations, and what did people think they were. It was announced from time to time",
        "that there would be a deportation, that people would go to work in the east. Now remember, the\neast was someplace out in Russia, uh, it was as far removed as if somebody told you that you're\ngoing to travel to outer space. Well, you'd probably know more about outer space now than we did\nknow what's out there in, in Russia. And, the assumption, at least they said, you go there to work.\nAnd they directed to bring certain implements with you, and food and whatever. It would vary from\nlocality to locality. So, there was a kind of a feeling of anxiety and they unknown, there's\nsomething terrible happening, but it was not clear, there was no clear cut knowledge as to what was\nthe purpose of it, and after all, as all human beings, uh, the Jews of Poland did engage in some\ndenial. I mean, one wanted to be hopeful, and again, it's very difficult to conceptualize, to think of\nsomething that is unthinkable. How do you imagine the unthinkable. Now we know, but then we\ndidn't. It was just inconceivable to us, that something that terrible could be happening. It was true\nin my family. My father who was educated in Vienna, and who spoke fluently German um was\nmuch more reluctant to...\nWe have to stop, we just ran out. We have to reload.\nBeep.\nOkay, you were talking about how difficult it was to realize what was going on, and you had just\nstarted about your father, so why don't you pick it up there.\nMy father was educated, at least in part, in Vienna, spoke fluently German, and was really sort of\nfamiliar with the German culture, and that in a way, was his downfall because he just could not\nbelieve uh that Germans would engage in something so barbaric, whereas my mother was\nresponding more to uh to sort of clues that came from the environment, became very anxious,\nbordering on sort of almost irrational in her anxiety. She was just roaming around asking uh, uh\neven strangers could they somehow help, you know in terms of doing something for uh, like for\nme, and my mother was indeed the one who was responsible for securing for me the place in the\nmonastery through a woman that she barely knew, uh was a woman who was selling sweets uh in\nour town and my mother spoke to her and somehow through that uh established on a very short\nnotice uh my ability to, to leave and go to the monastery.\nOkay, I want to back up and ask you to define for me again as though I don't, I don't know what a\nghetto is. I don't know about the formation of the ghetto.\nWell, one day, there came an announcement that there would be a Jewish quarters, which has come\nto be known as the ghetto, but they, the Germans call it the Jewish quarters essentially in in\nGerman, and uh it gave you a perimeters where Jews could live, which was a tiny portion of the\ntown, and I'm speaking of the town where I lived, but it was similarly true in other towns, and uh,\nthe Poles who lived in that area had to evacuate, but that wasn't a problem because there was the\narea that the Jews left was a much wider one so who, whatever a Pole was displaced from the\nJewish designated area for Jews, they got much better quarters anyway, but not the other way\naround, uh, in terms of the, the Jews moved in few families into one room, two families. Maybe\none family in one room in the beginning, because the ghetto, they have the Jewish area, the Jewish\npart of town, would become smaller and smaller and smaller, but at first 1t was open, so you could\nget in and out in certain hours. For example, there were uh a Jew could not be in the street after 7",
        "o\u2019clock. But at other times, you could get out and mingle, be outside. One day there was an\nannouncement, the ghetto is closed, and there were gates, there were walls -------------- and you\ncouldn't get out, so you see there was this ever-increasing uh level of persecution. I think that is the\ncritical issue both in terms of ghetto, in terms of what, what happens in the ghetto, even when they\nclosed the ghetto there was still enough food somehow brought in, but then suddenly there 1s less\nfood. Suddenly the ghetto is being made smaller instead of there being forced blocks. Now there\nare only 2 blocks.\nYou talked about what things were punishable by death in the ghetto. What kinds of things were--\nwhat were the punishments? What was against the law?\nVirtually everything that was contrary to the, uh, not the law, because there was no law, but\ncontrary to a kind of an order given by the local German uh administration, was punishable by\ndeath. So, for example, uh, going after the time that was forbidden for Jews, let's say after 8 o\nclock, or after 7 0 clock at one point, was punishable by death. Not wearing your armband was\npunishable by death. Getting outside of ghetto was punishable by death. Having white bread, I\nmean that is a fact, where that I know of someone who got shot on the spot, and I hope I can tell it\nwithout reacting as I often do, uh, that that person got shot. (Crying, long pause). That always\ngives me trouble.\nTell me what it was like to live on areas -----------------, and tell me why you were able to do that.\nWhat special things made it so you were able to?\n(Long pause) Well, my parents, unlike virtually um all of the Jews in our, in our town, that varied\nfrom town to town were assimilated, that 1s they spoke very well polish, and were generally\nindistinguishable from the rest of the population, and certainly that applied to me as a, as a\nyoungster, so I could pretend that I was not a Jew, uh with some difficulty. Obviously at first when\nI came to the monastery, my familiarity with prayers, my familiarity with uh catholic uh liturgy,\nand so was limited but I had some so I could, I could uh, uh pretend. Most Jews, or most boys my\nage would not be able to do that uh, in Poland that is. So, that accounts for my uh ability to live on\nfalse papers, but that was the only, that was the beginning. Uh, I would, one also had to have great\ndeal, I can say it now in retrospect without having to be falsely modest, it required resourcefulness,\ncourage, and an ability to sort of adapt to circumstances and perceive, you know, you looked at\nanother person, and you knew that that person had a look in his or her eyes, is he a Jew? And then\nyou had to take some action. Say something. I would, for example, if I was on a street car, and,\nand, and a person had a look like, ah, that kid might be a Jew, I would go to that person, and ask\nsomething, or maybe make some kind of a comment, and a fairly aggressive comment, and maybe,\nlike you know in a train I would say, \"Would you move your suitcase,\" or something like that, and\nthat would right away dispel that person's suspicion, because first of all my language would be\nclear, so that most likely he's not a Jew, and my behavior would be then different, so you see it\nwasn't only the language, the appearance, but also the behavior. There was in Poland a kind of a\nexpression that they could recognize a Jew by sadness in his or her eyes or false papers. Now\nremember that there was generally fear of having a Jew live somewhere nearby because you could\nget punished for it, and great many people also were antisemitic, and approved of the persecution\nof Jews. That is quite inconceivable to many Poles nowadays, the new Polish uh generation, young\npeople find this offensive when one mentions that it was perfectly acceptable in Poland during",
        "World War Two to see Jews tormented because it is not acceptable now.\nI only have a little bit left, I'm trying to think of something short. Tell me what were liquidations in\nthe ghetto?\nLiquidation was a term that we used, meaning that the ghetto would be closed, that there would be\nnot, see one never knew, is this the final type of uh deportation or would they permit or some\npeople remain. See as, as a ghetto was being, as the deportation would start, people would have\ncertain papers that allowed them to stay, there were certain, there was a hierarchy, okay? You\nworked in this place, you worked in that place, those papers were good, these ones were not, and\none never knew for sure, well, is this the final liquidation of that particular ghetto in this locality or\nnot? So, you could only for sure tell in retrospect. There were small, see they, the procedure that\nthey followed that we didn't know about, they always concentrated, they closed the smaller ghettos.\nThen they made the bigger ghettos. Ultimately there was, for example in the, in the county where\nI lived, there were number of Jewish communities...\nWe just ran out. We have to reload.\nWell, just do whatever--\nBeep.\nSometime in 1942, probably early in summer of 42 it became pretty apparent that there would be a\nfinal liquidation of the ghetto, and my mother became very anxious and just talked to anyone she\ncould to create some type of a setting where she and my sister, and I, I was 14 years old at the time,\nnot quite 14, uh, and my mother did, through an acquaintance, arrange for a man named\nGodumsky, to come, she lived in Chanstohova?? to come to Mierhow, and take me to the\nmonastery of Mogilla. Now you have to keep in mind that there was no way of communicating,\nand one couldn't trust, there were some phones, but one couldn't really communicate. This, this\nlady contacted Mr. Godumsky, who didn't quite know what she wanted from him, so he came, and\nbecause we anticipated that the ghetto would be liquidated the next day, my mother left me with\nthis lady, and I stayed there. The many came and he did agree to take me to the monastery, but\nobviously he didn't know if the monastery would accept me. And it so happened that that very day\nindeed, as he and I were going to the train station, there was the final liquidation of the ghetto, and\nas I walked with him, Jews were being driven in the streets to the trains, and I bought a ticket, uh, I\nhad uh a false document, but he didn't, I didn\u2019t have to show it, and he and I didn't go together. Mr.\nGodumsky and I didn't go together, because if they caught me, he would be also uh punished. So,\nwe got on a train, and we took the train to Krakow, which was what uh, maybe just 40 miles I think\nit's 60 - 70 kilometers from Mierhoff and then from the train station, we had to walk to the\nmonastery, which was quite a distance at the time, and while I waited outside, he went and talked\nto the prior, whom he told a lie, mainly that I was a converted Jew, that my family was not really\nJews, but converted Jews, and the prior agreed to accept me into the seminary, into the novitiate,\nand I at that point became a student so to say, for priesthood, and I uh lived there, again, I can't be\ncertain for how long, uh because when I start add up all various experiences, and add the amount of\ntime they lasted, I end up with ten years, and the war was 5 years, so but I, I assume I was there\nmore than a year, and I remained in a monastery until the day that I perceived one day that a priest",
        "who was my teacher of catechism who I knew quite well somehow suspected that I was a Jew, and\nthe way he tipped me off that I was at first not even aware of it, was that he corrected my Polish\npronunciation, and when, and I knew that was a mistake, and he did it with a certain smirk on his\nface, and that night I was so anxious about it, and Mr. Godumsky, who was a , who used to be a\nmonk, but now was in a monastery as a worker, he did uh, I told him what my feelings were, and I\ndid hide in the organ that night. And that night, the Gestapo came and broke into my, we call them\ncells, but they were nice little rooms, the monastery was beautiful and rich and uh really beautiful\nplace, they broke in, broke the door down, and didn't find me, and then Mr. Godumsky came where\nI was hidden, and we sneaked out, and went to another uh place where he had a friend, uh, whose\nnames was Yagoginsky, with whom I communicated great deal to the present time, uh, who has\nthen taken over and helped me afterwards.\nTell me about some of your experiences that, in your time at the monastery.\nThe monastery was really a, an experience where, where there were good things too, you know, uh,\nbelieve it or not, (laughs), my first sexual experience occurred in the monastery, not in the\nmonastery grounds, but in the, just outside, because there were girls there from nearby who were\nquite interested in the boys from the monastery, uh, there were constant fear, however, of being\nrecognized as a Jew. Uh, one day I, because I was nearsighted, um, I went to Krakow, and\nacquired glasses. As soon as I came in, one of my fellow seminarians looked at me and said,\n\"Yanuk,\" that was my, my name, which was sort of a diminutive of John, uh said, \"Oh, you look\nlike a Jew!\" And there was the last time I wore those glasses. Uh, there were many experiences\nthat were close calls. For example one time I'm, one of my functions was to pick up the mail from\nthe post office, and so I was known to everyone and they, at that time it was a village, today it's that\npart, that village is part of the town of Krakow, but at that time it was the village of Mogilla, and\neverybody knew me, and they were marching a group of Jews through the village to work at the\nnearby uhhhh military, German military establishment, and one of the fellows was somebody who\nknew me, and yelled out my name, and you know, I, I mean just unthinkingly he just yelled out and\nother people looked like what, what is it. So, you know, there were situation like that. Uh, Mogilla\nwasn't all that far from our town, uh and sometimes I encountered people who knew me from\nPromiehov. Uh, so there were many, many situations, which were quite dangerous and uh quite\naction...\nTell me about the time when the head of the monastery sprinkled you incessantly with holy water.\nThe Father Kuhar, who was the Prior, was a really a, a wonderful person, he was, uh, at least to my\nrecollection, he uh maybe was six foot or six foot three, and very heavy set. He was not uh from\nPoland, he was from Yugoslavia, and he was a, a very benevolent person. I remember one time I\nwas serving mass, you know, uh, I mean, I was, you know the , uh the boy who, I can't even\ndescribe it in English even though my English is relatively well, but those, the Catholic\nterminology 1s still Polish in my mind, and uh, he sprinkled me excessively uh with the holy water,\nand later on, I, I and I could see a twinkle in his eye, and uh later I ask him about it, and he\nsaid,with a smile, uh, in German, he said, \"Zieher, zicher,\" which means, \"Certain 1s certain,\"\nwhich was his way of now, of telling me \"I know it was a lie that you are baptized, but it doesn't\nmatter.\"",
        "We have time for one more little short story in the monastery. Have you got anything--\nYou know, Father Kuvar was a benevolent person, who helped me, who helped my mother. Well,\nmy mother had black hair, black hair meant you were a Jew, my mother was on false papers, and\nwe had to make sure that her hair was changed to sort of more blondish look, and that required\ntransporting her from a hiding place in Krakow, and you know, bleaching your hair was not as\nsimple as nowadays, and uh, I spoke to him about it, and what he arranged, now he had a big\ncarriage with 2 horses, and so on, he arranged for it, he picked up my mother, I mean with a driver\nyou know, and took her to this place in Krakow where her hair was changed.\n------------------Camera roll 4 just went up; Sync take 5 is up.\nWhen we do this, but wait till he---------\nYes...this is not going to be a commercial for Perrier?\nBeep.\nOkay, go ahead.\nI, this particular priest, who recognized at least claimed that he recognized some kind of a speech\nuh impediment or accent that was Jewish I believed, I was very sensitive, uh suspicious of him\nbecause I have on more than one occasion during a sermon heard him make antisemitic uh\ncomments. Uh, for example, one time he was ---------- the congregation for the fact that they were\ndoing business on Sunday, which was forbidden in Poland, anyway Poland was a strictly Catholic\ncountry, but people were doing it, selling, buying things, and he was saying \"At one time, Jews\nwere doing that, but thank God we got rid of them.\" Now, there was part of a sermon, so I uh, I\nknew how antisemitic he was.\nTell me now in general about this monastery, and all kinds of, all the kinds of things they were\ninvolved in from resistance to uh...\nThey\nAnd what happened to the head of the monastery too.\nThe Mogilla Monastery is uh is ------------ Monastery. It was a, a very, it was established in uh the\nbeginning of the 13th Century. It was beautiful. It was rich. It was a place of great scholarship. It\nalso was a place where number of people who were in the resistance, in the Polish underground\nresistance, were uh, hiding under number of uh of pretexts, as workers, as priests, etc. and uh when\nI escaped there after they came to get me, uh later on I didn't know that Father Kuhar, the Prior, a\nnumber of others, were taken to Auschwitz, and in fact, for a long time, I thought that it was\nbecause of me. It turned it didn't have nothing to do with me. Uh, the uh, the Germans came and\ntook the Prior and every tenth priest, and took them to Auschwitz, and then uh uh, Father Kuhar\nwas transferred to another uh concentration camp. He did survive, uh after the war, and uh, in fact,\nI visited the monastery, uh, there is a, I brought a, a plaque, uh commemorating him. Uh, that is uh\naffixed in a very sort of a prominent place in the monastery, it's in Polish and in English, and I did",
        "establish an organization uh that uh, it's called the American Friends of Mogilla Monastery to\nexpress my gratitude.\nWhen you lived there, what was your rela--what were your duties, and what was your relationship\nwith him?\nI was sort of like you would call a, an adjutant or whatever, you know, or his personal assistant. He\ntrusted me particularly, uh, more than others. For example, he would give me the key to empty the\ncollection boxes. And the was a big large church, and people would put money into the collection\nboxes, and in fact, to my best recollection, I was the only one that he trusted to just go in there and\nempty them and bring the money uh from it. Uh, he, mmm, I would, in fact, uh he, he was at least\nto me he was an older man, I remember I, I would uh cover him up at night, and I would shine his\nshoes too. Uh, he was very, very kind to me, and he, as I say, he was helpful not only to me, but he\nwas willing to take great risks to help my mother and sister.\nPeople like him and others who helped in rescues, what were the risks?\nIn Poland, to assist a Jew was very risky. That is, if you got apprehended, uh generally the Jew was\nkilled, maybe taken to a camp in some situation and uhh maybe later killed. The Poles who were\nguilty of assisting Jews, uh, were often, not always, but on many occasions killed or sent to to a\ncamp. In some villages, uh, the house was burned down. I know, for example, uh of a man who\ndid assist my family, but that didn't have to do with our family, uh, and Mr. Kubinsky, uh whose\nfarm was burned and his family was killed. It was not always the case, but there were quite a few\nuh, Poles who were killed. (Fire engine siren in background).\nLet's stop. We've got to stop because of the siren.\nTake 6 is up.\nI have a 2 hour interview and there's never a break.\nUh, how difficult was your survival from the standpoint of age. Can you talk about what it was like\nto be a teenager running under false papers.\nWell, being a teenager had certain benefits. Uh, you know, as a teenager, you, you feel that you are\ninvulnerable, and you can do almost anything, and in reality, you know, so was, one was more\nagile. I could jump from a train. Uh, I could jump from a running streetcar or because somebody\nuh, made some move, whereas if I couldn't, if I was much older, I could, there were a number of\nsituations where I have outrun police, and have outrun Germans who were shooting after me, and\neven with dogs. Now that was not, you couldn't do it unless you were 15 or 16 year old. So, that\nwas an asset. Obviously you might uh have less of a judgment in dangerous situations because you\nwere a teenager, but by and large, I think being teenager, considering the situation, was an asset, I\nbelieve. But obviously what I didn't have an adolescence, uh in in any normal sense of the term.\nCan you talk about choices that Jews would have had based on age. Like you have more\nchoices maybe than a 30 year old father with 2 little children.",
        "end of the war. The kinds of things you did.\nAfter I escaped the monastery, I lived with this young man, who was on false papers himself. He\nwas not a Jew, but he was a underground fighter. His name, his real name was Stefan Yagoginski,\nand he lives to this day. Uh, he and I lived together, he pretended that I was his uh nephew, and uh,\nhe worked, he was repairing an organ in a large village. There was nothing wrong with the organ,\nbut that was the cover, he was working on repairing the church organ because his father owned a\nfactory of organs and there was the connection, and he and I, and I was assisting him in it. But then\nalso, we had no funds, I had no funds anymore, no money, and we smuggled, we smuggled food\nfrom the villages surrounding Krakow to uh you know, to Krakow, and then we smuggled uh food\nto Warsaw, which was dangerous, and we smuggled from Warsaw, a, a Vodka, but not the real\nVodka, but called, it was called Bimber, which was like Moonshine. That certainly was punishable\nby death. Uh, in fact, I was in Warsaw smuggling Bimber when uh when the Warsaw ghetto\nuprising started. I remember like today I, we were there, Stefan and I, uh, and then, it became\nincreasingly too dangerous and through some contacts, we found out that one could uh, escape to\nHungary. And Hungary at that time from what I was told, was really like paradise to us, and we\ndid manage to escape to Hungary, and that's a long story, it was, 1t had, we had to cross a border,\nwe got uh apprehended, escape, it was a complicated situation, and we did uh arrive in Hungary in\n1943, sometimes in fall. My mother, sister, and, and I, and a childhood girlfriend of mine, whose\nfather was killed in a camp. My father knew where he was, where she, where the girl was, her\nname was Gina, and we arrived in Hungary, and we were there as Poles on false papers, but in\nMarch of 44, the Germans occupied Hungary also. So the whole same situation started again. I\nattempted to escape with a Jewish underground group to Rumania, because there was a connection\nto Palestine at that time, but got apprehended on the border between Hungary and Romania.\nHungary was occupied. Rumania was not. And I was taken to a camp in Yugoslavia, and then\nfrom that camp, I was transported to a prison in Budapest. In fact 1t was the prison where the\nfamous Hanna Schenish was, she was on the same floor where I was, and I managed to escape from\nthere with help of, of, of friends.\nTell me about the escape.\nThe escape really occurred through assistance of a , a Gestapo man, who was of, who was sort of\nhalf German, uh and half Yugoslavian, and I was in a, uh, and I do take credit for that, I established\nthe contact with him, and I trusted him. Uh, uh, and uh, which was risk, because I gave him my\nmother's address, and my mother was still in Budapest on false papers. And I, I established, you\nknow, contact with him while we were in this prison, uh, he could have been just playing me for a\nsucker, you know, uh, but I trusted him and it turned out he really engineered the escape. I mean,\nit's a long story, but it was his doing, and he engineered the escape.\nWhat was, when you said you were there at the beginning of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising...\nOh no, I was only that day. I was that one day when the Warsaw ghetto uprising started, it so\nhappened that Stefan and I were just making one of our periodic trips to pick up the, the\nmoonshine. And it was, suddenly there was tremendous amount of activity, uh shooting and so on.\nThere was something going on, and we heard that there was a an uprising in Warsaw ghetto.",
        "So you just left?\nOh, we just left, we left in a in a great hurry.\nCan you talk about what you think survival is a matter of?\nOf, what made difference in survival were the personal uh qualities of the individuals. There were\nmany other factors, but everything else being equal, unless you were a person who had a\ntremendous will to survive, who had courage, resourcefulness, and uh, uh all the other factors\nwouldn't help. Now, sure you needed luck. And you needed uh assistance of other people, but\nyour personal qualities determined, and I am saying it not only on false papers, uh, people who\nsurvived in camps didn't survive by accident. Uh, every one, I believe, every survivor, uh in my\nview, and that is maybe is sort of an over--no I don't think it is, 1s really a hero. And survivors hate\nthat kind of a term. They avoid it because they don't want to take responsibility for their survival,\nand it took my great many years in, in analysis to recognize that I survived uh thanks not only to\nthe help of others, but thanks to my own activities, which makes me responsible for my survival.\nYou once talked about being accused of being a survivor, an accusation that you're a survivor.\nSurvivors have been greeted with a great deal of ambivalence from the very beginning, uh, and in\nparticular, uh, by fellow Jews, who , because survivors, in the eyes of Jews, were suspect. How did\nyou survive? That was the question. You know, what kind of evil deeds did you commit in order\nto survive. You were sort of contaminated uh, you know the Nazis, the only good Jew is a dead\nJew, and in a way, after the war immediately I believe, that was also a view of others. The, the\ndead people, they were the victims, the survivors were somehow suspect. And you know, to this\nday, there are all kind of memorials for everybody, Warsaw ghetto fighters, they, you have a\nkibbutz honoring the fighters of Warsaw ghetto, but you, you have streets named after fighters of\nWarsaw ghetto, but who talks about survivors? You know, what kind of, what avenue or what\nmonument has been, and yet survivors accomplished a great deal more than the fighters of Warsaw\nghetto, you know. So they killed a few Germans. So what. That doesn't impress me at all. I am\nmuch more impressed with a group of young men and women in Budapest who assisted people in\nsurviving, who risked, the Jews who risked their lives to help other Jews survive. They are much\nbigger heroes to me than the figh--fighters of Warsaw ghetto.\nOkay, we have to reload.\nBeep.\nWe ran out before you finished that last thought, so I just want you to do something that sort of\nanswers the question who you feel are the real heroes who really risked their lives. People who\nhelped.\nDuring this whole terrible period, there were Jews, in addition to others, who risked their lives to\nhelp other Jews. In my own situation in, 1n Budapest, for example, or in, in Krakow, but in\nBudapest particularly, there was a group of young men and women, who risked their lives day in\nand day out to assist other Jews, who worked on false papers, who smuggled money, and all they,",
        "they did this all to have others survive, and I am alive thanks to them. They're not celebrated as\nheroes, uh, but the group in Warsaw Ghetto, who decided to commit a collective suicide and\nsucceeded in the process of killing a few Germans, are, are celebrated, and, and I wonder why, why\nthat is, why don't we celebrate survivors, why don't we help those, why don't we celebrate those\nwho have assisted other Jews to survive. I think in part, at least that's my own answer to this\nquestion, is that we have sort of identified with this militaristic age, where it really matters uh not if\nyou preserve life, but if you destroy the enemy. When I first went to Yad Vashem many years ago,\nand as I walked in there, which isn't true anymore, the first thing you saw was a bigger than life\npicture of some Jews with guns, with, you know, as if this was the big deal. That didn't matter. It\ndidn't ever impress me that some Jew during the war years managed to get a gun. That didn't\naccomplish anything. So you got, you killed one German or two or three, so what! I'm much more\nimpressed with the fact that someone had the strength, the courage to survive, the courage to\nendure, the courage to endure, that really is what matters.\nDo you think there are close calls that you had, that you can think of that we should talk about?\nOh, I had great many close calls, and you know, one of the sort of funny part of it is, that in Europe,\nthere was great deal of literature on Indian lore written by a German called Karl May, who never\nwas in America, who never saw an Indian, who, in fact, wrote his books in prison. But we lived on\nthose books as kids, and I knew them and read them, and let me tell you, reading those books\nhelped me a number of times to survive. When we were crossing the border from um, uh, Poland\ninto Slovakia, we suddenly, when it was pitch dark and we had uh guides, and suddenly there were\nlights, dogs, and shots, and we uh, I first ran, you know, I was with my mother's sister and this girl,\nGina, and obviously I could run the fastest, I had, but then I realized my mother and sister would be\ncaught, and I could hear from a distance that there were also dogs there, and you know, my, what I\nhave read about Indian lore and all that, I shoved my mother, there was a river nearby, as she\napproached, and my sister and Gina had then jumped after them, and walked against the stream,\nforced them, my mother was terrified, and that really saved our lives, at that particular time, and\nthen we did hide, and the guides who escaped, they were mountain people uh from Poland, they\ncame and found us, you know. Now, these are strange things, and there were many other similar\nsituations where, they're just in a way bizarre in nature. But...one relied upon uh one's\nresourcefulness, really, I have to come back to the same term. One could not survive without uh\nwanting to live no matter what and also being resourceful.\nYou told a story of the Gestapo asking for volunteers for execution.\nYes, I I was in----------, and they told us, it was a makeshift prison, a Gestapo prison, uh, and three\nof our group escaped, and they came in. In fact, I see it like before my eyes today, the the chief of\nGestapo came in with his white gloves and stood there hitting with the white gloves on the bars\nasking, we were beaten before quite a bit, but we were lined up and standing, asking for volunteers\nfor execution. And, uh, a friend of mine, who, who I, his name I remember to this day, many\nnames I don't remember, was Sonik, he volunteered first. He was depressed, and he really didn't\nwant to live. I volunteered second, but I assure you it wasn't because I wanted to die. It was\nbecause I believed that they would not execute those who volunteered. It was too simple. They\nwouldn't do the (clears throat) the normal things you uh, who volunteered for execution would after\nall be the one who was not an escape risk, and I was right.",
        "Tell me about the letter that man brought you from your father when he was in Treblinka.\nWhen I was in monastery, one day I was told that somebody is at the gate, who was, uh asking for\nme, and as I approached there, I could see a young man who clearly looked Jewish, and he handed\nme a letter, and it was a letter from uh from my father, who was in the uh, which was uh the airport.\nThis was the name of the camp really, but it was called the airport. Jews worked on that airport,\nand my father said, \"You have to help this young man. He has to survive,\" and uh, they were\ntrying to get some papers for him, and he was going to have a contact. Anyway, I did hide him in\nmy cell, under, in my room, I brought him food, and I did keep him for a few days. Uh, I can't tell\nyou exactly how uh long, but not very long. And, uh, he did tell me that he escaped from\nTreblinka, and described to me what he did see and how he escaped, and you know, for many years\nI forgot it. I remembered it in my analysis. And, incidentally, he did not survive. His, a, a relative\nof his did survive, and I did get in, in touch with her. I know about her. Her name is, she lives in\nSwitzerland, but he did not survive.\nDo you feel that people would do anything at all in order to survive?\nNo. No. I think that in terms, I think that people uh showed conscience, uh. (He may be crying\nhere). No. What I did want to say is um, when I was arrested by Gestapo, and I was in in this\ncamp, uh, my mother, who was in Budapest at the time (long pause) um, was approached that if she\nbecome an informer, they would rescue me, they would get me, which wasn't, incidentally, true,\nbut it was a set-up, she was on false papers, and she, she uh refused. And I'm proud of it (crying).\nThanks. Thank you.\nAt least certain things without becoming overwhelmed.\n---------------for a while.\nThe following is 30 seconds of interview for previous interview with Emanuel Tanay.\nAre you rolling?\nOkay, let's, 30 seconds, all we need. Wait the fluorescents are on.\nRolling.\nThank you.\nEnd room tone. End of Sound Roll.",
