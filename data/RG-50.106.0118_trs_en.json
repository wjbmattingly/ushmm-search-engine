So he gave me in\nJewish, written, the address where to go. He was on vacation. He was the foreman. I\nwent there and I asked the man if he\u2019s speaking Yiddish, he said very little. So I\ntalked to him in Yiddish. Right away he gave me a chair and he gave me rags to dwe\n\u2014 to sew on the machine. I put my feet on the machine, the machine was running, this\nwas electric machines. I took off, the machine is staying. But the girls in the factory,\nthey didn\u2019t know I am Jewish, so they were thinking I\u2019m a Polish, so they help me.\nShe said Chana, don\u2019t take off none time the foot, just slowly, as the machine gonna\ngo Slow. If you like \u2014 you gonna get used to the machine, you gonna be the manager\nof the machine, but th \u2014 now, do like I\u2019m the \u2014 she told me how, I became a sewer\noperator.

Later we decide to have a \u2014 I was\nvery sick, so the doctor told me, I would suggest something, have another baby. So I\nlistened to the doctor and I got my da \u2014 my daughter, five years younger than my son.\nSo I bringed her too, to the factory.

Yeah, that\u2019s\nwhat she said, you are dirty Jew. So they took her into kindergarten, but she was two\nyears in kindergarten because she was very touched to me and my husband. She\u2019s\ngonna marry Nathan, my husband and I have to go to look for another. Her Nathan.\nAnd I was so foolish I paid 10 \u2014 10 d-dollars I paid to \u2014 to take a test if she\u2019s able to\n\u2014 because I like to push. So he \u2014 at \u2014 th-the \u2014 the man what he examined her, he said,\nlisten Mama, don\u2019t push too much. She\u2019s not matured afa \u2014 to go in a higher.

        "Q: I would like to go back to your early years in this country, okay. When you came\nto the United States, where did you settle?",
        "A: I settled in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And they put me in to people from Poland\nbecause he knew I can speak yiddi \u2014 E-E-English and they spoke with me the\nYiddish. And I lived there, I think a year or two years. Was \u2014 was on the third floor,\nwas very hard for me to bring up my little boy up there. And was pitchy ceilings, I\nforgot re \u2014 I ju\u2014 to hit my head all the time. So I moved to a regular apartment and I\nworked. I make 30 dollars. That time was 75 doll \u2014 cents an hour. They took out\nthree dollars for Social Security, so I got 27 dollars. Later my husband found a place\nand my husband was making 50 dollars a week. So we start to save a dollar or two,\nso we bought a home in Scranton. Later I sold the home, I made 10,000 dollars on\nthe home and I had to leave it, my husband to Tucson, Arizona. My husband is a\nvery sick man. He got asthma, emphysema and very serious arthritis, he couldn\u2019t\nwalk. So in Tucson, Arizona two months he got much better. In Arizona it was one\nplace only, a sewing place, so I went there for dresses. So from the 120 dollars what I\nmaked in Scranton, I maked over there 60, because the Mexican, this was very \u2014 this\nis the border for Mexico, the Tucson, Arizona. So he told me, I\u2019m paying only 40\ndollars to them, but to you I\u2019m giving 60. I said, Mr. Grossman, I\u2019m making double\nthat they\u2019re making because they came over to me to make them the cards, they were\nall here ba \u2014 about 20 - 30 years and they couldn\u2019t work or speak a \u2014 one word\nMay 20, 1999\nEnglish. So he didn\u2019t like this, so he told them to come give the cards to him, he 1s\ngonna make them out because we had to make out every day the amount what we\nmaked. But anyway, I said I would like a raise to Mr. Grossman because I am\nmaking double that they are making. So he gave me five dollars a raise. But later the\ntr \u2014 I wor \u2014I worked in oh, a little real estates. Got a ga \u2014 a ga \u2014 university from\n26,000 students, so I go \u2014 have got rentals for them, because from 60 dollars I\ncouldn\u2019t make a living and to raise childrens to give education. So thank God I\nmaked a little bit money, but we worked like slaves. I was cleaning after them, and\nstudents, I was thinking students are th-the na \u2014 the worst tenants in the world 1s\nstudents. Cheaters and ev-everything. So I worked in my lit \u2014 my daughter was\nhelping me, my husband, we cleaned th-the \u2014 the apartments.

        "Q: When you came to the United States, did anybody help you?",
        "A: No. Th-the Joint. The Joint gave me 25 dollars every week, and they paid the\nrent, two months rent they paid for me because I went two months after, to work. So I\nmake 30 dollars.

So he gave me in\nJewish, written, the address where to go. He was on vacation. He was the foreman. I\nwent there and I asked the man if he\u2019s speaking Yiddish, he said very little. So I\ntalked to him in Yiddish. Right away he gave me a chair and he gave me rags to dwe\n\u2014 to sew on the machine. I put my feet on the machine, the machine was running, this\nwas electric machines. I took off, the machine is staying. But the girls in the factory,\nthey didn\u2019t know I am Jewish, so they were thinking I\u2019m a Polish, so they help me.\nShe said Chana, don\u2019t take off none time the foot, just slowly, as the machine gonna\ngo Slow. If you like \u2014 you gonna get used to the machine, you gonna be the manager\nof the machine, but th \u2014 now, do like I\u2019m the \u2014 she told me how, I became a sewer\noperator. And in this place they got a registered nurse, so I got work to bring my little\nboy. I raised him there two years. For four years I went to the Hibbil(ph) home --\nHibbil(ph) school and I lied to them, I said he is five years old. And he was very\ntiny, he looked like three years. And I said, listen, I got enough Poland, my little boy\nis in the factory with all the Polish childrens and I don\u2019t want it. But I couldn\u2019t pay\nMay 20, 1999\nthe whole amount. So I paid that time 15 dollars or 20 dollars a month. And my little\nboy was a honor student in the Hibbel(ph) school. Later we decide to have a \u2014 I was\nvery sick, so the doctor told me, I would suggest something, have another baby. So I\nlistened to the doctor and I got my da \u2014 my daughter, five years younger than my son.\nSo I bringed her too, to the factory. She is very picky, so they got a \u2014 a double bed\nfor all the childrens, they were laying fa \u2014 th \u2014 this \u2014 ta-take a nap, and she was \u2014 she\nrefused. She don\u2019t want it, I don\u2019t want it lay in the bed. So I walked over to Howard\nand I said, Howard, can I bring the carriage for my little \u2014 he said yes, so she was\nsleeping in her carriage the rest \u2014 th-the \u2014 there, yeah. Later I did with \u2014 had the same\nthing for four years. She was two years when I bringed her to this \u2014 to the factory.

And she didn\u2019t know what means dirty Jew, she said, I took today \u2014 the\nmorning, my mother gave me a shower, and you are dirty Jew, not Iam. Yeah, that\u2019s\nwhat she said, you are dirty Jew. So they took her into kindergarten, but she was two\nyears in kindergarten because she was very touched to me and my husband. She\u2019s\ngonna marry Nathan, my husband and I have to go to look for another. Her Nathan.\nAnd I was so foolish I paid 10 \u2014 10 d-dollars I paid to \u2014 to take a test if she\u2019s able to\n\u2014 because I like to push. So he \u2014 at \u2014 th-the \u2014 the man what he examined her, he said,\nlisten Mama, don\u2019t push too much. She\u2019s not matured afa \u2014 to go in a higher. Let her\nMay 20, 1999\nstay another year in kindergarten. So she was two years 1n kindergarten. But my\ndaughter was a honor student, my daughter got a scholarship.

She\u2019s staying there to straight out, to help out a little bit, because they\nput a electric station in the water. They got the \u2014 they were \u2014 they got fish, so they\ngot a little bit business. But the \u2014 now the electric station 1s in the water, so they don\u2019t\nhave fish. So they plant eggs \u2014 fi-fish eggs in another place. So a truck with gasoline\nwas broken and the eggs got full of the gasoline. So they don\u2019t have none of the\nfuture either. So now she traveling to find out the situation for them, yeah. My\ndaughter is an [indecipherable] and she\u2019s making, God bless her, good girl and good\nmoney, too.

        "A: I settled in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And they put me in to people from Poland\nbecause he knew I can speak yiddi \u2014 E-E-English and they spoke with me the\nYiddish. And I lived there, I think a year or two years. Was \u2014 was on the third floor,\nwas very hard for me to bring up my little boy up there. And was pitchy ceilings, I\nforgot re \u2014 I ju\u2014 to hit my head all the time. So I moved to a regular apartment and I\nworked. I make 30 dollars. That time was 75 doll \u2014 cents an hour. They took out\nthree dollars for Social Security, so I got 27 dollars. Later my husband found a place\nand my husband was making 50 dollars a week. So we start to save a dollar or two,\nso we bought a home in Scranton. Later I sold the home, I made 10,000 dollars on\nthe home and I had to leave it, my husband to Tucson, Arizona. My husband is a\nvery sick man. He got asthma, emphysema and very serious arthritis, he couldn\u2019t\nwalk. So in Tucson, Arizona two months he got much better. In Arizona it was one\nplace only, a sewing place, so I went there for dresses. So from the 120 dollars what I\nmaked in Scranton, I maked over there 60, because the Mexican, this was very \u2014 this\nis the border for Mexico, the Tucson, Arizona. So he told me, I\u2019m paying only 40\ndollars to them, but to you I\u2019m giving 60. I said, Mr. Grossman, I\u2019m making double\nthat they\u2019re making because they came over to me to make them the cards, they were\nall here ba \u2014 about 20 - 30 years and they couldn\u2019t work or speak a \u2014 one word\nMay 20, 1999\nEnglish. So he didn\u2019t like this, so he told them to come give the cards to him, he 1s\ngonna make them out because we had to make out every day the amount what we\nmaked. But anyway, I said I would like a raise to Mr. Grossman because I am\nmaking double that they are making. So he gave me five dollars a raise. But later the\ntr \u2014 I wor \u2014I worked in oh, a little real estates. Got a ga \u2014 a ga \u2014 university from\n26,000 students, so I go \u2014 have got rentals for them, because from 60 dollars I\ncouldn\u2019t make a living and to raise childrens to give education. So thank God I\nmaked a little bit money, but we worked like slaves. I was cleaning after them, and\nstudents, I was thinking students are th-the na \u2014 the worst tenants in the world 1s\nstudents. Cheaters and ev-everything. So I worked in my lit \u2014 my daughter was\nhelping me, my husband, we cleaned th-the \u2014 the apartments.
