He give me such a punch because I was near the wall, I\nwas thinking I'll faint, and and down here he lift again my chin, you know, and he asked\nme again, and uh again I raised my hand and I telled that's my God. I believe in Him.\nAnd he knocked me...he knocked me again...he knocked me in the front in my nose.

As soon as I lift my hand to the sky, he\npunched me in to my stomach. He give me such a punch because I was near the wall, I\nwas thinking I'll faint, and and down here he lift again my chin, you know, and he asked\nme again, and uh again I raised my hand and I telled that's my God. I believe in Him.\nAnd he knocked me...he knocked me again...he knocked me in the front in my nose. I\nhave a broken nose and he knocked those...my first three teeth what I have up to today\nfalse teeth. He broke them...I took out my teeth and threw them away in the front of him,\nand I was bleeding very much. And the same minute, when I took out my teeth, he asked\nme again, .It's like a = \u00abin God and I say when he asked me who's your God,\nI say you my God. I pointed with finger and with the same hand, the right hand what I\npointed to God, I pointed to him and I say you my God, and he asked me how come I'm\nyour God.

I start spreading the word...when somebody between the\nJewish people...he he choose...again when he asked you who's god, immediately tell.\nYou'll not be beaten like I was beaten, because all all the people are to go there in mine in\nmine in mine neighborhood, they saw when he beat me up, and they saw I was\nbleeding...they saw I could cry because you cannot cry because they they made you not\nto cry, so and then it was easier. I had a friend what we worked together for years. It\nhappened to him the same thing...the same...he took him out. They want to take him in in\nin the crematory and work and and I told them when that happened, he should he should\nsay the same words and he went, you know, and it just happened a day or two later, he\nwere in a different group, but this guy used to go around __ groups to group, just to do\nthis thing to beat up people.
