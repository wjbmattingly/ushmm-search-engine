        "Answer: Anyhow, uh, from that period I only remember one anticipated incident and it's quite\nremarkable. I have got back memories of I was locked, this was in the thirties when Hitler had\ntaken over Germany and well he had to kind of, well you know, he stimulated a Nazi movement\nin Denmark. Of course, Nazi movements , against the Jews. But what I meant by\nthis, some instant in the school yard, and I must have been very unhappy because our headmaster\nwho had finished , he was a priest by , by background, but\nrunning this prep school. [headmaster's name] called me up to his office and\ntried to console me and you know it's funny, it's uh, it's uh, it's uh, almost sixty years ago.\n, [headmaster's name] took off this typing and put it on my label and said that\nthis is for you. It's fantastic, that this small incident I remember so vividly because it was a\ngentle way of declaring sympathy. But, at any rate, at that time I must have been about ten years\nold or so, my grandmother had died, so it must have been in the mid, in the mid thirties, maybe\nthirty-six. My father was the , religious Jews who had the means. They went, he\nwent to Czechoslovakia and he found a scribe who could write a , you know.\nThis usually took about one year's time and around thirty-seven my father went down to pick it\nup in Czechoslovakia and of course then it should be installed in the synagogue and this of\ncourse required a whole ceremony and I still remember at that time they had moved to more, my\ngrandparents had moved to more comfortable quarters in the center of , not far\naway from the synagogue by the way. And um, I still remember the procession leaving the flat\nof my grandparents, my grandfather, had taken the route towards the synagogue it must have\nbeen about one kilometer and in front of this procession were two policemen riding on horseback\n, to keep order and then came the whole, you know, Orthodox Jewish community\nwith the hasaan(ph), you know, the church singer in front singing all kind of very sad Jewish,\nHebrew songs, I'm sure prayers. And after this came, my grandfather holding the Torah(ph), he\nwas not a very tall fellow, must have been about sixty or so. The Torah was almost as tall as he\nwas. It was a beautiful decorated , of the family had made with the cover\ndecoration with, you know, the name of my grandmother and so on and so forth and the whole\nJewish community followed my grandfather then his sons and the rest of the community and the\nRabi and what not, you know. And when we passed, the windows of the other private school in\nthis district we had always been in competition, sports competition and academic, you know,\ncompetition who brought out the best, the best, you know the best exams and so on. I remember\nthe pupil, this strange, no exotic sons, all three they rushed out and looked out from the window,\nhey , you know, it was me, they knew me from the football field, ah this is Pundik,\nyou know. They didn't say first names at that time usually formal. Pundik ;\nyes, DKs laid up[ph], one of the school mates remembered this incident and it made a deep\nimpression on him of course because it was so weird, it was so odd, but it made a very strong\nimpression on me, which I remember to this day. It gave me some kind of, you know, spiritual\nbase, not in a religious term, I respect very much my grandfather and my uncle's and my father to\nstand by their traditions and not to succumb, you know, to fear and what not and simply go\nthrough with this procession as it should be done. And I must say that very often I have been in\nall kinds of strange situations, I've been reminded of this because these people, they, you know,\nyou couldn't, they were not, they were not, doubtful about, they may have lost, slowly lost their\nreligious feeling, but as Jews to remit very proud, very full of self assurance; which made it\neasier for them to become , because if you stand by your culture the , will\nrespect you for what you are. But if you start, you know, being wishy-washy and you lose your\nculture background it becomes more difficult for you to be accepted and integrated in\n, culture. Jewish culture and other national cultures go very well together because\nthe Jewish culture of Tereshney|ph] was spiritual culture, not nationally, not nationally, rooted in\na special territory. That what is said about Jewish living, you know, the new Jews almost\nthought(ph), that this was something in the heaven, I mean, it was not through(ph) the Turkish\nJews living in Palestine. So this is, I want to relate one more incident which is, which 1s, told to\nme a couple of years ago, I had a schoolmate who is also of Jewish origin in this elementary\nschool, this schoolmate, uh, came from an assimilated family, , | mean they came\nprobably two or three generations before us. They came from a place in Germany called Desow\n(ph) and the name of the family to this day remains Desow (ph) and he told me when we met by\nchance a couple of years ago, that, uh, I was always dressed in brown, for some reason my\nmother always thought that brown suited me well, uh, and of course a very unharmonious\nrelationship between me and the color brown , | can't stand it, but that is how\nit was imposed on you, so I even dressed up in brown, what do you call it, special weaving, uh...",
        "Q: Herringbone",
        "A: I don't know, it's some kind of brown, uh, well most of us either wore blue or gray, or what\nnot, but I wore brown. This guy from Desow(ph) he once came home and asked his mother,\nTammy(ph), what is being Jew and then the mother said, well Jew, she didn't say Jewish like\nyou, no, no, she said well the Jew, this is like Putnik. So, now I understand he said,\nthe Jews are those who walk around with thier brown outfits. Anyhow, from that school I\ngraduated into the Jewish school of the fine arts, by the way, also been a pupil, uh, and later I\nwent to, we ought to now reach 1940, uh, 1940. I finished the other school which was a\nremarkable free school and then I joined the Sengre(ph), the Sengre School, one of the best in\nCoopenhagen, by the way, where the master, the chief, rector, whatever they are called was\nmarried to a Jewish woman who had been my father's teacher in the Jewish school. You know\nit's a very, very small community, both the Jewish and the non-Jewish community are very\ninterwoven. At any rate, so I, this was 1943 I joined this school,",
        "Q: This is when you(ph) joined the occupation.",
        "A: This was after the Germans in 1940 had occupied Denmark.",
        "Q: How did that effect your family?",
        "A: Well, you know, interesting that they Germans made a deal with the Danish Government. So,\nwhen the German occupation was rather non-violent a few Danish soliders put up resistance\nbecause they didn't want to listen to the orders from the superiors to lay down their arms. But in\nJanisport(ph) when the Germans just marched into neutral Denmark and Denmark had to know\nthat of course they could provide heroes, get heroes had they fought. But they had no political or\nmilitary power to assist the Danish, the German occupation forces. Demark succumbed, made a\ndeal with the Germans, a deal by the way which is of great significance to our life as Jews\nbecause that set us apart from the rest of the Jewish community in Europe, occupied Europe,\nbecause the made a deal with the Germans based on a kind of mutual respect, so to\nsay, Sharing of, sharing of authority. The Danes(ph) got permission from the Germans to go on\nwith their normal lives. Political parties were non-functioning, the parliament went on giving\nlaws, the government was inside, the King was riding through the town followed by a crowd of\nschool children on his horseback and so to say for most days in these years, the first years of the\noccupation, life was relatively normal, of course we were effected by the war and by the supply\nsituation, but basically the Germans let the Danes(ph), you know, keep to themselves and run\ntheir own lives. We had two, we had two free parliamentary elections Denmark\nduring the German occupation and the last one, the Nazi party, was simply trashed and the\nGermans didn't, didn't interfere. The Germans on their side of course wanted the Danes(ph) to\nlet the Germans go on, so to say, building fortresses along the west coast to protect against a\npossible allied invasion and Denmark was supposed to be kind of supplying people for the\nGermans so the last part of the agricultural production(ph) went to the German army and the last\npart of the industrial production went to, so Denmark as a matter of fact became kind of\nunwilling, but still partner to the German war effort, one has to admit that, but this, sorry yes...",
        "Q: Let me ask you about the Jewish community and your family in particular. Did they feel\nthreatened, vulnerable, did they feel...",
        "A: no, no, no...",
        "Q: They felt protected by the Danes?",
        "A: Well the Danish government, this of course we did not know, but we know today. The\nDanish government told the Germans that there were a number of red lines which the Germans\nwere supposed to respect in order to protect Danish sovreignty. One of the red lines was that no\ndistinction between Danish citizens. Meaning that no special anti-Jewish legislation, no\ninterference with Jewish life at the synagogue, the synagogues were operating the schools, were\noperating the old age homes, whatever you had so the structure of the Jewish community\nremained untouched by the German occupation until a certain moment of course, which was the\nfamous day of 29th of August 1943. I want to just relate one thing, of course the Jews knew\nabout what was on in Europe, but vaguely, you know we didn't even know in 1942, in\nSeptember, October the Germans had arrested the majority of the Norwegian Jews, although we\nwere related to the community, intermarriage between the communities and youthful activities,\nwe didn't know because we kind of lived in empty space, we didn't have information. We could\nhear pbc of course, but pbc didn't know much about the holocaust either until 1943, we didn't\nknow about the Warsaw Ghetto for instance, and the allies did not consider this a very important\nitem in the news broadcasting, so we lived as a matter of fact in a fools paradise. Being\npersuaded to believe that the normal life we lived could continue without end. In the Danish\ncommunity, by the way, was influenced by the Danish patricians, the Danish officials went on\ntelling us, don't be afraid, we'll protect you because we have told the Germans if they touch the\nJews this is what you call , this would be cause for war and then we would\nresign and the Germans would have to run the country. The Germans at that time did not\nnecessarily have the desire to turn this country which was serving their ends into a hostile\ncountry which they would have to occupy with tens of thousands of soldiers which they needed\nsomewhere else. So there was kind of a balance based on communal interest, the Danish wanted\nto run the country safely out of the war the Germans wanted to have as much peace as possible to\nconcentrate their efforts in another front.",
        "Q: Were there Jews who went into the resistance, the...",
        "A: I wanted to come to this because one of the things that was posted on us was not to get\ninvolved with the emerging resistance, don't get the resistance started, acting to be a\npopular movement only after the mid or end 1943. Until then resistance was some groups\ncommitting small sabotage acts, publishing newspapers, but it was not something which the\nGermans at all felt threatened by, not at all. Maybe it consisted of a few hundred Danish people,\nbut didn't want to enjoy the benefits of this Danish-German agreement. People\nbother, but they have no effect on the German war effort. So, we were told don't join them.\nNow I was at that time at the age of 15 and of course I joined them. If people told me not to do it\nand it happened so that the famous communist , It was a schoolmate of\nmine. We started selling illegal newspapers and books published by the emerging resistance in\norder to finance their activities, they sold these books to underground of course, it was banned by\nthe Germans, banned by the authorities, by the censor, the Danes had a post on Denmark. The\nDanes in order to prevent annoying the Germans too much, so one of the books I remember was\nby John Steinbeck. He was a part of the German occupation of Norway with me. He write, not a\nvery sophisticated book, what it was, it served the purpose of these times. So, we were\nand of course the first thing you did was to settle to your family, but at any rate\nthis was discolored by my father who was a member of the Jewish, one of the Jewish community\nagencies, member of the board or something. So of course he was more exposed(ph) than others\nbecause the Germans, as you know, that there had been always before going for the Jews in the\ncommunity to take all the members of the leadership of the community simply to deprive the rest\nof the Jews from any leadership. This is the way they used to handle it. So my father was very\nunnerved, you've got to do this because that might put me, the family, the community in a very\nsensitive dangerous position. And I didn't want to listen to my father and he of course, what do\nyou do, you call the chief Rabbi. At that time chief Rabbis were not administrators of\ncommunity affairs. They were people, imposing people with beards, you know and supposed to\nharbor a certain amount of wisdom. So I was told to go to the chief Rabbi.",
        "Q: This is Fleetiger(ph)?",
        "A: His name was Max Fleetiger(ph). He was originally from Hungary. He spoke in the Danish\nlanguage, but of course speaking with a heavy Hungarian accent. Later he was taken by the\nGermans and brought to a concentration camp and survived and came back\ninto the community again. But, I still remember, there are some parts in history which you\nremember vividly where you are standing or sitting with the other guy, like the story with the\ntyping, I remember that I was asked to sit down. I was standing up and he was sitting behind a\nhuge desk with his , his and had a beard like or square,\nlong beard, very well groomed, but you know. They told me that they, he ordered me to give up\nall this playing around and he said, I remember this today, if you don't give it up, you and others\nof your sort, you know, will risk the welfare of the Jewish community because if the Germans\ncatch you or the Danes catch you revenge might be taken and that might put the whole safety of\nour community in danger. So, give it up. The moment that you have been told that you have the\nresponsibility for a whole community and you're only fifteen years old, of course you'll give it\nup. So I went home and I burnt, and burnt all that was left of the illegal books and newspapers\nand so on. That must have been immediately before the trip to or immediately\nafter. But you know that in 1943, August there was a clash between the Danes and the German\ninterest and to put it shortly the Danes resigned and the Danish Government retired and the\nParliament went home the King went into exile in his castle and the Shee(ph) which has\nprotected us from German encroachment was removed overnight. Suddenly there were only\nGermans and us. The Germans didn't have to anymore consider this deal about you stick to your\nthings and we'll stick to our things and the Jewish we are leaving behind. So at that time, 1943\nAugust, about half of the Jewish community of Europe had been destroyed by the holocaust. We\ndidn't know a thing, we didn't prepare a thing, the community did not try to build up kind of\nwork preparing us. We were ==, we were____, I remember my father went\nto the Director of the Foreign Ministry, during these days, of course we had a feeling that the\nsituation had changed dramatically and that of course would change our situation, but we just\ndidn't know how and he went to the Director of Foreign Ministry, who was living in the\nneighboring house and he asked me what's new so he said, don't worry, I have contact with the\nGermans all of the time and if anything is cropping up, we will warn you, don't worry. Well, of\ncourse something cropped up, mainly the German Nazi against the Jews on the 2nd of October\nand he never warned us. I just want to tell in brackets a little human angle. We escaped of\ncourse and came back a couple of years(ph) later from Sweden and right after our return my\nparents sent this, by then had retired, a big bunch of flowers saying, don't worry,\nyou didn't warn us but we got away and safely we came back. Now, whether they heard\nanything from me or not, I don't know, it was a very, very difficult situation of course, being\nfaced with this old preach of promise. But many, many years later when I was serving as chief\neditor of the Danish daily newspaper called, Put___,(ph) maybe 50 years later...and one of our\nstaff members aboard the 22 union(ph) it was not very easy because he sort of wanted to stay out\nof the limelight. I called him and asked him to make an exception and our reporter.\nHe said, well I'll tell you one thing, there's one bunch of flowers I received one night which I will\nnever forget. These were the flowers which your parents sent me in 1945 after you came back\nfrom refuge in Sweden. It meant a lot to him that some people were trying to forgive him for\nhaving broken his promise. Which of course could have cost us our lives, of course. At any rate,\nso the Danish underground movement started becoming more and more of a nuisance to the\nGermans. At one point the Germans wanted the Danish Government, the Danish authorities had\ncontrol over the Danish army, the Danish police, everything was in place. The Germans wanted\nthe Danes to take steps in order to crush the underground movement and to the Jews\nthey sentenced for sabotage of court(ph) and so on and so forth. Well it's a long story, but the\nDanes refused the whole set up, so to say once abolished(ph) and the Germans were sitting with\nthe mark in their hands and . Then come September, September month and\nsomebody else was figuring on what happened politically, especially on the German scene(ph)\nwith regard to our situation as Jews in Denmark. But suffice here to say that the Germans\ndecided to extend the Jewish repression to Danish Jews, about 6,000 maybe 7,000 we were at\nthat time and they ordered three ships to come from Germany and anchor in Copenhagen\npreparing to take us and a group of communists who had been imprisoned by the Danish\nauthorities who had not yet been released, not succeeded in being released when the authorities\nwent home. So the Germans simply arrested them as one of the most, most\ndishonorable, dishonorable events in modern day history, by the way. Of course they were\narrested and kept against the constitution. Anyhow, the ships were prepared to take 7,000 Jews\nand a few hundred communists to Germany or to Poland, whatever they planned to do. But then\nsomething happened which enabled us to be warned beforehand and just shortly a warning came\nfrom the German who was the head of the German occupation authorities in\nDenmark. His name was Wern Best(ph), Wern with a '\"W\", Best, B-E-S-T and he instigated the\nentire Jewish activities by advising Hitler that now was the time after the Danish-German\ncooperation had collapsed, now was the time to go for the Jews. But for his own reasons, which\nis a very complicated matter, I don't want to go into too many details because people are much\nmore versed into the details than I am. For his own reasons, he let the secret slip out and told\none of his collaborators in the German, in the German embassy . A fellow who\nwas a Nazi too, his name was Tuckawitz, T-U-C-K-A-W-I-T-Z, Tuckawitz, told about the\napproaching, German, German, action, I guess the Jews...Now this Tuckawitz, by the way, was a\nmember of the German Nazi party, an early member of the Nazi party. Best was much earlier,\nBest was one of the evil spirits of the police department of the emerging Nazi party even before\nthe two powers divides(ph) into three. Really, really a war criminal. He was not ever\ncondemned to death, he should have been, for the reason that he let the secret slip and this was\nused by his defense to protect him against a life sentence after, death sentence after the war. But\nTuckawitz was kind of a reformed Nazi and he became close, he was a neighbor,\ncommercial, commercial. He had been with Camaris the head of the German\nintelligence. Camaris, C-A-M-A-R-I-S who is by the way execute(ph)\nby the Nazis. He had been with him at this job at the German embassy and was to prepare the\nGerman occupation of Denmark in 1940. But he remained here and established very close\ncontact with the leaderships of the socialcratic party and became embarked with them and started\nto distancing himself from the Nazi ideology. Of course especially the anti-Jewish part of it and\nthat when Best tipped him off saying that this day the of the Jews will take place\nand Best is quoted by Tuckawitz by the way, after the war. In racial talk or what German\nto the station. Tuckawitz quoted Best as saying, \"I wish we could build a bridge\nacross the south between Denmark and Sweden to aid these poor people to get safely away.\" We\nnever, we never know if Tuckawitz invented this, there's no motive for his having to invent it,\nbut there's no third witness. You only have his word for it that Best didn't say it(ph), not because\nhe loved(ph) Jews, he had been spending half his year fighting Jews, killing Jews. But his didn't\nfind that it was in his best interests that particular moment of history where everything was going\nagainst the German, the German arms, after the invasion of Italy. After the collapse of the\nGerman, the German military that fought in the Stantengard(ph) in Eastern Russia, in\nRussia. It was not for his, in his\ninterests that this anti-Jewish action should secede, that's why he told it to Tuckawitz who\nimmediately informed the German, the Danish social-democratic(ph) leaders, who immediately\nwent to the head of the Jewish community, a very respectable and respective lawyer of the high\ncourt called C.B. Pedricus(ph), a famous Jewish name. And they went to him\nand told him, okay, now you better prepare for something because there are only a couple of\ndays left. And it's very interesting, it has to be remembered because part of the Disney Land\natmosphere which we lived, they were killing Jews all over, all around us. From Norway and all\nthrough the continent and we thought that we would go Scot-free and didn't prepare for anything.\nThe Jewish community and leadership didn't even destroy the index of names and addresses of\nthe Jewish community. The Germans came one day and confiscated it. Still this was not enough\nfor us, so start moving, you know. And this guy in and the Danish\npolitical(ph) leaders, to want him(ph), they said, Mr. Hedtoft, H-E-D-T-O-F-T, Mr.\nHedtoft, later became the prime minister of Denmark after the war. He said, you are lying, he\nsaid well Hedtoft told him that he had a good source and that the game was up. You are lying.\nAnd Hedtoft almost broke out in tears because he was facing the war(ph) and the war(ph) didn't\nrespond. But they succeeded after a while at making them understand that this was a serious\nmatter and then out went the warning, the telephone chain as they called it, from one Jewish\nfamily to another that tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, don't stay at home because the\nGermans will come after us. Where you go, everybody was on his own. The community had not\nprepare any escape route or any escape organization, nope, nothing.",
        "Q: How did your father hear? Do you remember?",
        "A: My father, yes, my father heard this from somebody who had called him, who had been to\nmorning prayers in the synagogue on September 13th I think. And he came home, I was in\nschool, you know, we went on acting as if life was normal, you know, and as if we were as\nDanish as the Danes; which to some extent we were, at least in the eyes of the Danes, but not in\nthe eyes of the Germans of course. By the way there was no yellow star, you know, there were\nno, there were no special legislation introduced by the Germans as regards to the Jewish part of\nthe Danish community, Danish population. I went to school early in the morning, maybe at ten\no'clock or so, the headmaster came in and he said, \"I'm sorry but you and you,\" he said, \"you\nbetter come out, I have something to tell you in the corridor.\" And I remember that suddenly we\ngot up from our desks and were following him. Suddenly he turned around again and he said to\nthe teacher, \"you better come with me too.\" The teacher was also a part Jewish and\nthen the fade away(ph). But you know, at that time, I was fifteen, I was fifteen\nyears old I must have been, you know, retarded because I didn't understand anything at all,\nbecause we didn't speak about these things at home.",
        "Q: So you weren't afraid?",
        "A: I was not afraid. You know I remember I took the tram(ph) and I went to Keyosk(ph) to buy\nthe weekly magazines as I have done every week and I still remember I came with the weekly\nmagazine sitting under my arms. My parents, the door was wide , my parents were\nwaiting all dressed up, you know, over coat, why it was winter(ph), October, and said, \"hurry up,\nwe have to get away.\" And that's what we got because we...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "Q: Herbert, I would like to begin by asking you about your family background and when your\nparents or grandparents came to Denmark.",
        "A: Well, as a matter of fact I am the first generation born in Denmark. My father's side the\nfamily came just after the turn of the century from Ukraine, a town called Romney. Which is\nquite a famous town in Jewish history because a guy named Toebetor, who became a hero in the\nPalestine fighting(ph) with the Arab's(ph) back in the 20's came from there. Another guy called\nRotenbeck(ph) who made the first project for electrification(ph) of Palestine there.\nMy, , the first group of chim(ph) agricultural pioneers came from the same\nsmall town called Romney and they settled at the canya(ph) and they formed the first\n. Now my grandfather was what they call a kabaducmaha(ph). That means\na...do you know what that is? Well, he made hats, caps. And he told me when I was a young\nman and I asked him why did you leave Romney, why did you run away from Russia, the\nUkraine. He said that there was a in Romney around 1903 or 4, there was a whole\nempetamy(ph) of good programs at that time the collection(ph) with the defeat of\nRussians to the Russian-Japanese war. And this Romney was a little influential town where half\nof the population was Jewish, many of them were artisans, as my grandfather and he and a\nnumber of friends lived in a square, farm-like building on the outskirts of the town. And he told\nme that just before the pulcrum(ph) erupted a Russian officer came to him and he was from the\nCossack brigade and told him that you come with him and take his family. And you know at that\ntime you didn't ask why when an officer told you, so he took the family and they walked to the\nhouse of the officer and he said you stay here. And just right after the pulcrum(ph) erupted many\nJews were killed some of the work staff(ph) in this farm-like building where my grandfather had\nhis works were burned and after the pulcrum the officer took my grandfather back to the place\nand on the way he asked him, \"why did you save me and my family?\" and the officer said, \"well\nJew, that's because you make such wonderful hats for my soldiers.\" And my grandfather who\nhadn't finished any main(ph) university or any higher education he just knew that to survive that\nif the future of his family was dependent on his hats fit square with the soldiers heads then he\nbetter get out as quick as possible. So the pack(ph) that was left and of course they\nwere on their way to America, like most Jews, millions of Jews during these years went to\nAmerica. Being poor people the money quickly was spent when the in Germany\nthey had no more money to pay for their passage across the Atlantic. So they made up their\nmind to go to some place called Denmark. Why Denmark, because my grandmother had a\nbrother who had immigrated earlier to Denmark and he had sent some postcards saying that it\nwas not a bad country. So the thoughts in their heads were let's go where the money reached, the\nmoney took them to Gomain(ph), that was, as I said around 1905 or 6 or something. And they\nsettled down in one of the poorest quarters of Copenhagen, which today of course is Bohem(ph)\nquarter and were renovated(ph) slum houses. It was, but they went there because it was Jewish\ndistrict and they could meet people which spoke their language, which was not Russian it was\nYettish, they were not Russian speakers. And they could somehow repeat and rebuild to some\nextent the medium(ph) in which they had lived.",
        "Q: A religious ?",
        "A: Well, that's what I want to add. Another reason why they went their was that it was not far\naway, within walking distance from the synagogue. For them the synagogue was the center in\ntheir lives, both the religious life and the sacred(ph) life they lived.",
        "Q: Which synagogue?",
        "A: Well it was, it was the synagogue which belonged to the Uta(ph) orthodox and the community\nwhich was built around that time. , It was not at that time as far as my\ngrandfather goes, the big synagogue which had the kind of modernistic service, although it's\nconservative. He looked for his people and they were at this small synagogue.\nOf course, the , my father's generation they left the synagogue and joined the\nlarge, more modern synagogue. But this was kind of an intimate relationship with\nreligion. By the way this relationship with religion didn't last for long because my grandfather of\ncourse was very religious, he was also a small bearded fellow, my father didn't of course, he\nshaved and he was observant but not orthodox and the third generation intermarried\nand in a few cases were not Jews or became non-observant. But still of course were some\nhang(ph) for tradition, you know, they speak about two kinds of Jews: they speak about\nBalkhudan(ph); means Jews whose sits in the stomach, gives\nJews and the other group is called; alkhudan, which means that they are also Jews. But at any\nrate, so they settled there, and of course at that time they were three children, one of them that\nimmigrated was my father. He was at that time he was maybe 5, 6, 7 years old. They were\nimmediately sent to school. And here starts the immediate integration into Danish society\nbecause of this school was a Jewish school was formed by a Jew of Danish origin who saw that\nthese immigrants who came from Poland, from Russia at the turn of the century. They had to\nbecome Danes quickly, he didn't mind if they would stay Jewish as far as religious observances,\nbut he wanted them integrate us as quickly as possible into the Danish social life. Simply in\norder to protect the community that was there from rotten shoulders cold(ph)\nreligionist who sort of say would be looked at with hostility from the Danish environment\nbecause they were unobservant. So this was a great lack of the Danish-Jewish community that\nthey would provide services that would immediately channel them into the Danish society.\nLearning language, getting ready for Danish career.",
        "Q: Did your grandfather continue as a hat maker?",
        "A: He continued, sure he continued as a hat maker and my father when he was at the age of 9, 10\nyears old when he came back from school, everyday he would have to take a case with hats, 6\npenses, you know, and go in the harbor of Copenhagen. At that time Copenhagen was very, very\ndynamic harbor town, which it is not today, and to sell six penses to the sailors and to the harbor,\nport workers and so on. From that time my father had a deep feeling of gratitude to the Danish\nworking class. Which put a little attitude so that he, although it became what you\nwould call industrially started capitalism, he went on continued voting for social democrats\nbecause as he always told me, these people, you can match a little Yettish speaking boy looking\nstrange with this Danish were Danish of course, but two or three years\nin the country, walking around the harbor with a box of 6 penses trying to peddle them to the\nDanish workers. He could feel rejected by them and the country, so he had a very, since then, he\nso to say P [person's name] admired the Jews to politics and he became very, very\ngenerous as a donor for all kinds of Jewish and non-Jewish causes because he felt that he owed\nthese people something. By the way, jumping out a bit, but when they later built a very large and\nmodern textile factory in Copenhagen he was one of the first Danish industrialists to attend to the\nneeds of the workers. Providing for instance, kindergarten for the workers who\ncouldn't leave home or find a place in the public service and a building one of the best, beautiful\ncanteens facing a garden so that they could relax. He was, he didn't know that he was\nprogressive, but he acted in a very progressive way out of purely sentimental reasons. At any\nrate, so they settled here, and of course I'm not telling you anything that you don't know, because\nit's sort of kind of a replica of what happened to many Jews who came to the east coast of\nAmerica as immigrants from the same areas. That they put learning very high because they\nknew, for two reasons. Learning was part of the Jewish tradition, of course. The religious\ntradition, where all, all children quickly at the age of 3 or 4 years went to Torah(ph)\nschool and learned to read. Read Hebrew letters, so of course this was pretty converted also so\nthe desire to learn other things, other written languages but Hebrew. That was one thing, the\nrespect for the book and the respect for the language. And secondly of course we learned that if\nyou want to kind of upward mobility in society, you had to study. So my father couldn't afford it\nbecause he was the eldest so he had to go out and help the parents make a living, so the others\ncould afford to study. But the second boy in the family became an engineer and living\ngreat desires. And he became one of the very first immigrant boys who graduated\nfrom the university. So very quickly they started moving into society. Then of course came the\nfirst World War, 1914. Denmark was, as you know, a neutral country and there was kind of an\neconomic boom, prosperity in Denmark because it was neutral. Of course it exploited the\npossibilities it had by supplying the warring(ph) states with what they needed. There was Danish\nmilitary mobilization to protect the neutrality of Denmark and of course these soldiers they\nneeded hats and they needed uniforms and so on. And the Jewish didn't know anything about a 7\nor 8 day work week, you know, a 7 or 8 hour work week. They worked as much, as long as they\nneeded to provide, to supply those that gave them to consignments. They started establishing\nthemselves and moving from this very poor street to this street in the same neighborhood which\nwas a little bit less poorer, and I have a list at home which one of my uncles made where he\nnoted all of the addresses within the first couple of years. It was tremendous, this was kind of\nmigrant population. they had more money, they got another child, they moved into a\nflat with a half room more, bedroom more, that's how they slowly, slowly progressed and moved\ninto more boudoir quarters and became, as a matter of fact part of the Danish middle class.\nWithin probably the early 30's they had become middle class.",
        "Q: Living separately in a Jewish community within the Danish middle class?",
        "A: No, no, when the moment they moved out of the poor quarter, of course they moved into the\nmiddle, they used the Danish community. I wouldn't say that they had lots of social contact with\nthem of course, because still their religion and the synagogue was, so to say, the axis of their life.\nBut of course, there were 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, there were 8 children and of course the children reached\nout towards Danish society. You probably had the same effect that you have today, many\nDanish girls attempted to strike up relationships with types from the Mediterranean and these\nwere not Mediterranean's, but they were exotic at least. And Denmark at that time was a very,\nvery homogenous society and when these young Jews came to Copenhagen, they were attractive\nand exotic. By the way many of them married non-Jewish, already(ph) in the first generation.",
        "Q: And how did your grandfather react to that?",
        "A: You know, you know what happens, I don't know if this is pattern, but anyhow in my\nexperience is that there are several phases. One of the phases, one is a phase of shock. The\nsecond is the phase of slowly adapting but not reestablishing contacts. The third phase is when\nthe first child is born and then the whole bloody thing breaks down, you know you can't, then\nrelations are reestablished and everybody's is happy. But at any rate, I just want to\ngo back for one moment to this Romney, I tried to visit it during the communist times before\nGorbachev and before the break down of the soviet system. I went with a friend, a Russian\nspeaking friend, and we went to Kiev(ph) and we asked if anybody would take us to this place\nwhich is about 150 kilometers from Romney and everybody shied away and said, no you need a\nspecial permit, this is a closed country. So we found a very unhappy driver, unhappy because he\nwas deeply indebt for playing some kind of, I don't know, hasard(ph) or whatever it was. One of\nhis other friends, and couldn't pay his debt to the people who he owed money, they were people,\nvery strong armed people. One of his friends had to explain to us, we should jump out of the\nwindow because was jumping himself or being thrown out of the window, so he\nwanted to make money. You know, at any costs, so he decided that it was worth to run the risk\nand take us without permission to Romney and during the trip he turned to us and said, this\nfriend of yours who speaks perfect Russian, they're Danish Jew, by the way, but born in Russia,\nhe was a corespondent of the Danish state journalist in Moscow. He said that this guy is from\nthe KGB, so we said why should he be from the KGB? Well, he speaks such perfect Russian,\nhe's just posing as a Danish journalist. But after just a few miles, the guy turns around and he\nsaid to us, \"gee\" he said, \"I'm sorry, I made a mistake he's not from the KGB.\" And we said,\n\"how do you know by now\" and he said, \"look out through the back window\" and we looked out\nand there was a car following us, he said, \"these are the KGB's.\" And they really followed us all\nthe way from Kiev(ph) about 150 kilometers to the outskirts of the town Baneso(ph) the sign\nboard spelling Romney, then they jumped at us, they stopped our progress and we had to go out,\nwe had to sign documents and there was investigation and what not. Later we complained to the\nRussian foreign minister, of course, didn't help. I asked one of the Russians to take me, how\nlong to keep this place closed. He said, \"well as long as you\nwant to visit it, it remains closed.\" There must have been some military reasons, reasons for it.\nAnyhow, now of course, the town, I wanted to see. Maybe because of family, maybe because of\ncemetery, maybe because of the synagogue. I just wanted, for several reasons, to see the place\nwhere my father had been born. But now, of course, everybody can go there, but now I'm not\nvery attracted by it anymore. It was the prohibition that was attractive apparently. But anyhow,\nfrom this town, originally the first group that formed the first collective settlement keboots(ph) in\nPalestine at that time, later Israel. That was around 1908, or something of that close, maybe\n1909. But I asked my grandfather, why didn't you join them, you were the same age group and\nyou had to leave your town anyhow? Why did you have to take this long route around\nCopenhagen and what not, just for me 50 odd years afterwards to have to rise and go to Zion(ph),\nyou know, all the troubles. We could have landed there earlier, be part of the aristocracy. So he\nsaid, \"are you crazy,\" I would never have guessed this, he said, \"do you think that I would have\njoined a gang where the Tracy Malicker(ph),\" it's a Yettish, it's a Yettish derivation of\nMelcher(ph) which is a female name in Hebrew, \"the Tracy Malicker, should I join these\nbarefoot people, you know, they walk around barefoot.\" It's true, that the first you\nknow, that they called them the \"ball fees(ph),\" the barefeet, because they were poor and they\nmade an issue about being puretanic(ph) and so. Well anyhow I decided that, well, they were\ncrazy we all could see that they were crazy, we all could see that they were crazy, you know. I\ndecided that I wanted to find out what this crazy Malicker(ph) had been doing and I called the\nkeeboots(ph) and they found out that this crazy Malicker(ph) who my grandfather didn't want to\njoin, she became one of the most prominent educators in the Palestine Zionist(ph) Keeboots(ph)\nmovement. But anyhow, to jump ahead, we, my grandfather, became retired and my father\nstarted working at the Petlier(ph), the famous 7 , you know. They only went to\nschool for 7 years at that time and he became a statesman(ph)[possibly \"salesman\" and he passed\nthe career which, you know, the marriage of Jewish immigrants, he started as an employee, as a\nstatesman, he became independent(ph) statesman and by the year, he was traveling very much in\nScandinavia, some place else that the I have been living commuting between Denmark and Israel\nfor thirty years 1s part of the inheritance from my father. Every Sunday I met my dad, we wished\nhim well, and he went to the railway station and either went to Days(ph) Provinces, or he went to\nSweden, or Finland to make a living. He came back Friday went to the Synagogue in the\nevening, had to, back at home and on Sunday off they went again. In the mean\ntime, he got married. My mother's family came originally from Poland, when she was a couple\nof years old they settled in Litic(ph). I'm sure I inherited some of the adventurous spirit of that\npart of the family because my grandfather, my great-grandfather...",
        "Q: On your mother's side.",
        "A: In the late ages they immigrated from Poland to America and came back and\nsettled in Litic(ph). He called his family from Poland to Litic(ph), Litic(ph) is in Germany.\nThey became American citizens because he was naturalized as an American. I still have at home\na fantastic picture where you see the old man all dressed up, you know, on the day that he\nbecame an American citizen. That must have been a glorious day in his life. Anyhow, from that\nmoment the family was American. They were American citizens, but residing in Germany.\nNow when the war started, the first World War, they of course, as American citizens, had to\nleave Germany, go to a neutral country. So they went to Denmark. And they stayed throughout\nthe war years in Denmark. And they had a couple of beautiful daughters and they were very\nrespected in the community. And after the war they\nreturned to Litic(ph), but they left the kind of impression on the Danish community here. So\nwhen my father came of age and was supposed to find a wife to settle down, some people in the\ncommunity, \"well, ===~\u2014\u2014\u2014~\u2014~\u2014~\u2014_\u2014s a very nice family from Litic(ph) and they had two beautiful\ndaughters, go and take a look.\" So my father went, went to Litic(ph), and that must have been\n1925 or 6 and they married and my mother joined, of course, my father in Copenhagen. And that\nis how, how a nuclear family so to say, came to Denmark. One from Russia, one from Poland,\nby America and Litic(ph) and they settled down in Copenhagen. I was born in 1927. This is\nmore or less the origin of the family. In 1933 they left the rest of the family, my grandparents\nand left Litic(ph) and they immigrated to America where some of their boys already\nhad gotten, became very American patriotic, you know they served, the boys, in the second\nWorld War, the army, the navy and so on. Very Americanized.",
        "Q: What was your mother's family's name?",
        "A: Originally it was Takletaub(ph). It's not an unusual Jewish name, Takletaub(ph).\nTakletaub(ph) is the name of a certain kind of a dove, pigeon. But they abbreviated \"tove\" to\n\"taub,\" t-a-u-b. This was more, I just want to say one funny thing about my grandfather on my\nmother's side. He was very, very strict and stubborn. He's remembered as a disciplinary in the\nfamily. One of these autocratic, patriotic types, who could never do wrong, and if he ever did do\nwrong, he could never admit it. My mother told me one particular case, he was supposed to go\nsome place in Europe from Litic (ph) the family took him to the train and they waved at him\ngood-bye and he sat down and they were very , they were very unemotional. So they\nnever stood in the window of the train waving good-bye, they simply, when they put out the\nwindow and took out the newspaper they could on the platform, you know, looking\nat the family patriarch leaving. But what happened that day was, he went onto the wrong train\nand instead of going to Paris, he ended up in Prague and he could never admit it because had he\nchanged in the meantime, you know, half way, then of course it would be ridiculous. So from\nthat moment he pretended that as a matter of fact he was supposed to go to Prague while the\npeople were waiting for him in Paris. So, anyhow, so they settled and they got, my\nparents, got three children. Besides me, my brother and my sister. My brother was killed by an\naccident in 1946. My sister immigrated, 7 years we immigrated in 1954. To Israel(ph) where\nshe married and lives today, has three children. That is more or less as far as I remember the\nrelative background...",
        "Q: Were you the oldest, middle?",
        "A: I was the oldest, yes.",
        "Q: And did you go to Jewish day school?",
        "A: Well I, I did go to Jewish day, the first five, the first day school...",
        "Q: ...day school...",
        "A: ...this I don't remember.",
        "Q: You had mentioned that...",
        "A: But I had went to the first elementary class, is the first 5 elementary school years. I went to a\nprivate school in the area where we lived. One of the snobbish schools in Copenhagen. But this\nwas part of the, not because my parents were snobs, but they wanted me to have a good\neducation and succeed. They wanted you quickly to join, to join the rush. So they put you in the\nbest school available.",
        "Q: And Jews were allowed in any of those schools?",
        "A: Of course, Denmark was, since the Jews got citizenship, they were totally equal there. Of\ncourse there were Danes who didn't like Jews but there was not anti-Semitism in Denmark. I\nalways distinguish between societies where you have anti-Semites and societies where you have\nanti-Semitism. In Denmark you have anti-Semites, the individuals but you never had a trend or a\nmovement of this kind. Even the Nazis when they formed a political party were very weak on\nthe anti-Semitic stuff because they knew that this would reject some of their potential followers.\nYou know, Jewish-Denmark for the last 150 years had been, there's been a kind of, you know,\nwhat do you call, these tries(ph) children pay(ph) within circuses, you know up and down, up\nand down mountain rides, you know, you had...",
        "Q: You mean a roller coaster?",
        "A: A roller coaster, that's right, sorry, a roller coaster. You had immigration, then the people\nwho were after acclimatized(ph), they assimilated within a couple of generations. The Jews\nalmost were extinguished as community, then a new wave of immigrants came; so came up and\ndown, up and down. Today we hadn't had an immigration in 1969 of Polish-Jews, a couple\nthousand Pol-Jews, the Danish community, the Jewish community would be very, very weak\nbecause similar to what happened in some of the states of America. You have a integration rate\nor assimilation rate or intermarriage rate, call 1t what you want for more than 50, 60 percent. So\nif no more Jews will arrive in Denmark or the next generation than the two Jew races, the two\nother year, two other century old history of Danish Jews would more or less be concluded.",
        "Q: Herbert, when you were younger, were there, did you participate in any religious ceremonies?",
        "A: We were of course, we were observant at home.",
        "Q: Was a kosher home...",
        "A: I beg your pardon...",
        "Q: You had a kosher home.",
        "A: Of course, yes. I walked to Synagogue every Saturday an hour walk with my father. Later of\ncourse, the chief Rabbi realized that he had to choose either between letting the Jews take the\ntram or the subway to Synagogue, or they wouldn't go to synagogue. So they released the Jews,\nfrom the Jews to walk, and he permitted them under the condition that they had bought tickets\nthe day before, he permitted them to drive to Synagogue. By this, so to say, he saved the\ncommunity from extinction. At any rate, I remember I was not supposed to go to school on the\nholidays or on the . I was in the beginning when I was not supposed to wear anything,\nmy pockets, you know. I remember that I wore, what they call abachafaut(ph), which is kind of\ncloth which you wear under your, on your skin with four tetsiut(ph) applied, you know. This\nwas a religious garment and I wore this as a child. You can imagine that when we had physical\ntraining lessons in school and they discovered that this guy wore some very strange things under\nhis underwear. But it gave me a feeling of identity and I survived whatever it might have been\non funny remarks. And this ties up with a story that I want to tell you which happened to me\nduring the same period when I went to this elementary, non-Jewish school. Well one thing I\nremember very, very strongly that was one anti-Semitic incident in school.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",
        "A: Anyhow, I remember when we took a taxi out to hide with a friend of my father's, a business\nfriend, of course, non-Jewish couple. And I was later told by my mother, years after that the\ndriver of the taxi refused to take money for the trip. At that time this was the first sign of some\nkind of, say, popular resistance coming to the aid of the Danes. You know, people were warned\nby neighbors, by Jewish families to just leave their homes. But there were moving details, you\nknow, some Jews who took hiding into the woods because they had no where to go. There was a\nbotanical garden in the center of Copenhagen just across from one of the large municipal hospital\nand the doctors and nurses during the day went out and searched for Jews hiding in the botanical\ngarden. People who didn't have business friends who they could turn to. I remember, one of my,\na friend of mine later at the university who became a member of parliament for the social\ndemocratic party, his father was head of the social democratic party organization in the center of\nCopenhagen and he simply recruited his son and a few other youngsters and he told them to go\nthrough each and every house, look at the name cards and when they see something that could be\nJewish, warn them and tell them to get away. At that time, already, lots of individual initiatives\nwere taken. There was no coordinating rule for organization. But the moment the people, non-\nJews realized that the Jews were in danger, than all kinds of initiatives were taken by individuals,\nby groups of people, by priests, by hospitals and so on. So, this particular case, whenever they\nmet a Jewish family, there were many Jewish families in this area here, especially poorer Jewish\nfamilies because it was at that time before the war restrictive, not so, no quality housing, I would\nsay to put it mildly. So they had been told, if you find a Jewish couple, tell them immediately to\ntake a taxi and go to Bespepyau(ph), Bespepyau Hospital, where they would be offered\nhospitality and put into hiding. One place he found another friend student of his a student, a\nfellow of his and they said, well it can't be, you know, that's how the Jewish reaction was to the\nunintelligible. Of course, it must be against nature. And again he\ntold me years later that it broke him to weeping, simply because...so then the father, the father\nsaid, you're my friends, you're my sons friends and if you say, we believe it and then to the\ncar(ph) and went out to the hospital. In one case he told me that he found an old, old lady and\ntook her to the hospital and suddenly she got a fit of hysterics...",
        "Q: ...anxiety?",
        "A: ...anxiety, that's right. She had forgotten the garments which she had prepared for her burial.",
        "Q: The shroud(ph)?",
        "A: The shroud, yes. She had forgotten this in her home and she insisted to go back to pick it up\nand there was a big commotion and the head of the rescue operation there(ph), who later became\nmayor, lord mayor of Copenhagen, he told my friend , | prohibit you to go back, it's\ndangerous, you must leave without the shroud, you know. Our friend still went back to pick up\nthe shroud and delivered it to her. There where lots of small incidents where people really\nshowed some kind of...",
        "Q: ...sensitivity",
        "A: sensitivity or empathy with the people who...anyway that's the story. The story is that night\nwe stayed with our friends, we couldn't stay more than one night at one place because, you\nknow. Now we know in retrospect that the Germans acted totally different than they acted in\nother occupied countries. But we had to prepare for the worst, so we had to make all kinds of\ndecisions because we believed that this was a serious matter for the Germans. Now we know\nthat they were all common interest in the German camp which enabled us to escape to Sweden,\nbut it's quite obvious that half the Germans acted with the same will power. The same, the same\norganizational talent which they used in prosecuting, persecuting Jews in other countries. Of\ncourse they would have caught us, but we didn't know so we had to act as if...by the way this is\nalso true for the Danes. After the war there was the inclination to say, well anyhow the Danes\nare not such great heroes, but the of the Danes were caught, those few that were\ncaught got two or three weeks of prison by the Danish authorities. You know, we still had\nDanish courts, we didn't have German courts. Looking at most of the Jews, only 500 were\narrested, the rest were . It's true that the conditions were in our favor and\nin the favor of the Danes who helped us to rescue. But one has to go back and look at the\nsituation as it were in as far as we could know and all the Danes who came to our help. They\nhad no reason to believe that they did not risk their lives. And in other countries like Poland,\nFrance, Germany and anybody hiding a Jew was stood up against the wall and shot. So I really\nthink that this was a very heroic chapter in Danish history. But we thousands of\nthings, well, could believe that they were ready to risk their lives and save the Jews. The fact\nthat they didn't(ph) do it comes, that we learn after the war. But this doesn't change the fact that\nthey were justified believing that they acted as heroes.",
        "Q: But the Germans did capture some, didn't they?",
        "A: They captured about 5 hundred and about 6,500 came over. Now in our case, we shifted from\nthe first hiding place to another. We went down the coast. This was like animals do looking for\nescape routes. You go by the smell, you know, and you go by instinct you went down to the\ncoast because the only place that you could hide, along the coast and hope to be able to get to the\nonly place that might receive you and protect you was Sweden. And the sound(ph) between\nDenmark and Sweden is not very wide, but it recovered by the distance from the Danish coast to\nSweden territory water could be covered by a quick boat in less than half an hour. But it was\nbeyond our imagination. There lies Denmark which is hidden in the darkness and just across this\nnarrow sound was neutral Sweden with lights and with chocolate and bananas and what not. But\nbegan to realize that there were people who were able to live another kind of life that\nwe were. But we went down to the coast hoping that we could escape this way of course and\nhapbeny(ph), the Swedish government who had, by the way, not been welcoming to Romney\nrefugees in 42's and early 43 issued a declaration during these H days welcoming all\nJews saying that they could come to Swedish protection. The fact is that the Swedish not only\nmade statements to that effect, but they also acted accordingly because Swedish patrol boats\nfrom the navy went out took the Swedish to the borderline and the moment that Danish boats\ncrossed this borderline the Swedish boats immediately came to protect them. So that in case that\nGermans, I mean, you had to account for all . In case a German patrol boat would\ntry to encroach on Swedish waters to catch a fleeing refugee boat the Swedes would simply\nintervene. But anyhow we went to the coast...",
        "Q: Wait, where on the coast?",
        "A: It was a place called Sletten, S-L-E-double T-E-N, which is not far away. I mean very close,\nit's fishing, to the museum of Catipriod(ph) called Louisiana. Then we went to the fisherman\nwith whom we had stayed for years during our summer vacation, plus it was a rule that they\nsublet the houses to people from town, then they move into a house in the back yard, during\nthese two months of summer vacation. And of course he knew us well and he offered us\nhospitality that we could have wanted because he didn't use a telephone. We believed that this\nwas real, this was for real, you didn't use a telephone, you didn't speak to any strangers, you're\nafraid of moving on the roads because you were afraid of ending up in the arms of German\npatrol, there were Germans all over the place, soldiers mainly. Only later we know that the army\ndecided not to interfere, not to take part in the acts against the Jews. So the German army for its\nown reasons of interest did not allow for the Jews, wanted to protect the Jews, but simply for its\nown interests the German army only had one case that's known to have participated in this anti-\nJewish action. This was left to the police and the, what do you call it, the visheyesteins(ph), the\nwhat the German counter intelligence, whatever it is the, Estit(ph), it's called Estit(ph). So the\nvery fact that the army was all around didn't interfere. This we couldn't have known either. So\nwe took hiding at this place and one night he had negotiated with another fisherman to take us\nacross to Sweden. We were told that late at night to move across the coastal road and go down\nto the beach and wait under a small bridge to be picked up. We were standing there freezing, my\nparents, my father, my mother and my three sisters and brother and we heard the doc(ph),\ndoc(ph), doc, doc [sound of approaching boat], of the fishing boat approaching the docks of\ncourse the lights are on us. I mean today we're sitting in a warm room, this thing 50 years behind\nus, it's difficult to imagine a family all on its own alone, without any protection standing on a\nsmall wooden bridge looking into the water waiting for the doc, doc, doc, doc to come to pick\nthem up. But anyhow, the boat appears from the darkness and we are all already to jump at the\nboat and it simply passed by and it went to a bridge where another Jewish family was waiting\nand picked them up and off it went to Sweden. Of course we never learned what the reason was,\nmaybe these people could have paid them more money, maybe it was a mistake. I don't know,\nbut we were standing out there in the darkness without any alternative. So we returned to the\nfisherman and we really did not, my father was responsible for the family. These were times\nwhen the fathers felt responsible, he didn't know what to do, we all relied on the fisherman\ngetting some kind of connection which we could use in order to get out. Another night we spent\nat a large white house with lots of other refugees sitting in the dark sitting room, living room and\nthe specification, the student organization, while rowing us over, rowing, can you imagine,\nmaybe room for 2 or 3 people in these heavy wooden boats which they were taking from the\nfisherman, loaned from the fishermen rather. And I remember that when our turn came, the guy\nwho was supposed to row us over, this would take hours, I mean you could go by quick boat for\n30 minutes, but to be rowed over by one man that was very heavy(ph) going, two hours, and\ngoing for more than one trip was very difficult, but these were in the days that when the crisis\nwas really on these were the nice ones that knew that the Jewish were looking for us...",
        "Q: ...the Germans.",
        "A: The Germans, sorry, the Germans were looking for us. People got scared, the Germans were\nlooking for us. And suddenly the door opened, I remember this vividly because you are on the\nedge, you're on the way of getting out of this horrible thing. Then the guy, the student, who was\nsupposed to take us came in and we saw that blood was running down his palms and he said to\nmy parents so we had to go back to . Then the next day, suddenly the door bell rings,\nwe of course are like mice scurrying around hiding. I remember one of my brother hide a\nmy father had hidden under the bed. A very undignified situation today, it's very\nhard to remember. You know, that parents at that time were, had different stature(ph) then they\ndo today. For instance, in our dining room there was a father's chair and nobody would ever\ndream of sitting in father's chair even if he was away. Another thing that I remember so vividly\nis some very painful memory is that when we finally got on our way and found a reliable escape\nroute it was the day after. We run through a forest at night, single file of course, the father in\nfront. Suddenly my father slipped on a route or a branch and fell. This was the fall of, this was\nthe fall, suddenly seeing your father in this, he was always in control, the provider, the protector,\nsuddenly seeing him in a situation with this falling you know at the time when the whole family\nwas relying on him, you know, this is something which still today can give me the creeps. But at\nany rate, the door bell rang and the fisherman went out to answer the door, because in those days\nif you didn't open the door, they would break in. At any rate, if you didn't open the door, as I\nsaid, they would break them in. So he went out and opening the door and a voice asked, as we\nheard from inside, \"is the family Pundik here?\" Of course the fisherman says, \"no, no, no, I don't\nknow anything about Pundik, I haven't seen them since summer.\" My father recognized the\nvoice and he took a chance and said, \"yes we are.\" He took a chance because we were without\nand turned to chances. The guy comes in, another business friend of my fathers,\nwho by the way his son was collaborated with the German Nazis, a very strange situation. And\nthis guy, by the way, he way limping, walking with a stick. He had walked from Elsenor(ph)\nalong the coast knocking all doors available asking the same question, \"have you seen the Pundik\nfamily?\" He couldn't know if we had escaped already, but he simply, you know, that is the way\nthat people had to act it was a moral imperative for them to act, so he did this impossible thing\nand found a needle in the haystack. He went along the coast asking, he knocked on the door\nwhere we were and happily my father recognized the voice and said that I'll come get you tonight\nwhen it is dark in a doctor's car, in a physician's car was permitted by the Germans to move\naround freely came and picked us up and took us to his home. A place called Ultzgolden(ph)\nwhich is about 15 kilometer north of Elsenor(ph). He lived in a house facing the coastal road\nwhich was facing the sea. And at night, the next day he negotiated a deal with the fisherman, at\nthe night we were told to rush across the coastal road and go down to the sea. And there was a\nsmall rowboat waiting there for us, we jumped into the boat, there was a larger motor fishing\nboat waiting just a few hundred meters from the coast and we were rowed out to the fishing boat\nand I remember two things. I remember that I turned around and had a last look at Denmark and\non the beach were kneeling with their hands raised in a kind of praying position were the\nfisherman's wife and the follow who had saved us, my father's business friend and his wife, they\nwere believing(ph) people, praying. Another thing that I remember was maybe only that time I\nshowed a knack for journalism, I looked at my watch the moment the motor started operating\nand we were heading for Swedish territory waters and I remember that it took us exactly 37\nminutes to go from Denmark into safety to Swedish territory water. But some people, I want to\nconclude with a little anecdote, some people were not so lucky of course. One of my\npredecessors, is a chief of Puting(ph), was June(ph) Koppel, now I'll spell Koppel, K-0-double P-\nE-L and he was caught by the Germans while crossing the same coastal road. His wife who was\nnot Jewish got across and was down in the boat waiting for them, his two sons also, and he was\ncaught by a Gestapo car headlights. Caught the moment that he tried to escape and they took\nhim into the car and wrestled him and he was a fellow who was a off the Copenhagen\n. Even in difficult times, that while they were driving him off to Exenal(ph) to the\nprison, to the arrest house in Exenal(ph) one German Gestapo man turned around and says, vense\nhuden(ph), \"are you Jewish?\" and Mr. Koppel said, \"yes, and you?\" That's it.",

        "Answer: Anyhow, uh, from that period I only remember one anticipated incident and it's quite\nremarkable. I have got back memories of I was locked, this was in the thirties when Hitler had\ntaken over Germany and well he had to kind of, well you know, he stimulated a Nazi movement\nin Denmark. Of course, Nazi movements , against the Jews. But what I meant by\nthis, some instant in the school yard, and I must have been very unhappy because our headmaster\nwho had finished , he was a priest by , by background, but\nrunning this prep school. [headmaster's name] called me up to his office and\ntried to console me and you know it's funny, it's uh, it's uh, it's uh, almost sixty years ago.\n, [headmaster's name] took off this typing and put it on my label and said that\nthis is for you. It's fantastic, that this small incident I remember so vividly because it was a\ngentle way of declaring sympathy. But, at any rate, at that time I must have been about ten years\nold or so, my grandmother had died, so it must have been in the mid, in the mid thirties, maybe\nthirty-six. My father was the , religious Jews who had the means. They went, he\nwent to Czechoslovakia and he found a scribe who could write a , you know.\nThis usually took about one year's time and around thirty-seven my father went down to pick it\nup in Czechoslovakia and of course then it should be installed in the synagogue and this of\ncourse required a whole ceremony and I still remember at that time they had moved to more, my\ngrandparents had moved to more comfortable quarters in the center of , not far\naway from the synagogue by the way. And um, I still remember the procession leaving the flat\nof my grandparents, my grandfather, had taken the route towards the synagogue it must have\nbeen about one kilometer and in front of this procession were two policemen riding on horseback\n, to keep order and then came the whole, you know, Orthodox Jewish community\nwith the hasaan(ph), you know, the church singer in front singing all kind of very sad Jewish,\nHebrew songs, I'm sure prayers. And after this came, my grandfather holding the Torah(ph), he\nwas not a very tall fellow, must have been about sixty or so. The Torah was almost as tall as he\nwas. It was a beautiful decorated , of the family had made with the cover\ndecoration with, you know, the name of my grandmother and so on and so forth and the whole\nJewish community followed my grandfather then his sons and the rest of the community and the\nRabi and what not, you know. And when we passed, the windows of the other private school in\nthis district we had always been in competition, sports competition and academic, you know,\ncompetition who brought out the best, the best, you know the best exams and so on. I remember\nthe pupil, this strange, no exotic sons, all three they rushed out and looked out from the window,\nhey , you know, it was me, they knew me from the football field, ah this is Pundik,\nyou know. They didn't say first names at that time usually formal. Pundik ;\nyes, DKs laid up[ph], one of the school mates remembered this incident and it made a deep\nimpression on him of course because it was so weird, it was so odd, but it made a very strong\nimpression on me, which I remember to this day. It gave me some kind of, you know, spiritual\nbase, not in a religious term, I respect very much my grandfather and my uncle's and my father to\nstand by their traditions and not to succumb, you know, to fear and what not and simply go\nthrough with this procession as it should be done. And I must say that very often I have been in\nall kinds of strange situations, I've been reminded of this because these people, they, you know,\nyou couldn't, they were not, they were not, doubtful about, they may have lost, slowly lost their\nreligious feeling, but as Jews to remit very proud, very full of self assurance; which made it\neasier for them to become , because if you stand by your culture the , will\nrespect you for what you are. But if you start, you know, being wishy-washy and you lose your\nculture background it becomes more difficult for you to be accepted and integrated in\n, culture. Jewish culture and other national cultures go very well together because\nthe Jewish culture of Tereshney|ph] was spiritual culture, not nationally, not nationally, rooted in\na special territory. That what is said about Jewish living, you know, the new Jews almost\nthought(ph), that this was something in the heaven, I mean, it was not through(ph) the Turkish\nJews living in Palestine. So this is, I want to relate one more incident which is, which 1s, told to\nme a couple of years ago, I had a schoolmate who is also of Jewish origin in this elementary\nschool, this schoolmate, uh, came from an assimilated family, , | mean they came\nprobably two or three generations before us. They came from a place in Germany called Desow\n(ph) and the name of the family to this day remains Desow (ph) and he told me when we met by\nchance a couple of years ago, that, uh, I was always dressed in brown, for some reason my\nmother always thought that brown suited me well, uh, and of course a very unharmonious\nrelationship between me and the color brown , | can't stand it, but that is how\nit was imposed on you, so I even dressed up in brown, what do you call it, special weaving, uh...",
        "A: I don't know, it's some kind of brown, uh, well most of us either wore blue or gray, or what\nnot, but I wore brown. This guy from Desow(ph) he once came home and asked his mother,\nTammy(ph), what is being Jew and then the mother said, well Jew, she didn't say Jewish like\nyou, no, no, she said well the Jew, this is like Putnik. So, now I understand he said,\nthe Jews are those who walk around with thier brown outfits. Anyhow, from that school I\ngraduated into the Jewish school of the fine arts, by the way, also been a pupil, uh, and later I\nwent to, we ought to now reach 1940, uh, 1940. I finished the other school which was a\nremarkable free school and then I joined the Sengre(ph), the Sengre School, one of the best in\nCoopenhagen, by the way, where the master, the chief, rector, whatever they are called was\nmarried to a Jewish woman who had been my father's teacher in the Jewish school. You know\nit's a very, very small community, both the Jewish and the non-Jewish community are very\ninterwoven. At any rate, so I, this was 1943 I joined this school,",
        "A: This was after the Germans in 1940 had occupied Denmark.",
        "A: Well, you know, interesting that they Germans made a deal with the Danish Government. So,\nwhen the German occupation was rather non-violent a few Danish soliders put up resistance\nbecause they didn't want to listen to the orders from the superiors to lay down their arms. But in\nJanisport(ph) when the Germans just marched into neutral Denmark and Denmark had to know\nthat of course they could provide heroes, get heroes had they fought. But they had no political or\nmilitary power to assist the Danish, the German occupation forces. Demark succumbed, made a\ndeal with the Germans, a deal by the way which is of great significance to our life as Jews\nbecause that set us apart from the rest of the Jewish community in Europe, occupied Europe,\nbecause the made a deal with the Germans based on a kind of mutual respect, so to\nsay, Sharing of, sharing of authority. The Danes(ph) got permission from the Germans to go on\nwith their normal lives. Political parties were non-functioning, the parliament went on giving\nlaws, the government was inside, the King was riding through the town followed by a crowd of\nschool children on his horseback and so to say for most days in these years, the first years of the\noccupation, life was relatively normal, of course we were effected by the war and by the supply\nsituation, but basically the Germans let the Danes(ph), you know, keep to themselves and run\ntheir own lives. We had two, we had two free parliamentary elections Denmark\nduring the German occupation and the last one, the Nazi party, was simply trashed and the\nGermans didn't, didn't interfere. The Germans on their side of course wanted the Danes(ph) to\nlet the Germans go on, so to say, building fortresses along the west coast to protect against a\npossible allied invasion and Denmark was supposed to be kind of supplying people for the\nGermans so the last part of the agricultural production(ph) went to the German army and the last\npart of the industrial production went to, so Denmark as a matter of fact became kind of\nunwilling, but still partner to the German war effort, one has to admit that, but this, sorry yes...",
        "A: no, no, no...",
        "A: Well the Danish government, this of course we did not know, but we know today. The\nDanish government told the Germans that there were a number of red lines which the Germans\nwere supposed to respect in order to protect Danish sovreignty. One of the red lines was that no\ndistinction between Danish citizens. Meaning that no special anti-Jewish legislation, no\ninterference with Jewish life at the synagogue, the synagogues were operating the schools, were\noperating the old age homes, whatever you had so the structure of the Jewish community\nremained untouched by the German occupation until a certain moment of course, which was the\nfamous day of 29th of August 1943. I want to just relate one thing, of course the Jews knew\nabout what was on in Europe, but vaguely, you know we didn't even know in 1942, in\nSeptember, October the Germans had arrested the majority of the Norwegian Jews, although we\nwere related to the community, intermarriage between the communities and youthful activities,\nwe didn't know because we kind of lived in empty space, we didn't have information. We could\nhear pbc of course, but pbc didn't know much about the holocaust either until 1943, we didn't\nknow about the Warsaw Ghetto for instance, and the allies did not consider this a very important\nitem in the news broadcasting, so we lived as a matter of fact in a fools paradise. Being\npersuaded to believe that the normal life we lived could continue without end. In the Danish\ncommunity, by the way, was influenced by the Danish patricians, the Danish officials went on\ntelling us, don't be afraid, we'll protect you because we have told the Germans if they touch the\nJews this is what you call , this would be cause for war and then we would\nresign and the Germans would have to run the country. The Germans at that time did not\nnecessarily have the desire to turn this country which was serving their ends into a hostile\ncountry which they would have to occupy with tens of thousands of soldiers which they needed\nsomewhere else. So there was kind of a balance based on communal interest, the Danish wanted\nto run the country safely out of the war the Germans wanted to have as much peace as possible to\nconcentrate their efforts in another front.",
        "A: I wanted to come to this because one of the things that was posted on us was not to get\ninvolved with the emerging resistance, don't get the resistance started, acting to be a\npopular movement only after the mid or end 1943. Until then resistance was some groups\ncommitting small sabotage acts, publishing newspapers, but it was not something which the\nGermans at all felt threatened by, not at all. Maybe it consisted of a few hundred Danish people,\nbut didn't want to enjoy the benefits of this Danish-German agreement. People\nbother, but they have no effect on the German war effort. So, we were told don't join them.\nNow I was at that time at the age of 15 and of course I joined them. If people told me not to do it\nand it happened so that the famous communist , It was a schoolmate of\nmine. We started selling illegal newspapers and books published by the emerging resistance in\norder to finance their activities, they sold these books to underground of course, it was banned by\nthe Germans, banned by the authorities, by the censor, the Danes had a post on Denmark. The\nDanes in order to prevent annoying the Germans too much, so one of the books I remember was\nby John Steinbeck. He was a part of the German occupation of Norway with me. He write, not a\nvery sophisticated book, what it was, it served the purpose of these times. So, we were\nand of course the first thing you did was to settle to your family, but at any rate\nthis was discolored by my father who was a member of the Jewish, one of the Jewish community\nagencies, member of the board or something. So of course he was more exposed(ph) than others\nbecause the Germans, as you know, that there had been always before going for the Jews in the\ncommunity to take all the members of the leadership of the community simply to deprive the rest\nof the Jews from any leadership. This is the way they used to handle it. So my father was very\nunnerved, you've got to do this because that might put me, the family, the community in a very\nsensitive dangerous position. And I didn't want to listen to my father and he of course, what do\nyou do, you call the chief Rabbi. At that time chief Rabbis were not administrators of\ncommunity affairs. They were people, imposing people with beards, you know and supposed to\nharbor a certain amount of wisdom. So I was told to go to the chief Rabbi.",
        "A: His name was Max Fleetiger(ph). He was originally from Hungary. He spoke in the Danish\nlanguage, but of course speaking with a heavy Hungarian accent. Later he was taken by the\nGermans and brought to a concentration camp and survived and came back\ninto the community again. But, I still remember, there are some parts in history which you\nremember vividly where you are standing or sitting with the other guy, like the story with the\ntyping, I remember that I was asked to sit down. I was standing up and he was sitting behind a\nhuge desk with his , his and had a beard like or square,\nlong beard, very well groomed, but you know. They told me that they, he ordered me to give up\nall this playing around and he said, I remember this today, if you don't give it up, you and others\nof your sort, you know, will risk the welfare of the Jewish community because if the Germans\ncatch you or the Danes catch you revenge might be taken and that might put the whole safety of\nour community in danger. So, give it up. The moment that you have been told that you have the\nresponsibility for a whole community and you're only fifteen years old, of course you'll give it\nup. So I went home and I burnt, and burnt all that was left of the illegal books and newspapers\nand so on. That must have been immediately before the trip to or immediately\nafter. But you know that in 1943, August there was a clash between the Danes and the German\ninterest and to put it shortly the Danes resigned and the Danish Government retired and the\nParliament went home the King went into exile in his castle and the Shee(ph) which has\nprotected us from German encroachment was removed overnight. Suddenly there were only\nGermans and us. The Germans didn't have to anymore consider this deal about you stick to your\nthings and we'll stick to our things and the Jewish we are leaving behind. So at that time, 1943\nAugust, about half of the Jewish community of Europe had been destroyed by the holocaust. We\ndidn't know a thing, we didn't prepare a thing, the community did not try to build up kind of\nwork preparing us. We were ==, we were____, I remember my father went\nto the Director of the Foreign Ministry, during these days, of course we had a feeling that the\nsituation had changed dramatically and that of course would change our situation, but we just\ndidn't know how and he went to the Director of Foreign Ministry, who was living in the\nneighboring house and he asked me what's new so he said, don't worry, I have contact with the\nGermans all of the time and if anything is cropping up, we will warn you, don't worry. Well, of\ncourse something cropped up, mainly the German Nazi against the Jews on the 2nd of October\nand he never warned us. I just want to tell in brackets a little human angle. We escaped of\ncourse and came back a couple of years(ph) later from Sweden and right after our return my\nparents sent this, by then had retired, a big bunch of flowers saying, don't worry,\nyou didn't warn us but we got away and safely we came back. Now, whether they heard\nanything from me or not, I don't know, it was a very, very difficult situation of course, being\nfaced with this old preach of promise. But many, many years later when I was serving as chief\neditor of the Danish daily newspaper called, Put___,(ph) maybe 50 years later...and one of our\nstaff members aboard the 22 union(ph) it was not very easy because he sort of wanted to stay out\nof the limelight. I called him and asked him to make an exception and our reporter.\nHe said, well I'll tell you one thing, there's one bunch of flowers I received one night which I will\nnever forget. These were the flowers which your parents sent me in 1945 after you came back\nfrom refuge in Sweden. It meant a lot to him that some people were trying to forgive him for\nhaving broken his promise. Which of course could have cost us our lives, of course. At any rate,\nso the Danish underground movement started becoming more and more of a nuisance to the\nGermans. At one point the Germans wanted the Danish Government, the Danish authorities had\ncontrol over the Danish army, the Danish police, everything was in place. The Germans wanted\nthe Danes to take steps in order to crush the underground movement and to the Jews\nthey sentenced for sabotage of court(ph) and so on and so forth. Well it's a long story, but the\nDanes refused the whole set up, so to say once abolished(ph) and the Germans were sitting with\nthe mark in their hands and . Then come September, September month and\nsomebody else was figuring on what happened politically, especially on the German scene(ph)\nwith regard to our situation as Jews in Denmark. But suffice here to say that the Germans\ndecided to extend the Jewish repression to Danish Jews, about 6,000 maybe 7,000 we were at\nthat time and they ordered three ships to come from Germany and anchor in Copenhagen\npreparing to take us and a group of communists who had been imprisoned by the Danish\nauthorities who had not yet been released, not succeeded in being released when the authorities\nwent home. So the Germans simply arrested them as one of the most, most\ndishonorable, dishonorable events in modern day history, by the way. Of course they were\narrested and kept against the constitution. Anyhow, the ships were prepared to take 7,000 Jews\nand a few hundred communists to Germany or to Poland, whatever they planned to do. But then\nsomething happened which enabled us to be warned beforehand and just shortly a warning came\nfrom the German who was the head of the German occupation authorities in\nDenmark. His name was Wern Best(ph), Wern with a '\"W\", Best, B-E-S-T and he instigated the\nentire Jewish activities by advising Hitler that now was the time after the Danish-German\ncooperation had collapsed, now was the time to go for the Jews. But for his own reasons, which\nis a very complicated matter, I don't want to go into too many details because people are much\nmore versed into the details than I am. For his own reasons, he let the secret slip out and told\none of his collaborators in the German, in the German embassy . A fellow who\nwas a Nazi too, his name was Tuckawitz, T-U-C-K-A-W-I-T-Z, Tuckawitz, told about the\napproaching, German, German, action, I guess the Jews...Now this Tuckawitz, by the way, was a\nmember of the German Nazi party, an early member of the Nazi party. Best was much earlier,\nBest was one of the evil spirits of the police department of the emerging Nazi party even before\nthe two powers divides(ph) into three. Really, really a war criminal. He was not ever\ncondemned to death, he should have been, for the reason that he let the secret slip and this was\nused by his defense to protect him against a life sentence after, death sentence after the war. But\nTuckawitz was kind of a reformed Nazi and he became close, he was a neighbor,\ncommercial, commercial. He had been with Camaris the head of the German\nintelligence. Camaris, C-A-M-A-R-I-S who is by the way execute(ph)\nby the Nazis. He had been with him at this job at the German embassy and was to prepare the\nGerman occupation of Denmark in 1940. But he remained here and established very close\ncontact with the leaderships of the socialcratic party and became embarked with them and started\nto distancing himself from the Nazi ideology. Of course especially the anti-Jewish part of it and\nthat when Best tipped him off saying that this day the of the Jews will take place\nand Best is quoted by Tuckawitz by the way, after the war. In racial talk or what German\nto the station. Tuckawitz quoted Best as saying, \"I wish we could build a bridge\nacross the south between Denmark and Sweden to aid these poor people to get safely away.\" We\nnever, we never know if Tuckawitz invented this, there's no motive for his having to invent it,\nbut there's no third witness. You only have his word for it that Best didn't say it(ph), not because\nhe loved(ph) Jews, he had been spending half his year fighting Jews, killing Jews. But his didn't\nfind that it was in his best interests that particular moment of history where everything was going\nagainst the German, the German arms, after the invasion of Italy. After the collapse of the\nGerman, the German military that fought in the Stantengard(ph) in Eastern Russia, in\nRussia. It was not for his, in his\ninterests that this anti-Jewish action should secede, that's why he told it to Tuckawitz who\nimmediately informed the German, the Danish social-democratic(ph) leaders, who immediately\nwent to the head of the Jewish community, a very respectable and respective lawyer of the high\ncourt called C.B. Pedricus(ph), a famous Jewish name. And they went to him\nand told him, okay, now you better prepare for something because there are only a couple of\ndays left. And it's very interesting, it has to be remembered because part of the Disney Land\natmosphere which we lived, they were killing Jews all over, all around us. From Norway and all\nthrough the continent and we thought that we would go Scot-free and didn't prepare for anything.\nThe Jewish community and leadership didn't even destroy the index of names and addresses of\nthe Jewish community. The Germans came one day and confiscated it. Still this was not enough\nfor us, so start moving, you know. And this guy in and the Danish\npolitical(ph) leaders, to want him(ph), they said, Mr. Hedtoft, H-E-D-T-O-F-T, Mr.\nHedtoft, later became the prime minister of Denmark after the war. He said, you are lying, he\nsaid well Hedtoft told him that he had a good source and that the game was up. You are lying.\nAnd Hedtoft almost broke out in tears because he was facing the war(ph) and the war(ph) didn't\nrespond. But they succeeded after a while at making them understand that this was a serious\nmatter and then out went the warning, the telephone chain as they called it, from one Jewish\nfamily to another that tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, don't stay at home because the\nGermans will come after us. Where you go, everybody was on his own. The community had not\nprepare any escape route or any escape organization, nope, nothing.",
        "A: My father, yes, my father heard this from somebody who had called him, who had been to\nmorning prayers in the synagogue on September 13th I think. And he came home, I was in\nschool, you know, we went on acting as if life was normal, you know, and as if we were as\nDanish as the Danes; which to some extent we were, at least in the eyes of the Danes, but not in\nthe eyes of the Germans of course. By the way there was no yellow star, you know, there were\nno, there were no special legislation introduced by the Germans as regards to the Jewish part of\nthe Danish community, Danish population. I went to school early in the morning, maybe at ten\no'clock or so, the headmaster came in and he said, \"I'm sorry but you and you,\" he said, \"you\nbetter come out, I have something to tell you in the corridor.\" And I remember that suddenly we\ngot up from our desks and were following him. Suddenly he turned around again and he said to\nthe teacher, \"you better come with me too.\" The teacher was also a part Jewish and\nthen the fade away(ph). But you know, at that time, I was fifteen, I was fifteen\nyears old I must have been, you know, retarded because I didn't understand anything at all,\nbecause we didn't speak about these things at home.",
        "A: I was not afraid. You know I remember I took the tram(ph) and I went to Keyosk(ph) to buy\nthe weekly magazines as I have done every week and I still remember I came with the weekly\nmagazine sitting under my arms. My parents, the door was wide , my parents were\nwaiting all dressed up, you know, over coat, why it was winter(ph), October, and said, \"hurry up,\nwe have to get away.\" And that's what we got because we...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "A: Well, as a matter of fact I am the first generation born in Denmark. My father's side the\nfamily came just after the turn of the century from Ukraine, a town called Romney. Which is\nquite a famous town in Jewish history because a guy named Toebetor, who became a hero in the\nPalestine fighting(ph) with the Arab's(ph) back in the 20's came from there. Another guy called\nRotenbeck(ph) who made the first project for electrification(ph) of Palestine there.\nMy, , the first group of chim(ph) agricultural pioneers came from the same\nsmall town called Romney and they settled at the canya(ph) and they formed the first\n. Now my grandfather was what they call a kabaducmaha(ph). That means\na...do you know what that is? Well, he made hats, caps. And he told me when I was a young\nman and I asked him why did you leave Romney, why did you run away from Russia, the\nUkraine. He said that there was a in Romney around 1903 or 4, there was a whole\nempetamy(ph) of good programs at that time the collection(ph) with the defeat of\nRussians to the Russian-Japanese war. And this Romney was a little influential town where half\nof the population was Jewish, many of them were artisans, as my grandfather and he and a\nnumber of friends lived in a square, farm-like building on the outskirts of the town. And he told\nme that just before the pulcrum(ph) erupted a Russian officer came to him and he was from the\nCossack brigade and told him that you come with him and take his family. And you know at that\ntime you didn't ask why when an officer told you, so he took the family and they walked to the\nhouse of the officer and he said you stay here. And just right after the pulcrum(ph) erupted many\nJews were killed some of the work staff(ph) in this farm-like building where my grandfather had\nhis works were burned and after the pulcrum the officer took my grandfather back to the place\nand on the way he asked him, \"why did you save me and my family?\" and the officer said, \"well\nJew, that's because you make such wonderful hats for my soldiers.\" And my grandfather who\nhadn't finished any main(ph) university or any higher education he just knew that to survive that\nif the future of his family was dependent on his hats fit square with the soldiers heads then he\nbetter get out as quick as possible. So the pack(ph) that was left and of course they\nwere on their way to America, like most Jews, millions of Jews during these years went to\nAmerica. Being poor people the money quickly was spent when the in Germany\nthey had no more money to pay for their passage across the Atlantic. So they made up their\nmind to go to some place called Denmark. Why Denmark, because my grandmother had a\nbrother who had immigrated earlier to Denmark and he had sent some postcards saying that it\nwas not a bad country. So the thoughts in their heads were let's go where the money reached, the\nmoney took them to Gomain(ph), that was, as I said around 1905 or 6 or something. And they\nsettled down in one of the poorest quarters of Copenhagen, which today of course is Bohem(ph)\nquarter and were renovated(ph) slum houses. It was, but they went there because it was Jewish\ndistrict and they could meet people which spoke their language, which was not Russian it was\nYettish, they were not Russian speakers. And they could somehow repeat and rebuild to some\nextent the medium(ph) in which they had lived.",
        "A: Well, that's what I want to add. Another reason why they went their was that it was not far\naway, within walking distance from the synagogue. For them the synagogue was the center in\ntheir lives, both the religious life and the sacred(ph) life they lived.",
        "A: Well it was, it was the synagogue which belonged to the Uta(ph) orthodox and the community\nwhich was built around that time. , It was not at that time as far as my\ngrandfather goes, the big synagogue which had the kind of modernistic service, although it's\nconservative. He looked for his people and they were at this small synagogue.\nOf course, the , my father's generation they left the synagogue and joined the\nlarge, more modern synagogue. But this was kind of an intimate relationship with\nreligion. By the way this relationship with religion didn't last for long because my grandfather of\ncourse was very religious, he was also a small bearded fellow, my father didn't of course, he\nshaved and he was observant but not orthodox and the third generation intermarried\nand in a few cases were not Jews or became non-observant. But still of course were some\nhang(ph) for tradition, you know, they speak about two kinds of Jews: they speak about\nBalkhudan(ph); means Jews whose sits in the stomach, gives\nJews and the other group is called; alkhudan, which means that they are also Jews. But at any\nrate, so they settled there, and of course at that time they were three children, one of them that\nimmigrated was my father. He was at that time he was maybe 5, 6, 7 years old. They were\nimmediately sent to school. And here starts the immediate integration into Danish society\nbecause of this school was a Jewish school was formed by a Jew of Danish origin who saw that\nthese immigrants who came from Poland, from Russia at the turn of the century. They had to\nbecome Danes quickly, he didn't mind if they would stay Jewish as far as religious observances,\nbut he wanted them integrate us as quickly as possible into the Danish social life. Simply in\norder to protect the community that was there from rotten shoulders cold(ph)\nreligionist who sort of say would be looked at with hostility from the Danish environment\nbecause they were unobservant. So this was a great lack of the Danish-Jewish community that\nthey would provide services that would immediately channel them into the Danish society.\nLearning language, getting ready for Danish career.",
        "A: He continued, sure he continued as a hat maker and my father when he was at the age of 9, 10\nyears old when he came back from school, everyday he would have to take a case with hats, 6\npenses, you know, and go in the harbor of Copenhagen. At that time Copenhagen was very, very\ndynamic harbor town, which it is not today, and to sell six penses to the sailors and to the harbor,\nport workers and so on. From that time my father had a deep feeling of gratitude to the Danish\nworking class. Which put a little attitude so that he, although it became what you\nwould call industrially started capitalism, he went on continued voting for social democrats\nbecause as he always told me, these people, you can match a little Yettish speaking boy looking\nstrange with this Danish were Danish of course, but two or three years\nin the country, walking around the harbor with a box of 6 penses trying to peddle them to the\nDanish workers. He could feel rejected by them and the country, so he had a very, since then, he\nso to say P [person's name] admired the Jews to politics and he became very, very\ngenerous as a donor for all kinds of Jewish and non-Jewish causes because he felt that he owed\nthese people something. By the way, jumping out a bit, but when they later built a very large and\nmodern textile factory in Copenhagen he was one of the first Danish industrialists to attend to the\nneeds of the workers. Providing for instance, kindergarten for the workers who\ncouldn't leave home or find a place in the public service and a building one of the best, beautiful\ncanteens facing a garden so that they could relax. He was, he didn't know that he was\nprogressive, but he acted in a very progressive way out of purely sentimental reasons. At any\nrate, so they settled here, and of course I'm not telling you anything that you don't know, because\nit's sort of kind of a replica of what happened to many Jews who came to the east coast of\nAmerica as immigrants from the same areas. That they put learning very high because they\nknew, for two reasons. Learning was part of the Jewish tradition, of course. The religious\ntradition, where all, all children quickly at the age of 3 or 4 years went to Torah(ph)\nschool and learned to read. Read Hebrew letters, so of course this was pretty converted also so\nthe desire to learn other things, other written languages but Hebrew. That was one thing, the\nrespect for the book and the respect for the language. And secondly of course we learned that if\nyou want to kind of upward mobility in society, you had to study. So my father couldn't afford it\nbecause he was the eldest so he had to go out and help the parents make a living, so the others\ncould afford to study. But the second boy in the family became an engineer and living\ngreat desires. And he became one of the very first immigrant boys who graduated\nfrom the university. So very quickly they started moving into society. Then of course came the\nfirst World War, 1914. Denmark was, as you know, a neutral country and there was kind of an\neconomic boom, prosperity in Denmark because it was neutral. Of course it exploited the\npossibilities it had by supplying the warring(ph) states with what they needed. There was Danish\nmilitary mobilization to protect the neutrality of Denmark and of course these soldiers they\nneeded hats and they needed uniforms and so on. And the Jewish didn't know anything about a 7\nor 8 day work week, you know, a 7 or 8 hour work week. They worked as much, as long as they\nneeded to provide, to supply those that gave them to consignments. They started establishing\nthemselves and moving from this very poor street to this street in the same neighborhood which\nwas a little bit less poorer, and I have a list at home which one of my uncles made where he\nnoted all of the addresses within the first couple of years. It was tremendous, this was kind of\nmigrant population. they had more money, they got another child, they moved into a\nflat with a half room more, bedroom more, that's how they slowly, slowly progressed and moved\ninto more boudoir quarters and became, as a matter of fact part of the Danish middle class.\nWithin probably the early 30's they had become middle class.",
        "A: No, no, when the moment they moved out of the poor quarter, of course they moved into the\nmiddle, they used the Danish community. I wouldn't say that they had lots of social contact with\nthem of course, because still their religion and the synagogue was, so to say, the axis of their life.\nBut of course, there were 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, there were 8 children and of course the children reached\nout towards Danish society. You probably had the same effect that you have today, many\nDanish girls attempted to strike up relationships with types from the Mediterranean and these\nwere not Mediterranean's, but they were exotic at least. And Denmark at that time was a very,\nvery homogenous society and when these young Jews came to Copenhagen, they were attractive\nand exotic. By the way many of them married non-Jewish, already(ph) in the first generation.",
        "A: You know, you know what happens, I don't know if this is pattern, but anyhow in my\nexperience is that there are several phases. One of the phases, one is a phase of shock. The\nsecond is the phase of slowly adapting but not reestablishing contacts. The third phase is when\nthe first child is born and then the whole bloody thing breaks down, you know you can't, then\nrelations are reestablished and everybody's is happy. But at any rate, I just want to\ngo back for one moment to this Romney, I tried to visit it during the communist times before\nGorbachev and before the break down of the soviet system. I went with a friend, a Russian\nspeaking friend, and we went to Kiev(ph) and we asked if anybody would take us to this place\nwhich is about 150 kilometers from Romney and everybody shied away and said, no you need a\nspecial permit, this is a closed country. So we found a very unhappy driver, unhappy because he\nwas deeply indebt for playing some kind of, I don't know, hasard(ph) or whatever it was. One of\nhis other friends, and couldn't pay his debt to the people who he owed money, they were people,\nvery strong armed people. One of his friends had to explain to us, we should jump out of the\nwindow because was jumping himself or being thrown out of the window, so he\nwanted to make money. You know, at any costs, so he decided that it was worth to run the risk\nand take us without permission to Romney and during the trip he turned to us and said, this\nfriend of yours who speaks perfect Russian, they're Danish Jew, by the way, but born in Russia,\nhe was a corespondent of the Danish state journalist in Moscow. He said that this guy is from\nthe KGB, so we said why should he be from the KGB? Well, he speaks such perfect Russian,\nhe's just posing as a Danish journalist. But after just a few miles, the guy turns around and he\nsaid to us, \"gee\" he said, \"I'm sorry, I made a mistake he's not from the KGB.\" And we said,\n\"how do you know by now\" and he said, \"look out through the back window\" and we looked out\nand there was a car following us, he said, \"these are the KGB's.\" And they really followed us all\nthe way from Kiev(ph) about 150 kilometers to the outskirts of the town Baneso(ph) the sign\nboard spelling Romney, then they jumped at us, they stopped our progress and we had to go out,\nwe had to sign documents and there was investigation and what not. Later we complained to the\nRussian foreign minister, of course, didn't help. I asked one of the Russians to take me, how\nlong to keep this place closed. He said, \"well as long as you\nwant to visit it, it remains closed.\" There must have been some military reasons, reasons for it.\nAnyhow, now of course, the town, I wanted to see. Maybe because of family, maybe because of\ncemetery, maybe because of the synagogue. I just wanted, for several reasons, to see the place\nwhere my father had been born. But now, of course, everybody can go there, but now I'm not\nvery attracted by it anymore. It was the prohibition that was attractive apparently. But anyhow,\nfrom this town, originally the first group that formed the first collective settlement keboots(ph) in\nPalestine at that time, later Israel. That was around 1908, or something of that close, maybe\n1909. But I asked my grandfather, why didn't you join them, you were the same age group and\nyou had to leave your town anyhow? Why did you have to take this long route around\nCopenhagen and what not, just for me 50 odd years afterwards to have to rise and go to Zion(ph),\nyou know, all the troubles. We could have landed there earlier, be part of the aristocracy. So he\nsaid, \"are you crazy,\" I would never have guessed this, he said, \"do you think that I would have\njoined a gang where the Tracy Malicker(ph),\" it's a Yettish, it's a Yettish derivation of\nMelcher(ph) which is a female name in Hebrew, \"the Tracy Malicker, should I join these\nbarefoot people, you know, they walk around barefoot.\" It's true, that the first you\nknow, that they called them the \"ball fees(ph),\" the barefeet, because they were poor and they\nmade an issue about being puretanic(ph) and so. Well anyhow I decided that, well, they were\ncrazy we all could see that they were crazy, we all could see that they were crazy, you know. I\ndecided that I wanted to find out what this crazy Malicker(ph) had been doing and I called the\nkeeboots(ph) and they found out that this crazy Malicker(ph) who my grandfather didn't want to\njoin, she became one of the most prominent educators in the Palestine Zionist(ph) Keeboots(ph)\nmovement. But anyhow, to jump ahead, we, my grandfather, became retired and my father\nstarted working at the Petlier(ph), the famous 7 , you know. They only went to\nschool for 7 years at that time and he became a statesman(ph)[possibly \"salesman\" and he passed\nthe career which, you know, the marriage of Jewish immigrants, he started as an employee, as a\nstatesman, he became independent(ph) statesman and by the year, he was traveling very much in\nScandinavia, some place else that the I have been living commuting between Denmark and Israel\nfor thirty years 1s part of the inheritance from my father. Every Sunday I met my dad, we wished\nhim well, and he went to the railway station and either went to Days(ph) Provinces, or he went to\nSweden, or Finland to make a living. He came back Friday went to the Synagogue in the\nevening, had to, back at home and on Sunday off they went again. In the mean\ntime, he got married. My mother's family came originally from Poland, when she was a couple\nof years old they settled in Litic(ph). I'm sure I inherited some of the adventurous spirit of that\npart of the family because my grandfather, my great-grandfather...",
        "A: In the late ages they immigrated from Poland to America and came back and\nsettled in Litic(ph). He called his family from Poland to Litic(ph), Litic(ph) is in Germany.\nThey became American citizens because he was naturalized as an American. I still have at home\na fantastic picture where you see the old man all dressed up, you know, on the day that he\nbecame an American citizen. That must have been a glorious day in his life. Anyhow, from that\nmoment the family was American. They were American citizens, but residing in Germany.\nNow when the war started, the first World War, they of course, as American citizens, had to\nleave Germany, go to a neutral country. So they went to Denmark. And they stayed throughout\nthe war years in Denmark. And they had a couple of beautiful daughters and they were very\nrespected in the community. And after the war they\nreturned to Litic(ph), but they left the kind of impression on the Danish community here. So\nwhen my father came of age and was supposed to find a wife to settle down, some people in the\ncommunity, \"well, ===~\u2014\u2014\u2014~\u2014~\u2014~\u2014_\u2014s a very nice family from Litic(ph) and they had two beautiful\ndaughters, go and take a look.\" So my father went, went to Litic(ph), and that must have been\n1925 or 6 and they married and my mother joined, of course, my father in Copenhagen. And that\nis how, how a nuclear family so to say, came to Denmark. One from Russia, one from Poland,\nby America and Litic(ph) and they settled down in Copenhagen. I was born in 1927. This is\nmore or less the origin of the family. In 1933 they left the rest of the family, my grandparents\nand left Litic(ph) and they immigrated to America where some of their boys already\nhad gotten, became very American patriotic, you know they served, the boys, in the second\nWorld War, the army, the navy and so on. Very Americanized.",
        "A: Originally it was Takletaub(ph). It's not an unusual Jewish name, Takletaub(ph).\nTakletaub(ph) is the name of a certain kind of a dove, pigeon. But they abbreviated \"tove\" to\n\"taub,\" t-a-u-b. This was more, I just want to say one funny thing about my grandfather on my\nmother's side. He was very, very strict and stubborn. He's remembered as a disciplinary in the\nfamily. One of these autocratic, patriotic types, who could never do wrong, and if he ever did do\nwrong, he could never admit it. My mother told me one particular case, he was supposed to go\nsome place in Europe from Litic (ph) the family took him to the train and they waved at him\ngood-bye and he sat down and they were very , they were very unemotional. So they\nnever stood in the window of the train waving good-bye, they simply, when they put out the\nwindow and took out the newspaper they could on the platform, you know, looking\nat the family patriarch leaving. But what happened that day was, he went onto the wrong train\nand instead of going to Paris, he ended up in Prague and he could never admit it because had he\nchanged in the meantime, you know, half way, then of course it would be ridiculous. So from\nthat moment he pretended that as a matter of fact he was supposed to go to Prague while the\npeople were waiting for him in Paris. So, anyhow, so they settled and they got, my\nparents, got three children. Besides me, my brother and my sister. My brother was killed by an\naccident in 1946. My sister immigrated, 7 years we immigrated in 1954. To Israel(ph) where\nshe married and lives today, has three children. That is more or less as far as I remember the\nrelative background...",
        "A: I was the oldest, yes.",
        "A: Well I, I did go to Jewish day, the first five, the first day school...",
        "A: ...this I don't remember.",
        "A: But I had went to the first elementary class, is the first 5 elementary school years. I went to a\nprivate school in the area where we lived. One of the snobbish schools in Copenhagen. But this\nwas part of the, not because my parents were snobs, but they wanted me to have a good\neducation and succeed. They wanted you quickly to join, to join the rush. So they put you in the\nbest school available.",
        "A: Of course, Denmark was, since the Jews got citizenship, they were totally equal there. Of\ncourse there were Danes who didn't like Jews but there was not anti-Semitism in Denmark. I\nalways distinguish between societies where you have anti-Semites and societies where you have\nanti-Semitism. In Denmark you have anti-Semites, the individuals but you never had a trend or a\nmovement of this kind. Even the Nazis when they formed a political party were very weak on\nthe anti-Semitic stuff because they knew that this would reject some of their potential followers.\nYou know, Jewish-Denmark for the last 150 years had been, there's been a kind of, you know,\nwhat do you call, these tries(ph) children pay(ph) within circuses, you know up and down, up\nand down mountain rides, you know, you had...",
        "A: A roller coaster, that's right, sorry, a roller coaster. You had immigration, then the people\nwho were after acclimatized(ph), they assimilated within a couple of generations. The Jews\nalmost were extinguished as community, then a new wave of immigrants came; so came up and\ndown, up and down. Today we hadn't had an immigration in 1969 of Polish-Jews, a couple\nthousand Pol-Jews, the Danish community, the Jewish community would be very, very weak\nbecause similar to what happened in some of the states of America. You have a integration rate\nor assimilation rate or intermarriage rate, call 1t what you want for more than 50, 60 percent. So\nif no more Jews will arrive in Denmark or the next generation than the two Jew races, the two\nother year, two other century old history of Danish Jews would more or less be concluded.",
        "A: We were of course, we were observant at home.",
        "A: I beg your pardon...",
        "A: Of course, yes. I walked to Synagogue every Saturday an hour walk with my father. Later of\ncourse, the chief Rabbi realized that he had to choose either between letting the Jews take the\ntram or the subway to Synagogue, or they wouldn't go to synagogue. So they released the Jews,\nfrom the Jews to walk, and he permitted them under the condition that they had bought tickets\nthe day before, he permitted them to drive to Synagogue. By this, so to say, he saved the\ncommunity from extinction. At any rate, I remember I was not supposed to go to school on the\nholidays or on the . I was in the beginning when I was not supposed to wear anything,\nmy pockets, you know. I remember that I wore, what they call abachafaut(ph), which is kind of\ncloth which you wear under your, on your skin with four tetsiut(ph) applied, you know. This\nwas a religious garment and I wore this as a child. You can imagine that when we had physical\ntraining lessons in school and they discovered that this guy wore some very strange things under\nhis underwear. But it gave me a feeling of identity and I survived whatever it might have been\non funny remarks. And this ties up with a story that I want to tell you which happened to me\nduring the same period when I went to this elementary, non-Jewish school. Well one thing I\nremember very, very strongly that was one anti-Semitic incident in school.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",
        "A: Anyhow, I remember when we took a taxi out to hide with a friend of my father's, a business\nfriend, of course, non-Jewish couple. And I was later told by my mother, years after that the\ndriver of the taxi refused to take money for the trip. At that time this was the first sign of some\nkind of, say, popular resistance coming to the aid of the Danes. You know, people were warned\nby neighbors, by Jewish families to just leave their homes. But there were moving details, you\nknow, some Jews who took hiding into the woods because they had no where to go. There was a\nbotanical garden in the center of Copenhagen just across from one of the large municipal hospital\nand the doctors and nurses during the day went out and searched for Jews hiding in the botanical\ngarden. People who didn't have business friends who they could turn to. I remember, one of my,\na friend of mine later at the university who became a member of parliament for the social\ndemocratic party, his father was head of the social democratic party organization in the center of\nCopenhagen and he simply recruited his son and a few other youngsters and he told them to go\nthrough each and every house, look at the name cards and when they see something that could be\nJewish, warn them and tell them to get away. At that time, already, lots of individual initiatives\nwere taken. There was no coordinating rule for organization. But the moment the people, non-\nJews realized that the Jews were in danger, than all kinds of initiatives were taken by individuals,\nby groups of people, by priests, by hospitals and so on. So, this particular case, whenever they\nmet a Jewish family, there were many Jewish families in this area here, especially poorer Jewish\nfamilies because it was at that time before the war restrictive, not so, no quality housing, I would\nsay to put it mildly. So they had been told, if you find a Jewish couple, tell them immediately to\ntake a taxi and go to Bespepyau(ph), Bespepyau Hospital, where they would be offered\nhospitality and put into hiding. One place he found another friend student of his a student, a\nfellow of his and they said, well it can't be, you know, that's how the Jewish reaction was to the\nunintelligible. Of course, it must be against nature. And again he\ntold me years later that it broke him to weeping, simply because...so then the father, the father\nsaid, you're my friends, you're my sons friends and if you say, we believe it and then to the\ncar(ph) and went out to the hospital. In one case he told me that he found an old, old lady and\ntook her to the hospital and suddenly she got a fit of hysterics...",
        "A: ...anxiety, that's right. She had forgotten the garments which she had prepared for her burial.",
        "A: The shroud, yes. She had forgotten this in her home and she insisted to go back to pick it up\nand there was a big commotion and the head of the rescue operation there(ph), who later became\nmayor, lord mayor of Copenhagen, he told my friend , | prohibit you to go back, it's\ndangerous, you must leave without the shroud, you know. Our friend still went back to pick up\nthe shroud and delivered it to her. There where lots of small incidents where people really\nshowed some kind of...",
        "A: sensitivity or empathy with the people who...anyway that's the story. The story is that night\nwe stayed with our friends, we couldn't stay more than one night at one place because, you\nknow. Now we know in retrospect that the Germans acted totally different than they acted in\nother occupied countries. But we had to prepare for the worst, so we had to make all kinds of\ndecisions because we believed that this was a serious matter for the Germans. Now we know\nthat they were all common interest in the German camp which enabled us to escape to Sweden,\nbut it's quite obvious that half the Germans acted with the same will power. The same, the same\norganizational talent which they used in prosecuting, persecuting Jews in other countries. Of\ncourse they would have caught us, but we didn't know so we had to act as if...by the way this is\nalso true for the Danes. After the war there was the inclination to say, well anyhow the Danes\nare not such great heroes, but the of the Danes were caught, those few that were\ncaught got two or three weeks of prison by the Danish authorities. You know, we still had\nDanish courts, we didn't have German courts. Looking at most of the Jews, only 500 were\narrested, the rest were . It's true that the conditions were in our favor and\nin the favor of the Danes who helped us to rescue. But one has to go back and look at the\nsituation as it were in as far as we could know and all the Danes who came to our help. They\nhad no reason to believe that they did not risk their lives. And in other countries like Poland,\nFrance, Germany and anybody hiding a Jew was stood up against the wall and shot. So I really\nthink that this was a very heroic chapter in Danish history. But we thousands of\nthings, well, could believe that they were ready to risk their lives and save the Jews. The fact\nthat they didn't(ph) do it comes, that we learn after the war. But this doesn't change the fact that\nthey were justified believing that they acted as heroes.",
        "A: They captured about 5 hundred and about 6,500 came over. Now in our case, we shifted from\nthe first hiding place to another. We went down the coast. This was like animals do looking for\nescape routes. You go by the smell, you know, and you go by instinct you went down to the\ncoast because the only place that you could hide, along the coast and hope to be able to get to the\nonly place that might receive you and protect you was Sweden. And the sound(ph) between\nDenmark and Sweden is not very wide, but it recovered by the distance from the Danish coast to\nSweden territory water could be covered by a quick boat in less than half an hour. But it was\nbeyond our imagination. There lies Denmark which is hidden in the darkness and just across this\nnarrow sound was neutral Sweden with lights and with chocolate and bananas and what not. But\nbegan to realize that there were people who were able to live another kind of life that\nwe were. But we went down to the coast hoping that we could escape this way of course and\nhapbeny(ph), the Swedish government who had, by the way, not been welcoming to Romney\nrefugees in 42's and early 43 issued a declaration during these H days welcoming all\nJews saying that they could come to Swedish protection. The fact is that the Swedish not only\nmade statements to that effect, but they also acted accordingly because Swedish patrol boats\nfrom the navy went out took the Swedish to the borderline and the moment that Danish boats\ncrossed this borderline the Swedish boats immediately came to protect them. So that in case that\nGermans, I mean, you had to account for all . In case a German patrol boat would\ntry to encroach on Swedish waters to catch a fleeing refugee boat the Swedes would simply\nintervene. But anyhow we went to the coast...",
        "A: It was a place called Sletten, S-L-E-double T-E-N, which is not far away. I mean very close,\nit's fishing, to the museum of Catipriod(ph) called Louisiana. Then we went to the fisherman\nwith whom we had stayed for years during our summer vacation, plus it was a rule that they\nsublet the houses to people from town, then they move into a house in the back yard, during\nthese two months of summer vacation. And of course he knew us well and he offered us\nhospitality that we could have wanted because he didn't use a telephone. We believed that this\nwas real, this was for real, you didn't use a telephone, you didn't speak to any strangers, you're\nafraid of moving on the roads because you were afraid of ending up in the arms of German\npatrol, there were Germans all over the place, soldiers mainly. Only later we know that the army\ndecided not to interfere, not to take part in the acts against the Jews. So the German army for its\nown reasons of interest did not allow for the Jews, wanted to protect the Jews, but simply for its\nown interests the German army only had one case that's known to have participated in this anti-\nJewish action. This was left to the police and the, what do you call it, the visheyesteins(ph), the\nwhat the German counter intelligence, whatever it is the, Estit(ph), it's called Estit(ph). So the\nvery fact that the army was all around didn't interfere. This we couldn't have known either. So\nwe took hiding at this place and one night he had negotiated with another fisherman to take us\nacross to Sweden. We were told that late at night to move across the coastal road and go down\nto the beach and wait under a small bridge to be picked up. We were standing there freezing, my\nparents, my father, my mother and my three sisters and brother and we heard the doc(ph),\ndoc(ph), doc, doc [sound of approaching boat], of the fishing boat approaching the docks of\ncourse the lights are on us. I mean today we're sitting in a warm room, this thing 50 years behind\nus, it's difficult to imagine a family all on its own alone, without any protection standing on a\nsmall wooden bridge looking into the water waiting for the doc, doc, doc, doc to come to pick\nthem up. But anyhow, the boat appears from the darkness and we are all already to jump at the\nboat and it simply passed by and it went to a bridge where another Jewish family was waiting\nand picked them up and off it went to Sweden. Of course we never learned what the reason was,\nmaybe these people could have paid them more money, maybe it was a mistake. I don't know,\nbut we were standing out there in the darkness without any alternative. So we returned to the\nfisherman and we really did not, my father was responsible for the family. These were times\nwhen the fathers felt responsible, he didn't know what to do, we all relied on the fisherman\ngetting some kind of connection which we could use in order to get out. Another night we spent\nat a large white house with lots of other refugees sitting in the dark sitting room, living room and\nthe specification, the student organization, while rowing us over, rowing, can you imagine,\nmaybe room for 2 or 3 people in these heavy wooden boats which they were taking from the\nfisherman, loaned from the fishermen rather. And I remember that when our turn came, the guy\nwho was supposed to row us over, this would take hours, I mean you could go by quick boat for\n30 minutes, but to be rowed over by one man that was very heavy(ph) going, two hours, and\ngoing for more than one trip was very difficult, but these were in the days that when the crisis\nwas really on these were the nice ones that knew that the Jewish were looking for us...",
        "A: The Germans, sorry, the Germans were looking for us. People got scared, the Germans were\nlooking for us. And suddenly the door opened, I remember this vividly because you are on the\nedge, you're on the way of getting out of this horrible thing. Then the guy, the student, who was\nsupposed to take us came in and we saw that blood was running down his palms and he said to\nmy parents so we had to go back to . Then the next day, suddenly the door bell rings,\nwe of course are like mice scurrying around hiding. I remember one of my brother hide a\nmy father had hidden under the bed. A very undignified situation today, it's very\nhard to remember. You know, that parents at that time were, had different stature(ph) then they\ndo today. For instance, in our dining room there was a father's chair and nobody would ever\ndream of sitting in father's chair even if he was away. Another thing that I remember so vividly\nis some very painful memory is that when we finally got on our way and found a reliable escape\nroute it was the day after. We run through a forest at night, single file of course, the father in\nfront. Suddenly my father slipped on a route or a branch and fell. This was the fall of, this was\nthe fall, suddenly seeing your father in this, he was always in control, the provider, the protector,\nsuddenly seeing him in a situation with this falling you know at the time when the whole family\nwas relying on him, you know, this is something which still today can give me the creeps. But at\nany rate, the door bell rang and the fisherman went out to answer the door, because in those days\nif you didn't open the door, they would break in. At any rate, if you didn't open the door, as I\nsaid, they would break them in. So he went out and opening the door and a voice asked, as we\nheard from inside, \"is the family Pundik here?\" Of course the fisherman says, \"no, no, no, I don't\nknow anything about Pundik, I haven't seen them since summer.\" My father recognized the\nvoice and he took a chance and said, \"yes we are.\" He took a chance because we were without\nand turned to chances. The guy comes in, another business friend of my fathers,\nwho by the way his son was collaborated with the German Nazis, a very strange situation. And\nthis guy, by the way, he way limping, walking with a stick. He had walked from Elsenor(ph)\nalong the coast knocking all doors available asking the same question, \"have you seen the Pundik\nfamily?\" He couldn't know if we had escaped already, but he simply, you know, that is the way\nthat people had to act it was a moral imperative for them to act, so he did this impossible thing\nand found a needle in the haystack. He went along the coast asking, he knocked on the door\nwhere we were and happily my father recognized the voice and said that I'll come get you tonight\nwhen it is dark in a doctor's car, in a physician's car was permitted by the Germans to move\naround freely came and picked us up and took us to his home. A place called Ultzgolden(ph)\nwhich is about 15 kilometer north of Elsenor(ph). He lived in a house facing the coastal road\nwhich was facing the sea. And at night, the next day he negotiated a deal with the fisherman, at\nthe night we were told to rush across the coastal road and go down to the sea. And there was a\nsmall rowboat waiting there for us, we jumped into the boat, there was a larger motor fishing\nboat waiting just a few hundred meters from the coast and we were rowed out to the fishing boat\nand I remember two things. I remember that I turned around and had a last look at Denmark and\non the beach were kneeling with their hands raised in a kind of praying position were the\nfisherman's wife and the follow who had saved us, my father's business friend and his wife, they\nwere believing(ph) people, praying. Another thing that I remember was maybe only that time I\nshowed a knack for journalism, I looked at my watch the moment the motor started operating\nand we were heading for Swedish territory waters and I remember that it took us exactly 37\nminutes to go from Denmark into safety to Swedish territory water. But some people, I want to\nconclude with a little anecdote, some people were not so lucky of course. One of my\npredecessors, is a chief of Puting(ph), was June(ph) Koppel, now I'll spell Koppel, K-0-double P-\nE-L and he was caught by the Germans while crossing the same coastal road. His wife who was\nnot Jewish got across and was down in the boat waiting for them, his two sons also, and he was\ncaught by a Gestapo car headlights. Caught the moment that he tried to escape and they took\nhim into the car and wrestled him and he was a fellow who was a off the Copenhagen\n. Even in difficult times, that while they were driving him off to Exenal(ph) to the\nprison, to the arrest house in Exenal(ph) one German Gestapo man turned around and says, vense\nhuden(ph), \"are you Jewish?\" and Mr. Koppel said, \"yes, and you?\" That's it.\n"
