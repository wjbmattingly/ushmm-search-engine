        "Q: Mr. Gierowitz, would you begin by telling me your name, where you were born and what year?",
        "A: My name is Natan Gierowitz, and I was born November 27, 1907, in a little called\n, which is not far from a larger Jewish community, Bialystok, in the vicinity of Bialystok. I\nwas raised by a grandfather. When I was three months old, my grandfather came and picked me up. My\nmother was a student at the University of Warsaw and was arrested for socialist activities against the\nCharles (ph) regime. Since three months old, I was raised by my grandfather. I never saw my mother. I\nsaw my father only once. That was in August, 1940. He was\u2014he escaped from Serbia, some slave labor\ncamp and stopped for a night. I remember, still remember some guy, some man asked me I should go to\nsleep with him that night. And I refused because I was sleeping\u2014at this time, I was sleeping with my\nstep-grandmother. My grandfather lost two wives, and that was a step-grandmother. I went to school, to\nthe public school in the city, and I became a troubled child. By 12 years old, 13 years old, I was already\nsmoking cigarettes. I would be after the girls in the high school. It was mixed. I remember I would go in\nthe toilets, the partitions, I would go up and look over and kind of\u2014so my grandfather was already\nwidowed. He lost his third wife. So he had a friend\u2014by the way, he was an attorney. He was an\nattorney. He was a very interesting human being, a big, heavy man. He was drinking a lot of tea, a lot\n. He had a friend, another attorney who suggested to do something with his grandchild.\nGermany has all kinds of institutions, which is a combination of school and . It\u2019s very strong\ndiscipline. You cannot go by yourself. It\u2019s like a military regime. And I was sent to Germany. I came to\nGermany. I was three years in Germany. I want to tell you that three years in such an institution where\nonly rich children are there, it\u2019s a very elegant\u2014show you how to do all your life when\nyou\u2019re invited to and so on. So I came back. After three years, I came back. I was about seventeen years\nold, seventeen years old. And then I went\u2014I was sent to Krakow, and I attended the business school of\nthe University of Krakow. It\u2019s a very good university, by the way. And Krakow is a beautiful city. So I\nspent a year over there, and I came back, and I got a job at some . Imet some little ol\u2019 boys\nand so on. I was sitting already with some young people, which I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re alive\n. We were very active at this time, and we are talking about the end of the \u201820\u2019s, \u201828, \u201829. It\nwas a very strong movement . This was a group of us sitting and starting . Twas\ndoing this. I went . So then\u2014and that was before service in the British army. Then I went\nto military service, two years. When I came back, I decided, because the regime and the relationship\nbetween Jewish and non-Jewish soldiers, the relationship from the command , | started to\nthink about myself as a Jew, and I joined the . It was a very active Jewish socialist democrat\nmovement. I signed the in a little of 12,000 Jews and grandson\nbecame . Tailors, shoemakers, lower class, that was the mentality of the Jewish\ncommunity. And grandson became\u2014I remember I was . First, I was in jail\nbecause I was publicly somewhere making a speech or something. I became very\u2014and after a year,\nasked me if I would be willing to take the . [became an .First of\nall, one of the principles was that we are against any state or immigration , anti-Zionist. It\nwas the trust, and we still believed to support together with the Polish movement, the Polish\nmovement. We were together . (Inaudible). But we were anticommunist because\ncommunists didn\u2019t believe in Jewish life ,",
        "Q: Ihave one other question, which is whether or not you were raised with a lot of religion and whether\nyou experienced antisemitism.",
        "A: My grandfather was an assimilated Jew. He was Russian culture, spoke Russian, spoke English too.\nHe was a native of , so he was a Jew. First of all, I was where it was a little\nStetalburg (ph), 12,000 Jews in the 1920\u2019s. A Jewish home should be . And then in the\nStetal (ph), you couldn\u2019t go without a cap. He was a Jew walking around without the cap. This was the\nsymbols. So I had religion. (Inaudible). It was not something we should make a religious matter.",
        "Q: Did you experience much antisemitism?",
        "A: Inthe camp?",
        "Q: (inaudible).",
        "A: Ipersonally didn\u2019t experience, but I knew politics. I knew more or less what the Polish government\npolicy was with the Jewish people, force us out of positions, business positions. My friends wanted to go\nand study medicine or engineering or something, couldn\u2019t be approved for studying in the university. I\ntell you, one time I had one of my friends who went to college to study medicine in ,\n(Inaudible). That was the policy. There was nothing to support\u2014I tell you, I was sent to ;\nwhich is a city, when the war started, I was there. (Inaudible). Then I came to . I functioned\nas an organizer. I was involved in a strike. There was in the city, big factories belonged to\nJews. So I became involved together with the Polish\u2014the socialist and labor movement, and I was\nsix weeks in this factory. As a result, I was arrested, thrown in jail. After about\nsix weeks, I don\u2019t remember how much, first of all, I got an infection, a skin infection. I came out and I\nwent to . And I became well again, and I continued my and ultimately started the\nwar. In 1939 the war started. The war started. The policy of the was to support this war. This\nis a war against Hitler. We as Jews, as Pollacks, good citizens of Poland, we have to go. We have to go\nand fight. So I volunteered. I was not accepted because of my . Even then, when the war\nstarted, it made a difference between socialist Jew\u2014I was a . But I know Russian. I know\nthe language very well. (Inaudible). I was sent to the , which took care of me. They\nintroduced me to some guy which was a . What the Russian said\u2014what the communist\nsaid\u2014the Russian USSR was organizing cooperatives in the villages. (Inaudible). This time\nit was the USSR service. I knew Russian, and they needed . He gave mea job. But before\nthe job, I was invited to the KGB. It\u2019s an experience. From 12 midnight I should come to see somebody,\nthe KGB. So I come in at night. This building is a building for the courts, the Polish courts. Now\ncame\u2014and the jail was part of this building. (Inaudible). So you\u2019re coming in that big hall\u2014I remember\nnow\u2014and you see the darkness, and you know what KGB is, and you know that you are a socialist, and\nyou know the socialists are social fascists, the Bolsheviks. I said you are in trouble. And you hear\nscreaming people. These people are being tortured. And you see people are being brought in from the\njail with guns this way. You know what the feeling it is. It\u2019s a special feeling. So you know\u2014he came\nfor me. After an hour, I was smoking cigarettes and this was my agent for all the time. His\nexistence was partly because of me, to watch if I behave myself or not. And I still was on the job. So I\nwas on the job. I had a normal life, no socialism. I was sitting very quiet. I needn\u2019t open my mouth.\nKeep my mouth shut because, you know, KGB is watching you.",
        "Q: For the record, was it call the KGB then?",
        "A: No. it\u2019s called. But we call it . KGB is the same as . So I was\nquiet until June 22\", 1940 or \u201841, the Bolsheviks, 1941. Russia\u2014the German attacked the USSR. Hitler\nstarted his March in Moscow.",
        "Q: One question before you go on, life under the Russian occupation, was that any more difficult for a\nJew?",
        "A: Yes and no, because all the businesses were mostly Jewish, so the business people got lost.\n(Inaudible). There were some people\u2014Russia was so big that you send away people and you forget about\nthem, especially Jews. It was antisemitism too, but this was the class, you know, especially in countries\nwhere they took over so you have to eliminate the class of capitalism. It was a little . He was\nalready a capitalist. So basically, it was and it was not antisemitism. Basically, Jews were sitting very,\nvery quiet. Then Germany, in three weeks was fully liberated. (Inaudible). But this part, this part was\n. The was taken over very fast. First came in Hungarian troops which did the job\nfor Russia because Russia couldn\u2019t spare any occupation. So came in and Gestapo. Gestapo\nwas everywhere. KGB is Gestapo. When the war started and Russians started to evacuate, it was a\npublically. Whoever wanted to be evacuated to the Russians should come . I didn\u2019t\nknow what goes on in Poland where the Germans were already because the policy of Russians at this time\nwas the friendship between Hitler and Stalin. So they wouldn\u2019t let us in the papers which were published\nin this part of the world. There was nothing written about what Hitler is doing to the Jews in Poland\n. So I know German too. I spent three years in Germany . [know German well.\n(Inaudible). And I know about what the Russian says, and I was right because those who went to the\nRussians went to live in Siberia and other places.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know what was going on in Germany?",
        "A: No, in Poland.",
        "Q: But also, did you know what Hitler was doing in Germany?",
        "A: Germany, there was no revolution. They were fighting, and they were winning the war. The\nGermans were fighting and winning the war. Do you understand? So I was called to answer who was\nafter me. They were crying. The crying became like the family, their own police and so on. And we\nwent through the first, when the Gestapo came in after a week or two weeks, they called in, the\nJewish had already\u2014the Jewish had an existing Jewish community council, because according to the law,\nthe Polish law, this was an expression of democracy. Jewish had the right to elect their own\nrepresentatives and a council which would deal with education, and welfare and so on and the\nright to tax the Jewish population. So when they came in, when the Germans came in, the\nhad already an organized group. They came to talk and demand. So the president of this council was\ncalled in and was asked to submit a list of everybody who belonged to the so-called Jewish intelligence,\nteachers, medical profession, law profession, a list of all these people to submit to the KGB, to the KGB.\nA list was submitted, and after a few days, each person who was on this list was called in to the KGB\nthe Gestapo. Those people never came back. (Inaudible). It was a liquidation of the\nintelligence, so there was no leadership anymore between the Jews. (Inaudible). And then came the\nnight, the first night of Rosh Hashanah. At night, police, German police, was going from house to house.\nBefore this, each house or each home which was Jewish, you had to put on your window a Star of David.\nSo the non-Jew knew the Jews. If you were a Jew, you know where to go. So at night, they were going\nfrom house to house and telling them, you are going to labor camp, get your belongings and come out to\nthe marketplace. There was a marketplace, typical Eastern European. So we went out. There was\nalready a few thousands Jews. There was trucks already. The old people were loaded in the\ntrucks and they left. The rest were walking into the Jewish cemetery. The cemetery was already prepared\nand the Jewish would come to this\u2014",
        "Q: Pit?",
        "A: Uh-huh. There was a desk. They were about seven or eight Gestapo. (Inaudible). There was all\nkinds of litter. And a Jew would come from the desk, one of them talk back, down. (Inaudible). Over\nthere in the back were people, about 5,000 or 6,000 . By 7 o\u2019clock in the evening, they\nstopped killing. So everybody who was in the back was still alive. And they said, go home. And\neverybody went home. So this night must have been about 4,000 or 5,000 people. We left about 4,000 or\n5,000 of our people . And after this, he gave an order to close the ghetto. 4,000 or 5,000\npeople less, you don\u2019t need so much housing for these goddamn Jews. So the Jews had to move out and\nlive in places where they put people . SO we moved out; the Gentiles moved in. They moved\nin. Okay. I happened to live in a building with three or floors . A lot of Italians\nwere working. They were in construction. So it was important labor. So this building belonged to an\nItalian. The rest\u2014he lived by himself, was a young man, he lived by himself. (Inaudible). I had a room\nby one of the tenants which was a couple and two young girls. So I lived over there. And\nafter this , you have to get used to it. Somebody this time didn\u2019t come back. I don\u2019t take it\nso tragically. It happened. This was Germany. This was what we went through, and this is what we\nwould still go through. (Inaudible). It\u2019s something which\u2014first of all, I think 1t was\u2014you\u2019re all of a\nsudden isolated from the . You\u2019re isolated. You always have in your mind that somebody\nwill come and take you out. You don\u2019t know what or when. They will take you out, and you\u2019!l never\ncome back. Your mind is being transformed into something which thinks of the most tragic way of\ndying. Because people were going to war. we want 50 people to go to labor for tomorrow\nmorning. There have to be 50 people. There are still rich people in the ghetto. The rich people are in the\nsame ghetto that Iam. But the rich people have something, a diamond or the gold or . (End of\nTape 1)\nTape 2",
        "Q: You were talking about the mentality.",
        "A: Mentality. And then there\u2019s a lot of\u2014you are ready to\u2014if you want to look and see what is the\nreality, what will be the end here. The end is you have to die here. (Inaudible). You should be able to sit\nduring the war, and then you will come out. You have to die here, period. So it\u2019s now or later. So first\nof all, the people could buy something in the market, could physically because there was no\ntemple. There were no schools for the children. There was nothing, nothing. There was an order that\neach Jew, you know, they have this . After we shaved, the cynicism was so far that even they\nremember the beard after we shaved. You know that all the Jewish are very -- you know, they are\u2014this\niS more important than . SO what would become such an a member of the Gestapo\nand walk around of the ghetto and they\u2019 ll see the beard . So that was the ghetto.\nThen there was a part of the ghetto was a place where they would bring in Jews from some other places\n. There was part of the ghetto. We knew what was going on. And then what happens, as I\nsaid, the poor people are getting\u2014-starting to revolt in the ghetto. Sure. They were hungry. (Inaudible).\nThat was the ghetto. It was a nice president. It was . I was witness to a very nice person\nwho was the president of the ghetto . Anyway, so I made up my mind that I have to go out.\n(Inaudible). Pll die of hunger or I'll die because . No. [have to go out. I want to go out and\ndo something.",
        "Q: How long were you in the ghetto?",
        "A: The ghetto was closed in October, 1942, and I left in May, 1943.",
        "Q: The ghetto began in October \u201841?",
        "A: No. Yes. October, November, yes. I left in May. So I mention that this house belongs to the\nItalian. The Italian was smart. He wanted to buy . So he said to me, Natan, do you want to\nmake a few bucks? (Inaudible). Buy me . Buy me gold. (Inaudible). Some people would\ncome from . He would sell it and make profit. So I started in the business. I was always\nfew thousand dollars ,",
        "Q: It was easy to come and go from the ghetto?",
        "A: Ihad a\u2014if you got a job, worked outside the ghetto, you could go out, but you had to come in for the\nnight. You couldn\u2019t stay overnight over there. This same had his office, his construction\noffice. (Inaudible). They knew that I want to go, and he knew that I wanted\u2014he said, here is a Polish\nman from the Polish underground. He will sell you papers, a birth certificate. He will sell you a birth\ncertificate for $3,000, a birth certificate, and you can go. So I met this guy. I gave him $3,000. I brought\nthis paper. My name was . They told me, we are going back to Krakow. (Inaudible). I said\nI want to go to Russia. I told them, I have to be very careful at the station, the railroad station. They said,\nyou know what, we are going to Krakow. We will be with you. (Inaudible). He was very elegant, nice\nsuit. I had such a special suitcase with pajamas. In case somebody looks, you should know\nthat I\u2019m just a regular\u2014they went to Krakow. They said goodbye, and I\u2019m on my own going to Warsaw.\nIt was the worst idea. I wanted to find some comrades from . I wanted to do something, not\njust sit around. Ill die anyway. It\u2019s always you\u2019ll die anyway, so do something. I took a room in the\nhotel. I told you before that the hotel was and at night, it was interesting. It was in my mind\nto watch through the window and understand, see how the soldiers the movement. Anyway,\none day, I decided how can I get in contact with the ghetto. Again, I met\u2014no, I went to see the ghetto\n. The entrance was\u2014one side was a Gentile, non-Jewish part, and there was a big,\ntremendous building which went\u2014the entrance\u2014it had two entrances. One was and the\nother was . SO you came in, you had a police on this side. You go in. Then you go out. He\nasked to bribe him. You have to pay him. So I went in and I went in and I looked at the ,\n(Inaudible).

        "A: Inthe Warsaw ghetto. This was sick. We will die tomorrow, so let\u2019s have a good time. That was\nthe impression in the ghetto.",
        "Q: What about the restaurant?",
        "A: Iam in this building where you\u2019re going in. When you come in, it\u2019s like\u2014TI don\u2019t know if you had a\nchance sometimes in the stock market on Wall Street to see . Business, business, non-Jewish,\nPollacks, and the Pollacks and business . You see some steps outside, a guy\nwhich I know very well. I remember him. He was the pianist in . He was a _ It\nwas at this time in the 20\u2019s and was the year the pianist was playing the music. So this guy was the\npianist, and I knew him very well. He saw me, he said. He called me by my name, my\nRussian name. he calls me. He\u2019s a very nice guy, and I spent with him already a few hours,\nand I told him what my purpose is. So he made up he was trying to find somebody and the\ntime would come again. I left again. I left him $10 and I left. (Inaudible). So let\u2019s see\noccupy Poland. So I had friends who survived. He, his wife, two boys. (Inaudible). I tell you how close\nwe are, if I told you I came back from after six weeks being in jail, I needed $150 to go into\u2014to be taken\ncare of. I had nothing.

One is a consultant with Hughes Aircraft, big shot engineer. He gave\nme . His sister who survived was married to a non-Jew. (Inaudible). He had no right to be\nwith a Jewish woman. If Gestapo would find out, he would be the same\u2014he would have the same\nas a Jew which lived with a non-Jewish woman. Do you understand? Anyway, they were a\nvery nice couple, and he was very nice, and he told me you want\u2014the best way is you go to ;\nif you know where is. (Inaudible). This is a very long Polish phrase. Rich people would go\nto , beautiful country. I know this place. He tells me, you go to and in\nyou have to find somebody. Somewhere in there is a place called ,\nThe water eyes or something . There are three waters coming together, Poland, Hungary\nand Czechoslovakia. The best way is to try to go to Hungary. From Hungary, a lot of people would go\n. So I went upstairs. I was thinking, you cannot move all of a sudden because of the dogs\nwatching, barking. I just gave up. I said to myself, . [went back. For the first time\n. I saw the first time a guy who was in in Poland. (Inaudible). He\nwouldn\u2019t say nothing. You couldn\u2019t provoke him to talking. He said, let me alone, don\u2019t bother me.",
        "Q: This was around the summer of 1942?",
        "A: Yeah. He was afraid. So I\u2019m sitting over there going back to Warsaw. I\u2019m going to visit some other\nfriends who were over there, he and his wife and his mother-in-law. This guy was a guy who was an\nofficial of a bank in Warsaw before the war. There were a lot of Polish community ,\n(Inaudible). I told him, listen, I\u2019m crazy. I cannot\u2014I have to go.

I went and I brought her to Warsaw.\n(Inaudible). And she was a very capable lady. She wanted to do some shopping at that store.\n(Inaudible). My friend who had the Polish contacts. So I called him, and I said, I want to do something.\nYou have to do me a favor. At the same time, you\u2019ll recetve some money as soon as possible. He said\nis the city when you come to Krakow, you have to change trains. You have to wait\n. 40\u2019clock in the morning we have to . (Inaudible). I should go in this\nto be able to make small sacrament . Okay. (Inaudible). She said, please don\u2019t\ndo it. Something happened, please, she begs me.

He came to me and he\nsaid, Polish, Jewish. I said, what? Let\u2019s go to the police. We\u2019ll check. (Inaudible). I said, how much do\nyou want? I had three 50\u2019s, $150. It wasn\u2019t much. I didn\u2019t take money because sometimes the Germans\nwould stop the train and look because all the black market was going to trains. So I didn\u2019t want to take it\nbecause I need money . And I gave him I take out, I said, there\u2019s my money. So he takes\ntwo 50\u2019s and gives me 50 back and said, go. So I survived. The second time, when I was in the Warsaw\nghetto and I came out, I came out and gave the policeman and I walked and I feel\nsomebody\u2019s after me because you have the feeling like somebody is always after you. Some people\naren\u2019t paying attention, but I think he looks at me. Somebody is after me. And you look and see a man\nuntil he comes and says, you\u2019re Jewish. So I sat and talked to him, blah, blah, blah, and went\ninto a bar, drink a bottle of Vodka. (Inaudible). I had a kilo. A kilo is two and a half bottles. It was in\nthe chimney. So I had the money. And he asked me what I\u2019m doing here. I told him that\nand to buy saccharine because the Jews were so smart they were making saccharine in the ghetto with the\nfactory. (Inaudible). No sugar, saccharine. I give him this story, and he said, here\u2019s my address. Go\nback to in case you need something and you come and get in touch with me. (Inaudible). So\nI\u2019m going and I\u2019m going to Krakow. It\u2019s 7 o\u2019clock at night. You almost don\u2019t see any people. It\u2019s\nOctober 4\"\"-5\", which was I was arrested in October the night of 5\"-6\". (Inaudible). I\u2019m still 30 years\nold. Today I\u2019m \u201887. It\u2019s 30 years old. Come on, what are you drinking, Pollack? (Inaudible). So I sit,\nand so I\u2019m going to with the baggage or something and ask him where there\u2019s a place because\nhotels are all taken. So he takes me to such houses occupied . Today it is bed and breakfast,\nsomething like that, but not as elegant and as nice. It\u2019s in Poland. And he tells me, . She\ngives me a room and a bed. I\u2019m undressing and putting on pajamas and getting ready for bed. And\nsomebody . Open. He said open. and right away _ I\nknew this was not Gestapo. This was military police. So I knew already. Do you see what they\u2019re\ndoing? They\u2019re taking him to the Gestapo. They\u2019re taking . (Inaudible). So I\u2019m starting to\nthink, and he hits me. As soon as he hits me, I said, yes, I cannot take it. I do not and I\ncannot hit back. I have to give up. I\u2019m ready for this. I was ready. Yes. I got arrested. He brings me to\nstill not Gestapo, still military police who are stationed, the police station, the military police station.\nThey put me in a cell, and I put up my collar, and I fell asleep. Then somebody wakes me at 8:00 in the\nmorning. The sergeant calls me in and starts to ask\u2014he had my wallet. I had some pictures. They didn\u2019t\ntake it. And I started to talk to him. I said, I know . This time was already _ I\nsaid, I need you found outside of his place, this ghetto or places where he has to be,\narrest and execution. So I know . But I start . And I tell him to send me to the\nGestapo. I know what Gestapo does. (Inaudible). Take me out and . He said, what are you\ntalking about? (Inaudible). He said, you will work and help us to win the war. Anyway, he gives me\u2014\nafter ten minutes, here comes an older soldier, and we start working, and I know that I work for the\nGestapo. This I know. I go and I start talking to him in German and tell him take me to\nthe Gestapo. You know what the Gestapo is, what Gestapo is going to do with me and give him all the\nsmear (ph). The street cars would come to a stop, and here come the street cars to a stop. (Inaudible).\nAnd he said to me, go. He let me go. I\u2019m jumping inside. He\u2019s jumping after me. (Inaudible). I talk to\nhim. He wasn\u2019t sure. Here are a lot of people. I could not talk to him and tell him to help me. And he\nbrought me to the Gestapo.\n(End of Tape 2)\nTape 3\nSo they brought me to the Gestapo. One man started asking me all kinds of questions. There are pictures\nin my suitcase. I had photos, my grandfather. It was . It was my mother\u2019s. We\u2019re funny\npeople. I never saw my mother, and I was keeping her picture. It\u2019s something. So I said, they are\nalready cremated, forget it. It was a bad excuse. (Inaudible). , he says, in the corner, go\nback. So I am going, and I\u2019m standing this way. Turn around with your face to the wall. I turn around.\n(Inaudible). The first time that each male Jew was . I didn\u2019t know that Israel was\n. I think they are coming. I hear two voices, two . A conversation begins, what\nare we going to do with this Israel? (Inaudible). How will we kill the ? With my legs up and\nhead down. (Inaudible). So you hang me. So after some 20 minutes, 25 minutes, somebody\u2014I know\nsomebody came in. He said, turn around. I look, and I see two policemen from the Ghetto. I recognize\nthem, the cross of David. (Inaudible). Everything is yellow, light brown. (Inaudible). They said to me,\ncome on. I am going down, down, and there 1s a coach, and there was a horse. We sit down, and I ask\nhim, where are we going? He says, you\u2019re going to go in jail. I said, jail? Yes, in the Ghetto, the jail,\nyou go. (Inaudible). I said, you\u2019re not going to kill me? They said, we don\u2019t know nothing about it.\n(Inaudible). Only to put you in jail and that\u2019s all. And I\u2019m coming to the Ghetto Krakow. The jail was\none big room was for men, and the other big room was for women. And the men was about 50, 60\npeople. (Inaudible). And you\u2019re so confused. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here. I said, what? He\nsaid, nothing. This is the jail. (Inaudible). I tell them who I am and what I am. They start to look at me\ndifferent. (Inaudible). And they\u2019re all family. They\u2019re family. (Inaudible). There are Jews. (Inaudible).\nThey share with me. They share a lot of things. There are a few older people. The rest was young\npeople. I said, why are we separated? Why can not we be with the women and be with them together?\n(Inaudible). There was a policeman, a Jew. Gestapo will come in every day and look. If he will see\nsomebody unshaved and say come and kill him. (Inaudible). Right away. Or he didn\u2019t like your face, he\nkilled you. (Inaudible). Maybe you play a lottery, you understand? Maybe you will be next. Nobody\nknows. So I said to this Jewish policeman, I said, what are you doing? We are sitting here on borrowed\ntime. They are the same, and we are the same. (Inaudible). We want to sit and talk, to be able to talk like\nhuman beings. It will be better for us, for them and for us. We want this. (Inaudible). It was established\na time 46 or 47, some two hours socializing. (Inaudible). Then it was a man who was a representative of\nthe . Germany occupied Poland. During the occupation, the had the right to exist\nto bring some welfare to the Jewish people. lived in Krakow in the\nGhetto. (Inaudible). All of a sudden, I\u2019m getting sent bread, half a bread for me. They find out my\nname. (Inaudible). He found out. Anyway, we were sitting one week, two weeks. Then came October\nand December.",
        "Q: Did you learn much about what was going on in the Ghetto or anything else that you didn\u2019t know\nbefore you talked to these people in jail?",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: Did they know anything about the camps? You knew a little bit about (Inaudible).",
        "A: No. Nobody knew. These guys, as I told you, . It was a non-Jewish person.\n(Inaudible). I think December 19 -- about two days, about 16, 17, should shave our heads. Why? I\nwondered why. This is a . (Inaudible). In the Polish, . This is a Jewish jail. I\nhave my rights. Anyway, he said, be quiet. He said, we have nothing to say. We are not Gestapo.\nGestapo will come and check and see if you are shaved or not, and if not, they will kill you. (Inaudible).\nSo we are shaved. Anyway, the night came trucks, trucks. We are loaded in the trucks. The German\noccupation knew that we were being evacuated. The people came with bread, loaves of bread. Each one\ngot a loaf of bread. So we\u2019re\u2014so the Polish were sitting in Krakow. When the trucks moved, they said,\nwe are going to the railroad station; and at the railroad, we are going to . We are going to\nthe railroad station. The transport of thousands and thousands and thousands of men, Pollacks, Gentiles,\nnot Jews. We are the only Jewish part of this transport. Supposedly, it was a transport of 7,000 from all\nkinds in the occupied Poland. (Inaudible). So they put us in. We are sitting already in the train, and the\ntrain moves. These are closed railroads. (Inaudible). Closed. In Europe, they are different. There is a\nwindow. There is somewhere a window, a window that a human body can go through. So all of a\nsudden, there\u2019s every two wagons is a man with a machine gun. It\u2019s snow. We are going in the snow on\nthe way from Krakow to , which is a few hours\u2019 drive by train. It\u2019s snow. All of a sudden,\nthe machine gun. What happened? The women started to jump. So after four or five jumped, the train\nwas stopped. And they came into the Jewish part. They said somebody was killed. They knew that there\nwas women there. If at the next stop one will be missing, all of you will be killed. (Inaudible). There\nwas a boy came in one night. One night came in a boy hysterical, a young boy hysterical. What\nhappened? Only you can help me. I have to go. I cannot be here. They are after me. He is a politician.\nHe was sent in the city to buy something or something. And they\u2019re after him. They knew. They are\nlooking for him. So he came through the opening\u2014supposedly this jail is on the verge of Ghetto. On the\nother side is the Ghetto. And in Ghettos there are all kinds of things going on. He said, [ll take you.\nLet\u2019s try to escape from here. But you have to go with me. I need people to go, and we will be on the\nother side. I'll find you a place. There are friends, comrades there and so on. Anyway, we didn\u2019t go, but\nhe was so hysterical. I remember him a lot, a long time, this boy, and I\u2019m sure he just ,\nAnyway, we are going and we are coming to . It must be already the end of the day,\ncame to . This is a stop of trains. Trains were unloaded, and when you stop and they open the\ndoor and say, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out. Everything is right away, you come. Right away.\nThere are people saying up, up, up, run, run, run. Where do yourun? Yourun. And some people with\nblack and white uniforms, stripes, taking your suitcase away from you, everything from you and pull it\naway. You are out. You have nothing. And you feel, what happened? You have nowhere to go. Maybe\nsomebody will get killed. And dogs are everywhere. Everything that condition for fear\nfrom despair, not to encourage you to fight. Forget about fight. Fight is\u2014you\u2019re right about fighting, but\nyou don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s true. Do you understand? So here comes a and then somebody comes\n. This voice starts talking to you, Jewish or Polish or German. (Inaudible). You got to the\ncamp. Part of you has been sent to the crematory. Right away. (Inaudible)",
        "Q: Who was the voice?",
        "A: (Inaudible). This commander has the name . (Inaudible). is something that\neverything 1s all right and , kind of goodness and so on because they have it. They control\nhow the . (Inaudible). And you\u2019re going and you\u2019re walking and coming ,\nThere is a , a fence, a big fence, and you see barracks, and you see the sign ;\nlabor makes you free. (Inaudible). They say you can become unionized, join unions. (Inaudible). We\nwalk, and when you walk, I tell you about the time of the . There is an in the\nmornings and an in the evenings when the commanders come back from work. So there are\npeople, and there are barracks. They are already made. They\u2019re already made and put them together\nalready. It\u2019s kind of about 350, 400 people. (Inaudible). So each was separate. So there are the people\nlook like . People lost everything, the weight and so on, become . Lwasa\n. And then people on the floorcan be __ dead because they have to be counted. You\nsee? Hitler doesn\u2019t believe that somebody was\u2014no, you bring him from . You bring him\nback here, and you have to bring him here. He should see him. He should count. And those people were\nnot able to stay on your feet. (Inaudible). And you have bread and you don\u2019t know what happened.\nHence, one man asking you for bread. They see people with bread, so they\u2019re asking you. Can you\nimagine? And everybody is close . They\u2019re back from the people who are being\n. (Inaudible). Germany. So what do you do with the bread? (Inaudible). What if\nyou refuse somebody the bread? You don\u2019t know that tomorrow you\u2019ll be hungry. You don\u2019t think about\nit. They are people. What happens in some places is they go after the bread, 5, 6, 7 people. Right away\nsomebody is there and starts\u2014there is always somebody ready with something to hit you, always. This is\nthe way how you\u2019re being greeted in . (Inaudible). In my case, we are being placed in a\nbarrack, in about two or three barracks. No . Nothing. We sit in these barracks. No food.\nNobody gives a damn what happens. We sleep all night. Then the next day, they start to call out people.\nHere is our transport, separate. So everybody has to stay around. There is a young man with stripes and\nso on, calls everything in German. Whose name is an A, starts with A, step out. A, B, C, you know. He\ncomes to G, and he said, in Russian, my name in Russian is . He knows me as\n. Llook at him, and I am such . Inaudible). Huis father was a good friend of mine.\n(Inaudible). He wanted to study medicine, so he couldn\u2019t in Poland, so he went to France, in France. In\nFrance, during the war, he went to the army, to the French army. This is famous, French attack the\nNorway, make a landing in Norway and lost . Do you understand? So he was between\nthem, and he was a POW, a prisoner of war. When they found out the prisoner of war was Jewish, they\nsent him to , was a camp where the Jews went to be ,\nYou never heard about ? It was a . So he was in , and from\nhe went\u2014in July \u201842, he came and he\u2019s one of the big people would give you the names\nand write your paper where you are and what you are and everything. You have to fill out a form. He\nknows everything. So he said\u2014I said, what is going on here? Tell me what\u2019s going on. [Il tell you very\nshortly. A Jew, the life span of a Jew here is 14 days, but\u2014there is a but\u2014I\u2019Il try to do what I can, and\nyou have to avoid. You will go to war. There are all kinds of people. There are Kopos (ph). And if you\ndon\u2019t work, he doesn\u2019t like how you work and what you work, you will not be able to come. You should\nknow this. Here you can beat somebody so long until he\u2019s dead and nothing will happen to you. These\npeople who beat you with exception, some exception. Some people were intelligent people too. Some\nprofessors who became murderers. (Inaudible). I\u20191l do something for him. So I feel better. I\u2019m getting\nthe name and everything, and I\u2019m going, and we are in quarantine. Everything was quarantine.",
        "Q: What happens in quarantine?",
        "A: Nothing. You see?",
        "Q: Had you already been tattooed and all of that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Not yet?",
        "A: No. We\u2019re still waiting. (Inaudible). It was late in the evening already. They started to do this. In\nthe beginning, I tried not to hit my head. (Inaudible). It\u2019s so stupid. Anyway, he said to me, don\u2019t play\n. So after quarantine, then people were going to different commanders. Three of us from our\ngroup were going to , young boys.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the ?",
        "A: was a special commander who worked only in crematory. He did everything but\n. The gas was put through a little window by a German. This was such a holy job. A\nJew for sure not, but a non-Jew, a Gentile, no. A German has to do this to murder. So this was under\ncommand. What was this other commander doing? In the military, you go, it takes you\u2014and they are\ntalking about crematory. I tell you about crematory. (Inaudible). The crematory, more or less, is very\nsimple. It\u2019s a big place with ovens. You go, there is an opening from the oven. It can be 2, 3, 4,5. And\nthe wagons to take out the dead people and put them in the oven and push. By the way, you start the fire\nwith fat people because they burn better. The technique so far, the German technique and science is you\nneed a fat man, a fat Jew. So push him in the crematory and he will burn. This is everything. When you\ncome out and you have time to think, you think about what I mention. It\u2019s something unbelievable. Our\nchildren, children takes longer to die from the gas. When the commander guys, this is a big haul, there\nare all kinds of signs, a shower room. When you come in, you think because you have to\nundress yourself. The commanders have to help you, men and women. Then you\u2019re being shaved, totally\nshaved, a woman totally shaved. Imagine what that must do to this woman. So this is what he is doing.\nThen they put them one, one, one in this big which you can put in a thousand people, one by\none. So tense, and you put the gas. After an hour, most of the people are on the floor. Children not yet.\nChildren took longer to die. (End of Tape 3)\nTape 4\nSo children are still standing up. So again, the commander has to come. And I don\u2019t know. So the\nchildren have the gas already inside. Do you understand? But they are still not down. They would need\nanother ten minutes\u2019 gas. So this problem was solved. I never asked. By the way, I am by\nbecause I was inside. I was in the crematory. Sometimes in 1944, supposedly came a\ntransport from Vienna, Gentiles, mixed Jews and non-Jews. Everybody went . The\ncommandant . Then they realized a day later or something that in the group were Gentiles,\nnot Jews. This is not allowed. So what to do? There\u2019s only one thing to do, that\u2019s tattoo them. Give\nthem a number. That means that they are in that camp, that everything is all right and then something\nhappens to them and because they die, they go to the oven. So we went. So yes. I forget\nto tell you. (Inaudible). I'll come back to this.",
        "Q: You could probably just finish this little story by explaining that that\u2019s how you were\u2014",
        "A: Allright. So I volunteered. He asks people who were in the group which was doing registration was\nasked to volunteer five people and told us what to do . These people are dead already, but you\nhave to give them numbers and so on. So you need more people because the dead men cannot tell you,\ntake my hand. You have to do everything for him. So I said I wanted to go. I want to go. I wanted just\nto see, just to see. Ill die, so PIl at least know where I\u2019m being buried. (Inaudible). So I went, and so it\nwas dead people, and I made the numbers. So I saw more or less how the structure of it being built and so\non because it was very scientifically done and everything. It was a genius.",
        "Q: Is there anything more to explain about the structure? (Inaudible).",
        "A: The ovens, especially done very efficient. Comes this little wagon which was being loaded from the\nbunker comes, and it\u2019s organized. The commander people organize which goes where and so on. It\u2019s not\nspecial. (Inaudible). It went so far that in July, in July or\u2014in July, in July, they had to burn, gas, bodies\noutside of the crematory. So besides this, you lived in 19 -- we are talking about 1944. We are in the\ncamp. Everything of the regime is changed. That means\u2014what has changed, no beating.",
        "Q: You\u2019re jumping around too much.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Don\u2019t you think we\u2019re jumping ahead a little bit too much here? I want you to talk about that, but I\nthink we should go back to 1942, if you don\u2019t mind.",
        "A: 1942?",
        "Q: You told me what you were doing in the beginning.",
        "A: 1942. I came December, 1942, to . Allright? After a few days, my friend\u2014my friend,\nwhich I told you, made arrangements, got my commander was my group . (Inaudible).\nStreet cleaners, the camp. It was a group of people who are wearing all day and\ncollecting anything that you see, not your hands. My finger is still\u2014see? This was frozen. A\nfrozen finger. (Inaudible). With your hands, not with . This is where I worked every day,\nand this Kopo (ph) was a French Jew. He hit me once. And I was in Paris the first time in 1945 or \u201846.\n(Inaudible). But I forget. (Inaudible). So I worked until February. February came, started the campaign\nfor the gypsies. The gypsies campaign started February, 1943. Yeah. Right. Yeah, 1943. And they\nneeded more people to registration, people who know a few languages, especially German and Russian\nand Polish. So French, a little French, I don\u2019t know much, but several French people do. So this group of\n20 became a group of 40 because we were sitting day and night and working. I sit at night, and people are\ncoming. We were very independent. What was good about it, first of all, I could organize myself\n. People are coming and you ask. Always somebody had something. He tells them, when you\ncome in the camp, you go to , is not a little . You go outside steps.\nThis is a shower room, a shower. Usually, the water is ice cold. You want to enjoy a shower? Go. You\ngo. You have to go. Some people\u2014a cold shower 1s a terrible thing. Already somebody is there waiting\nand hitting. If you are already an old inmate . (Inaudible). So I went\u2014when I came, I went\nin the cold water. Somebody was sending me this. You come. When you come, you undress yourself.\nFirst you undress everything. Then you go to the shower. Then you go out from the other door from the\nshower and there is two men. One stays and has shoes and gives you a pair of shoes. The other one gives\nyou Clothes, gives you underwear and a jacket or something. So when you dress, when you dress, when\nyou look at yourself after you have this new outfit and so on, you\u2019re not you anymore. You are\ndepersonalized, dehumanized. This is\u2014I still was\u2014I was still everything\u2014I was still going in my --\n(Inaudible). But here, that\u2019s what you do. They do it when you come, when you\u2019re being converted with\nfear, with fear. You come here, and it was just to do something. This is scientific A\nperson changed a lot if he\u2019s so dressed like a clown. What happens? When you\u2014five days, you get\ndiarrhea. This is such a diarrhea that you cannot control yourself. You are still in quarantine. You\ncannot control yourself. So you have to go. On the block where you live, there\u2019s some big barrels for this\npurpose. 350 people can have bowel movements over there. But there are special also.\nOld inmates, such a big block like 350, six men. These are former bandits, criminals. (Inaudible).\nCriminals. They see that somebody goes in this barrel because you will be later to clean up the barrel.\nHe comes and hits you, out. This night in Birkenau is a very bad place. It\u2019s always wet. It\u2019s sucha\nclimate. You go. By now, you\u2019re going to the latrine, and it\u2019s usually . And it\u2019s wet. Still,\nyou come over there. You are undressed already because you have filled your pants. So you\u2019re nothing.\nYou\u2019re nothing. So you take off these pants. You leave them over there. So you\u2019re running around in\nthis climate naked under this\u2014that\u2019s the beginning. I saw some guys who would take their bread, put it\non fire. It becomes coal. There is medicine too. Coal. It controls your\u2014constipates you. There\u2019s even a\nspecial medical\u2014I know in Europe, if you have diarrhea, you . So I ask him, what are you\ndoing? He told me, this man. So I said to myself, PIl . I want to be well.",
        "Q: So you ate the coal?",
        "A: Yes, we ate the coal. Don\u2019t drink the water. Don\u2019t drink the water, because when you have the\ndiarrhea, you are getting dehydrated. When you are dehydrated, it works a different way. I came with a\nguy. I came from Krakow, from jail. A young fellow which tried to get clothes to me. I don\u2019t know\nwhy. A former policeman in Ghetto police, a young man, he was all the time with me. He was\n. He was out right away, mentally out. He was already laying next to me, laying, nothing.\nHis bread, he will get this person because he would put it in his pockets. I was hungry,\nand here is the bread. (Inaudible). Should I take the bread or not? That was my problem because I was\nraised that my , my grandma, told me, who goes in and asks for bread? The poor\npeople who doesn\u2019t want to work or . That came back. So how can I take from him the\nbread? He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on anyway. I took it. (Inaudible). Because you took him to the\nhospital and give him an injection and got rid of him because they didn\u2019t fool around with this. But some\npeople under dehydration and temperature will go on the wire. Each camp was wired. It was a big\nspecial wire, and you would hear at night when people would go on the wire committing suicide, each\nnight, every night. People couldn\u2019t take it. Some people could and some others couldn\u2019t take it. Some\npeople would go and die. I couldn\u2019t do it. Never came to my mind to commit suicide. No, I want to\nfight. I want to keep me alive. There was always, always, always . So this was the\nweeks from , the first weeks. As soon as I came to this group\u2014",
        "Q: When were you tattooed?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: When were you tattooed?",
        "A: In the beginning.",
        "Q: Inthe beginning?",
        "A: Yeah. 3",
        "Q: At which point?",
        "A: It was still in quarantine, the first days, yeah. It\u2019s an old number, ,",
        "Q: What is your number?",
        "A: 9047. It\u2019s an old European 7. There was a guy from Slovakia who was there. (Inaudible). Anyway,\nI won\u2019t blame him. He became so nervous because he had to\u2014this is not something which you can take\nout. You have to cut out this piece and put some other\u2014I know somebody who tried and they told him\u2014\nso this is the beginning of Birkenau. I came here, entirely different. (Inaudible). First of all, personally,\nyou take\u2014you have the uniform. So you go in the uniform all the time. You can\u2014I\u2019m talking in 1943.\nIt was very important in 1943. Then I had some\u2014a shirt. I was washing it myself, but I could wash\nevery day or every other day. Then we had ways how to get a clean shirt.",
        "Q: The other people couldn\u2019t wash every day?",
        "A: Not everybody, no, not in 1943, not in 1943. In 1943, the regime was the same. It was often, where\nare you going and what are you doing and you don\u2019t do that and . All that what I told you\nwhat I saw, that was every night and transports. But the situation changed in 1944. Came always so\nmany people together. It was a transport of 600,000 Hungarian Jews.

I had a letter from a woman which I helped. (Inaudible). After I helped her, I\nwas helping and I got a letter from her across the wire. You will take it and throw it and\nthere was already somebody picked up and read it. She blessed me what I did for her. Because they\nknew they were going away. (Inaudible). This lady which I romanced with, I met with her after the war.\nShe lost her husband over there. That\u2019s what they did. But the situation in the camp, people are good\u2014I\nstarted to have\u2014I started to have an erection again. Women started to have menstruation again. Our\nphysically, physically, only it was . We had so much food that we didn\u2019t have to eat our food\nwhich we get from the kitchen. We had to buy everything. But this is what happened.",

        "Q: Why don\u2019t you describe a little bit the work in registration, what you did?",
        "A: It was very simple. You took each person, had to have each person, his destiny was to come in the\ncamp, and each person who came in the camp had to be tattooed. So this is you got a chance. You came\nin the camp. (Inaudible). A little bit about too. There was a form which has all kinds of\nquestions, birth and where you were born, and so on, family, where is your family, politics, what are you?\n(Inaudible). It\u2019s a big story. Then you get a number and you get such . It\u2019s a black anda\nyellow. So it\u2019s\u2014you put the black and the yellow comes. (Inaudible). Because other people,\nnon-Jewish, in red was Gentiles.

He would\ncome and say, today at 6:00 will arrive a transport of Jews from where it will be, men and women and\nchildren. What? How is that possible? In Birkenau, together in one camp? (Inaudible). We didn\u2019t\nbelieve it. How was it possible? So he gives you instructions and everything, what he wants with the\nchildren, everything and so on. All right? So you\u2019re ready. At 6:00, you\u2019re there. You\u2019re there and you\nsit and it\u2019s tables, tables. And one, like my friend, calls them out, A, B, C, D. And they have to go.\nThat\u2019s what it is.

His eyes, yes, what happened from the first Hungarian\ntransport, the Jews, about 250 men, healthy men, 250, and put them to work on their own families, put\nthem to work in the crematory. That was under commander because already had 700 to\nIsrael. It wasn\u2019t enough because so many transports were coming . Here they took and\ncame in. Here stands this Jew, and I\u2019m looking because we didn\u2019t know what else was coming. I ask\nhim, serious, and I ask him, do you know what you are doing? First of all, I said, you can talk. He said,\nyes, I know. I said, are you married? It\u2019s possible that you buried with your hands your wife and your\nchildren. (Inaudible). Yes, I know. (Inaudible). I couldn\u2019t stand there. I hithim. Yes. That was my\nreaction. I asked him, do you understand? My reaction was to hit him. It was only my\nwhen somebody brought me out from this. Because he did something . God wants him and\nnot his children . I told this story to . Can I tell you that,\nmention? I told him the story. He was here in . I told him the story of the guy and how I\u2014he\nasked me . I said more or less his physics, how was he physical. So I explained to him. He\nsaid, I know what it is. (Inaudible). To do something like that.",
        "Q: He was right?",
        "A: Idon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. (Inaudible). That\u2019s what itis. When you are there, you accept from\noutside should do not for us, for themselves.

The means with what to buy it, but I don\u2019t have it. (Inaudible). So\nthen\u2014but you couldn\u2019t get shirt. Everybody has with himself two or three shirts because he\ngoes into the camp. You never know what people have. That was helping a lot of\u2014first of all, \u2019m\nsaying the food. So I didn\u2019t want to eat.

        "Q: While you were working in the registration, which is practically the whole time that you were there,\nwere there ever reasons to manipulate documents to help the prisoners?",
        "A: Yes. There was one\u2014after the\u2014there was two uprisings in Warsaw. There was a Jewish uprising,\nand there was a Polish uprising. As a result, we know what happened with the Jewish uprising. Now, the\nPolish was a lot of people which were taken out from Poland. Took Pollacks from Warsaw which\nparticipated or not participated and just deported them. One transport came to Birkenau. In between\nthem was one which we knew very well from a Jew. First of all, he came as a Pollack, not as a Jew.\nBecause if you were a Jew, he would not come, they would liquidate him. So he comes. We knew that\nthe Polish wouldn\u2019t stay. We didn\u2019t have to give them numbers. It was temporary. (Inaudible). Some in\nGerman, some camps and so on. They were there three days or something. There was one which I knew\nvery well which mentioned my name. His son was killed in the 1967 war. He was in the\narmy. He was a very\u2014in Poland, he was a very famous . We changed his name. The only\nthing that we did, we changed his name. That\u2019s all. So he can go and he won\u2019t always be afraid that\nsomebody will say, Jew, Jew. And he survived.

All assembled, a few\nthousand inmates, and look what\u2019s going on. There was one Jew I remember was only hanged. They got\nin Budapest or something. I had\u2014I became befriended with the Russian prisoner of war which by the\nway was a Jew. But the Russians, they didn\u2019t say, he\u2019s Jewish or something. So now we knew he was a\nRussian prisoner of war. He was a very smart, very intelligent man and so on. He was . He\nwas in the . We kept and we never, never\u2014anybody knows that he is not a Gentile. He planned\nescaping. I talked to him, and he let me know. I shouldn\u2019t have said, \u2019'm Jewish. When you escaped to\nthe road through villages and forests to get to the Russians, , it\u2019s very far. And stuff. You\nhave to eat and so on. You go. It\u2019s already one of us . If 1 go myself, I know Ill make it. He\nwent and he left, and they never brought him. Russians, a lot of people, run away. It was almost every\nweek one of them. They worked in conditions. They worked that big field, acres and acres, where\nshot-down airplanes were brought, and they would do to this landing job so they were commander, a\nthousand people, healthy and so on because they had the civilians, German civilians that were coming.\nThey would make them business, make the dollars and everything and so on.

        "Q: This is the only place?",
        "A: Where he was already there, he had already some . So he would go in. (Inaudible). So\nwhat happens is the commanders are coming back from the war and , is right\naway a signal like we have here the alarm. So when it started this, we knew somebody was missing. In\n48 hours, because of this, this was sitting 40 miles going down closest to the place where this happened.\nAfter 48 hours, it\u2019s over. So he has to be able to be inside 48 hours. He has covered himself with grass\nand dismantled planes. Only one or two people know. They got food over there. So he should be able to\nsurvive. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know. There are many . Not me. This was a way out, you\nmake it. They did it very good. They had military training too. (Inaudible). So they had an experience.",

I didn\u2019t believe there was an\norganized political communist and literature. I didn\u2019t believe it. In there were single individuals.\n(Inaudible). The went up and they were hoped that we would help them, that we would\n, especially the women. Nobody. All of a sudden, September first was from September\nfirst, until cremation. It was the order from not to cremate anymore to the crematories, didn\u2019t\ndo nothing. So they put\u2014they used the explosives and put two crematories during the day.\nMore or less, between the afternoon, it happened. So put right away came the\nfrom came with machine guns and cars and . So they pushed them. They were\nrunning, running, running. They came some 20 or 30 kilometers farther ,\nis a big river. When they came to the , there was no way to go. It was worthless. But the\nassessment came already with the machine guns, and we never knew how many were killed. That was the\nend of the uprisings. That was all the uprisings.",

        "A: There was no more resistance. Nobody helped them. They didn\u2019t know . Nobody. It\nwas September, 1944. It was after Stalingrad (ph). It was after Moscow. It was after Linengrad (ph).\nWe knew the Russians are going. In Auschwitz, we heard artillery fire from Krakow. Do you understand\nso far? (Inaudible). Two years, three years, and all of a sudden, you go and put everything for history. I\nwant to leave. I don\u2019t want history. Nobody was going, and it would be crazy. (Inaudible). But if\nsomebody makes such a big deal and so on, the movement, . (Inaudible).",
        "Q: You started to talk earlier about how the camp changed towards the end in 1944.",
        "A: The change was relationship between the military, the uniform, assessment with the inmate, with the\ninmate. It wasn\u2019t any case somebody was beating him or the Kopos (ph) bathed themselves. The food\nwas different. The influence from the Jews, the Hungarian Jews and so on, brought in a lot of goodies,\nwhich the old inmate doesn\u2019t have to eat what he gets from and so on. So all together, for\nme personally, but I think a lot of because I more or less knew what was going on and so on.\nThe most important thing was what to eat, food, and cleanliness. And this we had. Not only us, all the\ncamp. Every second week, another block was going to the . In 1943, forget it. (Inaudible).\nThis was a must. You have to go to because manpower was very important. They needed\npeople to send them to labor camps.",
        "Q: So they treated you-all better?",
        "A: They treated everybody, yeah. We were . And I belonged to the class\u2014I was\nlooking for a job. I didn\u2019t have nothing to do. In September, we had nothing to do.",
        "Q: No more people to register?",
        "A: No. This transport and there was an old man.",
        "Q: Do you know what? I\u2019m going to stop you because we need to change tapes.\n(End of Tape 6)\nTape 7",
        "Q: Toward the summer of 1944, the camp was getting very crowded. Were there accommodations for\neveryone?",
        "A: Yeah. It wasn\u2019t so crowded. It wasn\u2019t actually\u2014a lot of old inmates were taken to other camps. So\nit was Hungarian. It was Dutch. It was still part of the Czechoslovakian, and it was transports, normal,\nnot special campaign, not special campaign, a community or something. So it wasn\u2019t so crowded\nanymore, no. But the living conditions I said for women, the women. Old women in the camp, wasn\u2019t\nany room. So they went\u2014this was skeletons from blocks because this is already made. You put together\n. So they didn\u2019t have the parts. (Inaudible). So this I know for sure, that most of these poor\nwomen, first of all, was half-naked. Their clothes were taken away from them when they came, dresses,\nbecause originally, nobody, no male has the right to go over there. So officially, it\u2019s not for\u2014the men\ncannot go. But there were coming men. The same as I could ask somebody to take me as an electrician,\nsomebody was going over. These people took advantage of these poor girls. It was very, very\u2014for bread\nor something. They were hungry. This is a fact. This was done by inmates because, with the inmates,\nnot everybody was a Natan Gierowitz or . There were ,",
        "Q: Non-Jewish inmates?",
        "A: Non-Jewish, yeah, no question about that.",
        "Q: Thad heard that there was some sort of bordello at Auschwitz. Do you know about this?",
        "A: The only bordello what I called was a gypsy camp. All the gypsies\u2014a lot prostitutes are between\ngypsies, a lot. (Inaudible). There was some beautiful women. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Who was allowed to go in there and take advantage of these\u2014",
        "A: Youcan always get in. Everything, you go out to work, you got something to do, all this. I think the\nSS took advantage of them too, outside them, yeah.",
        "Q: Any episodes of abuse of young boys in the camp?",
        "A: Notas far as I know.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you think we should talk about in terms of Auschwitz and the life there and\nwhat you learned that we haven\u2019t talked about yet?",
        "A: I think this story doesn\u2019t end with Auschwitz. There is a continuation of other camps. There are two\nother camps which have evacuation.",
        "Q: I wondered if there was anything else to cover to talk about before we\u2014A Auschwitz. That\u2019s what\nI\u2019m going to talk now is Auschwitz 2 or 3, other Auschwitz, but it\u2019s a labor camp. They evacuated us, the\nbeginning of 1945, in January, the beginning of January or end of December. I think it\u2019s January, the\nbeginning. (Inaudible). This is a coal mine. It is a place, an industrial place which is producing coal, and\nthis coal is being developed from . It\u2019s aspecial such pieces. It comes up. It\u2019s a platform, a\nbig platform, a railroad platform. Here comes railroad wagons, empty, and this side fire\nand coal. And then you take this out and put this in, and you have to the coal and put in this\nand the empty railroad wagons. This was after Auschwitz when I did nothing but sitting\ncome here and stay every day and work. So this was January, almost in February. February,\nthis city was . American or British or Soviet . We were all taken out\nand brought to a place which was called Lidice. Lidice is a big center, a railroad center. They are coming\nin trains from all parts of Poland, from Poland around from Germany and . Everything is\n. There were a few thousand of us, at least 5,000, 6,000, . We were waiting for a\ntrain to be able to pick us up and take us away. But the SS was so scared of the that they were\nstanding. The assessment took us, about 350 people.",
        "Q: All men?",
        "A: 350 people and said, let\u2019s go. And then we left Lidice, and we started to walk, and we walked, and\nit\u2019s mountain area, and it\u2019s February, and it\u2019s cold, and you go, and this assessment, they had luggage we\nshould carry for them up. So the head of this group, which was a sergeant or something, we called them\nthe . Do you know what is? No? The angel of death. It\u2019s Hebrew. He knows,\nright? You know Hebrew, do you? I forget that . So if he would see me one day not shaved,\nhe would take me to the end of the group and shoot me and leave me on the road. So there were four of\nus. We have to go four, like military. I was always between the four. I was shaved. We had this shaving\ncream from maybe a hundred years old, but you rubbed your face. You rubbed, you rubbed and dry, only\nto look like\u2014on the road, we met Russian prisoners of war, alone. They left already. (Inaudible). And\nwe came\u2014the first stop was that school, a village, that school. There\u2019s an empty school which is\nwith military. It\u2019s no school anymore. So it was Slovaks living, Slovaks. They brought\nus soup, . There was steps up, and so the soup was upstairs, and someone would give it to\neverybody. I don\u2019t know so much. So going up, one hit the other one by coincidence, and this other one\nlost his plate with the soup. So this guy said, who did it? He said, the sergeant, he said\u2014I talk about\nsomebody which I\u2019|l tell you a story about, a guy by the name . That was his name.\n(Inaudible). He was my age. He said, come. He said, not me, him, you know, by impulse, not me, it was\nhe, because he was a good man. He took out the other guy and killed him, and he survived all the way.\nThe story with them I told you about after September 9, the September first or the second came a group of\npeople who were found that . So here was this man, his wife and a child. The registration of\nthis group was not done. The group was brought to us. We shall register. (Inaudible). A few senior\npeople usually would go to the crematory because of age. You have women with small children who\nwould go to the crematory because of the small children. We have them here. So you can talk to them.\nYou can tell. So I started to talk to\u2014not to him, but to his wife and tell her, tell her. I said, when he\nwould come, a doctor, which is a military man, and I would suggest he will ask, is that your child? Don\u2019t\nsay it\u2019s yours. Don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s yours. It\u2019s possible they would take away the child, but you would\nsurvive. If you will keep the child, you will not survive. You will go and the child will go. So it\u2019s a\nquestion. I said according to my feelings, you have to give away the child only to survive because the\nGermans want to kill you too. So they did. And she did it this way. She let the child go, and the child\u2014\nand this couple, both of them, after the war, met and went to Israel. But he had on his conscience that\nsomebody\u2014he meant\u2014he couldn\u2019t\u2014he gave away the child. (Inaudible). He put her before a dilemma.",
        "Q: A lot of difficult choices?",
        "A: Sure. Sure. So we walked so long, from the assessment with us. He had civilian clothes under his\nuniform, and this son-of-a-gun found out, and he killed him. So the mayor from the village notified the\narmy, German soldier, the sergeant . The morning came, the military police came, got us all\ntogether and said, now you are not anymore under jurisdiction. We will take care of you, the\narmy. The army took us to a place called . It\u2019s\u2014what is it? It\u2019s another camp. We worked\nover there underground. They were making parts for tanks. This is already February. The Germans are\nstill making parts of tanks. Here are sitting people underground. This was murder. The Pollacks, they\nwere beating us up, because we came as old inmates. I had such a career of three years already. They\njust gave us a hard time and so on. Also, one day, must have been an order not to make any tanks\nanymore for the army, so we were all assembled in the morning. All from the 320 remained some 80 or\n70, because the rest are somewhere on the road.",
        "Q: They died along the way?",
        "A: They died. They were killed. He shot them. So no more Gestapo, only the army. (Inaudible). All\nthe Jewish step out. When he said, Jews step out, I said to myself, Iam not a Jew. I also\u2014my friend\u2014I\nhad a friend with me. He said, you will go with me. Let\u2019s go. I made a mistake. I know. So the\nnon-Jews were taken to a transport, a transport which was on its way to mountains.\nAuschwitz, the liquidation of Auschwitz inmates, that we found out later, but this transport was standing\nand waiting for more people between the non-Jews over there. The others were taken to\n3 . It was only ten kilometers from , was a Jewish and we didn\u2019t\nknow about the history that the commandant of refused, which was an assessment, refused to\nkill the people. He didn\u2019t want to do nothing. We were on our way to , but this transport\nnever came to . It was some Americans got them and freed everybody. This man and his\nfriend and 18 other people, this transport, after two days on the road, seven kilometers a day the train was\ngoing, we came to a place and I said to my friend, even if this transport was stopped some in\nCzechoslovakian territory, I'll jump. Ill not go to the end. They not take us to sanatoriums or\nsomething. They take us for liquidation. It\u2019s only ten percent. We have ten percent a chance. We have\nalready 19. We have ten percent. (Inaudible). The local population was a big railroad station, a lot of\nempty railroads on the tracks, railroad wagons and so on, and I see people jump, jumping and running,\njumping from the train. (Inaudible). There were hills, and they\u2019re running up. So I said to someone, the\nSS was busy with soups. The local community brought all kinds of soup and fed and, you know\u2014so I\njumped, and my friend jumped, and we went in one of the railroad wagons, empty and was there as long\nuntil about an hour or two hours later. The transport moved, and we stayed here. And came in some local\nminers it was mine territory\u2014and said, wait here. We will bring you clothes. Some men will come, and\nwe will pick you up, and we will bring you to some other place. After an hour, we had clothes. We had\nnormal clothes. And he was going, the men, taking. There was a group of 20, took us down a few\nkilometers and came in an underground. It was underground mines, not deep enough, not an elevator, but\nyou could go down. There already was straw, clean, was a doctor on premises. They did it like it was\n. They felt . So we were there until about three days, three days, and then we\nwent\u2014then we\u2014yeah, three days, no more. I\u2019m already in May. I\u2019m in May. So there were no Germans\nanymore. They took us to villages, put us in different families, and we were living and doing nothing.\nFood was provided. We were free to leave and to and everything. There was everything\navailable. It was everything normal until one day\u2014it was about the 7\" of May, 7\u201d of May, yeah\u2014came\nKGB and took us all, took us to a place where it was about a few thousand Russian former prisoners of\nwar, that big villa with a big backyard. People on the floor. I knew right away that we were with KGB. I\nsaw the people were shot down. These were Russians with the big suitcases. They robbed from the\nGermans and so on. I saw we were in a bad place. We stayed overnight underground. The next day\ncame out an old\u2014brought a little desk and started to make a list of people and the names and so on, and I\nsaw right away\u2014I knew Russian. I knew what it is. It\u2019s written list of arrested people or something like\nthat. So anyway, they took me another 24 hours. When it came to , | said, I\u2019m not Russian,\nI\u2019m Polish. I\u2019m from Warsaw, and I want to go home. You want to go home? Go to hell. Go. Now I\nwant to go to Prague. I didn\u2019t go home. I went to Prague. Prague is a Jewish community, and I\u2019m sure\nafter the war, they\u2019re taking care of\u2014maybe Suzy is back. That\u2019s this woman. So here is another\u2014so\nthere was not a railroad station. The train goes normal to Prague. It was not far from Prague too. May 9,\nMay 9, yes, we were still in the mines, and they came, Czechoslovakians, so happy you\u2019re here. Go. So\nI, again, with the Russian language, come to him, and it\u2019s a major, military major, tanks, big tanks. This\nwas on the way to Prague. It was an agreement between General and General\nEisenhower. You take Prague; we will take Berlin. So I come in, and I\u2019m going to this major, and I said,\n. I tell him there is a group of about 100 people. He doesn\u2019t know what I want from him. I\nsaid, what shall we do? He looks at me and said . Take a cane and go and screw your\nmother. I understand from Russian. (Inaudible). That is the meaning. That\u2019s what he told me.\n(Inaudible). I said goodbye to socialism, because I was waiting for him. We were waiting for\n.

        "Q: So you arrived in Feldafing?",

Then I became\u2014I\nstarted to open my mouth. It was under the supervision of this now famous General Patton. He said it\nwas about 25 kilometers from . (Inaudible). I was warning him from .

He didn\u2019t want nothing to do with me because I was\nagainst\u2014I felt and I shared the opinion that his wife wasn\u2019t on . So I started to talk, and I\nstarted to say\u2014there were already all kinds of organized groups, communists, survivors, like nothing had\nhappened, like nothing happened. (Inaudible). All the goodies which we had before the war and the\nghetto which is called Poland. It\u2019s a ghetto. But we played all these games. (Inaudible). They knew me\nfrom Poland because my name ,",
        "Q: Let me ask you something because you\u2019re sort of joking about this. Do you think this was good that\npeople were getting back to their life?",
        "A: Yes. It\u2019s just communists, and I don\u2019t know. Russia wasn\u2019t nice to them. My wife, I cannot\nmention nothing USSR, hate, hatred. Even they gave her an education. She finished, went to school and\neverything, but . The situation is such there are 6,000 people in this camp, young people, no\nold people. Old people didn\u2019t make it, the tragedy. Young people. Already pregnant women, children.\nAnd it\u2019s a lot of problems. So I\u2019m fighting, and I said to not to rely on the army, very nice and so on.\nAnd Mr. So-and-so is the president, doesn\u2019t do his job. He wants to complete them. (Inaudible). We\nhave to demand this and this. We have children. I developed a program, what we need. (Inaudible). The\nfeeling is you owe us for something. You have to give me something. It\u2019s not right. Nobody has to give\nyou nothing. I went because I miss something, some I miss. (Inaudible). And I survived,\nnot because I am a big , not because I\u2019m a big hero. I didn\u2019t fight. I only tried my belly\nshould be full and my health should be all right. Oh, yes, it bothered me when I saw children was going\nto the\u2014but at the same time -- (Inaudible). When you went to make a summary, it\u2019s\u2014you cannot\nand say you have to give me like some people are involved in the American situation of the\nholocaust. I don\u2019t want to mention names because they know me and they don\u2019t like me. But we\nspend\u2014I make them possible to come. I help them to come to America because\u2014this is another thing. I\nwas sending out people to the United States. I was involved in for members of the\n, of the Zionists, from Bundists (ph). I was involved in such. That\u2019s why I was sitting two\nyears . So that\u2019s what I started to do. And we decided to have elections. We had elections,\nand we elected a board. There was meetings, everything. Little by little, we are\u2014understand and it was\n. It\u2019s\u2014I couldn\u2019t\u2014I got involved with immigration because Jewish Labor Committee was\non my back and international committee. Anyway, but I never, never, never used\u2014\nsomebody said, you have to do it. In America, they didn\u2019t go through what we\u2019re doing through. They\u2019re\nnot. (Inaudible). If I didn\u2019t want to go to , there are other choices. If I would have\n, | wouldn\u2019t be here. I would go over there. If you are a Zionist here, that is the place. I was\nraised that different . SO to the United States. (Inaudible). So I can talk to\nyou. (Inaudible). This is something which happened. The meaning is that somebody wanted us to\nliquidate, and they couldn\u2019t do it, and nobody could do it. They couldn\u2019t do it. We were too intelligent\nand too everything. We had something to\u2014in the family of nations, we have, in my opinion, a very\nimportant place. We\u2019re contributing a lot to them. So then came the joint. There was a lady I remember,\nthe social worker. She was a native American. When you speak English, you translate from English to\n. You say . (Inaudible). You do not say \u201cyou.\u201d I just met you. I say\n, 1n the third person. He said to me . He tried to speak to me in\n. I didn\u2019t know English. I still don\u2019t know, but then I knew less. So she said to me\u2014I\ntook it because I\u2019m a . (Inaudible). was on the black market and had\nto make a living. So I said\u2014she misunderstood. (Inaudible). I said, because I\u2019m a European. She\u2019s an\nAmerican. She cannot talk to me like I\u2019m nothing and so on. So then came to me\u2014one day came to me a\nman in uniform. He said to me, I\u2019m so-and-so; I\u2019m the translator to Judge Jackson. Jackson was a head\njudge in trial. Iam friends with him. from French and from Russian.\nWhat was his name? He was a journalist by profession. He volunteered. Told me when the war started,\nhe volunteered, and this was his assignment. (Inaudible). He said, here I have a list, a list of names.\nJewish Labor Committee sent to me. I should go and find. I cannot do it. (Inaudible). He said, between\nyou and me, I\u2019m under surveillance. I\u2019m that job where they say, what is this man doing? I have no right\nto do this, to get in touch with people in the camps. Please, will you take it? And I took it. So I got\ninvolved. So I got involved in helping people to immigrate. And in the meantime would come all kinds\nof commissioners to take people who want to go . There are all kinds of professions who\nwere ready to go and work some . So International Ladies Garment Union was my\ncustomer, in Canada had customers and so on. And I got involved, and I would serve this committee\nwhen who would come and select people. It was a continuation of my work. (Inaudible).

        "A: My name is Natan Gierowitz, and I was born November 27, 1907, in a little called\n, which is not far from a larger Jewish community, Bialystok, in the vicinity of Bialystok. I\nwas raised by a grandfather. When I was three months old, my grandfather came and picked me up. My\nmother was a student at the University of Warsaw and was arrested for socialist activities against the\nCharles (ph) regime. Since three months old, I was raised by my grandfather. I never saw my mother. I\nsaw my father only once. That was in August, 1940. He was\u2014he escaped from Serbia, some slave labor\ncamp and stopped for a night. I remember, still remember some guy, some man asked me I should go to\nsleep with him that night. And I refused because I was sleeping\u2014at this time, I was sleeping with my\nstep-grandmother. My grandfather lost two wives, and that was a step-grandmother. I went to school, to\nthe public school in the city, and I became a troubled child. By 12 years old, 13 years old, I was already\nsmoking cigarettes. I would be after the girls in the high school. It was mixed. I remember I would go in\nthe toilets, the partitions, I would go up and look over and kind of\u2014so my grandfather was already\nwidowed. He lost his third wife. So he had a friend\u2014by the way, he was an attorney. He was an\nattorney. He was a very interesting human being, a big, heavy man. He was drinking a lot of tea, a lot\n. He had a friend, another attorney who suggested to do something with his grandchild.\nGermany has all kinds of institutions, which is a combination of school and . It\u2019s very strong\ndiscipline. You cannot go by yourself. It\u2019s like a military regime. And I was sent to Germany. I came to\nGermany. I was three years in Germany. I want to tell you that three years in such an institution where\nonly rich children are there, it\u2019s a very elegant\u2014show you how to do all your life when\nyou\u2019re invited to and so on. So I came back. After three years, I came back. I was about seventeen years\nold, seventeen years old. And then I went\u2014I was sent to Krakow, and I attended the business school of\nthe University of Krakow. It\u2019s a very good university, by the way. And Krakow is a beautiful city. So I\nspent a year over there, and I came back, and I got a job at some . Imet some little ol\u2019 boys\nand so on. I was sitting already with some young people, which I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re alive\n. We were very active at this time, and we are talking about the end of the \u201820\u2019s, \u201828, \u201829. It\nwas a very strong movement . This was a group of us sitting and starting . Twas\ndoing this. I went . So then\u2014and that was before service in the British army. Then I went\nto military service, two years. When I came back, I decided, because the regime and the relationship\nbetween Jewish and non-Jewish soldiers, the relationship from the command , | started to\nthink about myself as a Jew, and I joined the . It was a very active Jewish socialist democrat\nmovement. I signed the in a little of 12,000 Jews and grandson\nbecame . Tailors, shoemakers, lower class, that was the mentality of the Jewish\ncommunity. And grandson became\u2014I remember I was .

        "A: Inthe camp?",
        "A: Ipersonally didn\u2019t experience, but I knew politics. I knew more or less what the Polish government\npolicy was with the Jewish people, force us out of positions, business positions. My friends wanted to go\nand study medicine or engineering or something, couldn\u2019t be approved for studying in the university. I\ntell you, one time I had one of my friends who went to college to study medicine in ,\n(Inaudible). That was the policy. There was nothing to support\u2014I tell you, I was sent to ;\nwhich is a city, when the war started, I was there. (Inaudible). Then I came to . I functioned\nas an organizer. I was involved in a strike. There was in the city, big factories belonged to\nJews. So I became involved together with the Polish\u2014the socialist and labor movement, and I was\nsix weeks in this factory. As a result, I was arrested, thrown in jail. After about\nsix weeks, I don\u2019t remember how much, first of all, I got an infection, a skin infection. I came out and I\nwent to . And I became well again, and I continued my and ultimately started the\nwar. In 1939 the war started. The war started. The policy of the was to support this war. This\nis a war against Hitler. We as Jews, as Pollacks, good citizens of Poland, we have to go. We have to go\nand fight. So I volunteered. I was not accepted because of my . Even then, when the war\nstarted, it made a difference between socialist Jew\u2014I was a . But I know Russian. I know\nthe language very well. (Inaudible). I was sent to the , which took care of me. They\nintroduced me to some guy which was a . What the Russian said\u2014what the communist\nsaid\u2014the Russian USSR was organizing cooperatives in the villages. (Inaudible). This time\nit was the USSR service. I knew Russian, and they needed . He gave mea job. But before\nthe job, I was invited to the KGB. It\u2019s an experience. From 12 midnight I should come to see somebody,\nthe KGB. So I come in at night. This building is a building for the courts, the Polish courts. Now\ncame\u2014and the jail was part of this building. (Inaudible). So you\u2019re coming in that big hall\u2014I remember\nnow\u2014and you see the darkness, and you know what KGB is, and you know that you are a socialist, and\nyou know the socialists are social fascists, the Bolsheviks. I said you are in trouble. And you hear\nscreaming people. These people are being tortured. And you see people are being brought in from the\njail with guns this way. You know what the feeling it is. It\u2019s a special feeling. So you know\u2014he came\nfor me. After an hour, I was smoking cigarettes and this was my agent for all the time. His\nexistence was partly because of me, to watch if I behave myself or not. And I still was on the job. So I\nwas on the job. I had a normal life, no socialism. I was sitting very quiet. I needn\u2019t open my mouth.\nKeep my mouth shut because, you know, KGB is watching you.",
        "A: No. it\u2019s called. But we call it . KGB is the same as . So I was\nquiet until June 22\", 1940 or \u201841, the Bolsheviks, 1941. Russia\u2014the German attacked the USSR. Hitler\nstarted his March in Moscow.",
        "A: Yes and no, because all the businesses were mostly Jewish, so the business people got lost.\n(Inaudible). There were some people\u2014Russia was so big that you send away people and you forget about\nthem, especially Jews. It was antisemitism too, but this was the class, you know, especially in countries\nwhere they took over so you have to eliminate the class of capitalism. It was a little . He was\nalready a capitalist. So basically, it was and it was not antisemitism. Basically, Jews were sitting very,\nvery quiet. Then Germany, in three weeks was fully liberated. (Inaudible). But this part, this part was\n. The was taken over very fast. First came in Hungarian troops which did the job\nfor Russia because Russia couldn\u2019t spare any occupation. So came in and Gestapo. Gestapo\nwas everywhere. KGB is Gestapo. When the war started and Russians started to evacuate, it was a\npublically. Whoever wanted to be evacuated to the Russians should come . I didn\u2019t\nknow what goes on in Poland where the Germans were already because the policy of Russians at this time\nwas the friendship between Hitler and Stalin. So they wouldn\u2019t let us in the papers which were published\nin this part of the world. There was nothing written about what Hitler is doing to the Jews in Poland\n. So I know German too. I spent three years in Germany . [know German well.\n(Inaudible). And I know about what the Russian says, and I was right because those who went to the\nRussians went to live in Siberia and other places.",
        "A: No, in Poland.",
        "A: Germany, there was no revolution. They were fighting, and they were winning the war. The\nGermans were fighting and winning the war. Do you understand? So I was called to answer who was\nafter me. They were crying. The crying became like the family, their own police and so on. And we\nwent through the first, when the Gestapo came in after a week or two weeks, they called in, the\nJewish had already\u2014the Jewish had an existing Jewish community council, because according to the law,\nthe Polish law, this was an expression of democracy. Jewish had the right to elect their own\nrepresentatives and a council which would deal with education, and welfare and so on and the\nright to tax the Jewish population. So when they came in, when the Germans came in, the\nhad already an organized group. They came to talk and demand. So the president of this council was\ncalled in and was asked to submit a list of everybody who belonged to the so-called Jewish intelligence,\nteachers, medical profession, law profession, a list of all these people to submit to the KGB, to the KGB.\nA list was submitted, and after a few days, each person who was on this list was called in to the KGB\nthe Gestapo. Those people never came back. (Inaudible). It was a liquidation of the\nintelligence, so there was no leadership anymore between the Jews. (Inaudible). And then came the\nnight, the first night of Rosh Hashanah. At night, police, German police, was going from house to house.\nBefore this, each house or each home which was Jewish, you had to put on your window a Star of David.\nSo the non-Jew knew the Jews. If you were a Jew, you know where to go. So at night, they were going\nfrom house to house and telling them, you are going to labor camp, get your belongings and come out to\nthe marketplace. There was a marketplace, typical Eastern European. So we went out. There was\nalready a few thousands Jews. There was trucks already. The old people were loaded in the\ntrucks and they left. The rest were walking into the Jewish cemetery. The cemetery was already prepared\nand the Jewish would come to this\u2014",
        "A: Uh-huh. There was a desk. They were about seven or eight Gestapo. (Inaudible). There was all\nkinds of litter. And a Jew would come from the desk, one of them talk back, down. (Inaudible). Over\nthere in the back were people, about 5,000 or 6,000 . By 7 o\u2019clock in the evening, they\nstopped killing. So everybody who was in the back was still alive. And they said, go home. And\neverybody went home. So this night must have been about 4,000 or 5,000 people. We left about 4,000 or\n5,000 of our people . And after this, he gave an order to close the ghetto. 4,000 or 5,000\npeople less, you don\u2019t need so much housing for these goddamn Jews. So the Jews had to move out and\nlive in places where they put people . SO we moved out; the Gentiles moved in. They moved\nin. Okay. I happened to live in a building with three or floors . A lot of Italians\nwere working. They were in construction. So it was important labor. So this building belonged to an\nItalian. The rest\u2014he lived by himself, was a young man, he lived by himself. (Inaudible). I had a room\nby one of the tenants which was a couple and two young girls. So I lived over there. And\nafter this , you have to get used to it. Somebody this time didn\u2019t come back. I don\u2019t take it\nso tragically. It happened. This was Germany. This was what we went through, and this is what we\nwould still go through. (Inaudible). It\u2019s something which\u2014first of all, I think 1t was\u2014you\u2019re all of a\nsudden isolated from the . You\u2019re isolated. You always have in your mind that somebody\nwill come and take you out. You don\u2019t know what or when. They will take you out, and you\u2019!l never\ncome back. Your mind is being transformed into something which thinks of the most tragic way of\ndying. Because people were going to war. we want 50 people to go to labor for tomorrow\nmorning. There have to be 50 people. There are still rich people in the ghetto. The rich people are in the\nsame ghetto that Iam. But the rich people have something, a diamond or the gold or .

        "A: Mentality. And then there\u2019s a lot of\u2014you are ready to\u2014if you want to look and see what is the\nreality, what will be the end here. The end is you have to die here. (Inaudible). You should be able to sit\nduring the war, and then you will come out. You have to die here, period. So it\u2019s now or later. So first\nof all, the people could buy something in the market, could physically because there was no\ntemple. There were no schools for the children. There was nothing, nothing. There was an order that\neach Jew, you know, they have this . After we shaved, the cynicism was so far that even they\nremember the beard after we shaved. You know that all the Jewish are very -- you know, they are\u2014this\niS more important than . SO what would become such an a member of the Gestapo\nand walk around of the ghetto and they\u2019 ll see the beard . So that was the ghetto.\nThen there was a part of the ghetto was a place where they would bring in Jews from some other places\n. There was part of the ghetto. We knew what was going on. And then what happens, as I\nsaid, the poor people are getting\u2014-starting to revolt in the ghetto. Sure. They were hungry. (Inaudible).\nThat was the ghetto. It was a nice president. It was . I was witness to a very nice person\nwho was the president of the ghetto . Anyway, so I made up my mind that I have to go out.\n(Inaudible). Pll die of hunger or I'll die because . No. [have to go out. I want to go out and\ndo something.",
        "A: The ghetto was closed in October, 1942, and I left in May, 1943.",
        "A: No. Yes. October, November, yes. I left in May. So I mention that this house belongs to the\nItalian. The Italian was smart. He wanted to buy . So he said to me, Natan, do you want to\nmake a few bucks? (Inaudible). Buy me . Buy me gold. (Inaudible). Some people would\ncome from . He would sell it and make profit.

I wanted to find some comrades from . I wanted to do something, not\njust sit around. Ill die anyway. It\u2019s always you\u2019ll die anyway, so do something. I took a room in the\nhotel. I told you before that the hotel was and at night, it was interesting. It was in my mind\nto watch through the window and understand, see how the soldiers the movement. Anyway,\none day, I decided how can I get in contact with the ghetto. Again, I met\u2014no, I went to see the ghetto\n. The entrance was\u2014one side was a Gentile, non-Jewish part, and there was a big,\ntremendous building which went\u2014the entrance\u2014it had two entrances. One was and the\nother was . SO you came in, you had a police on this side. You go in. Then you go out. He\nasked to bribe him. You have to pay him. So I went in and I went in and I looked at the ,\n(Inaudible). What my attention was the , transportation. Do you know what\nis? It\u2019s a Japanese\u2014a man to get an erection. (Inaudible). Very elegant men and women.",
        "A: Inthe ghetto. The is here. Have a good time. We would sit and wait. We have\nmoney. There is a beautiful restaurant. (Inaudible). It\u2019s daytime, 1 or 2 0\u2019clock, I don\u2019t remember what\nit was. Full of people, music and dance and men and women, elegant dancing.",
        "A: Jewish people.",
        "A: Inthe Warsaw ghetto. This was sick. We will die tomorrow, so let\u2019s have a good time. That was\nthe impression in the ghetto.",
        "A: Iam in this building where you\u2019re going in. When you come in, it\u2019s like\u2014TI don\u2019t know if you had a\nchance sometimes in the stock market on Wall Street to see . Business, business, non-Jewish,\nPollacks, and the Pollacks and business . You see some steps outside, a guy\nwhich I know very well. I remember him. He was the pianist in . He was a _ It\nwas at this time in the 20\u2019s and was the year the pianist was playing the music. So this guy was the\npianist, and I knew him very well. He saw me, he said. He called me by my name, my\nRussian name. he calls me. He\u2019s a very nice guy, and I spent with him already a few hours,\nand I told him what my purpose is. So he made up he was trying to find somebody and the\ntime would come again. I left again. I left him $10 and I left. (Inaudible). So let\u2019s see\noccupy Poland. So I had friends who survived. He, his wife, two boys. (Inaudible). I tell you how close\nwe are, if I told you I came back from after six weeks being in jail, I needed $150 to go into\u2014to be taken\ncare of. I had nothing. I needed $150 to pay in advance. Do you understand? We were meeting in the\nsame restaurant. He was working and I . He said, what\u2019s new? I tell him the story and tell\nhim it\u2019s $150. He takes it out and says, here. This was the beginning of a friendship. When I was living\nin the ghetto in , he and two sisters. One sister didn\u2019t make it, but one sister survived, and he\nsurvived. In this same building, this lady with these two children was a widow, so they married each\nother. They are here . One is a consultant with Hughes Aircraft, big shot engineer. He gave\nme . His sister who survived was married to a non-Jew. (Inaudible). He had no right to be\nwith a Jewish woman. If Gestapo would find out, he would be the same\u2014he would have the same\nas a Jew which lived with a non-Jewish woman. Do you understand? Anyway, they were a\nvery nice couple, and he was very nice, and he told me you want\u2014the best way is you go to ;\nif you know where is. (Inaudible). This is a very long Polish phrase. Rich people would go\nto , beautiful country. I know this place. He tells me, you go to and in\nyou have to find somebody. Somewhere in there is a place called ,\nThe water eyes or something . There are three waters coming together, Poland, Hungary\nand Czechoslovakia. The best way is to try to go to Hungary. From Hungary, a lot of people would go\n. So I went upstairs. I was thinking, you cannot move all of a sudden because of the dogs\nwatching, barking. I just gave up. I said to myself, . [went back. For the first time\n. I saw the first time a guy who was in in Poland. (Inaudible). He\nwouldn\u2019t say nothing. You couldn\u2019t provoke him to talking. He said, let me alone, don\u2019t bother me.",
        "A: Yeah. He was afraid. So I\u2019m sitting over there going back to Warsaw. I\u2019m going to visit some other\nfriends who were over there, he and his wife and his mother-in-law. This guy was a guy who was an\nofficial of a bank in Warsaw before the war. There were a lot of Polish community ,\n(Inaudible). I told him, listen, I\u2019m crazy. I cannot\u2014I have to go. I wanted to go. I want to go outside.\nHe made contacts with the Polish underground. In the meantime, there is a lady which was my first love\nsomewhere far away from Warsaw. It was . When the Bolsheviks as a doctor,\nM.D. (Inaudible). Beautiful woman, very beautiful. Looks like ten Gentiles, blond and very elegant and\neverything. I\u2019m getting in touch, and I know . Come on out . I tell her who it\nis. (Inaudible). I said, . We are ready to go. (Inaudible). We would live together,\n, nothing special to sleep together but to be together because doesn\u2019t come here in\nyour mind. I want to save her. I want to save her. (Inaudible). I went and I brought her to Warsaw.\n(Inaudible). And she was a very capable lady. She wanted to do some shopping at that store.\n(Inaudible). My friend who had the Polish contacts. So I called him, and I said, I want to do something.\nYou have to do me a favor. At the same time, you\u2019ll recetve some money as soon as possible. He said\nis the city when you come to Krakow, you have to change trains. You have to wait\n. 40\u2019clock in the morning we have to . (Inaudible). I should go in this\nto be able to make small sacrament . Okay. (Inaudible). She said, please don\u2019t\ndo it. Something happened, please, she begs me. I said, oh, women\u2019s intuition and ignored it. Anyway, I\ngo and buy a ticket for round trip, and I\u2019m going down . 1 go down on the train\nand special police to watch the railroad. \u2019m with my . He came to me and he\nsaid, Polish, Jewish. I said, what? Let\u2019s go to the police. We\u2019ll check. (Inaudible). I said, how much do\nyou want? I had three 50\u2019s, $150. It wasn\u2019t much. I didn\u2019t take money because sometimes the Germans\nwould stop the train and look because all the black market was going to trains. So I didn\u2019t want to take it\nbecause I need money . And I gave him I take out, I said, there\u2019s my money. So he takes\ntwo 50\u2019s and gives me 50 back and said, go. So I survived. The second time, when I was in the Warsaw\nghetto and I came out, I came out and gave the policeman and I walked and I feel\nsomebody\u2019s after me because you have the feeling like somebody is always after you. Some people\naren\u2019t paying attention, but I think he looks at me. Somebody is after me. And you look and see a man\nuntil he comes and says, you\u2019re Jewish. So I sat and talked to him, blah, blah, blah, and went\ninto a bar, drink a bottle of Vodka. (Inaudible). I had a kilo. A kilo is two and a half bottles. It was in\nthe chimney. So I had the money. And he asked me what I\u2019m doing here. I told him that\nand to buy saccharine because the Jews were so smart they were making saccharine in the ghetto with the\nfactory. (Inaudible). No sugar, saccharine. I give him this story, and he said, here\u2019s my address. Go\nback to in case you need something and you come and get in touch with me. (Inaudible). So\nI\u2019m going and I\u2019m going to Krakow. It\u2019s 7 o\u2019clock at night. You almost don\u2019t see any people. It\u2019s\nOctober 4\"\"-5\", which was I was arrested in October the night of 5\"-6\". (Inaudible). I\u2019m still 30 years\nold. Today I\u2019m \u201887. It\u2019s 30 years old. Come on, what are you drinking, Pollack? (Inaudible). So I sit,\nand so I\u2019m going to with the baggage or something and ask him where there\u2019s a place because\nhotels are all taken. So he takes me to such houses occupied . Today it is bed and breakfast,\nsomething like that, but not as elegant and as nice. It\u2019s in Poland. And he tells me, . She\ngives me a room and a bed. I\u2019m undressing and putting on pajamas and getting ready for bed. And\nsomebody . Open. He said open. and right away _ I\nknew this was not Gestapo. This was military police. So I knew already. Do you see what they\u2019re\ndoing? They\u2019re taking him to the Gestapo. They\u2019re taking . (Inaudible). So I\u2019m starting to\nthink, and he hits me. As soon as he hits me, I said, yes, I cannot take it. I do not and I\ncannot hit back. I have to give up. I\u2019m ready for this. I was ready. Yes. I got arrested. He brings me to\nstill not Gestapo, still military police who are stationed, the police station, the military police station.\nThey put me in a cell, and I put up my collar, and I fell asleep. Then somebody wakes me at 8:00 in the\nmorning. The sergeant calls me in and starts to ask\u2014he had my wallet. I had some pictures. They didn\u2019t\ntake it. And I started to talk to him. I said, I know . This time was already _ I\nsaid, I need you found outside of his place, this ghetto or places where he has to be,\narrest and execution. So I know . But I start . And I tell him to send me to the\nGestapo. I know what Gestapo does. (Inaudible). Take me out and . He said, what are you\ntalking about? (Inaudible). He said, you will work and help us to win the war. Anyway, he gives me\u2014\nafter ten minutes, here comes an older soldier, and we start working, and I know that I work for the\nGestapo. This I know. I go and I start talking to him in German and tell him take me to\nthe Gestapo. You know what the Gestapo is, what Gestapo is going to do with me and give him all the\nsmear (ph). The street cars would come to a stop, and here come the street cars to a stop. (Inaudible).\nAnd he said to me, go. He let me go. I\u2019m jumping inside. He\u2019s jumping after me. (Inaudible). I talk to\nhim. He wasn\u2019t sure. Here are a lot of people. I could not talk to him and tell him to help me. And he\nbrought me to the Gestapo.\n(End of Tape 2)\nTape 3\nSo they brought me to the Gestapo. One man started asking me all kinds of questions. There are pictures\nin my suitcase. I had photos, my grandfather. It was . It was my mother\u2019s. We\u2019re funny\npeople. I never saw my mother, and I was keeping her picture. It\u2019s something. So I said, they are\nalready cremated, forget it. It was a bad excuse. (Inaudible). , he says, in the corner, go\nback. So I am going, and I\u2019m standing this way. Turn around with your face to the wall. I turn around.\n(Inaudible). The first time that each male Jew was . I didn\u2019t know that Israel was\n. I think they are coming. I hear two voices, two . A conversation begins, what\nare we going to do with this Israel? (Inaudible). How will we kill the ? With my legs up and\nhead down. (Inaudible). So you hang me. So after some 20 minutes, 25 minutes, somebody\u2014I know\nsomebody came in. He said, turn around. I look, and I see two policemen from the Ghetto. I recognize\nthem, the cross of David. (Inaudible). Everything is yellow, light brown. (Inaudible). They said to me,\ncome on. I am going down, down, and there 1s a coach, and there was a horse. We sit down, and I ask\nhim, where are we going? He says, you\u2019re going to go in jail. I said, jail? Yes, in the Ghetto, the jail,\nyou go. (Inaudible). I said, you\u2019re not going to kill me? They said, we don\u2019t know nothing about it.\n(Inaudible). Only to put you in jail and that\u2019s all. And I\u2019m coming to the Ghetto Krakow. The jail was\none big room was for men, and the other big room was for women. And the men was about 50, 60\npeople. (Inaudible). And you\u2019re so confused. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here. I said, what? He\nsaid, nothing. This is the jail. (Inaudible). I tell them who I am and what I am. They start to look at me\ndifferent. (Inaudible). And they\u2019re all family. They\u2019re family. (Inaudible). There are Jews. (Inaudible).\nThey share with me. They share a lot of things. There are a few older people. The rest was young\npeople. I said, why are we separated? Why can not we be with the women and be with them together?\n(Inaudible). There was a policeman, a Jew. Gestapo will come in every day and look. If he will see\nsomebody unshaved and say come and kill him. (Inaudible). Right away. Or he didn\u2019t like your face, he\nkilled you. (Inaudible). Maybe you play a lottery, you understand? Maybe you will be next. Nobody\nknows. So I said to this Jewish policeman, I said, what are you doing? We are sitting here on borrowed\ntime. They are the same, and we are the same. (Inaudible). We want to sit and talk, to be able to talk like\nhuman beings. It will be better for us, for them and for us. We want this. (Inaudible). It was established\na time 46 or 47, some two hours socializing. (Inaudible). Then it was a man who was a representative of\nthe . Germany occupied Poland. During the occupation, the had the right to exist\nto bring some welfare to the Jewish people. lived in Krakow in the\nGhetto. (Inaudible). All of a sudden, I\u2019m getting sent bread, half a bread for me. They find out my\nname. (Inaudible). He found out. Anyway, we were sitting one week, two weeks. Then came October\nand December.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: No. Nobody knew. These guys, as I told you, . It was a non-Jewish person.\n(Inaudible). I think December 19 -- about two days, about 16, 17, should shave our heads. Why? I\nwondered why. This is a . (Inaudible). In the Polish, . This is a Jewish jail. I\nhave my rights. Anyway, he said, be quiet. He said, we have nothing to say. We are not Gestapo.\nGestapo will come and check and see if you are shaved or not, and if not, they will kill you. (Inaudible).\nSo we are shaved. Anyway, the night came trucks, trucks. We are loaded in the trucks. The German\noccupation knew that we were being evacuated. The people came with bread, loaves of bread. Each one\ngot a loaf of bread. So we\u2019re\u2014so the Polish were sitting in Krakow. When the trucks moved, they said,\nwe are going to the railroad station; and at the railroad, we are going to . We are going to\nthe railroad station. The transport of thousands and thousands and thousands of men, Pollacks, Gentiles,\nnot Jews. We are the only Jewish part of this transport. Supposedly, it was a transport of 7,000 from all\nkinds in the occupied Poland. (Inaudible). So they put us in. We are sitting already in the train, and the\ntrain moves. These are closed railroads. (Inaudible). Closed. In Europe, they are different. There is a\nwindow. There is somewhere a window, a window that a human body can go through. So all of a\nsudden, there\u2019s every two wagons is a man with a machine gun. It\u2019s snow. We are going in the snow on\nthe way from Krakow to , which is a few hours\u2019 drive by train. It\u2019s snow. All of a sudden,\nthe machine gun. What happened? The women started to jump. So after four or five jumped, the train\nwas stopped. And they came into the Jewish part. They said somebody was killed. They knew that there\nwas women there. If at the next stop one will be missing, all of you will be killed. (Inaudible). There\nwas a boy came in one night. One night came in a boy hysterical, a young boy hysterical. What\nhappened? Only you can help me. I have to go. I cannot be here. They are after me. He is a politician.\nHe was sent in the city to buy something or something. And they\u2019re after him. They knew. They are\nlooking for him. So he came through the opening\u2014supposedly this jail is on the verge of Ghetto. On the\nother side is the Ghetto. And in Ghettos there are all kinds of things going on. He said, [ll take you.\nLet\u2019s try to escape from here. But you have to go with me. I need people to go, and we will be on the\nother side. I'll find you a place. There are friends, comrades there and so on. Anyway, we didn\u2019t go, but\nhe was so hysterical. I remember him a lot, a long time, this boy, and I\u2019m sure he just ,\nAnyway, we are going and we are coming to . It must be already the end of the day,\ncame to . This is a stop of trains. Trains were unloaded, and when you stop and they open the\ndoor and say, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out. Everything is right away, you come. Right away.\nThere are people saying up, up, up, run, run, run. Where do yourun? Yourun. And some people with\nblack and white uniforms, stripes, taking your suitcase away from you, everything from you and pull it\naway. You are out. You have nothing. And you feel, what happened? You have nowhere to go. Maybe\nsomebody will get killed. And dogs are everywhere. Everything that condition for fear\nfrom despair, not to encourage you to fight. Forget about fight. Fight is\u2014you\u2019re right about fighting, but\nyou don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s true. Do you understand? So here comes a and then somebody comes\n. This voice starts talking to you, Jewish or Polish or German. (Inaudible). You got to the\ncamp. Part of you has been sent to the crematory. Right away. (Inaudible)",
        "A: (Inaudible). This commander has the name . (Inaudible). is something that\neverything 1s all right and , kind of goodness and so on because they have it. They control\nhow the .

They say you can become unionized, join unions. (Inaudible). We\nwalk, and when you walk, I tell you about the time of the . There is an in the\nmornings and an in the evenings when the commanders come back from work. So there are\npeople, and there are barracks. They are already made. They\u2019re already made and put them together\nalready. It\u2019s kind of about 350, 400 people. (Inaudible). So each was separate. So there are the people\nlook like . People lost everything, the weight and so on, become . Lwasa\n. And then people on the floorcan be __ dead because they have to be counted. You\nsee? Hitler doesn\u2019t believe that somebody was\u2014no, you bring him from . You bring him\nback here, and you have to bring him here. He should see him. He should count. And those people were\nnot able to stay on your feet. (Inaudible). And you have bread and you don\u2019t know what happened.\nHence, one man asking you for bread. They see people with bread, so they\u2019re asking you. Can you\nimagine? And everybody is close . They\u2019re back from the people who are being\n. (Inaudible). Germany. So what do you do with the bread? (Inaudible). What if\nyou refuse somebody the bread? You don\u2019t know that tomorrow you\u2019ll be hungry. You don\u2019t think about\nit. They are people. What happens in some places is they go after the bread, 5, 6, 7 people. Right away\nsomebody is there and starts\u2014there is always somebody ready with something to hit you, always. This is\nthe way how you\u2019re being greeted in . (Inaudible). In my case, we are being placed in a\nbarrack, in about two or three barracks. No . Nothing. We sit in these barracks. No food.\nNobody gives a damn what happens. We sleep all night. Then the next day, they start to call out people.\nHere is our transport, separate. So everybody has to stay around. There is a young man with stripes and\nso on, calls everything in German. Whose name is an A, starts with A, step out. A, B, C, you know.

This is famous, French attack the\nNorway, make a landing in Norway and lost . Do you understand? So he was between\nthem, and he was a POW, a prisoner of war. When they found out the prisoner of war was Jewish, they\nsent him to , was a camp where the Jews went to be ,\nYou never heard about ? It was a . So he was in , and from\nhe went\u2014in July \u201842, he came and he\u2019s one of the big people would give you the names\nand write your paper where you are and what you are and everything.

There are Kopos (ph). And if you\ndon\u2019t work, he doesn\u2019t like how you work and what you work, you will not be able to come. You should\nknow this. Here you can beat somebody so long until he\u2019s dead and nothing will happen to you. These\npeople who beat you with exception, some exception. Some people were intelligent people too. Some\nprofessors who became murderers. (Inaudible). I\u20191l do something for him. So I feel better. I\u2019m getting\nthe name and everything, and I\u2019m going, and we are in quarantine. Everything was quarantine.",
        "A: Nothing. You see?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. We\u2019re still waiting. (Inaudible). It was late in the evening already. They started to do this. In\nthe beginning, I tried not to hit my head. (Inaudible). It\u2019s so stupid. Anyway, he said to me, don\u2019t play\n. So after quarantine, then people were going to different commanders. Three of us from our\ngroup were going to , young boys.",
        "A: was a special commander who worked only in crematory. He did everything but\n. The gas was put through a little window by a German. This was such a holy job. A\nJew for sure not, but a non-Jew, a Gentile, no. A German has to do this to murder. So this was under\ncommand. What was this other commander doing? In the military, you go, it takes you\u2014and they are\ntalking about crematory. I tell you about crematory. (Inaudible). The crematory, more or less, is very\nsimple. It\u2019s a big place with ovens. You go, there is an opening from the oven. It can be 2, 3, 4,5. And\nthe wagons to take out the dead people and put them in the oven and push. By the way, you start the fire\nwith fat people because they burn better. The technique so far, the German technique and science is you\nneed a fat man, a fat Jew. So push him in the crematory and he will burn. This is everything. When you\ncome out and you have time to think, you think about what I mention. It\u2019s something unbelievable. Our\nchildren, children takes longer to die from the gas. When the commander guys, this is a big haul, there\nare all kinds of signs, a shower room. When you come in, you think because you have to\nundress yourself. The commanders have to help you, men and women. Then you\u2019re being shaved, totally\nshaved, a woman totally shaved. Imagine what that must do to this woman. So this is what he is doing.\nThen they put them one, one, one in this big which you can put in a thousand people, one by\none. So tense, and you put the gas. After an hour, most of the people are on the floor. Children not yet.\nChildren took longer to die. (End of Tape 3)\nTape 4\nSo children are still standing up. So again, the commander has to come. And I don\u2019t know. So the\nchildren have the gas already inside. Do you understand? But they are still not down. They would need\nanother ten minutes\u2019 gas. So this problem was solved. I never asked. By the way, I am by\nbecause I was inside. I was in the crematory. Sometimes in 1944, supposedly came a\ntransport from Vienna, Gentiles, mixed Jews and non-Jews. Everybody went . The\ncommandant . Then they realized a day later or something that in the group were Gentiles,\nnot Jews. This is not allowed. So what to do? There\u2019s only one thing to do, that\u2019s tattoo them. Give\nthem a number. That means that they are in that camp, that everything is all right and then something\nhappens to them and because they die, they go to the oven. So we went. So yes. I forget\nto tell you. (Inaudible). I'll come back to this.",
        "A: Allright. So I volunteered. He asks people who were in the group which was doing registration was\nasked to volunteer five people and told us what to do . These people are dead already, but you\nhave to give them numbers and so on. So you need more people because the dead men cannot tell you,\ntake my hand. You have to do everything for him. So I said I wanted to go. I want to go. I wanted just\nto see, just to see. Ill die, so PIl at least know where I\u2019m being buried. (Inaudible). So I went, and so it\nwas dead people, and I made the numbers. So I saw more or less how the structure of it being built and so\non because it was very scientifically done and everything. It was a genius.",
        "A: The ovens, especially done very efficient. Comes this little wagon which was being loaded from the\nbunker comes, and it\u2019s organized. The commander people organize which goes where and so on. It\u2019s not\nspecial. (Inaudible). It went so far that in July, in July or\u2014in July, in July, they had to burn, gas, bodies\noutside of the crematory. So besides this, you lived in 19 -- we are talking about 1944. We are in the\ncamp. Everything of the regime is changed. That means\u2014what has changed, no beating.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: 1942?",
        "A: 1942. I came December, 1942, to . Allright? After a few days, my friend\u2014my friend,\nwhich I told you, made arrangements, got my commander was my group . (Inaudible).\nStreet cleaners, the camp. It was a group of people who are wearing all day and\ncollecting anything that you see, not your hands. My finger is still\u2014see? This was frozen. A\nfrozen finger. (Inaudible). With your hands, not with . This is where I worked every day,\nand this Kopo (ph) was a French Jew. He hit me once. And I was in Paris the first time in 1945 or \u201846.\n(Inaudible). But I forget. (Inaudible). So I worked until February. February came, started the campaign\nfor the gypsies. The gypsies campaign started February, 1943. Yeah. Right. Yeah, 1943. And they\nneeded more people to registration, people who know a few languages, especially German and Russian\nand Polish. So French, a little French, I don\u2019t know much, but several French people do. So this group of\n20 became a group of 40 because we were sitting day and night and working. I sit at night, and people are\ncoming. We were very independent. What was good about it, first of all, I could organize myself\n. People are coming and you ask. Always somebody had something. He tells them, when you\ncome in the camp, you go to , is not a little . You go outside steps.\nThis is a shower room, a shower. Usually, the water is ice cold. You want to enjoy a shower? Go. You\ngo. You have to go. Some people\u2014a cold shower 1s a terrible thing. Already somebody is there waiting\nand hitting. If you are already an old inmate . (Inaudible). So I went\u2014when I came, I went\nin the cold water. Somebody was sending me this. You come. When you come, you undress yourself.\nFirst you undress everything. Then you go to the shower. Then you go out from the other door from the\nshower and there is two men. One stays and has shoes and gives you a pair of shoes. The other one gives\nyou Clothes, gives you underwear and a jacket or something. So when you dress, when you dress, when\nyou look at yourself after you have this new outfit and so on, you\u2019re not you anymore. You are\ndepersonalized, dehumanized. This is\u2014I still was\u2014I was still everything\u2014I was still going in my --\n(Inaudible). But here, that\u2019s what you do. They do it when you come, when you\u2019re being converted with\nfear, with fear. You come here, and it was just to do something. This is scientific A\nperson changed a lot if he\u2019s so dressed like a clown. What happens? When you\u2014five days, you get\ndiarrhea. This is such a diarrhea that you cannot control yourself. You are still in quarantine. You\ncannot control yourself. So you have to go. On the block where you live, there\u2019s some big barrels for this\npurpose. 350 people can have bowel movements over there. But there are special also.\nOld inmates, such a big block like 350, six men. These are former bandits, criminals. (Inaudible).\nCriminals. They see that somebody goes in this barrel because you will be later to clean up the barrel.\nHe comes and hits you, out. This night in Birkenau is a very bad place. It\u2019s always wet. It\u2019s sucha\nclimate. You go. By now, you\u2019re going to the latrine, and it\u2019s usually . And it\u2019s wet. Still,\nyou come over there. You are undressed already because you have filled your pants. So you\u2019re nothing.\nYou\u2019re nothing. So you take off these pants. You leave them over there. So you\u2019re running around in\nthis climate naked under this\u2014that\u2019s the beginning. I saw some guys who would take their bread, put it\non fire. It becomes coal. There is medicine too. Coal. It controls your\u2014constipates you. There\u2019s even a\nspecial medical\u2014I know in Europe, if you have diarrhea, you . So I ask him, what are you\ndoing? He told me, this man. So I said to myself, PIl . I want to be well.",
        "A: Yes, we ate the coal. Don\u2019t drink the water. Don\u2019t drink the water, because when you have the\ndiarrhea, you are getting dehydrated. When you are dehydrated, it works a different way. I came with a\nguy. I came from Krakow, from jail. A young fellow which tried to get clothes to me. I don\u2019t know\nwhy. A former policeman in Ghetto police, a young man, he was all the time with me. He was\n. He was out right away, mentally out. He was already laying next to me, laying, nothing.\nHis bread, he will get this person because he would put it in his pockets. I was hungry,\nand here is the bread. (Inaudible). Should I take the bread or not? That was my problem because I was\nraised that my , my grandma, told me, who goes in and asks for bread? The poor\npeople who doesn\u2019t want to work or . That came back. So how can I take from him the\nbread? He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on anyway. I took it. (Inaudible). Because you took him to the\nhospital and give him an injection and got rid of him because they didn\u2019t fool around with this. But some\npeople under dehydration and temperature will go on the wire. Each camp was wired. It was a big\nspecial wire, and you would hear at night when people would go on the wire committing suicide, each\nnight, every night. People couldn\u2019t take it. Some people could and some others couldn\u2019t take it. Some\npeople would go and die. I couldn\u2019t do it. Never came to my mind to commit suicide. No, I want to\nfight. I want to keep me alive. There was always, always, always . So this was the\nweeks from , the first weeks. As soon as I came to this group\u2014",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: In the beginning.",
        "A: Yeah. 3",
        "A: It was still in quarantine, the first days, yeah. It\u2019s an old number, ,",
        "A: 9047. It\u2019s an old European 7. There was a guy from Slovakia who was there. (Inaudible). Anyway,\nI won\u2019t blame him. He became so nervous because he had to\u2014this is not something which you can take\nout. You have to cut out this piece and put some other\u2014I know somebody who tried and they told him\u2014\nso this is the beginning of Birkenau. I came here, entirely different. (Inaudible). First of all, personally,\nyou take\u2014you have the uniform. So you go in the uniform all the time. You can\u2014I\u2019m talking in 1943.\nIt was very important in 1943. Then I had some\u2014a shirt. I was washing it myself, but I could wash\nevery day or every other day. Then we had ways how to get a clean shirt.",
        "A: Not everybody, no, not in 1943, not in 1943. In 1943, the regime was the same. It was often, where\nare you going and what are you doing and you don\u2019t do that and . All that what I told you\nwhat I saw, that was every night and transports. But the situation changed in 1944. Came always so\nmany people together. It was a transport of 600,000 Hungarian Jews. (Inaudible). It\u2019s day and night\ntransports people, day and night, men, women, children, day and night. One transport. (Inaudible). Two\ntransports or something. It was finishing liquidation from European Jews, remnants. (Inaudible).\nYoung, beautiful people, men and women with children. The orchestra, the symphony of\ncame in to , the symphony. (Inaudible). Play a concert, a concert. They had to play in\nthis . And so I came\u2014the first in November, 1943, half, 1943, not \u201844, \u201843.\n(Inaudible). In September was the riot of . The second part in March, 1940, they made a\nselection to from the first transport men and women and . These people were\nalready inside since November or September, 1942. (Inaudible). It\u2019s possible I was . On the\nway when they took them in trucks from the camp and had them on the way to the crematory, they knew\nwhere they were going. I had a letter from a woman which I helped. (Inaudible). After I helped her, I\nwas helping and I got a letter from her across the wire. You will take it and throw it and\nthere was already somebody picked up and read it. She blessed me what I did for her. Because they\nknew they were going away. (Inaudible). This lady which I romanced with, I met with her after the war.\nShe lost her husband over there. That\u2019s what they did. But the situation in the camp, people are good\u2014I\nstarted to have\u2014I started to have an erection again. Women started to have menstruation again. Our\nphysically, physically, only it was . We had so much food that we didn\u2019t have to eat our food\nwhich we get from the kitchen. We had to buy everything. But this is what happened.",
        "A: Yeah. There was already events from getting pregnant, a woman getting pregnant. You see? This is\nhow it is. (Inaudible). We knew who and what. Do you understand? Because I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to her, but usually she would be cremated. You see? Especially\u2014you want to kill them, kill\nthem, goddamnit. What they do is bring them in the camp, bring them together and families, and you take\nthem out and\u2014there was a transport of children. It was . This was an orphanage which\nwas evacuated from and brought to . And from about 600\nchildren were brought ,",
        "A: This was in the end of \u201843. No. This must have been in April or May of 1944, possible. I think so.\n(Inaudible). There is\u2014I didn\u2019t see it, because I didn\u2019t want to go and look at it. But people\nsay the teachers or the people who came with them, they told the\nchildren to take their shoes and hit assessments. (Inaudible). That\u2019s the story. I didn\u2019t see it. Do you\nunderstand?",
        "A: Little children. 1944.",
        "A: Come on.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It was very simple. You took each person, had to have each person, his destiny was to come in the\ncamp, and each person who came in the camp had to be tattooed. So this is you got a chance. You came\nin the camp. (Inaudible). A little bit about too. There was a form which has all kinds of\nquestions, birth and where you were born, and so on, family, where is your family, politics, what are you?\n(Inaudible). It\u2019s a big story. Then you get a number and you get such . It\u2019s a black anda\nyellow. So it\u2019s\u2014you put the black and the yellow comes. (Inaudible). Because other people,\nnon-Jewish, in red was Gentiles.

Nothing could happen, that sense. It\u2019s a block of so many people.\nThere were girls that knew already. They would tell. We would come spend and hour or two hours, and\nwe would bring something. She was in with her sister. They survived too because we got together after\nthe war.",
        "A: Yes, she was from . Haas, H-a-a-s.",
        "A: Yes, | know. (Inaudible).",
        "A: Because she was very\u2014she was such a delivery boy. She was such a little thing. We were walking\nand passed by and said to each other something. (Inaudible). You know her? No. Her husband was a\nchief of police in the ghetto where I was, not in the ghetto, in the camp, in the camp.",
        "A: From one block to the other camp. A few girls were , delivering, sending papers. I\ndon\u2019t know. She and another one was also. When we would pass by and she would always say, you men,\nwe\u2019re ashamed you are still here. Why don\u2019t you run away? This one which run away with her friend\nwhich was a Pollack, and he helped her to go out and she was arrested in Kattowitz on the street. They\nwere looking for her. She was hanged publicly. They\u2019re famous, very attractive lady and was a very\u2014\nshe run away. (Inaudible). It\u2019s like that jail. Some people that sell and you go outside. (Inaudible). I\ndon\u2019t know what they do with them in the United States. This moment when you can change\nsomething\u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, they would come by.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "A: No, but . I didn\u2019t know because she was not in Auschwitz. I think\nshe was in some because she was a German Jew.",
        "A: Idon\u2019t think so. No.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know between women what\u2014",

That\u2019s what he was, good humor, and he was very famous in the camp.\n(Inaudible). Pinkas (ph), yeah, Pinkas (ph). The Germans were making fun with him. was\nsuch a swimming pool or something, man-made. It was how we put water in there. The Germans, I\nremember they would make fun with him. They would tell him jump because he was Pinkas (ph). Pinkas\n(ph) was such a humor, a lot of humor, a lot of jokes, but he was such a character with the underground\npeople and so on. It was Pinkas (ph), yeah. He was heavy. (Inaudible). I met him some in",

        "A: No.",
        "A: , Benjamin, yeah. He was in France. (Inaudible). The fact that he came from the\nFrench, he was a prisoner of war. France is occupied. They were occupied already. So they didn\u2019t cover\nhim up, the French, because they knew he was Jewish, and they sent him to Drancy. He survived too.\nWe visited him, me and my wife, in France, and he had his office in Metz.",
        "A: Yes. We were all\u2014most with him and another guy, which I don\u2019t know what happened to him.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Notatall.",
        "A: Attempts to escape was individual, but not Jews. Any Jew\u2014because if a Jew\u2014any Jew who\nescaped and they got him was hanged. (Inaudible). There was a big fiesta. All assembled, a few\nthousand inmates, and look what\u2019s going on. There was one Jew I remember was only hanged. They got\nin Budapest or something. I had\u2014I became befriended with the Russian prisoner of war which by the\nway was a Jew. But the Russians, they didn\u2019t say, he\u2019s Jewish or something. So now we knew he was a\nRussian prisoner of war. He was a very smart, very intelligent man and so on. He was . He\nwas in the . We kept and we never, never\u2014anybody knows that he is not a Gentile. He planned\nescaping. I talked to him, and he let me know. I shouldn\u2019t have said, \u2019'm Jewish. When you escaped to\nthe road through villages and forests to get to the Russians, , it\u2019s very far. And stuff. You\nhave to eat and so on. You go. It\u2019s already one of us . If 1 go myself, I know Ill make it. He\nwent and he left, and they never brought him. Russians, a lot of people, run away. It was almost every\nweek one of them. They worked in conditions. They worked that big field, acres and acres, where\nshot-down airplanes were brought, and they would do to this landing job so they were commander, a\nthousand people, healthy and so on because they had the civilians, German civilians that were coming.\nThey would make them business, make the dollars and everything and so on. So what they do is they\nwould work on it and make like a , work and work until . After 6:00, all the\nwould come in 40 miles and 40 miles distance from the camp, from Birkenau. On the\n40 miles was the exit. (Inaudible). Every two blocks, somebody was there. During the day,\nthey would get off and they would go back so far until where the commanders were working. If they\nwould say five kilometers, ten kilometers, ten kilometers. The same. So you had to\u2014",
        "A: Where he was already there, he had already some . So he would go in. (Inaudible). So\nwhat happens is the commanders are coming back from the war and , is right\naway a signal like we have here the alarm. So when it started this, we knew somebody was missing. In\n48 hours, because of this, this was sitting 40 miles going down closest to the place where this happened.\nAfter 48 hours, it\u2019s over. So he has to be able to be inside 48 hours. He has covered himself with grass\nand dismantled planes. Only one or two people know. They got food over there. So he should be able to\nsurvive. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know. There are many . Not me. This was a way out, you\nmake it. They did it very good. They had military training too. (Inaudible). So they had an experience.",
        "A: No, I did not.",
        "A: Iwas there.",
        "A: You know what happened.",
        "A: Some girls from brought explosives, explosives, and came to for a special\npurpose. I didn\u2019t know who was organizer and what was organizer. I didn\u2019t believe there was an\norganized political communist and literature. I didn\u2019t believe it. In there were single individuals.\n(Inaudible). The went up and they were hoped that we would help them, that we would\n, especially the women. Nobody. All of a sudden, September first was from September\nfirst, until cremation. It was the order from not to cremate anymore to the crematories, didn\u2019t\ndo nothing. So they put\u2014they used the explosives and put two crematories during the day.\nMore or less, between the afternoon, it happened. So put right away came the\nfrom came with machine guns and cars and . So they pushed them. They were\nrunning, running, running. They came some 20 or 30 kilometers farther ,\nis a big river. When they came to the , there was no way to go. It was worthless. But the\nassessment came already with the machine guns, and we never knew how many were killed. That was the\nend of the uprisings. That was all the uprisings.",
        "A: Very short time.",
        "A: A few hours.",
        "A: There was no more resistance. Nobody helped them. They didn\u2019t know . Nobody. It\nwas September, 1944. It was after Stalingrad (ph). It was after Moscow. It was after Linengrad (ph).\nWe knew the Russians are going. In Auschwitz, we heard artillery fire from Krakow. Do you understand\nso far? (Inaudible). Two years, three years, and all of a sudden, you go and put everything for history. I\nwant to leave. I don\u2019t want history. Nobody was going, and it would be crazy. (Inaudible). But if\nsomebody makes such a big deal and so on, the movement, . (Inaudible).",
        "A: The change was relationship between the military, the uniform, assessment with the inmate, with the\ninmate. It wasn\u2019t any case somebody was beating him or the Kopos (ph) bathed themselves. The food\nwas different. The influence from the Jews, the Hungarian Jews and so on, brought in a lot of goodies,\nwhich the old inmate doesn\u2019t have to eat what he gets from and so on. So all together, for\nme personally, but I think a lot of because I more or less knew what was going on and so on.\nThe most important thing was what to eat, food, and cleanliness. And this we had. Not only us, all the\ncamp. Every second week, another block was going to the . In 1943, forget it. (Inaudible).\nThis was a must. You have to go to because manpower was very important. They needed\npeople to send them to labor camps.",
        "A: They treated everybody, yeah. We were . And I belonged to the class\u2014I was\nlooking for a job. I didn\u2019t have nothing to do. In September, we had nothing to do.",
        "A: No. This transport and there was an old man.\nTape 7",
        "A: Yeah. It wasn\u2019t so crowded. It wasn\u2019t actually\u2014a lot of old inmates were taken to other camps. So\nit was Hungarian. It was Dutch. It was still part of the Czechoslovakian, and it was transports, normal,\nnot special campaign, not special campaign, a community or something. So it wasn\u2019t so crowded\nanymore, no. But the living conditions I said for women, the women. Old women in the camp, wasn\u2019t\nany room. So they went\u2014this was skeletons from blocks because this is already made. You put together\n. So they didn\u2019t have the parts. (Inaudible). So this I know for sure, that most of these poor\nwomen, first of all, was half-naked. Their clothes were taken away from them when they came, dresses,\nbecause originally, nobody, no male has the right to go over there. So officially, it\u2019s not for\u2014the men\ncannot go. But there were coming men. The same as I could ask somebody to take me as an electrician,\nsomebody was going over. These people took advantage of these poor girls. It was very, very\u2014for bread\nor something. They were hungry. This is a fact. This was done by inmates because, with the inmates,\nnot everybody was a Natan Gierowitz or . There were ,",
        "A: Non-Jewish, yeah, no question about that.",
        "A: The only bordello what I called was a gypsy camp. All the gypsies\u2014a lot prostitutes are between\ngypsies, a lot. (Inaudible). There was some beautiful women. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Youcan always get in. Everything, you go out to work, you got something to do, all this. I think the\nSS took advantage of them too, outside them, yeah.",
        "A: Notas far as I know.",
        "A: I think this story doesn\u2019t end with Auschwitz. There is a continuation of other camps. There are two\nother camps which have evacuation.\ncome here and stay every day and work. So this was January, almost in February. February,\nthis city was . American or British or Soviet . We were all taken out\nand brought to a place which was called Lidice. Lidice is a big center, a railroad center. They are coming\nin trains from all parts of Poland, from Poland around from Germany and . Everything is\n. There were a few thousand of us, at least 5,000, 6,000, . We were waiting for a\ntrain to be able to pick us up and take us away. But the SS was so scared of the that they were\nstanding. The assessment took us, about 350 people.",
        "A: 350 people and said, let\u2019s go. And then we left Lidice, and we started to walk, and we walked, and\nit\u2019s mountain area, and it\u2019s February, and it\u2019s cold, and you go, and this assessment, they had luggage we\nshould carry for them up. So the head of this group, which was a sergeant or something, we called them\nthe . Do you know what is? No? The angel of death. It\u2019s Hebrew. He knows,\nright? You know Hebrew, do you? I forget that . So if he would see me one day not shaved,\nhe would take me to the end of the group and shoot me and leave me on the road. So there were four of\nus. We have to go four, like military. I was always between the four. I was shaved. We had this shaving\ncream from maybe a hundred years old, but you rubbed your face. You rubbed, you rubbed and dry, only\nto look like\u2014on the road, we met Russian prisoners of war, alone. They left already. (Inaudible). And\nwe came\u2014the first stop was that school, a village, that school. There\u2019s an empty school which is\nwith military. It\u2019s no school anymore. So it was Slovaks living, Slovaks. They brought\nus soup, . There was steps up, and so the soup was upstairs, and someone would give it to\neverybody. I don\u2019t know so much. So going up, one hit the other one by coincidence, and this other one\nlost his plate with the soup. So this guy said, who did it? He said, the sergeant, he said\u2014I talk about\nsomebody which I\u2019|l tell you a story about, a guy by the name . That was his name.\n(Inaudible). He was my age. He said, come. He said, not me, him, you know, by impulse, not me, it was\nhe, because he was a good man. He took out the other guy and killed him, and he survived all the way.\nThe story with them I told you about after September 9, the September first or the second came a group of\npeople who were found that . So here was this man, his wife and a child. The registration of\nthis group was not done. The group was brought to us. We shall register. (Inaudible). A few senior\npeople usually would go to the crematory because of age. You have women with small children who\nwould go to the crematory because of the small children. We have them here. So you can talk to them.\nYou can tell. So I started to talk to\u2014not to him, but to his wife and tell her, tell her. I said, when he\nwould come, a doctor, which is a military man, and I would suggest he will ask, is that your child? Don\u2019t\nsay it\u2019s yours. Don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s yours. It\u2019s possible they would take away the child, but you would\nsurvive. If you will keep the child, you will not survive. You will go and the child will go. So it\u2019s a\nquestion. I said according to my feelings, you have to give away the child only to survive because the\nGermans want to kill you too. So they did. And she did it this way. She let the child go, and the child\u2014\nand this couple, both of them, after the war, met and went to Israel. But he had on his conscience that\nsomebody\u2014he meant\u2014he couldn\u2019t\u2014he gave away the child. (Inaudible). He put her before a dilemma.",
        "A: Sure. Sure. So we walked so long, from the assessment with us. He had civilian clothes under his\nuniform, and this son-of-a-gun found out, and he killed him. So the mayor from the village notified the\narmy, German soldier, the sergeant . The morning came, the military police came, got us all\ntogether and said, now you are not anymore under jurisdiction. We will take care of you, the\narmy. The army took us to a place called . It\u2019s\u2014what is it? It\u2019s another camp. We worked\nover there underground. They were making parts for tanks. This is already February. The Germans are\nstill making parts of tanks. Here are sitting people underground. This was murder. The Pollacks, they\nwere beating us up, because we came as old inmates. I had such a career of three years already. They\njust gave us a hard time and so on. Also, one day, must have been an order not to make any tanks\nanymore for the army, so we were all assembled in the morning. All from the 320 remained some 80 or\n70, because the rest are somewhere on the road.",
        "A: They died. They were killed. He shot them. So no more Gestapo, only the army. (Inaudible). All\nthe Jewish step out. When he said, Jews step out, I said to myself, Iam not a Jew. I also\u2014my friend\u2014I\nhad a friend with me. He said, you will go with me. Let\u2019s go. I made a mistake. I know. So the\nnon-Jews were taken to a transport, a transport which was on its way to mountains.\nAuschwitz, the liquidation of Auschwitz inmates, that we found out later, but this transport was standing\nand waiting for more people between the non-Jews over there. The others were taken to\n3 . It was only ten kilometers from , was a Jewish and we didn\u2019t\nknow about the history that the commandant of refused, which was an assessment, refused to\nkill the people. He didn\u2019t want to do nothing. We were on our way to , but this transport\nnever came to . It was some Americans got them and freed everybody. This man and his\nfriend and 18 other people, this transport, after two days on the road, seven kilometers a day the train was\ngoing, we came to a place and I said to my friend, even if this transport was stopped some in\nCzechoslovakian territory, I'll jump. Ill not go to the end. They not take us to sanatoriums or\nsomething. They take us for liquidation. It\u2019s only ten percent. We have ten percent a chance. We have\nalready 19. We have ten percent. (Inaudible). The local population was a big railroad station, a lot of\nempty railroads on the tracks, railroad wagons and so on, and I see people jump, jumping and running,\njumping from the train. (Inaudible). There were hills, and they\u2019re running up. So I said to someone, the\nSS was busy with soups. The local community brought all kinds of soup and fed and, you know\u2014so I\njumped, and my friend jumped, and we went in one of the railroad wagons, empty and was there as long\nuntil about an hour or two hours later. The transport moved, and we stayed here. And came in some local\nminers it was mine territory\u2014and said, wait here. We will bring you clothes. Some men will come, and\nwe will pick you up, and we will bring you to some other place. After an hour, we had clothes. We had\nnormal clothes. And he was going, the men, taking. There was a group of 20, took us down a few\nkilometers and came in an underground. It was underground mines, not deep enough, not an elevator, but\nyou could go down. There already was straw, clean, was a doctor on premises. They did it like it was\n. They felt . So we were there until about three days, three days, and then we\nwent\u2014then we\u2014yeah, three days, no more. I\u2019m already in May. I\u2019m in May. So there were no Germans\nanymore. They took us to villages, put us in different families, and we were living and doing nothing.\nFood was provided. We were free to leave and to and everything. There was everything\navailable. It was everything normal until one day\u2014it was about the 7\" of May, 7\u201d of May, yeah\u2014came\nKGB and took us all, took us to a place where it was about a few thousand Russian former prisoners of\nwar, that big villa with a big backyard. People on the floor. I knew right away that we were with KGB. I\nsaw the people were shot down. These were Russians with the big suitcases. They robbed from the\nGermans and so on. I saw we were in a bad place. We stayed overnight underground. The next day\ncame out an old\u2014brought a little desk and started to make a list of people and the names and so on, and I\nsaw right away\u2014I knew Russian. I knew what it is. It\u2019s written list of arrested people or something like\nthat. So anyway, they took me another 24 hours. When it came to , | said, I\u2019m not Russian,\nI\u2019m Polish. I\u2019m from Warsaw, and I want to go home. You want to go home? Go to hell. Go. Now I\nwant to go to Prague. I didn\u2019t go home. I went to Prague. Prague is a Jewish community, and I\u2019m sure\nafter the war, they\u2019re taking care of\u2014maybe Suzy is back. That\u2019s this woman. So here is another\u2014so\nthere was not a railroad station. The train goes normal to Prague. It was not far from Prague too. May 9,\nMay 9, yes, we were still in the mines, and they came, Czechoslovakians, so happy you\u2019re here. Go. So\nI, again, with the Russian language, come to him, and it\u2019s a major, military major, tanks, big tanks. This\nwas on the way to Prague. It was an agreement between General and General\nEisenhower. You take Prague; we will take Berlin. So I come in, and I\u2019m going to this major, and I said,\n. I tell him there is a group of about 100 people. He doesn\u2019t know what I want from him. I\nsaid, what shall we do? He looks at me and said . Take a cane and go and screw your\nmother. I understand from Russian. (Inaudible). That is the meaning. That\u2019s what he told me.\n(Inaudible). I said goodbye to socialism, because I was waiting for him. We were waiting for\n. We were already disappointed in the allies after the famous offensive of the Bulge,\nand so on. We weren\u2019t helped anymore. The Soviet army would come here and liberate\nAuschwitz. So he tells me I should go screw my mother. To hell with you, with your socialism, with\nyour everything and no more. Whenever I would see a Russian, I would run away from him. And I came\nto Prague. Do you know what was in Prague? When you went to go somewhere, street car or something,\nyou show your arm. Wherever you will show your arm in Prague, hotel. (Inaudible). Not to pay,\nnothing. That was Czechoslovakian. What else?",
        "A: I think about\u2014the lady wasn\u2019t there. I asked around. I went to the Jewish community. They told\nme to go to a displaced persons camp. And there is an underground and the taking care and\nso on. I went to Munich. When I came in Munich, there was already an organized Jewish council of\nJews from Poland. I came up, and there was . People from Birkenau. One comes to me and\nsaid he was in Birkenau too. He was from . He said, I\u2019m the chairman of the ,\nCome to my camp. I was sick from the from the underground. I got infected, my eyes.\nI had no time to go to doctors. He said, come to my camp, we\u2019ll take care of you. And I went with him.\nHe was driving a car already. I went with him, and he placed me that place where people were too from\nBirkenau. And I was three weeks.",
        "A: (Inaudible).\n(End of Tape 7).\nTape 8",
        "A: SolIcame to Feldafing. Feldafing is a place where it was a military before the war.\nIt\u2019s not far from Munich, very close to Munich. About three weeks I was down. Then I became\u2014I\nstarted to open my mouth. It was under the supervision of this now famous General Patton. He said it\nwas about 25 kilometers from . (Inaudible). I was warning him from . I didn\u2019t\nspeak English. The guy who was my translator was which told me that he died.\nHe was\u2014he came\u2014he was living in Los Angeles. He didn\u2019t want nothing to do with me because I was\nagainst\u2014I felt and I shared the opinion that his wife wasn\u2019t on . So I started to talk, and I\nstarted to say\u2014there were already all kinds of organized groups, communists, survivors, like nothing had\nhappened, like nothing happened. (Inaudible). All the goodies which we had before the war and the\nghetto which is called Poland. It\u2019s a ghetto. But we played all these games. (Inaudible). They knew me\nfrom Poland because my name ,",
        "A: Yes. It\u2019s just communists, and I don\u2019t know. Russia wasn\u2019t nice to them. My wife, I cannot\nmention nothing USSR, hate, hatred. Even they gave her an education. She finished, went to school and\neverything, but . The situation is such there are 6,000 people in this camp, young people, no\nold people. Old people didn\u2019t make it, the tragedy. Young people. Already pregnant women, children.\nAnd it\u2019s a lot of problems. So I\u2019m fighting, and I said to not to rely on the army, very nice and so on.\nAnd Mr. So-and-so is the president, doesn\u2019t do his job. He wants to complete them. (Inaudible). We\nhave to demand this and this. We have children. I developed a program, what we need. (Inaudible). The\nfeeling is you owe us for something. You have to give me something. It\u2019s not right. Nobody has to give\nyou nothing. I went because I miss something, some I miss. (Inaudible). And I survived,\nnot because I am a big , not because I\u2019m a big hero. I didn\u2019t fight. I only tried my belly\nshould be full and my health should be all right. Oh, yes, it bothered me when I saw children was going\nto the\u2014but at the same time -- (Inaudible). When you went to make a summary, it\u2019s\u2014you cannot\nand say you have to give me like some people are involved in the American situation of the\nholocaust. I don\u2019t want to mention names because they know me and they don\u2019t like me. But we\nspend\u2014I make them possible to come. I help them to come to America because\u2014this is another thing. I\nwas sending out people to the United States. I was involved in for members of the\n, of the Zionists, from Bundists (ph). I was involved in such. That\u2019s why I was sitting two\nyears . So that\u2019s what I started to do. And we decided to have elections. We had elections,\nand we elected a board. There was meetings, everything. Little by little, we are\u2014understand and it was\n. It\u2019s\u2014I couldn\u2019t\u2014I got involved with immigration because Jewish Labor Committee was\non my back and international committee. Anyway, but I never, never, never used\u2014\nsomebody said, you have to do it. In America, they didn\u2019t go through what we\u2019re doing through. They\u2019re\nnot. (Inaudible). If I didn\u2019t want to go to , there are other choices. If I would have\n, | wouldn\u2019t be here. I would go over there. If you are a Zionist here, that is the place. I was\nraised that different . SO to the United States. (Inaudible). So I can talk to\nyou. (Inaudible). This is something which happened. The meaning is that somebody wanted us to\nliquidate, and they couldn\u2019t do it, and nobody could do it. They couldn\u2019t do it. We were too intelligent\nand too everything. We had something to\u2014in the family of nations, we have, in my opinion, a very\nimportant place. We\u2019re contributing a lot to them. So then came the joint. There was a lady I remember,\nthe social worker. She was a native American. When you speak English, you translate from English to\n. You say . (Inaudible). You do not say \u201cyou.\u201d I just met you. I say\n, 1n the third person. He said to me . He tried to speak to me in\n. I didn\u2019t know English. I still don\u2019t know, but then I knew less. So she said to me\u2014I\ntook it because I\u2019m a . (Inaudible). was on the black market and had\nto make a living. So I said\u2014she misunderstood. (Inaudible). I said, because I\u2019m a European. She\u2019s an\nAmerican. She cannot talk to me like I\u2019m nothing and so on. So then came to me\u2014one day came to me a\nman in uniform. He said to me, I\u2019m so-and-so; I\u2019m the translator to Judge Jackson. Jackson was a head\njudge in trial. Iam friends with him. from French and from Russian.\nWhat was his name?

He said, here I have a list, a list of names.\nJewish Labor Committee sent to me. I should go and find. I cannot do it. (Inaudible). He said, between\nyou and me, I\u2019m under surveillance. I\u2019m that job where they say, what is this man doing? I have no right\nto do this, to get in touch with people in the camps. Please, will you take it? And I took it. So I got\ninvolved. So I got involved in helping people to immigrate. And in the meantime would come all kinds\nof commissioners to take people who want to go . There are all kinds of professions who\nwere ready to go and work some . So International Ladies Garment Union was my\ncustomer, in Canada had customers and so on. And I got involved, and I would serve this committee\nwhen who would come and select people. It was a continuation of my work. (Inaudible). I was married.\nI\u2019m sorry to say my wife, a year after we came to the United States, passed away. She had to be\u2014they\ndecided to remove one of her lungs. (Inaudible). So this was my beginning to the United States.",

The owner of the villa\nwas a German, and I was an American. I don\u2019t know if somebody knows cars. (Inaudible). So I had\n(Inaudible). I was a big shot. But I helped a lot of people to immigrate.",
        "A: Yeah. And I came to the United States in 1945, which one agency wanted I should be with the first\n. I flew. I had to fly in because I was afraid she will not pass . SO\narrangements were made by somebody in the consulate, an American. And so we took a plane, and we\nknew. Besides this, in 1947, in February, I was invited to convention of the Jewish Labor\nCommittee in Atlantic City. It was a general situation too. I made a good speech. (Inaudible).",
        "A: Wehad special people. We would get names from New York. This was\u2014it was people who were\nactive in the movement, the union movement especially. (Inaudible).

He said to me\u2014took me for lunch and said, what can I do for you? I was already\u2014so I\nsaid, I heard that a cutter in garments is a good profession. He said, you want to be a cutter?
