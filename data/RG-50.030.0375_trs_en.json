        "A: The Russians. The time of the Russians. For the time of the Lithuanian, I'll tell you an incident\nfor example. The border between White Russia and Lithuania was only three kilometers from our\ntown. My brother, the youngest brother, loved animals. So, he asked to one Pole if he can bring\nhim a nice horse. And since our tannery was right on the border, it was easy to sneak it in. And he\nbrought him a horse. And he went to pick up the horse and bring it to the barn near the house. I\nalmost, I forgot it, I just, recently when I was in Brazil where my brothers lived, my brother did\nremind me, do you remember how you saved my life? And I said what did I do? He said, don't you\nremember when I was bringing the horse home and a Lithuanian policeman came up to him and\nsaid he wants, where did you get the horse? Did you bring it from over the border? And he said,\nno, I bought it from the tannery and I'm bringing it to the house. Which was true, he picked it up\nfrom the tannery. But, he said, no, it's a too beautiful horse. You got it from over, and he wanted to\ntake it away. And I didn't know what's going on, I was standing in the house in the window and all\nof a sudden I see he's standing, my brother stays with the horse and he's arguing with the policeman.\nAnd the policeman was grabbing his gun to him. So, I ran out and I jumped on the policeman and I\ngrabbed, I almost grabbed the gun out of him and pushed him away from my brother. And then I\nstarted, give him the horse, let him take the horse, we get into the house. There were certain things,\nsome are forgotten and some things come, some remind you of whatever was during the war,\ncertain incidents. But we were a normal life, we used to go for an evening school, in evening\nschools we were going, studying the languages. Until, of course, the Germans came in.",

Hidden, there was hidden business, it was not, because my brother used to go\nto Vilna and bring certain merchandise that we used to sell, but maybe, maybe it would normalize\nand we would maybe get into business again. But the business was kind of not normal.",

        "Q: Was that troublesome?",

They were running away from the\noccupation of where the Germans occupied already. And they used to tell stories that, what we felt\nwas nothing.

And all of a sudden we see a lot of movement, that a lot of\ntrucks are running through our town and we did not know what is going on. And we, of course, any\ntruck that stopped, we went to ask them what is going on. And they say, you don't know? The\nGermans declared war. And they are, they were running back to Russia, because Lithuania was full\nof Russian people. They were under their command. And so we knew that, we actually found out\nthat there is going to be a war again. There was news that the Russians, that the Lithuanians are\nkilling the Russians. They are throwing them into the ocean. Because they actually want friends,\nthey didn't like them. It was just superficial that they lived in harmony. They were, they wanted to\nget rid of them. And they, and the war, early in the morning we heard the Germans marching in.\nBecause, and I remember I had a cousin that was in the Polish Army and we didn't sleep that night.\nWe were standing and talking, what will it be, what will he do? What is going on? We did not\nknow what to expect. And we heard, I heard, like somebody would play with rocks, the noise like\nyou throw rocks, so I says, but what is this noise? Do you hear? What is it? They said, they are\nthrowing parachutes. And he said, you'll see. Because he knew, he was in the army, he understood\nbetter than we did. They are parachuting some people here. And in no time they will march in.\nAnd it didn't take too long, and in the morning, the Germans started to march in. So, we left the\nhouse and we went to some of our workers. We stayed there all day. And then we decided we have\nto go to our house. To see what, what will it be with us? Of course, in those times there was no, no\ncamps, no death camps, nothing. They just, well, people lived under the German occupations. It\nwas scary. There was a lot of things going on. But, we did not expect what we had later on. And,\nbut we came home and we lived for awhile. On the second day, for example, I was standing in the\nwindow and a couple of Germans walked up to us and one German looks up and I had a watch in\nmy hand. And he said, give me the watch. I'm in my house, why should I give him the watch? I\ncouldn't understand it. So, I said, no. And my brother heard it and came, he said, take off the watch\nand give it to him in a hurry. Don't you know what this is? He takes a Jew in a minute. You'll be\ndead. Give him the watch. So, of course, I took off the watch and I give it to him.

Because our house\nwas in the middle of the town and it was very big. It was a two story and as they were coming in\nmore and more, they occupied for the main stop, for the main office, so the Germans, the very\nimportant Germans used to stay in our house. And right away they put up a note, that nobody is\nallowed to come in there. So, we actually did not suffer too much. In a way, they used to take out\nsome people. For example, if a man with a beard, they used to follow him if he went to the temple,\nand then cut his beard off or beat him up or something. We did not feel it in our house because\nnobody was allowed, the access wasn't allowed to come into our house.",
        "Q: So, it was the German army that was sharing part of your house?",
        "A: Yes. The army, the main, from the main lines of their, until the year, they stayed until they\nalmost marched into Leningrad. Our house was occupied. And, as a matter of fact, there were\ncertain things I had to make for them, like cut up vegetables and this. But, we felt kind of, we didn't\nfeel what some other people, get the problems.",
        "Q: Now, when you went out of the house, was there a big German presence on the streets?",
        "A: Not big, not big. But there were always Germans, yes. And, at that time, was formed the\n. And people had to go to work. There was not specially, but they had, they had to\ngive somebody something to do.",
        "Q: You?",
        "A: I didn't, I did not have to go, but I volunteered to go. I did. I didn't want to be any different.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: Cleaned the street, pull out grass. Go, there was , but they had to employ people.\nJust to sit in the sun and burn yourself.",
        "Q: Was there any brutality?",
        "A: There was in town. There was. We did not, we did not get to it, but there was brutality.",

        "A: As far as I remember, they were not closed. But, I know there was incidents where they took out\nand I think this is because there was, if anybody from the Poles that had, was mad at you, they used\nto get together to transfer to the Germans, and they used to come to this and this house, where was\nmad somebody, and take them out, for example, to the cemetery and shoot over his head. Just, just\nto, they did not kill anybody, but to torture them. To put a fear in them. This I know. I heard tt.\nWe used to hear a lot about it. Is they cut the beard off this, they did this, just torturing certain\npeople. But, there was no, were no casualties in those times, until the day came.",
        "Q: Were there special rules that were put in place?",
        "A: Oh, yes. We had to put on the yellow on our arms. We could not walk on the\nsidewalk. And as this progressed further, the Poles were not allowed to come to sell us anything.\nWe couldn't, we were not allowed, they weren't allowed to bring to sell something to Jews. We,\nespecially, did not feel 1t as much because we had so many friends around the Poles, that even if\nthey had to risk their life, they used to bring us anyway. The war would go on and out of 20 years,\nwe would have plenty of food in our house.",
        "Q: So your Polish friends didn't turn on you?",
        "A: No. No. Until the last, even the last days, but our neighbor, when my mother wanted to hide one\nnight at our neighbors, and we were such devoted, close friends, she did not let even my mother to\nsleep overnight. She said she can't let her in. She said she can't let her in. But our workers were\nvery devoted until the last day. That's very unusual, very unusual.",
        "Q: So, when you say the last day, what does that mean? What happened?",
        "A: That was the day there was . In the morning for, before our High\nHolidays. This was in 1941. I and one of our neighbors, we said, we have to clean, they were very\nmuch concentrated on clean in town. And we had a big yard in front, so we got\nup in the morning and I said to this young girl, you'll help me and we'll clean the good in front very\nthoroughly, so tomorrow, we won't have to work.

She said, didn't you see all the notices that are put on the walls who has money,\nwho has gold, who has silver, who has materials, who has leather, whatever it is, they should bring\nit in to the police. And this is a sign they are going to do something to us. They'll make it like\nnobody told about killing. They make a ghetto. And it started a big commotion in town, everybody\nwas running to the police bringing in some whatever they want. Whatever they could hide, they\nwere. They were already hidden. We already gave it away to some among our Polish friends to\nhide a lot of things. But, whatever we had, we were going and bringing it in to the police. And, this\nwas going on all morning, and then a lot of people started to leave town. And then we heard that\ntwo sisters got killed. They were trying to leave the town. And they caught them and they killed,\nand this stopped a lot of people. But, we still did not, my mother still ordered my two brothers and\nwe had two refugees, young men, that they ran away from the occupation of the Germans where\nthey occupied before us. And they got dressed a lot of clothes, and she told them where to go, to\none of a shoemaker that he used to be a friend of ours. And it was only about a kilometer and a half\nfrom town. They should go there and stay there until we see what will come out. We still didn't\nknow what is going to happen to us. And as they, and were sure that they left already. They got\ndressed and left. And my sister, we brought my sister from, my sister was married in White Russia.\nWe brought her from there with the two children because her husband was taken away right the first\nweek when the Germans came in. They occupied their town and they took away, the took the\ndoctors and the lawyers and the teachers. He was a teacher. And they took him right away, they\nkilled him, but we did not know that. All the time the told, the explanation was they took him for\nwork someplace. And every day we used to send somebody to, they used to say they're working\nnear Warsaw, so we send somebody near Warsaw. They weren't there. They said, oh, they left\nyesterday. They transferred them to another place, they transferred them there. We couldn't find\nhim anywhere, until we, it took a long time until we realized that they killed him. And so my sister,\nthere was no exchange, they didn't have what to exchange, so she, we brought her to our house and\nThe folowing transcript is the result of recorded iterwiew.

And I was\nrunning from one house to another house where there were fathers to see what are they doing.\nMaybe they know better than we what we know. And they kept saying, one said, where can I run?\nI have to go to more ask for a piece of bread. So, how can I run? And others says, how can we run?\nLook at my old mother, she can't work, she's in bed most of the time. I went into another girlfriend,\nI said, Myrtle, what are you doing? How can I run? My daughter is pregnant. The brought her\nfrom Lider(ph), from the bigger towns, they pulled out people and brought to the small towns\nbecause they're still, and those were, I'm talking all about the wealthier people. Where can I run?\nLook at her, she is to have a baby any day. Where can I run? I'm not running. I'll stay. And I was\nrunning around like this all day, not knowing what, what will it come out. And then I came, I got\ntired, and I came, it was getting a little dark. I came into the house and my mother was going to\nlight the candles. And I look out through the window and I see civilian people who\non their shoulders. So, I got very frightened. I thought, gee, that's not, that's not\nnormal. They are not Germans, they are civilians. So, I kept yelling, I yelled out to my mother, you\n, let's run. But we weren't ready, where to run also. So, we ran, we thought we will\ngo to one of our workers, to get united with my sister and the children. But, by coincidence, in the\nmorning, we had a lot of money in the house. And we decided to go hide it where the tannery is.\nBecause the tannery 1s in the back of the town. If we need money, we can sooner dig it out. Like in\ntown, everybody is watching over you. As I and my brother were going to take the, with a whole\nbasket of money that we carried, we put a stick in and he carried from one side, I from the other\nside. One of the Pole, a Pole that was coming from church, this was on Sunday, and he gets, comes\ncloser to us and says, , | feel so bad, I hear that it's a bad time coming on us, on\nyou. And if you want, come, run to me. To my farm. But we never knew where a farm is out of\ntown, we never went out of town. We never went anywhere, we didn't know where to go. So, that\nwas in the afternoon, and then at night, we decided, and I said to my mother, let's run. I knew where\nwe have to run to.

My mother looked around and she found my brothers, sitting in the barn. And she says,\nwhat are you doing here? They say they couldn't leave town because there was, there were rumors\nthat they are shooting. So, we returned back home. So she said to them, what is my life? My life\ndoesn't mean anything. If you don't save yourself, what does it mean to me? So, she said, go to the\ngarden, we had a big garden in the, right after the houses. And she said to them, go in the garden.\nLay down under the leaves from the cucumbers because they are very big now. And, see, at night if\nyou can get out. And she did, in the meantime, she didn't, I left. And when I was running, one of\nthe Poles there, said to me, Mirchka(ph), where are you running? You'll get shot, don't run. I'll tell\nyou, I'll get into, where do you want to go? I was not smart enough, and I told them where I'm\nrunning. I wasn't supposed to say where I'm running. But, I told them, I'm going to the Vladik's(ph)\nhouse. And he said, well, I'll get into the house, I'll open up the window in my house, and you jump\nthrough the window and then cross the street and get in. So, he did, he went into the house and\nopened up the window and I went through the window, I jumped over and I crossed the street and I\nwas reunited with my sister. And there were three, four, four families more, Jewish families that\nnight. And, of course, I was with three children, my sister and we had the boy, the cousin from\nVilna, and there was a big commotion. This one to eat and this one to drink and all night we were\nvery busy. And then in the morning, his wife came out and says that you will all have to leave\nbecause I don't want to get killed because of you.",

        "A: So, I said to her, don't worry, we won't stay here. I will try, I'll take one child and I'll try to move\nto the factory. To the tannery, because it's very close there. It was close to the tannery, he was\nworking for us, all my live I knew him. And his brothers were working for us, too. And, if they'll\ncatch me there, all they can do is kill me. But I am in my own place so we will not cause trouble to\nyou. And I got into there, to the house, and I was still thinking about the Pole who gave us the idea\nto run to his house. And I also knew from another Pole that came about five days before to our\nhouse, and he looked up and we were boarding the sister and the children, and he warned us, he said\nto my mother, why did you bring your daughter and children here? The Lithuanians wants a clean\nLithuania with no Jews. And in White Russia, the Jews, I don't know how long, but the Jews who\nstill live in Lithuania, they are going to kill all the Jews. And we knew that he is from the more\nintelligent Poles, not just the farmer, it was a very rich farmer. But he had children, they were very\nhigh rank in the Polish army, all officers. We knew that he knows something, but the way he\nexpressed it, so, we did not want to accept it. So, after he left us, my mother said,\n, he came to our house and eats our supper, . We couldn't\nbelieve it, we didn't want to believe it. Who is going to chase us out of the house? It's ours. It went\nfrom generation to generation. And he was, he gave us also the idea, the only ones that will survive\nis people that they will hide. And my oldest brother, later on, went and he stayed with him for\nawhile. But, it was very hard to hide because they all had people working for them, and they knew\nthey will talk to those, they are keeping Jews. But, as I was in the tannery all the day, then I told my\nsister, if I pass through right, she should come. But we did not know where my mother is. My\nmother wasn't with us. We knew that my brothers, I didn't know that they are in town. We were\nsure that they are protected. Because the first thing for the protection was the men. What we\nlooked. And as I, and I said to the janitor, where is Marisha(ph)? Marisha was married to him, she\nwas a maid for us. And I wanted to go to town and find out where my mother is.

So I thought, well, we started to feel more and more that we are not wanted\nanyplace. We have no place, we have no way, we don't know what to do. So, I said, no, I will not\nbe here too long. And there was a slaughterhouse nght near our tannery. I saw a young man\ncoming out, so there was a hope chest standing in this little house. And there was even some of our\nthings. I took out a piece of material for a suit and I called him, I don't remember his name. And I\nsaid, if you tell me where Kokochan(ph) is, a village, where the Pole told us that if we want, we\nshould run to him, I will give you this piece of material. He said, I don't want to be killed. Because\nif I'll go with you, I'll get killed. I said, no you won't. You go from one side and I go from another\nside, far away from each other. And, if they catch me, obviously, they will kill me, but I will never\nsay that you are going with me. I will never, I promise you, I will not give you out. And he did,\nand he showed me where Kokochan is. I couldn't get into his, into this man's house right away\nbecause there were, I saw, there is people are driving around with motorcycles.

But I asked him to go and bring my sister with\nthe other two children, and she'll give you more things. She'll pay good off. And he did, and he\nbrought my sister and the children there. But, there was, at the time of the Russians, this Pole\nhimself, was hiding, because he was a rich farmer. So, he was afraid that they will send him out to\nSiberia, too. So, he had workers, and the workers did not want us. They want us out and out and\nout. So, we told them that we will not stay. We only want to know where my mother is. So, and\nthe owner, the farmer, was not in. He went to to see what's going on with the\nJews. What kind of commotion is going on. So, I said, the minute you will find out where my\nmother is, we are going to be gone from your house. We will not stay here. Not knowing where\nwill we go, what will we do, where is anybody? I, anyway, they kept, we want you out, we want\nyou out. So, when he came, he gave us a horse and buggy, next day. And we were going to move\nto a village that we knew where the Tartars are.

If not, we\nwill have to go to Raddan. And we came there, I did remain to see what, you'll go to town and\nyou'll find out where my mother is. He did go and he came with the news that my mother went with\nall the Jews to the temple. They are all locked up. And he said, so my place was, I felt I have to go\nto see what is with my sister and the children. We went there, but he was, he brought us every day\ninformation. Where my mother is, where my, he found out that my brothers did not leave the town.\nThey are hiding in a shoemaker's house in town.

Tonight or tomorrow night. I was, went, I was with\nmy sister there, we had what to eat. Obviously, they gave us what to eat. And, but, we don't, we did\nnot know what we should do. We were absolutely, we didn't know where should we turn, where\nshould we go. And, then he told us, we didn't know what was going on, but we heard that on\nWednesday, they took out all the Jews from the temples there and they brought them out a big\nmarket which used to be the, the farmers used to bring in their cattle and their food to sell, there was\none, like a farmer's market they called it. Once a week they used to come there with everything to\nsell to town. And my mother is there, too. We told the people. We did not know what the fate will,\nwhat will be with us, we didn't know what will be with her. My brothers did not come out yet. But,\nnext night they did come in, they came in. They came in, but of course, we knew we cannot be\nthere. So, we moved to another place, another, it was a mother to this worker of ours. She took us\nin for awhile.

We'll send them there and there was no ghettos yet. And we'll\nsee if they will meantime be there until we will know what, until we reunite together.

        "Q: Let me ask you a question here. Did you find out what happened to the people who were in the\nmarketplace at that time?",
        "A: Yes, yes. My mother came, she knew everything. They brought them out, they get out Sunday\nnight. They brought, near us was a small town where a mental institution for mental people, they\nput them out in a row, but entering the temple, like in the hall. And every, and then they announced\nthat everybody should come to the temple. They can bring in what they carry on their shoulders.\nThey gave them sticks and they told everybody to hit over their heads. So, they were beating up\neverybody. The name of this town was Shiloch(ph), a small little town. And then, of course, the\nbrought from another, from Walkinik(ph) was a small town. They brought Jews from Walkinik,\nalso, to the temple. And it was very crowded and there were people sick, people having children.\nNo facilities to go out. But I heard that one of my girlfriends and the Commandant, the Lithuanian\nCommandant came to the temple, she went out, because we knew him, and she said to him, give us\na way of, live with dignity. Not, there was no bathrooms, there was nothing. She says, or kill us.\nPick what you want. Or kill us or give us a way to live like humans. And he said, we'll see, we'll\nsee. That was Sunday night, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. They brought all of the Jews, all of\nthem out from the temple in the market. The market was closed gates. And they told everybody to\nsit down, nobody can stand up. Now, one man, he was asthmatic and he could not breath. So he\nstood up. And they shot him. So this was the first casualty in this parking place. And then, in no\ntime, mother was there. Now, we weren't there, but every day that Polish man used to bring us all\nthe news. They started to gather, they went through and they picked all the young men and the\nstrong men, young and strong. And they told them they're taking, their wives, they're taking them\nfor work. There was a big farm near Ashashoc(ph), where the owner wasn't there already because\nthey sent him to Siberia. But of course, the ground, the people tried to keep it up.

And they took them and they shot them there. They brought us information, for\nexample, that one of my cousins, got out from the grave and he said, if you want, I'll give you the\nhair off my head, but shoot us right. Because about, they were all, they made them undress and they\nwere shooting them and they were falling into the graves. But some weren't shot. They covered\nthem when they were still alive. So, he said, shoot us right. But we still didn't believe it. And one\nof our worker's wives came to my mother, to bring her food, and tell her, we want to save you.\nOnce you are out of here, come, we will save you. They used to bring food and give it to the people\nthat were watching around there. And they wanted to save her. And my mother says, she is not\ngoing out. She is afraid.

        "Q: This was your whole town?",
        "A: Yes. This was, because when my mother, when there was, on the premises where they were,\nwhen they told my mother why they want to save her, and they told her where they are killing the\nJews, she came up to, there were two doctors, Jewish doctors. And she says to them, what should\nwe do because some young people wanted to revolt against it, they said, let's kill at least some\nGermans. We're getting killed, let's kill, they didn't let them because they said, because if you\nrevolt, we'll all get killed. Obviously, they would have, they killed them anyway. But, he said to\nthem, so my mother, this 1s boykavochnik(ph), you are such a smart woman, you are a business\nwoman. Can you believe that they will kill 4,000 people? No, it's impossible! They won't do it,\nthey cannot do it! And they made her, she is stupid to believe them. And this is, still when it\nhappened, nobody believed it, that that's going to happen. We thought, they'll make a ghetto. We\nthought they will take away from us everything. But we could not believe they are going to kill us.\nWe couldn't believe it. And that's how we were fooled all the time. Because we did not believe it.\nAnd later on, in experience, every town was a different way of killing. It was always before a\nJewish holiday. There was always a diff, there was always with a different excuse. There was not\nexcuses, but they were differently that nobody could believe it. Now, my sister was with my\nmother's family and, until one day came a selection. They took out there. And they put them, they\ntold them to get out in the market.

        "A: We were one of the very, very lucky people. Because we knew, we, how we did not trust, it's\nvery hard to say. We had trust, too much, later we found out we should not trust that much. But in\nbeginning, we trusted because you couldn't understand, how can somebody hurt us? We were\nfriends! We lived together. We were loved! Among the Poles. We were loved! The workers\nwould cut their necks off for us. They would give everything for us. They would do everything.\nAnd how can anybody hurt us? How can you believe it?",

        "A: We had friends that, before the war my mother used to help them a lot, they were poor. And I,\none night, we were in the villages, yet, 1t was before the holidays. I said, I'm going to get a prayer\nbook. And I risked to go to the town from the village with, of course, with the woman's daughter.\nBut she had to go on one side, we always arranged it, that if they catch us, they should not, people\nshould not suffer from us. And I came to these people and they say me, they couldn't believe it.\nThey were, where is everybody? Who is alive? Because they knew that we, that they already killed\nour town. And I say, we are all the family, except my sister's husband. And, what can I do for you?\nWe had nothing, I just ran out from the house like I stayed, with nothing, I didn't even have time to\nput on a pair of shoes. I took the shoes with me and ran out in a pair of slippers. So I said, no,\nnothing, I really don't, I want a toothbrush. Forget about toothpaste, a toothbrush and a little salt to\nbe able to brush our teeth. So, she says, no, but you don't need any underwear or nothing? I said,\nno, a little towel and a dishtowel. So she brought me and I, and she gave me a prayer book and I\nwent back. But, that's all we wanted. I felt, I always had my prayer book with me. Even when we\nwere warm, the minute I heard the German's boots walking by the house, I took, I used to grab the\nprayer book and pray. And we were, we were still believe that there would come a miracle.\nAnother day, another day, there will a miracle for us. We, something God has to do for us. It was,\nbut the day never came. It never came. The only one that was right is the Polish man that took us\nout that night because this was Saturday, Friday night and on Sunday, they surround Raddan and\nthey went from house to house and we did not have White Russian passports, the took him and they\nkilled him.

So, he gave her a prayer book and he told her, you bring 1t home\nto them and tell them, they, occasionally they feel weak, they should eat meat. No bones, not any of\nthe bones, just eat a piece of meat for survival. But the future, we did not, I don't think we were\nthinking hard. I don't think we had the ability of thinking what will happen to us. What should we\ndo? Where should it go? What, we didn't, but we felt like whatever they advised us, this, the first\nfarmer, the one that had the sons that they were hiring in Polish army and everything, we felt that\nthey are right. The only way we can survive is by hiding. And I was very much fed up and I was\nagainst it. I kept telling to my brother, why do we have to be different? Everybody, all my\ngirlfriends are killed. Everybody is killed. Why do we, why do we have to be stubborn and want to\nleave? What purpose? What? What, they are all killed, nobody is here around us. And he said, I\nwant to live to tell the world what had happened to us. And I used to scream, why do we have to\ntell the world? The world doesn't think about us, they don't help us.

Of course, this Pole had a big vision and he told us how we can hide.\nHe made hiding places for us in the houses, but the Poles had a smell, somehow they used to feel,\nthat this and this family is hiding somebody. They had a very funny feeling. If they saw an extra\nfrom the chimney, extra smoke is coming out, she is baking bread more than normally she would\nbake for herself. This is how they used to find out. And if one knew, right away they started the\nother one, they're starting to talk.

That we will hide separately then if\none part get killed, the other one will survive. And then he brought us into a place and we had a\nvery good hiding place there. We could not hide in his house because himself was hiding already.\nHe was sentenced to death from the Poles, he was sentenced to death from Lithuania, from the\nGermans, everybody wanted to kill him.

        "Q: So, you weren't just in some hiding place? You had a little bit of movement?",
        "A: Not only, not outside, never outside. Only, I was in the kitchen in certain places. In some\nplaces, I didn't, we were there day and night. It depends which place. We were once in a place that\neverybody died from typhus. And we were still there in that house and we didn't catch it. Only one\nchild survived.

Her brother came to tell that we should leave because they\nare talking about that she has Jews.

And a piece of old linen and white flour and she said, let\nher put on the leaves and this will take off the redness and the swelling a little and then it will start\nitching, I should put on. He wasn't satisfied that this can help me. He went to the doctor in\nAshashoc and he told him that he knows that we are hiding. And the doctor was a German, his\nname was Leah(ph), but he was, we knew him, we knew him. It's different with people that they\nknow everybody. And he said to me, he said, I will give you an ointment and you take it out to her.\nAnd he brought it to me and my foot healed up.

        "A: The most difficult thing was for me once, he brought me to a place on the way to Vasilishoc, it\nwas a farm, there was a widow there with children and he said he wants, he was doing a transaction\nthat he wanted to separate the family in three places. To find three places to have us.

I\ndidn't know. I got out at night and I'm going with them to feed the cows with a younger daughter\nbecause, obviously, she's, the younger daughter 1s younger than I am, the daughter, but she knows\nwhat to do. And I am afraid to go near the horse and I am afraid to go near the cow. The cow we\nhad I would maybe cope with it, but I don't know how to milk a cow like they milk. And I insist I\nhave to learn, I have to do it. So, it didn't take long, next day I was feeding the cow, I wasn't afraid\nfor the horse, I went to them in the morning to the woods to cut trees down for, because there was\nno men in the house, it was all women. And young children. To cut the trees, but I'll tell you, every\ntree that I cut that ground was soaked with my tears. This I remember. There was so much tears in\nthat forest that I tell, this is how we are, be cutting us down. Like I should not cut the trees because\nwhy do I do it to the trees when we've been cut down like this? This I can, I don't, I never I think\nrepeated it, but I couldn't take to cut down a tree. I couldn't. And I was going and I was cutting\ndown the tree and I was crying bitterly and came home and make dinner for them. I was there, and\nthen on Sunday, I had to hide myself because they were already, the girl was probably 14, 15, and\nboys are coming. And I was afraid to be there. Maybe they will recognize that I'm Jewish. So I\nused to tell them that I am very sick and I'm very tired and I used to get into the barn and dig in\nmyself all the way on the bottom and hide. Until one day a doctor was passing from, walking from\nVilna to Gordna and this was on the road from Vilna to Grodna, that village. And I made a soup\nwith milk and he was very hungry and he stopped and, of course, they used to give people to eat\nbecause he was, constantly people were passing by.

And, obviously, on the farms they did\nnot make it. That was a Jewish meal. And I never did it again. I said, no. Until I did not, I was not\nsecure there.

        "A: Yes. Yes. We never knew what the hour can bring us. We never knew about it. Now, for\nexample, when I left that place, I had, at that time I had a sack with some clothes already. He\npicked up, this man picked up, I told him where they were hidden, but they were dressy clothes, I\ncouldn't wear it anyway, there was wool dressed and I couldn't wear it. I wasn't allowed to wear it.\nShe told, and I was, when he came to pick me up, she said, the clothes disappeared, somebody had\nstolen the clothes. Of course, I did not bring up to a thing that's a tragedy, I said, okay, it's alright.\nTo them it meant something, to me it doesn't even mean anything. I left everything, as long as I got\nout alive from there. Because I was sure I will not get out alive from there. After that man\nrecognized that the food is not the same and they are coming in constantly, boys to the girl and I\ndisappear in that time, by the end they will come out, who is she? Who is she? It's a mystery, I'm\nthere and I'm not there. But thinking, I don't know, we didn't, if we would have the\nbrains to think a lot, I think we should have commit suicide. And you know, nobody committed\nsuicide, very little. Unless they knew the Germans are going to kill them, they were waiting for to\nbe definitely killed. Otherwise, there was very little suicide.

I just, Yaffa just got some documents so she\nwill find out. Because when I asked, when I came to the United States, I asked my mother, when is\nthe date that my birthday is? She said, when we were all picking berries. So I took it in June.\nBecause this is the time that we pick berries. Because we, I had, some of my girlfriends had\nbirthday parties, not too many, occasionally. And I used to come home and ask my mother, why\ncan't we have a birthday party?

Now, he didn't get a thing, because he couldn't\nread a newspaper anyway. He wouldn't, he didn't bring it to us. So, but we heard at night, every\nnight we used to hear airplanes running. Because, as a matter of fact, Yaffa's mother got, was\npregnant and she had a baby. And they brought her, they were hiding in the house. So they brought\nher to our hiding place to have the baby.

And they were so foolish, they, some\nof the pilots, but we heard every night, Russian planes passing by. That one of the pilots was a\nwoman and she had a baby and they dropped the baby. They did not think it is a Jewish baby. And\nthey raised the baby and the baby was okay until it got killed.",
        "Q: When you heard these Russian planes, did it give you hope?",
        "A: Hope. We have, we had hope, but we were afraid for the day when they will come. We did not\nknow, how can we get out and show our faces? How can we face the world, how can we look at\npeople that they wanted to kill us? That they robbed us. For what? I have some pictures that one of\nour workers brought us in the ghetto and brought us to the ghetto. He found the pictures on the\nfloor, whatever he found, he got into the house because we had a little dog and the dog didn't want\nto leave the house and constantly sitting and crying. So he came in to get a blanket, something from\nthe house to take him to his house, and he found the pictures and he brought them to the ghetto to\nRaddan. And we couldn't understand how can we go on living to look at people that, some were\ngood and helped us, some just wanted to get rid of us. That was the hardest part that we did not\nknow how we will survive, how we can go on in life. And that, we didn't think it will be so fast, but\nthat night a lot of airplanes were passing above us. And he came in, he came home that time. And\nhe came into our barn and he showed us that in case they bomb and the barn catches on fire, there\nwas insurance, so the grass was high, he took out a rock from the, and we should get through there\nand run to the fields. This is what he prepared for us. On Saturday morning, afternoon, we see the\nGermans are coming into the village and starting to station themselves. Put up their equipment, to\nput the fence, and I thought, here, this is the day that we are dying. We got to, we lived to and that\nis the date we are going to die. Because no way will we survive. The village will catch on fire, we\nhave no place to run. We can run through the grass, but that will be hot, too. But that's the end of\nus.

This was luck, this was luck, you have to call it fate. That was luck. And of\ncourse, next morning we knew that they are all gone. That for us was the end of the war but we\nwere afraid to go to town. We didn't know what to do. But we knew if we will stay longer and they\nwill think that he has Jews in the house, we'll be killed there from the White Poles. So my brother\nand Yaffa's father, they went to Ashashoc because it was only three kilometers we were hiding from\nAshashoc. And they went there and they met some people and they met some Russian people,\nRussian soldiers and they told them to wait another couple of days because it's insecure to come\nright now. Because they are right now and a minute later Germans can retreat and come\nback. So we waited a couple of days. Of course, we did not sleep, we did not eat, we were alert all\nthe time and then we decided we must go because we cannot stay here. And we went to town, we\ncame in to our house, I want to think about the three kilometers walking to the house. And\nimagining the town with Jews, without my friends, without everybody. And I don't know how we\nmade it, I think we were numb. We did not think what we are doing. We were numb. And we\ncame into our house and it an elderly couple living and they got very scared and we told them not to\nbe scared. They'll have to move out eventually, but they can still stay until they find a place to stay.\nOf course, there's nothing there. We bought some lumber and we made some little beds and picked\nup a few pillows and we were about 20 people in our house, all single people. Anybody that was\nsingle came to my mother. My mother was their mother, everybody. We ourselves did not have yet\nwhat to eat, but we knew we will not be short on food. They will bring us food.

We come on the train, it gets a little dark and we heard them, what we heard,\nnotified us that we are going to Budapest from there. And we hear coming up that soldiers are there\nand they are talking to themselves, look, if they are coming from a camp, how come they have\nbackpacks? When they will fall asleep, we'll grab their backpacks and we will throw them down\nfrom the train. What do you do? So here we are sitting holding each other tight and we are not\nsleeping when you are sitting like this on the train. Waiting the night should get over and we should\nsurvive the night. We did. And we're coming into Budapest and they pack us, not a car, how do\nyou call it, the communication, it was a streetcar. And they pack us and I had a fair cold, a\n. And I hear one saying, she's coming from camp, how does she have a cold like\nthis? They didn't have in camps this kind of colds. Let's find out who they are.

And we have to change to another one to\nrun into another one and there they will tell us where we have to go. Anyway, they were not one,\nthere were probably several, one remained, the other ones jumped off with me and we changed to\nanother streetcar and we came to the camp where we are assigned. And we never could get out\nfrom the camp. That's where we had to stay until we was transferred. I was lucky. One morning,\nwe were 60 people in a room, sleeping all the way on the floor, no pillows, nothing, whatever we\nwould cover or something. One woman comes on and she goes and looks around and looks and\nlooks and she's, you could see she's an elderly person but she's so desperate. So I stopped her, I\nsaid, lady, what are you looking? She says, my daughter, they took her away, the Germans and\nmaybe with so many people coming, maybe she will be there among them. And you look so much\nlike her. So, I says, no, I'm not her.

        "Q: In Lodsch you were there how long?",
        "A: Lodsch was so blank to me, Lodsch was really blank to me. Because it was terrible there. So at\nBudapest at least I went out, I saw, the first time we saw food, the first ttme we saw corn, we can\nbuy acorn to eat. And because otherwise in the camps was just soup and bread. So, I, they pack us\non a streetcar and I was the last one, everybody got in and I was standing on the step holding on to\nthe handles. And I fell back and I remain myself, the streetcar goes, leaves. And I don't know\nwhere to go and I don't know the language and I don't know, I knew just few words that I learned\nfrom her. And I don't know and it's getting dark. And I got so many stories that people were caught\non the street and they were sent to Siberia. Because the Russian soldiers were obviously around\nthere. I only knew that the camp must be like in the back, I have to go back and undid it. Like on\nthe north side of the street 1s a big building and there is the camp, the camp obviously was always\nlocked, we couldn't go out when we wanted. But I, I don't know how I made it. I don't know.

And the next time they did bring us, they brought us to a\nstation and there one of my cousins got very sick. We had to go past, it was by Yugoslavia because\nI heard speaking there. In four hours we had to make it to that station where we were supposed to\nmeet. People broke their feet, people broke their arms, there was up and down, there was\nmountains, there was, we made it. We were carrying each other, we were holding on to each other,\nwe made it in four hours. And my mother, we made it, we came there, but where we were so close\ntogether and there they packed us and took us to Italy. We came to Italy, we went to Venice and\nthen we went, very short, I just, barely saw the birds and the water and they transferred us to\nPatawa(ph). And from Patawa I remember we were so hungry, we had no food and we went out\nand we bought a piece of herring, and we didn't see herring all the time from the war, and we ate\nwith bread and then they told us they're sending us to near Milano. Not, now I'm blank, I can't\nremind myself where it is the camp. Because I got married there. And we were there in a camp\nwith 80 people, who wants to sing in the middle of the night, who wants to get married and fight\nwith their wife every middle of the night, who wants to, and here we are there in the middle.\nAnyway, by that time, on the last stop, when we came to go to Italy, this I missed, we were there\nand my legs were very swollen and my brother always, he was very tall, he was six foot tall, he\nliked to hear stories.

Even she has\nthere the two sons and the sons were very good to my mother. Very good. But she wanted to live\nwith me, not to go back to Brazil. The life there was terrible when they came in.

        "Q: How long did it take you to stop thinking about all that you had been through?",
        "A: Because I was very busy. I worked in the store from eight until, sometimes until 10:00 at night.\nWe did not go to restaurants to eat. We cooked. And I was a very clean housekeeper so there was a\nlot of work at home. My mother started to get ill, so I was busy with her very much. There was no\ntime to think. This is a big ,no time.

It was before the parade in Pasadena, the Jewish Agency sent us tickets that we should\nhave a place to take him because they have places. He had, he could have a lot more honor here.\nWhy I was so afraid for him, I don't know. I was so overprotective of him that I did, I was afraid to\nlet him go in public places. Everyone that called us, I used to investigate like, who he is, what he's,\nGod forbid somebody would not do something to him. That was a very big mistake for me. But he\nhad a good time here. He had, we took him to Disneyland and my niece bought him, everybody\nbought him beautiful presents and he used to get up, things he never saw in his life.\n, they gave him a silver cup and he said, what do I do?

And we build a temple. We brought the cornerstone from Israel for the new temple.",
        "Q: Something that I'm always curious about. You went through so much difficulty and trauma\nbecause you were Jewish. Some people like the man who went into Russia, probably decided they\ndidn't want to be Jewish any more. For you this was important?",
        "A: For me it was important. And our children, from the first possibility they could do, were brought\nup in Camp , for example the year that my mother died, I thought I cannot send them\nto Camp , we did not have the money. Because the hospital and the burial and the\ndebt of my mother was absolutely outrageous for me. I didn't think I can cope with it.",
        "Q: What year was that?",

        "Q: Let me ask you one more question. Clearly, having gone through this, impacted you later on.\nHow you lived your life, your values, maybe how you raised your children. Can you talk about that\na little bit?",
        "A: Yeah. I could. The minute we used to, my mother said one thing, the minute you'll make for a\ntrip, first thing you go see the brothers how they live in Brazil. Because she felt always sorry that\nhere we have a nice, very modest home, very modest. Because we didn't look for anything, we just\nlooked, we had to support my nephew in Israel because he was by himself. And he did need\nsupport. And we felt like nothing means to us but to educate the children about Judaism and to\nlearn Hebrew and even my husband was teaching them Hebrew at night. But they did not have\nenough respect to study with him. So they used to fall asleep on the table because it didn't, it's better\nto play football than to study. But we took a Hebrew teacher from Israel that he used to come twice\na week and teach them Hebrew. And we started, as they got older, of course, first was Camp\n, and then we started to send them to Israel. And then when my daughter,\nwhere she went to school there was two and a half Jews. For under 50 children graduated, there\nwas only this couple of Jewish children. I always used to tell her about to be aware that she will\nhave to marry a Jew. She cannot intermarry. And it came to high school, the graduation, she had to\ngo to overnight parties and she wanted to go. And she got some boys there that she brought home\nand she gave them Jewish names and she comes in and she introduces me, they are Jewish, and I,\nthis is Paul and this is this and this is this and I said, what's their last name? And she says,\n, | know it smart, she's read it all in the newspaper. I know this. She says, mother, I\nwant to go, I don't want to miss this fun and I'm going with one.

        "A: The Russians. The time of the Russians. For the time of the Lithuanian, I'll tell you an incident\nfor example. The border between White Russia and Lithuania was only three kilometers from our\ntown. My brother, the youngest brother, loved animals. So, he asked to one Pole if he can bring\nhim a nice horse. And since our tannery was right on the border, it was easy to sneak it in. And he\nbrought him a horse. And he went to pick up the horse and bring it to the barn near the house. I\nalmost, I forgot it, I just, recently when I was in Brazil where my brothers lived, my brother did\nremind me, do you remember how you saved my life? And I said what did I do? He said, don't you\nremember when I was bringing the horse home and a Lithuanian policeman came up to him and\nsaid he wants, where did you get the horse? Did you bring it from over the border? And he said,\nno, I bought it from the tannery and I'm bringing it to the house. Which was true, he picked it up\nfrom the tannery. But, he said, no, it's a too beautiful horse. You got it from over, and he wanted to\ntake it away. And I didn't know what's going on, I was standing in the house in the window and all\nof a sudden I see he's standing, my brother stays with the horse and he's arguing with the policeman.\nAnd the policeman was grabbing his gun to him. So, I ran out and I jumped on the policeman and I\ngrabbed, I almost grabbed the gun out of him and pushed him away from my brother. And then I\nstarted, give him the horse, let him take the horse, we get into the house. There were certain things,\nsome are forgotten and some things come, some remind you of whatever was during the war,\ncertain incidents. But we were a normal life, we used to go for an evening school, in evening\nschools we were going, studying the languages. Until, of course, the Germans came in.",

But the business was kind of not normal.",

And we, of course, any\ntruck that stopped, we went to ask them what is going on. And they say, you don't know? The\nGermans declared war. And they are, they were running back to Russia, because Lithuania was full\nof Russian people. They were under their command. And so we knew that, we actually found out\nthat there is going to be a war again. There was news that the Russians, that the Lithuanians are\nkilling the Russians. They are throwing them into the ocean. Because they actually want friends,\nthey didn't like them. It was just superficial that they lived in harmony. They were, they wanted to\nget rid of them. And they, and the war, early in the morning we heard the Germans marching in.\nBecause, and I remember I had a cousin that was in the Polish Army and we didn't sleep that night.\nWe were standing and talking, what will it be, what will he do? What is going on? We did not\nknow what to expect. And we heard, I heard, like somebody would play with rocks, the noise like\nyou throw rocks, so I says, but what is this noise? Do you hear? What is it? They said, they are\nthrowing parachutes. And he said, you'll see. Because he knew, he was in the army, he understood\nbetter than we did. They are parachuting some people here. And in no time they will march in.\nAnd it didn't take too long, and in the morning, the Germans started to march in. So, we left the\nhouse and we went to some of our workers. We stayed there all day. And then we decided we have\nto go to our house. To see what, what will it be with us? Of course, in those times there was no, no\ncamps, no death camps, nothing. They just, well, people lived under the German occupations. It\nwas scary. There was a lot of things going on. But, we did not expect what we had later on. And,\nbut we came home and we lived for awhile. On the second day, for example, I was standing in the\nwindow and a couple of Germans walked up to us and one German looks up and I had a watch in\nmy hand. And he said, give me the watch. I'm in my house, why should I give him the watch? I\ncouldn't understand it. So, I said, no. And my brother heard it and came, he said, take off the watch\nand give it to him in a hurry.

Because our house\nwas in the middle of the town and it was very big. It was a two story and as they were coming in\nmore and more, they occupied for the main stop, for the main office, so the Germans, the very\nimportant Germans used to stay in our house. And right away they put up a note, that nobody is\nallowed to come in there. So, we actually did not suffer too much. In a way, they used to take out\nsome people.

And I was\nrunning from one house to another house where there were fathers to see what are they doing.\nMaybe they know better than we what we know. And they kept saying, one said, where can I run?\nI have to go to more ask for a piece of bread. So, how can I run? And others says, how can we run?\nLook at my old mother, she can't work, she's in bed most of the time. I went into another girlfriend,\nI said, Myrtle, what are you doing? How can I run? My daughter is pregnant. The brought her\nfrom Lider(ph), from the bigger towns, they pulled out people and brought to the small towns\nbecause they're still, and those were, I'm talking all about the wealthier people. Where can I run?\nLook at her, she is to have a baby any day. Where can I run? I'm not running. I'll stay. And I was\nrunning around like this all day, not knowing what, what will it come out. And then I came, I got\ntired, and I came, it was getting a little dark. I came into the house and my mother was going to\nlight the candles. And I look out through the window and I see civilian people who\non their shoulders. So, I got very frightened. I thought, gee, that's not, that's not\nnormal. They are not Germans, they are civilians. So, I kept yelling, I yelled out to my mother, you\n, let's run. But we weren't ready, where to run also. So, we ran, we thought we will\ngo to one of our workers, to get united with my sister and the children. But, by coincidence, in the\nmorning, we had a lot of money in the house. And we decided to go hide it where the tannery is.\nBecause the tannery 1s in the back of the town. If we need money, we can sooner dig it out. Like in\ntown, everybody is watching over you. As I and my brother were going to take the, with a whole\nbasket of money that we carried, we put a stick in and he carried from one side, I from the other\nside. One of the Pole, a Pole that was coming from church, this was on Sunday, and he gets, comes\ncloser to us and says, , | feel so bad, I hear that it's a bad time coming on us, on\nyou. And if you want, come, run to me. To my farm. But we never knew where a farm is out of\ntown, we never went out of town. We never went anywhere, we didn't know where to go. So, that\nwas in the afternoon, and then at night, we decided, and I said to my mother, let's run. I knew where\nwe have to run to. To be united with my sister because my brothers we knew are hidden there. I,\nThe folowing tanscript is the result of recorded interview.

My mother looked around and she found my brothers, sitting in the barn. And she says,\nwhat are you doing here? They say they couldn't leave town because there was, there were rumors\nthat they are shooting. So, we returned back home. So she said to them, what is my life? My life\ndoesn't mean anything. If you don't save yourself, what does it mean to me? So, she said, go to the\ngarden, we had a big garden in the, right after the houses. And she said to them, go in the garden.\nLay down under the leaves from the cucumbers because they are very big now. And, see, at night if\nyou can get out. And she did, in the meantime, she didn't, I left. And when I was running, one of\nthe Poles there, said to me, Mirchka(ph), where are you running? You'll get shot, don't run. I'll tell\nyou, I'll get into, where do you want to go? I was not smart enough, and I told them where I'm\nrunning. I wasn't supposed to say where I'm running. But, I told them, I'm going to the Vladik's(ph)\nhouse. And he said, well, I'll get into the house, I'll open up the window in my house, and you jump\nthrough the window and then cross the street and get in. So, he did, he went into the house and\nopened up the window and I went through the window, I jumped over and I crossed the street and I\nwas reunited with my sister. And there were three, four, four families more, Jewish families that\nnight. And, of course, I was with three children, my sister and we had the boy, the cousin from\nVilna, and there was a big commotion. This one to eat and this one to drink and all night we were\nvery busy. And then in the morning, his wife came out and says that you will all have to leave\nbecause I don't want to get killed because of you.\nTape 3",
        "A: So, I said to her, don't worry, we won't stay here. I will try, I'll take one child and I'll try to move\nto the factory. To the tannery, because it's very close there. It was close to the tannery, he was\nworking for us, all my live I knew him. And his brothers were working for us, too. And, if they'll\ncatch me there, all they can do is kill me. But I am in my own place so we will not cause trouble to\nyou. And I got into there, to the house, and I was still thinking about the Pole who gave us the idea\nto run to his house. And I also knew from another Pole that came about five days before to our\nhouse, and he looked up and we were boarding the sister and the children, and he warned us, he said\nto my mother, why did you bring your daughter and children here? The Lithuanians wants a clean\nLithuania with no Jews. And in White Russia, the Jews, I don't know how long, but the Jews who\nstill live in Lithuania, they are going to kill all the Jews. And we knew that he is from the more\nintelligent Poles, not just the farmer, it was a very rich farmer. But he had children, they were very\nhigh rank in the Polish army, all officers. We knew that he knows something, but the way he\nexpressed it, so, we did not want to accept it. So, after he left us, my mother said,\n, he came to our house and eats our supper, . We couldn't\nbelieve it, we didn't want to believe it. Who is going to chase us out of the house? It's ours. It went\nfrom generation to generation. And he was, he gave us also the idea, the only ones that will survive\nis people that they will hide. And my oldest brother, later on, went and he stayed with him for\nawhile. But, it was very hard to hide because they all had people working for them, and they knew\nthey will talk to those, they are keeping Jews. But, as I was in the tannery all the day, then I told my\nsister, if I pass through right, she should come. But we did not know where my mother is. My\nmother wasn't with us. We knew that my brothers, I didn't know that they are in town. We were\nsure that they are protected. Because the first thing for the protection was the men. What we\nlooked. And as I, and I said to the janitor, where is Marisha(ph)? Marisha was married to him, she\nwas a maid for us. And I wanted to go to town and find out where my mother is.

So I thought, well, we started to feel more and more that we are not wanted\nanyplace. We have no place, we have no way, we don't know what to do. So, I said, no, I will not\nbe here too long. And there was a slaughterhouse nght near our tannery. I saw a young man\ncoming out, so there was a hope chest standing in this little house. And there was even some of our\nthings. I took out a piece of material for a suit and I called him, I don't remember his name. And I\nsaid, if you tell me where Kokochan(ph) is, a village, where the Pole told us that if we want, we\nshould run to him, I will give you this piece of material. He said, I don't want to be killed. Because\nif I'll go with you, I'll get killed. I said, no you won't. You go from one side and I go from another\nside, far away from each other. And, if they catch me, obviously, they will kill me, but I will never\nsay that you are going with me. I will never, I promise you, I will not give you out.

But I asked him to go and bring my sister with\nthe other two children, and she'll give you more things. She'll pay good off. And he did, and he\nbrought my sister and the children there. But, there was, at the time of the Russians, this Pole\nhimself, was hiding, because he was a rich farmer. So, he was afraid that they will send him out to\nSiberia, too. So, he had workers, and the workers did not want us. They want us out and out and\nout. So, we told them that we will not stay. We only want to know where my mother is. So, and\nthe owner, the farmer, was not in. He went to to see what's going on with the\nJews. What kind of commotion is going on. So, I said, the minute you will find out where my\nmother is, we are going to be gone from your house. We will not stay here. Not knowing where\nwill we go, what will we do, where is anybody? I, anyway, they kept, we want you out, we want\nyou out. So, when he came, he gave us a horse and buggy, next day. And we were going to move\nto a village that we knew where the Tartars are.

If not, we\nwill have to go to Raddan. And we came there, I did remain to see what, you'll go to town and\nyou'll find out where my mother is. He did go and he came with the news that my mother went with\nall the Jews to the temple. They are all locked up. And he said, so my place was, I felt I have to go\nto see what is with my sister and the children. We went there, but he was, he brought us every day\ninformation. Where my mother is, where my, he found out that my brothers did not leave the town.\nThey are hiding in a shoemaker's house in town.

Tonight or tomorrow night. I was, went, I was with\nmy sister there, we had what to eat. Obviously, they gave us what to eat. And, but, we don't, we did\nnot know what we should do. We were absolutely, we didn't know where should we turn, where\nshould we go. And, then he told us, we didn't know what was going on, but we heard that on\nWednesday, they took out all the Jews from the temples there and they brought them out a big\nmarket which used to be the, the farmers used to bring in their cattle and their food to sell, there was\none, like a farmer's market they called it. Once a week they used to come there with everything to\nsell to town. And my mother is there, too. We told the people. We did not know what the fate will,\nwhat will be with us, we didn't know what will be with her. My brothers did not come out yet. But,\nnext night they did come in, they came in. They came in, but of course, we knew we cannot be\nthere. So, we moved to another place, another, it was a mother to this worker of ours. She took us\nin for awhile. And, knowing that is the hardest part, with children, we have three small children.\nWe have a 13 year old, we have a two and a half and a year.

We'll send them there and there was no ghettos yet. And we'll\nsee if they will meantime be there until we will know what, until we reunite together.

        "A: Yes, yes. My mother came, she knew everything. They brought them out, they get out Sunday\nnight. They brought, near us was a small town where a mental institution for mental people, they\nput them out in a row, but entering the temple, like in the hall. And every, and then they announced\nthat everybody should come to the temple. They can bring in what they carry on their shoulders.\nThey gave them sticks and they told everybody to hit over their heads. So, they were beating up\neverybody. The name of this town was Shiloch(ph), a small little town. And then, of course, the\nbrought from another, from Walkinik(ph) was a small town. They brought Jews from Walkinik,\nalso, to the temple. And it was very crowded and there were people sick, people having children.\nNo facilities to go out. But I heard that one of my girlfriends and the Commandant, the Lithuanian\nCommandant came to the temple, she went out, because we knew him, and she said to him, give us\na way of, live with dignity. Not, there was no bathrooms, there was nothing. She says, or kill us.\nPick what you want. Or kill us or give us a way to live like humans. And he said, we'll see, we'll\nsee. That was Sunday night, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. They brought all of the Jews, all of\nthem out from the temple in the market. The market was closed gates. And they told everybody to\nsit down, nobody can stand up. Now, one man, he was asthmatic and he could not breath. So he\nstood up. And they shot him. So this was the first casualty in this parking place. And then, in no\ntime, mother was there. Now, we weren't there, but every day that Polish man used to bring us all\nthe news.

And they took them and they shot them there. They brought us information, for\nexample, that one of my cousins, got out from the grave and he said, if you want, I'll give you the\nhair off my head, but shoot us right. Because about, they were all, they made them undress and they\nwere shooting them and they were falling into the graves. But some weren't shot. They covered\nthem when they were still alive. So, he said, shoot us right. But we still didn't believe it. And one\nof our worker's wives came to my mother, to bring her food, and tell her, we want to save you.\nOnce you are out of here, come, we will save you. They used to bring food and give it to the people\nthat were watching around there. And they wanted to save her. And my mother says, she is not\ngoing out. She is afraid. Until on the second day, one came and she actually beat up my mother,\nand she kicked her out with her feet. She put a big shawl on her and she kicked her so bad that she\nbrought her up to a nearby house and put her up in the, made her go up in the attic and she said, you\nare going here to lay, I will cover you with straw, but you cannot move until I will come back to\nyou.

        "A: Yes. This was, because when my mother, when there was, on the premises where they were,\nwhen they told my mother why they want to save her, and they told her where they are killing the\nJews, she came up to, there were two doctors, Jewish doctors. And she says to them, what should\nwe do because some young people wanted to revolt against it, they said, let's kill at least some\nGermans. We're getting killed, let's kill, they didn't let them because they said, because if you\nrevolt, we'll all get killed. Obviously, they would have, they killed them anyway. But, he said to\nthem, so my mother, this 1s boykavochnik(ph), you are such a smart woman, you are a business\nwoman. Can you believe that they will kill 4,000 people? No, it's impossible! They won't do it,\nthey cannot do it! And they made her, she is stupid to believe them. And this is, still when it\nhappened, nobody believed it, that that's going to happen. We thought, they'll make a ghetto. We\nthought they will take away from us everything. But we could not believe they are going to kill us.\nWe couldn't believe it. And that's how we were fooled all the time. Because we did not believe it.\nAnd later on, in experience, every town was a different way of killing. It was always before a\nJewish holiday. There was always a diff, there was always with a different excuse. There was not\nexcuses, but they were differently that nobody could believe it.

And, what can I do for you?\nWe had nothing, I just ran out from the house like I stayed, with nothing, I didn't even have time to\nput on a pair of shoes. I took the shoes with me and ran out in a pair of slippers. So I said, no,\nnothing, I really don't, I want a toothbrush. Forget about toothpaste, a toothbrush and a little salt to\nbe able to brush our teeth. So, she says, no, but you don't need any underwear or nothing? I said,\nno, a little towel and a dishtowel.

And we were, we were still believe that there would come a miracle.\nAnother day, another day, there will a miracle for us. We, something God has to do for us. It was,\nbut the day never came. It never came. The only one that was right is the Polish man that took us\nout that night because this was Saturday, Friday night and on Sunday, they surround Raddan and\nthey went from house to house and we did not have White Russian passports, the took him and they\nkilled him.

So, he gave her a prayer book and he told her, you bring 1t home\nto them and tell them, they, occasionally they feel weak, they should eat meat. No bones, not any of\nthe bones, just eat a piece of meat for survival. But the future, we did not, I don't think we were\nthinking hard. I don't think we had the ability of thinking what will happen to us. What should we\ndo? Where should it go? What, we didn't, but we felt like whatever they advised us, this, the first\nfarmer, the one that had the sons that they were hiring in Polish army and everything, we felt that\nthey are right. The only way we can survive is by hiding. And I was very much fed up and I was\nagainst it. I kept telling to my brother, why do we have to be different? Everybody, all my\ngirlfriends are killed. Everybody is killed. Why do we, why do we have to be stubborn and want to\nleave? What purpose? What? What, they are all killed, nobody is here around us.

Of course, this Pole had a big vision and he told us how we can hide.\nHe made hiding places for us in the houses, but the Poles had a smell, somehow they used to feel,\nthat this and this family is hiding somebody. They had a very funny feeling. If they saw an extra\nfrom the chimney, extra smoke is coming out, she is baking bread more than normally she would\nbake for herself. This is how they used to find out. And if one knew, right away they started the\nother one, they're starting to talk.

And Maria was always hanging on\nthe, the picture was always hanging on the wall. And he used to say, he used to say, darn you and\nstart praying. And he says, mother, I have to do something. I want to, they are good people, I want\nto save them. And she was begging him, give up. Give up. You'll get killed because of them.

Not having a tomorrow, not,\nwe had to think, obviously, what tomorrow will bring us? We didn't. What did we do? I don't\nknow. I used to get up in the morning, if we set, if we were in the house, I used to help her peel\npotatoes, make the pancakes for, the men used to come from the field. I used to wash everybody's\nlaundry, whatever, if you want to call it, but, I don't know what we did.",
        "A: Not only, not outside, never outside. Only, I was in the kitchen in certain places. In some\nplaces, I didn't, we were there day and night. It depends which place. We were once in a place that\neverybody died from typhus. And we were still there in that house and we didn't catch it. Only one\nchild survived. The father and the mother and the sister, they all died from typhus. They were in\ntheir house and we were in a small, in a very small corner that you could not even move like this. It\nused to come a holiday, people there used to come to visit sometimes. We were sitting in certain\ncellars, sitting, could never move. We couldn't turn over from one side to another side. We had to\nsit like this. Was there a little, some food is okay, for two, three days we never could move. There\nwere times, but we, I can't understand today, what, how we did it. I can't. It was winter, it was a\nvery cold winter. We had no clothes. We had no water to, in times that we were in a barn that we\ndid not have to wash ourselves. But she used to bring in one pail of water for 10 people, for\nexample, sometimes more. So we had one cup of water for each one.

And this is when he found out about the smoke of the chimney.\nThe smoke is going out too often, that means she is baking bread for some Jews. And, we, the\nPolish man came, the one that took care of us, and he transferred us to another place. But there did\nremain still 10 people. Two of my cousins, one with the family, his wife and child and another one.\nAnd day they came, the White Poles came in on a Sunday. The boys weren't there, they were just\ntwo little, two small girls, a 10 year old and an 8 year old girl. And they said you have to show us\nwhere you hide the Jews. And she says, I have no Jews.

But they are building a new church at the end of the town. I should,\nafter we get through here, he should take me there and he will talk to me. So we met him and I told\nhim the story so he can make us out Polish papers. All of us. And maybe we can survive as Poles,\nbut we have to go away from this neighborhood. So, I said no, because our Polish accent will give\nus out right away. Because we spoke Polish more like the White Russians, not like in Warsaw, like\n. So I said about to give away the children, then we'll take at least the sister with us.\nSo he said, I'll try. I'll try everything because I will not forget what you did for me. During the\nRussian occupation, that he was hiding, his wife was already sent to Siberia. This Pole was his\ncousin and he used to come during the market day [phone ringing]. After the church, we went there\nand we met him. And he told me what he can do, he said, alright, he will see what he can do about\nthe children. And next day he gave us an answer. He gave us the answer that he has a very good\nplace, and we knew, because we knew everybody. And I knew that this is, it cannot be it was a\nmiracle. It was a big, rich farmer, they were very good people. Very nice. And they will take the\ntwo children to raise them. And we notified my sister. Everything wasn't easy. Because everything\ngot, , there was no communication, no telephones, nothing. And she said she is\nnot giving the children, she wants to die wherever the children are, together. So, we failed on this.\nThen I went into the ghetto and I met some people from our home town. And they were talking and\nthey told me what they suffer from this man. And to us he is an angel. So, and I should talk to him.\nAnd I talked to him and he told me why he wants, he does not take revenge from all the Jewish\npeople, only ones, the people that they, 1t was their fault to send his wife to Siberia. But, anyway,\nhe got, he was, he really was better. Because, as I said, we did him a lot of favors, by not giving\nhim out to the Russians, by, I used to open up the back door and let him in to meet his cousin.

And I am afraid to go near the horse and I am afraid to go near the cow. The cow we\nhad I would maybe cope with it, but I don't know how to milk a cow like they milk. And I insist I\nhave to learn, I have to do it. So, it didn't take long, next day I was feeding the cow, I wasn't afraid\nfor the horse, I went to them in the morning to the woods to cut trees down for, because there was\nno men in the house, it was all women. And young children. To cut the trees, but I'll tell you, every\ntree that I cut that ground was soaked with my tears. This I remember. There was so much tears in\nthat forest that I tell, this is how we are, be cutting us down. Like I should not cut the trees because\nwhy do I do it to the trees when we've been cut down like this? This I can, I don't, I never I think\nrepeated it, but I couldn't take to cut down a tree. I couldn't.

Maybe they will recognize that I'm Jewish. So I\nused to tell them that I am very sick and I'm very tired and I used to get into the barn and dig in\nmyself all the way on the bottom and hide. Until one day a doctor was passing from, walking from\nVilna to Gordna and this was on the road from Vilna to Grodna, that village.

I have some pictures that one of\nour workers brought us in the ghetto and brought us to the ghetto. He found the pictures on the\nfloor, whatever he found, he got into the house because we had a little dog and the dog didn't want\nto leave the house and constantly sitting and crying.

And he organized and it\nwas going very beautifully, but he felt that just teaching is not enough, they have to have acting,\nthey have to have singing, they have to have a little fun, the children. They didn't live yet, they\ndidn't have any fun. So there came a friend of his that he knows, that he was an author, a singer in\nWarsaw and he also was a Cantor(ph) in Vilna. And he took him in. He said, I'll teach you the\nHebrew, every night what you have to teach tomorrow, but you occupy the children in\n, It means in acting and other things. And he did.

And it came to high school, the graduation, she had to\ngo to overnight parties and she wanted to go. And she got some boys there that she brought home\nand she gave them Jewish names and she comes in and she introduces me, they are Jewish, and I,\nthis is Paul and this is this and this is this and I said, what's their last name?

So and then, the other parties she\nused to bring some from the temple, some of the boys. And she went, and then when she got\nmarried, she moved to New York. And her children, she started to bring up in the schuls(ph), in\nHebrew schools.",

        "A: Not too much. I talk now more than I used to. Now if we come together, we always find a way\nto talk about survival. Unless my friend is up here. And tell them things. And everybody 1s\ninterested. It's funny. Everybody wants to know. It's not, they are not running away because I tell\nthem.
