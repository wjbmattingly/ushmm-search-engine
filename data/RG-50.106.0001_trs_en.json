        "Q: And so, by 1939, was she still working at all, or was it basically impossible?",
        "A: She was still working.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And that would have been still the children's clothing store?",

        "Q: Mm-hmm. Okay. Why don't you tell me what happened to your aunt, I guess.",
        "A: She was married. And on the night of her wedding, they killed her husband and she\ncommitted suicide.",
        "Q: And when was that approximately?",
        "A: '40, '41 -- I'm not really sure.",
        "Q: And that would have been in Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, Germany.",
        "Q: And I mean, I know who you're talking about when you say \"they,\" but do you know\nspecifically it was the SS?",
        "A: SS.",
        "Q: Yeah. And who told you that?",
        "A: My mother. These are things that my mother told me. Unfortunately, I didn't take\nenough dates down.",
        "Q: Sure. No, I understand. Sure. Now, was your father's family originally from\nGermany, or do you know how long they were --",
        "A: They were originally from Germany. They were from Gelsenkirchen.",
        "Q: Can you spell that for me?",
        "A: G-E-L-S-E-N-K-I-R-C-H-E-N.",
        "Q: Okay. And where is that in relation to Berlin, if you know?",
        "A: Not really -- outside. Small town.",
        "Q: How long had they been in Berlin, your parents, do you know?",
        "A: Actually, my father was living in Gelsenkirchen and came to Berlin on a business trip\nand met my mother at that time through a friend.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Actually, my mother was dating his best friend. And he was supposed to deliver a note\nto the best friend. And that's how they met.",
        "Q: It was more than a note he delivered. Okay. Let's then go to your mother's family\nnow. Did she have brothers and sisters?",
        "A: No, she was also an only child.",
        "Q: Okay. And her background was -- was she also German, or do you know where she\nwas from?",
        "A: Yes, yes -- her father was from Austria, from Vienna.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Okay. And her father's name, can I ask you that?",
        "A: Her father's name was (?Kamil?)",
        "Q: And that would have been K-O.",
        "A: K-O-H-N.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, you're born in October of 1939, and I guess what we're going to do is\nrely a little bit on maybe your mother's recollection of this early period until you had your\nown recollections as a child. But do you know what kinds of circumstances you were\nliving in in Berlin at that time from your mother? Do you know if you're still 1n a house,\nan apartment, or?",
        "A: Well, to go back a bit, my grandmother's name was Teresa. And she converted to\nJudaism when she married my grandfather who was a devout Jew.",
        "Q: Okay. This is on your paternal or --",
        "A: This was my mother's mother. So that lays the background a little more of why things\nhappened later on that didn't happen to her.",
        "Q: Okay. So your maternal grandmother basically converted. And what was her religion\nbefore?",
        "A: Protestant.",
        "Q: Protestant. Okay. All right. So the circumstances you were living in.",
        "A: My grandfather was a prominent person in Avatas [?] until stock market and\neverything collapsed. And he lost all. He died in 1935. Basically when he lost\neverything, he gave up. They were wealthy people, always had a live-in maid. My\nmother grew up in those circumstances. Went to private schools.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And, after my grandfather died, my mother -- from the little money that he had left --\nshe opened the store to sell the children's clothes, started the business.",
        "Q: I see. Tell me about a little bit -- and I'm sorry we're backtracking Mrs. Gelfer, but\nthis is interesting. Tell me a little bit about her career as an actress -- what you know\nabout it.",
        "A: Mainly on a stage. In fact, she was starting to make a name for herself. Small town\nstage productions. She always wanted to be an actress from way back. She always\nmentioned she dropped out of school without her parents knowing about it and went to\nacting school.",
        "Q: And did she use her name Johanna?",
        "A: No, her stage name was Junsi. That was a nickname my grandfather had for her. And\nKarnau, K-A-R-N-A-U, was her stage name.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Okay. Do you have any memorabilia from that time period or anything?",
        "A: Ihave pictures of her. She was a slight person. Very trim. Boyish figure. She did\nthings like William Tell's son. Cape Leer's son. A lot of these kind of parts. She did.\nMy great grandfather was a ballet master of the Vienna opera house, so maybe there was\na little theatrical book in there from the beginning.",
        "Q: And that would have been on her side.",
        "A: That's my grandfather's father. There are three cousins in Austria which are quite\nwell-known writers by the name of Braun. That's B-R-A-U-N.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Okay. So she owned her children's store.",
        "A: So she was used to the finer things in life, born in well-to-do situation.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And this was in Berlin.",
        "A: This was.",
        "Q: When was she born; do you know\u201d?",
        "A: December 30, 1904.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Back -- going back now to 1939 time period when you were first born,\nwere you living in an apartment -- just the three of you -- or do you know?",
        "A: We were living in an apartment with my grandmother -- the four of us.",
        "Q: And that would have been her mother -- your mother's mother.",
        "A: My mother's mother.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we lived in that apartment till we left Germany.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. So, as far as you know, you lived in the same place.",
        "A: All my life.",
        "Q: Okay. From 1939 to --",
        "A: -- 1949.",
        "Q: Okay. Ten years later. All right. What are your first recollections as a child?",
        "A: First recollections, I would say, would be wandering around streets with my\ngrandmother not knowing the reason why really. Days and nights. I also had an aunt that\nwas really not an aunt; it was just a very close friend of a cousin and later his wife who\nprotected us. And she would pick me up and walk me in parks and streets. And I really\nhad no idea why I was doing this.",
        "Q: Do you know now?",
        "A: Yes, of course. That was just to hide me.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: [remember my father coming home from work and he would put me on his shoulders\nand ride me around the dining room and my mother would be saying, \"You're tired. Don't\ndo that.\" That's -- my father take me to the park.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Bits and pieces there.",
        "Q: Do you know what kind of work your father was doing then?",
        "A: At that time he was teaching. He taught until the very end when he was.",
        "Q: Okay. When was that; do you know?",
        "A: December 22, 1942. And he was taken right out of the classroom.",
        "Q: Do you know what happened to him?",
        "A: No. We just know that there was a sign in Berlin where they always had the -- the\nlists of people who were gone, had died. And it just had his number -- 21450 -- and his\nname behind it. Some said he was on his way to ___, but there was no proof of tt.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. How are you so certain -- it's just interesting Miss Gelfer, that date.",
        "A: The date was my mother went to the town hall every day to see if his name was there.\nOne day the date was there, the number was there.",
        "Q: I see. Now, once your father was taken away, was it just then the three of you in the\nhouse?",
        "A: Three of us, yes.",
        "Q: Now, what I think I'll do, Ms. Gelfer, just a little bit easier, I'm going to go through\nyour recollections first from your childhood to the time you were liberated essentially to\nalmost the present. And then what I'd like to do is go back and sort of I'll put you in the\nshoes of your mother in a sense and have you recollect what she has told you about that.\nI think that will be probably a easier way to do it as opposed to skipping back and forth.",
        "A: I have something that I don't know if you'd like to use or not, but my father wrote me a\npoem right after I was born.",
        "Q: Oh, terrific.",
        "A: And it sort of tells what things were like at that time -- his fear, his knowledge what\nwas going to happen.",
        "Q: Oh, that'd be great. Why don't you just take the time now.",
        "A: He wrote this to me about four months after I was born. It was called To Tana.",
        "Q: And that means?",
        "A: My name was Tana. When I came into your room, you stretched your little hands to\nthe bar of your crib. I heard a sweet quiet sigh. You felt free from the loneliness of your\nprison. You are still such a stranger in this world. In a sense nothing in the end is\nloneliness. What hatred, fury passion has done to us. You smiled and consoled so fast\nfrom your small grief. Oh put out love tied around your colorful rich world. Thank you\nfor all you have already given us -- memories of innocence, purity, and a life gone by.\nLife for ourselves has already vanished so long ago.",
        "Q: Beautiful.",
        "A: So he knew what was coming.",
        "Q: Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to make a copy of this.",
        "A: Oh, sure. I translated this from the German.",
        "Q: It's beautiful. So your early recollections were unfortunately just of wandering\nthrough the streets. Some early recollections of your father's love for you it sounds like.",
        "A: Playing with girlfriends -- German girlfriends. Really not knowing that this was out of\nthe ordinary the way life was.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Did your mother ever speak to you about your father in terms of that he\nhad been taken away\u201d?",
        "A: No, not that I remember at all. It was just one day he wasn't there. But, at age two\nand a half, I wouldn't have known the difference.",
        "Q: Sure. Yeah. Tell me what you recollect as you became an older child so to speak.",
        "A: You mean two, three -- and that's my recollections?",
        "Q: Four, five. Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Well, the main ones have to do with -- was the day that we were picked up. My\nmother was in forced labor, and I was playing, little non-Jewish girl, German girlfriend of\nmine -- in the dining room. And my mother came in, and she looked at my grandmother\nand my grandmother said, \"What are you doing home already\u201d? It's early.\" And then she\nsaw the SS man behind -- standing behind my mother. And my mother just said to my\nfriend, \"You have to go home now. Tana can't play with you anymore.\" And the little\ngirl didn't know why, but she left with this sort of look. And my mother and grandmother\njust looked at each other. My mother told me to go get my coat. I remember I grabbed\nmy teddy bear. And my mother, my grandmother hugged each other, and we just left and\nwe were put on a truck. But I had no idea where we were going, what was going on at\nthat time. It was just that I was being taken away from my playmate. And next thing I\nremember was we were 1n a place called Aranishe I was told afterwards. And.",
        "Q: You just spell that to the best you could.",
        "A: A-R-A-N-I-S-H-E. And there were a lot of buildings there. And I was separated.\nThat was the first time I separated from my mother. There were a bunch of kids. And\nthere were bunk beds. And I wasn't going to stay there. And I ran away couple of times.\nAnd the last time I did find my mother. And they allowed me to stay with her. It was\nactually a place -- a holding place -- until we were put on a train. We were there for\nabout four days or five days. I just remember being very very scared, because it was the\nfirst time I was really separated from my mother, and I was with all these children and I\ndidn't know anybody. And I was determined I was going to find her. And the next thing\nI really remember 1s being in Theresienstadt. My first recollections were walking with\nmy mother and it was a park and it had old swings and all of a sudden my mother\nscreamed. It was a lady walking with a blind man pushing a baby carriage. And my\nmother had met one of her earlier very best friends of all places that she had really lost\ncontact with. The gentleman was a first world war veteran also lost his eyesight in that\nwar. And so, he was sort of a national hero. That's why he went to Theresienstadt, not to\nAuschwitz or anywhere else. And my mother was overjoyed meeting these people. The\nlittle boy had been born there of all places. And I remember the camp -- the barracks.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Tell me about that.",
        "A: Lots and lots of people in dark barracks. The lice you could just take off the walls.\nFleas. Smells.",
        "Q: Describe the smells.",
        "A: Waste. Human waste. Just foul odors. You tried to open the door, but not much\nbetter outside.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: I remember being fed. We used to go outside. And they had these big barrels. And it\nwas filled with what they called \"soup.\" And, if you are at the beginning of the line, you\nget maybe a little meat or something. If you were at the end of the line, you just get the\nwater and a crust of bread would go with that. We used to save the crust of bread for a\ncouple of days as long as we could, because when it got hard, you could make it last\nlonger. So we'd eat it after a few days. My mother and I would sit together, and we just\neat little pieces at a time.",
        "Q: How often were you given these meals; was it just once a day?",
        "A: Once a day.",
        "Q: What -- midday, early day?",
        "A: Early day.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: I spent a lot of my time in a hospital there. I had every disease and every childhood\nillness that -- measles and mumps. Of course, with all these children there, you'd catch\nwhatever someone else had. I had intestinal infection twice -- it almost killed me. One\ntime I remember I needed a blood transfusion. And then they put my mother on one\ntable, put me on the other table and a tube went from her into me. Saved my life anyway.\nI remember that a lot of people, they didn't speak German, especially in the hospital -- the\nkids. There were not that many Germans there. And I was totally lost language-wise.\nWe -- when I wasn't sick, while my mother was doing various jobs there, we were\nallowed to attend a day camp, which was run by, you know, inmates, girls. And there we\nwere allowed to paint and draw pictures. We worked with little tiles. You know, a few\nlittle toys for us. But even there they made -- the Nazis made sure that we would be\nimpressed and would remember our experiences as small as we were. When the people\nwere brought in -- mainly the men were brought in from the outside, they were half\nstarved -- and this was Czechoslovakia. And this was December, this was winter, it\nsnows like Russian snows -- they would be taken off the carts. And these were skeleton\nof people. And they were going by outside the windows. And they would open the\ndrapes for us. And we were made to watch them move on until they dropped dead. And\nthis is -- I do remember this was something my mother never really knew that I knew --\nnever told us. This was something I actually do remember. They made sure -- people\nsay now, you know, \"How can you remember things when you were four years old?\" But\nthings like that you don't forget.",
        "Q: Now, were you in a separate barracks from your mother?",
        "A: No, I was together -- I was lucky I was together with my mother 1n the same barracks\nat the time, except when I was in the hospital.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And in terms of these -- when you say that these -- these men were taken\noff --",
        "A: They were just brought in --",
        "Q: -- from trains.",
        "A: -- from trains --",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: -- and they were just made to stand there. And this was before they had -- were\nbuilding the gas chambers there.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: So these people were sick already.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And they were half-starved. And, of course, they were freezing. And they were --\nthey were nude.",
        "Q: And they would just leave them out in the elements.",
        "A: They would just leave them out there. And we just -- they opened these big drapes.\nAnd we just -- we turned around and watched them.",
        "Q: Now, in terms of your actual living conditions in the barracks, were you -- did you\nshare a bed your mother, or shared a bunk with several other people?",
        "A: We had bunks. Bunks. They were three and three high, the bunks.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Did you always have the same place; do you remember?",
        "A: I imagine so. I would think so, yes. Because my mother used to talk about barrack\nnumber.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Did you have -- do you remember being able to keep any personal\npossessions there?",
        "A: My teddy bear. I still have my teddy bear.",
        "Q: You still have it?",
        "A: My teddy bear came home with me.",
        "Q: How do you -- just out of curiosity, how is it kept now?",
        "A: It's just on my bookshelf.",
        "Q: Oh, really. Okay.",
        "A: Couple of times I've had him fixed a little bit.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: I sent a few things to the museum. Money from Theresienstadt. Postcards that we --\nmy mother was allowed to send out, which were kind of a joke. And I was ready to send\nthe teddy bear, but I couldn't do it.",
        "Q: No, you don't want to do that. It's made it this far with you; it seems to me it doesn't\nleave your house.",
        "A: Right. Yes. Yes. And he still got the same -- my mother knitted me for Hanukkah\nthere over in the camp; she knitted me a little outfit for him. And he's still got that on\nhim.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Did you name your teddy bear by any chance?",
        "A: No, I did not.",
        "Q: Okay. Can you -- besides that the couple vignettes that you told me about the camp\nlife, is there anything else that sticks out in your mind -- any other people that you can\nrecall, you know, distinctly or relationships that you might have had or things that\nimpressed you?",
        "A: Mainly the couple that we met there, as I said -- he was blinded WWI and taken to\nTheresienstadt because he was sort of a war hero. And they were little careful about\nkilling these people right out. And his wife was a secretary to him. He was a lawyer --\nan attorney -- I mentioned that. And she was a secretary. When he came back and was\nblinded, they married. She was always a sickly person. And they tried very hard to have\nchildren; nothing ever happened. After they wound up in Theresienstadt, she became\npregnant. And my mother says that -- told me that friends -- so woman friends -- helped\nher have her child in secret there; otherwise, the child would have been killed.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And they were there for over three years. So they had been there a year -- two years\nbefore us already.",
        "Q: Do you know what their names are?",
        "A: Yes. Minnie and Fritz Simon.",
        "Q: S-I-M-O-N?",
        "A: Mm-hmm. And the son's name is Michael.",
        "Q: Do you know if he survived?",
        "A: They all survived. And last we heard of them, they were -- when we came over here -\n- her brother was a friend of my mother's also in Germany. He remained in Germany.\nAnd he gave us their address. And they wound up in Mt. Vernon, New York.",
        "Q: Okay. Hmm.",
        "A: We saw them several times even after I married. My husband met him. My children.\nMichael went on to become a doctor.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Frits went -- frits went back to Germany and remained there. And I -- we didn't hear\nthat she died, but I -- she must have died. And then last we heard of them, we went by to\ntheir wedding -- to Michael's wedding.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And then we lost track of the son.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. He would be about -- no, he'd be younger than you, I guess, right?\nBecause he was just a baby -- three or four years younger.",
        "A: He would be two years older than me.",
        "Q: No, that doesn't quite match.",
        "A: He was younger than me, I'm sorry, younger than me -- yes.",
        "Q: Because he was in the baby carriage and you were standing.",
        "A: Right. Right. Younger -- right. They were there two years more.",
        "Q: Right. So two to three years.",
        "A: Two to three years younger -- right.",
        "Q: What about the -- the Nazis at the camp; do you recall? Do you have any memories of\nwhat they were like besides forcing you to see those certain things?",
        "A: No. Really really not, because I came more into contact with -- in the children's camp,\nwith the inmates. And also in the hospital -- the doctors and nurses were also inmates.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The people in prison ;",
        "Q: Tell me about that --",
        "A: I do have a recollection -- go back to before we left Germany. A German officer -- he\nwas not an SS officer, but he was in the army. His name was Zimmerman. At that time\nmy mother had to take on a middle name, which was a Hebrew name -- Sarah --",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: -- which, of course, she wasn't used to, because she wasn't born with that name. And\nwhenever she had to go somewhere and sign her name, that name had to be included --",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: -- otherwise, 1t would mean instant death with deportation. Well, one time my mother\nhad to go somewhere and she had to sign some papers and she just forgot. She just put\nher regular name down. They caught her. It was an excuse to deport somebody.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: This Mr. Zimmerman was a friend of ours. He lived a couple of houses away from us\nin Berlin and had been bringing us a little food and was friendly with my mother -- well,\nmy grandmother. And he saw the papers on the desk that she was supposed to be picked\nup. And he took the papers, and he came to my house.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And he said, \"Look, Katsina[?], what you did -- stupid thing you did -- you didn't put\nyour name down, your Hebrew name.\" And my mother says, \"I just bluntly forgot. I just\nwanted to get out of there and forgot.\"",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And he said, \"This paper is out for you. These are the papers. They're official.\" And\nshe said, \"Well, that's what has to be.\" And he says, \"I can't do this.\" And he burned the\npapers.",
        "Q: Hmm.",
        "A: And they went out and killed him. And I remember him, because he was a very\nheavy-set man with a big mustache. I always cried. He picked me up, and he loved me\nto death. And I always screamed when he picked me up.",
        "Q: Did you hear from your mother that he had been killed, I guess, later?",
        "A: Yes, yes. From my grandmother, actually. When we came back from the camp, she\ntold us that she heard that he had been killed.",
        "Q: Now just digressing a little bit -- I guess your grandmother wasn't taken because --",
        "A: My grandmother was not taken, because she was born Protestant and converted. She\nwas 70 years old at the time. And they hadn't quite made up their mind what to do with\nher.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: I think the reason that we went so late was that -- also because my mother had been\nasked to come down to be measured. Her head was measured, her nose was measured to\nsee how much of her was Jewish and how much of her wasn't. So it took them a little\nlonger to take us, because they couldn't quite make up their mind where she belonged,\nbecause she didn't come from a Jewish mother --",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. So technically --",
        "A: -- technically.",
        "Q: Although the -- I guess the code back then was like 1/64th or something. I mean, it\ndidn't ;",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Just to finish up a little bit with Theresienstadt. Do you remember -- in other words,\noftentimes people tell us about the -- either the concerts or cultural events that they had.\nDo you remember any of that?",
        "A: No -- only from -- not myself. Only from what my mother said that the Red Cross\ncame in, and they spruced up the camp.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: The banks were opened. The cafes were opened.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Bakeries had food in them. Butcher shops had food in them. And, of course, it was\njust a big show.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: These were things that she told me. It was just for the Red Cross. I remember also\nmy mother said that the Red Cross questioned them and said, \"Well, how is life here?\"\nAnd, of course, they couldn't say too much, because there was always someone listening.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: So the answer they gave was, \"I must say it's not too bad.\" And that can be taken two\nways. And they hoped it would be picked up in the way that they said.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Back on around the second half, and we have two more, so --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: -- we're in pretty good shape.",
        "A: You had just asked if I knew what my mother did.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She had several jobs. One was working 1n the fields.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: She picked spinach. She picked rhubarb. She got that job. They asked if anybody\nhad any farming experience. And my mother was always outspoken, brazen, and kind of\ngutsy. If she wasn't gutsy, she wouldn't have made it through all this. She said, \"Oh sure\n-- | have farming experience.\"",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And someone said, \"Well, you came from Berlin; there's no farms there.\" And she\nsaid, \"Well, I grew flowers in my window at home.\"",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Whoever she was talking to had a sense of humor and figured she was young, she was\nstrong, and put her in the fields.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: They tried to steal spinach, put it in their underwear. And rhubarb. She fed the\nrhubarb to me once. She was overjoyed that she had some rhubarb. Well, with the\nintestinal problems I had, it almost killed me. But they tried to steal what they could out\nof the fields.",
        "Q: Do you remember eating some of the things from the fields?",
        "A: I remember the rhubarb, because I almost died right after that.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Another job she had was when the people came into the camp they had showers. And,\nas I said before, very few of the people spoke German.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And that was -- she didn't speak any other language. These were showers with water,\nbut these people didn't know that. They had heard about the gas chambers.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And they wanted to de-lice them, de-flea them before they came in. And she was one\nof the people that had to take these women into the showers. Of course, these people\nwere screaming and yelling thinking that they were going to their death.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Another job she had was separating belongings of people that had died there.\nAssembly-line type of work. The Nazis wanted any kind that was valuable -- jewelry.\nAnything at all that could be of use to them. And so, they had these boxes, which literally\nhad the ashes -- remains of the people in them, and they had to go through them. A lot of\ntimes the name on them would be somebody that somebody would recognize, a son or\ndaughter or husband.",
        "Q: Hmm. Just to backtrack a little bit, Mrs. Gelfer, I'd like to talk a little bit more about\nthe hospital. You said that it was staffed by inmates. Do you remember what, you know,\nphysically looked like -- the physical plant so to speak.",
        "A: Just barrack-type beddings. Very, very simple. Everything that was used there was\nchipped -- the bowls.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Nobody asked from facilities for buckets.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Somewhat less crowded than the barracks?",
        "A: Yes, but not -- single beds, not bunk-style beds --",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: -- that was the difference. Just children where I was.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. So you assume that there's a children's section?",
        "A: A children's section -- yes.",
        "Q: How many kids were in the --",
        "A: There were a lot I remember -- a lot. But I don't remember -- maybe say 100, 75 --",
        "Q: Do you remember being liberated from the camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about that?",
        "A: Yes, I remember that -- well, the background of it was that -- what my mother told me\nfirst before -- what I remember was that the night before they had posted a sign that we\nwere supposed to be gassed the next morning. They already had built the chambers. Let\nme just go back one more -- that just brings something else to mind.",
        "Q: Sure. Mm-hmm.",
        "A: When we first came in, \"Tana\" was a very popular name at that time. The children\nthat were born around 1939 -- '38, '39 -- the parents were not allowed to give them names\nof their choices.",
        "Q: Hmm.",
        "A: There was a list of names. They were horrendous names a lot of them. Abiga --\nwhich is Abigail here, which isn't too bad, but in German, it's the closest thing to a parrot,\nwhich is papagei. So these were not very nice names.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: So Tana was about the best. I guess there were about six or seven girl's names and\nboy's names. And the parents had to choose from the list.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: So \"Tana\" was a popular name of little girls at that time. We were brought into the\ncamp. We had to line up. And Kohn -- my mother used -- after my father was picked up,\nmy mother thought she can protect us a little better by using her name -- maiden name of\nKohn.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: That also, of course, was a very popular name. When we were brought in, we were\ntold to line up. And, if it wasn't a confusion, excitement, everything that was going on.\nThey knew that the names they were calling were the names that were not going to stay\nin Theresienstadt; they were going to go to Auschwitz or to one of the other camps. And\nmy mother just remembers \"Frau Kohn and child Tana.\" And my mother took me -- and\nI do remember she took me and pulled me forward. And a woman grabbed her by the\nsleeve and pulled her back and said, \"Didn't you hear the first name? That's me and my\ndaughter.\"",
        "Q: Hmm. And they stepped forward?",
        "A: They stepped forward.",
        "Q: Did you know at that point -- or did you later sense how important that was? I guess\nyou must have.",
        "A: Later on -- yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Well, anyway back to liberation. We were supposed to be gassed the following day,\nso. And, from what I understood later is that the next morning we were liberated.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: So it was a matter of hours. They kept us there for two weeks mainly to treat us --",
        "Q: When you say \"they,\" was it the Russians that --",
        "A: Russians. Clean us up -- get the lice out of the hair.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: I was so weak. I was so weak that I had to be trained how to walk at that time. I\ncouldn't walk under my own power. And we were just set free. They opened the gates,\nand we were set free. And the only place we knew where to go was back to Berlin.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: We walked for a while. We hitched a ride on a hay wagon. And I remember we\nstopped at a farm.",
        "Q: And this is you and your mother.",
        "A: Me and my mother, yes. My mother and I. We walked by a farm, and the farmer\ncame out. And he must have realized who we were, where we're coming from. And he\ninvited us in. And he gave me some goat milk. And I just remember my mother was so\nupset, because I wouldn't drink it. I just -- I just didn't like it, and I didn't drink it. And\nshe was so thrilled that I was going to get some nourishment.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And we mainly hitched rides until we got back to Berlin. And just continuous\nprocess. A lot of people did it. And a lot of people stopped to help.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And the next thing I really remember was we were in Berlin and it was a big indoor\nmarket -- about three, four blocks away from us -- and we were running. That's the first\nthing I remember --",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: -- because we used to shop there before. And I knew we were close to home. And my\ngrandmother had no knowledge of us that we were coming back.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: There was no way to get in touch with her. And she didn't know if we were dead or if\nwe were alive at that time. And we walked up to the apartment door. And my mother\npushed me ahead of her. She didn't know if this was going to kill my grandmother from\nshock or what was going to happen.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: She was in her 70's already. She rang the doorbell and stepped aside and just had me\nstanding there. My grandmother opened the door, she just saw me. Well, of course she\nwent hysterical from crying, but she also thought that my mother didn't make it. And\nthen my mother stepped forward. And I remember that. Crying.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And your grandmother had just basically lived at the same apartment and\nstayed there?",
        "A: Yes, she had stayed there. Yes, she had stayed there.",
        "Q: Now, when you moved back into your grandmother's apartment or your apartment,\nwhat did you -- what do you recall of those days?",
        "A: First thing my mother says, \"We got to get out of Germany as quickly as possible.\"\nAnd she just -- and the people, when we came back, all of a sudden the next door\nneighbors that have turned us in -- or someone who did turn us in probably before -- were\nour dearest friends, \"Oh, we're so glad you made it. We're so happy to see you. And so\nglad to have you back.\" And my mother said, \"That's it. We just have to get out of here.\"",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: So we put in for a reserve for displaced person to come to the United States. At that\ntime we had an option of going either to Israel or the United States. My grandmother\nwanted to go to Israel. She fought my mother all the way. And my mother had a friend\nfrom Berlin who had gone to Israel also with his daughter Tana.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And they had survived. The family had survived and went to Israel. And they wrote\nmy mother and said, \"Don't come. You're without a husband. You're going to be\nseparated from your daughter. You're going to have to work. Without a man you can't\nstart in a new country like this. Go to the United States instead.\" He was a doctor, and\nshe was a nurse.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And he said, \"We never see our Tana. We never see each other. We're working so\nhard to make a go of it. Don't come here.\" My mother made the decision to go to the\nUnited States.",
        "Q: While you were waiting for the visa --",
        "A: While I was waiting, I was sent by the Jewish Counsel to Switzerland for three months\nto basically get my strength back.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And I went there by myself. Jewish people in Switzerland near Bern -- I really don't\nrecall the name offhand of the town -- took me in.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And I lived with them four months and went to school there.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: [also did my first three years of public school being the only Jewish child in Berlin\nwhen I came back there.",
        "Q: You say you were the only Jewish child in Berlin?",
        "A: In my school in Berlin, I was the only one left.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. Mm-hmm.",
        "A: There just were figures in Theresienstadt. There were 15,000 children that entered and\nwent through that camp. And 100 of us walked out of there.",
        "Q: 100.",
        "A: 100 out of 15,000.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. After coming back from Switzerland, do you -- did you go back to school?\nI guess you said --",
        "A: I went back to school. Went to Switzerland '47, 1947, for three months and just went\nto school up to third grade in 1949.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Do you remember what school was like then? I mean, were kids\nunfriendly, friendly; was it pleasant, unpleasant?",
        "A: No. I was just different. They had religious training. And I went out in the courtyard\nand played by myself while they had religious training, because I was the only Jewish\nchild. But other than -- no, not really. I had friends. I had no problems at all. And it was\nin November -- end of October actually. We had six days to get ready to leave Germany.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Your mother -- what kind of work, or what did she do when she got back\nto Berlin?",
        "A: She worked for the town hall, the city hall. City hall. Town hall. I don't remember.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And when you got the notice that you were able to -- your visa had been\napproved, was it for the three of you -- your grandma as well?",
        "A: For the three of us, yes.",
        "Q: And how did you -- did you come straight to the United States?",
        "A: We came straight to the United States. We were supposed to come in to the port of\nNew York. We went by ship, got caught in a storm, and we were diverted into Boston.\nWe spent one night in Boston. Very very elemental. which we were. And then\nthey put us on a train to New York.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And we were met by someone from the Jewish Council in New York, and they had a\nroom waiting for us in New York.",
        "Q: When you say \"a room,\" what do you mean?",
        "A: A room 1n a private home.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: People rented a room to us. And it was the three of us 1n one room.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Do you remember much about that crossing or that ship?",
        "A: A lot of people getting very very sick. It was a battleship, not a luxury liner or\nanything. My mother was deathly sick. We were 350 people, and the room we were in,\nwe were in hammocks. Person on top would become ill, and everybody else would profit\nby it. What you became ill with, you had to clean up. There was no crew to do that for\nyou.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: The sailor's plate with oranges. And I never had even seen an orange, no less eaten\none. But because there were walls, we didn't get any of them. It was not a kind trip.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: First time I ate a banana, nobody told me you're supposed to peel them. And I was\nalmost 10 years old already. I never had a banana. So I bit into it. My grandmother was\nin a room with four, five people, because she was over 70.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And she was the least sick. But my mother was deathly sick in the crossing. They\nshowed us movies of what the United States was going to be like. I mean, it was gold-\npaved all over the streets. And we were going to all be very wealthy, taken care of.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. You said it was a battleship. Was it a --",
        "A: It was a navy -- navy ship.",
        "Q: U.S. navy, or do you know?",
        "A: U.S. navy.",
        "Q: Okay. Any other people that you knew from Berlin that came over?",
        "A: No. No one. No one.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. So it sailed from -- I guess Berlin is not a port, but whatever.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Okay. So you're in Newark in someone's home. You say you stay there for some time.",
        "A: We rented a room there.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: When we got here, the Jewish Council gave my mother -- I think it was $30 or $33\nand a newspaper to get ajob. So she didn't know the language, she spoke no English, and\nhad no training in anything really that she could do with our language, so she got a job as\na seamstress in a factory. She was also instructed to pay those $33 back as soon as\npossible.",
        "Q: Hmm.",
        "A: And I don't remember -- the rent wasn't that high, but it was by a German-Jewish\nfamily that had come here before the war.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And they rented rooms. They had a very large colonial house, and they rented rooms.\nAnd we had basically one bedroom in their home with kitchen privileges in the basement.\nAnd we lived there almost close to a year. They sold the house, and we moved with them\ninto their next house. So we stayed with these people for quite a while.",
        "Q: And, if you could, Mrs. Gelfer, just give me sort of a sketch of what your life was like\ndown the years after the war.",
        "A: Well, I went to -- like, when I came here, they put me into fifth grade. When I left\nGermany, I left in third grade not knowing a word of English.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: You had to either learn the language quickly, or you were going to be in the fifth\ngrade for a long time. So I caught on pretty quickly. I was a little hesitant at first to open\nmy mouth, because in the end I was different and I was afraid people were going to\nlaugh. But they weren't; they were very helpful. People even asked me to come over in\nthe evening and helped me study the language. My mother remarried in 1952. She\nworked for a baking company, and she met my stepfather there. And things got a little\nbit easier after that. We moved again into Irvington. I did most of my growing up in\nIrvington, New Jersey. Went to grammar school, high school there. My mother was able\nto buy their own house.",
        "Q: Your stepfather's name is or was?",
        "A: Archie Anklowitz. A-N-K-L-O-W-I-T-Z",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Did he have children of his own?",
        "A: No. No, he didn't have children. about eight years ago. And my mother died in\n1991.",
        "Q: So, after you went through American schools, did you end up going to high school, I\nguess, in Irvington, or?",
        "A: High school in Irvington, yes. Irvington High School.",
        "Q: Okay. And then what happened?",
        "A: And worked for an insurance company. And from there on to a title company. I\nworked with attorneys doing closings in the title company.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And then met my husband, Donald.",
        "Q: When did you guys get married?",
        "A: 1967 -- '66 -- I'm sorry.",
        "Q: And do you have any children?",
        "A: Yes. We have a daughter, 26 -- Karen. And a son, Steven, who's just about 24.",
        "Q: Good name.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And do you work with your daughter now?",
        "A: No, my daughter's in advertising. She's on her own. My son just graduated college.",
        "Q: What's he studying? What's he doing?",
        "A: He's working for a company doing computer work. And eventually he wants to go on\nto a -- he's going back to school to do a bit more learning on computer science.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. I bet he could figure out how to work this tape recorder. And what kind of\nwork are you doing now?",
        "A: Oh, I work for Sears & Roebuck.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And Mr. Gelfer, what kind of work do you do? Speaker H: I retired\nabout a year ago. About two years ago.",
        "A: From the post office.",
        "Q: All right. Let's go back, if we could, to your mother, which is obviously important\ninfluence and told you a lot of things about -- and again, this is -- I know we've sort of\ngone through some of it already, some of the things that she told you. Are there any other\nkinds of -- and, I guess, if we take them chronologically -- sort of high point -- not \"high\npoint\u2019, that's a terrible use of words. But, you know, anything -- kinds of experiences that\nyou remember she told you about that you'd like to share?",
        "A: Basically, what I've mentioned on here are the things that I remember her telling me.\nWhen we came back from the concentration camp and my mother was working in the\ncity hall, she met a young man. She was lonely. And they started to build a relationship.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: He was Hungarian, I believe. And he asked her to marry him. And he knew that my\nmother had put in a visa to come to the United States.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And he kept putting the marriage off and said, \"When you get your visa, we'll go\ntogether. We'll go together.\" And one day she got a letter to come down to fill out some\nmore forms -- some kind of formality. And she went down -- and I can't quite remember\nhow it was, but she was in the office and she had to put down how many people were\ngoing to come to the United States with her. And she put down \"and her fianc\u00e9,\" and put\ndown the person's name.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And the young man working behind the desk looked at the name and was kind of\nbewildered. And he said, \"Just a minute.\" He went out of the room, and he came back\nagain, and he said, \"I have something I have to tell you. I don't know how to put it. But\nthis man has been engaged several times to Jewish women who want to get out of the\ncountry. We're looking for him. He's one of the biggest Nazi war criminals. A man\ntrying to use women to get out of the country.\"",
        "Q: Did she -- was she able to give him his name?",
        "A: She did give him the name, but then she just -- she didn't say anything to him. She\njust broke it off with him. Luckily we were able to leave right -- soon after that.",
        "Q: Do you remember what his name was?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: That's all right.",
        "A: It's a real Hungarian name. I wouldn't remember his last name anyway.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. But you remember him -- I mean, you remember coming to the house, and",
        "A: Oh, yes -- Iremember him. Yes. Very charming.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And he wasn't the only one probably.",
        "A: No. No. And, of course, these women were very lonely. They were young women.\nVery vulnerable to emotions.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Did your mother tell you much as you got older about what she needed to\ndo to hide her identity in Berlin, you know, before you were taken to Theresienstadt?",
        "A: What do you mean by \"hide her identity?\"",
        "Q: Well, not so much --",
        "A: I mean, she had to wear the star.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: She wore that -- I mean, she had to wear that. She was in forced labor. So, when she\nwalked in, she kind of had that star on.",
        "Q: So basically she lived in -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, Mrs. Gelfer, but she lived in\nBerlin as a Jew. I mean, she was not.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. Well, everyone knew that she was a Jew. Her neighbors knew\nshe was a Jew.",
        "Q: I guess we're discussing now just a little about your mother's experience in Berlin, just\nin '38, '39 time period. But as you recall, she told you -- I mean, she had to do everything\nthat was required.",
        "A: She had to do everything. One time she told me that she went out, and she had to go\ndeliver something to her town hall. And there was a Nazi officer there. And she wasn't\nwearing her star. She was just -- she just said she had it. She wanted to use public\ntransportation to get there, and she took the star off. She didn't think she was going to get\nasked into the office. She thought she would just drop this off and turn around. Well,\nthey asked her to go in, and there was this big Nazi officer sitting there. And he looked at\nher, and he said -- started to question her -- and she got very nervous. And he said, he\nwas just ready to ask her, \"Aren't you a Jew?\" when the phone rang. And he got the\nmessage that they captured ten or 12 Jews and they were able to execute them, and he\nwas just delighted with that. My mother just ran for the hills -- just took off. Ran out of\nthere. He was so distracted by that. But other than that, she had to wear the star at all\ntimes. My grandmother didn't.",
        "Q: Grandmother did not.",
        "A: No, Grandmother did not.",
        "Q: Did you get -- you were taken to Theresienstadt what -- 1942, '43?",
        "A: No, I'm sorry, '44 -- September 1944, and we were released in June '45.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you have any sense, Mrs. Gelfer, how many Jews there were in Berlin in\n1944? I mean, I know you were really young, but did your mother sort of say \"There\nwere a lot of us around,\" or?",
        "A: No. No, not that I remember. I didn't even know what a Jew was at that time.",
        "Q: Yeah. Right. But I mean, from your mother's recollection, it just -- 1t seems --",
        "A: Only from what she told me that when she was younger the circle of friends she had,\npeople that she went to school with. She traveled -- not to sound snobbish, but she used\nto travel in artistic circle.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And college professors. And they were all literary people. Most of them were Jews.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And she lost track of all of them. Except for this one couple that I mentioned. We did\nmeet -- when we came over, one day we were walking in New York -- one of the main\nshopping streets going shopping, my mother and I. And this woman passed her and\nstopped, and she stopped. And they looked at each other and said, \"You look familiar.\"\nAnd it was a next, a friend or an acquaintance from Berlin that she really had lost total\ncontact with. And they met in the streets of New York of all places.",
        "Q: Hmm. Small world sometimes. It's kind of crazy.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you know how your grandmother was able to survive in Berlin while you guys\nwere gone?",
        "A: She had food stamps. Her sister's son was very helpful to her. He lived a couple\nblocks away.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And since he was Protestant, he had food. And there was even people in Germany at\nthat time. And he helped her out and watched over her, visited her and watched over her.",
        "Q: Now, these relatives -- the German relatives so to speak -- do you keep in touch with\nany of them?",
        "A: I call this person Uncle Julie. He's 10 years older than my mother. As I say, it was\nmy grandmother's sister's son. Being that much older than I, he became my Uncle Julie.\nWhen my mother established herself a little bit over here, she got a visa for him to come\nover. She had a job waiting for him. She did the same bakery, which was a large place\nwhere they make pies in case it wasn't a small bakery.",
        "Q: More commercial.",
        "A: Commercial type. Baking institution. And she got a visa and got him over. And then\nhis stepdaughter -- he had married this woman that was a bit younger who many times\nsaved me by just grabbing me at night when my mother would go over and say, \"They're\nlooking for us -- hide in one place. But it's Tana that they're really looking for.\" And she\nwalked with me endlessly -- blocks, whatever -- kept me in her house. And she had two\nchildren. And until it became very uncomfortable for her. Of course, her kids were blue-\neyed; they were blond, German-looking. Just the opposite of me. No way could I pass as\none of her children. And my mother finally said to her, \"Don't do this; you're going to get\nyourself into trouble. I won't allow it. You have two small children.\" And just Julie\nmarried this lady. She had two children from a previous marriage. Her husband was\nkilled in the war before that. And my mother brought him over. And then his\nstepdaughter. And then later on his son and his stepson. So they all came over. My\nmother slowly with visas brought them over.",
        "Q: And I assume that he's probably passed away.",
        "A: Yes, he's passed away. He's ten years older than my mother. Passed away. And his\nwife also passed away. I am still in contact with his son.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Who lives in New Jersey.",
        "A: Actually, his stepson too.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Yes, they're all in New Jersey.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. What about your father's family -- do you know anything?",
        "A: Nothing at all -- never heard about them. And my mother figured if his father would\nhave survived or his brother, they knew where we lived. We never moved away from\nGrimmstrasse, we would have thought they would have tried to get in touch with us. My\nmother tried to inquire several places and times and was never able to find out anything\nabout them.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. She had to assume they just didn't make it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The store that she had -- your mother had in Berlin -- the children's store.",
        "A: She ran it herself. My uncle -- Uncle Julie -- he at that time was also in the business\nof making pocketbooks. He was a fashion designer initially, but with the war went down\nthe drain. But he made pocketbooks and odds and ends like that. So he was able to get\nher materials to make the things. My grandmother made the panties and outfits in our\nhome. I remember sitting and snipping with scissors, kept me busy snipping them apart\nas she sewed them on the machine.",
        "Q: But it was owned -- I mean, it was one of the Jewish-owned businesses that was\nidentified as a Jewish-owned business; do you recall?",
        "A: No, she owned the store until it was destroyed.",
        "Q: Okay. Mm-hmm. Your mother did.",
        "A: Yes, because my grandfather had a will and the money he left in the will she used\ntowards that.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Basically, when we came back, the only people aside from the family, what there was\n-- a member that was there that remembered us and waited for us was -- when I\nmentioned before this family that met us in Theresienstadt -- Fritz Simon. Her brother\nsurvived. He was in Germany. He went into a mental institution and declared himself\ninsane to hide. And he spent three and a half years in a mental institution. And the only\none on to him was his nurse -- not a Jewish woman. And she kept his secret.\nUnfortunately, after three and a half years of living in a mental institution, his problems\nwere just unbelievable. He did come out. He did marry her. She stopped by him.",
        "Q: The nurse.",
        "A: The nurse. His whole emotional being was -- problems after a while. You don't live\namong insane people for that long.",
        "Q: Or fake to be insane.",
        "A: And fake to be insane.",
        "Q: Hmm. It's got to take its toll. I mean, it's obviously an act of desperation. Do you\nremember any actual physical abuse at Theresienstadt?",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: Okay. Just obviously deprivation -- no food --",
        "A: Just mental.",
        "Q: -- and seeing the violence, the hardship. Mr. Gelfer, you mention that there was 100\nsurvivors from Theresienstadt. Is that -- how did you know that? 100 survivors of\nchildren, I guess.",
        "A: It's a figure that's just been released into books. I have the book, \"I Never Saw\nAnother Butterfly,\" which I bought in the museum here, because my husband bought it\nfor me when we were here for the opening. Which is a book of paintings and poems by\nchildren who didn't survive. And the preface mentions also the figure. But how accurate\nthey are -- I know, but I always heard the same figure. It's always been 15,000 and 100\nsurvived. 15,000 that went through the camp at one time from the beginning to the end --\nnot that they were all there at the same time -- that went through. And most of them went\nto Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. At some point.",
        "A: So I guess records were kept, because it's always been the same record -- the same\nfigures.",
        "Q: Now, you say that people knew about the gas chambers -- about the gassing.",
        "A: That I heard from my mother the night before. And it was -- she says it was just\nhysteria.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: And disbelief that they were there so long they weren't going to make it. And, from\nwhat I heard is that the American Red Cross got word that this was going to be the end of\nthe camp and they were going to destroy this whole camp with everybody in it. They\ndidn't want -- they knew, I guess, that it was all coming to an end in '45. And they didn't\nwant any visible signs of this camp. Theresienstadt was a fortress at one time. Just\noutside of Prague, a small town in the countryside of Prague, and was used as an army\nfortress. And they were just going to get rid of it all totally so there was no signs of it.\nSo when this war 1s over and whoever -- Americans -- whoever came over, there would\nbe nothing left to say, \"Yes, there was something there at one time.\" And they had to do\nthis kind of quickly where it was this was going to be over pretty soon. And so, they had\nto act very quickly. And somehow the Red Cross got wind of this, and the Russians\ncame in.",
        "Q: Before that. Do you have any idea of why you were sent there to Theresienstadt?\nWhy you and your mother were sent there?",
        "A: My mother, as I said before, was born of a -- born Protestant mother and a Jewish\nfather. My grandmother converted when she married my grandfather. I think they were\ntreading very easy at that time. They didn't want to antagonize the Christians by having\ntoo many Christians killed. So my grandmother would say because of her age and she\nwasn't important as an old woman, 70-year-old woman, she wasn't going to do that much\nharm. My mother, they weren't quite sure yet where she fit in. She was not born of a\nJewish mother, which makes a difference. Like I said before, they measured her -- the\nnose, the head and neck. And they really -- it took them a while to say, \"Well, we're\ngoing to put you in a holding camp until we can figure out what we're going to do with\nthese mischling -- people who were of half breeds or not quite totally Jewish.\" There\nwere a lot of -- in Theresienstadt -- war heros, like Simon, whom they didn't want to kill\noff either. We don't want a big war hero from World War I, who got the congressional\nmedal of whatever in Germany and we wanted no -- a lot of writers out there, musicians.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: People that they were just going to hold for a while and then see what happens type of\nthing. They didn't want to leave them free, but they didn't want to send them to the death\ncamps right away. And also people like my mother that they couldn't decide quite how\nJewish she was at that time. I was lucky, because I was totally Jewish because -- well,\nalmost totally Jewish, because I have a Jewish father.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. But so it wasn't because of the fact that she was an actress, I guess.",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "Q: Yeah. It sounds more like the fact she was not Jewish.",
        "A: Yes, definitely. The rest was just.",
        "Q: All right. I think that's all I have.\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Q: And how about your mother -- was she employed?",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: And so, by 1939, was she still working at all, or was it basically impossible?",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And that would have been still the children's clothing store?",
        "Q: Okay. Now, let's start with, I guess, your father's family -- brothers, sisters that he\nhad.",
        "Q: And his sister's name was -- ?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Was it an older or younger brother?",
        "Q: Okay. Had you ever met his sister?",
        "Q: Okay. Do you know where she lived, or was she also in Berlin?",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Okay. Why don't you tell me what happened to your aunt, I guess.",
        "Q: And when was that approximately?",
        "Q: And that would have been in Germany.",
        "Q: And I mean, I know who you're talking about when you say \"they,\" but do you know\nspecifically it was the SS?",
        "Q: Yeah. And who told you that?",
        "Q: Sure. No, I understand. Sure. Now, was your father's family originally from\nGermany, or do you know how long they were --",
        "Q: Can you spell that for me?",
        "Q: Okay. And where is that in relation to Berlin, if you know?",
        "Q: How long had they been in Berlin, your parents, do you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: It was more than a note he delivered. Okay. Let's then go to your mother's family\nnow. Did she have brothers and sisters?",
        "Q: Okay. And her background was -- was she also German, or do you know where she\nwas from?",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Okay. And her father's name, can I ask you that?",
        "Q: And that would have been K-O.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, you're born in October of 1939, and I guess what we're going to do is\nrely a little bit on maybe your mother's recollection of this early period until you had your\nown recollections as a child. But do you know what kinds of circumstances you were\nliving in in Berlin at that time from your mother? Do you know if you're still 1n a house,\nan apartment, or?",
        "Q: Okay. This is on your paternal or --",
        "Q: Okay. So your maternal grandmother basically converted. And what was her religion\nbefore?",
        "Q: Protestant. Okay. All right. So the circumstances you were living in.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: I see. Tell me about a little bit -- and I'm sorry we're backtracking Mrs. Gelfer, but\nthis is interesting. Tell me a little bit about her career as an actress -- what you know\nabout it.",
        "Q: And did she use her name Johanna?",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Okay. Do you have any memorabilia from that time period or anything?",
        "Q: And that would have been on her side.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Okay. So she owned her children's store.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And this was in Berlin.",
        "Q: When was she born; do you know\u201d?",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. Back -- going back now to 1939 time period when you were first born,\nwere you living in an apartment -- just the three of you -- or do you know?",
        "Q: And that would have been her mother -- your mother's mother.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. So, as far as you know, you lived in the same place.",
        "Q: Okay. From 1939 to --",
        "Q: Okay. Ten years later. All right. What are your first recollections as a child?",
        "Q: Do you know now?",

        "Q: I see. Now, once your father was taken away, was it just then the three of you in the\nhouse?",
        "Q: Now, what I think I'll do, Ms. Gelfer, just a little bit easier, I'm going to go through\nyour recollections first from your childhood to the time you were liberated essentially to\nalmost the present. And then what I'd like to do is go back and sort of I'll put you in the\nshoes of your mother in a sense and have you recollect what she has told you about that.\nI think that will be probably a easier way to do it as opposed to skipping back and forth.",

        "Q: Mm-hmm. Did you always have the same place; do you remember?",

        "Q: Mm-hmm. So technically --",
        "Q: Although the -- I guess the code back then was like 1/64th or something. I mean, it\ndidn't ;",
        "Q: Just to finish up a little bit with Theresienstadt. Do you remember -- in other words,\noftentimes people tell us about the -- either the concerts or cultural events that they had.\nDo you remember any of that?",

Let's go back, if we could, to your mother, which is obviously important\ninfluence and told you a lot of things about -- and again, this is -- I know we've sort of\ngone through some of it already, some of the things that she told you. Are there any other\nkinds of -- and, I guess, if we take them chronologically -- sort of high point -- not \"high\npoint\u2019, that's a terrible use of words. But, you know, anything -- kinds of experiences that\nyou remember she told you about that you'd like to share?",

        "Q: So basically she lived in -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, Mrs. Gelfer, but she lived in\nBerlin as a Jew. I mean, she was not.",
        "Q: I guess we're discussing now just a little about your mother's experience in Berlin, just\nin '38, '39 time period. But as you recall, she told you -- I mean, she had to do everything\nthat was required.",
        "Q: Grandmother did not.",
        "Q: Did you get -- you were taken to Theresienstadt what -- 1942, '43?",
        "Q: Okay. Do you have any sense, Mrs. Gelfer, how many Jews there were in Berlin in\n1944? I mean, I know you were really young, but did your mother sort of say \"There\nwere a lot of us around,\" or?",
        "Q: Yeah. Right. But I mean, from your mother's recollection, it just -- 1t seems --",

        "Q: The store that she had -- your mother had in Berlin -- the children's store.",
        "Q: But it was owned -- I mean, it was one of the Jewish-owned businesses that was\nidentified as a Jewish-owned business; do you recall?",
        "Q: Okay. Mm-hmm. Your mother did.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: The nurse.",
        "Q: Or fake to be insane.",
        "Q: Hmm. It's got to take its toll. I mean, it's obviously an act of desperation. Do you\nremember any actual physical abuse at Theresienstadt?",
        "Q: Okay. Just obviously deprivation -- no food --",
        "Q: -- and seeing the violence, the hardship. Mr. Gelfer, you mention that there was 100\nsurvivors from Theresienstadt. Is that -- how did you know that? 100 survivors of\nchildren, I guess.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. At some point.",
        "Q: Now, you say that people knew about the gas chambers -- about the gassing.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: Before that. Do you have any idea of why you were sent there to Theresienstadt?\nWhy you and your mother were sent there?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. But so it wasn't because of the fact that she was an actress, I guess.",
        "Q: Yeah. It sounds more like the fact she was not Jewish.",

        "A: -- 1949.",
        "A: First recollections, I would say, would be wandering around streets with my\ngrandmother not knowing the reason why really. Days and nights. I also had an aunt that\nwas really not an aunt; it was just a very close friend of a cousin and later his wife who\nprotected us. And she would pick me up and walk me in parks and streets. And I really\nhad no idea why I was doing this.",
        "A: Yes, of course. That was just to hide me.",

You are still such a stranger in this world. In a sense nothing in the end is\nloneliness. What hatred, fury passion has done to us. You smiled and consoled so fast\nfrom your small grief. Oh put out love tied around your colorful rich world. Thank you\nfor all you have already given us -- memories of innocence, purity, and a life gone by.\nLife for ourselves has already vanished so long ago.",
        "A: So he knew what was coming.",
        "A: Oh, sure. I translated this from the German.",
        "A: Playing with girlfriends -- German girlfriends. Really not knowing that this was out of\nthe ordinary the way life was.",

        "A: You mean two, three -- and that's my recollections?",
        "A: Well, the main ones have to do with -- was the day that we were picked up. My\nmother was in forced labor, and I was playing, little non-Jewish girl, German girlfriend of\nmine -- in the dining room. And my mother came in, and she looked at my grandmother\nand my grandmother said, \"What are you doing home already\u201d? It's early.\" And then she\nsaw the SS man behind -- standing behind my mother. And my mother just said to my\nfriend, \"You have to go home now. Tana can't play with you anymore.\" And the little\ngirl didn't know why, but she left with this sort of look. And my mother and grandmother\njust looked at each other. My mother told me to go get my coat. I remember I grabbed\nmy teddy bear. And my mother, my grandmother hugged each other, and we just left and\nwe were put on a truck. But I had no idea where we were going, what was going on at\nthat time. It was just that I was being taken away from my playmate. And next thing I\nremember was we were 1n a place called Aranishe I was told afterwards. And.",
        "A: A-R-A-N-I-S-H-E. And there were a lot of buildings there. And I was separated.\nThat was the first time I separated from my mother. There were a bunch of kids. And\nthere were bunk beds. And I wasn't going to stay there. And I ran away couple of times.\nAnd the last time I did find my mother. And they allowed me to stay with her. It was\nactually a place -- a holding place -- until we were put on a train. We were there for\nabout four days or five days. I just remember being very very scared, because it was the\nfirst time I was really separated from my mother, and I was with all these children and I\ndidn't know anybody. And I was determined I was going to find her. And the next thing\nI really remember 1s being in Theresienstadt. My first recollections were walking with\nmy mother and it was a park and it had old swings and all of a sudden my mother\nscreamed. It was a lady walking with a blind man pushing a baby carriage. And my\nmother had met one of her earlier very best friends of all places that she had really lost\ncontact with. The gentleman was a first world war veteran also lost his eyesight in that\nwar. And so, he was sort of a national hero. That's why he went to Theresienstadt, not to\nAuschwitz or anywhere else. And my mother was overjoyed meeting these people. The\nlittle boy had been born there of all places. And I remember the camp -- the barracks.",
        "A: Lots and lots of people in dark barracks. The lice you could just take off the walls.\nFleas. Smells.",
        "A: Waste. Human waste. Just foul odors. You tried to open the door, but not much\nbetter outside.",
        "A: I remember being fed. We used to go outside. And they had these big barrels. And it\nwas filled with what they called \"soup.\" And, if you are at the beginning of the line, you\nget maybe a little meat or something. If you were at the end of the line, you just get the\nwater and a crust of bread would go with that. We used to save the crust of bread for a\ncouple of days as long as we could, because when it got hard, you could make it last\nlonger. So we'd eat it after a few days. My mother and I would sit together, and we just\neat little pieces at a time.",
        "A: Once a day.",
        "A: Early day.",
        "A: I spent a lot of my time in a hospital there. I had every disease and every childhood\nillness that -- measles and mumps. Of course, with all these children there, you'd catch\nwhatever someone else had. I had intestinal infection twice -- it almost killed me. One\ntime I remember I needed a blood transfusion. And then they put my mother on one\ntable, put me on the other table and a tube went from her into me. Saved my life anyway.\nI remember that a lot of people, they didn't speak German, especially in the hospital -- the\nkids. There were not that many Germans there. And I was totally lost language-wise.\nWe -- when I wasn't sick, while my mother was doing various jobs there, we were\nallowed to attend a day camp, which was run by, you know, inmates, girls. And there we\nwere allowed to paint and draw pictures. We worked with little tiles. You know, a few\nlittle toys for us. But even there they made -- the Nazis made sure that we would be\nimpressed and would remember our experiences as small as we were. When the people\nwere brought in -- mainly the men were brought in from the outside, they were half\nstarved -- and this was Czechoslovakia. And this was December, this was winter, it\nsnows like Russian snows -- they would be taken off the carts. And these were skeleton\nof people. And they were going by outside the windows. And they would open the\ndrapes for us. And we were made to watch them move on until they dropped dead. And\nthis is -- I do remember this was something my mother never really knew that I knew --\nnever told us. This was something I actually do remember. They made sure -- people\nsay now, you know, \"How can you remember things when you were four years old?\" But\nthings like that you don't forget.",
        "A: No, I was together -- I was lucky I was together with my mother 1n the same barracks\nat the time, except when I was in the hospital.",
        "A: They were just brought in --",
        "A: -- from trains --",
        "A: -- and they were just made to stand there. And this was before they had -- were\nbuilding the gas chambers there.",
        "A: So these people were sick already.",
        "A: And they were half-starved. And, of course, they were freezing. And they were --\nthey were nude.",
        "A: They would just leave them out there. And we just -- they opened these big drapes.\nAnd we just -- we turned around and watched them.",
        "A: We had bunks. Bunks. They were three and three high, the bunks.",
        "A: I imagine so. I would think so, yes. Because my mother used to talk about barrack\nnumber.",

        "A: It's just on my bookshelf.",
        "A: Couple of times I've had him fixed a little bit.",
        "A: I sent a few things to the museum. Money from Theresienstadt. Postcards that we --\nmy mother was allowed to send out, which were kind of a joke. And I was ready to send\nthe teddy bear, but I couldn't do it.",
        "A: Right. Yes. Yes. And he still got the same -- my mother knitted me for Hanukkah\nthere over in the camp; she knitted me a little outfit for him. And he's still got that on\nhim.",
        "A: No, I did not.",
        "A: Mainly the couple that we met there, as I said -- he was blinded WWI and taken to\nTheresienstadt because he was sort of a war hero. And they were little careful about\nkilling these people right out. And his wife was a secretary to him. He was a lawyer --\nan attorney -- I mentioned that. And she was a secretary. When he came back and was\nblinded, they married. She was always a sickly person. And they tried very hard to have\nchildren; nothing ever happened. After they wound up in Theresienstadt, she became\npregnant. And my mother says that -- told me that friends -- so woman friends -- helped\nher have her child in secret there; otherwise, the child would have been killed.",
        "A: And they were there for over three years. So they had been there a year -- two years\nbefore us already.",
        "A: Yes. Minnie and Fritz Simon.",
        "A: Mm-hmm. And the son's name is Michael.",
        "A: They all survived. And last we heard of them, they were -- when we came over here -\n- her brother was a friend of my mother's also in Germany. He remained in Germany.\nAnd he gave us their address. And they wound up in Mt. Vernon, New York.",
        "A: We saw them several times even after I married. My husband met him. My children.\nMichael went on to become a doctor.",
        "A: Frits went -- frits went back to Germany and remained there. And I -- we didn't hear\nthat she died, but I -- she must have died. And then last we heard of them, we went by to\ntheir wedding -- to Michael's wedding.",
        "A: And then we lost track of the son.",
        "A: He would be two years older than me.",
        "A: He was younger than me, I'm sorry, younger than me -- yes.",
        "A: Right. Right. Younger -- right. They were there two years more.",
        "A: Two to three years younger -- right.",
        "A: No. Really really not, because I came more into contact with -- in the children's camp,\nwith the inmates. And also in the hospital -- the doctors and nurses were also inmates.",
        "A: The people in prison ;",
        "A: I do have a recollection -- go back to before we left Germany. A German officer -- he\nwas not an SS officer, but he was in the army. His name was Zimmerman. At that time\nmy mother had to take on a middle name, which was a Hebrew name -- Sarah --",
        "A: -- which, of course, she wasn't used to, because she wasn't born with that name. And\nwhenever she had to go somewhere and sign her name, that name had to be included --",
        "A: -- otherwise, 1t would mean instant death with deportation. Well, one time my mother\nhad to go somewhere and she had to sign some papers and she just forgot. She just put\nher regular name down. They caught her. It was an excuse to deport somebody.",
        "A: This Mr. Zimmerman was a friend of ours. He lived a couple of houses away from us\nin Berlin and had been bringing us a little food and was friendly with my mother -- well,\nmy grandmother. And he saw the papers on the desk that she was supposed to be picked\nup. And he took the papers, and he came to my house.",
        "A: And he said, \"Look, Katsina[?], what you did -- stupid thing you did -- you didn't put\nyour name down, your Hebrew name.\" And my mother says, \"I just bluntly forgot. I just\nwanted to get out of there and forgot.\"",
        "A: And he said, \"This paper is out for you. These are the papers. They're official.\" And\nshe said, \"Well, that's what has to be.\" And he says, \"I can't do this.\" And he burned the\npapers.",
        "A: And they went out and killed him. And I remember him, because he was a very\nheavy-set man with a big mustache. I always cried. He picked me up, and he loved me\nto death. And I always screamed when he picked me up.",
        "A: Yes, yes. From my grandmother, actually. When we came back from the camp, she\ntold us that she heard that he had been killed.",
        "A: My grandmother was not taken, because she was born Protestant and converted. She\nwas 70 years old at the time. And they hadn't quite made up their mind what to do with\nher.",
        "A: I think the reason that we went so late was that -- also because my mother had been\nasked to come down to be measured. Her head was measured, her nose was measured to\nsee how much of her was Jewish and how much of her wasn't. So it took them a little\nlonger to take us, because they couldn't quite make up their mind where she belonged,\nbecause she didn't come from a Jewish mother --",
        "A: -- technically.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No -- only from -- not myself. Only from what my mother said that the Red Cross\ncame in, and they spruced up the camp.",
        "A: The banks were opened. The cafes were opened.",
        "A: Bakeries had food in them. Butcher shops had food in them. And, of course, it was\njust a big show.",
        "A: These were things that she told me. It was just for the Red Cross. I remember also\nmy mother said that the Red Cross questioned them and said, \"Well, how is life here?\"\nAnd, of course, they couldn't say too much, because there was always someone listening.",
        "A: So the answer they gave was, \"I must say it's not too bad.\" And that can be taken two\nways. And they hoped it would be picked up in the way that they said.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: You had just asked if I knew what my mother did.",
        "A: She had several jobs. One was working 1n the fields.",
        "A: She picked spinach. She picked rhubarb. She got that job. They asked if anybody\nhad any farming experience. And my mother was always outspoken, brazen, and kind of\ngutsy. If she wasn't gutsy, she wouldn't have made it through all this. She said, \"Oh sure\n-- | have farming experience.\"",
        "A: And someone said, \"Well, you came from Berlin; there's no farms there.\" And she\nsaid, \"Well, I grew flowers in my window at home.\"",
        "A: Whoever she was talking to had a sense of humor and figured she was young, she was\nstrong, and put her in the fields.",
        "A: They tried to steal spinach, put it in their underwear. And rhubarb. She fed the\nrhubarb to me once. She was overjoyed that she had some rhubarb. Well, with the\nintestinal problems I had, it almost killed me. But they tried to steal what they could out\nof the fields.",
        "A: I remember the rhubarb, because I almost died right after that.",
        "A: Another job she had was when the people came into the camp they had showers. And,\nas I said before, very few of the people spoke German.",
        "A: And that was -- she didn't speak any other language. These were showers with water,\nbut these people didn't know that. They had heard about the gas chambers.",
        "A: And they wanted to de-lice them, de-flea them before they came in. And she was one\nof the people that had to take these women into the showers. Of course, these people\nwere screaming and yelling thinking that they were going to their death.",
        "A: Another job she had was separating belongings of people that had died there.\nAssembly-line type of work. The Nazis wanted any kind that was valuable -- jewelry.\nAnything at all that could be of use to them. And so, they had these boxes, which literally\nhad the ashes -- remains of the people in them, and they had to go through them. A lot of\ntimes the name on them would be somebody that somebody would recognize, a son or\ndaughter or husband.",
        "A: Just barrack-type beddings. Very, very simple. Everything that was used there was\nchipped -- the bowls.",
        "A: Nobody asked from facilities for buckets.",
        "A: Yes, but not -- single beds, not bunk-style beds --",
        "A: -- that was the difference. Just children where I was.",
        "A: A children's section -- yes.",
        "A: There were a lot I remember -- a lot. But I don't remember -- maybe say 100, 75 --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I remember that -- well, the background of it was that -- what my mother told me\nfirst before -- what I remember was that the night before they had posted a sign that we\nwere supposed to be gassed the next morning. They already had built the chambers. Let\nme just go back one more -- that just brings something else to mind.",
        "A: When we first came in, \"Tana\" was a very popular name at that time. The children\nthat were born around 1939 -- '38, '39 -- the parents were not allowed to give them names\nof their choices.",
        "A: There was a list of names. They were horrendous names a lot of them. Abiga --\nwhich is Abigail here, which isn't too bad, but in German, it's the closest thing to a parrot,\nwhich is papagei. So these were not very nice names.",
        "A: So Tana was about the best. I guess there were about six or seven girl's names and\nboy's names. And the parents had to choose from the list.",
        "A: So \"Tana\" was a popular name of little girls at that time. We were brought into the\ncamp. We had to line up. And Kohn -- my mother used -- after my father was picked up,\nmy mother thought she can protect us a little better by using her name -- maiden name of\nKohn.",
        "A: That also, of course, was a very popular name. When we were brought in, we were\ntold to line up. And, if it wasn't a confusion, excitement, everything that was going on.\nThey knew that the names they were calling were the names that were not going to stay\nin Theresienstadt; they were going to go to Auschwitz or to one of the other camps. And\nmy mother just remembers \"Frau Kohn and child Tana.\" And my mother took me -- and\nI do remember she took me and pulled me forward. And a woman grabbed her by the\nsleeve and pulled her back and said, \"Didn't you hear the first name? That's me and my\ndaughter.\"",
        "A: They stepped forward.",
        "A: Later on -- yeah.",
        "A: Well, anyway back to liberation. We were supposed to be gassed the following day,\nso. And, from what I understood later is that the next morning we were liberated.",
        "A: So it was a matter of hours. They kept us there for two weeks mainly to treat us --",
        "A: Russians. Clean us up -- get the lice out of the hair.",
        "A: I was so weak. I was so weak that I had to be trained how to walk at that time. I\ncouldn't walk under my own power. And we were just set free. They opened the gates,\nand we were set free. And the only place we knew where to go was back to Berlin.",
        "A: We walked for a while. We hitched a ride on a hay wagon. And I remember we\nstopped at a farm.",
        "A: Me and my mother, yes. My mother and I. We walked by a farm, and the farmer\ncame out. And he must have realized who we were, where we're coming from. And he\ninvited us in. And he gave me some goat milk. And I just remember my mother was so\nupset, because I wouldn't drink it. I just -- I just didn't like it, and I didn't drink it. And\nshe was so thrilled that I was going to get some nourishment.",
        "A: And we mainly hitched rides until we got back to Berlin. And just continuous\nprocess. A lot of people did it. And a lot of people stopped to help.",
        "A: And the next thing I really remember was we were in Berlin and it was a big indoor\nmarket -- about three, four blocks away from us -- and we were running. That's the first\nthing I remember --",
        "A: -- because we used to shop there before. And I knew we were close to home. And my\ngrandmother had no knowledge of us that we were coming back.",
        "A: There was no way to get in touch with her. And she didn't know if we were dead or if\nwe were alive at that time. And we walked up to the apartment door. And my mother\npushed me ahead of her. She didn't know if this was going to kill my grandmother from\nshock or what was going to happen.",
        "A: She was in her 70's already. She rang the doorbell and stepped aside and just had me\nstanding there. My grandmother opened the door, she just saw me. Well, of course she\nwent hysterical from crying, but she also thought that my mother didn't make it. And\nthen my mother stepped forward. And I remember that. Crying.",
        "A: Yes, she had stayed there. Yes, she had stayed there.",
        "A: First thing my mother says, \"We got to get out of Germany as quickly as possible.\"\nAnd she just -- and the people, when we came back, all of a sudden the next door\nneighbors that have turned us in -- or someone who did turn us in probably before -- were\nour dearest friends, \"Oh, we're so glad you made it. We're so happy to see you. And so\nglad to have you back.\" And my mother said, \"That's it. We just have to get out of here.\"",
        "A: So we put in for a reserve for displaced person to come to the United States. At that\ntime we had an option of going either to Israel or the United States. My grandmother\nwanted to go to Israel. She fought my mother all the way. And my mother had a friend\nfrom Berlin who had gone to Israel also with his daughter Tana.",
        "A: And they had survived. The family had survived and went to Israel. And they wrote\nmy mother and said, \"Don't come. You're without a husband. You're going to be\nseparated from your daughter. You're going to have to work. Without a man you can't\nstart in a new country like this. Go to the United States instead.\" He was a doctor, and\nshe was a nurse.",
        "A: And he said, \"We never see our Tana. We never see each other. We're working so\nhard to make a go of it. Don't come here.\" My mother made the decision to go to the\nUnited States.",
        "A: While I was waiting, I was sent by the Jewish Counsel to Switzerland for three months\nto basically get my strength back.",
        "A: And I went there by myself. Jewish people in Switzerland near Bern -- I really don't\nrecall the name offhand of the town -- took me in.",
        "A: And I lived with them four months and went to school there.",
        "A: [also did my first three years of public school being the only Jewish child in Berlin\nwhen I came back there.",
        "A: In my school in Berlin, I was the only one left.",
        "A: There just were figures in Theresienstadt. There were 15,000 children that entered and\nwent through that camp. And 100 of us walked out of there.",
        "A: 100 out of 15,000.",
        "A: I went back to school. Went to Switzerland '47, 1947, for three months and just went\nto school up to third grade in 1949.",
        "A: No. I was just different. They had religious training. And I went out in the courtyard\nand played by myself while they had religious training, because I was the only Jewish\nchild. But other than -- no, not really. I had friends. I had no problems at all. And it was\nin November -- end of October actually. We had six days to get ready to leave Germany.",
        "A: She worked for the town hall, the city hall. City hall. Town hall. I don't remember.",
        "A: For the three of us, yes.",
        "A: We came straight to the United States. We were supposed to come in to the port of\nNew York. We went by ship, got caught in a storm, and we were diverted into Boston.\nWe spent one night in Boston. Very very elemental. which we were. And then\nthey put us on a train to New York.",
        "A: And we were met by someone from the Jewish Council in New York, and they had a\nroom waiting for us in New York.",
        "A: A room 1n a private home.",
        "A: People rented a room to us. And it was the three of us 1n one room.",
        "A: A lot of people getting very very sick. It was a battleship, not a luxury liner or\nanything. My mother was deathly sick. We were 350 people, and the room we were in,\nwe were in hammocks. Person on top would become ill, and everybody else would profit\nby it. What you became ill with, you had to clean up. There was no crew to do that for\nyou.",
        "A: The sailor's plate with oranges. And I never had even seen an orange, no less eaten\none. But because there were walls, we didn't get any of them. It was not a kind trip.",
        "A: First time I ate a banana, nobody told me you're supposed to peel them. And I was\nalmost 10 years old already. I never had a banana. So I bit into it. My grandmother was\nin a room with four, five people, because she was over 70.",
        "A: And she was the least sick. But my mother was deathly sick in the crossing. They\nshowed us movies of what the United States was going to be like. I mean, it was gold-\npaved all over the streets. And we were going to all be very wealthy, taken care of.",
        "A: It was a navy -- navy ship.",
        "A: U.S. navy.",
        "A: No. No one. No one.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: We rented a room there.",
        "A: When we got here, the Jewish Council gave my mother -- I think it was $30 or $33\nand a newspaper to get ajob. So she didn't know the language, she spoke no English, and\nhad no training in anything really that she could do with our language, so she got a job as\na seamstress in a factory. She was also instructed to pay those $33 back as soon as\npossible.",
        "A: And I don't remember -- the rent wasn't that high, but it was by a German-Jewish\nfamily that had come here before the war.",
        "A: And they rented rooms. They had a very large colonial house, and they rented rooms.\nAnd we had basically one bedroom in their home with kitchen privileges in the basement.\nAnd we lived there almost close to a year. They sold the house, and we moved with them\ninto their next house. So we stayed with these people for quite a while.",
        "A: Well, I went to -- like, when I came here, they put me into fifth grade. When I left\nGermany, I left in third grade not knowing a word of English.",
        "A: You had to either learn the language quickly, or you were going to be in the fifth\ngrade for a long time. So I caught on pretty quickly. I was a little hesitant at first to open\nmy mouth, because in the end I was different and I was afraid people were going to\nlaugh. But they weren't; they were very helpful. People even asked me to come over in\nthe evening and helped me study the language. My mother remarried in 1952. She\nworked for a baking company, and she met my stepfather there. And things got a little\nbit easier after that. We moved again into Irvington. I did most of my growing up in\nIrvington, New Jersey. Went to grammar school, high school there. My mother was able\nto buy their own house.",
        "A: Archie Anklowitz. A-N-K-L-O-W-I-T-Z",
        "A: No. No, he didn't have children. about eight years ago. And my mother died in\n1991.",
        "A: High school in Irvington, yes. Irvington High School.",
        "A: And worked for an insurance company. And from there on to a title company. I\nworked with attorneys doing closings in the title company.",
        "A: And then met my husband, Donald.",
        "A: 1967 -- '66 -- I'm sorry.",
        "A: Yes. We have a daughter, 26 -- Karen. And a son, Steven, who's just about 24.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, my daughter's in advertising. She's on her own. My son just graduated college.",
        "A: He's working for a company doing computer work. And eventually he wants to go on\nto a -- he's going back to school to do a bit more learning on computer science.",
        "A: Oh, I work for Sears & Roebuck.",
        "A: From the post office.",
        "A: Basically, what I've mentioned on here are the things that I remember her telling me.\nWhen we came back from the concentration camp and my mother was working in the\ncity hall, she met a young man. She was lonely. And they started to build a relationship.",
        "A: He was Hungarian, I believe. And he asked her to marry him. And he knew that my\nmother had put in a visa to come to the United States.",
        "A: And he kept putting the marriage off and said, \"When you get your visa, we'll go\ntogether. We'll go together.\" And one day she got a letter to come down to fill out some\nmore forms -- some kind of formality. And she went down -- and I can't quite remember\nhow it was, but she was in the office and she had to put down how many people were\ngoing to come to the United States with her. And she put down \"and her fianc\u00e9,\" and put\ndown the person's name.",
        "A: And the young man working behind the desk looked at the name and was kind of\nbewildered. And he said, \"Just a minute.\" He went out of the room, and he came back\nagain, and he said, \"I have something I have to tell you. I don't know how to put it. But\nthis man has been engaged several times to Jewish women who want to get out of the\ncountry. We're looking for him. He's one of the biggest Nazi war criminals. A man\ntrying to use women to get out of the country.\"",
        "A: She did give him the name, but then she just -- she didn't say anything to him. She\njust broke it off with him. Luckily we were able to leave right -- soon after that.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It's a real Hungarian name. I wouldn't remember his last name anyway.",
        "A: Oh, yes -- Iremember him. Yes. Very charming.",
        "A: No. No. And, of course, these women were very lonely. They were young women.\nVery vulnerable to emotions.",
        "A: What do you mean by \"hide her identity?\"",
        "A: I mean, she had to wear the star.",
        "A: She wore that -- I mean, she had to wear that. She was in forced labor. So, when she\nwalked in, she kind of had that star on.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. Well, everyone knew that she was a Jew. Her neighbors knew\nshe was a Jew.",
        "A: She had to do everything. One time she told me that she went out, and she had to go\ndeliver something to her town hall. And there was a Nazi officer there. And she wasn't\nwearing her star. She was just -- she just said she had it. She wanted to use public\ntransportation to get there, and she took the star off. She didn't think she was going to get\nasked into the office. She thought she would just drop this off and turn around. Well,\nthey asked her to go in, and there was this big Nazi officer sitting there. And he looked at\nher, and he said -- started to question her -- and she got very nervous. And he said, he\nwas just ready to ask her, \"Aren't you a Jew?\" when the phone rang. And he got the\nmessage that they captured ten or 12 Jews and they were able to execute them, and he\nwas just delighted with that. My mother just ran for the hills -- just took off. Ran out of\nthere. He was so distracted by that. But other than that, she had to wear the star at all\ntimes. My grandmother didn't.",
        "A: No, Grandmother did not.",
        "A: No, I'm sorry, '44 -- September 1944, and we were released in June '45.",
        "A: No. No, not that I remember. I didn't even know what a Jew was at that time.",
        "A: Only from what she told me that when she was younger the circle of friends she had,\npeople that she went to school with. She traveled -- not to sound snobbish, but she used\nto travel in artistic circle.",
        "A: And college professors. And they were all literary people. Most of them were Jews.",
        "A: And she lost track of all of them. Except for this one couple that I mentioned. We did\nmeet -- when we came over, one day we were walking in New York -- one of the main\nshopping streets going shopping, my mother and I. And this woman passed her and\nstopped, and she stopped. And they looked at each other and said, \"You look familiar.\"\nAnd it was a next, a friend or an acquaintance from Berlin that she really had lost total\ncontact with. And they met in the streets of New York of all places.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: She had food stamps. Her sister's son was very helpful to her. He lived a couple\nblocks away.",
        "A: And since he was Protestant, he had food. And there was even people in Germany at\nthat time. And he helped her out and watched over her, visited her and watched over her.",
        "A: I call this person Uncle Julie. He's 10 years older than my mother. As I say, it was\nmy grandmother's sister's son. Being that much older than I, he became my Uncle Julie.\nWhen my mother established herself a little bit over here, she got a visa for him to come\nover. She had a job waiting for him. She did the same bakery, which was a large place\nwhere they make pies in case it wasn't a small bakery.",
        "A: Commercial type. Baking institution. And she got a visa and got him over. And then\nhis stepdaughter -- he had married this woman that was a bit younger who many times\nsaved me by just grabbing me at night when my mother would go over and say, \"They're\nlooking for us -- hide in one place. But it's Tana that they're really looking for.\" And she\nwalked with me endlessly -- blocks, whatever -- kept me in her house. And she had two\nchildren. And until it became very uncomfortable for her. Of course, her kids were blue-\neyed; they were blond, German-looking. Just the opposite of me. No way could I pass as\none of her children. And my mother finally said to her, \"Don't do this; you're going to get\nyourself into trouble. I won't allow it. You have two small children.\" And just Julie\nmarried this lady. She had two children from a previous marriage. Her husband was\nkilled in the war before that. And my mother brought him over. And then his\nstepdaughter. And then later on his son and his stepson. So they all came over. My\nmother slowly with visas brought them over.",
        "A: Yes, he's passed away. He's ten years older than my mother. Passed away. And his\nwife also passed away. I am still in contact with his son.",
        "A: Actually, his stepson too.",
        "A: Yes, they're all in New Jersey.",
        "A: Nothing at all -- never heard about them. And my mother figured if his father would\nhave survived or his brother, they knew where we lived. We never moved away from\nGrimmstrasse, we would have thought they would have tried to get in touch with us. My\nmother tried to inquire several places and times and was never able to find out anything\nabout them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: She ran it herself. My uncle -- Uncle Julie -- he at that time was also in the business\nof making pocketbooks. He was a fashion designer initially, but with the war went down\nthe drain. But he made pocketbooks and odds and ends like that. So he was able to get\nher materials to make the things. My grandmother made the panties and outfits in our\nhome. I remember sitting and snipping with scissors, kept me busy snipping them apart\nas she sewed them on the machine.",
        "A: No, she owned the store until it was destroyed.",
        "A: Yes, because my grandfather had a will and the money he left in the will she used\ntowards that.",
        "A: Basically, when we came back, the only people aside from the family, what there was\n-- a member that was there that remembered us and waited for us was -- when I\nmentioned before this family that met us in Theresienstadt -- Fritz Simon. Her brother\nsurvived. He was in Germany. He went into a mental institution and declared himself\ninsane to hide. And he spent three and a half years in a mental institution. And the only\none on to him was his nurse -- not a Jewish woman. And she kept his secret.\nUnfortunately, after three and a half years of living in a mental institution, his problems\nwere just unbelievable. He did come out. He did marry her. She stopped by him.",
        "A: The nurse. His whole emotional being was -- problems after a while. You don't live\namong insane people for that long.",
        "A: And fake to be insane.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: Just mental.",
        "A: It's a figure that's just been released into books. I have the book, \"I Never Saw\nAnother Butterfly,\" which I bought in the museum here, because my husband bought it\nfor me when we were here for the opening. Which is a book of paintings and poems by\nchildren who didn't survive. And the preface mentions also the figure. But how accurate\nthey are -- I know, but I always heard the same figure. It's always been 15,000 and 100\nsurvived. 15,000 that went through the camp at one time from the beginning to the end --\nnot that they were all there at the same time -- that went through. And most of them went\nto Auschwitz.",
        "A: So I guess records were kept, because it's always been the same record -- the same\nfigures.",
        "A: That I heard from my mother the night before. And it was -- she says it was just\nhysteria.",
        "A: And disbelief that they were there so long they weren't going to make it. And, from\nwhat I heard is that the American Red Cross got word that this was going to be the end of\nthe camp and they were going to destroy this whole camp with everybody in it. They\ndidn't want -- they knew, I guess, that it was all coming to an end in '45. And they didn't\nwant any visible signs of this camp. Theresienstadt was a fortress at one time. Just\noutside of Prague, a small town in the countryside of Prague, and was used as an army\nfortress. And they were just going to get rid of it all totally so there was no signs of it.\nSo when this war 1s over and whoever -- Americans -- whoever came over, there would\nbe nothing left to say, \"Yes, there was something there at one time.\" And they had to do\nthis kind of quickly where it was this was going to be over pretty soon. And so, they had\nto act very quickly. And somehow the Red Cross got wind of this, and the Russians\ncame in.",
        "A: My mother, as I said before, was born of a -- born Protestant mother and a Jewish\nfather. My grandmother converted when she married my grandfather. I think they were\ntreading very easy at that time. They didn't want to antagonize the Christians by having\ntoo many Christians killed. So my grandmother would say because of her age and she\nwasn't important as an old woman, 70-year-old woman, she wasn't going to do that much\nharm. My mother, they weren't quite sure yet where she fit in. She was not born of a\nJewish mother, which makes a difference. Like I said before, they measured her -- the\nnose, the head and neck. And they really -- it took them a while to say, \"Well, we're\ngoing to put you in a holding camp until we can figure out what we're going to do with\nthese mischling -- people who were of half breeds or not quite totally Jewish.\" There\nwere a lot of -- in Theresienstadt -- war heros, like Simon, whom they didn't want to kill\noff either. We don't want a big war hero from World War I, who got the congressional\nmedal of whatever in Germany and we wanted no -- a lot of writers out there, musicians.",
        "A: People that they were just going to hold for a while and then see what happens type of\nthing. They didn't want to leave them free, but they didn't want to send them to the death\ncamps right away. And also people like my mother that they couldn't decide quite how\nJewish she was at that time. I was lucky, because I was totally Jewish because -- well,\nalmost totally Jewish, because I have a Jewish father.",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "A: Yes, definitely. The rest was just.\n"
