        "Q: Uh, would you please give me your name and your date of birth.",
        "A: My name 1s Michael V. Vogel. V-O-G-E-L. I was born November 29th, 1923.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Jacovce, J- A- C-O- V -C-E, Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: Tell me about your childhood, about your growing up. What was it like for you?",
        "A: I come from a family, my parents, my father was a businessman, he was a cattle dealer, in\nthe small community of Jacovce. We stayed in Jacovce until I became six years old. I had an\nolder sister and a younger brother. We then moved to a larger community which is called\nTopol any, T-O-P-O-L-C-A-N- Y.C with a umlaut [ha ek]. And the reason for the\nmove, because of schools. My father wanted to put us into a larger school, school which was\nin Topol any. And we lived in Topol any, we started, uh, Jewish schools, and soon after,\ntwo more children were born in our family. I can give you their names. My name used to be\nMoshe, which was, uh...they used to call me M - I - S - O, S with an umlat [Miso with a\nha_ek]. My sister who was older than my, uh, than I am, was name was Rose, Ro_1--R -O-\nZ with an umlaut [ha_ek]- I. My younger brother, who was not quite two years younger than\nme, his name was Arpad, A - R - P- A- D; and I had a sister Marta, M- A-R-T- A; anda\nlittle brother, the baby brother, whose name was Maxmilian. We lived a fairly happy life in\nSlovakia. Well, it was part of Czechoslovakia--this was the region of Slovakia. It was\nCzechoslovakia, but our part was called Slovak. We were the Slovaks. Antisemitism was\nthere, always there. I remember when we used to play soccer as kids, there was never boys\nagainst boys, it was always the Catholic against Jews. That was the kind of soccer games we\nused to play. But we got along as well as one could get along. We stuck to our ways and they\nstuck to theirs. Uh, we were quite religious, especially our mother. I even remember my bar\nmitzvah in 1936. Uh, my grandparents on my mother's side, my mother by the way came\nfrom another community, uh I would say sixty, seventy kilometers from Topol any. Her\nmaiden name was Feldman, and our grandparents, her parents, were there at my bar mitzvah,\nwhich we called the grosse shul--the big temple, the big shul. Our rabbi was a very famous\nguy. His name was Abraham Weiss. And we had to go to temple, to shul, every morning and\nespecially before I became bar mitzvah. And then of course after that, every morning. We all\nwent to the Jewish schools, except my sister. My sister was sent to Vienna. Now she was a\npre-teener, pre-teenager, where my father's youngest sister lived; and she stayed with her a\ncouple of years to go to school there. Uh, I would say from '35 to '37. And then she was sent\nback when Hitler started the rumbles. This was before the Anschluss in 1938 in Austria. We\nknew of problems in Germany. We knew of some problems but no one...no one paid much\nattention. Everyone felt ah nothing's going to happen to anyone. But we found out later that\nit did. Because in 1938 when Hitler marched into Austria, and annexed Austria so to speak\nas part of Germany, he started to take the Jews on the streets. We heard on the radios, those\nof us who had radios, what was going on - the beatings of the Jews, the break-in of the shops\nand that type of hooliganism that was going on. And pretty soon we found the Austrian Jews\nwere running away from Austria and came to our towns. And my mother took an Austrian\nlady in to us. We didn't have a huge home but the five children but we gave her a spot to\nstay. But most of all I remember is when the Czechoslovakia mobilized its armed forces.\nAnd the reason for the mobilization was because Hitler wanted to take part of\nCzechoslovakia which known to us as Sudetenland into Germany. He wanted to annex\nSudetenland into Germany. That was a Germanic-speaking part of Czechoslovakia. And I\nremember my father was also taken into service, and I still remember the narrow street as the\nfive children and our mother walked with our father to the railroad station to wish him well,\nto say goodbye to him. And, of course, the famous Neville Chamberlain quote, \"peace in our\ntime.\" And peace in our time never came; because as soon as he [Chamberlain] probably\nclosed the door of 10 Downing Street, Hitler marched not only into Sudetenland but he took\nover the Czechs, Bohemians, Moravians. But Slovakia, the region where I was born, didn't,\nnever seen a Nazi. Nazi soldiers never marched into Czechoslovakia, into Slovakia. So what\nhappened with us, the Hlinka Guard, Guard, Hlinka, which H - L-I- N-K - A, was formed,\nand then in March 15, 1939, is when Slovakia became the puppet government of the Nazis.\nThe Hlinka Guards, these were people that were our neighbors, people that our parents did\nbusiness with, that grew up, and lived with practically. They became the Guards.",
        "Q: O.K., the Guards did what?",
        "A: Guards? Their function was, this was the Nazi-type, almost like an SS-type guards. So what\nhappened with the Jews in particular, of course, only to the Jews in Slovakia as a matter of\nfact, all Jews from the age of six had to wear a yellow Star of David, sewn on the left breast\nof their outer clothing, with the inscription, Jude, Jew in German. I remember we couldn't,\ncouldn't walk the streets together. No more than three or four Jews could walk the streets\ntogether. And, of course, curfew. By eight o'clock all of us had to be in their homes. We\ncouldn't shop, uh, uh, any time we wanted to, only designated hours. And since my father\nwas, uh, a cattle dealer and horse dealer, while my father was, uh, gone, I became, I was the\noldest boy, my sister was older than me of course, so I was sort of in charge of knowing\nsome of the millers, some of the flour millers, and go to pick up flour for our family. And\nyou couldn't do it during the day because if you got caught, the Hlinkas would get to you and\nof course you were punished. Midnights, uh, middle of the nights, was when my mother and\nI and a couple of other Jewish ladies would go, go to the miller and pick up flour so we could\nhave bread. And it was all black market, and you always paid through the nose. (Laughter)\nEveryday there was a new law read to us or posted on, on bulletin boards - they had these\nlittle round, uh, stalls where you would come and read the bulletin what happens next to the\nJews. Uh, we were harassed, beaten on the streets, and of course the businesses were taken\naway from all the Jews. My father business, my father's business was given to the person\nwho worked for him. And my father had to work there to show him how to do the business,\nto sell the cattle. And my father never believed that anything would happen to us. Almost to\nthe last minute. He said no, he - the reason for that was because most, most of these people,\nfirst of all, we were Slovaks, Czechs, we were born there. No one's going to bother us. And\nsecond, my father also dealt with the Czechoslovakian government. He sold cattle and horses\nto the government for, for the armies and that, uh, type of business. So he said no, nothing's\ngoing to happen. This will, ah, this will pass. But it didn't. Because we were harassed, we\nwere beaten, and in early 1942, end of 1941, early 1942, we heard that they are going to put\nus into camps. There was a rumor at one time, too--which was not even a rumor. Actually it\nwas the truth, that the Jews will be shipped to Madagascar.\u2019 Uh, I was a kid, I never knew, I\nwas a small young teenager. But it didn't happen. Instead of Madagascar, myself, my older\nsister, and my next brother--Rose, myself and Arpad--were told to report to the Town\nSquare. All young Jewish boys and girls. When they rounded us up, they told us that we're\ngoing back to our homes, pack our belongings - take food and clothing with you - you're\ngoing to be relocated and your parents will join you. They took us about two hours from our\nhome town to the first war camp. It was called Arbeitlager. And the camp, the name of the\ncamp was Novaky, N -O- V - A- K - Y, manned by large group of SS, of, uh, Slovakian\nHlinka Guards. Mind you, we have yet to see an SS officer. Let me, let me re-track back for\na moment if I may. Uh, the first time that have seen German soldiers was when Germany\nwas invading Poland, September Ist, 1939. And how we seen them, the German army was\ngoing through Slovakia to get to Poland, because we were first and then came Poland. But\nwe felt them. My father had to take the cattle from his stalls, from his, and the horses, and\ndeliver it to the Town Square for the German army. Beaten by these, uh, by the Hlinka\nGuards behind him, going fast, to give this for the Germans to take with them as, as food and\nand horses for, for carrying their materials, war materials. That was the first time that I'd seen\na German soldier. And when we'd seen them on those little motorcycles with the side little\ncar and, and, and trucks and horses pulling their, their - that's how we've seen - that's the first\ntime we've seen the Nazi soldiers, the German soldiers. This was the Wehrmacht at the time.\nSo, we never had anything to do with them as far as being our guards yet, because our guards\nwere the people that spoke Slovak just like we did. And when we arrived to Novaky, they\nloaded us on to trains after we loaded, after we packed our belongings at home. They came\nwith us to our homes so we wouldn't run, we wouldn't hide, and they had enough of these\nguards all over, all over the city.",
        "Q: Did you know any of your guards?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, by names.",
        "Q: Tell me about your conversation with them.",
        "A: Well, they would come, first of all they became ruthless. O.K. The word \"_ id\" was common.\n\"id\" is a Jew. \"We finally got you _ids,\" and that type of words, and beating. They all had\nclubs and rifles and canes. Whatever they had they would beat you. These were people, this\none guy in particular, his name was Martin ek (ph), who was the barber, who was our\nbarber. We used to go to the barbershop - he worked for a Jewish barber called Dezider (ph)\n' The Jews were never deported to Madagascar.\nBanau, B - A - N - A - U. The poor guy perished in Auschwitz, but you know. And this\nMartin ek (ph) was my barber. He cut my hair, cut my family's hair, and he, you couldn't ask\nfor a nicer guy during the time (laughter). He was also an alcoholic but most of them were.\nAnd when we arrived to this camp, we seen guards from our home town. You would go\nclose to him and would ask him nicely, you know, please don't help or something. Boom, the\nfirst thing would happen you would get hit. When they took us to Novaky by train, by, by\npassenger train, and when we arrived there it was a huge complex. With wooden barracks.\nGirls on one side, boys on the other side of the barrack, camp. And we were assigned to our\nbunks, unloaded our belongings, and then we had to line up in front of our barracks and then\nthe guards would read us the laws. And, by the way, food at the time was still plentiful in\nSlovakia. Slovakia was a farm country, so the food was there. The cooks were our people.\nThe Jews became, those who were appointed to be the cooks. We had meat, we had, we had\npotatoes, we had eggs, we, we still that. And we were also allowed at the time still to be\nreceiving packages. So the parents would send some stuff to us. So that was still allowed\nbecause it was our, you know, still in our country. When the next morning when they woke\nus up and lined us up in front of our barracks, they told us after breakfast, you're going to\nreport to work. What kind of work? Something which really, uh, none, nothing, uh, useful,\njust carrying bricks or stones and making piles. Because they didn't build anything. There\nwas nothing to build. This was a camp, just a big grounds with holes where they were\ndigging, some people were digging sand. My job, I was assigned to carrying stones in my\nbare hands and making a pile. And after we made that pile high, then we take that pile and\nmake another pile. And this was the daily, daily routine. There was some people, there was\neven railroad tracks with small, small cars that ran on the railroad, that we pushed on the\nrailroad. And we would just carry sand, dump it and carry more sand. No reason. There\nweren't homes built. There weren't roads built. There was just a camp, just a detention camp.\nAnd beating. Yea, we still had music and our singing groups. None of us believed what,\nwhat was waiting for us. When in April 1942 the first transport, well actually it was the end\nof March, the first transport from Novaky was taken and my brother Arpad was there and so\nwas my sister Ro _1, Rose. I stayed behind. Of course, I didn't know, we didn't know where\nthey were going. Neither did they. And I found out of course much later, my sister Rose\nended up in Auschwitz. My brother Arpad ended up in Lublin-Majdanek. Couple of months\nlater my turn came. I, I left with a bunch of people, Slovakian people from my home town\nalso, and we, this is what they told us. This is how they did it. They lined us up in front of\nour barracks. They told us we're going to be relocated to the east. Pack whatever you owned,\nreport back in front. We did that. They loaded us into trucks, and I will never forget, just as,\njust as the trucks started to move, in unison we all started to sing the Hatikvah. I'll never\nforget that. Just the trucks moving, and we singing the Hatikvah anyway. And when we\nfinished the Hatikvah, still being Czechs and Slovaks, we sang the Czech national anthem.\nWhen we came, the trucks stopped at a railroad siding. Railroad siding is for the, load, uh,\nfreight. We've seen, oh, I would say about twenty cattle cars lined up, on the railroad tracks,\nand each cattle car had a wooden plank, doors wide open, and the plank leading into the\ncattle car. They loaded us into the cattle car, between eighty and hundred of us, boys and\ngirls together. A metal bucket was put on each end of the car which was used for bathroom.\nThe cattle car's doors were locked and sealed. We could hear them locking it. This was the\nlast time that we have seen the Slovakian Hlinka guards. Some of the boys got friendlier with\nthe guards, and they say, \"Goodbye to you. You know, this 1s it, we won't [see] you no\nmore.\" And the train started to move, and Novaky is approximately 24 hours distance from\nAuschwitz. Of course, we didn't know we were going to Auschwitz. They told us we were\nbeing relocated and our families will join you. Your families will soon join you. I would say\napproximately 24 hours later. . .",
        "Q: Tell me, before you go on, tell me about those 24 hours.",
        "A: That cattle car - first of all, it was jam packed, uncomfortable. People were fighting for\nplaces. You could not, not all of us could sit down. Hardly anyone could lay down. People\nwere crushing each other. And of course they were fighting for the bathroom facilities. That\nwas the worst part. Those people who couldn't hold, and then of course the buckets would be\nover-filled, and there was nothing else you could do, just relieve yourself as close to the\ncomer of the car as you possibly could. We stopped once, on the cattle car, just the cattle car\nstopped once to relieve the buckets and they gave us some water, one, on one trip. I don't\nremember where - I was told it was in Jinna, that was the name of the town, but who could\ntell. And we got the buckets out and then they gave us some water. I would say next\nmorning, now I would say next morning we arrived to our destination. The cattle cars\nstopped. The cattle cars were opened. And this was the first time that we have seen SS\nguards, SS soldiers, and SS officers. And every SS guard had a dog on a leash, either a\nGerman Shepherd or a Doberman Pincher. Mostly German Shepherds. Their rifles with\nbayonets sticking up, and either wooden walking cane, a bamboo cane or a whip in their\nhands. And of course, most of us, all of us in Slovakia I should say, spoke German. If you\nwere Czechoslovakian, you spoke German, Hungarian and Slovak. That was our language.\nThese were our languages. And they yelled, the Nazis would yell, \"Juden raus schnell!\"--\n\"All Jews out fast, fast!\" With a beating. And we have seen, among the SS, people in striped\nuniforms, prisoner striped uniforms. And these were the boys that worked the railroad track.\nOf course we didn't know why. The Nazis, the SS would tell us to line up. And the boys, the\nprisoner boys, the people in prison uniform, would come to us and tell us either in German or\nin Czech or whatever language, line yourself up in rows of five. Of course, all done with\nbeatings by the SS. When they separated the boys from the girls, when we were all lined up\nin rows of five, everything in Nazi concentration camp was five, because of easier count, and\nwith the Nazis, with the dogs on the side of us, we started to march. I would say a mile and a\nhalf maybe. And we came to a gate of Auschwitz. A gate with a half moon sign, that says\n\"Arbeit Macht Frei,\" work makes you free, or gives you freedom. After we were in\nAuschwitz, I'm going to jump a little bit 1f I may, in Auschwitz for what, three, four months,\nand we used to march through this gate, in and out of this gate, with the orchestra playing.\nAs we marched through this gate, we used to say among each other, \"Arbeit Macht Frei,\nKrematorium drei\"--\"Work makes you free when you end up in crematorium three.\" And\nthose of us we always looked who survived, who's still alive. As we marched through the\ngate, the girls on one side of the camp, the boys on the other. Auschwitz is built of solid\nbrick. It's, everything is brick. Even the road, the streets are made of brick. The barracks,\nsolid barracks. Before the Nazis invaded Poland, this part of Auschwitz used to be a Polish\nArmy camp. So they marched us through the gate with whips and beatings and dogs jumping\nat us. We came to a huge brick building. They shoved us into the huge brick building, and\nthere were prisoners and SS telling us what to do next. There was tables, long tables. The\nfirst area we had to undress, strip our clothing. There were hooks behind us. You put the\nclothing through a piece of wire, hang the clothing up. Take our shoes off, put the shoes on\nthe floor. Next table were the barbers, the camp barbers. Where they shaved our head, cut\nour hair, shaved the entire body. They said this for hygiene. Then we moved to another table\nwhere the tattooing was done. So the tatoo was done on left forearm. There was one person\nwho rubbed the little piece of dirty alcohol on your arm, and the other one had the needle\nwith the inkwell, and he would do the numbering. So my number is 65,316. That means\nthere were 65,315 people numbered before me, tattooed before me. After the tattoo, tattooing\nwas done, they put us, they gave us the clothing, but not what we came with. They gave us,\nissued us a striped brown cap, a jacket, a striped jacket, a pair of striped trousers, a pair of\nwooden clogs, and a shirt. No socks or underwear. Then the last area, when they gave us the\nuniform, they gave us two strips of cloth. The cloth I would say was about six inches long,\nmaybe inch and a half wide. And it would star, starred with the Star of David, corresponding\nwith the number on your left forearm, sewn on your left breast and on the right pant leg. And\nthen the last 1tem which was the most important item that we received was a round bowl.\nAnd this bowl was the life blood of your being. First of all, without 1t you couldn't get the\nmeager rations that we got. And second, the bathroom facilities were almost non-existent.\nUh, uh, even at Auschwitz, each barrack on the bottom had a washroom. But you couldn't\nuse it. It was only for the privileged. You could use it special times if you were quick,\nbecause they only gave you like two, three minutes. But most of us couldn't use it. So, when\nthey gave us the numbers and the bowl, you are now, we were recorded, also by prisoners.\nThis was the, what they call today the Nazi documentation department. These were, they\nwere the officers that did all the paper work. And these were prisoners that worked in the\nNazi documentation department. Every transport, how many people arrived, and what their\nnames, where they came from, where was the transport from, where it originated, and so on.\nThese people were the ones to do that type of work. And most of these people were actually\noffice workers from homes - bankers, uh, people that worked as accountants possibly. So\nafter they documented all that, we no longer had names. The Nazis called us Haftlings,\nprisoners. I became Haftling , prisoner 65,316. Then they\nmarched us to our homes, to our barracks. In Auschwitz as well as all concentration camps,\nall buildings where prisoners, Haftlings, were housed, were known as blocks. I was assigned\nto Block 16 in Auschwitz, and Auschwitz , our main camp Auschwitz. Each\nbarrack, each block, had between three to five people that were in charge of the blocks, and\ntheir name, their, their ranks and names would be such. The head guy was called\nBlockaltester, block elder. Next to him would be a guy called Stubendienst; \"Stube\" means\nroom, \"Dienst,\" \"assistant.\" He was the assistant of the Blockaltester and the third guy was\nthe most important guy actually he was the Schreiber or the register and the reason for which\nhe was so important because he would write people he had in each block, and how much\nartificial tea or artificial coffee was served, how many slices of bread, and how much potato\npeel, potato soup was served in the evening. That guy was the one responsible for that. And\neverything was done by number. One of the most cruelest things in any camp was called the\nAppell, the roll call. The roll call in Auschwitz, I will, uh, so many people got killed during\nroll call, murdered. Many people ran to the wires just, just before roll call. Of course even\nthat the Nazis didn't let you do, run to the electric wires and fry. But that was the most\ncruelest thing. I, I, that was so bad, they would wake you up with beatings anywhere\nbetween four and six o'clock in the morning. It depended on how early they got up. And\nthen, you had to line up in rows of five. And the whole camp was counted with the main\nprisoner, who was called the Lageraltester, the Lager elder, who in most cases was either a, a\nGerman criminal or came from Poland. I also want to make one thing very strong, very clear.\nThe people in charge of the barracks in most cases, and I would say 90% or better, were\nGermans or Poles, Germans or Poles. These were the ones with the green triangles - then the\ngreen triangles were, were the criminals. The red ones were the political prisoners. And we\nhad some red ones also in charge of us. But these people had better way, better living, better\nuniforms, underwear, regular boots or shoes. They had little rooms in each barrack.\nBlockaltester had his room. Stubedeinst and Schreiber had a room, and they had food which\nwas organized in Auschwitz. These were the murderers, the murderers among us. They were\nprisoners, but these are the killers. And during roll call they would kill many of us. Kill us\nfor the simple reason that someone did it in their pants. They, uh, soiled their pants, soiled\ntheir uniform. Poor guy couldn't hold it. Dysentery was, was something very, very common.\nAfter two weeks of Auschwitz your eyes would swell up from water. Your, your whole face\nwould be blown up from water. Your legs would puff on you because of malnutrition and\nhygiene. And then you became a skeleton which was called Muselmann by the Nazis. After\nthe roll call, and only after the whole camp was counted and the count was correct, only then\nwe were able to go to the labor, slave labor work sites we were assigned to, labor\nKommandos they were called. Every group in Auschwitz as well as all concentration camps\nwas called Kommandos. I was assigned, well, let me give you the barrack. There were four\npeople in each tier. There were three tiers. Two men to a blanket. No mattresses, no nothing,\njust one little blanket for two people. You never dared to take your uniform or shoes off,\nclogs off, because if you did the next morning you couldn't find them. Because during\nworking hours when we were working, many of us lost our clogs in the mud and there, that\nwas it. No shoes. You died sooner anyway. So after the roll call they gave us our first ration\nof the day which consisted of artificial tea, artificial coffee. The Nazis called it Ersatz tea,\nErsatz cafe, Ersatz's tea, Ersatz's cafe. Then your Kapo Kommando, Kapo who was in charge\nof the Kommando, you would have to report to him to be assigned to slave labor. My first\njob in Auschwitz was in Buna, which was a munition factory. We did, uh, artificial tires,\nrubber, uh, synthetic tires. There were two main factories like that. One was the Krupp\nWerke and one was Buna. Krupp is well today in American because they sell the coffee\nmakers here. I see every time I walk by the department store coffee makers I just cringe. I\nworked in Buna, I survived Buna I would say almost three months.",
        "Q: Describe the work please.",
        "A: O.K. The Buna work, there were a lot of civilian workers which the Nazis brought from\ndifferent European countries. The masters, the foremen, uh, the engineers. I want to make\nthis very strong that a prisoner could not converse with these civilian workers. We could not\ntalk with them, although some of us snuck through and tried to, uh, they would throw us\nsometimes a piece of bread if they weren't afraid, because these, these people too, they had\nan arm band and the arm band would identify them as civilian workers. See. They knew\nwhat was going on, but, but they couldn't talk about it. A lot, there were some from Slovakia,\nthose Yugoslavs, there were Poles, the Polish civilians. There were some people from France\nand Germany. These were the people that were building, that that did the work there.\nActually these were the masters, we were the laborers. They would tell the SS how many\npeople they need and what they want us to do. And it was hard labor. Most of the time you\ndidn't work with tools. Everything was done with hands. There was a break for lunch right\naround noon. The factory whistle would blow and you'd go outside to lunch. And prisoners\nwith wagons would bring our noon meal which consisted of the soup. The soup had mostly\npotato peels - no meat whatsoever. Hardly none, no fat whatsoever. Just a little margarine\nthrown into it. And by the time they brought it to us in, to different, you know, they had\nmore groups to bring that. They brought it on a wagon what they pushed by themselves.\nThey didn't come by cart or trucks or anything. Pushed by prisoners to the work sites. By the\ntime we got it of course it was cold. It didn't, you know, and then we go back to work half an\nhour later. Back to the same. I will never forget when they lined us up in rows of five to\nmarch back to Auschwitz, to the camp, you would carry fifty, sixty of our comrades on our\nshoulders, either dead or dying. Back to Auschwitz, back to the camp. Because no one was\nallowed to die outside or be left outside. Because when we marched through the camp, the\ngates were open and they would count us there. Then we go to our own barracks. But not\nupstairs to your barrack where you could relax and sit down and lay down. You stayed in\nfront of your barrack until the whistle blew, the horn blew, Appell. And the Appell was\nalways yelled out from the first barrack and then like an echo, each barrack had a person that\nyelled Appell. There was an SS in charge and he would be 1n a tower. He would be the one\nwho would initiate the Appell call. And like an echo, it would just go throughout Auschwitz.\nThe Auschwitz itself, the Auschwitz camp itself was not that huge. So when everyone was\nlined up, then the Lageraltester, the main prisoner who was in charge of the whole camp,\nwould, the SS hierarchy, the SS officers, they would count from one barrack to the next to\nthe next and the next until all. And this is how we sound over the phone, over the echo:\nBlock , - Block seven, count correct. Eight, correct, and so on and so on,\ncorrect, until they came to a block where was not correct. You stood there until the person\nwas found. In most cases, the person either was somewhere in dying under some, under\nsomething, under, under a bunk. Or he was so sick he didn't care one way or another whether\nhe lives or dies. Or someone ran to the wires, to the electric wires. But only after everyone\nwas counted, even those we brought on our shoulders. He was dropped in front of his\nbarrack on the Appellplatz, on the roll call place. And that's where he was. And after the roll\ncall, each barrack had to clean up their sick and, and the dead and carry them to a barrack\nwhich was a holding place. And then the dead ones would be picked up the Leichen (ph)\nKommando. How would I translate leichen (ph) - as a dead, a Kommando that, this was a\ngroup of, of, of Jewish prisoners that worked with a wagon. They would go from barrack to\nbarrack, from camp to camp, to pick up the people that died at work, and those who died\nover night. And then they would be taken to the Leichenhaller (ph), to the dead cell, where\nthey were stacked up like sardines. And the next after that, they would be taken to the gas\nchambers, or to the pits, whichever was available, and the body would be burned. I survived\nBuna...I would say, close to three months. Then one evening after roll call, a friend of mine\nfrom not too far from my home town whom I got to know, he told me that he just got a job,\nand he said if there's a way to survive Auschwitz, I think I got it. And there was a try out in\nfront of Block Sixteen, our block. He was also in Block 16. He asked me, told me, try out\nand see if you can make it. So the try out was held by SS. They had suitcases there, and they\nput suitcases on the arm to see how fast you can run. Of course, we didn't know why. I made\nit. And I was assigned to a group called the Canada Kommando. It's like the country of, it\nwas named by the Nazis and the prisoners, the Polish prisoners named it Canada Kommando\nand the reason they named it Canada, because the final solution, of course I knew nothing\nabout final solution in those days. I knew nothing about anything else far as, other than being\nin Auschwitz. But the Canada Kommando was, or the organization was called Canada,\nbecause we unloaded all incoming Jews from every Nazi-occupied country, European\ncountry. By this time, this was still in 1942, this was like September 1942, this time they\nwere bringing in entire families. Not just young people. Families from their homes, families\nfrom holding camps like Novaky, and from, uh, Vienna, from from France, from Belgium,\nfrom Holland. We had people coming in from every different, every country. And the\nCanada Kommando consisted of start out I would say about four hundred and fifty people.\nAnd we had two shifts, day shift and night shift. I was assigned to the day shift, and we\nwould go to the railroad tracks. This is still Auschwitz I. And before we went to the railroad\ntracks, the Kapos would line us up, and the SS would tell us in no uncertain term, if there is\nanyone here that will talk to the people you are unloading other than what you are supposed\nto tell them. See they told us you will only tell them, leave you belongings behind in the\nlanguage that you understand or they understand, that they speak. Anything else you can't\ntalk to them about. You can't say anything to anyone else other than what you're supposed to\ndo. Anyone caught talking to the people that are arriving will be dealt with. And I've seen\nmany that was being dealt with. Some of us found their families. Some of us found their\nbrothers and sisters and parents. When they unloaded them.",
        "Q: What happened when they tried to talk to them?",
        "A: They were killed. The Nazis would take them behind the cattle car after we unloaded the\npeople and slowly torture and murder them. We carried a poor, a poor, poor soul back to the\ncamp. Nothing stopped the transport. In many cases, an SS man depended where the\ntransport came from. Western European countries for instance which people came from\nHolland and Belgium. Well dressed. When they came, an SS officer would get over a bull\nhorn, and he would tell, ladies and gentlemen, I want to apologize that you've been a little\ninconvenienced, but you know this is a war on, and we don't have the facilities for to better\ntrains, but you will be soon taken care of. You are in Auschwitz, that's a work camp and if\nyou work you will live. Just leave your belongings behind, and everything will be brought to\nyou after you are cleaned, disinfected. You will get hot tea and so on. And of course we\ncouldn't do anything about that type of stuff. Although many of us tried, tried by telling\nthem, don't take, to a mother we'd tell, don't take a child with you because if you do, you're\nnot going to survive. Excuse me. (Pause) Some got caught, some people got caught doing\nthat. Didn't live until the transfer left. That's when they took care of them. After, I would say\ntoday, then I didn't know, really none of us knew, I would say that approximately 10% of the\nincoming people with the families were selected to be taken to slave labor. The rest were\ntaken to the crematorias. There was, uh, one crematoria at the time only in Auschwitz. This\nis 1942. And uh, they couldn't, they couldn't, uh, eliminate so many bodies in the one\ncrematoria so they build trenches, ditches, and that's where they would pour gasoline or\nsome kind of inflammable item on them and that's how they would burn them. And I want to\nmake clear we didn't see it then. That we still didn't see, except we knew the boys that\nworked in Sonderkommando, and these boys, the kind of Kommandos on this Kommando\nwere constantly tried to be, oh we will not, they was isolated. They lived in the barrack that\nyou were not allowed to go to. But we already had enough Pole, old-time prisoners so to\nspeak. Some of us knew how to get away from there and the Sonderkommando knew how to\nget away from their area, and by bribing certain officials, certain people, you were allowed to\ncommunicate between each other. It was an underground, uh, well, it was called\nOrganizierung, organizing. The underground, uh, resistance group was always there, from\nday one. Some of, some of our boys were the leaders of the group. They, they, they knew\nhow to organize well. I was a youngster myself, eighteen years old, ah, not quite. I was\nseventeen when I arrived there. I really, I was part of the group that brought the riches from\nCanada back to the camp, smuggled it in. I was the young smuggler. There was three of us\nthat did that job. And we would bring it to our families, to our friends, those of us who had\nsisters and brothers in the camp or mothers in the women's camp. And there were those who,\nwho knew how to get it to them by bribing some of the Nazi officials.",
        "Q: Can you describe that process, but I think maybe it makes sense to break the tape at this\npoint. We've got fifty minutes. Let's break and change the tape and we'll pick up with\ndescribing...\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: Take us back, you were starting to describe the Canada and how it worked. Can you do that\nplease?",
        "A: Sure. The Canada Kommando, after we unloaded the people, after the Nazis made sure that\nwe go to the tracks, and that we don't speak to no one, the main job was to tell the people and\ntry to keep them calm. And when, the first thing that would happen after the people were\nunloaded, in those days there were trucks, dump trucks. The first people they would get rid\nof were women with children, the old, the sickly, the ill, uh, the people with, uh, cripples.\nThese people would be loaded on to trucks, and taken away right away, and the last people\nthat the Nazis would march were the people that were selected to go to slave labor. With the\nbelongings, some of it on the ground, but most of it in the cattle cars. And when these people\nwere taken, men to the men's camp, women to the women's camp, and the same process was\ndealt with them as it was done with us. Numbered and shaved and showered and so on.\nAssigned to the barracks. Only then we started to work on the mountains of luggage which\nwas loaded in to trucks and it went to the Canada warehouse. It was a huge complex where\ngirl Canada Kommandos, mostly Slovakian girl Canada Kommando, worked. And their job,\nthey were, they were the only ones dressed up almost like, not a civilian but nice, a dress,\nand they all had babushkas [NB: kerchiefs] tied on their heads, because their heads were\nshaven. And these girls worked with the clothing. Disinfecting of the clothing. And when\nwe, we, first we would do this. Load it into trucks. Unload it into Canada warehouse. And\nthere were boxes in front of us, SS guards walking back and forth watching us, what we\nwere doing. And we would take first the valuables would we put into boxes. Monies in one\narea, gold and watches and rings and that type of stuff in another box. And everything had its\nplace. Then we started to work with the clothes. Of course, we search the clothing - search\nthe pockets, the shoulders, the shoulder pads were, were, were felt for any, any hard stuff or\nany soft clothing, or soft monies, and then we had to rip some of it off. Even shoe heels were\nopened, because the Nazis found out that the shoe heels the people saved. And toothpaste, in\nthose days because the toothpaste in Europe was not the greatest, not like America, and they\nwould squeeze and look for diamonds and gold, which was found there. Then we started to\nwork with the clothing. Separate the clothing. Men's, women's and children's clothing\nseparate. There was a blanket on the ground always where we dumped the clothing. After the\nblanket was full enough, you bundle, you put on your shoulder and took it to the girls. Now,\nlet me make a very strong point. When these bundles of clothing were taken to the girls,\nmany of us brought food to the girls, in the blankets. But, there was always an SS man\nstanding by, he was watching of course the girls too. But the girls, he couldn't watch the girls\ndoing that, because the girls wanted to, working with the clothing. They were watching what,\nas we were dumping, if there was any food. They knew we were bringing food there. In a\nway they let us, we played a cat and mouse game with these guys. If they caught you, you\ngot beaten. Twenty-five on your behind. You bend down and then you get twenty-five. You\nhad to count them, twenty-five. And you count twenty-five on your buttocks, and the Nazis\nstop you. They say, how many did I give you. And you say, seventeen. Wrong. All over\nagain. This was a sport. They called it sport. And that's how we used to bring the food to the\ngirls. And, information to the girls from the camp. She had a brother there, or a father there,\nnot working in Canada Kommando but working in Marashar (ph) which was uh, uh, people\nthat work with the bricks and, and, and, mortar, that type of people. And they would say,\nyour father told me to say this and that, they could keep up and so on, whatever. And then\nthey would write, they would find pencils. . .",
        "Q: How, how did they find pencils?",
        "A: From us. From Canada Kommando. We had the pencils, the papers, the watches, the clocks,\nthe compasses. We, we, people from Europe, from France, Belgium, Holland, they used to\nbring stuff with them that you wouldn't believe. And of course everyone brought the finest\nfinery they had because they felt they can sell it to save their life. That was another thing.\nThey even told them, some of them, bring, bring, because winters, you need, a lot of them\ncame with nice fur coats and, you know, it was all gone. And so, I mean, I mean, so we\nwould bring these girls and the girl would send a note to their father or their brother or their\ncousin or their husband. There was one boy who died last year, his name was Fisher. His\nwife was working in Canada Kommando, in women's Canada Kommando. He worked in the\nmen's Canada Kommando. So that's how these boys, that's how that was. And I, I worked\nthere, the warehouse and the railroad tracks. Then I was put on the night shift. You know,\nyou see, you couldn't survive Auschwitz by yourself. You had to have a partner. In Yiddish\nit was called, in Hebrew it was called shitif (ph). Shitif (ph) is a partner. And I had three\npartners. Not one of them 1s alive. The last one was Fisher, who died uh last year. And\nwithout a partner you couldn't survive. After we finished a day's work at Canada\nKommando, you just couldn't go home, back to the camp, without being searched, first at the\nwork site - lined up, stripped naked in most cases. And if you weren't stripped naked, your\npants dropped because they knew that some of us carried money in the places that is, uh,\nkind of dark. Uh, but we do, we also knew how to smuggle out, smuggle the stuff in. For\ninstance, you in this row, and your friend is in the row in front of you. You always stood\nbehind your friend, behind your partner. And as you partner was already searched, you\nshoved it to him. And he stepped forward. And then you were clear. A lot of times we got\ncaught, beaten and caught. Let me give you one incident what would happen to the clothing.\nAfter the girls cleaned the clothing, it was bundled again, and carried by us, there was at the\nCanada warehouse, there was a railroad siding, railroad tracks, with freight cars waiting. And\nthis was taken by us, loaded into cattle cars, into freight cars, and shipped to Germany. I\nremember one incident very, very clearly. I don't know, I don't know if names, German\nofficers' names mean anything. Uh, there was one guy named Otto Graff (ph). There was\nanother guy named Unterscharftthrer Wiglet (ph). That's a rank. He was in charge of the\nCanada warehouse. And a young boy from Grodno (ph), a Polish Jewish boy, as he, the one\nboy stayed in the cattle car, in the freight car, and stacked the bundles, and the other ones\nlike us, we would carry the bundles. He would fill the car. This boy from Grodno hid himself\nwith the bundles and the freight train took off. Now it's evening time, ready to be lined up to\ngo back home. And we were counted. Fisher, by the way, was a registrar of the Canada\nKommando. Besides being working there as a Canada Kommando worker, he had the job of\nregistering all the prisoners. He's counting, he was short one. Now, they started looking. First\nall over the warehouse. A lot of us would rest sometime without the Nazis knowing in the\nbundle where the girls worked, on top of the heap, and they would cover us and let us rest.\nAnd they would take, we had lemons a lot of times from the transports. You know, the\nlemons would come, they would make hot lemonade. Just hot water, but there was a place\nthat cooked the food, you know, that cooked for the Nazis. And we'd get hot water from\nthere and make lemon, or squeeze the lemon into hot water. So this boy who was bundled\nhimself up in, in with the clothing, train left and he went with it. Of course, we didn't know\nhe went with it. Looking for him, the Nazis are looking for him, not us. The Nazis and the\nKapos are the ones who start looking, searching the, all Canada warehouse. Can't find him.\nAll of a sudden Otto Graff, the SS officer, jumps on his motorcycle, goes after the train. And\nthey bring him back. As close as I'm sitting to you, there was a tree on the ground. Otto Graff\nlines the boy up against the tree and goes to his neck, and shoots him right here, in front of\nour eyes. And he tells us right then and then, this is how you will end up if you try to escape.\nAnd we carried the boy from Grundo, I can't think of his last, his first name, Jankl (ph), and\ncarried him back to camp. Many of us tried. There's so many people tried and never made it.\nSeptember 23rd, 1942. (Cough). It's a day that I will never forget. I was working night shift.\nMy friends were, some of my partners were working day shift. September 23, 1942 fell on\nErev Yom Kippur, when my mother and my father, my little sister, Marta, and my little\nbrother, Maxmilian, were brought to Auschwitz. My mother, my little brother and my little\nsister were gassed upon arrival. My father was assigned to slave labor. My mother was only\n42 years old. My father was assigned to slave labor, and we met in Auschwitz. Not in the\nsame barrack of course. My father was assigned to work with horses, being that he, that's\nwhat, many times they asked, in most cases they asked how old are you, what is your\nprofession. So my father was assigned to work with horses, to do some work. My father took\nill, uh, second week of November 1942, and he was put into a Krankenbau, a sick bay, Block\n7 in Auschwitz. Auschwitz I, still Auschwitz I. I would come to see my father every night\nafter roll call. I was not allowed to go inside the barrack, but to the window. I would yell to\nhim through the window and he would come up. I will never forget the last time I've seen my\nfather. He, uh, said to me, and by then he knew there was only two of us left in our family,\nwhatever you do, try to survive and carry on the name. I came to see him the next evening,\nand, uh, yelled for him and called for him and he never came out. Another person came out\nand he said to me that they took him this morning. They gassed him this morning. First of\nJanuary, first part of January 1943, the Canada Kommando was moved to Birkenau.",
        "Q: Can you go back...is 1t too hard?",
        "A: O.K.",
        "Q: How did you know that your family had arrived. How did you know that your mother and\nchildren were taken?",
        "A: O.K. The boys that worked the day shift unloaded my family. One boy from my hometown's\nname was Yako Buchler, Jacob Buchler, B - U - C - H, Buchler in this country. Buchler was,\nI would say, fifteen years older than me who knew my family quite well. We lived in the\nsame town. And he told me what happened to my family. Yako Buchler ended up in Israel\nafter the war. In 1981 I went to the World Gathering of all us survivors. (Long pause -\ncrying) and that's when we discussed and we talked about that then too. Excuse me. (Long\npause - take your time - conversation) O.K. Oh dear, I didn't believe this would happen to\nme. (After you went through tt, it's real to you.) Alright.",
        "Q: So you found out really the details.",
        "A: Yea, we were partners, and, uh, of course I went to see my father (pause - conversation), and\nmy father's birthday was November 8th. My father was born in 1898, and my mother was\nborn in 1900. So in 1942 she was 42 years old and my father was two years older.\n(PAUSE)",
        "Q: You wanted to pick up...",
        "A: We moved, they moved us from Auschwitz I, [to] what the Nazis called Auschwitz zwei,\nAuschwitz II, which was Birkenau. Course we knew nothing about it. The only thing we\nknew there were boys working in Birkenau, building a new camp. As I told you at the outset,\nAuschwitz I was solid brick. Birkenau was all wooden huts. Dirt roads practically, muddy.\nThe Canada Kommando was housed in Block 28. Then the railroad tracks already led into\nBirkenau. We didn't have to go back to Auschwitz railroad tracks to unload the victims. In\nfront of all the people because Birkenau was a camp on two sides, two sides of the road. Let\nme explain. Only one entrance, but here's a road in the middle. There are camps, rows of\ncamps such like this way, and rows of camps same way this way. We were, the first camp\nwere the girls. Wires in front of us. A ditch in between, you know, wires, in between the\ncamps. Guard towers all around the complex, all around, constantly manned by SS. We, the\nCanada Kommando, were so gutsy already by then, seasoned, knew how to bribe some of\nthe officials, some of the SS, would go close, as close to the, to the wires as possible, and the\ngirls would meet us on the other side. And we would throw over food to them. But we paid.\nWe knew which SS we paid for it. Because the SS were not allowed to take in front of you,\nin front of them. But they, they would say, Canada Kommando | , Canada\nKommando, what do you have today. Ye , | have today a gold watch. And it's all\nright, you drop it there, so when he, when he is relieved from the post by the other SS man\nwho relieves him, then he tells you where to drop it and he picks it up. Then he would turn\nhis back and you would throw something to the girl. All the other guards could see, but the\nother guards were busy with same way. One, two, three of us would go to the wire, and they\nwould, you could never go close enough. You made your, you made the arrangements the\nday before. You would say, , 1 come tomorrow, I got a sister here.\nSee. And he says , what are you going to bring me?\n, what would you like? You know, whatever I find, you know. And\nthat's how we did it. I survived because of Canada Kommando. And uh, if it wouldn't be for\nthat, I probably would be one in six million.",
        "Q: Tell me about Birkenau. Birkenau was...",
        "A: Birkenau, as I said, was nothing but mud. The water was in pipes. The water came out real\nthin spritz [Yidd: a spray] of water of pipe. You couldn't drink the water. If you drank the\nwater, you died. But the Canada Kommando were the organizers. And the Sonderkommando\nwere the organizers because the Sonderkommando got the valuables from the clothing of the\npeople that were gassed. Canada Kommando got the valuables of the, of the the big valises,\nand luggage and baggage of the people. So, we were treated differently by, even by the SS to\na degree. They killed us, they beat us, that part they did with us. But we were the clog in the\nmachinery. If you got caught you got killed, regardless who you were. Where you could be\nclose to the SS who you gave so much because he couldn't pick it up, even the SS work in\nthe Canada Kommando. But they were hoarders, these people were, were hoarding, uh, uh,\nvaluables, monies and whatever, but they couldn't pick it up themselves. So they knew. In\nBirkenau they treated us differently. And by the gate some of the SS who were jealous of the\nother SS who worked the Canada Kommando, they would say, ah, here comes the Canada\nKommando, let's search them. Always at the gate. And when we searched them, we dropped\nit, they would take it. So everybody got a piece of the action, so to speak. But the camp itself,\nthis was really and truly the death factory. Birkenau had four crematoriums, two gas\nchambers, two crematoriums on one side of the road, two gas chambers, two crematortums\non the other side of the road. And the railroad tracks went right into, close to the crematoria.\nAnd the whole camp could see. You could see the flames, not just the smoke, you could see\nthe flames from the chimney. Well, of course when burning the Muselmann, the people that\nwere skeletons, only the smoke. But when there were fat people, with still fat on them, there\nwere flames. And a lot of people when they were coming, when they came to Birkenau, they\nthought, they thought it was a bakery. The smell, they they, thought it was a bakery,\nsomething was baking. (SHORT PAUSE) April 7, 1944, the first two successful Jewish boys\nescaped Auschwitz. First name was Walter Rosenberg--who changed his name after the war\nto Rudolph Vrba-- and the second was Freddie Wetzler, W - E- T - Z- L- E- R, who kept\nhis name. And these two boys escaped. Three days they were buried in an empty camp in\nBirkenau called the Mexico Camp. Nazis called it Mexico because when they brought the\nRussian prisoners there, they didn't have any clothes, so they put blankets on them. So they\ncalled it Mexico Camp. Mexico. Nazis had names for everything. And these boys for three\ndays were buried there, and we had to stay on roll call three days without food, without\nwater, until, the third day the Nazis - would, this is what would happen. If someone escaped,\nthe siren would blow, everyone had to go out regardless of what time, stand the roll call.\nWhen the person was found, he would be displayed in front of us. In most cases they would\nbring him dead or dying or shot up or tortured, and he always, they would sit him in a chair\nand they put a sign 1n his hand, and the sign would read, hello, __-------. Hello, I have\nreturned. And then they would display this guy in a 36-inch space between the, by the gate.\nThere was a 36-inch space between, wire, wire space. They would sit the chair there and as\nyou marched in and out to work, you would have to look at that person. But with Vrba and\nwith Wetzler, and Walter Rosenberg who changed his name to Vrba, they didn't catch them.\nThey successfully escaped. We didn't believe it ourselves that they escaped. Because I\nremember one time, three Polish Jewish boys escaped, and they were gone for two days.\nAnd they got them. The Polish population would turn them in. See. They, we didn't have any\nfriends even then outside. And they brought these three Jewish boys in, and the law, the\npolicy of the camp was such that when there was someone brought back who escaped, there\nwas a public hanging. The whole camp had to be involved in that, had to watch it. And Nazi\nwould beat his drum, and the other guy behind him would read a, read a sentence, why he\nhad sinned against Third Reich. And who were the people who did the hanging? They would\ntake prisoners, put hoods over them, over the prisoners, that did, not only the ones that were\nhanged, but did the hanging. And these three Jews, Polish Jewish boys were hung. In public.\nThere were, Sundays were the hanging days. That was common, very common. There was a\nsingle gallows that was, they built the gallows for more than one. And some of them sang\nand yelled the last words. You know, revenge, and I remember one Polish Jewish boy said,\n, the Polish national anthem. He started yelling it. I stayed in\nBirkenau until October 21st, 1944, when again, an order came in the middle of the night that\nwe're being transferred. Pitch dark, you couldn't see two feet in front of you. Of course, the\ndarkness was because of the bombers come. You could hear the bombers already then. You\ncould hear fire, gunfire. We didn't know anything really. We were, the only thing we knew\nhow, when the war was bad, when it got worse, it got worse for us. Less food, more beatings,\nmore killings, more eliminating, more, more, uh, trying to, uh, cover up, more, the evidence.\nOf course, we didn't know that either. We just seen when it was bad for them, it was worse\nfor us.",
        "Q: ...1n'44. We have a picture here of you with a Hungarian transport. Can you talk a little\nabout that?",
        "A: Yes. Of course, I didn't know this photo existed. This is from an original from the Nazi\ndocumentation department. This photo was taken in May, May 1944. And it's a photo I'm\none, I don't know if I can point it out which one I am. Which, what, I can't tell from this side.",
        "Q: Turn it around and find yourself.",
        "A: Oh, excuse me. OK. Here on this end, I'm one of the persons unloading the belongings of\nHungarian Jews that were brought there, May 1944, that already been gassed. This came\nfrom the zunda (ph), from the gas chambers, from the undressing rooms. This photo, by the\nway, was given to me by historian, Czech historian, Czechoslovakian historian, Jewish man.\nHis name is Erich Kulka. Erich Kulka had this photo and he used this at one time in\nGermany in a court to identify a Nazi. And there were two boys in there that were cut in, in,\nin, in the court, and I was already living in Detroit at the time of course at the time when this\nwas going on. Detroit, Michigan. And there, here, here we are unloading the belongings of,\nuh, Hungarian Jews that were brought to Auschwitz, Birkenau actually. This photo was\ngiven to me, uh, in, uh, June 1981 when I attended the, uh, World Gathering of holocaust\nsurvivors in Jerusalem. Erich Kulka lives in Jerusalem. He knew I was alive, and when I got\nback to my hotel, there was a message for me to call Erich Kulka with a phone number. Of\ncourse, I didn't know who Erich Kulka was, because Erich Kulka's name in Auschwitz...he\nchanged his name after the war. His name was Schoen, S - C - H - O with two dots - E-N.",
        "Q: (inaudible)",
        "A: Erich Kulka, as I told you, was named Schoen. He's from the Czech part of Czechoslovakia.\nHe was brought to Auschwitz, I believe it was November 1942, and he came from\nNeuengamme, from another concentration camp. Erich Kulka and I became friends in\nAuschwitz. I was one of the persons that would bring Erich Kulka food and material to give\nto the people. Erich Kulka had as workers, as a, as an electrician. He doubles his job in the\ncamp, locksmith; he did locksmith work, he and an another person named Otto Kraus. And I\ngot friendly with these two boys, not just myself but other boys. And we would bring them\nthe materials to help our people. And Erich had more of a freedom, not a freedom in\nAuschwitz, but he could move because of his assignment as a locksmith, he could go from\ncamp to camp. Of course, he couldn't go away from the complex but, because it was all\nlocked in, fenced in. So when I had the message to call Erich Kulka, I called the name and\nthen he told me, \"Miso, my name is Erich Schoen. My name was Erich Schoen.\" What he\ndid, he changed his name. Took his wife's maiden name. His wife was killed. She also was in\nAuschwitz and then transferred to another camp in Germany, Stuttgart, Germany, and she\nwas murdered there. She died there. As I told you, I stayed in Auschwitz until October 1944.\nWe were put into cattle cars. We thought for sure that's the end of us. Two other boys, two of\nmy partners, Buchler was one and Ziedler (ph) was the other one, were also taken. We came\nto Oranienburg, which is Sachsenhausen. They didn't have any room for us. They had to let\nus sleep on the street of the camp. And the American bombers and the British bombers were\nbombing Berlin. Sachsenhausen is very, very close to Berlin. And we didn't know it then of\ncourse. We only knew, the only thing we knew we were in a camp and what's going to\nhappen to us next we didn't know. From there, because there was no room for us, we went to\nDachau. We got to Dachau, practically the same thing. Not much room there either. So the\nlast camp they took us to was called Landsberg. And there we stood until March 1945 when\nthe Allied were very close, I don't know how many kilometers, but they were close. We\nheard the bombs. We heard, uh, we heard the shootings. So they started to evacuate that\ncamp.",
        "Q: When they evacuate, tell me about Landsberg.",
        "A: Landsberg. Landsberg was also a dirty wooden camp built like in bunkers. The, the barracks\nwere very low, built like in, like, like in down...almost like bunkers. Landsberg was horribly,\nterribly lice infected. Which all camps were by the way. You could put your hand under you\narm and just throw lice out like this. But Landsberg had, had awful diseases. No crematories,\nno burial places. Just dig a ditch and that was it. And you carried these bodies like, like\nsardines. And we did nothing in Landsberg as far as labor.",
        "Q: No Canada Kommando?",
        "A: Uh, there was no Canada Kommando. We went out to work on farms. OK. The farms, we\nworked the German farms. They didn't have much. They had potato rows, you know,\ncovered with dirt. That's how, I worked in that. And the food was hardly non-existent. And\nwhen we started to move from Landsberg, there were a bunch of German prisoners in\nLandsberg. And I know of two of them who were given SS uniforms, to be our guards.\n(Laughter) I remember the two, Kapo Hantz (ph). His name was, he was a Kapo, Kapo\nHantz. He got a German uniform, he became the guard. They gave him a rifle. And we\nstarted marching. And we marching and some of the older prisoners, uh, older German\nguards, as we were marching we had, there was a wagon always behind to pick up the\nbodies. As we were marching, you know, picking up the bodies, the Germans would come to\nyou and they say, sign that I was good to you. Sign that I helped you. You know, I gave you\nbread. And of course none of, none of us did. You know, believe me, none of us did. By then\nwe, we had a feeling either we going to be all die, all killed, or some of us will survive.\nDuring an American air raid, daytime air raid, American bombers come down bomb\ndaytime, we all run in the ditches--including Nazis--and we made a human SOS. And myself\nand two other boys ran for the woods. I never forget that human SOS. That was so beautiful.",
        "Q: Did the bombers move away?",
        "A: The bombers didn't go after us. The bombers were hitting some, some target. They had a\ntarget because we could see. The bombers were going real low. So, I disappeared with the\nother two boys. And no one even cared anymore then. Because we've seen Nazis running.\nWe've seen, in the woods, we've seen Nazis running. We got into a farm house. And we got\nold civilian clothes, whatever we could find, and shed the clothes.",
        "Q: Were there people in the farm house?",
        "A: (inaudible) We knocked on the, you know, they, the Germans knew already who we were\nthen you know because they were afraid of, they were afraid of their own shadows. Your\nknow, there were no men, no men folk home.",
        "Q: They let you in?",
        "A: They let us. We got some shirt, a side room. I got a shirt, big farmer's shirt (laughter) and a\npair of old boots that didn't fit. And that's how we walked around. Took two weeks about\nwhen I was picked up by the United States Army. Seven - yes?",
        "Q: What did you do in those two weeks?",
        "A: Just walked the woods and eat whatever we could find. Knock on farm, farm windows and\nfarm doors. Cooked potatoes in the wooded area. Seen Nazis running left and right. Soldiers\nrunning with no rifles at all. Uh, we seen them going without any, any of their markings, just\nplain uniform. They threw away their, their sergeant's stripes, whatever they had.",
        "Q: Tell me....",
        "A: Three GI's in a jeep met me on the street, on, on the road. And I went with them. They took\nme with them. The other two boys went east someplace. They disappeared. We split. And I\nwas picked up which was then the 774 Tank Battalion. These boys brought me with them,\ncleaned me up, gave me a pair of fatigues. Didn't speak a word of English, not one word. But\none of the boys was a Polish national. He was born in United States, Chicago boy, and he\nspoke Polish. And one was a cook in the Army, the other guy. And they took me in and I\nworked as, as, in the field kitchen, Army field kitchen. And I stayed with this outfit from\nGermany to Czechoslovakia, all the way to Czechoslovakia. From Czechoslovakia, this\noutfit was on the way back. In World War II there were point system. They had enough\npoints to go home. The Army point system. If you had, if you've been in the Army such and\nsuch long time, if you have so many children, you have points for each child. And this outfit\nwas on the way back home. So I'm with them all the way through.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: Great. Well, I learned English real quick, real fast. While I was with the United States forces,\nof course the Stars and Stripes were a great teacher for me, and I remember there was a\nteacher in this outfit who was teaching me English. And we lived in tents by the way. There\nwere no, no barracks. Army tents and this, they would teach me English. This guy made me\nread the Stars and Stripes aloud.",
        "Q: The newspaper Stars and Stripes?",
        "A: The newspaper Stars and Stripes. And then he would tell, teach me how to write, how to read\nEnglish, how to pronounce some of the hard words. And I do have a good ear for languages.\nI pick them up quite, quite easily. I stayed with this unit. Of course, food was there.",
        "Q: What was it like to taste the first food and know you could have it, as much as you wanted?",
        "A: Well, uh, when you line up for chow, which was Army chow, we all got mess kits. And I\nwas like a soldier, I had everything what they had. And you line up and in the morning. In\nthose days we had fresh eggs because it was all farms, and the GI's would pick up the eggs\nfrom where ever they, whatever community they were at. They would send out a mess\nsergeant with someone to look for food. And of course the Army had food shipped to them.\nWe had powder eggs, but in, in this unit, because most field units they would find chickens,\nthey would find eggs, in, in the farms. And when you had enough food, when they were\ncooking, you could eat all you wanted and the baked biscuits and the baked rolls, you know.\nYou couldn't believe your eyes. And what, what, how much they would throw away. What\nwas this, waste so much, I just, just couldn't understand it. You know, coming from where I\ncame from, I see. Then we would get fresh fruit, fresh oranges, they would ship us bananas. I\nsaid, oh, my God. You know. It was amazing. Now. So I stayed with this unit all the way\nthrough Germany, Czechoslovakia, then back. Oh, we were stationed once in, one part in\nNuremberg. OK. Nuremberg is where the big stadium is where Hitler, the Olympics. This is\nwhere he had the big, huge, huge staditum. And the GI's used to play baseball there. So we\nused to go watch the baseball games there. Which I knew nothing about. (Laughter) I knew\nnothing.",
        "Q: Describe your first contact with American baseball.",
        "A: Well, I, there was a guy named Shoemaker, a soldier in my outfit, and he would play catch\nwith these guys before game, you know. This was, these were guys that were good, good\nbaseball players. You couldn't prove it by me, but they were good baseball players. And\nShoemaker had always had a baseball mitt with him. He came, traveled with that, he carried\nit all the time with him. And he would play, he would play catch with the guys. And I was a\nsoccer player. I didn't know anything about baseball. I would kick the darn thing. (Laughter)\nAnd I found out you can't kick a baseball. Real quick. And then we would go to Nuremberg.\nWe went to Nuremberg to watch a baseball game, a real baseball game. Yeah. And of\ncourse, what I was always most afraid of was doctors. That was the biggest thing that scared\nme. Dentists was most. Fear of dentists.",
        "Q: How did you deal with it?",
        "A: Ah, very badly. They took me to a dentist. As a matter of fact, the Shoemaker guy took me to\na dentist. Because I had an abscessed tooth. And all my gums were pretty well dried up, uh,\nfrom malnutrition; and they took me to a dentist. And I remember, they gave me a capsule\nand I took the capsule and opened it and took the powder in my hand out, you know. I didn't\nknow how to deal with it, the guy didn't tell me what to do with it. That was horrible. And I\nran away from the dentist chair I was so scared. I never forget that. I ran away from the\ndentist chair. When we got back to France. .. Yes?",
        "Q: How did they fix the abscessed tooth if you couldn't stay in the chair?",
        "A: They didn't. They didn't. They didn't.",
        "Q: You lost the tooth?",
        "A: Oh yeah, lost most of them. They didn't. I was deathly afraid of it. I was so much afraid of\ndoctors. I never trusted any of them. Never trusted, as a matter of fact, the biggest problem\nwas not trusting anyone. Always, always being afraid there's someone behind you. Some,\nyou always figure the Nazis will come after you. You looked, you always look behind you. It\nwas in the camps, if you didn't take you cap off in front of a Nazi you got beat. If you did\ntake your cap off in front of a Nazi you got beat. They would, they would call you all the\ntime and ask you, come over here. Do you know what day it is? They would always pick a\nJewish holiday. But 1f you told them you knew what day it was, if you didn't tell them what\nday, it didn't make any difference. Same thing. So my fear was with me a long time. My trust\ndidn't come back to me for, oh my God, for, forever almost. But I was very, very lucky that I\nwas picked up in the outfit I was picked up in. Because when we got back to France, we\ncame to a camp called Camp Lucky Strike. And Camp Lucky Strike was a camp for all the\nGI's that were on the way home. It was like a tent city. The whole camp was loaded with\ntents, and the GI's would stay here until their their turn came to be taken to Le Havre, France\nto be put on a ship to go home. So one of the guys took a picture of me and this, this is me in\nthe Army, and this was the (conversation) this was the, the first American picture I have of\nmyself in an American uniform. And I stayed in this Camp Lucky Strike until September\n1945 when my outfit was taken to Le Havre, France and me with them, to be put on a ship, a\ntroop carrier called \"James Parker\". And our commanding officer whose name was Lt.\nColonel Conrad B. Sturgis (ph), a West Point man, he practically made the decision to put\nme on the ship with the unit, with unit and take me home. Home where? Oh, by the way, I'm\ngoing to have to retrack a little bit because I didn't tell you. By then, I already knew of the\nfamily I had left. My father's youngest sister lived in Detroit, Michigan. I didn't know, I\nknew she was in America, but I didn't know where, see. But nothing was done yet in 1945,\nSO...",
        "Q: How could you have found out where she was?",
        "A: Well, I gave the Army her name, her married name, because this is where by sister went to\nschool in Vienna. She was from Vienna. And she arrived in the United States in 1939. And\nmy father's younger sister whose name was Ethel Shotten, S - H -O-T-T-E-N. She was\nmarried to a man named Rudy, Rudolph Shotten. So when I gave the names to the Army, the\nArmy and the Red Cross started to look. Put ads in the paper. Here we have this and this guy,\nborn such and such a place, area, and then I would say about two or three months later, I get\na letter from my aunt. Where she lived. So the commanding officer came to me and said, oh,\nyou got your ad, you know. What we'll do with you, we'll put you on a ship and when you,\nwe're going to Boston, they were originally, the ship, the, the United, the, the force, the the\noutfit was going to Boston. And they were going to be mustered out. In the Army, they\nmuster you out. And then, from there you go to, to Detroit and report yourself to, to\nImmigration Authorities he told. Well, we had a captain whose name was Captain Yogurling\n(ph); and he was a lawyer, an attorney at home. And he says, \"Don't do this. Because if you\ntake him there, they're going to deport him. He has to have papers and everything else.\" So\nwhat he did, before the ship sailed, they got my belongings, my duffel bag and everything\nthat I owned, and the boys took up a collection. And I got, we had already changed our\nmoney, our money was already changed into American dollars...",
        "Q: Did you have money?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Where did you get it?",
        "A: Well, from the Army would give me \"X\" amount of dollars, you know, from the, from the\ncooks and from the captains. See, I worked the mess, the mess hall for the officers; and\nthe...the colonel took a liking to me and, and he called me \"Czechsky (ph).\" So I was like his\norderly so to speak. So they they took up a collection, and, and I had enough dollars to you\nknow. So Captain Yogurling calls Camp Home Run which is in Le Havre, we were in Le\nHavre already then, now we are at the docks, OK, to be shipped. Calls up the commanding\nofficer in Le Havre, and they take me in there. And he says since you've got your aunt here,\nin the meanwhile nothing was done with my aunt other than a couple of letters, and I wrote\nto her and she wrote to me, and my, this was in September of, uh, uh, and I'd already found\nher. November 29th is my birthday so my aunt sent me a, a Bulova watch for my birthday.\nSo that was my birthday present from my aunt, my first present. And they say they're\nworking, I shouldn't be impatient and so on. In the meanwhile, while I'm in Camp Home\nRun, October 1945, myself and a, a Spaniard, a Spanish national, two of us, was sworn into\nthe United States forces. We were sworn in by, by a major. A colonel. By a colonel, I'm\nsorry. And I had the papers for me ... I showed them to you. And when we were sworn in,\nand, uh, the other person, person's name was Raymond de la Fontana Quintas (ph). The only\nthing they made an error. They swore us in under regular Army form. So, there are two\nArmies, the peace Army is the United States Armed, you know, the Army that you, you, you\nare, uh, have to join when something happens like in the war you, you join, you are forced to\njoin the service. You, you are being, uh, uh, elected to join the service. Like during the war,\nthey, they take us in. And the other thing is the regular Army you have to be, a foreign, a\nnon-citizen cannot join the regular Army. So the War Department sent our papers back.\nAttached to the papers were the proper papers. But in the meanwhile my aunt was working\non my, uh, coming to the United States. So the colonel says to me, you don't want to join\nnow, cause you're going to be shipped to the Pacific to replace the forces. So this, that's what\nhappened to Raymond de la Fontana Quintas. He was sent to Far East and he became a\nregular Army person. He joined after, I mean he joined the Army of the United States, and\nafter that, he become a citizen, boom, right, right now. After you, after you're sworn you're\nnow a - they also swore you in as a citizen in those days, in war time. So, I didn't join. But\nthey gave me a job at Camp Home Run, in the, in the camp, to be in charge of the officers'\nlaundry and dry cleaning. And dry cleaning was done with gasoline. You soak it in gasoline,\nand then you hang it up. That was the dry cleaning. Laundry was done in, in, in the wash\ntubs, and I was in charge of that. And I stayed there until my aunt wrote a letter that there is a\nvery strong possibility that I will be able to come sometime in the Spring of 1946. They're\nworking on it. The only thing is she said you need, you need all the papers. You got to have a\npassport, you got to have a birth certificate. And I had none of that, see. So the Army gave\nme a furlough to go my home town. And that wasn't easy either, because I was in France,\nand Slovakia was in a Russian zone. So I got to Regensburg, Germany, and there the Army,\nuh, applied for the Russian zone, to let me come, to let me go across to Slovakia on the train.\nI come to my home town, which is Topol any. Go to City Hall, tell them who I was. They\ntell me, \"All Jewish records were destroyed.\" But they knew who I was. So I got nothing.\nGot back on the train. Came to Paris. Went to the Czechoslovakian Embassy; and they gave\nme a passport, no birth certificate. Went back to Le Havre, to Camp Home Run; told the\ncaptain what happened, told the chaplain what happened, and they all started to work on all\nmy papers. I got a judicial record from the Army, a record of what I did in the Army, and\nthat the uh Ambassador should uh accept this because of I, and my stay in a concentration\ncamp and all the records were destroyed. However, passport I got from Czechoslovakian\nEmbassy. That's the only legal paper. You know how I got this passport? I gave the guy a\ncarton of cigarettes, I remember that. And I needed three photos. So in Paris he tells me\nwhere there is a photographer on the street. Right around the, the Embassy 1s this, you get\nthree photos over there. And I, I looked like a scarecrow in Army uniform and, and, and in\nfact, I, I, I, this is the uniform I took a picture, my passport picture in. So I ran, you know,\nthis this is the kind of uniform, this, this 1s what, this is a little better. The other one I look\nlike a scarecrow. So I got this, everything together. Come back to the Ambassador. I gave\nhim a carton of cigarettes, he gave me the passport. Went back to Le Havre from Paris. Now\nI'm ready to go. Now I'm waiting for my aunt to get all, everything together.",
        "Q: We have three minutes. Let's pull it together.",
        "A: OK. So what happened, I got to Le Havre. The captain made arrangement for me to go\noutside of Paris, a place called Maison Lafitte, to live with a Red Cross Field Director,\nwaiting for my aunt's, all, everything the Army had done for me. And May 10th, 1946, I got\non a plane. Came to New York, came to some friends that knew my family. From there I\nwent to Detroit. And about a year later, I had met a young woman, young lady, also survivor,\nwhom I married a year later. We are now the proud parents of four children and four\ngrandchildren. And as we say, uh, among the survivors, from ashes to life. (Pause) This was\ntougher than, uh, tougher than talking, than lecturing, I'll tell you. (PAUSE) I couldn't take\nany more of it.\n(Conversation)",
        "Q: Could we just do the pictures?",
        "A: What pictures do you want to do?",
        "Q: All the ones...",
        "A: We didn't do this one.",
        "Q: Hold that one up just so he gets it and describe what it is?",
        "A: Uh, this what the Nazis called the Orchestra Platz, the Orchestra Place where the band, the\nfinest musician, uh, Jewish musicians, from every European country, would play at the\nentrance to the, in and out of the camp, as we were marching to and from work.\n(Technical Conversation - Pauses)",
        "A: Which one should I show next?",
        "Q: Uh, let's do it in order. Let's do the camp...",
        "A: How's is that. This 1s the original crematorium in Auschwitz I. Which by the way 1s still\nstanding. Very primitive. The ones they built after that were the death factories in Birkenau.\nAuschwitz II. Oh, there's a small photo--I don't know if you can do anything with that at all.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nThis was the first American unit that I ran across that, I got this in Dachau, outside of\nDachau, and one of the GI's gave it to me. And I've been carrying it ever since. As you can\nsee, the cattle cars there, this is where all the bodies were unloaded. Of course, they un,\nunloaded by the, the Germans. The GI's brought the Germans to, to show them what what\nwas going on, like they didn't know. (Pause) Well, this is the entrance to hell. This is\nAuschwitz, entrance to Auschwitz, \"Arbeit Macht Frei,\" which by the way, Birkenau also\nhad a sign, \"Arbeit Macht Frei.\" They all had \"Arbeit Macht Frei.\" But this 1s the first one\nthat I've seen, I'm, that I came to. (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) All right. This - the\nhappy times, the American Army and Mike Vogel.",
        "Q: Next picture.",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "Q: You have one more. Of you in the Army.",
        "A: Oh, the tent city! My goodness gracious. Well, I should have shown that one first. This is in\nCamp Lucky Strike. This in France, in a farm country in France, that we waited for to be\ntaken to Le Havre, France to be loaded on to ships to go back to the United States, except I\nstayed for another few months.\nEnd of tape #2\nTAPE #3\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: We're picking up with the third tape, and we're going back, and you had started to tell me\nduring the break, uh, about Heinrich Himmler coming to the camp. Could you tell me about\nHimmler and tell me about the preparations for him?",
        "A: Yes, uh, this was before Birkenau was built. Actually, they were building Birkenau. We\ndidn't know it, I didn't know it at the time, what was going on. But Himmler came there, and\nbefore Himmler came to Auschwitz, the camp had to be cleaned from, from top to bottom.\nThe streets of the camp were swept. They got rid of all the Muselmanns, all the skeleton-type\npeople. And we all went to be disinfected. We didn't know why. We didn't know who\nHimmler, we didn't even know, we knew of Himmler from before, but we didn't know why\nhe was coming or what was the reason. The only thing we knew that it was a big, big Nazi\nofficer coming and we were beaten by our Blockaltesters to get, get to the disinfectant area.\nAnd this is the way they disinfected us. They would take our clothes and put them, take them\naway from us and gave us new sets of striped uniforms with our numbers sewn back on the\nleft breast and the right, right pant leg. And we went to a disinfecting area. Small shower,\nshower with hardly, hardly any water pressure, but they would swoosh (ph), swoosh (ph),\nswoosh (ph), spritz (ph) us, uh, with some sort of a disinfectant, and then they would dress\nup, and when the time came from, for Heinrich Himmler, for the big-wig Nazi, to come to\nAuschwitz, to the, right to the camp, we were all lined up in front of our barracks, in front of\nour blocks. The Blockaltester made sure that we're standing straight, we're clean, and he\nfound one Polish Jew, Jewish boy, one of the buttons was missing of his tunic, of his jacket.\nAnd this Blockaltester, Mietek was his name, M -I- E- T-E-K. Mietek. He was a\nmurderer. He was a Polish, uh, uh, murderer. He was our Blockaltester, and he, he pride\nhimself that he could kill one person with a blow to the proper area in his neck. So he could\nkill him. And this poor, poor Jewish prisoner, Jewish boy got murdered with one blow and\ntaken away from there. And the camp was standing still, holding for Heinrich Himmler to\ncome and inspect the camp. I will never forget. I, I, in my time in Auschwitz, Himmler came\ntwice to Auschwitz, but I will never forget with this happening in my block, this, this murder\nin front of my block when Mietek, Mietek murdered him. And there were number, there\nwere more than one person like that. There was one other, a German prisoner they used to\ncall Monkey Tin (ph). He was another one. Mietek and Monkey Tin would have a bet who\ncan kill more people with one blow. And that's...this was Himmler's visit to Auschwitz.\nThat's how they cleaned up the camp. First, they got rid of all the people that didn't look well\nenough. The streets were swept, the barracks were cleaned. Of course, Himmler never went\ninto the barrack. The only thing, he came is just march with the Lageraltester whose name\nwas Rudolph Hoess by the way.\u201d Rudolph Hoess was the commandant of Auschwitz. And\nthis commandant of Auschwitz, Mr. Rudolph Hoess, would walk with Heinrich Himmler\nand other lieutenants, their... their lieutenants, and just go from barrack to barrack on the\n* Rudolph Hoess was the commandant of Auschwitz.\ninspection. Yes ma'am.",
        "Q: We would also be talking about Mengele and could you tell us about your meetings with\nMengele? I gather you did so often.",
        "A: Yes, well, Mengele arrived to Birkenau, not to Auschwitz, in May 1943. I still remember\nwhen, uh, there too a big fuss was made about the doctors. The doctors were the ones.\nBecause 1n all the Krankenbaus, all the, all the sick bays, where ever they put prisoners, there\nnever doctors. The only reason doctors came there is to make a selection in who was no\nlonger was fit to be kept alive or selected to go to the gas chambers. And they had a holding,\nthey was a 7, 11 block in Birkenau. Block 7 in Auschwitz. And this 1s the block that they\nwould take prisoners that were already on their way, on the to the gas chambers, gas\nchambers. And they would hold them there until they had enough, and then they would just\nwalk them in Birkenau to, to the crematorias. So, but mostly I remember Mengele, first about\nthe Mengele selections in the camp, OK. Of course, we didn't know when the selection\nwould be. But all of a sudden, in most cases on a Sundays, cause everyone was in, in the\ncamp. The whole camp was taken out to Appellplatz, to roll call place, lined up in rows of\nfive, stripped naked, and your clothing was dropped by you in front of your feet. And\nMengele, with the, with the Lager... Lageraltester, who was a prisoner, and the Lagerfuhrer,\nand also the commandant; they would go from barrack to barrack, block to block. And\nbehind Mengele was a prisoner registrar--a Schreiber what they called--and as Mengele\nwould, this is how, how it would be. You in a row of five, always in rows of five. The first\nfive, step forward. Mengele would walk in front and in back. As he walked this way, left or\nright, left or right, and those who picked up their clothing were still staying alive, because,\nwe didn't know, we found out later how it worked. First, first time, second time, you didn't\nknow which, what was going on. If you living or if you going to die now. Those who left\ntheir clothing were taken into a holding block and Mengele's selections would last practically\nall day because by the time he completed - Birkenau was a huge camp - by the time he\ncompleted the whole camp, OK, after he finished the camp, those who of course the clothing\nstayed behind were taken into another block and waited until everybody was taken from all,\nthe whole camp, then they were standing there. You could hear them yell, scream, and beg\nfor water, beg for, for help. They knew where they were going see. See, and those of us who\nstayed, we picked up our clothing. Then with whips and sticks by the SS and by the Kapos\nand by the Blockaltester, by the Stubedienst, all the big-wigs of the prisoners and the SS, we\nwere beaten into a, uh, shower area. And we bundled our clothing with a piece of wire with\nthe number outside and threw them in a huge gas chamber, in, in a room, where Zyklon B\ngas was put on the clothing to disinfect the clothing. They disinfected the clothing while they\ndisinfected us. Spray a little water and they sprayed us with some disinfecting, uh, water,\nsome sort of a disinfecter. And then they opened the gas chamber, the room where, where\nthe clothing was, and you started looking for your clothing. But the gas fumes were still\nthere. And I'll never forget, I got weak and dizzy from the gas fumes one time. And, uh, I\nwas fainting and my friend, Buchler and Fisher, which I mentioned before, grabbed me\nunder their arms and took me outside and ran me back and forth, breathing for air. And that's\nhow they got me through. That's how I came out of that. I already had enough gas in me so\nif, if those two boys weren't there I wouldn't be alive. I would have died right there. So we\npicked up our clothing, we put our clothing on, were taken back to the barracks, back to our\nown blocks. The other thing I remember about Mengele very vividly is when the transports\nwere coming in. He was the one who would be in charge at the railroad, at the siding, at, at\nwhat they, the Nazis called it the Rampe, the ramp. When he came to the ramp, the first thing\nhe would do when he, when he, he had the people lined up, the able-bodied ones, he would\nget rid of those first. He would ask them, how old are you, what is your profession, what is\nyour name, , what is your profession and how old are you. And\nleft, right, left, right and so on. After he got rid of all these, of course, another thing he was\nlooking, pregnant women and twins. We really didn't know what he was doing with them at\nthe time. But he would, he called them \"Schlingen\" (ph) [Zwillingen?], the twins. He would\ntake the twins into his area. I would see Mengele every transport and especially in early May\n1944 when the Hungarian Jews were brought in. When the Hungarian Jews came, Mengele\nwas there constantly. He had a motorcycle, and he would ride in the camp, up and down the\ncamp, just looking, on the motorcycle, looking for anything that he wanted to look at. Of\ncourse, we didn't know what he was looking at. Always afraid of this man. I can still\nremember his, his piercing eyes and he'll, he'll, Mengele had dark hair and when he, when\nhe, there were two people that we were deathly afraid of. Actually three. Palich (ph) was\none. Palich was another one who was. He, Palich actually did this. Palici's favorite thing was\nto do to line people up in Auschwitz--Auschwitz I-- against the wall to see how many he\ncould kill with one bullet. A friend of mine, close friend of mine, knew of Palish quite well. I\ndidn't know much about Palish except I knew who he was, that he was a murderer, and he\nalso ride, rode a motorcycle. He would line up people, two three people in a row, see how\nmany he could kill with one bullet. Lined them up together. And the third person, who also\ncame in '43, actually end of '43 I think, whose name was Hauptsturmfthrer Moll, M - O - L -\nL. He became in charge of the crematorias. And also, he also was the mentor of the pits, the\npits that they were digging because the crematorias couldn't, couldn't hold enough people,\nburn and gas enough people fast enough. So he used the pits to burn the people. But the pits\ndidn't work well. Because I remember the Greek transports that came and and he, he took\nsome of the Greek boys working the pits and with bare feet they were, they were stomping\nthe hot ashes for after the people, the hot coals after the people were, were burned tn there.\nAnd the bodies just kept, kept coming back up.",
        "Q: To come back to, you were talking before about twins. You had mentioned a particular set of\ntwins.",
        "A: There was a French set of twins, French boys. One was already there already, Mengele\nalready had him. And, I remember when they came for the second set...second guy, second\nperson, the second twin, this poor boy yelled and screamed. Oh yeah, I still...I can still just\nabout hear his screaming, screeching, as they were taking him. The Nazis came, the SS came\nto take this guy to Mengele. And they took him. That's the last time we've seen him. He was\ncastrating the boys, lot of boys, too.",
        "Q: Did you actually see any of the experiments?",
        "A: No, I didn't. No. None of us have. There, oh, I shouldn't say none of us have. There was\nsome doctors, prison doctors that worked with Mengele, but of course, we didn't, we didn't\nhave anything to do with that.",
        "Q: What happened with the pregnant women? Do you know?",
        "A: Only what I heard from, from people that were connected, that he was, uh, trying to, uh, uh,\nforce the labor out, to pull the babies out of...out of their wombs. I heard that from from other\npeople. And we knew girls that that worked...worked in Canada that also knew some girls\nthat worked closer to the, to the Krankenbau area so a lot of times when Mengele worked in\nsome of the sick, sick bay - he had a room, he had rooms there where he did the\nexperimentation.",
        "Q: You talked about one other person, um, and that is the man whom you identified for OSI.\nCan you talk about him and give us his full name and what did he do? What did you testify?",
        "A: His full name is Hans Lipsky (ph). He's a Latvian. Latvian national. He was an SS guard in\nAuschwitz. He worked the railroad sidings where transports came. He was a murderer. He\nwas a killer. To him, I...l remember, not only him but people like him, when transports came,\ntransports came, we would sometimes unload the children. And take them off the train, off\nthe cattle car. I remember one of the boys holding a little child, a little baby, and he takes out\nhis pistol and shoots the baby in the, in the prisoner's hand. There was another one,\nUntersturmfuhrer Otto. There was a Graff and another one whose name was Hans. Hans\nwould whistle, uh...uh, operas, and at the same time would murder these poor people coming\noff the train. Just right on the tracks. Right on the railroad siding. This guy would sing and,\nand murder. I seen him once kick a kid like a soccer ball, when the kid was crying. Kicked\nhim from his mother's arms. And Hans Lipsky was a guard. He was not an officer, he was\njust a guard. A murderer, like most of them were. And most of these people when they, those\nwho guarded the the tracks and railroad siding, would be drinking before they got there so\nthat they were fortified, so that they could do, do this job better. That was their ration, this\nbooze. And and I remember they they all had flasks with whiskey in it and they would just\ndrink enough so they could be practically immune to anything that was going on. So I\nidentified Hans Lipsky. It's been five years now. Uh, from the OSI came a person who was at\nthe time the Assistant Director; because then there was Ryan, who was the main person, and\nNeal Sher was in command. He got my name from some, some other Auschwitz survivors,\nand he asked me if I could come to Washington to identify this person. I said, well I don't\nthink I can get away you know, so fast, so he said I must travel to see some people, could I\ncome to Indianapolis. This is where I live. Could you meet me at the airport. So he came on\na Saturday afternoon, and I met him at the airport, and he identified themselves. He checked\nin, and then we went to his room, and in his room, he started to investigate. Started to\nactually interrogate me like I was one of the prisoners, one of the Nazis, the way he was\ngoing about it. And, uh, after, he wrote everything, whatever I told him, he, he had it down,\nhe had a tape, and one of the last things that he did, in his briefcase, he had eight mug shots\nof people. And he told me, I want you to study these mug shot, mug shots, and if you can\nidentify anyone, I want you to put your finger on it and hold it there and I'll let you know\nwhat to do next. I looked at this mug shots, photo of eight, eight mug shots, and\nthey were marked from one to eight. And I looked, and I put my finger on number three.\nAnd I said, here is your man. And if I remember what I said to him, I said, and this is, this\nguy's name is Hans. And he said to me, Mr. Vogel, I want you to sign your full name under\nthis photo, and date it. And all the other ones I want you to initial and date. And after I\ncompleted the, the paper work, he says to me, you have identified Hans Lipsky who's going\nto be tried in Chicago on such and such and such a time and so on. And the trial was due to\nbe the day after Christmas. And on my way to work I was listening to NPR, National Public\nRadio, and they mentioned that Hans Lipsky elected to be deported instead of going to trial.\nHe was deported to West Germany. When I got to work I got a call from Neal Sher's office.\nThis Eli Rosenbaum was working for Sher and he gave me the call. He says, there is no trial.\nHans Lipsky elected to be deported. He is being deported to West Germany. He's been by\nhimself to West Germany but we do want you to know that if in case there is going to be a\ntrial, would you be willing to go to West Germany. And that is the last, last thing I heard\nabout Hans Lipsky. He is probably living, ah, a life of Riley in West Germany.",
        "Q: Anything you want to add to the tape, recollections...?",
        "A: Well, I give you a Sunday life in Auschwitz, for instance. Sunday was the day of rest for the\nNazis, of course. But the damn day of rest was sport, sport with us. For us, it was shaving\neach other, trying to get clean; which was almost impossible because water was nonexistent\nin Birkenau. We shaved each other; and in summer time we tried to air our uniforms off,\ndelouse ourselves with our hands, but that was not allowed by the Nazis. They would come\nand do calisthenics with us. They would make us go on our down below and do frog jumps,\nfrog leaps. And then they would make us roll on the ground. Then roll back and forward. Do\npush-ups. Run. Get into the ditches into mud. Roll in the mud in the ditches. And if you\ndidn't do it fast enough, you got beaten. And then they would beat us up because we were\ndirty. Or muddy. Everyday in Auschwitz, you never knew when your number came up.\nAnother thing was to see when you went to work, when you went to slave labor, who was no\nlonger there. Who was, who's left. And it became, it became like, like, like an animal. Oh,\nI'm, I'm living another day, or he's, he's no longer, and and you know, the worst part, that you\ncouldn't cry for it. You couldn't cry. You couldn't cry in Auschwitz. You cried, you died. If\nyou, if you, 1f you show even more weakness than you already had, you didn't survive the\nday. You know, I remember once, here's another one. I got caught in Canada Kommando\npicking up sardines and giving it to a girl. Gave this sardines as I was carrying the bundle,\nNazi picks me up. And a Kapo came there and the Kapo starts slapping me around, starts\nbeating me. So, for punishment I was put into a Strafkommando [NB: punishment brigade].\nAnd how do I translate Strafkommando? Straf is a...1s you being punished, \"sin kommando.\"\nI don't know if it translates well in English. Always the Strafkommando consisted of, first of\nall, the Kapo of the Strafkommando was a murderer, a former German prisoner who was a\nmurderer. He was our Kapo, our leader. And the job was cutting seaweeds in water, with two\nof us. It was, was a chain saw, it was a saw on a chain, like a, like a, how would you call tt,\nlike , OK, that had sharp thing and you cut it. And what the Nazi would do\nbehind us, they would send a Kapo, a Unterkapo...an Unterkapo, his assistant, and they\nwould dunk our heads in the water to see how long we can stay in, under the water. I was\nthere for two weeks, and one of my friends paid off with a kind of riches, he paid off the\nproper people. And I was taken back into Canada Kommando. And when I came back the SS\nman who caught me, the greeting would be such: . Till next time,\nyou old bandit, you still alive. And they, in a way, they say, oh, this guy survived. They, they\nwere, you know, say, look, what else I can do with him. Another thing that you learned as\nyou became an older prisoner, to be at the right place at the right time, which was not easy.\nThey, Nazis, SS would say, . They would yell out, three men. You went, most\ncases one of you didn't return. They would kill you as you were doing some sort of work.\nAnd as you got an older, became an older prisoner, when an SS man called for three men,\nyou would say, , cause they always meant three plus you. You stayed behind,\nbecause if you went again, your first time. I've got a mark on my neck here. I was hit by a\nshovel, on my neck. I thought I was going to be killed. That mark is still there. Also, when\nthey called drei man, it was digging and wasn't digging fast enough, and the SS just hit me\nfull force on my neck. And they indented my neck, and its been there ever since Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Did you ever think of escape?",
        "A: No, no, I didn't. When these two boys escaped, and when anyone escaped, we were in a way\nnot happy about, about it. And again I must explain, we didn't know what was going on on\nthe outside world. But the reason we were not happy because we suffered. We had to stand\nand on roll call until this poor soul was either caught, murdered, and then we were all beaten\nanyway. Because the Kapos and Blockaltesters who were also out standing there at the roll\ncall with us, they would be the ones who beat us because the Jew escaped, see.",
        "Q: You had said before about the misconceptions about Canada Kommando. Did some people\nbelieve you? Could you talk about that and talk about the woman that you mentioned?",
        "A: Well, uh, now, uh, you know, after thirty years not speaking about my experiences, finally,\nour youngest daughter Elaine, who practically made me do what I'm doing today, speaking\non Holocaust, and the most important reason 1s because I want to bear witness because very\nsoon there will not be an Auschwitz survivor or Dachau survivor and then Auschwitz will\nonly be a legend. But I must be very blunt. I survived because of Canada Kommando. Good,\nbad or indifferent, I survived because I was assigned to work in Canada Kommando. But I\nmust say that Canada Kommando was not just a group that worked unloading people. We\nwere told before we went to the transport what is expected of us. If any one of us will ever\ndare to tell the people what is going on, will not live the day through. So now that I talk\nabout it and I tell them that I survived and the reason, everyone survived for a reason,\nbecause in Auschwitz the Nazi law said that was no one can survive longer than three\nmonths on the food, the hygiene, and the work and and the torturing that he gets longer than\nthree months. If you live longer than three months, you are doing something that is not\naccording to the camp's rules. You either get more food someplace. You do get more food\nsomeplace, or you have someone else helping you to to survive, see. So when I tell some\npeople about Canada, I told, I was Bloomington at the Indiana University a couple of years\nago, and I'm speaking to graduate students, a class of graduate students. They were learning\nHolocaust, teaching Holocaust there, and I told the group about Canada Kommando, and of\ncourse questions and answers are usually very strong, and I really am quite immune to the\nquestions because I answer them exactly, right from the shoulders. This young woman told\nme that her mother told her than the Canada Kommandos in her mind were murderers.\nMurderers, because when she arrived to Auschwitz, 1t was the Canada Kommando who lined\nthem up 1n rows of five and one of the Canada Kommando slapped her. And I said, \"It is\npossible, but a Canada Kommando person was only doing what he had to do. If he didn't do\nit he was shot right on the spot. He was murdered right on the spot. And I give you another\nexample, another little story. I remember a transport came from Theresienstadt, 1943. Early\nspring of 1943. And we were unloading this transport, busy, this was the busiest night I ever\nseen at the railroad, uh, siding. There was a young woman with a child with her. And the\nchild was restless and and crying, and the mother was trying to calm the baby, calm the\nchild--six, seven-year-old child. All of a sudden, the mother looks; and a Red Cross truck is\nmoving towards us. And she's telling the little girl, \"Oh, Red Cross is already here. Pretty\nsoon we will be in our place.\" And a young Jewish Slovakian boy ran by there; and he told\nthem, \"Lady, that's not Red Cross. Take a look behind. You see the chimney. In one hour's\ntime, you're going to be gassed. You're going to be burned.\" And she went and sees an SS\nofficer and tells him that, this woman. She tells the SS officer about this man: \"This man told\nus you're going to gas us, you're going to burn us.\" He said, \"Look, Lady, he's a criminal.\nDon't...he's going to be dealt with.\" And he dealt with he was; because after we had loaded\neverybody, we all went behind the cattle cars and slowly they murdered him. Everyone of\nthem just murdered the young boy slowly, just murdered the young boy slowly. Carried him\nback to Auschwitz on our shoulders. And the Red Cross truck. You know what the Red\nCross truck brought? The Zyklon B gas cans. That's how it was carried into Birkenau. So\nthat was the Red Cross truck. And there are so many things, you know, that...the...as I'm\ntalking to you, there's just, you know, for a survivor, every survivor has a story. Is a story.\nThe end is always, always the same. And every survivor survived because of something. Not\nbecause he was strong; because the strong ones were falling just as easy as, as the weak ones.\nAnd really, none of us believed you're going to survive that. It...it was...I'd been in\nAuschwitz two and a half years; and I was in--between Sachsenhausen, Auschwitz, Dachau,\nI was over three years just in concentration camp, plus so many months in, in, in Arbeitlagers\n(ph), work camps. So from 1939 to 1945, we all suffered and, uh, uh, because of the Nazi\nregime and you know, every survivor, we didn't believe that we're going to make it. There 1s\nno survivor that will tell you I'm going to survive Auschwitz. They never talked about it.\nYou know what the main, the most important thing was, to go to sleep at night with a full\nstomach, so if you die, you don't die hungry. Another thing was in Auschwitz,\n\"Organizierung\"-- organizing. We all had to organize. We all knew how to barter. And of\ncourse, the resistance group, see. People say the Jews, we the Jews walked into the gas\nchambers like lambs, like sheep. Believe me, those of us who were there a long time, we had\nan underground organization, without radios, without anything. Communications such as we\nall knew how to communicate from the other camps, somehow or other. For instance, there\nwas a Leichen (ph) Kommando, which was the people that picked up the dead. This man, he\nbuilt a wagon, he had a wagon, and he built a false bottom. This guy's name is Joe Newman\n(ph) and he lives in Skokie. And he would carry things to the girls' camp, information.\nInformation to person...you had him here not long ago, Erich Kulka. And Erich Kulka would\ncarry it from camp to camp to camp, and to the resisters. To the girls that worked in\nmunitions factory. Which was Kulka's job. Kulka did that. Kulka was the one who, uh, got\nthe girls from the munition factory. And they got enough gun powder so the\nSonderkommando blew up one of the crematorias. Of course, they were murdered\nunfortunately, they were killed.",
        "Q: Did you watch that?",
        "A: No, no. I did not. We knew about it but I did not. So you see, when, when people tell you\nthat, uh, uh, surviving, those that survived, they are, they are a story, that's a different breed,\nand especially those who were in Auschwitz as long as I have been, as long as, you know,\nmyself and the others, Kulka, Vrba.",
        "Q: Did you help to smuggle information and material?",
        "A: Absolutely. From, we used to bring...for the escapees, we used, we used to smuggle stuff in\nourselves.",
        "Q: Talk about that.",
        "A: Uh, clothing for them, so they have civilian clothes. And that would be given to group such\nas Kraus and Kulka, that type of stuff. Shoes. And we didn't know why. OK. They didn't tell\nus these tomorrow, you know, you never knew who would - there was a Hebrew word, a\nYiddish word \"moser.\" A \"moser\" is a guy who tells on someone, who goes and snitches on\nsomeone. There was snitches among us. And the reason there was snitches, again, selfish,\ntrying to survive that way. The Nazis, they didn't let them survive. They get their\ninformation, then they kill them.",
        "Q: Would you tell me the story, an incident where you smuggled things?",
        "A: I was very small, and my pants were kind of big. I would be lined with clothing, civilian\nclothing inside, after examining us, the clothing would be in an area as they put us in line,\nsome of us snuck in and you put the clothing in your pants. And we snuck it in and someone\nin the camp already knew that I had it. But you see, it was a dangerous thing to do. Because\nthe Canada Kommando was not only searched on the Canada grounds, we would also be\nsearched sometimes at the gate. See. And if you got caught you got killed.",
        "Q: Who did you get the clothing for?",
        "A: The clothing would be picked up by a courier like, like, not a prisoner, who couldn't wore\nthem anyway because he had to have a striped clothes like me. And he would take it to the\nperson that would be doing the escaping.",
        "Q: You helped on the black market too?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. There was a big black market there. Constantly.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: Uh, that was down with the civilians actually. Cause you couldn't black market much with,\nbarter with another prisoner. What could he give you? We would buy chicken sometimes.\nCooked chickens. From the Polish civilians. The ones that worked in Auschwitz. Vodka was\nbrought into the camp. Cigarettes. For gold, for diamonds, watches, which we, which we\ntook from the Canada Kommando. You know, American dollars was a very common thing\nin Auschwitz. Thousand dollar bills, hundred dollar bills, there was nothing to it. Twenty\ndollar gold pieces you would find in the clothing. And this was all survival of the fittest.\nSurvival of the people that thought maybe, maybe, maybe. Never believe you're going to\nmake it, but there was always a slight, slight glimmer of hope. What are you buying the food\nfor, so you give it to your girlfriend, your sister, your brother, your mother, and throw it over\nthe fence. Auschwitz was a constant organizeering, organizing, constantly going on.\nBetween the Kapos who you had to pay off, the Blockaltester who you had to pay off. The\nBlockaltester who was in charge of Block 29, the Canada Kommando, he lived like a king in\nAuschwitz because he was our god. And to him we brought the riches. For better treatment,\nfor taking care of our friends who got typhus. See I had typhus, I, I, I had, I acquire typhus, I\ngot typhus in 1943 in Canada, and at the time I was already in Birkenau. And two my\nfriends, Fisher and Buchler, I don't know if I, I mentioned these two boys prior. Here I have\ntyphus. The first thing that happens to you in typhus, you lose your hearing, and you echo,\nyour equilibrium, am I saying it wrong. You loose that, you lose your balance. These two\nboys would hold me under their arm with my cap off and march me through the gate, take\nme to Canada Platz where we worked the Canada warehouse. When transport didn't come,\nwe all worked at the warehouse. Sorting the clothing. They marched me through there, take\nme to the girls' section without the Nazis see it and the girls would cover me with bundles of\nclothing and make hot water for me with lemons. We had lemons, you could, what people\nbrought with them. And that's how they got me well. Not quite well, because I ended up in,\nin the block which was called the Krankenbau, and again, here was a Polish couple in charge\nof the block. And this friend of my named Fisher would pay them off to take care of me.\nBecause Mengele came every day to make a selection to, to go to gas chamber. Now they\ngot too hot, that he knew that I was on my last leg, that's when he brought me back and he\nsaid to Fisher, I can't keep him no more. You got to take him back to the barrack. So I\nsurvived Krankenbau with typhus. And that Canada Kommando, and again the girls took\ncare of me until I got well.\nEnd of Tape #3\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "A: My name 1s Michael V. Vogel. V-O-G-E-L. I was born November 29th, 1923.",
        "A: I was born in Jacovce, J- A- C-O- V -C-E, Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: I come from a family, my parents, my father was a businessman, he was a cattle dealer, in\nthe small community of Jacovce. We stayed in Jacovce until I became six years old. I had an\nolder sister and a younger brother. We then moved to a larger community which is called\nTopol any, T-O-P-O-L-C-A-N- Y.C with a umlaut [ha ek]. And the reason for the\nmove, because of schools. My father wanted to put us into a larger school, school which was\nin Topol any. And we lived in Topol any, we started, uh, Jewish schools, and soon after,\ntwo more children were born in our family. I can give you their names. My name used to be\nMoshe, which was, uh...they used to call me M - I - S - O, S with an umlat [Miso with a\nha_ek]. My sister who was older than my, uh, than I am, was name was Rose, Ro_1--R -O-\nZ with an umlaut [ha_ek]- I. My younger brother, who was not quite two years younger than\nme, his name was Arpad, A - R - P- A- D; and I had a sister Marta, M- A-R-T- A; anda\nlittle brother, the baby brother, whose name was Maxmilian. We lived a fairly happy life in\nSlovakia. Well, it was part of Czechoslovakia--this was the region of Slovakia. It was\nCzechoslovakia, but our part was called Slovak. We were the Slovaks. Antisemitism was\nthere, always there. I remember when we used to play soccer as kids, there was never boys\nagainst boys, it was always the Catholic against Jews. That was the kind of soccer games we\nused to play. But we got along as well as one could get along. We stuck to our ways and they\nstuck to theirs. Uh, we were quite religious, especially our mother. I even remember my bar\nmitzvah in 1936. Uh, my grandparents on my mother's side, my mother by the way came\nfrom another community, uh I would say sixty, seventy kilometers from Topol any. Her\nmaiden name was Feldman, and our grandparents, her parents, were there at my bar mitzvah,\nwhich we called the grosse shul--the big temple, the big shul. Our rabbi was a very famous\nguy. His name was Abraham Weiss. And we had to go to temple, to shul, every morning and\nespecially before I became bar mitzvah. And then of course after that, every morning. We all\nwent to the Jewish schools, except my sister. My sister was sent to Vienna. Now she was a\npre-teener, pre-teenager, where my father's youngest sister lived; and she stayed with her a\ncouple of years to go to school there. Uh, I would say from '35 to '37. And then she was sent\nback when Hitler started the rumbles. This was before the Anschluss in 1938 in Austria. We\nknew of problems in Germany. We knew of some problems but no one...no one paid much\nattention. Everyone felt ah nothing's going to happen to anyone. But we found out later that\nit did. Because in 1938 when Hitler marched into Austria, and annexed Austria so to speak\nas part of Germany, he started to take the Jews on the streets. We heard on the radios, those\nof us who had radios, what was going on - the beatings of the Jews, the break-in of the shops\nand that type of hooliganism that was going on. And pretty soon we found the Austrian Jews\nwere running away from Austria and came to our towns. And my mother took an Austrian\nlady in to us. We didn't have a huge home but the five children but we gave her a spot to\nstay. But most of all I remember is when the Czechoslovakia mobilized its armed forces.\nAnd the reason for the mobilization was because Hitler wanted to take part of\nCzechoslovakia which known to us as Sudetenland into Germany. He wanted to annex\nSudetenland into Germany. That was a Germanic-speaking part of Czechoslovakia. And I\nremember my father was also taken into service, and I still remember the narrow street as the\nfive children and our mother walked with our father to the railroad station to wish him well,\nto say goodbye to him. And, of course, the famous Neville Chamberlain quote, \"peace in our\ntime.\" And peace in our time never came; because as soon as he [Chamberlain] probably\nclosed the door of 10 Downing Street, Hitler marched not only into Sudetenland but he took\nover the Czechs, Bohemians, Moravians. But Slovakia, the region where I was born, didn't,\nnever seen a Nazi. Nazi soldiers never marched into Czechoslovakia, into Slovakia. So what\nhappened with us, the Hlinka Guard, Guard, Hlinka, which H - L-I- N-K - A, was formed,\nand then in March 15, 1939, is when Slovakia became the puppet government of the Nazis.\nThe Hlinka Guards, these were people that were our neighbors, people that our parents did\nbusiness with, that grew up, and lived with practically. They became the Guards.",
        "A: Guards? Their function was, this was the Nazi-type, almost like an SS-type guards. So what\nhappened with the Jews in particular, of course, only to the Jews in Slovakia as a matter of\nfact, all Jews from the age of six had to wear a yellow Star of David, sewn on the left breast\nof their outer clothing, with the inscription, Jude, Jew in German. I remember we couldn't,\ncouldn't walk the streets together. No more than three or four Jews could walk the streets\ntogether. And, of course, curfew. By eight o'clock all of us had to be in their homes. We\ncouldn't shop, uh, uh, any time we wanted to, only designated hours. And since my father\nwas, uh, a cattle dealer and horse dealer, while my father was, uh, gone, I became, I was the\noldest boy, my sister was older than me of course, so I was sort of in charge of knowing\nsome of the millers, some of the flour millers, and go to pick up flour for our family. And\nyou couldn't do it during the day because if you got caught, the Hlinkas would get to you and\nof course you were punished. Midnights, uh, middle of the nights, was when my mother and\nI and a couple of other Jewish ladies would go, go to the miller and pick up flour so we could\nhave bread. And it was all black market, and you always paid through the nose. (Laughter)\nEveryday there was a new law read to us or posted on, on bulletin boards - they had these\nlittle round, uh, stalls where you would come and read the bulletin what happens next to the\nJews. Uh, we were harassed, beaten on the streets, and of course the businesses were taken\naway from all the Jews. My father business, my father's business was given to the person\nwho worked for him. And my father had to work there to show him how to do the business,\nto sell the cattle. And my father never believed that anything would happen to us. Almost to\nthe last minute. He said no, he - the reason for that was because most, most of these people,\nfirst of all, we were Slovaks, Czechs, we were born there. No one's going to bother us. And\nsecond, my father also dealt with the Czechoslovakian government. He sold cattle and horses\nto the government for, for the armies and that, uh, type of business. So he said no, nothing's\ngoing to happen. This will, ah, this will pass. But it didn't. Because we were harassed, we\nwere beaten, and in early 1942, end of 1941, early 1942, we heard that they are going to put\nus into camps. There was a rumor at one time, too--which was not even a rumor. Actually it\nwas the truth, that the Jews will be shipped to Madagascar.\u2019 Uh, I was a kid, I never knew, I\nwas a small young teenager. But it didn't happen. Instead of Madagascar, myself, my older\nsister, and my next brother--Rose, myself and Arpad--were told to report to the Town\nSquare. All young Jewish boys and girls. When they rounded us up, they told us that we're\ngoing back to our homes, pack our belongings - take food and clothing with you - you're\ngoing to be relocated and your parents will join you. They took us about two hours from our\nhome town to the first war camp. It was called Arbeitlager. And the camp, the name of the\ncamp was Novaky, N -O- V - A- K - Y, manned by large group of SS, of, uh, Slovakian\nHlinka Guards. Mind you, we have yet to see an SS officer. Let me, let me re-track back for\na moment if I may. Uh, the first time that have seen German soldiers was when Germany\nwas invading Poland, September Ist, 1939. And how we seen them, the German army was\ngoing through Slovakia to get to Poland, because we were first and then came Poland. But\nwe felt them. My father had to take the cattle from his stalls, from his, and the horses, and\ndeliver it to the Town Square for the German army. Beaten by these, uh, by the Hlinka\nGuards behind him, going fast, to give this for the Germans to take with them as, as food and\nand horses for, for carrying their materials, war materials. That was the first time that I'd seen\na German soldier. And when we'd seen them on those little motorcycles with the side little\ncar and, and, and trucks and horses pulling their, their - that's how we've seen - that's the first\ntime we've seen the Nazi soldiers, the German soldiers. This was the Wehrmacht at the time.\nSo, we never had anything to do with them as far as being our guards yet, because our guards\nwere the people that spoke Slovak just like we did. And when we arrived to Novaky, they\nloaded us on to trains after we loaded, after we packed our belongings at home. They came\nwith us to our homes so we wouldn't run, we wouldn't hide, and they had enough of these\nguards all over, all over the city.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, by names.",
        "A: Well, they would come, first of all they became ruthless. O.K. The word \"_ id\" was common.\n\"id\" is a Jew. \"We finally got you _ids,\" and that type of words, and beating. They all had\nclubs and rifles and canes. Whatever they had they would beat you. These were people, this\none guy in particular, his name was Martin ek (ph), who was the barber, who was our\nbarber. We used to go to the barbershop - he worked for a Jewish barber called Dezider (ph)\n' The Jews were never deported to Madagascar.\nBanau, B - A - N - A - U. The poor guy perished in Auschwitz, but you know. And this\nMartin ek (ph) was my barber. He cut my hair, cut my family's hair, and he, you couldn't ask\nfor a nicer guy during the time (laughter). He was also an alcoholic but most of them were.\nAnd when we arrived to this camp, we seen guards from our home town. You would go\nclose to him and would ask him nicely, you know, please don't help or something. Boom, the\nfirst thing would happen you would get hit. When they took us to Novaky by train, by, by\npassenger train, and when we arrived there it was a huge complex. With wooden barracks.\nGirls on one side, boys on the other side of the barrack, camp. And we were assigned to our\nbunks, unloaded our belongings, and then we had to line up in front of our barracks and then\nthe guards would read us the laws. And, by the way, food at the time was still plentiful in\nSlovakia. Slovakia was a farm country, so the food was there. The cooks were our people.\nThe Jews became, those who were appointed to be the cooks. We had meat, we had, we had\npotatoes, we had eggs, we, we still that. And we were also allowed at the time still to be\nreceiving packages. So the parents would send some stuff to us. So that was still allowed\nbecause it was our, you know, still in our country. When the next morning when they woke\nus up and lined us up in front of our barracks, they told us after breakfast, you're going to\nreport to work. What kind of work? Something which really, uh, none, nothing, uh, useful,\njust carrying bricks or stones and making piles. Because they didn't build anything. There\nwas nothing to build. This was a camp, just a big grounds with holes where they were\ndigging, some people were digging sand. My job, I was assigned to carrying stones in my\nbare hands and making a pile. And after we made that pile high, then we take that pile and\nmake another pile. And this was the daily, daily routine. There was some people, there was\neven railroad tracks with small, small cars that ran on the railroad, that we pushed on the\nrailroad. And we would just carry sand, dump it and carry more sand. No reason. There\nweren't homes built. There weren't roads built. There was just a camp, just a detention camp.\nAnd beating. Yea, we still had music and our singing groups. None of us believed what,\nwhat was waiting for us. When in April 1942 the first transport, well actually it was the end\nof March, the first transport from Novaky was taken and my brother Arpad was there and so\nwas my sister Ro _1, Rose. I stayed behind. Of course, I didn't know, we didn't know where\nthey were going. Neither did they. And I found out of course much later, my sister Rose\nended up in Auschwitz. My brother Arpad ended up in Lublin-Majdanek. Couple of months\nlater my turn came. I, I left with a bunch of people, Slovakian people from my home town\nalso, and we, this is what they told us. This is how they did it. They lined us up in front of\nour barracks. They told us we're going to be relocated to the east. Pack whatever you owned,\nreport back in front. We did that. They loaded us into trucks, and I will never forget, just as,\njust as the trucks started to move, in unison we all started to sing the Hatikvah. I'll never\nforget that. Just the trucks moving, and we singing the Hatikvah anyway. And when we\nfinished the Hatikvah, still being Czechs and Slovaks, we sang the Czech national anthem.\nWhen we came, the trucks stopped at a railroad siding. Railroad siding is for the, load, uh,\nfreight. We've seen, oh, I would say about twenty cattle cars lined up, on the railroad tracks,\nand each cattle car had a wooden plank, doors wide open, and the plank leading into the\ncattle car. They loaded us into the cattle car, between eighty and hundred of us, boys and\ngirls together. A metal bucket was put on each end of the car which was used for bathroom.\nThe cattle car's doors were locked and sealed. We could hear them locking it. This was the\nlast time that we have seen the Slovakian Hlinka guards. Some of the boys got friendlier with\nthe guards, and they say, \"Goodbye to you. You know, this 1s it, we won't [see] you no\nmore.\" And the train started to move, and Novaky is approximately 24 hours distance from\nAuschwitz. Of course, we didn't know we were going to Auschwitz. They told us we were\nbeing relocated and our families will join you. Your families will soon join you. I would say\napproximately 24 hours later. . .",
        "A: That cattle car - first of all, it was jam packed, uncomfortable. People were fighting for\nplaces. You could not, not all of us could sit down. Hardly anyone could lay down. People\nwere crushing each other. And of course they were fighting for the bathroom facilities. That\nwas the worst part. Those people who couldn't hold, and then of course the buckets would be\nover-filled, and there was nothing else you could do, just relieve yourself as close to the\ncomer of the car as you possibly could. We stopped once, on the cattle car, just the cattle car\nstopped once to relieve the buckets and they gave us some water, one, on one trip. I don't\nremember where - I was told it was in Jinna, that was the name of the town, but who could\ntell. And we got the buckets out and then they gave us some water. I would say next\nmorning, now I would say next morning we arrived to our destination. The cattle cars\nstopped. The cattle cars were opened. And this was the first time that we have seen SS\nguards, SS soldiers, and SS officers. And every SS guard had a dog on a leash, either a\nGerman Shepherd or a Doberman Pincher. Mostly German Shepherds. Their rifles with\nbayonets sticking up, and either wooden walking cane, a bamboo cane or a whip in their\nhands. And of course, most of us, all of us in Slovakia I should say, spoke German. If you\nwere Czechoslovakian, you spoke German, Hungarian and Slovak. That was our language.\nThese were our languages. And they yelled, the Nazis would yell, \"Juden raus schnell!\"--\n\"All Jews out fast, fast!\" With a beating. And we have seen, among the SS, people in striped\nuniforms, prisoner striped uniforms. And these were the boys that worked the railroad track.\nOf course we didn't know why. The Nazis, the SS would tell us to line up. And the boys, the\nprisoner boys, the people in prison uniform, would come to us and tell us either in German or\nin Czech or whatever language, line yourself up in rows of five. Of course, all done with\nbeatings by the SS. When they separated the boys from the girls, when we were all lined up\nin rows of five, everything in Nazi concentration camp was five, because of easier count, and\nwith the Nazis, with the dogs on the side of us, we started to march. I would say a mile and a\nhalf maybe. And we came to a gate of Auschwitz. A gate with a half moon sign, that says\n\"Arbeit Macht Frei,\" work makes you free, or gives you freedom. After we were in\nAuschwitz, I'm going to jump a little bit 1f I may, in Auschwitz for what, three, four months,\nand we used to march through this gate, in and out of this gate, with the orchestra playing.\nAs we marched through this gate, we used to say among each other, \"Arbeit Macht Frei,\nKrematorium drei\"--\"Work makes you free when you end up in crematorium three.\" And\nthose of us we always looked who survived, who's still alive. As we marched through the\ngate, the girls on one side of the camp, the boys on the other. Auschwitz is built of solid\nbrick. It's, everything is brick. Even the road, the streets are made of brick. The barracks,\nsolid barracks. Before the Nazis invaded Poland, this part of Auschwitz used to be a Polish\nArmy camp. So they marched us through the gate with whips and beatings and dogs jumping\nat us. We came to a huge brick building. They shoved us into the huge brick building, and\nthere were prisoners and SS telling us what to do next. There was tables, long tables. The\nfirst area we had to undress, strip our clothing. There were hooks behind us. You put the\nclothing through a piece of wire, hang the clothing up. Take our shoes off, put the shoes on\nthe floor. Next table were the barbers, the camp barbers. Where they shaved our head, cut\nour hair, shaved the entire body. They said this for hygiene. Then we moved to another table\nwhere the tattooing was done. So the tatoo was done on left forearm. There was one person\nwho rubbed the little piece of dirty alcohol on your arm, and the other one had the needle\nwith the inkwell, and he would do the numbering. So my number is 65,316. That means\nthere were 65,315 people numbered before me, tattooed before me. After the tattoo, tattooing\nwas done, they put us, they gave us the clothing, but not what we came with. They gave us,\nissued us a striped brown cap, a jacket, a striped jacket, a pair of striped trousers, a pair of\nwooden clogs, and a shirt. No socks or underwear. Then the last area, when they gave us the\nuniform, they gave us two strips of cloth. The cloth I would say was about six inches long,\nmaybe inch and a half wide. And it would star, starred with the Star of David, corresponding\nwith the number on your left forearm, sewn on your left breast and on the right pant leg. And\nthen the last 1tem which was the most important item that we received was a round bowl.\nAnd this bowl was the life blood of your being. First of all, without 1t you couldn't get the\nmeager rations that we got. And second, the bathroom facilities were almost non-existent.\nUh, uh, even at Auschwitz, each barrack on the bottom had a washroom. But you couldn't\nuse it. It was only for the privileged. You could use it special times if you were quick,\nbecause they only gave you like two, three minutes. But most of us couldn't use it. So, when\nthey gave us the numbers and the bowl, you are now, we were recorded, also by prisoners.\nThis was the, what they call today the Nazi documentation department. These were, they\nwere the officers that did all the paper work. And these were prisoners that worked in the\nNazi documentation department. Every transport, how many people arrived, and what their\nnames, where they came from, where was the transport from, where it originated, and so on.\nThese people were the ones to do that type of work. And most of these people were actually\noffice workers from homes - bankers, uh, people that worked as accountants possibly. So\nafter they documented all that, we no longer had names. The Nazis called us Haftlings,\nprisoners. I became Haftling , prisoner 65,316. Then they\nmarched us to our homes, to our barracks. In Auschwitz as well as all concentration camps,\nall buildings where prisoners, Haftlings, were housed, were known as blocks. I was assigned\nto Block 16 in Auschwitz, and Auschwitz , our main camp Auschwitz. Each\nbarrack, each block, had between three to five people that were in charge of the blocks, and\ntheir name, their, their ranks and names would be such. The head guy was called\nBlockaltester, block elder. Next to him would be a guy called Stubendienst; \"Stube\" means\nroom, \"Dienst,\" \"assistant.\" He was the assistant of the Blockaltester and the third guy was\nthe most important guy actually he was the Schreiber or the register and the reason for which\nhe was so important because he would write people he had in each block, and how much\nartificial tea or artificial coffee was served, how many slices of bread, and how much potato\npeel, potato soup was served in the evening. That guy was the one responsible for that. And\neverything was done by number. One of the most cruelest things in any camp was called the\nAppell, the roll call. The roll call in Auschwitz, I will, uh, so many people got killed during\nroll call, murdered. Many people ran to the wires just, just before roll call. Of course even\nthat the Nazis didn't let you do, run to the electric wires and fry. But that was the most\ncruelest thing. I, I, that was so bad, they would wake you up with beatings anywhere\nbetween four and six o'clock in the morning. It depended on how early they got up. And\nthen, you had to line up in rows of five. And the whole camp was counted with the main\nprisoner, who was called the Lageraltester, the Lager elder, who in most cases was either a, a\nGerman criminal or came from Poland. I also want to make one thing very strong, very clear.\nThe people in charge of the barracks in most cases, and I would say 90% or better, were\nGermans or Poles, Germans or Poles. These were the ones with the green triangles - then the\ngreen triangles were, were the criminals. The red ones were the political prisoners. And we\nhad some red ones also in charge of us. But these people had better way, better living, better\nuniforms, underwear, regular boots or shoes. They had little rooms in each barrack.\nBlockaltester had his room. Stubedeinst and Schreiber had a room, and they had food which\nwas organized in Auschwitz. These were the murderers, the murderers among us. They were\nprisoners, but these are the killers. And during roll call they would kill many of us. Kill us\nfor the simple reason that someone did it in their pants. They, uh, soiled their pants, soiled\ntheir uniform. Poor guy couldn't hold it. Dysentery was, was something very, very common.\nAfter two weeks of Auschwitz your eyes would swell up from water. Your, your whole face\nwould be blown up from water. Your legs would puff on you because of malnutrition and\nhygiene. And then you became a skeleton which was called Muselmann by the Nazis. After\nthe roll call, and only after the whole camp was counted and the count was correct, only then\nwe were able to go to the labor, slave labor work sites we were assigned to, labor\nKommandos they were called. Every group in Auschwitz as well as all concentration camps\nwas called Kommandos. I was assigned, well, let me give you the barrack. There were four\npeople in each tier. There were three tiers. Two men to a blanket. No mattresses, no nothing,\njust one little blanket for two people. You never dared to take your uniform or shoes off,\nclogs off, because if you did the next morning you couldn't find them. Because during\nworking hours when we were working, many of us lost our clogs in the mud and there, that\nwas it. No shoes. You died sooner anyway. So after the roll call they gave us our first ration\nof the day which consisted of artificial tea, artificial coffee. The Nazis called it Ersatz tea,\nErsatz cafe, Ersatz's tea, Ersatz's cafe. Then your Kapo Kommando, Kapo who was in charge\nof the Kommando, you would have to report to him to be assigned to slave labor. My first\njob in Auschwitz was in Buna, which was a munition factory. We did, uh, artificial tires,\nrubber, uh, synthetic tires. There were two main factories like that. One was the Krupp\nWerke and one was Buna. Krupp is well today in American because they sell the coffee\nmakers here. I see every time I walk by the department store coffee makers I just cringe. I\nworked in Buna, I survived Buna I would say almost three months.",
        "A: O.K. The Buna work, there were a lot of civilian workers which the Nazis brought from\ndifferent European countries. The masters, the foremen, uh, the engineers. I want to make\nthis very strong that a prisoner could not converse with these civilian workers. We could not\ntalk with them, although some of us snuck through and tried to, uh, they would throw us\nsometimes a piece of bread if they weren't afraid, because these, these people too, they had\nan arm band and the arm band would identify them as civilian workers. See. They knew\nwhat was going on, but, but they couldn't talk about it. A lot, there were some from Slovakia,\nthose Yugoslavs, there were Poles, the Polish civilians. There were some people from France\nand Germany. These were the people that were building, that that did the work there.\nActually these were the masters, we were the laborers. They would tell the SS how many\npeople they need and what they want us to do. And it was hard labor. Most of the time you\ndidn't work with tools. Everything was done with hands. There was a break for lunch right\naround noon. The factory whistle would blow and you'd go outside to lunch. And prisoners\nwith wagons would bring our noon meal which consisted of the soup. The soup had mostly\npotato peels - no meat whatsoever. Hardly none, no fat whatsoever. Just a little margarine\nthrown into it. And by the time they brought it to us in, to different, you know, they had\nmore groups to bring that. They brought it on a wagon what they pushed by themselves.\nThey didn't come by cart or trucks or anything. Pushed by prisoners to the work sites. By the\ntime we got it of course it was cold. It didn't, you know, and then we go back to work half an\nhour later. Back to the same. I will never forget when they lined us up in rows of five to\nmarch back to Auschwitz, to the camp, you would carry fifty, sixty of our comrades on our\nshoulders, either dead or dying. Back to Auschwitz, back to the camp. Because no one was\nallowed to die outside or be left outside. Because when we marched through the camp, the\ngates were open and they would count us there. Then we go to our own barracks. But not\nupstairs to your barrack where you could relax and sit down and lay down. You stayed in\nfront of your barrack until the whistle blew, the horn blew, Appell. And the Appell was\nalways yelled out from the first barrack and then like an echo, each barrack had a person that\nyelled Appell. There was an SS in charge and he would be 1n a tower. He would be the one\nwho would initiate the Appell call. And like an echo, it would just go throughout Auschwitz.\nThe Auschwitz itself, the Auschwitz camp itself was not that huge. So when everyone was\nlined up, then the Lageraltester, the main prisoner who was in charge of the whole camp,\nwould, the SS hierarchy, the SS officers, they would count from one barrack to the next to\nthe next and the next until all. And this is how we sound over the phone, over the echo:\nBlock , - Block seven, count correct. Eight, correct, and so on and so on,\ncorrect, until they came to a block where was not correct. You stood there until the person\nwas found. In most cases, the person either was somewhere in dying under some, under\nsomething, under, under a bunk. Or he was so sick he didn't care one way or another whether\nhe lives or dies. Or someone ran to the wires, to the electric wires. But only after everyone\nwas counted, even those we brought on our shoulders. He was dropped in front of his\nbarrack on the Appellplatz, on the roll call place. And that's where he was. And after the roll\ncall, each barrack had to clean up their sick and, and the dead and carry them to a barrack\nwhich was a holding place. And then the dead ones would be picked up the Leichen (ph)\nKommando. How would I translate leichen (ph) - as a dead, a Kommando that, this was a\ngroup of, of, of Jewish prisoners that worked with a wagon. They would go from barrack to\nbarrack, from camp to camp, to pick up the people that died at work, and those who died\nover night. And then they would be taken to the Leichenhaller (ph), to the dead cell, where\nthey were stacked up like sardines. And the next after that, they would be taken to the gas\nchambers, or to the pits, whichever was available, and the body would be burned. I survived\nBuna...I would say, close to three months. Then one evening after roll call, a friend of mine\nfrom not too far from my home town whom I got to know, he told me that he just got a job,\nand he said if there's a way to survive Auschwitz, I think I got it. And there was a try out in\nfront of Block Sixteen, our block. He was also in Block 16. He asked me, told me, try out\nand see if you can make it. So the try out was held by SS. They had suitcases there, and they\nput suitcases on the arm to see how fast you can run. Of course, we didn't know why. I made\nit. And I was assigned to a group called the Canada Kommando. It's like the country of, it\nwas named by the Nazis and the prisoners, the Polish prisoners named it Canada Kommando\nand the reason they named it Canada, because the final solution, of course I knew nothing\nabout final solution in those days. I knew nothing about anything else far as, other than being\nin Auschwitz. But the Canada Kommando was, or the organization was called Canada,\nbecause we unloaded all incoming Jews from every Nazi-occupied country, European\ncountry. By this time, this was still in 1942, this was like September 1942, this time they\nwere bringing in entire families. Not just young people. Families from their homes, families\nfrom holding camps like Novaky, and from, uh, Vienna, from from France, from Belgium,\nfrom Holland. We had people coming in from every different, every country. And the\nCanada Kommando consisted of start out I would say about four hundred and fifty people.\nAnd we had two shifts, day shift and night shift. I was assigned to the day shift, and we\nwould go to the railroad tracks. This is still Auschwitz I. And before we went to the railroad\ntracks, the Kapos would line us up, and the SS would tell us in no uncertain term, if there is\nanyone here that will talk to the people you are unloading other than what you are supposed\nto tell them. See they told us you will only tell them, leave you belongings behind in the\nlanguage that you understand or they understand, that they speak. Anything else you can't\ntalk to them about. You can't say anything to anyone else other than what you're supposed to\ndo. Anyone caught talking to the people that are arriving will be dealt with. And I've seen\nmany that was being dealt with. Some of us found their families. Some of us found their\nbrothers and sisters and parents. When they unloaded them.",
        "A: They were killed. The Nazis would take them behind the cattle car after we unloaded the\npeople and slowly torture and murder them. We carried a poor, a poor, poor soul back to the\ncamp. Nothing stopped the transport. In many cases, an SS man depended where the\ntransport came from. Western European countries for instance which people came from\nHolland and Belgium. Well dressed. When they came, an SS officer would get over a bull\nhorn, and he would tell, ladies and gentlemen, I want to apologize that you've been a little\ninconvenienced, but you know this is a war on, and we don't have the facilities for to better\ntrains, but you will be soon taken care of. You are in Auschwitz, that's a work camp and if\nyou work you will live. Just leave your belongings behind, and everything will be brought to\nyou after you are cleaned, disinfected. You will get hot tea and so on. And of course we\ncouldn't do anything about that type of stuff. Although many of us tried, tried by telling\nthem, don't take, to a mother we'd tell, don't take a child with you because if you do, you're\nnot going to survive. Excuse me. (Pause) Some got caught, some people got caught doing\nthat. Didn't live until the transfer left. That's when they took care of them. After, I would say\ntoday, then I didn't know, really none of us knew, I would say that approximately 10% of the\nincoming people with the families were selected to be taken to slave labor. The rest were\ntaken to the crematorias. There was, uh, one crematoria at the time only in Auschwitz. This\nis 1942. And uh, they couldn't, they couldn't, uh, eliminate so many bodies in the one\ncrematoria so they build trenches, ditches, and that's where they would pour gasoline or\nsome kind of inflammable item on them and that's how they would burn them. And I want to\nmake clear we didn't see it then. That we still didn't see, except we knew the boys that\nworked in Sonderkommando, and these boys, the kind of Kommandos on this Kommando\nwere constantly tried to be, oh we will not, they was isolated. They lived in the barrack that\nyou were not allowed to go to. But we already had enough Pole, old-time prisoners so to\nspeak. Some of us knew how to get away from there and the Sonderkommando knew how to\nget away from their area, and by bribing certain officials, certain people, you were allowed to\ncommunicate between each other. It was an underground, uh, well, it was called\nOrganizierung, organizing. The underground, uh, resistance group was always there, from\nday one. Some of, some of our boys were the leaders of the group. They, they, they knew\nhow to organize well. I was a youngster myself, eighteen years old, ah, not quite. I was\nseventeen when I arrived there. I really, I was part of the group that brought the riches from\nCanada back to the camp, smuggled it in. I was the young smuggler. There was three of us\nthat did that job. And we would bring it to our families, to our friends, those of us who had\nsisters and brothers in the camp or mothers in the women's camp. And there were those who,\nwho knew how to get it to them by bribing some of the Nazi officials.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Sure. The Canada Kommando, after we unloaded the people, after the Nazis made sure that\nwe go to the tracks, and that we don't speak to no one, the main job was to tell the people and\ntry to keep them calm. And when, the first thing that would happen after the people were\nunloaded, in those days there were trucks, dump trucks. The first people they would get rid\nof were women with children, the old, the sickly, the ill, uh, the people with, uh, cripples.\nThese people would be loaded on to trucks, and taken away right away, and the last people\nthat the Nazis would march were the people that were selected to go to slave labor. With the\nbelongings, some of it on the ground, but most of it in the cattle cars. And when these people\nwere taken, men to the men's camp, women to the women's camp, and the same process was\ndealt with them as it was done with us. Numbered and shaved and showered and so on.\nAssigned to the barracks. Only then we started to work on the mountains of luggage which\nwas loaded in to trucks and it went to the Canada warehouse. It was a huge complex where\ngirl Canada Kommandos, mostly Slovakian girl Canada Kommando, worked. And their job,\nthey were, they were the only ones dressed up almost like, not a civilian but nice, a dress,\nand they all had babushkas [NB: kerchiefs] tied on their heads, because their heads were\nshaven. And these girls worked with the clothing. Disinfecting of the clothing. And when\nwe, we, first we would do this. Load it into trucks. Unload it into Canada warehouse. And\nthere were boxes in front of us, SS guards walking back and forth watching us, what we\nwere doing. And we would take first the valuables would we put into boxes. Monies in one\narea, gold and watches and rings and that type of stuff in another box. And everything had its\nplace. Then we started to work with the clothes. Of course, we search the clothing - search\nthe pockets, the shoulders, the shoulder pads were, were, were felt for any, any hard stuff or\nany soft clothing, or soft monies, and then we had to rip some of it off. Even shoe heels were\nopened, because the Nazis found out that the shoe heels the people saved. And toothpaste, in\nthose days because the toothpaste in Europe was not the greatest, not like America, and they\nwould squeeze and look for diamonds and gold, which was found there. Then we started to\nwork with the clothing. Separate the clothing. Men's, women's and children's clothing\nseparate. There was a blanket on the ground always where we dumped the clothing. After the\nblanket was full enough, you bundle, you put on your shoulder and took it to the girls. Now,\nlet me make a very strong point. When these bundles of clothing were taken to the girls,\nmany of us brought food to the girls, in the blankets. But, there was always an SS man\nstanding by, he was watching of course the girls too. But the girls, he couldn't watch the girls\ndoing that, because the girls wanted to, working with the clothing. They were watching what,\nas we were dumping, if there was any food. They knew we were bringing food there. In a\nway they let us, we played a cat and mouse game with these guys. If they caught you, you\ngot beaten. Twenty-five on your behind. You bend down and then you get twenty-five. You\nhad to count them, twenty-five. And you count twenty-five on your buttocks, and the Nazis\nstop you. They say, how many did I give you. And you say, seventeen. Wrong. All over\nagain. This was a sport. They called it sport. And that's how we used to bring the food to the\ngirls. And, information to the girls from the camp. She had a brother there, or a father there,\nnot working in Canada Kommando but working in Marashar (ph) which was uh, uh, people\nthat work with the bricks and, and, and, mortar, that type of people. And they would say,\nyour father told me to say this and that, they could keep up and so on, whatever. And then\nthey would write, they would find pencils. . .",
        "A: From us. From Canada Kommando. We had the pencils, the papers, the watches, the clocks,\nthe compasses. We, we, people from Europe, from France, Belgium, Holland, they used to\nbring stuff with them that you wouldn't believe. And of course everyone brought the finest\nfinery they had because they felt they can sell it to save their life. That was another thing.\nThey even told them, some of them, bring, bring, because winters, you need, a lot of them\ncame with nice fur coats and, you know, it was all gone. And so, I mean, I mean, so we\nwould bring these girls and the girl would send a note to their father or their brother or their\ncousin or their husband. There was one boy who died last year, his name was Fisher. His\nwife was working in Canada Kommando, in women's Canada Kommando. He worked in the\nmen's Canada Kommando. So that's how these boys, that's how that was. And I, I worked\nthere, the warehouse and the railroad tracks. Then I was put on the night shift. You know,\nyou see, you couldn't survive Auschwitz by yourself. You had to have a partner. In Yiddish\nit was called, in Hebrew it was called shitif (ph). Shitif (ph) is a partner. And I had three\npartners. Not one of them 1s alive. The last one was Fisher, who died uh last year. And\nwithout a partner you couldn't survive. After we finished a day's work at Canada\nKommando, you just couldn't go home, back to the camp, without being searched, first at the\nwork site - lined up, stripped naked in most cases. And if you weren't stripped naked, your\npants dropped because they knew that some of us carried money in the places that is, uh,\nkind of dark. Uh, but we do, we also knew how to smuggle out, smuggle the stuff in. For\ninstance, you in this row, and your friend is in the row in front of you. You always stood\nbehind your friend, behind your partner. And as you partner was already searched, you\nshoved it to him. And he stepped forward. And then you were clear. A lot of times we got\ncaught, beaten and caught. Let me give you one incident what would happen to the clothing.\nAfter the girls cleaned the clothing, it was bundled again, and carried by us, there was at the\nCanada warehouse, there was a railroad siding, railroad tracks, with freight cars waiting. And\nthis was taken by us, loaded into cattle cars, into freight cars, and shipped to Germany. I\nremember one incident very, very clearly. I don't know, I don't know if names, German\nofficers' names mean anything. Uh, there was one guy named Otto Graff (ph). There was\nanother guy named Unterscharftthrer Wiglet (ph). That's a rank. He was in charge of the\nCanada warehouse. And a young boy from Grodno (ph), a Polish Jewish boy, as he, the one\nboy stayed in the cattle car, in the freight car, and stacked the bundles, and the other ones\nlike us, we would carry the bundles. He would fill the car. This boy from Grodno hid himself\nwith the bundles and the freight train took off. Now it's evening time, ready to be lined up to\ngo back home. And we were counted. Fisher, by the way, was a registrar of the Canada\nKommando. Besides being working there as a Canada Kommando worker, he had the job of\nregistering all the prisoners. He's counting, he was short one. Now, they started looking. First\nall over the warehouse. A lot of us would rest sometime without the Nazis knowing in the\nbundle where the girls worked, on top of the heap, and they would cover us and let us rest.\nAnd they would take, we had lemons a lot of times from the transports. You know, the\nlemons would come, they would make hot lemonade. Just hot water, but there was a place\nthat cooked the food, you know, that cooked for the Nazis. And we'd get hot water from\nthere and make lemon, or squeeze the lemon into hot water. So this boy who was bundled\nhimself up in, in with the clothing, train left and he went with it. Of course, we didn't know\nhe went with it. Looking for him, the Nazis are looking for him, not us. The Nazis and the\nKapos are the ones who start looking, searching the, all Canada warehouse. Can't find him.\nAll of a sudden Otto Graff, the SS officer, jumps on his motorcycle, goes after the train. And\nthey bring him back. As close as I'm sitting to you, there was a tree on the ground. Otto Graff\nlines the boy up against the tree and goes to his neck, and shoots him right here, in front of\nour eyes. And he tells us right then and then, this is how you will end up if you try to escape.\nAnd we carried the boy from Grundo, I can't think of his last, his first name, Jankl (ph), and\ncarried him back to camp. Many of us tried. There's so many people tried and never made it.\nSeptember 23rd, 1942. (Cough). It's a day that I will never forget. I was working night shift.\nMy friends were, some of my partners were working day shift. September 23, 1942 fell on\nErev Yom Kippur, when my mother and my father, my little sister, Marta, and my little\nbrother, Maxmilian, were brought to Auschwitz. My mother, my little brother and my little\nsister were gassed upon arrival. My father was assigned to slave labor. My mother was only\n42 years old. My father was assigned to slave labor, and we met in Auschwitz. Not in the\nsame barrack of course. My father was assigned to work with horses, being that he, that's\nwhat, many times they asked, in most cases they asked how old are you, what is your\nprofession. So my father was assigned to work with horses, to do some work. My father took\nill, uh, second week of November 1942, and he was put into a Krankenbau, a sick bay, Block\n7 in Auschwitz. Auschwitz I, still Auschwitz I. I would come to see my father every night\nafter roll call. I was not allowed to go inside the barrack, but to the window. I would yell to\nhim through the window and he would come up. I will never forget the last time I've seen my\nfather. He, uh, said to me, and by then he knew there was only two of us left in our family,\nwhatever you do, try to survive and carry on the name. I came to see him the next evening,\nand, uh, yelled for him and called for him and he never came out. Another person came out\nand he said to me that they took him this morning. They gassed him this morning. First of\nJanuary, first part of January 1943, the Canada Kommando was moved to Birkenau.",
        "A: O.K.",
        "A: O.K. The boys that worked the day shift unloaded my family. One boy from my hometown's\nname was Yako Buchler, Jacob Buchler, B - U - C - H, Buchler in this country. Buchler was,\nI would say, fifteen years older than me who knew my family quite well. We lived in the\nsame town. And he told me what happened to my family. Yako Buchler ended up in Israel\nafter the war. In 1981 I went to the World Gathering of all us survivors. (Long pause -\ncrying) and that's when we discussed and we talked about that then too. Excuse me. (Long\npause - take your time - conversation) O.K. Oh dear, I didn't believe this would happen to\nme. (After you went through tt, it's real to you.) Alright.",
        "A: Yea, we were partners, and, uh, of course I went to see my father (pause - conversation), and\nmy father's birthday was November 8th. My father was born in 1898, and my mother was\nborn in 1900. So in 1942 she was 42 years old and my father was two years older.\n(PAUSE)",
        "A: We moved, they moved us from Auschwitz I, [to] what the Nazis called Auschwitz zwei,\nAuschwitz II, which was Birkenau. Course we knew nothing about it. The only thing we\nknew there were boys working in Birkenau, building a new camp. As I told you at the outset,\nAuschwitz I was solid brick. Birkenau was all wooden huts. Dirt roads practically, muddy.\nThe Canada Kommando was housed in Block 28. Then the railroad tracks already led into\nBirkenau. We didn't have to go back to Auschwitz railroad tracks to unload the victims. In\nfront of all the people because Birkenau was a camp on two sides, two sides of the road. Let\nme explain. Only one entrance, but here's a road in the middle. There are camps, rows of\ncamps such like this way, and rows of camps same way this way. We were, the first camp\nwere the girls. Wires in front of us. A ditch in between, you know, wires, in between the\ncamps. Guard towers all around the complex, all around, constantly manned by SS. We, the\nCanada Kommando, were so gutsy already by then, seasoned, knew how to bribe some of\nthe officials, some of the SS, would go close, as close to the, to the wires as possible, and the\ngirls would meet us on the other side. And we would throw over food to them. But we paid.\nWe knew which SS we paid for it. Because the SS were not allowed to take in front of you,\nin front of them. But they, they would say, Canada Kommando | , Canada\nKommando, what do you have today. Ye , | have today a gold watch. And it's all\nright, you drop it there, so when he, when he is relieved from the post by the other SS man\nwho relieves him, then he tells you where to drop it and he picks it up. Then he would turn\nhis back and you would throw something to the girl. All the other guards could see, but the\nother guards were busy with same way. One, two, three of us would go to the wire, and they\nwould, you could never go close enough. You made your, you made the arrangements the\nday before. You would say, , 1 come tomorrow, I got a sister here.\nSee. And he says , what are you going to bring me?\n, what would you like? You know, whatever I find, you know. And\nthat's how we did it. I survived because of Canada Kommando. And uh, if it wouldn't be for\nthat, I probably would be one in six million.",
        "A: Birkenau, as I said, was nothing but mud. The water was in pipes. The water came out real\nthin spritz [Yidd: a spray] of water of pipe. You couldn't drink the water. If you drank the\nwater, you died. But the Canada Kommando were the organizers. And the Sonderkommando\nwere the organizers because the Sonderkommando got the valuables from the clothing of the\npeople that were gassed. Canada Kommando got the valuables of the, of the the big valises,\nand luggage and baggage of the people. So, we were treated differently by, even by the SS to\na degree. They killed us, they beat us, that part they did with us. But we were the clog in the\nmachinery. If you got caught you got killed, regardless who you were. Where you could be\nclose to the SS who you gave so much because he couldn't pick it up, even the SS work in\nthe Canada Kommando. But they were hoarders, these people were, were hoarding, uh, uh,\nvaluables, monies and whatever, but they couldn't pick it up themselves. So they knew. In\nBirkenau they treated us differently. And by the gate some of the SS who were jealous of the\nother SS who worked the Canada Kommando, they would say, ah, here comes the Canada\nKommando, let's search them. Always at the gate. And when we searched them, we dropped\nit, they would take it. So everybody got a piece of the action, so to speak. But the camp itself,\nthis was really and truly the death factory. Birkenau had four crematoriums, two gas\nchambers, two crematoriums on one side of the road, two gas chambers, two crematortums\non the other side of the road. And the railroad tracks went right into, close to the crematoria.\nAnd the whole camp could see. You could see the flames, not just the smoke, you could see\nthe flames from the chimney. Well, of course when burning the Muselmann, the people that\nwere skeletons, only the smoke. But when there were fat people, with still fat on them, there\nwere flames. And a lot of people when they were coming, when they came to Birkenau, they\nthought, they thought it was a bakery. The smell, they they, thought it was a bakery,\nsomething was baking. (SHORT PAUSE) April 7, 1944, the first two successful Jewish boys\nescaped Auschwitz. First name was Walter Rosenberg--who changed his name after the war\nto Rudolph Vrba-- and the second was Freddie Wetzler, W - E- T - Z- L- E- R, who kept\nhis name. And these two boys escaped. Three days they were buried in an empty camp in\nBirkenau called the Mexico Camp. Nazis called it Mexico because when they brought the\nRussian prisoners there, they didn't have any clothes, so they put blankets on them. So they\ncalled it Mexico Camp. Mexico. Nazis had names for everything. And these boys for three\ndays were buried there, and we had to stay on roll call three days without food, without\nwater, until, the third day the Nazis - would, this is what would happen. If someone escaped,\nthe siren would blow, everyone had to go out regardless of what time, stand the roll call.\nWhen the person was found, he would be displayed in front of us. In most cases they would\nbring him dead or dying or shot up or tortured, and he always, they would sit him in a chair\nand they put a sign 1n his hand, and the sign would read, hello, __-------. Hello, I have\nreturned. And then they would display this guy in a 36-inch space between the, by the gate.\nThere was a 36-inch space between, wire, wire space. They would sit the chair there and as\nyou marched in and out to work, you would have to look at that person. But with Vrba and\nwith Wetzler, and Walter Rosenberg who changed his name to Vrba, they didn't catch them.\nThey successfully escaped. We didn't believe it ourselves that they escaped. Because I\nremember one time, three Polish Jewish boys escaped, and they were gone for two days.\nAnd they got them. The Polish population would turn them in. See. They, we didn't have any\nfriends even then outside. And they brought these three Jewish boys in, and the law, the\npolicy of the camp was such that when there was someone brought back who escaped, there\nwas a public hanging. The whole camp had to be involved in that, had to watch it. And Nazi\nwould beat his drum, and the other guy behind him would read a, read a sentence, why he\nhad sinned against Third Reich. And who were the people who did the hanging? They would\ntake prisoners, put hoods over them, over the prisoners, that did, not only the ones that were\nhanged, but did the hanging. And these three Jews, Polish Jewish boys were hung. In public.\nThere were, Sundays were the hanging days. That was common, very common. There was a\nsingle gallows that was, they built the gallows for more than one. And some of them sang\nand yelled the last words. You know, revenge, and I remember one Polish Jewish boy said,\n, the Polish national anthem. He started yelling it. I stayed in\nBirkenau until October 21st, 1944, when again, an order came in the middle of the night that\nwe're being transferred. Pitch dark, you couldn't see two feet in front of you. Of course, the\ndarkness was because of the bombers come. You could hear the bombers already then. You\ncould hear fire, gunfire. We didn't know anything really. We were, the only thing we knew\nhow, when the war was bad, when it got worse, it got worse for us. Less food, more beatings,\nmore killings, more eliminating, more, more, uh, trying to, uh, cover up, more, the evidence.\nOf course, we didn't know that either. We just seen when it was bad for them, it was worse\nfor us.",
        "A: Yes. Of course, I didn't know this photo existed. This is from an original from the Nazi\ndocumentation department. This photo was taken in May, May 1944. And it's a photo I'm\none, I don't know if I can point it out which one I am. Which, what, I can't tell from this side.",
        "A: Oh, excuse me. OK. Here on this end, I'm one of the persons unloading the belongings of\nHungarian Jews that were brought there, May 1944, that already been gassed. This came\nfrom the zunda (ph), from the gas chambers, from the undressing rooms. This photo, by the\nway, was given to me by historian, Czech historian, Czechoslovakian historian, Jewish man.\nHis name is Erich Kulka. Erich Kulka had this photo and he used this at one time in\nGermany in a court to identify a Nazi. And there were two boys in there that were cut in, in,\nin, in the court, and I was already living in Detroit at the time of course at the time when this\nwas going on. Detroit, Michigan. And there, here, here we are unloading the belongings of,\nuh, Hungarian Jews that were brought to Auschwitz, Birkenau actually. This photo was\ngiven to me, uh, in, uh, June 1981 when I attended the, uh, World Gathering of holocaust\nsurvivors in Jerusalem. Erich Kulka lives in Jerusalem. He knew I was alive, and when I got\nback to my hotel, there was a message for me to call Erich Kulka with a phone number. Of\ncourse, I didn't know who Erich Kulka was, because Erich Kulka's name in Auschwitz...he\nchanged his name after the war. His name was Schoen, S - C - H - O with two dots - E-N.",
        "A: Erich Kulka, as I told you, was named Schoen. He's from the Czech part of Czechoslovakia.\nHe was brought to Auschwitz, I believe it was November 1942, and he came from\nNeuengamme, from another concentration camp. Erich Kulka and I became friends in\nAuschwitz. I was one of the persons that would bring Erich Kulka food and material to give\nto the people. Erich Kulka had as workers, as a, as an electrician. He doubles his job in the\ncamp, locksmith; he did locksmith work, he and an another person named Otto Kraus. And I\ngot friendly with these two boys, not just myself but other boys. And we would bring them\nthe materials to help our people. And Erich had more of a freedom, not a freedom in\nAuschwitz, but he could move because of his assignment as a locksmith, he could go from\ncamp to camp. Of course, he couldn't go away from the complex but, because it was all\nlocked in, fenced in. So when I had the message to call Erich Kulka, I called the name and\nthen he told me, \"Miso, my name is Erich Schoen. My name was Erich Schoen.\" What he\ndid, he changed his name. Took his wife's maiden name. His wife was killed. She also was in\nAuschwitz and then transferred to another camp in Germany, Stuttgart, Germany, and she\nwas murdered there. She died there. As I told you, I stayed in Auschwitz until October 1944.\nWe were put into cattle cars. We thought for sure that's the end of us. Two other boys, two of\nmy partners, Buchler was one and Ziedler (ph) was the other one, were also taken. We came\nto Oranienburg, which is Sachsenhausen. They didn't have any room for us. They had to let\nus sleep on the street of the camp. And the American bombers and the British bombers were\nbombing Berlin. Sachsenhausen is very, very close to Berlin. And we didn't know it then of\ncourse. We only knew, the only thing we knew we were in a camp and what's going to\nhappen to us next we didn't know. From there, because there was no room for us, we went to\nDachau. We got to Dachau, practically the same thing. Not much room there either. So the\nlast camp they took us to was called Landsberg. And there we stood until March 1945 when\nthe Allied were very close, I don't know how many kilometers, but they were close. We\nheard the bombs. We heard, uh, we heard the shootings. So they started to evacuate that\ncamp.",
        "A: Landsberg. Landsberg was also a dirty wooden camp built like in bunkers. The, the barracks\nwere very low, built like in, like, like in down...almost like bunkers. Landsberg was horribly,\nterribly lice infected. Which all camps were by the way. You could put your hand under you\narm and just throw lice out like this. But Landsberg had, had awful diseases. No crematories,\nno burial places. Just dig a ditch and that was it. And you carried these bodies like, like\nsardines. And we did nothing in Landsberg as far as labor.",
        "A: Uh, there was no Canada Kommando. We went out to work on farms. OK. The farms, we\nworked the German farms. They didn't have much. They had potato rows, you know,\ncovered with dirt. That's how, I worked in that. And the food was hardly non-existent. And\nwhen we started to move from Landsberg, there were a bunch of German prisoners in\nLandsberg. And I know of two of them who were given SS uniforms, to be our guards.\n(Laughter) I remember the two, Kapo Hantz (ph). His name was, he was a Kapo, Kapo\nHantz. He got a German uniform, he became the guard. They gave him a rifle. And we\nstarted marching. And we marching and some of the older prisoners, uh, older German\nguards, as we were marching we had, there was a wagon always behind to pick up the\nbodies. As we were marching, you know, picking up the bodies, the Germans would come to\nyou and they say, sign that I was good to you. Sign that I helped you. You know, I gave you\nbread. And of course none of, none of us did. You know, believe me, none of us did. By then\nwe, we had a feeling either we going to be all die, all killed, or some of us will survive.\nDuring an American air raid, daytime air raid, American bombers come down bomb\ndaytime, we all run in the ditches--including Nazis--and we made a human SOS. And myself\nand two other boys ran for the woods. I never forget that human SOS. That was so beautiful.",
        "A: The bombers didn't go after us. The bombers were hitting some, some target. They had a\ntarget because we could see. The bombers were going real low. So, I disappeared with the\nother two boys. And no one even cared anymore then. Because we've seen Nazis running.\nWe've seen, in the woods, we've seen Nazis running. We got into a farm house. And we got\nold civilian clothes, whatever we could find, and shed the clothes.",
        "A: (inaudible) We knocked on the, you know, they, the Germans knew already who we were\nthen you know because they were afraid of, they were afraid of their own shadows. Your\nknow, there were no men, no men folk home.",
        "A: They let us. We got some shirt, a side room. I got a shirt, big farmer's shirt (laughter) and a\npair of old boots that didn't fit. And that's how we walked around. Took two weeks about\nwhen I was picked up by the United States Army. Seven - yes?",
        "A: Just walked the woods and eat whatever we could find. Knock on farm, farm windows and\nfarm doors. Cooked potatoes in the wooded area. Seen Nazis running left and right. Soldiers\nrunning with no rifles at all. Uh, we seen them going without any, any of their markings, just\nplain uniform. They threw away their, their sergeant's stripes, whatever they had.",
        "A: Three GI's in a jeep met me on the street, on, on the road. And I went with them. They took\nme with them. The other two boys went east someplace. They disappeared. We split. And I\nwas picked up which was then the 774 Tank Battalion. These boys brought me with them,\ncleaned me up, gave me a pair of fatigues. Didn't speak a word of English, not one word. But\none of the boys was a Polish national. He was born in United States, Chicago boy, and he\nspoke Polish. And one was a cook in the Army, the other guy. And they took me in and I\nworked as, as, in the field kitchen, Army field kitchen. And I stayed with this outfit from\nGermany to Czechoslovakia, all the way to Czechoslovakia. From Czechoslovakia, this\noutfit was on the way back. In World War II there were point system. They had enough\npoints to go home. The Army point system. If you had, if you've been in the Army such and\nsuch long time, if you have so many children, you have points for each child. And this outfit\nwas on the way back home. So I'm with them all the way through.",
        "A: Great. Well, I learned English real quick, real fast. While I was with the United States forces,\nof course the Stars and Stripes were a great teacher for me, and I remember there was a\nteacher in this outfit who was teaching me English. And we lived in tents by the way. There\nwere no, no barracks. Army tents and this, they would teach me English. This guy made me\nread the Stars and Stripes aloud.",
        "A: The newspaper Stars and Stripes. And then he would tell, teach me how to write, how to read\nEnglish, how to pronounce some of the hard words. And I do have a good ear for languages.\nI pick them up quite, quite easily. I stayed with this unit. Of course, food was there.",
        "A: Well, uh, when you line up for chow, which was Army chow, we all got mess kits. And I\nwas like a soldier, I had everything what they had. And you line up and in the morning. In\nthose days we had fresh eggs because it was all farms, and the GI's would pick up the eggs\nfrom where ever they, whatever community they were at. They would send out a mess\nsergeant with someone to look for food. And of course the Army had food shipped to them.\nWe had powder eggs, but in, in this unit, because most field units they would find chickens,\nthey would find eggs, in, in the farms. And when you had enough food, when they were\ncooking, you could eat all you wanted and the baked biscuits and the baked rolls, you know.\nYou couldn't believe your eyes. And what, what, how much they would throw away. What\nwas this, waste so much, I just, just couldn't understand it. You know, coming from where I\ncame from, I see. Then we would get fresh fruit, fresh oranges, they would ship us bananas. I\nsaid, oh, my God. You know. It was amazing. Now. So I stayed with this unit all the way\nthrough Germany, Czechoslovakia, then back. Oh, we were stationed once in, one part in\nNuremberg. OK. Nuremberg is where the big stadium is where Hitler, the Olympics. This is\nwhere he had the big, huge, huge staditum. And the GI's used to play baseball there. So we\nused to go watch the baseball games there. Which I knew nothing about. (Laughter) I knew\nnothing.",
        "A: Well, I, there was a guy named Shoemaker, a soldier in my outfit, and he would play catch\nwith these guys before game, you know. This was, these were guys that were good, good\nbaseball players. You couldn't prove it by me, but they were good baseball players. And\nShoemaker had always had a baseball mitt with him. He came, traveled with that, he carried\nit all the time with him. And he would play, he would play catch with the guys. And I was a\nsoccer player. I didn't know anything about baseball. I would kick the darn thing. (Laughter)\nAnd I found out you can't kick a baseball. Real quick. And then we would go to Nuremberg.\nWe went to Nuremberg to watch a baseball game, a real baseball game. Yeah. And of\ncourse, what I was always most afraid of was doctors. That was the biggest thing that scared\nme. Dentists was most. Fear of dentists.",
        "A: Ah, very badly. They took me to a dentist. As a matter of fact, the Shoemaker guy took me to\na dentist. Because I had an abscessed tooth. And all my gums were pretty well dried up, uh,\nfrom malnutrition; and they took me to a dentist. And I remember, they gave me a capsule\nand I took the capsule and opened it and took the powder in my hand out, you know. I didn't\nknow how to deal with it, the guy didn't tell me what to do with it. That was horrible. And I\nran away from the dentist chair I was so scared. I never forget that. I ran away from the\ndentist chair. When we got back to France. .. Yes?",
        "A: They didn't. They didn't. They didn't.",
        "A: Oh yeah, lost most of them. They didn't. I was deathly afraid of it. I was so much afraid of\ndoctors. I never trusted any of them. Never trusted, as a matter of fact, the biggest problem\nwas not trusting anyone. Always, always being afraid there's someone behind you. Some,\nyou always figure the Nazis will come after you. You looked, you always look behind you. It\nwas in the camps, if you didn't take you cap off in front of a Nazi you got beat. If you did\ntake your cap off in front of a Nazi you got beat. They would, they would call you all the\ntime and ask you, come over here. Do you know what day it is? They would always pick a\nJewish holiday. But 1f you told them you knew what day it was, if you didn't tell them what\nday, it didn't make any difference. Same thing. So my fear was with me a long time. My trust\ndidn't come back to me for, oh my God, for, forever almost. But I was very, very lucky that I\nwas picked up in the outfit I was picked up in. Because when we got back to France, we\ncame to a camp called Camp Lucky Strike. And Camp Lucky Strike was a camp for all the\nGI's that were on the way home. It was like a tent city. The whole camp was loaded with\ntents, and the GI's would stay here until their their turn came to be taken to Le Havre, France\nto be put on a ship to go home. So one of the guys took a picture of me and this, this is me in\nthe Army, and this was the (conversation) this was the, the first American picture I have of\nmyself in an American uniform. And I stayed in this Camp Lucky Strike until September\n1945 when my outfit was taken to Le Havre, France and me with them, to be put on a ship, a\ntroop carrier called \"James Parker\". And our commanding officer whose name was Lt.\nColonel Conrad B. Sturgis (ph), a West Point man, he practically made the decision to put\nme on the ship with the unit, with unit and take me home. Home where? Oh, by the way, I'm\ngoing to have to retrack a little bit because I didn't tell you. By then, I already knew of the\nfamily I had left. My father's youngest sister lived in Detroit, Michigan. I didn't know, I\nknew she was in America, but I didn't know where, see. But nothing was done yet in 1945,\nSO...",
        "A: Well, I gave the Army her name, her married name, because this is where by sister went to\nschool in Vienna. She was from Vienna. And she arrived in the United States in 1939. And\nmy father's younger sister whose name was Ethel Shotten, S - H -O-T-T-E-N. She was\nmarried to a man named Rudy, Rudolph Shotten. So when I gave the names to the Army, the\nArmy and the Red Cross started to look. Put ads in the paper. Here we have this and this guy,\nborn such and such a place, area, and then I would say about two or three months later, I get\na letter from my aunt. Where she lived. So the commanding officer came to me and said, oh,\nyou got your ad, you know. What we'll do with you, we'll put you on a ship and when you,\nwe're going to Boston, they were originally, the ship, the, the United, the, the force, the the\noutfit was going to Boston. And they were going to be mustered out. In the Army, they\nmuster you out. And then, from there you go to, to Detroit and report yourself to, to\nImmigration Authorities he told. Well, we had a captain whose name was Captain Yogurling\n(ph); and he was a lawyer, an attorney at home. And he says, \"Don't do this. Because if you\ntake him there, they're going to deport him. He has to have papers and everything else.\" So\nwhat he did, before the ship sailed, they got my belongings, my duffel bag and everything\nthat I owned, and the boys took up a collection. And I got, we had already changed our\nmoney, our money was already changed into American dollars...",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Well, from the Army would give me \"X\" amount of dollars, you know, from the, from the\ncooks and from the captains. See, I worked the mess, the mess hall for the officers; and\nthe...the colonel took a liking to me and, and he called me \"Czechsky (ph).\" So I was like his\norderly so to speak. So they they took up a collection, and, and I had enough dollars to you\nknow. So Captain Yogurling calls Camp Home Run which is in Le Havre, we were in Le\nHavre already then, now we are at the docks, OK, to be shipped. Calls up the commanding\nofficer in Le Havre, and they take me in there. And he says since you've got your aunt here,\nin the meanwhile nothing was done with my aunt other than a couple of letters, and I wrote\nto her and she wrote to me, and my, this was in September of, uh, uh, and I'd already found\nher. November 29th is my birthday so my aunt sent me a, a Bulova watch for my birthday.\nSo that was my birthday present from my aunt, my first present. And they say they're\nworking, I shouldn't be impatient and so on. In the meanwhile, while I'm in Camp Home\nRun, October 1945, myself and a, a Spaniard, a Spanish national, two of us, was sworn into\nthe United States forces. We were sworn in by, by a major. A colonel. By a colonel, I'm\nsorry. And I had the papers for me ... I showed them to you. And when we were sworn in,\nand, uh, the other person, person's name was Raymond de la Fontana Quintas (ph). The only\nthing they made an error. They swore us in under regular Army form. So, there are two\nArmies, the peace Army is the United States Armed, you know, the Army that you, you, you\nare, uh, have to join when something happens like in the war you, you join, you are forced to\njoin the service. You, you are being, uh, uh, elected to join the service. Like during the war,\nthey, they take us in. And the other thing is the regular Army you have to be, a foreign, a\nnon-citizen cannot join the regular Army. So the War Department sent our papers back.\nAttached to the papers were the proper papers. But in the meanwhile my aunt was working\non my, uh, coming to the United States. So the colonel says to me, you don't want to join\nnow, cause you're going to be shipped to the Pacific to replace the forces. So this, that's what\nhappened to Raymond de la Fontana Quintas. He was sent to Far East and he became a\nregular Army person. He joined after, I mean he joined the Army of the United States, and\nafter that, he become a citizen, boom, right, right now. After you, after you're sworn you're\nnow a - they also swore you in as a citizen in those days, in war time. So, I didn't join. But\nthey gave me a job at Camp Home Run, in the, in the camp, to be in charge of the officers'\nlaundry and dry cleaning. And dry cleaning was done with gasoline. You soak it in gasoline,\nand then you hang it up. That was the dry cleaning. Laundry was done in, in, in the wash\ntubs, and I was in charge of that. And I stayed there until my aunt wrote a letter that there is a\nvery strong possibility that I will be able to come sometime in the Spring of 1946. They're\nworking on it. The only thing is she said you need, you need all the papers. You got to have a\npassport, you got to have a birth certificate. And I had none of that, see. So the Army gave\nme a furlough to go my home town. And that wasn't easy either, because I was in France,\nand Slovakia was in a Russian zone. So I got to Regensburg, Germany, and there the Army,\nuh, applied for the Russian zone, to let me come, to let me go across to Slovakia on the train.\nI come to my home town, which is Topol any. Go to City Hall, tell them who I was. They\ntell me, \"All Jewish records were destroyed.\" But they knew who I was. So I got nothing.\nGot back on the train. Came to Paris. Went to the Czechoslovakian Embassy; and they gave\nme a passport, no birth certificate. Went back to Le Havre, to Camp Home Run; told the\ncaptain what happened, told the chaplain what happened, and they all started to work on all\nmy papers. I got a judicial record from the Army, a record of what I did in the Army, and\nthat the uh Ambassador should uh accept this because of I, and my stay in a concentration\ncamp and all the records were destroyed. However, passport I got from Czechoslovakian\nEmbassy. That's the only legal paper. You know how I got this passport? I gave the guy a\ncarton of cigarettes, I remember that. And I needed three photos. So in Paris he tells me\nwhere there is a photographer on the street. Right around the, the Embassy 1s this, you get\nthree photos over there. And I, I looked like a scarecrow in Army uniform and, and, and in\nfact, I, I, I, this is the uniform I took a picture, my passport picture in. So I ran, you know,\nthis this is the kind of uniform, this, this 1s what, this is a little better. The other one I look\nlike a scarecrow. So I got this, everything together. Come back to the Ambassador. I gave\nhim a carton of cigarettes, he gave me the passport. Went back to Le Havre from Paris. Now\nI'm ready to go. Now I'm waiting for my aunt to get all, everything together.",
        "A: OK. So what happened, I got to Le Havre. The captain made arrangement for me to go\noutside of Paris, a place called Maison Lafitte, to live with a Red Cross Field Director,\nwaiting for my aunt's, all, everything the Army had done for me. And May 10th, 1946, I got\non a plane. Came to New York, came to some friends that knew my family. From there I\nwent to Detroit. And about a year later, I had met a young woman, young lady, also survivor,\nwhom I married a year later. We are now the proud parents of four children and four\ngrandchildren. And as we say, uh, among the survivors, from ashes to life. (Pause) This was\ntougher than, uh, tougher than talking, than lecturing, I'll tell you. (PAUSE) I couldn't take\nany more of it.\n(Conversation)",
        "A: What pictures do you want to do?",
        "A: We didn't do this one.",
        "A: Uh, this what the Nazis called the Orchestra Platz, the Orchestra Place where the band, the\nfinest musician, uh, Jewish musicians, from every European country, would play at the\nentrance to the, in and out of the camp, as we were marching to and from work.\n(Technical Conversation - Pauses)",
        "A: Which one should I show next?",
        "A: How's is that. This 1s the original crematorium in Auschwitz I. Which by the way 1s still\nstanding. Very primitive. The ones they built after that were the death factories in Birkenau.\nAuschwitz II. Oh, there's a small photo--I don't know if you can do anything with that at all.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nThis was the first American unit that I ran across that, I got this in Dachau, outside of\nDachau, and one of the GI's gave it to me. And I've been carrying it ever since. As you can\nsee, the cattle cars there, this is where all the bodies were unloaded. Of course, they un,\nunloaded by the, the Germans. The GI's brought the Germans to, to show them what what\nwas going on, like they didn't know. (Pause) Well, this is the entrance to hell. This is\nAuschwitz, entrance to Auschwitz, \"Arbeit Macht Frei,\" which by the way, Birkenau also\nhad a sign, \"Arbeit Macht Frei.\" They all had \"Arbeit Macht Frei.\" But this 1s the first one\nthat I've seen, I'm, that I came to. (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) All right. This - the\nhappy times, the American Army and Mike Vogel.",
        "A: I don't think so.",
        "A: Oh, the tent city! My goodness gracious. Well, I should have shown that one first. This is in\nCamp Lucky Strike. This in France, in a farm country in France, that we waited for to be\ntaken to Le Havre, France to be loaded on to ships to go back to the United States, except I\nstayed for another few months.\nEnd of tape #2\nTAPE #3\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Yes, uh, this was before Birkenau was built. Actually, they were building Birkenau. We\ndidn't know it, I didn't know it at the time, what was going on. But Himmler came there, and\nbefore Himmler came to Auschwitz, the camp had to be cleaned from, from top to bottom.\nThe streets of the camp were swept. They got rid of all the Muselmanns, all the skeleton-type\npeople. And we all went to be disinfected. We didn't know why. We didn't know who\nHimmler, we didn't even know, we knew of Himmler from before, but we didn't know why\nhe was coming or what was the reason. The only thing we knew that it was a big, big Nazi\nofficer coming and we were beaten by our Blockaltesters to get, get to the disinfectant area.\nAnd this is the way they disinfected us. They would take our clothes and put them, take them\naway from us and gave us new sets of striped uniforms with our numbers sewn back on the\nleft breast and the right, right pant leg. And we went to a disinfecting area. Small shower,\nshower with hardly, hardly any water pressure, but they would swoosh (ph), swoosh (ph),\nswoosh (ph), spritz (ph) us, uh, with some sort of a disinfectant, and then they would dress\nup, and when the time came from, for Heinrich Himmler, for the big-wig Nazi, to come to\nAuschwitz, to the, right to the camp, we were all lined up in front of our barracks, in front of\nour blocks. The Blockaltester made sure that we're standing straight, we're clean, and he\nfound one Polish Jew, Jewish boy, one of the buttons was missing of his tunic, of his jacket.\nAnd this Blockaltester, Mietek was his name, M -I- E- T-E-K. Mietek. He was a\nmurderer. He was a Polish, uh, uh, murderer. He was our Blockaltester, and he, he pride\nhimself that he could kill one person with a blow to the proper area in his neck. So he could\nkill him. And this poor, poor Jewish prisoner, Jewish boy got murdered with one blow and\ntaken away from there. And the camp was standing still, holding for Heinrich Himmler to\ncome and inspect the camp. I will never forget. I, I, in my time in Auschwitz, Himmler came\ntwice to Auschwitz, but I will never forget with this happening in my block, this, this murder\nin front of my block when Mietek, Mietek murdered him. And there were number, there\nwere more than one person like that. There was one other, a German prisoner they used to\ncall Monkey Tin (ph). He was another one. Mietek and Monkey Tin would have a bet who\ncan kill more people with one blow. And that's...this was Himmler's visit to Auschwitz.\nThat's how they cleaned up the camp. First, they got rid of all the people that didn't look well\nenough. The streets were swept, the barracks were cleaned. Of course, Himmler never went\ninto the barrack. The only thing, he came is just march with the Lageraltester whose name\nwas Rudolph Hoess by the way.\u201d Rudolph Hoess was the commandant of Auschwitz. And\nthis commandant of Auschwitz, Mr. Rudolph Hoess, would walk with Heinrich Himmler\nand other lieutenants, their... their lieutenants, and just go from barrack to barrack on the\n* Rudolph Hoess was the commandant of Auschwitz.\ninspection. Yes ma'am.",
        "A: Yes, well, Mengele arrived to Birkenau, not to Auschwitz, in May 1943. I still remember\nwhen, uh, there too a big fuss was made about the doctors. The doctors were the ones.\nBecause 1n all the Krankenbaus, all the, all the sick bays, where ever they put prisoners, there\nnever doctors. The only reason doctors came there is to make a selection in who was no\nlonger was fit to be kept alive or selected to go to the gas chambers. And they had a holding,\nthey was a 7, 11 block in Birkenau. Block 7 in Auschwitz. And this 1s the block that they\nwould take prisoners that were already on their way, on the to the gas chambers, gas\nchambers. And they would hold them there until they had enough, and then they would just\nwalk them in Birkenau to, to the crematorias. So, but mostly I remember Mengele, first about\nthe Mengele selections in the camp, OK. Of course, we didn't know when the selection\nwould be. But all of a sudden, in most cases on a Sundays, cause everyone was in, in the\ncamp. The whole camp was taken out to Appellplatz, to roll call place, lined up in rows of\nfive, stripped naked, and your clothing was dropped by you in front of your feet. And\nMengele, with the, with the Lager... Lageraltester, who was a prisoner, and the Lagerfuhrer,\nand also the commandant; they would go from barrack to barrack, block to block. And\nbehind Mengele was a prisoner registrar--a Schreiber what they called--and as Mengele\nwould, this is how, how it would be. You in a row of five, always in rows of five. The first\nfive, step forward. Mengele would walk in front and in back. As he walked this way, left or\nright, left or right, and those who picked up their clothing were still staying alive, because,\nwe didn't know, we found out later how it worked. First, first time, second time, you didn't\nknow which, what was going on. If you living or if you going to die now. Those who left\ntheir clothing were taken into a holding block and Mengele's selections would last practically\nall day because by the time he completed - Birkenau was a huge camp - by the time he\ncompleted the whole camp, OK, after he finished the camp, those who of course the clothing\nstayed behind were taken into another block and waited until everybody was taken from all,\nthe whole camp, then they were standing there. You could hear them yell, scream, and beg\nfor water, beg for, for help. They knew where they were going see. See, and those of us who\nstayed, we picked up our clothing. Then with whips and sticks by the SS and by the Kapos\nand by the Blockaltester, by the Stubedienst, all the big-wigs of the prisoners and the SS, we\nwere beaten into a, uh, shower area. And we bundled our clothing with a piece of wire with\nthe number outside and threw them in a huge gas chamber, in, in a room, where Zyklon B\ngas was put on the clothing to disinfect the clothing. They disinfected the clothing while they\ndisinfected us. Spray a little water and they sprayed us with some disinfecting, uh, water,\nsome sort of a disinfecter. And then they opened the gas chamber, the room where, where\nthe clothing was, and you started looking for your clothing. But the gas fumes were still\nthere. And I'll never forget, I got weak and dizzy from the gas fumes one time. And, uh, I\nwas fainting and my friend, Buchler and Fisher, which I mentioned before, grabbed me\nunder their arms and took me outside and ran me back and forth, breathing for air. And that's\nhow they got me through. That's how I came out of that. I already had enough gas in me so\nif, if those two boys weren't there I wouldn't be alive. I would have died right there. So we\npicked up our clothing, we put our clothing on, were taken back to the barracks, back to our\nown blocks. The other thing I remember about Mengele very vividly is when the transports\nwere coming in. He was the one who would be in charge at the railroad, at the siding, at, at\nwhat they, the Nazis called it the Rampe, the ramp. When he came to the ramp, the first thing\nhe would do when he, when he, he had the people lined up, the able-bodied ones, he would\nget rid of those first. He would ask them, how old are you, what is your profession, what is\nyour name, , what is your profession and how old are you. And\nleft, right, left, right and so on. After he got rid of all these, of course, another thing he was\nlooking, pregnant women and twins. We really didn't know what he was doing with them at\nthe time. But he would, he called them \"Schlingen\" (ph) [Zwillingen?], the twins. He would\ntake the twins into his area. I would see Mengele every transport and especially in early May\n1944 when the Hungarian Jews were brought in. When the Hungarian Jews came, Mengele\nwas there constantly. He had a motorcycle, and he would ride in the camp, up and down the\ncamp, just looking, on the motorcycle, looking for anything that he wanted to look at. Of\ncourse, we didn't know what he was looking at. Always afraid of this man. I can still\nremember his, his piercing eyes and he'll, he'll, Mengele had dark hair and when he, when\nhe, there were two people that we were deathly afraid of. Actually three. Palich (ph) was\none. Palich was another one who was. He, Palich actually did this. Palici's favorite thing was\nto do to line people up in Auschwitz--Auschwitz I-- against the wall to see how many he\ncould kill with one bullet. A friend of mine, close friend of mine, knew of Palish quite well. I\ndidn't know much about Palish except I knew who he was, that he was a murderer, and he\nalso ride, rode a motorcycle. He would line up people, two three people in a row, see how\nmany he could kill with one bullet. Lined them up together. And the third person, who also\ncame in '43, actually end of '43 I think, whose name was Hauptsturmfthrer Moll, M - O - L -\nL. He became in charge of the crematorias. And also, he also was the mentor of the pits, the\npits that they were digging because the crematorias couldn't, couldn't hold enough people,\nburn and gas enough people fast enough. So he used the pits to burn the people. But the pits\ndidn't work well. Because I remember the Greek transports that came and and he, he took\nsome of the Greek boys working the pits and with bare feet they were, they were stomping\nthe hot ashes for after the people, the hot coals after the people were, were burned tn there.\nAnd the bodies just kept, kept coming back up.",
        "A: There was a French set of twins, French boys. One was already there already, Mengele\nalready had him. And, I remember when they came for the second set...second guy, second\nperson, the second twin, this poor boy yelled and screamed. Oh yeah, I still...I can still just\nabout hear his screaming, screeching, as they were taking him. The Nazis came, the SS came\nto take this guy to Mengele. And they took him. That's the last time we've seen him. He was\ncastrating the boys, lot of boys, too.",
        "A: No, I didn't. No. None of us have. There, oh, I shouldn't say none of us have. There was\nsome doctors, prison doctors that worked with Mengele, but of course, we didn't, we didn't\nhave anything to do with that.",
        "A: Only what I heard from, from people that were connected, that he was, uh, trying to, uh, uh,\nforce the labor out, to pull the babies out of...out of their wombs. I heard that from from other\npeople. And we knew girls that that worked...worked in Canada that also knew some girls\nthat worked closer to the, to the Krankenbau area so a lot of times when Mengele worked in\nsome of the sick, sick bay - he had a room, he had rooms there where he did the\nexperimentation.",
        "A: His full name is Hans Lipsky (ph). He's a Latvian. Latvian national. He was an SS guard in\nAuschwitz. He worked the railroad sidings where transports came. He was a murderer. He\nwas a killer. To him, I...l remember, not only him but people like him, when transports came,\ntransports came, we would sometimes unload the children. And take them off the train, off\nthe cattle car. I remember one of the boys holding a little child, a little baby, and he takes out\nhis pistol and shoots the baby in the, in the prisoner's hand. There was another one,\nUntersturmfuhrer Otto. There was a Graff and another one whose name was Hans. Hans\nwould whistle, uh...uh, operas, and at the same time would murder these poor people coming\noff the train. Just right on the tracks. Right on the railroad siding. This guy would sing and,\nand murder. I seen him once kick a kid like a soccer ball, when the kid was crying. Kicked\nhim from his mother's arms. And Hans Lipsky was a guard. He was not an officer, he was\njust a guard. A murderer, like most of them were. And most of these people when they, those\nwho guarded the the tracks and railroad siding, would be drinking before they got there so\nthat they were fortified, so that they could do, do this job better. That was their ration, this\nbooze. And and I remember they they all had flasks with whiskey in it and they would just\ndrink enough so they could be practically immune to anything that was going on. So I\nidentified Hans Lipsky. It's been five years now. Uh, from the OSI came a person who was at\nthe time the Assistant Director; because then there was Ryan, who was the main person, and\nNeal Sher was in command. He got my name from some, some other Auschwitz survivors,\nand he asked me if I could come to Washington to identify this person. I said, well I don't\nthink I can get away you know, so fast, so he said I must travel to see some people, could I\ncome to Indianapolis. This is where I live. Could you meet me at the airport. So he came on\na Saturday afternoon, and I met him at the airport, and he identified themselves. He checked\nin, and then we went to his room, and in his room, he started to investigate. Started to\nactually interrogate me like I was one of the prisoners, one of the Nazis, the way he was\ngoing about it. And, uh, after, he wrote everything, whatever I told him, he, he had it down,\nhe had a tape, and one of the last things that he did, in his briefcase, he had eight mug shots\nof people. And he told me, I want you to study these mug shot, mug shots, and if you can\nidentify anyone, I want you to put your finger on it and hold it there and I'll let you know\nwhat to do next. I looked at this mug shots, photo of eight, eight mug shots, and\nthey were marked from one to eight. And I looked, and I put my finger on number three.\nAnd I said, here is your man. And if I remember what I said to him, I said, and this is, this\nguy's name is Hans. And he said to me, Mr. Vogel, I want you to sign your full name under\nthis photo, and date it. And all the other ones I want you to initial and date. And after I\ncompleted the, the paper work, he says to me, you have identified Hans Lipsky who's going\nto be tried in Chicago on such and such and such a time and so on. And the trial was due to\nbe the day after Christmas. And on my way to work I was listening to NPR, National Public\nRadio, and they mentioned that Hans Lipsky elected to be deported instead of going to trial.\nHe was deported to West Germany. When I got to work I got a call from Neal Sher's office.\nThis Eli Rosenbaum was working for Sher and he gave me the call. He says, there is no trial.\nHans Lipsky elected to be deported. He is being deported to West Germany. He's been by\nhimself to West Germany but we do want you to know that if in case there is going to be a\ntrial, would you be willing to go to West Germany. And that is the last, last thing I heard\nabout Hans Lipsky. He is probably living, ah, a life of Riley in West Germany.",
        "A: Well, I give you a Sunday life in Auschwitz, for instance. Sunday was the day of rest for the\nNazis, of course. But the damn day of rest was sport, sport with us. For us, it was shaving\neach other, trying to get clean; which was almost impossible because water was nonexistent\nin Birkenau. We shaved each other; and in summer time we tried to air our uniforms off,\ndelouse ourselves with our hands, but that was not allowed by the Nazis. They would come\nand do calisthenics with us. They would make us go on our down below and do frog jumps,\nfrog leaps. And then they would make us roll on the ground. Then roll back and forward. Do\npush-ups. Run. Get into the ditches into mud. Roll in the mud in the ditches. And if you\ndidn't do it fast enough, you got beaten. And then they would beat us up because we were\ndirty. Or muddy. Everyday in Auschwitz, you never knew when your number came up.\nAnother thing was to see when you went to work, when you went to slave labor, who was no\nlonger there. Who was, who's left. And it became, it became like, like, like an animal. Oh,\nI'm, I'm living another day, or he's, he's no longer, and and you know, the worst part, that you\ncouldn't cry for it. You couldn't cry. You couldn't cry in Auschwitz. You cried, you died. If\nyou, if you, 1f you show even more weakness than you already had, you didn't survive the\nday. You know, I remember once, here's another one. I got caught in Canada Kommando\npicking up sardines and giving it to a girl. Gave this sardines as I was carrying the bundle,\nNazi picks me up. And a Kapo came there and the Kapo starts slapping me around, starts\nbeating me. So, for punishment I was put into a Strafkommando [NB: punishment brigade].\nAnd how do I translate Strafkommando? Straf is a...1s you being punished, \"sin kommando.\"\nI don't know if it translates well in English. Always the Strafkommando consisted of, first of\nall, the Kapo of the Strafkommando was a murderer, a former German prisoner who was a\nmurderer. He was our Kapo, our leader. And the job was cutting seaweeds in water, with two\nof us. It was, was a chain saw, it was a saw on a chain, like a, like a, how would you call tt,\nlike , OK, that had sharp thing and you cut it. And what the Nazi would do\nbehind us, they would send a Kapo, a Unterkapo...an Unterkapo, his assistant, and they\nwould dunk our heads in the water to see how long we can stay in, under the water. I was\nthere for two weeks, and one of my friends paid off with a kind of riches, he paid off the\nproper people. And I was taken back into Canada Kommando. And when I came back the SS\nman who caught me, the greeting would be such: . Till next time,\nyou old bandit, you still alive. And they, in a way, they say, oh, this guy survived. They, they\nwere, you know, say, look, what else I can do with him. Another thing that you learned as\nyou became an older prisoner, to be at the right place at the right time, which was not easy.\nThey, Nazis, SS would say, . They would yell out, three men. You went, most\ncases one of you didn't return. They would kill you as you were doing some sort of work.\nAnd as you got an older, became an older prisoner, when an SS man called for three men,\nyou would say, , cause they always meant three plus you. You stayed behind,\nbecause if you went again, your first time. I've got a mark on my neck here. I was hit by a\nshovel, on my neck. I thought I was going to be killed. That mark is still there. Also, when\nthey called drei man, it was digging and wasn't digging fast enough, and the SS just hit me\nfull force on my neck. And they indented my neck, and its been there ever since Auschwitz.",
        "A: No, no, I didn't. When these two boys escaped, and when anyone escaped, we were in a way\nnot happy about, about it. And again I must explain, we didn't know what was going on on\nthe outside world. But the reason we were not happy because we suffered. We had to stand\nand on roll call until this poor soul was either caught, murdered, and then we were all beaten\nanyway. Because the Kapos and Blockaltesters who were also out standing there at the roll\ncall with us, they would be the ones who beat us because the Jew escaped, see.",
        "A: Well, uh, now, uh, you know, after thirty years not speaking about my experiences, finally,\nour youngest daughter Elaine, who practically made me do what I'm doing today, speaking\non Holocaust, and the most important reason 1s because I want to bear witness because very\nsoon there will not be an Auschwitz survivor or Dachau survivor and then Auschwitz will\nonly be a legend. But I must be very blunt. I survived because of Canada Kommando. Good,\nbad or indifferent, I survived because I was assigned to work in Canada Kommando. But I\nmust say that Canada Kommando was not just a group that worked unloading people. We\nwere told before we went to the transport what is expected of us. If any one of us will ever\ndare to tell the people what is going on, will not live the day through. So now that I talk\nabout it and I tell them that I survived and the reason, everyone survived for a reason,\nbecause in Auschwitz the Nazi law said that was no one can survive longer than three\nmonths on the food, the hygiene, and the work and and the torturing that he gets longer than\nthree months. If you live longer than three months, you are doing something that is not\naccording to the camp's rules. You either get more food someplace. You do get more food\nsomeplace, or you have someone else helping you to to survive, see. So when I tell some\npeople about Canada, I told, I was Bloomington at the Indiana University a couple of years\nago, and I'm speaking to graduate students, a class of graduate students. They were learning\nHolocaust, teaching Holocaust there, and I told the group about Canada Kommando, and of\ncourse questions and answers are usually very strong, and I really am quite immune to the\nquestions because I answer them exactly, right from the shoulders. This young woman told\nme that her mother told her than the Canada Kommandos in her mind were murderers.\nMurderers, because when she arrived to Auschwitz, 1t was the Canada Kommando who lined\nthem up 1n rows of five and one of the Canada Kommando slapped her. And I said, \"It is\npossible, but a Canada Kommando person was only doing what he had to do. If he didn't do\nit he was shot right on the spot. He was murdered right on the spot. And I give you another\nexample, another little story. I remember a transport came from Theresienstadt, 1943. Early\nspring of 1943. And we were unloading this transport, busy, this was the busiest night I ever\nseen at the railroad, uh, siding. There was a young woman with a child with her. And the\nchild was restless and and crying, and the mother was trying to calm the baby, calm the\nchild--six, seven-year-old child. All of a sudden, the mother looks; and a Red Cross truck is\nmoving towards us. And she's telling the little girl, \"Oh, Red Cross is already here. Pretty\nsoon we will be in our place.\" And a young Jewish Slovakian boy ran by there; and he told\nthem, \"Lady, that's not Red Cross. Take a look behind. You see the chimney. In one hour's\ntime, you're going to be gassed. You're going to be burned.\" And she went and sees an SS\nofficer and tells him that, this woman. She tells the SS officer about this man: \"This man told\nus you're going to gas us, you're going to burn us.\" He said, \"Look, Lady, he's a criminal.\nDon't...he's going to be dealt with.\" And he dealt with he was; because after we had loaded\neverybody, we all went behind the cattle cars and slowly they murdered him. Everyone of\nthem just murdered the young boy slowly, just murdered the young boy slowly. Carried him\nback to Auschwitz on our shoulders. And the Red Cross truck. You know what the Red\nCross truck brought? The Zyklon B gas cans. That's how it was carried into Birkenau. So\nthat was the Red Cross truck. And there are so many things, you know, that...the...as I'm\ntalking to you, there's just, you know, for a survivor, every survivor has a story. Is a story.\nThe end is always, always the same. And every survivor survived because of something. Not\nbecause he was strong; because the strong ones were falling just as easy as, as the weak ones.\nAnd really, none of us believed you're going to survive that. It...it was...I'd been in\nAuschwitz two and a half years; and I was in--between Sachsenhausen, Auschwitz, Dachau,\nI was over three years just in concentration camp, plus so many months in, in, in Arbeitlagers\n(ph), work camps. So from 1939 to 1945, we all suffered and, uh, uh, because of the Nazi\nregime and you know, every survivor, we didn't believe that we're going to make it. There 1s\nno survivor that will tell you I'm going to survive Auschwitz. They never talked about it.\nYou know what the main, the most important thing was, to go to sleep at night with a full\nstomach, so if you die, you don't die hungry. Another thing was in Auschwitz,\n\"Organizierung\"-- organizing. We all had to organize. We all knew how to barter. And of\ncourse, the resistance group, see. People say the Jews, we the Jews walked into the gas\nchambers like lambs, like sheep. Believe me, those of us who were there a long time, we had\nan underground organization, without radios, without anything. Communications such as we\nall knew how to communicate from the other camps, somehow or other. For instance, there\nwas a Leichen (ph) Kommando, which was the people that picked up the dead. This man, he\nbuilt a wagon, he had a wagon, and he built a false bottom. This guy's name is Joe Newman\n(ph) and he lives in Skokie. And he would carry things to the girls' camp, information.\nInformation to person...you had him here not long ago, Erich Kulka. And Erich Kulka would\ncarry it from camp to camp to camp, and to the resisters. To the girls that worked in\nmunitions factory. Which was Kulka's job. Kulka did that. Kulka was the one who, uh, got\nthe girls from the munition factory. And they got enough gun powder so the\nSonderkommando blew up one of the crematorias. Of course, they were murdered\nunfortunately, they were killed.",
        "A: No, no. I did not. We knew about it but I did not. So you see, when, when people tell you\nthat, uh, uh, surviving, those that survived, they are, they are a story, that's a different breed,\nand especially those who were in Auschwitz as long as I have been, as long as, you know,\nmyself and the others, Kulka, Vrba.",
        "A: Absolutely. From, we used to bring...for the escapees, we used, we used to smuggle stuff in\nourselves.",
        "A: Uh, clothing for them, so they have civilian clothes. And that would be given to group such\nas Kraus and Kulka, that type of stuff. Shoes. And we didn't know why. OK. They didn't tell\nus these tomorrow, you know, you never knew who would - there was a Hebrew word, a\nYiddish word \"moser.\" A \"moser\" is a guy who tells on someone, who goes and snitches on\nsomeone. There was snitches among us. And the reason there was snitches, again, selfish,\ntrying to survive that way. The Nazis, they didn't let them survive. They get their\ninformation, then they kill them.",
        "A: I was very small, and my pants were kind of big. I would be lined with clothing, civilian\nclothing inside, after examining us, the clothing would be in an area as they put us in line,\nsome of us snuck in and you put the clothing in your pants. And we snuck it in and someone\nin the camp already knew that I had it. But you see, it was a dangerous thing to do. Because\nthe Canada Kommando was not only searched on the Canada grounds, we would also be\nsearched sometimes at the gate. See. And if you got caught you got killed.",
        "A: The clothing would be picked up by a courier like, like, not a prisoner, who couldn't wore\nthem anyway because he had to have a striped clothes like me. And he would take it to the\nperson that would be doing the escaping.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. There was a big black market there. Constantly.",
        "A: Uh, that was down with the civilians actually. Cause you couldn't black market much with,\nbarter with another prisoner. What could he give you? We would buy chicken sometimes.\nCooked chickens. From the Polish civilians. The ones that worked in Auschwitz. Vodka was\nbrought into the camp. Cigarettes. For gold, for diamonds, watches, which we, which we\ntook from the Canada Kommando. You know, American dollars was a very common thing\nin Auschwitz. Thousand dollar bills, hundred dollar bills, there was nothing to it. Twenty\ndollar gold pieces you would find in the clothing. And this was all survival of the fittest.\nSurvival of the people that thought maybe, maybe, maybe. Never believe you're going to\nmake it, but there was always a slight, slight glimmer of hope. What are you buying the food\nfor, so you give it to your girlfriend, your sister, your brother, your mother, and throw it over\nthe fence. Auschwitz was a constant organizeering, organizing, constantly going on.\nBetween the Kapos who you had to pay off, the Blockaltester who you had to pay off. The\nBlockaltester who was in charge of Block 29, the Canada Kommando, he lived like a king in\nAuschwitz because he was our god. And to him we brought the riches. For better treatment,\nfor taking care of our friends who got typhus. See I had typhus, I, I, I had, I acquire typhus, I\ngot typhus in 1943 in Canada, and at the time I was already in Birkenau. And two my\nfriends, Fisher and Buchler, I don't know if I, I mentioned these two boys prior. Here I have\ntyphus. The first thing that happens to you in typhus, you lose your hearing, and you echo,\nyour equilibrium, am I saying it wrong. You loose that, you lose your balance. These two\nboys would hold me under their arm with my cap off and march me through the gate, take\nme to Canada Platz where we worked the Canada warehouse. When transport didn't come,\nwe all worked at the warehouse. Sorting the clothing. They marched me through there, take\nme to the girls' section without the Nazis see it and the girls would cover me with bundles of\nclothing and make hot water for me with lemons. We had lemons, you could, what people\nbrought with them. And that's how they got me well. Not quite well, because I ended up in,\nin the block which was called the Krankenbau, and again, here was a Polish couple in charge\nof the block. And this friend of my named Fisher would pay them off to take care of me.\nBecause Mengele came every day to make a selection to, to go to gas chamber. Now they\ngot too hot, that he knew that I was on my last leg, that's when he brought me back and he\nsaid to Fisher, I can't keep him no more. You got to take him back to the barrack. So I\nsurvived Krankenbau with typhus. And that Canada Kommando, and again the girls took\ncare of me until I got well.\nEnd of Tape #3\nConclusion of Interview\n"
