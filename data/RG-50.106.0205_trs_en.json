        "Q: And what name were you born with?",
        "A: Malvy Isaac.",
        "Q: When were you born?",
        "A: I was born on, actually born on January 12\", 1938 but declared officially on January 17\nbecause my father was unable to go to register the birth because of anti-Semitism. So officially\non January 17, 1938.",
        "Q: When you say because of anti-Semitism, they were not permitting Jews to register births.",
        "A: There was some kind of a skirmish and they were beating up every Jew there to get out of the\nhouse. So my father was afraid to go. So I\u2019m five days younger.",
        "Q: And then when it calmed down a bit then he was able to go to register?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: They made him put a later date the later date?",
        "A: Yes the later date.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013",

        "A: Iam an only child.",
        "Q: Let us talk about your parents and how long your family had been in Romania. You were\nborn in what city?",
        "A: I was born in Bacu, Romania which was on the eastern side, actually northeastern side of\nRomania. Both my parents come up from very simple background. I am actually the first person\nwho ever went to, above fourth grade or something. I have never known my grandparents,\nexcept my maternal grandmother. My paternal grandmother was killed during World War I. And\nmy paternal grandparents both died from an epidemic of cholera. So my father and his four\nsiblings were raised by a grandfather. Even a grandmother was not available. She died too from\ncholera. So in this situation my parents didn\u2019t go to school except to learn how to read and write\nand when they were able, I think at age ten or 11, 12 maximum, they had to learn some kind of a\nprofession in order to be able to exist. So my father learned to be a tailor and my mother learned\nto be a seamstress. They were very wonderful people. My mother was full of pep and\noptimistic. My father was very intelligent and he sat with an encyclopedia in every single day\njust to learn and very interested in politics of course.",
        "Q: What were their names?",
        "A: My mother name was Laura and my father\u2019s name was Jacob, just like my grandson. And\nthey, my father was born in Iasi which is a bigger city also in the eastern side, but he found work\nin Bacu. That\u2019s where he met my mother. They got married and \u2014",
        "Q: She was from Bacu?",
        "A: Yes. She was from Bacu. They got married in 1936. And, because they both worked they\nmade money. They moved out from the ghetto cause my mother lived with her mother with my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\ngrandmother in a Jewish enclave, let\u2019s say. Not call a ghetto. So they moved out and they got an\napartment and it even had a bathroom and they did very, very well until the war came.",
        "Q: Do you remember what street?",
        "A: Where they lived. No I don\u2019t remember. I know where it is though cause they showed me\nexactly where it was. They did very well financially, socially, but then the war came and because\nmy father was such an excellent and known in -- The city was about 40,000 people so everybody\nknew that he was the best tailor in town. So of course they -- he was taken away with the\nintention to use him to make suits for the upper echelon of the military. And he was taken away\nto a certain military camp which was far away from us. You needed to go by train at least five,\nsix hours.",
        "Q: What year are we talking about?",
        "A: We\u2019re talking 1941, 42, something like this. 41, I would say. So my mother was the only, left\nto be the only breadwinner. Therefore she had to move out of that apartment and come back and\nlive with my grandmother in that Jewish ghetto. That\u2019s the house that I remember.",
        "Q: What street was that on, do you remember that street?",
        "A: Leka, strada Leka, famous for dirt and misery. My grandmother\u2019s house was close to a\nriver. It\u2019s called Bistrita and across from the stables where somebody who had a business of,\nkept the horses. This is where the house was. The house you went down into the house, not up\ninto the house. Had two rooms. One room where you cooked, you slept, you sat, you did\neverything and the other room was for guests. I never knew why, why we never used that. There\nwas never any guests but that\u2019s my grandmother. She was beautiful. I remember the melihki [ph]\ndishes on the wall like this, on a little shelf. There was no running water and no bathroom. There\nwas a like an outhouse of some sort. I remember being me being maybe three and a half or four\nand going with a pail. I would say three, four hundred feet where the water spout was. But I\ndidn\u2019t know any better. I was happy that our neighbors loved me or I used to go to a friend that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nhad eight, nine siblings. And play with them and come home full of lice. And, but I was happy.\nMy mother was working every single day. And she \u2014",
        "Q: As a seamstress?",
        "A: As a seamstress. She went to people\u2019s houses for the day to either make dresses or repairs or\nwhatever. And she made sure that we have -- food was impossible to obtain. There was no food,\nbut she somehow she was able to bring the bread or the cornmeal that was the main sustenance,\nmain meal I would say and I wouldn\u2019t eat it of course. I was a very skinny child. And I\nremember like yesterday. I mean there are some things that\u2019s so imprinted that my mother went\nto work for the day for a lady who had a toy store. So at the end of the day the lady asked what\nwould you like, money or something from the store? So she said I want the nicest doll that you\nhave. So there she comes home with a doll in one hand and with a bag with two eggs. Two eggs\nwas like gold. And she comes to the house and as I told you, you came down in the house, three\nsteps to go in the house. And I saw that doll and I jumped on her. The eggs fell and they broke\nand that\u2019s the first doll that I had that closed and opened the eyes. It was -- I had it for years and\nit was the most fantastic thing. I don\u2019t think I was more than three and a half. Another memory\nin that particular place, except that the smell coming from the stables and I was so afraid of\nhorses. And is that the Germans by the time they got to where \u2014 that\u2019s why we were lucky we\ndidn\u2019t end up in a concentration camp cause it was close to Russia. They have some other\nworries and, but they were bombing. They were bombing and throwing \u2014 where do you go?\nThere was no place to shelter from the bombs. So we used to run into an open space with a\ncrater, previously made by another bomb and that\u2019s where we were lying down and I thought it\nwas the greatest entertainment seeing the planes just going this way and that way and so on and\nso forth.\nWas very traumatic for me is that I grew up without a father. In 1944, when 45, when the war\nwas over my father came home and I couldn\u2019t understand why do we have a strange man living\nin our house. And eventually he went back to work. They moved out \u2014",
        "Q: We\u2019ll talk about that in a minute. I want to go back to the war time. So here you are this little\nchild. Your mother goes off to work and what did you do?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013",
        "A: What did I do?",
        "Q: I know you were so young.",
        "A: Yeah, I remember going to some kind of kindergarten or some \u2014 it was school. A Jewish\nschool, of course. The school, my mother always wanted the best for me, like any mother. And\nshe sent me, it was a fortune to send me to that particular school. And it was very far away from\nhome. And there was no way to get there except walking. And the schedule was you go in the\nmorning. You come home for lunch. You go back and forth. If I would tell you, that was at least\na mile and a half or two. But back then you let your child walk. There weren\u2019t too many cars.\nThere were no street signs or lights or anything of that sort. But I hated going there because\nwhat do you teach rich people? You teach them manners, how to eat. You teach them how to\nwaltz and tango and music and things like this. And I didn\u2019t like that at all because I already\nknew how to read and that was \u2014",
        "Q: This is during, we\u2019re talking about during the war.",
        "A: Yes. During the war, before. Before. We were still with my grandmother and I already\nknew letters and I knew I was already four or five years old. And that was I hated every single\nday to go to that particular -- There were only rich kids there, you know.",

        "Q: From the other children you didn\u2019t because they were Jewish",
        "A: Not from the other children but during a new year\u2019s you know, new year\u2019s eve, they used to\nwear costume like we do for Purim or something. And intentionally come into our street and\nscare the children.",
        "Q: This is the non-Jewish would come in costume.",
        "A: Costume and scared us and we knew to run away and go home but it was scary. But that\u2019s the\nonly time that I knew that I\u2019m different. Otherwise when you grow up with only with Jewish\npeople, and especially my grandmother was extremely, extremely religious. To the point that\nwhen we moved out she wouldn\u2019t drink water in our house because she said we\u2019re not kosher\nenough for her.",

So I expected to see red people. I didn\u2019t know what it is and we all went out in the\nstreet, on the street to see them marching by. This is \u2014 but later encounters were not very pleasant\nwith the Russians.",

We have never seen one\nbecause it was, they started being defeated and they didn\u2019t have time for the Jews I guess. That\u2019s\nhow we were saved. They went more to the northern part like this, like what Elie Wiesel and\nseek it, and we were a little more to the south. That\u2019s how we \u2014 this came, but the Romanians\nwere just as bad.

I loved to read books and\nbecause I was very skinny my father used to give me, I don\u2019t know five cents if I drank a glass of\nmilk. So I was to take the five cents and go to the bookstore and buy a book. I loved books and I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nloved to go to the movies.

How are you going to stay here?\nSo finally when one of my mother\u2019s sisters from who lived in the capital, in Bucharest left, she\nwent with them.

        "A: I don\u2019t think they talked about this in front of me. No. We had the Russians that were at our\nthroats, continuously. They used to come to the store and look for something to drink.",

        "A: I don\u2019t remember finishing the war. To me it\u2019s a continuing saga. I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think I\nremember when 1945 came and the war was over. Don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t. And are there any, until the end of the war, any blatantly anti-Semitic incidents\nthat you remember?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013",

        "Q: Luxury.",
        "A: Luxury and I was happy at that point. At that point I was a happy child. And they closed the\nJewish school. The communists came. They said there couldn\u2019t, shouldn\u2019t be religious schools.\nSo I had to go to another school where I stayed in that school until I finished high school. But \u2014",
        "Q: And there were non-Jewish children at school?",
        "A: Non Jewish children. I have non-Jewish friends.",
        "Q: So you were friends with them? Were you comfortable with them, because up to that point\nyou said you know obviously you had only been with Jewish \u2014",
        "A: Most of my friends were still Jewish but I had some non-Jewish. And I, I was very upset that\nI\u2019m not learning Hebrew anymore. The teacher that taught me Hebrew in the Jewish school was\nhired. You had a choice. French was mandatory. Russian was mandatory and you had a choice\nof a third language. So she was made a Yiddish, to teach Yiddish. They didn\u2019t want to\ncompletely abolish I guess, so I signed up for her class. Just because I loved her as a Hebrew\nteacher. I \u2014",
        "Q: But you already knew Yiddish. You said you spoke to \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013",
        "A: Yes, but not to read or write or not at that \u2014 but I mostly signed up because nobody else\nwanted to be in a Yiddish class and I wanted because of her mostly because of her. Not because I\nneeded it. You know. And then they abolished that too eventually, they did. In Romania, they\nwere only ten. You don\u2019t\u2019 go to 12\u2122 grade but when you reach the tenth grade, you\u2019re done with\nhigh school. I remember an incident. I was very competitive and I always wanted to have straight\nA\u2019s. And I always, I guess when you are not a beautiful girl cause P\u2019ve never been beautiful but\nwhen you have the brains you do want to be good at something. If you\u2019re not very good looking,\nthen you want to be good at something else. And I had a friend who was not Jewish. One of the\nteachers was the wife of a man who was executed for being a criminal, war criminal. She was\nour teacher. I think it was science teacher of some sort. And she gave that non-Jewish girl an A,\nten. They used to go from one to ten. And she gave me a nine. And I went to her and I said I\ndon\u2019t think it\u2019s right because I know as much as she does. I think that the grade, but it\u2019s just\nbeing too competitive. What\u2019s a nine and what\u2019s a ten. You know. I had to be the best. So she\nsaid no. She said no. I said why don\u2019t you check us out? Let\u2019s see who knows more.\nSo she, she put us in front of the class and started asking us from the whole material of the whole\nyear you know. And I knew I\u2019m good at science because this is what I eventually did. You know\nI\u2019m never let her go. And that to me, it was beating anti-Semitism. Cause you have to do\nsomething. Not to keep your mouth shut. I could have, they could have, I don\u2019t know maybe\nthrow me out from the school or something. You don\u2019t just do things like this, yes.

And I watched a lot of tv. I didn\u2019t understand. And\nthen I went and I took a course at Georgetown, intensive course every day, every day, every day\nfor a month and a half. This is all my education in English.\nAnd then my parents came and we moved into a tiny house not far from here. It was Lockridge,\nit\u2019s off University. And Chaim was the only one working. We had another baby and I said time\nfor me. I have my parents. Time for me to return to my profession somehow. And I had the\ninitial exam that I took that allows you to work under supervision, meaning to be again an intern\nand again a resident and so on and so forth.\nAnd I went to the University of Maryland, department of preventive medicine and I interviewed\nfor a residency or an internship first. And they got me in that because I have two small children\nand I said I cannot spend my days running up and down hospital corridors. I was already 38.\nJust 39. [had a baby at 39. And I said I have to do something else. So I, what I start, I had my\nmother to help me so I did an internship at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, preventive\nmedicine. I did a residency there. The residency included a paid master in public health from\nJohns Hopkins which I adored every minute. To do that. And, but it wasn\u2019t easy. You know you\nhave two children. You have a husband, you have a house. It\u2019s not easy. I stayed with\nUniversity of Maryland about four and a half years. When I decided that this is not for me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nAcademia 1s not for people that are open and frank and tell the truth like me. This is for people\nthat know how to \u2014 not, it\u2019s just not for me. I\u2019m not this type of person. I come from a different\nbackground in which speaking up or telling the truth is the norm, not. And I told Chaim, even if\nit means never to work again, I can\u2019t do this type of work. Also, I was the lowest on the totem\npole there and every project that nobody else wanted and I am the top w --. So I quit.\nThree months later, it was in 1984 I got a job with the Department of Veterans Affairs. I worked\nuntil 2010 and I did a mitzvah on a daily basis. I either helped the veteran or widow or a prisoner\nof war. I did something good. And there I am. I\u2019m 76 and looking back, would I change things?\nProbably not. It\u2019s not easy to live on three continents like I did. And you know people said how\nmany languages do you speak? I say this and this and this and that. Oh how exciting. Not to me.\nI was forced into that. It\u2019s forced for Russian, forced for French. There Iam. I come here. I\nhave to go to Johns Hopkins and write papers and do presentations. And then at the Department\nof Veterans Affairs, we have to, we had seminars and we had lectures there. Sometimes I didn\u2019t\nmind which is not for this. But if you make it clear and concise and have a good slides it goes.\nYou know you can do it.\nAnd I remember being interviewed for the Shoah project and at the end they asked me so give us\na final like a summary of \u2014 and I\u2019Il tell you exactly what I said because this 1s my summary if\nyou want to ask me something else, Pll be happy to answer it. Look at me. I have two\nwonderful boys. Mention one has a PhD. The other one went to college and is a producer for a\nshow. I have a beautiful house. I traveled all over the world. Ask me where I have not been. I\nhave satisfied my hunger for classical music. Here and in New York. We went to the opera\nevery year for three, four days. We stayed at the Park Hotel, across from Lincoln Center. I have\nseen Pavarotti and Domingo and everybody. I have been at La Scala in Milan. At the Covent\nGarden, Paris Opera. I have done everything. And you see this. This is my revenge over war,\nNazi, communists and everybody else that against the Jews. If you push and you want, you can\ndo it. And now you can ask me anything else. That\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Do you feel Romanian in any way?",
        "A: Romanian, no. I have never been back since I left. No. My husband took the boys, I would\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nsay about eight years ago. He went to Iasi and to Bivolari. He couldn\u2019t find anything. He didn\u2019t\nsee anybody. He didn\u2019t recognize what\u2019s there.",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t you go back?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go back because why should I go? What did they do to me? Why should I go back? I\ndon\u2019t want to go back. They threw me out. They took years away from my life. They throw you\nhere, they throw you there. They take my father. Don\u2019t let me go to Russia. I am a traitor, I am\nan embarrassment. Why should I go? No, I\u2019m not, I have no ties. We have no family. I do not\nfeel Romanian. I feel more American because I lived here for most of my life. I think in English.\nI don\u2019t even you know we go to, we went to Israel every year because my husband has had a\nbrother and two sisters there. The brother and one of the sisters died. There is still one there.\nWe were there last October to visit. And we were at a wedding. There are, when the family,\nimmediate family get together, all the siblings and all the from Chaim\u2019s brothers and sisters,\nthere are 65 people.\nMy son, older son who lives in Wilmington was there last September or something like this.\nAnd there were so many people. They couldn\u2019t have met in a house. So they rented a, in a park\nthere is some kind of you know there is a grill and tables. They rent it and they came from all\nover, from Bersheva, from Rishon, from Tel Aviv, from Ramla, from and those are cousins, all\ncousins with their children and it\u2019s just a pleasure. And we were there. There were hundreds of\npeople at the wedding. And all immediate family. I felt like a coward leaving Israel. I still do.\nThey put me through medical school I didn\u2019t pay any tuition. Yes, I did work there, paid my\ndues. I even worked in Safed where nobody wanted to go. That was, yes they paid me more\ncause I needed money but very few people would have done what I did. To go and work on a\nborder. And I had \u2014 my best friends were there. They\u2019re gone most of them. I still have one and\nwe Skype like two, three times a week because it\u2019s just the two of us left.\nWe have here, my husband when he came you know in the 50s, he was in, he\u2019s a graduate of\nMichigan State and he was very specialized in botulism. He\u2019s a microbiologist. So when he came\nhere, he worked. There was a -- he lived in downtown Washington and there was a church that\nbecame a synagogue on Fridays and that\u2019s where he met a lot of friends. They formed a group.\nThey were saying -- it\u2019s when I came 42, 43 years ago almost, they were already a group. So it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nmust be 45, 50 years, there was a group. I don\u2019t think I ever fit in the American friendships or\ngroups or, because I\u2019m different. I\u2019m very different because of my background, because of my \u2014\nI don\u2019t know. I have different tastes, different opinion, different ideas. But we used to meet every\nFriday, not every Friday night, once a month either in one house. But then the kids grew up and\nthere were too many so we used to hire here on University Boulevard, a place to have Purim\nparties and Hanukah parties. All the kids grew up, they\u2019re gone. Many of our group, breast\ncancer, pancreatic cancer and lung cancer. Alzheimer\u2019s so we are unable to have a minyan\nanymore. So we don\u2019t see each other. And when we finally decide, it\u2019s either this one is sick or\nthat one can\u2019t come. We don\u2019t have the group that we had before. Not that it meant a lot to me\nbecause they\u2019re different. My friend, for example, I'll give you an example.\nOne of the group had breast cancer. I didn\u2019t know until she died. And she had a metastasis to\nthe brain and she died. But to me this is not friendship. Tell me and maybe I can help. It\u2019s a\ndifferent approach here. It\u2019s a different, it\u2019s the era of the telephone when you \u2014 I grew up. IfI\nhave a friend, I come to the door and I get in. I open the refrigerator and it\u2019s not like this. It\u2019s\ndifferent. I am different. I\u2019m, different background.\nFor example in my society where I grew up, you can ask somebody how much do you make a\nyear? That would be the greatest faux pas here. It would be different. It\u2019s very different. My\nidea of a friend is very different of what friendship is here. Friendship is here, let\u2019s get together\nand let\u2019s have dinner. No, that\u2019s not for me. To me a friend is somebody that a friend when I\nneed you. Tell me what\u2019s wrong. Maybe I can do something for you, that\u2019s a friend you know. It\nhas to be in good time and in bad time. Here it\u2019s only the good time. I don\u2019t have any good times\nnow with, that Chaim is sick. Yes, they were very attentive. They called, they came, they asked,\nthey inquired, they this, they that. It\u2019s not the same thing for me. What else do you \u2014",

Last\nDecember we were for Hanukkah in Wilmington and in the middle of the night he had 104 fever.\nHe had some type of pneumonia.

He used to go at eight and come at\nfour. Yes, until all this stuff. He worked in the library. And I would have loved to volunteer.

        "Q: Are you more comfortable being among people who did have to go through the war than\nthose of us who never did.",
        "A: Not really, no. It\u2019s being in the wrong place in the wrong time. I mean that\u2019s, I believe it\u2019s\nfaith. I mean it happens. Things happen to people you know. No. It\u2019s just that people have\ndifferent ideas. For example that I see things differently. We have a friend who was born here\nand she is a professor at GW. And so on and so forth. So one day she tells me, Malvy I read a\nbook. You have to read it. You have to read it. This book is called whatever, whatever. Of course\nI go and I get the book. So the book is about a family of very rich Iranian Jews who had a\njewelry store. Their son was here in the States studying in the state and you know they are\nJewish. I forgot to say, what\u2019s more important. They are Jewish. And it started with the shah and\nwith the persecution there and of course, I know cause my son has a very good friend who run\naway from Iran. They went together to the Jewish Day School and he\u2019s a big doctor now. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nthe book is about how they decided to run away because they knew they are not going to survive\ncause they were the shah\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nThey had Picassos and Renoirs in this all, already in Switzerland. They left with a little suitcase\nand one of their employees, they left the store with all the jewelries and everything so it wouldn\u2019t\nshow that they are running away. They had a limo taking them over the border. They went to\nParis and then they came here and so on and so forth. What\u2019s so terrific about \u2014 what\u2019s so\nincredible about that? You know why did you like the book so much? Oh it\u2019s interesting. Not to\nme. I went through hell to get out from Romania. I wish I were rich you know. So she was\nsurprised. I said wait until I write a book. That\u2019s going to be interesting but I may be prejudiced.\nOn the other hand I might be prejudiced because you know we were -- we weren\u2019t poor. We just\nwere you know regular people. You know and we didn\u2019t have the fortunes and the Renoirs to\ntide us over and you know we went with no pennies, no money, no nothing. So maybe, I told\nher, I think my book would be much more interesting to you than this book. That\u2019s how but\npeople who don\u2019t know. And many people I\u2019m telling you if I\u2014 I told you a lot of things, but\nsometimes I just tell little bit of snippets of what happened to me.\nAnd people look at me and they don\u2019t think I tell the truth. You know that\u2019s why I\u2019m not going \u2014\nI mean just like my boys, they say mom you are pulling my leg. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s true.

This is how they and\nwho the mother who was a simple woman. She said why did you go. Don\u2019t go. I\u2019m not letting\nyou to go.

And they, cause it\u2019s a much\nbigger city. They thought they\u2019ll disappear there. But you know immediately after the war, they\nall left. And my husband went on a \u2014 with a youth organization he left. He was with, I don\u2019t\nknow which Hashomer Hatzair or I was with Hashomer. They, he went on a ship and he was\ncaptured by the British cause there was no state Israel yet. And he was detained for a year in\nCyprus. And then during one night, the Hagenah they came and they took, no they came out of\nthe camp and they were hidden in the darkness, in a certain place. And then they came and they\ntook them with a boat and went straight into the military. The Israeli and the, when there was\nIsrael, he was in the Israeli army. And he had a brother in Detroit and came here and wanted to\ngo to medical school. They wouldn\u2019t take foreigners. So he went to college. He taught bar\nmitzvah, he taught Hebrew. He worked in a store. Oh my goodness. And finally he finished\ncollege and he went for his masters and so on and so forth. Everybody has a \u2014 all of us have a\nstory to tell. Mine is not as terrible as others. You know, it\u2019s all relative and it all depends on the\nright time. The bad time to be in a certain place.",
        "Q: Did your experiences, did they make you feel more Jewish? Did it affect your thoughts about\nbeing Jewish?",

        "Q: Also the fact that your father was taken away during the war.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s true but I don\u2019t think that when you are young you think so much about what\u2019s\nhappening around you. There\u2019s so much self-centered to you know the dates didn\u2019t go well. I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\ndon\u2019t know a trivial, trivial thing. We grew up.

        "Q: Such development.",
        "A: Yes, problem. But definitely I lived in Israel. I can tell you I love that country but growing up\nunder communism, and not knowing anything about Judaism. Nothing, absolutely nothing. Yeah\nwe speak Hebrew. That doesn\u2019t mean that I know anything about Judaism. So when I came here\nI felt out of place. Never went to a synagogue in Israel, never, nothing. So when I came here,\nChaim comes from a very, very orthodox background. So he started telling me you have to keep\nkosher. Wow, how is that, you know. Just you cannot, very orthodox because there are so many\northodox synagogues. You are not driving out on Shabbat. I said there is no way. I am a working\nwoman with two children, a husband and two parents. I have to -- Shabbat. He was so \u2014 but so\nit\u2019s, Iam much more Jewish since I came here. At least I go to a synagogue. I go to the Jewish\ncommunity center, much more aware, much more in tune with the world. I guess it\u2019s aging and\nbeing exposed to \u2014 I\u2019m much more Jewish since I came here, definitely. Because you know you\ngrow up. It\u2019s very important how you grow up, where you grow up, and how you grow up.\nThat\u2019s why I sent my kids to a Jewish day school. I wanted them to have what I didn\u2019t have. And\nthey already, they are always laughing cause it was very expensive. He said you could have had\ntwo Cadillacs. I don\u2019t care about the Cadillac. I drive a Honda. I don\u2019t care about, I\u2019m not this\ntype of -- what car do you drive? No. To me, when Chaim \u2014 I remember one year Chaim was\nasking me what do you want for your birthday. I don\u2019t, as you see nothing cause I grew up like\nthis and I -- my profession never. What do you want for your birthday? There 1s a Picasso\nGaugin exhibit in Chicago. That\u2019s what I want. And that\u2019s what I did. What do you want for\nyour birthday?

        "Q: Any message to your grandchildren?",
        "A: I always said be truthful to yourself. Enjoy what you do.

And I said no. I have two children. I want to be home when they come from school. I\nwant them to go to a Jewish school. I want to spend my weekends with them, going down with\nthe mall, in the museum. This 1s how they grew up with museums and with malls and with\ntheater and with concert. This is how they grew up.\nSo I always say, do only if you can. You know you have to have a job but if you can do what you\nlike to do in life. That\u2019s why I have no regrets even though I took very risky, I made risky\ndecisions. Yes, I suffered consequences but that\u2019s how it goes. You know you have to do \u2014- My\ngrandson Jacob is seven and he goes to a school for talented children. And he said, he told me\nSafca, I have to interview you. I don\u2019t know what, where were you born or something? And the\nsame thing at the end was, what\u2019s the advice that you give me? And I said Jacob, what do you\nlike to do. I like math. That\u2019s what you should do. That\u2019s my advice. Do exactly what you like to\ndo. In life. Yes. It\u2019s -- my life was really different from Americans that are born here. For\nexample when I retired, somebody asked me so where are you moving. Why should I move? I\nsaid I want to be where my children are. What kind of concept is this that you would go away\nfrom your children to Florida or to I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t even enter my mind. Everybody\nwaits to retire and go to Florida. It\u2019s not me, that\u2019s not me. I want to be where my kids are. I\nnever understand that. I never understand Americans and how they say when I retire. And I say\nwhen I retire probably I'll be old and sick. That\u2019s today is the day to live and it has to do that\nwe ve been through a war. We could have been dead. We could have been in jail from the\ncommunism. We could have \u2014 who knows. A bomb exploding in Israel, who knows. The time\nto live is now, whenever you are young or not young but healthy, that\u2019s when the time to live 1s.\nAnd I remember when I was maybe ten, 12, I made a list of wishes of things that you would like\nto do in life.

Somebody bought us tickets at the balcony at the\nMetropolitan opera. I remember taking the train, going to New York, seeing the matinee and\ncoming back. And when we, you know when we finally I started working and every year it\u2019s like\nthe pilgrimage to Mecca for me was to go to the Met. That was my list, my list. I mean there are\nthings that make children of my age probably never thought of this, that\u2019s a dream to be in some\nplace. And Las Vegas was on my list. Yes, I went. Didn\u2019t -- yes but I remember Frank Sinatra\nand were at one of the hotels and Alan King and whatever. We do \u2014I did go many times cause I\nlove the Cirque de Soleil so I travel a lot from work and we went to San Diego. Wherever he\ntraveled I traveled with him.

        "A: Iam an only child.",
        "A: I was born in Bacu, Romania which was on the eastern side, actually northeastern side of\nRomania. Both my parents come up from very simple background. I am actually the first person\nwho ever went to, above fourth grade or something. I have never known my grandparents,\nexcept my maternal grandmother. My paternal grandmother was killed during World War I. And\nmy paternal grandparents both died from an epidemic of cholera. So my father and his four\nsiblings were raised by a grandfather. Even a grandmother was not available. She died too from\ncholera. So in this situation my parents didn\u2019t go to school except to learn how to read and write\nand when they were able, I think at age ten or 11, 12 maximum, they had to learn some kind of a\nprofession in order to be able to exist. So my father learned to be a tailor and my mother learned\nto be a seamstress. They were very wonderful people. My mother was full of pep and\noptimistic. My father was very intelligent and he sat with an encyclopedia in every single day\njust to learn and very interested in politics of course.",
        "A: My mother name was Laura and my father\u2019s name was Jacob, just like my grandson. And\nthey, my father was born in Iasi which is a bigger city also in the eastern side, but he found work\nin Bacu. That\u2019s where he met my mother. They got married and \u2014",
        "A: Yes. She was from Bacu. They got married in 1936. And, because they both worked they\nmade money. They moved out from the ghetto cause my mother lived with her mother with my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\ngrandmother in a Jewish enclave, let\u2019s say. Not call a ghetto. So they moved out and they got an\napartment and it even had a bathroom and they did very, very well until the war came.",
        "A: Where they lived. No I don\u2019t remember. I know where it is though cause they showed me\nexactly where it was. They did very well financially, socially, but then the war came and because\nmy father was such an excellent and known in -- The city was about 40,000 people so everybody\nknew that he was the best tailor in town. So of course they -- he was taken away with the\nintention to use him to make suits for the upper echelon of the military. And he was taken away\nto a certain military camp which was far away from us. You needed to go by train at least five,\nsix hours.",
        "A: We\u2019re talking 1941, 42, something like this. 41, I would say. So my mother was the only, left\nto be the only breadwinner. Therefore she had to move out of that apartment and come back and\nlive with my grandmother in that Jewish ghetto. That\u2019s the house that I remember.",
        "A: Leka, strada Leka, famous for dirt and misery. My grandmother\u2019s house was close to a\nriver. It\u2019s called Bistrita and across from the stables where somebody who had a business of,\nkept the horses. This is where the house was. The house you went down into the house, not up\ninto the house. Had two rooms. One room where you cooked, you slept, you sat, you did\neverything and the other room was for guests. I never knew why, why we never used that. There\nwas never any guests but that\u2019s my grandmother. She was beautiful. I remember the melihki [ph]\ndishes on the wall like this, on a little shelf. There was no running water and no bathroom. There\nwas a like an outhouse of some sort. I remember being me being maybe three and a half or four\nand going with a pail. I would say three, four hundred feet where the water spout was. But I\ndidn\u2019t know any better. I was happy that our neighbors loved me or I used to go to a friend that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nhad eight, nine siblings. And play with them and come home full of lice. And, but I was happy.\nMy mother was working every single day. And she \u2014",
        "A: As a seamstress. She went to people\u2019s houses for the day to either make dresses or repairs or\nwhatever. And she made sure that we have -- food was impossible to obtain. There was no food,\nbut she somehow she was able to bring the bread or the cornmeal that was the main sustenance,\nmain meal I would say and I wouldn\u2019t eat it of course. I was a very skinny child. And I\nremember like yesterday. I mean there are some things that\u2019s so imprinted that my mother went\nto work for the day for a lady who had a toy store. So at the end of the day the lady asked what\nwould you like, money or something from the store? So she said I want the nicest doll that you\nhave. So there she comes home with a doll in one hand and with a bag with two eggs. Two eggs\nwas like gold. And she comes to the house and as I told you, you came down in the house, three\nsteps to go in the house. And I saw that doll and I jumped on her. The eggs fell and they broke\nand that\u2019s the first doll that I had that closed and opened the eyes. It was -- I had it for years and\nit was the most fantastic thing. I don\u2019t think I was more than three and a half. Another memory\nin that particular place, except that the smell coming from the stables and I was so afraid of\nhorses. And is that the Germans by the time they got to where \u2014 that\u2019s why we were lucky we\ndidn\u2019t end up in a concentration camp cause it was close to Russia. They have some other\nworries and, but they were bombing. They were bombing and throwing \u2014 where do you go?\nThere was no place to shelter from the bombs. So we used to run into an open space with a\ncrater, previously made by another bomb and that\u2019s where we were lying down and I thought it\nwas the greatest entertainment seeing the planes just going this way and that way and so on and\nso forth.\nWas very traumatic for me is that I grew up without a father. In 1944, when 45, when the war\nwas over my father came home and I couldn\u2019t understand why do we have a strange man living\nin our house. And eventually he went back to work. They moved out \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013",
        "A: What did I do?",
        "A: Yeah, I remember going to some kind of kindergarten or some \u2014 it was school. A Jewish\nschool, of course. The school, my mother always wanted the best for me, like any mother. And\nshe sent me, it was a fortune to send me to that particular school. And it was very far away from\nhome. And there was no way to get there except walking. And the schedule was you go in the\nmorning. You come home for lunch. You go back and forth. If I would tell you, that was at least\na mile and a half or two. But back then you let your child walk. There weren\u2019t too many cars.\nThere were no street signs or lights or anything of that sort. But I hated going there because\nwhat do you teach rich people? You teach them manners, how to eat. You teach them how to\nwaltz and tango and music and things like this. And I didn\u2019t like that at all because I already\nknew how to read and that was \u2014",
        "A: Yes. During the war, before. Before. We were still with my grandmother and I already\nknew letters and I knew I was already four or five years old. And that was I hated every single\nday to go to that particular -- There were only rich kids there, you know.",

Otherwise when you grow up with only with Jewish\npeople, and especially my grandmother was extremely, extremely religious.

I loved to read books and\nbecause I was very skinny my father used to give me, I don\u2019t know five cents if I drank a glass of\nmilk. So I was to take the five cents and go to the bookstore and buy a book. I loved books and I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nloved to go to the movies. And I used to take my grandmother who didn\u2019t understand anything\nthat was, and I had to translate her in Yiddish what\u2019s going on. I loved, I mean from that age I\nloved entertainment.",

The teacher that taught me Hebrew in the Jewish school was\nhired. You had a choice. French was mandatory. Russian was mandatory and you had a choice\nof a third language. So she was made a Yiddish, to teach Yiddish. They didn\u2019t want to\ncompletely abolish I guess, so I signed up for her class. Just because I loved her as a Hebrew\nteacher. I \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013",
        "A: Yes, but not to read or write or not at that \u2014 but I mostly signed up because nobody else\nwanted to be in a Yiddish class and I wanted because of her mostly because of her. Not because I\nneeded it. You know. And then they abolished that too eventually, they did. In Romania, they\nwere only ten. You don\u2019t\u2019 go to 12\u2122 grade but when you reach the tenth grade, you\u2019re done with\nhigh school. I remember an incident. I was very competitive and I always wanted to have straight\nA\u2019s. And I always, I guess when you are not a beautiful girl cause P\u2019ve never been beautiful but\nwhen you have the brains you do want to be good at something. If you\u2019re not very good looking,\nthen you want to be good at something else. And I had a friend who was not Jewish. One of the\nteachers was the wife of a man who was executed for being a criminal, war criminal. She was\nour teacher. I think it was science teacher of some sort. And she gave that non-Jewish girl an A,\nten. They used to go from one to ten. And she gave me a nine. And I went to her and I said I\ndon\u2019t think it\u2019s right because I know as much as she does. I think that the grade, but it\u2019s just\nbeing too competitive. What\u2019s a nine and what\u2019s a ten. You know. I had to be the best. So she\nsaid no. She said no. I said why don\u2019t you check us out? Let\u2019s see who knows more.\nSo she, she put us in front of the class and started asking us from the whole material of the whole\nyear you know. And I knew I\u2019m good at science because this is what I eventually did. You know\nI\u2019m never let her go. And that to me, it was beating anti-Semitism. Cause you have to do\nsomething. Not to keep your mouth shut. I could have, they could have, I don\u2019t know maybe\nthrow me out from the school or something. You don\u2019t just do things like this, yes. So in the end\nI got the ten also. That\u2019s one incident which to me that\u2019s anti-Semitism. You know just to make\nher \u2014 and she was my friend. We remained friends you know. So by \u2014",

He was arrested and\ncondemned to death. They didn\u2019t execute him, but my friend and her mother went to Israel and I\nthink the Catholic Church had some kind of fund to help the Jews. They put up $10,000 and they\nlet her father go. Go to Israel. So things like this. I grew up being afraid of my shadow. I grew\nup looking always to see if \u2014 you couldn\u2019t tell a joke. You were always afraid they can arrest\nyou, persecute you, do whatever they want. We never went to the synagogue cause we were\nafraid. Eventually they forced my father to close his store and go and work for the government.",
        "A: Yes, yes because he was a capitalist. But anyway, I finished high school and I was 16 years\nold. And you know I already spoke perfect Russian, perfect French and I wanted to go to learn\nlanguages. So my mother says but you were so good in science. Go to medical school. And I\nsaid I don\u2019t think so. She said go and try. I said it\u2019s so difficult. It\u2019s so this, it\u2019s so that. And she\nsaid just do what I\u2019m asking you to do. Take the exam. If you get in, fine. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine\nwith me. Go and be, learn languages. So I was 16 years old when I went to Iasi where there is a\nmedical school.

Mostly Romanian or we had a mixture. We\nhad from Yemen and from you know this is \u2014",
        "A: Very big. Very, very big yes. Like right now the Russians, the Romanians were a huge\ngroup. But not just, we spoke Hebrew all the time, not Romanian. And they all got married.

But as you\nget older, being single is not, at least for me it wasn\u2019t as interesting as I thought it was going to\nbe. And I had some boyfriends, also colleagues. But nothing serious, nothing that \u2014 and one day\na friend of mine, very good friend from Safed, she is calling me. She said come to the wedding\nof such and such. And I said no I\u2019m on \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I have on overnight. I\u2019m in the emergency room.\nI\u2019m not coming. She said come. And I was invited from the groom\u2019s side. Chaim came to a\nwedding of his niece, one of the nieces. Chaim had had two brothers and two sisters and Chaim\nleft Israel in 1949 or 1950, came to America and that\u2019s when that little girl was born, his niece\nwas born. And this sister was crying. She said who knows when we\u2019re going to see you. Back\nthen it was you know in the 50s, to fly to America was no -- serious you know. So he was joking\nand says I'll come to her wedding. I\u2019ll \u2014 that\u2019s for sure. Of course he came many, many times.\nAnd there he was. I mean bashert. There is nothing like bashert.",

I\u2019m sure they did set it\nup. But they knew me and him and I didn\u2019t. So it was not fair actually. And we had the greatest\ntime. He, I love to dance and I like music and I\u2019m full of pep and so was he. Not as much. He is\nmuch more mellow maybe. Over the years he mellowed. I mellowed too but not as much. I\nmean we just clicked. And we spent a few times, days together. And then he said I was, it was\nsummer I think, yes, summer. June maybe.",
        "A: 1971. And I said I\u2019m getting ready to go to Europe because I wanted to go on vacation. And\nhe said why don\u2019t you come to the States so we\u2019ll get \u2014 I wasn\u2019t sure. Sure and then I said hey\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nwhy not. I\u2019m a modern woman. I, you know. And my parents said you must be crazy. You don\u2019t\nknow him. I know I met the family. I mean those like regular nice people. I, let me see. And sure\nenough I came to the States. What a great time. We went to New York for several days. To the\nStatue of Liberty and did this and did that. We went to visit his uncle in Rochester. And then we\nwent to a bar mitzvah in Detroit where he had a brother and one of the sons. We went to the bar\nmitzvah. Good time. And I left. He started bugging me. We should get married and we should\nget married, we should \u2014 I guess at this age if you\u2019ve known a person and you click you have to\ntake a chance. We got married in October of 1971, in Israel of course we got married. And I\ncame here and I knew it was going to be tough for a physician that comes from overseas. And I\nbrought my parents cause I\u2019m an only child and I didn\u2019t want to leave them there. And we were\nstill living in a small apartment that we \u2014 our first son who was born in 1973 was ten months old,\nsomething like this. We all lived in a one bedroom, huge beautiful apartment in Washington, DC,\nFourth street cause Chaim worked at the Food and Drug Administration. He used to walk there.\nAnd there I have a baby, didn\u2019t \u2014 my English was not so good. I was, it\u2019s medical English that I\nknew. I didn\u2019t know conversational English. And I watched a lot of tv. I didn\u2019t understand. And\nthen I went and I took a course at Georgetown, intensive course every day, every day, every day\nfor a month and a half. This is all my education in English.\nAnd then my parents came and we moved into a tiny house not far from here. It was Lockridge,\nit\u2019s off University. And Chaim was the only one working. We had another baby and I said time\nfor me. I have my parents. Time for me to return to my profession somehow. And I had the\ninitial exam that I took that allows you to work under supervision, meaning to be again an intern\nand again a resident and so on and so forth.\nAnd I went to the University of Maryland, department of preventive medicine and I interviewed\nfor a residency or an internship first. And they got me in that because I have two small children\nand I said I cannot spend my days running up and down hospital corridors. I was already 38.\nJust 39. [had a baby at 39. And I said I have to do something else. So I, what I start, I had my\nmother to help me so I did an internship at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, preventive\nmedicine. I did a residency there. The residency included a paid master in public health from\nJohns Hopkins which I adored every minute. To do that. And, but it wasn\u2019t easy. You know you\nhave two children. You have a husband, you have a house. It\u2019s not easy. I stayed with\nUniversity of Maryland about four and a half years. When I decided that this is not for me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nAcademia 1s not for people that are open and frank and tell the truth like me. This is for people\nthat know how to \u2014 not, it\u2019s just not for me. I\u2019m not this type of person. I come from a different\nbackground in which speaking up or telling the truth is the norm, not. And I told Chaim, even if\nit means never to work again, I can\u2019t do this type of work. Also, I was the lowest on the totem\npole there and every project that nobody else wanted and I am the top w --. So I quit.\nThree months later, it was in 1984 I got a job with the Department of Veterans Affairs. I worked\nuntil 2010 and I did a mitzvah on a daily basis. I either helped the veteran or widow or a prisoner\nof war. I did something good. And there I am. I\u2019m 76 and looking back, would I change things?\nProbably not. It\u2019s not easy to live on three continents like I did. And you know people said how\nmany languages do you speak? I say this and this and this and that. Oh how exciting. Not to me.\nI was forced into that. It\u2019s forced for Russian, forced for French. There Iam. I come here. I\nhave to go to Johns Hopkins and write papers and do presentations. And then at the Department\nof Veterans Affairs, we have to, we had seminars and we had lectures there. Sometimes I didn\u2019t\nmind which is not for this. But if you make it clear and concise and have a good slides it goes.\nYou know you can do it.\nAnd I remember being interviewed for the Shoah project and at the end they asked me so give us\na final like a summary of \u2014 and I\u2019Il tell you exactly what I said because this 1s my summary if\nyou want to ask me something else, Pll be happy to answer it. Look at me. I have two\nwonderful boys. Mention one has a PhD. The other one went to college and is a producer for a\nshow. I have a beautiful house. I traveled all over the world. Ask me where I have not been. I\nhave satisfied my hunger for classical music. Here and in New York. We went to the opera\nevery year for three, four days. We stayed at the Park Hotel, across from Lincoln Center. I have\nseen Pavarotti and Domingo and everybody. I have been at La Scala in Milan. At the Covent\nGarden, Paris Opera. I have done everything. And you see this. This is my revenge over war,\nNazi, communists and everybody else that against the Jews. If you push and you want, you can\ndo it. And now you can ask me anything else. That\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Romanian, no. I have never been back since I left. No. My husband took the boys, I would\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nsay about eight years ago. He went to Iasi and to Bivolari. He couldn\u2019t find anything. He didn\u2019t\nsee anybody. He didn\u2019t recognize what\u2019s there.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go back because why should I go? What did they do to me? Why should I go back? I\ndon\u2019t want to go back. They threw me out. They took years away from my life. They throw you\nhere, they throw you there. They take my father. Don\u2019t let me go to Russia. I am a traitor, I am\nan embarrassment. Why should I go? No, I\u2019m not, I have no ties. We have no family. I do not\nfeel Romanian. I feel more American because I lived here for most of my life. I think in English.\nI don\u2019t even you know we go to, we went to Israel every year because my husband has had a\nbrother and two sisters there. The brother and one of the sisters died. There is still one there.\nWe were there last October to visit. And we were at a wedding. There are, when the family,\nimmediate family get together, all the siblings and all the from Chaim\u2019s brothers and sisters,\nthere are 65 people.\nMy son, older son who lives in Wilmington was there last September or something like this.\nAnd there were so many people. They couldn\u2019t have met in a house. So they rented a, in a park\nthere is some kind of you know there is a grill and tables. They rent it and they came from all\nover, from Bersheva, from Rishon, from Tel Aviv, from Ramla, from and those are cousins, all\ncousins with their children and it\u2019s just a pleasure. And we were there. There were hundreds of\npeople at the wedding. And all immediate family. I felt like a coward leaving Israel. I still do.\nThey put me through medical school I didn\u2019t pay any tuition. Yes, I did work there, paid my\ndues. I even worked in Safed where nobody wanted to go. That was, yes they paid me more\ncause I needed money but very few people would have done what I did. To go and work on a\nborder. And I had \u2014 my best friends were there. They\u2019re gone most of them. I still have one and\nwe Skype like two, three times a week because it\u2019s just the two of us left.\nWe have here, my husband when he came you know in the 50s, he was in, he\u2019s a graduate of\nMichigan State and he was very specialized in botulism. He\u2019s a microbiologist. So when he came\nhere, he worked. There was a -- he lived in downtown Washington and there was a church that\nbecame a synagogue on Fridays and that\u2019s where he met a lot of friends. They formed a group.\nThey were saying -- it\u2019s when I came 42, 43 years ago almost, they were already a group. So it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nmust be 45, 50 years, there was a group. I don\u2019t think I ever fit in the American friendships or\ngroups or, because I\u2019m different. I\u2019m very different because of my background, because of my \u2014\nI don\u2019t know. I have different tastes, different opinion, different ideas. But we used to meet every\nFriday, not every Friday night, once a month either in one house. But then the kids grew up and\nthere were too many so we used to hire here on University Boulevard, a place to have Purim\nparties and Hanukah parties. All the kids grew up, they\u2019re gone. Many of our group, breast\ncancer, pancreatic cancer and lung cancer. Alzheimer\u2019s so we are unable to have a minyan\nanymore. So we don\u2019t see each other. And when we finally decide, it\u2019s either this one is sick or\nthat one can\u2019t come. We don\u2019t have the group that we had before. Not that it meant a lot to me\nbecause they\u2019re different. My friend, for example, I'll give you an example.\nOne of the group had breast cancer. I didn\u2019t know until she died. And she had a metastasis to\nthe brain and she died. But to me this is not friendship. Tell me and maybe I can help. It\u2019s a\ndifferent approach here. It\u2019s a different, it\u2019s the era of the telephone when you \u2014 I grew up. IfI\nhave a friend, I come to the door and I get in. I open the refrigerator and it\u2019s not like this. It\u2019s\ndifferent. I am different. I\u2019m, different background.\nFor example in my society where I grew up, you can ask somebody how much do you make a\nyear? That would be the greatest faux pas here. It would be different. It\u2019s very different. My\nidea of a friend is very different of what friendship is here. Friendship is here, let\u2019s get together\nand let\u2019s have dinner. No, that\u2019s not for me. To me a friend is somebody that a friend when I\nneed you. Tell me what\u2019s wrong. Maybe I can do something for you, that\u2019s a friend you know. It\nhas to be in good time and in bad time. Here it\u2019s only the good time. I don\u2019t have any good times\nnow with, that Chaim is sick. Yes, they were very attentive. They called, they came, they asked,\nthey inquired, they this, they that. It\u2019s not the same thing for me. What else do you \u2014",

You know I don\u2019t want to go out to dinner or another, I don\u2019t wear them. So\nthat\u2019s what I want for my birthday.",
        "A: I always said be truthful to yourself. Enjoy what you do. Don\u2019t look for money only in life\nbecause I could have when I came here I could have gone into a practice and make half a million\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\na year. And I said no. I have two children. I want to be home when they come from school. I\nwant them to go to a Jewish school. I want to spend my weekends with them, going down with\nthe mall, in the museum. This 1s how they grew up with museums and with malls and with\ntheater and with concert. This is how they grew up.\nSo I always say, do only if you can. You know you have to have a job but if you can do what you\nlike to do in life. That\u2019s why I have no regrets even though I took very risky, I made risky\ndecisions. Yes, I suffered consequences but that\u2019s how it goes. You know you have to do \u2014- My\ngrandson Jacob is seven and he goes to a school for talented children. And he said, he told me\nSafca, I have to interview you. I don\u2019t know what, where were you born or something? And the\nsame thing at the end was, what\u2019s the advice that you give me? And I said Jacob, what do you\nlike to do. I like math. That\u2019s what you should do. That\u2019s my advice. Do exactly what you like to\ndo. In life. Yes. It\u2019s -- my life was really different from Americans that are born here. For\nexample when I retired, somebody asked me so where are you moving. Why should I move? I\nsaid I want to be where my children are. What kind of concept is this that you would go away\nfrom your children to Florida or to I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t even enter my mind. Everybody\nwaits to retire and go to Florida. It\u2019s not me, that\u2019s not me. I want to be where my kids are. I\nnever understand that. I never understand Americans and how they say when I retire. And I say\nwhen I retire probably I'll be old and sick. That\u2019s today is the day to live and it has to do that\nwe ve been through a war. We could have been dead. We could have been in jail from the\ncommunism. We could have \u2014 who knows. A bomb exploding in Israel, who knows. The time\nto live is now, whenever you are young or not young but healthy, that\u2019s when the time to live 1s.\nAnd I remember when I was maybe ten, 12, I made a list of wishes of things that you would like\nto do in life. And the radio was big deal in \u2014 I don\u2019t think, only after World War II we had the\nradio there. And I remember my parents listening to the -- we receive at Waldorf Astoria. What\nwas the name of the --",
        "A: Guy Lombardo. And I listened, I liked the music and I said one day I am going to go for New\nYear\u2019s Eve to Waldorf Astoria and we did it in 1992. We did. It was \u2014 people that grow up like\nme where you have nothing. All you have is a dream. I don\u2019t know. Where, Metropolitan opera.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 2, 2013\nThat was also cause my parents used to listen, on my list. The first time I came to the States after\nwe got married, I told Chaim, I have to go to the Metropolitan opera. Of course only he was\nworking. We didn\u2019t have a lot of money. Somebody bought us tickets at the balcony at the\nMetropolitan opera. I remember taking the train, going to New York, seeing the matinee and\ncoming back. And when we, you know when we finally I started working and every year it\u2019s like\nthe pilgrimage to Mecca for me was to go to the Met. That was my list, my list. I mean there are\nthings that make children of my age probably never thought of this, that\u2019s a dream to be in some\nplace. And Las Vegas was on my list. Yes, I went. Didn\u2019t -- yes but I remember Frank Sinatra\nand were at one of the hotels and Alan King and whatever. We do \u2014I did go many times cause I\nlove the Cirque de Soleil so I travel a lot from work and we went to San Diego. Wherever he\ntraveled I traveled with him. Wherever I went for work, we used to stop. I went a lot to San\nDiego or Reno and so when I was on the west coast we used to stop and see Cirque de Soleil.\nWhen they didn\u2019t come around like they come now. Alaska, Hawaii. Everywhere. You know\njust did it right on time because now travel will be not anymore.",
