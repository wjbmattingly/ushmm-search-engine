        "A: Well, these meetings were primarily \u2014 my understanding about this was that these\npeople, there were originally I think 10 or 11 or something, they decided to buy a boat\nfrom a Greek person who built this boat as a sailboat for races \u2014 racing. This was a racing\nsailboat. And I think he was in importing and export of grain, th-the Greek guy. And they\ndecided, th-that they are going to \u2014 to buy it, and so they were organizing the \u2014 they were\ntalking, where are we going to get the maps, the boat head, a small engine. One of the\nguys was supposed to be a knowledge of mechanic, and he was supposed to take care of\nthe engine. And then where are we go \u2014 th-the \u2014 what kind of luggage we can take, you\nknow, we\u2019re not supposed to take luggage because there was no place, just socks, you\nsee. And then there was a lot of talk about, if we leave in the winter or spring, the rail \u2014\nyou see, this boat \u2014 and this is why we had trouble with, had a big mast with sails. And to\nkeep the mast up you have to have a keel under \u2014 under the boat. And the question was,\nhow are you going to use the sail if in the winter when the rail where the sail goes up and\ndown like a zipper is going to freeze, you see? So they were talking about all these\nthings, you see?\nAugust 24, 2010",

        "A: I \u2014 there \u2014 there \u2014 as I say, there was one guy, a mechanic, and there was another guy,\nI think, who had some experiences with \u2014 with boats. No, they made a decision right\naway that they are going to take captain and the sailor that na \u2014 as navigators and that\u2019s\nwhat they did.",

I-In Romania that time, if you were a Jew, and\nyou needed some papers, you had to pay money to some intermediary and he will give\nyou the paper, or he will give you a passport [indecipherable]. He had connections, see?\nAnd \u2014 and he continuously was \u2014 for instance, to give you another example: the Jews\nAugust 24, 2010\nwere supposed to give money to the government, you know, some kind of a like a special\nincome or something like this, income tax or something like this. My father didn\u2019t want\nto go and argue with them, and I went with \u2014 with my mother in front of this \u2014 and this\nwas Jewish people who were trying to get money from the Jews. Also, there was a\nquestion at that time about moving Jews to Transnistria. You know about Transnistria?",
        "Q: Ta-Talk about it a little bit.",
        "A: What? Transnistria \u2014 where the Germans were in \u2014 1n Europe, you know, they\ncontrolled Europe, at one time in th \u2014 this was also the Romanian government, there was\nan area over the Dniester, you know, which is \u2014 actually, there is a small republic there\ncalled Moldavia during the \u2014 during the Russians \u2014 1-in the Russia before, and they\nwanted to move the Jews there in Transnistria, the rumors were that also.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 were occupied by the Germans, they were Greek islands, you know? And I think\nthat one of the thing that he was supposed to do, because of the keel, was to throw in a\ngadget that it\u2019s like a string with a weight, by which, before the boat goes in the harbor,\nhe finds out the depths of the water. And we d \u2014 he wasn\u2019t there to do that any more. I\nthink that\u2019s what he was doing \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 before. And the captain should have asked one of the guys to do that, you see. And\nwhat happened is that the keel, which was about three or \u2014 feet or four feet deep, went\nbetween rocks in the por \u2014 Cesme, and then the boat started shaking like this, and\neverybody got scared and we left the boat and we went on the Turkish coast. And then we\nstayed there for, oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe 10 hours or something like this. And then there\nwas a Turkish boat that rescue it. I mean, they were \u2014 they had some long sticks and\npushing the sticks to the bottom and at the same time the boat, pulling it, you know? So\nthey got it out from the ro \u2014 between the rocks and inflated it, and put it back on the\nwater, you know [indecipherable] water. Then we went back on the boat.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "Q: So how did you get off the boat? The dinghy wasn\u2019t there any more. Was there\nanother one?",
        "A: I think that the Turks \u2014 the Turks had \u2014 had a dinghy. Some people from the harbor\ncame in with a dinghy.",

You see, the \u2014 the people from \u2014 one of the people from teaching\nneuro-anatomy in \u2014 1n Beirut, which I think he was from John Hopkins, I did some\ntranslations for him from Italian to English. Some research \u2014 he was interested in the\npituitary gland, and I did some resear \u2014 some translations for him, and I think maybe \u2014\nmaybe he was the guy who wrote the letters, I don\u2019t know who wrote the letters. But the\nway this happen is that one of the John Hopkins professor, by the name of Maxwell\nWinthrop \u2014 he was a hematologist, you know, at John Hopkins, became chairman of\nthe department of medicine in Utah. Now why \u2014 how that happened was that Utah\nbefore the war had a two year medical school. And then after two years, they had to go\nusually to Chicago to finish medical school. Now, because of the war, they decided to\nmake a four year medical school, and then they had to get chairmen \u2014 you know,\nprofessors. And they got this, the Maxwell Winthrop from John Hopkins as a professor\nof medicine. And I think that he was Jewish, and I think that they approach him, and\nMaxwell Winthrop had relation with the Jewish community in \u2014 in Salt Lake City, and\nAugust 24, 2010\nthe Jewish community there had a fund that was left by somebody from Colorado, a\nJewish businessman or something, for scholarships or something like this, and they\ndecided to give me a scholarship. And this 1s the way this [indecipherable]. But that\u2019s\nnot only what happened. It\u2019s \u2014 to come as a student in those days to this country, not only\nthat you had to have some kind of a scholarship, but there had to be a guarantee from\nsomebody, that if you run out of money, they will contribute for your expenses in school\nand so on, so that you don\u2019t remain penniless. And they c \u2014 this was done by a family of\neye doctors in \u2014 in Baltimore. They did the guarantee, but they didn\u2019t give me any\nmoney or something. The money was from that scholarship from the Jewish community\nin \u2014 in Salt Lake City. And I paid it back when I \u2014 after \u2014 later on.",
        "Q: Had you wanted to come to the United States?",
        "A: Yes, I wanted to come to finish medical school. You see, this is something \u2014 it\u2019s\nsomething that \u2014 once you start something, you have to finish it, and I \u2014 I \u2014I started this\nand I had to finish medical school, you see, so it was very important for me to finish\nmedical school.",
        "Q: But you \u2014 if they hadn\u2019t said that you \u2014 they couldn\u2019t guarantee your safety and you\nhad to leave Beirut, you would have stayed there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Probably, and perhaps made a life there.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: I was never interested in Middle East culture. You see, this goes back to the\nbackground in high school. As I told you, there was a very strong French influence, and\nwestern \u2014 western interest [indecipherable]. I probably would have taken the medical\ndegree there and gone somewhere in France, or somewhere else.",
        "Q: I see, right. But you \u2014",
        "A: See, na \u2014 tha \u2014 that Middle East culture never attracted me.",

        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did that \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. You know, it\u2019s very funny, but when I left Paris, you see, because I went first\nto Paris, my friends there, Romanian friends said, how in the hell are you leaving Paris,\nwhich is a metropolis of the world, that you go out in the western United States where\nthere is nothing there?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But the situation in Paris there was not good. After the war, in 1948, the situation in\nFrance was bad. First of all, there were not \u2014 not much food, not \u2014 they were depleted.\nAnd their feeling, a lot of European refugees, including Romanian refugees, they all bring\nAugust 24, 2010\nthat is going to be another war between the United States and Russia, you see? It wasn\u2019t\na very good situation to stay there and study.",
        "Q: So you went from Beirut to Paris in 1948.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: As a\u2014as a way to go to Utah? I mean, that was \u2014",
        "A: No-",

        "Q: I see, I see \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I didn\u2019t know about tt.",
        "Q: \u2014 you didn\u2019t know. So you went to Paris to wait to see what was going to happen.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And how long were you in Utah?",
        "A: I was in Utah from 1948 to 1950, two years.",
        "Q: Two years. And you \u2014 and you met your wife there, 1s that correct?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: That\u2019s another story. Where I was in \u2014 when I was a student in Utah, they have an\nintern there, an American guy from Montana or from some other western states, and we\ngot \u2014 we got friendly. And he went in psychiatry, and came to New York, the New York\nhospital, Cornell Medical School, you know, to study psychiatry. So when I was in\nSaint Louis, an intern, and I came to New York, I came to visit him. And who was there\nas a resident in psychiatry was my wife.",
        "Q: I see. So that\u2019s when you met. And did \u2014 did \u2014 did you get engaged and married very\nquickly, or what?",
        "A: Oh, no.",

        "A: I came to New York.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: Now \u2014 now why did I come to New York? The reason was, while I was in Saint\nLouis, I had a problem with immigration. I had a problem with immigration before \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 because I was a medical student, have [indecipherable] a student visa, you know\nhere, and they were very tough then.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I was advised by people in Saint Louis that came from New York that I should\ngo to New York because in New York they are me \u2014 there is more help with\nimmigration, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 there are people that can help you, so \u2014 and I was trying to get a job in New York.\nSo I came in New York and I went to Cornell Medical School to see this friend of mine,\nand there was this girl, you see, my wife.",
        "Q: So you met in New York?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you were in New York for how long? For a few years?",
        "A: I was in New York for 15 years.",
        "Q: 15 years, uh-huh. Where did you live in New York?\nAugust 24, 2010",

        "Q: Right. So when did you go to Houston? After New York?",
        "A: Then the things change in the profession you see, in New York. And it became the \u2014\nthe individual practice of medicine like we used to do became group practice. And I\ndecided that I\u2019m going to go to Houston to take a post-graduate training in heart surgery,\nyou see, because thoracic surgery have changed from the lung, to heart surgery. And so I\ntook this job in Houston for two years, a fellowship in the Texas Heart Institute. And\nmy wife, again, the practice \u2014 she was in practice of psychiatry, became to such an extent\nthat she didn\u2019t want to join a group, or something like this. And she decided to get the\ntraining in psychiatric administration. So she took a two year, went back to school, to a\nMaster degree in public health, with emphasis on administration.

        "A: First of all affected us, I think, that we went in medicine, you know? I think my wife\nthe same way, you see that we went in medicine, it affected us in that way. And also, the\nAugust 24, 2010\nfact that you had to do a lot of [indecipherable] changing and shifts, gears, so to speak,\nyou know? There was a lot of that during the war, and you had to be very persistent to \u2014\nto be ab \u2014 to \u2014 to get out of school with a degree, you know? And a lot of people advise\nme, why do you have to go up to medical school for so many years? Why don\u2019t you\nbecome a \u2014 a bacteriologist or a physiologist, or something and so on and so forth, you\nsee? You had to be very persistent to get through medical school, and that took a lot of\nenergy, no question about.",
        "Q: Was it awful for you to be so alone? Or did you just make friends and \u2014 and\naccommodate them that way?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, maybe \u2014 I had friends, and I had a very good relation \u2014 see, I been\nmarried for 52 years, and I had a very good relation with my wife. And being both\ndoctors [indecipherable] understand the profession and so on. And that, they are very\nhelpful, of course.",
        "Q: But before that, it had to be very difficult for you, to leave as such a young person.",
        "A: Well, again \u2014 again, it was just very persistent to get through medicine and specialties\nand [indecipherable] examination, and so on. There are a lot of exams in medicine,\ncontinuously you know, and traveling to \u2014 to get the knowhow, you know.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think that maybe the idea was that seeing \u2014 you know, there was\nanother thing also that was when I was the \u2014 as I say, when I went the \u2014 to Paris, you\nknow, waiting to come to this country, there were a lot of refugee camps in Europe, you\nknow. And a friend of mine, a dentist who was \u2014 his family was in Palestine was going\naround these camps trying to convince Jewish people in the camps to come to Marseilles,\nso that they can emigrate to \u2014 to Israel, because by that time, the state was there.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And there \u2014 I don\u2019t know, there are a lot of bad situations around and I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe I had the feeling that being a doctor you can help some people, or you can help to\nchange some of the situation.",

        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But the one thing which \u2014 which remains, and this has been said before by other\npeople, now that this Nazi Germany produced a tremendous amount of shifting of people\nand population all around Europe, a tremendous amount of damage, you know.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t.",
        "A: You see, this is th \u2014 is another thing that, probably now that you ask those question, I\nthink that one of the reason I was persistent to get a medical degree in th \u2014 work as a\ndoctor, was to give some stability, internal stability that you were somebody that has a\npurpose, and so on, instead of floating. Now, there were a lot of young men floating\nAugust 24, 2010\naround Paris and floating around Israel in those days, you see? And being a doctor and\nhaving a definite profession, it gives you ce \u2014 a certain amount of inner stability, I think.",
        "Q: And this was clearly a big concern for you, that you have something that was yours.",
        "A: And something that this was, and something that you can concentrate on, and get\nsome results.",

        "A: \u2014 were occupied by the Germans, they were Greek islands, you know?

And\nwhat happened is that the keel, which was about three or \u2014 feet or four feet deep, went\nbetween rocks in the por \u2014 Cesme, and then the boat started shaking like this, and\neverybody got scared and we left the boat and we went on the Turkish coast. And then we\nstayed there for, oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe 10 hours or something like this. And then there\nwas a Turkish boat that rescue it. I mean, they were \u2014 they had some long sticks and\npushing the sticks to the bottom and at the same time the boat, pulling it, you know? So\nthey got it out from the ro \u2014 between the rocks and inflated it, and put it back on the\nwater, you know [indecipherable] water. Then we went back on the boat.\nAugust 24, 2010",

        "A: In January 19 \u2014 sometimes in January 1948, the president of the university called the\nJewish students in his office. There were seven Jewish students, and told them that he\ncannot guarantee their safety in the school, and that we should leave. Now, he gave us a\npiece of paper, which is in the file of the museum, you know, where he said that the\n[indecipherable] government requested the school to get rid of the foreign Jewish\nstudents. Not the Jewish students from Arab countries, but s \u2014 the foreign Jewish\nstudents. And \u2014 but he told us about the safety. Now, what happened was that when this\nhappened, most of the Jews that we had in school came from Palestine, and so they went\nback to Palestine.",
        "A: Pll tell you about that. The \u2014 I had, of course, problem with money [indecipherable].\nAnd they couldn\u2019t help me from \u2014 my family couldn\u2019t help me. My father wanted me to\ngo back to Romania: he \u2014 he wrote me a letter. And I didn\u2019t want to go back in\nRomania.",
        "A: My mother was saying always, live your own life, you know. Do whatever you \u2014\ndon\u2019t worry about us, and so on and so forth, you see? But when this thing happened with\nthe meeting with the president of the American University of Beirut. Now, you have to\nAugust 24, 2010\nknow something about this also. This originally was a Presbyterian Missionary school,\nand then later on they made it an international college. And the teachers, they were\nAmericans that came [indecipherable] to Presbyterian institutions from Columbia\nUniversity and from John Hopkins, you see? And they were very sympathetic to my\nproblem. And they wrote letters to John Hopkins, and to people from John Hopkins,\nand that\u2019s the way I got admitted to University of Utah.\nEnd of Tape Three\nAugust 24, 2010\nBeginning Tape Four",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Both.",
        "A: I did translator and speaker.",
        "A: Well, this I did it only in the evenings, about three times a week. Let me tell you the\nbackground of that. In Beirut there was a commercial attach\u00e9. I think his name was\nBerkovitz(ph), or something like this. And when the war started, he started this program\non Radio [indecipherable] which is the radio in Beirut. And you see, at that time, beru \u2014\nLebanon was a French protectorate. And when the \u2014 after the [indecipherable]\nAugust 24, 2010\ncollapsed, these people in \u2014 in French colonies, the protectorates, bec \u2014 affidavit to de\nGaulle, so it became France Libre. And Dr. Berkovitz(ph), who was [indecipherable]\nembassy was running a program in Romania from the Radio [indecipherable]. And he\nhad another gentlemen then that I don\u2019t know what happened, he got sick or something,\nand then he asked me to do this three times a week, or something like this. So I used to go\nthere and get the news, translate them, and deliver it.",
        "A: Oh-",
        "A: We - we had \u2014 I mean, in \u2014 as far as telegrams that came into the radio station, is that\nwhat you \u2014",
        "A: Well, I had this job, right.",
        "A: Yeah.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know exactly what \u2014 Romania and I didn\u2019t have \u2014 there were \u2014 there\nwere once \u2014 there were not many Romanians \u2014 the Berkovitz(ph) family was \u2014 there was\nthe doctor, the wife. He was a doctor in business or something, you know, he wasn\u2019t a\nmedical doctor. And he \u2014 and there was a son there who was a student in medicine at the\nFrench school. See, in Beirut there was a Jesuit French university also, and they had a\nmedical school. So this guy, his name was Zaporta(ph), he went to that school. So I\nknew him, I \u2014I\u2014 we\u2019re kind of friendly. But there were not that many Romanians there.",
        "A: No. After.",
        "A: Yes, to some extent. I \u2014 I never liked that culture. I didn\u2019t take German in high school,\nand I didn\u2019t like Germans, I never buy a German car or \u2014 ye\u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I\u2014I\u2014I was\ninfluenced by these things, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Tell you the relation. You see, the \u2014 the people from \u2014 one of the people from teaching\nneuro-anatomy in \u2014 1n Beirut, which I think he was from John Hopkins, I did some\ntranslations for him from Italian to English. Some research \u2014 he was interested in the\npituitary gland, and I did some resear \u2014 some translations for him, and I think maybe \u2014\nmaybe he was the guy who wrote the letters, I don\u2019t know who wrote the letters. But the\nway this happen is that one of the John Hopkins professor, by the name of Maxwell\nWinthrop \u2014 he was a hematologist, you know, at John Hopkins, became chairman of\nthe department of medicine in Utah. Now why \u2014 how that happened was that Utah\nbefore the war had a two year medical school. And then after two years, they had to go\nusually to Chicago to finish medical school. Now, because of the war, they decided to\nmake a four year medical school, and then they had to get chairmen \u2014 you know,\nprofessors. And they got this, the Maxwell Winthrop from John Hopkins as a professor\nof medicine. And I think that he was Jewish, and I think that they approach him, and\nMaxwell Winthrop had relation with the Jewish community in \u2014 in Salt Lake City, and\nAugust 24, 2010\nthe Jewish community there had a fund that was left by somebody from Colorado, a\nJewish businessman or something, for scholarships or something like this, and they\ndecided to give me a scholarship. And this 1s the way this [indecipherable]. But that\u2019s\nnot only what happened. It\u2019s \u2014 to come as a student in those days to this country, not only\nthat you had to have some kind of a scholarship, but there had to be a guarantee from\nsomebody, that if you run out of money, they will contribute for your expenses in school\nand so on, so that you don\u2019t remain penniless. And they c \u2014 this was done by a family of\neye doctors in \u2014 in Baltimore. They did the guarantee, but they didn\u2019t give me any\nmoney or something. The money was from that scholarship from the Jewish community\nin \u2014 in Salt Lake City. And I paid it back when I \u2014 after \u2014 later on.",
        "A: Yes, I wanted to come to finish medical school. You see, this is something \u2014 it\u2019s\nsomething that \u2014 once you start something, you have to finish it, and I \u2014 I \u2014I started this\nand I had to finish medical school, you see, so it was very important for me to finish\nmedical school.",
        "A: Yeah.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: I was never interested in Middle East culture. You see, this goes back to the\nbackground in high school. As I told you, there was a very strong French influence, and\nwestern \u2014 western interest [indecipherable]. I probably would have taken the medical\ndegree there and gone somewhere in France, or somewhere else.",
        "A: See, na \u2014 tha \u2014 that Middle East culture never attracted me.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yeah. You know, it\u2019s very funny, but when I left Paris, you see, because I went first\nto Paris, my friends there, Romanian friends said, how in the hell are you leaving Paris,\nwhich is a metropolis of the world, that you go out in the western United States where\nthere is nothing there?",
        "A: But the situation in Paris there was not good. After the war, in 1948, the situation in\nFrance was bad. First of all, there were not \u2014 not much food, not \u2014 they were depleted.\nAnd their feeling, a lot of European refugees, including Romanian refugees, they all bring\nAugust 24, 2010\nthat is going to be another war between the United States and Russia, you see? It wasn\u2019t\na very good situation to stay there and study.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No-",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I\u2014 I-\u2014I wasn\u2019t sure whether I am going to go to school \u2014",

        "A: \u2014I didn\u2019t know about tt.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was in Utah from 1948 to 1950, two years.",
        "A: No.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: That\u2019s another story. Where I was in \u2014 when I was a student in Utah, they have an\nintern there, an American guy from Montana or from some other western states, and we\ngot \u2014 we got friendly. And he went in psychiatry, and came to New York, the New York\nhospital, Cornell Medical School, you know, to study psychiatry. So when I was in\nSaint Louis, an intern, and I came to New York, I came to visit him. And who was there\nas a resident in psychiatry was my wife.",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "A: About a year or more, you know.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: You see, I left Saint Louis.",
        "A: I came to New York.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: Now \u2014 now why did I come to New York? The reason was, while I was in Saint\nLouis, I had a problem with immigration. I had a problem with immigration before \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because I was a medical student, have [indecipherable] a student visa, you know\nhere, and they were very tough then.",
        "A: And I was advised by people in Saint Louis that came from New York that I should\ngo to New York because in New York they are me \u2014 there is more help with\nimmigration, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 there are people that can help you, so \u2014 and I was trying to get a job in New York.\nSo I came in New York and I went to Cornell Medical School to see this friend of mine,\nand there was this girl, you see, my wife.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I was in New York for 15 years.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: I was practicing \u2014 well, I was a resident \u2014 I was a resident in \u2014 I took a year in just\nmedicine, then I was a resident in surgery, and then I was in practice for 15 years in New\nYork. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Then the things change in the profession you see, in New York. And it became the \u2014\nthe individual practice of medicine like we used to do became group practice. And I\ndecided that I\u2019m going to go to Houston to take a post-graduate training in heart surgery,\nyou see, because thoracic surgery have changed from the lung, to heart surgery. And so I\ntook this job in Houston for two years, a fellowship in the Texas Heart Institute. And\nmy wife, again, the practice \u2014 she was in practice of psychiatry, became to such an extent\nthat she didn\u2019t want to join a group, or something like this. And she decided to get the\ntraining in psychiatric administration. So she took a two year, went back to school, to a\nMaster degree in public health, with emphasis on administration. And then she took the\nexams to be an administrator.",
        "A: At the University of Houston.",
        "A: Yeah.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Of course I think that this \u2014 sure.",
        "A: First of all affected us, I think, that we went in medicine, you know? I think my wife\nthe same way, you see that we went in medicine, it affected us in that way. And also, the\nAugust 24, 2010\nfact that you had to do a lot of [indecipherable] changing and shifts, gears, so to speak,\nyou know? There was a lot of that during the war, and you had to be very persistent to \u2014\nto be ab \u2014 to \u2014 to get out of school with a degree, you know? And a lot of people advise\nme, why do you have to go up to medical school for so many years? Why don\u2019t you\nbecome a \u2014 a bacteriologist or a physiologist, or something and so on and so forth, you\nsee? You had to be very persistent to get through medical school, and that took a lot of\nenergy, no question about.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, maybe \u2014 I had friends, and I had a very good relation \u2014 see, I been\nmarried for 52 years, and I had a very good relation with my wife. And being both\ndoctors [indecipherable] understand the profession and so on. And that, they are very\nhelpful, of course.",
        "A: Well, again \u2014 again, it was just very persistent to get through medicine and specialties\nand [indecipherable] examination, and so on. There are a lot of exams in medicine,\ncontinuously you know, and traveling to \u2014 to get the knowhow, you know.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think that maybe the idea was that seeing \u2014 you know, there was\nanother thing also that was when I was the \u2014 as I say, when I went the \u2014 to Paris, you\nknow, waiting to come to this country, there were a lot of refugee camps in Europe, you\nknow. And a friend of mine, a dentist who was \u2014 his family was in Palestine was going\naround these camps trying to convince Jewish people in the camps to come to Marseilles,\nso that they can emigrate to \u2014 to Israel, because by that time, the state was there.",
        "A: And there \u2014 I don\u2019t know, there are a lot of bad situations around and I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe I had the feeling that being a doctor you can help some people, or you can help to\nchange some of the situation.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: You see, in \u2014 no, most of those people concentrated around the Jewish hospital in New\nYork, you know, like Mount Sinai, Beth Israel \u2014\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 and \u2014 and later on I had the relation with Beth Israel, but by the time I came to Beth\nIsrael, it was late in th \u2014 it was a kind of a religious situation, it wasn\u2019t the \u2014 th-the\nsituation of a war, you see?",
        "A: But the one thing which \u2014 which remains, and this has been said before by other\npeople, now that this Nazi Germany produced a tremendous amount of shifting of people\nand population all around Europe, a tremendous amount of damage, you know.",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Four\nAugust 24, 2010\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. This friend of mine, the dentist, he went to some of those camps, and \u2014 trying to\nbring people to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 go to Israel, right. Yeah, but I didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: You see, this is th \u2014 is another thing that, probably now that you ask those question, I\nthink that one of the reason I was persistent to get a medical degree in th \u2014 work as a\ndoctor, was to give some stability, internal stability that you were somebody that has a\npurpose, and so on, instead of floating. Now, there were a lot of young men floating\nAugust 24, 2010\naround Paris and floating around Israel in those days, you see? And being a doctor and\nhaving a definite profession, it gives you ce \u2014 a certain amount of inner stability, I think.",
        "A: And something that this was, and something that you can concentrate on, and get\nsome results.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. I \u2014 I \u20141n spite of all this talk you know, with Obamacare, you know, all this\ntalk about medicine and so on, I said well, I mean, if I had to do it again, [ll do it again.",
        "A: After the Katrina. Well, let me \u2014 you see, after the Katrina, they closed the \u2014 I used\nto work in a clinic in Charity Hospital for many years, you know. I worked in the clinic\nand you see, I had the two appointments. I had \u2014 I was clinical associate professor in\nsurgery at Tulane Medical School. I\u2019m still there, I\u2019m emeritus now. And I had, at the\nsame time, a position in the cli \u2014 different clinics in Charity Hospital, because that\u2019s\nwhere I go \u2014 I was getting paid to, you see? But the work in Charity Hospital, you have\nto belong to the medical school, you know, it\u2019s one of those things.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: After I was in Houston.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes, from 1978 or something \u2014 I \u2014 I worked in Charity Hospital for 28 years.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I was teaching surgery for a time \u2014 for a time. Then I worked in a\nwalk-in clinic, then I worked in an anesthesia clinic. Last thing in the 2005, I was in\nanesthesia clinic.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And then they wrote a letter saying that the hospital is going to close, and if \u2014 it \u2014 my\nsituation, after all these years, that I can retire, so I retire. Most of us who worked in that\nsituation retired.\nAugust 24, 2010",
        "A: No, I like to work, you know, and I\u2019m still interested in medicine, and I like to work.\nBut it was again one of those situations where my \u2014 once \u2014 one of the reason that I left, of\ncourse w-were, you see, I had two \u2014 two hits, you know. A hit was in 2004 when my wife\ndied.",
        "A: That was one hit.",
        "A: And then the second hit was Katrina, you see? And I had the impression 1n my age\nthat I have to \u2014 to wait for a long time in New Orleans to change the situation. So then I\ndecided I\u2019m just going to come here, you see.",
        "A: Because was again a very bad situation in New Orleans after Katrina.",
        "A: Where?",
        "A: OhI\u2014I go once in a while to the [indecipherable] at Washington \u2014 George\nWashington University. I go to the library there also.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, this may help somebody maybe, or maybe the \u2014 somebody gets\nsome use for it.",
        "A: This is what Radu said, if I had an interesting life.",
        "A: Yeah.",
