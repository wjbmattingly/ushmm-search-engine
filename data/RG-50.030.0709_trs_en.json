        "Contact reference@ushmn.org for further information about this collection\n[RJ] My father was a blacksmith. An industrial blacksmith. My mother, mother,\nwas a tailor.\n[DL] And in terms of your schooling and your background?\n[RJ] | went to the local school, then | won a scholarship and went to the grammar\nschool.\n[DL] And from there, what did you do?\n[RJ] When | was fourteen, my father was trades, all he believed in was trades\nand he wouldn't let me stop there so they got me out at 14 and they apprenticed\nme to the local firm Geskin and Nettleford as a wire drawer. | learnt my trade as\nwire drawer.\n[DL] And when the outbreak of war actually happened when you were twenty\ntwo, whereabouts were you and what happened to you from there?\n[RJ] | worked in Cardiff, Eastmoor, Cardiff, GKN, Geskin and Nettlefold and, er, |\ngot called up in September 1940, which was rather a mistake because | had a\nreserved occupation \u2014 er, cut a long story shot, it was, | had my call up papers\nbut erm when | went down to work to see about it they discovered that my form\nthat | had filled in to say that | had a reserved occupation was some typist put it in\nthe incoming mail instead of the outgoing mail, no record of me at the labour\nexchange - so | got called up. So | went to the Brecon to the South Wales\nborders and | was there for about two months and | got called in to the CO as my\nfirm had err tried to get me back naturally. Oh he said, you'll have to serve three\nmonths proficiency pay first. | said, yes, okay. So another couple of months went\nby and | got another call to go in there and his argument then was oh it\u2019s\nchanged he said you'll have to serve six months proficiency and then we'll see\nabout it. It was pretty obvious to me that he wasnt going to let me go so, so, in\nthe meantime, they offered me to let me go to a CADRE course and | thought it\nwas a bit more money and so | took it. | had another request from the firm to get\nme back. And he said, \u201cOh my God,\u201d he said, \u201cNCOs | couldn't let you go. On no\naccount.\u201d And within six months | was out abroad.\n[DL] So, where did they send you first?",

        "[RJ] They sent me out to Cairo. To the Citadel in Cairo. To make up a battalion of\nthe First battalion Welsh Regiment that got knocked about in Crete.\n[DL] And briefly describe your time in North Africa leading up to your capture?\n[RJ] | was in Cairo for about four or five weeks\n[00:05:00]\n[RJ] and then they sent us what they called \u201cthe blue\u201d up the desert and we\nfought our way up to Benghazi and we got up to Benghazi by Christmas, had my\nChristmas dinner there and then in January, forty five\u2019, the Russians, the\nGermans came out there and Rommel circled our camp at Benghazi and caught\nthe lot of us, the whole end block.\n[DL] And how where you captured?\n[RJ] Er, Sgt Major Convill said to me Corporal Jones Go up the road and take a\nsection up the road and see what is going on. (Laughs). | hadn't gone 100 yards\nup the road and there was a dirty great tiger tank coming down the road with a\nbig swastika on the side, a big black cross and there was err a fellow, | presume\na German officer, sticked up in the turret there and in perfect English he said to\nme, \u201cCome on boys drop your weapons, for you the war is over.\u201d So | was a\nprisoner of war.\n[DL] So when you were captured where were you sent?\n[RJ] We taken up to Tripoli and we were put in empty little cargo boats that were\ngoing out to Naples with equipment for the Germans so | arrived in, | forget what\nthe date was, it was about the end of February when | got out to Naples and the\nltalians took us down to Camp 065 in the heel of Italy in Brindisi err and | was\nthere for about, oh, going on for nine months and then one day they got us\ntogether and put us on a train and took us up to a place | think it was called\nTarona just outside Rome\n[DL] And when was this?\n[RJ] This was something like July, August 43. And then one day, the interpreter\ncame round and he asked for anybody with engineering experience and, of\ncourse, a couple of hundred of us stuck our hands up. We wanted to know what\n' The actual date was January 1942. This correct year is rectified during the course of the interview.",

He said, \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are short of labour in the car factories in Milan,\u201d\nand we thought, \u201cOh that\u2019s a good thing to get out anyway\u201d - cause nobody\nworked in Italy mind, so, anyway we got on this train now and we travelled\novernight and we pulled up in this station in the morning thinking it was Milan and\nwe heard \u201cRous! Rous!\u201d outside and one of the boys said, \u201cHey, that\u2019s German!\u201d\nlt was the Brenner Pass and they were handing us over to the Germans. The\nGermans then stuck us in cattle trucks, forty in a truck, and took me then | was in\nthe truck for two days, no food, and we all had the runs, just imagine how\nhumiliating it is in those trucks with no toilets nothing and we used one of the\ncorners as a toilet. We go to, | think Stalag IVB at Moosburg, | think it was, and\nthere they got us out they gave us some food and by this time, don\u2019t forget, we\nare covered in lice. So they took all of our uniforms and put it in whatever it did,\ncleaned them up and gave it to us back whilst we were naked they took us\nthrough a place where they had like sheep shearers and they took all our hair off,\neverywhere, up, down below, up on the top, everywhere, and then they dabbed\nus with what | called was a bucket of creosote, and disinfectant anyway they put\nus back on the train now and we were on the train again for about another two\ndays and eventually pulled up in a station called Lansdorf, Poland. Err, it was\nStalag V111B\n[DL] And when, when did you arrive at Stalag VIIIB?\n[RJ] Stalag VIIIB? It was in err, | think it was around about the beginning of\nSeptember 43.\n[DL] So when were you captured in North Africa?\n[RJ] | was captured in North Africa on the second week in January 45\n[00:10:00]\n[DL] Sorry, forty? When you were captured, was it 1943?\n[RJ] No, forty two.\n[DL] Forty two. So, you were captured in 1942 and then ended you up at Stalag\nVIIIB.\n[RJ] | ended up in Italy first and then Stalag VIIIB was close on | think it was,\nabout, the end of, round about the beginning of September 43.",

        "[DL] Fine. So at this point you had spent close on 18 months in captivity.",
        "[RJ] In Italy, in Italy, it was a problem. If it hadn't been for the Red Cross parcels",
        "then | don\u2019t think we would have survived. All they gave us was a little loaf of",
        "bread. We used to call it a Piccolo Parnie. A bit of cheese and stuff like that. And",
        "then every day we used to get what we called potato soup, a ladle of soup, that",
        "was all we had. If it hadn\u2019t have been for the Red Cross parcels then | don\u2019t think",
        "we would have survived.",
        "[DL] In terms of what conditions were like at Stalag VIIIB, how did the Germans",
        "treat you and how long were you there for?",
        "[RJ] Well, the Germans didn't bother us but the British had a bit of a err a centre,",
        "like a medical centre, they took all of our clothes and of course by then there was",
        "a blue diamond on the back of your coat and your trousers to say that you was a",
        "prisoner of war. Err, they sorted us out. By this time | had a beard and they",
        "sorted us out but, in Germany, everybody below the rank of Sergeant worked.",
        "There was about, as far as | know, 130,000 Prisoners of War, of all nationalities",
        "in Poland. They worked on farms, err, one mate of mine, Trevor Manly, lived up",
        "the road here, he worked in a coal mine, err, railways, err, then eventually, they",
        "picked out 280 of us and sent us out to work at IG Farben chemical industry.",
        "That's all we knew.",
        "[DL] And, the British were effectively organizing themselves at Stalag VIIIB?",
        "[RJ] Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "[DL] So...",
        "[RJ] The guards didn't interfere with us they effectively just patrolled the grounds.",
        "[DL] So how did you go from Stalag VIIIB to...",
        "[RJ] They took us on an ordinary civilian train, err, and (phone rings) we were on",
        "the train for several hours and then we pulled up in the station and we marched",
        "down to our camp. On the way down, we saw all this high barbed wire and men",
        "in pyjamas digging trenches. Now, don\u2019t forget this is October and it\u2019s pretty cold",
        "in Poland in October so | said to one of the guards, \u201cWho are they?\u201d And he said,",
        "\u201cJuden!\u201d | said, \u201cPardon?\u201d And he said, just how I'll say it, \u201cJews!\u201d Like as though",
        "we should have known. It took us a couple of days to realize that it was\n7",
        "Auschwitz. We didn\u2019t know what Auschwitz was in those days but it didn't take us",
        "long to find out what was going on. We went down to the works and found out.",
        "The first thing we noticed was a terrible smell and the Jews in the works told us it",
        "was the crematorium. We didn't know what they were talking about to start with",
        "but after a while we realized what was going on.",
        "[DL] When you got to Auschwitz, your first POW camp there:E711.",
        "[RJ] Yes, yes, they took us into a camp called E7171. It was pretty primitive. The",
        "toilets, for instance, were just a hole in the floor over a cesspool and we were",
        "there for two to three weeks and then they sent us over to E715 which | presume",
        "was a, a camp built for the Hitler Youth. There, of course, the facilities were",
        "totally different, we even had showers and flushed toilets and a place where you",
        "could do a bit of cooking.",
        "[DL] And the actual location of your first camp, E711, compared to Monowitz.",
        "Whereabouts would you say?",
        "[RJ] | think. We didn\u2019t march there. We just sort of strolled over to the new place",
        "so | should imagine that it was attached to it but | am not quite certain of that.",
        "[00:15:00]",
        "[DL] But within the compound of Auschwitz itself (Ron: yeah), within the actual",
        "wired facility (Ron: yeah) that was Auschwitz (Ron: yeah)?",
        "[RJ] | would think we were about two to two and a half kilometers from Birkenau",
        "which was the death camp.",
        "[DL] And whereabouts was E715 Auschwitz?",
        "[RJ] It used to take us about 10 minutes, quarter of an hour to march there so it",
        "must have been quite close to IG Farben.",
        "[DL] And, what was the average day like for yourselves? In terms of...",
        "[RJ] We got up at half past five with a cup of Ersatz coffee, burnt acorns as they",
        "called it. (Laughs) Er, that\u2019s all we had then, then we, oh, they used to give us a",
        "piece of bread, with, we used to have cut up a loaf of bread which we would cut",
        "up between eighteen of us, just one thick slice. And then we used to get, what",
        "they called a piece of cheese, it was like a round, err, how could you call a round",
        "pasty of cheese? You could see fish scales in it and it stunk like all the heaven.\n8",
        "But when you're hungry then, believe me, you'll eat anything. Err, and then we\nhad sometimes a bit of, sometimes, a bit of jam to go on your bread. That was\nthe rations you had then you marched to work, you got into, marched about six\no'clock, then you got into works about ten to quarter past six and then they used\nto hand us over to the civilians. There were nine of us in a little gang and they\nthey, they handed us over to a fellow called Master Beaver. He was aaa\nGerman civilian. In fairness, he was pretty fair to us. He'd say like, | want this,\nwe were, we were constructing, err, | worked on a place, there was synthetic\npetrol, when | got there it was only just being built. They had, what they called,\nthe Germans called \u201ckramers\u201d* \u2014 it was like, erm, an iron pipe about sixty feet\nhigh. There were three of them there and they were full of clay filters and the\npetrol used to go in through the top and down through the filters but we used to\nmove err machinery and rails and, fair play for Beaver, he used to say \u201cGet this\ndone, get that done and you can go back to the camp.\u201d So, occasionally, instead\nof going back to the camp at six o'clock, we went back at three o\u2019clock in the\nafternoon. When we had completed what he wanted us to do.\n[DL] And what did you actually witness when you were at IG Farben when you\nwere working in there with the slave laborers around you? How were they treated\nand what did you witness when you were there?\n[RJ] Well, we saw, all these Jews working there and they used to be digging\ntrenches and laying cables and all what we would used to call the menial tasks.\nYou know. Err, to give you an idea, one of them, | had some, we had some food\nparcels in, so we didn't eat the German rations so | had a piece of sausage and |\ntook it down to the works one day and | gave it to one of these Jews and he said\nhis name was Josef, a couple of days after he gave me that ring?, he said he\nmade it out of a steel pipe. | stuck it on my finger and there it\u2019s been ever since.\nAbout a week after that, he disappeared, so | said to one of his mates, \u201cWhere\u2019s\nJosef this morning?\u201d and he said \u201cOh, gas chamber. Kaput.\u201d That\u2019s just what he\nsaid.

A crowd of us got together and\nremonstrated but when we got to camp that night that Under Officer\u00ae had\ndisappeared. When we enquired what had happened to him because we wanted\nthe Red Cross to come there they said they'd sent him to the Russian Front.\n[DL] So you said that you wanted the Red Cross to investigate the shooting?\n[RJ] We wanted the Red Cross to investigate it because, let\u2019s be fair, the\nGermans weren't like that, they didn't, they didn\u2019t treat us bad at all.\n[DL] Because they treated the Jews badly.\n[RJ] (Jones does not hear and continues interview and ends reference to the\nReynolds shooting by saying: That was just a one off).\n[DL] In terms of an actual war crime against the British POWs, as far as you're\naware, that was the only war crime which took place?\n[RJ] That was the only war crime which | spied myself.\n[DL] Okay. What was your initial impressions during your first few weeks at\nAuschwitz?\n[RJ] We couldn't get over this smell and, and, and they were burning fellows,\nthey were burning the Jews.

We just couldn't understand it.\n[DL] In terms of the crematoria, how did you know, what?\n[RJ] Occasionally, we would see smoke coming up and we'd say to ourselves\nthat\u2019s some more poor buggers burnt to death again.\n[DL] Were you scared of the crematoria?\n[RJ] Of course we were. We thought if ever they got desperate then they\u2019d put us\nin there.\n[DL] So that was a very genuine concern?\n[RJ] That was a genuine scare.

How did the British POWs cope, how did you cope, knowing that the\ngas chambers were, were on site and what was happening to the Jews.\n[RJ] Well, well, we just carried on working and |, | just can\u2019t remember. We were\nalright. Prisoner of war life wasn\u2019t all that bad. Err, we suffered malnutrition. To\ngive you an idea we suffered with our teeth. Used to chip and enamel would\ncome off with malnutrition. Err, and err, once every week on a Wednesday, a\nguard was allowed to take three or four of us err up into Caravichi\u2019 to a Polish\ndentist.

They wouldn't allow it because | was a married man.\n[DL] We've already touched on Master Beaver who was in charge of your\nworking group you were in. How large was the working group that you were\nactually in...\n[RJ] There were nine of us who worked for Master Beaver.\n[DL] And in terms of the actual work which you undertook apart from cleansing\nout the towers, what other types of work did you undertake?\n[RJ] Oh, we used to move machinery around. As a matter of fact, the nail on my\nleft foot is like a great big claw because | dropped a rail on it one day. We were\nmoving rails for runners and things like that, all sorts of machinery.\n[DL] And in terms of the British and their attitudes towards you for medical help in\nthat sort of situation. What sort of medical help was there for you at E715\nAuschwitz?\n[RJ] All we had was a er, as far as | know, he was a South African doctor and\nthat\u2019s all we had. | think he had a fellow that used to assist him but I\u2019m not quite\nsure.\n[DL] And what were conditions like in your medical facility there?\n[RJ] Erm, well, to get a day off as, one thing, we were covered in boils, | used to\nget boils and carbuncles and even when | came home | had them. And when |\nsay | had a boil everywhere, | mean everywhere. | used to get terrible carbuncles\nand boils, | presume it was malnutrition. | don't know.\n[DL] And the actual medical facilities on site at E715?\n[RJ] Oh, poor. Poor. They never had the equipment, they never had the drugs as\nfar as | know. Don\u2019t forget, we were all reasonably fit men so | don\u2019t suppose we\nneeded that kind of thing.\n[DL] And in terms of your relationships with the Jews, how did that work?

We had proper toilets, we even had a proper shower. We\nused to walk across and have a proper shower occasionally. We were pretty\ngood there, it was alright. All the huts had, er, hot water pipes around them, tt\nwas a bit cold at times but, er, dont forget that in winter out there the\ntemperature used to drop down to sometimes around 15 below...\n[DL] There was also a library?\n[RJ] Yes, we also had a library there.

He tied\nthe legs around his waist and he had the neck down where his old boy was and\nthe guard found it, touched it, he thought he was looking for women. Anyway, he\nfound it and he took him into the guard room and he come back laughing as even\nthe Verlthere was laughing about it and let me keep it so he brought it home.\n[DL] Just going back to the way in which the Jews were actually treated, did you\never discuss their conditions once you played your football, had cards, or during\nrehearsals in the play, did you discuss at that point how you felt they were being\nmistreated. What sort of discussions did you ever have on the subject?\n[RJ] | don\u2019t remember. | just don\u2019t remember.\n[DL] How many men were there at E715 Auschwitz?\n[01:00:00]\n[RJ] | always understood that there were 280 of us who went out to Auschwitz.\nBut of course when they bombed the factory one day, a bomb dropped in our\ncamp and killed about 30 or 40 of our men.\n[DL] The bombing raid at E715 Auschwitz, when did that happen?\n[RJ] One Sunday morning.\n[DL] Do you remember the year? The date?\n[RJ] It must have been during forty four. | can\u2019t remember dates. It must have\nbeen around forty four.\n[DL] And what actually happened?\n[RJ] Well, we used to hear the sirens going off. Oh, one day, it happened when\nwe were down in the works and a few of us jumped into a trench.\n[DL] And the actual bombing raid?\n[RJ] Now, if | remember rightly, we were injured when we were in that trench and\nwe had blood coming from our mouths and our bottoms and | was taken into\nhospital for three or four days, civvy hospital. Who was with me | can\u2019t remember.\nWhen you talk about these things memories come back don\u2019t they? | can't\nremember any more than that?\n[DL] And the bombing raid of forty four?",
        "27",
        "[RJ] During forty four, yes.\n[DL] What happened and where were you?\n[RJ] Its only once | remember when | was put in hospital. But basically it was\nalways on a Sunday morning when there was no one working there and then\nthey used to get us in on Monday to get everything right again.\n[DL] You talked about, earlier, before we started the interview about the carpet\nbombing \u2014 could you talk us through that again?\n[RJ] When the sirens went off we used to watch the planes \u2014 they weren't very\nhigh they used to come in from four quarters and we used to say, Hello, Number\none shovel ready and they used to come down all at once. They called it carpet\nbombing, | think. But the sky was full of these little bombs.\n[DL] And on the Sunday when the air raid shelter was hit \u2014 what actually\nhappened?\n[RJ] Well they used to drop into the works and on one occasion, | think there was\na bombing raid about three or four times whilst | was there. They used to get us\nto work the following morning to rectify all the problems which had happened.\n[DL] You were in a depression, a small grove?\n[RJ] Yes, yes, when the bomb dropped on our camp. The Germans allowed us to\ndig a trench and put some tin sheets over the top and then the earth would be\nput over it. Now I'm a bit claustrophobic, luckily, and | didn't go in there. | wasn't\nthe only one mind, there was quite a few of us who didn't go into the shelter. We\njust lay on the ground outside and, of course, a bomb went right into the entrance\nof the shelter, chaos, chaos. | think there was about thirty or forty killed there and\nthey were buried in the cemetery up in the village but when | went back there to\nlook they\u2019d been taken from there and put into a proper cemetery for British\nsoldiers.\n[DL] What was the feeling amongst British soldiers afterwards?\n[RJ] Oh, terrible. Terrible. Hard to describe. We were all upset, of course we\nwere.\n[DL] What about the experiences the Jews would tell you about? Did the Jews\ntalk about their experiences with you?",
        "28",
        "[RJ] No. No. You wouldn't get near enough to a Jew to talk about. At least |",
        "didn't. | have heard that others did but | didn't get near enough.",
        "[DL] Why was that?",
        "[RJ] There wasn't any Jews working in my area.",
        "[DL] So your working party at IG Farben?",

        "[RJ] How | come to have the Rolex watch, the Poles used to come bartering with",
        "us, of course, they wanted cigarettes. One day a Pole came with a little box and",
        "he opened it up and there was a Rolex oyster watch in there. He wanted some",
        "cigarettes. So, the following day, | took down, | think, something like a couple of",
        "hundred cigarettes, a parcel for the Rolex oyster watch.",
        "[DL] And what happened to the watch?",
        "[RJ] Well, you know we left Auschwitz in January 1945 and we were on that",
        "march and | had it on my wrist, of course, but you have your hands on your",

        "one day anyway. You're not going to complete this march.\u201d That kind of thing but",
        "| don't think they knew where we were going or what was happening. Anyway,",
        "after a couple of days he came with a sack of bread. | don\u2019t Know where he got it",
        "from, Well, | couldn't get the watch off quick enough, could I? There was a gang\n29",
        "of us there and we had a good feast for a few days. It was plain bread but it was\nfood.\n[DL] And do you know where the watch came from, the Pole who gave it to you?\n[RJ] | haven't a clue.\n[DL] There were various stories after the war from men who had been at E715\nAuschwitz who claimed to have swapped places with (interruption from camera\noperator and clap for sync at 01:07:41)... so the stories that came out after the\nwar from individuals at E715 Auschwitz who claimed to have swapped places\nwith....\n[RJ] Denis Avey\n[DL] Denis Avey and Charlie Coward being two among them. Firstly, what\u2019s your\nviews on Charlie Coward's story?\n[RJ] Oh, absolutely a lot of lies. Definitely. What he says he done in the works is\njust plain stupid. In one instance, he says he had a hard cart and he went down\ninto the works with a handcart. He never come out of E175, | never see him in\nthe works and where did he get the handcart from? | never saw any hard cart.\nAnd he used to go around the works and get the dead Jews out \u2014 what for?\n[DL] So Charlie Coward who was the POW liaison officer for the Red Cross, what\nyou re saying is whilst he claimed to get radio parts as well...\n[RJ] Whether he got the parts. | don\u2019t think so. Someone else got the parts and\nthen he looked after the wireless, he knew where it was.\n[DL] Fine. So he was the one\n[RJ] As far as | know\n[DL] But as far as him being down in the works, you never saw him there... so his\nstory of the handcart...\n[Ru] It\u2019s all poppycock.\n[DL] So, his story about finding...\n[RJ] And I\u2019ve talked to Dougie Bond and he says the same thing. He says it was\nall lies.",
        "30",
        "[DL] So Charlie Coward whose affidavit was presented to Nuremberg after the\nwar and in his book where he talks about how he swapped places with someone\nin the Jewish concentration camp there. In your mind that isn\u2019t possible?\n[RJ] From my point of view, yes, | couldn\u2019t see it happening, no.\n[DL] More recently, Denis Avey (Jones: He said the same thing) has gone on to\nwrite alongside a British journalist...\n[01:10:00]\n[DL] ...a book called The Man Who Broke into Auschwitz, what\u2019s your view on\nDenis Avey\u2019s story?\n[RJ] A lot of his book is authentic but as far as he said that he would change\nplaces with this Jew. | just can\u2019t believe it. | just can\u2019t. If you could see the\nsituation you'd say the same thing.\n[DL] What makes you believe that he couldn't do what he claimed to have done?\n[RJ] Well. For instance, when we walked into our camp in the evenings, we\nalways walked in with our hands up stretched. If a Jew had done that, he just\ncouldn't. You should have seen the state of them. They used to shamble about.\nThey didn't walk, they just shambled about with their heads bent, shoulders bent,\nthey just couldn't straighten up, they just couldn't have held their hands up.\nImpossible.\n[DL] What changes actually occurred in the camp towards the end of the war?\n[RJ] Not a lot really. We noticed that the guards weren't as keen as they used to\nbe. They were more friendly, put it that way.\n[DL] When you say they weren't as keen as they used to be?\n[RJ] Well, they\u2019d talk to you. They wouldn't have talked to you before. On that\nmarch, for instance, alright they controlled you but not in the same sense as\nguards would normally do. They used to stick us in barns and leave us overnight.\n| think they would go to the farmhouse for a meal where as we were shut in\nbarns.\n[DL] In terms of changes towards attitudes towards the Jews.

Ages.\n[DL] And what did those nightmares consist of?\n[RJ] Things like | was running away, | was climbing a fence. | was slipping back\nor climbing a path and then, all of a sudden, someone would put a hand on my\nshoulder and | would start to scream.\n[DL] Did you have nightmares about the Jews and the gas chambers?\n[RJ] No, no. Not the Jews.\n[DL] Looking back now, what key memory determines your time at E/15\nAuschwitz?\n[RJ] I\u2019ve forgotten it, really. Until people started to talk to me about it about it | just\ndon't bother about it.\n[DL] Why do you think you have forgotten about it?\n[RJ] Well, | suppose it was just a war time experience that was best forgotten.\nLoads of people have wartime experiences.\n[DL] How did it your experience at E715 affect you during the course of your life\u2019?\nIt has definitely, | am not the man that | was. As a matter of fact, before the war |\nwas a shy, quiet, timid man and, of course, | met Gladys when | was 15 and | had\na lovely life, no problems, but since then | used to lose my temper quick. I\u2019d\nargue now and | wouldn't accept things that | would of before the war. I\u2019m a\ndifferent man now, definitely different.\n[DL] Would you say that that was because of your experience at Auschwitz?\n[RJ] At Auschwitz.\n[DL] So what caused that change at Auschwitz?\n[RJ] Being pushed around, being told what to do. I\u2019ve never been in my life been\ntold what to do before. | had my own job my own life, I\u2019ve been my own boss and\nnobody's told me what to do.",

It must have. | must have taken notice of it, more than what\nyou realize.\n[DL] You mentioned about the memory of how the Jews walked. Why is that an\nimportant memory for you?\n[RJ] They were dying on their feet from lack of food. They\u2019d walk about like\npeople dying. Shambles. Shambles.\n[01:35:00]\n[DL] Is there anything else you want to add, is there anything else that you feel\nwe haven't touched upon.\n[RJ] No.\nNOTE: 01:35:10 \u2014 01:43:10: Separate shots of photographs from E/15\nAuschwitz together with other items from his time as a POW.\nENDS",
