        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: It\u2019s lovely to see you, finally.",
        "A: Good to see you.",
        "Q: Miles tell me, where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Tomashev Rovelski, which is a small town in between Lublin and Lvov.",
        "Q: And when were you born?",
        "A: In 1920.",
        "Q: January?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: 20\"? Yeah. Tell me something. I want -- I want to get some idea about your family, and\nabout living in Poland bef -- before the war, but if I would ask you, what is your first\nmemory, the most prominent memory you have of your childhood, what would come to\nyour mind?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s growing up in a small town, you know, and what would come to my mind\nprobably most, would be the fact that I was the youngest in the family, and my parents\nwere Orthodox Jews, and my older siblings, my brothers and my sisters, were kind of\npaving the way for me, which, you know, getting our parents to accept certain things that\nnormally they would not. So, in Yiddish they call it the mizinik, that means the -- the\nyoungest. I was fortunate, and privileged as a result of this, and --",
        "Q: So tell me, you -- you have a brother Shlomo.",
        "A: I had a brother Shlomo.",
        "Q: You had a brother Shlomo, and he was -- he was --",
        "A: He was --",
        "Q: -- the eldest?",
        "A: He wa -- he was the oldest.",
        "Q: And when was he born, do you remember?",
        "A: 1904.",
        "Q: 1904?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And --",
        "A: And then I had a sister, Esther, she was born in 1906, and I had another sister, she was\nborn in 1908, and that --",
        "Q: And that\u2019s Peshe.",
        "A: Peshe.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then I have a brother who lives in Florida now, and he was born in 1910.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s his name?",
        "A: Jonah.",
        "Q: Jonah. And were all the siblings prior to your birth, moving away from Orthodoxy?",
        "A: Well, not all of them. My oldest sister Esther did not. But bear in mind that this was a\nperiod that the -- the coming out of -- of Jewish, young Jewish people, coming out of the\nO-Orthodox confines, you know, and embracing the culture and -- and the type of living\nthat was, you know, in the process of developing. It was in the process of developing. So,\nit -- it is difficult to say what was the year that a break point came. It was more you have\nto deal with it, you know, in periods, in that case, perhaps. But it was an interesting\nperiod, it was a period where the transition from straight Orthodoxy, and you know, no\nquestions asked, to you know, this 1s the Jewish law, and this is the custom, and this is\nwhat you do, came under scrutiny by young people. Young people wanted to embrace,\nyou know, the customs and, you know, culture of the country, either that they lived in, or\nthat was neighboring, you know, Poland.",
        "Q: And did -- did this distress your parents, from what you remember?",
        "A: Yes, it did, because they felt that we are wandering off, and we will wind up in a different\nculture, an-and to them it was a very, very major problem, no question about it.",
        "Q: Did this -- did this mean that there was a kind of internal argument, in -- 1n the -- in the\nhousehold?",
        "A: It was not only internal, it was -- it was -- our -- our parents did not take kindly to the fact\nthat, for instance, my brother, my oldest brother, you know, he was not kosher. This was\nunheard of in those days, you know. My older sister, Esther, she was perhaps a little more\nprogressive than my parents, but religious, and following the rules and customs, you\nknow, that she was raised -- she was brought up in. My younger sister was -- Peshe was\ndesiring to make progress, but was not quite that courageous. But Jonah, he was the\nfighter.",
        "Q: Right. And were you -- were you modeling yourself off of [indecipherable]",
        "A: I was -- first of all, bear in mind that there was a difference between -- in my ye -- young\n-- my oldest -- my youngest sibling, and me, what there was a difference of 10 years. So,\nyou know, it\u2019s a substantial difference. And I was the baby in the family, and -- you\nknow, and -- and that\u2019s -- I pointed out to you the fact that I was the youngest, you know,\neverybody treated me with a little extra affection, and what have you. And I would say,\nwhen I look at it back, that my effort to embrace, you know, progress and, you know, and\nmodern methods and -- and -- and stepping away from some of the Jewish laws was the\nmost af -- most vivid. And my parents recognized it, and they tried, but they tried with\nme, not ano -- in the manner of laying down the law and no questions asked, but trying to\npersuade me, trying to do certain things, you know. But they realized that times are\nchanging, and it will be a different world.",
        "Q: Did you speak Polish and Yiddish in the house, or --",
        "A: In the house, Yiddish.",
        "Q: Yiddish.",
        "A: With my colleagues, Polish and Yiddish.",
        "Q: And did your parents speak Polish as well?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: They did?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So when you grew up, were you growing up in a very mixed atmosphere, or because your\nparents were Orthodox Jews, it was very enclosed within the Jewish community?",
        "A: They were two processes of growing up. One was the growing up at home, and the other\none is the growing up at outside. At home my parents were Orthodox Jews. My father\nwas a -- a lieutenant of one of the famous rabbis of those days, the Belzai rabbi that you\nprobably heard about it, you know, the Belzai rab -- the Belzai rabbi was one of the\nmajor, major, ra-rabbinic dynasties of those days, and my father was a lieutenant there.\nThis was something very unusual.",
        "Q: And what does that mean?",
        "A: He was very close to the -- the rabbi, and when he ki -- first of all, he supported him\nsubstantially. And when he came to Beltz, where the rabbi lived, is -- my father was\ncalled [indecipherable] Tomasheva, that was a big to-do. If the rabbi or his family, or his\nbrother, who was the chief rabbi of Bilgori, which was a neighboring city, came to\nTomashev, they stayed in our house. This is something extra, extra special.",
        "Q: Mm. So your father was a prominent person?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And mother.",
        "Q: And mother. So tell me about him. What do you remember about your father?",
        "A: Well, first of all, youll have to bear in mind that we are dealing about a period where\nJews were confined to their own cultural environment. And my father, for in-- to give\nyou an example, was very friendly with the township judge. But being friendly with the\ntownship judge did not mean that the township judge invited my father for dinner, or my\nfather invited the judge for dinner. But they were very, very friendly, you know, and th --\nmy father was very respected. As far as our material position in town, I would say we\nwere considered one of the wealthiest people, and this had it\u2019s impact also.",
        "Q: And your father was as a -- a business person? He ran a --",
        "A: My father, yes. My father concentrated on -- we -- we were millers. And some mills we\nowned, and some mills we leased and operated. But we were millers for generations, you\nknow? And my mother was a very, very bright woman, very bright woman, very unusual\nwoman, and she was running businesses on her own. She had a wholesale import, and --\nan import business of tea, and coffee, and -- and spices, and you know -- it was a very\nlarge business. L-Large to an extent -- to give you it -- it\u2019s -- it will sound funny. When\nsalespeople came to town -- it\u2019s going to be difficult to describe it for you in English,\nbecause in English the -- in Polish there is a difference between male and female when\nyou refer to somebody. In English you don\u2019t -- who is Joan Ringleheim, who is Miles\nLerman? But in Polish is, this is -- you know, defined in masculine, and in -- in -- 1n -- in",
        "Q: In feminine.",
        "A: In feminine.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And salesmen used to come and ask who is this, but referring to it, you know, as a man,\nJarket Lerman, you know. In other words, they couldn\u2019t believe that a business of this\nmagnitude, of this size, is run and operated by a woman.",
        "Q: So how did that happen? It\u2019s so unusual, it would seem to me, during that era.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, yes. You have to bear in mind that for women to be involved in -- in the p -- in\n-- in -- in the task of earning a living was not unusual in Poland, because you have to\nunderstand that going back not too many years, not too many decades, it was the nicest\nthing. The best thing that could happen to a man is to sit and study Torah, and his wife\nwas the breadwinner. But the breadwinner, she had a little stall, you know, and was\nselling a herring, or you know, or some flour, or some sugar, you know, and scraped out a\nliving.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: This is not what my mother did. My mother ran a very, very large business. And it was\ndifficult for th -- [indecipherable] I told you, it was difficult for them to conceive that a\nwoman is on this level.",
        "Q: Did she come from a family where they were business people as well, is this what --",
        "A: Well, y-yes, my grandfa -- I remember my grandfather on the ma -- on the maternal side,\nhe was at -- he had a -- he was mun -- he was in charge, he had -- I was gonna call it a\nfactory, it was not a factory, it was a plant, where they were making wooden shingles,\nbecause wooden shingles were used, you know, for roofs, and this was th -- it\u2019s like\nhaving a -- a roofing business, you know. So, yes, they came from a business family, but\nnot of the size, and not of the caliber that my mother developed.",
        "Q: So the kids of the family, did they help in the milling business of your father? Didn\u2019t you\nhelp more with your mother?",
        "A: Depends.",
        "Q: Depends.",
        "A: It depends. This was not the only business we had. We had a wholesale business of\nliquor, which is, you know, this -- this -- you needed special license for it. So, my\nbrother, for instance, when he was in Tomashev, was in charge of the liquor business. My\nsister Peshe and her husband were in charge helping mother with her business. My older\nsister, Esther, and her second husband -- because she lost her husband at a very early age,\nwere in charge of helping father with the mills. So everybody did something, you know,\nspecifically, and mother and father were directing traffic, they were, you know --",
        "Q: And you?",
        "A: I -- I was in school. I was the youngest, you know, and my father died in 1938. Normal\ndeath, you know. When I say normal, it was not part of the Holocaust --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- it was 1938. And I came home, and the family decided now because I wa -- I studied in\nLvov, you know, so the family decided that mother is going to need help, and you know,\nand there will be a reshuffling of who will do what, and they decided that I need to\ninterrupt my schooling and stay home, which I regret very much.",
        "Q: So let me go back to when you were a kid. Were you a very spoiled kid?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I was not very spoiled, but spoiled.",
        "Q: Did you like school?",
        "A: I liked school, I was very good in school. I was not a very intensive studier, you know,\nbut I had no trouble, I had good grades, and you know, I -- I\u2019m a little bit of a devil. I was\na little bit of a devil.",
        "Q: I\u2019m surprised. Was it a little bit difficult at home in some ways, being the youngest,\nbecause all your siblings were so much older?",
        "A: No, this was -- my being the youngest was a plus, because everybody felt that they -- you\nknow, I\u2019m the kid, the kid brother, and they need to be good to me, and they need to be\ngood with me, and they need to play a role in, you know, in bringing me up, because bear\nin mind that mother is, you know, the impressive person she was in the world of business,\nshe was an extremely religious woman. She bought a shaitel, you know what a shaitel is?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The wig.",
        "A: Wig. And you know, the maids that we had, had to run a very, very tight, and kosher with\n-- there\u2019s no question about it. Not only kosher, but a very, very carefully, you know,\nmanaged kosher home.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, in mother, as -- as busy as she was with her business, always -- the -- the -- there used\nto be a form of reading the Bible in a woman\u2019s way, it\u2019s what\u2019s called atsana varanay. Let\nit -- it\u2019s a Hebrew, say [indecipherable] let\u2019s go out and see -- to -- to study. My mother,\nas busy as she was, always, you know, you could find her when she was sitting and\nstudying, you know Jewish customs, Jewish ways, Jewish stories. I have very warm\nrecollections about it, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: You were close to your mother.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you closer than your -- with your father?",
        "A: No, I was closer with my mother, because my mother was home all the time, my father\ntraveled a lot --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- on account of the flour mills, because they were all over eastern Poland.",
        "Q: Did you all, brothers and sisters and husbands eat dinner together, or was this once a\nweek, or --",
        "A: Those that were home, yes, th -- but on Shabbas predominantly, not in the middle of the\nweek.",
        "Q: Right. So you would eat dinner with your mother, usually?",
        "A: Ah, yes, yes.",
        "Q: And you had a cook in the house, [indecipherable] maid, so --",
        "A: Oh yes, we had a cook, and a maid, I mean th -- that -- my parents were very, very much\nwrapped up in --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- in a -- large businesses.",
        "Q: And what sort of cultural life was there in town? Were there movies? There was theater?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. It was a small town, you know, but the -- you ask me whether there was a\nmovie house, yes. Theaters used to come.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, traveling theaters.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But let me say this to you, it was a town where was in the process of reforming itself, and\nthere were many, many young people, either my brother\u2019s age, or my sister\u2019s age, who\nreally were carrying the ball to reshape the character of the community. There were\nZionist organizations, there were sports clubs, you know. And all -- the -- if you ask me\nwhether my father was in favor of my brother playing soccer, no. He would much rather\nhave him sit and study, you know, the Bible, and what have you. But this was not the\ncase, they were, you know, rebelling, rebelling in a -- in a gradual manner, but making\ntheir way into modern life.",
        "Q: And was this happening all over Poland --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- as far as you understand --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- that this was a -- a big movement.",
        "A: It was more even than Poland, I would say that we are talking about a period -- because I\nkeep saying to you that I don\u2019t want -- don\u2019t want to define it for days --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- it was more a period of years, or decades. It was a period where Europe chain -- s-say it\nwas described as the spring of Europe, you know, that there was modernization in every\naspect. In the aspect of doing business, in the aspect of culture, in the aspect of study, and\nin the aspect of Jews making their place in the non-Jewish society. And bear in mind that\nthis was a period when Jews were ghettoized, but not in the sense of ghetto from the\nHolocaust, ghettoized means that there were sections of town where Jews lived, you\nknow. And I would say that the process -- for instance, to give you an example. In our\nentire town there were three -- three people that graduated high school and went on to\ncollege.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: [-It -- graduating high school was a high level of education. Predominantly it was public\nschool, you know. So the progress came in this way, the -- politically, the -- the Jews\nstarted to assert themselves, to have representation in the house of -- in the parliament.\nAnti-Semitism was there, but anti-Semitism in a kind of segmented way. It -- it was not\nan anti-Semitism that was active every day of the year, but in the last few years before the\nwar, it intensified substantially.",
        "Q: So in your growing up, you were not feeling a great deal of anti-Semitism as a -- as a\nyoung boy.",
        "A: I -- I was feeling -- the fact that I was Jewish, you know, I was different than -- I -- I had\nsome non-Jewish friends, but very few, very few. Most of my friends were Jewish, and\nwe -- for instance, I\u2019d mentioned to you sports clubs. We had a Harpoyle and a Macarbie,\nthese were two s -- Jewish sports clubs. And sometimes we participated in -- in soccer\ngames where there was a representation of our town, then they were from the Polish\nsports clubs, and from our clubs. But I always -- we always felt that we are Jewish.",
        "Q: No matter what.",
        "A: We always felt that we are Jewish.",
        "Q: When you had non-Jewish friends, did you discuss your differences, or was this simply\nnot going to be a --",
        "A: Well, no, we discussed it, but let me say this to you. We -- first of all, we kind of felt that\nwe are intellectually superior to -- that -- you know, the object of study and working hard\nto learn more, was more, you know, in the province of Jewish life, because Jews always\naimed for being more educated, because Jews felt that the only way, the only thing that\nwill bring them into society is, you know, by being educated well, or being better\neducated. You know, for instance, for a Jew to be accepted to high school, he had to have\nmuch better grades, and had to be much better prepared than a non-Jew. So th -- are you\nasking me whether they were killing Jews every day? No. You know, we li --",
        "Q: Well but -- yeah -- no, go ahead.",
        "A: We lived in our town, we knew that we are different, we -- first of all, we knew that we\nare different, we had to be different because wi -- I couldn\u2019t eat, you know, because my --\nmy -- my parents would know that I had dinner with my non-Jewish friend in their house,\nthey would be heartbroken.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you find that difficult, that you wanted to eat in the house of your friend\nbecause you liked them?",
        "A: I wanted to be the same --",
        "Q: The same, yeah.",
        "A: -- I did not like the fact that we were identified as them.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I wanted to -- there to be us. And it was a gradual process.",
        "Q: Right. Did you -- when you had non-Jewish friends, were they good friends?",
        "A: I recall two that were good friends, good friends, and I am certain that inasmuch as they\ncould have had problems of -- of us being friends, they were my friends. There were\nbullies that were looking for an opportunity to get a Jewish kid, you know, on the way\nhome from school, and beat him up, or push him, or bully him and what have you. They\nwould probably come to my help.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you get trained in sort of -- what do you call it, not fighting --",
        "A: Self defense?",
        "Q: Self defense, yes.",
        "A: Well, we had Jewish sports clubs, and bear in mind that this is what I\u2019ve been trying to\nbring out to you, that I lived in a period where young people desired to leave the beta\nmidrash, the yeshiva and to enter into modern schooling, you know, so in -- as a result of\nthis, we felt that we need to do everything that modern life has. Be active in sports, be\nactive in theater, be active in -- in debates, be active in -- in -- in discussions, and what\nhave you. So, as a result of this, what I\u2019m trying to bring out is that in the sports clubs,\nyes we studied self defense. You know, not karate or something like it, but first of all, we\nwere educated. You know, our organizational leaders. Don\u2019t let yourself, don\u2019t -- don\u2019t --\ndon\u2019t accept the fact that you are less, lesser, or weaker, or -- and what have you. And\nthen the immigration to Israel began when I grew up, and my brother, my youngest\nbrother, Jonah --",
        "Q: Jonah, right.",
        "A: -- who is here, after he served in the army, in the Polish army, because this was army in s\n-- serving in the army was by conscription. Right after he finished, he decided that he\nwants to go to Israel. And this for my parents was a big problem, because they went to\nthe rabbe, and the rabbe said, \u201c\u201cWhen the here will come, when the Messiah will come,\nwe'll all go to Israel.\u201d You know, my -- for instance, there were people who suggested to\nmy parents, you know, because as I mentioned to you, we were rather -- substantially,\nyou know, comfortable, wealthy, that we should buy a large parcel of land, or a building\nin Jerusalem. So it was customary in those days, that the Jews didn\u2019t do anything without\nsharing 1t with a rabbe -- not a rabbi, the rabbe. Do you know the distinction between one\nand the other? A rabbi --",
        "Q: How would you dis --",
        "A: A rabbi -- a rabbi is a rabbi, a roof. A functionary in the community. The rabbe was the\nhead of the dynasty, of the rabbinic dynasty, this, you know [indecipherable]. So any\nmajor decision that Jews had to make, you know, like, you know, going abroad with, you\nknow, with a major investment, usually my father, or whoever it would be, would go to\nthe rabbe, and ask for a brucha, ask for a blessing, you know? And ask for his advice.\nAnd when my father came to the rabbe to tell him that Jonah wants to go to Israel, and\nthere are friends that are advising our parents to invest a substantial amount of money in\nIsrael -- in Palestine in those days, not Israel. So, the rabbe\u2019s answer -- the rabbe\u2019s answer\nwas, when Messiah will come, we will all go to Israel. Right now we should stay here,\nand we should serve God in a -- in a pious manner.",
        "Q: But in spite of that, your brother left in 1934?",
        "A: Yes, he was the strongest revolutionary in the family.",
        "Q: Was he?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: But that -- was that hard for you when he left? You were 14 years old.",
        "A: I missed him.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I missed him very much. He was, you know, he was part of the aggressively, you know,\naggressive group that were asserting themselves, to make their way into modern society,\nand to accepting new ways. And most of all, going to Palestine, and building a -- you\nknow, a State.",
        "Q: Did he also f -- do you think that he believed that anti-Semitism was only going to get\nworse, that he couldn\u2019t live a life in [indecipherable]",
        "A: There ne -- there was no discussion about that. Everybody recognized it, including my\nparents, including people that -- my parents equals. We all recognized that anti-Semitism\nis escalating, and it\u2019s going to get worse, and something needs to be done. But no one, no\none, in his wildest dreams, has any idea what is coming.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you think about going?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: To follow your brother?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Yes, as a matter of fact, I started in junior college, a Hebrew junior college in\nLvov, and my aim was to go to the University of Jerusalem to continue studies.",
        "Q: So when you gra -- you graduated high school, obviously --",
        "A: It -- it -- well, bear in mind, it was the -- I had --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- high school, but the -- the school that I am talking about was a junior college, a Hebrew\njunior college, which was a combination of the -- of the leedselm, you know what\nleedselm is? The le -- this is the last two years of high school, and college.",
        "Q: So you left Hamishov --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The last two years of high school --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- to go to Lvov?",
        "A: Right, right. And then came --",

        "Q: \"36.",
        "A: \"35 -- 36.",
        "Q: Right. And where did you live in Lvov? Why Lvov anyway\u2019?",
        "A: Lvov was one of the largest cities.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it was a beautiful city, and my father\u2019s sister lived in Lvov, and they were -- when I,\nyou know, convinced them that I want to go to Lvov, and I want to study in Lvov, they\ncame to realize that they are fighting a | -- a losing battle. They didn\u2019t admit it, but they --\nthey realized it. So they figured at least let me be well educated, and you know, let\u2019s pick\nthe best of what is coming. And he had a sister in Lvov, so I lived with his sister, with an\naunt of mine.",
        "Q: So was this a -- a new awakening too, to be able to be in such a large city like that?",
        "A: Oh yes, it --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- ma -- made a major impact on me. It was a cultural city, and it was a large city, and\nyou know, in the youth, it was a wonderful youth. There were wonderful Jewish\norganizations, and I was -- I was very, very fortunate that I spent two years in\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It contributed a lot to the shaping of me as a young man.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about social relations between boys and girls, and -- and what was that\nlike growing up, was there --",
        "A: Again, I must repeat that this was a transitional period.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And some of the people, you know, participated in it -- some of the young people, and\nsome of the young people didn\u2019t. But by and large, we were the avant-garde. For\ninstance, I was a member of the Shamare Atsyere. Shamare Atsyere was a leftist, you\nknow, very progressive organization, but intellectual. You know, they -- we -- hebr --\nknowing Hebrew was a must, otherwise you couldn\u2019t be a member of this organization.\nAnd they were to -- you know, my friends, boys and girls, you know, we -- whatever we\nwere unable to do at home, you know, and I mean the lifestyle, and even the reading, you\nknow, and what have you, it all took place in the organization, the organization shaped\nthe youth, you know. And it was -- it was a small town, but a small town that had all the\naspects of a developing community with -- in -- in -- in every manner. It -- it -- the -- to\ngive you some silly examples, there were two cars in our community. Two cars that were\nprivately owned. There were 30 telephones. 30 telephones in the entire community. And -\n- but there were many very fine institutions. For instance, there was a -- a loan society\nthat didn\u2019t charge interest.",
        "Q: Oh, loan.",
        "A: A loan society.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: To help people, you know, if they needed a transition from a difficult period. And this\nwas a wonderful institution. There was a Jewish bank, you know, that it was more of a --\nit was a bank, it -- it functioned as a bank, and it charged interest, but it was more a\nbeneficial society, you know. And so there were all kinds of organizations in town. There\nwere the -- you know, the typical divisions between the Betar, the Shabotinsky group,\nand Shamare Atsyere. You know, we were f -- yo -- the -- constantly fighting with one\nano -- not physically fighting, but discussing, and you know, and trying to mobilize and\nget more of the young people into our organization than into the other -- it was a major\nissue, you know. Where the one was a Revisionist, you know, Betar, over the one\n[indecipherable] Shamare Atsyere, it was a haloots, you know. All the organizations.",
        "Q: And when you would sit and argue, what would be the major portions of the argument?",
        "A: The major por -- is the ideology of -- you know, of how we should conquer Palestine,\nand should -- should it be -- the Shabotinsky was a -- you know, a fabulous orator, and he\nfelt that, you know, the only way how to do it is by training Jewish youth to be physically\nable, and capable of handling weapons, and -- and what have you. And prepare like th --\nfight like the rest of the world is fighting. The Zionist organizations felt that 1t was an\nintellectual process. We need to educate young people, you know, we need to take them\naway from the Hassidic ways and methods of living, and bring them in -- into modern --\ninto, you know, Jewish philosophical debate, Jewish, you know, readings, Jewish\nclassics. Bear in mind that the Yiddish culture, the Yiddish [indecipherable] came to be\nwithin a period of, I would say 50 years, 60 years. You know, when you talk about\nShalomar [indecipherable] Farin -- are -- these names mean anything to you? You know,\nthese -- they all --",
        "Q: What\u2019s the last name that you --",
        "A: Mandolere Mochais Farin.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That -- he was one of the early ones, even before Shalomar Lachin, you know. So it was -\n- it was a -- a transformation in the making.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, and I was very fortunate that I lived in that time, because it was a very\ncreative period. It -- you know, 50 years before that, there were no questions asked. A\nyoung man needed to go to the Yeshiva and sit, and study, and -- and be pious, and wear\nthe same attire that, you know, Jews were wearing. Not us. You know, we were already --\nwe were rebelling, and -- and I'll tell you a joke which will be reflective of this. Our way\nof demonstrating that we are progressive was, for instance, to walk around without hats,\nyou know. Not to have a cover. But you never dared to do it in the presence of your\nfather or your mother, because you would hurt them terribly. So I remember once\nwalking with a friend of mine on the -- you know, on the -- on -- on the street, and neither\none of us wore a hat, you know, because this was our way of expressing our rebellion.\nAnd suddenly his father came across, he didn\u2019t expect him, and he saw him without a hat.\nSo he says, \u201cWhy are you walking around without a hat, with a,\u201d -- you know, \u201cwith a\nbare head?\u201d So he said, \u201cI\u2019m hot.\u201d So he says, \u201cIf you\u2019re hot, why don\u2019t you take off your\npants?\u201d But it was a transitional period, and many of the young people of our town got\ninvolved in Zionist organizations. Quite a few went to Palestine, including of my brother,\nyou know. And some of them became very, very active in Jewish defense. Some of them\nbecame very active in Hagganah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Including of my brother.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. And they were the ones that prepared Palestine to be able to accept the\nimmigration of -- after -- after the war of -- you know, after the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Now, your brother didn\u2019t come back and forth, he -- he remained --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- once he left, he remained there.",
        "A: He remained there.",
        "Q: Yeah. One more small -- small question. Did you start dating when you were a teenager?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Yes --",
        "A: Oh, very much so.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah, that was part of the rebelling, you know, we were -- we were a group of kids, you\nknow, nice kids, good kids, and absolutely, in the dating, and -- and going steady, and\nkissing, and hugging, and -- and what have you.",
        "Q: Yes? You went steady?",
        "A: Oh sure.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Sure, absolutely.",
        "Q: So this wa -- it wasn\u2019t just groups of kids being together, you were actually --",
        "A: It -- it --",
        "Q: -- focused on the one person --",
        "A: -- it was being together --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- it was kids being together, but in the being together, it\u2019s like young people, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Without any question. I mean, we -- I would say that it was -- beginning with my\nbrother\u2019s generation, it was a constant transition from the old Hassidic, pious, you know,\nvery restricted manner, that the progress was made on opening the windows, and letting\nin fresh air.",
        "Q: So -- so there was sexual experimentation as well --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- which would have been somewhat different.",
        "A: Yes, yes it was.",
        "Q: Do you think Jewish young women, as well as young boys, or was more so among the\nboys you had --",
        "A: No, Jewish young women and boys, that -- well, le-le-let me say this -- this to you, if you\nare referring to promiscuity, you -- if you -- if you went with a girl steady, you didn\u2019t\nwant her to --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want to have sex.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: You may have desired it, but you know, if she was going to be your steady, you wanted\nher to be pure.",
        "Q: I see, and you -- I see. That\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: So the dating was more in school, with non-Jewish girls, and --",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: -- no dates, but --",
        "Q: But -- sexual experimentation --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- would be with non-Jewish girls?",
        "A: Right. Very, very seldom it happened with a Jewish girl. You know, th -- the -- these\nthings were taken seriously, it -- again, 1t depends when we are talking about. Are we\ntalking 1920, are we talking 1930?",
        "Q: Well, 1920 you were a baby.",
        "A: I was a baby.",
        "Q: So we\u2019re talking the 30\u2019s for you --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- not what --",
        "A: There is no question about it that by the time I grew up, and I was, let\u2019s say 15 - 16 years\nold, that our town, like many other towns were on a rapid path of transition.",
        "Q: Of a certain kind of modernization?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s -- 1-1t\u2019s -- there\u2019s something t -- is painfully ironic about all of this, because here\nthe world seems to be changing in some radical ways, opening up to a kind of modern\nworld, and then there is this huge machine of death that comes in the midst of it. It\u2019s so --",
        "A: We didn\u2019t expect this.",
        "Q: Of course not.",
        "A: No one --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- no one expected it. Bear in mind that, you know, the -- the history was that Germany,\nin first World War, has occupied our -- the town where I lived. They -- they ran\noccupational force, but there was nothing, you know, that they would do to -- nothing.\nAnd another thing, the fighting -- the fighting took place on the front line. Once the front\nline moved 10 -- 10 kilometers, or 20 kilometers, that was the end of the fighting. So\ninstead of having the Russian -- the Russian police, or Polish police -- you know, you had\nGerman police, but --",
        "Q: No different.",
        "A: And -- but in 19 -- [indecipherable] let me say this to you, I mean, we all had radios, we\nordered newspapers, and we knew that in 1933, when Hitler came to power, that terrible\nthings are happening in -- in Germany. Terrible things are happening in Germany. In\nPoland, the Poles aped, you know, many of the things that were happening in Germany.\nThey started implementing laws, which were outright anti-Semitic. For instance, Jewish\nstudents that were in college, could not sit on the benches with the Poles, they had to be\non the left side. And those who didn\u2019t want to be on the left side, stood in the back. You\nknow, there were constant fights for, you know, equal rights, and -- and what have you.\nPoland was in the process of becoming a very, very anti-Semitic country.",
        "Q: Was -- did -- so there was a great deal of nationalism, and a great deal of fascism that was\nbeginning to grow --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- in Poland in a way that you hadn\u2019t experienced before.",
        "A: It -- well, bear in mind that -- you know, that it -- the love for Jews was never there. You\nknow, if -- for instance, if you are talking about Poland was occupied, as you know from\nhistory, by Russia, Germany, and Austria. Austria was the only -- the only area where\nthey were liberal and progressive, and they treated the Jews very well, and gave them\nopportunity to enter schools, and study. The Russian occupation was very, very\noppressive. You know, the -- in the [indecipherable] they were, you know. And the\nGermans not as much, but w -- the Germans that we remembered were not Germans that\nwe were afraid of, but when you started seeing what Hitler is predicting, you know, and\nwe read Mein Kampf, and we knew --",
        "Q: You did? You read it?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: You read it in Polish or in German?",
        "A: Polish.",
        "Q: In Polish.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what did you think?",
        "A: It was frightening. We knew that terrible things are coming.",
        "Q: Did you actually read it from cover to cover?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: No, but you know, major excerpts --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- and what have you.",
        "Q: So did you, in your groups --",
        "A: Discuss.",
        "Q: -- you discussed this?",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Q: And -- and were there people who thought that there was going to be a war, do you think?\nDo you remember?",
        "A: Well, as far as war is concerned, yes we saw -- if -- 1t depends when. If you are talking,\nfor instance in 1934 - 1935, Hitler started his expansionary programs, you know, and he\nentered -- in 1938 he entered Austria, and he occupied Czechoslovakia, and\n[indecipherable] you know, from the French. It -- it was all coming, and it was coming\nrapidly, and it was very scary. But you want to know something? You just don\u2019t pick\nyourself up and go.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t that easy.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: In particular in those days. You know, some people, for instance, I met them after the\nwar, and I asked them, did they went in Palestine? Why did you leave? He said, \u201cWe\nknew what was coming. We knew that we have to build an independent home for the,\u201d --\nyou know, \u201cfor the -- the Jews.\u201d But on the other hand, in many cases people were, let\u2019s\nsay, the only one, and they were parents, they were not well, and what have you. Picking\nyourself up and leaving, and uprooting yourself is a major issue.",
        "Q: Right. Even for a very wealthy family.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did your brother write and say get out of there?",
        "A: My brother was pleading. First of all, he -- he was more sensitive to the fact what\u2019s\ncoming, because the German Jews started coming into Israel.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So he was more aware of it. There were Polish Jews that lived in Germany that were\npushed over the border, in the boneshin --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- for instance, you know there was a -- so for me to tell you that the onslaught of Nazism\ncame unexpectedly, I don\u2019t think I would be telling you actual conditions.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was coming in that we saw it coming, but none of us, none of us had any idea about\ntotal annihilation. We felt we are going to have a bad time, we are gonna be in for a very\ndifficult period, you know, something like, you know, the [indecipherable] in the end of\nthe 19\" century, maybe worse, you know. Believe it or not, but we were preconditioned\nto the fact that for one reason or another, destiny has designated a lot of suffering and\nstruggling for us, you know. And it -- it was a difficult time, but I don\u2019t want to talk to\nyou generalities, I want to talk to you specifics. Specifics is that in spite of all this, you\nknow, life had to go on, life had to function. And the community had -- it -- it was a\nmicrocosm. Tom -- Tomashev was a microcosm of the larger being.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: For instance, if you talk about Wilno, Wilno had a very, very active, you know, cultural\nJewish life, and you know, poets, and writers, you know, came out of there, 1t was that\nway. Wilno was described as Jerusalem of Lithuania. Or you talk about Warsaw. Warsaw\nwas the capital of Poland. And you also had the emergence of a labor organized\nmovement, a Jewish labor movement, the Bund, and the Communist party. The\nCommunist party consisted -- members of the Communist party came from different walk\nof life, they came from poor working class, came from very rich. Some of my very dear\nfriends, you know, and our parents were dear friends, they were members of the\nCommunist party. But it was a small group. The biggest group was the Bund. These were\nthe Jewish unions, so to say, unions.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, that became part of a -- an organization. The Bund was not in favor of\nbuilding a home in Israel, the Bund was in favor of establishing our presence, and our\nlife, and our privileges in Poland, in th -- Lithuania, in Czechoslovakia, and they played a\nmajor role, because they did more than -- than -- than expressed -- you know formulated,\nyou know, ad -- and advocated the policy of fighting for our rights. They gave the Jewish\nlaborers a sense of pride, a sense of being something special, of being organized as a\nunion. It -- it [indecipherable] and, you know, Medem was the leader of the Bund, but\nthere were poets and writers, that were very much in favor of th -- very much siding, like\n[indecipherable] for instance, siding with the philosophy of the Bund, that we have to\nfight for our rights, for our existence in Poland. And there were designers that figured\nthat we are wasting our time, that the ti -- the place where to go and concentrate our\nefforts is Palestine, because this is the land -- you know, Hertzel was earlier, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But these were successions, and you know, it -- so what I\u2019m trying to say to you,\neverything that I am talking to you about, did not happen from the beginning of the year\nto the end of the year.",
        "Q: Right, right.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. I was a Zionist. The basic difference between the Bund, and the Zionist movement is\nthe Bund, A was a labor organization. Fought religion, because they felt that religion 1s --\nis opium for the masses. This used to be the slogan. And they fought -- they tried to ally\nthemselves with Socialists, and -- pol -- Polish Socialists, which were on the\n[indecipherable] there was an organization of Polish Socialists, and they tried to align\nthemselves with them. But if you ask me whether they were many wealthy Jewish people\nthat became part of the Bund, perhaps. You know, it -- it wa -- this wasn\u2019t a matter of\nwealth or poverty. By and large, you know, the Jewish people in Poland were poor\npeople.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: They were a small percentage, you know, that emerged as people of substantial wealth.\nWas there a middle class? Perhaps, but --",
        "Q: Not big.",
        "A: No, and -- and it -- the middle class that we are talking about is a pitiful middle class.\nMiddle class is where, you know, they scratched out a living, you know, and perhaps\nmaybe a little more, but by and large, the Jews were not wealthy.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: By and large as I described it to you, until the changes started coming about, the husband\nwas the one that was -- saw himself as the scholar, and he needs to study the Bible, and --\nand sit, and go to services three times a day, and -- and what have you. And the woman\nwas the one that sit in the marketplace, and sell some beans, or -- or -- or vegetables, or --",

        "A: -- or you know, herring, and a -- it -- it -- it was politic.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you one -- one more question for this section. When you went to Lvov to\ngo to school, what -- what were you studying, what did you think at this point if the w --\nif your dad hadn\u2019t died, and you didn\u2019t go back home, what would you have done?",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, won some compromises from our parents. Our parents were very, very war -\n- religious, very religious. But smart, and worldly. They knew that the direction is. They\nrefused to accept it, but they knew that the direction is going the way we are going, you\nknow, to blend in, but no-not to get mixed in with society, but to be able that 1 -- study\nthe language. There were many Jews that spoke a very broken Polish.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, a very broken Polish. And this was, no way, we -- we felt even if to stay in\nPoland, we must be part and parcel of the community as such. We must have our\nrepresentatives in parliament, we must educate our children in -- in we -- there\u2019s one\nthing I will want to tell you, that the Jews of the -- of Poland, and of Lithuania, had a\ntremendous sense for social justice. As I mentioned to you, they were loan -- a society to\nfree -- a loan free -- interest free society. They were, in those days, to give you another\nexample, they were -- to help a Jewish girl find a husband and get married was a big\nmitsveh. My mother was known that she always tries to find a match, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And she arranged the wedding.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: She arranged the wedding. But it was a sense of social justice, a sense of helping people.\nAnd this was not only my mother, there were all, you know, many people in town that did\nthat. There were many -- there were many customs there that need to be understood. For\ninstance, there were beggars that were going from town to town and stopped, and asked\nfor a fenegar, or a few pennies, and what have you. Friday night, they came to\nsynagogue. It was an established custom that the synagogue -- th -- the people that belong\nto the synagogue cannot go home without taking a noyrech, which means a guest. And --\nand he was seated at a table, you know, and he had Shabbas with us. Th-This was a very,\nvery noble thing to do. There was a place, it was called the hagdish. A hagdish was a\nplace -- a poor -- a -- a -- a -- a poorhouse, where these traveling beggars, you know,\nwhen they came, could come in and they got a bundle of straw, you know, and they could\nSleep. They didn\u2019t pay anything for it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: This was done by the cultural society of the community, and by the gemeni, which was\nthe organized Jewish society, you know? We were of sorts, we always had a certain\ndegree of self rule, you know, between ourselves.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: To give you an example of self rule, if there was a dispute between two Jewish people,\nbetween two Jewish businessmen or what have you, it was customary not to go to court,\nbut to go to a dintorah. They went to a -- to a rabbi -- not a rabbe, a rabbi, this was the\nfunctioning, and they both presented their case, and -- and he pass judgment, and\nwhatever the judgment was, this was it. So what I\u2019m trying to say to you 1s, in the small\ntowns, and I\u2019m talking about Tomashev as a microcosm because the same thing applied\nto Zamosc, and it applied to Lublin, depending how large it was, and what particular part\nof economic life is in one place. If there were a lot of forests, there were sawmills, if\nthere was a lot of --",

        "A: Of sorts, yes. First of all, 1t was a junior college, where Hebrew was a very major part of\nit. And the arrangement was that one who graduated junior college in Lvov, gained a year\nin the university, could enter on the second year of the university immediately. So this\nwas of sorts a program to make it easier for students who intended to study in the\nJerusalem University. It was cheaper, it was easier, they didn\u2019t have to leave home.

        "A: Because, you see, my going to Israel was a two fold one. Number one, I wanted the\neducation, you know, as a Jew, because my brother influenced me a lot, and as a young\nman, when I look back today, I was a very -- he -- he -- he educated me. He brainwashed\nme, if you want to use this terminology. And I was a very ardent believer in th -- in -- in\nthe Jews have no choice, this is the only way, is to go to Israel, to Palestine, and build a\nhome. A -- a Jew -- build a Jewish homeland.

Now, I -- I\u2019m ke\n-- I\u2019m coming back to the Tomashev, and I ke -- use the terminology t -- a microcosm.\nTomashev was a very vibrant community, I have very fond memories of it, in every\npossible way. The fact that, you know, the doors opened for me, you know, culturally,\nhistorically, intellectually. I didn\u2019t sense it at that time. At that time I was excited with the\nissue of the day.

They were people that were bitter, and\nas a result of this became bitter with their children. They were bitter they had poverty,\nthey were bitter on their, you know, being persecuted as Jews, they were bitter that they\ndidn\u2019t marry right, because this was not a time where marriage was, you know, by a boy\nfinding a girl, 1t was matchmaking. All these things, you know, had played a role in how\nthe community functions. But I must tell you that my recollections of the community are\nvery good, because when I look back at it, you know, and I look at all these things, you\nknow, like making sure that no Jewish girl remains an alteh moid, an -- an old maid. You\nknow, very nice. It affected -- there was a poor house where a person could go in and go\nto sleep without any questions. Very nice, you know. It -- it -- 1t affected Friday night,\nthat no man could remain without being fed. These are things that, you know, speak to\nyou. They give you the quality, you know. And then I started -- I am coming back to the\nbreakthrough. Reading the poetry, bre -- reading Bialek, read -- reading, you know the\nChonyahofsky. I-It was a new world, and it was an exciting world. I remember we used\nto si -- recite by heart, you know, poems like [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable]\nthe city of Florida, you know, and what have you. So all in all, my recollections of those\nday, taking into consideration the restrictions, the constraints, and the situations as they\nwere, my recollections are good.",

And people walked over, there were usually eight people that\ncarried them. And when he was -- when the -- the body was brought to the cemetery,\nthere were within -- within the grave, there were sideboards, but the Jewish law called for\nthat the body must -- the body must lay on soil. And this conflicted with the laws of\nPoland. The laws of Poland were that you had to be in a box. So what they did is they\nbuilt the -- the sideboards, and then -- and headboards, but before they started covering it,\nthey pulled the boards out. That\u2019s breaking the law, but they d -- what I\u2019m trying to say to\nyou, that a religious law, to Jews, prevailed, always prevailed.",

It was great life,\nwonderful, and I had good friends in school, wonderful, wonderful people I -- you know -",
        "Q: So your life became somewhat smaller again, in a certain way, yes.",
        "A: Absolutely. It -- it -- no, I -- I wouldn\u2019t say it became smaller, because when I came back,\nI was more assertive, and mother recognized that if she wants me, she cannot fight me,\nyou know. So I was very active in working with mother, but I was very active in the\ncommunity. I was active in our -- our sports club was the Harpoyle. I was active in the\nsports club, I was active in Shamere Atsyere, you know, and we -- I brought you some\npictures out -- 1-1t\u2019s amazing, you know. You will see a group of people, you know, like\nyou'd see a group of people here, young ones today, but wonderful, wonderful, and some\nof them are really -- you could sense, you could feel that they are the future leaders of --\nof the -- and -- of the community, or the Jewish people.",
        "Q: Right. Did you like business in some ways?",
        "A: Yes, yes, but I didn\u2019t permit it to swallow me. I liked it very much, but I didn\u2019t permit it\nto swallow me. No, I had a sense for business.",

        "A: If you asking me whether I was the scholarly type, always to -- to live on books, and --\nand -- no, no.",
        "Q: In terms of hearing about what\u2019s going on in Germany, in 1938, in November, there\u2019s\nKristallnacht, there\u2019s The Night of Broken Glass.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You heard about this. Was there any repercussions in Poland, where you were?",
        "A: As I told you before, first of all, Poland itself was in an escalating process of anti-\nSemitism. The leader of the Polish government, who was most benevolent, was Pilsudski,\nand after he died, the right wing organizations took the upper hand in Parliament, and\ntook the upper hand in the country. And you know, again the same story. They were\nafraid of Germany as much as we did. And their fear expressed itself by finding victims,\nyou know, by looking for scapegoats. And anti-Semitism escalated substantially, very\nsubstantially. And these were not good days in Poland.",
        "Q: Was there any kind of pogrom right after Kristallnacht?",
        "A: There was -- there was a pogrom in Pshittik.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: One pogrom, but Jews resisted. The Jews resisted, but there was a pogrom, and one Jew\ngot killed there.",
        "Q: But in Tomashev?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. But, for instance, it was customary before the boys went to the army, they had to go\nand, you know, be checked out whether they\u2019re healthy, whether they\u2019re suitable,\nwhether they\u2019re fitted. So the boys from Tomashev, and the surrounding areas used to\ncome and this was kind of like a -- a bachelor\u2019s party, you know, so they went into the\nliquor stores, and bought liquor, got drunk and started beating up Jews. We in Tomashev\ndidn\u2019t take too kindly to it, so we organized -- even my brother, in his youth, you know,\norganized defense. And when they started beating up Jews, next time the Jews were\nprepared for it, and they got their portion, and they\u2019d stopped it. So it was a normal,\nongoing life. It wasn\u2019t all peaches and cream, it wasn\u2019t all wonderful things. There were,\nyou know difficulties, there were sadness in it. But also, health. I\u2019m not talking about\nphysical health, I\u2019m talking commununal health.",
        "Q: Was there talk about war, about Germany attacking Poland in \u201938 - 39?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Because first of all, Czechoslovakia was invaded already. Austria was invad --\nnot invad -- invaded -- invaded by -- invited, but invaded. So 1-1t was clear, without any\nquestion in Hitler, you know, Hitler and Goebbels, you know what they are, remarks,\npublic -- public addresses, they talked about expansion, you know, labensurround, which\nmeans they needed space to expand, you know, to be able to live, and to allow the -- the\nThird Reich, which they were hoping that will last a thousand years, to establish itself,\nnot -- th-the -- there -- the signals -- the signs were there, without any question. The signs\nwere there that we are heading for bad times, but no one -- no one had any inkling of\nwhat was coming. I\u2019m talking about a massive annihilation.",
        "Q: Did the -- did the Polish government say we can defeat the -- I mean, was -- was there a\nkind of propaganda, yes?",
        "A: There was empty talk, sure, sure. I remember two days before the Germans invaded\nPoland they were -- you know, there was a dispute over Dansik. Dansik was a -- a free\ncity, you know, that was near -- it was a port city, a free city. So you could see young\nPoles going on the streets, we will smother them with our helmets, we will throw the\nhelmets at them. You know, empty talk, you know, bravado, and what have you. But we\nrealized that we are dealing with a formidable enemy. It was an enemy -- to describe it to\nyou, the Poles had cavalry. You know, riding, you know --",
        "Q: Horses, right.",
        "A: Horses. And good cavalry, a good army, but this cavalry had to fight tanks. How does\ncavalry fight tanks, you know, so --",
        "Q: At what age wer -- was one s -- wer-were boys supposed to be conscripted, 18?",
        "A: No, 21.",
        "Q: Ah, 21. So you were not at that point yet.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Fortunately. So what\u2019s the first experience of war in 1939 for you, do you remember?",
        "A: Well, it was -- it came unexpectedly. I -- I mean there were -- you know, that -- feuds --\nthere were the discussions, and -- and the Polish minister Farnafayas, who went to Berlin\nto try to negotiate something, and they would have -- in my opinion they would have\nbeen very good collaborators. The way the -- th -- it prevailed at that time, the Socialist\nparty is, among Poles, weakened. The -- the extreme right party got stronger, and you\nasked me what was the first impact of war? Totally unexpected air raids, killing and\nburning. Killing and burning, you know, homes. Our home was burned the second day of\nthe war.",
        "Q: Wow. And where were you?",
        "A: I was at that time, when the war broke out, the biggest problem was to get gasoline, you\nknow, to have -- so we had -- the Polish army retreated, and there was -- two officers\nwere in Poland with a car. And I made them an offer, because in our business, we also\nhad a wholesale business of gasoline. It\u2019s like [indecipherable] you know, everything of\n[indecipherable]. We had many businesses.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we have gasoline, and we had it stored in a warehouse. I offered them, you know, to\nfill up their car, and to take four or five containers, and I should go with them, and they\nwere -- they -- they backed up without realizing that from the other side, the Soviet Union\nwill come in, you know. So I was not home, and I came home a few days later, and all of\nPoland was occupied already. And I found Mother. The house was burned. A major -- the\nstore was burned, and the whole city was badly damaged. Two of my colleagues that I\ngrew up with were killed in the bombardment, you know. It was sporadic bombardment\nthat -- not that there was any specific reason to bombard Tomashev. It was not a -- you\nknow, a military center or anything, it was a community.",
        "Q: Right. Do you remember your -- your impression as this young person, who\u2019s lived a\nrather privileged life in many ways, coming back into --",
        "A: I was very shaken, very shaken. Very scared. And I know one thing, that I will not stay\nwith the Germans. So I moved forward -- because I came back, I told you, when I w-went\nwith these officers. And at that time, when the Soviet army came in, a good many people\nlooked to them as liberators, because, you know, they -- they were talking about freedom\nof the individual, and no anti-Semitism, you know, that it\u2019s against the law to be anti-\nSemitic and what have you. So we truly believed that, you know, they are the defenders\nof right, and good, and so I went to Lvov, because Lvov was the city where I studied, and\nI -- I knew the city. And I took mother with me to Lvov, and then my sister came, and\nthen my brother came. So it was turmoil, it was turmoil. Our town was occupied by the\nGermans. In our town, the border between the occupation that wa -- they carved up\nPoland into two half, was about 20 miles south of -- of our town. So, my mother and my\nsister left Tomashev because it was burned down, and they were, in the beginning when\nthey came in, they killed a few Jews, just without any reason. So the signals were bad,\nand we felt that being with Russians is going to be, you know, a way of surviving, not\nhaving all these things in a Communist regime, but surviving.",
        "Q: Now, Lvov is about what, 120 kilometers?",
        "A: More or less, yes.",
        "Q: From Tomashev.",
        "A: From Tomashev.",
        "Q: So how did you go from one to the other, and what did you take, one place to the other?",
        "A: Took nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing?",

        "Q: Because the place had burned down.",
        "A: You know, sure. I c -- I think my -- my older brother, Shlomo, gave me some of his\nclothing, because where he lived, and my sister Peshe lived, this was not bombarded, so\nthey remained. And I got some clothing from them, and I -- and I went, and I took\nMother with me.",
        "Q: And how did you go, you walked?",
        "A: Partially walked, and partially on -- on trucks, you know. It -- it -- because the military,\nthe -- the Soviet military units were only about eight miles from us. So the minute we got\ninto Ravaruska, which was the next town, you know, the -- no, there was a small one,\nLubicha, a small one in between. But Ravaruska was already a town more or less the size\nof ours, maybe a little bigger. And there we had people that -- customers, they used to\nbuy from us, and -- and what have you. So, it wasn\u2019t in two [indecipherable] so to say.\nWe got into Ravaruska, and to catch our breath, and collect our senses, and from there I\nsaid to Mother, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Lvov, because this 1s a large city, and we\u2019ll be able to\nfunction better.\u201d",
        "Q: Now I know this is going to sound stupid, but do you have money? Do you have banks in\nother towns other than Tomashev? I mean what are you -- you\u2019re coming into a place\nwhere the --",
        "A: The only thing what we -- what -- the -- the -- the question is a good question, no we\ndidn\u2019t, because whatever was it -- in -- in -- in our home, including, you know, jewelry\nand what have you, this all burned down. The jewelry, I think, was found by somebody\nand they refused to rec -- to admit that they found it. And mother and I came in with\npractically nothing. But how did we survive? In Lemberg -- in Lvov, there were several\nfactories that we bought stuff from them. There was a candy factory that we bought\ncandy from them. There was a factory of lachmas, which 1s a blue color that you put into\n-- into whitewash, you know, to paint houses. So, at that time, b-before the Russians\nestablish themselves, there was an in between period, a hiatus. So the fact that we dealt\nwith them, and we knew them -- so they gave us s-some of the m -- some of the\nmanufactured goods at hard cost prices from before the war. And this was the war, and\neverything jumped a thousandfold. So in -- we -- this gave us a good start, and we have\nmanaged to establish ourselves.",
        "Q: So they gave it to you on a loan because you didn\u2019t have anything to --",
        "A: Sure, we didn\u2019t have anything.",
        "Q: -- obviously, so then you paid it off.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: But the object was to get it and to take it out from the factory, because as [indecipherable]\nthe factory [indecipherable] 10 times as much.",

        "A: Mother had friends, but I am trying -- I am thinking what to tell you. Mother had friends,\nbut these were not friends that they went to play golf, or you know. These were friends\nthat were similar in -- in -- you know, in their -- 1n their religious -- in the degree of their\nreligiosity. Friends that, you know, that were also at least middle class, you know, at least\nmiddle class, with whom they had something in common, you know, and -- neighbors,\nyou know. Are you asking me whether there was an organized Jewish social life for\nreligious women? Not quite. Not quite. Fr-Free time was for prayer, for -- for study, and\nyou know. And there wasn\u2019t any free time. There wasn\u2019t any free time.",
        "Q: Right, because you had to work so hard.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- in, you know, some as I told you were killed, you know, from the bombardment. Some\nwent into Russia immediately and some remained in pol -- in Lvov. And I had no trouble\nregrouping and finding my friends, and finding some of my friends, and -- and I made\nnew friends, young people made new friends easily. The object was to grow in into a new\nsystem, to a new society. A society that, you know, perfomra advocated, you know,\nwonderful things. But it was far from it. It was far from it. Now, believe it or not, but\nwhen things settled down a little bit, there was many people, many Jews that felt that they\nwant to go back home. Many. They want to go back home, they -- because you know, the\n-- the mass killings didn\u2019t start yet. We are talking \u00b039.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You know, the mass killing -- the actual mass killing started in 41. In between \u201939 and\n41 there were sporadic killings, there were brutalities, there were catching Jews and\ntaking them to work, you know, to dig ditches, and what have you. But there was not the\nonslaught, you know, the -- th-the massive process of annihilation was not there yet, you\nknow.",
        "Q: So there were people who were in Lvov who decided to go back to --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- where the Germans were occupying in Tomashev.",
        "A: Right. And another thing 1s that the Russians suggested to the -- those that came and\nstayed there to take Russian passports. And the Jews didn\u2019t want to take Russian\npassports because they were hoping that, you know, things will straighten out, and they\nwill be able to go home. So the Russians gave them passports with an 11\" paragraph, that\nthis is what it was called. And this is -- 11\" paragraph was a passport of not trustworthy\npeople, that they could not live a hundred kilometers -- less than a hundred kilometers\nfrom the border. And then, after awhile, it was the first massive tran -- ex -- th -- th -- the\nfirst massive transport of Jews from Poland, and Poles from Poland. Poles even more so,\nto Siberia. And my brother and his family were taken to Siberia. My sister Peshe was\ntaken to Siberia. And Mother was on the train already, to be taken to Siberia. But when I\ncame back from work, and I found out what is happening, I went out to the rail station.\nAnd there was a general from the KGB. And I walked over to him, and I say, \u201cI have a\ncomplaint.\u201d You know, general of KGB didn\u2019t know what it means to have a complaint. I\nwas naive, you know. I said I have a complaint, and he said, \u201cWhat is your complaint?\u201d I\nsay, \u201cWhy did you take my mother away?\u201d I am a citizen of Lvov, I have studied in Lvov\nbefore the war, she lives with me, and you have no reason to take her away.\u201d So he\nlooked at me, and looked at me, and he said, \u201cDo you know where she is?\u201d I say, \u201cNo,\nbut I know the transport.\u201d So he went with me, and we knocked in the boxcars, and\ncalling her name. And finally I found the boxcar and I took her out, and took her back\nhome. Of about 120 people that were, you know, e-expedited -- that -- do you know,\nexported, two people came out. One was a grandmother of a officer of the KGB, he\nescaped to Russia 20 years before that, and my mother. And I brought her out, you know,\nto -- she would have survived.",
        "Q: If th -- if she had gone, yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But who was gonna know?",
        "A: Who was know -- who -- who was -- who was to know at that time?",
        "Q: And the -- the -- I think I\u2019m not exactly clear about why these particular people were sent.\nThey were considered to be --",
        "A: They were considered not trustworthy.",
        "Q: Trustworthy people.",
        "A: The excuse was that they are not trustworthy people, and they are taking to Siberia to\nhelp build the -- the Russian effort.",
        "Q: And where --",
        "A: Anyone that -- I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: No, no, go ahead.",
        "A: Anyone that the KGB, or the Encoverdaire, which was called at that time, did not\nconsider trustworthy, you know, for turning the new terrains over into an established\nCommunist regime, were shipped off. Many Poles -- many Poles were shipped off, and --\nand perhaps in a more cruel manner, because these were the former police, the former\njudges, the former -- you know, the Polish intelligentsia. The Soviets felt that the\nintelligentsia is the most dangerous for them, because these are people that, you know,\nare thinking, and -- and they will eventually form resistance organizations, so they felt\nthat the best thing to do 1s to ship them off to Siberia.",
        "Q: Were they actually in box -- in boxcars, or --",
        "A: Boxcars.",

        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- necessary -- you know, for physical needs and what have you.",
        "Q: So all of this must have been just crazy, maybe --",

        "Q: And you were working where, in the railroad?",
        "A: I was working at -- no, the railroad I was working at a time when the Nazis came in.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: I was in the supply -- in the su -- in s -- in the office of supply, state office of supply.",
        "Q: Ah, for the Russians.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what does that mean, Miles, what does that kind of a job --",
        "A: In Russian it\u2019s called snubjoinya. Subjoinya means to supply.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Where 1-if s -- if a factory -- let\u2019s assume a factory that was manufacturing suits, Ill give\nyou an example, needed the material, they couldn\u2019t buy it directly, they had to go through\nthe state office of supply, they got a material. They needed lining, it was a different story.\nThey needed buttons, it was a different story. The same thing goes for any other. Let\u2019s\nsay food supplies. They had -- everything had to go through the office of supply, it was a\nvery peculiar way of running a -- an economy.",
        "Q: And you were -- what -- what was your job in this?",
        "A: My job, I was like a -- th -- a -- a -- the maseetsala channika -- I\u2019m saying it in Russian, a\n-- a vice chair of a department. A vice -- a vis -- a vice manager -- a -- the assistant\nmanager of a department.",
        "Q: And how did you get this job?",
        "A: I needed the job, and you know, I wanted to do something, you know, that you can use\nyour head a little bit, I wasn\u2019t interested you know, in -- in -- in going out on the farm and\nworking, and what have you. And th-the fact that, you know, they knew that I am\neducated, and I will learn the Russian quickly, th -- they -- they also wanted an educated\ncadre, you know, to work for them, and they wanted an educated cadre which will\npromote, and will help them, you know, implement, you know, the Communist regime.",
        "Q: So your sort of Capitalist background didn\u2019t bother them, 1n this case?",
        "A: No, th -- well, it -- I needed to be careful not to tell them too much about it, because when\nyou went for a job, you needed to apply -- you applied for the job, and you needed to\nwrite your life history.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: This was a common thing, no matter what you did [indecipherable] an application with\nthe life history. They needed to know immediately who you were, you know. So, with the\nlife history, I had trouble.",
        "Q: So you fudged it a little bit.",
        "A: Fudged it. Fudged it.",
        "Q: Right. Now, your mother is also working in some way, or not at all at this point?",
        "A: At this point, y -- b --",
        "Q: -- we're now --",
        "A: -- we are talk about a period where the factories were already nationalized, and it was --\nyou couldn\u2019t get any more. In other words, the -- the -- the -- the gray market period is\ngone, and --",
        "Q: So are we talking 1940 now?",
        "A: We are talking 1940.",

        "Q: Right. Now, yo -- your mother then, her life is really 1 -- in -- more radically changed,\nbecause she doesn\u2019t have work to do. So it\u2019s -- so you\u2019re supporting her.",
        "A: I s -- I was supporting mother, she -- she kept home for me.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: And that -- mother 1 -- for instance, to send packages to my sister and to my brother, you\ncouldn\u2019t do it from Lvov. Don\u2019t ask me why, but you couldn\u2019t do it from Lvov, you had\nto go to Kolomia. And Kolomia was a hundred, 130 kilometers from Lvov. So, for\nMother to send a couple of packages to my sister and to my brother, it was a two day\neffort. You know, get on the train, go to Kolomias, stay in line, send the package, come\nback. So this she did.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: It was not easy.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was a difficult time.",

        "Q: Did you feel comfortable with the Russians, and what they were ch -- what you thought\nthey were trying to do at this time?",
        "A: [ -- I -- I felt comfortable because first of all, bear in mind, I was a product of Shamere\nAtsyere. I was a product of, you know, leftist leanings. And, you know, I did not believe\nthat -- you know, these stories that revealed themself later, that they are so brutal, and\nthey are so, you know, authoritarian, and so if -- so far away from what they were\npreaching. They were preaching one thing and doing another.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t believe it at the time?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Your experience was not that, either.",
        "A: My experience wasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t like this, and you know -- but I knew that they are -- it\u2019s\nnot a liberal system, but it -- to make the comparison between Poland, of what we started,\nyou know, feeling and experiencing, said so the heck with the wealth, and the heck --\nheck with the material comfort. At least here, you know, I am an equal with equals, and\nyou know, I\u2019m doing a good job, and I\u2019m getting compensated, and perhaps later I will be\nupgraded, and so on and so on. So for all practical purposes, I was satisfied.",
        "Q: Were they asking you to join the Communist party? Was there any pressure?",
        "A: Not that easy. Joining the Communist party was not so fast. First of all, 1t -- it was a\ngradual thing. And they -- you needed to prove yourself I -- at your word, and -- at\nmeetings, because on every -- every workstation, there were political meetings, and you\nneeded to stand up, and you know, praise the system, and praise -- praise what\u2019s going\non. Getting into the Communist party was not an easy manner, and I wasn\u2019t too anxious\nfor it. I was still hoping that -- you know, that somehow things will settle down.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Still didn\u2019t think of Germany as a country of mass killers. You know, we figured, you\nknow, we had Pshittik, the pogrom of Pshittik, so they had the -- the -- the Night of the\nBroken Glass. And everybody -- most people believed that the terrible things that you\nheard abo -- from Hitler and from Goering and from Goebbels, that it will blow over.\nHuman nature is such that you look for hope.",

        "Q: Not for that, right. And there\u2019s -- is there talk of -- is Germany going to attack?",
        "A: Yes, there is talk. First of all there is talk that, you know there are sporadic killings, and\nthat the Germans are very brutal. And that the SS is a political party, it\u2019s not a military\nparty, it\u2019s a political party. We heard all these things, and that\u2019s why we felt that being in\nRussia was, you know --",

        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We had -- at that time, if you are talking about 1940, it was a matter of accepting wu --\none of two evils. But this was not an evil, you know. We functioned.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, we were able to, you know, to -- there was a little bit of a gray market, you\nknow, and if there was a possibility to buy something and sell it -- even clothing, you\nknow, that -- there used to be an open market, you know, it\u2019s -- it was called pochawk.\nBut people were selling their own stuff to -- to improve on their living, because --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t earn enough. These were war years, and they were difficult years, but not\nterrible years. The terrible years were in Germany, and Poland, occupied by Germany.",

        "Q: And as a Jewish person, you\u2019re feeling okay?",
        "A: Yes. Qualified, but yes.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s the qualification?",
        "A: The qualification is that we knew that anti-Semitism in particular, you know, in the\ncountry, 1s strong, but we didn\u2019t feel that we are being, you know, that we are in danger.\nAnd mind you, this is in time when the entire -- when the -- the entire Jewish population\nthat it crossed the border either legitimately remained, or was shipped to Siberia.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t look at Siberia as a annihilation place, and it wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: And it wasn\u2019t, right.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t. You know, people that went to Russia, inasmuch as Stalin was a terrible,\nterrible, you know, paranoiac brutal killer, you know, Jews were not mass murdered at\nthat time. They were shipped to Siberia to -- you know, to -- t -- to the slave labor camps,\nand what have you. It was a difficult time, a bad time, but not a horrible time.",
        "Q: Now, since there\u2019s a certain kind of normalization because war is not yet upon you again,\nright, is -- are there theater groups, is there culture --",
        "A: Very much so.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: The cultural life in Lemberg was at it\u2019s height.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh, tremendous. And I must tell you, you know, they were terrible in, you know,\nequipping the army. They were insane in slaughtering off their generals. They\nslaughtered off -- between 1932 and 1940, they slaughtered off the best of generals that\nthey had. Marshall Bleecher, you know. But in spite of this, in arts, opera, ballet,\nfantastic, fantastic. Not good, fantastic.",
        "Q: And were these inexpensive enough so you could go?",
        "A: Very inexpensive.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Very inexpensive. This was one thing. Rent was pennies. Radi -- television was pen --",
        "Q: Theater, movies?",
        "A: Streetcars, pennies, movies, theater. Pennies.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: This was all pennies. Clothing you couldn\u2019t get. Shoes you couldn\u2019t get. But culture,\ntremendous. I mean it.",
        "Q: Yeah. No, no, no, it\u2019s -- it sounds quite wonderful in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, it was exciting for young people, and this was the way young people said hey, so\nwhat is it? And there were even those that said to me, why did you ever -- what was so\nspecial about your parents that you should have have everything, and we had to scrape to\nmake it -- to -- to scratch together a living? And it was an argument.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was an argument. But the Bund, the -- the -- the organization that, you know,\ndeveloped, and educated, and united the -- the working masses of Poland, were\nconsidered enemies of germ -- of -- of Russia. And the two leaders of the Bund\norganization were executed by the Soviets.",
        "Q: Even though they\u2019re pro-worker?",
        "A: Pro-worker, but not Communists. So what I\u2019m trying to say to you 1s, it is very difficult\nin -- today, in normal life, to understand the abnormality of the time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: On one hand I am telling you that I had a fantastic cultural life, and on the other hand,\nyou know, they -- they soldiers were walking around with rags around their feet, because\nthey didn\u2019t have boots.",
        "Q: And how do you understand this disparity? Stupidity?",
        "A: Stupidity. We laughed about it. Stupidity, perhaps the fact that it was poorly organized,\nvery poorly organized. Singing hallelujahs to -- to the party, and to Stalin, were so\nabnormal, so horrendous, so large, and -- and th -- that it -- it -- you could sense that it\u2019s\nphony.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. But it seem -- it seems -- the disparity seems so odd, to be able to organize, and\nhave a whole cultural life for a population, and not be able to organize shoes, unless it\nwas harder to get material.",
        "A: No. It was hard to get material, and people did everything possible to excel in the foy --\nin -- in the field of ballet, athletics, because they got to a -- a -- as -- a very special level.\nThe Soviet Union took care of those that they needed as a picture to the world. Their\nathletes, their -- their singers, their opera singers, their actors. You know, these were th-\nthe ones that they show the world, we are a cultural society, and we are -- but we are\navailing this to the masses, where in your case, you have opera, you have theater, who\ngoes there? The wealthy. The middle class at best.",
        "Q: Right, right. And this transforms something.",
        "A: And they were not wrong with this argument.",
        "Q: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: What they didn\u2019t tell you is that, you know, these were the years where Stalin started\nalready eliminating, you know, his opponents, and he was very paranoid about it, and he\nsaw enemies in everybody and anybody. And, you know, Trotsky was no longer in\nRussia, Trotsky -- Trotsky was killed already, in Mexico. And th-they were the trials, the\ninfamous trials in -- in Russia. But this was in Moscow.",
        "Q: Right. This wasn\u2019t where you were. Alright, I think we should take a break now, and the\nnext tape we'll start with June of 1941.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Miles, wer -- we\u2019re gonna -- we\u2019re gonna go to the war, June 1941 in a moment, but I\nwanted to just go back to your name for a moment, because I realized that this -- and\nthere\u2019s some noise -- at the start of the interview, I didn\u2019t ask you the name with which\nyou were born, which was Shmoil. Can you just give us a sense of sort of a history of this\nchange, from --",
        "A: It\u2019s th -- well, it\u2019s a progression of changes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- my Hebrew name is Shmoil. The pet name for Shmoil is Shmeelek. And then we\ndropped the s and it became Meelek. And from Meelek, when I arrived in the United\nStates, in Ellis Island, and I registered as Meelek, he ask me why don\u2019t you make it\nMiles, and you\u2019re gonna be famous, like Myles Standish. I said, \u201cYou got a deal.\u201d",
        "Q: Myles Standish, huh? Okay.",
        "A: I -- I think Myles Standish is with a y if I\u2019m not mistaken.",
        "Q: Yes, it is, that\u2019s true, it\u2019s different. So he didn\u2019t know how to spell.",
        "A: Probably not.",
        "Q: All right, thank you. 1941, June, the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, and the worst 1s\nabout to come. Where we -- where are you when the Germans attack?",
        "A: I am with my mother in Lemberg, in Lvov, and the attack, it\u2019s totally unexpected, and\nLvov is stunned. And within two days, within two days, the Germans were in Lvov.",
        "Q: And 1s there much -- is there much fighting?",
        "A: And there\u2019s an awful lo -- well, to begin with, there was a lot of -- the order were to\nevacuate anything that you possibly could, including machinery. It was three days, not\ntwo days. And whole factories were loaded on trucks -- on trains, including the workers,\nand send into the depth of rud -- into deep Russia.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. It was turmoil, it was fear, when they were moving so ferociously, and so, you\nknow, w-with bombardments, as I explained to you before, and with heavy artillery, and\nthen they were -- they entered Lvov without damaging anything, because the Poles did\nnot oppo -- not the Poles, the -- the Soviets did not oppose, did not resist -- did not resist\nthe entrance of the -- of the Germans. And the Germans came in and Lvov 1s a city that\nwill go down in infamy because the Ukrainian nationalists implemented the pogrom, and\nit was thousands of Jews that were taken from the street, from the houses, from offices,\nand taking them to the brigitky, which was the jail of -- the famous jail in Lvov, and\nslaughtered. At that time, I was -- this -- this was -- I\u2019m telling you something that\u2019s\nthree, four days already, but not [indecipherable]. And I worked already, at that time, on\nthe railroad, because the tracks from Lvov, deep into Russia were wider. And from Lvov\ngoing westward, they were narrower. So, wounded soldiers and -- and -- and equipment\nneeded -- that needed to go westward were tran -- had to transferred from one to the\nother. So the Wehrmacht, an officer came down, and he asked people to go to work, you\nknow, and we figured going to work, it\u2019s going to be the best thing. So I -- I worked at\nthat time already at the railroad, and I had a -- a document that I am essential to the\nefforts of the [indecipherable] the German army, and I should be left alone.",
        "Q: So this is within the first few days?",
        "A: First few days, probably no -- no more than a week.",
        "Q: And the Ukrainian Nationalists came in within those first few days and rounded up --",
        "A: The Ukrainian -- the Ukrainian Nationalists, first of all, Lvov 1s a city that 1s partially\nPolish and partially Ukrainian. The vicinities for sure, you know, the agricultural\nvicinities for sure. So the pogrom that the Ukrainians initiated was with the acquiescence,\nwith the permission of the Germans, but not with the participation. This was purely done\nby Ukrainians. The Ukrainian police, volunteer police, and volunteers in general. And I\nremember going back from work, and with a -- with a friend of mine who lived in -- in\nmy building, Adonik was his name. I don\u2019t remember his last name. And we were\nstopped by a Ukrainian, and he wanted us to take to -- to the brigitky, and it must have\nbeen an angel from heaven, a man, a -- a Ukrainian stopped, and he said, \u201cThese people\nhave a -- a document that they are employed by the Wehrmacht, you have no right to\ntouch them.\u201d So he let me go. I would have been killed. I am sure, if he would have taken\nme into the -- to the confines of the jail, I would have been killed like many, many others.",
        "Q: Yeah. And they were rounding up Jews only ?",
        "A: At random.",
        "Q: At random? Anybody?",
        "A: At random, at random. Jews, and political officers of the army if they could find them.",
        "Q: And did you see this as an attack on people who they thought may have been working\nwith the Russians?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Or this was simply --",
        "A: This was purely a pogrom.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: This was purely a pogrom.",
        "Q: And how long did this last [indecipherable]",
        "A: Four days, five days. But it was terrible. It was the first mass slaughter that I have\nexperienced.",
        "Q: So what did you see?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t see anything.",
        "Q: It was --",
        "A: We -- all we heard is, you know, the machine guns, you know, because the -- the brigitky,\nthe -- the jail that I am talking about, were in center city.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So they would bring people there --",
        "A: Into the yard, and into the interrogative itself, and I don\u2019t know what was going on there.\nAll you heard is the machine guns. And then, you know, th-they took Jews with open\ntrucks, flat trucks, to take the -- the victims out to the cemetery to bury them.",
        "Q: And did you see these trucks with dead bodies?",
        "A: I did not.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: I did not. I was told about it --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- because when -- this experience shook me up, so I went in , we had in -- in the\nbasement of our apartment building, each -- the each one, each tenant had a little apar -- a\n-- parted off a little, you know, a little -- it\u2019s a warehouse, call it, you know.",
        "Q: Storage -- for storage?",
        "A: Storage.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And tha -- we had firewood there. So I was terribly shaken up, so I went in there, and\nMother built, from the firewood a false wall, you know, just with the openings for\nbreathing, and you know, and I was there for about two or three days.",
        "Q: Cause you really thought you would be -- that the paper would only protect you so much?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s happening to your mother? Di -- did she not --",
        "A: At that time, not. At that time they were taking men only.",
        "Q: Oh, men. And primar -- excuse me -- primarily young men?",
        "A: Yes, yes. And of course, leaders -- leaders of the giminda, the -- the Jewish, you know,\nth-there was a -- inasmuch as the Soviet Union, there was a -- it was a cultural committee\nthat were considered the giminda, because the giminda, you know, they\u2019re liquidated\nwhen the Russians came in.",
        "Q: Was there anyone else hiding in this -- in this basement, where the storage, besides you?",
        "A: Yes, there were others, but each one sat in his own --",
        "Q: Place.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t speak, of course.",
        "A: No, of course not.",
        "Q: And did your mother come down and bring food?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So what in heaven\u2019s name were you thinking during these two or three days?",
        "A: Terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. I was sorry that I didn\u2019t take Mother, and we\ndid not advance into Russia, although I didn\u2019t know what happened to the people going\ninto Russia, but I -- later on I -- I learned that most of the people, you know, they got to\nsome places, in sibere -- Siberia, and you know, central Russia, because they needed,\nwhen they mobilized their manpower, they needed substitutes to work in the factories.\nYou see, all of it was not a matter of, you know, protection. It was a matter of serving\ntheir needs, but their needs at that time were such that it helped, because the people were\nimmediately employed, they immediately got bread, you know. They -- they could eat,\nthey -- they could exist.",
        "Q: And the Russians were not going to shoot them. That -- well, the point was not to shoot --",
        "A: Right, right, the objective was not to shoot them.",
        "Q: Right, right. What made you not go off your mind in those few days?",
        "A: I often wondered. I often wondered, because the -- the first encounter, you know, with\nmass killings, was so horrible, I cannot begin to tell you. It was outright frightening, and\nit\u2019s no use being the hero. I was frightened.",
        "Q: Did it feel like the world was collapsing? How does one under -- I mean it --",
        "A: It felt that the dark days are coming up on the Jewish people, and it will go from bad to\nworse. Still --",
        "Q: Not mass murder.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have the slightest idea what is waiting for us.",
        "Q: So what did you think when you were sitting there, if you were -- if you were doing this,\ncontemplating what does it mean that the Germans are allowing the Ukrainians to grab\npeople in the street and clearly killing them? What does that -- what did that mean to\nyou?",
        "A: When it happens --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- you are concentrated on --",
        "Q: That.",
        "A: -- On --",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: -- you know, on -- on what\u2019s going on. You are concentrated on that, as you would say.\nYou were not trying to rationalize, you were not trying to find rhymes or reasons whether\nthat\u2019s correct, or incorrect, whether it\u2019s proper, or improper. It\u2019s almost like an\nanimalistic feeling, of trying to protect itself, and trying to escape. And your mind went\nblank. I couldn\u2019t tell you. If you ask me how I reasoned, or -- I don\u2019t remember it.",
        "Q: Right. Did you sleep?",
        "A: Too much.",
        "Q: During those few days, you did sleep? Why do you say too much?",
        "A: Because, th -- the sleep was a form of -- a form of -- of burying your pain. Burying your\nfears.",
        "Q: And you think you shouldn\u2019t have done that?",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know what I should have done. At that time there wasn\u2019t much to do. There\nwas a need to -- we needed time to organize. We needed time to even think in terms of\nresistance. We needed time in terms -- people, for instance, that looked Aryan, you know,\nblonde with blue eyes, needed time to get Polish documents, needed time to find some\nkind Christians, you know, that would give you a hiding space. It was all new. It -- it\ncame down like a -- a poneratseras.",
        "Q: So what enabled you to leave this hiding place? Your mother comes and says they\u2019 ve\nstopped, what?",
        "A: That, yes. That things are normalized, and you know, traffic is -- because th -- for the first\nfew days there was no traffic. The only things that you saw is you saw German military\nvehicles that were advancing forward. You saw the Ukrainians, you know, trying to\nround up as many Jews as possible. To tell you whether I knew how they went, whether\nthey went by lists, or just at random, I couldn\u2019t tell you that. I know if they would have\ntaken me, 1t would have been at random, because I was not politically active. I was not,\nyou know, a Communist -- a member of the Communist party, I was not a Communist\nleader, I was not a leader in my immediate vicinity. So it wasn\u2019t a d -- random thing.",
        "Q: Right. So you go back, and you\u2019re living with your mother in the apartment.",
        "A: Right, and keep working, right.",
        "Q: And you keep working in the railroad now.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: For the Wehrmacht?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do they pay you?",
        "A: They paid very little, but the thing was that it was a good job, because they gave a piece\nof bread, a little marmalade, a little bit of artificial butter, you know, from --",
        "Q: [inaudible |",
        "A: -- so at -- as far as the job is concerned, in those days it was a good job.",
        "Q: And your mother, how was she eating, what is she doing?",
        "A: Well, it -- I had a problem with Mother that no matter what -- for instance if I brought\nhome some kielbasa, she wouldn\u2019t touch it. I can tell you that one day -- but she n-n-n --\nknew that I need to eat, and I need to -- so I remember once coming into the house, and\nmother was, you know, with the fire at -- a fire hook, she was kind of poking under the\nstove. I say, \u201cMom, can I help you, what are you looking for?\u201d So she was a little\nembarrassed to tell me, so I say, \u201cMom, what is it that you need, let me -- let me,\u201d -- so\nfinally I walked over, and I took the hook from her, and I started poking, and what do I\npull out? The kielbasa. She would -- didn\u2019t want to touch it with her hands, so she pushed\nit under the stove.",
        "Q: And she was cooking it for you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But she wouldn\u2019t eat it.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No way.",
        "A: Of course not.",
        "Q: So then what did she eat, some bread?",
        "A: Well, it -- it -- bread, it -- at that time, bread was given out, it was rationed, but they were\ngiving bread, and we -- as I told you before, my job, you know, with the Russians, was a\npretty good job, and I was able to save up some things.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So I went down to the market and bought something, you know, some greens, and some\nfruit, and you know.",
        "Q: So -- so currency didn\u2019t cha -- how -- what currency were you using? What were you\ngetting from the Russians?",
        "A: From the -- from the Russians?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Ruble.",
        "Q: Rubles.",
        "A: Ruble. Rubles.",
        "Q: So, the Germans come in --",
        "A: Chervinsa.",
        "Q: Chervinsa?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And the Germans don\u2019t change the currency, you can go down the --",
        "A: No, no, no. Th-The -- immediately currency was new currency.",
        "Q: So were you able to switch?",
        "A: Wait a minute. Let me go back for a moment. I think that for a little while, the rubles\nwere going on. And then they gave a period that within 10 days, you can submit a mart --\nmaximum amount I think was 500, or 5000, I don\u2019t remember any more. But there was a\nprocess of exchanging this for new, local currency.",
        "Q: And where were you keeping your money, in -- in the apartment under the mattress?",
        "A: Somewhere under -- of course, not in a bank.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Not in a bank.",
        "Q: And were you able to -- if you remembered, were you able to exchange most of he money\nthat you had?",
        "A: I remember -- I don\u2019t remember details, but I remember that I somehow met a guy who\nwas buying up these rubles. Whether he was going into Russia, or whether he believed\nthat the Russians are coming back, I couldn\u2019t tell you. But I know that I was able to\ndispose of it at a rate of exchange that was ridiculous, but I got currency that I could deal\nwith.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah, I want to tell you something, Joan. It\u2019s 50 years.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s getting hazy.",
        "Q: Yes, but you have a lot of details, so if you can\u2019t answer, at least the question\u2019s on the\ntable. And you have a lot of details, so --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Yes, fine. So you are working --",
        "A: At the railroad.",
        "Q: At the railroad station. Is there -- do you see a kind of leveling off of brutality, or do you\nnow begin to see rules for the Jews?",
        "A: No, no, we see a stabilization of sorts. We didn\u2019t know how it will go, but it was the\nGermans that appointed a Jewish leadership, a Judenrat, and they even created a Jewish\nmilitia, you know, just to keep order, no weapons, you know, and all what they did -- for\ninstance, if they wanted -- if they -- if they ordained a random -- a -- ara -- you know, a --\na policy -- if they wanted, for instance, large amounts of money, they went to the\nJudenrat and they gave them 48 hours to come up with it. If not, they\u2019Il kill hundreds of\nJews. This is one thing. The other thing is that -- bear in mind that Lvov had several\nhundred thousand people. There was a need to establish some kind of an order. Even for\nkilling, you needed an order. Do you follow me?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So it was the Jewish Judenrat, and the Jewish militia, the Jewish police, that implemented\nthat order. Little did we know that these policemen will be forced later, to participate in,\nyou know, in shipping off the Jews to the -- God knows where.",
        "Q: Now, a ghetto was not formed immediately.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It takes a number of --",
        "A: Takes awhile.",
        "Q: Takes a few months.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So is the Judenrat and the militia formed before the Jew -- the ghetto is formed, or around\nthe same time?",
        "A: It is -- I don\u2019t remember the details of it, but I can tell you that the location of 1t was very\nmuch in a densely Jewish area.",
        "Q: I see, already.",
        "A: You know, a rat -- the Rappaport, a Shlamitchla, you know, this was a densely Jewish\narea. And this is where they established it.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s where you were living as well?",
        "A: And that\u2019s where I was living.",
        "Q: Okay, so you didn\u2019t -- when the ghetto is formed, which I think is November, December\nof \u201941, is that --",
        "A: At that time, I was already in a slave labor camp.",
        "Q: Okay, so you are -- I see.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I know that they have kept constricting the ghetto area.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They -- first of all they established the ghetto, and they -- and the first one wasn\u2019t so bad\nbecause they -- all they wanted is the perimeter around it to clean up, and of course\npeople were given 48 hours, you know, and take what they can carry with them, and go\nin. And there was a matter of getting these people located within the ghetto, you know.\nAnd this was in the beginning, you know, people felt you are invading my privacy, this is\nmy apartment. So this is where the Judenrat and Jewish police, you know, played a very\nconstructive role, you know. Very constructive role, helping, you know, and -- and\ndemanding from these people that they should make place. That -- there were several\nrounds of constricting the ghetto. I did not get to any of them, so --",
        "Q: So you\u2019re out s -- much sooner, you\u2019re --",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: You\u2019re out of that situation.",
        "A: I -- what I recall is I recall the Germans coming in, the pogrom, this was something that\nI'll never forget, it was a terrible, terrible thing, and it was thousands of Jews that were\nkilled. And what I do remember is the settling in, as you said, you know, things have\nsettled in for awhile. People had to go to work, they came in, for instance, the Germans\norganized an arbitesont. That means a -- an unemployment office, where instead of going\nout and catching, you know, people, they send a message to the arbitesont that today we\nneed 3,000 workers. And the arbitesont had to, you know, supply them. In the beginning,\nthey were people that went there because at the end of the day they got a quarter of a\npound of bre -- a pound of bread, you know. So people needed to work, y -- to be able to\n-- t-to survive, and to get some bread, get some -- some fruit, get some vegetables. And --\nbut what I\u2019m -- you asked me the question, I do -- I did not live in Lvov any more when\nthe first co -- for the second round-up.",
        "Q: Right. So how does it happen that you\u2019re taking -- taken to Viniki slave labor camp?\nWhat -- what happens? You\u2019re still working --",
        "A: Still working on the -- on -- a -- on the railroad, and on the way home, there were SS men\nstanding with Ukrainian police, with a truck, and stopped people, and -- and asked them\nfor documents, for th -- th -- th -- a shine -- a -- a document.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I was quite certain that document that I have is -- has -- carries the protection. So\nwhen they asked for the document I gave it to him, so he tore it up, and he said, \u201cGet on\nthe truck.\u201d And within a half an hour, we were about 60 or 70 people, that were brought\nto Viniki. Viniki was a -- had a small labor camp. What they had is they had a gulag of\nlabor camps spread between Lvov and Kiev, and the object of it was to build a better\nhighway, to enable the advancement of the German mechanized forces. So our job -- the\nViniki group, our job was between Lvov and Viniki, to build a highway. So the first s --\ngravel that we got is they took us into the Jewish cemetery -- Lvov had a beautiful Jewish\ncemetery that was 200 or 250 years old, big magnificent, magnificent, you know,\nmausoleums. Marble, you know, expensive marble. And our job was to dismantle it,\nbreak it into -- into gravel, and load it up on trucks that were going for the building of the\nroad between Lvov and -- and Kiev.",
        "Q: That must have felt --",
        "A: Oh, horrible.",
        "Q: -- horrible.",
        "A: Horrible. In the process of doing it - -and I\u2019m very proud of this, we got started\norganizing, and when it came to a very beautiful mausoleum, what we did is we dug the -\n- dug the -- the grave, put in the stones, and covered it with -- with dirt, you know.",
        "Q: So you could protect it.",
        "A: To protect it.",
        "Q: And they didn\u2019t see?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t see it, and we didn\u2019t -- you know, very few of those that did it, survived.\nMost of them got killed, sooner or later, because this is where the killing started, already.",
        "Q: In that cemeter -- 1n -- a-as you were doing this work?",
        "A: No, no, th --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: They -- le-let me say this to you. As they entered, they were always cases of individual\nkillings, killing five people, six people. But there was no -- this was not an annihilation\nprocess. For the time being it was a punitive, or a process to scare them, to scare us, or a\nprocess to -- s -- th -- you know, force us to surrender gold, or to surrender money. But it\nwas not the implemented, final solution. This came later. This came, I would say in -- in\nthe Lvov area, somewhere about a couple of months after the Germans came in. In\nBarbiare, you know, when the Soviet -- when the German army -- when the not -- when\nthe German army move forward, and they conquered Kiev. In Barbiare there was already\nthe first killing. The Einsatzgruppen. This was the beginning of the Einsatzgruppen. But\nthe Einsatzgruppen were only on the Soviet occupied territories. In -- in the territories of\nformer Poland, they were no mass -- at that time there were no mass killings. Individual\nkillings, yes.",
        "Q: So whatever was formerly Poland --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- which was where Lemberg, or Lvov was --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- that -- that -- it didn\u2019t happen there?",
        "A: Not -- not yet.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] not yet, right.",
        "A: N -- it was brutal, they were -- th-th -- you know, beating us, forcing us to work, and in\nsome ca -- not in some, in many of cases, they made fun, you know, of us, and we had to\n-- they gave us toothbrushes to clean -- to clean a sidewalk, you know, and things like\nthis. They cut off the beards from religious people, but still no mass annihilation.\nKillings, brutality, beating, cruelty, but no mass annihilation. The mass annihilation came\nlater.",
        "Q: Miles, before you were taken on the truck to go to Viniki, w-were you in a situation\nwhere you have to wear the -- the white --",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: -- the white armband with [indecipherable]",
        "A: A white band, a white armband with a Star of David.",
        "Q: And that was a number of months that you wore them, do you think?",
        "A: About three months, I would say.",
        "Q: And what did that -- what did you feel when you --",
        "A: Felt so littled -- so belittled. So morally devastated, you know, to -- t -- first of all, you\nwere no -- you were not a human being. There were some SS men, they were not on\nassignment, they just walked, they walked the street, and if you walked on the sidewalk\nwith them, you know, he hit you with -- you know, with -- you know, with his hand, or\nwith a -- whatever he carried. He -- \u201cDu schwine,\u201d you pig, \u201cget off the sidewalk.\u201d So,\nyou know, they -- we were treated in a terrible way. Dehumanized, totally dehumanized,\nand this was the feeling, that we are -- there were many suicides, I -- I presume you know\nthat. In -- in Lvov, there were many, many suicides.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Oh yes. Of people who just didn\u2019t want to participate in it. Didn\u2019t want to be part of it.",
        "Q: Even though there\u2019s not mass killing, it just is too -- 1t\u2019s too much.",
        "A: The d -- the degradation, the dehumanization. The treating the people like animals. But I\nhad Mother at home, and she couldn\u2019t work, she -- you know, she wasn\u2019t cut out to work,\nshe -- she -- at that time, and Mother was -- 19 -- 84 -- 16 -- 40 -- 56 - 55 years.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, and whatever I -- you know, I could do to, you know, to bring home some\nfood, and to protect her. I had a girlfriend in Lvov, and she was wonderful, she did\neverything she could. She was blonde, blue eyed, so sh -- sometimes she could smuggle,\nand go after, you know, the designated hours, y-you know, because Jews were not\nallowed to -- to be on the street after six o\u2019clock in the evening. So she -- when I was\ntaken away to Viniki, she, for awhile, took care of Mother.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And in a short while after that, 1t started, the mass annihilations started, and Beljets was\nopened, and they started emptying the --",
        "Q: The ghetto.",
        "A: -- the ghetto in Lvov.",
        "Q: Did your mother know you were in Viniki?",
        "A: My mother knew that I was in Vinik1.",
        "Q: How did she find out, do you know?",
        "A: I was working on the road -- I told you we were working on the -- the -- first of all on the\ncemetery, and then I -- we started working on the roads, you know, the gulag that was set\nup. And a guy that I knew, he was a friend of the parents of my girlfriend -- and I asked\nhim, I said, \u201cDo me a favor and go to Lucia and tell her that I am in Viniki.\u201d So from\nhim, Lucia, my girlfriend learned it, and she told Mother. And about six weeks later, they\nstarted the first shipments to Beljets, and I don\u2019t know whether it was the first or the\nsecond shipment.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, that she was on. And did Lucia go on that?",
        "A: No, Lucia survived, and she came without an armband, with this guy, and she told me\nMother was taken away.",
        "Q: Oh. That must have been just --",
        "A: It was horrible.",
        "Q: And by then did you know what it meant?",
        "A: By then we knew it. B --",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: B-By then we suspected, and -- and still I want to tell you that everybody hoped that he\nwill -- he will survive. Somehow he will survive. This desire of human beings, you know,\nto evade the worst, it\u2019s unbelievable.",
        "Q: Now, Lucia was able, because she could pass, to come to Viniki?",
        "A: Yeah, but I have learned later that she was apprehended, and she was taken to slave labor\ncamp of Janofska.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Oh. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yanofs -- do you know about Janofska?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Janofska was a very, very cruel camp, a soflager, and most of the Jews fr-from Lemberg\nwent either to the death camp of Beljets, or to Janofska.",
        "Q: So in some strange way, you were fortunate to be in this work -- this gulag rather than\nJanofska [indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, I was fortunate because, you know, being there, you know, they -- they didn\u2019t --\nthis was the time where they didn\u2019t empty labor -- labor camp. This was a slave labor\ncamp, this was not a killing camp. However, when typhoid broke out in our camp, and\nwhen people started getting high fever, every morning he used to come in, the SS man --\nwhat was his name, I don\u2019t -- I -- I can see him, but I don\u2019t remember his name. H-He --\nHegler? Something like it. And everyone who had fever, and -- he asked the guys to load\nthem up on a -- a -- a -- it was like a -- a pushcart, but with soft tires. And he shot them,\nand they took them out to bury them. And the camp -- aga -- even in camp, there was a\ntime where [indecipherable] to regulate itself, to settle down, because I often wonder\nwhether it wouldn\u2019t have been much better if we would have kept them in turmoil. I often\nwonder that. And yes, a good many would have been killed, a good many would have\nbeen maimed, but in turmoil, when 200 people are working with 10 policemen, and they\ndisperse, some would have been saved. And wise -- why human nature is such to submit,\nI don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: It\u2019s hard to organize turmoil.",
        "A: It\u2019s ha-hard to organize turmoil, exactly. Exactly.",
        "Q: So, are you living, when you\u2019re not working, in a barrack of some kind?",
        "A: Yes. Barracks with the same bank -- th -- the bunkbeds like you see in -- in -- in\nAuschwitz, and we had Ukrainian police -- there were three SS men, and the rest were\nUkrainian police, and they took us to work every morning, and we had to go, and march\nand sing, and --",
        "Q: Sing?",
        "A: Oh yes, all the time.",
        "Q: What were you have -- what did you have to sing?",
        "A: German -- German songs. Or they used to, you know, make up songs that they were in\nGerman, but, -- you know about us, that the Jews are the fault of the war, and the Jews\ncaused the war, you know.",
        "Q: And you had to sing them?",
        "A: Absolutely. Always when we went to work we had to sing, and if not, they were terrible,\nthey asked us to run, to drop, to get up, to -- in particular when it was rainy, when it was\nmuddy. Terrible.",
        "Q: And what clothes do you have? You have the clothes when they took you out\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Our clothes, we did --",
        "Q: That\u2019s it.",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t have stripers.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We did not --",
        "Q: So the same clothes that you came in with?",
        "A: Yes. Same clothes, and the clothes of those that were killed, or died, because you know,\nnot all of them. What I want to point out to you is that in camp, in Viniki, which was a\nslave labor camp, the difference between the poor in the villages, and the kids of -- th-the\nkids or parents of wealthy families, was that the wealthy and the city people died first.\nThey couldn\u2019t -- they -- they were soft. You know what I mean when I -- you know what\nI mean when I say they were soft?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The villagers, and the poor people were more ardent. They were more used to hunger,\nthey were more used to filth.",
        "Q: It\u2019s an interesting oddity, isn\u2019t it --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- that when pressed, and when things get worse --",
        "A: Right, a-absolutely.",
        "Q: -- they have a -- a way of surviving.",
        "A: Right. They -- their -- their -- their level of resistance was higher.",
        "Q: Right. So who are you in that circumstance?",
        "A: I -- in between.",
        "Q: You\u2019re both a city boy, and be --",
        "A: In between, in between, but young.",
        "Q: Yes, you\u2019re 21, or 20 --",
        "A: 21, right.",
        "Q: 21 years old in Viniki, right.",
        "A: And I knew at that time that Mother is gone. I didn\u2019t hear from Lucia, so I assume she is\neither in a camp somewhere, or gone, and then I found out that she is in -- she was in\nAuschwit -- in Janofska.",
        "Q: Right. So --",
        "A: And then I lost trace of her.",
        "Q: So what -- do you have friends there, in the camp?",
        "A: Oh, we formed friends, yeah, absolutely.",
        "Q: You formed friendships.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, this is the camp, you know, if you remember, you know, we were\npreparing an escape, and the elders of the camp called us, and asked us, \u201cWho gives you\nthe right to buy your own freedom at the price of those that will be killed, who will not be\nable to escape?\u201d This is the camp Viniki, this is where it transpired.",
        "Q: Viniki. Now, explain something to me, you say they\u2019re elders of the camp. Now is that\nsomething that the Germans constructed, or it just happened to be --",
        "A: Just there were some people --",
        "Q: They were -- yeah.",
        "A: -- that they naturally were considered, you know -- I remember there was a professor of\nthe University of Lvov. There was a former textile manufacturer. You know, people of\nstatue and respect, and not youngsters, you know.",
        "Q: And how did these --",
        "A: It\u2019s a self evolved leadership, so to say.",
        "Q: Okay, now, how did they find out? Somebody goes and says there\u2019s these young guys\nhere --",
        "A: We were -- we -- we started up with a few, three, four that we started talking about it, and\nwe realized that we are going to do it, that we need about 25 or 30, assuming that if it\ndoesn\u2019t work when we disperse, and a third will get killed, half will get killed, and half\nwill survive.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, there are no secrets, you know, in particular between young people who have been\nincarcerated, and you know. So 1-1t became known that a -- a group -- they didn\u2019t know\nwho, that a group is planning an escape. And then the elders started looking into it, and\nthey found out who the group was, and they summoned us at night, when everybody was\nasleep, to come and talk to them, and we came, and the question was very simple, you\nhave no right to buy your freedom at the price of others. And we recognize that they have\na point, and we listen to them. And it wa --",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes. And it was a wrong thing to do.",
        "Q: And you -- and you said that to them, that 1t was wrong to do?",
        "A: No, we -- we -- w -- when they said it to us, they said go home and think about it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But when we talk about it, and when we talked with each other, we said they -- these --\nthey are right. Maybe --",
        "Q: They are right?",
        "A: Yeah, 30 will escape, but we were about 200 people there. The rest will get killed. So we\ndecided not to do it, and it was mistake, it was a terrible mistake, because two or three\nmonths later, that was the end of Vinik1.",
        "Q: Was it clear at that time that the Germans would take an escape out on the rest of the\npopulation, if you actually -- let\u2019s say -- that -- that --",
        "A: Yes. One of the things that they have established from the beginning, is that mass\nretribution for single disobedience of a single resistance, of stealing something, stealing\nsome food, or something, always mass retribution. This was a common thing. In camp\nalso, mass retribution, all the time. But in that time, what I am talking to you about, this\nwas probably in the beginning of \u201942, that 1 -- the cemetery was emptied already, and we\nran -- they moved us down, like a hun -- a hundred -- we finished a hundred feet, move to\nthe next hundred feet. Finish a thousand feet, move to the next -- at that time I was\nassigned a job to roll -- to ride a steamroller. You know what I am talking about? The\nsteamroller that presses gravel --",
        "Q: The gravel.",
        "A: -- into space. And I was the only one of the entire camp that was allowed at night to\nremain un -- with the steamroller, because I had to protect it. Everybody else went to\ncamp.",
        "Q: Went back to camp.",
        "A: Right. And this --",
        "Q: So you\u2019re alone?",
        "A: Alone.",
        "Q: With the steamroller?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You and the steamroller?",
        "A: Right. But PI tell you, it -- it -- good things came of it, because when they started --\nwhen they started transporting Jews to the death camps of Lvov, and you know, and --\nand -- of Beljets, and -- and -- and other camps, some people broke the little windows in\nthe boxcars open, and threw children out, or youngsters got out. So quite often, people\nknocked on the door, and specifically I remember th -- a fellow that later became one of\nthe best partisans, one of the best sharpshooters that we had, Moishe Lot, he died three\nyears ago. He came, knocked to the door, he was stark naked, stark naked. He said, \u201cLet\nme in, I am very cold, and I want to go in with you tomorrow to work.\u201d So I took him in,\nI gave him something to eat, he warmed up, and I gave him some clothing, and in the\nmorning he blended in with the group, and went to camp. Went to camp because he had\nno place to go.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He had to smuggle into -- to the labor --",
        "Q: Into the slave labor camp.",
        "A: Right. I remember a girl who knocked at the door another night, and it was -- she must\nhave been 17 - 16 years old, beautiful girl. And she was dressed. And she said mother\nthrew her out of the -- of the boxcar. And I asked her whether she knew where the boxcar\ngot, she said, \u201cYes, we knew that we are going -- we are being taken somewhere to a -- a\nfa -- a faniktudslager, right.",
        "Q: And she knew that?",
        "A: Yes. And she again wanted to go into camp, but I said, \u201cLook, you don\u2019t look like\nJewish, try to maybe smuggle.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m tired of it. PIl go into the camp, and\nwhatever will happen, will happen.\u201d",
        "Q: So there were men as well as women in this camp?",
        "A: In our camp there was a very small group of women, and they were mostly in the kitchen.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Oh, maybe 15 - 20 women.",
        "Q: Out of the 200 or so people?",
        "A: Yeah, maybe less.",
        "Q: So was she able to -- to go 1n?",
        "A: She smuggled in, yes. But bear in mind that very few of us survived.",
        "Q: Yeah. Right.",
        "A: You know, the only ones that survive is the ones that found a way of breaking out from\ncamp, and the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, as I the -- the -- the people that were in camp, were assigned to work\npositions. When I was finished [indecipherable] an area, I had to go back to camp, and\nyou know, be in the quarry. So one day in the quarry, we were working, we must have\nbeen 70 or 80 people, guarded by Ukrainian police. Two Ukrainian police needed a\nhandful of people to go further out in the quarry to look for harder -- a harder stone,\nbecause some of the stone was of a calcium composition, and some of it was like marble.\nSo we were four people -- five people, and we were taken by two policemen deep into the\nquarry to -- to dig some of that hard stone. And we -- by eyesight we communicated, you\nknow, and at one point, we jumped them, and we killed them, and we got away with a\nrifle and a half, one rifle intact, and the other one broken. But we were able to -- to fix it.",
        "Q: How was he killed?",
        "A: With shovels and picks.",
        "Q: Real -- all of you just bashed him --",
        "A: Yeah, the two -- yeah, w-we jumped on one and the other, you know, because they were\ngrabbing the rifles, but by the time they were able to grab the rifle and position it, you\nknow, we attacked them with picks and shovels.",
        "Q: Is this something that you had, in some way, talked about?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, you just looked at each other, this was an opportunity.",
        "A: Oh -- oh, this was at a time when we started getting news that there are people that are\nrunning into the woods.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know who, we didn\u2019t know where, but all we heard is that people are escaping\nfrom camp, and going into the woods, they are going to organize themselves. So when we\nkilled them, we didn\u2019t know the area. I told you before about the villagers, and the city\npeople? The villagers were fortunate because they knew the forest, they knew the area.\nWe were fortunate that one of the five was -- Moatcha Stralliska, you know, was a -- a --\na village -- a -- a -- a peasant -- a village boy. And he knew the area. And we escaped,\nand we -- in daytime we got into the field, it was -- where we lay in the -- you know, in\nbetween the stands of -- you know, wheat and corn, whatever was growing there. And at\nnight we got into the woods. We didn\u2019t know anybody, we didn\u2019t know where to go. But\nslowly, you know, you\u2019re going -- we discovered that there are some Jews here, there\u2019s\nsome Jews there. Within a period of six to eight weeks, we were around 200 - 250 people,\nvarious ages. Some women, some children. So what we did is we separated the young,\nthe ones that were able to fight, and we -- and we had with us, you know, the -- the -- we\ncalled it, you know, the -- the ghetto. The elderly people, the children, you know, the drek\ncommando we called it.",
        "Q: Drek?",
        "A: Commando.",
        "Q: The drek commando, I see.",
        "A: Right. But we kept them, we kept them in food, and we kept them safe.",
        "Q: And these were people who had escaped from the ghetto?",
        "A: Escaped from the ghetto, some of them escaped from a hiding place. Some of them\nescaped, you know, from camps.",
        "Q: Camps.",
        "A: All kinds of things.",
        "Q: Right. And this was just happenstance, that you began to find each other?",
        "A: Pure coincidence.",
        "Q: And you were, in the beginning, five guys?",
        "A: We started -- we were th -- when we came in, as five.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] these guys.",
        "A: But there were already people in the forest.",
        "Q: Now, I want to a -- bef -- I -- I -- I want to obviously get into the details of that, but I\nwant to go back to something. When those elders call you together, 1s that two or three\nmonths before your actual escape?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And why did you say that at that moment it was stupid that you listened to them? Why\nwas it so stupid?",
        "A: Because if we wouldn\u2019t have listened to them --",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: -- if we wouldn\u2019t have listened to them, we -- about 30, or maybe 40 would have either\nescaped not being noticed, or would have escaped, and would have been noticed and shot\nat, and some would have been killed, but the rest would have survived.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re saying a larger group would have gotten out?",
        "A: Right, right. This is all, you know, if and when and if and when. But the fact is that the\npeople that were in this camp, sooner or later, were transferred to Janofska or to\nAuschwitz, and were killed. Or to any of the death camps, Treblinka, to Sobibor.",
        "Q: The five -- the five boys of you who did escape, were these five also part of the 20 or 30\nwho had been thinking about it earlier?",
        "A: No, not all of them, one. One was them. Because bear in mind, I told you before that we\nmoved a hundred feet, a thousand feet.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, at one point we caught up with a -- with a group from the -- from Kroshenko,\nfrom another gulag.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: When I say gulag, I\u2019m talking about af -- a -- a labor force, established, you know, to\nhandle a stretch of the road. So at that time, w-we have met with another group. Am I\nclear?",
        "Q: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: This was Kroshenko. And the forests that we were in were called the Hanachofsky\nLassiter Hanachova forest.",
        "Q: Forest.",
        "A: [indecipherable] Hanachov.",
        "Q: Now this is not an area, of course, that you\u2019re familiar with, only one guy of your -- the\nfu --",
        "A: Yeah, but there were others later, when we started grouping together.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Most of the escapees were people that knew the area.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: They knew some peasants, they were hoping that they will go in, and perhaps the peasant\nwill help him, maybe he\u2019Il hide him, maybe he\u2019Il give him some food.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: Now, let me ask you something, that circumstance of jumping the two guards and killing\nthem, you have been in a situation of being brutalized now, for a couple of years. Not --\nand you\u2019ve watched brutality. You yourself have never killed anyone, or been in a --",
        "A: This was the first time.",
        "Q: This was the first time. What -- what happened to you --",
        "A: It felt good.",
        "Q: It felt good.",
        "A: Felt good, let me not tell you anything else, it felt very good, it felt very good.",
        "Q: And did you all have the same -- do you think --",
        "A: I can only tell you how I felt. I believe so. I believe so, because we were bitter, we were\nmistreated, we were innocent, our families were murdered. We were on the brink of\nbeing murdered, there was no law protecting us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Nothing. Everything was against us, the law was against us, the -- the -- the government\nwas against us, you know. Everybody was against us.",
        "Q: And did you feel that you had crossed a line in terms of being able to do things you\nhadn\u2019t done before because of --",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that we were philosophizing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have time for that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We were hunted, and you know, we had to do everything possible to protect ourselves,\nand we started organizing, I told you, weapons was a major problem.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, the -- we -- 1t was very difficult to get weapons, it was dangerous to get\nweapons, and when you got them, you had to pay horrendous prices for it. We were not\nstrong enough yet to -- later on it was different, because we used to go into a village\nwhere German -- the German sup -- food supplies were stored. And we took what we\nwanted, killed the -- the two or three policemen that were there, four the most, and\nburned the rest of the -- poured gasoline on the top of the sugar, and -- and the flour. But\nlater on we got smarter. We took as much as we could, and we traded it with the peasants.\nThe peasants had weapons. The peasants -- you know, when the Russians were treated, or\nthe Poles were treated, they buried rifles, and -- and you know, hand grenades. So we\ndealt with them.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: We traded.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s go back to the beginning. It takes you about five or six weeks, yes? To get\ntogether --",
        "A: To get organized.",
        "Q: Get organized. So how are you -- what\u2019s happening? Are you walking in the nighttime\nand sleeping during the day so you\u2019re not seen? Or you walk whenever you can?",
        "A: In the forest -- in the for -- the Germans did not go into the forest.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s what I was wondering.",
        "A: They did not go into the forest. If they -- there were several times when they made round-\nups. So what they did is they enc -- encircled a certain area, and bombarded it heavily\nwith artillery. Or send in Ukrainians, but they themselves very seldom went into the\nforest, and when they went in, they didn\u2019t come out.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t go in.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: However, there were Ukrainian Nationalists, the -- the -- we called them banderofsa,\nfrom Bandera. They were much more dangerous than the Germans, because they knew\nthe forest better than we did. And they were well -- well armed, they were well equipped.\nThey knew the forests, and the most important thing, if any one of them got injured, all\nthey needed to do was to bring him back, and put him into any peasant, and the peasant\nwould take them. With us, if somebody got injured, you know, unless the -- we -- we\nknew that the -- the peasant is trustworthy, we couldn\u2019t -- we had to keep him with us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And medicine was a big problem. Medicine and weapons was the biggest problem, not\nfood.",
        "Q: I was going to ask, not food?",
        "A: No, because food -- we -- we were robbing. We went into a village, and you know -- and\nwe told them that we are confiscating. You have three cows, we\u2019 ll take one. And --",
        "Q: That was good of you, you left two.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you took one.",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: So you would take a cow?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then kill the cow and take [indecipherable]",
        "A: Sure, sure, sure. But as time went on, we became bolder, you know. I am not telling you\nthat we engaged the German Wehrmacht in open warfare because this is ridiculous. We\nwere not equipped for it, and we were not cut out for it, and it wasn\u2019t called for. But, as\ntime went on, you know, we -- as I told you how we got -- you know, we surrounded\ntheir food depots. You know, when we needed clothing, we went in, you know, to\nwealthy peasants and we got what we wanted. Normally we did this about 20 - 30 miles\naway from where we stayed, because it was dangerous to do that. We lived by the power\nof our -- of our weapons. What we did, for instance, is, you know, we made sure that the\nsurrounding area has a misconception of how big we are, and how strong we are. We\nused to place a few people in various parts of the woods, and ask him to relieve salvos.\nAnd the news in the for -- in the villages was that the partisans are occupying the entire\nforest, and they have thousands of people there, you know, fully equipped. You know, to\nmisinform them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We used to go down, and we had some peasants that we trusted, and this is where we kee\n-- kept our wounded. But medicine was a big problem. And these were the days when\npenicillin were not known yet. So the biggest item was iodine. And we used to use -- as\nrunnners, we used to use little girls. You know, 12 years old, 14 years old, they were\nfabulous. One of our girls was caught outside of Lvov with two liters of iodine. Now,\nwhen the police saw a girl with two liters of iodine, they knew that she 1s from a partisan\ngroup. And they promised her that they will take her to her parents, and they will -- they\ngave her clothing, and they\u2019ll give her food, and this, to -- to reveal where we are, and she\nrefused. So they started torturing her. She refused. They finally killed her. So ya --",
        "Q: We need to stop the tape. Hold -- hold that thought.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: We ended the last tape with you talking about the young 12 year old girl whose name was\nLeah.",
        "A: I think so --",
        "Q: And -- yes, you think it was Leah?",
        "A: -- | think it was Leah, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: And she was caught --",
        "A: With two liters of di -- 1odine. And they tried to interrogate her, and promise her all kinds\nof things, and finally -- she didn\u2019t reveal where we are, and finally they started torturing\nher, and they tortured her to death. But what I want to tell you is that the role of women\nin the underground was very necessary, and very important. Because first of all, if you --\nif we needed to make contact with someone about negotiating a purchase of weapons, or\nabout getting some medicine, or about getting, you know, someone who is very sick into\na hospital, you know, we needed women to do that, because men were circumcised. Ifa\nman was caught in town, all they needed to do is ask him to drop his pants, and they\nknew that they have a Jew. Now, people like Leah, people blend -- in particular blonde\nwomen, blue eyed women, well there were many of them, you know, and spoke a good\npeasant Polish, or Ukrainian, you know, were precious because they could do these things\nthat -- much easier. So they played a very, very important role, and with -- you know,\nbeing on guard at night -- they were on guard at night. I -- I have nothing but admiration\nfor the con -- conduct of women at, you know, during the partisan years.",
        "Q: How did you find out that this happened to Leah? How did the information get back to\nyou?",
        "A: That she was caught?",
        "Q: And -- and killed.",
        "A: She was caught outside of Lvov, that was a small village. And in the village, that, you\nknow, the people knew that, you know, the do -- the Ukrainians -- the -- the policemen\nwere either local, or they grew into the community. So, you know, the --",
        "Q: So people knew it was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Of course, of course.",
        "Q: So e-explain to m -- explain to me if you can -- I-I -- I know that this -- this is a process,\nso it\u2019s a little bit difficult to explain it, ha -- the kind of structure that you have, once you\nhave these two or three hundred people, there are children, there are women, there are\nelderly. There are young -- young, strong women, young men --",
        "A: Okay, there was a fighting force, and that\u2019s a big word.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t want you to come away from here is that we commanded, you know,\nan air force, and tanks, and -- this was not the case. We had an antiquated weapons, with\na meager amount of ammunition, every bullet counted, every hand grenade that you had,\nyou were not sure whether when you will throw it, whether it will explode or not, you\nknow, and -- but slowly, slowly, we started coo -- you know, i-invading small police\noutposts and villages.",
        "Q: But wait a minute, wait a minute. I want to go back a little bit. If you have two or 300\nhundred people, this --",
        "A: Okay, all -- all --",
        "Q: -- league of fighting force is like what, 50 guys?",
        "A: Of sorts.",
        "Q: No women. No women are going to be shooting. Is that --",
        "A: No, women were -- were not -- women were used as runners.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Women were used as nurses. Women were used as -- you know, mending clothes and\nstuff like this.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, okay.",
        "A: No -- no shooting.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But for guards at night, if we come back -- came back, and we were tired, and we wanted\nto lie down to sleep, they -- they were guards. They --",
        "Q: With guns?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: Not all of them. There is -- she just died, Hannah Hochberg. She was a tremendous,\ntremen -- oh, we made a mistake, we should have had her with us in the fighting force.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: She was a dynamo, a dynamo. And she always argued don -- don\u2019t -- just because, you\nknow, we are different sex, doesn\u2019t mean that, you know, we cannot participate, but --",
        "Q: So there were arguments in the group between the men -- the women wanted --",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: -- the women wanting to fight.",
        "A: Absolutely, and some of them did.",
        "Q: And s -- and some of them did?",
        "A: Not in our --",
        "Q: Right, yes --",
        "A: Not the --",
        "Q: -- in other groups.",
        "A: In other groups.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. So what I\u2019m saying to you is, you ask me did -- di -- the division up, the\nelderly people, the women, the children. We call them the ghetto, or the -- the drek\ncommando, you know. They were wonderful people. They were our -- our uncles, our\naunts, our -- not my uncles, but there were parents there, you know. So our job was too\nkeep them with food, you know, and with supplies. Now, if there was a case where we\nlearned that Germans are trying to surrounder us and what have you, we moved them out\nfirst. And they were difficult because they couldn\u2019t move as rapidly.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, but we moved them. We never abandoned them.",
        "Q: And that put you all in a -- it was a more difficult group to be 1n if you had --",
        "A: Absolutely -- absolutely. And then there\u2019s another thing that you have to bear in mind.\nHaving weapons was the most important thing. People came out of the ghettos, a good\nmany of them came -- came with their s -- wi -- with their shirt on their back.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: And there were camps, there were partisan units that did not accept people without\nweapons. There were partisan units that unfortunately came with weapons, but before\nthey reached us, you know, there were Ukrainian units that intercepted them, took their\nweapons and killed them. We were in good working relationship with the akar, with the\narmia kryova, with the Polish akar, and the reason for it 1s because this was an area where\nbefore the war Poles were considered colonizers, you know, occupants, you know, that\nthey were sent in by the Polish government to Polonize the area. And the Ukrainians ha-\nhated them, and the Ukrainians burned their villages and killed them. And they needed us\nas allies. So in our area, I know that there are stories that there were places where akar\nwere killing Jews. There were cases like this, not in our area. In our area, we were allies.\nOne time I remember, there was a case where they were plotting to take our weapons\naway, and we discovered it, and -- so we had to show them whether. We told them, if this\nis what you want, we are going to be on our own, and when the Ukrainians will invade\nyour villages, you will be by yourself. So --",
        "Q: They backed down.",
        "A: Right. So what I\u2019m saying to you -- you ask me about what did we do with the -- with the\nelderly. We kept them not far from us, almost adjacent.",
        "Q: In what -- I mean, in what way were you living? In tents, just outside, blankets --",
        "A: No, dug-ins. Dug-ins, yeah, with --",
        "Q: You would dig --",
        "A: Dig -- dig --",
        "Q: -- trenches?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Dig basements, and cover them with leaves, with branches --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- and soil on the top of it. You know, it -- in the wintertime it was cold. Sometimes,\nwhen it was relatively quiet, we used to go into a village, and camp in village. But when\nwe on -- when we were in the village, we did not allow the villagers to go in the direction\nof the city, because we were afraid that they will betray us, you know. Another thing that\nwe have played a role, which in my opinion was very, very important. The Gestapo\nimplemented an order that every peasant who will -- every -- every Pole, or Ukrainian\nwho will deliver to them a Jew, will get a liter of vodka, or five kilograms of sugar. And\nthere were those that did it. So one day we found out that an Ukrainian from a village,\nPotanachufka, delivered to the Gestapo a mother and a daughter, that\u2019s a young girl eight\nyears, or nine year old. And of course the Gestapo took them and killed them. So we went\n-- went in that night to the village, knocked at the door, took him out, slung him up on a\ntree in the front of his house, as a sign, this will be the reward for anybody who will turn\nJews over to the Gestapo for a liter of vodka or five pounds of sugar. That was the end of\nit, they didn\u2019t do it any more. It was a time where life -- life wasn\u2019t worth much. But, you\nknow, what you have to do, you have to do.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: When they started attacking Polish villages, we, with the Poles, started attacking\nUkrainian villages. You know, I told you about this guy that came to me when I was on\nthe -- when I was on the steamroller, Moishe Lot? He turned out to be one of the best\nsharpshooters that we had. A young fella, you know, from a peasant family, small town --\nvery small town family, and one time we had an encounter with the Ukrainian\nnationalists, with the banderoftis. And he crawled out to very, very front, and killed their\nmachine gunnist, and brought back a machine gun.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Do you know what a machine gun meant to us? It was a fantastic thing, you know? So\nthere were days -- days of good feelings, and there were days of sad feelings. Me give\nyou a -- another moment with -- has not to do with f -- with fights. We came back from\nan engagement where we were fighting an Ukrainian group, I mean of -- all partisans.\nAnd it was a b -- we lost a few guys. And it was very, very tiresome, because we had to\nescape, we had to run, and we had to counterattack. It -- it -- 1t was not one of the best\ndays for us, it was one of the bad days for us. And we came in, and one guy says, \u201cFellas,\ndo you know what is tonight? Tonight is Yom Kippur.\u201d We didn\u2019t have prayer books,\nand we were not that terribly [indecipherable] but one guy who remembered the prayers,\nstood up, and started singing, you know, the Kol Nidre. Jay -- Joan, Pll never forget that.\nI'll never, never forget that. It was so emotional, you know.",
        "Q: For me, too, if you tell [indecipherable]. Tell me a little bit about the command structure,\nand --",
        "A: The command structure, our -- first of all, I told you that we were fighting hand in hand\nwith the -- with the akar -- with the armia kryova. The commander of the -- all the forces\nwas a -- a professor of the polytechnic [indecipherable] from Lvov. And his pseunonym\nwas Polcovnik Proch powder -- gun powder. He was the main commander, and the rest\nwas, you know, it shifted constantly. You know, sometimes, it -- 1t -- Lot\u2019s brother-in-\nlaw, Meisel, George Meisel was in charge of a group, sometimes I was in charge of a\ngroup, sometimes we joined together and we subjugated our command privileges. We\ndidn\u2019t play army, I mean it -- it -- you know, it wasn\u2019t the objective. But it had to be\norganized, it -- and -- you know, when a guy went out with a -- with a group, either for\nfood, or for weapons, or to attack somebody, or to burn down a village, you know, there\nhad to be command. There had to be command. There was one guy among us, he was\nfrom -- from this area, and he was a true peasant. He was fantastic. We came back at\nnight to the forest from an -- we called it aktia, from an action. He took off his shoes, and\nwalking with the bare feet, he felt his way to find the paths back to our woods, in the\ndark. I -- I would say that a good many of us are alive today on account of him.",
        "Q: So, are you saying that all of these different groups were in fact part of a larger --",
        "A: Larger group.",
        "Q: -- group.",
        "A: Where Polcovnik Proch, Colonel Proch was in charge of.",
        "Q: Was -- was the -- was the overall -- right.",
        "A: He decided, you know, on major things, on going to, you know, burn down a village, or\nto go down a village and stand side by side with the Poles and fight. There was one guy\nwho was even a volksdeutsch, you know, and -- and in the village, he was considered a\ncollaborator of the Germans. And he was with us, and a good guy, and I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t\nremember any more his name, believe it or not.",
        "Q: So how would you get orders to do something? Would there be a runner from whe --\nwherever the command [indecipherable]",
        "A: An order was -- and order was given that we need 25 guys, or 15 guys, to go and do this\nand this and this. First of all you took volunteers. If you didn\u2019t have enough volunteers,\nyou appointed, you designated. For instance, to go down and take care of this peasant\nwho delivered the mother and the daughter to Gestapo, for this, only volunteers, and only\n-- there were too many volunteers for that, you know, so --",
        "Q: So how was it chosen?",
        "A: We decided that thi -- this one, this one, this one, this one goes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you were part of that group?",
        "A: Yes, yes, and I\u2019m very proud of it. Again, I feel very good about it.",
        "Q: Right. So, one could be a commander one day of a particular action. It wasn\u2019t as if you\nhad a general that stayed as a [indecipherable]",
        "A: There -- there was no generals and colonels.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It -- 1t -- it was -- for instance, I mentioned to you George Meisel. George Meisel was\nlooked upon, you know, he was a brave -- he was a good shooter, and you know, he was\nlooked upon as good material for leadership. I often, you know, when I needed another\nteam, I asked his team to join me.",
        "Q: So wi -- did you actually have teams? That thi --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That you stayed within -- sort of?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: So tell me something. Arms were difficult to get, bullets, each one was very important --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: How in heaven\u2019s name did you get trained to do this? You\u2019ve never shot a gun before.",
        "A: I can tell you that among us were kids, you know, that wer -- came out from Haider --\nyou know, from -- from -- young kids --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: 17 - 18 - 19 years old. They never in their life touched a weapon, leave alone used it,\nbecame the best sharpshooters, the most courageous guys to go into fire. The most\ncourageous. And the courage was not only, you know, t-to go into a -- take care of a\npeasant. We dealt with a well organized underground -- Ukrainian the banderoft 1s well-\norganized, well equipped, knowing the forest, knowing where to go, knowing the\npeasants clauses too, you know. These were formidable opponents, and we fought with\nthem. We fought with them. Now, as far as the Germans are concerned, when they --\nwhen we came upon them, you know, we took care of, we took them on. But only if they\nwere in small groups. The time when we really went after them is when the retreat started\nrapidly, when the Soviet army was already 50 - 100 miles away.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We used to be on both sides of the road, and if a small group came on, we took care of\nthem. The -- we got to a point where we forced them to put signs on the highways that no\nGerman is allowed to travel less than a foursome, and equipped with military --",
        "Q: Because they knew what would happen?",
        "A: -- with -- fully armed.",
        "Q: So you still haven\u2019t answered my question. Were you -- was there training in shooting, or\ndi -- wi -- simply you were given a gun, and you said --",
        "A: No, when -- the first time you were given a gun you were taught what to do with it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then, if we had ample -- there were times when we had ample bullets, so we trained for\nsharpshooting.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: We trained -- sharpshooting was very important with us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because we were not an army, you know. It is a group of people -- do exactly, you know,\nand anybody that tells you that -- whether it was Bielski, or whether it was another, that\nthey were an army, they were not an army. They were partisan groups that we didn\u2019t\ntrust, higher up in -- in the -- in the forest of Belarusa. There were many Russian\npartisans, well organized, who have gotten drops, military drops from Russia. Some of\nthem were good and took in Jewish partisans, some of them didn\u2019t. There was no unified\nform.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There was no unified order. Every day was a day of it\u2019s own. Every day had it\u2019s own\ndangers, every day had it\u2019s own downers, and it\u2019s own uppers.",
        "Q: So there -- there couldn\u2019t be an overall strategy.",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t.",

        "A: This --",
        "Q: And you\u2019re talking about sharpshooters because all you could do is take out one person\nor two people at a time.",
        "A: Yeah, but it maked a big difference, because when they attacked them, and they saw that\nfour or five are killed, they pulled back.",
        "Q: Right, cause that\u2019s a lot for them.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So it -- these were days, and tom -- in -- in my memory, these were my days of glory,\nbecause being -- you know, dismantling the -- the -- the cemetery of -- of Lvov was very\ndepressing, very painful. I mean, I felt that I am destroying a history of Lvov. And there,\nyou know, whether it was, you know, attacking, or defending, or getting even, it -- you\nlived by the power of your gun. I didn\u2019t intend to survive. There was no one who hoped\nto survive. The idea was to fight, and die on your feet, instead of living on your knees, so\nto say.",
        "Q: So that was the real aim?",
        "A: The aim, it was to get even.",
        "Q: The purpose was to get even.",
        "A: To get even, absolutely.",

        "A: Well, no, whatever our lot was, their lot was.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, our lot was their lot. I mean, if we withdrew, they withdrew with us, you\nknow. Some of the elderly, you know, knew the peasants well. They served a purpose.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: They knew the peasants from before the war, they dealt with one another, although not\nalways -- sometimes the peasants forgot all the [indecipherable] sometimes, in most\ncases. You know, but in some cases, an elderly guy went down, and he came back with a\npiece of cheese, or with a piece of that pork belly, or th -- you know, and what have you.",

        "A: 23 months.",
        "Q: 23 months, okay, almost two years. Did people straggle in during this course of two\nyears, or did you stay pretty much stable?",
        "A: People straggled in -- no, people straggled in, but it was less and less as time went on,\nbecause more and more Jews were killed off, and the communities, the Jewish\ncommunities were wiped off. The stragglers were basically people that were hidden by\npeasants, and for one reason or another, they have to leave the hiding place.",
        "Q: And was -- as far as you remember, did it just happen that you became a f -- in a sense a\nfamily camp as well as an armed camp, or did you sit down, you guys, and you said, we\ncan\u2019t -- we have to take these people in, we can\u2019t just say no to them.",
        "A: Look, they were family.",
        "Q: But people did say no. Other groups said no.",
        "A: Yes, they w -- there were -- there were cases --",
        "Q: So you had to make a decision.",
        "A: There were cases where some groups said we will not -- we are hindered, you know, and\nwe will not be able to function, having them with us. Were we the noble people that\nsaved them? I don\u2019t know what it is. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. A good many were\nrelated, a good many were from the same village, from the same town, you know.\nAlthough being from the same village and the same town doesn\u2019t necessarily always\nmake the difference between good and bad. It just happened so. It just happened so.",
        "Q: Tell me, were any babies born? Did women -- were women and men having --",

        "A: It was --",
        "Q: Was it an --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t talked about, it was a matter of delivering the baby, and making sure that the\nbaby is not delivered alive.",
        "Q: And who did that?",
        "A: Women.",
        "Q: Women did that to the babies?",
        "A: Yes, women. Sometimes a sister, sometimes a mother. We didn\u2019t have any 90 year old\npeople with us when we [indecipherable] elderly, you know.",

        "A: Yes, itis. Well, there weren\u2019t any 10 - 12 babies a day, you know.",
        "Q: No, no, no, no, I understand.",

        "A: No, they became around --",
        "Q: They became pregnant in those circumstances.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We were young people.",
        "Q: Right. And did some of the women get hysterical when this happened, when -- they\ncouldn\u2019t bear it? Do you remember circumstances --",
        "A: They usually were taken into the elderly camp, you know, when they were quite\nadvanced, and didn\u2019t come back until they came back, so --",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Not that they were that far away from us, but you know, I didn\u2019t know, perhaps maybe I\ndidn\u2019t want to know.",
        "Q: Right. And of course there was no chance for abortion, there\u2019s no -- there isn\u2019t -- there\u2019s\nnothing, right?",
        "A: As I told you, medical -- the -- we -- we happened to have -- in our group we happened to\nhave a guy who was a half a dentist. He was a --",
        "Q: Half a dentist.",
        "A: -- a -- a technologist.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: He was a technologist.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and we told them point blank, we are entrusting him with you, or her with you, and\nGod help you if something happens to him. True. They were afraid of us. They really\nthought that we are an organized, you know, 42\u201d battalion of the third army.",
        "Q: Right. Sometimes that\u2019s better than actually the real army.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Tell me something about iodine, why was iodine so important?",
        "A: A disinfectant.",
        "Q: Mm. And that was the best thing you could get your hands on?",
        "A: What medicine did we need? We needed, for instance, let\u2019s say if you had stomach\ntrouble, so there were elderly people that knew the jolad -- the -- the -- the different\ngrowths that grow in the woo -- in the forest, that takes care of it. The injuries that we had\nwas a bullet penetration. You needed to prevent the infection, and iodine was the best\nthing.",
        "Q: Did this half doctor, half dentist ever operate?",
        "A: Wa -- oh yes. Oh, yes. Operate. Cut it a little bigger, and with a pair of pliers, which was\nboiled in hot water, pull it out.",
        "Q: And were people given liquor, or did they --",
        "A: Liquor, that was a different story, liquor, everybody was sick for liquor.",
        "Q: They were?",
        "A: Every -- sick for liquor, you know, everybody came declaring that they are sick --",
        "Q: Oh, because wanted liquor --",
        "A: -- because they could get the -- Ill tell you a story with liquor. We were told that about\n30 miles away from our settlement where we were, that there is a home -- there\u2019s a food\ndepot of a -- of th-the German -- of the German army. And it\u2019s manneded by a few, like\nelderly Germans, you know? So we went down there, and it was winter time, and went\ndown with a sleigh, and with a horse, and we came in, and we loaded up. We took some\nflour, we took some sugar, I remember. And then, you know, we saw large kegs, we\nasked the guy, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d He says, \u201cSchnapps.\u201d So we took a keg, and we rolled it\non the sleigh, and we brought it back to camp. And the commander, Proch saw -- saw the\n-- the keg, he got ballistic. So finally he asked -- he was terribly upset, you know, because\nit\u2019s dangerous, you know, that it -- you getting drunk, you get loud. So finally he ordered\nthe keg to be half buried. You know what I mean by half buried?",
        "Q: Put it in the ground with half of the --",
        "A: Half -- half the amount.",
        "Q: Yeah. Oh, you mean -- you mean throw out half of it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: The keg half buried. This is the keg, bury it that deep.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: Okay. And it was for medicinal purposes, and for the purposes of rubbing yourself,\nbecause this was a good disinfectant. So, all of a sudden, everybody claimed that he has\nlice, he has mites, he has this, he has that, and they need -- they need th -- some liquor. So\nfinally he got tired of it, and he br -- he m -- he broke a part of it, and spilled it in the\nground. But --",
        "Q: Did you -- wou -- did you go after liquor, too?",
        "A: Oh, hellow.",
        "Q: And what --",
        "A: This is where I learned to drink.",
        "Q: Is it? And how did it f -- how did it function, it dull -- 1t dulled you in some way? Or it --\nit\u2019s made y --",
        "A: First of all, it takes away fear from you, you know. It kind of -- it\u2019s a false courage, but it\ngives you a courage. And you -- you ability of -- of making s -- quick, sane decisions\ndecreases tremendously. There -- there shouldn\u2019t be any liquor on --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know. If I would have been Commander Proch, I would have, you know, destroyed\nthe barrel completely, you know. But on the other hand, if I would have been with\nRussian partisans, if -- if Commander Proch would have tried to break a barrel of liquor,\nthey would have killed him.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question about relati -- the relations between men and women in the\ncamp. A -- in -- insofar as you could observe or experience, were women and men\ntogether because they cared about each other? Were the women going to men because\nthey thought they would be more protected? How -- how --",
        "A: Both.",
        "Q: Both.",
        "A: Both. There were many, many cases where beautiful women from outstanding families,\nbefore the war wouldn\u2019t have looked at -- at a given guy. And she became his girlfriend,\nbecause she felt that he is protected, better protected. Absolutely. Absolutely. And it -- I -\n- [ll tell you one thing, it\u2019s very difficult to be in judgment on these things.",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: You know, very difficult to be in judgment. It was a matter of trying to survive, it was a\nmatter of trying to take revenge, it was a matter of defending yourself, and defending\nthose around you, or counting on this, that those around you will defend you. You know,\neven on going out on ac -- on action, it always depended with whom you are going, and\nwho is your back-up, because if you had good back-up, you had a better chance to come\nback home.",
        "Q: Right, right. No, and I\u2019m not asking the question because I\u2019m judging, it\u2019s a matter of\ntrying to figure out what the social relation -- how they -- how they really functioned.",
        "A: Some of it was natural --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that they, you know, either that, you know, were girl -- girlfriend and boyfriend from\nthe small town where they were, or they got to know one another 1n -- in the forest.",
        "Q: Right. Now, w-would it also be the case with some of the women, if they were the\ngirlfriend of a particular person, would feel protected from the other men? I mean, what -",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So that -- because men would n -- then not [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, she was just -- no, no, no. Sh-She was his girl.",
        "Q: So no one else would touch her.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Right. So a women who was not connected with somebody was vulnerable in some way?",
        "A: L-Let me say this to you. Yes, she was vulnerable, but the sexual promiscuity was quite -\n- quite there. Th -- look, what else was there? The life was threatened. Sometimes you\nwere hungry, sometimes you were cold. When you felt the urge, man or woman, wha --\nwhat is it?",
        "Q: Right. I\u2019m not -- n -- but I -- I\u2019m wondering 1n some situations women feel a kind of\nvulnerability that they don\u2019t want to --",
        "A: It -- 1t was not an animalistic -- if you ask me whether it was an animalistic order, that,\nyou know, a man went out and grabbed a girl, no, no.",
        "Q: Right, it was something else.",
        "A: Either she was his girlfriend, or -- or neither one of them were attached, and you know,\nbut if -- if a woman was the girlfriend -- I\u2019m using, you know, that Moatcha Stralliska as\nan example. He was a very common guy, he was a very crude guy. He was a wonderful\nfella, you know, and as a companion in battle, you couldn\u2019t have asked for a better one.\nYou couldn\u2019t have asked for a better one. So he wound up with a girl. You know, as a\nmatter of fact, they live together, you know, until today.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Before the war she would have never, never, never considered him as her mate. And th-\nthat -- you -- you have to bear in mind that it was a -- a life where every hour was danger,\nth -- I\u2019ll say it to you, that the danger of dying wasn\u2019t such a big deal, so -- so what is it?\nEverybody dies around you. The object is not to. The object is to defend yourself. The\nobject is, you know, to demand a price for your -- for your being killed. For instance, it\nwas an accepted omen, an accepted formula that the last bullet 1s never used on the\nenemy. The last bullet you always use -- was used on oneself. This is not heroism.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: This is instead of falling into the hands of the enemy and being tortured, and being, you\nknow, that -- at -- abused, and -- and beaten, and -- an-and what have you, and then be\nkilled? So the last bullet, if the situation was such, if the -- often, you know, we went out,\nand if a guy got injured, and he couldn\u2019t -- and we couldn\u2019t get to him, so he stayed and\nwaited on, you know, as close as the Germans or Ukrainians would come to him, and\nthen he killed himself. Let me lighten it for you, and tell you again a story that you will\nget a chuckle of. We, as I told you before, were staying in the forest in dig -- in dug-outs,\nin -- in deep basements, you know, with a stove inside, it was warm. You know, you\ncould undress and sleep comfortably. But as far as physical needs, to go to the toilet and\nwhat have you, you have to go outside. So what we did is we took a plank of wood, and\nwe tied it, or nailed it, you know, if we had nails, most cases we tied it between two trees,\nSO a person can sit down, and, you know, do whatever he needs to, and come back. It was\nvery cold, and as a person moved his bowels, it froze. And -- let me finish the story. And\nso it kept on, you know, freezing, and normally when -- you know, when you move your\nbowels, and if you have a hard surface, it creates like an ice cream cone, a reversed ice\ncream cone. So this kept growing, and growing, and growing until it reached the level of\nthe plank. And one of the guys got up at night, you know, no one wanted to go out at\nnight, but when you couldn\u2019t hold it any more, so -- and he ran out, and sat down on that\nplank, you know, to do -- to move his bowels. But as he sat down, that frozen point of the\naccumulated bowel movement penetrated his buttock, and he was bleeding. Until today,\nhe is known as the partisan who was injured by a pile of shit.",
        "Q: Oh my God.",
        "A: Oh, did we have fun with it.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness. [indecipherable]",
        "A: So it wasn\u2019t all -- it wasn\u2019t all terrible. It was -- it was pretty terrible.",
        "Q: It was really pretty terrible. But tell me something, the people who didn\u2019t have -- to go\nback to the more terrible again, you know, that\u2019s quite a story. The people who didn\u2019t\nhave guns -- the kids didn\u2019t have guns, elderly, they didn\u2019t have guns for everybody.\nWhat was going to be their situation, if God forbid, you were surrounded, and you\ncouldn\u2019t get out? Were you going to shoot people?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t going to do that?",
        "A: No, no, positively not, positively not. I cannot tell you that every single person in our\ngroup had guns. Sometimes guns were taken away from the rightful owner, if you send\nout a group for a serious mission. But in most cases, you know, to take away a gun from a\nperson who ha -- the gun was everything that one could dream of. You couldn\u2019t -- you\ndidn\u2019t dream of gold, you didn\u2019t dream of diamonds, you -- you dreamt of getting a gun\nwith bullets. This was the only thing. But I can tell you that after the 23 months, when the\nRussian army advanced, the [indecipherable] army advanced, and I remember that the\nfirst battalion who encountered us was an -- a battalion commanded by an Ukrainian\nmajor. And he ordered that we surrender the weapons, we had to surrender the weapons.\nThis was an accepted -- and he said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d And we told him we are partisans,\nand we are Jews. So he says, \u201cJews? Jews fight in Tushkient on the -- on the black\nmarket.\u201d This was the greeting, you know. And this told me that I have nothing to look\nfor in the Soviet Union, and I better go home. And when I came home, I found an empty\ntown, 11 people left alive.",
        "Q: Of the whole town?",
        "A: Yeah. And told by some of my people that I knew from before the war, \u201cMiles, you better\nget out of here, because if you won\u2019t get out, they\u2019 ll finish you off.\u201d And I did.",
        "Q: So, insofar as you know, how many of these 300 people of your group came out, do you\nthink?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t three, it was about 250 - 260. I would say 150 for sure, if not more.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. If not -- yes.",
        "Q: And did you simply disperse?",
        "A: We -- when -- once the weapons were taken away from us, and once -- you know, we\nfollowed the army -- some immediately volunteered into the Soviet army.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Some of them, like I, wanted to go back to our hometown. And some of them, it settled in\n-- in Lvov, or settled in -- in -- in Vlochov, or -- or what have you. It was everybody for --\nfor his own, but let me say this to you. I hope you will understand me right. Most of the\npeople that I am talking about were villagers, because the -- the -- the cr\u00e9me de la creme\ndid not survive. They did not survive not because they were creme de la cr\u00e9me, they were\ntoo soft. They didn\u2019t know how to -- you know, to resist, and -- and what have you. So,\nwhen the war was over, everybody seeked his own level, his own intellectual level, his\nown level. I must tell you that my sense for admiration and love, and you know, and\ncamaraderie with these people, that whenever they have a simfeh, you know what that is,\na -- a Bar Mitzvah, or a wedding, or a [indecipherable], or a funeral, of people that I was\nin the forest with, no matter how I busy -- I -- busy I am, it gets right out, and I\u2019m there.\nSpecial feeling. There\u2019s a spe -- there -- I have people in [indecipherable] you know, we\nare better than family. Do I have a lot in common with them? Frankly no. You understand\nwhat I am saying?",
        "Q: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: But, what difference does it make?",
        "Q: But there\u2019s something else. There\u2019s something else.",
        "A: It\u2019s much more -- it\u2019s much important, much stronger.",
        "Q: And how have you been able to be in touch with each other? I mean, what was -- what\nenabled you all to find that you were in Vineland, or this one was --",
        "A: Well, when --",
        "Q: -- did you know each other\u2019s last name, I mean, how di -- did you know each other --",
        "A: In some cases yes, and in some cases, no. In some cases yes, and some cases no. I\u2019II tell\nyou the truth, I meet sometimes some women 1n particular that were young girls, were\nchildren in camp, I don\u2019t remember them. They remember me, but I don\u2019t remember\nthem.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: You know, because I was always active, you know, I was always, you know, leaving, and\nyou know, in one form or another.",
        "Q: Did you have, in the camp, a sor -- a semblance of a little school for kids? Did somebody\nteach --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- no",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So no one did that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. In the ghettos, yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: In -- in -- in the ghettos, even if it was illegal, there were secret schools.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But in the forest, no. Songs.",
        "Q: You did sing?",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh yes.",
        "Q: And did -- was there some religious observance of holidays? I ne -- know that you talked\nabout Yom Kippur, but --",
        "A: Only -- only high holidays. Only important holidays. You know, and frankly, you know,\nthose were days when young people had very little feeling for religion.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: If anything, it was anger and bitterness.",
        "Q: So it got worse, it got [indecipherable]",
        "A: Anger and bitterness, simply wa -- if there is a God, why is he permitting it?",
        "Q: Right. Now, some -- someplace you said that water was a more difficult problem of yours\nthan food.",
        "A: By all means. By all means. Food, first of all, you can go three, four days without food,\nand you will live. You can\u2019t go three, four days without water, and function. You get\ncrazy. And when the Germans tried to encircle us, and bombard us, they kept pushing us,\npushing us, and one time we were not aware of wh-where we are retreating, and we\nretreated on an elevation. It was almost like a mountain. This was not a mountainous\narea, but you know, at -- a high elevation. And we were without water. And we were\nwithout water for two and a half, three days. And I can tell you I remember seeing people\nurinate and drink it. And -- you know, and we were told not to do it, that this can create\ninsanity, you know. And finally we came to recognize that this is a very bad situation,\nthat we will tr -- we will die, not being killed, but die. And we broke through. Meisel was\nat that time the commander, you know, when I -- and I joined up with his group, and we\nbroke through, and we lost two people, and we got out of this area. But water is a terrible\n-- och, thirst, I can\u2019t begin to tell you how vicious it is. You know, you -- your tongue\ngets parched.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re in situations where water is not free flowing, so how was it that you took care\nof water, even when you weren\u2019t being [indecipherable |",
        "A: There were streams.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: There were streams, and I-look, we were not that finicky, you know, that it must be\nboiled, and this and that. There were streams, and if not, we used to go and bring water,\nand carry water, keep a -- keep a -- you know, a bucket, or a bowl, and you know, the --\nthe living conditions were very primitive, very primitive. We washed ourselves, we\n[indecipherable] a lot, you know, whenever we came to water, you know, we used to\nshave our armpits, and our pubicle, you know, and make sure that -- we used to use\nkerosene for instance, you know, to prevent -- there is -- I don\u2019t know how to call it in\nEnglish, it\u2019s a -- an insect that buries itself in the human skin.",
        "Q: Lice, lice.",
        "A: No, not lice.",
        "Q: No, not lice. Something else. Ticks?",
        "A: Mende.",
        "Q: Mende?",
        "A: Mende veshkey.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you would shave pubic -- women and men would do this in order to -- to be\nclean?",
        "A: Right. The pubicles, and the armpits.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And sometimes even the hair. Hair not so much.",
        "Q: So sometimes you would shave the head?",
        "A: If it was badly infected, yes.",
        "Q: And what was the effect? This was itching, and [indecipherable]",
        "A: Drove you crazy.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Drove you crazy. And the only way how to get it out is by squeezing one at a time.",
        "Q: So did that mean other people would come to you and they would squeeze like -- like\nmonkeys?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. These we --",
        "Q: Do y -- go ahead.",
        "A: These were pretty days, but they were not pretty days.",
        "Q: No. Do y -- you know, I don\u2019t know that [indecipherable] that anybody can answer this\nquestion, but d-do you, when you look back on who you were before you escaped and\nbecame part of the resistance, and then who you are afterwards, do you s -- do you come\nback to sh -- Shmul?",
        "A: To Shmoil?",
        "Q: To Shmul, or is -- is -- 1s this person a very different person?",
        "A: No, no, I -- you -- a person never becomes a totally different person. A person broadens\nhis horizons so becomes more tolerant or less tolerant. Becomes nicer, or becomes uglier,\nbut a person doesn\u2019t change. I believe that people are what they are, and they remain\nwhat they are. Did I go into the underground knowing that I will survive for 23 months?\nNo, didn\u2019t expect it. But as I told you, I wanted to make sure that whoever wants my hat,\nwill pay for it, and pay for it dearly. Now, this sounds like bombastic talk, you know, and\nI don\u2019t want to be bombastic with you. The struggle for survival was purely natural,\nalmost animalistic. Almost animalistic. Human nature is to survive. Let a plane fly by and\nstart dropping bombs, you know, you will be the first one to run, and I will be the first\none to run. This is human nature. But to come back to the question that you are asking\nme, whether this changed me, oh yes, it made a tremendous impact on me. I grew up ina\nhome, in a gentle home, and a respectful home, and a -- a soft home. You know what I\nmean by a soft home? And the experiences, and they were experiences that were pretty\nugly, pretty ugly. All kinds of things. And yet, there were moments of glory, and\nmoments of feeling proud. Now, I told you a minute ago that I don\u2019t want to sound\nbombastic, and I am not a deeply religious man, but I truly believe that 1t was almost\ndestiny, if there 1s such a thing, that put me in this path, and I am very, very grateful that I\nhave the opportunity to do the work that I am doing, because it gives meaning, it gives\npurpose. Do I go back to the days of Shmoil? Very often. And not necessarily in sadness,\nsometimes --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- in glory, sometimes in happiness. But I go back to the days of Shmoil. I think of my\nmother very, very often. Very often.",
        "Q: And when you think of your mother, you see -- feel yourself as Shmul?",
        "A: Yes, because it\u2019s connected. And of course, with mother I was in the difficult days also. I\nam more -- father died a natural death, so whether he was young, or whether he was old,\nit\u2019s immaterial, he died a natural death. Nobody robbed him from us. My mother, my\nsister was robbed from me. That was taken by force. My sister\u2019s children, wonderful kids,\nwonderful kids, but so were others, you know. I\u2019m not an exception with that. So there\nwere days of feeling very depressed, and very down, and very almo -- n-no pity. No pity\non each other. No pity on myself, but just days when it got to you. And days when we\ncame back from a mission and it was successful, days of glory. When I came back from\nthis village that night, I felt so good, I can\u2019t begin to tell you.",
        "Q: Did you sleep well that night?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. There are people that say, \u201cHow can you talk about it, when you took\nsomebody else\u2019s life?\u201d I say, \u201cThis is taking the life of a -- of a -- of a creature that had\nno right to be on this earth.\u201d Because 1f we wouldn\u2019t have done what we had done, there\nwould be other women and children.",
        "Q: Right. Did you also have nightmares?",
        "A: Still do.",
        "Q: You still do? And the content of those nightmares?",
        "A: There -- they\u2019re crazy.",
        "Q: What, being chased, or --",
        "A: Being chased, fighting, and you know, running and not making any distance, and you\nknow, trying to load the -- the -- I had the Russian peppashah, with the round disk.",
        "Q: What\u2019s a peppashah?",
        "A: It\u2019s a hand gish -- a hand -- a --",
        "Q: Oh, oh, oh, a handgun? Yeah.",
        "A: -- a automatic handgun that I -- that th -- the disk is full, and I can\u2019t load it in, and all\nkinds of things.",
        "Q: And are those the same kinds of dreams you had when you were in the forest?",
        "A: Dreams are dreams, you don\u2019t make an appointment to have a dream. Dreams take you\nback 30 years, 40 years, two days, an hour ago, you know, and it gets all mixed up, you\nknow. But I am active at night, very active. Ask Chris, she\u2019Il tell you. I talk, I talk\nRussian, I talk Polish, I --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. I yell.",
        "Q: Are you rested in the morning?",
        "A: Sometimes.",
        "Q: But sometimes it\u2019s just exhausted you. Tell me something Miles, or Shmoil, when you\nwent back -- I now don\u2019t know exactly what to call you, when -- when you went back to\nTomashev, and you realized that your family is gone, and the town, essentially is a\ncemetery --",
        "A: It was a very painful moment --",
        "Q: Did you --",
        "A: -- very painful moment. I -- believe it or not, but in the forest, I did not think about the\nfact that our people are being annihilated. I thought about fighting, about surviving, about\nkilling as much as I could, you know, to come out on the top of it. When I came into\nTomashev, and I saw the town, it was a cemetery. I felt that I\u2019m walking on tombstones. I\ndidn\u2019t need that friend to tell me to leave because I am in danger, because you know,\nthere were many, many people that came back, including Chris, you know, that came\nback, and you know, the extreme -- the extreme right wingers took care of them.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t need it, I -- I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t breathe the air there, I -- I choked. You know,\nit was a beautiful community. It was a community that offered everything that cultural\nlife and a cultural society has to offer. Everything, you know, in all these old-fashioned\ntraditions. When you -- at that time when I looked at them, they sounded silly, you know,\nto marry off a -- a -- a nitwit, you know, with another nitwit, they -- you know, it was\nsilly. Today when I think about it, I look how beautiful it was. How beautiful, how\ngenerous it was. How humane it was, you know. In a community where, you know,\ntraditions prevailed, and even the transition from, you know, Orthodoxy, and from piety,\ninto modern -- into modern life, 1t was not a transition from piety and from scholarship to\nbecome heedens, you know, it is embracing a broader culture. Embracing, you know, a --\na greater set of values, although the set of values, I have never taken for granted, and I\nnever give them up. The values that come with the life that was, are so exceptional, and\nso dear, and so extra special. You understand that it -- you -- sometimes I feel that I -- I\nshouldn\u2019t be talking, I should soak this up and swallow it. Because this is my -- this is my\ninner Shmoil. Just swallow it, because not everything you can put on the table.",
        "Q: What does that mean for you to say swallow it? So that 1t becomes --",
        "A: Internalize it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And --",
        "A: Internalize it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because either it sounds that you are, you know, bathing and -- and -- and -- and you\u2019re\nwallowing in the ho-horribleness, or bathing in false worry, and neither is the case.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let\u2019s stop the tape now, please.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: Miles, when you decided to leave Tomashev, which was wi -- did you stay just a few\ndays?",
        "A: Few days.",
        "Q: Mm. How did -- how did you decide the next step? Where w -- where were you going to\ngo?",
        "A: These were times when you didn\u2019t plan ahead, you play -- you planned for the day, you\nknow. All I knew is that I cannot remain in Tomashev, that you know, th -- I -- I will\nhave nightmares, and then in particular since I was warned to leave, so I felt I had to\nleave. So I went into Lublin. And in Lublin, this was the time where the first Polish\ngovernment was forming. You know, if you -- you ro -- you remember, the Poles divided\nup in Russia into two, it was an [indecipherable] army that went through Teheran, Israel,\nyou know, and they stayed and fought on the side of the allies, and there was the -- the --\nI have a -- a blank mind on the name of ma -- th -- the women. There was a Polish unit, a\nPolish army that fought -- decided to come into Poland, to liberate Poland with the Soviet\narmy, and help establish a -- Vonda Rosherefska, it was her name -- and to help establish\na new Polish regime, a Socialist regime, so to say. So Lublin became a very viable place,\nand -- and since in particular this was a time when people came back from every camp,\nfrom every corner, you know, and they were looking to find out whether someone 1s alive\nor not. So it became a very viable Jewish center. And I wanted to be there, hoping that\nmaybe I\u2019ll find something out about my sister, about her children. About Mother I didn\u2019t\nhave much hope, because I -- you know, I didn\u2019t think even if she wouldn\u2019t been killed,\nthat she would have survived these horrors. And I settled myself in, I got an apartment,\nand -- and I needed to make a living, so I got into partnership with Leon Fellheldner.\nFeldhandler is the -- one of the two commanders of the death camp of Sobibor, that have\nbroken out. It was Sasha Alexander Petroski --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and Leon Feldhandler. Leon Feldhandler was a son of a rabbi of a small town called\nIshbitza, not far from Tomashev. And we became partners in -- in selling soft leather,\nbecause this -- his area was an area where they -- where they were producing, you know,\nthey were treating hides, and converting it to leather. And one night -- he was not active\nin any politics or anything, one night Polish extremists entered the house where he was,\nand killed him. Now, there were many killings after the war, you know that. But this\nkilling was so painful in particular for the role that he has played. Here is a man, the son\nof a rabbi, who was able to enter a role of leadership in uprising, in rebellion, and revenge\nin a death camp. And to come out of it, and then be killed when he was hoping to start\nbuilding his own life, a new life, very painful, very bitter. So we stayed in po -- in Lodz --\nin Lublin for -- oh, I would say, three, four months.",
        "Q: After his -- he was killed?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t afraid for yourself?",
        "A: Where -- where was I to go? Where was I to go? You lived under -- you -- you lived, you\nknow, with circumstances. You --",
        "Q: Tell me something, did you two talk about each of your experiences? Did he talk about\nSobibor?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. Yes, yes. A lot.",
        "Q: And did he -- he describe the -- the -- the -- the uprising, did he describe what was going\non in Sobibor to you?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: What kind of a guy was he?",
        "A: He was a marvelous man. He was a marvelous man. He was a learned man. He -- he --\nthere -- he wasn\u2019t religious any more. This war, this experience turned him off, but a\nscholarly type of a guy, but not a scholar. He was a -- an every day guy, and a good guy,\na good looking man. And he started dating a girl, she was a beautiful, beautiful girl, and\nwhen he was assassinated, she had a nervous breakdown. She wound up in an institution.\nWhat happened to her later, I don\u2019t know. But I left Lublin, and went to Warsaw, but in\nWarsaw you couldn\u2019t stay anywhere, because all of Warsaw was destroyed. So, it -- it\nwas a rebel -- a rubble. So we went to Lodz. Lodz was not destroyed.",
        "Q: And who\u2019s we?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. No, it was I, for the time being. It is in Lodz where I met Chris.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No. You see, because I am thinking of Lodz, I am beginning to think in terms of we. No,\nto Lodz I came by myself. I mean, I had friends, I had people that I dealt with. You know,\nthere was Reuben Russet who was in -- in Brazil, you know, that we tried to get out of,\nyou know, and tried to regroup, and reconstitute, and -- and do something with our lifes.\nAnd I met Chris --",
        "Q: How did you meet?",
        "A: I owned a restaurant.",
        "Q: A restaurant? You got to Lodz and you opened a restaurant?",
        "A: A nightclub.",
        "Q: A nightclub, really?",
        "A: With dances, and with music, and with food.",
        "Q: Well, before you meet Chris, tell me how this happened.",
        "A: I had to do something.",
        "Q: Well, I know, but this is a -- this 1s really very different from anything you\u2019ve done\nbefore.",
        "A: It started off that, you know, there was a need for places to eat, because no one had\nhouseholds, everybody came in, you know. So Reuben Russet, my friend, said, \u201cLet\u2019s\nopen a restaurant.\u201d I said, \u201cLet\u2019s open a restaurant.\u201d So we opened a restaurant.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it went off very well, you know, it -- you know, it was good, you know.",
        "Q: Who was cooking?",
        "A: We hired people.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t cook. He -- he shopped.",
        "Q: He shopped?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you ran it?",
        "A: I ran it, but then we discovered that in the back of the restaurant is a big hall that used to\nbe something, I don\u2019t know what. So he turns to me, and he says, \u201cThis would be very\ngood for a dance hall.\u201d So we combined it, and we called it Little Hell.",
        "Q: Little Hell.",
        "A: Pigelko. And it was quite good. So Chris, with her sisters, came back from -- you know,\nfrom being liberated and sent to Germany.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She came back and -- and, you know, she found her uncle --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- who was in Lublin.",
        "Q: You mean Lodz?",
        "A: In Lodz, excuse me. And we -- and one night she came with a -- a friend of hers from\nbefore the war, that he took her out for -- th -- he wanted -- basically he wanted her to\nhave dinner, and she didn\u2019t want to eat, she was too proud to tell him that he -- that she is\nhungry. So she said she ate before she came.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. She was gorgeous. She was gorgeous looking girl. And I -- I was a good dancer, so\nI asked -- I asked her partner whether I can invite her to dance, and of course, he said yes.\nAnd we danced a lot that night, and we got to know one another, and we kept on knowing\none another for awhile. And she brought me up once to a gathering of people that were in\ncamp together -- you know, probably this story from her testimony, and I came up and\nsome of her friends said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t marry him. He -- he is not for you, he is too -- too\nsmart, too -- too -- too -- too slick.\u201d",
        "Q: Really? This I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: And -- however, I liked her a lot and she liked me, and her uncle liked me a lot. Hanya\nwas for me, Rainya was against me.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And we got married, and I\u2019ll tell you something about getting married. Ev -- everything\nhas a story.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: We were in Warsaw. We went in to see a couple of friends of hers with whom she was in\ncamp together. And walking the street I come across Rabbi Kahanna, who was the chief\nrabbi of the Polish army. He was -- he had the rank of colonel, I think, at that time. And\nhe was in Lvov, the professor that taught me Hebrew literature. And he was very happy\nthat he saw me, and I was delighted to see him, because he came back from Russia with\nthat -- the advance for the Polish army. So I told him, I say, \u201cProfessor,\u201d [indecipherable],\nI don\u2019t know how to translate it, but Sir Professor, you know. \u201cChris and I are getting\nmarried, and I would very much like you to give us,\u201d -- you know, \u201cto perform the\nceremony.\u201d And he thought for a moment, and he said, \u201cI\u2019Il do it.\u201d Joan, this was the first\nmarriage in Lodz performed by a high ranking officer of the Polish army, my professor,\nTed [indecipherable], it was a modern -- it was not like the old rabbis, you know,\n[indecipherable] around three times, and you know. It -- it had meaning, his sermon had\nmeaning, you know. He talked about what we have just gone through, and what we are\nfacing, and you know, how the future needs to be looked. It was a very meaningful --\nvery, very meaningful marriage ceremony. Very meaningful. And I managed -- I\nmanaged to establish myself, and with -- I dealt with all kinds of things. Among the most\nimportant thing is I have established a contact with the Polish government where they\nwere paying the raberats with [indecipherable] you know, before war prices, and for\nprices from before war, you couldn\u2019t -- a cookie, you know, cost as much as a day\u2019s\nwork. So I made a proposition to him, I say, \u201cI will supply you food for the workers, on\npre-war prices, because you must pay them in pre -- 1n -- but you don\u2019t pay me in dollars,\nor in zloty, but you pay me in goods, in textile goods.\u201d",

        "A: So I got textile goods for pre-war prices, and I supplied him with pork belly, with -- with\nonions, with beans, with all kinds of stuff. And all I needed 1s an official document from\nthe Polish government, that I am buying that stuff for the use of the Polish government,\nbecause I bought this on the black market, I bought it on the prevailing prices of after the\nwar. So I bought it for -- for black market prices, sold it for har prices, and got in return,\ntextile on har prices, that I could sell on the open market and not be afraid that it will be\nconfiscated, be -- I -- I don\u2019t think I -- I -- yo -- you are with me, I probably confused you\nby now.

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This is the important thing. And things were going very well, until some local guy I was\nready to load up a -- a boxcar with pork belly, and attach it to a passenger train to take it\ninto Lodz, and he stopped me, and I gave him the documents, and he said, \u201cI need to\ncheck them out.\u201d He was a bureaucrat. And in the meanwhile the pork belly was standing\nwith 90 degrees outside, and maggots start crawling over it, and I needed to hire people,\nand pay them to bury it. And also, the government was a little uncomfortable, and they\nstarted to distance themself from it. To make the story short, I had to stop this. This was a\nvery, very profitable business, I started making money. And again I was told, it\u2019s time for\nyou to move on.",

        "A: I\u2019m sure of it.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s interesting because her version is that she thought she would be a fifth wheel\nonce you got married, once you were together with Chris, and you said to her, \u201cNo,\nyou\u2019re not -- you\u2019re not leaving us, you'll stay with us, until you\u2019re ready.\u201d",

You ask me how come -- you asked me before, did I fall in\nlove with Chris immediately. Of course. She was a beautiful girl, and when I started\ntalking to her, I saw the roots, you know, that wa -- became very obvious, because the\nwar was over, you know. You were not looking for partisans. You were looking for a life\ncompanion, you know.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] yeah, it\u2019s different.",
        "A: Of course, the criteria was different, and she was the right person. I regret deeply that I\nnever met her mother, because she was a very, very unusual, very special human being.\nOf the stories that I heard about her, you know, so --",

        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. And we left in February of 1947, we left for America.",

I keep getting raises, and\nraises, you know I\u2019Il wind up working for him. I don\u2019t want to work for anybody. I want\nto be in business for myself.\u201d You know, so he was a very nice person, you know. He\nwas an importer of Italian olive oil, and provolones, and you know, a lot, shiploads, very\nlarge import, and I was in charge of his warehouse. And I quit, and I was going to start\nlooking what I\u2019m going to do, and I visited a friend in Vineland, and it was springtime,\nand it was green, and it was beautiful, and serene, and I liked it. And I said -- this was the\ntime when Jewish Agricultural Society helped the survivors settle themselves in on -- on -\n- you know, on farms. And I applied, and they approved it, and I bought a farm, and I\nfarmed for about -- \u00b048 - 49 -- about four years. And -- but I realized that this is not for\nme, and you know, I\u2019m not going to spend my life being a farmer, so I established myself\nin the fuel oil business, in the heating business, and from it I got into the gasoline\nbusiness, and the gasoline business is where I really made my business career in the\nUnited States.",

        "A: I -- I enjoyed doing it because I was my own boss. But I did recognize that, you know,\nfarming is a lifestyle, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not our -- it\u2019s not a vocation, it\u2019s not a business, it\u2019s a\nlifestyle. It was not my lifestyle. I, you know, lived in Vineland, and I organized the\nfarmers. I formed the Jewish Poultry Farmer\u2019s Association.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. And -- but I got out of it, and let me say this to you. Ever since I came to the States,\nI always was active in something. Even in Berlin yet, you know, I was active, you know,\nin organizing [indecipherable] and -- and acting in unison, making us, you know, a more\ndecisive factor, and so on, and so on. And I was very active in [indecipherable] you\nknow, from day one, I was very active in our town, [indecipherable]. And Yets\nGreenberg was the first one in America who organized a -- a small group called the Hora,\nto remember. And I became part of that, and when Carter asked [indecipherable] to\norganize, and -- organize a -- a group of people, and come back to him with a proposal as\nto what we are recommending as a means of remembrance of the Holocaust, I was invited\nto be on the advisory board, because it was too late already, to get into the original board.\nBut a few months later, when the cun -- the United States Holocaust Memorial Council\nwas organized, I was appointed by Carter to the council.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Is history. Let -- let me -- and -- and for those people who don\u2019t know, who are watching\nthis tape, there is a very long interview with you about your work with the museum, so\npeople wouldn\u2019t be deprived of that. But I -- I want to know when you first contacted\nJonah, and when you found out about your sister, and your brother being alive. At what\npoint --",
        "A: Good question. Jonah I contacted immediately when I came to Lodz, because I learned --\nI knew that he is alive because he was in Palestine, but I got his address. And there were\npeople that came back from Siberia, the resettlement was a prolonged process.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That told me that my brother is in the southern republics, in Toshkint, and my sister is in -\n- somewhere in Siberia, I don\u2019t remember now the name. But I got both addresses, and I\nwrote them letters to tell them that Mother is gone, and Esther is gone with her family,\nthat I am the only one alive. And my brother send me the address of -- Froma send me the\naddress of Jonah. This is how it worked.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "A: And they came back here, and -- and unfortunately they came at a time when I was\npacking rather rapidly to get out of Poland. So they followed to Germany, and --",
        "Q: They did?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: No, Peshe came to Israel.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And Shlomo remained in Germany because he had a son-in-law who developed a very,\nvery serious case of Parkinson. And L-dopa was very restricted in the United States,\nwhere in Germany, you know, they gave it out rather freely. And so he was stuck in\nGermany. And he died there.",
        "Q: I see. And was he in -- in West Germany?",

        "A: No, we -- it -- when I came to -- to Israel, we met together, and then Jonah came here,\nand Jonah has a son, you know, a polio child.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: No, I -- I -- I think that 1-1f anything, maybe what I would like to talk more about, and\nyou were chastising me for stepping away from my personal story, I think that the world\nthat was, is not sufficiently known in America. And I think that we need to find ways and\nmeans of documenting it, of writing 1t down, of discussing it, and making it part of our\nheritage. The world that was, I -- I\u2019m talking about the pre-war Europe.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Has so much richness, so much positiveness, so much creativity. Again, let\u2019s not get\ncarried away with -- you know, with Don Quixote stories. There was a lot of poverty,\nthere was a lot of struggling, there was a lot of bitter life in the eastern European\ncountries. There were -- there was more poverty than richness. But you take the\ntraditions, you take even the -- the world that started crumbling, you know, the Hassidic\nworld, the ultra Orthodox world. A world, you know, that went back to the 19\" century,\nto the 18\" century. Even as they were being diminished in their importance and size, they\ncarried a crescendo, you know, of elevations, you know, that were fantastic, fantastic.\nAnd they were -- they were not the leaders, but perhaps they were the inspirers of those\nthat stepped in into new life, into modern life, and trying to become part of the civilized\nEurope, playing a very major role -- a very major role in civilizing Europe. Jews have\nplayed so many important roles, and paid such a handsome rent, wherever they lived, that\nwe cannot talk enough about it. But I\u2019m talking about a handsome rent, I am not talking\nabout money. I\u2019m talking about contributions that are made in the field of science, in the\nfield of arts, in the field of judicial -- judicial progress in organization. You take the\ncountries, you know, first of all, of course, the ones on the front [indecipherable] Kalitsia\nwas ripe for it because they encouraged. They were more liberal, and they were receptive\nto Jewish involvement. But even the -- you know, in the Soviet Union? You take the\nperiod when the Soviet Union came to be, and you go through the leaders, and you will\nsee that the people that really, you know, introduced Communism to the world, with a\ndream that they are carrying a better tomorrow, were Jews. You take Germany, the\nWeimar Republic, and study it, and who were they? Jewish intellectuals. You take the\ncreation, the -- the -- the -- the writers, and -- and -- and poets, and philosophers of\nHungary, of Czechoslovakia, you know, of -- of -- of Germany, and it moved to Poland,\nand it came from Poland -- you know, I mentioned to you Vilno before, Vilno was a\ncenter not only of modern Jewish literature, a very strong center. Vilno was also a --\ncenter not far from Vilno, the [indecipherable] the great [indecipherable] scholarship that\nhave set levels for the Jewish people, of world -- world prominence. World prominence.\nWe d -- we made a bad mistake 1n my opinion. In building the museum, you know, we\nhave done many wonderful things, but we made a bad mistake by not going down two\nstories deeper, and allowing space for telling the story of the world that was. We must do\nthat. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s something that we missed. You can\u2019t understand the importance of today\nunless you are capable of evaluating and giving credit, and discredit, whatever comes, to\nthe world that was. It was a beautiful life, of Jews that struggled, didn\u2019t have it easy, but\nin spite of this, you know, what they have done, what they have done for Poland.",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you more than you know for today.",
        "A: Don\u2019t thank me.",
        "Q: And I think that you -- maybe you don\u2019t realize that what you just said really fits with the\nstory that you told about your family, and your parents. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, if I have done that, then I am re -- very pleased.",
        "Q: I think you have. And thank you so much.",
        "A: Thank you. You said something about photograph?",
        "Q: And who are these folks here?",
        "A: This is a friend of mine on the left side, the blonde fella, his name is Hooberman, and we\nwere members of a youth club, it was called shamare atsyere, and in this club, we also\ncreated a -- a chess team. And here I am trying to be -- trying to beat him. I wasn\u2019t too\nmuch of a chess player, I wasn\u2019t too good at it.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re on the left?",

        "A: This is the group that I was telling you, the shamare atsyere group, and I -- some people\nthat are in this picture are no longer with us. I am embarrassed to tell you that a good\nmany of them I don\u2019t remember the names any more.

And I dressed up in my best, and took my mother out to -- you know, to visit places\nin -- in Lvov. The picture on the right is my mother, I think it\u2019s -- the picture is taken a\nlittle later than this one. Probably \u201939, maybe. It looks to me like this was a picture taken\nfor a passport, and we lodged it, I think so. You notice that Mother is wearing a wig,\nMother was a pious woman, very religious woman, but a fantastic, fantastic achiever.\nGreat lady.",
        "Q: And this photo?",
        "A: This photo is a photo of myself right after the war, when I came out from the\nunderground, and I came to Lvov, and I took the first picture for a kankarta -- for -- for a\npassport. And at that time I -- I weighed the least that I remember myself, 140 some\npounds.",

And she comes from a beautiful family\nand I regret very much that I didn\u2019t have an opportunity to get to know her family, and\nI\u2019m sure that if my mother would have known her, she would have loved her just as\nmuch.",
        "Q: And the top picture?",
        "A: The top picture is a picture of me on the marine perch, as we are entering the harbor in\nNew York, after a crossing that lasted 16 days from ha -- Hamburg to New York.

But being friendly with the\ntownship judge did not mean that the township judge invited my father for dinner, or my\nfather invited the judge for dinner.

Most of my friends were Jewish, and\nwe -- for instance, I\u2019d mentioned to you sports clubs. We had a Harpoyle and a Macarbie,\nthese were two s -- Jewish sports clubs. And sometimes we participated in -- in soccer\ngames where there was a representation of our town, then they were from the Polish\nsports clubs, and from our clubs. But I always -- we always felt that we are Jewish.",
        "A: We always felt that we are Jewish.",
        "A: Well, no, we discussed it, but let me say this to you. We -- first of all, we kind of felt that\nwe are intellectually superior to -- that -- you know, the object of study and working hard\nto learn more, was more, you know, in the province of Jewish life, because Jews always\naimed for being more educated, because Jews felt that the only way, the only thing that\nwill bring them into society is, you know, by being educated well, or being better\neducated. You know, for instance, for a Jew to be accepted to high school, he had to have\nmuch better grades, and had to be much better prepared than a non-Jew. So th -- are you\nasking me whether they were killing Jews every day? No. You know, we li --",
        "A: We lived in our town, we knew that we are different, we -- first of all, we knew that we\nare different, we had to be different because wi -- I couldn\u2019t eat, you know, because my --\nmy -- my parents would know that I had dinner with my non-Jewish friend in their house,\nthey would be heartbroken.",
        "A: I wanted to be the same --",
        "A: -- I did not like the fact that we were identified as them.",
        "A: I wanted to -- there to be us. And it was a gradual process.",
        "A: I recall two that were good friends, good friends, and I am certain that inasmuch as they\ncould have had problems of -- of us being friends, they were my friends. There were\nbullies that were looking for an opportunity to get a Jewish kid, you know, on the way\nhome from school, and beat him up, or push him, or bully him and what have you. They\nwould probably come to my help.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Self defense?",
        "A: Well, we had Jewish sports clubs, and bear in mind that this is what I\u2019ve been trying to\nbring out to you, that I lived in a period where young people desired to leave the beta\nmidrash, the yeshiva and to enter into modern schooling, you know, so in -- as a result of\nthis, we felt that we need to do everything that modern life has. Be active in sports, be\nactive in theater, be active in -- in debates, be active in -- in -- in discussions, and what\nhave you. So, as a result of this, what I\u2019m trying to bring out is that in the sports clubs,\nyes we studied self defense. You know, not karate or something like it, but first of all, we\nwere educated. You know, our organizational leaders. Don\u2019t let yourself, don\u2019t -- don\u2019t --\ndon\u2019t accept the fact that you are less, lesser, or weaker, or -- and what have you. And\nthen the immigration to Israel began when I grew up, and my brother, my youngest\nbrother, Jonah --",
        "A: -- who is here, after he served in the army, in the Polish army, because this was army in s\n-- serving in the army was by conscription. Right after he finished, he decided that he\nwants to go to Israel. And this for my parents was a big problem, because they went to\nthe rabbe, and the rabbe said, \u201c\u201cWhen the here will come, when the Messiah will come,\nwe'll all go to Israel.\u201d You know, my -- for instance, there were people who suggested to\nmy parents, you know, because as I mentioned to you, we were rather -- substantially,\nyou know, comfortable, wealthy, that we should buy a large parcel of land, or a building\nin Jerusalem. So it was customary in those days, that the Jews didn\u2019t do anything without\nsharing 1t with a rabbe -- not a rabbi, the rabbe. Do you know the distinction between one\nand the other? A rabbi --",
        "A: A rabbi -- a rabbi is a rabbi, a roof. A functionary in the community. The rabbe was the\nhead of the dynasty, of the rabbinic dynasty, this, you know [indecipherable]. So any\nmajor decision that Jews had to make, you know, like, you know, going abroad with, you\nknow, with a major investment, usually my father, or whoever it would be, would go to\nthe rabbe, and ask for a brucha, ask for a blessing, you know? And ask for his advice.\nAnd when my father came to the rabbe to tell him that Jonah wants to go to Israel, and\nthere are friends that are advising our parents to invest a substantial amount of money in\nIsrael -- in Palestine in those days, not Israel. So, the rabbe\u2019s answer -- the rabbe\u2019s answer\nwas, when Messiah will come, we will all go to Israel. Right now we should stay here,\nand we should serve God in a -- in a pious manner.",
        "A: Yes, he was the strongest revolutionary in the family.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: I missed him.",
        "A: I missed him very much. He was, you know, he was part of the aggressively, you know,\naggressive group that were asserting themselves, to make their way into modern society,\nand to accepting new ways. And most of all, going to Palestine, and building a -- you\nknow, a State.",
        "A: There ne -- there was no discussion about that. Everybody recognized it, including my\nparents, including people that -- my parents equals. We all recognized that anti-Semitism\nis escalating, and it\u2019s going to get worse, and something needs to be done. But no one, no\none, in his wildest dreams, has any idea what is coming.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Yes, as a matter of fact, I started in junior college, a Hebrew junior college in\nLvov, and my aim was to go to the University of Jerusalem to continue studies.",
        "A: It -- it -- well, bear in mind, it was the -- I had --",
        "A: -- high school, but the -- the school that I am talking about was a junior college, a Hebrew\njunior college, which was a combination of the -- of the leedselm, you know what\nleedselm is? The le -- this is the last two years of high school, and college.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right, right. And then came --",
        "A: -- ca -- and I came home in \u201938 when my father died.",
        "A: \"36.",
        "A: \"35 -- 36.",
        "A: Lvov was one of the largest cities.",
        "A: And it was a beautiful city, and my father\u2019s sister lived in Lvov, and they were -- when I,\nyou know, convinced them that I want to go to Lvov, and I want to study in Lvov, they\ncame to realize that they are fighting a | -- a losing battle. They didn\u2019t admit it, but they --\nthey realized it. So they figured at least let me be well educated, and you know, let\u2019s pick\nthe best of what is coming. And he had a sister in Lvov, so I lived with his sister, with an\naunt of mine.",
        "A: Oh yes, it --",
        "A: -- ma -- made a major impact on me. It was a cultural city, and it was a large city, and\nyou know, in the youth, it was a wonderful youth. There were wonderful Jewish\norganizations, and I was -- I was very, very fortunate that I spent two years in\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: It contributed a lot to the shaping of me as a young man.",
        "A: Again, I must repeat that this was a transitional period.",
        "A: And some of the people, you know, participated in it -- some of the young people, and\nsome of the young people didn\u2019t. But by and large, we were the avant-garde. For\ninstance, I was a member of the Shamare Atsyere. Shamare Atsyere was a leftist, you\nknow, very progressive organization, but intellectual. You know, they -- we -- hebr --\nknowing Hebrew was a must, otherwise you couldn\u2019t be a member of this organization.\nAnd they were to -- you know, my friends, boys and girls, you know, we -- whatever we\nwere unable to do at home, you know, and I mean the lifestyle, and even the reading, you\nknow, and what have you, it all took place in the organization, the organization shaped\nthe youth, you know. And it was -- it was a small town, but a small town that had all the\naspects of a developing community with -- in -- in -- in every manner. It -- it -- the -- to\ngive you some silly examples, there were two cars in our community. Two cars that were\nprivately owned. There were 30 telephones. 30 telephones in the entire community. And -\n- but there were many very fine institutions. For instance, there was a -- a loan society\nthat didn\u2019t charge interest.",
        "A: A loan society.",
        "A: To help people, you know, if they needed a transition from a difficult period. And this\nwas a wonderful institution. There was a Jewish bank, you know, that it was more of a --\nit was a bank, it -- it functioned as a bank, and it charged interest, but it was more a\nbeneficial society, you know. And so there were all kinds of organizations in town. There\nwere the -- you know, the typical divisions between the Betar, the Shabotinsky group,\nand Shamare Atsyere. You know, we were f -- yo -- the -- constantly fighting with one\nano -- not physically fighting, but discussing, and you know, and trying to mobilize and\nget more of the young people into our organization than into the other -- it was a major\nissue, you know. Where the one was a Revisionist, you know, Betar, over the one\n[indecipherable] Shamare Atsyere, it was a haloots, you know. All the organizations.",
        "A: The major por -- is the ideology of -- you know, of how we should conquer Palestine,\nand should -- should it be -- the Shabotinsky was a -- you know, a fabulous orator, and he\nfelt that, you know, the only way how to do it is by training Jewish youth to be physically\nable, and capable of handling weapons, and -- and what have you. And prepare like th --\nfight like the rest of the world is fighting. The Zionist organizations felt that 1t was an\nintellectual process. We need to educate young people, you know, we need to take them\naway from the Hassidic ways and methods of living, and bring them in -- into modern --\ninto, you know, Jewish philosophical debate, Jewish, you know, readings, Jewish\nclassics. Bear in mind that the Yiddish culture, the Yiddish [indecipherable] came to be\nwithin a period of, I would say 50 years, 60 years. You know, when you talk about\nShalomar [indecipherable] Farin -- are -- these names mean anything to you? You know,\nthese -- they all --",
        "A: Mandolere Mochais Farin.",
        "A: That -- he was one of the early ones, even before Shalomar Lachin, you know. So it was -\n- it was a -- a transformation in the making.",
        "A: You know, and I was very fortunate that I lived in that time, because it was a very\ncreative period. It -- you know, 50 years before that, there were no questions asked. A\nyoung man needed to go to the Yeshiva and sit, and study, and -- and be pious, and wear\nthe same attire that, you know, Jews were wearing. Not us. You know, we were already --\nwe were rebelling, and -- and I'll tell you a joke which will be reflective of this. Our way\nof demonstrating that we are progressive was, for instance, to walk around without hats,\nyou know. Not to have a cover. But you never dared to do it in the presence of your\nfather or your mother, because you would hurt them terribly. So I remember once\nwalking with a friend of mine on the -- you know, on the -- on -- on the street, and neither\none of us wore a hat, you know, because this was our way of expressing our rebellion.\nAnd suddenly his father came across, he didn\u2019t expect him, and he saw him without a hat.\nSo he says, \u201cWhy are you walking around without a hat, with a,\u201d -- you know, \u201cwith a\nbare head?\u201d So he said, \u201cI\u2019m hot.\u201d So he says, \u201cIf you\u2019re hot, why don\u2019t you take off your\npants?\u201d But it was a transitional period, and many of the young people of our town got\ninvolved in Zionist organizations. Quite a few went to Palestine, including of my brother,\nyou know. And some of them became very, very active in Jewish defense. Some of them\nbecame very active in Hagganah.",
        "A: Including of my brother.",

        "A: Oh, very much so.",
        "A: Yeah, that was part of the rebelling, you know, we were -- we were a group of kids, you\nknow, nice kids, good kids, and absolutely, in the dating, and -- and going steady, and\nkissing, and hugging, and -- and what have you.",
        "A: Oh sure.",

        "A: -- it was kids being together, but in the being together, it\u2019s like young people, you know.",
        "A: Without any question. I mean, we -- I would say that it was -- beginning with my\nbrother\u2019s generation, it was a constant transition from the old Hassidic, pious, you know,\nvery restricted manner, that the progress was made on opening the windows, and letting\nin fresh air.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes it was.",
        "A: No, Jewish young women and boys, that -- well, le-le-let me say this -- this to you, if you\nare referring to promiscuity, you -- if you -- if you went with a girl steady, you didn\u2019t\nwant her to --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: You may have desired it, but you know, if she was going to be your steady, you wanted\nher to be pure.",
        "A: So the dating was more in school, with non-Jewish girls, and --",
        "A: -- no dates, but --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right. Very, very seldom it happened with a Jewish girl. You know, th -- the -- these\nthings were taken seriously, it -- again, 1t depends when we are talking about. Are we\ntalking 1920, are we talking 1930?",
        "A: I was a baby.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: There is no question about it that by the time I grew up, and I was, let\u2019s say 15 - 16 years\nold, that our town, like many other towns were on a rapid path of transition.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t expect this.",
        "A: No one --",
        "A: -- no one expected it. Bear in mind that, you know, the -- the history was that Germany,\nin first World War, has occupied our -- the town where I lived. They -- they ran\noccupational force, but there was nothing, you know, that they would do to -- nothing.\nAnd another thing, the fighting -- the fighting took place on the front line. Once the front\nline moved 10 -- 10 kilometers, or 20 kilometers, that was the end of the fighting. So\ninstead of having the Russian -- the Russian police, or Polish police -- you know, you had\nGerman police, but --",
        "A: And -- but in 19 -- [indecipherable] let me say this to you, I mean, we all had radios, we\nordered newspapers, and we knew that in 1933, when Hitler came to power, that terrible\nthings are happening in -- in Germany. Terrible things are happening in Germany. In\nPoland, the Poles aped, you know, many of the things that were happening in Germany.\nThey started implementing laws, which were outright anti-Semitic. For instance, Jewish\nstudents that were in college, could not sit on the benches with the Poles, they had to be\non the left side. And those who didn\u2019t want to be on the left side, stood in the back. You\nknow, there were constant fights for, you know, equal rights, and -- and what have you.\nPoland was in the process of becoming a very, very anti-Semitic country.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It -- well, bear in mind that -- you know, that it -- the love for Jews was never there. You\nknow, if -- for instance, if you are talking about Poland was occupied, as you know from\nhistory, by Russia, Germany, and Austria. Austria was the only -- the only area where\nthey were liberal and progressive, and they treated the Jews very well, and gave them\nopportunity to enter schools, and study. The Russian occupation was very, very\noppressive. You know, the -- in the [indecipherable] they were, you know. And the\nGermans not as much, but w -- the Germans that we remembered were not Germans that\nwe were afraid of, but when you started seeing what Hitler is predicting, you know, and\nwe read Mein Kampf, and we knew --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Polish.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was frightening. We knew that terrible things are coming.",

        "A: -- and what have you.",
        "A: Discuss.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "A: Well, as far as war is concerned, yes we saw -- if -- 1t depends when. If you are talking,\nfor instance in 1934 - 1935, Hitler started his expansionary programs, you know, and he\nentered -- in 1938 he entered Austria, and he occupied Czechoslovakia, and\n[indecipherable] you know, from the French. It -- it was all coming, and it was coming\nrapidly, and it was very scary. But you want to know something? You just don\u2019t pick\nyourself up and go.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t that easy.",
        "A: In particular in those days. You know, some people, for instance, I met them after the\nwar, and I asked them, did they went in Palestine? Why did you leave? He said, \u201cWe\nknew what was coming. We knew that we have to build an independent home for the,\u201d --\nyou know, \u201cfor the -- the Jews.\u201d But on the other hand, in many cases people were, let\u2019s\nsay, the only one, and they were parents, they were not well, and what have you. Picking\nyourself up and leaving, and uprooting yourself is a major issue.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My brother was pleading. First of all, he -- he was more sensitive to the fact what\u2019s\ncoming, because the German Jews started coming into Israel.",
        "A: So he was more aware of it. There were Polish Jews that lived in Germany that were\npushed over the border, in the boneshin --",
        "A: -- for instance, you know there was a -- so for me to tell you that the onslaught of Nazism\ncame unexpectedly, I don\u2019t think I would be telling you actual conditions.",
        "A: It was coming in that we saw it coming, but none of us, none of us had any idea about\ntotal annihilation. We felt we are going to have a bad time, we are gonna be in for a very\ndifficult period, you know, something like, you know, the [indecipherable] in the end of\nthe 19\" century, maybe worse, you know. Believe it or not, but we were preconditioned\nto the fact that for one reason or another, destiny has designated a lot of suffering and\nstruggling for us, you know. And it -- it was a difficult time, but I don\u2019t want to talk to\nyou generalities, I want to talk to you specifics. Specifics is that in spite of all this, you\nknow, life had to go on, life had to function. And the community had -- it -- it was a\nmicrocosm. Tom -- Tomashev was a microcosm of the larger being.",
        "A: For instance, if you talk about Wilno, Wilno had a very, very active, you know, cultural\nJewish life, and you know, poets, and writers, you know, came out of there, 1t was that\nway. Wilno was described as Jerusalem of Lithuania. Or you talk about Warsaw. Warsaw\nwas the capital of Poland. And you also had the emergence of a labor organized\nmovement, a Jewish labor movement, the Bund, and the Communist party. The\nCommunist party consisted -- members of the Communist party came from different walk\nof life, they came from poor working class, came from very rich. Some of my very dear\nfriends, you know, and our parents were dear friends, they were members of the\nCommunist party. But it was a small group. The biggest group was the Bund. These were\nthe Jewish unions, so to say, unions.",
        "A: You know, that became part of a -- an organization. The Bund was not in favor of\nbuilding a home in Israel, the Bund was in favor of establishing our presence, and our\nlife, and our privileges in Poland, in th -- Lithuania, in Czechoslovakia, and they played a\nmajor role, because they did more than -- than -- than expressed -- you know formulated,\nyou know, ad -- and advocated the policy of fighting for our rights. They gave the Jewish\nlaborers a sense of pride, a sense of being something special, of being organized as a\nunion. It -- it [indecipherable] and, you know, Medem was the leader of the Bund, but\nthere were poets and writers, that were very much in favor of th -- very much siding, like\n[indecipherable] for instance, siding with the philosophy of the Bund, that we have to\nfight for our rights, for our existence in Poland. And there were designers that figured\nthat we are wasting our time, that the ti -- the place where to go and concentrate our\nefforts is Palestine, because this is the land -- you know, Hertzel was earlier, you know.",
        "A: But these were successions, and you know, it -- so what I\u2019m trying to say to you,\neverything that I am talking to you about, did not happen from the beginning of the year\nto the end of the year.",
        "A: It was a gradual succession.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I was a Zionist. The basic difference between the Bund, and the Zionist movement is\nthe Bund, A was a labor organization. Fought religion, because they felt that religion 1s --\nis opium for the masses. This used to be the slogan. And they fought -- they tried to ally\nthemselves with Socialists, and -- pol -- Polish Socialists, which were on the\n[indecipherable] there was an organization of Polish Socialists, and they tried to align\nthemselves with them. But if you ask me whether they were many wealthy Jewish people\nthat became part of the Bund, perhaps. You know, it -- it wa -- this wasn\u2019t a matter of\nwealth or poverty. By and large, you know, the Jewish people in Poland were poor\npeople.",
        "A: You know.",
        "A: They were a small percentage, you know, that emerged as people of substantial wealth.\nWas there a middle class? Perhaps, but --",
        "A: No, and -- and it -- the middle class that we are talking about is a pitiful middle class.\nMiddle class is where, you know, they scratched out a living, you know, and perhaps\nmaybe a little more, but by and large, the Jews were not wealthy.",
        "A: By and large as I described it to you, until the changes started coming about, the husband\nwas the one that was -- saw himself as the scholar, and he needs to study the Bible, and --\nand sit, and go to services three times a day, and -- and what have you. And the woman\nwas the one that sit in the marketplace, and sell some beans, or -- or -- or vegetables, or --",
        "A: -- or you know, herring, and a -- it -- it -- it was politic.",
        "A: I would have -- I would have graduated th-th -- the junior college, and I would have gone\nto Israel. I had the promise of my parents that they will permit --",
        "A: -- for this to happen, yes. Because, as I told you, 1t was my brother -- in particular my\nbrother, and my younger sister, that paved the way for me, that --",
        "A: -- you know, won some compromises from our parents. Our parents were very, very war -\n- religious, very religious. But smart, and worldly. They knew that the direction is. They\nrefused to accept it, but they knew that the direction is going the way we are going, you\nknow, to blend in, but no-not to get mixed in with society, but to be able that 1 -- study\nthe language. There were many Jews that spoke a very broken Polish.",
        "A: You know, a very broken Polish. And this was, no way, we -- we felt even if to stay in\nPoland, we must be part and parcel of the community as such. We must have our\nrepresentatives in parliament, we must educate our children in -- in we -- there\u2019s one\nthing I will want to tell you, that the Jews of the -- of Poland, and of Lithuania, had a\ntremendous sense for social justice. As I mentioned to you, they were loan -- a society to\nfree -- a loan free -- interest free society. They were, in those days, to give you another\nexample, they were -- to help a Jewish girl find a husband and get married was a big\nmitsveh. My mother was known that she always tries to find a match, you know?",
        "A: And she arranged the wedding.",
        "A: She arranged the wedding. But it was a sense of social justice, a sense of helping people.\nAnd this was not only my mother, there were all, you know, many people in town that did\nthat. There were many -- there were many customs there that need to be understood. For\ninstance, there were beggars that were going from town to town and stopped, and asked\nfor a fenegar, or a few pennies, and what have you. Friday night, they came to\nsynagogue. It was an established custom that the synagogue -- th -- the people that belong\nto the synagogue cannot go home without taking a noyrech, which means a guest. And --\nand he was seated at a table, you know, and he had Shabbas with us. Th-This was a very,\nvery noble thing to do. There was a place, it was called the hagdish. A hagdish was a\nplace -- a poor -- a -- a -- a -- a poorhouse, where these traveling beggars, you know,\nwhen they came, could come in and they got a bundle of straw, you know, and they could\nSleep. They didn\u2019t pay anything for it.",
        "A: This was done by the cultural society of the community, and by the gemeni, which was\nthe organized Jewish society, you know? We were of sorts, we always had a certain\ndegree of self rule, you know, between ourselves.",
        "A: To give you an example of self rule, if there was a dispute between two Jewish people,\nbetween two Jewish businessmen or what have you, it was customary not to go to court,\nbut to go to a dintorah. They went to a -- to a rabbi -- not a rabbe, a rabbi, this was the\nfunctioning, and they both presented their case, and -- and he pass judgment, and\nwhatever the judgment was, this was it. So what I\u2019m trying to say to you 1s, in the small\ntowns, and I\u2019m talking about Tomashev as a microcosm because the same thing applied\nto Zamosc, and it applied to Lublin, depending how large it was, and what particular part\nof economic life is in one place. If there were a lot of forests, there were sawmills, if\nthere was a lot of --",
        "A: -- if there was a lot of agriculturals, there were flour mills, you know, the mills were\nnormally settled, you know, in -- in -- in the areas where there were good col -- large\nagricultural, you know, teran -- terrains.",
        "A: Well, you\u2019re not -- my brother -- you\u2019re not -- didn\u2019t have it so easy.",
        "A: I had it easy.",
        "A: He paved the way for me.",
        "A: He paved the way for me. He\u2019s a wonderful guy, he just wrote a book, you know, that --",
        "A: Stone Pillars.",
        "A: You know, and --",
        "A: It\u2019s very interesting.",
        "A: Because, you know, he talks about a -- an aspect of life that is hardly known here.",
        "A: You know.",
        "A: For instance, you asked me a question before, how did you, interact, with your friends,\nwith your girls, and was there promiscuity, and what have you. Well, we were human\nbeings, you know? Kids and dogs, they s -- weren\u2019t any different than they are today. But\nthis difference that, you know, my predecessors had the fear of religion, you know.\nDating girls was not accepted, you know. So depends of the period that you are talking\nabout.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Of sorts, yes. First of all, 1t was a junior college, where Hebrew was a very major part of\nit. And the arrangement was that one who graduated junior college in Lvov, gained a year\nin the university, could enter on the second year of the university immediately. So this\nwas of sorts a program to make it easier for students who intended to study in the\nJerusalem University. It was cheaper, it was easier, they didn\u2019t have to leave home. So\nthis was of sorts an in -- an inducement.",
        "A: And the studies, they were -- they were the secular studies, the normal studies like\nanybody else, plus the Hebrew.",
        "A: Theoretically. The-theoretically. I\u2019m serious about it, th -- what you are talking about is a\ndifferent thing altogether, this was the kibbutzim.",
        "A: They were -- they were the people that young men and women, who were planning to go\nto Israel joined Hasharah, it was called, where they lear-learned to -- to plant, to cultivate,\nto chop woods, you know, and they -- the -- bear in mind that a good many of these\nyoung people grew up in -- in a non-physical world. Do you know -- am I expressing\nmyself?",
        "A: In -- it was the Hasharah where they were exposed to physical hardship. You know, they\nwere exposed -- first of all they were taught a love for the soil, a love for planting, and --\nand reaping. It was more than just a training school, it -- it was a training school in many\nways. It was a process of refurbishing, redoing the mentality of the young people.",
        "A: My favorite subject?",
        "A: History.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, history. I -- I -- I love history.",
        "A: I love history. When I -- when I read a historic novel, I don\u2019t read the story. I -- I like to\nunderstand the -- the surrounding of it, what made it, what brought it about, and how did\nit affect, you know, the outside of it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: If my father wouldn\u2019t have died, I had another year and a half to graduate the -- the -- the\n-- the seminar, what we called. And I would have gone to Israel, to the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Because, you see, my going to Israel was a two fold one. Number one, I wanted the\neducation, you know, as a Jew, because my brother influenced me a lot, and as a young\nman, when I look back today, I was a very -- he -- he -- he educated me. He brainwashed\nme, if you want to use this terminology. And I was a very ardent believer in th -- in -- in\nthe Jews have no choice, this is the only way, is to go to Israel, to Palestine, and build a\nhome. A -- a Jew -- build a Jewish homeland. Build a Jewish homeland. Now, I -- I\u2019m ke\n-- I\u2019m coming back to the Tomashev, and I ke -- use the terminology t -- a microcosm.\nTomashev was a very vibrant community, I have very fond memories of it, in every\npossible way. The fact that, you know, the doors opened for me, you know, culturally,\nhistorically, intellectually. I didn\u2019t sense it at that time. At that time I was excited with the\nissue of the day. I was excited with a soccer game that I participated in playing, or -- or a\nping pong game, or -- or what have you. And this was all -- you know, these were all\nthings that took us away from the synagogue, and took us to the outside.",
        "A: No, no. He was not. He had high blood pressure, and had the stroke, and he didn\u2019t come\nout of it.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. He was a very, very loving father. Very loving father. Di -- di -- no -- you\u2019re\nsmiling. The -- you have to look at life as it was. They were people that were bitter, and\nas a result of this became bitter with their children. They were bitter they had poverty,\nthey were bitter on their, you know, being persecuted as Jews, they were bitter that they\ndidn\u2019t marry right, because this was not a time where marriage was, you know, by a boy\nfinding a girl, 1t was matchmaking. All these things, you know, had played a role in how\nthe community functions. But I must tell you that my recollections of the community are\nvery good, because when I look back at it, you know, and I look at all these things, you\nknow, like making sure that no Jewish girl remains an alteh moid, an -- an old maid. You\nknow, very nice. It affected -- there was a poor house where a person could go in and go\nto sleep without any questions. Very nice, you know. It -- it -- 1t affected Friday night,\nthat no man could remain without being fed. These are things that, you know, speak to\nyou. They give you the quality, you know. And then I started -- I am coming back to the\nbreakthrough. Reading the poetry, bre -- reading Bialek, read -- reading, you know the\nChonyahofsky. I-It was a new world, and it was an exciting world. I remember we used\nto si -- recite by heart, you know, poems like [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable]\nthe city of Florida, you know, and what have you. So all in all, my recollections of those\nday, taking into consideration the restrictions, the constraints, and the situations as they\nwere, my recollections are good.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: A very big funeral. What I remember specifically, it was not customary in nower -- in\nthose days, that if a Jew died, that they should be necrolog -- necrology, it -- they should\nbe in -- in the paper, the -- you know --",
        "A: Obituaries. My father had three quarters of the paper full of obituaries from all over\nPoland. And this was not customary for -- well, for those days, for Jewish people.",
        "A: It was, it was.",
        "A: Very much so. Ver -- an Orthodox funeral. Th -- in those days it was customary that the\nbody was washed by a special group, and dressed in white linen, and he was carried from\n-- carried to the funeral -- to the cemetery.",
        "A: Not in a box.",
        "A: Carried -- he wa -- it was like a -- al -- it -- it -- 1 -- a -- a -- like hard tree boards, you\nknow, tied together, and it was an honor to carry the -- the ti -- the -- to carry the\ndeceased, you know. And people walked over, there were usually eight people that\ncarried them. And when he was -- when the -- the body was brought to the cemetery,\nthere were within -- within the grave, there were sideboards, but the Jewish law called for\nthat the body must -- the body must lay on soil. And this conflicted with the laws of\nPoland. The laws of Poland were that you had to be in a box. So what they did is they\nbuilt the -- the sideboards, and then -- and headboards, but before they started covering it,\nthey pulled the boards out. That\u2019s breaking the law, but they d -- what I\u2019m trying to say to\nyou, that a religious law, to Jews, prevailed, always prevailed.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes, there were, before it -- before he was put in the -- 1n the -- in the grave, but of a\nreligious nature.",
        "A: And my father was 56 years old.",
        "A: My mother was three or four years younger.",
        "A: You know, but my mother perished.",
        "A: In the Holocaust.",
        "A: It was a very difficult period. It affected us strongly, you know. You know, we were --\nused to know the Jarket Lerman, the strong, the assertive, the decision maker, the p -- the\npower in the family.",
        "A: Nope. She was -- she was very -- she was broody -- she was brooding, you know. It\naffected her very strongly.",
        "A: Oh yes. Close, but bear in mind, you are talking about a Hassidic couple.",
        "A: You know. I don\u2019t remember seeing my father kissing my mother.",
        "A: Or holding -- well, holding her hand --",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t remember that.",

So she felt that I am the closest to her, and she will need me. And it was a\ndecision that family made, and --",
        "A: It did, because I very much wanted to graduate, I wanted to go to Israel. I was hoping that\nI will prevail upon my mother, you know, to invest in Israel, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I, at that time, took over -- assisted mother in her business --",

        "A: Shlomo stepped into it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Esther was in the flour mills all along. Esther lost her first husband a few years after they\ngot married. And she remarried, and she had two children with her new husband, and she\nwas always in the flour mills. But one was in Beljets. By the way, one of our mills was\nright across the street from the death camp of Beljets --",
        "A: But, you know, I am talking -- I\u2019m jumping ahead of myself.",
        "A: But Esther was always, Esther and her husband, Yoshu, they were always involved with\nthe flour -- with the flour mill business. And one was in Beljets, one was in Zamusc, one\nwas in Tomashev, one was in Daszhisk. You know, so this was a big business.",
        "A: Two years.",
        "A: Two -- a year and a half to be exact.",
        "A: I missed -- I missed my town. I missed Lvov, I missed the life in Lvov, because it was a\nvery modern life already, with, you know, theaters, and --",
        "A: -- you know, operas, and ballets, and it was a -- that -- it -- it was a -- that -- th-the life,\nyou know, that -- you know, modern -- modern people have appreciated, and, you know,\nI could afford it, I could afford the tickets and what have you. It was great life,\nwonderful, and I had good friends in school, wonderful, wonderful people I -- you know -",
        "A: Absolutely. It -- it -- no, I -- I wouldn\u2019t say it became smaller, because when I came back,\nI was more assertive, and mother recognized that if she wants me, she cannot fight me,\nyou know. So I was very active in working with mother, but I was very active in the\ncommunity. I was active in our -- our sports club was the Harpoyle. I was active in the\nsports club, I was active in Shamere Atsyere, you know, and we -- I brought you some\npictures out -- 1-1t\u2019s amazing, you know. You will see a group of people, you know, like\nyou'd see a group of people here, young ones today, but wonderful, wonderful, and some\nof them are really -- you could sense, you could feel that they are the future leaders of --\nof the -- and -- of the community, or the Jewish people.",
        "A: Yes, yes, but I didn\u2019t permit it to swallow me. I liked it very much, but I didn\u2019t permit it\nto swallow me. No, I had a sense for business.",
        "A: If you asking me whether I was the scholarly type, always to -- to live on books, and --\nand -- no, no.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: As I told you before, first of all, Poland itself was in an escalating process of anti-\nSemitism. The leader of the Polish government, who was most benevolent, was Pilsudski,\nand after he died, the right wing organizations took the upper hand in Parliament, and\ntook the upper hand in the country. And you know, again the same story. They were\nafraid of Germany as much as we did. And their fear expressed itself by finding victims,\nyou know, by looking for scapegoats. And anti-Semitism escalated substantially, very\nsubstantially. And these were not good days in Poland.",
        "A: There was -- there was a pogrom in Pshittik.",
        "A: One pogrom, but Jews resisted. The Jews resisted, but there was a pogrom, and one Jew\ngot killed there.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. But, for instance, it was customary before the boys went to the army, they had to go\nand, you know, be checked out whether they\u2019re healthy, whether they\u2019re suitable,\nwhether they\u2019re fitted. So the boys from Tomashev, and the surrounding areas used to\ncome and this was kind of like a -- a bachelor\u2019s party, you know, so they went into the\nliquor stores, and bought liquor, got drunk and started beating up Jews. We in Tomashev\ndidn\u2019t take too kindly to it, so we organized -- even my brother, in his youth, you know,\norganized defense. And when they started beating up Jews, next time the Jews were\nprepared for it, and they got their portion, and they\u2019d stopped it. So it was a normal,\nongoing life. It wasn\u2019t all peaches and cream, it wasn\u2019t all wonderful things. There were,\nyou know difficulties, there were sadness in it. But also, health. I\u2019m not talking about\nphysical health, I\u2019m talking commununal health.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Because first of all, Czechoslovakia was invaded already. Austria was invad --\nnot invad -- invaded -- invaded by -- invited, but invaded. So 1-1t was clear, without any\nquestion in Hitler, you know, Hitler and Goebbels, you know what they are, remarks,\npublic -- public addresses, they talked about expansion, you know, labensurround, which\nmeans they needed space to expand, you know, to be able to live, and to allow the -- the\nThird Reich, which they were hoping that will last a thousand years, to establish itself,\nnot -- th-the -- there -- the signals -- the signs were there, without any question. The signs\nwere there that we are heading for bad times, but no one -- no one had any inkling of\nwhat was coming. I\u2019m talking about a massive annihilation.",
        "A: There was empty talk, sure, sure. I remember two days before the Germans invaded\nPoland they were -- you know, there was a dispute over Dansik. Dansik was a -- a free\ncity, you know, that was near -- it was a port city, a free city. So you could see young\nPoles going on the streets, we will smother them with our helmets, we will throw the\nhelmets at them. You know, empty talk, you know, bravado, and what have you. But we\nrealized that we are dealing with a formidable enemy. It was an enemy -- to describe it to\nyou, the Poles had cavalry. You know, riding, you know --",
        "A: Horses. And good cavalry, a good army, but this cavalry had to fight tanks. How does\ncavalry fight tanks, you know, so --",
        "A: No, 21.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, it was -- it came unexpectedly. I -- I mean there were -- you know, that -- feuds --\nthere were the discussions, and -- and the Polish minister Farnafayas, who went to Berlin\nto try to negotiate something, and they would have -- in my opinion they would have\nbeen very good collaborators. The way the -- th -- it prevailed at that time, the Socialist\nparty is, among Poles, weakened. The -- the extreme right party got stronger, and you\nasked me what was the first impact of war? Totally unexpected air raids, killing and\nburning. Killing and burning, you know, homes. Our home was burned the second day of\nthe war.",
        "A: I was at that time, when the war broke out, the biggest problem was to get gasoline, you\nknow, to have -- so we had -- the Polish army retreated, and there was -- two officers\nwere in Poland with a car. And I made them an offer, because in our business, we also\nhad a wholesale business of gasoline. It\u2019s like [indecipherable] you know, everything of\n[indecipherable]. We had many businesses.",
        "A: So we have gasoline, and we had it stored in a warehouse. I offered them, you know, to\nfill up their car, and to take four or five containers, and I should go with them, and they\nwere -- they -- they backed up without realizing that from the other side, the Soviet Union\nwill come in, you know. So I was not home, and I came home a few days later, and all of\nPoland was occupied already. And I found Mother. The house was burned. A major -- the\nstore was burned, and the whole city was badly damaged. Two of my colleagues that I\ngrew up with were killed in the bombardment, you know. It was sporadic bombardment\nthat -- not that there was any specific reason to bombard Tomashev. It was not a -- you\nknow, a military center or anything, it was a community.",
        "A: I was very shaken, very shaken. Very scared. And I know one thing, that I will not stay\nwith the Germans. So I moved forward -- because I came back, I told you, when I w-went\nwith these officers. And at that time, when the Soviet army came in, a good many people\nlooked to them as liberators, because, you know, they -- they were talking about freedom\nof the individual, and no anti-Semitism, you know, that it\u2019s against the law to be anti-\nSemitic and what have you. So we truly believed that, you know, they are the defenders\nof right, and good, and so I went to Lvov, because Lvov was the city where I studied, and\nI -- I knew the city. And I took mother with me to Lvov, and then my sister came, and\nthen my brother came. So it was turmoil, it was turmoil. Our town was occupied by the\nGermans. In our town, the border between the occupation that wa -- they carved up\nPoland into two half, was about 20 miles south of -- of our town. So, my mother and my\nsister left Tomashev because it was burned down, and they were, in the beginning when\nthey came in, they killed a few Jews, just without any reason. So the signals were bad,\nand we felt that being with Russians is going to be, you know, a way of surviving, not\nhaving all these things in a Communist regime, but surviving.",
        "A: More or less, yes.",
        "A: From Tomashev.",
        "A: Took nothing.",
        "A: There was nothing to take. I --",
        "A: You know, sure. I c -- I think my -- my older brother, Shlomo, gave me some of his\nclothing, because where he lived, and my sister Peshe lived, this was not bombarded, so\nthey remained. And I got some clothing from them, and I -- and I went, and I took\nMother with me.",
        "A: Partially walked, and partially on -- on trucks, you know. It -- it -- because the military,\nthe -- the Soviet military units were only about eight miles from us. So the minute we got\ninto Ravaruska, which was the next town, you know, the -- no, there was a small one,\nLubicha, a small one in between. But Ravaruska was already a town more or less the size\nof ours, maybe a little bigger. And there we had people that -- customers, they used to\nbuy from us, and -- and what have you. So, it wasn\u2019t in two [indecipherable] so to say.\nWe got into Ravaruska, and to catch our breath, and collect our senses, and from there I\nsaid to Mother, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Lvov, because this 1s a large city, and we\u2019ll be able to\nfunction better.\u201d",
        "A: The only thing what we -- what -- the -- the -- the question is a good question, no we\ndidn\u2019t, because whatever was it -- in -- in -- in our home, including, you know, jewelry\nand what have you, this all burned down. The jewelry, I think, was found by somebody\nand they refused to rec -- to admit that they found it. And mother and I came in with\npractically nothing. But how did we survive? In Lemberg -- in Lvov, there were several\nfactories that we bought stuff from them. There was a candy factory that we bought\ncandy from them. There was a factory of lachmas, which 1s a blue color that you put into\n-- into whitewash, you know, to paint houses. So, at that time, b-before the Russians\nestablish themselves, there was an in between period, a hiatus. So the fact that we dealt\nwith them, and we knew them -- so they gave us s-some of the m -- some of the\nmanufactured goods at hard cost prices from before the war. And this was the war, and\neverything jumped a thousandfold. So in -- we -- this gave us a good start, and we have\nmanaged to establish ourselves.",
        "A: Sure, we didn\u2019t have anything.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: But the object was to get it and to take it out from the factory, because as [indecipherable]\nthe factory [indecipherable] 10 times as much.",
        "A: We got an apartment.",
        "A: Not with Mother, because you know, she didn\u2019t have an enormously large apartment.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: A nice place, it -- di --",
        "A: Not like what we had. It was a small -- a small -- 1t was a room with a very small kitchen.\nWith a -- with a small -- small set up. But for Mother and I it was enough.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Esther -- Esther remained where she was, because Esther was in an area where it was\nright on the border, but 1t was the Russians, you know. So they were there, but Peshe\ncame, you know and it -- it was a matter of trying to organize ourselves, to find a place\nwhere to sleep and, you know, and how to -- how to earn a -- a -- to buy a1 -- a loaf of\nbread.",
        "A: We went from extreme riches, to extreme poverty.",
        "A: It\u2019s a transition.",
        "A: And a difficult one.",
        "A: But 1 -- the -- the good name that Mother had, and the reputation that Mother had, was\nvery helpful with these businesses that were in Lvov, you know, for us to bounce back a\nlittle bit.",

Very special lady.",
        "A: We just tried to do.",
        "A: You just tried to do.",

        "A: Yes, absolutely.",

These were friends\nthat were similar in -- in -- you know, in their -- 1n their religious -- in the degree of their\nreligiosity. Friends that, you know, that were also at least middle class, you know, at least\nmiddle class, with whom they had something in common, you know, and -- neighbors,\nyou know. Are you asking me whether there was an organized Jewish social life for\nreligious women? Not quite. Not quite. Fr-Free time was for prayer, for -- for study, and\nyou know.

And I had no trouble\nregrouping and finding my friends, and finding some of my friends, and -- and I made\nnew friends, young people made new friends easily. The object was to grow in into a new\nsystem, to a new society. A society that, you know, perfomra advocated, you know,\nwonderful things. But it was far from it. It was far from it. Now, believe it or not, but\nwhen things settled down a little bit, there was many people, many Jews that felt that they\nwant to go back home. Many. They want to go back home, they -- because you know, the\n-- the mass killings didn\u2019t start yet. We are talking \u00b039.",

        "A: Right. And another thing 1s that the Russians suggested to the -- those that came and\nstayed there to take Russian passports. And the Jews didn\u2019t want to take Russian\npassports because they were hoping that, you know, things will straighten out, and they\nwill be able to go home. So the Russians gave them passports with an 11\" paragraph, that\nthis is what it was called. And this is -- 11\" paragraph was a passport of not trustworthy\npeople, that they could not live a hundred kilometers -- less than a hundred kilometers\nfrom the border. And then, after awhile, it was the first massive tran -- ex -- th -- th -- the\nfirst massive transport of Jews from Poland, and Poles from Poland. Poles even more so,\nto Siberia. And my brother and his family were taken to Siberia. My sister Peshe was\ntaken to Siberia. And Mother was on the train already, to be taken to Siberia. But when I\ncame back from work, and I found out what is happening, I went out to the rail station.\nAnd there was a general from the KGB. And I walked over to him, and I say, \u201cI have a\ncomplaint.\u201d You know, general of KGB didn\u2019t know what it means to have a complaint. I\nwas naive, you know. I said I have a complaint, and he said, \u201cWhat is your complaint?\u201d I\nsay, \u201cWhy did you take my mother away?\u201d I am a citizen of Lvov, I have studied in Lvov\nbefore the war, she lives with me, and you have no reason to take her away.\u201d So he\nlooked at me, and looked at me, and he said, \u201cDo you know where she is?\u201d I say, \u201cNo,\nbut I know the transport.\u201d So he went with me, and we knocked in the boxcars, and\ncalling her name. And finally I found the boxcar and I took her out, and took her back\nhome. Of about 120 people that were, you know, e-expedited -- that -- do you know,\nexported, two people came out. One was a grandmother of a officer of the KGB, he\nescaped to Russia 20 years before that, and my mother. And I brought her out, you know,\nto -- she would have survived.",

Many Poles -- many Poles were shipped off, and --\nand perhaps in a more cruel manner, because these were the former police, the former\njudges, the former -- you know, the Polish intelligentsia. The Soviets felt that the\nintelligentsia is the most dangerous for them, because these are people that, you know,\nare thinking, and -- and they will eventually form resistance organizations, so they felt\nthat the best thing to do 1s to ship them off to Siberia.",

        "A: Yes. Qualified, but yes.",

        "A: Stupidity. We laughed about it. Stupidity, perhaps the fact that it was poorly organized,\nvery poorly organized. Singing hallelujahs to -- to the party, and to Stalin, were so\nabnormal, so horrendous, so large, and -- and th -- that it -- it -- you could sense that it\u2019s\nphony.",
        "A: No. It was hard to get material, and people did everything possible to excel in the foy --\nin -- in the field of ballet, athletics, because they got to a -- a -- as -- a very special level.\nThe Soviet Union took care of those that they needed as a picture to the world.

It was turmoil, it was fear, when they were moving so ferociously, and so, you\nknow, w-with bombardments, as I explained to you before, and with heavy artillery, and\nthen they were -- they entered Lvov without damaging anything, because the Poles did\nnot oppo -- not the Poles, the -- the Soviets did not oppose, did not resist -- did not resist\nthe entrance of the -- of the Germans. And the Germans came in and Lvov 1s a city that\nwill go down in infamy because the Ukrainian nationalists implemented the pogrom, and\nit was thousands of Jews that were taken from the street, from the houses, from offices,\nand taking them to the brigitky, which was the jail of -- the famous jail in Lvov, and\nslaughtered. At that time, I was -- this -- this was -- I\u2019m telling you something that\u2019s\nthree, four days already, but not [indecipherable]. And I worked already, at that time, on\nthe railroad, because the tracks from Lvov, deep into Russia were wider. And from Lvov\ngoing westward, they were narrower. So, wounded soldiers and -- and -- and equipment\nneeded -- that needed to go westward were tran -- had to transferred from one to the\nother. So the Wehrmacht, an officer came down, and he asked people to go to work, you\nknow, and we figured going to work, it\u2019s going to be the best thing.

So the pogrom that the Ukrainians initiated was with the acquiescence,\nwith the permission of the Germans, but not with the participation. This was purely done\nby Ukrainians. The Ukrainian police, volunteer police, and volunteers in general. And I\nremember going back from work, and with a -- with a friend of mine who lived in -- in\nmy building, Adonik was his name.

I say, \u201cMom, can I help you, what are you looking for?\u201d So she was a little\nembarrassed to tell me, so I say, \u201cMom, what is it that you need, let me -- let me,\u201d -- so\nfinally I walked over, and I took the hook from her, and I started poking, and what do I\npull out? The kielbasa. She would -- didn\u2019t want to touch it with her hands, so she pushed\nit under the stove.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Of course not.",
        "A: Well, it -- it -- bread, it -- at that time, bread was given out, it was rationed, but they were\ngiving bread, and we -- as I told you before, my job, you know, with the Russians, was a\npretty good job, and I was able to save up some things.",
        "A: So I went down to the market and bought something, you know, some greens, and some\nfruit, and you know.",
        "A: From the -- from the Russians?",
        "A: Ruble.",
        "A: Ruble. Rubles.",
        "A: Chervinsa.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no. Th-The -- immediately currency was new currency.",
        "A: Wait a minute. Let me go back for a moment. I think that for a little while, the rubles\nwere going on. And then they gave a period that within 10 days, you can submit a mart --\nmaximum amount I think was 500, or 5000, I don\u2019t remember any more. But there was a\nprocess of exchanging this for new, local currency.",
        "A: Somewhere under -- of course, not in a bank.",
        "A: Not in a bank.",
        "A: I remember -- I don\u2019t remember details, but I remember that I somehow met a guy who\nwas buying up these rubles. Whether he was going into Russia, or whether he believed\nthat the Russians are coming back, I couldn\u2019t tell you. But I know that I was able to\ndispose of it at a rate of exchange that was ridiculous, but I got currency that I could deal\nwith.",
        "A: Yeah, I want to tell you something, Joan. It\u2019s 50 years.",
        "A: It\u2019s getting hazy.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: At the railroad.",
        "A: No, no, we see a stabilization of sorts. We didn\u2019t know how it will go, but it was the\nGermans that appointed a Jewish leadership, a Judenrat, and they even created a Jewish\nmilitia, you know, just to keep order, no weapons, you know, and all what they did -- for\ninstance, if they wanted -- if they -- if they ordained a random -- a -- ara -- you know, a --\na policy -- if they wanted, for instance, large amounts of money, they went to the\nJudenrat and they gave them 48 hours to come up with it. If not, they\u2019Il kill hundreds of\nJews. This is one thing. The other thing is that -- bear in mind that Lvov had several\nhundred thousand people. There was a need to establish some kind of an order. Even for\nkilling, you needed an order. Do you follow me?",
        "A: So it was the Jewish Judenrat, and the Jewish militia, the Jewish police, that implemented\nthat order. Little did we know that these policemen will be forced later, to participate in,\nyou know, in shipping off the Jews to the -- God knows where.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Takes awhile.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It is -- I don\u2019t remember the details of it, but I can tell you that the location of 1t was very\nmuch in a densely Jewish area.",
        "A: You know, a rat -- the Rappaport, a Shlamitchla, you know, this was a densely Jewish\narea. And this is where they established it.",
        "A: And that\u2019s where I was living.",
        "A: At that time, I was already in a slave labor camp.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I know that they have kept constricting the ghetto area.",
        "A: They -- first of all they established the ghetto, and they -- and the first one wasn\u2019t so bad\nbecause they -- all they wanted is the perimeter around it to clean up, and of course\npeople were given 48 hours, you know, and take what they can carry with them, and go\nin. And there was a matter of getting these people located within the ghetto, you know.\nAnd this was in the beginning, you know, people felt you are invading my privacy, this is\nmy apartment. So this is where the Judenrat and Jewish police, you know, played a very\nconstructive role, you know. Very constructive role, helping, you know, and -- and\ndemanding from these people that they should make place. That -- there were several\nrounds of constricting the ghetto. I did not get to any of them, so --",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: I -- what I recall is I recall the Germans coming in, the pogrom, this was something that\nI'll never forget, it was a terrible, terrible thing, and it was thousands of Jews that were\nkilled. And what I do remember is the settling in, as you said, you know, things have\nsettled in for awhile. People had to go to work, they came in, for instance, the Germans\norganized an arbitesont. That means a -- an unemployment office, where instead of going\nout and catching, you know, people, they send a message to the arbitesont that today we\nneed 3,000 workers. And the arbitesont had to, you know, supply them. In the beginning,\nthey were people that went there because at the end of the day they got a quarter of a\npound of bre -- a pound of bread, you know. So people needed to work, y -- to be able to\n-- t-to survive, and to get some bread, get some -- some fruit, get some vegetables. And --\nbut what I\u2019m -- you asked me the question, I do -- I did not live in Lvov any more when\nthe first co -- for the second round-up.",
        "A: Still working on the -- on -- a -- on the railroad, and on the way home, there were SS men\nstanding with Ukrainian police, with a truck, and stopped people, and -- and asked them\nfor documents, for th -- th -- th -- a shine -- a -- a document.",
        "A: And I was quite certain that document that I have is -- has -- carries the protection. So\nwhen they asked for the document I gave it to him, so he tore it up, and he said, \u201cGet on\nthe truck.\u201d And within a half an hour, we were about 60 or 70 people, that were brought\nto Viniki. Viniki was a -- had a small labor camp. What they had is they had a gulag of\nlabor camps spread between Lvov and Kiev, and the object of it was to build a better\nhighway, to enable the advancement of the German mechanized forces. So our job -- the\nViniki group, our job was between Lvov and Viniki, to build a highway. So the first s --\ngravel that we got is they took us into the Jewish cemetery -- Lvov had a beautiful Jewish\ncemetery that was 200 or 250 years old, big magnificent, magnificent, you know,\nmausoleums. Marble, you know, expensive marble. And our job was to dismantle it,\nbreak it into -- into gravel, and load it up on trucks that were going for the building of the\nroad between Lvov and -- and Kiev.",
        "A: Oh, horrible.",
        "A: Horrible. In the process of doing it - -and I\u2019m very proud of this, we got started\norganizing, and when it came to a very beautiful mausoleum, what we did is we dug the -\n- dug the -- the grave, put in the stones, and covered it with -- with dirt, you know.",
        "A: To protect it.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t see it, and we didn\u2019t -- you know, very few of those that did it, survived.\nMost of them got killed, sooner or later, because this is where the killing started, already.",
        "A: No, no, th --",
        "A: They -- le-let me say this to you. As they entered, they were always cases of individual\nkillings, killing five people, six people. But there was no -- this was not an annihilation\nprocess. For the time being it was a punitive, or a process to scare them, to scare us, or a\nprocess to -- s -- th -- you know, force us to surrender gold, or to surrender money. But it\nwas not the implemented, final solution. This came later. This came, I would say in -- in\nthe Lvov area, somewhere about a couple of months after the Germans came in. In\nBarbiare, you know, when the Soviet -- when the German army -- when the not -- when\nthe German army move forward, and they conquered Kiev. In Barbiare there was already\nthe first killing. The Einsatzgruppen. This was the beginning of the Einsatzgruppen. But\nthe Einsatzgruppen were only on the Soviet occupied territories. In -- in the territories of\nformer Poland, they were no mass -- at that time there were no mass killings. Individual\nkillings, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Not -- not yet.",
        "A: N -- it was brutal, they were -- th-th -- you know, beating us, forcing us to work, and in\nsome ca -- not in some, in many of cases, they made fun, you know, of us, and we had to\n-- they gave us toothbrushes to clean -- to clean a sidewalk, you know, and things like\nthis. They cut off the beards from religious people, but still no mass annihilation.\nKillings, brutality, beating, cruelty, but no mass annihilation. The mass annihilation came\nlater.",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely.",
        "A: A white band, a white armband with a Star of David.",
        "A: About three months, I would say.",
        "A: Felt so littled -- so belittled. So morally devastated, you know, to -- t -- first of all, you\nwere no -- you were not a human being. There were some SS men, they were not on\nassignment, they just walked, they walked the street, and if you walked on the sidewalk\nwith them, you know, he hit you with -- you know, with -- you know, with his hand, or\nwith a -- whatever he carried. He -- \u201cDu schwine,\u201d you pig, \u201cget off the sidewalk.\u201d So,\nyou know, they -- we were treated in a terrible way. Dehumanized, totally dehumanized,\nand this was the feeling, that we are -- there were many suicides, I -- I presume you know\nthat. In -- in Lvov, there were many, many suicides.",
        "A: Oh yes. Of people who just didn\u2019t want to participate in it. Didn\u2019t want to be part of it.",
        "A: The d -- the degradation, the dehumanization. The treating the people like animals. But I\nhad Mother at home, and she couldn\u2019t work, she -- you know, she wasn\u2019t cut out to work,\nshe -- she -- at that time, and Mother was -- 19 -- 84 -- 16 -- 40 -- 56 - 55 years.",
        "A: You know, and whatever I -- you know, I could do to, you know, to bring home some\nfood, and to protect her. I had a girlfriend in Lvov, and she was wonderful, she did\neverything she could. She was blonde, blue eyed, so sh -- sometimes she could smuggle,\nand go after, you know, the designated hours, y-you know, because Jews were not\nallowed to -- to be on the street after six o\u2019clock in the evening. So she -- when I was\ntaken away to Viniki, she, for awhile, took care of Mother.",
        "A: And in a short while after that, 1t started, the mass annihilations started, and Beljets was\nopened, and they started emptying the --",
        "A: -- the ghetto in Lvov.",
        "A: My mother knew that I was in Vinik1.",
        "A: I was working on the road -- I told you we were working on the -- the -- first of all on the\ncemetery, and then I -- we started working on the roads, you know, the gulag that was set\nup. And a guy that I knew, he was a friend of the parents of my girlfriend -- and I asked\nhim, I said, \u201cDo me a favor and go to Lucia and tell her that I am in Viniki.\u201d So from\nhim, Lucia, my girlfriend learned it, and she told Mother. And about six weeks later, they\nstarted the first shipments to Beljets, and I don\u2019t know whether it was the first or the\nsecond shipment.",
        "A: No, Lucia survived, and she came without an armband, with this guy, and she told me\nMother was taken away.",
        "A: It was horrible.",
        "A: By then we knew it. B --",
        "A: B-By then we suspected, and -- and still I want to tell you that everybody hoped that he\nwill -- he will survive. Somehow he will survive. This desire of human beings, you know,\nto evade the worst, it\u2019s unbelievable.",
        "A: Yeah, but I have learned later that she was apprehended, and she was taken to slave labor\ncamp of Janofska.",
        "A: Yanofs -- do you know about Janofska?",
        "A: Janofska was a very, very cruel camp, a soflager, and most of the Jews fr-from Lemberg\nwent either to the death camp of Beljets, or to Janofska.",
        "A: Well, I was fortunate because, you know, being there, you know, they -- they didn\u2019t --\nthis was the time where they didn\u2019t empty labor -- labor camp. This was a slave labor\ncamp, this was not a killing camp. However, when typhoid broke out in our camp, and\nwhen people started getting high fever, every morning he used to come in, the SS man --\nwhat was his name, I don\u2019t -- I -- I can see him, but I don\u2019t remember his name. H-He --\nHegler? Something like it. And everyone who had fever, and -- he asked the guys to load\nthem up on a -- a -- a -- it was like a -- a pushcart, but with soft tires. And he shot them,\nand they took them out to bury them. And the camp -- aga -- even in camp, there was a\ntime where [indecipherable] to regulate itself, to settle down, because I often wonder\nwhether it wouldn\u2019t have been much better if we would have kept them in turmoil. I often\nwonder that. And yes, a good many would have been killed, a good many would have\nbeen maimed, but in turmoil, when 200 people are working with 10 policemen, and they\ndisperse, some would have been saved. And wise -- why human nature is such to submit,\nI don\u2019t know.",
        "A: It\u2019s ha-hard to organize turmoil, exactly. Exactly.",
        "A: Yes. Barracks with the same bank -- th -- the bunkbeds like you see in -- in -- in\nAuschwitz, and we had Ukrainian police -- there were three SS men, and the rest were\nUkrainian police, and they took us to work every morning, and we had to go, and march\nand sing, and --",
        "A: Oh yes, all the time.",
        "A: German -- German songs. Or they used to, you know, make up songs that they were in\nGerman, but, -- you know about us, that the Jews are the fault of the war, and the Jews\ncaused the war, you know.",
        "A: Absolutely. Always when we went to work we had to sing, and if not, they were terrible,\nthey asked us to run, to drop, to get up, to -- in particular when it was rainy, when it was\nmuddy. Terrible.",
        "A: Our clothes, we did --",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t have stripers.",
        "A: We did not --",
        "A: Yes. Same clothes, and the clothes of those that were killed, or died, because you know,\nnot all of them. What I want to point out to you is that in camp, in Viniki, which was a\nslave labor camp, the difference between the poor in the villages, and the kids of -- th-the\nkids or parents of wealthy families, was that the wealthy and the city people died first.\nThey couldn\u2019t -- they -- they were soft. You know what I mean when I -- you know what\nI mean when I say they were soft?",
        "A: The villagers, and the poor people were more ardent. They were more used to hunger,\nthey were more used to filth.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right, a-absolutely.",
        "A: Right. They -- their -- their -- their level of resistance was higher.",
        "A: I -- in between.",
        "A: In between, in between, but young.",
        "A: 21, right.",
        "A: And I knew at that time that Mother is gone. I didn\u2019t hear from Lucia, so I assume she is\neither in a camp somewhere, or gone, and then I found out that she is in -- she was in\nAuschwit -- in Janofska.",
        "A: And then I lost trace of her.",
        "A: Oh, we formed friends, yeah, absolutely.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, this is the camp, you know, if you remember, you know, we were\npreparing an escape, and the elders of the camp called us, and asked us, \u201cWho gives you\nthe right to buy your own freedom at the price of those that will be killed, who will not be\nable to escape?\u201d This is the camp Viniki, this is where it transpired.",
        "A: Just there were some people --",
        "A: -- that they naturally were considered, you know -- I remember there was a professor of\nthe University of Lvov. There was a former textile manufacturer. You know, people of\nstatue and respect, and not youngsters, you know.",
        "A: It\u2019s a self evolved leadership, so to say.",
        "A: We were -- we -- we started up with a few, three, four that we started talking about it, and\nwe realized that we are going to do it, that we need about 25 or 30, assuming that if it\ndoesn\u2019t work when we disperse, and a third will get killed, half will get killed, and half\nwill survive.",
        "A: So, there are no secrets, you know, in particular between young people who have been\nincarcerated, and you know. So 1-1t became known that a -- a group -- they didn\u2019t know\nwho, that a group is planning an escape. And then the elders started looking into it, and\nthey found out who the group was, and they summoned us at night, when everybody was\nasleep, to come and talk to them, and we came, and the question was very simple, you\nhave no right to buy your freedom at the price of others. And we recognize that they have\na point, and we listen to them. And it wa --",
        "A: Yes. And it was a wrong thing to do.",
        "A: No, we -- we -- w -- when they said it to us, they said go home and think about it.",
        "A: But when we talk about it, and when we talked with each other, we said they -- these --\nthey are right. Maybe --",
        "A: Yeah, 30 will escape, but we were about 200 people there. The rest will get killed. So we\ndecided not to do it, and it was mistake, it was a terrible mistake, because two or three\nmonths later, that was the end of Vinik1.",
        "A: Yes. One of the things that they have established from the beginning, is that mass\nretribution for single disobedience of a single resistance, of stealing something, stealing\nsome food, or something, always mass retribution. This was a common thing. In camp\nalso, mass retribution, all the time. But in that time, what I am talking to you about, this\nwas probably in the beginning of \u201942, that 1 -- the cemetery was emptied already, and we\nran -- they moved us down, like a hun -- a hundred -- we finished a hundred feet, move to\nthe next hundred feet. Finish a thousand feet, move to the next -- at that time I was\nassigned a job to roll -- to ride a steamroller. You know what I am talking about? The\nsteamroller that presses gravel --",
        "A: -- into space. And I was the only one of the entire camp that was allowed at night to\nremain un -- with the steamroller, because I had to protect it. Everybody else went to\ncamp.",
        "A: Right. And this --",
        "A: Alone.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right. But PI tell you, it -- it -- good things came of it, because when they started --\nwhen they started transporting Jews to the death camps of Lvov, and you know, and --\nand -- of Beljets, and -- and -- and other camps, some people broke the little windows in\nthe boxcars open, and threw children out, or youngsters got out. So quite often, people\nknocked on the door, and specifically I remember th -- a fellow that later became one of\nthe best partisans, one of the best sharpshooters that we had, Moishe Lot, he died three\nyears ago. He came, knocked to the door, he was stark naked, stark naked. He said, \u201cLet\nme in, I am very cold, and I want to go in with you tomorrow to work.\u201d So I took him in,\nI gave him something to eat, he warmed up, and I gave him some clothing, and in the\nmorning he blended in with the group, and went to camp. Went to camp because he had\nno place to go.",
        "A: He had to smuggle into -- to the labor --",
        "A: Right. I remember a girl who knocked at the door another night, and it was -- she must\nhave been 17 - 16 years old, beautiful girl. And she was dressed. And she said mother\nthrew her out of the -- of the boxcar. And I asked her whether she knew where the boxcar\ngot, she said, \u201cYes, we knew that we are going -- we are being taken somewhere to a -- a\nfa -- a faniktudslager, right.",
        "A: Yes. And she again wanted to go into camp, but I said, \u201cLook, you don\u2019t look like\nJewish, try to maybe smuggle.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m tired of it. PIl go into the camp, and\nwhatever will happen, will happen.\u201d",
        "A: In our camp there was a very small group of women, and they were mostly in the kitchen.",
        "A: Oh, maybe 15 - 20 women.",
        "A: Yeah, maybe less.",
        "A: She smuggled in, yes. But bear in mind that very few of us survived.",
        "A: You know, the only ones that survive is the ones that found a way of breaking out from\ncamp, and the --",
        "A: You know, as I the -- the -- the people that were in camp, were assigned to work\npositions. When I was finished [indecipherable] an area, I had to go back to camp, and\nyou know, be in the quarry. So one day in the quarry, we were working, we must have\nbeen 70 or 80 people, guarded by Ukrainian police. Two Ukrainian police needed a\nhandful of people to go further out in the quarry to look for harder -- a harder stone,\nbecause some of the stone was of a calcium composition, and some of it was like marble.\nSo we were four people -- five people, and we were taken by two policemen deep into the\nquarry to -- to dig some of that hard stone. And we -- by eyesight we communicated, you\nknow, and at one point, we jumped them, and we killed them, and we got away with a\nrifle and a half, one rifle intact, and the other one broken. But we were able to -- to fix it.",
        "A: With shovels and picks.",
        "A: Yeah, the two -- yeah, w-we jumped on one and the other, you know, because they were\ngrabbing the rifles, but by the time they were able to grab the rifle and position it, you\nknow, we attacked them with picks and shovels.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Oh -- oh, this was at a time when we started getting news that there are people that are\nrunning into the woods.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know who, we didn\u2019t know where, but all we heard is that people are escaping\nfrom camp, and going into the woods, they are going to organize themselves. So when we\nkilled them, we didn\u2019t know the area. I told you before about the villagers, and the city\npeople? The villagers were fortunate because they knew the forest, they knew the area.\nWe were fortunate that one of the five was -- Moatcha Stralliska, you know, was a -- a --\na village -- a -- a -- a peasant -- a village boy. And he knew the area. And we escaped,\nand we -- in daytime we got into the field, it was -- where we lay in the -- you know, in\nbetween the stands of -- you know, wheat and corn, whatever was growing there. And at\nnight we got into the woods. We didn\u2019t know anybody, we didn\u2019t know where to go. But\nslowly, you know, you\u2019re going -- we discovered that there are some Jews here, there\u2019s\nsome Jews there. Within a period of six to eight weeks, we were around 200 - 250 people,\nvarious ages. Some women, some children. So what we did is we separated the young,\nthe ones that were able to fight, and we -- and we had with us, you know, the -- the -- we\ncalled it, you know, the -- the ghetto. The elderly people, the children, you know, the drek\ncommando we called it.",
        "A: Commando.",
        "A: Right. But we kept them, we kept them in food, and we kept them safe.",
        "A: Escaped from the ghetto, some of them escaped from a hiding place. Some of them\nescaped, you know, from camps.",
        "A: All kinds of things.",
        "A: Pure coincidence.",
        "A: We started -- we were th -- when we came in, as five.",
        "A: But there were already people in the forest.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Because if we wouldn\u2019t have listened to them --",
        "A: -- if we wouldn\u2019t have listened to them, we -- about 30, or maybe 40 would have either\nescaped not being noticed, or would have escaped, and would have been noticed and shot\nat, and some would have been killed, but the rest would have survived.",
        "A: Right, right. This is all, you know, if and when and if and when. But the fact is that the\npeople that were in this camp, sooner or later, were transferred to Janofska or to\nAuschwitz, and were killed. Or to any of the death camps, Treblinka, to Sobibor.",
        "A: No, not all of them, one. One was them. Because bear in mind, I told you before that we\nmoved a hundred feet, a thousand feet.",
        "A: You know, at one point we caught up with a -- with a group from the -- from Kroshenko,\nfrom another gulag.",
        "A: When I say gulag, I\u2019m talking about af -- a -- a labor force, established, you know, to\nhandle a stretch of the road. So at that time, w-we have met with another group. Am I\nclear?",
        "A: This was Kroshenko. And the forests that we were in were called the Hanachofsky\nLassiter Hanachova forest.",
        "A: [indecipherable] Hanachov.",
        "A: Yeah, but there were others later, when we started grouping together.",
        "A: Most of the escapees were people that knew the area.",
        "A: They knew some peasants, they were hoping that they will go in, and perhaps the peasant\nwill help him, maybe he\u2019Il hide him, maybe he\u2019Il give him some food.",
        "A: You know.",
        "A: This was the first time.",
        "A: It felt good.",
        "A: Felt good, let me not tell you anything else, it felt very good, it felt very good.",
        "A: I can only tell you how I felt. I believe so. I believe so, because we were bitter, we were\nmistreated, we were innocent, our families were murdered. We were on the brink of\nbeing murdered, there was no law protecting us.",
        "A: Nothing. Everything was against us, the law was against us, the -- the -- the government\nwas against us, you know. Everybody was against us.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that we were philosophizing.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have time for that.",
        "A: We were hunted, and you know, we had to do everything possible to protect ourselves,\nand we started organizing, I told you, weapons was a major problem.",
        "A: You know, the -- we -- 1t was very difficult to get weapons, it was dangerous to get\nweapons, and when you got them, you had to pay horrendous prices for it. We were not\nstrong enough yet to -- later on it was different, because we used to go into a village\nwhere German -- the German sup -- food supplies were stored. And we took what we\nwanted, killed the -- the two or three policemen that were there, four the most, and\nburned the rest of the -- poured gasoline on the top of the sugar, and -- and the flour. But\nlater on we got smarter. We took as much as we could, and we traded it with the peasants.\nThe peasants had weapons. The peasants -- you know, when the Russians were treated, or\nthe Poles were treated, they buried rifles, and -- and you know, hand grenades. So we\ndealt with them.",
        "A: We traded.",
        "A: To get organized.",
        "A: In the forest -- in the for -- the Germans did not go into the forest.",
        "A: They did not go into the forest. If they -- there were several times when they made round-\nups. So what they did is they enc -- encircled a certain area, and bombarded it heavily\nwith artillery. Or send in Ukrainians, but they themselves very seldom went into the\nforest, and when they went in, they didn\u2019t come out.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: However, there were Ukrainian Nationalists, the -- the -- we called them banderofsa,\nfrom Bandera. They were much more dangerous than the Germans, because they knew\nthe forest better than we did. And they were well -- well armed, they were well equipped.\nThey knew the forests, and the most important thing, if any one of them got injured, all\nthey needed to do was to bring him back, and put him into any peasant, and the peasant\nwould take them. With us, if somebody got injured, you know, unless the -- we -- we\nknew that the -- the peasant is trustworthy, we couldn\u2019t -- we had to keep him with us.",
        "A: And medicine was a big problem. Medicine and weapons was the biggest problem, not\nfood.",
        "A: No, because food -- we -- we were robbing. We went into a village, and you know -- and\nwe told them that we are confiscating. You have three cows, we\u2019 ll take one. And --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Sure, sure, sure. But as time went on, we became bolder, you know. I am not telling you\nthat we engaged the German Wehrmacht in open warfare because this is ridiculous. We\nwere not equipped for it, and we were not cut out for it, and it wasn\u2019t called for. But, as\ntime went on, you know, we -- as I told you how we got -- you know, we surrounded\ntheir food depots. You know, when we needed clothing, we went in, you know, to\nwealthy peasants and we got what we wanted. Normally we did this about 20 - 30 miles\naway from where we stayed, because it was dangerous to do that. We lived by the power\nof our -- of our weapons. What we did, for instance, is, you know, we made sure that the\nsurrounding area has a misconception of how big we are, and how strong we are. We\nused to place a few people in various parts of the woods, and ask him to relieve salvos.\nAnd the news in the for -- in the villages was that the partisans are occupying the entire\nforest, and they have thousands of people there, you know, fully equipped. You know, to\nmisinform them.",
        "A: We used to go down, and we had some peasants that we trusted, and this is where we kee\n-- kept our wounded. But medicine was a big problem. And these were the days when\npenicillin were not known yet. So the biggest item was iodine. And we used to use -- as\nrunnners, we used to use little girls. You know, 12 years old, 14 years old, they were\nfabulous. One of our girls was caught outside of Lvov with two liters of iodine. Now,\nwhen the police saw a girl with two liters of iodine, they knew that she 1s from a partisan\ngroup. And they promised her that they will take her to her parents, and they will -- they\ngave her clothing, and they\u2019ll give her food, and this, to -- to reveal where we are, and she\nrefused. So they started torturing her. She refused. They finally killed her. So ya --\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",

        "A: -- | think it was Leah, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: With two liters of di -- 1odine. And they tried to interrogate her, and promise her all kinds\nof things, and finally -- she didn\u2019t reveal where we are, and finally they started torturing\nher, and they tortured her to death. But what I want to tell you is that the role of women\nin the underground was very necessary, and very important. Because first of all, if you --\nif we needed to make contact with someone about negotiating a purchase of weapons, or\nabout getting some medicine, or about getting, you know, someone who is very sick into\na hospital, you know, we needed women to do that, because men were circumcised. Ifa\nman was caught in town, all they needed to do is ask him to drop his pants, and they\nknew that they have a Jew. Now, people like Leah, people blend -- in particular blonde\nwomen, blue eyed women, well there were many of them, you know, and spoke a good\npeasant Polish, or Ukrainian, you know, were precious because they could do these things\nthat -- much easier. So they played a very, very important role, and with -- you know,\nbeing on guard at night -- they were on guard at night. I -- I have nothing but admiration\nfor the con -- conduct of women at, you know, during the partisan years.",
        "A: That she was caught?",
        "A: She was caught outside of Lvov, that was a small village. And in the village, that, you\nknow, the people knew that, you know, the do -- the Ukrainians -- the -- the policemen\nwere either local, or they grew into the community. So, you know, the --",
        "A: Of course, of course.",
        "A: Okay, there was a fighting force, and that\u2019s a big word.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t want you to come away from here is that we commanded, you know,\nan air force, and tanks, and -- this was not the case. We had an antiquated weapons, with\na meager amount of ammunition, every bullet counted, every hand grenade that you had,\nyou were not sure whether when you will throw it, whether it will explode or not, you\nknow, and -- but slowly, slowly, we started coo -- you know, i-invading small police\noutposts and villages.",
        "A: Okay, all -- all --",
        "A: Of sorts.",
        "A: No, women were -- were not -- women were used as runners.",
        "A: Women were used as nurses. Women were used as -- you know, mending clothes and\nstuff like this.",
        "A: No -- no shooting.",
        "A: But for guards at night, if we come back -- came back, and we were tired, and we wanted\nto lie down to sleep, they -- they were guards. They --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not all of them. There is -- she just died, Hannah Hochberg. She was a tremendous,\ntremen -- oh, we made a mistake, we should have had her with us in the fighting force.",
        "A: She was a dynamo, a dynamo. And she always argued don -- don\u2019t -- just because, you\nknow, we are different sex, doesn\u2019t mean that, you know, we cannot participate, but --",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Absolutely, and some of them did.",
        "A: Not in our --",
        "A: Not the --",
        "A: In other groups.",
        "A: You know. So what I\u2019m saying to you is, you ask me did -- di -- the division up, the\nelderly people, the women, the children. We call them the ghetto, or the -- the drek\ncommando, you know. They were wonderful people. They were our -- our uncles, our\naunts, our -- not my uncles, but there were parents there, you know. So our job was too\nkeep them with food, you know, and with supplies. Now, if there was a case where we\nlearned that Germans are trying to surrounder us and what have you, we moved them out\nfirst. And they were difficult because they couldn\u2019t move as rapidly.",
        "A: You know, but we moved them. We never abandoned them.",
        "A: Absolutely -- absolutely. And then there\u2019s another thing that you have to bear in mind.\nHaving weapons was the most important thing. People came out of the ghettos, a good\nmany of them came -- came with their s -- wi -- with their shirt on their back.",
        "A: And there were camps, there were partisan units that did not accept people without\nweapons. There were partisan units that unfortunately came with weapons, but before\nthey reached us, you know, there were Ukrainian units that intercepted them, took their\nweapons and killed them. We were in good working relationship with the akar, with the\narmia kryova, with the Polish akar, and the reason for it 1s because this was an area where\nbefore the war Poles were considered colonizers, you know, occupants, you know, that\nthey were sent in by the Polish government to Polonize the area. And the Ukrainians ha-\nhated them, and the Ukrainians burned their villages and killed them. And they needed us\nas allies. So in our area, I know that there are stories that there were places where akar\nwere killing Jews. There were cases like this, not in our area. In our area, we were allies.\nOne time I remember, there was a case where they were plotting to take our weapons\naway, and we discovered it, and -- so we had to show them whether. We told them, if this\nis what you want, we are going to be on our own, and when the Ukrainians will invade\nyour villages, you will be by yourself. So --",
        "A: Right. So what I\u2019m saying to you -- you ask me about what did we do with the -- with the\nelderly. We kept them not far from us, almost adjacent.",
        "A: No, dug-ins. Dug-ins, yeah, with --",
        "A: Dig -- dig --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Dig basements, and cover them with leaves, with branches --",
        "A: -- and soil on the top of it. You know, it -- in the wintertime it was cold. Sometimes,\nwhen it was relatively quiet, we used to go into a village, and camp in village. But when\nwe on -- when we were in the village, we did not allow the villagers to go in the direction\nof the city, because we were afraid that they will betray us, you know. Another thing that\nwe have played a role, which in my opinion was very, very important. The Gestapo\nimplemented an order that every peasant who will -- every -- every Pole, or Ukrainian\nwho will deliver to them a Jew, will get a liter of vodka, or five kilograms of sugar. And\nthere were those that did it. So one day we found out that an Ukrainian from a village,\nPotanachufka, delivered to the Gestapo a mother and a daughter, that\u2019s a young girl eight\nyears, or nine year old. And of course the Gestapo took them and killed them. So we went\n-- went in that night to the village, knocked at the door, took him out, slung him up on a\ntree in the front of his house, as a sign, this will be the reward for anybody who will turn\nJews over to the Gestapo for a liter of vodka or five pounds of sugar. That was the end of\nit, they didn\u2019t do it any more. It was a time where life -- life wasn\u2019t worth much. But, you\nknow, what you have to do, you have to do.",
        "A: When they started attacking Polish villages, we, with the Poles, started attacking\nUkrainian villages. You know, I told you about this guy that came to me when I was on\nthe -- when I was on the steamroller, Moishe Lot? He turned out to be one of the best\nsharpshooters that we had. A young fella, you know, from a peasant family, small town --\nvery small town family, and one time we had an encounter with the Ukrainian\nnationalists, with the banderoftis. And he crawled out to very, very front, and killed their\nmachine gunnist, and brought back a machine gun.",
        "A: Do you know what a machine gun meant to us? It was a fantastic thing, you know? So\nthere were days -- days of good feelings, and there were days of sad feelings. Me give\nyou a -- another moment with -- has not to do with f -- with fights. We came back from\nan engagement where we were fighting an Ukrainian group, I mean of -- all partisans.\nAnd it was a b -- we lost a few guys. And it was very, very tiresome, because we had to\nescape, we had to run, and we had to counterattack. It -- it -- 1t was not one of the best\ndays for us, it was one of the bad days for us. And we came in, and one guy says, \u201cFellas,\ndo you know what is tonight? Tonight is Yom Kippur.\u201d We didn\u2019t have prayer books,\nand we were not that terribly [indecipherable] but one guy who remembered the prayers,\nstood up, and started singing, you know, the Kol Nidre. Jay -- Joan, Pll never forget that.\nI'll never, never forget that. It was so emotional, you know.",
        "A: The command structure, our -- first of all, I told you that we were fighting hand in hand\nwith the -- with the akar -- with the armia kryova. The commander of the -- all the forces\nwas a -- a professor of the polytechnic [indecipherable] from Lvov. And his pseunonym\nwas Polcovnik Proch powder -- gun powder. He was the main commander, and the rest\nwas, you know, it shifted constantly. You know, sometimes, it -- 1t -- Lot\u2019s brother-in-\nlaw, Meisel, George Meisel was in charge of a group, sometimes I was in charge of a\ngroup, sometimes we joined together and we subjugated our command privileges. We\ndidn\u2019t play army, I mean it -- it -- you know, it wasn\u2019t the objective. But it had to be\norganized, it -- and -- you know, when a guy went out with a -- with a group, either for\nfood, or for weapons, or to attack somebody, or to burn down a village, you know, there\nhad to be command. There had to be command. There was one guy among us, he was\nfrom -- from this area, and he was a true peasant. He was fantastic. We came back at\nnight to the forest from an -- we called it aktia, from an action. He took off his shoes, and\nwalking with the bare feet, he felt his way to find the paths back to our woods, in the\ndark. I -- I would say that a good many of us are alive today on account of him.",
        "A: Larger group.",
        "A: Where Polcovnik Proch, Colonel Proch was in charge of.",
        "A: He decided, you know, on major things, on going to, you know, burn down a village, or\nto go down a village and stand side by side with the Poles and fight. There was one guy\nwho was even a volksdeutsch, you know, and -- and in the village, he was considered a\ncollaborator of the Germans. And he was with us, and a good guy, and I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t\nremember any more his name, believe it or not.",
        "A: An order was -- and order was given that we need 25 guys, or 15 guys, to go and do this\nand this and this. First of all you took volunteers. If you didn\u2019t have enough volunteers,\nyou appointed, you designated. For instance, to go down and take care of this peasant\nwho delivered the mother and the daughter to Gestapo, for this, only volunteers, and only\n-- there were too many volunteers for that, you know, so --",
        "A: We decided that thi -- this one, this one, this one, this one goes.",

        "A: There -- there was no generals and colonels.",
        "A: It -- 1t -- it was -- for instance, I mentioned to you George Meisel. George Meisel was\nlooked upon, you know, he was a brave -- he was a good shooter, and you know, he was\nlooked upon as good material for leadership. I often, you know, when I needed another\nteam, I asked his team to join me.",

We dealt with a well organized underground -- Ukrainian the banderoft 1s well-\norganized, well equipped, knowing the forest, knowing where to go, knowing the\npeasants clauses too, you know. These were formidable opponents, and we fought with\nthem. We fought with them. Now, as far as the Germans are concerned, when they --\nwhen we came upon them, you know, we took care of, we took them on. But only if they\nwere in small groups. The time when we really went after them is when the retreat started\nrapidly, when the Soviet army was already 50 - 100 miles away.",
        "A: We used to be on both sides of the road, and if a small group came on, we took care of\nthem. The -- we got to a point where we forced them to put signs on the highways that no\nGerman is allowed to travel less than a foursome, and equipped with military --",

It is a group of people -- do exactly, you know,\nand anybody that tells you that -- whether it was Bielski, or whether it was another, that\nthey were an army, they were not an army. They were partisan groups that we didn\u2019t\ntrust, higher up in -- in the -- in the forest of Belarusa. There were many Russian\npartisans, well organized, who have gotten drops, military drops from Russia. Some of\nthem were good and took in Jewish partisans, some of them didn\u2019t. There was no unified\nform.",

I didn\u2019t intend to survive. There was no one who hoped\nto survive. The idea was to fight, and die on your feet, instead of living on your knees, so\nto say.",

And it\u2019s manneded by a few, like\nelderly Germans, you know? So we went down there, and it was winter time, and went\ndown with a sleigh, and with a horse, and we came in, and we loaded up. We took some\nflour, we took some sugar, I remember. And then, you know, we saw large kegs, we\nasked the guy, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d He says, \u201cSchnapps.\u201d So we took a keg, and we rolled it\non the sleigh, and we brought it back to camp. And the commander, Proch saw -- saw the\n-- the keg, he got ballistic. So finally he asked -- he was terribly upset, you know, because\nit\u2019s dangerous, you know, that it -- you getting drunk, you get loud. So finally he ordered\nthe keg to be half buried. You know what I mean by half buried?",
        "A: Half -- half the amount.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: The keg half buried. This is the keg, bury it that deep.",
        "A: Okay. And it was for medicinal purposes, and for the purposes of rubbing yourself,\nbecause this was a good disinfectant. So, all of a sudden, everybody claimed that he has\nlice, he has mites, he has this, he has that, and they need -- they need th -- some liquor. So\nfinally he got tired of it, and he br -- he m -- he broke a part of it, and spilled it in the\nground. But --",
        "A: Oh, hellow.",
        "A: This is where I learned to drink.",
        "A: First of all, it takes away fear from you, you know. It kind of -- it\u2019s a false courage, but it\ngives you a courage. And you -- you ability of -- of making s -- quick, sane decisions\ndecreases tremendously. There -- there shouldn\u2019t be any liquor on --",
        "A: You know. If I would have been Commander Proch, I would have, you know, destroyed\nthe barrel completely, you know. But on the other hand, if I would have been with\nRussian partisans, if -- if Commander Proch would have tried to break a barrel of liquor,\nthey would have killed him.",
        "A: Both.",
        "A: Both. There were many, many cases where beautiful women from outstanding families,\nbefore the war wouldn\u2019t have looked at -- at a given guy. And she became his girlfriend,\nbecause she felt that he is protected, better protected. Absolutely. Absolutely. And it -- I -\n- [ll tell you one thing, it\u2019s very difficult to be in judgment on these things.",
        "A: You know, very difficult to be in judgment. It was a matter of trying to survive, it was a\nmatter of trying to take revenge, it was a matter of defending yourself, and defending\nthose around you, or counting on this, that those around you will defend you. You know,\neven on going out on ac -- on action, it always depended with whom you are going, and\nwho is your back-up, because if you had good back-up, you had a better chance to come\nback home.",
        "A: Some of it was natural --",
        "A: -- that they, you know, either that, you know, were girl -- girlfriend and boyfriend from\nthe small town where they were, or they got to know one another 1n -- in the forest.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: No, she was just -- no, no, no. Sh-She was his girl.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: L-Let me say this to you. Yes, she was vulnerable, but the sexual promiscuity was quite -\n- quite there. Th -- look, what else was there? The life was threatened. Sometimes you\nwere hungry, sometimes you were cold. When you felt the urge, man or woman, wha --\nwhat is it?",
        "A: It -- 1t was not an animalistic -- if you ask me whether it was an animalistic order, that,\nyou know, a man went out and grabbed a girl, no, no.",
        "A: Either she was his girlfriend, or -- or neither one of them were attached, and you know,\nbut if -- if a woman was the girlfriend -- I\u2019m using, you know, that Moatcha Stralliska as\nan example. He was a very common guy, he was a very crude guy. He was a wonderful\nfella, you know, and as a companion in battle, you couldn\u2019t have asked for a better one.\nYou couldn\u2019t have asked for a better one. So he wound up with a girl. You know, as a\nmatter of fact, they live together, you know, until today.",
        "A: Before the war she would have never, never, never considered him as her mate. And th-\nthat -- you -- you have to bear in mind that it was a -- a life where every hour was danger,\nth -- I\u2019ll say it to you, that the danger of dying wasn\u2019t such a big deal, so -- so what is it?\nEverybody dies around you. The object is not to. The object is to defend yourself. The\nobject is, you know, to demand a price for your -- for your being killed. For instance, it\nwas an accepted omen, an accepted formula that the last bullet 1s never used on the\nenemy. The last bullet you always use -- was used on oneself. This is not heroism.",
        "A: This is instead of falling into the hands of the enemy and being tortured, and being, you\nknow, that -- at -- abused, and -- and beaten, and -- an-and what have you, and then be\nkilled? So the last bullet, if the situation was such, if the -- often, you know, we went out,\nand if a guy got injured, and he couldn\u2019t -- and we couldn\u2019t get to him, so he stayed and\nwaited on, you know, as close as the Germans or Ukrainians would come to him, and\nthen he killed himself. Let me lighten it for you, and tell you again a story that you will\nget a chuckle of. We, as I told you before, were staying in the forest in dig -- in dug-outs,\nin -- in deep basements, you know, with a stove inside, it was warm. You know, you\ncould undress and sleep comfortably. But as far as physical needs, to go to the toilet and\nwhat have you, you have to go outside. So what we did is we took a plank of wood, and\nwe tied it, or nailed it, you know, if we had nails, most cases we tied it between two trees,\nSO a person can sit down, and, you know, do whatever he needs to, and come back. It was\nvery cold, and as a person moved his bowels, it froze. And -- let me finish the story. And\nso it kept on, you know, freezing, and normally when -- you know, when you move your\nbowels, and if you have a hard surface, it creates like an ice cream cone, a reversed ice\ncream cone. So this kept growing, and growing, and growing until it reached the level of\nthe plank. And one of the guys got up at night, you know, no one wanted to go out at\nnight, but when you couldn\u2019t hold it any more, so -- and he ran out, and sat down on that\nplank, you know, to do -- to move his bowels. But as he sat down, that frozen point of the\naccumulated bowel movement penetrated his buttock, and he was bleeding. Until today,\nhe is known as the partisan who was injured by a pile of shit.",
        "A: Oh, did we have fun with it.",
        "A: So it wasn\u2019t all -- it wasn\u2019t all terrible. It was -- it was pretty terrible.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, positively not, positively not. I cannot tell you that every single person in our\ngroup had guns. Sometimes guns were taken away from the rightful owner, if you send\nout a group for a serious mission. But in most cases, you know, to take away a gun from a\nperson who ha -- the gun was everything that one could dream of. You couldn\u2019t -- you\ndidn\u2019t dream of gold, you didn\u2019t dream of diamonds, you -- you dreamt of getting a gun\nwith bullets. This was the only thing. But I can tell you that after the 23 months, when the\nRussian army advanced, the [indecipherable] army advanced, and I remember that the\nfirst battalion who encountered us was an -- a battalion commanded by an Ukrainian\nmajor. And he ordered that we surrender the weapons, we had to surrender the weapons.\nThis was an accepted -- and he said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d And we told him we are partisans,\nand we are Jews. So he says, \u201cJews? Jews fight in Tushkient on the -- on the black\nmarket.\u201d This was the greeting, you know. And this told me that I have nothing to look\nfor in the Soviet Union, and I better go home. And when I came home, I found an empty\ntown, 11 people left alive.",
        "A: Yeah. And told by some of my people that I knew from before the war, \u201cMiles, you better\nget out of here, because if you won\u2019t get out, they\u2019 ll finish you off.\u201d And I did.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t three, it was about 250 - 260. I would say 150 for sure, if not more.",
        "A: Yeah. If not -- yes.",
        "A: We -- when -- once the weapons were taken away from us, and once -- you know, we\nfollowed the army -- some immediately volunteered into the Soviet army.",
        "A: Some of them, like I, wanted to go back to our hometown. And some of them, it settled in\n-- in Lvov, or settled in -- in -- in Vlochov, or -- or what have you. It was everybody for --\nfor his own, but let me say this to you. I hope you will understand me right. Most of the\npeople that I am talking about were villagers, because the -- the -- the cr\u00e9me de la creme\ndid not survive. They did not survive not because they were creme de la cr\u00e9me, they were\ntoo soft. They didn\u2019t know how to -- you know, to resist, and -- and what have you. So,\nwhen the war was over, everybody seeked his own level, his own intellectual level, his\nown level. I must tell you that my sense for admiration and love, and you know, and\ncamaraderie with these people, that whenever they have a simfeh, you know what that is,\na -- a Bar Mitzvah, or a wedding, or a [indecipherable], or a funeral, of people that I was\nin the forest with, no matter how I busy -- I -- busy I am, it gets right out, and I\u2019m there.\nSpecial feeling. There\u2019s a spe -- there -- I have people in [indecipherable] you know, we\nare better than family. Do I have a lot in common with them? Frankly no. You understand\nwhat I am saying?",
        "A: But, what difference does it make?",
        "A: It\u2019s much more -- it\u2019s much important, much stronger.",
        "A: Well, when --",
        "A: In some cases yes, and in some cases, no. In some cases yes, and some cases no. I\u2019II tell\nyou the truth, I meet sometimes some women 1n particular that were young girls, were\nchildren in camp, I don\u2019t remember them. They remember me, but I don\u2019t remember\nthem.",
        "A: You know, because I was always active, you know, I was always, you know, leaving, and\nyou know, in one form or another.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. In the ghettos, yes.",
        "A: In -- in -- in the ghettos, even if it was illegal, there were secret schools.",
        "A: But in the forest, no. Songs.",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh yes.",
        "A: Only -- only high holidays. Only important holidays. You know, and frankly, you know,\nthose were days when young people had very little feeling for religion.",
        "A: If anything, it was anger and bitterness.",
        "A: Anger and bitterness, simply wa -- if there is a God, why is he permitting it?",
        "A: By all means. By all means. Food, first of all, you can go three, four days without food,\nand you will live. You can\u2019t go three, four days without water, and function. You get\ncrazy. And when the Germans tried to encircle us, and bombard us, they kept pushing us,\npushing us, and one time we were not aware of wh-where we are retreating, and we\nretreated on an elevation. It was almost like a mountain. This was not a mountainous\narea, but you know, at -- a high elevation. And we were without water. And we were\nwithout water for two and a half, three days. And I can tell you I remember seeing people\nurinate and drink it. And -- you know, and we were told not to do it, that this can create\ninsanity, you know. And finally we came to recognize that this is a very bad situation,\nthat we will tr -- we will die, not being killed, but die. And we broke through. Meisel was\nat that time the commander, you know, when I -- and I joined up with his group, and we\nbroke through, and we lost two people, and we got out of this area. But water is a terrible\n-- och, thirst, I can\u2019t begin to tell you how vicious it is. You know, you -- your tongue\ngets parched.",
        "A: There were streams.",
        "A: There were streams, and I-look, we were not that finicky, you know, that it must be\nboiled, and this and that. There were streams, and if not, we used to go and bring water,\nand carry water, keep a -- keep a -- you know, a bucket, or a bowl, and you know, the --\nthe living conditions were very primitive, very primitive. We washed ourselves, we\n[indecipherable] a lot, you know, whenever we came to water, you know, we used to\nshave our armpits, and our pubicle, you know, and make sure that -- we used to use\nkerosene for instance, you know, to prevent -- there is -- I don\u2019t know how to call it in\nEnglish, it\u2019s a -- an insect that buries itself in the human skin.",
        "A: No, not lice.",
        "A: Mende.",
        "A: Mende veshkey.",
        "A: Right. The pubicles, and the armpits.",
        "A: And sometimes even the hair. Hair not so much.",
        "A: If it was badly infected, yes.",
        "A: Drove you crazy.",
        "A: Drove you crazy. And the only way how to get it out is by squeezing one at a time.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. These we --",
        "A: These were pretty days, but they were not pretty days.",
        "A: To Shmoil?",
        "A: No, no, I -- you -- a person never becomes a totally different person. A person broadens\nhis horizons so becomes more tolerant or less tolerant. Becomes nicer, or becomes uglier,\nbut a person doesn\u2019t change. I believe that people are what they are, and they remain\nwhat they are. Did I go into the underground knowing that I will survive for 23 months?\nNo, didn\u2019t expect it. But as I told you, I wanted to make sure that whoever wants my hat,\nwill pay for it, and pay for it dearly. Now, this sounds like bombastic talk, you know, and\nI don\u2019t want to be bombastic with you. The struggle for survival was purely natural,\nalmost animalistic. Almost animalistic. Human nature is to survive. Let a plane fly by and\nstart dropping bombs, you know, you will be the first one to run, and I will be the first\none to run. This is human nature. But to come back to the question that you are asking\nme, whether this changed me, oh yes, it made a tremendous impact on me. I grew up ina\nhome, in a gentle home, and a respectful home, and a -- a soft home. You know what I\nmean by a soft home? And the experiences, and they were experiences that were pretty\nugly, pretty ugly. All kinds of things. And yet, there were moments of glory, and\nmoments of feeling proud. Now, I told you a minute ago that I don\u2019t want to sound\nbombastic, and I am not a deeply religious man, but I truly believe that 1t was almost\ndestiny, if there 1s such a thing, that put me in this path, and I am very, very grateful that I\nhave the opportunity to do the work that I am doing, because it gives meaning, it gives\npurpose. Do I go back to the days of Shmoil? Very often. And not necessarily in sadness,\nsometimes --",
        "A: -- in glory, sometimes in happiness. But I go back to the days of Shmoil. I think of my\nmother very, very often. Very often.",
        "A: Yes, because it\u2019s connected. And of course, with mother I was in the difficult days also. I\nam more -- father died a natural death, so whether he was young, or whether he was old,\nit\u2019s immaterial, he died a natural death. Nobody robbed him from us. My mother, my\nsister was robbed from me. That was taken by force. My sister\u2019s children, wonderful kids,\nwonderful kids, but so were others, you know. I\u2019m not an exception with that. So there\nwere days of feeling very depressed, and very down, and very almo -- n-no pity. No pity\non each other. No pity on myself, but just days when it got to you. And days when we\ncame back from a mission and it was successful, days of glory. When I came back from\nthis village that night, I felt so good, I can\u2019t begin to tell you.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. There are people that say, \u201cHow can you talk about it, when you took\nsomebody else\u2019s life?\u201d I say, \u201cThis is taking the life of a -- of a -- of a creature that had\nno right to be on this earth.\u201d Because 1f we wouldn\u2019t have done what we had done, there\nwould be other women and children.",
        "A: Still do.",
        "A: There -- they\u2019re crazy.",
        "A: Being chased, fighting, and you know, running and not making any distance, and you\nknow, trying to load the -- the -- I had the Russian peppashah, with the round disk.",
        "A: It\u2019s a hand gish -- a hand -- a --",

        "A: Dreams are dreams, you don\u2019t make an appointment to have a dream. Dreams take you\nback 30 years, 40 years, two days, an hour ago, you know, and it gets all mixed up, you\nknow. But I am active at night, very active. Ask Chris, she\u2019Il tell you. I talk, I talk\nRussian, I talk Polish, I --",
        "A: Yes. I yell.",
        "A: Sometimes.",
        "A: It was a very painful moment --",
        "A: -- very painful moment. I -- believe it or not, but in the forest, I did not think about the\nfact that our people are being annihilated. I thought about fighting, about surviving, about\nkilling as much as I could, you know, to come out on the top of it. When I came into\nTomashev, and I saw the town, it was a cemetery. I felt that I\u2019m walking on tombstones. I\ndidn\u2019t need that friend to tell me to leave because I am in danger, because you know,\nthere were many, many people that came back, including Chris, you know, that came\nback, and you know, the extreme -- the extreme right wingers took care of them.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t need it, I -- I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t breathe the air there, I -- I choked. You know,\nit was a beautiful community. It was a community that offered everything that cultural\nlife and a cultural society has to offer. Everything, you know, in all these old-fashioned\ntraditions. When you -- at that time when I looked at them, they sounded silly, you know,\nto marry off a -- a -- a nitwit, you know, with another nitwit, they -- you know, it was\nsilly. Today when I think about it, I look how beautiful it was. How beautiful, how\ngenerous it was. How humane it was, you know. In a community where, you know,\ntraditions prevailed, and even the transition from, you know, Orthodoxy, and from piety,\ninto modern -- into modern life, 1t was not a transition from piety and from scholarship to\nbecome heedens, you know, it is embracing a broader culture. Embracing, you know, a --\na greater set of values, although the set of values, I have never taken for granted, and I\nnever give them up. The values that come with the life that was, are so exceptional, and\nso dear, and so extra special. You understand that it -- you -- sometimes I feel that I -- I\nshouldn\u2019t be talking, I should soak this up and swallow it. Because this is my -- this is my\ninner Shmoil. Just swallow it, because not everything you can put on the table.",
        "A: Internalize it.",
        "A: Internalize it.",
        "A: Because either it sounds that you are, you know, bathing and -- and -- and -- and you\u2019re\nwallowing in the ho-horribleness, or bathing in false worry, and neither is the case.",
        "A: Few days.",
        "A: These were times when you didn\u2019t plan ahead, you play -- you planned for the day, you\nknow. All I knew is that I cannot remain in Tomashev, that you know, th -- I -- I will\nhave nightmares, and then in particular since I was warned to leave, so I felt I had to\nleave. So I went into Lublin. And in Lublin, this was the time where the first Polish\ngovernment was forming. You know, if you -- you ro -- you remember, the Poles divided\nup in Russia into two, it was an [indecipherable] army that went through Teheran, Israel,\nyou know, and they stayed and fought on the side of the allies, and there was the -- the --\nI have a -- a blank mind on the name of ma -- th -- the women. There was a Polish unit, a\nPolish army that fought -- decided to come into Poland, to liberate Poland with the Soviet\narmy, and help establish a -- Vonda Rosherefska, it was her name -- and to help establish\na new Polish regime, a Socialist regime, so to say. So Lublin became a very viable place,\nand -- and since in particular this was a time when people came back from every camp,\nfrom every corner, you know, and they were looking to find out whether someone 1s alive\nor not. So it became a very viable Jewish center. And I wanted to be there, hoping that\nmaybe I\u2019ll find something out about my sister, about her children. About Mother I didn\u2019t\nhave much hope, because I -- you know, I didn\u2019t think even if she wouldn\u2019t been killed,\nthat she would have survived these horrors. And I settled myself in, I got an apartment,\nand -- and I needed to make a living, so I got into partnership with Leon Fellheldner.\nFeldhandler is the -- one of the two commanders of the death camp of Sobibor, that have\nbroken out. It was Sasha Alexander Petroski --",
        "A: -- and Leon Feldhandler. Leon Feldhandler was a son of a rabbi of a small town called\nIshbitza, not far from Tomashev. And we became partners in -- in selling soft leather,\nbecause this -- his area was an area where they -- where they were producing, you know,\nthey were treating hides, and converting it to leather. And one night -- he was not active\nin any politics or anything, one night Polish extremists entered the house where he was,\nand killed him. Now, there were many killings after the war, you know that. But this\nkilling was so painful in particular for the role that he has played. Here is a man, the son\nof a rabbi, who was able to enter a role of leadership in uprising, in rebellion, and revenge\nin a death camp. And to come out of it, and then be killed when he was hoping to start\nbuilding his own life, a new life, very painful, very bitter. So we stayed in po -- in Lodz --\nin Lublin for -- oh, I would say, three, four months.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Where -- where was I to go? Where was I to go? You lived under -- you -- you lived, you\nknow, with circumstances. You --",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. Yes, yes. A lot.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: He was a marvelous man. He was a marvelous man. He was a learned man. He -- he --\nthere -- he wasn\u2019t religious any more. This war, this experience turned him off, but a\nscholarly type of a guy, but not a scholar. He was a -- an every day guy, and a good guy,\na good looking man. And he started dating a girl, she was a beautiful, beautiful girl, and\nwhen he was assassinated, she had a nervous breakdown. She wound up in an institution.\nWhat happened to her later, I don\u2019t know. But I left Lublin, and went to Warsaw, but in\nWarsaw you couldn\u2019t stay anywhere, because all of Warsaw was destroyed. So, it -- it\nwas a rebel -- a rubble. So we went to Lodz. Lodz was not destroyed.",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. No, it was I, for the time being. It is in Lodz where I met Chris.",
        "A: No. You see, because I am thinking of Lodz, I am beginning to think in terms of we. No,\nto Lodz I came by myself. I mean, I had friends, I had people that I dealt with. You know,\nthere was Reuben Russet who was in -- in Brazil, you know, that we tried to get out of,\nyou know, and tried to regroup, and reconstitute, and -- and do something with our lifes.\nAnd I met Chris --",
        "A: I owned a restaurant.",
        "A: A nightclub.",
        "A: With dances, and with music, and with food.",
        "A: I had to do something.",
        "A: It started off that, you know, there was a need for places to eat, because no one had\nhouseholds, everybody came in, you know. So Reuben Russet, my friend, said, \u201cLet\u2019s\nopen a restaurant.\u201d I said, \u201cLet\u2019s open a restaurant.\u201d So we opened a restaurant.",
        "A: And it went off very well, you know, it -- you know, it was good, you know.",
        "A: We hired people.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t cook. He -- he shopped.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I ran it, but then we discovered that in the back of the restaurant is a big hall that used to\nbe something, I don\u2019t know what. So he turns to me, and he says, \u201cThis would be very\ngood for a dance hall.\u201d So we combined it, and we called it Little Hell.",
        "A: Pigelko. And it was quite good. So Chris, with her sisters, came back from -- you know,\nfrom being liberated and sent to Germany.",
        "A: She came back and -- and, you know, she found her uncle --",
        "A: -- who was in Lublin.",
        "A: In Lodz, excuse me. And we -- and one night she came with a -- a friend of hers from\nbefore the war, that he took her out for -- th -- he wanted -- basically he wanted her to\nhave dinner, and she didn\u2019t want to eat, she was too proud to tell him that he -- that she is\nhungry. So she said she ate before she came.",
        "A: Yeah. She was gorgeous. She was gorgeous looking girl. And I -- I was a good dancer, so\nI asked -- I asked her partner whether I can invite her to dance, and of course, he said yes.\nAnd we danced a lot that night, and we got to know one another, and we kept on knowing\none another for awhile. And she brought me up once to a gathering of people that were in\ncamp together -- you know, probably this story from her testimony, and I came up and\nsome of her friends said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t marry him. He -- he is not for you, he is too -- too\nsmart, too -- too -- too -- too slick.\u201d",
        "A: And -- however, I liked her a lot and she liked me, and her uncle liked me a lot. Hanya\nwas for me, Rainya was against me.",
        "A: And we got married, and I\u2019ll tell you something about getting married. Ev -- everything\nhas a story.",
        "A: We were in Warsaw. We went in to see a couple of friends of hers with whom she was in\ncamp together. And walking the street I come across Rabbi Kahanna, who was the chief\nrabbi of the Polish army. He was -- he had the rank of colonel, I think, at that time. And\nhe was in Lvov, the professor that taught me Hebrew literature. And he was very happy\nthat he saw me, and I was delighted to see him, because he came back from Russia with\nthat -- the advance for the Polish army. So I told him, I say, \u201cProfessor,\u201d [indecipherable],\nI don\u2019t know how to translate it, but Sir Professor, you know. \u201cChris and I are getting\nmarried, and I would very much like you to give us,\u201d -- you know, \u201cto perform the\nceremony.\u201d And he thought for a moment, and he said, \u201cI\u2019Il do it.\u201d Joan, this was the first\nmarriage in Lodz performed by a high ranking officer of the Polish army, my professor,\nTed [indecipherable], it was a modern -- it was not like the old rabbis, you know,\n[indecipherable] around three times, and you know. It -- it had meaning, his sermon had\nmeaning, you know. He talked about what we have just gone through, and what we are\nfacing, and you know, how the future needs to be looked. It was a very meaningful --\nvery, very meaningful marriage ceremony. Very meaningful. And I managed -- I\nmanaged to establish myself, and with -- I dealt with all kinds of things. Among the most\nimportant thing is I have established a contact with the Polish government where they\nwere paying the raberats with [indecipherable] you know, before war prices, and for\nprices from before war, you couldn\u2019t -- a cookie, you know, cost as much as a day\u2019s\nwork. So I made a proposition to him, I say, \u201cI will supply you food for the workers, on\npre-war prices, because you must pay them in pre -- 1n -- but you don\u2019t pay me in dollars,\nor in zloty, but you pay me in goods, in textile goods.\u201d",
        "A: So I got textile goods for pre-war prices, and I supplied him with pork belly, with -- with\nonions, with beans, with all kinds of stuff. And all I needed 1s an official document from\nthe Polish government, that I am buying that stuff for the use of the Polish government,\nbecause I bought this on the black market, I bought it on the prevailing prices of after the\nwar. So I bought it for -- for black market prices, sold it for har prices, and got in return,\ntextile on har prices, that I could sell on the open market and not be afraid that it will be\nconfiscated, be -- I -- I don\u2019t think I -- I -- yo -- you are with me, I probably confused you\nby now. But this is the way it -- I do wa --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well -- no, it\u2019s bou-bought legal and sold legal --",
        "A: -- this is the important thing.",
        "A: This is the important thing. And things were going very well, until some local guy I was\nready to load up a -- a boxcar with pork belly, and attach it to a passenger train to take it\ninto Lodz, and he stopped me, and I gave him the documents, and he said, \u201cI need to\ncheck them out.\u201d He was a bureaucrat. And in the meanwhile the pork belly was standing\nwith 90 degrees outside, and maggots start crawling over it, and I needed to hire people,\nand pay them to bury it. And also, the government was a little uncomfortable, and they\nstarted to distance themself from it. To make the story short, I had to stop this. This was a\nvery, very profitable business, I started making money. And again I was told, it\u2019s time for\nyou to move on.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, without any question. Without any question, it -- yeah.",
        "A: Finally she -- she became -- she became my best friend, because we raised Rainya,\nRainya was our daughter.",
        "A: She went to school, Hanya -- Hanya was -- Hanya was a scholarly type of a person, and\nthey needed intelligent young people in the party.",
        "A: And the party send her, you know, for schooling. And if she wouldn\u2019t have left Poland,\nshe would have remained in -- on a high level in the political hierarchy of Poland, you\nknow.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And Rainya, when we were ready to leave, we gave Rainya a choice, she can stay with\nHanya, and Hanya will take care of you, or you come with us, and whatever we will do,\nwe will do with that -- there\u2019s no stabi -- stability with us, because we are on the go, and\nyou know, we want to get into Berlin, because we want to leave from Berlin. I wanted to\ngo to Israel.",
        "A: To Palestine.",
        "A: You know. So we gave her the choice, she can come with us, or stay with Hanya, and she\ndecided that she didn\u2019t care much for Hanya\u2019s husband, and she, you know -- and she\nstayed with us, and we educated her, and we brou -- I -- I look upon her as a daughter\ntoday. You know, she --",
        "A: I\u2019m sure of it.",
        "A: True.",
        "A: It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true.",
        "A: Bear in mind, number one, she was Chris\u2019s sister.",
        "A: Number two, we came out, we all were orphans, we all lost everybody, we all were\nlonesome, we all were alone. You ask me how come -- you asked me before, did I fall in\nlove with Chris immediately. Of course. She was a beautiful girl, and when I started\ntalking to her, I saw the roots, you know, that wa -- became very obvious, because the\nwar was over, you know. You were not looking for partisans. You were looking for a life\ncompanion, you know.",
        "A: Of course, the criteria was different, and she was the right person. I regret deeply that I\nnever met her mother, because she was a very, very unusual, very special human being.\nOf the stories that I heard about her, you know, so --",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely --",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: And we -- we came to Berlin, we stayed in Frapensai, and we -- I wanted to go to\nPalestine, but you know, Cyprus came about at that time, and the pictures of seeing Jews\nbehind barbed wire was just repulsive, and -- and Chris told me, I -- you know, she says,\n\u201cT think I\u2019m pregnant, and\u201d -- which she wasn\u2019t -- \u201cand I am not going to go to wind up\nin Cyprus behind wi -- barbed wire, I had enough of barbed wire.\u201d So we went and we\napplied to the American embassy, and the guy who interviewed her, saw Chris\u2019s number,\nand he was very moved, and very -- and he was a very nice person, and he expedited it,\nand --",
        "A: Yes. And we left in February of 1947, we left for America.",
        "A: No, we came to New York.",
        "A: We came to New York. We lived in New York for about eight months, nine months. I\nhad a good job, too good, and one day I came home and I said to Chris, \u201cI\u2019m quitting.\u201d\nShe says, \u201cWhy are you quitting?\u201d I said, \u201cThe job is too good. I keep getting raises, and\nraises, you know I\u2019Il wind up working for him. I don\u2019t want to work for anybody. I want\nto be in business for myself.\u201d You know, so he was a very nice person, you know. He\nwas an importer of Italian olive oil, and provolones, and you know, a lot, shiploads, very\nlarge import, and I was in charge of his warehouse. And I quit, and I was going to start\nlooking what I\u2019m going to do, and I visited a friend in Vineland, and it was springtime,\nand it was green, and it was beautiful, and serene, and I liked it. And I said -- this was the\ntime when Jewish Agricultural Society helped the survivors settle themselves in on -- on -\n- you know, on farms. And I applied, and they approved it, and I bought a farm, and I\nfarmed for about -- \u00b048 - 49 -- about four years. And -- but I realized that this is not for\nme, and you know, I\u2019m not going to spend my life being a farmer, so I established myself\nin the fuel oil business, in the heating business, and from it I got into the gasoline\nbusiness, and the gasoline business is where I really made my business career in the\nUnited States.",
        "A: You got it.",
        "A: You got it, you got it.",
        "A: And -- go ahead.",
        "A: I -- I enjoyed doing it because I was my own boss. But I did recognize that, you know,\nfarming is a lifestyle, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not our -- it\u2019s not a vocation, it\u2019s not a business, it\u2019s a\nlifestyle. It was not my lifestyle. I, you know, lived in Vineland, and I organized the\nfarmers. I formed the Jewish Poultry Farmer\u2019s Association.",
        "A: Yes. And -- but I got out of it, and let me say this to you. Ever since I came to the States,\nI always was active in something. Even in Berlin yet, you know, I was active, you know,\nin organizing [indecipherable] and -- and acting in unison, making us, you know, a more\ndecisive factor, and so on, and so on. And I was very active in [indecipherable] you\nknow, from day one, I was very active in our town, [indecipherable]. And Yets\nGreenberg was the first one in America who organized a -- a small group called the Hora,\nto remember. And I became part of that, and when Carter asked [indecipherable] to\norganize, and -- organize a -- a group of people, and come back to him with a proposal as\nto what we are recommending as a means of remembrance of the Holocaust, I was invited\nto be on the advisory board, because it was too late already, to get into the original board.\nBut a few months later, when the cun -- the United States Holocaust Memorial Council\nwas organized, I was appointed by Carter to the council.",
        "A: And the rest 1s history.",
        "A: Good question. Jonah I contacted immediately when I came to Lodz, because I learned --\nI knew that he is alive because he was in Palestine, but I got his address. And there were\npeople that came back from Siberia, the resettlement was a prolonged process.",
        "A: That told me that my brother is in the southern republics, in Toshkint, and my sister is in -\n- somewhere in Siberia, I don\u2019t remember now the name. But I got both addresses, and I\nwrote them letters to tell them that Mother is gone, and Esther is gone with her family,\nthat I am the only one alive. And my brother send me the address of -- Froma send me the\naddress of Jonah. This is how it worked.",
        "A: And they came back here, and -- and unfortunately they came at a time when I was\npacking rather rapidly to get out of Poland. So they followed to Germany, and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, Peshe came to Israel.",
        "A: And Shlomo remained in Germany because he had a son-in-law who developed a very,\nvery serious case of Parkinson. And L-dopa was very restricted in the United States,\nwhere in Germany, you know, they gave it out rather freely. And so he was stuck in\nGermany. And he died there.",
        "A: West Germany.",
        "A: West Germany.",
        "A: No, we -- it -- when I came to -- to Israel, we met together, and then Jonah came here,\nand Jonah has a son, you know, a polio child.",
        "A: And he was hoping that they will be able to do something for him, but they didn\u2019t. It\u2019s an\nunfortunate thing, this is --",
        "A: So there were sad occasions, and there were happy occasions, you know.",
        "A: And as I told you I -- I -- I kind of felt that I owe it to myself, and to those around me to\nbe active, to do something, to -- t-to give back a little bit. And I gave back a little bit.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: No, I -- I -- I think that 1-1f anything, maybe what I would like to talk more about, and\nyou were chastising me for stepping away from my personal story, I think that the world\nthat was, is not sufficiently known in America. And I think that we need to find ways and\nmeans of documenting it, of writing 1t down, of discussing it, and making it part of our\nheritage. The world that was, I -- I\u2019m talking about the pre-war Europe.",
        "A: Has so much richness, so much positiveness, so much creativity. Again, let\u2019s not get\ncarried away with -- you know, with Don Quixote stories. There was a lot of poverty,\nthere was a lot of struggling, there was a lot of bitter life in the eastern European\ncountries. There were -- there was more poverty than richness. But you take the\ntraditions, you take even the -- the world that started crumbling, you know, the Hassidic\nworld, the ultra Orthodox world. A world, you know, that went back to the 19\" century,\nto the 18\" century. Even as they were being diminished in their importance and size, they\ncarried a crescendo, you know, of elevations, you know, that were fantastic, fantastic.\nAnd they were -- they were not the leaders, but perhaps they were the inspirers of those\nthat stepped in into new life, into modern life, and trying to become part of the civilized\nEurope, playing a very major role -- a very major role in civilizing Europe. Jews have\nplayed so many important roles, and paid such a handsome rent, wherever they lived, that\nwe cannot talk enough about it. But I\u2019m talking about a handsome rent, I am not talking\nabout money. I\u2019m talking about contributions that are made in the field of science, in the\nfield of arts, in the field of judicial -- judicial progress in organization. You take the\ncountries, you know, first of all, of course, the ones on the front [indecipherable] Kalitsia\nwas ripe for it because they encouraged. They were more liberal, and they were receptive\nto Jewish involvement. But even the -- you know, in the Soviet Union? You take the\nperiod when the Soviet Union came to be, and you go through the leaders, and you will\nsee that the people that really, you know, introduced Communism to the world, with a\ndream that they are carrying a better tomorrow, were Jews. You take Germany, the\nWeimar Republic, and study it, and who were they? Jewish intellectuals. You take the\ncreation, the -- the -- the -- the writers, and -- and -- and poets, and philosophers of\nHungary, of Czechoslovakia, you know, of -- of -- of Germany, and it moved to Poland,\nand it came from Poland -- you know, I mentioned to you Vilno before, Vilno was a\ncenter not only of modern Jewish literature, a very strong center. Vilno was also a --\ncenter not far from Vilno, the [indecipherable] the great [indecipherable] scholarship that\nhave set levels for the Jewish people, of world -- world prominence. World prominence.\nWe d -- we made a bad mistake 1n my opinion. In building the museum, you know, we\nhave done many wonderful things, but we made a bad mistake by not going down two\nstories deeper, and allowing space for telling the story of the world that was. We must do\nthat. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s something that we missed. You can\u2019t understand the importance of today\nunless you are capable of evaluating and giving credit, and discredit, whatever comes, to\nthe world that was. It was a beautiful life, of Jews that struggled, didn\u2019t have it easy, but\nin spite of this, you know, what they have done, what they have done for Poland.",
        "A: Don\u2019t thank me.",
        "A: Well, if I have done that, then I am re -- very pleased.",
        "A: Thank you. You said something about photograph?",
        "A: This is a friend of mine on the left side, the blonde fella, his name is Hooberman, and we\nwere members of a youth club, it was called shamare atsyere, and in this club, we also\ncreated a -- a chess team. And here I am trying to be -- trying to beat him. I wasn\u2019t too\nmuch of a chess player, I wasn\u2019t too good at it.",
        "A: What happened to him, I don\u2019t know. I am on the left, and I probably am here 16 or 17\nyears old.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A:  \u00b035. February the 10\", 1935.",
        "A: That handsome guy happens to be me, more or less in the same period.",
        "A: It probably is an insignia, either from a sports club, or from the -- the shamare atsyere,\neither one.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: 1936.",
        "A: This is the group that I was telling you, the shamare atsyere group, and I -- some people\nthat are in this picture are no longer with us. I am embarrassed to tell you that a good\nmany of them I don\u2019t remember the names any more. But I remember each and every one\nof them, and I -- in my mind I remember stories of wh -- what -- what we did together,\nyou know, or -- or certain segments, but if you ask me to identify the names one by one, I\ncan\u2019t do it. You notice me, I am sitting on the first row on the left hand side, second from\nthe left.",
        "A: The picture on the left is my mother, and -- and we are walking in Lvov, on the main\nLigiornof is the name of -- the main -- the main corso in -- in Lvov. It\u2019s -- 1t was a\nbeautiful, beautiful city, and Mother came to visit me. I was studying in Lvov in those\ndays. And I dressed up in my best, and took my mother out to -- you know, to visit places\nin -- in Lvov. The picture on the right is my mother, I think it\u2019s -- the picture is taken a\nlittle later than this one. Probably \u201939, maybe. It looks to me like this was a picture taken\nfor a passport, and we lodged it, I think so. You notice that Mother is wearing a wig,\nMother was a pious woman, very religious woman, but a fantastic, fantastic achiever.\nGreat lady.",
        "A: This photo is a photo of myself right after the war, when I came out from the\nunderground, and I came to Lvov, and I took the first picture for a kankarta -- for -- for a\npassport. And at that time I -- I weighed the least that I remember myself, 140 some\npounds.",
        "A: On the left it\u2019s me again, in Lodz, 1946, and next to me is my beloved, Chris, a beautiful,\nbeautiful person, in and out. Just as beautiful inside as outside. And we have a lot in\ncommon, we had a lot in common in memories. And she comes from a beautiful family\nand I regret very much that I didn\u2019t have an opportunity to get to know her family, and\nI\u2019m sure that if my mother would have known her, she would have loved her just as\nmuch.",
        "A: The top picture is a picture of me on the marine perch, as we are entering the harbor in\nNew York, after a crossing that lasted 16 days from ha -- Hamburg to New York. If you\nlook closer at the picture, you will see the Statue of Liberty is right smack over my head.\nThe bottom picture is Chris and I again on the same boat, on the marine perch, as we are\nstanding and admiring the constant flow of cars on th -- the west side -- west side\nhighway.",
        "A: The picture on the top is I\u2019m standing with Chris, and with my sister-in-law, Rainya, this\nis Chris\u2019s younger sister. And the picture on the bottom is in Vineland, where, when we\ncame there, we bought a farm, and I raised poultry for about three to four years. And you\nsee the -- the collection that I have from the day, of a couple of buckets of eggs. We\ndone? Good.\nEnd of Tape #5\nConclusion of Interview\n"
