        "A: Well, my name 1s, my real name is Estella Rubinlicht and I was born in Poland in a town\ncalled Lublin, the town that became very infamous because of the concentration camp that\nwe had next door my --------. I was born to a nice Jewish family, traditional, observant. Both\nof my parents were professional people which was a little unusual for the circumstances of\nJews living in Poland at that time. My mother was a dentist who put herself through school,\nwhile my father was a court-appointed interpreter in three languages, and I also had a little\nbrother, who was seven years younger than I was. The town of Lublin had about 140,000 to\n150,000 inhabitants. We had a very famous yeshiva, and also I would say that about 60,000\nout of the population have been Jews. Before the war, I was little but we kind of enjoyed\nnormal life for Jews. We were allowed to practically do everything, except Jews couldn't\nhold any government jobs, and also going into the university was very complicated being a\nJew -- there was a special quota for Jews. But I happened to attend private schools, both\nprimary school and high school both private, because simply there was a better education\nmy parents could afford. Public school was compulsory but high school was not available to\nall the population. I had a very happy childhood, very close-knit family, lots of love, two\nsets of grandparents, not too big of a family, we were not a very large family; but kind of\nwell-to-do, not extravagant, and very happy. I had a happy childhood until when I was\ntwelve years old the war broke out. The rumor started in 1939 in the summer when we as\nteenagers were going to the swimming pool and doing all kinds of summer things, and the\nrumor started that there was going to be a war. My father at dinnertime -- we always had\ndinner together, that was the family thing to do -- told us that we had to be prepared ----------\n-- and maybe we should accumulate some more food, because for a certain time things are\ngoing to be going on that are going to be bad. Nobody ever expected what is going to\nhappen. People thought that maybe there would be a war that would blow over, and that's\nabout it. I mean, in the history of the world never anything like that happened. So the Jews\nwere quite sedate. They kind of thought, you know, that whatever happens, just happens.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd it wasn't until suddenly on the first of September, 1939, that we woke up to severe\nbombing and not being prepared and of knowing what it 1s really, we all went down to the\nbasement and stayed there while the raid was over. When we came out, there was a\nrealization that we had war and that Germany has attacked Poland. Well, there was panic,\nwe didn't know what to do, and people were completely at the stage of panic, they didn't\nknow what to expect. Well, this state of affairs did not take too long, because after four days\nthe Polish government went away from Poland and the next day on the fifth day of this\ndisarray, the Germans came in. Now, all I saw was these mad Germans running around the\ncity and running into homes and just grabbing everything they could. So into our home a\ngroup of Germans came in, tore the watch and everything they could off my mother's hands,\ngrabbed all the things we had, took whatever they wanted to, broke china, beat us up, and\nwent out. That was my first encounter with what the Germans are really like. Then they\nwere running around the streets and they decided that they want men, so they gave an order\nthat so-and-so many men have to come to a certain place and of course we were very\nworried. A lot of people at that time, as I recall, were running away to Russia, east, and we\neven had an opportunity, our family to go. There was a bus that our neighbor owned and he\nwanted all of us to go to Russia. But you know, my mother was a homemaker, she had her\nlivelihood there, they just couldn't part with things, they didn't know how to go to the\nunknown. And so, placidly, most of the Jewish population stayed. Some of them did go\neast, but my family decided to stay. Well, the next -- it was 1939, of course schools were\nclosed, the Germans were riding around, there was a curfew after seven and we were right\naway given yellow our stars saying \"Jude,\" that means Jew, we had to wear one on the left\nshoulder in front and one in the back so they could see us from the back and front. And we\nwere living under curfew with very little food, not knowing what's going to happen next.\nNow, what happened in the period between 1939 and 1942 was the fact that the Jewish\npopulation was getting smaller and smaller and smaller because through different actions of\ntaking people away to concentration camps the Germans would round up a certain area of\nthe city, take out the Jews, beat them up, and ship them some place off. We did not know\nwhat happened to these people, what happened to the families, because we had no contact\nwith newspapers, radios, everything was taken away from us. So we merely existed, not in\nour own homes any more. As the Jewish population was getting smaller and smaller, the\nGermans have been giving the Jews smaller quarters to live, and because they wanted them\nall together, they were forming what wasn't even a ghetto yet but an area that was dedicated\nfor the Jews. And they would put, like, four or five families in one apartment so that when\nthey need to take them out, 1t would be easier for them to have them all together. Well, we\nlived through many of those actions, and fortunately both of my parents were working --\nworking so that the Germans needed them; therefore, we were spared at the beginning,\nbecause my mother as a dentist was working in a hospital and the Germans needed care.\nNow, my father also had a job, in the administration of the ghetto, so they also needed him.\nBut as I was already 14 years old, I needed a job on my own in order to be spared. So I got a\nlittle job in the bank helping out. And that's how through all these actions we were able to\nsomehow survive. Food was scarce. My mother was getting a little bit of food from\npeasants who were coming still to her for medical advice, and so we survived until April\n1942. By April 1942 was one of those big actions where they took away a lot of Jewish\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\npeople, and out of 60,000 only 4,000 survived. We were given special passes, special Reich\ndocuments like passports, and these were the 4,000 Jews that actually were working for the\nGermans and that the Germans decided to keep for a little bit longer. We still did not know\nwhere all the people went. Well, the state of living was just terrible, you know -- Germans\nwere coming in, cutting off the beards of the Jewish people, they were beating them up, they\nwere taking them out haphazardly, they were demanding things, soldiers were running\naround and taking advantage of women, they plundered. There was practically nothing any\nmore because we had lived in a little tiny village outside of Lublin where they put these\n4,000 people to live; very inhumanly, in little shacks, in little homes where very poor\npeasants lived -- they had to be evacuated and they were given apartment in the city that the\nJews lived in. You could see a horse and a cow on the third floor balcony because these\npeople took all their belongings with them; we were put in that little village where these\npeople lived before. There they put a barbed wire and called it a ghetto. This was a ghetto\nbut not in the idea of a ghetto like in Warsaw, this was a ghetto, this was a settlement of\nJews which were surrounded by barbed wire and constantly watched so there was no way\nout. The people that watched, the soldiers that watched the ghetto were mostly Lithuanians\nand Ukrainians. They were helping the Germans to keep order because the Germans could\nnot be bothered with these little things like watching the Jews, they wanted them when they\nneeded them. And in that little village they were coming in like four in the morning wearing\nwhite gloves, dressed to kill as clean as they always were, and beat up the Jews and taking\nthem out again. That state of affairs lasted from April '42 until November '42. I was still\nwith my parents and I was still with my brother. In that little place we still managed to go\nout a little bit because we were young, and that's when I met my present husband.",
        "Q: Now, to back up a little bit, were there many children like your brother, your little brother,\nor how did you manage to keep him hidden with you? You had to work --",
        "A: OK. At the times I just described, I was still with my parents, so we were still together, and\nwe still had some means to buy some food on the black market. So my brother was my\nresponsibility, because up until that moment I was still home and my parents cared for me. I\neven managed to go out for ice cream, not late in the evening, but we had a little garden\nnext to the little house where we lived and the Germans made sure that the Jews tilled the\nsoil and grew some flowers because they had to show to the International Red Cross how\nnice the Jews had it in those ghettos. And every morning at six o'clock we would be taken\nout through a gate to work and taken to work in the city on buses and trucks. And every day\nat six o'clock, they would bring us back, and then there was curfew. So that was the life that\nsummer. Now, not far away from this little village was the concentration camp, --------\n[name of camp] and we saw the inmates of the concentration camp working on the roads\nwearing these uniforms, and that's all we saw. We knew that there is a camp there, and we\nsaw the people, emaciated in these striped uniforms, showing us -- like this -- that they are\nhungry. But we were always in groups watched by the Germans and we were not allowed to\nhave any contact with these people, they were digging roads. And we knew that something\nis going on there, something very, very bad, because the concentration camp was not far\naway. In fact, our little town was called -------- and the big concentration was called --------\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n[both names]. So there was a little bit interconnected this whole area. There was an incident\nwhere friend of my present husband had a sandwich, and so this Jew asked him for food and\nasked the guard -- whoever he was, I don't know if it was a German or Lithuanian -- if he\nmay give him the sandwich, the guard said \"yes\" and as soon as he gave him the sandwich\nhe shot him, he shot this friend of my husband. So there was the situation. I still was with\nmy parents, I'm stretching it all the time because it really was the last time I was with my\nparents in that little ghetto. And having a very sheltered life and having a good home life, I\nreally never thought was life is all about and how to go about managing it on my own. We\ndidn't grow up as fast over there as children grow up today, and being 14, 15, really meant\nto be under the care of your parents all the time, especially when there were no schools -- I\nwas completely cut off from school for three years already. It wasn't until November 1942\nthat the tragedy happened. One early morning -- (she takes deep breath) I have to admit and\nI have to tell you there was no way to escape at that time. Even if we would like to stay\noutside of the ghetto, there was no way to do anything, there was no people that would take\nus in. They were hunting Jews all over. We had no papers, we could not get a job, we could\nnot get a place to live, we really couldn't go out and stay on the other side of the ghetto. It\nwas impossible. They would find you sooner or later. It wouldn't be the Germans, it would\nbe the Poles that were the Nazis. But that was happening all the time. So it was on the\nmorning in 1942 in November -- I don't know if it was the 6th or the 7th of November that\nwe were woken up at three in the morning that we were told that everybody has to come to\nthis big square because we cannot stay home any more. And we kind of had a feeling that\nthis is the end of this little settlement of the Jews, because we heard rumors that Jewish\nvillages and settlements had stopped existing all around in Poland. So we knew that if we\ncome to this square, they will take us away forever. What happened was that my father\narranged for my mother to go to the hospital and stay there, thinking that maybe the\nGermans will honor the doctors still there, like they did before. Some people had little\nhidings 1n their homes but we didn't have any, but my husband's parents had a little hiding\nspot in their little home, which was really a double wall where you could stand like lined up\nin a queue if 1t were necessary, but not for too long. Well, my present husband, who was at\nthat time just a friend, came over running to our little place and he said, \"Why don't they\ntake her,\" meaning me, \"to my hiding place? Because she doesn't really have such good\npapers and they probably will take her away. And we have this little hiding place, so me and\nmy family are going in there.\" And we didn't even have time to think, I didn't have time to\nsay goodbye to my parents. My father said, \"Go, Honey, it's the best thing for you to go.\"\nAnd I just went with him, and he said, \"I am going to try to take care of my brother and see\nwhat we can do.\" And there was a -- I never saw my parents again. And so we went in to the\nhiding with my present husband, and we stayed in this little wall hiding place probably\nbetween six in the morning up until maybe two in the afternoon. We tried not to cough, we\ntried not to move. And then at two o'clock somebody knocked and said, \"You might as well\ncome out, this is the end of the ghetto. You will not survive here, there is no food, there\ngoing to come and raze all those buildings. There are proclamations all over on the walls,\nthis is the end of this little ghetto and that all the Jews have to come to a certain barrack to\ngo to Majdanek Concentration Camp, because this 1s the liquidation of the ghetto.\" Well,\nmy first thought was to go back to my house and see if anybody is there but we weren't\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nallowed to move any more, we could only allowed to go to this barrack, that's all. There\nwere Germans 1n this ------- and they were showing you how to get to this barrack and there\nwas no other choice but to go there. My husband's parents said, \"You are so young\" -- he\nalso had a sister -- \"it's too bad, maybe you try to run away through the barbed wire and\nmaybe you can squeeze, at least the two of you to survive.\" So we tried, it was bright\ndaylight and we tried to -------- at one point, the barbed wires, and to run. Well, I have to tell\nyou that around the ghetto there was nothing, which 1s plain fields, for miles and miles to a\nhouse and it wasn't like you could run into a building or something, there was nothing there.\nWell, we ran for about a little mile to a ------ and there was shooting but they didn't hurt us,\nbut then finally one of those guards ran after us, beat my husband up -- he still has a\npermanent scar in his eye, no vision, and called us all kinds of names and told us \"back to\nthe ghetto you go.\" So that was not successful. When we came back to the ghetto I could not\nsee my mother any more because my mother was already taken. The hospital, the doctors,\nthe staff, and all the people that were in there, I mean the patients, they were all taken to the\nconcentration camp, so my mother was already in Majdanek, poor thing. I saw my father,\nwho was still around, and I saw my brother. And my husband's parents were still with us\nand we were thinking -- we had three days to go to this barrack to go to the concentration\ncamp. Well, we were making quick decisions, we didn't know what to do. We could not go\nback home for any money or clothes or anything. My husband's parents, unfortunately,\ndecided that they will go to this barrack, and so did his sister. She really did not want to live\nany more. We were so broken up, we had no will to survive. We went through three years of\ndehumanization, deprivation, hunger and everything, and you know what -------------------\nmaybe. Moreover, ---------going on like that. But my father said to us, I \"really want\nsomebody to provide for the family.\" I was thirteen and a half at this point. \"We're going to\ntry in the middle of the night when it's dark for young to get through the barbed wire. And\nmaybe you can survive.\" So we passively said OK and we tried a couple of nights and we\ncouldn't do it. But then on the third night my father got some gold coins and some watches\nand some -------- together and said, \"I will try to bribe some guard, maybe he will let you\ngo.\" And on the third morning, about four o'clock -- 1t was in November, it was very dark,\nthere was snow on the ground -- my father arranged for the guards to look away, gave them\nall this stuff and said, \"I want you to look the other way. I want my family to get out.\" And\nso, myself, my present husband, who was just a friend, and my little brother, who was nine\nyears old, were practically pushed by my father through the barbed wire to go and survive. I\nwanted my father to come with. He said, \"Oh no, I have to go to my ----- to the\nconcentration camp and I have to help your mother. I cannot go with you.\" He said, \"Go,\nand see what you can do for yourself.\" And so we did. We had to walk quite a long while\nbecause there was nobody around. And they were shooting. But then we saw a peasant,\nbecause the city was very far, maybe ten kilometers away. We saw a peasant and we asked\nhim if he would give us a ride. He might have known who we are but he pretended maybe\nthat he didn't. We thought he's either going to kill us all or he's going to take us to the city,\nbut he didn't. He took us into the city and 1n the city it was really bedlam because everybody\nknew that the --------------- and everybody knew the Jews were running away and everybody\nwas looking for Jews. And if you found a Jew and showed him to a German, you would get\nten pounds of sugar or five pounds of flour, something like that, they were posted all over\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlooking for the Jews that are running way from the ghetto. So it was impossible in a small\ntown to really hide overnight. But fortunately my husband knew somebody that worked for\nmy father and we walked in and said, \"May we just stay overnight some place\" and of\ncourse they were scared because you know they would find Jews by them, they would shoot\nthem too. So it wasn't only the point that they didn't want to help, because we knew some\nvery fine people that were patients of my mother, and my mother told me she gave them\nstuff to hide like candelabra and linens and fur coats; in case we ever needed them they\nwould be outside the ghetto. But when we came to these people they said, \"Yes, you need\nsomebody to help you out but we cannot let you overnight.\" The only person that let us\novernight was this worker that used to work for my husband's father, and they put us in the\nbasement full of coal and potatoes and everything that people put down there, and we stayed\novernight, the three of us. A very unusual trio. My husband was then 22, I was 16, and a\nnine-year-old boy. And we -------------. We stayed overnight and we knew we had to get out.\nSo we had no way to stay in the house, but in the morning I heard that the Germans came in\nand shot my father, because my father still was in the ghetto, he was one of the last left\nones. And as he tried to get out I understood that he was shot -------------ghetto. So I was\nable to find that out, and of course my husband's father, mother and sister all went to the\nghetto: the ghetto was no more. And we somehow scraped together enough to buy tickets on\nthe train to go to Warsaw because Warsaw was a big town where nobody knew us and we\nwere dreaming and hoping that maybe we could establish our existence as Aryans in the\nWarsaw outside of the ghetto. Well, that wasn't so simple because before we took the train I\nwent into a lady whom my mother gave things to to keep for us. This lady was supposed to\nbe a friend of my mother's and she also lived in the same building that we did. In the\nmeantime she told me to come back at a different hour and there were two Gestapo people\nwaiting for me, so she wasn't friendly to me. I almost lost my life at that point because they\nwere walking with me and trying to take me to the Gestapo, and then they were calling for\nsome other people -- it's impossible to describe the situation but I ran into a bombed-out\nbuilding where there was a little door and in this little door was a shoemaker living and the\nshoemaker knew my husband, and that lady decided to hide me in that little room of hers.\nShe really was the one that saved my life, because I knew that I cannot hide there, there was\nnothing there, just one little room and a curtain. She said, \"You stand behind the curtain.\"\nMy shoes were showing. I said, \"I can't jeopardize everybody else.\" And my brother and my\nhusband were was sitting there in that little room but they didn't know my family, they just\nknew me. And somehow she opened the door real wide and we played the housing scene.\nAs the Germans came up there to look for me, she didn't even let wait until they came in.\nShe came out, dusting off a little rug, and they said to her, \"Did you see a Jewish woman\nrunning around here?\" She said, \"No.\" She was an older, simple lady. She said, \"No, I didn't\nsee anybody here. This 1s all empty, there are no people walking through here.\" She said,\n\"Well, there was a Jewish lady that we just lost sight of and she's somewhere here. No,\nyou're welcome to come in, there is nobody here.\" The Gestapo people walked away. And\nas they walked to the end of the street, I ran to the other side of the street around the corner.\nSo that was one of my very close encounters. From there we took the train to Warsaw. It\nwas a long ride ---------. I think my father put a little money in my pocket and that was just\nabout all that we had but I had a very good pair of shoes, because every Jew believes that no\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmatter what happens with you, you have to have very good pair of leather shoes in case you\nhave to walk. I also had a coat with a little fur underneath so in case I get stuck some place I\nshould be warm; that's what I had. And of course my brother was with us, this little boy.\nAnd in the train they made ------- all the time that we were Jews, smugglers and Jews, and\nagain Jews. I don't know how we ever made it to Warsaw. We got into Warsaw at four\no'clock in the morning and they have these rickshaws that used to take to the city, like either\nhorse and buggy to take a rickshaw, and as we came into Warsaw they recognized us right\naway -- the Poles, not the Jews. See, the Germans per se would not recognize a Jew, they\ndid not know, they were not aware of the characteristics of the Jews -- whether you had a\nlong nose or whether your Polish is not proper or whether you speak with a Jewish accent;\nthey did not know this but the Poles were absolutely acute to this, they were really experts.\nSo they somehow saw -- they were waiting for people to get off the train, they knew that the\nJews are running -- and they saw my husband was given by one of his friends a fancy coat\nwith a fancy hat and that is no ----- with us, they really didn't ------ to kill us------------ and\nright away when we took the rickshaw and tried to go into town where I thought maybe I\ncould find -- I had an address -- some people who would help us out with false papers, or\nanything. They right away took us in their rickshaw and they were going and going and\ngoing. And I said, \"Well, we wanted to go to this-and-that street.\" He said, \"Oh no, that's not\nwhere you're going.\" I said, \"Where are we going?\" He said, \"You're going to the Gestapo.\"\nI said, \"Why is that?\" He said, \"Because you are Soviet Jews and we know you that you're\nhiding. And because you are Jews, you can't survive, we are taking you straight to the\nGestapo.\" And they were Poles, young Poles, who were riding this rickshaw and we said to\nthem, \"Stop! Why would you do that?\" He said, \"----------, you should get back to the\nGestapo.\" \"What do you care whether we live or not?\" \"No, you have to go.\" Well,\nwhatever we had on we gave it to them. We stopped in a little shack in a little corner of -----\n--- building and I told them, \"Whatever I have you can take. I still have a little money. You\ncan take my rings, you can take my watch, whatever I have, but please leave us here on the\nstreet, don't take us.\" So that's what happened. They stripped us of everything we had and\nleft us in the corner of that street by the door of some building. So here we are, about twelve\no'clock in the afternoon with nowhere to go, with nowhere to sleep, with no money. Soon\nenough we had no choice but to try to find a way to get into the ghetto. And we knew that\nthis is suicidal. We realized it but there was no other way for us -- we couldn't practically\nsleep on the street. Talking about homeless people today, you know, we were really\nhomeless. There was just nobody I knew, nobody that I could talk to, but we knew one\nthing: we knew how to get into the ghetto. It also wasn't easy. You just don't take a bus\nintended for the ghetto and say, \"I want to go in there.\" We decided, we knew, that the Jews\ncome out from the ghetto to work every day morning and they go back at night. We knew\nthat they go to work at the certain depot, coal depot, where they unload wagons of coal for\nthe Germans. And we knew that if we go there and when we talk to the supervisor, who was\nJewish, and if he has ------ people going back to the ghetto, he will probably do us a favor\nand take us on. So that's what we did. I think it was November 9th or 10th. We just went to\nthis place ----- bus, and we found this group of Jews working there. We talked to the fellow.\nWe said, \"Look: We are three people, we cannot stay on the Aryan side, we have nothing,\nwe want to go to the ghetto. And I had an uncle in the ghetto who was my father's brother\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand I was hoping that at least I could go get a meal there and somebody to talk to. Because\nwe were so tired from running and at this point we wanted to die as Jews. Which later\nreversed itself, you see. But we were so tired of running, we see the best that all the other\nJews in the ghetto, because we have no parents any more and nobody to take care of us,\nwe're just alone, and whatever happens, happens. So that night we got into the ghetto. I\nremember that my brother had a little coat and on the coat there was a fur collar. We had to\ntear off his collar and throw it out the window of the train because Jews were not allowed to\nhave any fur on them. And whatever else we had, like a little suitcase, that had to all be\ntaken away, thrown out, because we were going back to the ghetto as workers. And that's\nhow we got into the ghetto. And that ghetto was really not what I remembered from my\nhome, whether was barbed wire, it was summer, we had little flowers in the garden, and\nthere was my mother and father and somebody to protect me. That was a twelve-foot wall,\nwith people in there who were emaciated. It was almost the end thing of the Warsaw ghetto.\nIt was the \"small ghetto\" what they call where people were laying on the ground, dead,\ncovered up with newspapers; where there was absolutely no food. On the black market they\nwere Selling horsemeat. It was absolutely a tragic picture. And that's what we got into.\nUnfortunately, we didn't get much help from the family. My family was not responsive to\nmy needs. The only thing they did when we got there, they meant us to ----- marriage. They\nsaid, \"Are there two of you?\" I said, \"Yes, we are friends, we knew each other briefly. It just\nso happens that we care for each other but I just lost my parents, he just lost his parents, I'm\n16 years old, just to think of getting married is the last thing in my mind. We want to\nsurvive.\" \"Well,\" my uncle said, \"You know that's not right. If you are going to be together\nyou have to get married.\" I said, \"Well, if you want to do it, then arrange for it. Fine with\nus.\" Well, my uncle found a rabbi, the rabbi didn't want to marry me, I was too young, but\nfinally there was a rabbi who on a Saturday afternoon, December 13, married us in his little\nroom, wherever he lived there in the ghetto. They got me some dress -- from a neighbor, I\nguess, because I didn't have anything, -- and we were married. We were married, then we\nwere given a ------, you know, the Jewish certificate of marriage, which, incidentally later,\nwas flushed down the toilet because when we became \"Aryans,\" we couldn't have it, there\nwas no document of marriage. And as we got married, my uncle said -- first of all he told us\nwe can't stay with him; he still had a nice apartment and quite a bit of money and he said,\n\"No, you can't stay here.\" So we had to find ourselves a place. And fortunately I met some\npeople who were from my home town and knew my parents. As a matter of fact, one lady\ngave me her ring, her wedding band, to get married with, before the wedding, that we got\nmarried with. They told us that they lived --------------, which at that time was not the\nheadquarters of the uprising yet, and that they all have one apartment that that lady ---- 10 or\n12 families, but they will be willing to designate a quarter for us so that we can go to the\nopen-air market and get a sack with straw, fill it, put it there, and live there for a while. That\nwas end of December, beginning of January, in the Warsaw ghetto. We did that and\nunfortunately my uncle did not want to keep my brother either, so I had to bring my brother\ninto this settlement of people in there. And we just existed, stmply. My husband was going\nevery morning with a group of the people. He was unloading coal, and as a reward he could\ntake on his back a sack of coal as much as he could carry, four/for kilometers and on the\ntrain going back to the ghetto. And because we didn't want to use the coal to heat our\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\napartment because we couldn't afford it, we would go and knock on the doors of the people\nthat still had a little money, and they would buy this coal from us. And for that money we\nwould go to the black market and buy a little bit of flour, whatever we could. And that's\nhow we lived for three long months. We both were very ill, as you know, from disease and\nall kinds of indigestion and gastritis and typhoid fever; it was very prevalent, people lived\nunder very inhuman circumstances. There was no proper food. My brother was nine years\nold, it was very difficult for me because he was in the growing stage and he did not\nunderstand all the things that are happening to us -- that we have to hide and we have to be\nbeaten up. On January I believe 7th or 8th, the Germans surrounded the ghetto again and\nthey took ---------- I don't know. At that time there were still about 200,000 people in the\nghetto -- I might be wrong with my numbers -- and then they took another 25,000 at that\ntime and we had to hide 1n a room that we closed off. So it was just extremely difficult, it\nwas just like the ----.",
        "Q: Why was your uncle -------------?",
        "A: Because my uncle was not a nice person. Very simple.",
        "Q: Who lived with him?",
        "A: His wife and a child. My uncle was an extremely intelligent, egoistic, self-centered person,\nwho didn't get married until later in his life. He spoke English in Poland, in Warsaw. He\nworked for the Joint Distribution Committee, he had a high position, but during the War\nwhen Warsaw was already the ghetto and we in Lublin still had a lot of food from the\npeasants, my father would send -- we were allowed to send packages every week to\nWarsaw, a certain amount of food, and my father ------- supported him maybe a year. But --\nI don't want to talk bad about my relatives but he just didn't do anything for us. He figured\nhe wouldn't have enough money to survive for himself and he just practically threw us out\ninto the street. It was winter, it was a very heavy winter. We didn't have proper clothes, we\ndidn't have proper heat, we just sat in a corner with all these other people from our home\ntown. And one week when the Germans surrounded the ghetto and we locked off a room to\ntry to hide -- we were maybe 30 people in that one room and we were just eating raw\ncabbage and radishes, and whatever we could put into this room -- we had no bathroom, just\na little pail. It was practically inhuman but otherwise the Germans would have found us. So\nwe blocked off one room and put the furniture in front of it so the Germans would not know\nwhen they come into the house that we are there. That's how we survived the deportation on\nJanuary 7 in Warsaw, because we had no papers that we are working there. And then while\nwe existed in this ghetto we were hearing rumors -- it was already 1943 -- that something 1s\ncooking there, that there might be an uprising. The Jews are buying the munitions from the\nPoles said something might happen, that maybe really Germans are going to liquidate the\nwhole ghetto. And there were rumors that this ghetto is not going to exist any more because\nit was practically one of the last ghettos that the Germans kept. So what was happening is\nthat a lot of Jews who still had some means, they were building bunkers. Those bunkers\nwere not the bunkers that were built by the Underground but they were bunkers that they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbuilt to survive. They thought that maybe if they built these very excessive bunkers and put\nwater here and cooking facilities, that maybe they can survive in the bunkers if the ghetto\ngets destroyed for reason, either through the Jewish uprising or for any other reason. And\npeople who could contribute to go into those bunkers were partaking in this whole idea.\nNow, we didn't know anybody, we were absolutely orphans, we didn't know anybody there\nand we absolutely had no chance to ever think that we would be allowed to be taken into\nthose bunkers. I was very sick, and after living in the ghetto over three months all of a\nsudden I just felt an urge of getting out. It was just the opposite of what I thought three\nmonths ago -- three months before, I was outside of the ghetto and I couldn't find a place for\nmyself and I said, \"Let me die like all the other Jews. You get shot and it's all over with.\"\nWe still didn't know about concentration camps and gas chambers. But at that point -- it was\nspring, it was in February or March and I just felt an urge to be shut outside of the ghetto,\nnot in this ghetto. I just felt like I want some light and fresh air, and maybe I want to see\nnormal living people for a while, and then if I go, it's different. I just felt 1t. And maybe for\nthe sake of my brother. We just wanted to get out. First of all, you have to have the will, and\nthen you have the opportunity, you know -- one without the other just doesn't work. And\nmost of the Jews, and also us -- we had no will any more and that's why we came to this\npoint. But at this point we somehow got our strength together to get the will to maybe want\nto get out. But getting out of the ghetto -- I don't even have an example of the impossibility\nto this idea. There just isn't such a thing, you know. There's no such a thing that you can go\nto a 12-foot wall, who surrounded by Germans, there's no such a thing that you get out and\nnot be caught, because the whole area of the ghetto was always patrolled by Poles who only\nwaited for somebody to run away. So it was impossible. We had no connections but we had\nan idea and we started to think that maybe we should pursue this idea: It just so happened\nthat my husband was still working at the depot. One day while he was there he saw saw a\nfamiliar face, the face of a man who was wearing a railroad uniform, and he was convinced\nthat he knows this fellow and that he's a friend of his from Lublin and that he's a Jew.\nSlowly they started to look at each other and they recognized each other, and from a\ndistance they said, [speaking in whisper] \"Are you so-and-so\" and he said, \"Yes.\" And he\nsaid, \"I don't believe -- what are you doing here?\" My husband said, \"I'm in the ghetto, with\nmy wife and her brother. What are YOU doing here?\" He said, \"Well, I'm pretending I'm a\nPolish railroad worker and I have a lot of connections, I live outside of the ghetto, and I\nhave a lot of connections with Polish people who hide Jews for money. But big money. And\nmy whole family is being hidden in the ghetto inside of Warsaw.\" It just so happened that I\nknew the whole family and I also knew the friend of my husband, and he said, \"Do you have\nany money? I can arrange for you to find a place.\" This doesn't mean -- his whole family\nwas killed by the Poles. And that doesn't mean that he himself survived, because he didn't,\nbut he helped us. Because if you were hiding in 1943, that doesn't mean that you're going to\nmake it for a year and a half. So, my husband said to him, \"I have no money but we would\nlike to get out of the ghetto.\" He said, \"I know of a treasure that was buried in the ghetto by\nmy father. I don't know exactly what treasure it was, you know, what was 1n it, but 1t was\njust a lot of things buried there. My father was instrumental in putting a crate together and\nputting it into a place in the earth area. I would be willing to show somebody where this is,\neven go with them.\" It was so dangerous to go back to my home town. This fellow said, \"No\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nproblem, we have Polish uniforms, we have Polish papers. I'm going to talk to my Polish\nfriends and see if they would be willing to go and get this treasure out and get you out of the\nghetto.\" So that was just the beginning of the dream, because he came back in a few more\ndays and my husband saw him and he said, \"Well, they would be willing. There's a whole\ngroup of people that would be willing to take you back to Lublin and see if the treasure 1s\nreally there.\" But my husband said to him, \"You know, the way things look here, something\nis going to happen any day and I might just come back with all that money and treasure and\nmy wife and her brother might be killed by then. If I am taken out to go for this treasure, I\nwould like them to come with me at least out of the ghetto and wait some place outside of\nthe ghetto until this all materializes.\" And that's exactly what happened, that miracle\nhappened. That one day he came back to the depot and he said, \"Dead on that date, at six in\nthe morning, you come out with a group of workers and I will have two Polish people\nstanding outside and pretending, when you just walk through the gate and you walk and\nwalk and then you walk away from the group, I'm going to have these people pretend that\nthey grab you. They're going to grab you and they will take you on a streetcar to a place we\nare staying.\" And that's exactly what happened. The three of us went out in the morning, we\nwent through this gate and these two young people came up to us and grabbed us and took\nus to a place. And there was the miracle. I think we left the ghetto about two weeks before\nthe uprising. Because while I was on the Aryan side already, I saw the ghetto burning and I\nheard all the remarks that the Polish people said because of the ghetto burning. They were\nkind of happy, some were. Of course the people that helped us, I must say, we had a lot of\nhelp from certain Polish people and we were taken to a family of an engineer who was from\nthe Underground and who kept me and my brother until my husband and the whole group --\nthey arranged a whole group to go to Lublin. They were prepared for all the adversities and\nthey would arrange to take for this treasure, they gave him a uniform, a ----- uniform, and\nwhile they were gone I was waiting with my brother. There were some other Jewish people\nthat this engineer, this Polish Underground person, kept in his house temporarily until these\npeople were found quarters where they could hide. Well, they came back, and what\nhappened was: First they came back when the ground was frozen, so they couldn't dig. Then\nthey went back ten days later and they were digging under very unusual circumstances -- the\nshaft that it was buried in was going under the street, they had to pretend that they measure\nthe street and do all kinds of repairs and things. And to make the story short, they found the\ncase was empty. And that really saved our life, because otherwise these people would think\nthat we were lying, that it was simply a trick to get out of the ghetto, but this whole case\nwith all the things was buried was there. It was broken up and empty.",
        "Q: The uprising happened -- let's go back to the time of the uprising, which is also the time that\nyour husband was going back to Lublin, or he went back first and the ground was frozen.\nThen he came back, and then he went back again. Tell me how the uprising fit into all of\nthis and where he learned where he was.",
        "A: Well, actually I personally have no experience of the uprising because we were fortunate\nenough to leave the ghetto maybe two weeks prior to the uprising. What we knew was there\nwas great preparations. Everything was very secretive and we knew they were preparing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbunkers; we knew that they were buying a lot of ammunition outside, from the Poles,\nbecause that was the sources that the Jews were buying ammunition. We knew that things\nwere going to happen, we knew that there's preparations, but because we got out about ten\ndays before, I really have no knowledge of actually what happened, except from what I was\nreading I only can tell you that when we were outside of the ghetto and we stayed not far\naway -- of course the burning ghetto could be seen from miles and miles away and when the\nghetto started it was just one glob of fire, you could see that all this area was burning and a\nlot of streets outside of the ghetto were cordoned off. There was police, and there was\nGerman police and Polish police and you could not even streetcars and everything got stuck\nat a certain point because you could not get through because of the flame and because of the\nshooting and because of what was going on. So the life in Warsaw per se was completely\ndisrupted and I can be witness to this because I lived outside of the ghetto as an Aryan and I\nwas moving, I wasn't hiding. At any time I was out, moving, so I unfortunately heard\nremarks from people that was very favorable to what was happening there. And of course I\npretend no reaction but I was very hurt about that.",
        "Q: With what?",
        "A: Like things that the Jews are burning. \"Now we're going to get rid of all the bedbugs,\" you\nknow. Things that weren't very pleasant to me to hear. And yet there were Poles who helped\nme and kept me, right now, waiting for me to get my way through with arranging my life on\nthe outside of the ghetto. But what was happening in there, I absolutely -- I mean I have an\nidea but I was not witness to it. Because we stayed in the Warsaw ghetto from November 11\nthrough maybe end of March or beginning of April; that was the extent of our life. We\nwitnessed the last days of the ghetto per se but we were not part of it all. I can not give\ninformation on that from what I --",
        "Q: When the ghetto was burning and there was a lot of gunfire, were you afraid, living as a\ngentile or in hiding?",
        "A: Well, I was always afraid living as a gentile in hiding. Every day and every minute I was\nalways very vulnerable. My living as a gentile consisted of having a piece of paper which I\nsomehow secured or was secured for me and I had to pretend to be that person. But I have\nto digress back to the fact that when my husband came back and I was still with these\npeople that kept me for about two weeks, and when he came back and when it turned out\nthat there's no money in there, he was able to bring a little, a few things like, I think, two fur\ncoats that his parents left with some gentile people in Lublin, and we planned to sell maybe\ntwo suitcases with clothes, -- everything on the black market was of value, and we planned\nto sell this. And at that time, these people that we stayed with, who were part of the Polish\nunderground, told us that even so now there is no money to find us a secure place outside of\nthe ghetto, they would not advise us or they don't want us to go back to the ghetto at this\npoint. Because they know things are going to happen there very soon and if we go back\nthere it will be the end. So they would be willing to help us somehow establish ourselves on\nthe Aryan side: meaning that we have no money to go into somebody's home, pay for being\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nkept but that somehow I will have to find my way, maybe with their help, to establish my\nexistence on the Aryan side; meaning that they helped me obtain a false identity. There were\npriests in churches that were selling birth certificates of somebody more or less the same\nage as I was of people that died and maybe their death wasn't registered properly. I could\nobtain a birth certificate of that person and therefore I would assume the identity of that\nperson, and if I would have a real birth certificate from a church, I could go to a German\noffice which issues -- there was a camp called the -------, it was like a passport and\neverybody had to have that -- and I can obtain, if I have enough guts I can obtain which I\nwould need to show them that I'm an Aryan. Which really I did. This what happened: they\nwere helping me to try to maintain my identity as an Aryan, and I went to this office and I\ngot my paper. So I became this Lieutenant Viyeska (ph) who actually was three or four\nyears older than I was but I had to assume her birth date; I was her. I had to completely\nunlearn, psychologically, of what happened of who I was. I had to be learning prayers, I had\nto be going to church, I had to mingle with Polish people, but my problem was that I had my\nfamily with me and I have to find a way for them to survive too. What happened was that --",
        "Q: And you were successful because you didn't look Jewish.",
        "A: Because I didn't look Jewish, because I didn\u2019t speak -- at my home we spoke Polish. My\nPolish was very proper -- there's all kinds of Polish and they can detect and recognize you\nright away, the Poles -- my language was proper. I was a girl, they could not recognize me\nwhere my husband -- only Jewish males were circumcised in Europe, and immediately\nanybody, whether it was a little Pole that's 16 years old and wants your watch, or whether\nit's a German, if they take in the corner, you're being recognized immediately. And that's\nwhy men were so handicapped in hiding; it was much easier for women. Now, my brother\nwas also circumcised. Although he was very blond, with blue eyes, and he absolutely had no\nSemitic features but he was circumcised, and he could not play outside with little children\nbecause he had a very sad look on his face. He knew that he doesn't have a mother and\nfather and it was very difficult for him. Therefore, he had to be hiding, together with my\nhusband, in order to play safe with them. So I had to be able to secure a place for me to live\nand a way to bring groceries for more people than just myself without being detected. And\nbetween 1943 April until October '44 there was a lot of different circumstances and a lot of\nthings were going on on the Aryan side. By then of course they cleaned up the ghetto and\nthe ghetto was over with but it took a long time but the ghetto was burning, Warsaw was\ncompletely surrounded -- you know, it was cut off from the ghetto side. But I had a\nmultitude of problems, because first of all I had to find a place to live. I wasn't even thinking\nof going to work at that time, because work was scarce, and I was really scared, I mean, I\nstill was myself, with my past, and with all my sensitivities and everything that I -- you can't\njust switch yourself off, I wasn't a -----, I was a vulnerable young girl who all of a sudden\nhad all these problems to take care of and all these burdens. Well, at the beginning this\nengineer who was very, very nice helped me secure a tiny little apartment and there was\nanother lady who also wanted to live with me and we both rented a tiny apartment. In this\napartment we built a hiding place for her husband, my husband and my brother. There was a\nbig building. The neighbors were never supposed to know that there's more than two people\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nliving there, me and her, and we were supposed to go to work in the morning and come\nback at night. So these people had to be so quiet -- not flushing the toilet, not walking,\nbecause we were on the third floor and there was, you know, people living on the bottom\nand on top of us. And it was very, very difficult, it was touch and go all the time, and every\nday you hear that they found some Jews here and they found some Jews there, and there\nwere Jews in the neighborhood that didn't be discovered. There was very difficult. We\nmanaged for a little while. I had to go shopping to different stores so that I wouldn't bring\ntoo much food, you know. But that only was for a little while. After about six or seven\nmonths, the janitor -- they were always attuned to what was going on -- kind of went after\nme one day when I was shopping and he kind of understood that I'm buying more food than\nI should, and he denounced me. But we had certain things figured out at that time and my\nhusband built with his bare fingers a hiding place which was a bombed-out part of the\nbuilding where the bathroom was on the part of the ruins. So what they did is they put some\nboards there so from the outside it looked like ruins but from the inside it connected to our\nlittle apartment. And there was the side of the bathroom where they could sit there all day\nlong. And the entrance to the hiding place was very cleverly disguised: it was an entrance\nfrom the -- actually where the toilet is there was a wall and the wall had wooden blocks.\nNow, one of those big wooden panels would slide up and there would be the entrance. So at\nnight they would come out and sleep with us, but during the way they would go in there and\nfrom the bathroom you couldn't see anything because these panels were all the same all\naround. Anyway, they also figured out that in case I go some place and I get it trouble and\nthey make me come back to my apartment, they would have a way -- I would have a certain\nknock or talk very loud and they would have a way to break through the outside wall of that\nbathroom which went out on the ruins and they would all run and they would tell me where\nthey go -- we had a place where I could find them. And the inevitable happened. One\nmorning I went to the store and the janitor came up to me with two policemen, Polish\npolicemen, and they said, \"Well, we heard that you are hiding Jews\" -- the other lady was\nnot home then -- \"we know that there are Jews here and we know that you are hiding Jews\nand this is not right, we have to go in and take a look of what is going on there.\" I told them\nthat there is nobody there and I told them that I lost my key, I couldn't find it -- because I\ndidn't want to open up with the key, I really want to give them the signal, this knock where\nthey would know to run. I told them that I don't have the key. They were going to bring a\nlocksmith to break 1n the door and they did break in the door. By the time they broke in the\ndoor there was nobody there, they were gone; I mean they didn't even find the hiding place.\nThey just looked around the apartment and there was just nobody there. And we always\nkept it nice and tidy, just like two beds, just the two of us. But they were just very upset\nbecause they didn't find anything and they told me that they're going to come back at four\no'clock because they have to investigate and blah blah blah whatever they wanted to do.\nWell, they took my papers and that was the problem, because right away they ask you who\nyou are, and when you give them the papers then if they don't give them back to you, then\nyou're dead, you have no papers, that's terrible. Well, 1n the meantime I went to the place\nwhere they were and I told them what happened, and I said, \"Look\" -- it was only a\ntemporary place for the day or two -- and I said, \"Look, I don't know what to do now --\nshould I go back and face the music and get the papers back?\" And I felt strong enough that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nI really want to go and face up to them, because I really wanted my papers back. And what\nhappened was that I went back to the house -- of course I had everything in there -- and they\nnever came back. So they never came back and I never got my papers back. But the place\nwas no good any more, we could not return to the place. So we had to move out of there.\nAnd at this point, this other friend of mine, she had to go her own way and I had to go my\nown way.",
        "Q: Now, I just want to go back and ask you one question. When you didn't have the money to\npay the Polish underground for getting you out of the ghetto or the Polish people, your\nfriends, how come they still helped you?",
        "A: Because in my path of life I found some very nice Polish people who maybe did not adore\nJews but who from humane reasons felt compelled to help, who really could not live seeing\nall these atrocities that are being done and who felt that they maybe have to do a little bit to\nhelp the Jews. And I met actually three people like that in my path and they were very\nimportant people to me. This one fellow who kept us at the beginning and who said to us,\n\"Don't go back to the ghetto, I have no gain for you going back to the ghetto. I know you\ndidn't lie, and if you can support yourself and establish yourself on the Aryan side, then if I\ncan help you I will help you.\" He did help me secure this first apartment, you see, he did\nhelp me in giving me a little encouragement and showing me maybe how I can do it. So\nthere was the first thing. Then later on, when they took my papers and when I was\ncompletely lost and I was at a point where I just didn't know what to do with myself and the\nwar still was nowhere towards the end, I went to visit a friend of mine who was also hiding\nand there is a story to it, if I have a little time I will tell. While I had this apartment, the\ngentleman who helped me, he was helping other Jews getting established on the Aryan side,\nand if he had to bring three or four Jews, he couldn't keep them in his home, he would bring\nthem to my little apartment. Because I opened that -- I couldn't say, \"Listen, I can't take\nthem in.\" So I was helping him at that time, and at some point I could have had seven or\neight people in there. And that's where this janitor really got the idea that something's going\non. But once this was over with, they all had to go their own way. While I had this little\napartment I met a girl from down the street who was from my home town. She said, \"I need\na big favor of you: I need a place for my husband to sleep for two nights, he's going to the\nunderground and we don't have a place right now, so can he sleep by you for two nights?\" I\nsaid, \"Look, what's the difference if we sleep together on the floor? Let him come.\" He\ncame to my apartment and he left a winter coat, he forgot his winter coat. A few days letter I\nget a little letter from her telling me that he needs the coat and if I don't mind to bring the\ncoat to the place where she 1s at this moment. Well, on one Sunday I decided that I'm going\nto take the coat to her. That was a heavy winter coat on my arm and a purse and I got into\nthe streetcar. And they stole my purse. So that was on top of not having my papers, they\nstole my purse with my money and by the time I got to her house with the coat I was 1n very\ndesperate mood, I was ready to commit suicide. I said, \"Now I have nothing. I have a\nhusband that's sitting and waiting for me, I have a brother that is sitting and waiting for me\nthat I have to support, and now I don't even have a paper any more and I don't have any\nmoney and I don't know what I'm going to do with myself.\" And I came in there crying\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nterribly. And there was a man sitting there and he looked at me -- he was the one who would\nbe instrumental to take this man to a gentleman who would take my friend's husband to the\nunderground -- and he looks at me. He says, \"My God, what's the matter with you? You're\nso young, you can't be so desperate.\" I said, \"Look, right now I have no means of survival\nand I'm at the wall which I can't cross.\" And he said to me, \"You know you look very well,\nyou look like an Aryan, why don't you want to work a little?\" I said, \"Work? What can I\ndo?\" He said, \"I can get a job for you and I can help you out, so don't worry. If you need\nsome money, I'm going to hand you some money and if you want me to go with you to the\noffice where they give the documents\" -- because I lost my purse, my purse was stolen -- he\nsaid, \"I'm going to take you on Monday and I'm going to say that you are my cousin, and I'm\ngoing to tell them that they stole your purse on the so-and-so streetcar and they have to give\nyou a duplicate. As simple as that. And then you come to me and I will tell you what you're\ngoing to be doing for me.\" So that was my guardian angel. He actually met me that day, my\ngirl friend ------ took the coat and went to the underground. He met me and he took me to\nthe police station and he told them this story and I got a copy of my original passport. And\nthe next day he gave me an address, he told me where I should go and he told me that he is\nhiding about 20 Jews in his apartment and that these Jews have no means of supporting\nthemselves. He was a single man. I would say he was 1n the 40s. He was a past pilot in the\nPolish air force, he has been wounded many times, was not 1n the best of health. A great\nhumanitarian, who kept on saying, \"I don't like Jews but I have to help you.\" And these\npeople that were living in his apartment -- I don't know how they got to him but they needed\nsome means of survival and they knew how to manufacture -- I mean this 1s bizarre -- how\nto make certain things that could be sold on the black market and they couldn't get out to\nsell it. They were looking for somebody who could go out and sell this for them so that they\ncan survive. And that person was, he found me in this apartment. And I said, \"Well, I have\nto talk to my husband, I don't think that he would want me to walk around places like open-\nair markets and flea markets and sell stuff. He would probably be worried, you know, that\nthey recognize me.\" He said, \"You go and talk to him.\" Well, when I talked to my husband\nhe wasn't very much for it, but we really had no choice, we were three people that had to\nsurvive. I went to him every morning and he gave me a little suitcase. What these people\nwere manufacturing was hairnets. There was a great fashion at that time of heavy nets -- I\nthink in the 40s they had them here too -- they were all different colors and you were\nwearing them like down from your head to cover your hair and they were like brown and\ngray and all kinds of colors; heavy, knit, made by hand. And these Jews had a factory some\nplace before the War and they knew how to do it manually. And then they were also making\nelastics, they knew how to make elastics. They would cut the thread from the inner tubes by\nhand and then they would take some silk, dye the silk different colors and they would make\nround little elastic. When you buy a piece of round elastic that's what they were doing by\nhand, putting it on little cardboards and putting a label around it; and of course there was\nnothing like that because all the factories were closed. And they wanted to sell it and they\ncould manufacture a lot of it. So I got a little suitcase and they told me where to do. The\nplace I went was a flea market, the biggest one in Warsaw, where the worst element of\npeople were selling, I mean the lowest from the lowest, people that would not hesitate to\nchop you up in pieces if they would know who I was. But somehow, I don't know, I had the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncourage because I had to do it. I wasn't a hero, by no means, I did it for my own survival and\nI did it because I had no choice. And [laughing] I developed a very nice business. I was\nliked by the people, I got my own clients and own customers, and they were giving me\norders, they were selling, they were giving me orders for more. I would put my orders with\nthem and they would fill my orders and that was going on like that. And then one day this\nengineer said to me, \"You know, why don't we teach your husband,\" who was sitting and\ndoing nothing, \"why don't I take him over there and we'll train him and we'll teach him how\nto do it so he can do it too, rather than sitting at home.\" And what happened was that he\nactually learned how to do it, and I was selling our own merchandise and the merchandise\nof the other people, and that's how we all had a chance to survive. I have to mention that by\nthen I had another apartment. This apartment was not my own but through somebody I\nfound a lady who was willing to share her very small apartment with me but I had to pay her\nmore than more than usual -- this lady needed money, she was a widow, and she tried to\nsurvive; she was peddling a little bit merchandise here and there. And then she said that we\ncould have a bed in one of her rooms and that we could -- I would pay her, for instance, if\nnormally she would take 50 or 100 dollars from another Polish person, she took 800 from\nme. She really did it for the money but she was a person that had a lot of heart and\nunderstanding for me but she really needed the money, it meant surviving for her too. She\nhad to pay for the apartment and she had expenses. So at that point we lived with her. Of\ncourse my husband was still in hiding and nobody knew that he was there and he also made\na little hiding in the an ------- which I'm going to let him tell you about it. And we lived with\nthat lady.",
        "Q: And you were able to make enough money to --",
        "A: I was able to make enough money to pay her. I was able to make enough money for us to eat\nwell and I was also able to make enough money to save. Because when the Polish uprising\nin 1944 happened, of which part my mentor was very much involved with and he was one\nof the officers in the uprising, I did a saving that I tried to locate somehow. Now, what I\ndidn't mention that I lost my brother in 1942. It's a very painful thing to talk about. In July --\nwas it 1943? yes, in July he was sitting in that hiding with my husband, this other man, and\nhe really had a very, very poor life because he couldn't play -- you know, it's hard to confine\na nine-year-old to a poor little hiding place, also he was wonderful, he was so good. But I\nknew that this situation can't go on like this, he wasn't eating properly. At that time I didn't\nwork yet, which was in the old apartment, and one day I found out that there is such a thing\nas a hotel. I don't know how much information there is in the Holocaust Museum about this\nparticular thing that I'm going to talk about but I would like to know because I can tell about\nit. It was a scheme from the Germans, it was called Hotel Polski that was was an old fancy\nhotel in Warsaw, and what the Germans did, they spread rumors that they're going to send\npeople to Switzerland and that these Jews were going to be exchanged for German prisoners\nof war with Russia, and they were looking for Jews to come to this hotel and they will\ntransport these Jews to Switzerland. Actually they took one transport and sent them there.\nAnd now the people thought that this is a legitimate thing and everybody that was in hiding\n-- because you see the Jews that were hiding in Warsaw and paying all this money for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhiding eventually the money goes out, eventually these people get more tired and tired of\nkeeping the Jews, eventually there is more people that 1s being discovered. It's a very\nvulnerable situation. These Jews had no assurance that they're going to survive and the\nmatter of fact everybody that we know and the family ------------, everybody is there. Sooner\nor later somehow from many apartments and from many hiding places these people were\nfound and kept. So, when the rumor was spread that there is such a thing as this hotel,\npeople jumped at it and it was very hard to get in. Matter of fact, the Germans even had a\nway to take money from these Jews, so that it was really kept up beautiful and the people\nthat was supposed to leave in two weeks were living there already. I met the girl who was\nfrom my home town, whom I knew very well and she used to be a neighbor of ours and I\nwent to school with her younger brother. Because when she saw me, she said, \"Oh my God,\nwhat are you doing here?\" And she was dressed beautiful, she was a beautiful woman. I\nsaid, \"Well, we're in hiding and I can't get into the transports and I don't know what to do.\"\nShe said, \"Oh my God, I'll be happy to help you.\" It turned out that she was the mistress of\nthe man who was arranging all these transports and she told me, \"You know, I can help you.\nIf you want to send your brother with me, I promise you that I'm going to take care of him. I\nremember my little brother and I remember he was in school with you and if you want to\nsend him with me, I'll take care of him\" She said, \"Were going to Switzerland, I'm going out\ntomorrow to buy a wardrobe -- I need some very fancy clothes, and I know all these people\nhere and I know there's a group of students going. And if you want me to, I'll take care of\nhim.\" She was crying, she says, \"I lost my family, I lost my brother, and I promise you that\nI'm going to take care of him.\" She did not know the truth of what's going to happen. Now,\nthat was something I couldn't refuse, I came home and we talked about. And I said to my\nhusband, \"Look, we can't go, here there's still a long time to the end of the war, who knows\nwhat's going to happen? People are paying thousands of dollars in foreign currency to get in.\nI met people, I talked to people that were actually getting out of hiding, paying in money to\ngo; and they believed in it.\" Who was I to think that it's not so? I was only sorry that we\ncouldn't go. And we talked it over, I went and I bought a suitcase and I bought some clothes\nfor him. We were supposed to meet on a certain day and I was supposed to take him there.\nAnd the morning when the transport was leaving -- incidentally, one of my relatives, my\naunt, and her little girl also was there, and also ------ with this transport because she knew\nsomebody who was arranging for it. And that's what it happened, it was in July '43 that I lost\nhim. I took him there in the morning, and I saw her leave with him in a taxi, I said goodbye\nto him, I said goodbye to her, she promised me she's going to take care of him, she was\nsincere about it. I saw all the people go in trucks to the ------- wherever they were going to\nthe train station, we said goodbye, he told me he's going to write to me, and that was the end\nI knew. Later, through the Polish underground paper it was mentioned that they took all the\npeople from this transport and they took them to a concentration camp in Hanover, where\nthey didn't survive. And also, the rest of the people that lived there and waited for the next\ntransport were also taken away. So, my brother would have been now 60 years old. So that's\nhow I lost him, and there were just the two of us from then. So at the time where I found\nthis man who gave me a job, and when I was working and having the money and being able\nto support myself, there was just the two of us. So that what was going on more or less. I\nwas working, and my husband was making whatever he could, and I was selling, and we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwere living quietly because nobody knew about his existence. And I lived with that lady.\nWe had a few close encounters, for instance, her drunken cousin wanted to come and sleep\nover one night and my husband had to go in hiding and the hiding was an oven, he passed\nout in there, it was just terrible; I think that maybe he will throw more details on this\nparticular situation. And that's how we lived, quietly, incognito, till about shortly 1944. I\nhave to tell you that this engineer, whose name is Selek -----sky (ph), he has been honored\nwith a gold medal from the Israeli Government and his is the first place in the Valley of the\nRighteous that these people established, because most of those people survived the Warsaw\nuprising, not the ghetto uprising, the other uprising, he got them all out ------. And there\nwere rumors that he was killed I read, but then he did survive. He really was honored by the\nJews who are living now in Israel and by the State of Israel. He also had a few close\nencounters. For instance, there was a woman that was in his apartment that was ready to\ndeliver a baby and he did not know about it, she was apparently camouflaging it. And in the\nlast minute when she ----- the baby, he had to call a doctor whom he had to pay dearly and\nthey didn't have the money, so he ran over to our apartment in the morning screaming, \"I\nneed 3000 zlotys immediately, this woman is having a baby in my place.\" So we gave it to\nhim and she did have the baby, and apparently they put it right up to the orphanage; but I\nunderstand that she survived and they got the baby back. So I was not in fact with these\npeople after the war but I know that most of them survived and live in Israel. It wasn't until\n1944 when he came over one day to us -- he was coming quite often to us because he was\nlonely; and he was telling us that there's going to be an uprising, a Polish uprising, in\nOctober 1944, that the Polish people are beginning an uprising because the Russians are\ncoming closer, and the Russian front is now on the Vistula River which was dividing\nWarsaw into two parts: there was Warsaw on one side of the Vistula and on the other side\nof the Vistula, and what was happening that the Russian army was advancing up to the\nVistula and there were rumors that they're going to stop. In the meantime the Polish\nGovernment in exile in London decided that there's going to be a Polish uprising, that the\nPolish people will try to save Warsaw from being occupied by the Russians and they're\ngoing to liberate Warsaw themselves. So these were these people, who were organized who\nhad munitions, but they were against a German army with planes with all kinds of bombs,\nand they tried to stake an uprising. And he told us about it. He said, \"I want to warn you that\nthere's going to be an uprising and things are going to be tough. I want you to prepare food,\nand if you have any money, money's going to be no good. So I want you to go and do\nsomething with it.\" I said, \"What would I do with the money I have?\" He said, \"Why don't\nyou go to a store and buy some rings.\" So here I went to a store and ended up with eleven\nwedding bands and that was my treasure. So of course the uprising was terrible. We were\nboth severely wounded. The second week of the uprising took about four weeks. 350,000\npeople in Warsaw were killed. Three-quarters of Warsaw was destroyed; that's why Warsaw\nis all rebuilt now because three-quarters of it was destroyed by the Germans because of the\nuprising. They were coming in systematically and bombing all the streets because they\nknew there's this new cry of underground here; and the Polish underground killed a number\nof Germans, but still 1t was no comparison of what the Germans had done and the Germans\ncould do. So it was terrible, it was a very, very terrible time. At night my husband used to go\nto work and help them save some grain from burning mills because the population was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nstarving and the Germans were having a feast, you know. Some of them were being killed\nbut still they had a hold on the situation. We had to go from one place to another, because\nthe place where I lived with this lady they were bombing every day and at one point we\nwent to the cellar, to the basement, and we saw some other Jews creep out from another\napartment there. But at that point we were all in the same boat, the Poles and the Jews, so at\nthat point nobody really had time to care who was sitting in the bunkers, who was sitting in\nthe cellar. And that was going on for two or three weeks until one day our building was\ndestroyed and that's where I was buried in debris completely. My husband just pulled me\nout by a leg and I sustained permanent injury to my ear, and my husband was also injured at\nthe same time and we had to move to another place still Warsaw, and we waited until in\nOctober 1944 the uprising was completely over, it was suppressed, and the Germans\ndecided to evacuate the whole town because the frontier was on the Vistula River. The\nRussians waited patiently while the Poles and the Germans were killing each other -- they\nwere in no hurry at that point, they knew they've got the situation covered and they can\ncome in any time. So they suspended, you know, the quest for maybe three or four months.\nThey sat on the other part of the River, and mind you, the Jews that were fighting in that\npart of Warsaw were already liberated and some people were trying on the Vistula, under\nthe bridges, to swim through in order to be liberated; and here we knew that within seven or\neight kilometres from where we were these people were already free and we still had the\nGermans, and God knows what's going to happen to us. So it was really a terrible situation\nbecause at that time half of Poland was already taken by the Russians. The provisional\ngovernment of Poland was established in 1944 in our home town, in Lublin, and we were\nstill heavy under the Germans, dying every day. When the Germans decided to evacuate all\nWarsaw, we had no choice but to leave, and at that point we didn't know where they're\ngoing to take us and what's going to happen to us. We knew that the war is going to end\nsoon because ---------- artillery and we knew it's a matter of months but we were still under\nthe Germans and we had no choice but to go with them whatever they're going to take us.\nSo that's what happened: we were evacuated from Warsaw, everybody had to leave, all the\nPoles, the city was empty. But there was an aura of thinking that whoever is from Warsaw 1s\nsomehow connected to the uprising, you see. The Poles all over the Polish territory thought\nthat we were all from the uprising, that we were all from the underground, and especially\nbeing wounded and being hurt, they didn't really think there would be some Jews among us,\nyou know. So at that point we somehow managed, and my husband too, to get through with\nthem. Also, at that time we were all taken to a camp which was not a concentration camp, it\nwas called Krushkupf (ph), it was near Warsaw, and that was a gigantic camp and that's\nwhere all the population of Warsaw was taken. And from there they were doing selections:\nthe young people that were healthy were taken to Germany to work for factories, the old\npeople we didn't know what they're going to do with them but this was the petrifying\nmoment of my life, because we were never separate, we always managed to be together; you\nknow, like families, and husband and wife, were separated. Up on this point we always\nmanaged to be together. Now, at this point we were kind Hof scared because I was afraid\nthat if they take him to work to Germany, we will have to go to a doctor to see if he's\nhealthy and then they're going to find out who he was. So we were really in a limbo. And\nthen we were walking into the camps not knowing really what's going to happen. While we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwere walking in the camp, there were nuns there -- I don't know what they were doing, I\ndon't know if they were helping to evacuate the Poles, and one of the nuns walked up to us\nand said, \"Why don't you go the right? It's ----- the wife to go to the right. Go to the right,\ndon't ask any questions, go to the barrack named C.\" And you know, we didn't know if we\nshould or not, but we did. Once we got to this barrack, it turned out this was barrack of sick\npeople and when we walked in there they told us, \"Oh you're not sick enough. We've got\nsome paint, we're going to make you bleed all over, we're going to put bandages on your\nhead, we're going to put bandages on your knee, we're going to make you look real sick.\" So\nhere we're sitting in this barrack, which was just terrible with a latrine for a bathroom and\nwith gigantic-size lice on the mats. And this was just only a transit camp and we're asking\nthe people, \"What's going on here?\" There were maybe 400 or 500 people there. Said, \"We\ndon't know, this is supposed to be sick barracks, either they're going to send us some place\nto get better or they're going to take us some place and kill us because they don't need us.\"\nSo that's where we saw. We sat there overnight, and then in the morning they took us on\ntrains, the whole barracks, and they took us towards western Poland. There was no patrol on\nthe trains, there was no guards on the trains, and we really didn't know, we were very\ndisoriented, it was like cattle train, we were 40, 50 people in a train. But every time they\nstop, you could really go down; but where we going to go? We were afraid we're going to a\nlittle village or a little town and soon enough they're going to find who we were. So we\ndidn't care any more. Some people were getting off the train -- they were all Poles, mind you\n-- some people were staying in the train. Somehow we decided to go to the end and see\nwhat's going to happen to us. We didn't know. And in about, I don't know, a day and a half\nor so, we arrived at the little town near Krakow and we found out that what they're going to\ndo with all of us is to put us with peasants -- each peasant of t his area will have to take a\nWarsaw family and keep them there in the fields. So we ended up in a very small little\ntown, with some quite poor peasants who took us in thinking that we are Warsaw\nunderground fighters, and because we really were wounded -- and my husband developed\nhepatitis here -- they really thought that we are legit and it didn't come to their minds to\nthink that we are Jews. So this is October 1944. We stayed with these peasants. Some of\nthem were kind, some of them weren't, but if they weren't kind it wasn't because they were\nJews, they got once kind because they had to share with other people whatever they had but\nsome of them were very kind. It was bitter cold winter, they made me a little fur coat from\nrabbits hair. They were very poor peasant and we had to work for them and do everything in\nthe kitchen and with the animals and with the pigs and whatever had to be done, you know,\nwith the well, with the water; very primitive. They put up four chairs and a sack for us to\nsleep at night. In the daytime we needed the room because everything was in one room and\na lot of children there. But somehow we managed to get their confidence. I had to go to\nchurch every Sunday, and at Christmas it was very difficult because the Polish people had a\nceremonial Christmas Eve and we were invited to this [she laughs] to a very important\nperson there, you know, for Christmas dinner and I had to pretend that I am really very sick\nand cannot make it at the last minute. So 1t was touch and go, and because there was no\nschool for the children, my husband established a school, for which the peasants were very\ngrateful. And somehow they kept us there and we stayed. It doesn't mean that there wasn't\nrumors every day when they found a family some place in the woods, hiding, and that they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nchopped them up to death. This was just like daily news. But somehow we survived this\nordeal too. In the beginning of January, when the frontier was coming closer, we were\nliberated by the Russians, and that was the greatest that could ever happen to us -- to see the\nfirst Russian soldier come into the village was just like seeing Messiah. We still had to\npretend that we're not so happy, because the Polish people did not like the idea that the\nRussians are coming, and the anti-Communists especially, they did not want Russia to take\nover Poland and we had to kind of be very diplomatic about it and, you know, really keep it\ncool and now to show it how happy we are that the Russians came in. And as the Russians\nwere coming in, we saw Germans beheaded, we saw a truck full of Germans with no heads,\nI mean they were really getting it from the Katyusha and from the artillery of the Russians\ncoming in. And we slowly had to convince the Russians that we are Jews, they didn't\nbelieve us; because we needed certain permits to go back home, things were very difficult at\nthat time you know -- people could not just move around, the Russians were still advancing,\nit was still January 1945, the war wasn't over till actually May. But we wanted to go home,\nwe didn't want to stay there. My husband had a very close encounter with a Russian who\ntold him, \"I don't think you're a Jew, I think you're a spy, there's no more Jews here, we\nknow that Hitler killed them all.\" And my husband says to him, \"Listen, is there any\nRussian soldier here that maybe knows Yiddish? I know a little Yiddish.\" So they found a\nlittle guy and this guy came over and says, in Russian -- my husband speaks some Russian -\n- \"You think you're a Jew?\" So: tell me a Jewish prayer.\" And he said, \"Geshmah\" (ph).\nAnd you know what? They started to kiss and embrace. And that's how slowly we told the\npeasants that we have to go back home -- to Warsaw, we didn't tell them anything else, we\nwant to see what's going on there. And we said goodbye to them. And mostly on foot we\nstarted our migration back home to our home town. Of course we didn't find anybody there.\nLater on we went back to this town and we took some clothes and things for the children,\nyou know. ---------------[proper mames] never found out who we were. Now, my husband\ndeveloped hepatitis and we didn't want him to go to the doctor --",
        "Q: We're really just about to run out --",
        "A: OK.",
        "Q: -- and I think we should put up another roll, maybe a shorter roll. Do you think you can\nEnd of Tape #2\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nTape #3",
        "A: Okay, I would like to just mention briefly an incident that while we lived with these\npeasants, my husband became gravely ill and he developed hepatitis. He was really in very\nbad shape and almost dying, and he refused to go to a doctor, because he was afraid that\nbeing examined, the doctor is going to find out who he was. But he was already so ill that\nthe peasants would absolutely don't take no for an answer, and we had to go 13 kilometers\nin the winter in the snow to get to this place where there was a doctor, where they were very\nhelpful, because they wanted my husband to live. They dressed him up very warm and they\ntook a couple of horses and a buggy, and then we went to this doctor. As we walked into the\ndoctor's office, my husband noticed that he had a little plague there which said that he was a\nrailroad doctor in Warsaw. My husband walked into him and he says, \"Oh, you're doctor so-\nand-so. I remember you from Warsaw. I used to be on the railroad too.\" They shook hands\nand they became friends right away, and actually when he needed a shot, he had the nurse\njust do it for him, and he did not really examine him. So there was a little close encounter\nwhich I wanted to mention. Well, to make my story a little more concise, we went back to\nour hometown. There was some Jews coming back from Russia and some Jews coming\nback from Polish, from camps and Germany, but unfortunately we found out that there was\nnobody. My husband found some uncles there, and he will tell about that. We did not want\nto stay in Poland too long. I felt that every stone had blood on it, and every wall had\nmemories for me. I never went back to the place where my parents lived. I went back to the\nlady who send the Gestapo for me, and I really wanted, went to the police to talk to them\nabout it, and to see if she can be reprimanded. But they told me there was no witnesses, so\nwe just let it go. Only God was my witness at that time, but it ended up well for me, so I'm\nalive. We went to live in a different town, because my husband wanted to go back to the\nuniversity. He had too his medical school behind him. So we found out that in Breslau,\nwhich became a Polish town, Broslof (ph), there is a medical school and that his professors\nfrom the previous school will be there. He had no documents and no papers. He was\naccepted to medical school for the third year and we spend a year there. That we also\nbelonged to Acubootz (ph) there, that was Acubootz (ph) of students. And after he\ncompleted the third year and he could secure papers, we decided to go into the world. We\nabsolutely didn't want to live in Poland. The memories were just too terrible, and there was\nan opportunity to leave into the unknown. We just took a knapsack and went to the border\nto Czechoslovakia and then into Austria. We were aided by the Breha (ph), by the Israeli\nofficials who were helping Jews get out of Poland at that time, and we just went into the\nworld. We were fortunate to come to Vienna, and in Vienna my husband was able to\ncontinue medical school at that time, and we became a part of a group of 400 Jewish\nstudents who came from all over to Vienna, and who were able to study in Vienna. The\nreason that the university was lenient to those people is because Vienna was occupied by all\nfour, and the Americans made sure that Jewish students were not only accepted at the\nuniversity, but they also paid very, very low tuition. Well, anti-Semitism was great, and the\nGerman professors were not that happy to promote Jewish students, but people still studied\nthere and my husband was able to get his medical diploma there in Vienna. We stayed there\nfor four years. I was working a little bit, and I decided to also to go to the university. After I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas at the university for two years, he was ready with his medical school, and we couldn't\nwait to get out, because we secured some papers to the United States from a distant family\nthat I found and who were very gracious to send us papers, but they told us not to come\nbefore my husband is ready with his studies. So four years later, on October 1950, we were\nbrought into the United States, and from then on we felt free, we felt happy. We were young\nenough to want to start a new life. We were young enough to try to cut off the past as much\nas we could. We decided that this is our country, we are going to live here, there's not going\nback, there's no complaining we have to become American citizens. We have to take the\nopportunity that this country has given us. My husband has a good profession. I felt that I\ndidn't finish my studies, so when the children grew up a little bit, I went back to get my\ndegree. We were fortunate to have things fall into place for us. We lived in Rochester, New\nYork, where my husband was interning, then we lived in Buffalo, New York for a short\nwhile, and then we came into Chicago where we build our life practically from scratch. But\nwe were fortunate that we were able to do so. We have a great family. Our nuclear family\nwas two, then it became four, and now we are 11. So we did a good job, a very close-knit\nfamily, our family is now substituting for the family we lost. We are very fortunate to have\ngreat children. They are married, three granddaughters. And I feel that we build our lives\nand we were able to project to the children a normal set of values, not trying to burden them\nwith our past. However, they have to know. They were maybe always more sensitive to us\nbecause they knew that that's all we have is them. They are very attentive. And except for\nthe bad memories, I don't think that I have much of a stigma of really what happened now,\nbecause I still was 18 and 20 years old when I came to this country. I think that when you're\nolder and when you have more of the past on you, like previous marriages and children that\nyou lost, it's much harder to adjust in your life. But I must say that I adjusted to the life here\nvery well, and embraced life for whatever it could offer me. Tried to compensate for lost\ntime and my lost youth, and grateful to God that it all happened that way.",
        "Q: I want to ask you a couple of things. You lived for a long time Azonarian (ph) Tell me what\nthat ended up doing for you.",
        "A: Well, living Azonarian (ph) actually didn't do anything for me, because the way I was\nbrought up, I always knew who I was. My family was not religious. My father was the\nfounder of a Zionist youth movement in my hometown. I always knew who I was. I always\nhad holidays. I went to a Jewish high school where Hebrew was taught everyday. I was\namong Jewish people, Jewish friends, and I always knew who I was. I could have never lost\nmy identity, and I was fortunate to marry somebody of my own faith. Now, just to give you\nan example, I had friends, who at my age, 14, 15, were also in the same situation that I was.\nBut they somehow found Polish mates, who maybe at that time were helping them to hide.\nThey never went back to Judaism or went back to being Jewish, and I cannot, I'm not the\njudge for them. I cannot blame them for that. But this is what happened to many people.\nThis is what happened to a lot of males who married Gentile women, who were helping\nthem and stayed in Europe and Poland, and are raising Gentile families. That happens to\nwomen that encountered the same thing. Some broke off and some stayed at the same. So I\nwas just fortunate always to know who I was, and to be able to share my life with a person\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwho was of my own faith, and therefore it was never any question for me to be anything else\nbut a Jew, because my parents instilled that in me, and because there was just not a way for\nme. It was just that everything else was just done out of need. If I had to go to church, it\nmeant nothing to me. If I had to be arrogant, it meant nothing to me. To me it was only a\nmeans of survival, and I was fortunate enough not to have to continue this falsehood and get\nback to myself to be whoever I am.",
        "Q: And when you lived Azonarian (ph) you learned a lot about anti-Semitism, that you think\nyou otherwise wouldn't have learned.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me about it.",
        "A: Yeah, this is very unfortunate, because I lived Azonarian through the two years during the\nwar, and also for a certain time when we were liberated, I did not want to go back to my\nJewish name until I left Poland, for cowardly reasons, I did not trust them. There were\nprograms after the war in Kielce, there were programs all over. There was a lot of hatred,\nand I didn't want to survive the war and then something happen to me. For instance, I\nalways telling my husband that if we live in Europe and I have a child and it's going to be\nmale, I would never circumcise that child, because of my brother, who I think I lost because\nof that. I had certain feelings and certain stigma. After the war, I encountered a lot of anti-\nSemitism, I mean sayings like, for instance, \"Oh, look at this Jew on the bus again. Hitler\ndidn't kill them all. Here they're getting out of Russia. Here we have them again. We\nthought that Poland is going to be without Jews.\" So, I couldn't help but hearing all that, and\nthat just made me feel very bad. I could not say anything, because I still did not want\nanybody to know that I was Jewish up until we left, and then, of course, my husband came\nback to his own name, because he had to have false papers too, just in case they catch him.\nAnd then, of course, as soon as we came to Vienna and we became students we decided that\nwe absolutely want our name back and we wanted to be who we were. And that's why, you\nknow, everything went back to our name. Our kept my first name because it was so hard for\nme. I was so attuned to it already, and there was just me, you know, between the age of 16\nor 17. I was just so used to it already, that I modified it a little bit and kept my Hebrew name\nas a middle name, and just stayed with that name. But it's very unfortunate that I have to say\nthat, but this is the very truth.",
        "Q: I don't have anymore questions for you. Do you have anything you want to add?",
        "A: Well, I feel that probably this interview will be completed was bad. If I omitted things, it's\nbecause it's very hard to concise six years of tortures and trouble into a small amount of\ntime. I tried to be as exact as I could, and my memory still serves me so that I can remember\nevents more or less, dates and at that point I think I was quite precise in telling the story the\nway it really was. I'm grateful to have this opportunity to say it, and to put it on tape for\nposterity. I always think of my grandchildren being able to press a button and see their\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngrandparents tell the story. I feel that there's a great need of these things to be known,\nbecause of certain people that deny the Holocaust. I am very grateful that I had this\nopportunity to do so, and I hope it will never happen again, America will never have to face\nup to anything so horrible that the Holocaust was.

        "A: We found that before.",
        "A: Well, my name 1s, my real name is Estella Rubinlicht and I was born in Poland in a town\ncalled Lublin, the town that became very infamous because of the concentration camp that\nwe had next door my --------. I was born to a nice Jewish family, traditional, observant. Both\nof my parents were professional people which was a little unusual for the circumstances of\nJews living in Poland at that time. My mother was a dentist who put herself through school,\nwhile my father was a court-appointed interpreter in three languages, and I also had a little\nbrother, who was seven years younger than I was. The town of Lublin had about 140,000 to\n150,000 inhabitants. We had a very famous yeshiva, and also I would say that about 60,000\nout of the population have been Jews. Before the war, I was little but we kind of enjoyed\nnormal life for Jews. We were allowed to practically do everything, except Jews couldn't\nhold any government jobs, and also going into the university was very complicated being a\nJew -- there was a special quota for Jews. But I happened to attend private schools, both\nprimary school and high school both private, because simply there was a better education\nmy parents could afford. Public school was compulsory but high school was not available to\nall the population. I had a very happy childhood, very close-knit family, lots of love, two\nsets of grandparents, not too big of a family, we were not a very large family; but kind of\nwell-to-do, not extravagant, and very happy. I had a happy childhood until when I was\ntwelve years old the war broke out. The rumor started in 1939 in the summer when we as\nteenagers were going to the swimming pool and doing all kinds of summer things, and the\nrumor started that there was going to be a war. My father at dinnertime -- we always had\ndinner together, that was the family thing to do -- told us that we had to be prepared ----------\n-- and maybe we should accumulate some more food, because for a certain time things are\ngoing to be going on that are going to be bad. Nobody ever expected what is going to\nhappen. People thought that maybe there would be a war that would blow over, and that's\nabout it. I mean, in the history of the world never anything like that happened. So the Jews\nwere quite sedate. They kind of thought, you know, that whatever happens, just happens.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd it wasn't until suddenly on the first of September, 1939, that we woke up to severe\nbombing and not being prepared and of knowing what it 1s really, we all went down to the\nbasement and stayed there while the raid was over. When we came out, there was a\nrealization that we had war and that Germany has attacked Poland. Well, there was panic,\nwe didn't know what to do, and people were completely at the stage of panic, they didn't\nknow what to expect. Well, this state of affairs did not take too long, because after four days\nthe Polish government went away from Poland and the next day on the fifth day of this\ndisarray, the Germans came in. Now, all I saw was these mad Germans running around the\ncity and running into homes and just grabbing everything they could. So into our home a\ngroup of Germans came in, tore the watch and everything they could off my mother's hands,\ngrabbed all the things we had, took whatever they wanted to, broke china, beat us up, and\nwent out. That was my first encounter with what the Germans are really like. Then they\nwere running around the streets and they decided that they want men, so they gave an order\nthat so-and-so many men have to come to a certain place and of course we were very\nworried. A lot of people at that time, as I recall, were running away to Russia, east, and we\neven had an opportunity, our family to go. There was a bus that our neighbor owned and he\nwanted all of us to go to Russia. But you know, my mother was a homemaker, she had her\nlivelihood there, they just couldn't part with things, they didn't know how to go to the\nunknown. And so, placidly, most of the Jewish population stayed. Some of them did go\neast, but my family decided to stay. Well, the next -- it was 1939, of course schools were\nclosed, the Germans were riding around, there was a curfew after seven and we were right\naway given yellow our stars saying \"Jude,\" that means Jew, we had to wear one on the left\nshoulder in front and one in the back so they could see us from the back and front. And we\nwere living under curfew with very little food, not knowing what's going to happen next.\nNow, what happened in the period between 1939 and 1942 was the fact that the Jewish\npopulation was getting smaller and smaller and smaller because through different actions of\ntaking people away to concentration camps the Germans would round up a certain area of\nthe city, take out the Jews, beat them up, and ship them some place off. We did not know\nwhat happened to these people, what happened to the families, because we had no contact\nwith newspapers, radios, everything was taken away from us. So we merely existed, not in\nour own homes any more. As the Jewish population was getting smaller and smaller, the\nGermans have been giving the Jews smaller quarters to live, and because they wanted them\nall together, they were forming what wasn't even a ghetto yet but an area that was dedicated\nfor the Jews. And they would put, like, four or five families in one apartment so that when\nthey need to take them out, 1t would be easier for them to have them all together. Well, we\nlived through many of those actions, and fortunately both of my parents were working --\nworking so that the Germans needed them; therefore, we were spared at the beginning,\nbecause my mother as a dentist was working in a hospital and the Germans needed care.\nNow, my father also had a job, in the administration of the ghetto, so they also needed him.\nBut as I was already 14 years old, I needed a job on my own in order to be spared. So I got a\nlittle job in the bank helping out. And that's how through all these actions we were able to\nsomehow survive. Food was scarce. My mother was getting a little bit of food from\npeasants who were coming still to her for medical advice, and so we survived until April\n1942. By April 1942 was one of those big actions where they took away a lot of Jewish\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\npeople, and out of 60,000 only 4,000 survived. We were given special passes, special Reich\ndocuments like passports, and these were the 4,000 Jews that actually were working for the\nGermans and that the Germans decided to keep for a little bit longer. We still did not know\nwhere all the people went. Well, the state of living was just terrible, you know -- Germans\nwere coming in, cutting off the beards of the Jewish people, they were beating them up, they\nwere taking them out haphazardly, they were demanding things, soldiers were running\naround and taking advantage of women, they plundered. There was practically nothing any\nmore because we had lived in a little tiny village outside of Lublin where they put these\n4,000 people to live; very inhumanly, in little shacks, in little homes where very poor\npeasants lived -- they had to be evacuated and they were given apartment in the city that the\nJews lived in. You could see a horse and a cow on the third floor balcony because these\npeople took all their belongings with them; we were put in that little village where these\npeople lived before. There they put a barbed wire and called it a ghetto. This was a ghetto\nbut not in the idea of a ghetto like in Warsaw, this was a ghetto, this was a settlement of\nJews which were surrounded by barbed wire and constantly watched so there was no way\nout. The people that watched, the soldiers that watched the ghetto were mostly Lithuanians\nand Ukrainians. They were helping the Germans to keep order because the Germans could\nnot be bothered with these little things like watching the Jews, they wanted them when they\nneeded them. And in that little village they were coming in like four in the morning wearing\nwhite gloves, dressed to kill as clean as they always were, and beat up the Jews and taking\nthem out again. That state of affairs lasted from April '42 until November '42. I was still\nwith my parents and I was still with my brother. In that little place we still managed to go\nout a little bit because we were young, and that's when I met my present husband.",
        "A: OK. At the times I just described, I was still with my parents, so we were still together, and\nwe still had some means to buy some food on the black market. So my brother was my\nresponsibility, because up until that moment I was still home and my parents cared for me. I\neven managed to go out for ice cream, not late in the evening, but we had a little garden\nnext to the little house where we lived and the Germans made sure that the Jews tilled the\nsoil and grew some flowers because they had to show to the International Red Cross how\nnice the Jews had it in those ghettos. And every morning at six o'clock we would be taken\nout through a gate to work and taken to work in the city on buses and trucks. And every day\nat six o'clock, they would bring us back, and then there was curfew. So that was the life that\nsummer. Now, not far away from this little village was the concentration camp, --------\n[name of camp] and we saw the inmates of the concentration camp working on the roads\nwearing these uniforms, and that's all we saw. We knew that there is a camp there, and we\nsaw the people, emaciated in these striped uniforms, showing us -- like this -- that they are\nhungry. But we were always in groups watched by the Germans and we were not allowed to\nhave any contact with these people, they were digging roads. And we knew that something\nis going on there, something very, very bad, because the concentration camp was not far\naway. In fact, our little town was called -------- and the big concentration was called --------\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n[both names]. So there was a little bit interconnected this whole area. There was an incident\nwhere friend of my present husband had a sandwich, and so this Jew asked him for food and\nasked the guard -- whoever he was, I don't know if it was a German or Lithuanian -- if he\nmay give him the sandwich, the guard said \"yes\" and as soon as he gave him the sandwich\nhe shot him, he shot this friend of my husband. So there was the situation. I still was with\nmy parents, I'm stretching it all the time because it really was the last time I was with my\nparents in that little ghetto. And having a very sheltered life and having a good home life, I\nreally never thought was life is all about and how to go about managing it on my own. We\ndidn't grow up as fast over there as children grow up today, and being 14, 15, really meant\nto be under the care of your parents all the time, especially when there were no schools -- I\nwas completely cut off from school for three years already. It wasn't until November 1942\nthat the tragedy happened. One early morning -- (she takes deep breath) I have to admit and\nI have to tell you there was no way to escape at that time. Even if we would like to stay\noutside of the ghetto, there was no way to do anything, there was no people that would take\nus in. They were hunting Jews all over. We had no papers, we could not get a job, we could\nnot get a place to live, we really couldn't go out and stay on the other side of the ghetto. It\nwas impossible. They would find you sooner or later. It wouldn't be the Germans, it would\nbe the Poles that were the Nazis. But that was happening all the time. So it was on the\nmorning in 1942 in November -- I don't know if it was the 6th or the 7th of November that\nwe were woken up at three in the morning that we were told that everybody has to come to\nthis big square because we cannot stay home any more. And we kind of had a feeling that\nthis is the end of this little settlement of the Jews, because we heard rumors that Jewish\nvillages and settlements had stopped existing all around in Poland. So we knew that if we\ncome to this square, they will take us away forever. What happened was that my father\narranged for my mother to go to the hospital and stay there, thinking that maybe the\nGermans will honor the doctors still there, like they did before. Some people had little\nhidings 1n their homes but we didn't have any, but my husband's parents had a little hiding\nspot in their little home, which was really a double wall where you could stand like lined up\nin a queue if 1t were necessary, but not for too long. Well, my present husband, who was at\nthat time just a friend, came over running to our little place and he said, \"Why don't they\ntake her,\" meaning me, \"to my hiding place? Because she doesn't really have such good\npapers and they probably will take her away. And we have this little hiding place, so me and\nmy family are going in there.\" And we didn't even have time to think, I didn't have time to\nsay goodbye to my parents. My father said, \"Go, Honey, it's the best thing for you to go.\"\nAnd I just went with him, and he said, \"I am going to try to take care of my brother and see\nwhat we can do.\" And there was a -- I never saw my parents again. And so we went in to the\nhiding with my present husband, and we stayed in this little wall hiding place probably\nbetween six in the morning up until maybe two in the afternoon. We tried not to cough, we\ntried not to move. And then at two o'clock somebody knocked and said, \"You might as well\ncome out, this is the end of the ghetto. You will not survive here, there is no food, there\ngoing to come and raze all those buildings. There are proclamations all over on the walls,\nthis is the end of this little ghetto and that all the Jews have to come to a certain barrack to\ngo to Majdanek Concentration Camp, because this 1s the liquidation of the ghetto.\" Well,\nmy first thought was to go back to my house and see if anybody is there but we weren't\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nallowed to move any more, we could only allowed to go to this barrack, that's all. There\nwere Germans 1n this ------- and they were showing you how to get to this barrack and there\nwas no other choice but to go there. My husband's parents said, \"You are so young\" -- he\nalso had a sister -- \"it's too bad, maybe you try to run away through the barbed wire and\nmaybe you can squeeze, at least the two of you to survive.\" So we tried, it was bright\ndaylight and we tried to -------- at one point, the barbed wires, and to run. Well, I have to tell\nyou that around the ghetto there was nothing, which 1s plain fields, for miles and miles to a\nhouse and it wasn't like you could run into a building or something, there was nothing there.\nWell, we ran for about a little mile to a ------ and there was shooting but they didn't hurt us,\nbut then finally one of those guards ran after us, beat my husband up -- he still has a\npermanent scar in his eye, no vision, and called us all kinds of names and told us \"back to\nthe ghetto you go.\" So that was not successful. When we came back to the ghetto I could not\nsee my mother any more because my mother was already taken. The hospital, the doctors,\nthe staff, and all the people that were in there, I mean the patients, they were all taken to the\nconcentration camp, so my mother was already in Majdanek, poor thing. I saw my father,\nwho was still around, and I saw my brother. And my husband's parents were still with us\nand we were thinking -- we had three days to go to this barrack to go to the concentration\ncamp. Well, we were making quick decisions, we didn't know what to do. We could not go\nback home for any money or clothes or anything. My husband's parents, unfortunately,\ndecided that they will go to this barrack, and so did his sister. She really did not want to live\nany more. We were so broken up, we had no will to survive. We went through three years of\ndehumanization, deprivation, hunger and everything, and you know what -------------------\nmaybe. Moreover, ---------going on like that. But my father said to us, I \"really want\nsomebody to provide for the family.\" I was thirteen and a half at this point. \"We're going to\ntry in the middle of the night when it's dark for young to get through the barbed wire. And\nmaybe you can survive.\" So we passively said OK and we tried a couple of nights and we\ncouldn't do it. But then on the third night my father got some gold coins and some watches\nand some -------- together and said, \"I will try to bribe some guard, maybe he will let you\ngo.\" And on the third morning, about four o'clock -- 1t was in November, it was very dark,\nthere was snow on the ground -- my father arranged for the guards to look away, gave them\nall this stuff and said, \"I want you to look the other way. I want my family to get out.\" And\nso, myself, my present husband, who was just a friend, and my little brother, who was nine\nyears old, were practically pushed by my father through the barbed wire to go and survive. I\nwanted my father to come with. He said, \"Oh no, I have to go to my ----- to the\nconcentration camp and I have to help your mother. I cannot go with you.\" He said, \"Go,\nand see what you can do for yourself.\" And so we did. We had to walk quite a long while\nbecause there was nobody around. And they were shooting. But then we saw a peasant,\nbecause the city was very far, maybe ten kilometers away. We saw a peasant and we asked\nhim if he would give us a ride. He might have known who we are but he pretended maybe\nthat he didn't. We thought he's either going to kill us all or he's going to take us to the city,\nbut he didn't. He took us into the city and 1n the city it was really bedlam because everybody\nknew that the --------------- and everybody knew the Jews were running away and everybody\nwas looking for Jews. And if you found a Jew and showed him to a German, you would get\nten pounds of sugar or five pounds of flour, something like that, they were posted all over\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlooking for the Jews that are running way from the ghetto. So it was impossible in a small\ntown to really hide overnight. But fortunately my husband knew somebody that worked for\nmy father and we walked in and said, \"May we just stay overnight some place\" and of\ncourse they were scared because you know they would find Jews by them, they would shoot\nthem too. So it wasn't only the point that they didn't want to help, because we knew some\nvery fine people that were patients of my mother, and my mother told me she gave them\nstuff to hide like candelabra and linens and fur coats; in case we ever needed them they\nwould be outside the ghetto. But when we came to these people they said, \"Yes, you need\nsomebody to help you out but we cannot let you overnight.\" The only person that let us\novernight was this worker that used to work for my husband's father, and they put us in the\nbasement full of coal and potatoes and everything that people put down there, and we stayed\novernight, the three of us. A very unusual trio. My husband was then 22, I was 16, and a\nnine-year-old boy. And we -------------. We stayed overnight and we knew we had to get out.\nSo we had no way to stay in the house, but in the morning I heard that the Germans came in\nand shot my father, because my father still was in the ghetto, he was one of the last left\nones. And as he tried to get out I understood that he was shot -------------ghetto. So I was\nable to find that out, and of course my husband's father, mother and sister all went to the\nghetto: the ghetto was no more. And we somehow scraped together enough to buy tickets on\nthe train to go to Warsaw because Warsaw was a big town where nobody knew us and we\nwere dreaming and hoping that maybe we could establish our existence as Aryans in the\nWarsaw outside of the ghetto. Well, that wasn't so simple because before we took the train I\nwent into a lady whom my mother gave things to to keep for us. This lady was supposed to\nbe a friend of my mother's and she also lived in the same building that we did. In the\nmeantime she told me to come back at a different hour and there were two Gestapo people\nwaiting for me, so she wasn't friendly to me. I almost lost my life at that point because they\nwere walking with me and trying to take me to the Gestapo, and then they were calling for\nsome other people -- it's impossible to describe the situation but I ran into a bombed-out\nbuilding where there was a little door and in this little door was a shoemaker living and the\nshoemaker knew my husband, and that lady decided to hide me in that little room of hers.\nShe really was the one that saved my life, because I knew that I cannot hide there, there was\nnothing there, just one little room and a curtain. She said, \"You stand behind the curtain.\"\nMy shoes were showing. I said, \"I can't jeopardize everybody else.\" And my brother and my\nhusband were was sitting there in that little room but they didn't know my family, they just\nknew me. And somehow she opened the door real wide and we played the housing scene.\nAs the Germans came up there to look for me, she didn't even let wait until they came in.\nShe came out, dusting off a little rug, and they said to her, \"Did you see a Jewish woman\nrunning around here?\" She said, \"No.\" She was an older, simple lady. She said, \"No, I didn't\nsee anybody here. This 1s all empty, there are no people walking through here.\" She said,\n\"Well, there was a Jewish lady that we just lost sight of and she's somewhere here. No,\nyou're welcome to come in, there is nobody here.\" The Gestapo people walked away. And\nas they walked to the end of the street, I ran to the other side of the street around the corner.\nSo that was one of my very close encounters. From there we took the train to Warsaw. It\nwas a long ride ---------. I think my father put a little money in my pocket and that was just\nabout all that we had but I had a very good pair of shoes, because every Jew believes that no\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmatter what happens with you, you have to have very good pair of leather shoes in case you\nhave to walk. I also had a coat with a little fur underneath so in case I get stuck some place I\nshould be warm; that's what I had. And of course my brother was with us, this little boy.\nAnd in the train they made ------- all the time that we were Jews, smugglers and Jews, and\nagain Jews. I don't know how we ever made it to Warsaw. We got into Warsaw at four\no'clock in the morning and they have these rickshaws that used to take to the city, like either\nhorse and buggy to take a rickshaw, and as we came into Warsaw they recognized us right\naway -- the Poles, not the Jews. See, the Germans per se would not recognize a Jew, they\ndid not know, they were not aware of the characteristics of the Jews -- whether you had a\nlong nose or whether your Polish is not proper or whether you speak with a Jewish accent;\nthey did not know this but the Poles were absolutely acute to this, they were really experts.\nSo they somehow saw -- they were waiting for people to get off the train, they knew that the\nJews are running -- and they saw my husband was given by one of his friends a fancy coat\nwith a fancy hat and that is no ----- with us, they really didn't ------ to kill us------------ and\nright away when we took the rickshaw and tried to go into town where I thought maybe I\ncould find -- I had an address -- some people who would help us out with false papers, or\nanything. They right away took us in their rickshaw and they were going and going and\ngoing. And I said, \"Well, we wanted to go to this-and-that street.\" He said, \"Oh no, that's not\nwhere you're going.\" I said, \"Where are we going?\" He said, \"You're going to the Gestapo.\"\nI said, \"Why is that?\" He said, \"Because you are Soviet Jews and we know you that you're\nhiding. And because you are Jews, you can't survive, we are taking you straight to the\nGestapo.\" And they were Poles, young Poles, who were riding this rickshaw and we said to\nthem, \"Stop! Why would you do that?\" He said, \"----------, you should get back to the\nGestapo.\" \"What do you care whether we live or not?\" \"No, you have to go.\" Well,\nwhatever we had on we gave it to them. We stopped in a little shack in a little corner of -----\n--- building and I told them, \"Whatever I have you can take. I still have a little money. You\ncan take my rings, you can take my watch, whatever I have, but please leave us here on the\nstreet, don't take us.\" So that's what happened. They stripped us of everything we had and\nleft us in the corner of that street by the door of some building. So here we are, about twelve\no'clock in the afternoon with nowhere to go, with nowhere to sleep, with no money. Soon\nenough we had no choice but to try to find a way to get into the ghetto. And we knew that\nthis is suicidal. We realized it but there was no other way for us -- we couldn't practically\nsleep on the street. Talking about homeless people today, you know, we were really\nhomeless. There was just nobody I knew, nobody that I could talk to, but we knew one\nthing: we knew how to get into the ghetto. It also wasn't easy. You just don't take a bus\nintended for the ghetto and say, \"I want to go in there.\" We decided, we knew, that the Jews\ncome out from the ghetto to work every day morning and they go back at night. We knew\nthat they go to work at the certain depot, coal depot, where they unload wagons of coal for\nthe Germans. And we knew that if we go there and when we talk to the supervisor, who was\nJewish, and if he has ------ people going back to the ghetto, he will probably do us a favor\nand take us on. So that's what we did. I think it was November 9th or 10th. We just went to\nthis place ----- bus, and we found this group of Jews working there. We talked to the fellow.\nWe said, \"Look: We are three people, we cannot stay on the Aryan side, we have nothing,\nwe want to go to the ghetto. And I had an uncle in the ghetto who was my father's brother\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand I was hoping that at least I could go get a meal there and somebody to talk to. Because\nwe were so tired from running and at this point we wanted to die as Jews. Which later\nreversed itself, you see. But we were so tired of running, we see the best that all the other\nJews in the ghetto, because we have no parents any more and nobody to take care of us,\nwe're just alone, and whatever happens, happens. So that night we got into the ghetto. I\nremember that my brother had a little coat and on the coat there was a fur collar. We had to\ntear off his collar and throw it out the window of the train because Jews were not allowed to\nhave any fur on them. And whatever else we had, like a little suitcase, that had to all be\ntaken away, thrown out, because we were going back to the ghetto as workers. And that's\nhow we got into the ghetto. And that ghetto was really not what I remembered from my\nhome, whether was barbed wire, it was summer, we had little flowers in the garden, and\nthere was my mother and father and somebody to protect me. That was a twelve-foot wall,\nwith people in there who were emaciated. It was almost the end thing of the Warsaw ghetto.\nIt was the \"small ghetto\" what they call where people were laying on the ground, dead,\ncovered up with newspapers; where there was absolutely no food. On the black market they\nwere Selling horsemeat. It was absolutely a tragic picture. And that's what we got into.\nUnfortunately, we didn't get much help from the family. My family was not responsive to\nmy needs. The only thing they did when we got there, they meant us to ----- marriage. They\nsaid, \"Are there two of you?\" I said, \"Yes, we are friends, we knew each other briefly. It just\nso happens that we care for each other but I just lost my parents, he just lost his parents, I'm\n16 years old, just to think of getting married is the last thing in my mind. We want to\nsurvive.\" \"Well,\" my uncle said, \"You know that's not right. If you are going to be together\nyou have to get married.\" I said, \"Well, if you want to do it, then arrange for it. Fine with\nus.\" Well, my uncle found a rabbi, the rabbi didn't want to marry me, I was too young, but\nfinally there was a rabbi who on a Saturday afternoon, December 13, married us in his little\nroom, wherever he lived there in the ghetto. They got me some dress -- from a neighbor, I\nguess, because I didn't have anything, -- and we were married. We were married, then we\nwere given a ------, you know, the Jewish certificate of marriage, which, incidentally later,\nwas flushed down the toilet because when we became \"Aryans,\" we couldn't have it, there\nwas no document of marriage. And as we got married, my uncle said -- first of all he told us\nwe can't stay with him; he still had a nice apartment and quite a bit of money and he said,\n\"No, you can't stay here.\" So we had to find ourselves a place. And fortunately I met some\npeople who were from my home town and knew my parents. As a matter of fact, one lady\ngave me her ring, her wedding band, to get married with, before the wedding, that we got\nmarried with. They told us that they lived --------------, which at that time was not the\nheadquarters of the uprising yet, and that they all have one apartment that that lady ---- 10 or\n12 families, but they will be willing to designate a quarter for us so that we can go to the\nopen-air market and get a sack with straw, fill it, put it there, and live there for a while. That\nwas end of December, beginning of January, in the Warsaw ghetto. We did that and\nunfortunately my uncle did not want to keep my brother either, so I had to bring my brother\ninto this settlement of people in there. And we just existed, stmply. My husband was going\nevery morning with a group of the people. He was unloading coal, and as a reward he could\ntake on his back a sack of coal as much as he could carry, four/for kilometers and on the\ntrain going back to the ghetto. And because we didn't want to use the coal to heat our\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\napartment because we couldn't afford it, we would go and knock on the doors of the people\nthat still had a little money, and they would buy this coal from us. And for that money we\nwould go to the black market and buy a little bit of flour, whatever we could. And that's\nhow we lived for three long months. We both were very ill, as you know, from disease and\nall kinds of indigestion and gastritis and typhoid fever; it was very prevalent, people lived\nunder very inhuman circumstances. There was no proper food. My brother was nine years\nold, it was very difficult for me because he was in the growing stage and he did not\nunderstand all the things that are happening to us -- that we have to hide and we have to be\nbeaten up. On January I believe 7th or 8th, the Germans surrounded the ghetto again and\nthey took ---------- I don't know. At that time there were still about 200,000 people in the\nghetto -- I might be wrong with my numbers -- and then they took another 25,000 at that\ntime and we had to hide 1n a room that we closed off. So it was just extremely difficult, it\nwas just like the ----.",
        "A: Because my uncle was not a nice person. Very simple.",
        "A: His wife and a child. My uncle was an extremely intelligent, egoistic, self-centered person,\nwho didn't get married until later in his life. He spoke English in Poland, in Warsaw. He\nworked for the Joint Distribution Committee, he had a high position, but during the War\nwhen Warsaw was already the ghetto and we in Lublin still had a lot of food from the\npeasants, my father would send -- we were allowed to send packages every week to\nWarsaw, a certain amount of food, and my father ------- supported him maybe a year. But --\nI don't want to talk bad about my relatives but he just didn't do anything for us. He figured\nhe wouldn't have enough money to survive for himself and he just practically threw us out\ninto the street. It was winter, it was a very heavy winter. We didn't have proper clothes, we\ndidn't have proper heat, we just sat in a corner with all these other people from our home\ntown. And one week when the Germans surrounded the ghetto and we locked off a room to\ntry to hide -- we were maybe 30 people in that one room and we were just eating raw\ncabbage and radishes, and whatever we could put into this room -- we had no bathroom, just\na little pail. It was practically inhuman but otherwise the Germans would have found us. So\nwe blocked off one room and put the furniture in front of it so the Germans would not know\nwhen they come into the house that we are there. That's how we survived the deportation on\nJanuary 7 in Warsaw, because we had no papers that we are working there. And then while\nwe existed in this ghetto we were hearing rumors -- it was already 1943 -- that something 1s\ncooking there, that there might be an uprising. The Jews are buying the munitions from the\nPoles said something might happen, that maybe really Germans are going to liquidate the\nwhole ghetto. And there were rumors that this ghetto is not going to exist any more because\nit was practically one of the last ghettos that the Germans kept. So what was happening is\nthat a lot of Jews who still had some means, they were building bunkers. Those bunkers\nwere not the bunkers that were built by the Underground but they were bunkers that they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbuilt to survive. They thought that maybe if they built these very excessive bunkers and put\nwater here and cooking facilities, that maybe they can survive in the bunkers if the ghetto\ngets destroyed for reason, either through the Jewish uprising or for any other reason. And\npeople who could contribute to go into those bunkers were partaking in this whole idea.\nNow, we didn't know anybody, we were absolutely orphans, we didn't know anybody there\nand we absolutely had no chance to ever think that we would be allowed to be taken into\nthose bunkers. I was very sick, and after living in the ghetto over three months all of a\nsudden I just felt an urge of getting out. It was just the opposite of what I thought three\nmonths ago -- three months before, I was outside of the ghetto and I couldn't find a place for\nmyself and I said, \"Let me die like all the other Jews. You get shot and it's all over with.\"\nWe still didn't know about concentration camps and gas chambers. But at that point -- it was\nspring, it was in February or March and I just felt an urge to be shut outside of the ghetto,\nnot in this ghetto. I just felt like I want some light and fresh air, and maybe I want to see\nnormal living people for a while, and then if I go, it's different. I just felt 1t. And maybe for\nthe sake of my brother. We just wanted to get out. First of all, you have to have the will, and\nthen you have the opportunity, you know -- one without the other just doesn't work. And\nmost of the Jews, and also us -- we had no will any more and that's why we came to this\npoint. But at this point we somehow got our strength together to get the will to maybe want\nto get out. But getting out of the ghetto -- I don't even have an example of the impossibility\nto this idea. There just isn't such a thing, you know. There's no such a thing that you can go\nto a 12-foot wall, who surrounded by Germans, there's no such a thing that you get out and\nnot be caught, because the whole area of the ghetto was always patrolled by Poles who only\nwaited for somebody to run away. So it was impossible. We had no connections but we had\nan idea and we started to think that maybe we should pursue this idea: It just so happened\nthat my husband was still working at the depot. One day while he was there he saw saw a\nfamiliar face, the face of a man who was wearing a railroad uniform, and he was convinced\nthat he knows this fellow and that he's a friend of his from Lublin and that he's a Jew.\nSlowly they started to look at each other and they recognized each other, and from a\ndistance they said, [speaking in whisper] \"Are you so-and-so\" and he said, \"Yes.\" And he\nsaid, \"I don't believe -- what are you doing here?\" My husband said, \"I'm in the ghetto, with\nmy wife and her brother. What are YOU doing here?\" He said, \"Well, I'm pretending I'm a\nPolish railroad worker and I have a lot of connections, I live outside of the ghetto, and I\nhave a lot of connections with Polish people who hide Jews for money. But big money. And\nmy whole family is being hidden in the ghetto inside of Warsaw.\" It just so happened that I\nknew the whole family and I also knew the friend of my husband, and he said, \"Do you have\nany money? I can arrange for you to find a place.\" This doesn't mean -- his whole family\nwas killed by the Poles. And that doesn't mean that he himself survived, because he didn't,\nbut he helped us. Because if you were hiding in 1943, that doesn't mean that you're going to\nmake it for a year and a half. So, my husband said to him, \"I have no money but we would\nlike to get out of the ghetto.\" He said, \"I know of a treasure that was buried in the ghetto by\nmy father. I don't know exactly what treasure it was, you know, what was 1n it, but 1t was\njust a lot of things buried there. My father was instrumental in putting a crate together and\nputting it into a place in the earth area. I would be willing to show somebody where this is,\neven go with them.\" It was so dangerous to go back to my home town. This fellow said, \"No\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nproblem, we have Polish uniforms, we have Polish papers. I'm going to talk to my Polish\nfriends and see if they would be willing to go and get this treasure out and get you out of the\nghetto.\" So that was just the beginning of the dream, because he came back in a few more\ndays and my husband saw him and he said, \"Well, they would be willing. There's a whole\ngroup of people that would be willing to take you back to Lublin and see if the treasure 1s\nreally there.\" But my husband said to him, \"You know, the way things look here, something\nis going to happen any day and I might just come back with all that money and treasure and\nmy wife and her brother might be killed by then. If I am taken out to go for this treasure, I\nwould like them to come with me at least out of the ghetto and wait some place outside of\nthe ghetto until this all materializes.\" And that's exactly what happened, that miracle\nhappened. That one day he came back to the depot and he said, \"Dead on that date, at six in\nthe morning, you come out with a group of workers and I will have two Polish people\nstanding outside and pretending, when you just walk through the gate and you walk and\nwalk and then you walk away from the group, I'm going to have these people pretend that\nthey grab you. They're going to grab you and they will take you on a streetcar to a place we\nare staying.\" And that's exactly what happened. The three of us went out in the morning, we\nwent through this gate and these two young people came up to us and grabbed us and took\nus to a place. And there was the miracle. I think we left the ghetto about two weeks before\nthe uprising. Because while I was on the Aryan side already, I saw the ghetto burning and I\nheard all the remarks that the Polish people said because of the ghetto burning. They were\nkind of happy, some were. Of course the people that helped us, I must say, we had a lot of\nhelp from certain Polish people and we were taken to a family of an engineer who was from\nthe Underground and who kept me and my brother until my husband and the whole group --\nthey arranged a whole group to go to Lublin. They were prepared for all the adversities and\nthey would arrange to take for this treasure, they gave him a uniform, a ----- uniform, and\nwhile they were gone I was waiting with my brother. There were some other Jewish people\nthat this engineer, this Polish Underground person, kept in his house temporarily until these\npeople were found quarters where they could hide. Well, they came back, and what\nhappened was: First they came back when the ground was frozen, so they couldn't dig. Then\nthey went back ten days later and they were digging under very unusual circumstances -- the\nshaft that it was buried in was going under the street, they had to pretend that they measure\nthe street and do all kinds of repairs and things. And to make the story short, they found the\ncase was empty. And that really saved our life, because otherwise these people would think\nthat we were lying, that it was simply a trick to get out of the ghetto, but this whole case\nwith all the things was buried was there. It was broken up and empty.",
        "A: Well, actually I personally have no experience of the uprising because we were fortunate\nenough to leave the ghetto maybe two weeks prior to the uprising. What we knew was there\nwas great preparations. Everything was very secretive and we knew they were preparing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbunkers; we knew that they were buying a lot of ammunition outside, from the Poles,\nbecause that was the sources that the Jews were buying ammunition. We knew that things\nwere going to happen, we knew that there's preparations, but because we got out about ten\ndays before, I really have no knowledge of actually what happened, except from what I was\nreading I only can tell you that when we were outside of the ghetto and we stayed not far\naway -- of course the burning ghetto could be seen from miles and miles away and when the\nghetto started it was just one glob of fire, you could see that all this area was burning and a\nlot of streets outside of the ghetto were cordoned off. There was police, and there was\nGerman police and Polish police and you could not even streetcars and everything got stuck\nat a certain point because you could not get through because of the flame and because of the\nshooting and because of what was going on. So the life in Warsaw per se was completely\ndisrupted and I can be witness to this because I lived outside of the ghetto as an Aryan and I\nwas moving, I wasn't hiding. At any time I was out, moving, so I unfortunately heard\nremarks from people that was very favorable to what was happening there. And of course I\npretend no reaction but I was very hurt about that.",
        "A: Like things that the Jews are burning. \"Now we're going to get rid of all the bedbugs,\" you\nknow. Things that weren't very pleasant to me to hear. And yet there were Poles who helped\nme and kept me, right now, waiting for me to get my way through with arranging my life on\nthe outside of the ghetto. But what was happening in there, I absolutely -- I mean I have an\nidea but I was not witness to it. Because we stayed in the Warsaw ghetto from November 11\nthrough maybe end of March or beginning of April; that was the extent of our life. We\nwitnessed the last days of the ghetto per se but we were not part of it all. I can not give\ninformation on that from what I --",
        "A: Well, I was always afraid living as a gentile in hiding. Every day and every minute I was\nalways very vulnerable. My living as a gentile consisted of having a piece of paper which I\nsomehow secured or was secured for me and I had to pretend to be that person. But I have\nto digress back to the fact that when my husband came back and I was still with these\npeople that kept me for about two weeks, and when he came back and when it turned out\nthat there's no money in there, he was able to bring a little, a few things like, I think, two fur\ncoats that his parents left with some gentile people in Lublin, and we planned to sell maybe\ntwo suitcases with clothes, -- everything on the black market was of value, and we planned\nto sell this. And at that time, these people that we stayed with, who were part of the Polish\nunderground, told us that even so now there is no money to find us a secure place outside of\nthe ghetto, they would not advise us or they don't want us to go back to the ghetto at this\npoint. Because they know things are going to happen there very soon and if we go back\nthere it will be the end. So they would be willing to help us somehow establish ourselves on\nthe Aryan side: meaning that we have no money to go into somebody's home, pay for being\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nkept but that somehow I will have to find my way, maybe with their help, to establish my\nexistence on the Aryan side; meaning that they helped me obtain a false identity. There were\npriests in churches that were selling birth certificates of somebody more or less the same\nage as I was of people that died and maybe their death wasn't registered properly. I could\nobtain a birth certificate of that person and therefore I would assume the identity of that\nperson, and if I would have a real birth certificate from a church, I could go to a German\noffice which issues -- there was a camp called the -------, it was like a passport and\neverybody had to have that -- and I can obtain, if I have enough guts I can obtain which I\nwould need to show them that I'm an Aryan. Which really I did. This what happened: they\nwere helping me to try to maintain my identity as an Aryan, and I went to this office and I\ngot my paper. So I became this Lieutenant Viyeska (ph) who actually was three or four\nyears older than I was but I had to assume her birth date; I was her. I had to completely\nunlearn, psychologically, of what happened of who I was. I had to be learning prayers, I had\nto be going to church, I had to mingle with Polish people, but my problem was that I had my\nfamily with me and I have to find a way for them to survive too. What happened was that --",
        "A: Because I didn't look Jewish, because I didn\u2019t speak -- at my home we spoke Polish. My\nPolish was very proper -- there's all kinds of Polish and they can detect and recognize you\nright away, the Poles -- my language was proper. I was a girl, they could not recognize me\nwhere my husband -- only Jewish males were circumcised in Europe, and immediately\nanybody, whether it was a little Pole that's 16 years old and wants your watch, or whether\nit's a German, if they take in the corner, you're being recognized immediately. And that's\nwhy men were so handicapped in hiding; it was much easier for women. Now, my brother\nwas also circumcised. Although he was very blond, with blue eyes, and he absolutely had no\nSemitic features but he was circumcised, and he could not play outside with little children\nbecause he had a very sad look on his face. He knew that he doesn't have a mother and\nfather and it was very difficult for him. Therefore, he had to be hiding, together with my\nhusband, in order to play safe with them. So I had to be able to secure a place for me to live\nand a way to bring groceries for more people than just myself without being detected. And\nbetween 1943 April until October '44 there was a lot of different circumstances and a lot of\nthings were going on on the Aryan side. By then of course they cleaned up the ghetto and\nthe ghetto was over with but it took a long time but the ghetto was burning, Warsaw was\ncompletely surrounded -- you know, it was cut off from the ghetto side. But I had a\nmultitude of problems, because first of all I had to find a place to live. I wasn't even thinking\nof going to work at that time, because work was scarce, and I was really scared, I mean, I\nstill was myself, with my past, and with all my sensitivities and everything that I -- you can't\njust switch yourself off, I wasn't a -----, I was a vulnerable young girl who all of a sudden\nhad all these problems to take care of and all these burdens. Well, at the beginning this\nengineer who was very, very nice helped me secure a tiny little apartment and there was\nanother lady who also wanted to live with me and we both rented a tiny apartment. In this\napartment we built a hiding place for her husband, my husband and my brother. There was a\nbig building. The neighbors were never supposed to know that there's more than two people\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nliving there, me and her, and we were supposed to go to work in the morning and come\nback at night. So these people had to be so quiet -- not flushing the toilet, not walking,\nbecause we were on the third floor and there was, you know, people living on the bottom\nand on top of us. And it was very, very difficult, it was touch and go all the time, and every\nday you hear that they found some Jews here and they found some Jews there, and there\nwere Jews in the neighborhood that didn't be discovered. There was very difficult. We\nmanaged for a little while. I had to go shopping to different stores so that I wouldn't bring\ntoo much food, you know. But that only was for a little while. After about six or seven\nmonths, the janitor -- they were always attuned to what was going on -- kind of went after\nme one day when I was shopping and he kind of understood that I'm buying more food than\nI should, and he denounced me. But we had certain things figured out at that time and my\nhusband built with his bare fingers a hiding place which was a bombed-out part of the\nbuilding where the bathroom was on the part of the ruins. So what they did is they put some\nboards there so from the outside it looked like ruins but from the inside it connected to our\nlittle apartment. And there was the side of the bathroom where they could sit there all day\nlong. And the entrance to the hiding place was very cleverly disguised: it was an entrance\nfrom the -- actually where the toilet is there was a wall and the wall had wooden blocks.\nNow, one of those big wooden panels would slide up and there would be the entrance. So at\nnight they would come out and sleep with us, but during the way they would go in there and\nfrom the bathroom you couldn't see anything because these panels were all the same all\naround. Anyway, they also figured out that in case I go some place and I get it trouble and\nthey make me come back to my apartment, they would have a way -- I would have a certain\nknock or talk very loud and they would have a way to break through the outside wall of that\nbathroom which went out on the ruins and they would all run and they would tell me where\nthey go -- we had a place where I could find them. And the inevitable happened. One\nmorning I went to the store and the janitor came up to me with two policemen, Polish\npolicemen, and they said, \"Well, we heard that you are hiding Jews\" -- the other lady was\nnot home then -- \"we know that there are Jews here and we know that you are hiding Jews\nand this is not right, we have to go in and take a look of what is going on there.\" I told them\nthat there is nobody there and I told them that I lost my key, I couldn't find it -- because I\ndidn't want to open up with the key, I really want to give them the signal, this knock where\nthey would know to run. I told them that I don't have the key. They were going to bring a\nlocksmith to break 1n the door and they did break in the door. By the time they broke in the\ndoor there was nobody there, they were gone; I mean they didn't even find the hiding place.\nThey just looked around the apartment and there was just nobody there. And we always\nkept it nice and tidy, just like two beds, just the two of us. But they were just very upset\nbecause they didn't find anything and they told me that they're going to come back at four\no'clock because they have to investigate and blah blah blah whatever they wanted to do.\nWell, they took my papers and that was the problem, because right away they ask you who\nyou are, and when you give them the papers then if they don't give them back to you, then\nyou're dead, you have no papers, that's terrible. Well, 1n the meantime I went to the place\nwhere they were and I told them what happened, and I said, \"Look\" -- it was only a\ntemporary place for the day or two -- and I said, \"Look, I don't know what to do now --\nshould I go back and face the music and get the papers back?\" And I felt strong enough that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nI really want to go and face up to them, because I really wanted my papers back. And what\nhappened was that I went back to the house -- of course I had everything in there -- and they\nnever came back. So they never came back and I never got my papers back. But the place\nwas no good any more, we could not return to the place. So we had to move out of there.\nAnd at this point, this other friend of mine, she had to go her own way and I had to go my\nown way.",
        "A: Because in my path of life I found some very nice Polish people who maybe did not adore\nJews but who from humane reasons felt compelled to help, who really could not live seeing\nall these atrocities that are being done and who felt that they maybe have to do a little bit to\nhelp the Jews. And I met actually three people like that in my path and they were very\nimportant people to me. This one fellow who kept us at the beginning and who said to us,\n\"Don't go back to the ghetto, I have no gain for you going back to the ghetto. I know you\ndidn't lie, and if you can support yourself and establish yourself on the Aryan side, then if I\ncan help you I will help you.\" He did help me secure this first apartment, you see, he did\nhelp me in giving me a little encouragement and showing me maybe how I can do it. So\nthere was the first thing. Then later on, when they took my papers and when I was\ncompletely lost and I was at a point where I just didn't know what to do with myself and the\nwar still was nowhere towards the end, I went to visit a friend of mine who was also hiding\nand there is a story to it, if I have a little time I will tell. While I had this apartment, the\ngentleman who helped me, he was helping other Jews getting established on the Aryan side,\nand if he had to bring three or four Jews, he couldn't keep them in his home, he would bring\nthem to my little apartment. Because I opened that -- I couldn't say, \"Listen, I can't take\nthem in.\" So I was helping him at that time, and at some point I could have had seven or\neight people in there. And that's where this janitor really got the idea that something's going\non. But once this was over with, they all had to go their own way. While I had this little\napartment I met a girl from down the street who was from my home town. She said, \"I need\na big favor of you: I need a place for my husband to sleep for two nights, he's going to the\nunderground and we don't have a place right now, so can he sleep by you for two nights?\" I\nsaid, \"Look, what's the difference if we sleep together on the floor? Let him come.\" He\ncame to my apartment and he left a winter coat, he forgot his winter coat. A few days letter I\nget a little letter from her telling me that he needs the coat and if I don't mind to bring the\ncoat to the place where she 1s at this moment. Well, on one Sunday I decided that I'm going\nto take the coat to her. That was a heavy winter coat on my arm and a purse and I got into\nthe streetcar. And they stole my purse. So that was on top of not having my papers, they\nstole my purse with my money and by the time I got to her house with the coat I was 1n very\ndesperate mood, I was ready to commit suicide. I said, \"Now I have nothing. I have a\nhusband that's sitting and waiting for me, I have a brother that is sitting and waiting for me\nthat I have to support, and now I don't even have a paper any more and I don't have any\nmoney and I don't know what I'm going to do with myself.\" And I came in there crying\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nterribly. And there was a man sitting there and he looked at me -- he was the one who would\nbe instrumental to take this man to a gentleman who would take my friend's husband to the\nunderground -- and he looks at me. He says, \"My God, what's the matter with you? You're\nso young, you can't be so desperate.\" I said, \"Look, right now I have no means of survival\nand I'm at the wall which I can't cross.\" And he said to me, \"You know you look very well,\nyou look like an Aryan, why don't you want to work a little?\" I said, \"Work? What can I\ndo?\" He said, \"I can get a job for you and I can help you out, so don't worry. If you need\nsome money, I'm going to hand you some money and if you want me to go with you to the\noffice where they give the documents\" -- because I lost my purse, my purse was stolen -- he\nsaid, \"I'm going to take you on Monday and I'm going to say that you are my cousin, and I'm\ngoing to tell them that they stole your purse on the so-and-so streetcar and they have to give\nyou a duplicate. As simple as that. And then you come to me and I will tell you what you're\ngoing to be doing for me.\" So that was my guardian angel. He actually met me that day, my\ngirl friend ------ took the coat and went to the underground. He met me and he took me to\nthe police station and he told them this story and I got a copy of my original passport. And\nthe next day he gave me an address, he told me where I should go and he told me that he is\nhiding about 20 Jews in his apartment and that these Jews have no means of supporting\nthemselves. He was a single man. I would say he was 1n the 40s. He was a past pilot in the\nPolish air force, he has been wounded many times, was not 1n the best of health. A great\nhumanitarian, who kept on saying, \"I don't like Jews but I have to help you.\" And these\npeople that were living in his apartment -- I don't know how they got to him but they needed\nsome means of survival and they knew how to manufacture -- I mean this 1s bizarre -- how\nto make certain things that could be sold on the black market and they couldn't get out to\nsell it. They were looking for somebody who could go out and sell this for them so that they\ncan survive. And that person was, he found me in this apartment. And I said, \"Well, I have\nto talk to my husband, I don't think that he would want me to walk around places like open-\nair markets and flea markets and sell stuff. He would probably be worried, you know, that\nthey recognize me.\" He said, \"You go and talk to him.\" Well, when I talked to my husband\nhe wasn't very much for it, but we really had no choice, we were three people that had to\nsurvive. I went to him every morning and he gave me a little suitcase. What these people\nwere manufacturing was hairnets. There was a great fashion at that time of heavy nets -- I\nthink in the 40s they had them here too -- they were all different colors and you were\nwearing them like down from your head to cover your hair and they were like brown and\ngray and all kinds of colors; heavy, knit, made by hand. And these Jews had a factory some\nplace before the War and they knew how to do it manually. And then they were also making\nelastics, they knew how to make elastics. They would cut the thread from the inner tubes by\nhand and then they would take some silk, dye the silk different colors and they would make\nround little elastic. When you buy a piece of round elastic that's what they were doing by\nhand, putting it on little cardboards and putting a label around it; and of course there was\nnothing like that because all the factories were closed. And they wanted to sell it and they\ncould manufacture a lot of it. So I got a little suitcase and they told me where to do. The\nplace I went was a flea market, the biggest one in Warsaw, where the worst element of\npeople were selling, I mean the lowest from the lowest, people that would not hesitate to\nchop you up in pieces if they would know who I was. But somehow, I don't know, I had the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncourage because I had to do it. I wasn't a hero, by no means, I did it for my own survival and\nI did it because I had no choice. And [laughing] I developed a very nice business. I was\nliked by the people, I got my own clients and own customers, and they were giving me\norders, they were selling, they were giving me orders for more. I would put my orders with\nthem and they would fill my orders and that was going on like that. And then one day this\nengineer said to me, \"You know, why don't we teach your husband,\" who was sitting and\ndoing nothing, \"why don't I take him over there and we'll train him and we'll teach him how\nto do it so he can do it too, rather than sitting at home.\" And what happened was that he\nactually learned how to do it, and I was selling our own merchandise and the merchandise\nof the other people, and that's how we all had a chance to survive. I have to mention that by\nthen I had another apartment. This apartment was not my own but through somebody I\nfound a lady who was willing to share her very small apartment with me but I had to pay her\nmore than more than usual -- this lady needed money, she was a widow, and she tried to\nsurvive; she was peddling a little bit merchandise here and there. And then she said that we\ncould have a bed in one of her rooms and that we could -- I would pay her, for instance, if\nnormally she would take 50 or 100 dollars from another Polish person, she took 800 from\nme. She really did it for the money but she was a person that had a lot of heart and\nunderstanding for me but she really needed the money, it meant surviving for her too. She\nhad to pay for the apartment and she had expenses. So at that point we lived with her. Of\ncourse my husband was still in hiding and nobody knew that he was there and he also made\na little hiding in the an ------- which I'm going to let him tell you about it. And we lived with\nthat lady.",
        "A: I was able to make enough money to pay her. I was able to make enough money for us to eat\nwell and I was also able to make enough money to save. Because when the Polish uprising\nin 1944 happened, of which part my mentor was very much involved with and he was one\nof the officers in the uprising, I did a saving that I tried to locate somehow. Now, what I\ndidn't mention that I lost my brother in 1942. It's a very painful thing to talk about. In July --\nwas it 1943? yes, in July he was sitting in that hiding with my husband, this other man, and\nhe really had a very, very poor life because he couldn't play -- you know, it's hard to confine\na nine-year-old to a poor little hiding place, also he was wonderful, he was so good. But I\nknew that this situation can't go on like this, he wasn't eating properly. At that time I didn't\nwork yet, which was in the old apartment, and one day I found out that there is such a thing\nas a hotel. I don't know how much information there is in the Holocaust Museum about this\nparticular thing that I'm going to talk about but I would like to know because I can tell about\nit. It was a scheme from the Germans, it was called Hotel Polski that was was an old fancy\nhotel in Warsaw, and what the Germans did, they spread rumors that they're going to send\npeople to Switzerland and that these Jews were going to be exchanged for German prisoners\nof war with Russia, and they were looking for Jews to come to this hotel and they will\ntransport these Jews to Switzerland. Actually they took one transport and sent them there.\nAnd now the people thought that this is a legitimate thing and everybody that was in hiding\n-- because you see the Jews that were hiding in Warsaw and paying all this money for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhiding eventually the money goes out, eventually these people get more tired and tired of\nkeeping the Jews, eventually there is more people that 1s being discovered. It's a very\nvulnerable situation. These Jews had no assurance that they're going to survive and the\nmatter of fact everybody that we know and the family ------------, everybody is there. Sooner\nor later somehow from many apartments and from many hiding places these people were\nfound and kept. So, when the rumor was spread that there is such a thing as this hotel,\npeople jumped at it and it was very hard to get in. Matter of fact, the Germans even had a\nway to take money from these Jews, so that it was really kept up beautiful and the people\nthat was supposed to leave in two weeks were living there already. I met the girl who was\nfrom my home town, whom I knew very well and she used to be a neighbor of ours and I\nwent to school with her younger brother. Because when she saw me, she said, \"Oh my God,\nwhat are you doing here?\" And she was dressed beautiful, she was a beautiful woman. I\nsaid, \"Well, we're in hiding and I can't get into the transports and I don't know what to do.\"\nShe said, \"Oh my God, I'll be happy to help you.\" It turned out that she was the mistress of\nthe man who was arranging all these transports and she told me, \"You know, I can help you.\nIf you want to send your brother with me, I promise you that I'm going to take care of him. I\nremember my little brother and I remember he was in school with you and if you want to\nsend him with me, I'll take care of him\" She said, \"Were going to Switzerland, I'm going out\ntomorrow to buy a wardrobe -- I need some very fancy clothes, and I know all these people\nhere and I know there's a group of students going. And if you want me to, I'll take care of\nhim.\" She was crying, she says, \"I lost my family, I lost my brother, and I promise you that\nI'm going to take care of him.\" She did not know the truth of what's going to happen. Now,\nthat was something I couldn't refuse, I came home and we talked about. And I said to my\nhusband, \"Look, we can't go, here there's still a long time to the end of the war, who knows\nwhat's going to happen? People are paying thousands of dollars in foreign currency to get in.\nI met people, I talked to people that were actually getting out of hiding, paying in money to\ngo; and they believed in it.\" Who was I to think that it's not so? I was only sorry that we\ncouldn't go. And we talked it over, I went and I bought a suitcase and I bought some clothes\nfor him. We were supposed to meet on a certain day and I was supposed to take him there.\nAnd the morning when the transport was leaving -- incidentally, one of my relatives, my\naunt, and her little girl also was there, and also ------ with this transport because she knew\nsomebody who was arranging for it. And that's what it happened, it was in July '43 that I lost\nhim. I took him there in the morning, and I saw her leave with him in a taxi, I said goodbye\nto him, I said goodbye to her, she promised me she's going to take care of him, she was\nsincere about it. I saw all the people go in trucks to the ------- wherever they were going to\nthe train station, we said goodbye, he told me he's going to write to me, and that was the end\nI knew. Later, through the Polish underground paper it was mentioned that they took all the\npeople from this transport and they took them to a concentration camp in Hanover, where\nthey didn't survive. And also, the rest of the people that lived there and waited for the next\ntransport were also taken away. So, my brother would have been now 60 years old. So that's\nhow I lost him, and there were just the two of us from then. So at the time where I found\nthis man who gave me a job, and when I was working and having the money and being able\nto support myself, there was just the two of us. So that what was going on more or less. I\nwas working, and my husband was making whatever he could, and I was selling, and we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwere living quietly because nobody knew about his existence. And I lived with that lady.\nWe had a few close encounters, for instance, her drunken cousin wanted to come and sleep\nover one night and my husband had to go in hiding and the hiding was an oven, he passed\nout in there, it was just terrible; I think that maybe he will throw more details on this\nparticular situation. And that's how we lived, quietly, incognito, till about shortly 1944. I\nhave to tell you that this engineer, whose name is Selek -----sky (ph), he has been honored\nwith a gold medal from the Israeli Government and his is the first place in the Valley of the\nRighteous that these people established, because most of those people survived the Warsaw\nuprising, not the ghetto uprising, the other uprising, he got them all out ------. And there\nwere rumors that he was killed I read, but then he did survive. He really was honored by the\nJews who are living now in Israel and by the State of Israel. He also had a few close\nencounters. For instance, there was a woman that was in his apartment that was ready to\ndeliver a baby and he did not know about it, she was apparently camouflaging it. And in the\nlast minute when she ----- the baby, he had to call a doctor whom he had to pay dearly and\nthey didn't have the money, so he ran over to our apartment in the morning screaming, \"I\nneed 3000 zlotys immediately, this woman is having a baby in my place.\" So we gave it to\nhim and she did have the baby, and apparently they put it right up to the orphanage; but I\nunderstand that she survived and they got the baby back. So I was not in fact with these\npeople after the war but I know that most of them survived and live in Israel. It wasn't until\n1944 when he came over one day to us -- he was coming quite often to us because he was\nlonely; and he was telling us that there's going to be an uprising, a Polish uprising, in\nOctober 1944, that the Polish people are beginning an uprising because the Russians are\ncoming closer, and the Russian front is now on the Vistula River which was dividing\nWarsaw into two parts: there was Warsaw on one side of the Vistula and on the other side\nof the Vistula, and what was happening that the Russian army was advancing up to the\nVistula and there were rumors that they're going to stop. In the meantime the Polish\nGovernment in exile in London decided that there's going to be a Polish uprising, that the\nPolish people will try to save Warsaw from being occupied by the Russians and they're\ngoing to liberate Warsaw themselves. So these were these people, who were organized who\nhad munitions, but they were against a German army with planes with all kinds of bombs,\nand they tried to stake an uprising. And he told us about it. He said, \"I want to warn you that\nthere's going to be an uprising and things are going to be tough. I want you to prepare food,\nand if you have any money, money's going to be no good. So I want you to go and do\nsomething with it.\" I said, \"What would I do with the money I have?\" He said, \"Why don't\nyou go to a store and buy some rings.\" So here I went to a store and ended up with eleven\nwedding bands and that was my treasure. So of course the uprising was terrible. We were\nboth severely wounded. The second week of the uprising took about four weeks. 350,000\npeople in Warsaw were killed. Three-quarters of Warsaw was destroyed; that's why Warsaw\nis all rebuilt now because three-quarters of it was destroyed by the Germans because of the\nuprising. They were coming in systematically and bombing all the streets because they\nknew there's this new cry of underground here; and the Polish underground killed a number\nof Germans, but still 1t was no comparison of what the Germans had done and the Germans\ncould do. So it was terrible, it was a very, very terrible time. At night my husband used to go\nto work and help them save some grain from burning mills because the population was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nstarving and the Germans were having a feast, you know. Some of them were being killed\nbut still they had a hold on the situation. We had to go from one place to another, because\nthe place where I lived with this lady they were bombing every day and at one point we\nwent to the cellar, to the basement, and we saw some other Jews creep out from another\napartment there. But at that point we were all in the same boat, the Poles and the Jews, so at\nthat point nobody really had time to care who was sitting in the bunkers, who was sitting in\nthe cellar. And that was going on for two or three weeks until one day our building was\ndestroyed and that's where I was buried in debris completely. My husband just pulled me\nout by a leg and I sustained permanent injury to my ear, and my husband was also injured at\nthe same time and we had to move to another place still Warsaw, and we waited until in\nOctober 1944 the uprising was completely over, it was suppressed, and the Germans\ndecided to evacuate the whole town because the frontier was on the Vistula River. The\nRussians waited patiently while the Poles and the Germans were killing each other -- they\nwere in no hurry at that point, they knew they've got the situation covered and they can\ncome in any time. So they suspended, you know, the quest for maybe three or four months.\nThey sat on the other part of the River, and mind you, the Jews that were fighting in that\npart of Warsaw were already liberated and some people were trying on the Vistula, under\nthe bridges, to swim through in order to be liberated; and here we knew that within seven or\neight kilometres from where we were these people were already free and we still had the\nGermans, and God knows what's going to happen to us. So it was really a terrible situation\nbecause at that time half of Poland was already taken by the Russians. The provisional\ngovernment of Poland was established in 1944 in our home town, in Lublin, and we were\nstill heavy under the Germans, dying every day. When the Germans decided to evacuate all\nWarsaw, we had no choice but to leave, and at that point we didn't know where they're\ngoing to take us and what's going to happen to us. We knew that the war is going to end\nsoon because ---------- artillery and we knew it's a matter of months but we were still under\nthe Germans and we had no choice but to go with them whatever they're going to take us.\nSo that's what happened: we were evacuated from Warsaw, everybody had to leave, all the\nPoles, the city was empty. But there was an aura of thinking that whoever is from Warsaw 1s\nsomehow connected to the uprising, you see. The Poles all over the Polish territory thought\nthat we were all from the uprising, that we were all from the underground, and especially\nbeing wounded and being hurt, they didn't really think there would be some Jews among us,\nyou know. So at that point we somehow managed, and my husband too, to get through with\nthem. Also, at that time we were all taken to a camp which was not a concentration camp, it\nwas called Krushkupf (ph), it was near Warsaw, and that was a gigantic camp and that's\nwhere all the population of Warsaw was taken. And from there they were doing selections:\nthe young people that were healthy were taken to Germany to work for factories, the old\npeople we didn't know what they're going to do with them but this was the petrifying\nmoment of my life, because we were never separate, we always managed to be together; you\nknow, like families, and husband and wife, were separated. Up on this point we always\nmanaged to be together. Now, at this point we were kind Hof scared because I was afraid\nthat if they take him to work to Germany, we will have to go to a doctor to see if he's\nhealthy and then they're going to find out who he was. So we were really in a limbo. And\nthen we were walking into the camps not knowing really what's going to happen. While we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwere walking in the camp, there were nuns there -- I don't know what they were doing, I\ndon't know if they were helping to evacuate the Poles, and one of the nuns walked up to us\nand said, \"Why don't you go the right? It's ----- the wife to go to the right. Go to the right,\ndon't ask any questions, go to the barrack named C.\" And you know, we didn't know if we\nshould or not, but we did. Once we got to this barrack, it turned out this was barrack of sick\npeople and when we walked in there they told us, \"Oh you're not sick enough. We've got\nsome paint, we're going to make you bleed all over, we're going to put bandages on your\nhead, we're going to put bandages on your knee, we're going to make you look real sick.\" So\nhere we're sitting in this barrack, which was just terrible with a latrine for a bathroom and\nwith gigantic-size lice on the mats. And this was just only a transit camp and we're asking\nthe people, \"What's going on here?\" There were maybe 400 or 500 people there. Said, \"We\ndon't know, this is supposed to be sick barracks, either they're going to send us some place\nto get better or they're going to take us some place and kill us because they don't need us.\"\nSo that's where we saw. We sat there overnight, and then in the morning they took us on\ntrains, the whole barracks, and they took us towards western Poland. There was no patrol on\nthe trains, there was no guards on the trains, and we really didn't know, we were very\ndisoriented, it was like cattle train, we were 40, 50 people in a train. But every time they\nstop, you could really go down; but where we going to go? We were afraid we're going to a\nlittle village or a little town and soon enough they're going to find who we were. So we\ndidn't care any more. Some people were getting off the train -- they were all Poles, mind you\n-- some people were staying in the train. Somehow we decided to go to the end and see\nwhat's going to happen to us. We didn't know. And in about, I don't know, a day and a half\nor so, we arrived at the little town near Krakow and we found out that what they're going to\ndo with all of us is to put us with peasants -- each peasant of t his area will have to take a\nWarsaw family and keep them there in the fields. So we ended up in a very small little\ntown, with some quite poor peasants who took us in thinking that we are Warsaw\nunderground fighters, and because we really were wounded -- and my husband developed\nhepatitis here -- they really thought that we are legit and it didn't come to their minds to\nthink that we are Jews. So this is October 1944. We stayed with these peasants. Some of\nthem were kind, some of them weren't, but if they weren't kind it wasn't because they were\nJews, they got once kind because they had to share with other people whatever they had but\nsome of them were very kind. It was bitter cold winter, they made me a little fur coat from\nrabbits hair. They were very poor peasant and we had to work for them and do everything in\nthe kitchen and with the animals and with the pigs and whatever had to be done, you know,\nwith the well, with the water; very primitive. They put up four chairs and a sack for us to\nsleep at night. In the daytime we needed the room because everything was in one room and\na lot of children there. But somehow we managed to get their confidence. I had to go to\nchurch every Sunday, and at Christmas it was very difficult because the Polish people had a\nceremonial Christmas Eve and we were invited to this [she laughs] to a very important\nperson there, you know, for Christmas dinner and I had to pretend that I am really very sick\nand cannot make it at the last minute. So 1t was touch and go, and because there was no\nschool for the children, my husband established a school, for which the peasants were very\ngrateful. And somehow they kept us there and we stayed. It doesn't mean that there wasn't\nrumors every day when they found a family some place in the woods, hiding, and that they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nchopped them up to death. This was just like daily news. But somehow we survived this\nordeal too. In the beginning of January, when the frontier was coming closer, we were\nliberated by the Russians, and that was the greatest that could ever happen to us -- to see the\nfirst Russian soldier come into the village was just like seeing Messiah. We still had to\npretend that we're not so happy, because the Polish people did not like the idea that the\nRussians are coming, and the anti-Communists especially, they did not want Russia to take\nover Poland and we had to kind of be very diplomatic about it and, you know, really keep it\ncool and now to show it how happy we are that the Russians came in. And as the Russians\nwere coming in, we saw Germans beheaded, we saw a truck full of Germans with no heads,\nI mean they were really getting it from the Katyusha and from the artillery of the Russians\ncoming in. And we slowly had to convince the Russians that we are Jews, they didn't\nbelieve us; because we needed certain permits to go back home, things were very difficult at\nthat time you know -- people could not just move around, the Russians were still advancing,\nit was still January 1945, the war wasn't over till actually May. But we wanted to go home,\nwe didn't want to stay there. My husband had a very close encounter with a Russian who\ntold him, \"I don't think you're a Jew, I think you're a spy, there's no more Jews here, we\nknow that Hitler killed them all.\" And my husband says to him, \"Listen, is there any\nRussian soldier here that maybe knows Yiddish? I know a little Yiddish.\" So they found a\nlittle guy and this guy came over and says, in Russian -- my husband speaks some Russian -\n- \"You think you're a Jew?\" So: tell me a Jewish prayer.\" And he said, \"Geshmah\" (ph).\nAnd you know what? They started to kiss and embrace. And that's how slowly we told the\npeasants that we have to go back home -- to Warsaw, we didn't tell them anything else, we\nwant to see what's going on there. And we said goodbye to them. And mostly on foot we\nstarted our migration back home to our home town. Of course we didn't find anybody there.\nLater on we went back to this town and we took some clothes and things for the children,\nyou know. ---------------[proper mames] never found out who we were. Now, my husband\ndeveloped hepatitis and we didn't want him to go to the doctor --",
        "A: OK.\nEnd of Tape #2\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nTape #3",
        "A: Okay, I would like to just mention briefly an incident that while we lived with these\npeasants, my husband became gravely ill and he developed hepatitis. He was really in very\nbad shape and almost dying, and he refused to go to a doctor, because he was afraid that\nbeing examined, the doctor is going to find out who he was. But he was already so ill that\nthe peasants would absolutely don't take no for an answer, and we had to go 13 kilometers\nin the winter in the snow to get to this place where there was a doctor, where they were very\nhelpful, because they wanted my husband to live. They dressed him up very warm and they\ntook a couple of horses and a buggy, and then we went to this doctor. As we walked into the\ndoctor's office, my husband noticed that he had a little plague there which said that he was a\nrailroad doctor in Warsaw. My husband walked into him and he says, \"Oh, you're doctor so-\nand-so. I remember you from Warsaw. I used to be on the railroad too.\" They shook hands\nand they became friends right away, and actually when he needed a shot, he had the nurse\njust do it for him, and he did not really examine him. So there was a little close encounter\nwhich I wanted to mention. Well, to make my story a little more concise, we went back to\nour hometown. There was some Jews coming back from Russia and some Jews coming\nback from Polish, from camps and Germany, but unfortunately we found out that there was\nnobody. My husband found some uncles there, and he will tell about that. We did not want\nto stay in Poland too long. I felt that every stone had blood on it, and every wall had\nmemories for me. I never went back to the place where my parents lived. I went back to the\nlady who send the Gestapo for me, and I really wanted, went to the police to talk to them\nabout it, and to see if she can be reprimanded. But they told me there was no witnesses, so\nwe just let it go. Only God was my witness at that time, but it ended up well for me, so I'm\nalive. We went to live in a different town, because my husband wanted to go back to the\nuniversity. He had too his medical school behind him. So we found out that in Breslau,\nwhich became a Polish town, Broslof (ph), there is a medical school and that his professors\nfrom the previous school will be there. He had no documents and no papers. He was\naccepted to medical school for the third year and we spend a year there. That we also\nbelonged to Acubootz (ph) there, that was Acubootz (ph) of students. And after he\ncompleted the third year and he could secure papers, we decided to go into the world. We\nabsolutely didn't want to live in Poland. The memories were just too terrible, and there was\nan opportunity to leave into the unknown. We just took a knapsack and went to the border\nto Czechoslovakia and then into Austria. We were aided by the Breha (ph), by the Israeli\nofficials who were helping Jews get out of Poland at that time, and we just went into the\nworld. We were fortunate to come to Vienna, and in Vienna my husband was able to\ncontinue medical school at that time, and we became a part of a group of 400 Jewish\nstudents who came from all over to Vienna, and who were able to study in Vienna. The\nreason that the university was lenient to those people is because Vienna was occupied by all\nfour, and the Americans made sure that Jewish students were not only accepted at the\nuniversity, but they also paid very, very low tuition. Well, anti-Semitism was great, and the\nGerman professors were not that happy to promote Jewish students, but people still studied\nthere and my husband was able to get his medical diploma there in Vienna. We stayed there\nfor four years. I was working a little bit, and I decided to also to go to the university. After I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas at the university for two years, he was ready with his medical school, and we couldn't\nwait to get out, because we secured some papers to the United States from a distant family\nthat I found and who were very gracious to send us papers, but they told us not to come\nbefore my husband is ready with his studies. So four years later, on October 1950, we were\nbrought into the United States, and from then on we felt free, we felt happy. We were young\nenough to want to start a new life. We were young enough to try to cut off the past as much\nas we could. We decided that this is our country, we are going to live here, there's not going\nback, there's no complaining we have to become American citizens. We have to take the\nopportunity that this country has given us. My husband has a good profession. I felt that I\ndidn't finish my studies, so when the children grew up a little bit, I went back to get my\ndegree. We were fortunate to have things fall into place for us. We lived in Rochester, New\nYork, where my husband was interning, then we lived in Buffalo, New York for a short\nwhile, and then we came into Chicago where we build our life practically from scratch. But\nwe were fortunate that we were able to do so. We have a great family. Our nuclear family\nwas two, then it became four, and now we are 11. So we did a good job, a very close-knit\nfamily, our family is now substituting for the family we lost. We are very fortunate to have\ngreat children. They are married, three granddaughters. And I feel that we build our lives\nand we were able to project to the children a normal set of values, not trying to burden them\nwith our past. However, they have to know. They were maybe always more sensitive to us\nbecause they knew that that's all we have is them. They are very attentive. And except for\nthe bad memories, I don't think that I have much of a stigma of really what happened now,\nbecause I still was 18 and 20 years old when I came to this country. I think that when you're\nolder and when you have more of the past on you, like previous marriages and children that\nyou lost, it's much harder to adjust in your life. But I must say that I adjusted to the life here\nvery well, and embraced life for whatever it could offer me. Tried to compensate for lost\ntime and my lost youth, and grateful to God that it all happened that way.",
        "A: Well, living Azonarian (ph) actually didn't do anything for me, because the way I was\nbrought up, I always knew who I was. My family was not religious. My father was the\nfounder of a Zionist youth movement in my hometown. I always knew who I was. I always\nhad holidays. I went to a Jewish high school where Hebrew was taught everyday. I was\namong Jewish people, Jewish friends, and I always knew who I was. I could have never lost\nmy identity, and I was fortunate to marry somebody of my own faith. Now, just to give you\nan example, I had friends, who at my age, 14, 15, were also in the same situation that I was.\nBut they somehow found Polish mates, who maybe at that time were helping them to hide.\nThey never went back to Judaism or went back to being Jewish, and I cannot, I'm not the\njudge for them. I cannot blame them for that. But this is what happened to many people.\nThis is what happened to a lot of males who married Gentile women, who were helping\nthem and stayed in Europe and Poland, and are raising Gentile families. That happens to\nwomen that encountered the same thing. Some broke off and some stayed at the same. So I\nwas just fortunate always to know who I was, and to be able to share my life with a person\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwho was of my own faith, and therefore it was never any question for me to be anything else\nbut a Jew, because my parents instilled that in me, and because there was just not a way for\nme. It was just that everything else was just done out of need. If I had to go to church, it\nmeant nothing to me. If I had to be arrogant, it meant nothing to me. To me it was only a\nmeans of survival, and I was fortunate enough not to have to continue this falsehood and get\nback to myself to be whoever I am.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, this is very unfortunate, because I lived Azonarian through the two years during the\nwar, and also for a certain time when we were liberated, I did not want to go back to my\nJewish name until I left Poland, for cowardly reasons, I did not trust them. There were\nprograms after the war in Kielce, there were programs all over. There was a lot of hatred,\nand I didn't want to survive the war and then something happen to me. For instance, I\nalways telling my husband that if we live in Europe and I have a child and it's going to be\nmale, I would never circumcise that child, because of my brother, who I think I lost because\nof that. I had certain feelings and certain stigma. After the war, I encountered a lot of anti-\nSemitism, I mean sayings like, for instance, \"Oh, look at this Jew on the bus again. Hitler\ndidn't kill them all. Here they're getting out of Russia. Here we have them again. We\nthought that Poland is going to be without Jews.\" So, I couldn't help but hearing all that, and\nthat just made me feel very bad. I could not say anything, because I still did not want\nanybody to know that I was Jewish up until we left, and then, of course, my husband came\nback to his own name, because he had to have false papers too, just in case they catch him.\nAnd then, of course, as soon as we came to Vienna and we became students we decided that\nwe absolutely want our name back and we wanted to be who we were. And that's why, you\nknow, everything went back to our name. Our kept my first name because it was so hard for\nme. I was so attuned to it already, and there was just me, you know, between the age of 16\nor 17. I was just so used to it already, that I modified it a little bit and kept my Hebrew name\nas a middle name, and just stayed with that name. But it's very unfortunate that I have to say\nthat, but this is the very truth.",
        "A: Well, I feel that probably this interview will be completed was bad. If I omitted things, it's\nbecause it's very hard to concise six years of tortures and trouble into a small amount of\ntime. I tried to be as exact as I could, and my memory still serves me so that I can remember\nevents more or less, dates and at that point I think I was quite precise in telling the story the\nway it really was. I'm grateful to have this opportunity to say it, and to put it on tape for\nposterity. I always think of my grandchildren being able to press a button and see their\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngrandparents tell the story. I feel that there's a great need of these things to be known,\nbecause of certain people that deny the Holocaust. I am very grateful that I had this\nopportunity to do so, and I hope it will never happen again, America will never have to face\nup to anything so horrible that the Holocaust was. And I thank you very much.",
