        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D.\nSchiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in Forest Hills, New York. This is tape\nnumber one, side A. Mrs. Schiff, would you please tell me your name at birth, and when and\nwhere you were born?",
        "Answer: My name is Gabriele D. Schiff. I was born in Hamburg, Germany, on October fifth,\n1914.",
        "Q: Could you tell me briefly about your family, and about your home life in Hamburg?",
        "A: I was born to a physician and his wife. We had a very assimilated home life. I was the\nyoungest of four children. I went to high school, as far as I could get in Germany. It was all\nunder the Whymar Republic, which of course, 1933, was taken over by Hitler, and my schooling,\nat least my formal schooling, came to an end. And at that time, one had to think slowly, about\npreparation for leaving Germany. I was about 16 at the time, and it was a very difficult Germany,\nand the most uneasy time for Jews, but an e -- uneasy time for Germany, all around. Vesters,\nstrikes, and on the whole, you are looking how to create a future. My first job, as I always\nwanted to be a social worker, from my seventh year on, I became a secretary in a Jewish girl\u2019s\norphanage. And at that time, it became clear that the girls who had no German passports, mostly\nof them Polish orphans, would be sent back to Poland. It was partly my job to help prepare the\nchildren for a life that we really couldn\u2019t foresee, but it certainly meant separation, separation\nfrom the place they knew, as well as if they had relatives, separation from relatives, into the\nunknown. I have done that about a year, and then decided to better learn England, prepare --\nEnglish -- to prepare for eventual immigration. I went to England, and tried to learn shorthand\nand typing. I never did very well. I worked in household, but then a letter came from a colleague\nin Hamburg, telling me that there were still so many children that could possibly go out --\ncorrection, not so many, but some. And I decided, against anybody\u2019s advice, to go back to\nGermany. And I stayed in Germany for about a year, and again, helped children, also worked for\nthe German Jewish community. It\u2019s interesting that even though we had very assimilated, from\nthe very beginning, my 50 year career in social work, was almost all in Jewish social work. I\nprepared for my immigration, which was very difficult for many reasons, which perhaps we\ndon\u2019t have to go into. The secret police at one time got hold of me, which was not a pleasant\nexperience. They took my passport away, and eventually I got out of Germany, because one of\nmy English friends, a former boyfriend, wrote me a fake letter that he was going to marry me,\nand I would become an English citizen, and set a date for our marriage. And at that point, I got\nmy passport back, and left in a hurry. Again, I stayed in England for a very short time. I didn\u2019t\nwork. By that time my mother and my oldest brother had immigrated to England, and so it was a\nbit of a family reunion. It\u2019s all not [indecipherable] clear in my memory, but somewhat like it.\nAnd my brother from America, where I als -- also had a brother, came. He was a lawyer here,\nworking for the office of Price Administration, he must have been the levelator. Anyhow, he\npicked me up, and we came together to America. And it was a little funny story when I arrived\nhere. People who thought I\u2019d gone into the wilderness in America, my aunts, etcetera, had given\nme, of all things, tea kettles. So when I arrived here, and the customs opened my stuff, I was\nsurrounded by the tea kettles, and the customs official looked at me and said, \u201cGolly, what do\nyou want to do? Trade with the Indians?\u201d That\u2019s the beginning of America.",
        "Q: When did you arrive to the U.S.?",
        "A: In 1937, in September.",
        "Q: So, just briefly maybe, we\u2019ll turn back to your years in Hamburg, and could you tell me a\nlittle bit more? Was your family observant of religious holidays?",
        "A: No, we were very assimilated. Yes, proforma -- it\u2019s a harsh word, but we did observe Rosh\nHashanah and Yom Kippur. Actually, I still do it, even though my life had gone up and down in\nbetween. And we were an upper class, very well known family. And what you did was always\nbeing looked at by others. But, I should mention my mother -- and I\u2019ve inherited that from her,\nliked to help people, and she always volunteered. And she had what she called office hours in\nour house, and she would counsel people. And as a child of seven, I was sitting under the table,\nlistening to these stories, and that\u2019s why I decided I wanted to help. And another -- and that\u2019s the\nlast story of my past, we had a big house, and I had a governess, as ever -- anybody had to, had a\nlittle money in Germany. And I was always afraid when the governess had the day out, and I was\nalone in the big house. So my father, to comfort me one day, bought me a big, chocolate teddy\nbear, and said that, \u201cHe\u2019Il keep you company.\u201d I didn\u2019t want chocolate bear, I wanted somebody\nto talk to. So I cried. So my father, who was a little impatient, said, \u201cWell, you are but spoiled.\nThere are many poor children who have no teddy bears.\u201d I said nothing, and I thought. Day\nbefore, we had taken a walk, and my governess had said, \u201cLet\u2019s walk slowly here,\u201d no,\ncorrection again, \u201c\u2018let\u2019s walk fast, because this is where the poor children live.\u201d So, I thought,\nteddy bear, poor children. So during afternoon, I ran around, back to that neighborhood with my\nchocolate bear, and when I saw a little girl that looked poor to me, pressed the chocolate teddy\nbear into her arms. Once later, my mother was playing bridge, and one of her partners said, \u201cOur\nneighborhood is changing, because an absolutely strange girl walked up to my little daughter,\nand gave her a teddy bear.\u201d And I always say, \u201cI have spent my life giving teddy bears to the\nwrong people.\u201d",
        "Q: You said that your family was a total of seven children?",
        "A: Four. Four children.",
        "Q: Oh, I thought you said that you were one of seven.",
        "A: No. One of four.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: The youngest.",
        "Q: And briefly, would you tell me what happened to your family members, your immediate\nfamily members through the war years?",
        "A: Yeah, we were very lucky, we all got out of Germany, but not together. We have never been\ntogether again as a family. My mother left a little later than I did, to England, which she lived --\nlet\u2019s see, she left after Crystal night, and only got out because my Dutch brother-in-law came\nfrom Paris to take her out with the help of the Dutch consulate. He came, and he was politically\nquite on the left, and had brought quite a few fake Dutch passports, and got out two or three well\nknown writers, who were in concentration camp. One of them, Eric Musam, some people may be\ninterested him, he was later killed, but he got him out. So [indecipherable].",
        "Q: And did you have any encounters with anti-Semitism when you were growing up in\nGermany?",
        "A: Who hasn\u2019t? Yes, and I only gi -- I had all -- I -- I had, as everybody else did, I remember\nwell my first encounter, when I was, well, maybe 12. I had a girlfriend, very blonde, and very\nAryan, and her father was an architect, and we were quote, best friends, end quote. And from one\nday to another, she said, with tears in her eyes, \u201cMy father forbade me to play with you any\nlonger, because you are Jewish, and he belongs to a certain German organization, and would be a\ndanger for him if his daughter is running around with a Jewish girl.\u201d That was my very first --\nand, I had to give you all these things you get from everybody, because of course, you met it\neverywhere, from your greengrocer -- and you met the other, too, people who stood up for you,\nand perhaps a most outstanding one was we had a super in our house, and he denounced my\nmother to the Secret Police, and denounced me, too, because I had a non-Jewish boyfriend,\nwhich was against the Nuremberg laws. So, I mean, we had our share of this, but compared what\nlater on happened in eastern Europe, it\u2019s all chicken feed. No [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay. I think we can perhaps move on then, to your early years in America, and what you did\nwhen you first arrived. Any striking first impressions that you had, and that you\u2019d like to\nrecount?",
        "A: Cause New York is overwhelming if you come from Germany, and my family -- I had an aunt\nhere, who was very well-to-do, and was very nice to me, but I didn't fit into that type of society\nat all. I looked European, English was bad, politically I was too much interested in Social\nDemocrats. They were very nice to me, but I didn\u2019t want to play the role of a poor relative, that\u2019s\njust not in me. And I had a Quaker friend in Philadelphia, who was a teacher of music. And we\nhad been through a lot in Hamburg together, we had gone to school together. So I phoned her,\nand said, \u201cEtta, please get me a job, any job.\u201d And she came through. And I lived in the house of\na lovely Quaker family, where my friend Etta also had a room. And I did a little a-around the\nhouse. I\u2019m really not very well trained in that respect, but they were very good pe -- were\nactually lovely people. I took a little bit care of children. And money I didn\u2019t have. Furs I had,\nbut no money. And the man of the house, who was a lawyer, professor of law, discovered that I\nhave a usable brain. And he thought to get anywhere in this country, I would have to study, and\nget at least a Bachelor. And he gave me a chance just try for a scholarship in a very good\nAmerican college in Swarthmore, which has helped me for the rest of my life. And they again\nwere very nice, because they believed me. I had my examination for the university in Germany,\nwhich I didn\u2019t have, but I said I had lost it. And I could make up for it in an examination, I\npassed with very good grades, and so I got through Swarthmore in two years. That, of course,\nwas a big help, because then, during those two years, I used my furniture, rented an apartment\nwith borrowed money, and sublet rooms to other students. And that way, I got through college. I\njust missed feeb -- Phi Beta Kappa, which I\u2019m really angry about, because I had the cooking to\ndo for -- and I had it easy because I majored in English, which was not in English literature, but I\nminored in German, so it meant I could concentrate on my major. And later on, I took\npsychology.",
        "Q: So when you were in school, you were also focused to some extent on social work again?",
        "A: Never left my mind. I did not tell you that before I even mentioned Swarthmore, I had gone to\nthe Pennsylvania School of Social Work, who had told me I could not study social work if I\nwouldn\u2019t have an America Bachelor. It was very different times, and that was one reason why I\nwas so glad to go to Swarthmore. And the day I had my Bachelor, I went back to the University\nof Pennsylvania, I say, \u201cHere I am, please let me in.\u201d They were very psychologically oriented at\nthat time, and they seriously said to me, \u201cWell, you know, you will have to work with people\nwho know pain, and suffering. And to know that, you have to know it yourself. Did you ever\nhave any suffering and pain?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, I just left my family in Europe, I make a very\nprecarious living here. I\u2019ve met many good things, but I\u2019ve also met [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you have much fear in you when you arrived in the United States? Do you recall having\nthat kind of emotion?",
        "A: I recall having a lot of anxiety. Not so much fear, which is very much related. I didn\u2019t think I\nwould not get through, that never occurred to me. But I didn\u2019t know how.",
        "Q: And what did you continue to hear about developments in Germany and Europe during this\npart of your schooling, and your early years in the U.S.?",
        "A: To be honest, I was so concentrating on daily life, that it was not very real to me. I knew what\nwas going on in Germany. I was dead sure, if I\u2019d ever become a citizen, I would go and try to\nhelp rebuild. I felt guilty. I was safe, and my friends were not. I was in close contact with the\nQuakers, who were the only organization, I believe, who could, at that time, get into Germany,\neven could -- and get into the camps. And they, at that time, were starting their so-called refugee\nsection, and they ask me to work in it, and to set it up. And so I knew particularly about\nGermany, that people had lost their jobs, difficulties in getting out, were taken to camps, but if\nI\u2019m very honest, for instance, Crystal night is not in my memory as the overwhelming experience\nit was, becu -- I think like, human beings, and young ones, you think about studying, about your\nboyfriends, about whatever the day brings. Yes, it\u2019s all going on in Germany, and you also -- at\nleast I was, a little bit cruel, and you thought, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t these people get out?\u201d Later on, I\n[indecipherable] they couldn\u2019t, but I was somewhat mixed up in my thinking. It came back more\nand more when I -- at the refugee section, as my daily bread, and had to write and answer letters\nfrom Germany, people pleading for so-called affidavits. And while I was working with Quakers,\nI was sent to get affidavits, and I was, of all things, going to Iowa. Now, imagine this German\nJewish girl, with fairly good English, but still not -- still the the English English. I was sent to\nfarmers, who in their turn had rarely heard of Jews. So we had a great time not -- of learning\neach other. They showed me their farm, and they showed me everything they a -- and they talk\nwith thee and thou, as the Quakers does. And whatever they showed me, I\u2019d never seen before.\nAnd the very nice old farmer got a little impatient, and showed me a cow, and said, \u201cDid thee\never see a cow?\u201d",
        "Q: So when were you in Iowa, and what exactly were you trying to accomplish while you were\nthere?",
        "A: The latter I can answer first one. Probably in \u00b038 - \u201939. It\u2019s vague, but I think so, because \u201939,\nI went to college, so 1t must have been before \u201939. What was your question?",
        "Q: And what were you trying to accomplish while you were there?",
        "A: I was charged to get affidavits of support for refugees who were still in Europe, and wanted to\ncome to this country. And somebody had to guarantee that they would not become a charge of\nwelfare. And I got quite a few affidavits, because I could plead my cause. I had seen it. And I did\nthat, really until I went to college, working for the Quakers, being a counselor in a refugee camp.\nNow, this was a Quaker camp for refugees who had already arrived in this country.",
        "Q: And where was this refugee camp?",
        "A: In Nyak, New York.",
        "Q: Can you give a little more description of the camp, and the individuals you helped there?",
        "A: Sure. The people who were there, were very often couples where one part was not Jewish, or\na -- some were political refugees, and not Jewish. The Quakers helped everybody. The majority\nhad Jewish blood, it was not that they were -- I don\u2019t think we had an Orthodox Jew in the camp.\nBut it was comparatively young people, it were majority professional people, who needed\nretraining in this country, and the director of that camp was a minister. That was a -- an\ninteresting experience for me, and I learned a lot. And the camp was run like all camps, there\u2019s\nlots of language classes, and community interest. Some sport, but very little, the people had other\ninterest at that kind than sport. Was a lot of writing to find where relatives were, and you\n[indecipherable]. There, you never forget -- forgot that there was a war. I mean, not the war\n[indecipherable], but there was liberation for a war. And it had the most intellectual group that\nI\u2019ve ever met in camps. Oh gosh, I have another camptery. Okay, a -- and I know that I wrote\nwhat I called a national hymn for that camp, which we sang for [indecipherable]. I can\u2019t sing, I\ndon\u2019t know music, but I wrote it. And --",
        "Q: Do you remember it?",
        "A: No. I know where the camp was, Sky Island on the Hudson, and that was a refrain of it,\neverything was beautiful in Sky Island of the Hudson, [indecipherable]. I threw all that stuff out,\ntoday it would be interesting.",
        "Q: Approximately how many refugees were in that camp?",
        "A: I really can\u2019t -- can only guess a hundred, wild guess.",
        "Q: And how long were you working there?",
        "A: Two summers. It only existed during the summer, for people who couldn\u2019t afford a real\nvacation, and who needed an effer -- American atmosphere. The food was so American, they had\ndifficulty in eating -- well, it was very well meant, very human, and was in the estate of an\nAmerican psychiatrist, who still is around, Dr. Viola Bernard. She still may be [indecipherable]\nthe museum. She\u2019s not Jewish, but very, very interested. And she had a beautiful estate, and the\nfaucets were sort of heads of lions, so you can imagine. Okay, so much for that. And after one\nsummer, in \u00b039, I started college. And in college, I had to run interesti -- I had many lovely,\nlovely experiences. But one experience that fits is, I was a -- later on -- is that true? No, doesn\u2019t\nhappen in college, comes a little later. So I graduated, made many friends. Was interesting to me,\nthat there, we really didn\u2019t know who was Jewish, and who was not. You know, that was such a\ndifference. I was a rarity at that time, because refugees weren\u2019t so many at that time. And I\nknow, I get along with people, and I had a great time, and eventually I graduated, in \u201941. And\nthere was no question I\u2019d go to school of social work, I got another scholarship, which meant\nanother job on the side, but these things are typical for an immigre. And I kept my apartment\nwith my furniture, I rented a room -- separate rooms. And began to be more involved with\nrefugee questions. I had a room mate who was very much on the left political, and didn\u2019t let me\nforget that it was Fascists who did all this. And we were very young. And I always get involved\nin strange things, so I was -- well -- political involvements, so stay out of it. And I found life\nvery interesting, got much more Americanized. Had a very easy time in school of social work.\nMy placement was with the children\u2019s agency, and it all seemed to me very easy. I don\u2019t know\nwhy they made so much fuss about it. The only bad thing was, I had in the morning, and in the\nevening, to travel for over an hour, through all of Philadelphia. So much for that. I still was in\ntouch with the Quakers, I still have them out with the refugee faction. And I always have had a\ngreat respect and love for the Quakers, but never wanted to convert, because I always thought,\nyou don\u2019t run away from something that\u2019s difficult into something that\u2019s easier. So the Quakers\nwere asked by the War Education Authority -- this is now 41. Don\u2019t hold me to the dates. Not\n41, I had a -- nonsense. \u201943, I graduated from school of social work. There is something I don\u2019t\nremember, and that\u2019s what -- I think right after school, I went to Maryland, to the state hospital,\nbecause I was more and more interested in psychiatric social work. And I spent one difficult year\nin a state hospital near Sikesville, Maryland. And that was a -- hospital of about 3,000 patients,\nand five physicians. And there I became very much aware of Europe and it\u2019s difficulties, because\nthe majority of our five physicians had come from Europe, and had escaped Hitler. And there\nwere also one Jewish physician who was American. And I told you, I get involved, sometimes I\nalso in the wrong place. I became, in my free time, the director of the recreation for our camp of\n-- of conscientious objectors. I could wro -- write a book about it if I want. And that was not\nliked by the American attendants, because they had their husbands in the war, here was this one\nJewish female, and she was playing around with the people who were trying to escape war duty,\nand messed up situation, I was in between vics. And the Jewish doctor, saw me going with my\nCO friends, a whole unit of them, singing Christmas carols. He called me to his office, and sa --\nand said, \u201cIf I wouldn\u2019t be punished, I would spank you. You are no [indecipherable]. You tried\nto be a Christian,\u201d -- which I never tried, I just like to go around with some [indecipherable].\nAnd he gave me hell. So I got it from Jewish side.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff. Mrs. Schiff, would\nyou please tell me about your reaction to the start of World War Two, while you were in\nAmerica?",
        "A: What, of course, I remember first of all, was that I was suddenly an enemy alien. I\u2019d been\nthrown out of my country, to come to America, and find myself an enemy alien. I could not have\na camera, I could not have a short wave radio. And for every trip, I had to get permission from\nWashington, which means my brother, who was in Washington, working for the government, I\ncould only go and see him with special permission, which I got. I didn\u2019t go too often, but he\ncame to me. I -- these are individual things. My outstanding best friends at that time, were the\ndirector of the labor relations board in Philadelphia, and his wife. And they were ardent pacifists.\nAnd on the day the we -- war broke out, they asked me, \u201cHow do you feel about it?\u201d And\nimpulsively, I said, \u201cI\u2019m glad that,\u201d -- now this is when America got into the war, -- \u201cthat\nAmerica is getting into the war, because that will give the allies more power.\u201d And they looked\nat me in disgust, and said, \u201cHow can you be glad about any war?\u201d And I said, \u201cIs it better when\npeople are slaughtered in camps? Do you want that to go on for eternity?\u201d So we had a very long\ndiscussion. We stayed friends afterwards, and we both kept our opinions. They were pacifists. I\nhad been a pacifist for a good time of my life. As a matter of fact, when in Germany, I was the\nyoungest member of the [indecipherable] for Human Rights. So, that will always be my interest.\nBut, I changed when Hitler came, and I gave up the pacifist, I just couldn\u2019t. But that\u2019s my\noutstanding memory. And then, of course, it was the anxiety, I couldn\u2019t get letters from Europe. I\nhad heard so much about the first World War, because I was born in the beginning. But when I\nwas five and six, the memory was still very strong, my parents, and [indecipherable]. So, I knew\nwhat was going to happen, and I also had a ration book during the war, but I suppose everybody\nhad it. I don\u2019t know, I was in an institution, in that camp -- no, in the state hospital, and we got\nvery little to eat, but I realized it was still much more than they had in Europe. And then, of\ncourse, I had very strong sympathies for the allies, and once in awhile, I got letters smuggled\nfrom England, or from my sister in France. I suffer always for some contact, somebody asked me\nthis question. I don\u2019t remember if the letters were censored or not. I don\u2019t think I ever was out of\ncontact with my mother. I looked -- I kept my mother\u2019s address, but not the war time, one, so I --\nI really don\u2019t know. I remember how I threw my camera into a river, because I wasn\u2019t permitted\nto have it. Why I didn\u2019t give it to an American colleague, I don\u2019t know. And I -- I did not have\ntoo many Jewish friends while I was in Philadelphia. I had roo -- Jewish room mates, but one\nwas American, and as I implied, very much on the left. The other was also from Germany, and\nvery assimilated. And so certainly we were interested, we read the papers, and we hoped that war\nwould be over. But we also tried very hard to live from day to day. Now, this changed for me in\n1943 or four. I\u2019m really not good with figures. When the War Education asked me -- War\nEducation Authority, to go to Oswego, New York. And Oswego was a camp, it was a former\narmy camp that had barracks, and awful ones. And there\u2019s barbed wire around. It always amazes\nme, the only time I personally have been in the camp, with barbed wire, and real barracks, was in\nAmerica. Because I was always insisted on living right in the camps, because you can\u2019t be of\nhelp if you are billeted in a hotel outside. And these were a thousand refugees, who had been in -\n- yeah, it was called concentration camps, but were not extermination camps, in Italy. One was\ncalled Perramonte, just for your information. And the refugees, the majority, by far, were Jewish.\nI think we had about five non-Jewish people, but we had some. We had some Ukrainians. And\nDr. Ruth Gruber, who was the assistant to all [indecipherable] acres, who was an -- high in the\ngovernment, had been sent to Europe to select from different camps, a thousand refugees. These\nhad been invited by President Roosevelt, with the idea that Italy was starving, and he would at --\nat least take a thousand mouths out. Well, it\u2019s really not a very bright idea, but it helped a\nthousand people. And they were invited to -- the whole time, they didn\u2019t know if they could stay\nin this country. And what that means psychologically, you can\u2019t do it -- can\u2019t imagine. Actually,\none was sent back because he was insane. The others eventually stayed here, in \u201945. And I\u2019ve\nmet them over the -- my career in social work, all over the place. And that was my first camp ex\n-- no -- well, the other was a vacation camp, this was a camp with all the difficulties of a camp.\nPeople not having any privacy. Some people died. One person died shoveling snow. The\nadministration was blamed for that. I got an [indecipherable] to later camp life. The food was\nalways [indecipherable], it\u2019s always in camps. People have to have an outlet for all their feelings,\nso they fight for food. We had a few birth. We had a hospital run by a Jewish laf -- doctor, who\nwas supervised by Dr. Ruth, who had already an MD in America. In the hospital, I had an\noperation, and I remember my refugee doctor very well. However, it went all right. It was an ope\n-- operation, an appendix, and they found an ovary was -- they took out an ovary that shouldn\u2019t\nhave taken out [indecipherable] forget. And I stayed in that camp, almost through the end. I think\nI left a month before. People eventually got the permission to stay. Most of them came to New\nYork. Ruth Gruber co-wrote a book about Oswego, \u201cSafe Haven.\u201d I disagree with the book, but\nanyhow --",
        "Q: Can you explain why?",
        "A: I -- Because she saw a side from the point of view of a rather optimistic American. She\nworked very hard, I mean, she really -- she helped. These people wouldn\u2019t have been here\nwithout her, but how she described the camp, I don\u2019t quite agree with. I saw more conflict than\nshe did. But ac -- but we are still good friends, I still see her, and Oswego people have also\n[indecipherable] word?",
        "Q: Community?",
        "A: Community. They meet once in awhile, cause we all are old people now. And some of them\ndied, some of them have grandchildren. The grandchildren I met in my last job, and some of\nthem, because in that job, among other things, I ran a scholarship committee for refugee, and\nsecond and third generation. And suddenly, some of my Oswego grandchildren turned up.\n[indecipherable], they are very bright, and good students. Europeans know how to study. So, you\nsee, that\u2019s why I say my life is so interwoven, one with each other, Quakers from all occasional\n[indecipherable] etcetera.",
        "Q: Can we go back momentarily to your very first experiences, helping refugees, and that\u2019s when\nyou were working with the Quakers. And could you give a little more detail as to how you\nstarted to get involved in that kind of work? Was it through the friend in Philadelphia, or\nsomeone else?",
        "A: I tell you, my girlfriend, whom I knew from school, was a Quaker, and was a daughter of the\ndeeding Quaker in Germany. Somebody writes a book about it, and interviewed me. So, through\nher, it was natural that I met other Quakers. And I met a professor of social work, Hetta Calls,\nfrom Czechoslovakia. She was a professor of social work in Bryn Mawr, and for quite some time\nI stayed in her house, and she was a president at that time, or the founder of this refugee section,\nand she knew that I knew typing, a little shorthand. And she introduced me as her secretary to the\nAmerican Friend Service Committee in Philadelphia. And I was very lucky, I got to know Rufus\nJones, and Kelly, and learned to loved, and admired a lot. And met my first -- I was a refugee of\n-- myself at that time, really in the camp. What I had to do as a secretary was really mostly\nwriting letters, trying to search for people, trying to get affidavits, trying to talk to lawyers. A\nlittle bit helping people to adjust. Helping them to get lessons for car driving. Women didn\u2019t\nreally know how to drive. I don\u2019t know how to -- not today. And it was not that common in\nGermany, or Austria. The refugees at that time are mostly from Germany -- not in the camp\nOswego, but what I imagine Philadelphia was pretty much German Jewish [indecipherable].",
        "Q: Where was the camp that was run by the Quakers, the two summers? Where exactly was that\nlocated?",
        "A: In Nyak, N-y-a-k, New York. It\u2019s how -- it\u2019s about an hour from here, upstate, in\nWestchester.",
        "Q: Okay. So, after that experience, the experience with the camps, the two summers in a row,\nthen eventually, you were able to work in Oswego with refugees, and that work there, what was\nyour daily responsibilities?",
        "A: Taking histories, in case people could stay in this country. Taking histories for the sponsoring\nagency. Helping people to adjust to camp life. No European knows camp. And that men should\ndo the cooking, don\u2019t tell me. And to see that the hospital functioned. We were just -- every\nreligion had a -- a -- [indecipherable] what\u2019s the word?",
        "Q: Every religion had a place of worship of some kind, or --",
        "A: No, it had a person from every religion was a social worker. [indecipherable] one wa --",
        "Q: Some representative?",
        "A: Yes, [indecipherable]. And also a -- a Jewish agency. I was really quick repre-representative\nthere. The Jewish agency admaroon became my best friend, she just died. And the Catholic had\none, too. And there were lots and lots of adjustment question. People had left their homes, didn\u2019t\nknow where the other person was, the family was torn. A -- and as I say, we had to take very\ncomplete histories for the government, no personal really, but there you had to know the facts,\nand the facts were not too well known. And -- and they had had the camp experience in Italy, and\nsome had illnesses, and some had venereal illnesses, and we suddenly had the last\n[indecipherable]. You had to ha -- make the things work, you know? The idea, to be behind\nwired bar -- barbed wire, we had -- we had to be in this free country, in a camp. So it was really\npsychiatric social work, and immigration work.",
        "Q: How many --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: How many other people were working in that camp, approximately?",
        "A: Hard to say. We had about -- we had a director, and a deputy director, American. We had\nabout four social worker. We had a head nurse, and I think some other nurses. We had teachers,\nwe had -- no -- no teachers there, the children could go out of camp to school. It was a fight, but\nwe got to school. We were always fighting. I think that\u2019s about what was there, and then all sorts\nof people came from other agencies to study these strange animals from Europe. But the biggest\ngroup was Polish, and the second group was Yugoslav, and they couldn\u2019t stand each other. And\nwe also had a non-Jewish prince from Lithuania, who got into fis -- a fist fight with somebody\nelse, because they both thought they were princes. I mean, anything and everything possible. We\ndid have a library, we did have lectures, we did have good concerts, there were good musicians\namong the group. It was daily living. Was a lot of anxiety.",
        "Q: There are about a thousand --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- refugees?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And mostly Jewish?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And from which countries, primarily? You said --",
        "A: Yugoslavia, Poland, Austria, Germany. But were far the most from Yugoslavia, and Poland.",
        "Q: And what was the age range of the refugees?",
        "A: Newly born, to about 90. We had children being born there. So we had kindergarten also. The\nage range was really everything that had been in camp in Italy, and they had it all ages, like.",
        "Q: And there were elderly people, as well?",
        "A: At that time, over 50 seemed elderly to me. I can\u2019t remember real old people, my age, for\ninstance, my age now. I can\u2019t remember. I remember mostly 1 -- in their 20\u2019s, and then in their\n50\u2019s, but --",
        "Q: What were your own living conditions like in the camp?",
        "A: I had a room, we all had rooms. Not in the barrack, as far as I remember. I cannot remember\nwhere we ate, I think 1t was in a mutual dining room where all the staff ate. I lately think it was\nall in a private house, where the officers had lived, when it was a military camp. But, I remember\nwell my little room, but funny, you know how [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you do much socializing with the other refugees, or the individuals you were working\nwith?",
        "A: Both. I made good friends among my colleagues, still went on -- until now, I mean, we are\nnow older, have died ,or God knows what. And about the refugees, I also made friends. And that\nwas quite acceptable, not in all camps I\u2019ve worked in, but this was quite acceptable. I had a\nyoung man interested in me in that time, and so had my colleague. It was all very romantic, and\nwe got to know them very well, and some of them, on later stages, became my clients. One -- for\ninstance, my agency, when I say my agency, I mean Self Help. I worked 39 years, so it sort of\nbecame mine, build a house here in Cos-Cosina Boulevard for displaced persons, and -- a big\napartment house. And one of the first people to move in was a client from -- of mine, from\nOswego. So ways always cross again.",
        "Q: How long were you in Oswego?",
        "A: Pretty much from beginning to end, just in a year.",
        "Q: What were the dates, approximately? Do you recall?",
        "A: Yeah, from \u201944, to \u00b045.",
        "Q: Were you paid to do that work?",
        "A: Yes. Wallit -- well, the government paid me. No idea what, but they did pay me.",
        "Q: And had you received any very specific, specialized training for working with refugees by\nthat point?",
        "A: Just my heart.",
        "Q: What would you say you were able to learn about the war, or other events taking place in\nEurope, from the refugees, that you had not learned elsewhere?",
        "A: I did not know that there were camps in Italy. I did not know the war conditions. Yugoslavia\nhad an awful secret pol -- police, Usetasha. I had not known of that existence, and the madness,\nand the badness of the war was really beginning to come home to me, when I heard these people\nwho had escaped by night over the mountains. Who had sent children to other countries. The\nliving with danger, the constant being afraid some knock at the door will be the secret police, and\nyou'll be taken away. It became all a reality. And, of course, I was there when Roosevelt died,\nand that had a terrific effect on the camp population. They were really depressed. It\u2019s something\nthat is now a -- people don\u2019t want to acknowledge, American Jewish people, that Roosevelt\nmade many mistakes. But he also was a big hope for people. And, of course the ones who came\nto America loved him for that in -- invitation, and they were devastated when he died. They\ncouldn\u2019t know that Truman did much more perhaps, in the end, but it was really a -- a major\ndepression. I always felt that all the deaths they had seen in Europe were suddenly coming to life\nagain by the death of Roosevelt, who had sort of been a power figure to them. So all that made\nthe whole time much more real to me. I -- also, I didn\u2019t have as much of a private life. In\nPhiladelphia things were going on, but here you read the papers much more, and people had a\ncountry, but they had lost their parents. You saw, actually the people. [indecipherable] had been\nin the hospital, the doctor had refused to take care of them. And for the first time you really\nheard it, from word -- by mouth. So yes, it -- I always said this was my oderver to camp life.",
        "Q: Did Roosevelt\u2019s death also represent great uncertainty?",
        "A: Yes. It did represent great uncertainty. There was uncertainty anyhow, about who would\ncome next, and how would he handle it? It just brought home the nothinglessness, of the\nrefugees. No country, nowhere really to go, no profession, they couldn\u2019t make it. Just emptiness,\nall gone.",
        "Q: Were there cultural or religious activities in the camp? I believe you already mentioned\nconcerts, so there were some cultural activities.",
        "A: Yes. There were -- you had to be very careful what you did, because there were these great\npolitical differences. And you very easy got into a fistfight or something of that sort. So we tried\n-- we tried to have lectures, but not about politics, if possible. Oh yes, we had the other thing. As\nwe were supposedly strange animals, yeah, they sent us a psychiatrist from Chicago, who was\nsupposed to help people. I think he may have been of European origin. He certainly didn\u2019t know\nhow to handle people in camp. And he asked questions you ask in your private office, but they\nare do -- not applying to camp life. But the administration was very proud, we had a psychiatrist.\nWe were glad when he left, but --",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Dreyfuss. I think that\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Did you have much success in helping individuals find family members?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t do too much of that in that camp. There was another outfit what worked out of\nEngland, a location service, which matched thousands of families, but we didn\u2019t do it, we didn\u2019t\nknow how to do it there. And we really were extremely busy with keeping things under control.\nPeople went on hunger strike, it -- all sorts of things. They fought with each other. As I say,\nsomebody died shoveling snow, and family thought the administration should never have\nallowed him to shovel snow. And that\u2019s the only one I remember, there may be other ones. And\nhad organize that people were visitor in the hospital. They were always so busy, the men were\nnot so busy, the men had a difficult time to take women\u2019s jobs, like cleaning the barrack rooms\nthey had. We had single men, and they had to take care of their shabby, little apartments.",
        "Q: How would you characterize the political tensions that you referred to earlier?",
        "A: They were old border tensions, between the Yugoslav and the Austrians. And then there are\nalways fights between the Poles, and the Germans, I mean [indecipherable] traditionally have a\nlittle fight. It was not really politics as such, it was just old enemy. It was excited people who\nwould use every little incident to get excited about.",
        "Q: Were people housed together with other individuals of the same nationality, or was it a mixed\nhousing situation?",
        "A: I can\u2019t [indecipherable]. I think they were [indecipherable] but I am not sure. I think there\nwere.",
        "Q: And you were mentioning earlier about men having to take on roles that traditionally were\ncarried out by women. Were men and women essentially doing the same type of work in the\ncamp?",
        "A: Yeah, I think the men helped in the kitchen, but so did the women, but I know we couldn\u2019t get\nthe men to work in the kitchen.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add about your time in Oswego, before we move on?",
        "A: No, not really, no. I forgot to say that during my time in Maryland, I became a citizen. That\u2019s\nimportant because I wanted too much to be a citizen, to eventually go to Europe.",
        "Q: What was the process like in becoming a citizen?",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s all 60 years ago. I had to bring a witness. I was the only one to be naturalized,\nand funny enough, in the small town of Westminster, Maryland, they hadn\u2019t naturalized\nanybody, as far as I know. Anyhow, I hold number one certificate. And of course, I was afraid, I\nshould know some American history, and I know I got questions, what makes a suggestion a bill,\nwhen it had to become a bill, and so on.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff,\nconducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in Forest Hills, New York. This is tape number two,\nside A. On the last tape, we were speaking about your time in Oswego, and -- where you were\nworking with refugees, and now perhaps you can tell me what you did after you finished your\ntime in Oswego.",
        "A: When I came back from Oswego, I had moved from Philadelphia to New York, and I was\nwaiting for papers to clear, to go eventually to Europe. I went back to a job I had had before, and\nthat\u2019s the juvenile court. I was always interested in working with delinquent youngsters -- so-\ncalled delinquent. And I worked for what\u2019s called Youth House for boys, and later for Youth\nHouse for girls. Again, as a psychiatric social worker, taking histories this time for the judge to\nhave -- make decisions what to do with a youngster, send him home, go to placement, or\nwhatever was indicated. I had done that early in the game, I forgot which year. I did it again\nwhen I came back from Oswego, and that was by the middle of \u201945. And I did it until the end of\n\"46, when I went, with the Joint Distribution Committee, to Europe. I had been in touch with the\nJoint a long time before. Actually, \u2019'd known about it all my life, cause my family was very\ninstrumental in it\u2019s creation. And the Joint was one of the agencies working in Europe after the\nwar. The other was UNRRA. Those were the two main agencies. Of course, every religion had\nit\u2019s representation. The Joint, and the U.S. Army, and the UNRRA was p-part of it, were really\nthe most constructive factors in rebuilding. I am very aware that they are under a lot of criticism,\nbut having been on the spot, I can say that they performed a miracle. Europe at that time was\nchaos, people not knowing where they came from, not knowing where they were going,\npractically not knowing who they are. The Joint and UNRRA [indecipherable] really established\ncamps, with the help of the army, for various groups, eventually for all people. There have been\nso many camps, and they were different in the different zones. You had the British zone, and you\nhad the American zone. I can\u2019t remember if they had a Russian zone, but they had three zones.\nAnd em -- each zone had it\u2019s country director, and then there was a director for all the work, in\nParis. He was in charge of it all. I know that when I came over, I was first going to Paris, to be\noriented toward what was expected to me -- of me, and to be assigned to a country. I did not\nknow when I left here where I would go. I assumed it would be Germany or Austria because of\nthe language. To my great surprise it was Italy. And my much bigger surprise came, I went to\nRome, because the capital always was the center where the Joint worked out of, and I spent a few\nweeks in a sort of reception camp called Genechita, City of the Movies. It was the Hollywood of\nItaly. And that was a camp for every refugees that had been picked up. Every nation, and wi --\nreligion. Men, women, children. I don\u2019t know how many. To me it seemed thousands, it may not\nhave been. And that camp, I remember as a nightmare. If you ask me who administered it, I do\nnot know any more. I know it had no individual rooms. There were partitions between the\nfamilies, sort of made of sheets -- bedsheets, where you could hear every noise from the\nneighboring bed, which means your private life was open to the children, open to each other. It\nmay be part because it was my first real camp, but I was absolutely overwhelmed. The second\nday I was there, there was a rumor that a Chinese had killed his wife. If that was so or not, I have\nno idea, but everybody talked about it. That was, in my memory, the most primitive camp, but as\nI say, I had just arrived, I had no basis of comparison. In a way it was good, because every other\ncamp seemed like -- not paradise, but at least not like hell. And I must say, I don\u2019t remember\nanything of the beauty of Rome, which I had not seen before. I only remember this miles of\nhumanity, badly dressed, hungry, cold -- it was winter, I came so -- in February, I think. And --\nand then I was told I was to go to Milano, because I had experience with hospital work, and\n[indecipherable] work. And I got on long train ride. It still was right after the war, and people\nalways forget, your trains weren\u2019t running. Italy itself had no food. The people were under the\nimpression still of the war. Yes, they had won the war, oh, Italy didn\u2019t here -- take it back, I\u2019m\nnot sure Italy won. But they were -- everything was gray and gray. And it took us very, very\nlong to get from Rome to Milano, which usually takes a night. Sleeping [indecipherable] didn\u2019t\nwork, it was -- Italy was just a country in which a war had raged. And one shouldn\u2019t forget, it\nwasn\u2019t only all Displaced Persons, it was all the Italians themselves. You were hungry, and tired,\nand had no work. When I arrived in Milano, this rehabilitation center, being a former hotel,\nlooked like absolute luxury. I did not stay in the place. I think that had had reasons, because it\nwas tuberculosis all over the place. We had, as far as I remember, no children. Some younger\npeople. I remember a young woman, perhaps in her early 20\u2019s, from Yugoslavia, who had\nsurvived with her parents, and they had gone through hell, and she had ch -- tuberculosis, and\ndied, very much at the beginning of -- and I never forget it, I can still paint her face. And that --\nit\u2019s really difficult to talk about, because it\u2019s a double experience. Here you had survivors faced\nwith death again. Now, what that meant to them, I can\u2019t imagine, I can only feel a little bit in my\nfingertips. And still you had the same political groups fighting each other, that was the\nHungarians and the Poles. All Jewish people, but different ideas, different religious traditions.\nBeing angry at the world. This is [indecipherable] people. I remember three of young men who\nwere not even 20 -- I mention that because you, at that age, could survive, and then in the 30\u2019s\nand 40\u2019s. You hadn\u2019t many old people survive, and you hadn\u2019t many children survive. Not in\nthese camps. We had a doctor from South Africa, who was the M.D. director of the camp, and\nwe had Displaced Persons physicians. We had about three physicians. Now, either ask me how\nmany patients, I really don\u2019t know, about a hundred, could be mistaken. Too long ago to ve -- to\nremember figures. And, what perhaps has to be mentioned 1s that was the time where\nstreptomycin was a rarity. The doctors practically only had lermotorax to work with, which was\na much more complicated procedure, nobody [indecipherable] it could be dangerous. Also, for\nthe TB doctors, they had to stand very long. This is procedure, and I know once or twice\nsomebody fainted. And streptomycin, we always had to get on the Black Market. Now, this was\nthe center of the Black Market. You exchanged streptomycin for either coffee or cigarettes. And\nthe accepted -- accepted currency were cigarettes. And -- and the other thing was, there was\nsomething -- the army run co -- called the PX, which was like a shopping center, with a very low\nprices. And we had, as American, or an English workers, we could buy there, and we could\nexchange. There are also two currencies. There was green dollar, and oh, what was the other\ncalled? A script. A script, as far as I remember, you couldn't take out of the country, I don\u2019t\nremember it. The green dollar was much better, and you could get anything for a green dollar,\nfrom two dollars to [indecipherable] dollars, there was no rule or regulation. And there was a\nfight to get food, because the Germans had no food themselves. And all these things are of\ncourse, forgotten. Now, one of these stories -- oh, I don\u2019t know how many, have been in articles I\nhave written over the years. They are not very new. I\u2019ve told them before. But one can\u2019t\nduplicate them, I can\u2019t invent new ones. And one which shows you the difficulty with food.\nJewish holidays, of course, played a very, very big role. And these were the first holidays in\nfreedom. So, my people in the -- I call it camp, it\u2019s really abcenter, wanted to be like home, and\nhave geese and chickens for Rosh Hashanah. Now how to put loose geese and chickens, when all\nI had was the canned goods the Joint hand me? Now, many, many of my people weren\u2019t even\nused to that. So, the only thing to do was to ask if any of the DP\u2019s would be able to look after\nlive chicken and geese, and there was somebody. So then I went to the mayor of this little\nvillage, and asked if I could have some, I would bargain against canned peas, and stuff like that.\nWell, they let me have some. So, in our DP Center, we had guk, guk, guk, guk. And they were a\nbig excitement, we had them for a few months. We had to feed them, they were like everybody\nelse, starving. And the whole group, of course, was very much interested. And Rosh Hashanah\ncame. We had a cook who was German and not Jewish, so he cooked the beasts, and when he\nwas cooking them, to get the feathers out, he used boiling water, and when he did that -- you\nknow what a mushkia is? The Jewish [indecipherable] overseers, which we would have foster,\ncame in, and he looked at it and said, \u201cTrayfa, no good, no good. You can\u2019t eat them. Now tell\nyour community what happened.\u201d I said, \u201cWe m -- have to find a way out. This means life to\nthem.\u201d Well, I had an Orthodox part, a community, they all wanted to go right to America, and\nthe un-Orthodox want to go what was then Palestine. Now, the un-Orthodox said, \u201cWe can eat --\neat it.\u201d The Orthodox says, \u201cTrayfa, trayfa, it can\u2019t be done.\u201d Then the Orthodox committee\ncame to me and said, \u201cYou know, you have to ask a miracle rabbi.\u201d A-Again this gentleman\nassimilated [indecipherable]. Well, eventually, I found a miracle rabbi in a camp in Austria.\nNow, try to phone, in occupied Germany after the war from one country to another. I had to call\nGeneral Clay\u2019s office, who was the commander of all of the German zones, and I got some\nsoldier who thought I was utterly nuts. \u201cWhat do you want, chicken? Buy some chicken.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me, I have to,\u201d -- \u201cAll right, you get clearance.\u201d I get clearance, I call for the wonder\nrabbi, and I get him. And he says, \u201cFirst of all, are you a Jewish daughter? Well, this is a very\ndifficult question, I have to think about it. Would you call back in two hour?\u201d I said, \u201cBut the\nthings have to be cooked. I have no time to waste, I have excited people.\u201d Call back. So I go\nthrough the whole thing again, get the same soldier to Clay\u2019s office, who just -- who just shakes\nhis head, I am sure, but gives me clearance. And then I get the answer, it\u2019s a little difficult to\ntranslate from the German Jewish. \u201cIf the geese and the chickens were boiled in water that was\nhigher than the boiling mark, then they are trayfa, but if that was lower, if was water right out of\nthe faucet, then they can be eaten.\u201d So I was on very good terms with a young DP camp director,\nwho had had a baby. I said to him, \u201cPlease, you bathed your baby this morning in hot water from\nthe faucet?\u201d He knew exactly what I was doing, said, \u201cYes, Miss Tarenberg, I did.\u201d I went back,\ncalled my two committees together, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the answer from the [indecipherable] rabbi,\nwe can\u2019t go any higher, and we are going to eat the animals.\u201d And we did. But these stories, once\nin a lifetime. Bad food is 1n all institutions, one of the main cause for trouble, because people\ndon\u2019t have so many things to fight about, and they let out all their hostility, their fear, their\nanxiety, on food. And I have had so many debates about food, you can\u2019t imagine. In the three\ncenters I worked in. So that was part of it, but the emotional atmosphere on these holidays, with\nthe families, some were all over the place, if they were alive, was really unforgettable. On a more\ncheerful note, we had our first wedding in camp. And that again 1s a story, how overly sensitive\npeople are under those conditions. This young couple wanted to go Aliyah beth -- you know\nwhat it is? To Palestine. And when they married -- at that time, of course, we had to create a\nwedding dress. Well, the Joint had sent us lots and lots of material for cottons, and out of the\ncotton material, we made dr-dresses for the whole group. And in a actual over-identification, I\nmade myself a dress, too. We must have looked like a flower garden. Anyhow, when they\nmarried, I wanted to give them a wedding present. You don\u2019t have very much to give, and\nanyhow, money seemed to be the most important. Well, I took some lira and put them in an\nenvelope, which was from my office, it was a little torn, and the young lady first said -- didn\u2019t\nsay anything. And much later came to me and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t thank you, because I was annoyed,\nbecause you didn\u2019t take care enough to put that money in a nice envelope, and write something\nnice on it. We are taking that money, not for our personal gratification, but we\u2019ll give it to Aliyah\nbeth.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, if that gives you satisfaction. I\u2019m sorry. I surely didn\u2019t want to\nhurt you.\u201d But that\u2019s typical for the over-sensitivity. That was a Greek girl from Saronica. And I\nfound them a particularly sensitive group. I don\u2019t know as much as [indecipherable] that I know\nabout the other European countries. But they are a very sensitive group to work with. We had\nquite a few. We also had a supposedly Sephardic Jews -- Jew, from Greece somewhere, who\nturned out not to be Jewish at all. He was a Turk, and when a -- when he got angry, took a saber\nout -- I was talking -- and run around with a saber, but he ran away, end of story. As I say, the\ninteresting thing is that all that I remember so well, probably because I felt guilty that I couldn\u2019t\ndo more to help them, that they all have forgotten the bad part, and of course, compared to the\nconcentration camp, this at least meant some security, but that they didn\u2019t know to which country\nthey would go. I remember one woman who had a utterby breakdown, with good reason. She had\nwaited and waited for her husband, eventually located him in Poland, but he was married to\nanother woman, he had thought she was dead. And -- help. And then, a young lady who really --\nlater in this country, when I met her, by chance in the street, became a friend of mine, had\nmarched all the way from Romania, that was days and nights. And she was young, she was\nalmost a year -- a year -- was about 17 or 18, and almost all her family had been killed, but one\nbrother who had gone to Palestine. And she tried violently to make an adjustment once she\u2019 II\ncome to America. Had bad case of TB. They all had TB, but this was one of the worst. And I\nlooked after her, I s -- sat up at night with her, etcetera, etcetera. You do what you think has to be\ndone. It\u2019s not always social work, what\u2019s [indecipherable] happen. And one day we got a cable\nfrom Palestine that her brother had died in the war against England. Now I had the nice job to\ntell. And of course, she practically lost her mind, and so for quite a few nights I stayed with her\nin her room, and played, as well as I could, mother figure, but -- and she never got over, not even\ntoday, is happily married, but she had to tell all her past. Many didn\u2019t talk about their past, but\nshe felt she want to describe the halls, and there were many children. It was a very religious\nhome. And so every day, we set aside a certain hour for telling. And then I left, and I didn\u2019t hear\nabout her. I thought of her sometimes. I had a picture, with a very nice dedication. And really, 40\nyears went by, and I -- I\u2019m here in Forest Hills in a street, in front of a store, looking at some\nhats. And a very tiny voice behind me said, \u201cAren\u2019t you Miss Tarenberg?\u201d That was Celie, that\u2019s\nher name, Celia. And she had come to this country, had gotten TB again, was in a TB sanitarium.\nHad married, happily. Her husband died. Had married again, living quite near here. Has two\nwonderful children, and is a very good business woman, which I\u2019d never thought. Had\n[indecipherable] in business. We see each other once in awhile. It\u2019s gone -- I never\n[indecipherable] something, I cannot identify this [indecipherable]. You find that in DP camps,\npeople became either very, almost fanatically religious, or said a God who lets concentration\ncamps happen. It\u2019s very difficult to say something to either. But I found that over and over again.\nAnd it\u2019s interesting that the stories I got at that time, went riva -- really well, just about liberated\nfrom camps, were quite different than what you get today. I remember, I think out of my\npersonal sy-system, I remember so well a young man who was very close to his father, they were\nvery religious, and he had seen his father jump into the fire with a Torah in his arm. You don\u2019t\nhear that any more. But I must say, I almost cracked up on that one.",
        "Q: How were you able to communicate with people from so many different countries?",
        "A: With my broken Yiddish, and German, and to other member, we talk English. English was\ntaught in the school in Germany, and so when you had people from Germany, who went to a\nhigh school, you sometimes could. I do not remember communications difficulties. In what we\nsaid, yes, but not language-wise.",
        "Q: Did you start learning other languages yourself?",
        "A: No. I can make myself understood in -- 1n -- in Italian, or in Dutch. In Europe you pick up\nlanguages from traveling, but I don\u2019t speak that.",
        "Q: So I just want to establish the setting of this experience, not necessarily at camp, but more like\na rehabilitation center, as you call it. Was it wintertime? And exactly when did you arrive there,\nor as best as you can recall, month and year?",
        "A: I think in the mer -- no, that I can -- I think in Merrano, I arrived in the spring of \u201947.",
        "Q: You talked about the individuals there having tuberculosis. Did you see many deaths? Were\nmany of them very ill?",
        "A: I -- in Merrano, I saw quite a few. They are -- were all ready for rehabilitation, so you didn\u2019t\nsee too many -- they were not -- it\u2019s not true, they were not already for rehab. We see -- so I saw\nseveral deaths in -- in Merrano. I cannot remember in Passau.",
        "Q: Now, were you paid for doing this kind of work, as well?",
        "A: Yes. I was paid by the Joint Distribution Committee, and I was paid, actually in America,\nbecause of all the difficulties. We got a certain amount of script, I believe, in the country where\nwe worked. But we came back to America, and found quite a bit of money after three years. We\nweren't rich, but --",
        "Q: Did you sign up for a certain time period to work there?",
        "A: Not on a certain place, a contract was usually for 18 months, but you could break it any time,\nif you had to, and people did.",
        "Q: Did you have any other friends, or acquaintances in the United States, going to do this same\nkind of work in Europe?",
        "A: I had two friends who did --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff. On the other side,\nwe were talking about people you knew, who also went to do relief work, and work with\nrefugees in Europe.",
        "A: Yeah, I know these two, and I met other people in Europe with whom I still am friends,\ncolleagues of mine.",
        "Q: What was the journey like to get to Europe? Any specific recollections of that experience?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t even remember if I came -- probably by boat, I don\u2019t remember anythi -- yes,\nyeah, I came by boat, but I really don\u2019t remember anything whatsoever about it.",
        "Q: I think you already made some kind of reference to the kinds of discussions that you had with\nrefugees, and whether or not they wanted to talk about their past. Did they more often want to\ntalk about the war time experiences in comparison to their past before the war?",
        "A: That is difficult to say, because is a highly individual -- some people had a great need to talk\nabout their homes, and to show that they had little a farm, or a good business, or -- and I think\npeople react in accordance with their personality. You can\u2019t really make generalizations. Some\npeople had a great need to show how clever they had been in surviving, while today we\nrecognize that survivor, was luck. There are some things that have been shown, which made\nsurvivor, for instance, in a camp, somewhat more likely, if you had a close relative somewhere\nwho needed you. If you had a reason to survive. There are such things that one can perhaps a\nlittle, generalize. Some people who had a somewhat guilty conscience, had to justify the way.\nThere was much more things that had to be hidden at that time. I remember one man was so\nupset because he had stolen potatoes. And well, there were much more serious crimes that had\nbeen done. And yes, after the people trusted you, you would have the conflict that you could\nhave saved somebody, but you ran, or whatever it was. I always have difficulty with some of the\nthings, because you cannot document them, you have to trust my memory, and some of these\nstories, I don\u2019t even mention, because I have no way of showing they really happened. I know it,\nbut that\u2019s my quarrel I have very often, with people I discuss this whole -- memories are\nmemories, but they are not documentation. They change. Human mind is stra -- is really doing\nstrange things. And people who\u2019ve changed their story don\u2019t even know that they have changed\nit. \u2019ve had people tell me another person\u2019s story, and thought it was theirs. So, what I always\nsay, but that\u2019s now a personal opinion. Your facts are the skele -- skeleton, and the stories\n[indecipherable] are really the flesh you put on the skeleton. Cause it\u2019s amazing what happens.\nAnd then there are, of course, people who do it with a purpose. One experience is that when we\nwere very eager to get people to America, and they were -- the doctors felt they were really ready\nto go, but their x-rays didn\u2019t show it, we thought of [indecipherable] that the right x-rays were\ntaken. And the same people, when it came to restitution in this country, wanted me to testify that\nthey had tuberculosis. That\u2019s very difficult to decide what to do.",
        "Q: Were there any instances where you knew that it was wrong to do something, but you knew\nthat it -- in the end it would help someone, so you did it?",
        "A: I think I\u2019m not going to answer that.",
        "Q: Do you feel that your own memories have changed much over these years?",
        "A: It has changed by getting old. I ha -- the facts are not changed, but many things I could\nremember even two years ago, aS you see me groping for words sometimes, that\u2019s the process of\naging. I don\u2019t think that the facts of any of the things I say, aren\u2019t true. I can\u2019t guarantee, but I\ndon\u2019t think it 1s.",
        "Q: In the conversations you had with refugees, did they talk much about their goals for the\nfuture?",
        "A: If they had them, yes, but in the early days I\u2019m thinking of right now, they didn\u2019t know. They\ndidn\u2019t know what country, and what would be expected there. And then we had the alt, which is\na trade school there, and they learned some trades, which they really couldn\u2019t use in the country\nthey were going to. A shoemaker. Now we got many from Russia, but I mean, it\u2019s not a very\ndesirable trade here. Bookbinding. Now, you would teach computer. But that wa -- was a good\nidea, to get people who had never experienced the working process, having to be up at a certain\nhour, having a lunchtime, etcetera. But these school -- trade school, they had at least an idea how\na normal person works. It was a good idea.",
        "Q: Did any of the refugees with whom you had contact, speak of any desire to take out revenge?",
        "A: Yes. Absolutely. They still do, today. And when they hear something -- I heard somebody say\nwhen all this business happened with the French Concorde, it should happen to German. I said,\n\u201cIt did happen to German, and shouldn\u2019t happen to anybody.\u201d I mean, there you can see the raw\nfeeling, yes. And then, the question, will they ever go back for a visit to Germany, and Poland,\nand so on. And there\u2019s some who do, and some who don\u2019t. I am surprised that so many non-\nGerman Jews settled in Germany. I never quite understand that. It happened, I saw it myself.",
        "Q: Have you returned to your hometown in Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Yes. I -- I wanted to g -- to see the graves of my parents, because I\u2019m one of the few who\nknows where her parents are buried, and I thought [indecipherable] me, and I did.",
        "Q: When were you there, and how was the experience, visiting Germany\u2019?",
        "A: I have been there for two days or three days before, wanting to show my husband, who was\nfrom Poland, my hometown. I tell you, a experience -- I always have up -- a city in which I don\u2019t\nknow a single name in the phone book, is not my hometown. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a beautiful city, and\nthey were very surprised the taxi drivers, that I speak German without an accent. I could relate to\nthe young people, who really had nothing to do with all this. But when I saw somebody over 55,\nor so, I curled up. I didn\u2019t know what you did during the war. I looked at our old house. It was a\nfunny feeling. But something nice. When I was born, my father planted a pine tree in our garden,\nand by God, it survived. It was nice. I always said I am a survivor, so -- and people have gone\nback in g -- much greater numbers to Poland. They hate Poland much more than I hate Germany.\nI mean, [indecipherable] is in my own ca -- but I\u2019m not a person who hates. That my Polish\nfriends -- not my husband, he never hated Germany. You find 1n there, some of my husband\u2019s\nstories, which you will find interesting. It -- certainly you had people who never stopped talking\nabout what they did to escape, or to get out. And it was good for the ego, I think, it -- then, in this\ncountry, nobody wanted to hear about these stories. And now, it has become very fashionable. If\nI have to read another book about the Holocaust, I jump. And they get farther and farther away\nfrom the truth. I mean, that\u2019s natural. Life marches on, we hope. Anything else I should te-tell\nyou?",
        "Q: When was your visit to Germany, the one you were just referring to with your husband?",
        "A: 1953. \u00b054.",
        "Q: And just to go back momentarily, to the conversations you had with refugees in Italy, and any\ntalk --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- of revenge. What, at that time, was any of the specifics of -- of revenge that -- that people\nwould have liked to have taken if they could have?",
        "A: You know, they really didn\u2019t have the strength to do more than throw a -- a few words\naround, all the Germans should be killed. These strong words. Yes, they should be taken off this\nearth, I\u2019ve heard that. I never heard other children should be killed. I mean, you would think that\ncomes in from the [indecipherable]. I never heard it. I -- they wanted to kill individual\ncommanders of a camp, kapos, you know, the -- yes. But it was a -- obviously only talk was too\nmuch, yet the hostility was there. Was -- overriding it all was anxiety. What will become of us,\nwhat has happened to our families? Yes, there was a hatred against landlords taking over farms,\nor -- and then there were the differences in how the people had survived, which influenced their\nattitude toward everything. The people who had lo -- fought in the motho ghetto, they are much\nmore warrior-like than the ones who had hidden in the forest. And you see that also, in the\nsecond generation. Now, in my last year, I been working with the 50 and 60 year old children of\nmy original clients who have died. I mean, on, and on, and on. But now it\u2019s come\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: What kind of assistance were you offering to the second generation?",
        "A: I had them organized into groups. Now, we have so many groups, you can take your pick. I\neven had to have somebody in Los Angeles, but I don\u2019t know her, it went by letter. I have a --\nmy main work, when it really was work, was helping them to come to terms with the generation\nconflict. Want to hear anything about it? In so many cases, the parents expect that the younger\ngeneration should make up to them some of the things they never had. They overstress the value\nof education. They put so much pressure on, that the young people can\u2019t live up to it. But they\nhaven\u2019t had it, and here they had the chance, they have to take it. All right, when the time comes\nthat a 18 year old wants to move out of the house. You can\u2019t go -- leave us. Everybody has --\nelse has left us. Then the young person feels guilty. She wants to live her own life, or he, and on\nthe other hand -- I\u2019ve had many, many interviews around that. Around differences in religious\nactivities. And it works both ways, I have -- I had parents who were practically agnostics, and\nchildren were fanatic [indecipherable]. Then the adjustment difficulties. Young people here\ncertainly live different type of lives than parents have in Czechoslovakia. And that depends on\nwhich community they live in, but now -- when I first came here, I preached about the necessity\nthat we should know more about DP camps, because they were the catch all. And I was very mad\nwhen I heard of the big conference, that some of my former colleagues are, who were very nice,\nand I couldn\u2019t go, which annoyed me. But -- not really. And then I started to think, the second\ngeneration is in their 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s now. They must have something in common, and\nusual a social agency isn\u2019t really geared to this type of problem. They could probably best help\nthemselves. And I helped them to come together in groups. Now, we have the English transport\nchildren is one group. Then we have the hidden children is another one. There\u2019s a\n[indecipherable] which name I\u2019m -- I really don\u2019t know which. Federation of Children\n[indecipherable]. Now, unfortunately, they all compete with each other. But they do good work,\nthey all bring out the monthly newsletter. And that was very nice. I always get them from all of\nthem, and I give them to students I share the contact with, et-etcetera. And the English transport\nchildren were having a question where you can ask for relatives of friends. And I remembered\nthat my mother, in England, as a volunteer, was connected with a hostel where children from\nGermany and Austria, who went over with the English transports, stayed during the war years.\nAnd in a small place in Yorkshire, which I had almost forgotten, I was up there a few times. And\nreally for the fun of it, I wrote to the editor, and said, \u201cI wonder if any of your subscribers will\nremember an old lady in Italy, who ladled out the soup for lunch every day in the hostel.\u201d And lo\nand behold, I got three answers, after 60 years. From somebody in Canada, somebody in South\nAfrica, and somebody in Maine, and they remembered my mother, etcetera, my brother. So it\nstill goes on, you know? It\u2019s a personal experience, but it\u2019s an indication that it still is this\nreaching out for the past. Well, [indecipherable] of my personal memories. Cause the\nexperiences were very different than somebody who was in England, or hidden in the Ukrainian\nforest. A whole group has gone back to Poland this year, but I don\u2019t know what they had, I\u2019m --\nhad [indecipherable] to find out.",
        "Q: In the rehabilitation center in Italy, where you were, in Merrano --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Correct? You mentioned there was a German chef, someone who was not Jewish?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And was that unusual, for there to be someone German?",
        "A: It was not in Merrano. It was in Barishkamine.",
        "Q: Okay. Were there other Germans working then at the camp, or at the center in -- in Germany\nwhere you were?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think there was --",
        "Q: Or is that chef the only one?",
        "A: -- very much working, anyhow. There was a DP director, who then cheated, and had to leave.\nI can\u2019t remember. I just remember that cook.",
        "Q: Were there any tensions with the chef and refugees who might not have felt comfortable with\na -- a German there?",
        "A: There may have been, I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember any German personnel, I\njust remember this one guy.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s go back a little bit, to Italy again.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: And could you tell me if there was much in the way of Zionism in the realbit -- rehabilitation\ncenter where you were?",
        "A: Well, I lived through the day in Merrano, when Palestine became Israel, and that was one of\nthe most exciting days for the people. And we had an ardent group of Zionists. They were not in\nnumbers so many, as they were young, intelligent, aggressive, and I was pretty close to -- with\nthem, because Merrano is geographically near a pass, called the Brederal, and we got really\n[indecipherable] the people who went to Israel, later Palestine, and we hid them in the\nsanitorium, and the Zionist group, of course, was mac -- most active in that. That we had all sorts\nof dealings with the -- the Bricha, and with the Haganah, and -- and that was good, because the\npeople felt alive, you know? And then we brought people to this house of Italy, the people who\nwanted to go to Israel. Again, yes, people did die. I remember the leader of the Zionist group, a\nyoung man, just before going to Israel, died.",
        "Q: Did many of the individuals, the refugees you were with, leave for either Israel, or other\ncountries while you were there?",
        "A: Practically nobody left. It\u2019s -- you\u2019ll see, 1 -- the Truman act had just started. There was a\ntrickling of people. Many, many people were afraid to ler -- leave, I forgot to tell you. They were\nafraid of life outside. They had been under discipline for so long. They wouldn\u2019t tell it that way,\nbut it would come out of the conversation. You asked me something I didn\u2019t catch all.",
        "Q: During the time you were at Merrano, were many refugees leaving, and emigrating to other\ncountries?",
        "A: Some. A trickle. One or two to Australia, and one or two to South America. There were no\nvisas to be gotten.",
        "Q: How long did you stay then, in total, at that center? What -- when, approximately, did you\nleave?",
        "A: I am not -- really not sure. In \u201947, I had a car accident, I didn\u2019t [inaudible]. I would think\ntoward the end of \u00b048.",
        "Q: Did conditions change much from the time when you first came to Merrano, to when you left?",
        "A: Some people had left for Palestine. Some had gotten better. Oh yeah, we had this one incident\n[indecipherable]. We had one grim incident, which could have been avoided. People did not\nwant to leave the sanitorium, because yes, while ma -- word of mouth, they wanted to get out,\nit\u2019s awful, no food, but, it was actually a very good place. They had good food, and they had\ngood care. So, when they were going to be discharged to a regular camp, or to wherever they\ncould go, they didn\u2019t want it, they didn\u2019t like it. And a group of them got together, and said, \u201cWe\nwon\u2019t go.\u201d And there was an awful fight with the administration, and I know I was sent to look at\nanother sort of camp, that was empty, and they were supposed to go there, near Milano. And\nwhen we got there, I was with them. There was no water, and actually not much either. And they\nhated even the [indecipherable] there. And, the whole group decided to go back to Merrano. And\nthe administrator there had no food for them, you cou -- you got food -- rations for the persons\nyou have. And he didn\u2019t know what to do. And, as he couldn\u2019t -- he did not take them back into\nthe sanitorium, they had no damanna, no talmedge in Italy to stay, they were all sent to prison.\nNow, this should not have happened, but it did. And were all sorts of law students, they didn\u2019t\nstay in prison very long, I think there is a -- but it became a big issue. And eventually, I think,\nthey went back to the sanitorium, and eventually to different countries. But it created so much ill\nwill, Merrano never quite lived that incident down, and it\u2019s written up in drawings, and\n[indecipherable] everywhere I heard this story. Nobody knew much about how to handle\nsurvivors, and how to -- there was no government, there was nothing. We all had to do as best as\nwe could, and sometimes it wasn\u2019t right.",
        "Q: Did you often leave the center and s -- for whatever reason, go into the near town, or to the\nlocal area, and meet other people in the area?",
        "A: Me, or the DP\u2019s?",
        "Q: You.",
        "A: Yes. First of all, I was partly stationed in Munich. I could, on my free days, go to Munich,\nwhich was a big city in [indecipherable]. I also was very interested in seeing what was going on\nin the country. The country was really Austrian, and then became Italy after the second World\nWar. And again, 1 -- everybody hated everybody else. And the Germans came out during the day,\nand the Italians at night. It was really very strange. Merrano is a beautiful little city, and oh yes,\nwe had time for a private life. I was also, somewhere around that time, living in a hotel. I don\u2019t\nknow why, but I did. I worked in Merrano, in the real center, but I worked -- I lived across the\nstreet in a hotel. I don\u2019t know why, but I did.",
        "Q: That\u2019s where you stayed the whole 18 months?",
        "A: In Merrano, yeah. But in the hotel, no. I really couldn\u2019t tell you anything. I can picture the\nroom in which I lived, it -- I know during the whole time, I had a room in Munich, a tiny room,\nin which I had a peasant bath wi --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",

        "A: I was living partly in the Hotel Flora, across the river. I was also traveling quite often to\nMerrano, where there was a camp. I don\u2019t know where else I lived, I remember Flora.",

        "A: I think so. I just can\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Were you successful in helping to find family members for the refugees in Merrano?",
        "A: Once or twice.",
        "Q: And I know we spoke earlier about some of the religious holidays that were observed. Any\nparticular cultural events in Merrano, in the center?",
        "A: Wedding. I think two weddings I remember. A bris I remember. But, of course, when Israel\nwas declared Israel, we had a big celebration. I\u2019m sure we had Pesach, but I don\u2019t remember a\nthing.",
        "Q: Were there any commemorative events, for events that had taken place during the war, such\nas the Warsaw ghetto uprising, for example?",
        "A: Not that I remember. We had the evening for Jewish folk songs, and I remember very well\nthat our youngest patient at that time was about 14. She came to us from Bergen-Belsen, a\nconcentration camp up north, I think on a British. And she never had any formal education, or\nanything. Her father was a journalist in Warsaw, and she had a beautiful voice, and she sang a\nsong, \u201cAus straita librend,\u201d our city is burning, and she had her own tears. That\u2019s about the only\nget together of that sort I remember. But again, don\u2019t forget, 60 years ago, or whatever it was --",
        "Q: Were refugees asked to do some work in this rehabilitation center?",
        "A: Yeah, they had the school, trade school, and the arch, one of the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And in addition to that, were they asked to take care of any of the administration of the center,\nor help in any of the duties?",
        "A: Yes, but I -- I remember somebody helping with the clothing room, giving out clothing.\nProbably yes, but I wouldn\u2019t really ever known that, but everything so --",
        "Q: How did that situation differ from what you saw in Oswego? Were there more refugees there\nworking to help the camp stay afloat in Oswego, compared to Merrano?",
        "A: Merrano were sick people, and so it was very limited what they could do. Yes, I know, one of\nour porters was also a refugee. I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t remember that it ever became a problem in\nMerrano. They liked to do it, I think they were paid for it.",
        "Q: So now would you tell me about you departure from Merrano, and what you did after?",
        "A: You know, some things are really a little difficult, because one\u2019s own life gets so mixed up\nwith it. I went for a prolonged -- do the e -- no, I ended with the Joint, somewhere during the\nsummer, in I believe \u201948, I don\u2019t know what it was. And I went to Brazil, for personal reasons.\nBut I needed a job, and so I went to the Joint office in Rio. And they, of course, didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with me, because I don\u2019t speak Portuguese. Women doing that sort of thing in Brazil\nis not customary at this time. PS, I had one of the first flights from Rome to Rio de Janeiro,\nwhich took about 37 hours. And I had never been in a plane before.",
        "Q: How was that experience?",
        "A: Overwhelming. We went down in Dakar, were so many big flies. Was all very, very strange,\nbut [indecipherable] as the only Jew with me, that was a displaced person. But the Joint thought,\nwhat can we do with her? Well, the only thing we could think of, because they really had no\ndisplaced persons around, was sending me around to get money, to -- as a fundraiser. A, I am the\nworst fundraiser under the sun in any language. B, I was a women -- woman, Thirdly, I don\u2019t\nspeak the language. So, it was an absolute failure, but on friendly terms. We just decided we\nweren\u2019t for each other. And I took the next plane back to Paris, where I had a sister. And I went\nto the Joint, and said -- I said I\u2019m back in Europe, I might just as well work, and they assigned\nme to Germany. They sort of were quite glad to have me back at the time. So, that\u2019s how I\nstarted in Bashkimine. Passau came a little later, but I had them both together, and then I was\nstationed in Munich. But I really wasn\u2019t supposed to be there too often, they thought I had to go\nto time in Munich, I better stay in my village often.",
        "Q: Did you see a great deal of devastation from the war?",
        "A: In Italy, I did. In Munich, I only saw the main streets, really. In Frankfort, I saw a lot. But it\nobviously didn\u2019t impress me very much, or I would be able to remember details, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did you feel very different about being in Germany, than when you had been in Italy, right\nbefore?",
        "A: Yes. To be in your own country, in an American uniform, and not belong anywhere is very\ndifficult. And I didn\u2019t like the Germans very much, and I never liked the people from Bavaria,\nthe city was prejudiced, but there it was. I never felt at home in Munich. I got along well in\nBashkimine and Passau. Now, in Passau, I spent month in the hospital. You can have it as a\nstory, I mean, I -- in a way, connected. We all had the command of Jeeps in Germany, because\nthey were always meeting in another place, or yet to another camp. That\u2019s how I saw so many\ncamps, because you were sent to see 1f a patient\u2019s ready for discharge, or whatever. And we had\na person in charge of our own district, from England. And there was -- there were meetings\nforever, and this was in November, this I remember. And it was a very foggy night, and I had a\nyoung Czech driver, who meant very well, but didn\u2019t know too much about driving. And we\ncouldn\u2019t find the house of this English commander. And we drove down a mountain, and where\nhe thought was a street, 1t was a mountain going down, and the Jeep rolled over, and over, and\nover. Have a happy ending. And I don\u2019t know much what happened after, I was first taken, I\u2019m\ntold, to the house of the commander. I was unconscious, and then eventually taken to the Passau\nhospital. There I woke up, in a German hospital, which was all I needed, and with a big, s-\nswollen head, and it turns out that I had a fracture of the skull. Luckily, my driver came the next\nday. Nothing had happened to him, and he wanted to apologize. It\u2019s very often the person who\nsits next to the driver. And I was in that hospital for months. I think it was March that I got out. I\nwas very lucky, I had no le -- nothing left over. My eye 1s a little affected, but for weeks I\ncouldn\u2019t see, I thought I would never see again. And it was not Christmas, was some holiday, I\nknow people were very nice to me, and a Catholic priest always came and gave me the Last\nRites, and I could really take my choice. And eventually I was asked, where would -- did I want\nto go for a convalescent leave. And I chose Merrano, because I knew doctors there, and I knew\nthe place, and I didn\u2019t want to go to a German German place. And in Merrano, I met my future\nhusband, who was a doctor there. So I said to the end of his life, \u201cI had to fall on my head to\nmeet you.\u201d So you see, it has been a rather eventful life.",
        "Q: When did you meet him, when was that that you returned to Merrano?",
        "A: I met him in \u201948, we got married in \u201952, cause we had different quotas from different\ncountries. I was an American citizen, he was Polish, and so they had a long to-do, but we made it\neventually.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Merrano at that point?",
        "A: I guess about four weeks, and then I went back to work. I went to the end of that contract,\nthen they established another year [indecipherable], I don\u2019t know the name, I went there a few\ntimes, to help the worker there to get organized, but something ashabat, I really don\u2019t know. And\nthen came back.",
        "Q: After you recovered from the car accident, were you still enthusiastic about returning to do\nthe ru -- refugee work?",
        "A: Yeah. Everybody was surprised, and told me I could get a pension if I stopped working.\n[indecipherable] me all sorts of things, but didn\u2019t really occur to me.",
        "Q: While you were working in Germany, and perhaps even in the hospital you stayed at for so\nlong, did you ever experience anti-Semitism, post-war anti-Semitism?",
        "A: I experienced doctors who were not nice, but they never said it was because I was Jewish,\nthey said I was an American, and we had everything. And I -I\u2019m quite sure it was of religion, but\nI\u2019m not one who always finds anti-Semitism anywhere. It was unpleasant, and I was very glad\nwhen I got out of there. There I have the documentation.",
        "Q: And at the same time, did you sometimes enjoy your excursions to Munich? Were you able to\nenjoy anything in the city?",
        "A: Well, when I was in Passau in the hospital, I couldn\u2019t go out. When I came back, yes, I\nenjoyed Munich. Had nice friends, we went out a bit. But, as I say, in Munich it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s a\nbeautiful city, it\u2019s not my territory. I would never go for a vacation there. The countryside is\nbeautiful. And many, many people stayed there. Munich was the center of the DP camps, and\nalso had the big TB sanitorium, where I visited, never worked, Goljing. And we got often, people\ndischarged from there, mostly from other camps, but also from Goljing.",
        "Q: So, would you describe to me the conditions that you found each of the camps in, the ones\nthat you worked in, in Germany.",
        "A: Well, I worked only in the DP camp -- in the TB centers. I visited many of the other camps,\nand they were different. I mean, some were more luxurious than others. I remember a barracks --\nthe camps had a very good self government, which I admired, and they didn\u2019t have barbed wire\naround. If the people could leave, I don\u2019t know, I rather doubt it, because it might not\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t really recall the -- I don\u2019t know -- remember any details. I remember\ncamps as a -- probably because I never stayed there over a day, I just went in, took my history,\nand went out again.",
        "Q: So in Birishgamines, and in Passau --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- those were the two places where you spent more significant time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And those were both rehabilitation centers for TB patients?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And not displaced persons camps, per se?",
        "A: They were centers for displaced persons -- Jewish displaced persons who had tuberculosis.",
        "Q: How many patients, approximately, were in each?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, anybody who wants to know, the Joint has all these figures. I really don\u2019t\nknow -- 80?",
        "Q: And what was your routine, did you go to one per day, did you go to one and stay for the\nweek? How did you go between?",
        "A: Usually for the -- usually for the week. One week, work days in one, and the weekend, at least\ntwice a month in Munich, and then of -- to Passau. That was a very pleasant routine. I felt quite\nat home in both centers, and Munich was always full of gossip, who was going with whom. And\nonce in awhile, I could go to a museum, or do something nice.",
        "Q: Your friends in Munich, were they Jewish? Were they also doing this similar kind of work, as\nyou?",
        "A: Yeah, they were mostly Joint people, or any of the other agencies. I do not remember picking\nup anybody from Munich, or Merrano -- yeah, Merrano -- one, it was not a friend, but a person I\nwas in contact with about -- for a long time.",
        "Q: Was -- would you say it was unusual for you, as a young, now American, to come and do this\nkind of work in Europe?",
        "A: No. There are, of course, plenty of us.",
        "Q: Or as a women, in particular, I suppose.",
        "A: Wa -- again, a great many. Very often the nurses were also American. Oh, I trained nurse\u2019s\naides sometimes to [indecipherable]. I only remember we had a very nice nurse from New York,\na Jewish nurse. No, a -- UNRRA had many, many social workers, and so had the Joint. I\nwouldn\u2019t know how many, but I would guess over a hundred. They worked in every country,\nPoland, Hungary, and -- I don\u2019t know if anybody was attached directly to the army, but we\nworked very closely with the army, and we were very helpful. And the American army was\nreally very helpful to the displaced persons. The children loved the soldiers, they got chocolates.\nAnd when we called on them because there might be trouble, not very often, they were always\nhelpful. I have good experiences, as far as human beings are concerned. And I got very fond of\nthe displaced persons, because they were so courageous. They had such a will to live. You would\nthink you gonna [indecipherable] suicide or anything other -- I didn\u2019t, I saw -- we get -- we must\nget married, we must have children, otherwise Hitler has won the war. That, over and over again.\nIt really could be exasperating with this forever complaining about food. I know I once lost my\ntemper when somebody complained he hadn\u2019t gotten enough sausage, and after all, six millions\nhad been killed. And I says, \u201cThey weren\u2019t killed for you to get sausage.\u201d They were always\nthese fights. The Russian engineer, you had all sorts of people. A Russian Jewish engineer. And\nwe had sort of hostess, who was Italian Jewish. There quite a mix there in Italy. They all got,\nsomehow, along with each other.",
        "Q: How would you compare the differences between the groups of refugees in these three\ndifferent rehab centers, in Italy first, and then of course, the two in Germany.",
        "A: That was a different time. The ones in Italy were still much more under the influence of the\nwar, had many more concrete needs. We had no money, we had invented pocket money. I\nremember I would -- think it was Monday, I set a little [indecipherable] and gave out pocket\nmoney. And in Bashmine, and Passau, the war had been away a little longer, they knew a little\nbetter what would happen next. They were less aggressive, also less interested. You had much\nmore, as I remember, much more ablusionaries 1n Italy than in Germany. But I fow -- because it\nwas my first, I always felt much closer to Merrano than to Passau, in particular, I -- I never really\ngot warm with Passau, but that was my -- I didn\u2019t like to be lectured, and many things play into\nit. And I had a friend in Gola, who was above anybody, but somebody else was the director\n[indecipherable] get into question of competence, and. . . it was the only one -- I saw cotaferata\nin Italy --it was -- I only saw -- it was very pleasant. And one day, I was very courageous, I\nwanted to see Dachau, which was, of course, not in vention any more. But I overestimated my\nnerves, I simply fainted. I didn\u2019t see a thing of Dachau.",
        "Q: You entered the -- the area --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and then fainted right away?",
        "A: Yeah, right away.",
        "Q: Did someone come to your assistance?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you see any other concentration camps?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t want to. And it wasn\u2019t as fashionable as now. Now you have tourists\narrangements to see Auschwitz, etcetera. There wasn\u2019t my job.",
        "Q: Have you returned to see concentration camps in Europe?",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t see any reason why. I know enough about it, I wouldn\u2019t make\nanything better by seeing it. I haven\u2019t even been to our museum here, at the [indecipherable]\nHolocaust Museum. I would have gone to the Holocaust Museum, if I could. I would go e-\neventually to the museum here, too. They got my first forgers by that time, I didn\u2019t really have\nany contact with Washington. So they wrote, and I sent them, and I was sorry later, but\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: The refugees who were in Germany, the ones you worked with, were they primarily from\ncertain countries?",
        "A: You mean in Bashkimine? Yes, the majority was from east Europe. Poland, Romania. I can\nremember -- oh, Hungary, there\u2019s quite a few from Hungary. Not from Germany, interesting\nenough.",
        "Q: How did these refugees feel about being in Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Well, they wanted to get out of it, but again, and you can\u2019t underestimate the self-\ncenteredness people had to have to survive. And Germany -- one hated Germany, and you hope\n[indecipherable] what happen, and so on, but your main interest was to get out, and to make\nmoney, and to get well. There were -- in the three places, there were some political fanatics.\nSome against Roosevelt, others were against England, others were -- hated Germany. But they\nmade a lot of [indecipherable] noise, no other action that I can remember. But of course, there\nmay have been things they wouldn\u2019t have shared with me.",
        "Q: What sort of advice did you offer to refugees in any of the counseling sessions that you had?",
        "A: Let me pin it very much on the problem they wanted. If it was a family problem, which it\noften was, you did the usual counseling. I -- a thing I advised all of them to get into some\nworking process, be it in someplace it could help in the village [indecipherable]. And in other,\nwe had schools, in some are -- in other, Bashkimine, there was a big wi -- camp, very close,\nwhere they had very good causes, so we encouraged them to go down there. And otherwise it\nwas the usual counseling, where do you -- how do you come to der -- terms with things you don\u2019t\ncome to terms with? What ways of adjustment? Give them opportunity to talk about their\nchildhood, about their escape, trying to set their mind at ease about whatever they had done.\nListen to the good things they had done. Trying to build up the personality as much as I could.\nAnd also trying to get some sort of community council getting started [indecipherable]. Really,\npretty much what a social worker is supposed to do, but I did it as a sideline, the main things\nwere always what the day brought. Not enough sheets on the beds, or not enough peninsilino,\nstreptomycins. Could they get coffee, or decaf, or -- at remember that I organized any trips. Also,\ntrying to get the doctors, to -- who were medically trained, but not psychologically, to understand\nthe patient better.",
        "Q: Do you feel that your own training as a social worker prepared you for these roles that you\nhad to fulfill?",
        "A: Prepare? Not. My training helped me to find my personality, and to use it constructively, and\nthat helped. But the actual causes, it didn\u2019t do me any harm. Know what I mean? It\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard\nto say what you bring to the training, and what the training gives to you. It gives you discipline,\nwhich I had before. It made me understand American life better, and the social system, which 1s\nvery, very different from Europe. I certainly knew more about welfare and all these things. And\nthe mixture of being European and having American training helped me, yes.",
        "Q: Were the living conditions pretty similar in the two centers in Germany where you worked?",
        "A: From the DP\u2019s, or from me?",
        "Q: Well, mostly for the DP\u2019s.",
        "A: Yes, they were very similar. I think Merrano, because it was beautifully located, and had\nmore appealing rooms, was I think, the more cheerful setting, if a TB sanitorium can be cheerful.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff. Would you\ncontinue to tell me about differences, and similarities between the different centers. The two in\nGermany you got to know, and if you\u2019d like to compare with the one in Italy.",
        "A: Comparisons are always difficult, no matter what you compare. The thing that stands out in\nmy mind 1s that the people in Italy were closer to their real survivor experiences, and were more\nrevolutionary, and also had more of a feeling of quote, that\u2019s coming to me. And they really felt\nthat the world owed them a living. Certainly America, because it was so rich, and Germany\nbecause it had handled them so badly. As far as the camps, they were both located in pleasant\nsurroundings. I think the kooven ital -- Italy had more contact with the population of Merrano,\nthan the group in Passau had with the inhabitants of Passau. The problems were pretty much the\nsame, health, where to go to, how to handle one\u2019s past, and what the future will bring. This is an\noversimplification, but by now, some of the details have slipped my mind. What is very much on\nmy mind is the fact that many of the people who are still alive, of my rehab center population,\nare in their late 50\u2019s, I think up the end of 60, and I wonder how they will handle the process of\naging, which is something that affects all people, but I have a suspicion that it affects them\ndifferently. From my work with survivors in this country, I have seen that they pretty much go to\na second -- through a second immigration when they get older. Certainly the language that they\nhave handled rather well, through ha -- the middle years, gets to be slightly problematic again. I\nfind that older people, including me, are apt to count money in their mother tongue, which they\nhaven\u2019t done for years. Also, of course, living in a city, a big city like New York, where you\nhaven\u2019t gone to school, or know anybody from the olden days, makes you doubly lonely.\nLoneliness, of course, comes with aging, but as a survivor, you sometimes ask yourself, what do\nyou survive for? I have often heard complaints by survivors that there is nobody they went to\nschool with, no neighbors that know the streets they have walked in. And if it comes to\nmemories, most older people can escape into pleasant memories, and do, but what can the\nsurvivor escape to? Slaughter, and burning, and anxiety, and death. So, I think -- and I know that\nat the moment, studies being made about it, that there is actually a difference. Yes, the\nexperience of aging, we all have, but in a way, the survivor has it more so. Everything gets\noverly intensified.",
        "Q: Have you focused on these issues of aging among the survivor population in your work, after\nreturning from Europe, in New York?",
        "A: I have. And I have had an -- when I still had cases -- later I became an administrator, I have\nhad cases of people who were older, and my agency had a coffee house once a week, for older\nsurvivors, and that always gave me a chance to talk to different people, and as I\u2019m, in a way, one\nof them, they share it with me quite frankly, their pleasures, and their worries. And, of course,\nsickness 1s another one, where people born and raised in this country, may have a relative come\nin, or a long time friend when they need help. It\u2019s always very different -- difficult for the\nsurvivor who lives alone, to find a person who helps take care of their bookkeeping, whom they\ncan have on their living will, and all these documents that run all our lives, become problems,\nand make it suddenly clear again, yes you thought you were an American, you thought you were\nat home here, and suddenly you feel like a foreigner.",
        "Q: Id like to return to your time in Germany, and to your own living conditions.",
        "A: Okay, which --",
        "Q: So when you were in either Birishgamine, or Passau, what were the living conditions that you\nhad on a weekly basis, a daily basis, how can you give some picture of what your own conditions\nwere like?",
        "A: We were so much daily living that they almost are not conditions. I had a room. I had office\nhours from about 10 to about four. People came to me when they had question about their pocket\nmoney, when their laundry wasn\u2019t intact, or the cook was angry, somebody had sent the food\nback. So I think part of the time, I was made of all purposes, and then people had sometimes\ngotten letters from consulates in a different language, which I tried to translate. They had to\nmake official phone calls, which I made for them. And almost always, they took this opportunity\nto talk about what just worried them that particular day. They hadn\u2019t heard from an uncle in\nAmerica who was supposed to give an affidavit. The consulate hasn\u2019t let them know somebody\nhad treated them badly. There was a rumor that Australia had -- took only people in agriculture.\nWhatever came up during the day, and then in the evening sometimes, we really talked about\nolden times, how it was at home, how they had sat around the open fire, how the grandfather had\nlived with them, how different it all was when the Russians came, who came riding into the\nkitchen, and had very different ideas of civilization. Also, on the other hand, had been very\nhelpful. Many had been liberated by the Russians, who had liberated Auschwitz, and had really\nonly good things to say. Other had stories that they simply had to tell, because they\u2019ve had such\nan injustice had to be done to him. I remember a little story which is indicative. In a camp, there\nwere a husband and wife, and as most camps, as -- especially concentration camps, there was\nabsolutely nothing to eat. And one day, the husband had managed to gather two potatoes to bring\nto his wife, who was in the barrack. And it was a very wet, damp day. He tried to balance his\nway on bar -- bare feet through the ward with his two potatoes, and he was very close to home\nwhen an SS man came and just threw the potatoes out of his hand, down to the floor, into the\nmud, so that they couldn\u2019t be eaten any more. And he said, \u201cThat was one time where I cried.\u201d\nAnd I must confess, I cried when I heard the story.",
        "Q: How do you look back on the emotional reaction in you, during your time working with\nrefugees, and how -- you say you cried from this story. What other incidents really got to your\ncenter, and bothered you, disturbed you?",
        "A: The interesting thing 1s, the big stories don\u2019t upset you as much as the small ones, and the\nreason 1s, I cannot identify with thousand people being killed, but I can identify with a husband\nbeing proud to relieve the starving of his wife, and have it spoiled. And I\u2019ve always felt, when\nI\u2019m honest, it is these small things, the things that could have happened to me, in my experience,\nbecause the other things I haven\u2019t experienced. I have not lost somebody in a fire. I haven\u2019t lost\nanybody through Hitler, really, but I\u2019ve lost a much -- many other things, and I know the loss\nwere innocent. Things I have experienced are easier to ad -- identify with. There are some stories\nof escapes through snow nights. Now, I have some there from my husband, but as you will read\nthem, why should I tell them? That -- his life was full of these small stories that get you. And not\nonly me, but everybody we knew.",
        "Q: Did you feel that there was an emotional toll, or price that you had to pay to do this kind of\nwork with refugees? At the end of a day, did you reflect to yourself, and try to -- try to come up\nwith ways to look at each day with perspective?",
        "A: Yes, I try to review each day, and to see if there\u2019s something I could have done better. And\nwhen I found something, I welcome it. An emotional toll, perhaps it didn\u2019t take, because I felt\nguilty to begin with. And everything that I could do, would relieve my personal feeling of guilt. I\ncame out of it, I think a better social worker, or to b -- say it better, a better listener, because so\nmuch of the help one could give, was simply by listening with a sensitive ear. You may say a\ntrained ear, because people were so unhappy when they came to this country, that nobody\nwanted to listen to them. And they were bitter about it. And even today, the first thing one\u2019s\nbeing told, oh well, when we came to America, nobody wanted to hear us.",
        "Q: Did you keep a journal, or in any other way record your reflections?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t keep a journal, but when something really moved me, I made either a story out of it,\nbecause I liked to write, or put 1t down verbatim. I kept those notes for a long time, but I don\u2019t\nhave them any more.",
        "Q: Again, with respect to the centers, or the DP camps where you were working in Germany,\nwere there similar types of religious activities and observances, as what you saw in Merrano, and\nalso, what could you say about any of the cultural activities taking place in the camps, or centers\nin Germany?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember that we celebrated a Jewish holiday. I may not have been\nthere during holidays. I don\u2019t remember the split between Orthodox, and the assimilated that we\ndefinitely had in Merrano. You may have had several [indecipherable] in Barishkamine, not in\nPassau.",
        "Q: Do you have more distinct memories of Merrano, in comparison to the two in -- places in\nGermany?",
        "A: Yes. I think because it was the first, and I came back from my own recuperation, and I stayed\nin touch with some instructors who went later to Israel. And the young girl I mentioned to you as\nthe youngest, was later adopted by one of the doctors, and they went to Israel together, and then\nmarried a doctor, and came here, and stayed with me for some time, and I helped her find a job\nhere. Yes, Merrano has many more memories. The others, I never feeled at home, and it was\nsomehow -- it was more of a job.",
        "Q: And what time period were you, more or less, in Germany working with refugees?",
        "A: From \u201949. I think part of \u00b048, the end of \u201948. In \u201950, I came back to the States.",
        "Q: In any of these situations, whether in Italy, or in Germany, did you encounter any families\nthat were intact, any family members that had already found each other again, or was it all single\nindividuals, even if there were marriages within the camps, or the centers?",
        "A: I think there were families in [indecipherable] in the first camp, where I was a few days. I\ncannot remember -- I think husband and wife, I may have met one or two couples.",
        "Q: And in Germany, were there marriages in those camps, or centers, just as there were in Italy?",
        "A: Made a mistake, in Italy there weren\u2019t, in Germany there were.",
        "Q: Maybe I made the mistake, but . . .[ may have also gotten the wrong impression about\nsomething else. I think I was told that in one of the places you were in Germany, you were the\nonly relief worker living in the camp itself, is that true?",
        "A: These were rehab centers, and they were -- they were listed as DP camps, so I use it\nsometimes. I think everywhere I was -- no, not in Italy, but in Passau, and Barishkamine, I think\nI was the only one living there.",
        "Q: And was that a choice on your part, something that you asked for?",
        "A: I think I was the only worker, and it was [indecipherable] it was the thing to do.",
        "Q: So, in other words, when you were working with refugees, you were living amongst them, or",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then you would go on the weekends, or at some other point to Munich, is that how your\nroutine went?",
        "A: There was never a set routine, but very often I would do that, yes.",
        "Q: And again, just like I was asking with respect to the refugees 1n Italy you worked with, in\nGermany, did many of them wind up leaving the centers while you were there, and how did the\nconditions change from the point when you started, to the point when you left?",
        "A: Basically they didn\u2019t change. Some people left, their visa came through, sometimes they\nfound a relative unexpectedly, in Argentine or somewhere. The big change was, there was a\nPalestine one could go to, by -- or rather Israel one could go to. Palestine you needed the English\npermit, and didn\u2019t get it. So that opened up new hope, and the spirit was a little more hopeful\ntoward the end of my work, than in the beginning.",
        "Q: When you would take down the histories of refugees experiences, on a daily basis, were you\nsurprised and shocked from -- with what you heard, or did you go through a sort of\ntransformation during your time with this work, and --",
        "A: No. Even today, and I have taken hundreds here too, I think every history is different, and it\nwill get me, I sometimes get mad at the client in my mind, and sometimes I admire them, but\nI\u2019ve never gotten to the point where they don\u2019t touch me. They may not -- I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t\ntouch me as much as they did in the beginning. But I was very prepared for my husband\u2019s\nstories. But that came out a little later. No, I -- I never really got tired or blas\u00e9 about it.",
        "Q: And yet, weren\u2019t you often surprised? Was every day bringing something new to your\nawareness that you had not heard before?",
        "A: Not every day, but once in awhile, I did hear about a criminal act I\u2019d never heard of before, or\nsome event I had never heard of. And that overwhelmed me. There was one mention, at one\npoint, which I can\u2019t document, of somebody who claimed to have eaten human flesh. That was\nsomething I could neither understand, nor digest. I\u2019ve never heard it again, other people said it\nwas never [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did refugees talk much about war crimes trials taking place?",
        "A: Not at all. I don\u2019t know which ca -- which year the war crimes took place. Not at all.",
        "Q: In Germany, did the refugees often talk about specific perpetrators, and --",
        "A: Yes. They talked a great deal about the kapos, the people who were the supervisors in the\nconcentration camps. And they had grim stories to tell, and they would repeat the stories over\nand over again.",
        "Q: But you also heard about people who had done good things, and they remembered that too.\nPolish peasants who had survi -- had helped survive a couple. Some had survived, a couple --\nhad saved a couple\u2019s child, and some person said, \u201cNone of us would have survived, if it\nwouldn\u2019t have been for people who were helpful.\u201d I heard that from both Italian -- more Italians\nthan Poles. But also Germany, but less so.",
        "Q: Did you meet individuals from your own hometown of Hamburg?",
        "A: Once or twice, yes.",
        "Q: People you had known?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So will you tell me now how it came to pass that you left Germany, and eventually returned to\nNew York?",
        "A: Well, I guess my contract was up, and three years was long enough, and I had met my future\nhusband at that time. And the eventually hope was to go to America. And I -- I just had had -- I --\nI felt it was time to go home. I had an apartment I wasn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t know what was going on\nthere. So I came home. And [indecipherable] immigration agencies, for HIAS -- for New York\nAssociation for New Americans. Then, for a short time, I went back to the juvenile court. And\nthen I heard that my latest agency, 1959 -- in the meantime I got married -- Self Help, was\nlooking for somebody to take over for vacation. And I said Il do it. I came for three months,\nand stayed 40 years. And I worked as a caseworker first, psychiatric social worker, and\neventually ended up as deputy director. That was an agency that worked exclusively for\nsurvivors. It started with survivors from Germany, but soon became survivors from central\nEurope.",
        "Q: So you want to continue telling me about this organization you worked for, Self Help?",
        "A: Right. It was founded in 1935 by German refugees. And they founded it, and worked together\nwith the Quakers. So, in name, it is always a non-sectarian agency, but today it works only for\nJewish survivors -- that is not true, either. Anyh -- it works. It still has a section only for\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "Q: Did you get involved with restitution issues?",
        "A: As an agency, yes. We worked closely with claims conference, and the president of the claims\nconference was a board member of our agency, w-we worked very closely with all agencies, as\nanother German Jewish agency, the blue card --",
        "Q: You\u2019ve made references to the fact that you later met many of the survivors and refugees you\nhad helped. And how did those meetings usually come about? Did you take initiative to try to\ncontact them --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- or did they come to you?",
        "A: No, neither nor. Just by chance. Self Help has a great home health aide service, and people\nask for our home health aides, and they were often survivors. And Self Help, together with other\nagencies, runs quite a few apartment houses, which were originally for survivors, so I met\nsurvivors there. Then United Helpers, this the agency has a scholarship program. I met them for\nthat. And yet, there\u2019s also a German Jewish based nursing home. By now I meet quite a few\nthere.",
        "Q: What can you say about the similarities, and differences between the different organizations\nyou\u2019ve worked for through the years, that have helped refugees?",
        "A: HIAS is an immigration agency founded by Jewish people from eastern Europe, and has\nmany of it\u2019s connections in eastern Europe, and Poland, and Hungary, and so on. The American\nJoint was founded by German Jews, and it\u2019s connections are more in western Europe. Both\nagencies are immigration agencies, both work in many countries in Europe, have many\nsimilarities. There\u2019s room for both of them. Basically, they have the same goal, I think -- it\u2019s\nhard to say. I really w-would have to read the formulation of their missions to be able -- I know\nwhat the working differences is, but what\u2019s in their mission, I couldn\u2019t say. And then we have the\nJewish Federation, which funnels all these agencies. You have a small, but very effective\nGerman Jewish agency called the Blue card, which 1s a relief giving agency. The other agencies,\nbasically, are not giving relief. They help with everything else. And the Council of Jewish\nWomen, I think doesn\u2019t do anything, they used to help with immigration. And Self Help has\nbecome rowt -- right now, an all around agency, that has a -- a very large homemaker service,\nwith almost 3,000 homemaker. No, not 3,000, over a thousand homemakers, and it has five\napartment houses that it runs. It does five senior citizen centers, for the city. And in our housing,\ntoo, there weren\u2019t enough immigrants any more, so it\u2019s open now to Chinese, and everywhere,\nwho is living in that particular community.",
        "Q: I know that you mentioned this briefly earlier, but I was wondering if you could elaborate on\nsomething you mentioned in the way of survivors who you met first in DP situations in Europe --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- showing a certain perspective about their experiences, and that over the years, in meeting\nthem again, were meeting other refugees again, or for the first time even, that you\u2019ve seen a\ndifferent kind of perspective shared.",
        "A: That applies mostly to the way things are remembered.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff,\nconducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27\", 2000, in Forest Hills, New York. This is tape number\nfour, side A.",
        "A: In comparison, the more sheltered time in the DP camps is, in their memories, more positive\nthan it was when they lived there. There, the old insecurity and fear was overwhelming. Now\nthat the struggle in the outside world has been not easy, to say the least, the time in the DP camp\nis seen in rosier and rosier light. I have a friend who is writing a book, who I sometimes talk to,\nand he asked me to give him some names of people who would give him their -- their history.\nAnd I suggested them. And he said it was very difficult to get anything negative for them, they\nwere only ready to paint it in the most positive pictures. That, of course, is rather interesting, and\nmy only explanation is that life on the outside was strenuous, and makes the camp experience,\nsheltered life, not to worry about job, not to raise children, in rosier light than it really was.",
        "Q: What do you say is the long term impact on your own perspective, of having spent so many\nyears of your life working with refugees and survivors?",
        "A: I think for me it was a natural thing to do. I have never had any doubt about going into it, and\nI must say, coming out of it, I find in a way this history is a logical ending to about 40 years of\nservice, which I have given with pleasure, also with heartache, but that\u2019s part of life.",
        "Q: I believe that recently you donated a few items to the museum. Could you briefly tell me\nabout those items?",
        "A: Yeah, the one, and I think the most interesting one was a passport issued by Raoul\nWallenberg, in Hungary, to Jews. It was given to my husband, and I happen to have the original,\nand I sent it to the museum. I also sent them a picture of the sanitortum in Merrano, and one has\nthe director on it, the other our first group of graduating nurse\u2019s aides. I also sent them most\nrecently, a large snapshot of Goering, which was taken by my brother, who was asked to\ninterrogate Goering in Nuremberg. That picture came into my hand, and I thought it has a better\nplace with the museum.",
        "Q: And today you just showed me an item that Ill be sending on the museum.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You could explain that, perhaps.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t quite know how it came into my hands. I think it was really given to me by a\nfriend who had found it at a book fair. It\u2019s certainly not a historically reliable document, because\nit\u2019s strongly politically influenced, but it 1s interesting.",
        "Q: Would you just explain it? What is the actual item, just so we have on tape?",
        "A: Yeah. This is a paper booklet listing all concentration camps in greater Germany. They have\never listed some camps which I am not even sure that they were concentration camps, and they\nbroke it down to great camps, and small camps.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you would like to add?",
        "A: I would very much hope that some research will be done to the psychological adjustment of\nthe aging survivor. For instance, the influence of the history married marriages -- marriage -- that\nwill be edited out -- which had a tendency to get very difficult at the point of retirement, when\nthe couple, for the first time, really got to know each other, because they had the time. I\u2019ve seen\nthat, and I very -- I have many case histories for that. Somebody should really explore that a little\nmore. And the influence of course, of the generation differences, which is much stronger if you\nlive in the country which were -- you were not born, and where the morals, from beginning, are\ndifferent from the ones you were raised with. I think I\u2019ve said it, another point of that history,\nthis is one phase of the survivor story which has not yet been fully explored, the aging ofa\nsurvivor. None of us has as yet survived aging.",
        "Q: Thank you very much for being interviewed today. It\u2019s been a --",
        "A: Thank you for taking me. I really enjoyed it, and I\u2019m very pleased. For me, this is a very\npositive ending to something I have given much of my life to. Thank you.",

        "Q: Where was the camp that was run by the Quakers, the two summers? Where exactly was that\nlocated?",
        "Q: Okay. So, after that experience, the experience with the camps, the two summers in a row,\nthen eventually, you were able to work in Oswego with refugees, and that work there, what was\nyour daily responsibilities?",

        "Q: What would you say you were able to learn about the war, or other events taking place in\nEurope, from the refugees, that you had not learned elsewhere?",
        "Q: Did Roosevelt\u2019s death also represent great uncertainty?",
        "Q: Were there cultural or religious activities in the camp? I believe you already mentioned\nconcerts, so there were some cultural activities.",

        "Q: What was the process like in becoming a citizen?",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff,\nconducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in Forest Hills, New York. This is tape number two,\nside A. On the last tape, we were speaking about your time in Oswego, and -- where you were\nworking with refugees, and now perhaps you can tell me what you did after you finished your\ntime in Oswego.",

        "Q: Did you start learning other languages yourself?",
        "Q: So I just want to establish the setting of this experience, not necessarily at camp, but more like\na rehabilitation center, as you call it. Was it wintertime? And exactly when did you arrive there,\nor as best as you can recall, month and year?",

        "Q: I think you already made some kind of reference to the kinds of discussions that you had with\nrefugees, and whether or not they wanted to talk about their past. Did they more often want to\ntalk about the war time experiences in comparison to their past before the war?",
        "Q: Were there any instances where you knew that it was wrong to do something, but you knew\nthat it -- in the end it would help someone, so you did it?",

        "Q: In the rehabilitation center in Italy, where you were, in Merrano --",
        "Q: Correct? You mentioned there was a German chef, someone who was not Jewish?",
        "Q: And was that unusual, for there to be someone German?",
        "Q: Okay. Were there other Germans working then at the camp, or at the center in -- in Germany\nwhere you were?",
        "Q: Or is that chef the only one?",
        "Q: Were there any tensions with the chef and refugees who might not have felt comfortable with\na -- a German there?",

        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff,\nconducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in Forest Hills, New York. This is tape number\nthree, side A. I wanted to ask you where you were living during your time helping refugees in\nMerrano?",
        "Q: So in Merrano you were not living amongst the refugees, is that -- is that correct?",
        "Q: Were you successful in helping to find family members for the refugees in Merrano?",
        "Q: And I know we spoke earlier about some of the religious holidays that were observed. Any\nparticular cultural events in Merrano, in the center?",
        "Q: Were there any commemorative events, for events that had taken place during the war, such\nas the Warsaw ghetto uprising, for example?",
        "Q: Were refugees asked to do some work in this rehabilitation center?",
        "Q: And in addition to that, were they asked to take care of any of the administration of the center,\nor help in any of the duties?",
        "Q: How did that situation differ from what you saw in Oswego? Were there more refugees there\nworking to help the camp stay afloat in Oswego, compared to Merrano?",
        "Q: So now would you tell me about you departure from Merrano, and what you did after?",
        "Q: How was that experience?",
        "Q: Did you see a great deal of devastation from the war?",
        "Q: Did you feel very different about being in Germany, than when you had been in Italy, right\nbefore?",
        "Q: When did you meet him, when was that that you returned to Merrano?",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Merrano at that point?",
        "Q: After you recovered from the car accident, were you still enthusiastic about returning to do\nthe ru -- refugee work?",
        "Q: While you were working in Germany, and perhaps even in the hospital you stayed at for so\nlong, did you ever experience anti-Semitism, post-war anti-Semitism?",
        "Q: And at the same time, did you sometimes enjoy your excursions to Munich? Were you able to\nenjoy anything in the city?",
        "Q: So, would you describe to me the conditions that you found each of the camps in, the ones\nthat you worked in, in Germany.",
        "Q: So in Birishgamines, and in Passau --",
        "Q: -- those were the two places where you spent more significant time.",
        "Q: And those were both rehabilitation centers for TB patients?",
        "Q: And not displaced persons camps, per se?",
        "Q: How many patients, approximately, were in each?",
        "Q: And what was your routine, did you go to one per day, did you go to one and stay for the\nweek? How did you go between?",
        "Q: Your friends in Munich, were they Jewish? Were they also doing this similar kind of work, as\nyou?",
        "Q: Was -- would you say it was unusual for you, as a young, now American, to come and do this\nkind of work in Europe?",
        "Q: Or as a women, in particular, I suppose.",
        "Q: How would you compare the differences between the groups of refugees in these three\ndifferent rehab centers, in Italy first, and then of course, the two in Germany.",
        "Q: You entered the -- the area --",
        "Q: -- and then fainted right away?",
        "Q: Did someone come to your assistance?",
        "Q: Did you see any other concentration camps?",
        "Q: Have you returned to see concentration camps in Europe?",
        "Q: The refugees who were in Germany, the ones you worked with, were they primarily from\ncertain countries?",
        "Q: How did these refugees feel about being in Germany\u2019?",
        "Q: What sort of advice did you offer to refugees in any of the counseling sessions that you had?",
        "Q: Do you feel that your own training as a social worker prepared you for these roles that you\nhad to fulfill?",
        "Q: Were the living conditions pretty similar in the two centers in Germany where you worked?",
        "Q: Well, mostly for the DP\u2019s.",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff. Would you",
        "Q: Have you focused on these issues of aging among the survivor population in your work, after\nreturning from Europe, in New York?",
        "Q: Id like to return to your time in Germany, and to your own living conditions.",
        "Q: So when you were in either Birishgamine, or Passau, what were the living conditions that you\nhad on a weekly basis, a daily basis, how can you give some picture of what your own conditions\nwere like?",
        "Q: How do you look back on the emotional reaction in you, during your time working with\nrefugees, and how -- you say you cried from this story. What other incidents really got to your\ncenter, and bothered you, disturbed you?",
        "Q: Did you feel that there was an emotional toll, or price that you had to pay to do this kind of\nwork with refugees? At the end of a day, did you reflect to yourself, and try to -- try to come up\nwith ways to look at each day with perspective?",
        "Q: Did you keep a journal, or in any other way record your reflections?",
        "Q: Again, with respect to the centers, or the DP camps where you were working in Germany,\nwere there similar types of religious activities and observances, as what you saw in Merrano, and\nalso, what could you say about any of the cultural activities taking place in the camps, or centers\nin Germany?",
        "Q: Do you have more distinct memories of Merrano, in comparison to the two in -- places in\nGermany?",
        "Q: And what time period were you, more or less, in Germany working with refugees?",
        "Q: In any of these situations, whether in Italy, or in Germany, did you encounter any families\nthat were intact, any family members that had already found each other again, or was it all single\nindividuals, even if there were marriages within the camps, or the centers?",
        "Q: And in Germany, were there marriages in those camps, or centers, just as there were in Italy?",
        "Q: Maybe I made the mistake, but . . .[ may have also gotten the wrong impression about\nsomething else. I think I was told that in one of the places you were in Germany, you were the\nonly relief worker living in the camp itself, is that true?",
        "Q: And was that a choice on your part, something that you asked for?",
        "Q: So, in other words, when you were working with refugees, you were living amongst them, or",
        "Q: And then you would go on the weekends, or at some other point to Munich, is that how your\nroutine went?",
        "Q: And again, just like I was asking with respect to the refugees 1n Italy you worked with, in\nGermany, did many of them wind up leaving the centers while you were there, and how did the\nconditions change from the point when you started, to the point when you left?",
        "Q: When you would take down the histories of refugees experiences, on a daily basis, were you\nsurprised and shocked from -- with what you heard, or did you go through a sort of\ntransformation during your time with this work, and --",
        "Q: And yet, weren\u2019t you often surprised? Was every day bringing something new to your\nawareness that you had not heard before?",
        "Q: Did refugees talk much about war crimes trials taking place?",
        "Q: In Germany, did the refugees often talk about specific perpetrators, and --",
        "Q: But you also heard about people who had done good things, and they remembered that too.\nPolish peasants who had survi -- had helped survive a couple. Some had survived, a couple --\nhad saved a couple\u2019s child, and some person said, \u201cNone of us would have survived, if it\nwouldn\u2019t have been for people who were helpful.\u201d I heard that from both Italian -- more Italians\nthan Poles. But also Germany, but less so.",
        "Q: Did you meet individuals from your own hometown of Hamburg?",
        "Q: People you had known?",
        "Q: So will you tell me now how it came to pass that you left Germany, and eventually returned to\nNew York?",
        "Q: So you want to continue telling me about this organization you worked for, Self Help?",
        "Q: Did you get involved with restitution issues?",
        "Q: You\u2019ve made references to the fact that you later met many of the survivors and refugees you\nhad helped. And how did those meetings usually come about? Did you take initiative to try to\ncontact them --",
        "Q: -- or did they come to you?",
        "Q: What can you say about the similarities, and differences between the different organizations\nyou\u2019ve worked for through the years, that have helped refugees?",
        "Q: I know that you mentioned this briefly earlier, but I was wondering if you could elaborate on\nsomething you mentioned in the way of survivors who you met first in DP situations in Europe --",
        "Q: -- showing a certain perspective about their experiences, and that over the years, in meeting\nthem again, were meeting other refugees again, or for the first time even, that you\u2019ve seen a\ndifferent kind of perspective shared.",

        "Q: I believe that recently you donated a few items to the museum. Could you briefly tell me\nabout those items?",
        "Q: And today you just showed me an item that Ill be sending on the museum.",

        "Answer: My name is Gabriele D. Schiff. I was born in Hamburg, Germany, on October fifth,\n1914.",
        "A: I was born to a physician and his wife. We had a very assimilated home life. I was the\nyoungest of four children. I went to high school, as far as I could get in Germany. It was all\nunder the Whymar Republic, which of course, 1933, was taken over by Hitler, and my schooling,\nat least my formal schooling, came to an end. And at that time, one had to think slowly, about\npreparation for leaving Germany. I was about 16 at the time, and it was a very difficult Germany,\nand the most uneasy time for Jews, but an e -- uneasy time for Germany, all around. Vesters,\nstrikes, and on the whole, you are looking how to create a future. My first job, as I always\nwanted to be a social worker, from my seventh year on, I became a secretary in a Jewish girl\u2019s\norphanage. And at that time, it became clear that the girls who had no German passports, mostly\nof them Polish orphans, would be sent back to Poland. It was partly my job to help prepare the\nchildren for a life that we really couldn\u2019t foresee, but it certainly meant separation, separation\nfrom the place they knew, as well as if they had relatives, separation from relatives, into the\nunknown. I have done that about a year, and then decided to better learn England, prepare --\nEnglish -- to prepare for eventual immigration. I went to England, and tried to learn shorthand\nand typing. I never did very well. I worked in household, but then a letter came from a colleague\nin Hamburg, telling me that there were still so many children that could possibly go out --\ncorrection, not so many, but some. And I decided, against anybody\u2019s advice, to go back to\nGermany. And I stayed in Germany for about a year, and again, helped children, also worked for\nthe German Jewish community. It\u2019s interesting that even though we had very assimilated, from\nthe very beginning, my 50 year career in social work, was almost all in Jewish social work. I\nprepared for my immigration, which was very difficult for many reasons, which perhaps we\ndon\u2019t have to go into. The secret police at one time got hold of me, which was not a pleasant\nexperience. They took my passport away, and eventually I got out of Germany, because one of\nmy English friends, a former boyfriend, wrote me a fake letter that he was going to marry me,\nand I would become an English citizen, and set a date for our marriage. And at that point, I got\nmy passport back, and left in a hurry. Again, I stayed in England for a very short time. I didn\u2019t\nwork. By that time my mother and my oldest brother had immigrated to England, and so it was a\nbit of a family reunion. It\u2019s all not [indecipherable] clear in my memory, but somewhat like it.\nAnd my brother from America, where I als -- also had a brother, came. He was a lawyer here,\nworking for the office of Price Administration, he must have been the levelator. Anyhow, he\npicked me up, and we came together to America. And it was a little funny story when I arrived\nhere. People who thought I\u2019d gone into the wilderness in America, my aunts, etcetera, had given\nme, of all things, tea kettles. So when I arrived here, and the customs opened my stuff, I was\nsurrounded by the tea kettles, and the customs official looked at me and said, \u201cGolly, what do\nyou want to do? Trade with the Indians?\u201d That\u2019s the beginning of America.",
        "A: In 1937, in September.",
        "A: No, we were very assimilated. Yes, proforma -- it\u2019s a harsh word, but we did observe Rosh\nHashanah and Yom Kippur. Actually, I still do it, even though my life had gone up and down in\nbetween. And we were an upper class, very well known family. And what you did was always\nbeing looked at by others. But, I should mention my mother -- and I\u2019ve inherited that from her,\nliked to help people, and she always volunteered. And she had what she called office hours in\nour house, and she would counsel people. And as a child of seven, I was sitting under the table,\nlistening to these stories, and that\u2019s why I decided I wanted to help. And another -- and that\u2019s the\nlast story of my past, we had a big house, and I had a governess, as ever -- anybody had to, had a\nlittle money in Germany. And I was always afraid when the governess had the day out, and I was\nalone in the big house. So my father, to comfort me one day, bought me a big, chocolate teddy\nbear, and said that, \u201cHe\u2019Il keep you company.\u201d I didn\u2019t want chocolate bear, I wanted somebody\nto talk to. So I cried. So my father, who was a little impatient, said, \u201cWell, you are but spoiled.\nThere are many poor children who have no teddy bears.\u201d I said nothing, and I thought. Day\nbefore, we had taken a walk, and my governess had said, \u201cLet\u2019s walk slowly here,\u201d no,\ncorrection again, \u201c\u2018let\u2019s walk fast, because this is where the poor children live.\u201d So, I thought,\nteddy bear, poor children. So during afternoon, I ran around, back to that neighborhood with my\nchocolate bear, and when I saw a little girl that looked poor to me, pressed the chocolate teddy\nbear into her arms. Once later, my mother was playing bridge, and one of her partners said, \u201cOur\nneighborhood is changing, because an absolutely strange girl walked up to my little daughter,\nand gave her a teddy bear.\u201d And I always say, \u201cI have spent my life giving teddy bears to the\nwrong people.\u201d",
        "A: Four. Four children.",
        "A: No. One of four.",
        "A: The youngest.",
        "A: Yeah, we were very lucky, we all got out of Germany, but not together. We have never been\ntogether again as a family. My mother left a little later than I did, to England, which she lived --\nlet\u2019s see, she left after Crystal night, and only got out because my Dutch brother-in-law came\nfrom Paris to take her out with the help of the Dutch consulate. He came, and he was politically\nquite on the left, and had brought quite a few fake Dutch passports, and got out two or three well\nknown writers, who were in concentration camp. One of them, Eric Musam, some people may be\ninterested him, he was later killed, but he got him out. So [indecipherable].",
        "A: Who hasn\u2019t? Yes, and I only gi -- I had all -- I -- I had, as everybody else did, I remember\nwell my first encounter, when I was, well, maybe 12. I had a girlfriend, very blonde, and very\nAryan, and her father was an architect, and we were quote, best friends, end quote. And from one\nday to another, she said, with tears in her eyes, \u201cMy father forbade me to play with you any\nlonger, because you are Jewish, and he belongs to a certain German organization, and would be a\ndanger for him if his daughter is running around with a Jewish girl.\u201d That was my very first --\nand, I had to give you all these things you get from everybody, because of course, you met it\neverywhere, from your greengrocer -- and you met the other, too, people who stood up for you,\nand perhaps a most outstanding one was we had a super in our house, and he denounced my\nmother to the Secret Police, and denounced me, too, because I had a non-Jewish boyfriend,\nwhich was against the Nuremberg laws. So, I mean, we had our share of this, but compared what\nlater on happened in eastern Europe, it\u2019s all chicken feed. No [indecipherable]",
        "A: Cause New York is overwhelming if you come from Germany, and my family -- I had an aunt\nhere, who was very well-to-do, and was very nice to me, but I didn't fit into that type of society\nat all. I looked European, English was bad, politically I was too much interested in Social\nDemocrats. They were very nice to me, but I didn\u2019t want to play the role of a poor relative, that\u2019s\njust not in me. And I had a Quaker friend in Philadelphia, who was a teacher of music. And we\nhad been through a lot in Hamburg together, we had gone to school together. So I phoned her,\nand said, \u201cEtta, please get me a job, any job.\u201d And she came through. And I lived in the house of\na lovely Quaker family, where my friend Etta also had a room. And I did a little a-around the\nhouse. I\u2019m really not very well trained in that respect, but they were very good pe -- were\nactually lovely people. I took a little bit care of children. And money I didn\u2019t have. Furs I had,\nbut no money. And the man of the house, who was a lawyer, professor of law, discovered that I\nhave a usable brain. And he thought to get anywhere in this country, I would have to study, and\nget at least a Bachelor. And he gave me a chance just try for a scholarship in a very good\nAmerican college in Swarthmore, which has helped me for the rest of my life. And they again\nwere very nice, because they believed me. I had my examination for the university in Germany,\nwhich I didn\u2019t have, but I said I had lost it. And I could make up for it in an examination, I\npassed with very good grades, and so I got through Swarthmore in two years. That, of course,\nwas a big help, because then, during those two years, I used my furniture, rented an apartment\nwith borrowed money, and sublet rooms to other students. And that way, I got through college. I\njust missed feeb -- Phi Beta Kappa, which I\u2019m really angry about, because I had the cooking to\ndo for -- and I had it easy because I majored in English, which was not in English literature, but I\nminored in German, so it meant I could concentrate on my major. And later on, I took\npsychology.",
        "A: Never left my mind. I did not tell you that before I even mentioned Swarthmore, I had gone to\nthe Pennsylvania School of Social Work, who had told me I could not study social work if I\nwouldn\u2019t have an America Bachelor. It was very different times, and that was one reason why I\nwas so glad to go to Swarthmore. And the day I had my Bachelor, I went back to the University\nof Pennsylvania, I say, \u201cHere I am, please let me in.\u201d They were very psychologically oriented at\nthat time, and they seriously said to me, \u201cWell, you know, you will have to work with people\nwho know pain, and suffering. And to know that, you have to know it yourself. Did you ever\nhave any suffering and pain?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, I just left my family in Europe, I make a very\nprecarious living here. I\u2019ve met many good things, but I\u2019ve also met [indecipherable]",
        "A: I recall having a lot of anxiety. Not so much fear, which is very much related. I didn\u2019t think I\nwould not get through, that never occurred to me. But I didn\u2019t know how.",
        "A: To be honest, I was so concentrating on daily life, that it was not very real to me. I knew what\nwas going on in Germany. I was dead sure, if I\u2019d ever become a citizen, I would go and try to\nhelp rebuild. I felt guilty. I was safe, and my friends were not. I was in close contact with the\nQuakers, who were the only organization, I believe, who could, at that time, get into Germany,\neven could -- and get into the camps. And they, at that time, were starting their so-called refugee\nsection, and they ask me to work in it, and to set it up. And so I knew particularly about\nGermany, that people had lost their jobs, difficulties in getting out, were taken to camps, but if\nI\u2019m very honest, for instance, Crystal night is not in my memory as the overwhelming experience\nit was, becu -- I think like, human beings, and young ones, you think about studying, about your\nboyfriends, about whatever the day brings. Yes, it\u2019s all going on in Germany, and you also -- at\nleast I was, a little bit cruel, and you thought, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t these people get out?\u201d Later on, I\n[indecipherable] they couldn\u2019t, but I was somewhat mixed up in my thinking. It came back more\nand more when I -- at the refugee section, as my daily bread, and had to write and answer letters\nfrom Germany, people pleading for so-called affidavits. And while I was working with Quakers,\nI was sent to get affidavits, and I was, of all things, going to Iowa. Now, imagine this German\nJewish girl, with fairly good English, but still not -- still the the English English. I was sent to\nfarmers, who in their turn had rarely heard of Jews. So we had a great time not -- of learning\neach other. They showed me their farm, and they showed me everything they a -- and they talk\nwith thee and thou, as the Quakers does. And whatever they showed me, I\u2019d never seen before.\nAnd the very nice old farmer got a little impatient, and showed me a cow, and said, \u201cDid thee\never see a cow?\u201d",
        "A: The latter I can answer first one. Probably in \u00b038 - \u201939. It\u2019s vague, but I think so, because \u201939,\nI went to college, so 1t must have been before \u201939. What was your question?",
        "A: I was charged to get affidavits of support for refugees who were still in Europe, and wanted to\ncome to this country. And somebody had to guarantee that they would not become a charge of\nwelfare. And I got quite a few affidavits, because I could plead my cause. I had seen it. And I did\nthat, really until I went to college, working for the Quakers, being a counselor in a refugee camp.\nNow, this was a Quaker camp for refugees who had already arrived in this country.",
        "A: In Nyak, New York.",
        "A: Sure. The people who were there, were very often couples where one part was not Jewish, or\na -- some were political refugees, and not Jewish. The Quakers helped everybody. The majority\nhad Jewish blood, it was not that they were -- I don\u2019t think we had an Orthodox Jew in the camp.\nBut it was comparatively young people, it were majority professional people, who needed\nretraining in this country, and the director of that camp was a minister. That was a -- an\ninteresting experience for me, and I learned a lot. And the camp was run like all camps, there\u2019s\nlots of language classes, and community interest. Some sport, but very little, the people had other\ninterest at that kind than sport. Was a lot of writing to find where relatives were, and you\n[indecipherable]. There, you never forget -- forgot that there was a war. I mean, not the war\n[indecipherable], but there was liberation for a war. And it had the most intellectual group that\nI\u2019ve ever met in camps. Oh gosh, I have another camptery. Okay, a -- and I know that I wrote\nwhat I called a national hymn for that camp, which we sang for [indecipherable]. I can\u2019t sing, I\ndon\u2019t know music, but I wrote it. And --",
        "A: No. I know where the camp was, Sky Island on the Hudson, and that was a refrain of it,\neverything was beautiful in Sky Island of the Hudson, [indecipherable]. I threw all that stuff out,\ntoday it would be interesting.",
        "A: I really can\u2019t -- can only guess a hundred, wild guess.",
        "A: Two summers. It only existed during the summer, for people who couldn\u2019t afford a real\nvacation, and who needed an effer -- American atmosphere. The food was so American, they had\ndifficulty in eating -- well, it was very well meant, very human, and was in the estate of an\nAmerican psychiatrist, who still is around, Dr. Viola Bernard. She still may be [indecipherable]\nthe museum. She\u2019s not Jewish, but very, very interested. And she had a beautiful estate, and the\nfaucets were sort of heads of lions, so you can imagine. Okay, so much for that. And after one\nsummer, in \u00b039, I started college. And in college, I had to run interesti -- I had many lovely,\nlovely experiences. But one experience that fits is, I was a -- later on -- is that true? No, doesn\u2019t\nhappen in college, comes a little later. So I graduated, made many friends. Was interesting to me,\nthat there, we really didn\u2019t know who was Jewish, and who was not. You know, that was such a\ndifference. I was a rarity at that time, because refugees weren\u2019t so many at that time. And I\nknow, I get along with people, and I had a great time, and eventually I graduated, in \u201941. And\nthere was no question I\u2019d go to school of social work, I got another scholarship, which meant\nanother job on the side, but these things are typical for an immigre. And I kept my apartment\nwith my furniture, I rented a room -- separate rooms. And began to be more involved with\nrefugee questions. I had a room mate who was very much on the left political, and didn\u2019t let me\nforget that it was Fascists who did all this. And we were very young. And I always get involved\nin strange things, so I was -- well -- political involvements, so stay out of it. And I found life\nvery interesting, got much more Americanized. Had a very easy time in school of social work.\nMy placement was with the children\u2019s agency, and it all seemed to me very easy. I don\u2019t know\nwhy they made so much fuss about it. The only bad thing was, I had in the morning, and in the\nevening, to travel for over an hour, through all of Philadelphia. So much for that. I still was in\ntouch with the Quakers, I still have them out with the refugee faction. And I always have had a\ngreat respect and love for the Quakers, but never wanted to convert, because I always thought,\nyou don\u2019t run away from something that\u2019s difficult into something that\u2019s easier. So the Quakers\nwere asked by the War Education Authority -- this is now 41. Don\u2019t hold me to the dates. Not\n41, I had a -- nonsense. \u201943, I graduated from school of social work. There is something I don\u2019t\nremember, and that\u2019s what -- I think right after school, I went to Maryland, to the state hospital,\nbecause I was more and more interested in psychiatric social work. And I spent one difficult year\nin a state hospital near Sikesville, Maryland. And that was a -- hospital of about 3,000 patients,\nand five physicians. And there I became very much aware of Europe and it\u2019s difficulties, because\nthe majority of our five physicians had come from Europe, and had escaped Hitler. And there\nwere also one Jewish physician who was American. And I told you, I get involved, sometimes I\nalso in the wrong place. I became, in my free time, the director of the recreation for our camp of\n-- of conscientious objectors. I could wro -- write a book about it if I want. And that was not\nliked by the American attendants, because they had their husbands in the war, here was this one\nJewish female, and she was playing around with the people who were trying to escape war duty,\nand messed up situation, I was in between vics. And the Jewish doctor, saw me going with my\nCO friends, a whole unit of them, singing Christmas carols. He called me to his office, and sa --\nand said, \u201cIf I wouldn\u2019t be punished, I would spank you. You are no [indecipherable]. You tried\nto be a Christian,\u201d -- which I never tried, I just like to go around with some [indecipherable].\nAnd he gave me hell. So I got it from Jewish side.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: What, of course, I remember first of all, was that I was suddenly an enemy alien. I\u2019d been\nthrown out of my country, to come to America, and find myself an enemy alien. I could not have\na camera, I could not have a short wave radio. And for every trip, I had to get permission from\nWashington, which means my brother, who was in Washington, working for the government, I\ncould only go and see him with special permission, which I got. I didn\u2019t go too often, but he\ncame to me. I -- these are individual things. My outstanding best friends at that time, were the\ndirector of the labor relations board in Philadelphia, and his wife. And they were ardent pacifists.\nAnd on the day the we -- war broke out, they asked me, \u201cHow do you feel about it?\u201d And\nimpulsively, I said, \u201cI\u2019m glad that,\u201d -- now this is when America got into the war, -- \u201cthat\nAmerica is getting into the war, because that will give the allies more power.\u201d And they looked\nat me in disgust, and said, \u201cHow can you be glad about any war?\u201d And I said, \u201cIs it better when\npeople are slaughtered in camps? Do you want that to go on for eternity?\u201d So we had a very long\ndiscussion. We stayed friends afterwards, and we both kept our opinions. They were pacifists. I\nhad been a pacifist for a good time of my life. As a matter of fact, when in Germany, I was the\nyoungest member of the [indecipherable] for Human Rights. So, that will always be my interest.\nBut, I changed when Hitler came, and I gave up the pacifist, I just couldn\u2019t. But that\u2019s my\noutstanding memory. And then, of course, it was the anxiety, I couldn\u2019t get letters from Europe. I\nhad heard so much about the first World War, because I was born in the beginning. But when I\nwas five and six, the memory was still very strong, my parents, and [indecipherable]. So, I knew\nwhat was going to happen, and I also had a ration book during the war, but I suppose everybody\nhad it. I don\u2019t know, I was in an institution, in that camp -- no, in the state hospital, and we got\nvery little to eat, but I realized it was still much more than they had in Europe. And then, of\ncourse, I had very strong sympathies for the allies, and once in awhile, I got letters smuggled\nfrom England, or from my sister in France. I suffer always for some contact, somebody asked me\nthis question. I don\u2019t remember if the letters were censored or not. I don\u2019t think I ever was out of\ncontact with my mother. I looked -- I kept my mother\u2019s address, but not the war time, one, so I --\nI really don\u2019t know. I remember how I threw my camera into a river, because I wasn\u2019t permitted\nto have it. Why I didn\u2019t give it to an American colleague, I don\u2019t know. And I -- I did not have\ntoo many Jewish friends while I was in Philadelphia. I had roo -- Jewish room mates, but one\nwas American, and as I implied, very much on the left. The other was also from Germany, and\nvery assimilated. And so certainly we were interested, we read the papers, and we hoped that war\nwould be over. But we also tried very hard to live from day to day. Now, this changed for me in\n1943 or four. I\u2019m really not good with figures. When the War Education asked me -- War\nEducation Authority, to go to Oswego, New York. And Oswego was a camp, it was a former\narmy camp that had barracks, and awful ones. And there\u2019s barbed wire around. It always amazes\nme, the only time I personally have been in the camp, with barbed wire, and real barracks, was in\nAmerica. Because I was always insisted on living right in the camps, because you can\u2019t be of\nhelp if you are billeted in a hotel outside. And these were a thousand refugees, who had been in -\n- yeah, it was called concentration camps, but were not extermination camps, in Italy. One was\ncalled Perramonte, just for your information. And the refugees, the majority, by far, were Jewish.\nI think we had about five non-Jewish people, but we had some. We had some Ukrainians. And\nDr. Ruth Gruber, who was the assistant to all [indecipherable] acres, who was an -- high in the\ngovernment, had been sent to Europe to select from different camps, a thousand refugees. These\nhad been invited by President Roosevelt, with the idea that Italy was starving, and he would at --\nat least take a thousand mouths out. Well, it\u2019s really not a very bright idea, but it helped a\nthousand people. And they were invited to -- the whole time, they didn\u2019t know if they could stay\nin this country. And what that means psychologically, you can\u2019t do it -- can\u2019t imagine. Actually,\none was sent back because he was insane. The others eventually stayed here, in \u201945. And I\u2019ve\nmet them over the -- my career in social work, all over the place. And that was my first camp ex\n-- no -- well, the other was a vacation camp, this was a camp with all the difficulties of a camp.\nPeople not having any privacy. Some people died. One person died shoveling snow. The\nadministration was blamed for that. I got an [indecipherable] to later camp life. The food was\nalways [indecipherable], it\u2019s always in camps. People have to have an outlet for all their feelings,\nso they fight for food. We had a few birth. We had a hospital run by a Jewish laf -- doctor, who\nwas supervised by Dr. Ruth, who had already an MD in America. In the hospital, I had an\noperation, and I remember my refugee doctor very well. However, it went all right. It was an ope\n-- operation, an appendix, and they found an ovary was -- they took out an ovary that shouldn\u2019t\nhave taken out [indecipherable] forget. And I stayed in that camp, almost through the end. I think\nI left a month before. People eventually got the permission to stay. Most of them came to New\nYork. Ruth Gruber co-wrote a book about Oswego, \u201cSafe Haven.\u201d I disagree with the book, but\nanyhow --",
        "A: I -- Because she saw a side from the point of view of a rather optimistic American. She\nworked very hard, I mean, she really -- she helped. These people wouldn\u2019t have been here\nwithout her, but how she described the camp, I don\u2019t quite agree with. I saw more conflict than\nshe did. But ac -- but we are still good friends, I still see her, and Oswego people have also\n[indecipherable] word?",
        "A: Community. They meet once in awhile, cause we all are old people now. And some of them\ndied, some of them have grandchildren. The grandchildren I met in my last job, and some of\nthem, because in that job, among other things, I ran a scholarship committee for refugee, and\nsecond and third generation. And suddenly, some of my Oswego grandchildren turned up.\n[indecipherable], they are very bright, and good students. Europeans know how to study. So, you\nsee, that\u2019s why I say my life is so interwoven, one with each other, Quakers from all occasional\n[indecipherable] etcetera.",
        "A: I tell you, my girlfriend, whom I knew from school, was a Quaker, and was a daughter of the\ndeeding Quaker in Germany. Somebody writes a book about it, and interviewed me. So, through\nher, it was natural that I met other Quakers. And I met a professor of social work, Hetta Calls,\nfrom Czechoslovakia. She was a professor of social work in Bryn Mawr, and for quite some time\nI stayed in her house, and she was a president at that time, or the founder of this refugee section,\nand she knew that I knew typing, a little shorthand. And she introduced me as her secretary to the\nAmerican Friend Service Committee in Philadelphia. And I was very lucky, I got to know Rufus\nJones, and Kelly, and learned to loved, and admired a lot. And met my first -- I was a refugee of\n-- myself at that time, really in the camp. What I had to do as a secretary was really mostly\nwriting letters, trying to search for people, trying to get affidavits, trying to talk to lawyers. A\nlittle bit helping people to adjust. Helping them to get lessons for car driving. Women didn\u2019t\nreally know how to drive. I don\u2019t know how to -- not today. And it was not that common in\nGermany, or Austria. The refugees at that time are mostly from Germany -- not in the camp\nOswego, but what I imagine Philadelphia was pretty much German Jewish [indecipherable].",
        "A: In Nyak, N-y-a-k, New York. It\u2019s how -- it\u2019s about an hour from here, upstate, in\nWestchester.",
        "A: Taking histories, in case people could stay in this country. Taking histories for the sponsoring\nagency. Helping people to adjust to camp life. No European knows camp. And that men should\ndo the cooking, don\u2019t tell me. And to see that the hospital functioned. We were just -- every\nreligion had a -- a -- [indecipherable] what\u2019s the word?",
        "A: No, it had a person from every religion was a social worker. [indecipherable] one wa --",
        "A: Yes, [indecipherable]. And also a -- a Jewish agency. I was really quick repre-representative\nthere. The Jewish agency admaroon became my best friend, she just died. And the Catholic had\none, too. And there were lots and lots of adjustment question. People had left their homes, didn\u2019t\nknow where the other person was, the family was torn. A -- and as I say, we had to take very\ncomplete histories for the government, no personal really, but there you had to know the facts,\nand the facts were not too well known. And -- and they had had the camp experience in Italy, and\nsome had illnesses, and some had venereal illnesses, and we suddenly had the last\n[indecipherable]. You had to ha -- make the things work, you know? The idea, to be behind\nwired bar -- barbed wire, we had -- we had to be in this free country, in a camp. So it was really\npsychiatric social work, and immigration work.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Hard to say. We had about -- we had a director, and a deputy director, American. We had\nabout four social worker. We had a head nurse, and I think some other nurses. We had teachers,\nwe had -- no -- no teachers there, the children could go out of camp to school. It was a fight, but\nwe got to school. We were always fighting. I think that\u2019s about what was there, and then all sorts\nof people came from other agencies to study these strange animals from Europe. But the biggest\ngroup was Polish, and the second group was Yugoslav, and they couldn\u2019t stand each other. And\nwe also had a non-Jewish prince from Lithuania, who got into fis -- a fist fight with somebody\nelse, because they both thought they were princes. I mean, anything and everything possible. We\ndid have a library, we did have lectures, we did have good concerts, there were good musicians\namong the group. It was daily living. Was a lot of anxiety.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yugoslavia, Poland, Austria, Germany. But were far the most from Yugoslavia, and Poland.",
        "A: Newly born, to about 90. We had children being born there. So we had kindergarten also. The\nage range was really everything that had been in camp in Italy, and they had it all ages, like.",
        "A: At that time, over 50 seemed elderly to me. I can\u2019t remember real old people, my age, for\ninstance, my age now. I can\u2019t remember. I remember mostly 1 -- in their 20\u2019s, and then in their\n50\u2019s, but --",
        "A: I had a room, we all had rooms. Not in the barrack, as far as I remember. I cannot remember\nwhere we ate, I think 1t was in a mutual dining room where all the staff ate. I lately think it was\nall in a private house, where the officers had lived, when it was a military camp. But, I remember\nwell my little room, but funny, you know how [indecipherable]",
        "A: Both. I made good friends among my colleagues, still went on -- until now, I mean, we are\nnow older, have died ,or God knows what. And about the refugees, I also made friends. And that\nwas quite acceptable, not in all camps I\u2019ve worked in, but this was quite acceptable. I had a\nyoung man interested in me in that time, and so had my colleague. It was all very romantic, and\nwe got to know them very well, and some of them, on later stages, became my clients. One -- for\ninstance, my agency, when I say my agency, I mean Self Help. I worked 39 years, so it sort of\nbecame mine, build a house here in Cos-Cosina Boulevard for displaced persons, and -- a big\napartment house. And one of the first people to move in was a client from -- of mine, from\nOswego. So ways always cross again.",
        "A: Pretty much from beginning to end, just in a year.",
        "A: Yeah, from \u201944, to \u00b045.",
        "A: Yes. Wallit -- well, the government paid me. No idea what, but they did pay me.",
        "A: Just my heart.",
        "A: I did not know that there were camps in Italy. I did not know the war conditions. Yugoslavia\nhad an awful secret pol -- police, Usetasha. I had not known of that existence, and the madness,\nand the badness of the war was really beginning to come home to me, when I heard these people\nwho had escaped by night over the mountains. Who had sent children to other countries. The\nliving with danger, the constant being afraid some knock at the door will be the secret police, and\nyou'll be taken away. It became all a reality. And, of course, I was there when Roosevelt died,\nand that had a terrific effect on the camp population. They were really depressed. It\u2019s something\nthat is now a -- people don\u2019t want to acknowledge, American Jewish people, that Roosevelt\nmade many mistakes. But he also was a big hope for people. And, of course the ones who came\nto America loved him for that in -- invitation, and they were devastated when he died. They\ncouldn\u2019t know that Truman did much more perhaps, in the end, but it was really a -- a major\ndepression. I always felt that all the deaths they had seen in Europe were suddenly coming to life\nagain by the death of Roosevelt, who had sort of been a power figure to them. So all that made\nthe whole time much more real to me. I -- also, I didn\u2019t have as much of a private life. In\nPhiladelphia things were going on, but here you read the papers much more, and people had a\ncountry, but they had lost their parents. You saw, actually the people. [indecipherable] had been\nin the hospital, the doctor had refused to take care of them. And for the first time you really\nheard it, from word -- by mouth. So yes, it -- I always said this was my oderver to camp life.",
        "A: Yes. It did represent great uncertainty. There was uncertainty anyhow, about who would\ncome next, and how would he handle it? It just brought home the nothinglessness, of the\nrefugees. No country, nowhere really to go, no profession, they couldn\u2019t make it. Just emptiness,\nall gone.",
        "A: Yes. There were -- you had to be very careful what you did, because there were these great\npolitical differences. And you very easy got into a fistfight or something of that sort. So we tried\n-- we tried to have lectures, but not about politics, if possible. Oh yes, we had the other thing. As\nwe were supposedly strange animals, yeah, they sent us a psychiatrist from Chicago, who was\nsupposed to help people. I think he may have been of European origin. He certainly didn\u2019t know\nhow to handle people in camp. And he asked questions you ask in your private office, but they\nare do -- not applying to camp life. But the administration was very proud, we had a psychiatrist.\nWe were glad when he left, but --",
        "A: Dreyfuss. I think that\u2019s correct.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t do too much of that in that camp. There was another outfit what worked out of\nEngland, a location service, which matched thousands of families, but we didn\u2019t do it, we didn\u2019t\nknow how to do it there. And we really were extremely busy with keeping things under control.\nPeople went on hunger strike, it -- all sorts of things. They fought with each other. As I say,\nsomebody died shoveling snow, and family thought the administration should never have\nallowed him to shovel snow. And that\u2019s the only one I remember, there may be other ones. And\nhad organize that people were visitor in the hospital. They were always so busy, the men were\nnot so busy, the men had a difficult time to take women\u2019s jobs, like cleaning the barrack rooms\nthey had. We had single men, and they had to take care of their shabby, little apartments.",
        "A: They were old border tensions, between the Yugoslav and the Austrians. And then there are\nalways fights between the Poles, and the Germans, I mean [indecipherable] traditionally have a\nlittle fight. It was not really politics as such, it was just old enemy. It was excited people who\nwould use every little incident to get excited about.",
        "A: I can\u2019t [indecipherable]. I think they were [indecipherable] but I am not sure. I think there\nwere.",
        "A: Yeah, I think the men helped in the kitchen, but so did the women, but I know we couldn\u2019t get\nthe men to work in the kitchen.",
        "A: No, not really, no. I forgot to say that during my time in Maryland, I became a citizen. That\u2019s\nimportant because I wanted too much to be a citizen, to eventually go to Europe.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s all 60 years ago. I had to bring a witness. I was the only one to be naturalized,\nand funny enough, in the small town of Westminster, Maryland, they hadn\u2019t naturalized\nanybody, as far as I know. Anyhow, I hold number one certificate. And of course, I was afraid, I\nshould know some American history, and I know I got questions, what makes a suggestion a bill,\nwhen it had to become a bill, and so on.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: When I came back from Oswego, I had moved from Philadelphia to New York, and I was\nwaiting for papers to clear, to go eventually to Europe. I went back to a job I had had before, and\nthat\u2019s the juvenile court. I was always interested in working with delinquent youngsters -- so-\ncalled delinquent. And I worked for what\u2019s called Youth House for boys, and later for Youth\nHouse for girls. Again, as a psychiatric social worker, taking histories this time for the judge to\nhave -- make decisions what to do with a youngster, send him home, go to placement, or\nwhatever was indicated. I had done that early in the game, I forgot which year. I did it again\nwhen I came back from Oswego, and that was by the middle of \u201945. And I did it until the end of\n\"46, when I went, with the Joint Distribution Committee, to Europe. I had been in touch with the\nJoint a long time before. Actually, \u2019'd known about it all my life, cause my family was very\ninstrumental in it\u2019s creation. And the Joint was one of the agencies working in Europe after the\nwar. The other was UNRRA. Those were the two main agencies. Of course, every religion had\nit\u2019s representation. The Joint, and the U.S. Army, and the UNRRA was p-part of it, were really\nthe most constructive factors in rebuilding. I am very aware that they are under a lot of criticism,\nbut having been on the spot, I can say that they performed a miracle. Europe at that time was\nchaos, people not knowing where they came from, not knowing where they were going,\npractically not knowing who they are. The Joint and UNRRA [indecipherable] really established\ncamps, with the help of the army, for various groups, eventually for all people. There have been\nso many camps, and they were different in the different zones. You had the British zone, and you\nhad the American zone. I can\u2019t remember if they had a Russian zone, but they had three zones.\nAnd em -- each zone had it\u2019s country director, and then there was a director for all the work, in\nParis. He was in charge of it all. I know that when I came over, I was first going to Paris, to be\noriented toward what was expected to me -- of me, and to be assigned to a country. I did not\nknow when I left here where I would go. I assumed it would be Germany or Austria because of\nthe language. To my great surprise it was Italy. And my much bigger surprise came, I went to\nRome, because the capital always was the center where the Joint worked out of, and I spent a few\nweeks in a sort of reception camp called Genechita, City of the Movies. It was the Hollywood of\nItaly. And that was a camp for every refugees that had been picked up. Every nation, and wi --\nreligion. Men, women, children. I don\u2019t know how many. To me it seemed thousands, it may not\nhave been. And that camp, I remember as a nightmare. If you ask me who administered it, I do\nnot know any more. I know it had no individual rooms. There were partitions between the\nfamilies, sort of made of sheets -- bedsheets, where you could hear every noise from the\nneighboring bed, which means your private life was open to the children, open to each other. It\nmay be part because it was my first real camp, but I was absolutely overwhelmed. The second\nday I was there, there was a rumor that a Chinese had killed his wife. If that was so or not, I have\nno idea, but everybody talked about it. That was, in my memory, the most primitive camp, but as\nI say, I had just arrived, I had no basis of comparison. In a way it was good, because every other\ncamp seemed like -- not paradise, but at least not like hell. And I must say, I don\u2019t remember\nanything of the beauty of Rome, which I had not seen before. I only remember this miles of\nhumanity, badly dressed, hungry, cold -- it was winter, I came so -- in February, I think. And --\nand then I was told I was to go to Milano, because I had experience with hospital work, and\n[indecipherable] work. And I got on long train ride. It still was right after the war, and people\nalways forget, your trains weren\u2019t running. Italy itself had no food. The people were under the\nimpression still of the war. Yes, they had won the war, oh, Italy didn\u2019t here -- take it back, I\u2019m\nnot sure Italy won. But they were -- everything was gray and gray. And it took us very, very\nlong to get from Rome to Milano, which usually takes a night. Sleeping [indecipherable] didn\u2019t\nwork, it was -- Italy was just a country in which a war had raged. And one shouldn\u2019t forget, it\nwasn\u2019t only all Displaced Persons, it was all the Italians themselves. You were hungry, and tired,\nand had no work. When I arrived in Milano, this rehabilitation center, being a former hotel,\nlooked like absolute luxury. I did not stay in the place. I think that had had reasons, because it\nwas tuberculosis all over the place. We had, as far as I remember, no children. Some younger\npeople. I remember a young woman, perhaps in her early 20\u2019s, from Yugoslavia, who had\nsurvived with her parents, and they had gone through hell, and she had ch -- tuberculosis, and\ndied, very much at the beginning of -- and I never forget it, I can still paint her face. And that --\nit\u2019s really difficult to talk about, because it\u2019s a double experience. Here you had survivors faced\nwith death again. Now, what that meant to them, I can\u2019t imagine, I can only feel a little bit in my\nfingertips. And still you had the same political groups fighting each other, that was the\nHungarians and the Poles. All Jewish people, but different ideas, different religious traditions.\nBeing angry at the world. This is [indecipherable] people. I remember three of young men who\nwere not even 20 -- I mention that because you, at that age, could survive, and then in the 30\u2019s\nand 40\u2019s. You hadn\u2019t many old people survive, and you hadn\u2019t many children survive. Not in\nthese camps. We had a doctor from South Africa, who was the M.D. director of the camp, and\nwe had Displaced Persons physicians. We had about three physicians. Now, either ask me how\nmany patients, I really don\u2019t know, about a hundred, could be mistaken. Too long ago to ve -- to\nremember figures. And, what perhaps has to be mentioned 1s that was the time where\nstreptomycin was a rarity. The doctors practically only had lermotorax to work with, which was\na much more complicated procedure, nobody [indecipherable] it could be dangerous. Also, for\nthe TB doctors, they had to stand very long. This is procedure, and I know once or twice\nsomebody fainted. And streptomycin, we always had to get on the Black Market. Now, this was\nthe center of the Black Market. You exchanged streptomycin for either coffee or cigarettes. And\nthe accepted -- accepted currency were cigarettes. And -- and the other thing was, there was\nsomething -- the army run co -- called the PX, which was like a shopping center, with a very low\nprices. And we had, as American, or an English workers, we could buy there, and we could\nexchange. There are also two currencies. There was green dollar, and oh, what was the other\ncalled? A script. A script, as far as I remember, you couldn't take out of the country, I don\u2019t\nremember it. The green dollar was much better, and you could get anything for a green dollar,\nfrom two dollars to [indecipherable] dollars, there was no rule or regulation. And there was a\nfight to get food, because the Germans had no food themselves. And all these things are of\ncourse, forgotten. Now, one of these stories -- oh, I don\u2019t know how many, have been in articles I\nhave written over the years. They are not very new. I\u2019ve told them before. But one can\u2019t\nduplicate them, I can\u2019t invent new ones. And one which shows you the difficulty with food.\nJewish holidays, of course, played a very, very big role. And these were the first holidays in\nfreedom. So, my people in the -- I call it camp, it\u2019s really abcenter, wanted to be like home, and\nhave geese and chickens for Rosh Hashanah. Now how to put loose geese and chickens, when all\nI had was the canned goods the Joint hand me? Now, many, many of my people weren\u2019t even\nused to that. So, the only thing to do was to ask if any of the DP\u2019s would be able to look after\nlive chicken and geese, and there was somebody. So then I went to the mayor of this little\nvillage, and asked if I could have some, I would bargain against canned peas, and stuff like that.\nWell, they let me have some. So, in our DP Center, we had guk, guk, guk, guk. And they were a\nbig excitement, we had them for a few months. We had to feed them, they were like everybody\nelse, starving. And the whole group, of course, was very much interested. And Rosh Hashanah\ncame. We had a cook who was German and not Jewish, so he cooked the beasts, and when he\nwas cooking them, to get the feathers out, he used boiling water, and when he did that -- you\nknow what a mushkia is? The Jewish [indecipherable] overseers, which we would have foster,\ncame in, and he looked at it and said, \u201cTrayfa, no good, no good. You can\u2019t eat them. Now tell\nyour community what happened.\u201d I said, \u201cWe m -- have to find a way out. This means life to\nthem.\u201d Well, I had an Orthodox part, a community, they all wanted to go right to America, and\nthe un-Orthodox want to go what was then Palestine. Now, the un-Orthodox said, \u201cWe can eat --\neat it.\u201d The Orthodox says, \u201cTrayfa, trayfa, it can\u2019t be done.\u201d Then the Orthodox committee\ncame to me and said, \u201cYou know, you have to ask a miracle rabbi.\u201d A-Again this gentleman\nassimilated [indecipherable]. Well, eventually, I found a miracle rabbi in a camp in Austria.\nNow, try to phone, in occupied Germany after the war from one country to another. I had to call\nGeneral Clay\u2019s office, who was the commander of all of the German zones, and I got some\nsoldier who thought I was utterly nuts. \u201cWhat do you want, chicken? Buy some chicken.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me, I have to,\u201d -- \u201cAll right, you get clearance.\u201d I get clearance, I call for the wonder\nrabbi, and I get him. And he says, \u201cFirst of all, are you a Jewish daughter? Well, this is a very\ndifficult question, I have to think about it. Would you call back in two hour?\u201d I said, \u201cBut the\nthings have to be cooked. I have no time to waste, I have excited people.\u201d Call back. So I go\nthrough the whole thing again, get the same soldier to Clay\u2019s office, who just -- who just shakes\nhis head, I am sure, but gives me clearance. And then I get the answer, it\u2019s a little difficult to\ntranslate from the German Jewish. \u201cIf the geese and the chickens were boiled in water that was\nhigher than the boiling mark, then they are trayfa, but if that was lower, if was water right out of\nthe faucet, then they can be eaten.\u201d So I was on very good terms with a young DP camp director,\nwho had had a baby. I said to him, \u201cPlease, you bathed your baby this morning in hot water from\nthe faucet?\u201d He knew exactly what I was doing, said, \u201cYes, Miss Tarenberg, I did.\u201d I went back,\ncalled my two committees together, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the answer from the [indecipherable] rabbi,\nwe can\u2019t go any higher, and we are going to eat the animals.\u201d And we did. But these stories, once\nin a lifetime. Bad food is 1n all institutions, one of the main cause for trouble, because people\ndon\u2019t have so many things to fight about, and they let out all their hostility, their fear, their\nanxiety, on food. And I have had so many debates about food, you can\u2019t imagine. In the three\ncenters I worked in. So that was part of it, but the emotional atmosphere on these holidays, with\nthe families, some were all over the place, if they were alive, was really unforgettable. On a more\ncheerful note, we had our first wedding in camp. And that again 1s a story, how overly sensitive\npeople are under those conditions. This young couple wanted to go Aliyah beth -- you know\nwhat it is? To Palestine. And when they married -- at that time, of course, we had to create a\nwedding dress. Well, the Joint had sent us lots and lots of material for cottons, and out of the\ncotton material, we made dr-dresses for the whole group. And in a actual over-identification, I\nmade myself a dress, too. We must have looked like a flower garden. Anyhow, when they\nmarried, I wanted to give them a wedding present. You don\u2019t have very much to give, and\nanyhow, money seemed to be the most important. Well, I took some lira and put them in an\nenvelope, which was from my office, it was a little torn, and the young lady first said -- didn\u2019t\nsay anything. And much later came to me and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t thank you, because I was annoyed,\nbecause you didn\u2019t take care enough to put that money in a nice envelope, and write something\nnice on it. We are taking that money, not for our personal gratification, but we\u2019ll give it to Aliyah\nbeth.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, if that gives you satisfaction. I\u2019m sorry. I surely didn\u2019t want to\nhurt you.\u201d But that\u2019s typical for the over-sensitivity. That was a Greek girl from Saronica. And I\nfound them a particularly sensitive group. I don\u2019t know as much as [indecipherable] that I know\nabout the other European countries. But they are a very sensitive group to work with. We had\nquite a few. We also had a supposedly Sephardic Jews -- Jew, from Greece somewhere, who\nturned out not to be Jewish at all. He was a Turk, and when a -- when he got angry, took a saber\nout -- I was talking -- and run around with a saber, but he ran away, end of story. As I say, the\ninteresting thing is that all that I remember so well, probably because I felt guilty that I couldn\u2019t\ndo more to help them, that they all have forgotten the bad part, and of course, compared to the\nconcentration camp, this at least meant some security, but that they didn\u2019t know to which country\nthey would go. I remember one woman who had a utterby breakdown, with good reason. She had\nwaited and waited for her husband, eventually located him in Poland, but he was married to\nanother woman, he had thought she was dead. And -- help. And then, a young lady who really --\nlater in this country, when I met her, by chance in the street, became a friend of mine, had\nmarched all the way from Romania, that was days and nights. And she was young, she was\nalmost a year -- a year -- was about 17 or 18, and almost all her family had been killed, but one\nbrother who had gone to Palestine. And she tried violently to make an adjustment once she\u2019 II\ncome to America. Had bad case of TB. They all had TB, but this was one of the worst. And I\nlooked after her, I s -- sat up at night with her, etcetera, etcetera. You do what you think has to be\ndone. It\u2019s not always social work, what\u2019s [indecipherable] happen. And one day we got a cable\nfrom Palestine that her brother had died in the war against England. Now I had the nice job to\ntell. And of course, she practically lost her mind, and so for quite a few nights I stayed with her\nin her room, and played, as well as I could, mother figure, but -- and she never got over, not even\ntoday, is happily married, but she had to tell all her past. Many didn\u2019t talk about their past, but\nshe felt she want to describe the halls, and there were many children. It was a very religious\nhome. And so every day, we set aside a certain hour for telling. And then I left, and I didn\u2019t hear\nabout her. I thought of her sometimes. I had a picture, with a very nice dedication. And really, 40\nyears went by, and I -- I\u2019m here in Forest Hills in a street, in front of a store, looking at some\nhats. And a very tiny voice behind me said, \u201cAren\u2019t you Miss Tarenberg?\u201d That was Celie, that\u2019s\nher name, Celia. And she had come to this country, had gotten TB again, was in a TB sanitarium.\nHad married, happily. Her husband died. Had married again, living quite near here. Has two\nwonderful children, and is a very good business woman, which I\u2019d never thought. Had\n[indecipherable] in business. We see each other once in awhile. It\u2019s gone -- I never\n[indecipherable] something, I cannot identify this [indecipherable]. You find that in DP camps,\npeople became either very, almost fanatically religious, or said a God who lets concentration\ncamps happen. It\u2019s very difficult to say something to either. But I found that over and over again.\nAnd it\u2019s interesting that the stories I got at that time, went riva -- really well, just about liberated\nfrom camps, were quite different than what you get today. I remember, I think out of my\npersonal sy-system, I remember so well a young man who was very close to his father, they were\nvery religious, and he had seen his father jump into the fire with a Torah in his arm. You don\u2019t\nhear that any more. But I must say, I almost cracked up on that one.",
        "A: With my broken Yiddish, and German, and to other member, we talk English. English was\ntaught in the school in Germany, and so when you had people from Germany, who went to a\nhigh school, you sometimes could. I do not remember communications difficulties. In what we\nsaid, yes, but not language-wise.",
        "A: No. I can make myself understood in -- 1n -- in Italian, or in Dutch. In Europe you pick up\nlanguages from traveling, but I don\u2019t speak that.",

        "A: I -- in Merrano, I saw quite a few. They are -- were all ready for rehabilitation, so you didn\u2019t\nsee too many -- they were not -- it\u2019s not true, they were not already for rehab. We see -- so I saw\nseveral deaths in -- in Merrano. I cannot remember in Passau.",
        "A: Yes. I was paid by the Joint Distribution Committee, and I was paid, actually in America,\nbecause of all the difficulties. We got a certain amount of script, I believe, in the country where\nwe worked. But we came back to America, and found quite a bit of money after three years. We\nweren't rich, but --",
        "A: Not on a certain place, a contract was usually for 18 months, but you could break it any time,\nif you had to, and people did.",
        "A: I had two friends who did --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Yeah, I know these two, and I met other people in Europe with whom I still am friends,\ncolleagues of mine.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t even remember if I came -- probably by boat, I don\u2019t remember anythi -- yes,\nyeah, I came by boat, but I really don\u2019t remember anything whatsoever about it.",
        "A: That is difficult to say, because is a highly individual -- some people had a great need to talk\nabout their homes, and to show that they had little a farm, or a good business, or -- and I think\npeople react in accordance with their personality. You can\u2019t really make generalizations. Some\npeople had a great need to show how clever they had been in surviving, while today we\nrecognize that survivor, was luck. There are some things that have been shown, which made\nsurvivor, for instance, in a camp, somewhat more likely, if you had a close relative somewhere\nwho needed you. If you had a reason to survive. There are such things that one can perhaps a\nlittle, generalize. Some people who had a somewhat guilty conscience, had to justify the way.\nThere was much more things that had to be hidden at that time. I remember one man was so\nupset because he had stolen potatoes. And well, there were much more serious crimes that had\nbeen done. And yes, after the people trusted you, you would have the conflict that you could\nhave saved somebody, but you ran, or whatever it was. I always have difficulty with some of the\nthings, because you cannot document them, you have to trust my memory, and some of these\nstories, I don\u2019t even mention, because I have no way of showing they really happened. I know it,\nbut that\u2019s my quarrel I have very often, with people I discuss this whole -- memories are\nmemories, but they are not documentation. They change. Human mind is stra -- is really doing\nstrange things. And people who\u2019ve changed their story don\u2019t even know that they have changed\nit. \u2019ve had people tell me another person\u2019s story, and thought it was theirs. So, what I always\nsay, but that\u2019s now a personal opinion. Your facts are the skele -- skeleton, and the stories\n[indecipherable] are really the flesh you put on the skeleton. Cause it\u2019s amazing what happens.\nAnd then there are, of course, people who do it with a purpose. One experience is that when we\nwere very eager to get people to America, and they were -- the doctors felt they were really ready\nto go, but their x-rays didn\u2019t show it, we thought of [indecipherable] that the right x-rays were\ntaken. And the same people, when it came to restitution in this country, wanted me to testify that\nthey had tuberculosis. That\u2019s very difficult to decide what to do.",
        "A: I think I\u2019m not going to answer that.",
        "A: It has changed by getting old. I ha -- the facts are not changed, but many things I could\nremember even two years ago, aS you see me groping for words sometimes, that\u2019s the process of\naging. I don\u2019t think that the facts of any of the things I say, aren\u2019t true. I can\u2019t guarantee, but I\ndon\u2019t think it 1s.",
        "A: If they had them, yes, but in the early days I\u2019m thinking of right now, they didn\u2019t know. They\ndidn\u2019t know what country, and what would be expected there. And then we had the alt, which is\na trade school there, and they learned some trades, which they really couldn\u2019t use in the country\nthey were going to. A shoemaker. Now we got many from Russia, but I mean, it\u2019s not a very\ndesirable trade here. Bookbinding. Now, you would teach computer. But that wa -- was a good\nidea, to get people who had never experienced the working process, having to be up at a certain\nhour, having a lunchtime, etcetera. But these school -- trade school, they had at least an idea how\na normal person works. It was a good idea.",
        "A: Yes. Absolutely. They still do, today. And when they hear something -- I heard somebody say\nwhen all this business happened with the French Concorde, it should happen to German. I said,\n\u201cIt did happen to German, and shouldn\u2019t happen to anybody.\u201d I mean, there you can see the raw\nfeeling, yes. And then, the question, will they ever go back for a visit to Germany, and Poland,\nand so on. And there\u2019s some who do, and some who don\u2019t. I am surprised that so many non-\nGerman Jews settled in Germany. I never quite understand that. It happened, I saw it myself.",
        "A: Yes. I -- I wanted to g -- to see the graves of my parents, because I\u2019m one of the few who\nknows where her parents are buried, and I thought [indecipherable] me, and I did.",
        "A: I have been there for two days or three days before, wanting to show my husband, who was\nfrom Poland, my hometown. I tell you, a experience -- I always have up -- a city in which I don\u2019t\nknow a single name in the phone book, is not my hometown. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a beautiful city, and\nthey were very surprised the taxi drivers, that I speak German without an accent. I could relate to\nthe young people, who really had nothing to do with all this. But when I saw somebody over 55,\nor so, I curled up. I didn\u2019t know what you did during the war. I looked at our old house. It was a\nfunny feeling. But something nice. When I was born, my father planted a pine tree in our garden,\nand by God, it survived. It was nice. I always said I am a survivor, so -- and people have gone\nback in g -- much greater numbers to Poland. They hate Poland much more than I hate Germany.\nI mean, [indecipherable] is in my own ca -- but I\u2019m not a person who hates. That my Polish\nfriends -- not my husband, he never hated Germany. You find 1n there, some of my husband\u2019s\nstories, which you will find interesting. It -- certainly you had people who never stopped talking\nabout what they did to escape, or to get out. And it was good for the ego, I think, it -- then, in this\ncountry, nobody wanted to hear about these stories. And now, it has become very fashionable. If\nI have to read another book about the Holocaust, I jump. And they get farther and farther away\nfrom the truth. I mean, that\u2019s natural. Life marches on, we hope. Anything else I should te-tell\nyou?",
        "A: 1953. \u00b054.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, they really didn\u2019t have the strength to do more than throw a -- a few words\naround, all the Germans should be killed. These strong words. Yes, they should be taken off this\nearth, I\u2019ve heard that. I never heard other children should be killed. I mean, you would think that\ncomes in from the [indecipherable]. I never heard it. I -- they wanted to kill individual\ncommanders of a camp, kapos, you know, the -- yes. But it was a -- obviously only talk was too\nmuch, yet the hostility was there. Was -- overriding it all was anxiety. What will become of us,\nwhat has happened to our families? Yes, there was a hatred against landlords taking over farms,\nor -- and then there were the differences in how the people had survived, which influenced their\nattitude toward everything. The people who had lo -- fought in the motho ghetto, they are much\nmore warrior-like than the ones who had hidden in the forest. And you see that also, in the\nsecond generation. Now, in my last year, I been working with the 50 and 60 year old children of\nmy original clients who have died. I mean, on, and on, and on. But now it\u2019s come\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: I had them organized into groups. Now, we have so many groups, you can take your pick. I\neven had to have somebody in Los Angeles, but I don\u2019t know her, it went by letter. I have a --\nmy main work, when it really was work, was helping them to come to terms with the generation\nconflict. Want to hear anything about it? In so many cases, the parents expect that the younger\ngeneration should make up to them some of the things they never had. They overstress the value\nof education. They put so much pressure on, that the young people can\u2019t live up to it. But they\nhaven\u2019t had it, and here they had the chance, they have to take it. All right, when the time comes\nthat a 18 year old wants to move out of the house. You can\u2019t go -- leave us. Everybody has --\nelse has left us. Then the young person feels guilty. She wants to live her own life, or he, and on\nthe other hand -- I\u2019ve had many, many interviews around that. Around differences in religious\nactivities. And it works both ways, I have -- I had parents who were practically agnostics, and\nchildren were fanatic [indecipherable]. Then the adjustment difficulties. Young people here\ncertainly live different type of lives than parents have in Czechoslovakia. And that depends on\nwhich community they live in, but now -- when I first came here, I preached about the necessity\nthat we should know more about DP camps, because they were the catch all. And I was very mad\nwhen I heard of the big conference, that some of my former colleagues are, who were very nice,\nand I couldn\u2019t go, which annoyed me. But -- not really. And then I started to think, the second\ngeneration is in their 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s now. They must have something in common, and\nusual a social agency isn\u2019t really geared to this type of problem. They could probably best help\nthemselves. And I helped them to come together in groups. Now, we have the English transport\nchildren is one group. Then we have the hidden children is another one. There\u2019s a\n[indecipherable] which name I\u2019m -- I really don\u2019t know which. Federation of Children\n[indecipherable]. Now, unfortunately, they all compete with each other. But they do good work,\nthey all bring out the monthly newsletter. And that was very nice. I always get them from all of\nthem, and I give them to students I share the contact with, et-etcetera. And the English transport\nchildren were having a question where you can ask for relatives of friends. And I remembered\nthat my mother, in England, as a volunteer, was connected with a hostel where children from\nGermany and Austria, who went over with the English transports, stayed during the war years.\nAnd in a small place in Yorkshire, which I had almost forgotten, I was up there a few times. And\nreally for the fun of it, I wrote to the editor, and said, \u201cI wonder if any of your subscribers will\nremember an old lady in Italy, who ladled out the soup for lunch every day in the hostel.\u201d And lo\nand behold, I got three answers, after 60 years. From somebody in Canada, somebody in South\nAfrica, and somebody in Maine, and they remembered my mother, etcetera, my brother. So it\nstill goes on, you know? It\u2019s a personal experience, but it\u2019s an indication that it still is this\nreaching out for the past. Well, [indecipherable] of my personal memories. Cause the\nexperiences were very different than somebody who was in England, or hidden in the Ukrainian\nforest. A whole group has gone back to Poland this year, but I don\u2019t know what they had, I\u2019m --\nhad [indecipherable] to find out.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: It was not in Merrano. It was in Barishkamine.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think there was --",
        "A: -- very much working, anyhow. There was a DP director, who then cheated, and had to leave.\nI can\u2019t remember. I just remember that cook.",
        "A: There may have been, I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember any German personnel, I\njust remember this one guy.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Well, I lived through the day in Merrano, when Palestine became Israel, and that was one of\nthe most exciting days for the people. And we had an ardent group of Zionists. They were not in\nnumbers so many, as they were young, intelligent, aggressive, and I was pretty close to -- with\nthem, because Merrano is geographically near a pass, called the Brederal, and we got really\n[indecipherable] the people who went to Israel, later Palestine, and we hid them in the\nsanitorium, and the Zionist group, of course, was mac -- most active in that. That we had all sorts\nof dealings with the -- the Bricha, and with the Haganah, and -- and that was good, because the\npeople felt alive, you know? And then we brought people to this house of Italy, the people who\nwanted to go to Israel. Again, yes, people did die. I remember the leader of the Zionist group, a\nyoung man, just before going to Israel, died.",
        "A: Practically nobody left. It\u2019s -- you\u2019ll see, 1 -- the Truman act had just started. There was a\ntrickling of people. Many, many people were afraid to ler -- leave, I forgot to tell you. They were\nafraid of life outside. They had been under discipline for so long. They wouldn\u2019t tell it that way,\nbut it would come out of the conversation. You asked me something I didn\u2019t catch all.",

        "A: Some people had left for Palestine. Some had gotten better. Oh yeah, we had this one incident\n[indecipherable]. We had one grim incident, which could have been avoided. People did not\nwant to leave the sanitorium, because yes, while ma -- word of mouth, they wanted to get out,\nit\u2019s awful, no food, but, it was actually a very good place. They had good food, and they had\ngood care. So, when they were going to be discharged to a regular camp, or to wherever they\ncould go, they didn\u2019t want it, they didn\u2019t like it. And a group of them got together, and said, \u201cWe\nwon\u2019t go.\u201d And there was an awful fight with the administration, and I know I was sent to look at\nanother sort of camp, that was empty, and they were supposed to go there, near Milano. And\nwhen we got there, I was with them. There was no water, and actually not much either. And they\nhated even the [indecipherable] there. And, the whole group decided to go back to Merrano. And\nthe administrator there had no food for them, you cou -- you got food -- rations for the persons\nyou have. And he didn\u2019t know what to do. And, as he couldn\u2019t -- he did not take them back into\nthe sanitorium, they had no damanna, no talmedge in Italy to stay, they were all sent to prison.\nNow, this should not have happened, but it did. And were all sorts of law students, they didn\u2019t\nstay in prison very long, I think there is a -- but it became a big issue. And eventually, I think,\nthey went back to the sanitorium, and eventually to different countries. But it created so much ill\nwill, Merrano never quite lived that incident down, and it\u2019s written up in drawings, and\n[indecipherable] everywhere I heard this story. Nobody knew much about how to handle\nsurvivors, and how to -- there was no government, there was nothing. We all had to do as best as\nwe could, and sometimes it wasn\u2019t right.",
        "A: Me, or the DP\u2019s?",
        "A: Yes. First of all, I was partly stationed in Munich. I could, on my free days, go to Munich,\nwhich was a big city in [indecipherable]. I also was very interested in seeing what was going on\nin the country. The country was really Austrian, and then became Italy after the second World\nWar. And again, 1 -- everybody hated everybody else. And the Germans came out during the day,\nand the Italians at night. It was really very strange. Merrano is a beautiful little city, and oh yes,\nwe had time for a private life. I was also, somewhere around that time, living in a hotel. I don\u2019t\nknow why, but I did. I worked in Merrano, in the real center, but I worked -- I lived across the\nstreet in a hotel. I don\u2019t know why, but I did.",
        "A: In Merrano, yeah. But in the hotel, no. I really couldn\u2019t tell you anything.

        "A: I was living partly in the Hotel Flora, across the river. I was also traveling quite often to\nMerrano, where there was a camp. I don\u2019t know where else I lived, I remember Flora.",
        "A: I think so. I just can\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Once or twice.",
        "A: Wedding. I think two weddings I remember. A bris I remember. But, of course, when Israel\nwas declared Israel, we had a big celebration. I\u2019m sure we had Pesach, but I don\u2019t remember a\nthing.",
        "A: Not that I remember. We had the evening for Jewish folk songs, and I remember very well\nthat our youngest patient at that time was about 14. She came to us from Bergen-Belsen, a\nconcentration camp up north, I think on a British. And she never had any formal education, or\nanything. Her father was a journalist in Warsaw, and she had a beautiful voice, and she sang a\nsong, \u201cAus straita librend,\u201d our city is burning, and she had her own tears. That\u2019s about the only\nget together of that sort I remember. But again, don\u2019t forget, 60 years ago, or whatever it was --",
        "A: Yeah, they had the school, trade school, and the arch, one of the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, but I -- I remember somebody helping with the clothing room, giving out clothing.\nProbably yes, but I wouldn\u2019t really ever known that, but everything so --",
        "A: Merrano were sick people, and so it was very limited what they could do. Yes, I know, one of\nour porters was also a refugee. I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t remember that it ever became a problem in\nMerrano. They liked to do it, I think they were paid for it.",
        "A: You know, some things are really a little difficult, because one\u2019s own life gets so mixed up\nwith it. I went for a prolonged -- do the e -- no, I ended with the Joint, somewhere during the\nsummer, in I believe \u201948, I don\u2019t know what it was. And I went to Brazil, for personal reasons.\nBut I needed a job, and so I went to the Joint office in Rio. And they, of course, didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with me, because I don\u2019t speak Portuguese. Women doing that sort of thing in Brazil\nis not customary at this time. PS, I had one of the first flights from Rome to Rio de Janeiro,\nwhich took about 37 hours. And I had never been in a plane before.",
        "A: Overwhelming. We went down in Dakar, were so many big flies. Was all very, very strange,\nbut [indecipherable] as the only Jew with me, that was a displaced person. But the Joint thought,\nwhat can we do with her? Well, the only thing we could think of, because they really had no\ndisplaced persons around, was sending me around to get money, to -- as a fundraiser. A, I am the\nworst fundraiser under the sun in any language. B, I was a women -- woman, Thirdly, I don\u2019t\nspeak the language. So, it was an absolute failure, but on friendly terms. We just decided we\nweren\u2019t for each other. And I took the next plane back to Paris, where I had a sister. And I went\nto the Joint, and said -- I said I\u2019m back in Europe, I might just as well work, and they assigned\nme to Germany. They sort of were quite glad to have me back at the time. So, that\u2019s how I\nstarted in Bashkimine. Passau came a little later, but I had them both together, and then I was\nstationed in Munich. But I really wasn\u2019t supposed to be there too often, they thought I had to go\nto time in Munich, I better stay in my village often.",
        "A: In Italy, I did. In Munich, I only saw the main streets, really. In Frankfort, I saw a lot. But it\nobviously didn\u2019t impress me very much, or I would be able to remember details, I don\u2019t.",
        "A: Yes. To be in your own country, in an American uniform, and not belong anywhere is very\ndifficult. And I didn\u2019t like the Germans very much, and I never liked the people from Bavaria,\nthe city was prejudiced, but there it was. I never felt at home in Munich. I got along well in\nBashkimine and Passau. Now, in Passau, I spent month in the hospital. You can have it as a\nstory, I mean, I -- in a way, connected. We all had the command of Jeeps in Germany, because\nthey were always meeting in another place, or yet to another camp. That\u2019s how I saw so many\ncamps, because you were sent to see 1f a patient\u2019s ready for discharge, or whatever. And we had\na person in charge of our own district, from England. And there was -- there were meetings\nforever, and this was in November, this I remember. And it was a very foggy night, and I had a\nyoung Czech driver, who meant very well, but didn\u2019t know too much about driving. And we\ncouldn\u2019t find the house of this English commander. And we drove down a mountain, and where\nhe thought was a street, 1t was a mountain going down, and the Jeep rolled over, and over, and\nover. Have a happy ending. And I don\u2019t know much what happened after, I was first taken, I\u2019m\ntold, to the house of the commander. I was unconscious, and then eventually taken to the Passau\nhospital. There I woke up, in a German hospital, which was all I needed, and with a big, s-\nswollen head, and it turns out that I had a fracture of the skull. Luckily, my driver came the next\nday. Nothing had happened to him, and he wanted to apologize. It\u2019s very often the person who\nsits next to the driver. And I was in that hospital for months. I think it was March that I got out. I\nwas very lucky, I had no le -- nothing left over. My eye 1s a little affected, but for weeks I\ncouldn\u2019t see, I thought I would never see again. And it was not Christmas, was some holiday, I\nknow people were very nice to me, and a Catholic priest always came and gave me the Last\nRites, and I could really take my choice. And eventually I was asked, where would -- did I want\nto go for a convalescent leave. And I chose Merrano, because I knew doctors there, and I knew\nthe place, and I didn\u2019t want to go to a German German place. And in Merrano, I met my future\nhusband, who was a doctor there. So I said to the end of his life, \u201cI had to fall on my head to\nmeet you.\u201d So you see, it has been a rather eventful life.",
        "A: I met him in \u201948, we got married in \u201952, cause we had different quotas from different\ncountries. I was an American citizen, he was Polish, and so they had a long to-do, but we made it\neventually.",
        "A: I guess about four weeks, and then I went back to work. I went to the end of that contract,\nthen they established another year [indecipherable], I don\u2019t know the name, I went there a few\ntimes, to help the worker there to get organized, but something ashabat, I really don\u2019t know. And\nthen came back.",
        "A: Yeah. Everybody was surprised, and told me I could get a pension if I stopped working.\n[indecipherable] me all sorts of things, but didn\u2019t really occur to me.",
        "A: I experienced doctors who were not nice, but they never said it was because I was Jewish,\nthey said I was an American, and we had everything. And I -I\u2019m quite sure it was of religion, but\nI\u2019m not one who always finds anti-Semitism anywhere. It was unpleasant, and I was very glad\nwhen I got out of there. There I have the documentation.",
        "A: Well, when I was in Passau in the hospital, I couldn\u2019t go out. When I came back, yes, I\nenjoyed Munich. Had nice friends, we went out a bit. But, as I say, in Munich it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s a\nbeautiful city, it\u2019s not my territory. I would never go for a vacation there. The countryside is\nbeautiful. And many, many people stayed there. Munich was the center of the DP camps, and\nalso had the big TB sanitorium, where I visited, never worked, Goljing. And we got often, people\ndischarged from there, mostly from other camps, but also from Goljing.",
        "A: Well, I worked only in the DP camp -- in the TB centers. I visited many of the other camps,\nand they were different. I mean, some were more luxurious than others. I remember a barracks --\nthe camps had a very good self government, which I admired, and they didn\u2019t have barbed wire\naround. If the people could leave, I don\u2019t know, I rather doubt it, because it might not\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t really recall the -- I don\u2019t know -- remember any details. I remember\ncamps as a -- probably because I never stayed there over a day, I just went in, took my history,\nand went out again.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They were centers for displaced persons -- Jewish displaced persons who had tuberculosis.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, anybody who wants to know, the Joint has all these figures. I really don\u2019t\nknow -- 80?",
        "A: Usually for the -- usually for the week. One week, work days in one, and the weekend, at least\ntwice a month in Munich, and then of -- to Passau. That was a very pleasant routine. I felt quite\nat home in both centers, and Munich was always full of gossip, who was going with whom. And\nonce in awhile, I could go to a museum, or do something nice.",
        "A: Yeah, they were mostly Joint people, or any of the other agencies. I do not remember picking\nup anybody from Munich, or Merrano -- yeah, Merrano -- one, it was not a friend, but a person I\nwas in contact with about -- for a long time.",
        "A: No. There are, of course, plenty of us.",
        "A: Wa -- again, a great many. Very often the nurses were also American. Oh, I trained nurse\u2019s\naides sometimes to [indecipherable]. I only remember we had a very nice nurse from New York,\na Jewish nurse. No, a -- UNRRA had many, many social workers, and so had the Joint. I\nwouldn\u2019t know how many, but I would guess over a hundred. They worked in every country,\nPoland, Hungary, and -- I don\u2019t know if anybody was attached directly to the army, but we\nworked very closely with the army, and we were very helpful. And the American army was\nreally very helpful to the displaced persons. The children loved the soldiers, they got chocolates.\nAnd when we called on them because there might be trouble, not very often, they were always\nhelpful. I have good experiences, as far as human beings are concerned. And I got very fond of\nthe displaced persons, because they were so courageous. They had such a will to live. You would\nthink you gonna [indecipherable] suicide or anything other -- I didn\u2019t, I saw -- we get -- we must\nget married, we must have children, otherwise Hitler has won the war. That, over and over again.\nIt really could be exasperating with this forever complaining about food. I know I once lost my\ntemper when somebody complained he hadn\u2019t gotten enough sausage, and after all, six millions\nhad been killed. And I says, \u201cThey weren\u2019t killed for you to get sausage.\u201d They were always\nthese fights. The Russian engineer, you had all sorts of people. A Russian Jewish engineer. And\nwe had sort of hostess, who was Italian Jewish. There quite a mix there in Italy. They all got,\nsomehow, along with each other.",
        "A: That was a different time. The ones in Italy were still much more under the influence of the\nwar, had many more concrete needs. We had no money, we had invented pocket money. I\nremember I would -- think it was Monday, I set a little [indecipherable] and gave out pocket\nmoney. And in Bashmine, and Passau, the war had been away a little longer, they knew a little\nbetter what would happen next. They were less aggressive, also less interested. You had much\nmore, as I remember, much more ablusionaries 1n Italy than in Germany. But I fow -- because it\nwas my first, I always felt much closer to Merrano than to Passau, in particular, I -- I never really\ngot warm with Passau, but that was my -- I didn\u2019t like to be lectured, and many things play into\nit. And I had a friend in Gola, who was above anybody, but somebody else was the director\n[indecipherable] get into question of competence, and. . . it was the only one -- I saw cotaferata\nin Italy --it was -- I only saw -- it was very pleasant. And one day, I was very courageous, I\nwanted to see Dachau, which was, of course, not in vention any more. But I overestimated my\nnerves, I simply fainted. I didn\u2019t see a thing of Dachau.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, right away.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t want to. And it wasn\u2019t as fashionable as now. Now you have tourists\narrangements to see Auschwitz, etcetera. There wasn\u2019t my job.",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t see any reason why. I know enough about it, I wouldn\u2019t make\nanything better by seeing it. I haven\u2019t even been to our museum here, at the [indecipherable]\nHolocaust Museum. I would have gone to the Holocaust Museum, if I could. I would go e-\neventually to the museum here, too. They got my first forgers by that time, I didn\u2019t really have\nany contact with Washington. So they wrote, and I sent them, and I was sorry later, but\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: You mean in Bashkimine? Yes, the majority was from east Europe. Poland, Romania. I can\nremember -- oh, Hungary, there\u2019s quite a few from Hungary. Not from Germany, interesting\nenough.",
        "A: Well, they wanted to get out of it, but again, and you can\u2019t underestimate the self-\ncenteredness people had to have to survive. And Germany -- one hated Germany, and you hope\n[indecipherable] what happen, and so on, but your main interest was to get out, and to make\nmoney, and to get well. There were -- in the three places, there were some political fanatics.\nSome against Roosevelt, others were against England, others were -- hated Germany. But they\nmade a lot of [indecipherable] noise, no other action that I can remember. But of course, there\nmay have been things they wouldn\u2019t have shared with me.",
        "A: Let me pin it very much on the problem they wanted. If it was a family problem, which it\noften was, you did the usual counseling. I -- a thing I advised all of them to get into some\nworking process, be it in someplace it could help in the village [indecipherable]. And in other,\nwe had schools, in some are -- in other, Bashkimine, there was a big wi -- camp, very close,\nwhere they had very good causes, so we encouraged them to go down there. And otherwise it\nwas the usual counseling, where do you -- how do you come to der -- terms with things you don\u2019t\ncome to terms with? What ways of adjustment? Give them opportunity to talk about their\nchildhood, about their escape, trying to set their mind at ease about whatever they had done.\nListen to the good things they had done. Trying to build up the personality as much as I could.\nAnd also trying to get some sort of community council getting started [indecipherable]. Really,\npretty much what a social worker is supposed to do, but I did it as a sideline, the main things\nwere always what the day brought. Not enough sheets on the beds, or not enough peninsilino,\nstreptomycins. Could they get coffee, or decaf, or -- at remember that I organized any trips. Also,\ntrying to get the doctors, to -- who were medically trained, but not psychologically, to understand\nthe patient better.",
        "A: Prepare? Not. My training helped me to find my personality, and to use it constructively, and\nthat helped. But the actual causes, it didn\u2019t do me any harm. Know what I mean? It\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard\nto say what you bring to the training, and what the training gives to you. It gives you discipline,\nwhich I had before. It made me understand American life better, and the social system, which 1s\nvery, very different from Europe. I certainly knew more about welfare and all these things. And\nthe mixture of being European and having American training helped me, yes.",
        "A: From the DP\u2019s, or from me?",
        "A: Yes, they were very similar. I think Merrano, because it was beautifully located, and had\nmore appealing rooms, was I think, the more cheerful setting, if a TB sanitorium can be cheerful.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B\ncontinue to tell me about differences, and similarities between the different centers. The two in\nGermany you got to know, and if you\u2019d like to compare with the one in Italy.",
        "A: Comparisons are always difficult, no matter what you compare. The thing that stands out in\nmy mind 1s that the people in Italy were closer to their real survivor experiences, and were more\nrevolutionary, and also had more of a feeling of quote, that\u2019s coming to me. And they really felt\nthat the world owed them a living. Certainly America, because it was so rich, and Germany\nbecause it had handled them so badly. As far as the camps, they were both located in pleasant\nsurroundings. I think the kooven ital -- Italy had more contact with the population of Merrano,\nthan the group in Passau had with the inhabitants of Passau. The problems were pretty much the\nsame, health, where to go to, how to handle one\u2019s past, and what the future will bring. This is an\noversimplification, but by now, some of the details have slipped my mind. What is very much on\nmy mind is the fact that many of the people who are still alive, of my rehab center population,\nare in their late 50\u2019s, I think up the end of 60, and I wonder how they will handle the process of\naging, which is something that affects all people, but I have a suspicion that it affects them\ndifferently. From my work with survivors in this country, I have seen that they pretty much go to\na second -- through a second immigration when they get older. Certainly the language that they\nhave handled rather well, through ha -- the middle years, gets to be slightly problematic again. I\nfind that older people, including me, are apt to count money in their mother tongue, which they\nhaven\u2019t done for years. Also, of course, living in a city, a big city like New York, where you\nhaven\u2019t gone to school, or know anybody from the olden days, makes you doubly lonely.\nLoneliness, of course, comes with aging, but as a survivor, you sometimes ask yourself, what do\nyou survive for? I have often heard complaints by survivors that there is nobody they went to\nschool with, no neighbors that know the streets they have walked in. And if it comes to\nmemories, most older people can escape into pleasant memories, and do, but what can the\nsurvivor escape to? Slaughter, and burning, and anxiety, and death. So, I think -- and I know that\nat the moment, studies being made about it, that there is actually a difference. Yes, the\nexperience of aging, we all have, but in a way, the survivor has it more so. Everything gets\noverly intensified.",
        "A: I have. And I have had an -- when I still had cases -- later I became an administrator, I have\nhad cases of people who were older, and my agency had a coffee house once a week, for older\nsurvivors, and that always gave me a chance to talk to different people, and as I\u2019m, in a way, one\nof them, they share it with me quite frankly, their pleasures, and their worries. And, of course,\nsickness 1s another one, where people born and raised in this country, may have a relative come\nin, or a long time friend when they need help. It\u2019s always very different -- difficult for the\nsurvivor who lives alone, to find a person who helps take care of their bookkeeping, whom they\ncan have on their living will, and all these documents that run all our lives, become problems,\nand make it suddenly clear again, yes you thought you were an American, you thought you were\nat home here, and suddenly you feel like a foreigner.",
        "A: Okay, which --",
        "A: We were so much daily living that they almost are not conditions. I had a room. I had office\nhours from about 10 to about four. People came to me when they had question about their pocket\nmoney, when their laundry wasn\u2019t intact, or the cook was angry, somebody had sent the food\nback. So I think part of the time, I was made of all purposes, and then people had sometimes\ngotten letters from consulates in a different language, which I tried to translate. They had to\nmake official phone calls, which I made for them. And almost always, they took this opportunity\nto talk about what just worried them that particular day. They hadn\u2019t heard from an uncle in\nAmerica who was supposed to give an affidavit. The consulate hasn\u2019t let them know somebody\nhad treated them badly. There was a rumor that Australia had -- took only people in agriculture.\nWhatever came up during the day, and then in the evening sometimes, we really talked about\nolden times, how it was at home, how they had sat around the open fire, how the grandfather had\nlived with them, how different it all was when the Russians came, who came riding into the\nkitchen, and had very different ideas of civilization. Also, on the other hand, had been very\nhelpful. Many had been liberated by the Russians, who had liberated Auschwitz, and had really\nonly good things to say. Other had stories that they simply had to tell, because they\u2019ve had such\nan injustice had to be done to him. I remember a little story which is indicative. In a camp, there\nwere a husband and wife, and as most camps, as -- especially concentration camps, there was\nabsolutely nothing to eat. And one day, the husband had managed to gather two potatoes to bring\nto his wife, who was in the barrack. And it was a very wet, damp day. He tried to balance his\nway on bar -- bare feet through the ward with his two potatoes, and he was very close to home\nwhen an SS man came and just threw the potatoes out of his hand, down to the floor, into the\nmud, so that they couldn\u2019t be eaten any more. And he said, \u201cThat was one time where I cried.\u201d\nAnd I must confess, I cried when I heard the story.",
        "A: The interesting thing 1s, the big stories don\u2019t upset you as much as the small ones, and the\nreason 1s, I cannot identify with thousand people being killed, but I can identify with a husband\nbeing proud to relieve the starving of his wife, and have it spoiled. And I\u2019ve always felt, when\nI\u2019m honest, it is these small things, the things that could have happened to me, in my experience,\nbecause the other things I haven\u2019t experienced. I have not lost somebody in a fire. I haven\u2019t lost\nanybody through Hitler, really, but I\u2019ve lost a much -- many other things, and I know the loss\nwere innocent. Things I have experienced are easier to ad -- identify with. There are some stories\nof escapes through snow nights. Now, I have some there from my husband, but as you will read\nthem, why should I tell them? That -- his life was full of these small stories that get you. And not\nonly me, but everybody we knew.",
        "A: Yes, I try to review each day, and to see if there\u2019s something I could have done better. And\nwhen I found something, I welcome it. An emotional toll, perhaps it didn\u2019t take, because I felt\nguilty to begin with. And everything that I could do, would relieve my personal feeling of guilt. I\ncame out of it, I think a better social worker, or to b -- say it better, a better listener, because so\nmuch of the help one could give, was simply by listening with a sensitive ear. You may say a\ntrained ear, because people were so unhappy when they came to this country, that nobody\nwanted to listen to them. And they were bitter about it. And even today, the first thing one\u2019s\nbeing told, oh well, when we came to America, nobody wanted to hear us.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t keep a journal, but when something really moved me, I made either a story out of it,\nbecause I liked to write, or put 1t down verbatim. I kept those notes for a long time, but I don\u2019t\nhave them any more.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember that we celebrated a Jewish holiday. I may not have been\nthere during holidays. I don\u2019t remember the split between Orthodox, and the assimilated that we\ndefinitely had in Merrano. You may have had several [indecipherable] in Barishkamine, not in\nPassau.",
        "A: Yes. I think because it was the first, and I came back from my own recuperation, and I stayed\nin touch with some instructors who went later to Israel. And the young girl I mentioned to you as\nthe youngest, was later adopted by one of the doctors, and they went to Israel together, and then\nmarried a doctor, and came here, and stayed with me for some time, and I helped her find a job\nhere. Yes, Merrano has many more memories. The others, I never feeled at home, and it was\nsomehow -- it was more of a job.",
        "A: From \u201949. I think part of \u00b048, the end of \u201948. In \u201950, I came back to the States.",
        "A: I think there were families in [indecipherable] in the first camp, where I was a few days. I\ncannot remember -- I think husband and wife, I may have met one or two couples.",
        "A: Made a mistake, in Italy there weren\u2019t, in Germany there were.",
        "A: These were rehab centers, and they were -- they were listed as DP camps, so I use it\nsometimes. I think everywhere I was -- no, not in Italy, but in Passau, and Barishkamine, I think\nI was the only one living there.",
        "A: I think I was the only worker, and it was [indecipherable] it was the thing to do.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: There was never a set routine, but very often I would do that, yes.",
        "A: Basically they didn\u2019t change. Some people left, their visa came through, sometimes they\nfound a relative unexpectedly, in Argentine or somewhere. The big change was, there was a\nPalestine one could go to, by -- or rather Israel one could go to. Palestine you needed the English\npermit, and didn\u2019t get it. So that opened up new hope, and the spirit was a little more hopeful\ntoward the end of my work, than in the beginning.",
        "A: No. Even today, and I have taken hundreds here too, I think every history is different, and it\nwill get me, I sometimes get mad at the client in my mind, and sometimes I admire them, but\nI\u2019ve never gotten to the point where they don\u2019t touch me. They may not -- I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t\ntouch me as much as they did in the beginning. But I was very prepared for my husband\u2019s\nstories. But that came out a little later. No, I -- I never really got tired or blas\u00e9 about it.",
        "A: Not every day, but once in awhile, I did hear about a criminal act I\u2019d never heard of before, or\nsome event I had never heard of. And that overwhelmed me. There was one mention, at one\npoint, which I can\u2019t document, of somebody who claimed to have eaten human flesh. That was\nsomething I could neither understand, nor digest. I\u2019ve never heard it again, other people said it\nwas never [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Not at all. I don\u2019t know which ca -- which year the war crimes took place. Not at all.",
        "A: Yes. They talked a great deal about the kapos, the people who were the supervisors in the\nconcentration camps. And they had grim stories to tell, and they would repeat the stories over\nand over again.",
        "A: Once or twice, yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, I guess my contract was up, and three years was long enough, and I had met my future\nhusband at that time. And the eventually hope was to go to America. And I -- I just had had -- I --\nI felt it was time to go home. I had an apartment I wasn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t know what was going on\nthere. So I came home. And [indecipherable] immigration agencies, for HIAS -- for New York\nAssociation for New Americans. Then, for a short time, I went back to the juvenile court. And\nthen I heard that my latest agency, 1959 -- in the meantime I got married -- Self Help, was\nlooking for somebody to take over for vacation. And I said Il do it. I came for three months,\nand stayed 40 years. And I worked as a caseworker first, psychiatric social worker, and\neventually ended up as deputy director. That was an agency that worked exclusively for\nsurvivors. It started with survivors from Germany, but soon became survivors from central\nEurope.",
        "A: Right. It was founded in 1935 by German refugees. And they founded it, and worked together\nwith the Quakers. So, in name, it is always a non-sectarian agency, but today it works only for\nJewish survivors -- that is not true, either. Anyh -- it works. It still has a section only for\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "A: As an agency, yes. We worked closely with claims conference, and the president of the claims\nconference was a board member of our agency, w-we worked very closely with all agencies, as\nanother German Jewish agency, the blue card --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, neither nor. Just by chance. Self Help has a great home health aide service, and people\nask for our home health aides, and they were often survivors. And Self Help, together with other\nagencies, runs quite a few apartment houses, which were originally for survivors, so I met\nsurvivors there. Then United Helpers, this the agency has a scholarship program. I met them for\nthat. And yet, there\u2019s also a German Jewish based nursing home. By now I meet quite a few\nthere.",
        "A: HIAS is an immigration agency founded by Jewish people from eastern Europe, and has\nmany of it\u2019s connections in eastern Europe, and Poland, and Hungary, and so on. The American\nJoint was founded by German Jews, and it\u2019s connections are more in western Europe. Both\nagencies are immigration agencies, both work in many countries in Europe, have many\nsimilarities. There\u2019s room for both of them. Basically, they have the same goal, I think -- it\u2019s\nhard to say. I really w-would have to read the formulation of their missions to be able -- I know\nwhat the working differences is, but what\u2019s in their mission, I couldn\u2019t say. And then we have the\nJewish Federation, which funnels all these agencies. You have a small, but very effective\nGerman Jewish agency called the Blue card, which 1s a relief giving agency. The other agencies,\nbasically, are not giving relief. They help with everything else. And the Council of Jewish\nWomen, I think doesn\u2019t do anything, they used to help with immigration. And Self Help has\nbecome rowt -- right now, an all around agency, that has a -- a very large homemaker service,\nwith almost 3,000 homemaker. No, not 3,000, over a thousand homemakers, and it has five\napartment houses that it runs. It does five senior citizen centers, for the city. And in our housing,\ntoo, there weren\u2019t enough immigrants any more, so it\u2019s open now to Chinese, and everywhere,\nwho is living in that particular community.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That applies mostly to the way things are remembered.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: In comparison, the more sheltered time in the DP camps is, in their memories, more positive\nthan it was when they lived there. There, the old insecurity and fear was overwhelming. Now\nthat the struggle in the outside world has been not easy, to say the least, the time in the DP camp\nis seen in rosier and rosier light. I have a friend who is writing a book, who I sometimes talk to,\nand he asked me to give him some names of people who would give him their -- their history.\nAnd I suggested them. And he said it was very difficult to get anything negative for them, they\nwere only ready to paint it in the most positive pictures. That, of course, is rather interesting, and\nmy only explanation is that life on the outside was strenuous, and makes the camp experience,\nsheltered life, not to worry about job, not to raise children, in rosier light than it really was.",
        "A: I think for me it was a natural thing to do. I have never had any doubt about going into it, and\nI must say, coming out of it, I find in a way this history is a logical ending to about 40 years of\nservice, which I have given with pleasure, also with heartache, but that\u2019s part of life.",
        "A: Yeah, the one, and I think the most interesting one was a passport issued by Raoul\nWallenberg, in Hungary, to Jews. It was given to my husband, and I happen to have the original,\nand I sent it to the museum. I also sent them a picture of the sanitortum in Merrano, and one has\nthe director on it, the other our first group of graduating nurse\u2019s aides. I also sent them most\nrecently, a large snapshot of Goering, which was taken by my brother, who was asked to\ninterrogate Goering in Nuremberg. That picture came into my hand, and I thought it has a better\nplace with the museum.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t quite know how it came into my hands. I think it was really given to me by a\nfriend who had found it at a book fair. It\u2019s certainly not a historically reliable document, because\nit\u2019s strongly politically influenced, but it 1s interesting.",
        "A: Yeah. This is a paper booklet listing all concentration camps in greater Germany. They have\never listed some camps which I am not even sure that they were concentration camps, and they\nbroke it down to great camps, and small camps.",
        "A: I would very much hope that some research will be done to the psychological adjustment of\nthe aging survivor. For instance, the influence of the history married marriages -- marriage -- that\nwill be edited out -- which had a tendency to get very difficult at the point of retirement, when\nthe couple, for the first time, really got to know each other, because they had the time. I\u2019ve seen\nthat, and I very -- I have many case histories for that. Somebody should really explore that a little\nmore. And the influence of course, of the generation differences, which is much stronger if you\nlive in the country which were -- you were not born, and where the morals, from beginning, are\ndifferent from the ones you were raised with. I think I\u2019ve said it, another point of that history,\nthis is one phase of the survivor story which has not yet been fully explored, the aging ofa\nsurvivor. None of us has as yet survived aging.",
        "A: Thank you for taking me. I really enjoyed it, and I\u2019m very pleased. For me, this is a very\npositive ending to something I have given much of my life to. Thank you.\n"
