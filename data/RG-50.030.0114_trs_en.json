        "Q: And when were you born?",
        "A: I was born 1925, September 15.",
        "Q: What do you remember about your life before the war?",
        "A: I was a little girl in a small town, going to school, coming from school, no boys, just\nhomework and playing. My father was a wealthy man. My man was...if I remember my\nmother was never feeling well, so she has a special woman taking care of...for the children,\ngoverness, and for her. And we had a maid at home. It was a small town. Our town had only\nabout 2,000 people. Uh...My father was...uh...taking care of the synagogue and___\nmeaning riches. If someone had a store and maked a living, he was rich. My father had\n_ you know and we...I think he was wealthy, and we were very happy. For the summer we\nwent to camps. I had three brothers. The first after me was Moshe, the second was Abraham,\nand the third was Fishel. There was younger, rich, but one year... We were a happy family.\nMy mother had 5 sisters and | brother. The brother was a very rich man. He didn't live too\nlong in this town but he moved to Warsaw. Warsaw was like 32 kilometers from Tarczyn,\nand with a bus it's 30 minutes away. So we very often went. My mother...like for a dress or\nfor a hat or for something and always in Warsaw. And I had a happy life til 1939, til the war\nbroked out. And in school, they told us we have to wear masks because they were afraid for\nthe gas. They said they will supply, you know, the...uh...with gas so I came home from\nschool and the war broke out in September the Sth, 39,\u2019 and my life was shattered right away\nbecause my...we were afraid they will call my father to the army. My father was only 39\nyears old. So my father was a very religious man. To the mill what he possessed he had two\npartners. One partner which was like a relative to us and they started in school when they\n' beginning of the Second World War September 1, 1939\nwere young boys. My grandmother died when she was 28 years old. My father was 10 years\nold. And he had a stepmother like from a book, not a good one. So he was troubling\nand...uh...his friend was in the same position also without a mother. So they start like to\ndoing business about 10, 11 years. And they remained after 60 years partners like they're just\nrelatives, and with the kids...with the children we were also like relatives til today. So my\nfather with this partner went to Warsaw to this Rabbi. What the Rabbi said if he will be\ngoing to the army or should he stay in Tarczyn or should he go to Warsaw. So the Rabbi said\nthat he wouldn't go to the army. The Polish army doesn't need him. He's too old, 39 years\nold. But he should come to Warsaw. So my father came back the same day and when I came\nhome I...I saw that the maids are taking everything out from the closets and packing in sacks,\nin big, long sacks. So I said, \"What's this?\" So my mother took me aside and she said, \"Eat\nyour supper.\u201d I still remember what the supper was. Fish, fried fish. And..uh..we're going to\nWarsaw. And right away the men came. He took all the possessions from the room, from our\nhouse and we had our own horses through the mill, you know, so everything like...was like\na...we called this a Wagen, you know, like you see in America when the...the...the Mexico,\nyou know, and the horses, the big Wagens, and we took every...I mean they took everything\non the Wagen and we went to Warsaw. Our family and my father's partner's family. My\nfather stood still yet in Tarczyn, but my mother and the children and the maid and we came\nto Warsaw. It was a hectic night. The kids all were crying. We were upset, and what we\nheard was boom, boom, boom...the artillery and the shooting. So when we came to Warsaw\nwe came to a beautiful apartment, friends of mine parents were still....on the summer house\nbecause it was summer in Europe and we...this was ___, and we took their apartment,\nbut we didn't remain too long in this apartment because the Polish army moved in...in the\nbuilding with the...you know, so we were afraid. So my mother called her brother if we could\ncome to him. So my brothers and myself and my mother came to my uncle,__\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 23: in\nWarsaw. Two days later my father arrived and we been together. And that day the war\nstarted and there was fires and it was hell. But we still together. Not only us because then\nwas bombed this...uh...uh....house on the Granichna. So my father's partner came over with\nhis family together to us, and we stood together til the German occuped Warsaw. So the first\nday we wanted to go back to Tarczyn because in ghetto...1t wasn't yet a ghetto, but we were\nlike, you know, just us, and we didn't have too much food because we left everything behind\nand what we had we left in the Granichna and it was bombed after two days. But my father\nwent to a baker who bought from our business flour, and he gave us a whole, like 50 pounds,\na 100 pounds of flour, and my father brought it to the...my uncle and my mother and my aunt\nbaked hallahs, bread, so we had to eat. But was a hard time with water. We didn't have water.\nSo we put on...on...for the children...for us...like for me, it was like a game you know. We\nwere small. We didn't understand so much...on a pot, a belt to carry the water and we went to\nthe Visla (ph) for the water. It was like a half hour maybe, a hour walk but til we were loaded\nwith water, was heavy the pot, you know, to carry. That's the way we brought the water. Till\nmy father one day said to us...this was also September, like 15 because before 15...15 was\nmy birthday...and I remember sitting with my mother and with everybody there from hiding\nfrom the bombs and I said, \"That's my birthday. I maybe get killed from the bombs.\u201d And in\nthe same day my father was...went to the Rabbi with my two brothers on the ____\u2014\u2014\u2014. He\nwas...by the Rabbi...what he believed in this Rabbi, and a bomb went in...in this shelter and\nthe whole building came down and my father start to scream to this Rabbi, \"Is this how you\nso holy that I am getting killed, my children and everybody?\" So the Rabbi said, \"Don't\nworry. You'll be alive and you will still see your grandchildren.\u201d And all of a sudden like a\nwindow was opening in the ground, and my father was out from the...from the, you know,\nbombed out house, from the shrapnels, and he pulled out my brothers, the two brothers. They\nwere injured, the face and scratches and he took and then he slipped out the Rabbi too and\nthey came to us in the evening and the Rabbi...and we couldn't stay in my uncle's apartment\nanymore because he lived in the third floor so we went to stay in a store in the same building.\nThey had a dairy store with people. They didn't have children, two old people. So they\nagreed to let in this Rabbi because he needed a room by himself. He was a very holy man.\nAnd we also stood there. Not only us, but practically the whole building of people were\nstanding like sardines because it was low for bombs so we were standing there. And then\nwhen the war was over...the war I mean the 39 the German occupied Poland, so my\nfather...somebody came already and said our mill was bombed and we have nothing to go\nthere. So my father started to the Rabbi to scream, \"Where are you? What I am going to do.\nEverything is bombed?\" And the Rabbi said, \"Believe me. Not you....uh...not you mill 1s...1s\nbombed.\u201d In the same town was my uncle. My mother's brother was a very rich man. He had\na mill in the same neighborhood what my father and actually my uncle's mill was bombed\nand burned and ours was partly burned but not completely. So my mother wasn't able to go.\nWe didn't had any communication to go back to Tarczyn. So we start to walk. Myself, my\nfather and mine...one of mine brothers, and my father's partner and his son. I will name him\nMr. Leshno and another two people. It was a distant relative of ours. He also went with his\nson to Tarezyn. 32 kilometers. We maked it in a few hours. We get to come home. But we\ncame near to the town. The smell was terrible. From fire, from bodies, from sweat. It was\nvery hot. And we saw as we came to the town...uh...I could...everybody could see our house,\nand it was like the edge burned the house and in behind was our mill. So we came back to\nthe house. I opened the closet. It was still eggs and butter and cheese from the night what we\ndidn't finished our supper and what everything and all sugar and jam and everything because\nthe war was going ___ we didn't suspect that we will have to run away. So that was good\nfor us, that we had right away everything. Also a cousin of mine moved in to our apartment\nbecause her house was burned and she actually saved this house because...with water...was\nno firemen at the time...so with water, with buckets of water she saved this fire shouldn't go\nfarther. And we were again happy to stay. Right? As a child you ask me what I remember. I\nremember I was afraid to sleep in my bed because after all...uh...the two, three weeks I didn't\nsleep in a bed. I was always sitting or lying on the floor, no bed. So I went to mine aunt,\nmine father's sister to sleep. She had a restaurant in town, and she had a girl, my cousin, mine\nage. And we like each other very much. I said I would sleep with my cousin Hilda, and I\ndon't want to sleep at home. So my mother said, \"Fine.\u201d\u2019 Oh...and at the time my mother\ncame also to the town back. And I ran around to my aunt's to see if everybody 1s alive, and\nthe town had a square and a lot of Germans in it. And I was very much afraid and people\nwere running up to the Germans with a cigarette to sell bread or something and I slept this\nnight by my aunt. In the morning about 7 o'clock, my father came in and talked something to\nmy aunt and I was very anxious to know what happened. And they didn't want to tell me...a\nchild...what happened during the night. That the German with the Poles come into our house\nand they took out my cousin, the woman's husband who let...who saved this house from the\nfire with my father with mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno. They took him on the attic. They\nwanted money. So my father said he has no money. He has the mill. And it's after the war\nand I don't have money. And the German...was few Germans, not only one...each one took a\nperson like the three of them and start to beat them and start to scream they should run away.\nSo my father was afraid to go to his room but on the attic a tailor was living there, without\nchildren, a nice old Jewish poor people. So he went into them and he sat til the morning\nthere. But he was afraid to tell my mother that he's alive. And it was the first night in the\ntown. So, of course, my mother was very upset in the morning and my father came to my\naunt to tell her what's what...that from now on he will remain there too. It didn't took too\nlong. It took about maybe 2 weeks. My father decided he's going to be free. He cannot live\nlike this so he decided...he and my cousin and mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno will go to\nRussia. First, they go to Warsaw, and later will go to Russia to Bialystok (ph). They said\ngoodbye to us and my mother was crying. She screamed, \"I am already a widow. How do\nyou leave me?\" But he left the money and a lot of people owe us money also. So we\nremained in the town with the maid. The maid had no place where to go. It was a Jewish\nwoman. She raised us and she was like a family with us, and we stood there. And my father\ndisappeared. We didn't know what and where and what. Occasionally we got...I mean my\nmother got...just had the news. My mother said, Oh, your father's fine and everything 1s\nalright. Maybe we'll some day be able to join him.\u201d So...uh...we stood together in this\nTarczyn, and nothing specially, you know. We lived without... just with the hope that we will\njoin our father and maybe the Germans will let us live in peace. (Sigh) Then one day what I\nremember, my mother said, \"We're out of money and I have to go to Warsaw to Mr. Flynn.\nMr. Flynn was a Polish German. That means he was a German by birth, but he lived in\nPoland. And he had...uh....we call it here commissioned bakery, and he owned us a lot of\nmoney so maybe he could give us some money. So my mother left and my younger brother\ngot very sick and I didn't know what to do. I was like the woman of the house so I called a\nneighbor. She was a nurse. And she give him some medication and make us not cry and the\nmaid was very good to us. And my mother went to my uncle and from my uncle they took a\ncar and they went to this bakery. And on the way, as they was driving on this...I don't know\nif they went by druska we call this with two horses and a wagon, you know, like a rickshaw,\nanother rickshaw met them but like back and forth and there was my father with partner and\nwith my cousin and my...my father's partner said, \"I think I see Frymet.\u201d Frymet was my\nmother's name. So they stopped the rickshaws and my father when he...they arrived with\nmy...with Leshno, they...they really don't have money, so they went right away to this Flynn\nto this...uh...man. And my mother went to him, not knowing, so actually they meet on\nthe...met on the street. What a coincidence. So this was a happiest day for us. My brother's\nvery sick and here I have my father back and my mother. Instead we're supposed to go to my\nfather, they came back to us because in Russia they give us...they get them a few days to\nmake their mind or they want to stay with them and they go to Sibiria or other places in\nRussia or they're going back. So it was not only for my father but all the people was like a\nmixup. Nobody wants to know...nobody knowed where they're going. This was my\nrecollection as a little girl what I remembered. And...uh...my father came back and he was\nmore calmly, wasn't afraid anymore, and he went in back to the mill and they started to do\nbusiness again. And this...uh...German Pole from the bakery gave him money. I mean he\npayed him what little by little, and we had a comfortable life. I wouldn't say no. Again I\ndidn't have any worry as a child. School wasn't any more for us. So my parents hired...uh... a\ntutor and 5, 6 children been together and we learned whatever. Wasn't much, but was enough\nto...to go along, you know. And then it started to be very bad and my mother was afraid that\nmy father should go to Warsaw to collect the money for the...so I volunteered and I went\nwith Mr. Leshno once to Warsaw. I carried the money and one day a German came over, not\nto me, to Mr. Leshno and he took him away to work. And I didn't know what to do with me,\nbut I know what where to go. So I went to my aunt, my mother's...uh...brother. And I start to\ncry. They took him away and... So they said, \"It's nothing. They catch people to work. He\nwill be soon there.\u201d And good enough he came in the night. He finished the work what they\ntold him to do and he came and we came back to Tarczyn. This was my last time I went. I\ndidn't want to go anymore. And we stood in this Tarezyn and life went on til it was very bad.\nAnd my uncle...they start to talk about the ghetto in Warsaw, so my uncle decide that he\nwants to come to live back in Tarczyn because he was from Tarczyn because he got so rich\nso he went to live in...1n Warsaw. So in the meantime they make also from Tarczyn...uh...a\nghetto...that all the Jews have to be in one side. Uh...Everybody in the town liked my father\nbecause by him it was no different. Jew, Christian. He didn't eat alone. He ate if everybody\nhad food. He didn't sit down to the table to the seder. That was...you asked me what I\nremember. I just remember we were 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock still by the table, sleeping children\nbecause he run to the houses to see if this people had food. If not he carried from our home\nfor them. As a little girl I remember many times before a holiday I was very ____ like\nchildren in school. My father makes like a nut in a handkerchief. There probably was money,\nno doubt about it, and go here and here. Don't say from who. Just give it. So a Christian\nperson who was...uh...couldn't say he's a friend, a person from the town came to my father\nand he says, \"Mr. Karmaski, Too bad they're a making a ghetto, the son of a bitches.\u201d Excuse\nme. \"But can we change with apartments. I know you have a clean house and I have small\nchildren and I would like to change with you because he was living in the side what the\nGerman give us. And we changed with him. So my uncle, with his family...he had two sons\nand a wife and a maid...so they came to live with us. And it was also, as a child it was happy\nfor me. It was harmless you know, a lot of children and we had our curfew. We couldn't go\nout like in the evening, but it was nice. We were...we lived nicely 1n this Tarczyn til they\ndecide that it's not good. Everybody has to go to Warsaw ghetto. Our small town had 350\nfamilies. So being in ghetto in Tarczyn a lot of people got...the poor got poorer, and the rich\nones survived. They ate, but the money didn't come in so it was very very bad. (Sigh) So we\npacked our possessions, what we could. I, as the older daughter, I was sent to Warsaw.\n(Clearing Throat) Excuse me. I was sent to Warsaw, also on a Wagen, with mine friend,\nthat's mean my father's partner. They still were partners, and we went to my uncle so my\nuncle went back too ____ his apartment in Warsaw and being a few days with my uncle,\nhe...uh ...uh... rent a room for us by a family. This was Carmaliska 15. So I stood there with\nour maid and with my two brothers and my mother and my father came the last day when\nthey had to go out from Tarczyn. So we lived in ghetto already. And from the whole Poland,\nfrom everybody from each each town, everybody came into...to Warsaw. And Warsaw was\nalready a ghetto. Was a small ghetto and a big ghetto. Carmaliska 15 belonged to the big\nghetto. Uh...My father received every couple weeks, couple weeks I couldn't say, once a\nmonth, once in 2 months, and from time to time we knew from which time to...from the mill\na salary. The good thing was because we had a partner also, beside Mr. Leshno. A Christian.\nHe was in the government, in the Polish government, a big shot. A president, but not a\npresident like you have...uh...President Bush or something, but he was something. I really\ncan't explain it what that he was a big shot. When the war came out in 1939, he called my\nfather and he said, \"Listen, Karmaski, I am going to leave you. I am going to America with\nmy wife. His name was President...President Shelpelski. And he left. After the war, when I\ncame to America I met his wife. She was living in Long Island. And she said to me, \"Please,\nMrs. Karmaski...(she didn't know my married name)...\"I want you to tell my neighbors from\nwhere I am coming and who I was in Poland because I don't know if they believe me.\nShe...her husband died, and she was living very poor. Matter of fact, I bought her Chanel 5,\nand she hugged me and it was very happy. When we went to the ghetto, this President...this\nPresident Shelpelski left a daughter, a married daughter from the 5th marriage. This was the\nsecond of his...1n Poland. Her husband was a major. The daughter's husband was a major in\nthe Polish army, and she was by herself in the mill. Of course, she had workers and she...and\na boy friend. The boy friend was a terrible anti-Semite. She was afraid for him, for Bollick\nthat she's helping us. But Richard, the engineer, was a very nice guy. I met him many times\nand he gave me money when I was hiding. And I thank to the mill with his wife because\nnobody from from the Poles would take us in without money and without promises that after\nthe war, they will be big shots or rich. (Sigh) Anyway...so that was our support from them.\nComing back to the Warsaw ghetto, as we received money from them we saw it's getting\ntighter and tighter and tighter. Of course, I couldn't say that I felt anything, but as a child I\nwasn't going to say that I wanted to knew much secrets from the...from the growing up\nbecause they always shhhh shhhhh not to tell the children. But from day after day you pick\nup some words. Right? Uh...My father decided...he was afraid to go to court. It was a court\non Leshno which was divided in half. Half was standing in the Christian side and half in the\nghetto. The woman who brought us in the money came to court. My father had a piece of\npaper. It wasn't really....he ordered himself that he has a court this and this day. The German\ndidn't know what it is when he willed in through the revealing doors. He went in. He met this\nwoman, and she gave him the money. She got paid for it. She took right away up her\npercentage. And then my father shared with my...with his partner. So we had a few dollars to\nlive. There weren't too hungry. We weren't too well off, but we were okay. One day my...my\nuncle came to us and he said it's not good. I heard this rumors and this rumors. You have a\nfew dollars. I have a few dollars. Let's do something. So from the Rabbi what my father was\nbelieving so much, he had acquainting man. This man before the war he wasn't a farmer but\nhe had cows in Warsaw, and for the sake of the cows he selled the mill and he lived. So this\nman talked in my father to buy cows, and they could buy them and they transport\nthem...Polish people transport them to the ghetto. So my father and my father's partner and\nmy uncle and another few Jews shared it. It was very expensive. And they had like a dozen\ncows. Analefski Street. It was a like from a big store made...uh...a place for the cows and\nthey hired a couple, the man and the wife what they milked, you know... Is this word they\ncall? milked...uh...cows. And the 5th you had to give the donations for the poor, and for the\nopens, the milk and then the rest you could sell. So from this we lived. My father woke up 5\no'clock. The minute he could work, you know, free to...it's safe to go, so he went to this...to\nsee how many liters or quarts what we call here...the milk, the cows were giving and all the\nfamilies lived. Not to make money, but we lived. Okay. And then I...my mother said that\nfather is very tired and maybe he shouldn't go and we children we should go because the\nminute when you walked out from the door to the street 1t was unbelievable to see. Young\npeople and old people like flies, deaths, deaths, deaths. Fallen people, hunger people, on the\nstreet. So my father didn't go but us children we went. Me and my brothers and from the\npartner the son went and whatever was left we were carrying the milk in special cans, you\nknow, to the apartment and from the apartment we had our places what we bought milk. We\ngot paid from people say they pay another time the 20 cents or the 50 cents what it was\ncontainer of milk. I lived there went there. And I think we lived I wouldn't a happy life, but\nwe lived. Uh...We had...mine mother had a sister living in Sobolif near Lublin and another\nsister who lived in Warsaw also in ghetto got very poor. She didn't have any money. So they\ndecide to shift her to this other aunt to Sobolif so she went with her sons there. And we stood\nin ...1n Warsaw ghetto and many times people came with regards from their were __ very\nreligious town so we could get from time to time a kosher meat, what they smuggled in\nfrom...not from this town, from Sobolif or from Otvorz (ph), and they came to the ghetto and\nthey had their clients or sometimes we had meat also which was a holiday at this time. And\nthis was til 1942. 1942 my cousin came, my father's sister's daughter from a small town. I\ndon't know the town. I don't remember. (clearing throat) That...uh...her brother-in-law and\nother relatives were kidnapped. She called this kidnapped. And she escaped. She doesn't how\nand she still doesn't know how she came to Warsaw ghetto, and we should have known that\nthey killing Jews. And in the same time they said that the Jews will live til July 22. And it\nstart to be like, you know, not easy. Not easy! And then it started that every Jew should\nwork. I never worked. I was a child. So my father had a lot of connections. He came home\nand he said, \"I think I managed something.\u201d And what my father did started it. So they\nbrought...they bribed somebody that I went into work. My work was by the Germans...it's\ncalled a shop. This was Tebin's shop. There was slavery, and they worked for the Germans,\nfor the army, of course. Tailors and hat makers, a shop. A big shop. For me it was like, I\nnever saw this. My work was...uh...sitting by a table and it was in a bags a lot of hats and the\nelastic in front by the heads were sewed down from the tailors, but there and there was a\nstring, you know, so I had to clean up the thread and cut with the scissor. I had a scissor. It's\nnot big work. It was...only if they would let us work because every minute a German came in\nand hit us or took us out. Some he took out never came back. Some they took out they raped.\nSo we were always afraid. I...my mother worked also in the same building. I worked on the\nfifth floor. She worked on the second floor. She stamped leather pieces. Little pieces what\nthey...to suitcases or what you're wearing on the back the shoulder, you know. What you call\nthis?",
        "Q: Shoulder patch.",
        "A: So this kind of... My bro...my father also worked by the same thing and the brother too. I had\nby the time already two brothers, not three because one was selected. It was...they came and\nthey took him out. They took out everybody. And they took him. He was hiding in one of the\nhiding place in the apartment. They took him out to the Umschlag. Uh...As they were\nworking one day they start to give us Kenncards. This was like a piece of paper which opens\nand said that you allowed to live...in German not in Polish. Everything was in German. I\ndidn't know what the line is for it. They took us out to make a line so, of course, I stood in\nthe line. So I was scared. I received a card like this. I didn't know what it is. And many\npeople...the one who didn't receive, they told go in the night or in the left. Actually in the left.\nI was to the right. You know, as I am talking, I could... And after they said, \"Let us go back\nto work.\u201d And we saw it's missing a lot of people from these for...but we didn't know for\nwhat. We didn't know if they're going to live or we going to live. But we were the lucky one.\nThe same day my father received a card like this. My mother wasn't working this day\nbecause they make the come in the nighttime for work. It was a 24-hour work. So my father\nreceived a card like this and I received a card. But then we knew it already what it is. That\nit's very important. Okay? So we the lucky one. And the same time they maked me...not to\ncome during the day but to come...that's how they mixed up people...to come in the night to\nwork. So I went like 4:30, 5:00. Most... wanted to go earlier because you were more safe in\nthe place where you walk because during the day you don't see anybody in the street and\nthis...the apartments were looted. But the time I wasn't living anymore Karmiliska 15, but we\nwere told into_Novolitki (ph) 42. This was also a friend of my father's who went to live with\nhis daughter and he give us up his apartment. So we lived there and my father's partner too.\nIt was like four families living in one big apartment. We couldn't...we didn't have many beds.\nI was sleeping with my mother. My brothers were sleeping on the floor. I think my father\nalso on the couch or something. It doesn't matter, but it wasn't already what it was. And we\nstill had the maid. I mean she was like in the family. It was no more maid, but like a family.\nAnd then one day they came and they took her away with my cousin. And we went to work\nand by work they said that we're going to live...I mean people just gossip...til July 22. And\nwas even a song about it.",
        "Q: Do you remember it?",
        "A: The song...if I remember it. Was something from my long home I could get out some more,\nbut very little. Very little. As I say til this point, til I went to work, I...I...childish...you know,\nI didn't give too much thought about it. I'm young and I didn't think about it. I didn't realize\nthat there could be such a terrible thing done to people. Uh...So finally it came, this day.\nThat's when we...that we heard...1t was all over the whole ghetto. Papers pasted out that all\nthe Jews had to come to one spot and this was this spot. It was three shops in the whole\nghetto. One shop...(clearing throat)...one shop was Tebins, the biggest one. The other one\nwas...uh...I just remembered. Fo Broczes (ph) I don't...I just remembered it. Schultz. Schultz\nwas working the same work what we. So the...the...the rumors were that Schultz and Tebins\nwere going to go together. And the Broczes (ph) which was in the small ghetto, they only\nwork by Broczes (ph). They will remain. But it...1t was just rumors, you know. (Sigh) So we\nwere living....this was already a good life. Hungry, working, and no future. Uh...But when\nthese signs on the streets were that everybody has to come in one place, my mother didn't\nhave a card. So I took out this card and I said, \"Mommy, this is your card and you go with\ndaddy and you take both children\" ...because my brother is very small. My age I was 14 I\nguess. I was already big. I was very tall and thin. They wouldn't let me through anyway. I\ndon't consider any more a child. So you go with this brothers. And we were sure we're going\nto work. And I said to my mother, \"You write Mommy. You will write me.\u201d And hardly my\nmother accept this Kenncard, but she did accept. Until the middle of 18 we still could work\ntogether in the lines. Was six people in the line, end of it, and the line it was really not to\nprescribe...not to describe how long it was. It was a terrible way down. The heat was maybe\na 150. Nobody had a drink. The _____ on the back, the shoulder bags...everybody had a bag.\nI had a few slices of bread and I think an onion in it and my clothes and like a girl, you\nknow, a pair of shoes. I also...when my house was looted in...uh...Karmiska 15, I went back\nwith the maid so I find my mother's beautiful pair of snake shoes and I always liked them so\nI took the shoes and I took them to mine so I was holding the shoes too. As we was marching\nI saw in the line my aunt and my uncle. That's the rich one. And her two sons. And another\naunt, my mother's sister. And we couldn't talk, but we waved. With our eyes we make like\n\"God knows where we're going.\u201d but still going. We know we going to the Umschlagplatz\nbecause this was Miller 18, and around the streets there. I was also...on the sixth I was with\nmy friend, Henry Leshno, my cousin and his brother and another two girls. I didn't know\nthem. I know them only from the shop. And this girl was probably mine age, but she had her\nmother and her father. And I was really jealous because all three had cards and I didn't had a\ncard. I think this was my first ttme when I start to be jealous of anybody. And thank God this\ngirl survived and her parents survived. Not the war, but to come back. And we were in the\nline. Because I didn't had a card, and my uncle and my aunt didn't had a card, so we went to\nthe...with them, and I separate from my mother in case...and no words to talk, but crying and\ncrying and write and don't worry. Ma, your health you know, and you will survive and we'll\nsurvive this. As a child, you know, I could feel I didn't have too much words to...to comfort\nher, and she and my father went different place because they had the cards. My mother was\nstruggling with me. She wants me to get a card, but I was very much against it. I felt young\nand strong. And they went away. As we came to Moranofska (ph), with us all and we stood\nand I said to this Henry...he was like a brother to me...I said, \"Henry, we don't know where\nwe are. We here with the aunt with this, but why can't we still go to be with my mother...with\nour parents.\u201d\u2019 He had a second mother, but very good woman and like I start... was...I'm a\nlittle older. He's alive. We're very good friends. And I start to agitate him, \"Let's go. Let's\ngo.\u201d And we went. Me...and I make his brother also to come, and the three of us start to look\nfor my parents. And as we're looking on the Miligas we knew a lot of people and they said,\n\"Oh, you're father is looking for you.\u201d In the same time my father start looking for us\nbecause they saw it's...it's not true. Everybody could still still be together. Was a terrible hot\nday. Humid. Hot. Without a little water. Finally, we find my father. My father said, \"Thank\nGod, we find you.\u201d And we came to Miller 22. There is the place where my mother sat on\nthe floor by the house and about an hour or so even my uncle come with his wife because we\nsaw we're not separate. We could be all together and we find a lot of people. But this time\nmy father...not only my father, but everybody...was starting to look to buy this Kenncardes .\nSo, of course, my father was starting to look for me for one. Couldn't get! But my mother\nsaid, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014s They don't let parents with children through. Just the opposite. Let me give\nback to Cywia the card. And you go with Cywia and I stay behind with my family, with the\nbrothers, with the sisters. She still had her brother. And with her friends. And if it's possible\nyou come with us or send for us. People went out...uh...with on the wagons as dead people,\nshoveled in...in the casket you know and went out so we thought maybe this way. A lot of\npeople had bunkers in the houses and they went in. They didn't give us too much time, as by\n5 o'clock they already...the Germans come with the \"Halt. Halt. Halt. Halt. Halt...and the\nmachine guns went boom, boom, boom a whole day. (Big Sigh) And they start to organize\nthe line, who's going to go left, who's going to go right. You never knew what the left line is\nor the right line is. Okay? So here it goes so quick. My father start to say goodbye and in the\nmiddle he fainted by saying goodbye to my mother. And I stay with the Kin card in the hand\nand I don't know what to do, and what to say. My mother's hand with me I should put down\nthis...uh...how do you call it?",
        "Q: Knapsack.",
        "A: Knapsack. Right. Knapsack. You want to know that she give me her knapsack, not mine,\nhers, with all her dresses. There were a few pieces of bread and an onion inside. An onion,\neverybody had an onion because they said an onion 1s good for you. And she took mine. As\nmy father was fainting, my aunt catched a piece of paper. Water...was no water, and start to,\nyou know, revive him, and I said to my mother, \"Go hide in this place.\u201d And she kissed me\nand it's no more words. What can words say? And I am walking with my father out and\nLeshno with his son and the rest of the people who wanted without Kenncard is go...could\nalso stay 1n the line. It doesn't matter if you have a Kenncard or not. Everybody was to make\na line and to go. So this Leshno's brother... handled him the picture frame. He was always 6\nfoot, strong like a ox, was will us in the line. They took him away this way and us 1n this\nway. We didn't know where we going. But what I witnessed before was a man before my\nline, before my face. He had on a enormous big knapsack. His name was Wassermann. He\nworked with me by Tebins, not cutting...this was the woman's work. He was sewing the hats.\nHe was a very wealthy man before the war, but in the war he got poor and then got he he\nwent into work to Tebins and he had a little girl about 3 years old. He had her every day by\nwork and if the Germans came in, myself and Dr. Bussow...I was working, also cutting. Dr.\nBussow was a nice lady. Her husband was a physician, children doctor...took this little girl in\nthis box and covered her with the heads she should survive the, you know, the Germans what\nthey came in to watch us work. He had this little girl in the knapsack. He gave her some pills\nto sleep and not to move and they took out this little girl and killed her in my eyes. I should\nsay in our eyes we saw it. And they took him also away beating. So I was happy in my\nmemory that my mother didn't see this and didn't go through because she had small children.\nMy brothers were small. So we went this way and they went this way and sure enough...of\ncourse, when I passed I showed the card and they let me through. I was very tall on my age\nand very thin. And this Dr. Bossow said to me, \"You have two bright eyebrows and the\nGerman don't like this.\u201d So she took me in aside as we were walking, still in the shop, and\nshe plucked out mine eye brows, and I was screaming because it was hurting. Come out.\nThey didn't go out (laugh) the places. Okay. So I was fortunate that they took me back. I\ndidn't mention that as we went to the Umschlag Plaza place, somebody fell in this line, and\nthe German run and right away it's like a pyramid. One fell, other falls, other falls. So they\nshoot in to this pyramid and like before me. Maybe I would fell too if I didn't see where I am\napproaching, you know, what I am approaching to go on. They shoot everybody was the\nwhole pyramid of people, young, old, whoever fell. So when we went back, everybody was\nalready tired, in tears, and this street looks terrible. Very bad. Possessions from people,\nhanging people from balconies what the Germans shoot them because they want to escape.\n(Sigh) We didn't know where we're going. But they took us to the shop back. So we were\nlying a whole night on the floor. Mostly were men, not many woman. And I started this girl\nwhat I was jealous on her...with her mother and father. And in my heart I felt I never see my\nmother again so I really was very jealous. And there crying the whole night and my heart\nwas breaking seeing for the first time in my life my father's crying, and he felt very\nuncomfortable like that he left my mother, like I felt this like maybe he exchanged me for her\nlife. So.",
        "Q: We have to stop here. The tape is about to run out. We're going to change it. Okay. If you'll\njust hold on a second.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Okay. You can go ahead now. You were saying you that you felt that your father had\nexchanged you for your mother.",
        "A: Yal. I felt like this, but he really didn't. He wasn't this person that he lived with the hope that\nhe would still be able to do something because people came back from this...from this miller.\nBut other hope was that we knewed where she is. She was not Miller 18, but Miller 22, and\nshe stood, uh...together with my uncle and with my aunt and with friends and with the sisters\nfrom Mr. Leshno and his wife and children so...and I was only my father and Leshno with\nhis son. And the same day my cousin come, my uncle's son. He went through this with my\nuncle and with my aunt and the other son, but they took them, the three of them away and he\nreceived the Kenncard so he came to the...to the shop so we heard from him some news. This\nwas...uh...the same day...he came a day later, but the same day he went to the selection. So\nwe knew they stayed together so our hope was maybe we could so something. So the night\nwas a terrible grieve...so in a terrible grieve. My heart was breaking. How my father was\ncrying, and all these men. Like I mentioned there was a lot of men, more than woman and I\nwas still considering myself a child there. And so in the morning we got breakfast. The\nbreakfast was watered like a soup but like water but off in the line standing for the line for\nthe soup, this day wasn't a working day, but like after a funeral day you know. So we got the\nsoup standing in the line and my father saw somebody so he went over and he said in the\nhope so he said to my father, \"Give me your picture...give me your wife's picture which I\nhave the picture still. He wrote it down. My mother's name and my two brothers name. He\nwent back and forth. He was the foreman from Tebins. Through him I went into work in the\nbeginning. My father paid but like a bribe, you know, and he took the picture went into the\nUmschlagplatz in the Miller and he couldn't find my mother. That was his response. The\nmoney he didn't give back, but he give back the picture, but he couldn't find. Okay? So was\nno hope that they will come. The day went on and this was already July 23. July 24 we start\nto work. You know the work has to be done. Uh...I was still by the same work with the\nKennkarte. They make me work at night time and my father worked in the day. We came to\nthe same apartment on the...it was like ___. From __ excuse me. From ____ to the ____.\nAnd this was our apartment. There what my father obtained with his friend. He went to live\nwith his daughter. I don't think he's alive at the time already, but it was too big apartment so\nwe were there...my father and myself, Leshno and his son, and my cousin and another two\npeople with two children. He worked for the Germans. He...uh...he wasn't a shoemaker. He\nwas sewing the leather of the shoes. I don't know in English this word what this... Before you\nmake the shoes...a shoe, you know, the leather has to be sewn together so then the\nshoemaker takes the shoes to make. Anyway he worked for the Germans, but he didn't have\na place where to live so he lived with us because...he moved in by himself. Apartment was\nempty so. So then we agreed that he should have a room and we lived together. And day and\nnight we went to work. We came back. We didn't have any food. We lived only what they\ngave us, but my father had a few gold pieces sewn in his shoes or on the suit and I also had\nbefore we went like the everybody had some money because we didn't go...maybe we knew\nit inside, but nobody want to say. We were sure we're going to work for the Germans, maybe\nto Germany, maybe by ____ summertime or whatever you know. So we had a few dollars. I\nmean slotas not dollars in case we have to buy something, a piece of bread or to bribe\nsomebody. The bribe was terrible in Poland at this time between the Jews also. So as a child\nI was wearing stockings but I didn't wear a belt, but elastic. So two eleastic together and in\nbetween was money sewn around. That was mine possession. So little by little we came over\nto this because we didn't have anything to live on it. And that's how we lived til 1943. The\nrumors were that the ghetto wouldn't stay too long, that they will finish us. And in between\nthey opened the Umschlagplatz. No more transportations. I mean they liquidated the ghetto\nlittle by little. The same thing and they opened the ghetto and they heard we were free from\nwork, that the ghetto was open, the miller. We run, myself, my father, everybody, the whole\nshop run there to look for relatives. We went straight to Miller 22 because we know we left\nthere my mother. We came...on the street somebody screamed, \"Uncle Mendel.\u201d My father's\nname was Mendel. This was my aunt's little boy, 8...7...8 years old. He was together with\neverybody, with my mother, with the brother in the bunker. So we asked him, \"Where is\neverybody?\" We didn't have to go further. He gave us all the report. He told us what\nhappened. Two woman in the building had a fight. I don't know all the words. And the\nGermans heard because they were snooping around with the dogs. So they came in and they\nfind the place that there is a bunker and they were hiding there and they start to scream that\nthey're going to put a tear bomb in the ducts. They should come out so they will be free to\nwork and live. Otherwise, they will be shot. So everybody went down. This little boy didn't\ngo out. He sit and he survived. My brother, the youngster, didn't go out, but my mother didn't\nwant to leave, that she should come down. She wouldn't leave without him. So the Germans\nstayed til he came down. That's the version from this little cousin of mine. And then when he\ncame down they left and took them all to the train. This was day before our New Year,\nexactly September 9, 42. So we know so much about it. But everybody said, \"Let's go.\u201d He's\na child. Maybe he doesn't know. You have to touch it to believe it. So we came to this house\nand when they saw me...a few people...\"Oh, my God, you're such a pretty child. Your mother\nshowed us pictures from you. She was crying all the day. Poor woman if she wouldn't go\nout.\u201d So we knew it already that's...that's the story what the little boy told is true. As we were\nthere the German were smart, so they start a new selection and they start to catch people\nfrom the street because they had all amount that they wanted, card or no card. So we start\nto...to hide again. But luckily, to tell you the truth I don't know how, I...we came...my father,\nmyself and the rest of us back to the shop. We didn't go back to the apartment. We were\nafraid that maybe they will take us away. We wanted to spend as much as we could in the\nshop. It wasn't safe, but better than at home. You know I worked in the night time. I...I fell\nasleep during the day. I couldn't sit in the shop. They wouldn't let me in. So I stood mostly in\nthe apartment. And this same time my father met an acquaintance and he said, \"You know, I\nam looking for you. Your son come to me from Miller 22\"...he was also from the Miller\n22...\"and he said, \"David, maybe you have a better...better bunker where I could hide with\nmy brother and my mother. I have the money. I will give you.\u201d And he told this my father.\nAnd I said, \"In my bunker is just the amount of people what we could go in, so I couldn't\ntake him.\u201d So my father was very abusive that he couldn't...that my brother was saved with\nmother. But he said, \"Please believe me. I couldn't do it.\u201d This man was a very selfish man\nand a very rich man. So my father said, \"And what you doing now.\u201d \"I have no place where\nto go.\u201d So my father said, \"It's okay. Come to my house.\u201d And he with his wife and child\ncame to live together in our house. I give even away my bed to his wife because she was a\nvery sick woman. She didn't look like Jewish at all with a little girl 3 years old. This woman\nsurvived the war thanks to me. Many days I didn't go to the shop. I was afraid and my work\nwas in the night. So I was hiding under my covers and I said, \"I don't care if I live or not.\nWhat do I have to lose. My mother is not here. My father is working. I can't talk to him. And\nI have...I am always hungry. I don't know how to cook and I have nothing to cook. So what's\nthe use of living.\u201d So he said and I was already 16 or 17 years old and this woman was very\nnice, but she had what to eat and she never shared. She never would say, \"Oh, Cywia take a\nbiscuit or something.\u201d No. Mine little cousin when we met him. He was a child. He stole\nfrom her things to eat and one day I give him an address and I said to him, \"You know, you\nhave nothing to lose. Go over the...the gates. Go to the Irish, to the Poles and go to my\nfriend. She will know who you are, and tell her that you're hungry. Maybe she will give you\na place to live. He went. He came back. He came back. He ate a good meal. He brought me a\nbread. Okay. So this family...he had a lot of money. She was hiding two little sacks under my\nmattress. She was afraid. I never looked in into the ___ believe me and I didn't care. And\none day, looking out from the window...was in the day time, I saw that the building was like\nthis that Germans are in the building. They are looking for people. So I took the cover over\nmy head. And I said, \"I don't care. If they come, they will come.\u201d So she put the little girl\nunder my cover and she sat on the side and all of a sudden boom boom boom on the door,\nbut nobody was open. It was like dumb. Pretend there is nobody there. After a few minutes it\nwas quiet and so they went away. Okay? (Sigh) Since this day, I said I am not staying here\nanymore. Because it was in my head if they take this little girl and I will see how they kill\nher...how they will kill me, I don't care. I wouldn't know it. But to see before how they kill\nher, I don't want to see 1t. So I went to work. I mean I didn't work because my work was into\nthe night. And I stood there as much as I could. So I stood there. Okay. My father find out\nthat...uh...my two cousins are alive and they work by the brocz (ph) shop in the brocz (ph)\nshop. I also forgot to mention that in the ghetto when I still had this good life in the ghetto I\nwent from day to day with mine...we were lived together with more people in the apartment.\nUh...So I met _____. Maybe you heard about him. What I went there because cousin's little\nboys to...uh...were sheltered there. My father's sister's children. And I don't know. It was a\nholiday or something and it was like a children's theater and my aunt said to me maybe you\nwould come to see. So I went. My grandfather was still alive. He died in ghetto in January\n1941...or may it was 1n 42. I think 41. And my father maked a separate burial because there\nwas...in dozens they put. But he was a very religious man and a decent man so he dug by\nhimself the...the graves. So I went and I met there a lot of people and I met him too. (Sigh)\nSo this was the life in ghetto til my father came and he was talking with people and the\nrumors were that the ghetto wouldn't be too long that Tebins and Schultz are going together.\nWe have to look to escape the ghetto. Where to escape nobody knows. But people did if they\nwere bought...uh...Polish papers that they not more Jews, but Poles. I couldn't do this\nbecause I looked very much as a Jew. I thought a German wouldn't recognize me if I am tall\nJew or a Pole. But the anti-Semitism in Poland was terrible. Ninety percent of Poles worked\nhand 1n hand with the Jews....with the Germans. So...but in the other way you didn't have\nnothing to lose. So one day this couple came to my father. They didn't have children. They\nwere from our town. They were also in ghetto. And they said, \"We have somebody. We're\ngoing to go to them. If you want, maybe you could join us.\u201d They maybe wouldn't confirm\nthis to my father, but they were looking for money in case if the people wouldn't take them\nwithout money. So maybe my father could pay for them too and this way they will go. So\nmy father said, \"In this minute I am not considering so much myself but mine baby, my\ndaughter.\u201d So he...my father came to me and he said, \"What would you say? Would you like\nto go with Lea and Abraham to the Irish side.\u201d I said, \"Not by myself. Only with you.\u201d It was\nsummer when they took away my mother. I didn't have any other clothes. I didn't have\nwinter clothes. So my father went and bought me a pair of boots and he prepared me and still\nfrom ghetto not woman, mostly men, young boys went out to the Polish side. They called\nthis the Irish side to work. They could have come in with two potatoes with a half bread,\nwhatever, you know, and that's like the other people could buy and live also. So one day my\nfather comes and says, \"They are leaving soon and I am convinced that you should go.\u201d So\nwhen Leshno heard that I am going, he wanted to send his son too. And by the time was a\nperson who lived actually in...in the wilderness there in the small town, going from\nroom...from farmer to farmer and they knew him and they give him something to survive. So\nhe went out with Leshno, with this young boy. Uh...And my father came and he said, \"Now\nis the time and you're going in 2 days and don't tell anybody where you're going.\u201d But I\ncouldn't hold a secret. I said, \"If I want to survive, I would like my cousin to survive.\u201d But\nthis time this little boy wasn't with us. We send him out. Go and look you should live.\nBecause a child, they didn't know he is Jewish. He was a blond, pretty little boy. So he\nwasn't anymore with us. And everybody was laughing with that...his face like this. I had long\nbraids, black and really looking like a Jewish girl, but my Polish was perfect. (Sigh) It's...I\nmean I had no other opportunity. My father says, \"But I wanted to...leave my secret to my\nother cousin. He was a very intelligent boy. He was older than I was, few years. And I said,\n\"Listen __, anytime you escape the ghetto, come to this and this place, I knew already this\nplace. My father told me because in 2 days I have to leave. But don't write it down. Just\nknew it. He was Warsaw born. He spoke already 5, 6 languages, very intelligent. Very\nintelligent boy. So, fine. So I had a little guilty on my chest that I let go my secret. And the\nGerman was bribed by somebody who went out for work that I would be on his\nworkmanship today. So, of course, I been 7 o'clock in the morning in the winter dressed in\nthe boots and a coat. The coat was mine, and nothing with me. . I couldn't hold nothing either\none. But I was wearing like 10 shirts and my mother's dresses here and there. That's what I\nhad with me. And I also could have had something because I am going to work so I had\nsome package and I had a___. You know, a __. I didn't know I am not supposed to have\nthis because the German were afraid that you have a bomb or ammunition inside, but I didn't\nknow it. And from this place I was instructed to come next building and there is a...like\na...also a German workshop where the Jews what they go out worked there. And they were\nworking 1n leather. So I came in. These two...this couple came in before. They weren't on the\nsame...uh...work out. This German was bribed. I don't know how much and what. But I was\nseparated from this people and I went in to this shop and I supposed to be in hiding and this\nguy knew it, the foreman that I am coming in. When the foreman saw me...his father was a\nfriend of my father. My father had a lot of connections. And he says to me, \"You going in\nthe Irish side. You fall like a fly. With a face like this, even if you polish your__. So I\nsaid, \"Benny, what do I have to lose?\" I said to him. He didn't survive. I survived. Why. I\nam asking this question always myself. And my best. I ask, \"Why, God, was I the fortunate?\"\nAnd til late afternoon we stood there. I supposed to follow this couple because I don't know\nwhere we're going in Warsaw. From there we supposed to be transport again. This was\nWarsaw. This was ___. I knew very well Warsaw, but since they separated small ghetto, a\nbig ghetto and here you could go and here you can't go so I was really was very mixed up.\nBut I followed them. I followed them and I walked. We supposed to go ____. There is the\nairport from Poland from Warsaw. I followed them. And it was snowing and you didn't see\nmany people. And I always hold a handkerchief to my nose because my nose was the main\ntrouble because a long nose don't look like Irish. All of a sudden I heard, \"Cywia, Go. Go.\u201d I\nam afraid to look back, but whose calling Cywia? I am following these two people and I am\nafraid to lose my eye on them. My father. What happened? What happened that he\nheard...somebody came to tell him that he...1f he wouldn't leave today, he could never leave\nagain. So he and Leshno bribed also to somebody by the work somebody and they took a\ntax1 on the Polish side and they went off. They knew Warsaw very well and he follows me.\nBut til he told me the story was 5, 6 hours later. But, thank God, I see him. Right? He was\ndressed up like a farmer and he looked...he was very thin and the mustache what he never\nwore it in specially for this occasion, he let it go. His Polish wasn't too good. But he came.\nAnd as we're walking, this people...this couple, I didn't see them any more. I didn't know\nwhere I'm going, but my father knows, but he went into the wrong door. He opens the door.\nIt was night. And this woman says, \"Karmaski, what you doing here?\" And my father got\npale and I stay here and, \"Who is this?\" He said, \"That's my daughter.\u201d\u2019 This was from\nTarczyn, from mine town, a woman I didn't know her because she was mostly in Warsaw\nliving in the same place. And when the German came she started work as a prostitute. And\nshe lived with the Germans. And I...we didn't know from this. Later on, we knew it. When\nshe saw us, she said, \"Well, as much as I like to help you, the Germans will be here in a half\nhour.\u201d And she start to pull out drawers and pull out big pieces like the table clothes, the\ncovers to cover the windows because we're here. My father says, \"Don't bother. How is your\nfather?\" \"Oh, he's fine. He lives in the same place. You probably will see him if you go to\nTarczyn.\u201d And \"Where you going?\" So my father says, \"I am going to Tarczyn.\u201d He was\nafraid that she's going actually next door. But we went out from her right away and my father\nbegged her not to say anything and, \"Oh, of course, not.\u201d And we went into the right door\nalready. We came into the right door, but this was nervous and heartbreaking. This couple\nwere there. My father's partner, Mr. Leshno, was there already too and they took us right\naway in the attic and then these people send out...they were poor people. The daughter which\nwas in her 20s went out and bought food for us. We didn't have nothing to eat. And, \"Fine.\nWe're supposed to be there.\u201d This was Saturday night and Sunday overnight. In the middle\nof the night, the voice says, \"Everything is ready. Who is going first?\" They supposed to\ntake us. It was 34 kilometers to Tarczyn. And we wanted not go to Tarcezyn, but to the sides\nof Tarczyn, to...through the forest to go to the village. And they don't want him to know it, so\nthey maked up that he will take us, the six of us. No. Leshno's son wasn't anymore with us.\nHe left before with this guy. We were four...five. Uh...So this lady said, \"She and her\nhusband would go separate, and I should go with my father and this Mr. Leshno.\u201d She\nlooked like an Irish woman and her husband _____ but she didn't want to go with us. So... but\nwe were supposed to go to the same place. We met there. Fine. So this guy took us, a young\nson from these people. They got paid. How much I don't know. And with the horses, with the\nWagen and we was like sitting like poor people, and they took us. And we went a few\nkilometers, somebody jumped out...it was still night, and Jews \u2014-_\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab Two Polish men.\nThey maked up with these people, you know. We were sold out. \"Give me your money. Give\nme a few jewels, what you have. Otherwise, we're going to take you to the Germans.\u201d My\nfather didn't know them. The guy didn't know them. I for sure not, but he start to shiver, this\nboy who took us...the son of this. Probably he knew what...who it 1s. Maybe the girl's\nboyfriend or whoever. We never find out. So they start from our, let's say, 5,000 slotas, but\nwho had the money? So between my father and Leshno they gave him a thousand or fifteen\nhundred slotas, which was a lot of money for us and they let us go. So I had no saying in it. I\nwas a little girl. So only my father and Leshno said, \"You can go back. We don't need you\nanymore.\u201d We were afraid more people like this will jump out and he could give us out to\nthe German. So we start to walk on the sideways (clearing throat again) til... We didn't have\nany much money, Polish money we didn't have any more. So we walked. We came to a\nsmall...uh...village and Mr. Leshno said to my father, \"We're going into Saboski.\u201d His name\nwas Saboski, a farmer, who was also dealing with my father, bought, you know, come to\nthe...to the mill, borrowed sometimes money (clearing throat). So we came in. He right away\nlike he said a prayer. Who am I seeing and he was afraid, but fine, it's Sunday night so the\nchildren are out, dancing or anyplace else, but he just put a poor man into the barn so he tell\nhim to go out. He will give him a few slotas so he will go and look for another place and\nwe'll...he will let us in just to rest in peace for a couple of hours. In the meantime my father\nsold him a piece of gold, you know, a coin and he sold...Mr. Leshno coin so he has Polish\nmoney to buy something. And we had a good meal. Milk and bread, and they were talking a\nlittle bit. But to hold us, he wasn't. He didn't need us. He was rich, a rich farmer. He didn't\nwant us. Where we going? We had a place but he 1s still the destination. So we went into the\nforest. We still had to make like 20 something kilometers and we went in the daylight. We\ndidn't want to walk because you could always see somebody so we stood mostly in the\nforest. About 5 o'clock in the morning we went into a farmer. We didn't where we're going\nin, but me and Mr. Leshno...my father couldn't go and Mr. Leshno spoke a little better this\nPolish and he knew more in this town..not town, village..people. My father didn't know so\nmany there. So we went in and there wasn't there a guy, the owner from the farm, but a\nworker. And he said, \"Out, you Jews, you go. What you doing here? You're going to shot.\nOut from here.\u201d So Mr. Leshno says to him, \"Can I speak with the owner?\" \"No, he's still\nsleeping. His wife is sleeping. Out from here. If not, the Germans are going to be here any\nminute.\u201d So we were afraid. So we start to walk again til we came like 5, 6 kilometers from\nthe place where we want to go in, but we cannot go in the daytime and we have to wait for\nthe night. So we staying in this forest and my father says, \"I know this forest very well, and I\nknow the manager from the forest and you stay here with Leshno and I go by myself.\u201d So I\ndidn't agree. I said, \"You'll never find us.\u201d Yes, he went with Leshno into this manager and\nhe was very much afraid this manager when he saw them, but his conscious didn't let him.\nYablonski was his name, and he took them in and he give them food and he wanted to see\nme and my father was very happy that he wants to go along but he didn't remember where he\nleft me. And I was sitting under a tree like this and all of a sudden a little deer comes around\nme, smells me...smells me and I said, \"My God. Is this an angel from my mother?\" I\nwas...you know, it's like a dream. And, well, he said, \"Wherever you go\"...he didn't know\nwhere we're going...\"Good luck to you. I cannot stay with you.\u201d And by the nighttime we\nwent to this place. We came to this place. This woman with the husband were there already.\nWe came to a place to a German woman. She wasn't...she was born in Poland, that\nVolksdeutsche, and she has a Polish husband and for the money, she takes us in. I actually\ndon't know exactly the money how many she got. I know they giving away a lot of\ngold...uh...but she also will have monthly money. When we receive the money from the\npartner, from the Christian partner, and a lot of lot promises from my father and him. Okay?\nSo right away, they have food and the bunker is made. We going in through the stables to a\nhole and middle is a pole. You cannot sit. You have to like this. When you lie it just like\nsardines. Uh...We been six people already. Two days later my cousin came. I was afraid to\nsay that I said to him. I didn't tell my father til he came..that I told him the place, and we took\nhim in to, so we have seven people already, like sardines. And it wasn't bad. You survive.\nAnd what'a going to be nobody knew. But we're in a good place because she was German\nyou know. But what we didn't know til the last minute when it happened that her husband\nbelonged to...what you call...organization against the German, but they were against the Jews\ntoo. What's the difference? But he wasn't okay. Then they were pressing him that he\nshould...uh...to be German to take care her nationality, and he didn't want it. So we're staying\nthere and a cousin of mine, second cousin came to stay next building. This was in the village,\nyou know, like...uh...farmer's house. She came to stay also by our farmer. They took her in\nbecause they know the family and my father and Leshno went in the night time so both the\nfarmers know from each other. So they went. Sometimes she maked a better meal so she\ngave something to eat, you know. And it was good this way. We stood there for a nice\ncouple of months til this couple said they're going to another place. They afraid to be\ntogether with us because we are too many. So they went to another place. We knew it...the\nplace. And the sent the brother of his brother came to live with us...to live in this (laughter)\nbeautiful surroundings. In the evening a lot of times this...they came that we could come\nin...in the house. So we came in. We had the water what she cooked for us with two potatoes\nand that's how we lived. It was like in this time before the holidays. And my father had a\nletter from a...from an estate. This called like a big farmer a that he owes my father\nthis and this money because my father bought from him were when he supposed...from the\nfields he brought already the...the...the corn already from him. The choice is by God all will\nbe alot or will be small, but he make a deal with him...let's say it will be a 100 ____ or maybe\n200, so I pay you for 170 or I pay you for 150. And this was the bill and my father paid in\nadvance. So these ____ from this estate had paid everything and we...this was a paper, and I\nwas carrying this paper with me to go with this German woman...he should give us some\nflour so she could make bread for herself, for us, and also because my father was religious.\nWe all been. We didn't want to eat bread for Passover. So she agreed that she will, with our\nhelp, will help make Matzahs for us. I went with her to this...uh...man til he took me in. He\nsat with me. He saw the paper. He said I should come another day. And I said, \"Frankly, I\nwouldn't like to come another day because I am taking my life in my hands like this. This 1s\nsome kilometers to go.\u201d And in this same talking I want him to kow that I didn't come along,\nthat I come with a Christian woman. I was fraid to say German woman because he could kill\nme and, you know, this way he has witnesses that somebody 1s dead, that I was told my\nfather... told me what to say. And I told him everything. He didn't give me nothing this time.\nSo we appealed to the people in Tarcezyn...to the mill people, and they give us flour. 50\npounds. And 2 nights before the Passover, I, my father. this cousin from the other guy, she\ncame in to us and he told us and we stood and she maked the oven. She had a oven in her\nhouse and we make the matzahs for Passover. We didn't have many because they liked them\nbetter than us, this German with her children and her husband, but we didn't need anything\nelse and we begged her...to my father didn't take any part in it. When she boils the potatoes,\njust right potatoes, no fat, no Schmalz, you know, because sometimes they put pork, little bit,\nand also from beets (ph) she should have make Wurst for us, so that what this. And in the\nnight time another few Jews came from other places. They know we're here. And in the\nbunker everybody was crying. We didn't have a seder, and my father make the seder. Milk\nand water was our wine. Not much, but everybody could get a drop. And this Mr. Pavlock\nwas his name, this German's husband...he was on top to see if nobody is around because it\nwas a little higher the emotions than actually it should have been. Everybody was crying and\npraying to God for a miracle, but we had a seder. And everybody went home with a piece of\nmatzah to celebrate the second night too. And from then on, my name was Ceshick (ph). Not\nCywia, but Ceshick (ph). Okay? Everybody went back home. And it was peaceful. From\nsometimes in the day, she said I should come into the house. It's quiet. I should watch the\nbaby. She's going out in the fields. One day she was still home and I was called in. She says\nto me...this German, \"I left the little dog outside, so if you know he's barking you should run\nin the oven.\u201d So I heard barking this little dog and I said...I was peeling potatoes and\nwatching the baby also. I was glad to be home, not to sit there. (Sigh) I said...all of a sudden\nshe heard voices. Right? So she ran out, and I ran in the oven. And this little dog saved my\nlife. The Germans came in and they asked about her husband, and they start to speak to her\nGerman and I heard every word...two soldiers ___. And they asked for her husband. If she\nwas very much tortured that her husband should take the nationality...the German\nnationality. Okay? So thank God, they left and I was saved. From then on I was afraid to\ncome. I was always there. One day it was really something. I had to use the bathrooms. I had\nprobably a loose stomach. I went in top and I didn't know that somebody inside from the\nbunker, the brother from this guy went upstairs already. So I went. It wasn't a toilet or\nanything. I released myself, and I want to go out...down. I see the doors are open and two\nmen came with a woman in. Uh huh. is here. A Jewish girl is here. So they spotted him to.\nSo I said...it was a hole here and I came to hide here. You understand? Not that we're hiding\nhere. And please don't kill me. Let me run away. So he said, \"Hush. Hush.\u201d So I and this guy\nstart to run. We run. We didn't want to say what, you know... But we had also learned that\nwhenever we going out to this place, you have to cover it back with straw, with all the dirt,\nwhich I did which was good. And they were looking for this man, for Pavlack. Uh...We were\nrunning, we both of us, and we came to a place, a farmer. He knewed everybody. So we said\nthat we very hungry, she should let us in. A very old woman from a fry pan she must have\nready for a dog...potatoes, you know, from who...whoever left them and she pulled red\nborscht on it and she put milk on it and water... like for a dog probably, and she brought us\nthis for us. It was in heaven. We both start to eat. I don't even remember if it was a spoon\n(laughter) and we stood there til in the night time. In the night time we went back to the place\nwhich was, Thank God, that we survived the day. A few days later the men came tn and he\nsaid during the day...1t was on a Monday...and the man said, \"I am sorry, but you must leave.\nI heard in town that I have Jews. And any day they could come. So I don't want any...you\nknow, anything to happen to you. So please leave. And when it's quiet you could come\nback.\u201d This guy was sick. He was a nice man. What was the problem? She got drunk, and\nshe said in the...1n the town there in the village...Sunday, Saturday, \"You will see how rich I\nwill get when the war is end.\u201d\u2019 Nobody knew it but when the war is end she will be a German\nbecause she will get rich...or she have Jews. They speculate. They didn't know it. So we have\nto run away. So my father says, ___. Where to go? We have nobody.\u201d So this is like 11, 12\no'clock in the bright day in winter. Go to the forest. Mr. Leshno and his son, right way they\ngo to this...they were a little relatives very distant with this couple, so they're going to this\ncouple. So my father said, \"Who cares. I am going too.\u201d We go, but we can't go together. So\nthey went separate in us. As we going through the forest...everything through the forest, and\nwe left everything here what we possessed. I had my mother's dresses which sometimes my\nfather took in the night time a dress and went out to another farm and sold the dress or\nbought a bottle of milk for it or this, but she took control of everything, this German woman.\nI also had beads, under beads. My father had this...he bought this for my mother as a\nsouvenir, a gift, and since I took mine mother's knapsack...everything...",
        "Q: Knapsack.",
        "A: Knapsack. So I had this there too. So she took this too...this German woman until she\nreturned after the war to me. Not all of them, but a few and I still have them and cherish\nthem very much. So we came to this forest, me and my father, and my father was very much\nafraid that somebody finds me I should be raped. I didn't know nothing about life. It wasn't\ntime to..to tell me, you know. And all of a sudden he sees this man. He says, \"I know you.\u201d\nA christian person. You...this and this name. At the moment I don't remember, but I did\nremember his name. Maybe you could take my daughter in. She's a young girl. I will stay in\nthe forest, but take my daughter in. He said, \"Karmaska, I would take you too, but they\nworkers working by me. They making oil, black oil from ___. I don't know this word. I\nnever saw it. It's like...uh...a flower, you know, by the Poles. So I really can't take you, but I\nadvise you should stay away from here because this day the German confiscate pork, cows,\nanything what's alive and dead, they confiscate...confiscate from the farmers. So, Thank\nGod, we're together again, me and my father, because he saw that he's not a dangerous man\nso we got together again. And I said, \"Dad, maybe we'll stay in the forest til the night and we\ngo.\u201d He said, \"No, if the Germans come they could come to the forest too.\u201d So we went to\nthese people. There was a lady with two beautiful daughters, not too rich, and she was really\nholding this couple to survive. And these two people came also Leshno with her son and\nhere we are also. We weren't too happy at all. My father was very famous in the town. She\nliked to speak to him and everything but she doesn't want to hold so many people, and it's not\nhealthy also. So we stood a little bit and then was very late and she said, \"Not right away in\nthe ice\"...to this couple or maybe just this couple said...didn't say anything...we speculate\nonly. \"We will go. If God give us our life\"... mean I didn't say anything because I still was\nlooking up to my father. To me he was God. And we survived so much, and everything what\nhe said it came out the right way so what can I say? (Sigh) So we went out with this that\nwe're going back to this place..we have no...to this German woman, first to have the\npossession there. Second, we'll stay there. So...but we were hungry. So I went into a store in\nthe...by the forest. I knew the person. He built in Tarczyn in mine house...1n our house, an\noven from tiles, you know, so I asked my father, \"Shall I say who Iam?\" And he said, \"If he\nrecognize you, fine. But don't say anything?\" My father was standing on the outside. So I\nwent in and I asked, \"Could you please sell me a bread, a half kilo of bread. I'm very\nhungry.\u201d He said, \"I know who you are and would I have bread I would sell you. But it's too\nlate and I don't have it. Maybe when you come another time.\u201d Okay. So I went out and I said\nthis to my father and we had to make like another 3, 4 miles...kilometers to this place where\nwe been. So here we come in, it was like...I would say 7, 8 o'clock in the night, but it was\ndark, very dark already by the forest still, and this German woman...this where we lived\nstanding and washing already my mother's nice things. I said, \"Why're you doing this?\" And\nalso the shirts from my father and from Mr. Leshno...what ever we had. She grabbed\nevery...cleaned up the bunker and she's washing. \"Oh, when it gets dry, you will get 1t back.\u201d\nWe never get it back. We had nothing anymore, and I start to ask for shoes from my mother's\nwhat I had. I had...from...in the knapsack and for the beads. \"Oh, what do you need it. What\ndo you need it.\u201d Okay. \"Can we stay.\u201d She said, \"I prefer this place should be a little clean at\nleast for a few days.\u201d She was right. But tonight you have to stay. Otherwise ... where would\nyou go? So I went in back with my father to this bunker and we stayed there. And the same\nnight Leshno came with his son, so we back four people there. My cousin went away, and\nwe didn't see him for a couple of days and he didn't know what the changes were here. (Sigh)\nSo we stood, but they weren't happy with us, and we knew any day something will happen.\n(Sigh) So we knew from one place where it's hiding a man, a acquaintance Mr. Leshno. He\nlost the whole family, but to take out a girl, for a wife, you know, to live with her and she has\nreally the looks from a Christian with a brother. So we decide...they decide we going to\nthem. But this is so far away. Like this is in the east and this is in the west. So the night 1s\nbig. So we start to walk. And we came there, and they agreed to hold us. It was no parents\nthere. Just a young boy, maybe 18, 19 years and small children. A sister was maybe 16, little\nboy 10 but he walks like he was 25, this little boy. I just drink something. If I could or not,\nbut I can't talk. So they agreed to hold us. So this couple, this man went in another place...but\nthe same farmer boy, he went to live in an attic from the house, and we took over his bunker,\nbut for the day time he came to stay with us because with us was more people. They played\ncards. They talked. So we stayed together. (Sigh) How long...maybe 2 months, 3 months\nprobably. Anyway we heard the news from around what happened. One nice day we heard\nthat the place by these German people... the Gestapo came they couldn't live without Jews,\nso they took in a family with two children and the Gestapo killed her husband, not with a\nshot, but like with a butt, not because he holds Jews. Because he was against to take the\ncitizens as a German. They would have killed her too but she was pregnant at the time. So\nthey let her live and as they were looking...I don't know, maybe for Jews, they find the two\nJews...the family. The little boy escaped. Two little boys were...the kids escaped. The parents\nwere killed. That's... knew them. They were also from mine town. It was a sister from this\ncouple what I went out together from the ghetto, from the Warsaw ghetto. And the time we\nheard also that the liquidate the ghetto and that was the time when my cousin came and we\nhad...we saw in the morning even the men brought us in burned pieces of paper from the\nghetto when the ghetto was burning, like from seders or from Torahs. Who knows what it\nwas. Probably just books. You know. The wind brought it back, and the smell was also...\nOkay. So we were living there. (Sigh) Nothing comfort. Hungry. But the best we could do,\nwe're doing only to survive. One night...",
        "Q: I think we better stop. They're going to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Okay. You can go ahead now.",
        "A: Okay. We stayed with this family in Pomyonka. That's how they call this place. And there\nwas no father, just a boy, a sister and...uh...two or three more children, and we were staying\nin this bunker one beautiful night...mustly we are people on the night, not on the day, so they\nbrought us in the night. The first we could speak clearly. As we were sleeping, Poles\ncame...young boys. Matter of fact, I recognized one who borrowed my homework from\nschool, and he said, \"Give me your money. You rich people. Give me your gold. GIve me\neverything.\u201d I said, \"___, you took books from me. How was it you never wanted to make\ncopy from me, and you're going to take my books.\u201d He slapped me and he pulled my boots\noff. Okay? He took away from my father this picture, all the pictures. A night or two before I\nhad a dream from my mother and she said, \"My dear child, if you want to save your pictures,\nmaybe you could make a little...uh...bag on your neck and this way you will save the\npictures.\u201d And I mentioned this to my cousin, and she said, \"Why not? I help you, and let's\nmake it.\u201d We didn't have any material so she took off her bra and in the bra was a double\nlining so she took the lining and make for me a...a little bag, and I put in all these pictures,\nand the pictures thanks to this you have it now. And the pictures survived. My father had a\nlot of pictures from his family from his father, from his mother. He was an orphan when he\nwas 9, 10 years old, so he had...still had pictures from his mother who died when she was 29\nyears old. And they all take the pictures. Don't ask me why...what they need the pictures, but\nthey took it. But the sad story was that the Poles didn't come along. They come with a Jewish\nboy. The Jewish boy was from our town. His name was __. And we saw him. He looked like\na Pole, and maybe he saved his life by giving out us to them. Money...they...we didn't have\nmoney. If we had it, we had only in, you know, what we had hid in hiding, sewn in the\ngarment what we had. And they took us to the room, together with this people, already with\nthis couple, this man and this girl who took out from the attic, and they put us in a line and\nwhen my father...uh...saw this and they took away already his pictures, he run. He has...he\nhad only his slacks and a jacket, and he had his pyjama under and he run. And from Leshno\nfrom my father's partner, they took the boots also. In the boots was a gold piece, so he was\nbarefoot. And they took my boots so I start to ask and beg in the room, \"Please give...take\neverything, but I know you. We grow up together. I went with your sister to school. Why\nyou taking my boots? We're fighting for our life. Please.\u201d And I was crying. So one give me\na Slap in the face, and I fell to the ground. After the war, I took care of him. That's the whole\nfamily came to Lodz to me to beg to me he should be released from prison. Through Russian\nsoldiers and through a Pole I got to him. What's with him, I don't know, but the story was\ntold. Not from me but from this Pole who was a friend. He was a Senator before the war.\nAnyway we ran out. Then they left. When they left, the guy didn't want to hold us. It's no use\nto hold us. RIght? So...and it was raining. It was early morning, like 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock. So I\ncannot walk in the...in the forest because it was after the...how you call this? When they take\nfrom...up the...the... I forgotten? When the farmers take off from the...from the ... I need this\nword.",
        "Q: Plowing or the...",
        "A: Plowing...no they didn't take up the plowing. The harvest! You know when I get nervous I\n(laughter) I lose the... the harvest. It was the harvest...after the harvest, so you know the\nstraw what they took off it went...it goes in your legs. I couldn't walk. But still they had the\nstraw staying to get dry so me and my cousin went into...to like on the straw like you saw in\na picture.",
        "Q: Haystack.",
        "A: The haystack. So we went in but we couldn't get in to..and here we have a whole day to get\nthrough with this. And my cousin also went into one, but he was by himself and he start to\ntalk to us, what we doing next and where are we going? It start to rain and it was windy, and\nall of a sudden one minute it fall apart, the straw and we staying like this. No people\nsurrounding. Nobody was there. So we decide we had nothing to lose. We start to walk.\nWhere are we going? We're going to a forest. But we had this maked up with my father.\nOnly thing what happened we meet but this Senator, ___\u2014_. He was a friend of ours. My\nfather had hidden this stuff what he always sold for us...a dress, a garment, something...a\npiece of furniture, we should be able to live. So by him is the best part to live. His brother\nwas the one who brought into the Warsaw ghetto sometimes money and she was the one\nfrom the mill what she got the pension and brought for us also. Very confident people. He\nwas the one who brought to trial this guy who took my boots. Okay. So we supposed to meet\nby him, which in the night time we met there. We came to him. He said, \"You go out here\nand here. You'll find your father.\u201d So my father had already boots. Through the day,\nLesh...my father had the boots, but Leshno had boots and had something to eat, so my father\nsaid, \"We have no place, but let's go and look for somebody also from the town. He\nmentioned once that he could have a place for us.\u201d This was already the night. So we went\nand we...we got this man. It was like oasis, with little trees, like a forest, and all of us went in\nthere and my father said, \"We will probably go to this place.\u201d But he went, this guy went. He\nsaid he's a relative...I don't know exactly to my father....to this and this guy ___ to ask him\nif he wants to make money so we could be by him. So during the day we went in this oasis.\nWe had nothing to eat, just what we'd brought up, but at least we were been all together.\nLeshno's son ran away so he went to another place, to another village where also there were\nJews, and I and my cousin and my father and Leshno and the cousin...the lady was 1n this\noasis and this guy went to ask this guy. He came back with good news, that they want to take\nus, and set the amount of money and the gained the promises after...after...after. We went\ninto this place. There was two very old people, and...uh...a bachelor's son and a younger son\nand a widower, a son-in-law. But the son-in-law was better than all of them. His wife died\nand he remained in the village, and he was working for the German by...uh...milk, but\nthe...the farmers brought him milk there and he make ____...uh...uh...sour cream and he\nshoveled this to the German. So a few dollars, for a few slotas he sometimes brought us a\nbottle of milk which it wasn't already milk, but was sour, but it was good for us. Okay. So we\nwere living on this and we were very comfortable. At night time they let us in inside and we\nhad not a meal, but fine. So we took our cousin also, the very intelligent boy and there he got\nvery sick, my cousin. And he was afraid to go to the doctor, and he start...because he knew\nso much, he start to cure himself, and he died there. And now like __ will have his\nand after the war we want to take his body out but the town didn't allowed us. My father did\na very much, a lot a lot, but we were afraid to start it, so he remains still his bones there, in\nhis field. We stood there and this old lady went occasionally to town and she brought bread\nand she baked bread. And we give them...my father give them money, and they live a\nlittle...a life a little more comfortable because they were very, very poor. And we had a nice\nplace by them. And also the same pattern...to go in, I have pictures here how we went into\nthis bunker, how many people we were there and nobody knew it. And this guy also stood\nwith us. We even like paid for him too. And one beautiful day...uh...they came to the town,\nand they said that the German come to the town and they going to occupy you, you, you...I\nmean the farmers' places, and we had to go. We had to leave. We had to leave. This was\nwinter, and it was very, very cold. A storm in Poland and we are not dressed. I don't still\nhave boots. I don't have nothing what to wear. (Sigh) So what do I have to lose. I went to\ntown. And I knocked on the door for my neighbor. Her husband worked us...worked in our\nmill and I said... she has no children. He used to like me very much because he said I said I\nwas used to sing. When I went to school late____\u2014\u2014\u2014s and I said, \"I don't have boots.\u201d I put\ndown the latest hiding and they like 2, 3 sizes smaller and I came and please...here...when\nyou get the money from ___ from the mill, please buy me a pair of boots and a coat.\u201d So she\nwent down, and she bought me shoes, and she bought me...high shoes, not boots, but high\nshoes, and she bought me a coat, and she gave me a good meal to eat, and I maked up with\nthe woman what she took me to town and she went shopping to me and I survived. I came\nto...to the hiding place back with a few dollars, with bread. That's how I got the shoes for me.\nAnd we were there. Okay. And she always borrowed my shoes...the lady, the old lady. It was\nthree sizes big. One day she said she wouldn't give me back but I didn't need it, I don't walk\nanymore. But when I...when we suppose to leave, she didn't give me my shoes. She give me\nher shoes. And they still were too small. Where do we go? We have no place where to go. So\nwe know from this place where the Jews are, by this old lady. We go to her. So we came\nthere. And the Jews they were hiding there, didn't let us in. They said they want to live. Too\nmany Jews cannot be here. It's very dangerous. But me and my cousin are young girls, they\nwould take in. My father and Leshno they don't want to take in. Okay. But the woman\nwanted to take in my father. She didn't care. This is the picture what I showed you and which\nI brought. So I said, \"If not my father, I don't want to go either.\u201d So I, my father, Leshno, my\ncousin, and Leshno's son went back to this place, to the oasis, to the forest, in the middle.\nThis was a Sunday. And we sitting, lying like this, not sitting, but from the __ from the\nforest. All of a sudden we hear from the town...from the village, boys are playing cards _,\nyou know, and we are like mouses. Quiet. All of a sudden, bang, bang, bang. We heard a\nshooting. I saw the Germans. I saw the police, the Polish police. I picked my head up and the\nworse part what it was, they had white cheese, like farmer cheese, apiece and a boy who I\nknow it, had a whole farmer cheese. He was so happy. He went out. He was killed. So I said\nbecause we have farmer cheese, we're going to be killed. So my father said, \"Don't pick up\nyour head. Just lay down.\u201d So I was lying after him. I don't know what make me do, but I\npicked up my head and I saw the bayonet...the... the...the...from the German and from the\nPolish...uh... policeman. They were looking...and for the...I can't remember exactly how the\nPolish organization . They were looking for this organization because they\nwere an organization also against the German, but also against the Jews. Okay. So this\nshooting what we heard...we been 7, 8 people. The players were also ___. They were shot\nfrom this Polish police and from the German. We survived thanks to them because they shot\nthem they head them off of us. But we saw them. My father, I mean, the rest of the people,\neverybody saw them. They didn't see us, but we could see them. Not the faces exactly, but\nthey have bodies. Okay. So in the night time we said, \"We can't stay here. We cannot stay\nhere. We have to run again.\u201d So a delegation went to this woman that she took...has to take\nus in. So she took us in. Okay? When she took us in, this Jewish people what they were\nhiding there, went away from her because the whole town know that she has Jews. They\nwere so hungry that they was eating leaves from...from like ___, you know, spinach, from\nthe...from the farm. They didn't have nothing to eat. And they give us some money, some\npromises. We lived on promises, which we...we...thank God we remained. The world was\ngood. They all had paid for it. And this woman took us out...took us in. Was very, very cold\nalready, and was a storm, and it was near like to the liberation already. So in the night time in\nthe storm, we didn't had meat and my father and...uh...Leshno went, but we have to go in for\nthe towns they maked holes so we had to go like two..two flopped down and then to come\nout. Otherwise, there was no way to get through to this...uh..village. So we went in. Fine. But\nwe couldn't get up. So my father with a cane...he was thin and very, you know, so he went up\nand then he start to slip me up. So I lost this bread what I had with me. I just had in my\npocket...from the coat pocket...uh...I think I had...uh... something...I don't know what I had. It\ndoesn't matter. I had something, a biscuit maybe. And...uh...he started to take Leshno up. He\nwasn't heavy, but he was 6 foot, maybe more even. Very hardly, he was begging, \"I want to\ndie here. Please, you go. You live. Go. Go. Go.\u201d My father says, \"No. You take it. You fell\none time. You fell two times because there's the water, and there's the snow inside. We came\nup. But now how do you go? If you go into snow, you make a lot of steps so the steps will\nlead to her. Right? So we went. Anyway we came there, and there we staying. Staying there\nwas a hard life there too. Til these the other Jews left. They had a hard time with them. Why?\nBecause it was too many of us in one place. She couldn't cook. She didn't had where to eat.\nShe had a pot with a hole because it was dripping out if she put water in. They were very\npoor. Primitive. Very primitive. (Sigh) So one beautiful day, we heard screaming. The\npolice there. \"Hey, Lady, where do you have the Jews?\" She said, \"What Jews?\" So one\npoliceman...I knew him..I had...I recognized the voice. He was __ by father plenty in the\ngood days. Malechewski (ph) was his name. With his son I went to school too. Was a small\ntown. Everybody want know each other. Tarcyzn was very small. So he slapped the girl. She\nwas 10 years old. \"You. Tell me where the Jews are.\u201d She said, \"We don't have Jews.\u201d So the\nlittle boy who was 8 years old heard that she denies, so he denied too. They took away our\nstuff, a few pieces of silver, you know, what this woman had taken from us. My father or\nLeshno give it to her, but this shouldn't be in first place this place because she hasn't got a pot\nor nothing to eat, and here she has silver cup what you make Kiddush on it you know. And\nwe had them to sell...to get some money or bread for it. Okay. When they left, these Jews left\nus too and we're by her hiding and hiding. Then her daughter came. A married daughter. Her\nhusband was a terrible anti-Semite. And they discovered us. Money. Good words. We\ntalked. We had nothing to lose. Where do you go? And we know it's soon it's going to be\nover because the American planes were on our heads. We saw it already in the night time\nwhen we went out from bunker we could see. We prayed for this moment. Right? So we\nstood there. No other returning. And one night people came. We were in bunker. By her it\nwas more in home because it was a cellar, and they were talking Russian and this was the\npartisans and they took the older boy away, and this week was a terrific day because the boy\ncame from church. They were very religious people, the Christian people. So he went to\nchurch and the Priest gave a sermon that he should help people but many times he came\nhome and he said, \"Hey, Maw. Maybe we should throw out these Jews?\" The priests said\nthat we shouldn't hold Jews or partisans because they will kills us. We had already news that\nthey took two Jewish girls for five pounds of sugar to the Germans and they escaped. And\nthis was my father's cousins. I include the pictures here...them. They survived the war. They\nare not living anymore. They lived in Israel. They left a nice family, but they don't live there\nanymore. Natural death. And so we were afraid. Right? So the church didn't work for the\nJews. That's for real. The anti-Semitism was terrible. If a neighbor knocked the door, they\nknew that this neighbor has Jews you couldn't stay another day. Even by the people what\nthey took from you the money and they very nice and they wait we should be liberate so they\nwill get rich, even they were anti-Semite. Why I don't know. I would never know. I am not a\nprejudice person. By me everybody's good and all the flowers are the same. One is yellow,\none 1s white and red. So am I. One...a person's a humanbeing and that's it. But the church had\na lot to do with anti-Semitism. So this boy came home and he wasn't in a good mood, and in\nthe night time during the night, this partisans came and they lie down on the floor under the\nopening from the...how we are afraid, and they talking Russians. I don't understand\ntheir...now I understand Russian. But my father understood. So he bent over like this to me\nand hold my arms like this I shouldn't cough. I shouldn't do anything. Thank God. We were\nhealthy in there. And everybody quiet til it got light, so he took him with his horse to some\ndestination. I don't know where. Three days later he came running...the same boy. Jew. Jude.\nGet out. Your're free. So we were like...we didn't want to go out. We were like paralyzed.\nAnd this same day we got flour for this woman and she baked bread. Each bread was like a\ntable round. So my father...he didn't see anything, but he touched the big bread and he's\nrunning. And here the front is going. And this was the...the...great..., you know,the\nholes...where for the tanks. And the stopped the whole army, the Russian army, and he\nscreams in Russian...he's Jewish and he's liberated and he is kissing this cop, this Russian,\nand the whole army stopped. And he's explaining and he catched this __ boy Ganick. His\nname is Ganick Vitishinski. I have pictures include from his mother. This is my man. By him\nwe survived and I am going to do everything from him, and we are free. And he's telling\nhim, so the captain says...major captain...uh...he's telling that his wife and his sons got killed\nfrom Germans, so he said, \"So's the whole world. Everybody's killed a little. I mean he\nmeant Jews because he came from Russia through with the front, and he know what is going\non. Okay? So and we were afraid that maybe it's not so. Maybe this will be German. But we\nsaw the German running...German soldiers running, and got killed also from...from this\nsoldiers...from the Russian. And they took the bread and my father came back to..to us, and\nthis night we didn't sit anymore in bunker. But from another town, ___, there was also a\nvery rich persons with an estate. He also...Leskinski __ 1n Polish is the name. He came...he\nheard this Kamalski, my father and Leshno is here so he came to visit. And they sat and\nkissed, but a few days before when my father sent this lady to say that Kamalski is around\nand occasion I see him, give him something to eat or give him a few dollars, Polish slotas,\nthat's not.... They were afraid already for communism you know. So he sat a whole night and\nspeak to them and in the morning we are liberated. So everybody from us, myself, my father\nand my cousin, Leshno we went to town. By this time my cousin, which was my father's\nsecond wife, remained in the place by this people what we had to go away because the\nGermans really came to them. They occupied all the stables. But she looked a little\nlike...uh...a Polish girl so she stood behind and she didn't want...she didn't care already for\nlife. You know, she was very depressed also. She was older than me naturally. So...uh...we\nmet her too as we went...continue. I didn't know. I didn't know much that my father and her\nwas a little romance. And Leshno also would like to marry her. It was like a competition a\nlittle. But...uh...I think my...she married my father for mostly the promise was to my father.\nShe was never married, and she was a true family...she was a far cousin to me. Okay. So\nwhen we were liberated, my father married her. And they had a very happy life, and I loved\nher very much. And she gave me a brother and a sister which I adore and I love them. My\nbrother was born in Poland and my sister was born Israel and very tight family. She died\nwhen she was 46 years old. Naturally, she had a heart failure...failure so she died. Okay?\nAnd my father died in '77. He was 77 years old. He lived in Israel and when she died he...he\nlike he died too. But we insist that he should pick up his life. He has small children. My\nbrother was 14 years old. My sister was 6...excuse me...12 years old. She was born when my\nbrother was 6 years old. And with letters...uh...1 begged him he should remarry and he did\nremarry and he wasn't happy. And I think from unhappiness he died. Okay?",

        "A: I was born 1925, September 15.",
        "A: I was a little girl in a small town, going to school, coming from school, no boys, just\nhomework and playing. My father was a wealthy man. My man was...if I remember my\nmother was never feeling well, so she has a special woman taking care of...for the children,\ngoverness, and for her. And we had a maid at home. It was a small town. Our town had only\nabout 2,000 people. Uh...My father was...uh...taking care of the synagogue and___\nmeaning riches. If someone had a store and maked a living, he was rich. My father had\n_ you know and we...I think he was wealthy, and we were very happy. For the summer we\nwent to camps. I had three brothers. The first after me was Moshe, the second was Abraham,\nand the third was Fishel. There was younger, rich, but one year... We were a happy family.\nMy mother had 5 sisters and | brother. The brother was a very rich man. He didn't live too\nlong in this town but he moved to Warsaw. Warsaw was like 32 kilometers from Tarczyn,\nand with a bus it's 30 minutes away. So we very often went. My mother...like for a dress or\nfor a hat or for something and always in Warsaw. And I had a happy life til 1939, til the war\nbroked out. And in school, they told us we have to wear masks because they were afraid for\nthe gas. They said they will supply, you know, the...uh...with gas so I came home from\nschool and the war broke out in September the Sth, 39,\u2019 and my life was shattered right away\nbecause my...we were afraid they will call my father to the army. My father was only 39\nyears old. So my father was a very religious man. To the mill what he possessed he had two\npartners. One partner which was like a relative to us and they started in school when they\n' beginning of the Second World War September 1, 1939\nwere young boys. My grandmother died when she was 28 years old. My father was 10 years\nold. And he had a stepmother like from a book, not a good one. So he was troubling\nand...uh...his friend was in the same position also without a mother. So they start like to\ndoing business about 10, 11 years. And they remained after 60 years partners like they're just\nrelatives, and with the kids...with the children we were also like relatives til today. So my\nfather with this partner went to Warsaw to this Rabbi. What the Rabbi said if he will be\ngoing to the army or should he stay in Tarczyn or should he go to Warsaw. So the Rabbi said\nthat he wouldn't go to the army. The Polish army doesn't need him. He's too old, 39 years\nold. But he should come to Warsaw. So my father came back the same day and when I came\nhome I...I saw that the maids are taking everything out from the closets and packing in sacks,\nin big, long sacks. So I said, \"What's this?\" So my mother took me aside and she said, \"Eat\nyour supper.\u201d I still remember what the supper was. Fish, fried fish. And..uh..we're going to\nWarsaw. And right away the men came. He took all the possessions from the room, from our\nhouse and we had our own horses through the mill, you know, so everything like...was like\na...we called this a Wagen, you know, like you see in America when the...the...the Mexico,\nyou know, and the horses, the big Wagens, and we took every...I mean they took everything\non the Wagen and we went to Warsaw. Our family and my father's partner's family. My\nfather stood still yet in Tarczyn, but my mother and the children and the maid and we came\nto Warsaw. It was a hectic night. The kids all were crying. We were upset, and what we\nheard was boom, boom, boom...the artillery and the shooting. So when we came to Warsaw\nwe came to a beautiful apartment, friends of mine parents were still....on the summer house\nbecause it was summer in Europe and we...this was ___, and we took their apartment,\nbut we didn't remain too long in this apartment because the Polish army moved in...in the\nbuilding with the...you know, so we were afraid. So my mother called her brother if we could\ncome to him. So my brothers and myself and my mother came to my uncle,__\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 23: in\nWarsaw. Two days later my father arrived and we been together. And that day the war\nstarted and there was fires and it was hell. But we still together. Not only us because then\nwas bombed this...uh...uh....house on the Granichna. So my father's partner came over with\nhis family together to us, and we stood together til the German occuped Warsaw. So the first\nday we wanted to go back to Tarczyn because in ghetto...1t wasn't yet a ghetto, but we were\nlike, you know, just us, and we didn't have too much food because we left everything behind\nand what we had we left in the Granichna and it was bombed after two days. But my father\nwent to a baker who bought from our business flour, and he gave us a whole, like 50 pounds,\na 100 pounds of flour, and my father brought it to the...my uncle and my mother and my aunt\nbaked hallahs, bread, so we had to eat. But was a hard time with water. We didn't have water.\nSo we put on...on...for the children...for us...like for me, it was like a game you know. We\nwere small. We didn't understand so much...on a pot, a belt to carry the water and we went to\nthe Visla (ph) for the water. It was like a half hour maybe, a hour walk but til we were loaded\nwith water, was heavy the pot, you know, to carry. That's the way we brought the water. Till\nmy father one day said to us...this was also September, like 15 because before 15...15 was\nmy birthday...and I remember sitting with my mother and with everybody there from hiding\nfrom the bombs and I said, \"That's my birthday. I maybe get killed from the bombs.\u201d And in\nthe same day my father was...went to the Rabbi with my two brothers on the ____\u2014\u2014\u2014. He\nwas...by the Rabbi...what he believed in this Rabbi, and a bomb went in...in this shelter and\nthe whole building came down and my father start to scream to this Rabbi, \"Is this how you\nso holy that I am getting killed, my children and everybody?\" So the Rabbi said, \"Don't\nworry. You'll be alive and you will still see your grandchildren.\u201d And all of a sudden like a\nwindow was opening in the ground, and my father was out from the...from the, you know,\nbombed out house, from the shrapnels, and he pulled out my brothers, the two brothers. They\nwere injured, the face and scratches and he took and then he slipped out the Rabbi too and\nthey came to us in the evening and the Rabbi...and we couldn't stay in my uncle's apartment\nanymore because he lived in the third floor so we went to stay in a store in the same building.\nThey had a dairy store with people. They didn't have children, two old people. So they\nagreed to let in this Rabbi because he needed a room by himself. He was a very holy man.\nAnd we also stood there. Not only us, but practically the whole building of people were\nstanding like sardines because it was low for bombs so we were standing there. And then\nwhen the war was over...the war I mean the 39 the German occupied Poland, so my\nfather...somebody came already and said our mill was bombed and we have nothing to go\nthere. So my father started to the Rabbi to scream, \"Where are you? What I am going to do.\nEverything is bombed?\" And the Rabbi said, \"Believe me. Not you....uh...not you mill 1s...1s\nbombed.\u201d In the same town was my uncle. My mother's brother was a very rich man. He had\na mill in the same neighborhood what my father and actually my uncle's mill was bombed\nand burned and ours was partly burned but not completely. So my mother wasn't able to go.\nWe didn't had any communication to go back to Tarczyn. So we start to walk. Myself, my\nfather and mine...one of mine brothers, and my father's partner and his son. I will name him\nMr. Leshno and another two people. It was a distant relative of ours. He also went with his\nson to Tarezyn. 32 kilometers. We maked it in a few hours. We get to come home. But we\ncame near to the town. The smell was terrible. From fire, from bodies, from sweat. It was\nvery hot. And we saw as we came to the town...uh...I could...everybody could see our house,\nand it was like the edge burned the house and in behind was our mill. So we came back to\nthe house. I opened the closet. It was still eggs and butter and cheese from the night what we\ndidn't finished our supper and what everything and all sugar and jam and everything because\nthe war was going ___ we didn't suspect that we will have to run away. So that was good\nfor us, that we had right away everything. Also a cousin of mine moved in to our apartment\nbecause her house was burned and she actually saved this house because...with water...was\nno firemen at the time...so with water, with buckets of water she saved this fire shouldn't go\nfarther. And we were again happy to stay. Right? As a child you ask me what I remember. I\nremember I was afraid to sleep in my bed because after all...uh...the two, three weeks I didn't\nsleep in a bed. I was always sitting or lying on the floor, no bed. So I went to mine aunt,\nmine father's sister to sleep. She had a restaurant in town, and she had a girl, my cousin, mine\nage. And we like each other very much. I said I would sleep with my cousin Hilda, and I\ndon't want to sleep at home. So my mother said, \"Fine.\u201d\u2019 Oh...and at the time my mother\ncame also to the town back. And I ran around to my aunt's to see if everybody 1s alive, and\nthe town had a square and a lot of Germans in it. And I was very much afraid and people\nwere running up to the Germans with a cigarette to sell bread or something and I slept this\nnight by my aunt. In the morning about 7 o'clock, my father came in and talked something to\nmy aunt and I was very anxious to know what happened. And they didn't want to tell me...a\nchild...what happened during the night. That the German with the Poles come into our house\nand they took out my cousin, the woman's husband who let...who saved this house from the\nfire with my father with mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno. They took him on the attic. They\nwanted money. So my father said he has no money. He has the mill. And it's after the war\nand I don't have money. And the German...was few Germans, not only one...each one took a\nperson like the three of them and start to beat them and start to scream they should run away.\nSo my father was afraid to go to his room but on the attic a tailor was living there, without\nchildren, a nice old Jewish poor people. So he went into them and he sat til the morning\nthere. But he was afraid to tell my mother that he's alive. And it was the first night in the\ntown. So, of course, my mother was very upset in the morning and my father came to my\naunt to tell her what's what...that from now on he will remain there too. It didn't took too\nlong. It took about maybe 2 weeks. My father decided he's going to be free. He cannot live\nlike this so he decided...he and my cousin and mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno will go to\nRussia. First, they go to Warsaw, and later will go to Russia to Bialystok (ph). They said\ngoodbye to us and my mother was crying. She screamed, \"I am already a widow. How do\nyou leave me?\" But he left the money and a lot of people owe us money also. So we\nremained in the town with the maid. The maid had no place where to go. It was a Jewish\nwoman. She raised us and she was like a family with us, and we stood there. And my father\ndisappeared. We didn't know what and where and what. Occasionally we got...I mean my\nmother got...just had the news. My mother said, Oh, your father's fine and everything 1s\nalright. Maybe we'll some day be able to join him.\u201d So...uh...we stood together in this\nTarczyn, and nothing specially, you know. We lived without... just with the hope that we will\njoin our father and maybe the Germans will let us live in peace. (Sigh) Then one day what I\nremember, my mother said, \"We're out of money and I have to go to Warsaw to Mr. Flynn.\nMr. Flynn was a Polish German. That means he was a German by birth, but he lived in\nPoland. And he had...uh....we call it here commissioned bakery, and he owned us a lot of\nmoney so maybe he could give us some money. So my mother left and my younger brother\ngot very sick and I didn't know what to do. I was like the woman of the house so I called a\nneighbor. She was a nurse. And she give him some medication and make us not cry and the\nmaid was very good to us. And my mother went to my uncle and from my uncle they took a\ncar and they went to this bakery. And on the way, as they was driving on this...I don't know\nif they went by druska we call this with two horses and a wagon, you know, like a rickshaw,\nanother rickshaw met them but like back and forth and there was my father with partner and\nwith my cousin and my...my father's partner said, \"I think I see Frymet.\u201d Frymet was my\nmother's name. So they stopped the rickshaws and my father when he...they arrived with\nmy...with Leshno, they...they really don't have money, so they went right away to this Flynn\nto this...uh...man. And my mother went to him, not knowing, so actually they meet on\nthe...met on the street. What a coincidence. So this was a happiest day for us. My brother's\nvery sick and here I have my father back and my mother. Instead we're supposed to go to my\nfather, they came back to us because in Russia they give us...they get them a few days to\nmake their mind or they want to stay with them and they go to Sibiria or other places in\nRussia or they're going back. So it was not only for my father but all the people was like a\nmixup. Nobody wants to know...nobody knowed where they're going. This was my\nrecollection as a little girl what I remembered. And...uh...my father came back and he was\nmore calmly, wasn't afraid anymore, and he went in back to the mill and they started to do\nbusiness again. And this...uh...German Pole from the bakery gave him money. I mean he\npayed him what little by little, and we had a comfortable life. I wouldn't say no. Again I\ndidn't have any worry as a child. School wasn't any more for us. So my parents hired...uh... a\ntutor and 5, 6 children been together and we learned whatever. Wasn't much, but was enough\nto...to go along, you know. And then it started to be very bad and my mother was afraid that\nmy father should go to Warsaw to collect the money for the...so I volunteered and I went\nwith Mr. Leshno once to Warsaw. I carried the money and one day a German came over, not\nto me, to Mr. Leshno and he took him away to work. And I didn't know what to do with me,\nbut I know what where to go. So I went to my aunt, my mother's...uh...brother. And I start to\ncry. They took him away and... So they said, \"It's nothing. They catch people to work. He\nwill be soon there.\u201d And good enough he came in the night. He finished the work what they\ntold him to do and he came and we came back to Tarczyn. This was my last time I went. I\ndidn't want to go anymore. And we stood in this Tarezyn and life went on til it was very bad.\nAnd my uncle...they start to talk about the ghetto in Warsaw, so my uncle decide that he\nwants to come to live back in Tarczyn because he was from Tarczyn because he got so rich\nso he went to live in...1n Warsaw. So in the meantime they make also from Tarczyn...uh...a\nghetto...that all the Jews have to be in one side. Uh...Everybody in the town liked my father\nbecause by him it was no different. Jew, Christian. He didn't eat alone. He ate if everybody\nhad food. He didn't sit down to the table to the seder. That was...you asked me what I\nremember. I just remember we were 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock still by the table, sleeping children\nbecause he run to the houses to see if this people had food. If not he carried from our home\nfor them. As a little girl I remember many times before a holiday I was very ____ like\nchildren in school. My father makes like a nut in a handkerchief. There probably was money,\nno doubt about it, and go here and here. Don't say from who. Just give it. So a Christian\nperson who was...uh...couldn't say he's a friend, a person from the town came to my father\nand he says, \"Mr. Karmaski, Too bad they're a making a ghetto, the son of a bitches.\u201d Excuse\nme. \"But can we change with apartments. I know you have a clean house and I have small\nchildren and I would like to change with you because he was living in the side what the\nGerman give us. And we changed with him. So my uncle, with his family...he had two sons\nand a wife and a maid...so they came to live with us. And it was also, as a child it was happy\nfor me. It was harmless you know, a lot of children and we had our curfew. We couldn't go\nout like in the evening, but it was nice. We were...we lived nicely 1n this Tarczyn til they\ndecide that it's not good. Everybody has to go to Warsaw ghetto. Our small town had 350\nfamilies. So being in ghetto in Tarczyn a lot of people got...the poor got poorer, and the rich\nones survived. They ate, but the money didn't come in so it was very very bad. (Sigh) So we\npacked our possessions, what we could. I, as the older daughter, I was sent to Warsaw.\n(Clearing Throat) Excuse me. I was sent to Warsaw, also on a Wagen, with mine friend,\nthat's mean my father's partner. They still were partners, and we went to my uncle so my\nuncle went back too ____ his apartment in Warsaw and being a few days with my uncle,\nhe...uh ...uh... rent a room for us by a family. This was Carmaliska 15. So I stood there with\nour maid and with my two brothers and my mother and my father came the last day when\nthey had to go out from Tarczyn. So we lived in ghetto already. And from the whole Poland,\nfrom everybody from each each town, everybody came into...to Warsaw. And Warsaw was\nalready a ghetto. Was a small ghetto and a big ghetto. Carmaliska 15 belonged to the big\nghetto. Uh...My father received every couple weeks, couple weeks I couldn't say, once a\nmonth, once in 2 months, and from time to time we knew from which time to...from the mill\na salary. The good thing was because we had a partner also, beside Mr. Leshno. A Christian.\nHe was in the government, in the Polish government, a big shot. A president, but not a\npresident like you have...uh...President Bush or something, but he was something. I really\ncan't explain it what that he was a big shot. When the war came out in 1939, he called my\nfather and he said, \"Listen, Karmaski, I am going to leave you. I am going to America with\nmy wife. His name was President...President Shelpelski. And he left. After the war, when I\ncame to America I met his wife. She was living in Long Island. And she said to me, \"Please,\nMrs. Karmaski...(she didn't know my married name)...\"I want you to tell my neighbors from\nwhere I am coming and who I was in Poland because I don't know if they believe me.\nShe...her husband died, and she was living very poor. Matter of fact, I bought her Chanel 5,\nand she hugged me and it was very happy. When we went to the ghetto, this President...this\nPresident Shelpelski left a daughter, a married daughter from the 5th marriage. This was the\nsecond of his...1n Poland. Her husband was a major. The daughter's husband was a major in\nthe Polish army, and she was by herself in the mill. Of course, she had workers and she...and\na boy friend. The boy friend was a terrible anti-Semite. She was afraid for him, for Bollick\nthat she's helping us. But Richard, the engineer, was a very nice guy. I met him many times\nand he gave me money when I was hiding. And I thank to the mill with his wife because\nnobody from from the Poles would take us in without money and without promises that after\nthe war, they will be big shots or rich. (Sigh) Anyway...so that was our support from them.\nComing back to the Warsaw ghetto, as we received money from them we saw it's getting\ntighter and tighter and tighter. Of course, I couldn't say that I felt anything, but as a child I\nwasn't going to say that I wanted to knew much secrets from the...from the growing up\nbecause they always shhhh shhhhh not to tell the children. But from day after day you pick\nup some words. Right? Uh...My father decided...he was afraid to go to court. It was a court\non Leshno which was divided in half. Half was standing in the Christian side and half in the\nghetto. The woman who brought us in the money came to court. My father had a piece of\npaper. It wasn't really....he ordered himself that he has a court this and this day. The German\ndidn't know what it is when he willed in through the revealing doors. He went in. He met this\nwoman, and she gave him the money. She got paid for it. She took right away up her\npercentage. And then my father shared with my...with his partner. So we had a few dollars to\nlive. There weren't too hungry. We weren't too well off, but we were okay. One day my...my\nuncle came to us and he said it's not good. I heard this rumors and this rumors. You have a\nfew dollars. I have a few dollars. Let's do something. So from the Rabbi what my father was\nbelieving so much, he had acquainting man. This man before the war he wasn't a farmer but\nhe had cows in Warsaw, and for the sake of the cows he selled the mill and he lived. So this\nman talked in my father to buy cows, and they could buy them and they transport\nthem...Polish people transport them to the ghetto. So my father and my father's partner and\nmy uncle and another few Jews shared it. It was very expensive. And they had like a dozen\ncows. Analefski Street. It was a like from a big store made...uh...a place for the cows and\nthey hired a couple, the man and the wife what they milked, you know... Is this word they\ncall? milked...uh...cows. And the 5th you had to give the donations for the poor, and for the\nopens, the milk and then the rest you could sell. So from this we lived. My father woke up 5\no'clock. The minute he could work, you know, free to...it's safe to go, so he went to this...to\nsee how many liters or quarts what we call here...the milk, the cows were giving and all the\nfamilies lived. Not to make money, but we lived. Okay. And then I...my mother said that\nfather is very tired and maybe he shouldn't go and we children we should go because the\nminute when you walked out from the door to the street 1t was unbelievable to see. Young\npeople and old people like flies, deaths, deaths, deaths. Fallen people, hunger people, on the\nstreet. So my father didn't go but us children we went. Me and my brothers and from the\npartner the son went and whatever was left we were carrying the milk in special cans, you\nknow, to the apartment and from the apartment we had our places what we bought milk. We\ngot paid from people say they pay another time the 20 cents or the 50 cents what it was\ncontainer of milk. I lived there went there. And I think we lived I wouldn't a happy life, but\nwe lived. Uh...We had...mine mother had a sister living in Sobolif near Lublin and another\nsister who lived in Warsaw also in ghetto got very poor. She didn't have any money. So they\ndecide to shift her to this other aunt to Sobolif so she went with her sons there. And we stood\nin ...1n Warsaw ghetto and many times people came with regards from their were __ very\nreligious town so we could get from time to time a kosher meat, what they smuggled in\nfrom...not from this town, from Sobolif or from Otvorz (ph), and they came to the ghetto and\nthey had their clients or sometimes we had meat also which was a holiday at this time. And\nthis was til 1942. 1942 my cousin came, my father's sister's daughter from a small town. I\ndon't know the town. I don't remember. (clearing throat) That...uh...her brother-in-law and\nother relatives were kidnapped. She called this kidnapped. And she escaped. She doesn't how\nand she still doesn't know how she came to Warsaw ghetto, and we should have known that\nthey killing Jews. And in the same time they said that the Jews will live til July 22. And it\nstart to be like, you know, not easy. Not easy! And then it started that every Jew should\nwork. I never worked. I was a child. So my father had a lot of connections. He came home\nand he said, \"I think I managed something.\u201d And what my father did started it. So they\nbrought...they bribed somebody that I went into work. My work was by the Germans...it's\ncalled a shop. This was Tebin's shop. There was slavery, and they worked for the Germans,\nfor the army, of course. Tailors and hat makers, a shop. A big shop. For me it was like, I\nnever saw this. My work was...uh...sitting by a table and it was in a bags a lot of hats and the\nelastic in front by the heads were sewed down from the tailors, but there and there was a\nstring, you know, so I had to clean up the thread and cut with the scissor. I had a scissor. It's\nnot big work. It was...only if they would let us work because every minute a German came in\nand hit us or took us out. Some he took out never came back. Some they took out they raped.\nSo we were always afraid. I...my mother worked also in the same building. I worked on the\nfifth floor. She worked on the second floor. She stamped leather pieces. Little pieces what\nthey...to suitcases or what you're wearing on the back the shoulder, you know. What you call\nthis?",
        "A: So this kind of... My bro...my father also worked by the same thing and the brother too. I had\nby the time already two brothers, not three because one was selected. It was...they came and\nthey took him out. They took out everybody. And they took him. He was hiding in one of the\nhiding place in the apartment. They took him out to the Umschlag. Uh...As they were\nworking one day they start to give us Kenncards. This was like a piece of paper which opens\nand said that you allowed to live...in German not in Polish. Everything was in German. I\ndidn't know what the line is for it. They took us out to make a line so, of course, I stood in\nthe line. So I was scared. I received a card like this. I didn't know what it is. And many\npeople...the one who didn't receive, they told go in the night or in the left. Actually in the left.\nI was to the right. You know, as I am talking, I could... And after they said, \"Let us go back\nto work.\u201d And we saw it's missing a lot of people from these for...but we didn't know for\nwhat. We didn't know if they're going to live or we going to live. But we were the lucky one.\nThe same day my father received a card like this. My mother wasn't working this day\nbecause they make the come in the nighttime for work. It was a 24-hour work. So my father\nreceived a card like this and I received a card. But then we knew it already what it is. That\nit's very important. Okay? So we the lucky one. And the same time they maked me...not to\ncome during the day but to come...that's how they mixed up people...to come in the night to\nwork. So I went like 4:30, 5:00. Most... wanted to go earlier because you were more safe in\nthe place where you walk because during the day you don't see anybody in the street and\nthis...the apartments were looted. But the time I wasn't living anymore Karmiliska 15, but we\nwere told into_Novolitki (ph) 42. This was also a friend of my father's who went to live with\nhis daughter and he give us up his apartment. So we lived there and my father's partner too.\nIt was like four families living in one big apartment. We couldn't...we didn't have many beds.\nI was sleeping with my mother. My brothers were sleeping on the floor. I think my father\nalso on the couch or something. It doesn't matter, but it wasn't already what it was. And we\nstill had the maid. I mean she was like in the family. It was no more maid, but like a family.\nAnd then one day they came and they took her away with my cousin. And we went to work\nand by work they said that we're going to live...I mean people just gossip...til July 22. And\nwas even a song about it.",
        "A: The song...if I remember it. Was something from my long home I could get out some more,\nbut very little. Very little. As I say til this point, til I went to work, I...I...childish...you know,\nI didn't give too much thought about it. I'm young and I didn't think about it. I didn't realize\nthat there could be such a terrible thing done to people. Uh...So finally it came, this day.\nThat's when we...that we heard...1t was all over the whole ghetto. Papers pasted out that all\nthe Jews had to come to one spot and this was this spot. It was three shops in the whole\nghetto. One shop...(clearing throat)...one shop was Tebins, the biggest one. The other one\nwas...uh...I just remembered. Fo Broczes (ph) I don't...I just remembered it. Schultz. Schultz\nwas working the same work what we. So the...the...the rumors were that Schultz and Tebins\nwere going to go together. And the Broczes (ph) which was in the small ghetto, they only\nwork by Broczes (ph). They will remain. But it...1t was just rumors, you know. (Sigh) So we\nwere living....this was already a good life. Hungry, working, and no future. Uh...But when\nthese signs on the streets were that everybody has to come in one place, my mother didn't\nhave a card. So I took out this card and I said, \"Mommy, this is your card and you go with\ndaddy and you take both children\" ...because my brother is very small. My age I was 14 I\nguess. I was already big. I was very tall and thin. They wouldn't let me through anyway. I\ndon't consider any more a child. So you go with this brothers. And we were sure we're going\nto work. And I said to my mother, \"You write Mommy. You will write me.\u201d And hardly my\nmother accept this Kenncard, but she did accept. Until the middle of 18 we still could work\ntogether in the lines. Was six people in the line, end of it, and the line it was really not to\nprescribe...not to describe how long it was. It was a terrible way down. The heat was maybe\na 150. Nobody had a drink. The _____ on the back, the shoulder bags...everybody had a bag.\nI had a few slices of bread and I think an onion in it and my clothes and like a girl, you\nknow, a pair of shoes. I also...when my house was looted in...uh...Karmiska 15, I went back\nwith the maid so I find my mother's beautiful pair of snake shoes and I always liked them so\nI took the shoes and I took them to mine so I was holding the shoes too. As we was marching\nI saw in the line my aunt and my uncle. That's the rich one. And her two sons. And another\naunt, my mother's sister. And we couldn't talk, but we waved. With our eyes we make like\n\"God knows where we're going.\u201d but still going. We know we going to the Umschlagplatz\nbecause this was Miller 18, and around the streets there. I was also...on the sixth I was with\nmy friend, Henry Leshno, my cousin and his brother and another two girls. I didn't know\nthem. I know them only from the shop. And this girl was probably mine age, but she had her\nmother and her father. And I was really jealous because all three had cards and I didn't had a\ncard. I think this was my first ttme when I start to be jealous of anybody. And thank God this\ngirl survived and her parents survived. Not the war, but to come back. And we were in the\nline. Because I didn't had a card, and my uncle and my aunt didn't had a card, so we went to\nthe...with them, and I separate from my mother in case...and no words to talk, but crying and\ncrying and write and don't worry. Ma, your health you know, and you will survive and we'll\nsurvive this. As a child, you know, I could feel I didn't have too much words to...to comfort\nher, and she and my father went different place because they had the cards. My mother was\nstruggling with me. She wants me to get a card, but I was very much against it. I felt young\nand strong. And they went away. As we came to Moranofska (ph), with us all and we stood\nand I said to this Henry...he was like a brother to me...I said, \"Henry, we don't know where\nwe are. We here with the aunt with this, but why can't we still go to be with my mother...with\nour parents.\u201d\u2019 He had a second mother, but very good woman and like I start... was...I'm a\nlittle older. He's alive. We're very good friends. And I start to agitate him, \"Let's go. Let's\ngo.\u201d And we went. Me...and I make his brother also to come, and the three of us start to look\nfor my parents. And as we're looking on the Miligas we knew a lot of people and they said,\n\"Oh, you're father is looking for you.\u201d In the same time my father start looking for us\nbecause they saw it's...it's not true. Everybody could still still be together. Was a terrible hot\nday. Humid. Hot. Without a little water. Finally, we find my father. My father said, \"Thank\nGod, we find you.\u201d And we came to Miller 22. There is the place where my mother sat on\nthe floor by the house and about an hour or so even my uncle come with his wife because we\nsaw we're not separate. We could be all together and we find a lot of people. But this time\nmy father...not only my father, but everybody...was starting to look to buy this Kenncardes .\nSo, of course, my father was starting to look for me for one. Couldn't get! But my mother\nsaid, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014s They don't let parents with children through. Just the opposite. Let me give\nback to Cywia the card. And you go with Cywia and I stay behind with my family, with the\nbrothers, with the sisters. She still had her brother. And with her friends. And if it's possible\nyou come with us or send for us. People went out...uh...with on the wagons as dead people,\nshoveled in...in the casket you know and went out so we thought maybe this way. A lot of\npeople had bunkers in the houses and they went in. They didn't give us too much time, as by\n5 o'clock they already...the Germans come with the \"Halt. Halt. Halt. Halt. Halt...and the\nmachine guns went boom, boom, boom a whole day. (Big Sigh) And they start to organize\nthe line, who's going to go left, who's going to go right. You never knew what the left line is\nor the right line is. Okay? So here it goes so quick. My father start to say goodbye and in the\nmiddle he fainted by saying goodbye to my mother. And I stay with the Kin card in the hand\nand I don't know what to do, and what to say. My mother's hand with me I should put down\nthis...uh...how do you call it?",
        "A: Knapsack. Right. Knapsack. You want to know that she give me her knapsack, not mine,\nhers, with all her dresses. There were a few pieces of bread and an onion inside. An onion,\neverybody had an onion because they said an onion 1s good for you. And she took mine. As\nmy father was fainting, my aunt catched a piece of paper. Water...was no water, and start to,\nyou know, revive him, and I said to my mother, \"Go hide in this place.\u201d And she kissed me\nand it's no more words. What can words say? And I am walking with my father out and\nLeshno with his son and the rest of the people who wanted without Kenncard is go...could\nalso stay 1n the line. It doesn't matter if you have a Kenncard or not. Everybody was to make\na line and to go. So this Leshno's brother... handled him the picture frame. He was always 6\nfoot, strong like a ox, was will us in the line. They took him away this way and us 1n this\nway. We didn't know where we going. But what I witnessed before was a man before my\nline, before my face. He had on a enormous big knapsack. His name was Wassermann. He\nworked with me by Tebins, not cutting...this was the woman's work. He was sewing the hats.\nHe was a very wealthy man before the war, but in the war he got poor and then got he he\nwent into work to Tebins and he had a little girl about 3 years old. He had her every day by\nwork and if the Germans came in, myself and Dr. Bussow...I was working, also cutting. Dr.\nBussow was a nice lady. Her husband was a physician, children doctor...took this little girl in\nthis box and covered her with the heads she should survive the, you know, the Germans what\nthey came in to watch us work. He had this little girl in the knapsack. He gave her some pills\nto sleep and not to move and they took out this little girl and killed her in my eyes. I should\nsay in our eyes we saw it. And they took him also away beating. So I was happy in my\nmemory that my mother didn't see this and didn't go through because she had small children.\nMy brothers were small. So we went this way and they went this way and sure enough...of\ncourse, when I passed I showed the card and they let me through. I was very tall on my age\nand very thin. And this Dr. Bossow said to me, \"You have two bright eyebrows and the\nGerman don't like this.\u201d So she took me in aside as we were walking, still in the shop, and\nshe plucked out mine eye brows, and I was screaming because it was hurting. Come out.\nThey didn't go out (laugh) the places. Okay. So I was fortunate that they took me back. I\ndidn't mention that as we went to the Umschlag Plaza place, somebody fell in this line, and\nthe German run and right away it's like a pyramid. One fell, other falls, other falls. So they\nshoot in to this pyramid and like before me. Maybe I would fell too if I didn't see where I am\napproaching, you know, what I am approaching to go on. They shoot everybody was the\nwhole pyramid of people, young, old, whoever fell. So when we went back, everybody was\nalready tired, in tears, and this street looks terrible. Very bad. Possessions from people,\nhanging people from balconies what the Germans shoot them because they want to escape.\n(Sigh) We didn't know where we're going. But they took us to the shop back. So we were\nlying a whole night on the floor. Mostly were men, not many woman. And I started this girl\nwhat I was jealous on her...with her mother and father. And in my heart I felt I never see my\nmother again so I really was very jealous. And there crying the whole night and my heart\nwas breaking seeing for the first time in my life my father's crying, and he felt very\nuncomfortable like that he left my mother, like I felt this like maybe he exchanged me for her\nlife. So.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Yal. I felt like this, but he really didn't. He wasn't this person that he lived with the hope that\nhe would still be able to do something because people came back from this...from this miller.\nBut other hope was that we knewed where she is. She was not Miller 18, but Miller 22, and\nshe stood, uh...together with my uncle and with my aunt and with friends and with the sisters\nfrom Mr. Leshno and his wife and children so...and I was only my father and Leshno with\nhis son. And the same day my cousin come, my uncle's son. He went through this with my\nuncle and with my aunt and the other son, but they took them, the three of them away and he\nreceived the Kenncard so he came to the...to the shop so we heard from him some news. This\nwas...uh...the same day...he came a day later, but the same day he went to the selection. So\nwe knew they stayed together so our hope was maybe we could so something. So the night\nwas a terrible grieve...so in a terrible grieve. My heart was breaking. How my father was\ncrying, and all these men. Like I mentioned there was a lot of men, more than woman and I\nwas still considering myself a child there. And so in the morning we got breakfast. The\nbreakfast was watered like a soup but like water but off in the line standing for the line for\nthe soup, this day wasn't a working day, but like after a funeral day you know. So we got the\nsoup standing in the line and my father saw somebody so he went over and he said in the\nhope so he said to my father, \"Give me your picture...give me your wife's picture which I\nhave the picture still. He wrote it down. My mother's name and my two brothers name. He\nwent back and forth. He was the foreman from Tebins. Through him I went into work in the\nbeginning. My father paid but like a bribe, you know, and he took the picture went into the\nUmschlagplatz in the Miller and he couldn't find my mother. That was his response. The\nmoney he didn't give back, but he give back the picture, but he couldn't find. Okay? So was\nno hope that they will come. The day went on and this was already July 23. July 24 we start\nto work. You know the work has to be done. Uh...I was still by the same work with the\nKennkarte. They make me work at night time and my father worked in the day. We came to\nthe same apartment on the...it was like ___. From __ excuse me. From ____ to the ____.\nAnd this was our apartment. There what my father obtained with his friend. He went to live\nwith his daughter. I don't think he's alive at the time already, but it was too big apartment so\nwe were there...my father and myself, Leshno and his son, and my cousin and another two\npeople with two children. He worked for the Germans. He...uh...he wasn't a shoemaker. He\nwas sewing the leather of the shoes. I don't know in English this word what this... Before you\nmake the shoes...a shoe, you know, the leather has to be sewn together so then the\nshoemaker takes the shoes to make. Anyway he worked for the Germans, but he didn't have\na place where to live so he lived with us because...he moved in by himself. Apartment was\nempty so. So then we agreed that he should have a room and we lived together. And day and\nnight we went to work. We came back. We didn't have any food. We lived only what they\ngave us, but my father had a few gold pieces sewn in his shoes or on the suit and I also had\nbefore we went like the everybody had some money because we didn't go...maybe we knew\nit inside, but nobody want to say. We were sure we're going to work for the Germans, maybe\nto Germany, maybe by ____ summertime or whatever you know. So we had a few dollars. I\nmean slotas not dollars in case we have to buy something, a piece of bread or to bribe\nsomebody. The bribe was terrible in Poland at this time between the Jews also. So as a child\nI was wearing stockings but I didn't wear a belt, but elastic. So two eleastic together and in\nbetween was money sewn around. That was mine possession. So little by little we came over\nto this because we didn't have anything to live on it. And that's how we lived til 1943. The\nrumors were that the ghetto wouldn't stay too long, that they will finish us. And in between\nthey opened the Umschlagplatz. No more transportations. I mean they liquidated the ghetto\nlittle by little. The same thing and they opened the ghetto and they heard we were free from\nwork, that the ghetto was open, the miller. We run, myself, my father, everybody, the whole\nshop run there to look for relatives. We went straight to Miller 22 because we know we left\nthere my mother. We came...on the street somebody screamed, \"Uncle Mendel.\u201d My father's\nname was Mendel. This was my aunt's little boy, 8...7...8 years old. He was together with\neverybody, with my mother, with the brother in the bunker. So we asked him, \"Where is\neverybody?\" We didn't have to go further. He gave us all the report. He told us what\nhappened. Two woman in the building had a fight. I don't know all the words. And the\nGermans heard because they were snooping around with the dogs. So they came in and they\nfind the place that there is a bunker and they were hiding there and they start to scream that\nthey're going to put a tear bomb in the ducts. They should come out so they will be free to\nwork and live. Otherwise, they will be shot. So everybody went down. This little boy didn't\ngo out. He sit and he survived. My brother, the youngster, didn't go out, but my mother didn't\nwant to leave, that she should come down. She wouldn't leave without him. So the Germans\nstayed til he came down. That's the version from this little cousin of mine. And then when he\ncame down they left and took them all to the train. This was day before our New Year,\nexactly September 9, 42. So we know so much about it. But everybody said, \"Let's go.\u201d He's\na child. Maybe he doesn't know. You have to touch it to believe it. So we came to this house\nand when they saw me...a few people...\"Oh, my God, you're such a pretty child. Your mother\nshowed us pictures from you. She was crying all the day. Poor woman if she wouldn't go\nout.\u201d So we knew it already that's...that's the story what the little boy told is true. As we were\nthere the German were smart, so they start a new selection and they start to catch people\nfrom the street because they had all amount that they wanted, card or no card. So we start\nto...to hide again. But luckily, to tell you the truth I don't know how, I...we came...my father,\nmyself and the rest of us back to the shop. We didn't go back to the apartment. We were\nafraid that maybe they will take us away. We wanted to spend as much as we could in the\nshop. It wasn't safe, but better than at home. You know I worked in the night time. I...I fell\nasleep during the day. I couldn't sit in the shop. They wouldn't let me in. So I stood mostly in\nthe apartment. And this same time my father met an acquaintance and he said, \"You know, I\nam looking for you. Your son come to me from Miller 22\"...he was also from the Miller\n22...\"and he said, \"David, maybe you have a better...better bunker where I could hide with\nmy brother and my mother. I have the money. I will give you.\u201d And he told this my father.\nAnd I said, \"In my bunker is just the amount of people what we could go in, so I couldn't\ntake him.\u201d So my father was very abusive that he couldn't...that my brother was saved with\nmother. But he said, \"Please believe me. I couldn't do it.\u201d This man was a very selfish man\nand a very rich man. So my father said, \"And what you doing now.\u201d \"I have no place where\nto go.\u201d So my father said, \"It's okay. Come to my house.\u201d And he with his wife and child\ncame to live together in our house. I give even away my bed to his wife because she was a\nvery sick woman. She didn't look like Jewish at all with a little girl 3 years old. This woman\nsurvived the war thanks to me. Many days I didn't go to the shop. I was afraid and my work\nwas in the night. So I was hiding under my covers and I said, \"I don't care if I live or not.\nWhat do I have to lose. My mother is not here. My father is working. I can't talk to him. And\nI have...I am always hungry. I don't know how to cook and I have nothing to cook. So what's\nthe use of living.\u201d So he said and I was already 16 or 17 years old and this woman was very\nnice, but she had what to eat and she never shared. She never would say, \"Oh, Cywia take a\nbiscuit or something.\u201d No. Mine little cousin when we met him. He was a child. He stole\nfrom her things to eat and one day I give him an address and I said to him, \"You know, you\nhave nothing to lose. Go over the...the gates. Go to the Irish, to the Poles and go to my\nfriend. She will know who you are, and tell her that you're hungry. Maybe she will give you\na place to live. He went. He came back. He came back. He ate a good meal. He brought me a\nbread. Okay. So this family...he had a lot of money. She was hiding two little sacks under my\nmattress. She was afraid. I never looked in into the ___ believe me and I didn't care. And\none day, looking out from the window...was in the day time, I saw that the building was like\nthis that Germans are in the building. They are looking for people. So I took the cover over\nmy head. And I said, \"I don't care. If they come, they will come.\u201d So she put the little girl\nunder my cover and she sat on the side and all of a sudden boom boom boom on the door,\nbut nobody was open. It was like dumb. Pretend there is nobody there. After a few minutes it\nwas quiet and so they went away. Okay? (Sigh) Since this day, I said I am not staying here\nanymore. Because it was in my head if they take this little girl and I will see how they kill\nher...how they will kill me, I don't care. I wouldn't know it. But to see before how they kill\nher, I don't want to see 1t. So I went to work. I mean I didn't work because my work was into\nthe night. And I stood there as much as I could. So I stood there. Okay. My father find out\nthat...uh...my two cousins are alive and they work by the brocz (ph) shop in the brocz (ph)\nshop. I also forgot to mention that in the ghetto when I still had this good life in the ghetto I\nwent from day to day with mine...we were lived together with more people in the apartment.\nUh...So I met _____. Maybe you heard about him. What I went there because cousin's little\nboys to...uh...were sheltered there. My father's sister's children. And I don't know. It was a\nholiday or something and it was like a children's theater and my aunt said to me maybe you\nwould come to see. So I went. My grandfather was still alive. He died in ghetto in January\n1941...or may it was 1n 42. I think 41. And my father maked a separate burial because there\nwas...in dozens they put. But he was a very religious man and a decent man so he dug by\nhimself the...the graves. So I went and I met there a lot of people and I met him too. (Sigh)\nSo this was the life in ghetto til my father came and he was talking with people and the\nrumors were that the ghetto wouldn't be too long that Tebins and Schultz are going together.\nWe have to look to escape the ghetto. Where to escape nobody knows. But people did if they\nwere bought...uh...Polish papers that they not more Jews, but Poles. I couldn't do this\nbecause I looked very much as a Jew. I thought a German wouldn't recognize me if I am tall\nJew or a Pole. But the anti-Semitism in Poland was terrible. Ninety percent of Poles worked\nhand 1n hand with the Jews....with the Germans. So...but in the other way you didn't have\nnothing to lose. So one day this couple came to my father. They didn't have children. They\nwere from our town. They were also in ghetto. And they said, \"We have somebody. We're\ngoing to go to them. If you want, maybe you could join us.\u201d They maybe wouldn't confirm\nthis to my father, but they were looking for money in case if the people wouldn't take them\nwithout money. So maybe my father could pay for them too and this way they will go. So\nmy father said, \"In this minute I am not considering so much myself but mine baby, my\ndaughter.\u201d So he...my father came to me and he said, \"What would you say? Would you like\nto go with Lea and Abraham to the Irish side.\u201d I said, \"Not by myself. Only with you.\u201d It was\nsummer when they took away my mother. I didn't have any other clothes. I didn't have\nwinter clothes. So my father went and bought me a pair of boots and he prepared me and still\nfrom ghetto not woman, mostly men, young boys went out to the Polish side. They called\nthis the Irish side to work. They could have come in with two potatoes with a half bread,\nwhatever, you know, and that's like the other people could buy and live also. So one day my\nfather comes and says, \"They are leaving soon and I am convinced that you should go.\u201d So\nwhen Leshno heard that I am going, he wanted to send his son too. And by the time was a\nperson who lived actually in...in the wilderness there in the small town, going from\nroom...from farmer to farmer and they knew him and they give him something to survive. So\nhe went out with Leshno, with this young boy. Uh...And my father came and he said, \"Now\nis the time and you're going in 2 days and don't tell anybody where you're going.\u201d But I\ncouldn't hold a secret. I said, \"If I want to survive, I would like my cousin to survive.\u201d But\nthis time this little boy wasn't with us. We send him out. Go and look you should live.\nBecause a child, they didn't know he is Jewish. He was a blond, pretty little boy. So he\nwasn't anymore with us. And everybody was laughing with that...his face like this. I had long\nbraids, black and really looking like a Jewish girl, but my Polish was perfect. (Sigh) It's...I\nmean I had no other opportunity. My father says, \"But I wanted to...leave my secret to my\nother cousin. He was a very intelligent boy. He was older than I was, few years. And I said,\n\"Listen __, anytime you escape the ghetto, come to this and this place, I knew already this\nplace. My father told me because in 2 days I have to leave. But don't write it down. Just\nknew it. He was Warsaw born. He spoke already 5, 6 languages, very intelligent. Very\nintelligent boy. So, fine. So I had a little guilty on my chest that I let go my secret. And the\nGerman was bribed by somebody who went out for work that I would be on his\nworkmanship today. So, of course, I been 7 o'clock in the morning in the winter dressed in\nthe boots and a coat. The coat was mine, and nothing with me. . I couldn't hold nothing either\none. But I was wearing like 10 shirts and my mother's dresses here and there. That's what I\nhad with me. And I also could have had something because I am going to work so I had\nsome package and I had a___. You know, a __. I didn't know I am not supposed to have\nthis because the German were afraid that you have a bomb or ammunition inside, but I didn't\nknow it. And from this place I was instructed to come next building and there is a...like\na...also a German workshop where the Jews what they go out worked there. And they were\nworking 1n leather. So I came in. These two...this couple came in before. They weren't on the\nsame...uh...work out. This German was bribed. I don't know how much and what. But I was\nseparated from this people and I went in to this shop and I supposed to be in hiding and this\nguy knew it, the foreman that I am coming in. When the foreman saw me...his father was a\nfriend of my father. My father had a lot of connections. And he says to me, \"You going in\nthe Irish side. You fall like a fly. With a face like this, even if you polish your__. So I\nsaid, \"Benny, what do I have to lose?\" I said to him. He didn't survive. I survived. Why. I\nam asking this question always myself. And my best. I ask, \"Why, God, was I the fortunate?\"\nAnd til late afternoon we stood there. I supposed to follow this couple because I don't know\nwhere we're going in Warsaw. From there we supposed to be transport again. This was\nWarsaw. This was ___. I knew very well Warsaw, but since they separated small ghetto, a\nbig ghetto and here you could go and here you can't go so I was really was very mixed up.\nBut I followed them. I followed them and I walked. We supposed to go ____. There is the\nairport from Poland from Warsaw. I followed them. And it was snowing and you didn't see\nmany people. And I always hold a handkerchief to my nose because my nose was the main\ntrouble because a long nose don't look like Irish. All of a sudden I heard, \"Cywia, Go. Go.\u201d I\nam afraid to look back, but whose calling Cywia? I am following these two people and I am\nafraid to lose my eye on them. My father. What happened? What happened that he\nheard...somebody came to tell him that he...1f he wouldn't leave today, he could never leave\nagain. So he and Leshno bribed also to somebody by the work somebody and they took a\ntax1 on the Polish side and they went off. They knew Warsaw very well and he follows me.\nBut til he told me the story was 5, 6 hours later. But, thank God, I see him. Right? He was\ndressed up like a farmer and he looked...he was very thin and the mustache what he never\nwore it in specially for this occasion, he let it go. His Polish wasn't too good. But he came.\nAnd as we're walking, this people...this couple, I didn't see them any more. I didn't know\nwhere I'm going, but my father knows, but he went into the wrong door. He opens the door.\nIt was night. And this woman says, \"Karmaski, what you doing here?\" And my father got\npale and I stay here and, \"Who is this?\" He said, \"That's my daughter.\u201d\u2019 This was from\nTarczyn, from mine town, a woman I didn't know her because she was mostly in Warsaw\nliving in the same place. And when the German came she started work as a prostitute. And\nshe lived with the Germans. And I...we didn't know from this. Later on, we knew it. When\nshe saw us, she said, \"Well, as much as I like to help you, the Germans will be here in a half\nhour.\u201d And she start to pull out drawers and pull out big pieces like the table clothes, the\ncovers to cover the windows because we're here. My father says, \"Don't bother. How is your\nfather?\" \"Oh, he's fine. He lives in the same place. You probably will see him if you go to\nTarczyn.\u201d And \"Where you going?\" So my father says, \"I am going to Tarczyn.\u201d He was\nafraid that she's going actually next door. But we went out from her right away and my father\nbegged her not to say anything and, \"Oh, of course, not.\u201d And we went into the right door\nalready. We came into the right door, but this was nervous and heartbreaking. This couple\nwere there. My father's partner, Mr. Leshno, was there already too and they took us right\naway in the attic and then these people send out...they were poor people. The daughter which\nwas in her 20s went out and bought food for us. We didn't have nothing to eat. And, \"Fine.\nWe're supposed to be there.\u201d This was Saturday night and Sunday overnight. In the middle\nof the night, the voice says, \"Everything is ready. Who is going first?\" They supposed to\ntake us. It was 34 kilometers to Tarczyn. And we wanted not go to Tarcezyn, but to the sides\nof Tarczyn, to...through the forest to go to the village. And they don't want him to know it, so\nthey maked up that he will take us, the six of us. No. Leshno's son wasn't anymore with us.\nHe left before with this guy. We were four...five. Uh...So this lady said, \"She and her\nhusband would go separate, and I should go with my father and this Mr. Leshno.\u201d She\nlooked like an Irish woman and her husband _____ but she didn't want to go with us. So... but\nwe were supposed to go to the same place. We met there. Fine. So this guy took us, a young\nson from these people. They got paid. How much I don't know. And with the horses, with the\nWagen and we was like sitting like poor people, and they took us. And we went a few\nkilometers, somebody jumped out...it was still night, and Jews \u2014-_\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab Two Polish men.\nThey maked up with these people, you know. We were sold out. \"Give me your money. Give\nme a few jewels, what you have. Otherwise, we're going to take you to the Germans.\u201d My\nfather didn't know them. The guy didn't know them. I for sure not, but he start to shiver, this\nboy who took us...the son of this. Probably he knew what...who it 1s. Maybe the girl's\nboyfriend or whoever. We never find out. So they start from our, let's say, 5,000 slotas, but\nwho had the money? So between my father and Leshno they gave him a thousand or fifteen\nhundred slotas, which was a lot of money for us and they let us go. So I had no saying in it. I\nwas a little girl. So only my father and Leshno said, \"You can go back. We don't need you\nanymore.\u201d We were afraid more people like this will jump out and he could give us out to\nthe German. So we start to walk on the sideways (clearing throat again) til... We didn't have\nany much money, Polish money we didn't have any more. So we walked. We came to a\nsmall...uh...village and Mr. Leshno said to my father, \"We're going into Saboski.\u201d His name\nwas Saboski, a farmer, who was also dealing with my father, bought, you know, come to\nthe...to the mill, borrowed sometimes money (clearing throat). So we came in. He right away\nlike he said a prayer. Who am I seeing and he was afraid, but fine, it's Sunday night so the\nchildren are out, dancing or anyplace else, but he just put a poor man into the barn so he tell\nhim to go out. He will give him a few slotas so he will go and look for another place and\nwe'll...he will let us in just to rest in peace for a couple of hours. In the meantime my father\nsold him a piece of gold, you know, a coin and he sold...Mr. Leshno coin so he has Polish\nmoney to buy something. And we had a good meal. Milk and bread, and they were talking a\nlittle bit. But to hold us, he wasn't. He didn't need us. He was rich, a rich farmer. He didn't\nwant us. Where we going? We had a place but he 1s still the destination. So we went into the\nforest. We still had to make like 20 something kilometers and we went in the daylight. We\ndidn't want to walk because you could always see somebody so we stood mostly in the\nforest. About 5 o'clock in the morning we went into a farmer. We didn't where we're going\nin, but me and Mr. Leshno...my father couldn't go and Mr. Leshno spoke a little better this\nPolish and he knew more in this town..not town, village..people. My father didn't know so\nmany there. So we went in and there wasn't there a guy, the owner from the farm, but a\nworker. And he said, \"Out, you Jews, you go. What you doing here? You're going to shot.\nOut from here.\u201d So Mr. Leshno says to him, \"Can I speak with the owner?\" \"No, he's still\nsleeping. His wife is sleeping. Out from here. If not, the Germans are going to be here any\nminute.\u201d So we were afraid. So we start to walk again til we came like 5, 6 kilometers from\nthe place where we want to go in, but we cannot go in the daytime and we have to wait for\nthe night. So we staying in this forest and my father says, \"I know this forest very well, and I\nknow the manager from the forest and you stay here with Leshno and I go by myself.\u201d So I\ndidn't agree. I said, \"You'll never find us.\u201d Yes, he went with Leshno into this manager and\nhe was very much afraid this manager when he saw them, but his conscious didn't let him.\nYablonski was his name, and he took them in and he give them food and he wanted to see\nme and my father was very happy that he wants to go along but he didn't remember where he\nleft me. And I was sitting under a tree like this and all of a sudden a little deer comes around\nme, smells me...smells me and I said, \"My God. Is this an angel from my mother?\" I\nwas...you know, it's like a dream. And, well, he said, \"Wherever you go\"...he didn't know\nwhere we're going...\"Good luck to you. I cannot stay with you.\u201d And by the nighttime we\nwent to this place. We came to this place. This woman with the husband were there already.\nWe came to a place to a German woman. She wasn't...she was born in Poland, that\nVolksdeutsche, and she has a Polish husband and for the money, she takes us in. I actually\ndon't know exactly the money how many she got. I know they giving away a lot of\ngold...uh...but she also will have monthly money. When we receive the money from the\npartner, from the Christian partner, and a lot of lot promises from my father and him. Okay?\nSo right away, they have food and the bunker is made. We going in through the stables to a\nhole and middle is a pole. You cannot sit. You have to like this. When you lie it just like\nsardines. Uh...We been six people already. Two days later my cousin came. I was afraid to\nsay that I said to him. I didn't tell my father til he came..that I told him the place, and we took\nhim in to, so we have seven people already, like sardines. And it wasn't bad. You survive.\nAnd what'a going to be nobody knew. But we're in a good place because she was German\nyou know. But what we didn't know til the last minute when it happened that her husband\nbelonged to...what you call...organization against the German, but they were against the Jews\ntoo. What's the difference? But he wasn't okay. Then they were pressing him that he\nshould...uh...to be German to take care her nationality, and he didn't want it. So we're staying\nthere and a cousin of mine, second cousin came to stay next building. This was in the village,\nyou know, like...uh...farmer's house. She came to stay also by our farmer. They took her in\nbecause they know the family and my father and Leshno went in the night time so both the\nfarmers know from each other. So they went. Sometimes she maked a better meal so she\ngave something to eat, you know. And it was good this way. We stood there for a nice\ncouple of months til this couple said they're going to another place. They afraid to be\ntogether with us because we are too many. So they went to another place. We knew it...the\nplace. And the sent the brother of his brother came to live with us...to live in this (laughter)\nbeautiful surroundings. In the evening a lot of times this...they came that we could come\nin...in the house. So we came in. We had the water what she cooked for us with two potatoes\nand that's how we lived. It was like in this time before the holidays. And my father had a\nletter from a...from an estate. This called like a big farmer a that he owes my father\nthis and this money because my father bought from him were when he supposed...from the\nfields he brought already the...the...the corn already from him. The choice is by God all will\nbe alot or will be small, but he make a deal with him...let's say it will be a 100 ____ or maybe\n200, so I pay you for 170 or I pay you for 150. And this was the bill and my father paid in\nadvance. So these ____ from this estate had paid everything and we...this was a paper, and I\nwas carrying this paper with me to go with this German woman...he should give us some\nflour so she could make bread for herself, for us, and also because my father was religious.\nWe all been. We didn't want to eat bread for Passover. So she agreed that she will, with our\nhelp, will help make Matzahs for us. I went with her to this...uh...man til he took me in. He\nsat with me. He saw the paper. He said I should come another day. And I said, \"Frankly, I\nwouldn't like to come another day because I am taking my life in my hands like this. This 1s\nsome kilometers to go.\u201d And in this same talking I want him to kow that I didn't come along,\nthat I come with a Christian woman. I was fraid to say German woman because he could kill\nme and, you know, this way he has witnesses that somebody 1s dead, that I was told my\nfather... told me what to say. And I told him everything. He didn't give me nothing this time.\nSo we appealed to the people in Tarcezyn...to the mill people, and they give us flour. 50\npounds. And 2 nights before the Passover, I, my father. this cousin from the other guy, she\ncame in to us and he told us and we stood and she maked the oven. She had a oven in her\nhouse and we make the matzahs for Passover. We didn't have many because they liked them\nbetter than us, this German with her children and her husband, but we didn't need anything\nelse and we begged her...to my father didn't take any part in it. When she boils the potatoes,\njust right potatoes, no fat, no Schmalz, you know, because sometimes they put pork, little bit,\nand also from beets (ph) she should have make Wurst for us, so that what this. And in the\nnight time another few Jews came from other places. They know we're here. And in the\nbunker everybody was crying. We didn't have a seder, and my father make the seder. Milk\nand water was our wine. Not much, but everybody could get a drop. And this Mr. Pavlock\nwas his name, this German's husband...he was on top to see if nobody is around because it\nwas a little higher the emotions than actually it should have been. Everybody was crying and\npraying to God for a miracle, but we had a seder. And everybody went home with a piece of\nmatzah to celebrate the second night too. And from then on, my name was Ceshick (ph). Not\nCywia, but Ceshick (ph). Okay? Everybody went back home. And it was peaceful. From\nsometimes in the day, she said I should come into the house. It's quiet. I should watch the\nbaby. She's going out in the fields. One day she was still home and I was called in. She says\nto me...this German, \"I left the little dog outside, so if you know he's barking you should run\nin the oven.\u201d So I heard barking this little dog and I said...I was peeling potatoes and\nwatching the baby also. I was glad to be home, not to sit there. (Sigh) I said...all of a sudden\nshe heard voices. Right? So she ran out, and I ran in the oven. And this little dog saved my\nlife. The Germans came in and they asked about her husband, and they start to speak to her\nGerman and I heard every word...two soldiers ___. And they asked for her husband. If she\nwas very much tortured that her husband should take the nationality...the German\nnationality. Okay? So thank God, they left and I was saved. From then on I was afraid to\ncome. I was always there. One day it was really something. I had to use the bathrooms. I had\nprobably a loose stomach. I went in top and I didn't know that somebody inside from the\nbunker, the brother from this guy went upstairs already. So I went. It wasn't a toilet or\nanything. I released myself, and I want to go out...down. I see the doors are open and two\nmen came with a woman in. Uh huh. is here. A Jewish girl is here. So they spotted him to.\nSo I said...it was a hole here and I came to hide here. You understand? Not that we're hiding\nhere. And please don't kill me. Let me run away. So he said, \"Hush. Hush.\u201d So I and this guy\nstart to run. We run. We didn't want to say what, you know... But we had also learned that\nwhenever we going out to this place, you have to cover it back with straw, with all the dirt,\nwhich I did which was good. And they were looking for this man, for Pavlack. Uh...We were\nrunning, we both of us, and we came to a place, a farmer. He knewed everybody. So we said\nthat we very hungry, she should let us in. A very old woman from a fry pan she must have\nready for a dog...potatoes, you know, from who...whoever left them and she pulled red\nborscht on it and she put milk on it and water... like for a dog probably, and she brought us\nthis for us. It was in heaven. We both start to eat. I don't even remember if it was a spoon\n(laughter) and we stood there til in the night time. In the night time we went back to the place\nwhich was, Thank God, that we survived the day. A few days later the men came tn and he\nsaid during the day...1t was on a Monday...and the man said, \"I am sorry, but you must leave.\nI heard in town that I have Jews. And any day they could come. So I don't want any...you\nknow, anything to happen to you. So please leave. And when it's quiet you could come\nback.\u201d This guy was sick. He was a nice man. What was the problem? She got drunk, and\nshe said in the...1n the town there in the village...Sunday, Saturday, \"You will see how rich I\nwill get when the war is end.\u201d\u2019 Nobody knew it but when the war is end she will be a German\nbecause she will get rich...or she have Jews. They speculate. They didn't know it. So we have\nto run away. So my father says, ___. Where to go? We have nobody.\u201d So this is like 11, 12\no'clock in the bright day in winter. Go to the forest. Mr. Leshno and his son, right way they\ngo to this...they were a little relatives very distant with this couple, so they're going to this\ncouple. So my father said, \"Who cares. I am going too.\u201d We go, but we can't go together. So\nthey went separate in us. As we going through the forest...everything through the forest, and\nwe left everything here what we possessed. I had my mother's dresses which sometimes my\nfather took in the night time a dress and went out to another farm and sold the dress or\nbought a bottle of milk for it or this, but she took control of everything, this German woman.\nI also had beads, under beads. My father had this...he bought this for my mother as a\nsouvenir, a gift, and since I took mine mother's knapsack...everything...",
        "A: Knapsack. So I had this there too. So she took this too...this German woman until she\nreturned after the war to me. Not all of them, but a few and I still have them and cherish\nthem very much. So we came to this forest, me and my father, and my father was very much\nafraid that somebody finds me I should be raped. I didn't know nothing about life. It wasn't\ntime to..to tell me, you know. And all of a sudden he sees this man. He says, \"I know you.\u201d\nA christian person. You...this and this name. At the moment I don't remember, but I did\nremember his name. Maybe you could take my daughter in. She's a young girl. I will stay in\nthe forest, but take my daughter in. He said, \"Karmaska, I would take you too, but they\nworkers working by me. They making oil, black oil from ___. I don't know this word. I\nnever saw it. It's like...uh...a flower, you know, by the Poles. So I really can't take you, but I\nadvise you should stay away from here because this day the German confiscate pork, cows,\nanything what's alive and dead, they confiscate...confiscate from the farmers. So, Thank\nGod, we're together again, me and my father, because he saw that he's not a dangerous man\nso we got together again. And I said, \"Dad, maybe we'll stay in the forest til the night and we\ngo.\u201d He said, \"No, if the Germans come they could come to the forest too.\u201d So we went to\nthese people. There was a lady with two beautiful daughters, not too rich, and she was really\nholding this couple to survive. And these two people came also Leshno with her son and\nhere we are also. We weren't too happy at all. My father was very famous in the town. She\nliked to speak to him and everything but she doesn't want to hold so many people, and it's not\nhealthy also. So we stood a little bit and then was very late and she said, \"Not right away in\nthe ice\"...to this couple or maybe just this couple said...didn't say anything...we speculate\nonly. \"We will go. If God give us our life\"... mean I didn't say anything because I still was\nlooking up to my father. To me he was God. And we survived so much, and everything what\nhe said it came out the right way so what can I say? (Sigh) So we went out with this that\nwe're going back to this place..we have no...to this German woman, first to have the\npossession there. Second, we'll stay there. So...but we were hungry. So I went into a store in\nthe...by the forest. I knew the person. He built in Tarczyn in mine house...1n our house, an\noven from tiles, you know, so I asked my father, \"Shall I say who Iam?\" And he said, \"If he\nrecognize you, fine. But don't say anything?\" My father was standing on the outside. So I\nwent in and I asked, \"Could you please sell me a bread, a half kilo of bread. I'm very\nhungry.\u201d He said, \"I know who you are and would I have bread I would sell you. But it's too\nlate and I don't have it. Maybe when you come another time.\u201d Okay. So I went out and I said\nthis to my father and we had to make like another 3, 4 miles...kilometers to this place where\nwe been. So here we come in, it was like...I would say 7, 8 o'clock in the night, but it was\ndark, very dark already by the forest still, and this German woman...this where we lived\nstanding and washing already my mother's nice things. I said, \"Why're you doing this?\" And\nalso the shirts from my father and from Mr. Leshno...what ever we had. She grabbed\nevery...cleaned up the bunker and she's washing. \"Oh, when it gets dry, you will get 1t back.\u201d\nWe never get it back. We had nothing anymore, and I start to ask for shoes from my mother's\nwhat I had. I had...from...in the knapsack and for the beads. \"Oh, what do you need it. What\ndo you need it.\u201d Okay. \"Can we stay.\u201d She said, \"I prefer this place should be a little clean at\nleast for a few days.\u201d She was right. But tonight you have to stay. Otherwise ... where would\nyou go? So I went in back with my father to this bunker and we stayed there. And the same\nnight Leshno came with his son, so we back four people there. My cousin went away, and\nwe didn't see him for a couple of days and he didn't know what the changes were here. (Sigh)\nSo we stood, but they weren't happy with us, and we knew any day something will happen.\n(Sigh) So we knew from one place where it's hiding a man, a acquaintance Mr. Leshno. He\nlost the whole family, but to take out a girl, for a wife, you know, to live with her and she has\nreally the looks from a Christian with a brother. So we decide...they decide we going to\nthem. But this is so far away. Like this is in the east and this is in the west. So the night 1s\nbig. So we start to walk. And we came there, and they agreed to hold us. It was no parents\nthere. Just a young boy, maybe 18, 19 years and small children. A sister was maybe 16, little\nboy 10 but he walks like he was 25, this little boy. I just drink something. If I could or not,\nbut I can't talk. So they agreed to hold us. So this couple, this man went in another place...but\nthe same farmer boy, he went to live in an attic from the house, and we took over his bunker,\nbut for the day time he came to stay with us because with us was more people. They played\ncards. They talked. So we stayed together. (Sigh) How long...maybe 2 months, 3 months\nprobably. Anyway we heard the news from around what happened. One nice day we heard\nthat the place by these German people... the Gestapo came they couldn't live without Jews,\nso they took in a family with two children and the Gestapo killed her husband, not with a\nshot, but like with a butt, not because he holds Jews. Because he was against to take the\ncitizens as a German. They would have killed her too but she was pregnant at the time. So\nthey let her live and as they were looking...I don't know, maybe for Jews, they find the two\nJews...the family. The little boy escaped. Two little boys were...the kids escaped. The parents\nwere killed. That's... knew them. They were also from mine town. It was a sister from this\ncouple what I went out together from the ghetto, from the Warsaw ghetto. And the time we\nheard also that the liquidate the ghetto and that was the time when my cousin came and we\nhad...we saw in the morning even the men brought us in burned pieces of paper from the\nghetto when the ghetto was burning, like from seders or from Torahs. Who knows what it\nwas. Probably just books. You know. The wind brought it back, and the smell was also...\nOkay. So we were living there. (Sigh) Nothing comfort. Hungry. But the best we could do,\nwe're doing only to survive. One night...\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: Okay. We stayed with this family in Pomyonka. That's how they call this place. And there\nwas no father, just a boy, a sister and...uh...two or three more children, and we were staying\nin this bunker one beautiful night...mustly we are people on the night, not on the day, so they\nbrought us in the night. The first we could speak clearly. As we were sleeping, Poles\ncame...young boys. Matter of fact, I recognized one who borrowed my homework from\nschool, and he said, \"Give me your money. You rich people. Give me your gold. GIve me\neverything.\u201d I said, \"___, you took books from me. How was it you never wanted to make\ncopy from me, and you're going to take my books.\u201d He slapped me and he pulled my boots\noff. Okay? He took away from my father this picture, all the pictures. A night or two before I\nhad a dream from my mother and she said, \"My dear child, if you want to save your pictures,\nmaybe you could make a little...uh...bag on your neck and this way you will save the\npictures.\u201d And I mentioned this to my cousin, and she said, \"Why not? I help you, and let's\nmake it.\u201d We didn't have any material so she took off her bra and in the bra was a double\nlining so she took the lining and make for me a...a little bag, and I put in all these pictures,\nand the pictures thanks to this you have it now. And the pictures survived. My father had a\nlot of pictures from his family from his father, from his mother. He was an orphan when he\nwas 9, 10 years old, so he had...still had pictures from his mother who died when she was 29\nyears old. And they all take the pictures. Don't ask me why...what they need the pictures, but\nthey took it. But the sad story was that the Poles didn't come along. They come with a Jewish\nboy. The Jewish boy was from our town. His name was __. And we saw him. He looked like\na Pole, and maybe he saved his life by giving out us to them. Money...they...we didn't have\nmoney. If we had it, we had only in, you know, what we had hid in hiding, sewn in the\ngarment what we had. And they took us to the room, together with this people, already with\nthis couple, this man and this girl who took out from the attic, and they put us in a line and\nwhen my father...uh...saw this and they took away already his pictures, he run. He has...he\nhad only his slacks and a jacket, and he had his pyjama under and he run. And from Leshno\nfrom my father's partner, they took the boots also. In the boots was a gold piece, so he was\nbarefoot. And they took my boots so I start to ask and beg in the room, \"Please give...take\neverything, but I know you. We grow up together. I went with your sister to school. Why\nyou taking my boots? We're fighting for our life. Please.\u201d And I was crying. So one give me\na Slap in the face, and I fell to the ground. After the war, I took care of him. That's the whole\nfamily came to Lodz to me to beg to me he should be released from prison. Through Russian\nsoldiers and through a Pole I got to him. What's with him, I don't know, but the story was\ntold. Not from me but from this Pole who was a friend. He was a Senator before the war.\nAnyway we ran out. Then they left. When they left, the guy didn't want to hold us. It's no use\nto hold us. RIght? So...and it was raining. It was early morning, like 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock. So I\ncannot walk in the...in the forest because it was after the...how you call this? When they take\nfrom...up the...the... I forgotten? When the farmers take off from the...from the ... I need this\nword.",
        "A: Plowing...no they didn't take up the plowing. The harvest! You know when I get nervous I\n(laughter) I lose the... the harvest. It was the harvest...after the harvest, so you know the\nstraw what they took off it went...it goes in your legs. I couldn't walk. But still they had the\nstraw staying to get dry so me and my cousin went into...to like on the straw like you saw in\na picture.",
        "A: The haystack. So we went in but we couldn't get in to..and here we have a whole day to get\nthrough with this. And my cousin also went into one, but he was by himself and he start to\ntalk to us, what we doing next and where are we going? It start to rain and it was windy, and\nall of a sudden one minute it fall apart, the straw and we staying like this. No people\nsurrounding. Nobody was there. So we decide we had nothing to lose. We start to walk.\nWhere are we going? We're going to a forest. But we had this maked up with my father.\nOnly thing what happened we meet but this Senator, ___\u2014_. He was a friend of ours. My\nfather had hidden this stuff what he always sold for us...a dress, a garment, something...a\npiece of furniture, we should be able to live. So by him is the best part to live. His brother\nwas the one who brought into the Warsaw ghetto sometimes money and she was the one\nfrom the mill what she got the pension and brought for us also. Very confident people. He\nwas the one who brought to trial this guy who took my boots. Okay. So we supposed to meet\nby him, which in the night time we met there. We came to him. He said, \"You go out here\nand here. You'll find your father.\u201d So my father had already boots. Through the day,\nLesh...my father had the boots, but Leshno had boots and had something to eat, so my father\nsaid, \"We have no place, but let's go and look for somebody also from the town. He\nmentioned once that he could have a place for us.\u201d This was already the night. So we went\nand we...we got this man. It was like oasis, with little trees, like a forest, and all of us went in\nthere and my father said, \"We will probably go to this place.\u201d But he went, this guy went. He\nsaid he's a relative...I don't know exactly to my father....to this and this guy ___ to ask him\nif he wants to make money so we could be by him. So during the day we went in this oasis.\nWe had nothing to eat, just what we'd brought up, but at least we were been all together.\nLeshno's son ran away so he went to another place, to another village where also there were\nJews, and I and my cousin and my father and Leshno and the cousin...the lady was 1n this\noasis and this guy went to ask this guy. He came back with good news, that they want to take\nus, and set the amount of money and the gained the promises after...after...after. We went\ninto this place. There was two very old people, and...uh...a bachelor's son and a younger son\nand a widower, a son-in-law. But the son-in-law was better than all of them. His wife died\nand he remained in the village, and he was working for the German by...uh...milk, but\nthe...the farmers brought him milk there and he make ____...uh...uh...sour cream and he\nshoveled this to the German. So a few dollars, for a few slotas he sometimes brought us a\nbottle of milk which it wasn't already milk, but was sour, but it was good for us. Okay. So we\nwere living on this and we were very comfortable. At night time they let us in inside and we\nhad not a meal, but fine. So we took our cousin also, the very intelligent boy and there he got\nvery sick, my cousin. And he was afraid to go to the doctor, and he start...because he knew\nso much, he start to cure himself, and he died there. And now like __ will have his\nand after the war we want to take his body out but the town didn't allowed us. My father did\na very much, a lot a lot, but we were afraid to start it, so he remains still his bones there, in\nhis field. We stood there and this old lady went occasionally to town and she brought bread\nand she baked bread. And we give them...my father give them money, and they live a\nlittle...a life a little more comfortable because they were very, very poor. And we had a nice\nplace by them. And also the same pattern...to go in, I have pictures here how we went into\nthis bunker, how many people we were there and nobody knew it. And this guy also stood\nwith us. We even like paid for him too. And one beautiful day...uh...they came to the town,\nand they said that the German come to the town and they going to occupy you, you, you...I\nmean the farmers' places, and we had to go. We had to leave. We had to leave. This was\nwinter, and it was very, very cold. A storm in Poland and we are not dressed. I don't still\nhave boots. I don't have nothing what to wear. (Sigh) So what do I have to lose. I went to\ntown. And I knocked on the door for my neighbor. Her husband worked us...worked in our\nmill and I said... she has no children. He used to like me very much because he said I said I\nwas used to sing. When I went to school late____\u2014\u2014\u2014s and I said, \"I don't have boots.\u201d I put\ndown the latest hiding and they like 2, 3 sizes smaller and I came and please...here...when\nyou get the money from ___ from the mill, please buy me a pair of boots and a coat.\u201d So she\nwent down, and she bought me shoes, and she bought me...high shoes, not boots, but high\nshoes, and she bought me a coat, and she gave me a good meal to eat, and I maked up with\nthe woman what she took me to town and she went shopping to me and I survived. I came\nto...to the hiding place back with a few dollars, with bread. That's how I got the shoes for me.\nAnd we were there. Okay. And she always borrowed my shoes...the lady, the old lady. It was\nthree sizes big. One day she said she wouldn't give me back but I didn't need it, I don't walk\nanymore. But when I...when we suppose to leave, she didn't give me my shoes. She give me\nher shoes. And they still were too small. Where do we go? We have no place where to go. So\nwe know from this place where the Jews are, by this old lady. We go to her. So we came\nthere. And the Jews they were hiding there, didn't let us in. They said they want to live. Too\nmany Jews cannot be here. It's very dangerous. But me and my cousin are young girls, they\nwould take in. My father and Leshno they don't want to take in. Okay. But the woman\nwanted to take in my father. She didn't care. This is the picture what I showed you and which\nI brought. So I said, \"If not my father, I don't want to go either.\u201d So I, my father, Leshno, my\ncousin, and Leshno's son went back to this place, to the oasis, to the forest, in the middle.\nThis was a Sunday. And we sitting, lying like this, not sitting, but from the __ from the\nforest. All of a sudden we hear from the town...from the village, boys are playing cards _,\nyou know, and we are like mouses. Quiet. All of a sudden, bang, bang, bang. We heard a\nshooting. I saw the Germans. I saw the police, the Polish police. I picked my head up and the\nworse part what it was, they had white cheese, like farmer cheese, apiece and a boy who I\nknow it, had a whole farmer cheese. He was so happy. He went out. He was killed. So I said\nbecause we have farmer cheese, we're going to be killed. So my father said, \"Don't pick up\nyour head. Just lay down.\u201d So I was lying after him. I don't know what make me do, but I\npicked up my head and I saw the bayonet...the... the...the...from the German and from the\nPolish...uh... policeman. They were looking...and for the...I can't remember exactly how the\nPolish organization . They were looking for this organization because they\nwere an organization also against the German, but also against the Jews. Okay. So this\nshooting what we heard...we been 7, 8 people. The players were also ___. They were shot\nfrom this Polish police and from the German. We survived thanks to them because they shot\nthem they head them off of us. But we saw them. My father, I mean, the rest of the people,\neverybody saw them. They didn't see us, but we could see them. Not the faces exactly, but\nthey have bodies. Okay. So in the night time we said, \"We can't stay here. We cannot stay\nhere. We have to run again.\u201d So a delegation went to this woman that she took...has to take\nus in. So she took us in. Okay? When she took us in, this Jewish people what they were\nhiding there, went away from her because the whole town know that she has Jews. They\nwere so hungry that they was eating leaves from...from like ___, you know, spinach, from\nthe...from the farm. They didn't have nothing to eat. And they give us some money, some\npromises. We lived on promises, which we...we...thank God we remained. The world was\ngood. They all had paid for it. And this woman took us out...took us in. Was very, very cold\nalready, and was a storm, and it was near like to the liberation already. So in the night time in\nthe storm, we didn't had meat and my father and...uh...Leshno went, but we have to go in for\nthe towns they maked holes so we had to go like two..two flopped down and then to come\nout. Otherwise, there was no way to get through to this...uh..village. So we went in. Fine. But\nwe couldn't get up. So my father with a cane...he was thin and very, you know, so he went up\nand then he start to slip me up. So I lost this bread what I had with me. I just had in my\npocket...from the coat pocket...uh...I think I had...uh... something...I don't know what I had. It\ndoesn't matter. I had something, a biscuit maybe. And...uh...he started to take Leshno up. He\nwasn't heavy, but he was 6 foot, maybe more even. Very hardly, he was begging, \"I want to\ndie here. Please, you go. You live. Go. Go. Go.\u201d My father says, \"No. You take it. You fell\none time. You fell two times because there's the water, and there's the snow inside. We came\nup. But now how do you go? If you go into snow, you make a lot of steps so the steps will\nlead to her. Right? So we went. Anyway we came there, and there we staying. Staying there\nwas a hard life there too. Til these the other Jews left. They had a hard time with them. Why?\nBecause it was too many of us in one place. She couldn't cook. She didn't had where to eat.\nShe had a pot with a hole because it was dripping out if she put water in. They were very\npoor. Primitive. Very primitive. (Sigh) So one beautiful day, we heard screaming. The\npolice there. \"Hey, Lady, where do you have the Jews?\" She said, \"What Jews?\" So one\npoliceman...I knew him..I had...I recognized the voice. He was __ by father plenty in the\ngood days. Malechewski (ph) was his name. With his son I went to school too. Was a small\ntown. Everybody want know each other. Tarcyzn was very small. So he slapped the girl. She\nwas 10 years old. \"You. Tell me where the Jews are.\u201d She said, \"We don't have Jews.\u201d So the\nlittle boy who was 8 years old heard that she denies, so he denied too. They took away our\nstuff, a few pieces of silver, you know, what this woman had taken from us. My father or\nLeshno give it to her, but this shouldn't be in first place this place because she hasn't got a pot\nor nothing to eat, and here she has silver cup what you make Kiddush on it you know. And\nwe had them to sell...to get some money or bread for it. Okay. When they left, these Jews left\nus too and we're by her hiding and hiding. Then her daughter came. A married daughter. Her\nhusband was a terrible anti-Semite. And they discovered us. Money. Good words. We\ntalked. We had nothing to lose. Where do you go? And we know it's soon it's going to be\nover because the American planes were on our heads. We saw it already in the night time\nwhen we went out from bunker we could see. We prayed for this moment. Right? So we\nstood there. No other returning. And one night people came. We were in bunker. By her it\nwas more in home because it was a cellar, and they were talking Russian and this was the\npartisans and they took the older boy away, and this week was a terrific day because the boy\ncame from church. They were very religious people, the Christian people. So he went to\nchurch and the Priest gave a sermon that he should help people but many times he came\nhome and he said, \"Hey, Maw. Maybe we should throw out these Jews?\" The priests said\nthat we shouldn't hold Jews or partisans because they will kills us. We had already news that\nthey took two Jewish girls for five pounds of sugar to the Germans and they escaped. And\nthis was my father's cousins. I include the pictures here...them. They survived the war. They\nare not living anymore. They lived in Israel. They left a nice family, but they don't live there\nanymore. Natural death. And so we were afraid. Right? So the church didn't work for the\nJews. That's for real. The anti-Semitism was terrible. If a neighbor knocked the door, they\nknew that this neighbor has Jews you couldn't stay another day. Even by the people what\nthey took from you the money and they very nice and they wait we should be liberate so they\nwill get rich, even they were anti-Semite. Why I don't know. I would never know. I am not a\nprejudice person. By me everybody's good and all the flowers are the same. One is yellow,\none 1s white and red. So am I. One...a person's a humanbeing and that's it. But the church had\na lot to do with anti-Semitism. So this boy came home and he wasn't in a good mood, and in\nthe night time during the night, this partisans came and they lie down on the floor under the\nopening from the...how we are afraid, and they talking Russians. I don't understand\ntheir...now I understand Russian. But my father understood. So he bent over like this to me\nand hold my arms like this I shouldn't cough. I shouldn't do anything. Thank God. We were\nhealthy in there. And everybody quiet til it got light, so he took him with his horse to some\ndestination. I don't know where. Three days later he came running...the same boy. Jew. Jude.\nGet out. Your're free. So we were like...we didn't want to go out. We were like paralyzed.\nAnd this same day we got flour for this woman and she baked bread. Each bread was like a\ntable round. So my father...he didn't see anything, but he touched the big bread and he's\nrunning. And here the front is going. And this was the...the...great..., you know,the\nholes...where for the tanks. And the stopped the whole army, the Russian army, and he\nscreams in Russian...he's Jewish and he's liberated and he is kissing this cop, this Russian,\nand the whole army stopped. And he's explaining and he catched this __ boy Ganick. His\nname is Ganick Vitishinski. I have pictures include from his mother. This is my man. By him\nwe survived and I am going to do everything from him, and we are free. And he's telling\nhim, so the captain says...major captain...uh...he's telling that his wife and his sons got killed\nfrom Germans, so he said, \"So's the whole world. Everybody's killed a little. I mean he\nmeant Jews because he came from Russia through with the front, and he know what is going\non. Okay? So and we were afraid that maybe it's not so. Maybe this will be German. But we\nsaw the German running...German soldiers running, and got killed also from...from this\nsoldiers...from the Russian. And they took the bread and my father came back to..to us, and\nthis night we didn't sit anymore in bunker. But from another town, ___, there was also a\nvery rich persons with an estate. He also...Leskinski __ 1n Polish is the name. He came...he\nheard this Kamalski, my father and Leshno is here so he came to visit. And they sat and\nkissed, but a few days before when my father sent this lady to say that Kamalski is around\nand occasion I see him, give him something to eat or give him a few dollars, Polish slotas,\nthat's not.... They were afraid already for communism you know. So he sat a whole night and\nspeak to them and in the morning we are liberated. So everybody from us, myself, my father\nand my cousin, Leshno we went to town. By this time my cousin, which was my father's\nsecond wife, remained in the place by this people what we had to go away because the\nGermans really came to them. They occupied all the stables. But she looked a little\nlike...uh...a Polish girl so she stood behind and she didn't want...she didn't care already for\nlife. You know, she was very depressed also. She was older than me naturally. So...uh...we\nmet her too as we went...continue. I didn't know. I didn't know much that my father and her\nwas a little romance. And Leshno also would like to marry her. It was like a competition a\nlittle. But...uh...I think my...she married my father for mostly the promise was to my father.\nShe was never married, and she was a true family...she was a far cousin to me. Okay. So\nwhen we were liberated, my father married her. And they had a very happy life, and I loved\nher very much. And she gave me a brother and a sister which I adore and I love them. My\nbrother was born in Poland and my sister was born Israel and very tight family. She died\nwhen she was 46 years old. Naturally, she had a heart failure...failure so she died. Okay?\nAnd my father died in '77. He was 77 years old. He lived in Israel and when she died he...he\nlike he died too. But we insist that he should pick up his life. He has small children. My\nbrother was 14 years old. My sister was 6...excuse me...12 years old. She was born when my\nbrother was 6 years old. And with letters...uh...1 begged him he should remarry and he did\nremarry and he wasn't happy. And I think from unhappiness he died. Okay?",
        "A: Okay. We left Paris. And we. Shall we continue?",
        "A: I would like to add that I went to Paris...1n Lodz.",
        "A: I want to say I was liberated...we were liberated. I want to add that we were liberated. I was\nin the middle.",
        "A: I was liberated. Excuse me. I was liberated in January...in January 16, 1945. We went to\nTarczyn. I went back to mine house. It was very hard for us. We couldn't stay in Tarczyn\nbecause in the middle of the night, as much as the Poles loved us, they throw stones on us\nand they said the Jews should be killed and not stay with them anymore. So we went to live\nin Lodz. And we lived in Lodz til I met my husband and we went to Paris in 1947. I lived in\nParis 6 years, happy years, and then when the war start with...uh...Viet Nam...uh...we wanted\nto go to America because I didn't want to live another war. So we went to America and we\nmaked our life. I have two daughters, Francis and Linda. They're both married, both have\ntwo children. Francis has a boy and a girl, and Linda has two girls, and they're very good\nchildren and they remember they belong to the second generation. They know what their\nparents lived through. That's mine life. I dreamed a lot about it, and many nights I would like\nto dream or to wake up to see it, but I survived. Thank God.",
