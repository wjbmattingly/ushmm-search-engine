        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nHedi Pope, conducted by Gail Schwartz on November 6\", 1997 in Alexandria,\nVirginia. This interview is part of the museum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust\nsurvivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. This is tape\nnumber one, side A. What is your full name?",
        "Answer: My full name is Hedi Pope. It at one time was Hedwig, but that was such\na mouthful to put on your naturalization papers, so I permanently changed it to just\nHedi Pope. I do not use a middle name.",
        "Q: And what is your family name, your maiden name?",
        "A: My maiden name was Politzer. That\u2019s like the Pulitzer prize, but with an O.\nAnd it was always Hedi Politzer. As I say, the Hedwig was not something that I\nespecially cherished, even as a child.",
        "Q: And where were you born and when were you born?",
        "A: Iwas born March 18\", 1920 in Vienna, the capital of Austria. I have an older\nsister, there are just the two of us. My parents were both born in Vienna, and they\nwere both born in 1887. So we\u2019re really going back to the Victorian age, the Gay\n90s, whatever you want to call it, and my upbringing, I think, was accordingly.",
        "Q: What is your sister\u2019s name, and when was she born?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: My sister Ava \u2014 Eva \u2014 Ava, I guess, Ava Politzer, she is not married. She was\nborn in Vienna also in June 1915.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your parents, how \u2014 and also how far back the family\ngoes in Vienna.",
        "A: Okay. Both my parents came from rather prosperous, middle class, I guess you\nwould call it. Both grandfathers were prominent businessmen in Austria.\nGrandfather Ludwig Politzer was born somewhere in the far reaches of the\nHapsburg empire in what is now Hungary, I guess, and came to Vienna as a very\nyoung man, to learn the language and to absorb a little culture. That was the thing to\ndo for young people with any kind of ambition, to come to the capital at the time. It\nwas, of course, the cultural center, right after Paris and Rome and London. He had\na very interesting gold and silver \u2014 he was a gold and silversmith in a ta \u2014 1n a stre \u2014\non a street that was called Papagenogasse, which is rather \u2014 rather very Viennese,\nyou know, Papa Geno is one of the characters in \u201cThe Magic Flute.\u201d And a very\ninteresting thing about Grandpa Politzer, we never really knew what kind of an\nartist he was, and in \u2014 in eight \u2014 in 1981, when the Metropolitan Museum had a\nbeautiful exp \u2014 exhibit of Hapsburg treasures and \u2014 and costumes, we suddenly\nstood in front of a big, big [indecipherable] I call it, exhibit of jewelry that\nHungarian noblemen wore, and it was made by Ludwig Politzer in circa \u2014 it said\nNovember 6, 1997\ncirca 1872. So my sister and I just \u2014 just \u2014 just couldn\u2019t believe it. I mean, this was\njust an unbelievable thing. We traced it down and it is now the property of the\nImperial Museum in Budapest. And to try to get hold of somebody who knew\nsomething about it was \u2014 this was 1981, I said, was impossible. So I\u2019m still trying to\nfigure out how I could see it one more time. But this was a \u2014 a beautiful thing. Also,\nhe has a \u2014 a very interesting piece exhibited in one of the museums in Vienna. So\nunbeknownst to us when we lived in Vienna, he was apparently quite \u2014 quite an\nartist. The business was later on carried on after his death by one of the brothers of\nmy father\u2019s, but I don\u2019t really know what happened. It doesn\u2019t exist any more. The\nother grandfather also came from somewhere in Hungary, as a very young man,\nabout 15 years old, to learn something besides Hungarian. And he turned out to be a\nvery well-known businessman. He had the most \u2014 best known haberdashery, I guess\nyou would call it, on what would be the Fifth Avenue of Vienna, called Karntner\nStrasse. And once or twice a year he went to London and Paris for buying\nmaterials and \u2014 and \u2014 and for made-to-order suits for men and women. It was called\nthe English fleet, the Englisch-Flotte, it was very well known, and it was, until\nabout 10 years ago, carried on by a much younger child of hi \u2014 much younger than\nmy mother\u2019s child, but that\u2019s a long family story that I don\u2019t think I have time to\nrelate. Well, anyway, they were both very prosperous. My father\u2019s family had \u2014\nNovember 6, 1997\nthere were two sisters and five brothers, seven. And my father, Oscar Politzer was\nthe youngest. My mother\u2019s family, there were two older sisters and one younger\nbrother. My mother\u2019s name was Marie, but she was all \u2014 always Mitzi, little Mitzi\nbecause she was tiny and very, very delicate. And all she really knew how to do was\nplay the piano. That was the thing to do. And both households had a cook and a\nmaid, and in my mother\u2019s family there was a mademoiselle that came several\nafternoons a week because you had to learn another language, absolutely. And my\nfather\u2019s family with the five boys especially, there was a sort of a tutor, another \u2014\nanother teacher who saw that homework was being done by these \u2014 by this big\nfamily. I \u2014 I think this 1s important to \u2014 to realize how very much entrenched this \u2014\nboth families were in Vienna. They were socially and financially very, very much\nViennese.",
        "Q: And what kind of work did your father do?",
        "A: My father was, I guess you\u2019d call it a businessman. He was supposed to \u2014 to,\nwith his brother-in-law, my mother\u2019s brother, take over the business from my\nmaternal grandfather, but things happened. Grandpa Berger was his name, was\nwidowed er \u2014 er \u2014 ma \u2014 at age 60, and remarried a much, much younger woman, to\nthe great distress of the children. And they had another child, and that other child, of\ncourse, was inheriting the business, instead of the son and son-in-law and that was\nNovember 6, 1997\nthat. So my father had \u2014 it\u2019s hard to \u2014 to translate it. He \u2014 he represented foreign\nfirms. He was a businessman, and business was not good. We\u2019re talking \u2014 my\nparents were married in 1914, beginning of the war. And the time between the wars\nwas economically very bad in Europe. So we had everything a child would need.\nAnd besides, you didn\u2019t talk business with your children. I was really not aware of\nwhat my father did. I wouldn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t care, but you just didn\u2019t discuss it with\nyour children.",
        "Q: Did your mother work?",
        "A: No, Mother did not work, and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s interesting, because she was a very, very\ntalented and very smart woman, but girls of this age in that level of society just\ndidn\u2019t work. There was \u2014 she played the piano very well, and I guess she knew how\nto cook, because she had to learn it. But then we always had a maid or somebody\nelse who cooked, so Mother didn\u2019t \u2014 I mean, she brought up my sister and me, but\nthat was about it.",
        "Q: How religious was your family?",
        "A: Not at all. Not at all.",
        "Q: Did you celebrate any religious holidays?",
        "A: Not at all. We had a Christmas tree, and the 24\" of December was sort of a\nfamily reunion. We had a Christmas tree with real candles. And there were always\nNovember 6, 1997\ntwo big pitchers of water standing nearby, because we always had one or two mine\n\u2014 little minor fir-fires. But that \u2014 that was it.",
        "Q: Was Christmas a religious holiday for you, or \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014acivil hol \u2014 a civil holiday?",
        "A: It was strictly a civil holiday. We didn\u2019t go to church or midnis \u2014 mass, or\nanything like that.",
        "Q: Did you ever go to any synagogue services?",
        "A: Very rarely. I remember one wedding of a cousin, much older cousin, that I\nattended, but that was about it. Which seems strange, but that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "Q: Well now, let\u2019s talk about you. Let\u2019s talk about your childhood, and also your\nneighborhood where your family lived. Was it a mixed neighborhood of Jews and\nnon-Jews when you were growing up?",
        "A: You\u2019re asking me a question I really don\u2019t know how to answer, because I don\u2019t\nknow. Even though you hear a lot and read a lot about rising anti-Semitism, I was\nnot aware of it. I had friends \u2014 I had Jewish friends and I had, of course, the state\nreligion, so to speak, in Austria was Catholic. So most people were Catholics, but\nthere were some Protestants. And you just didn\u2019t pay too much attention to where\npeople went on Sundays, or if they went at all.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "Q: What kind of school did you go to as a young child?",
        "A: I went to four years of elementary school, and then \u2014",
        "Q: Was this a public school?",
        "A: Public school, yes, definitely public school, very close by to my house. I walked\n\u2014I could walk by myself. And after four years of elementary school, you had to\ndecide whether you wanted to go to an eight year gymnasium, which was high\nschool, or just four years of \u2014 which was called Hauptschule. Most of the time, if\nyou just didn\u2019t make very good grades, and couldn\u2019t really do very well, you went\nto Hauptschule. Or if there was no money at all \u2014 cause you did pay a little bit for\ngymnasium. And children went to Hauptschule if they wanted to follow a trade.\nIt\u2019s th-the sy \u2014 the school system 1s very ve \u2014 was very different and still is very\ndifferent from he \u2014 here in the U.S. I went to a eight year gymnasium, which was\nvery strict, very difficult and very, very cut and dry academic, I would say. And I\u2019m\n\u2014 I\u2019m glad I had the good education I had.",
        "Q: While you were going to school, I assume you had no religious training at \u2014 at\nthat time. Did you have any hobbies or other interests, besides school?",
        "A: From age five on, I danced. I was gonna be a dancer, and I was gonna have a\ndance studio, somewhere. And that was that, and the opportunities, of course, in\nVienna were tremendous. Our household was very much infused with music. We\nNovember 6, 1997\nhad a beautiful Bosendorfer. That\u2019s one of the big, big, beautiful pianos we had.\nMother played quite a bit. My sister had piano lessons, seemed forever. And Mother\ntried piano lessons for me, but I just couldn\u2019t sit still long enough. So I \u2014 I had \u2014\nMother was my teacher for about three years and then we both gave up, and I\u2019m\ntruly sorry I did, but I gave up. So I \u2014 I danced two, three afternoons a week. You\nknow, school was from about \u2014 well, em \u2014 elementary school it was from eight to\n12. Then in gymnasium you went to school every day from eight to one, and it c \u2014\nalso on Saturdays, so the \u2014 the dance classes came in the afternoon. And very early\nin life, I did a lot of performing. That was really what I \u2014 what I loved. One of my\nteachers was a-\u2014 one of the soloists at the Staatsoper, and she had a studio on the\nside, and was also often asked to choreograph for the Burgtheater, which was the\ndramatic stage \u2014 this dramatic, state supported stage. And there I had all sorts of\nopportunities. I got paid something, which amounts to nowadays probably for about\n10 cents. But at the time it was \u2014 it was great to have a little \u2014 little money to save,\nand I usually saved it up to go on a skiing trip, because that was the other \u2014 I would\nn\u2014 wouldn\u2019t know whether it was a hobby, but everybody skied, and we also\nskated. I\u2014 we had membership to one of the ice skating rinks. And then every year,\nthat was later on in gymnasium, the whole school, or those who couldn\u2019t ski well,\nthey had to stay home, went somewhere for a week, into one of the youth hostels in\nNovember 6, 1997\nthe Alps, and just looking back on it, this was probably the most beautiful, best\ntimes we ever had.",
        "Q: What language did you speak with your parents at home?",
        "A: Well, we spoke German, and although people from Berlin don\u2019t always want to\nadmit that Austrians speak German, it is Volksdeutsche. So that was the language\nwe \u2014 I had seven years of French in ha \u2014 in high school, in gymnasium, four years\nof Latin and about two or three years of English. So we \u2014 tha-that was very much \u2014\neverybody had to take languages. And French was really usually the first foreign\nlanguage. Now it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s English, but in those days it was always French was the\nfirst foreign language.",
        "Q: Were your parents, or maybe specifically your father, very politically oriented,\npolitically involved?",
        "A: No, not at all. At least that\u2019s the way it seemed to me. I have no way of \u2014 of\nknowing, but no, my answer would be no. I \u2014 my \u2014 my mother\u2019s brother George, he\nwas two or three years younger than my mother, was terribly proud of his World\nWar I record. He was in the cavalry, and it was hard to get into the cavalry. I don\u2019t\nknow whether you had to pay somebody to get in, or it was the uniform, that\nbeautiful red pants, red trousers and blue jacket that was expensive, but he was very\nproud to have been in the cavalry. And was wounded in World War I, he had a very\nNovember 6, 1997\nbadly crippled hand from \u2014 from a wound in World War I. And later on, after the\nwar was over, he joined a party called the Ligity-misten(ph). They were \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow whether it was a political party or just like an association, people who wanted\nto have the Habsburg \u2014 the Habsburgs back. And later on, when the Nazis\nmarched in, that was \u2014 was very bad. I\u2019ll come to that later.",
        "Q: Was your father Zionistic at all?",
        "A: Not at all, not at all. Religion had \u2014 had absolutely nothing \u2014 no \u2014 no impact on\nme.",
        "Q: Did you feel Jewish?",
        "A: No, I never did. And I \u2014",
        "Q: Did you know that you were born Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, yes, that I knew, but it was just something that was just sort of glossed over,\nI guess you would call it. It\u2019s hard to believe, but that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "Q: What kind of relationship did you have with your parents? Was it the kind that\nyou could talk things over with, did you have especially close relationship?",
        "A: Well, I think the relationship was close, yes, but close for these years, for \u2014 for\nthe \u2014 for the years in the \u2014 in the 20s. Probably not for now. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very close\nwith my daughter now, much closer than I ever was with my mother.",
        "Q: What about your relationship when you were a child, with your sister?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we fought, like all sisters do, but basically it was a friendship and\nwe're still very good friends.",
        "Q: Now let\u2019s move to 1933. You are 13 years old, and Hitler has come into power\nin Germany. Do you recall \u2014 okay, obviously you were quite young \u2014 any changes\nthat you were aware of when he f\u2014 from 19 \u2014 in the early \u2014 you know, 1933, in the\nbeginning?",
        "A: Well, I want to go back few \u2014 few years before that. We talked about the\nSoltsis(ph) and the Nazis. The Soltsis(ph) were the social democrats, and the Nazis\nwere \u2014 you know, the word Nazi comes from Nationalsozialistische Deutsche\nArbeiterpartei. So there was this talk, and of course children pick up things. So\nneither one was particularly good, but the social democrats were the leading party\nafter World War I. And I remember vaguely there was a kind of a \u2014 almost a little\nrevolution. I think it was about \u201927 - 1927. Maybe I\u2019m thinking of 1931, I\u2019m not\nsure. There was a big new building development where a lot of people could get\nvery low rent apartments, and they tried to have a little revolution against the\nsomewhat authoritarian Christian democrat \u2014",
        "Q: [sneezes] Excuse me.",
        "A: \u2014 government at the time. So I\u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I was aware that there was something \u2014\nsomething going on. This was in \u201931. 1933, yes, we heard about Hitler, but that was\nNovember 6, 1997\nnext door. That was \u2014 that was far away. It\u2019s hard to believe this nowadays, but you\nknow, we didn\u2019t have television. We had just gotten a radio, and communications\njust weren\u2019t \u2014 and besides, I was 13 years old, I had too many other things I \u2014 I\nwanted to think about and do. So we \u2014 yes, we knew about Hitler, but that was\nabout it. Then things became more serious. In 1934, and I remember that very well,\nthat the Chancellor Dollfuss \u2014 I don\u2019t think one even knows the name here, was\nmurdered. He was the \u2014 the Austrian chancellor. And it was very obvious that the\nNazis from \u2014 the German Nazis were behind that terrible murder. It was in July, and\nI was on vacation at one of my aunt\u2019s villas on the lake. And we were very, very\nworried about what was really happening there. But then that calmed down.\nDollfuss successor was Kurt von Schuschnigg, and he was a very, very different\nkind of chancellor. I remember Chancellor Dollfuss, he was a very short man, he\nwas just five foot tall, and he was the butt of a lot of jokes. But he was a very\npopular man, he had a great deal of rapport with the \u2014 with the people. And the \u2014\nthis new man, von Schuschnigg was a kind of a college professor type. Very\nserious, seemingly not a whole lot of sense of humor, and he was also at the time,\nthe head of the Heimwehr. Heimwehr was sort of a militia type party, 1t was a\ndifferent party. It was somewhere between the Nazis and the Soltsis(ph). And a lot\nof the Heimwehr \u2014 Heimwehr people were aristocrats that at one time of course\nNovember 6, 1997\nwere for the return of the Habsburgs. So he definitely lacked popular appeal. And I\nthink he \u2014 he had absolutely no way of communicating with Hitler, he wasn\u2019t even\ntrying. And he was the wrong type to ever meet up with Hitler. This is \u2014 this was\n1934. The \u2014 1936, of course, was the year of the Olympics, which the museum so\nvery, very beautifully, I thought that was a marvelous decision, whoever made it, to\nhave that year show other Olympics, because I remember that very well. I was very\nmuch into athletics and of course we realized that Hitler used this as a tremendous\npropaganda tool, the \u2014 the Olympic games. And we were so, so taken by this\nbeautiful black man Jesse Owens. He was \u2014 but it was \u2014 it was very, very \u2014 there\nwere several Austrian competitors, one or two of them were Jewish, who were not\nallowed to participate the last moment. So it was a very, very strained. It started \u2014 it\nstarted to be very, very strained.",
        "Q: When Hitler came to power in 1933, and as the year started to go on, did you\nyourself think more about being Jewish, or did that not enter your mind? I\u2019m\ntalking, you know, even up through the \u201936 Olympics.",
        "A: No, this \u2014 this didn\u2019t really \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 I \u2014 it\u2019s funny that I have no \u2014 no\nfeeling, no \u2014 no memories that I said oh dear, you know, what\u2019s gonna happen? Just\nnot at all. This really didn\u2019t happen until after 1938. I had in s \u2014 in school, of course\nthere was a \u2014 we knew that there was an underground. The underground Nazi\nNovember 6, 1997\nmovement started when Schuschnigg came in because he \u2014 he did a lot of \u2014 lot of\nreally very, very awkward things. He tried to outlaw the National Socialist party in\nAustria, and that was the wrong thing to do. They went underground there. So right\n\u2014 right on my right side, we \u2014 we sat in \u2014 in \u2014 1n school, in sort of desks that were\nthree or four. The girl on my right side, I knew wore a little swastika on her lapel,\non the underside of her lapel. The girl on my left, her father was in the military, and\nhe was to be the Austrian attach\u00e9 in Berlin. So you know, I had a little bit of a\npolitical fallout there on \u2014 on either side of \u2014 but we were \u2014 we were friends. I think\nthe girl who wore the swastika on the \u2014 on the side of the lapel knew that I knew\nshe wore it. But that was alright, you know, it \u2014 and we also knew that there were\ncertain \u2014 certain professors, certain teachers who we knew were \u2014 were Nazis, but\nthey \u2014 they didn\u2019t make any \u2014 any difference, they didn\u2019t treat us any different. It\nwas \u2014 it was interesting. When I think back of it, there was very little of this polit \u2014\nit didn\u2019t come down to the youngsters, let\u2019s say, ti \u2014 our age group.",
        "Q: So you yourself never, up until 1938, you yourself never experienced any\ndifficulty, any anti-Semitic overtones?",
        "A: Not at all. Not at all that I \u2014 that I can remember. Maybe there was, there\nprobably was, underground. But a teenager just didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. I\n\u2014I went to a very nice dance school. That\u2019s \u2014 when I say that, it\u2019s the social\nNovember 6, 1997\ndancing, the same \u2014 same school that my mother went to, and he\u2019s still there, the\nschool is still there, only not th \u2014 the man is long dead, but there you know, you\nwould have \u2014 would have said you \u2014 you \u2014 perhaps there were any \u2014 any differences\nwho could come into this class or that class. But I just don\u2019t remember that there\nwas any discrimination like this, I just truly don\u2019t.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t see any evidences on the street or with businesses. What about\nyour father\u2019s work?",
        "A: No, my father\u2019s work actually, I think he had some work with German firms, I\ndon\u2019t know what happened there. I \u2014 I really, as I said before, there was very little\nbusiness talk, and children were \u2014 it was just like \u2014 like not in front of the children\nkind of a \u2014 kind of an attitude, which seems strange, but that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the way, at\nleast in my family was the way.",
        "Q: Well, now let\u2019s move through \u2014 through 1937, and now to March \u201938, unless\nthere\u2019s anything in 1937 you wanted to cover.",
        "A: Not particularly. I think there were \u2014 there were signs that \u2014 that Hitler \u2014 it\nseems to me that \u2014 that Mr. Dollfuss and Mr. Schuschnigg were good friends with\nMussolini. That was of course on our south, you know, we were in between. And\nMussolini was \u2014 was very friendly to Austria and he \u2014 the way I \u2014 I read some of\nthe stuff now in retrospect, after almost 60 years, he tried to \u2014 to tell Hitler to stay\nNovember 6, 1997\nout of Austria, because I think he \u2014 he want \u2014 he was afraid of Hitler like\neverybody else. So when \u2014 when Hitler made moves to \u2014 which he did, to invite\nSchuschnigg to come to see him, Mussolini told him that he thought that was a\nmistake. And he also told Schuschnigg not to go. But I don\u2019t know what happened\nin 1937, but I know 1938, early 1938, January, February, Schuschnigg finally had\nto go to Berchtesgaden. And I remember that \u2014 that period very well, because I\nwas in my last year of high school. And there was a sort of an unwritten law, at least\nit was \u2014 my parents insisted that I didn\u2019t go to any of the big carnival\n[indecipherable] it was called, until I was a senior in high school. So this was my \u2014\nmy time to go to \u2014 to balls, and \u2014 and the political situation seemed so \u2014 so\nuncertain and so \u2014 it was so, so gray, and so, so unpleasant that I was afraid they\nwere all going to spoil my fun. But I did manage to go do some of the dances. But I\ndo remember the time that Schuschnigg went to Berchtesgaden, I remember that \u2014\nthat very well, because even though we only had radio, it was all given over the\nradio and there was also something called \u2014 here it was called March of Time, I\nthink. You went to the movies for just about 45 minutes, and you had the news\nthere. So we \u2014 we got a lot of that through \u2014 through these films. And there were\nreports of how, for about two hours Hitler just raved and ranted and would not take\n\u2014 accept anything that Schuschnigg suggested. And Schuschnigg at the time had a\nNovember 6, 1997\nminister \u2014 I don\u2019t know minister of what, but his name was Guido Schmidt, who\nwas really a Nazi. But he came with Schuschnigg and kind of egged him on and\nsay oh, come on, give in, make a few little \u2014 little allowances. But it was a totally \u2014\ntotal disaster, that meeting that he had with Hitler. He came home and if I\nremember right, I think 1t was a \u2014 it was a secret to the Austrian population that he\nwas actually there. I don\u2019t think we knew about it until he came back. And it was a\n\u2014 I mean, we were told that it was no good, and Schuschnigg suggested a plebiscite.\nAnd Hitler said absolutely not. But Schuschnigg did it anyway. And that truly was\nthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back because that was just \u2014 Hitler was just\nwaiting for \u2014 for an occasion. So on March 11\", he \u2014 his army crossed the border.\nAnd I remember that extremely well because I was at a dance rehearsal. See, by\nthen I was \u2014 I was 17 going on 18 and I really \u2014 I was very serious about my\ndancing and this was gonna be a production of Faust, second part of Faust, under\nMax Reinhardt, and that \u2014 of course he was the \u2014 the \u2014 the god of the theater at the\ntime. And this was Friday evening and the rehearsal was called off. And of course\nthat whole thing was called off because Reinhardt was one of the first that crossed\nthe border; he was smart, he left, Friday the 11. And then Saturday the Luftwaffe\nflew over Vienna and Sunday the 13\", Hitler came in. And I will never forget that,\nbecause even though we were told not to go da \u2014 out on the street, of course we \u2014\nNovember 6, 1997\nwe young people wanted to see, no matter \u2014 whether we\u2019re for or against, but you \u2014\nyou wanted to see, and this Sunday night, I had tickets to go to the opera. I had a\u2014a\nboyfriend at the time who was in his one year of army duty, military duty, and he\nhad cheap tickets, or free tickets, probably. Well, you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t cross\nthe street in front of the opera, I mean th \u2014 the ring \u2014 there\u2019s the \u2014 there\u2019s a big\navenue that goes around the old town, called the ring. And all along the ring are the\nbeautiful buildings, like the opera, and the \u2014 the parliament, and the university and\nthe Burgtheater and all that. Well, people stood 10 deep to see the parade, so we\nnever made it to the opera. In fact, at the opera, people were hanging out fo \u2014 of the\nwindows, and it was sort of stormed by the \u2014 by the people who wanted to see the\nparade, and of course, Hitler himself, he was standing up in car with his right\nhanded lifted, and so forth. So it was rather \u2014 rather impossible thing to erase out of\nyour head, the noise \u2014",
        "Q: What were your thoughts when you \u2014 you \u2014 you said you saw the parade.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what were your thoughts?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know whether we thought that we \u2014 we had heard that the\nlast few years, Jews really had a hard time in Germany. Their businesses were\neither closed, or they were not allowed to do this and that. But people still \u2014 still had\nNovember 6, 1997\na life in Germany. It wasn\u2019t the \u2014 the horror \u2014 the Holocaust really didn\u2019t start until\nseveral years later. So we figured well, Austria \u2014 because we always \u2014 the\nAustrians always felt oh, it won\u2019t happen here, you know, that\u2019s the Austrian\ntemperament. But I don\u2019t know whether \u2014 whether I \u2014 I was very busy trying to\nfinish high school. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s my feeling now, but I don\u2019t know at the time. I\nthink my parents were \u2014 were terribly undone by it. But they too felt, oh well, yes,\nthe kids should probably leave, but we\u2019ll somehow stick it out. It was that attitude.",
        "Q: You said the day before was Saturday and the Luftwaffe came flying by. What\nwere your thoughts then?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I s \u2014 I\u2014 I was told to stay home, and everybody stayed home,\nbecause it was \u2014 by then you really had the feeling \u2014 see we \u2014 we thought that there\nwas gonna be a fight. We thought there was gonna be a war. We had a small\nAustrian army, but I think they were totally overwhelmed by the thought of the \u2014 of\nthe German army and the Luftwaffe, so that they decided well, we better not have a\nbloodbath. I think that was the idea. So one stayed home.",
        "Q: All right, you\u2019ve seen Hitler go by in the car, and \u2014",
        "A: From a distance.",
        "Q: \u2014 from a distance, and then what happened next?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t have school for a week. You know how kids are. And it was my\nbirthday. And that was the birthday I don\u2019t remember, because I think everybody\nelse forgot about it. It was very, very \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know. It was a \u2014 it was a in\nlimbo kind of a thing. There was a lot of \u2014 lot of parades, lot of oh, you have to join\nthe Hitler youth. But of course, you know, we wouldn\u2019t. We wouldn\u2019t even think\nabout it. It was a very \u2014",
        "Q: Why wouldn\u2019t you think about it?",
        "A: Well, because, first of all I\u2014 you \u2014 you had to declare that you had eight Gentile\n\u2014 Aryan it was called \u2014 grandparents. And then I know a lot of people who did not\njoin the Hitler youth. You didn\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t have to. You were told you had to,\nbut if you didn\u2019t join, you had to explain why. So it was a \u2014 I think that was\nprobably the first feeling of oh, we better have \u2014 we have to leave. If you \u2014 if you\nnot part of the Hitler youth, you couldn\u2019t do anything. So I can\u2019t really answer that\nquestion, I don\u2019t know what I felt. As I said, I was busy. End of \u2014 end of high\nschool was a very \u2014 it was very difficult. There was something called Matura\nwhich was oral and written exams, very difficult. It was a sort of a summary of your\n\u2014 your high school years, and we had to study hard. So we still were going to finish\nthis. So that week of vacation, which I guess it was, I don\u2019t know just exactly what I\ndid. I\u2014 I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t tell you.\nNovember 6, 1997\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Hedi Pope. This is tape number one, side B.\nAnd we were talking about \u2014 we had gotten up to the time when Hitler had come in\nand you had been a \u2014 you said, a half a kilometer away. Did you start to feel more\nJewish from then on?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I did. The \u2014 I \u2014I still saw my friends. I sa-sat next to the girl\nwho now wore the swastika on the outside of her lapel. And school continued. This\nwas March, we were going to have our Matura, that\u2019s those orals and written\nexams in June. We had to work hard. One of our favorite professors was gone. She\nwas the German literature lady. She was Jewish, so she had to go. We had a \u2014",
        "Q: How did you react to that, knowing that she had to go because she was Jewish?",
        "A: Well, you better not react it, because if you expressed yourself to somebody, you\nwere not certain what that other person \u2014 how that other person would react, and\nperhaps tell somebody that Hedi said such and such, and then that could hurt my\nfamily.",
        "Q: How did you know it could possibly hurt your family?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Well, we were told that you \u2014 right after March 13\", there were quite a few\npeople who quickly disappeared. We weren\u2019t sure just where to. Some of them\nvoluntarily just left. Some of them left with a passport, some of them without.\nOthers were taken to concentration camps. This was \u2014 this was rather \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014\nyou realized very soon that things have changed and you had to be careful. Careful\nis the word. So you just accepted it. We had somebody else take her place. The\nprincipal was replaced, because he was part \u2014 he was high up in the Heimwehr; that\nwas the patriotic front, or whatever you want to call it. And he was replaced by,\ninteresting enough, one of the regular teachers who everybody knew that he \u2014 she\nwas in the underground Nazi party. So that\u2019s \u2014 those were the changes that took\nplace. Also, as we came in after that one week of vacation, we saw a picture of\nHitler in the classroom, all the classrooms had pictures of Hitler. And every class\nstarted, you know, different teacher comes in and we had to stand up and say heil\nHitler.",
        "Q: Did you do that?",
        "A: Yes, of course. And that\u2019s another question I always get, and I feel like oh dear,\nwhat kind of a characterless person? But you know, I wouldn\u2019t be here if I would\nnot have raised my right arm.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "Q: Were you able to talk about your concerns and your fears with your parents, or\ndid they discuss this with you?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, we discussed it. And the \u2014 the idea was to \u2014 oh yes, you children,\nyou just must go, and for me it was a perfect time to leave or do something else. I\nwas possibly gonna go to university, I don\u2019t know what I was gonna do after\nMatura. So we started corresponding with two cousins we had in the U.S.",
        "Q: Ju-Just a moment, we\u2019ll get to that. What was it like for you to see a swastika?",
        "A: Well, it made you mad. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know what else to say, I \u2014 because if \u2014 if you\nsaid some \u2014 again, I have to repeat, if you \u2014 1f you said something against it, or if\nyou s \u2014I don\u2019t know, people spit on it or some, they were immediately taken away.\nI mean, it was wi \u2014 life was dangerous. And I think our parents probably told us to,\nwhen we go out, be careful. And if somebody comes towards you and \u2014 and a\nperfect stranger says heil Hitler, you\u2019d better say heil Hitler back.",
        "Q: Did you yourself have any fearful experiences on the street?",
        "A: No, not at all. I think partially because it was \u2014 I was very blonde and blue eyed.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did you have any special identity papers, or your family, saying that\nyou were Jewish at that time?",
        "A: No, not at all, no.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "Q: Y-Y-You said that people started to leave, that \u2014 those who could. Were you ev\n\u2014 ever aware of a man named Adolf Eichmann?",
        "A: Of what?",
        "Q: Of a man named Adolf Eichmann.",
        "A: No, no, not at all. No, we knew of \u2014 of Hitler and Goebbels and Goering and\nHimmler. Eichmann [| \u2014 I \u2014 we \u2014 that name, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know until they were\nlooking for him in Argentina, | think. No.",
        "Q: All right, now you said your parents started to take measures to get you and your\nsister out of the country?",
        "A: We had \u2014 we had cousins who had come to Newark, or to the une \u2014 the U.S. and\nsettled in Newark. There were two women, there was cousins on my father\u2019s side, a\ngood bit older than we were, very independent ladies. One of them \u2014 this \u2014 I\u2019m\ntalking about the 20s \u2014 got a doctorate at Heidelberg. Now that was very, very\nprogressive. The other one was a x-ray technician. She went to Sweden. She just\nhad had it with Austria, so she up and went to Sweden. And then the \u2014 the one who\n\u2014 th-the one who went to Sweden then went to the U.S. This was about 1936 or\n1937. She was just a very adventurous person. The other one, with a doctorate from\nHeidelberg, got married and had a young child, and followed her sister. She \u2014 this\nwoman with \u2014 then divorced, followed her sister to Newark, New Jersey, and the\nNovember 6, 1997\ntwo of them eked out a living, so to speak, in Newark, New Jersey. And when we\nwrote to them, they said, by all means come.",
        "Q: How soon after Hitler came into Austria did you \u2014 did your folks write to them?",
        "A: Oh, I imagine was probably June, July, somewhere there. Not really sure just\nwhen. One thing we did right away, and it was a \u2014 it was a network kind of a thing.\nEverybody went to the United States embassy and got a quota number. We had no\nidea what it was, but everybody should have one. In order to \u2014 to emigrate, you had\nto have a quota number; quotas being very different by countries. And the Austrian\nquota was very good, meaning the U.S. didn\u2019t mind Austrians coming in. But the\nItalian quota was not very good, and God forbid if you were born in Hungary, they\nwanted \u2014 like two people a year they accepted. Was a very interesting thing because\nI don\u2019t know whether this is still that way, but you \u2014 you needed a quota number.\nAnd if you wanted to know, you know, how many a month, they didn\u2019t really tell\nyou at the embassy. But I remember at the time they said oh well, your number\nshould come up around the first of the year. So this was, you know, a\u2014 738, so\nmaybe by \u201939 we could \u2014 we could think of it. But I remember very well just stand\nin line at the U.S. embassy in Vienna and get a quota number.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "Q: Did you see any signs on Jewish shops saying that they were Jewish shops, or\nwere you aware of businesses that were closed? Did you see any measures starting\nto take place once Hitler \u2014 once the anschluss occurred?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we saw that, but to the extent of \u2014 not yet. This \u2014 this was to come, but\nnot \u2014 not yet. Quite a few business people, what happened is they perhaps \u2014 if they\nhad an employee who was Aryan that they could trust, kind of put it into his/her\nhands, and that way protected themselves. There were a lot of ways of \u2014 of getting\naround that. Then they needed doctors badly at the time, so the Jewish doctors could\nstay because they were needed. So there was a lot of case by case, it was this \u2014 this\nsort of thing.",
        "Q: In April, it\u2019s been written that some Jews were taken to the local amusement\npark and assaulted. Are you aware of that? To the pra \u2014 the prater, p \u2014 p-r-a-t-e-r?",
        "A: No, \u2019m\u2014 I\u2019m \u2014I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was probably true, but I was \u2014 I was\nnot aware of that.",
        "Q: So you have graduate \u2014 when was your graduation?",
        "A: All right, we g \u2014 w-we graduated and that was kind of interesting. There were so\nmany parades going on, and so many \u2014 so many different things that we did not\nhave to go through the orals. And that\u2019s unbelievable, I mean, if \u2014 if \u2014 if I can say\nthere\u2019s one \u2014 one good thing came out of it, that I didn\u2019t have orals for my Matura.\nNovember 6, 1997\nThat the written exams were in \u2014 in mathematics, and Latin, literature and French, I\nthink. And they were, you know, five hour exams. You \u2014 you got a\u2014 got a \u2014 a title,\na theme, and you had to \u2014 to write a paper on it. So they \u2014 we had to go through\nthat, but the orals \u2014 and then that was such a relief, 1t was wonderful. And we had a\n\u2014 there was a tradition of having a Matura fire. And that meant you went to a\nrestaurant, and met one more time all the \u2014 all the peop \u2014 this was an all girls\u2019\nschool, so there were about 30 of us. And I guess you call it a roast here, but one of\n\u2014 one or two of them wrote a newspaper about it, and said the most awful things\nabout their teachers. But 1t was you \u2014 it was a totally, totally good affair, with \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t have guessed what was going on around \u2014 around us. This was in June\nthen, at the end.",
        "Q: Did you talk, or confide in \u2014 confide with your sister and \u2014 your concerns, or\nyour fears about what was happening?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I \u2014 we probably did, yeah, uh-huh.",
        "Q: What was she doing? She\u2019s a \u2014 was older than you, so what was she doing while\nyou were finishing up?",
        "A: Okay, she had done her Matura five years \u2014 four years before I did. And then\ntook business courses, and went to Paris for a year as a receptionist at the Hotel\nDes Saint Peres, which still exists. So she spoke fluent French, which she still does.\nNovember 6, 1997\nAnd then came home and really didn\u2019t know what she was gonna do. It seems to me\nshe worked for sa \u2014 for one of the book stores, as \u2014 I don\u2019t know what she did, but it\nwas no \u2014 no specialty. I da \u2014 I had this dance specialty, she didn\u2019t really have a\nspecialty.",
        "Q: Did you ever \u2014 or di \u2014 did your father talk about ever going to this central office\nfor Jewish immigration in Vienna?",
        "A: I\u2014 my father was a little bit more forward looking than my mother. She, I don\u2019t\nthink, could imagine herself leaving Vienna. My father started taking Spanish, and\nEnglish and plumbing. He was \u2014 he was good with this sort of thing. And actually\nthe \u2014 the line of \u2014 of pre \u2014 representations he had with other firms was in the line of\nbathroom fixtures and that sort of thing, plumbing type of thing. So he \u2014 he took \u2014\nhe took courses in that. And of course his \u2014 his business more or less came to a\nstandstill, and I \u2014 I to this day wonder how we could afford the rent, and the food,\nreally. I imagine there were some savings, I don\u2019t know. We had \u2014 I had a very\nwealthy uncle and aunt, sister of my mother\u2019s, who didn\u2019t have any children, I think\nthey helped us out at the time. I really don\u2019t know. Again, it was something that you\ndidn\u2019t discuss with your children, so I \u2014 I\u2019m not aware of \u2014 of \u2014 of what happened.\nBut the \u2014 they definitely turned to \u2014 turned our thoughts to getting out. I didn\u2019t\nNovember 6, 1997\nfinish my story about what we were going to do about coming to this country. These\ntwo sisters were very willing to take care of us, but \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what were their names?",
        "A: Okay, of course they were both born Politzer, older brother of my father\u2019s. And\nHelen, the one that went to Sweden and came over here, never married, so her \u2014\nshe stayed a Politzer. And the other one\u2019s name was Freid(ph), and that\u2019s an\ninteresting story, but I don\u2019t think [Pll have to tell \u2014 the time to tell about her.",
        "Q: Her first name?",
        "A: Anna and Helen. And they \u2014 when you sh \u2014 when you have \u2014 want \u2014 have some\n\u2014 somebody to immigrate, you have to furnish an affidavit. There was a \u2014 a new\nthing too, the quota and affidavit we had, those were new words in our vocabulary.\nAnd these two ladies did not have enough money to \u2014 didn\u2019t earn enough to \u2014 to\nsay, we'll take care of these. So we had to find somebody with more money. And\nmy mother had some old friends, two bachelor brothers who I think grew up in\nVienna, that she wrote to. And this was very brave of her, because I don\u2019t think\nshe\u2019d heard from them, I mean, I don\u2019t know how many years. And they\nimmediately answered, says yes, by all means, we\u2019ll let you have an affidavit. And I\nthink it was the idea they had to do it with these two cousins, because \u2014 here again,\nthis is interesting about the U.S., two bachelor brothers could not bring 1n two\nNovember 6, 1997\nyoung ladies. Which makes sense, I guess. So between the \u2014 this was a joint\naffidavit, between the two men, who had enough money, and the two women who\nhad all the family love you could wish for, that said okay, we\u2019ll take care of these\ntwo young women.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve graduated from gymnasium, and then what did you do?",
        "A: I graduated and we went for two or thr \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me for interrupting. Was there any mention of Hitler at graduation\nceremonies?",
        "A: Not that I remember. Not that I remember at all. As I said, 1t was very \u2014 it was a\nfun affair. I still have that newspaper with all the funny things in it, quite yellowed\nwith age, and it\u2019s in German and nobody but me can enjoy it. And the teachers were\nthere, and they laughed with us, and it was \u2014 it was a goodbye and so forth. It was\nreally amazing that there was none \u2014 no \u2014 no animosity whatsoever.",
        "Q: And now \u2014 you started to \u2014 to tell about what you did after graduation.",
        "A: Okay, we had a real \u2014 real nice vacation. One of my aunts \u2014 one of ma \u2014 sister of\nmy father\u2019s had a lovely villa. She actually she lived there all year long, near\nSalzburg and we usually spent two or three weeks every summer there, and there\nwas no exception, 1938. Only it was very sad, all the \u2014 the fun people, the \u2014 there\nwere youngsters our ages, many of them came from Czechoslovakia, they had their\nNovember 6, 1997\nsummer villas at that lake. They were \u2014 none of them came at the time, because of\ncourse, the Czechs were next, and I think they knew it, so they just \u2014 they just didn\u2019t\ncome. So it was a very \u2014 it was a lovely time, but the good friends weren\u2019t there.\nAnd then I took up \u2014 I watched my mother cook, and I took some dressmaking\ncourse, and I \u2014 I choreographed some \u2014 some dances for myself, because I wanted\nto audition, and I was going to, you know, make it big on Broadway. And that was\nabout it.",
        "Q: Were you aware of a conference in July 1938, the Evian Conference?",
        "A: I just very, very vaguely \u2014 every time I see it at the museum, I say yeah, I think I\nremember that, but I \u2014 I don\u2019t think I was terribly aware of it, no. It was \u2014 when \u2014\nwhen the affidavit came in, I don\u2019t know chronologically what \u2014 how it happened,\nbut the coordination of getting your passport; telling the \u2014 the official, whatever,\nyes, we\u2019re gonna leave; getting the affidavit; getting sh \u2014 a reservation on ships was\n\u2014 was \u2014 was \u2014 was daunting, it was very difficult. We went on the Holland\nAmerican, of course they were overflowing with requests. And \u2014 but as I said, you \u2014\nyou weren\u2019t sure whether \u2014 whether your papers were gonna be in order for this\nparticular crossing, so \u2014",
        "Q: How did you feel about leave \u2014 talking an \u2014 talking about leaving Austria? Did\nyou feel very Austrian? And leaving your family?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it really hit me until just \u2014 just before. As I said before, I had a \u2014 I\nhad a boyfriend and he up and left rather precipitously because of something, I\u2019m\nnot su \u2014 just sure what it was. I guess it was the family\u2019s house was searched,\nbecause one of his brothers was a member of the heim \u2014 Heimwehr. They were not\n\u2014 they were not Jewish. And he just up and left. And he told my sister, but he tell \u2014\nhe didn\u2019t tell me. So I was very undone. This was in August, I think. And \u2014 so that \u2014\nthat was kind of sad. And then some of my \u2014 my \u2014 the girlf \u2014 my girlfriends left.\nOne of them left for Sweden, and I still correspond with her, and her grandson\ncame to see me about a month ago. So I\u2014 I keep in touch with people, and another\none I went to school with left for England. And she wanted to come to the U.S., but\ndidn\u2019t have her affidavit yet. So people kept leaving, and there was a lot \u2014 lot going\non all the time.",
        "Q: What\u2019s that like for an 18 year old girl, and again, did you feel Austrian?",
        "A: Oh, I felt very Austrian. I did not ever want to say that I was German. And of\ncourse, to this day I \u2014 I ha \u2014I have my old passport, and it has a big swastika on it,\nand that really \u2014 that really hurts. I was \u2014 I was never \u2014 never wanted to say that I\nwas German, I\u2019m Austrian. And I say it now, too. That \u2014 that was very important.",
        "Q: Well, here you feel very Austrian and \u2014 and you\u2019re told \u2014 then you \u2014 your family\nsays you\u2019re going to be leaving. How did that affect you \u2014\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 at \u2014 at that time.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, I think at the time, it was a tremendous adventure. I think I felt that\nand I \u2014 I had to fee \u2014 it was the idea of the young ones go, and somehow make it\npossible for the parents to come too. So I \u2014 I think it was that feeling. I\u2014Ica-\u2014I\ncan\u2019t really reproduce what I felt at the time. I think when you\u2019re \u2014 when you\u2019re 18,\nyou're a little selfish. You know, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s just one of those things.",
        "Q: And again, the summer is over, the fall 1s starting, of thir \u2014",
        "A: The fall is starting, and \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 of ?38 and are conditions worsening? Are you seeing things on the street, are\nyou witnessing anything?",
        "A: I\u2014I personally did not witness anything. But people are leaving, and then you\nheard some awful things happen, yes. That so and so\u2019s father was shot because he\ntried to get away from something, or yes, yes, you did hear things. It was \u2014 it was \u2014\nit got to be awful. But you know, until 1t happens to you, it really doesn\u2019t register.\nAnd of course, that gets us to November, and that\u2019s when \u2014 when things really\nbecame very serious for us too, for my family.",
        "Q: From what I understand though, in October there were attacks on synagogues, to\nits schools and stores. Were you aware of that before the November night?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: I\u2014Ireally d\u2014I really don\u2019t \u2014 not aware of it, no, uh-huh. Things have a way of\nblending together now, even though I remember things better from back then, than I\ncan tell you what happened yesterday. But still it\u2019s \u2014 it has a way of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 the-\nthere are a few dates and things that absolutely stand out and always will, but then I\n\u2014 Iam not aware of anything in October. No, it was the \u2014 the November seventh\nwhen \u2014 when this young, very misguided man by the name of Hershel Grynszpan\nwent to the German embassy in Paris and shot this consular official of some sort,\nvom Rath, vom Rath. And that was on seventh, I think, and then, during the two\ndays before the man died \u2014 he didn\u2019t die until the ninth, things started to \u2014 to boil,\nbut didn\u2019t really boil over until the man was dead. And then Hitler took advantage\nof that, and 1t seemed \u2014 almost seemed as though he was waiting for an occasion\nlike this. And that of course was \u2014 was horrendousness, the only way I can describe\nit.",
        "Q: And what was \u2014 what did you see then?",
        "A: Well, what I \u2014 what I saw before it hit our family, I remember one thing that \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know what I was doing downtown. Right in the center of the city there was a\n\u2014I don\u2019t know he \u2014 whether he was the rabbi, or he was \u2014 he was just somebody\nwith \u2014 threw a robe and a little yarmulke on his head, and two or three guys went\njust after him with \u2014 with a whip, you know. And the man cried, and \u2014 and leave me\nNovember 6, 1997\nalone, you know, and the ah \u2014 and then people around it, it was \u2014 it was terrible, you\nknow, you just \u2014 just went away. You \u2014 you \u2014 you felt you should protect the poor\nman, but then again, if you did, then you got the whip. So it was this sort of thing all\nthe time. So that\u2019s what I saw, and then, as I said before, my father took classes. I\ndon\u2019t know whether this was plumbing, or English, or whatever it was he took, and\nhe just didn\u2019t come home on \u2014 on \u2014 we always call it November 10\", because that\nwas when it \u2014 when things were really \u2014 in Vienna were really unleashed. And we\nnever saw him again. And that was \u2014 that was rough. No phone call, no anything.\nSomebody called a few days later saying I bring regards and he\u2019s fine, and hung up.\nWell, 1t was somebody who was let out apparently, for some reason or other. And\nmuch, much later, not too long ago in fact, I read a description of what happened to\npeople. They herded them to one of the military installations in Vienna and they\nmade them stand up for 24 hours, and then \u2014 no \u2014 no water, no food, and then took\nthem to the train stations. It was November, it was very cold. And the next thing\nthey knew, they were in Dachau. And I\u2019ve \u2014 I read a lot about it because my\nmother never \u2014 never really heard, and I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t, that there was quite a bit\nof torture going on, and horrible things. And what puzzles me very much, because\nmy father had been in the war. He was in World War I. He was not a hero or\nanything, but he had served in the military. He was only 52 years old, not quite. He\nNovember 6, 1997\ngot to be 52 in January. And people got out. If you could prove that you \u2014 that you \u2014\nthat you gonna be out of the country within two weeks or something like that. And\nwe \u2014 we moved heaven and earth. We had a nephew of my father\u2019s, a cousin of\nmine, who had been in Israel by the \u2014 at that time. He was a rabid Zionist and he\nhad gone before things happened. And he \u2014 I think we telegrammed, and \u2014 and he\nsomehow found a way, and we, you know, let them know that my father will be out,\nbut nothing happened. And the \u2014 we have \u2014 I can show you that later, we have com-\ncommunications. We have the correspondence of my father. I think after about two\nweeks we had a card saying I\u2019m fine, don\u2019t worry, you know? And we got about\nevery other week, or something like this. I have donated the correspondence to the \u2014\nto the Holocaust Museum, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re gonna do with it. I made\ncopies though, so I have it right here, I can let you have it. And on it, it says you\nhave to have only so and so many lines, and be sure and date it, and I don\u2019t know\nwhat else, I mean you \u2014 you were really \u2014 you \u2014 you basically had to tell your\nfamily that you were fine, that \u2014 that was the thing. So that was it, and this was\nJanuary \u2014 November, December. Our date of departure was 11\" of January, which\nwas my father\u2019s birthday, and we were so hoping that we \u2014 that he could get out and\nwe could see him. And he \u2014 again and again wrote don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t change your plans.\nDon\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t do it, so we wa \u2014 which we didn\u2019t. And so we left \u2014\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "Q: Le-Le-Let\u2019s back up a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What else did you see in November? You said you saw the rabbi being attacked.\nDid you see any other damages?",
        "A: Yes, horrendous. I \u2014 I \u2014 I terribly resent the name of Kristallnacht, because all I\ncan think of is \u2014 is \u2014 1s something pretty. And it wa \u2014 there were a lot of \u2014 lot of\nbroken windows that I saw. And I \u2014 there\u2019s several other things that \u2014 one of my\nfriends, she was not a real buddy friend, but she \u2014 a good \u2014 good ac \u2014 acquaintance,\ncalled me and said, I want you to come over and see something. She called me and\nthen her very best friend. So the two of us went over there and I shall never forget\nwhat happened. Some people rang the bell and said we \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether they\nsaid they want to inspect the apartment or what it is, but they totally, totally\nvandalized, like breaking Dresden figures. Cutting open feather pillows and going\nall over the place, and cutting nice upholstery. I mean, it was just something you \u2014\nyou, in your worst nightmares. So she wanted me to see that. And I mean, things\nlike that. Or so and so\u2019s father was \u2014 didn\u2019t come home, or so and so left, on \u2014 of\ncourse, we had a story to tell too, but you were told to be very careful and \u2014 and not\n\u2014not talk about it, which is hard to do. You were really very dependent on your\nconcierge. You don\u2019t call it concierge in Vienna, you call it housemaster in Vienna.\nNovember 6, 1997\nBut we had a \u2014a family, they \u2014 you know, they live sort of on the \u2014 on the \u2014 as you\ncome in. And usually have a little apartment there. And the family that \u2014 that took\ncare of us, I think we \u2014 we were very lucky to not \u2014 not have more happen to us\nthan it did, because they put \u2014 they had \u2014 they could protect you. If somebody came\nto their hou \u2014 to \u2014 to that door and said, okay, tell us, who \u2014 who should we\nvandalize or something, you know, you were \u2014 you were totally in \u2014 a victim in \u2014 in\ntheir hands. And a lot of this \u2014 this happened. Or if \u2014 1f, let\u2019s say I\u2014 one of my\nclassmates wouldn\u2019t like me, or something like this, or if \u2014 if somebody\u2019s \u2014\nsomebody\u2019s boyfriend you broke up with or something. I mean, it was this sort of\nthing. Revenge was rampant. It was \u2014 it was not \u2014 it was not good.",
        "Q: What did that do to you in a personal way?",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 we were terribly, I mean, to \u2014 for my sister and me to leave, was \u2014 was\nterrible, you know, what could we do and \u2014 and we \u2014 we could leave \u2014 we could\neach take 40 dollars with us. So we had \u2014",
        "Q: Wha \u2014 wa \u2014 when you say for you to leave was terrible, what did you mean by\nthat?",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 we didn\u2019t know when we were going to see our parents again, of\ncourse. By then Mother was alone, but my uncle and aunt, her sister, had moved in\nwith her. And we were terribly afraid that something was going to happen to Uncle\nNovember 6, 1997\nAlfred, because he was president or vice-president of a company that had its\nheadsqu \u2014 head \u2014 headquarters in Berlin. And not only \u2014 of course it was the \u2014 by\nthen he had lost his job, and we were terribly afraid that something\u2019s gonna happen\nto him. Well, nothing did, and they lived with my mother until they all together\ncame over here in 1940, and Mother could join us. But the \u2014 the idea that \u2014 that our\nfather was at Dachau and \u2014 and Mother was alone was \u2014 was pretty awful.",
        "Q: In November did you see any destruction of synagogues, or any building\ndestruction?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, I saw \u2014 I saw a lot of this. Interesting thing happened to my \u2014\nbut that di \u2014 that \u2014 no, that didn\u2019t happen in November, that happened before, and I\nthink I\u2019d like to back up because that\u2019s rather interesting story. My Uncle George,\nmy \u2014 younger brother of my mother\u2019s, who I earlier told you about, that he was a\nmember of the Ligity-misten(ph), the one that was \u2014 he was hurt in World War I,\nhad a store in the inner city of Austria, of Vienna. And one day some \u2014 two SR\nmen came in and said, come with us. And he immediately showed his World War I\nwound, and I don\u2019t know what happened from there, but they let him go and said,\nbut you and your family have to be gone in a week. So here is, you know, your \u2014\nyour life suddenly, you got to \u2014 where do you go? And at the time the \u2014 his wife had\na brother in Italy \u2014 I mean, the irony of going from Austria to Italy. But they did,\nNovember 6, 1997\nthey were safe with the young boy, who was eight years old at the time, my cousin\nPeter. And they went to Italy, and of course pretty soon they were thrown out of\nItaly, so they had to go to \u2014 to Cyprus. And then this \u2014 then they were thrown out\nof there, I\u2019m not sure what happened, but they ended up in Palestine, and were\nprotected by the Anglican church. And my cousin, the young boy who was eight\nyears old, is a very well-known university professor, Boston University. The \u2014 the\nman in sociology. So, you know, s-some \u2014 but I remember we ma \u2014 my mother and\nmy sister and I packed up their stuff after they were gone, you know, they had to \u2014\nto get out in one week. And we \u2014 we packed up their belongings and \u2014 and sent\nthem to I don\u2019t know where, but they \u2014 they never caught up with them, so they \u2014\nthey had nothing.",
        "Q: You said that you felt bad about leaving your \u2014 your parents and not knowing\nwhen you\u2019re gonna see them. Did you feel bad about leaving the country?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Feeling Austrian.",
        "A: I felt very bad \u2014 badly leaving the country, but as I said before, going to\nAmerica was quite an adventure, and there were quite a few \u2014 before things\nhappened, before things got bad, a lot of young people, not as young as I was,\nmaybe a little older, went to America. The ones that \u2014 with a sense of adventure.\nNovember 6, 1997\nAmerica was \u2014 was where \u2014 where \u2014 where it was at, you know, we got all the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the movies, the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies, and this sort of\nthing. So America seemed like quite the \u2014 quite the place to go, cause a lot of\npeople did not have the good luck to go to \u2014 to the u \u2014 to the U.S., they had to go to\nthe Dominican Republic. And I know of people who went to Columbia and\nBolivia. And that was just not as \u2014 not as attractive as going to the U.S. But it was \u2014\nI had very mixed feelings, I\u2019m sure I did.",
        "Q: So your quota number came up while your father as in Dachau?",
        "A: Mm-hm, that\u2019s right. I think it came up then or maybe a little before that, I\u2019m not\nreally sure just \u2014 just when it come. I have an old \u2014 old little diary that I have, I\nshould look this up, but I\u2019m not sure just when we finally were told yes, you \u2014 your\naffadave \u2014 no, well, not only the quota number, the affidavit was accepted, because\nquite often people got their affidavits and oh everything\u2019s gonna be all right. Well,\nsomething happened, and something was not all right, I\u2019m not sure. But the\ncombination of our affidavits, I think, was \u2014 was very good with the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nfamily, the \u2014 the cousins that took us, and the \u2014 the \u2014 the financial security of these\ntwo men.",
        "Q: You said your father was picked up, was this while he was in class?\n44November 6, 1997",
        "A: Yes. Apparently the whole class was picked up. We-We\u2019re not sure. We \u2014 we\nreally don\u2019t know, and we will never know. But they were picked up. That was a \u2014\nit was probably because I think the \u2014 these classes were overseen by \u2014 by a\u2014a\nJewish organization, I\u2019m not sure. Or may \u2014 before emigration or something. We \u2014\nwe will never know. I mean I will never know. My mother probably would have\nknown, but I don\u2019t know.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nNovember 6, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

        "A: We were very sad to leave without knowing too much about our father\u2019s status,\nbut our \u2014 my aunt and uncle who had moved in with Mother told us, just don\u2019t\nworry about it, an-and \u2014 and everything will be all right, they said.",
        "Q: Did you write back to your father?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, but I think just mother wrote, because there were \u2014 there was \u2014 you\nknow, they limited you to so and so many lines, so many \u2014 a-and only one side of a\npiece of paper and so forth. So it was just Mother who wrote as \u2014 as little as she \u2014 as\nmuch as you could say in so many words, and he \u2014 Father wrote again \u2014 again and\nagain, the girls should go and I wish them a wonderful trip and so forth, but don\u2019t\nmake any change of plans on account of me. So we did \u2014 we did \u2014 we did write,\nyes, uh-huh. And we left on the 11\" of January, and went to Rotterdam, and there\nwe had a friend look out for us for one day and a night.

It was January in the Atlantic, 1t was very, very \u2014 how do you say it? I get\nseasick, in other words.",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 what was it like to say goodbye to your mother?",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was very difficult, and I remember myself just sobbing away. My\nsister was much braver, but I, I was really \u2014 I was really quite undone. But I, you\nknow, finally had to get on the train, and that was it.",
        "Q: Did you take anything special with you, or did she? Did your mother give you\nanything special to take?",
        "A: Well, we had a little \u2014 we had \u2014 you could take one or two pieces of jewelry, but\nyou were told if an SR man or SS man on the border says he wants that, you have to\ngive it to him. So we bought a ring, and a diamond pin, and we took a few things\nwith us, yes, but very little. You know, you \u2014 you had luggage, and there was just so\nmuch space.",
        "Q: Did you bring anything of sentimental value?",
        "A: Well yeah, we had diaries and old letters and \u2014 that I still have. And the \u2014 the\nlittle bits of \u2014 of jewelry and \u2014 and pictures, photos. Lots of photos and stuff.",

It\nwas very rainy, and gray and \u2014 and sad. That\u2019s all I can describe it in \u2014 in retrospect.",
        "Q: And then you get on the boat?",
        "A: I got on the boat, and that was lots of fun. I hate to admit it. The first four days I\nwas terribly seasick, and I was afraid to go down in my cabin because I always got\nsick. But then I got over that, and the Vandam(ph) was a very slow boat, and there\nwas something wrong with it too. So instead of just nine days, it took 12 days for us\nto cross. And there were a lot of others in the same boat, so to speak. Several\nViennese, and we danced a Lambeth Walk at \u2014 in the evening, and the food was\ndelicious. And it was really the first time on a \u2014 on a boat for me. We hadn\u2019t\ntraveled a great deal. So it was sort of a \u2014 almost a last fling kind of a thing.",
        "Q: Did you run into any difficulty in showing your papers once \u2014 in leaving Vienna\nand getting to Rotterdam? You know, when you had to go through that type of\nsituation.",
        "A: Not at all, I had a \u2014 I had a passport with a swastika on it, and \u2014 and it was just\nmade out, you know, rather recently. And no, there was no \u2014 no problem. I s \u2014 a lot\nof people did, I think we were \u2014 we were lucky, because it depended totally on who\nyou met up with.

        "A: It was a \u2014 it was a night train, and really it was perfectly \u2014 perfectly normal.\nEverything \u2014 everything was just fine.",
        "Q: You had referred to your passport, even previously, with the swastika in it. What\n\u2014 what is that like for you to carry a passport \u2014 or what was it like for you to carry a\npassport with a swastika?",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 if this was the only way I could get out of, that was it. You had to\naccept it. You \u2014 there was no way you could protest, no way. And I think this is\nvery difficult for \u2014 for \u2014 for young people in America to \u2014 to understand, that there\nwas no \u2014 no phone number, no 9-11 you could quickly call, or anyth \u2014 anybody.\nThere was \u2014 there was no law. There was \u2014 was absolutely no place where you\ncould complain. You just had to accept it.",
        "Q: Was there any time prior to your leaving that you ever felt your life was in\nimmediate danger?",
        "A: Not really, but I think it was just in my nature and my being 18 years old that I\nwas just \u2014 I was optimistic and everything was gonna be all right. And the worry\nNovember 6, 1997\nabout our father, I think was just so \u2014 so on the forefront, that I didn\u2019t worry about\nmyself.",
        "Q: Were you a very daring young woman?",
        "A: Gee, I don\u2019t know how to answer that. I-I \u2014 I guess you\u2019d call it enterprising,\nyeah, mm-hm. I don\u2019t know about daring.",
        "Q: Was your sister as optimistic as you?",
        "A: No, my sister\u2019s much more re \u2014 much more retiring than I am, an-and I think that\nis pretty much true through the rest of our lives.",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re on the boat and for \u2014 what\u2019d you say, 11 days?",
        "A: Yeah, it was 12 days, mm-hm. Was a \u2014 was a long ride, but th-the landing, the\napproaching New York harbor is \u2014 is something that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s just\noverwhelming. And it was a \u2014 finally cleared up. The sun was out, it was very cold,\nbut there was the Statue of Liberty against a blue sky, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s good. And there\nwere ma \u2014 both my cousins, and only one of the gentlemen were at the dock. And\nthings went very smoothly from there, we had all \u2014 our papers were in order, and\nwe had a big what you call steamer trunk, and \u2014 or two of them, I think.",
        "Q: How good was your English by that time? You said you had taken English in\nhigh school.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Well, unfortunately, I had seven years of French, but only three years of English,\nand my English was not good. I could s-somewhat understand, but I was \u2014 it was \u2014\nit was a disaster. But of course, here again too, you \u2014 you \u2014 when you\u2019re young you\n\u2014 you can muddle al \u2014 muddle along. And living with my cousins meant at least I\ncould \u2014 they \u2014 their \u2014 their English was pretty good, they had very heavy accents\nstill, but the \u2014 the \u2014 it was \u2014 it was pretty good. So right immediately we didn\u2019t feel\nthat this was gonna be a disaster.",
        "Q: Did you have any special emotions when you stepped onto American soil?",
        "A: Well, I did. I\u2014 you know, you \u2014 you heard so much about people kissing the \u2014\nthe earth, and \u2014 and \u2014 and Ellis Island, and so forth. I think we \u2014 we were a little bit\nmore sober about it all. We were glad that we were there, but we also were wishing\nthat \u2014 that our parents could be with us.",
        "Q: On the ship, were there other young women your age? You said there were other\npeople in your s \u2014 in the similar situation, leaving. But were there a substantial\nnumber of young people in their late teens, early 20s?",
        "A: Yes, I think I was probably among the younger ones, but there were young\ncouples, and young singles too. Yeah, it was a very \u2014 it was a very interesting \u2014\ninteresting 12 days. We had \u2014 we had fun.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "Q: So now you\u2019ve landed, you\u2019ve met \u2014 and your \u2014 did you go directly to New\nJersey?",
        "A: We went directly to Newark, New Jersey, yes, and so what are we gonna do\nnext? Well, everybody \u2014 we were called refugees. Oh, we were one of the big army\nof refugees, and I got to hate that word. And we came with all sorts of addresses.\nEverybody had people to call on that could help. And some \u2014 some of them were\nvery unlikely. But very soon \u2014 my \u2014 my sister very soon found a job with a family\nto take care of some children. And I was determined I was gonna dance. And I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t find anything right away. And of course, within a week, we got a\nletter from our s \u2014 our mother that our father had died. Which meant of course,\neverything just \u2014 just kind of fell apart there for a few days, and oh, our cousins\nwere wonderful. But we had to pick ourselves up. As I said before, we he \u2014 we each\nhad 40 dollars. And it\u2019s amazing how far 40 dollars went in 1939. So we \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what date did you actually land in the United States?",
        "A: We landed on the 23\" \u2014 or was it 25\"\"? I think it was the 25\" of January. I always\nget mixed up between the landing and my father\u2019s death. I think his \u2014 he died on the\n23\" of January, and I think we landed on the 25\", something like that. So it was \u2014 it\nwas very cold in Newark, New Jersey and we started going into New York, which\nmeant you had a little s \u2014 little streetcar ride that cost 10 cents. Then you did the\nNovember 6, 1997\nHudson tubes, which cost a nickel. And then you had the subway, another nickel.\nSo there went, if 1t\u2019s a round trip, 40 cents went for transportation. And of course, if\nyou were in New York and you were a whole day, you had to have lunch. So at\nNiddick\u2019s(ph) you could get a na \u2014 a frankfurt for four or five cents, and an orange\ndrink for five cents. And if you were still hungry you could get a cream cheese and\nnut bread for five cents. So for, let\u2019s see, 40 cents fare and 15 cents, that\u2019s pretty\ngood. You still didn\u2019t have to pay more than 55 cents for the day. So those 40\ndollars went for \u2014 for quite some time, and everything else, our cousins were\nbeautiful about it, and took care of us. My sister, as I said, then she gave up the \u2014\nthe job of taking care of children, and she at the time, of course, had \u2014 knew\nshorthand and typing and she was fluent in French. Her English was better than\nmine. So she found some secretarial work very quickly. And I got in touch with\nsomebody who had \u2014 who was the pianist for one of my dance teachers. He was in\nNew York and I looked him up. He was also the nephew of somebody we knew, so\nit was almost like a friend. And he says well, he said, it just so happens that I got\ntogether with somebody from one of the cabarets in Vienna and they\u2019re forming a\nnew group, and they found some sponsors, and maybe they can use a dancer. And I\ngot in touch with this person who was \u2014 whose name was Herbert Berghof and he\nwas very well known actor in Vienna, and I did my little twirling around with my\nNovember 6, 1997\ndance dress, and I had a record on the record player. And he says, well, I think\nmaybe we can use you. And they had just started rehearsal \u2014 this was in February \u2014\nand we got rehearsal pay, 15 dollars a week. Now that\u2019s \u2014 that was good. That was\nvery good. So I started rehearsing with this group. It was an interesting group, they\nwere something called fromme a kleine kunst Buhne, which literally translated\nmeans small stage theater. It was a \u2014 sort of a topical review that had been very\nsuccessful in Vienna. And they got out quickly, because it was the kind of a topical\nreview that made fun of politics, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they better \u2014 had to get out. So\nthey met again in vien \u2014 in New York with Herbert Berghof as a director, and they\nhad sponsors, a list of sponsors that you wouldn\u2019t believe. George S. Kaufman and\nhis wife, Irving Berlin, Edna Ferber, down the list. They all \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I have no\nidea how much money they \u2014 they gave, but it was a little corporation that was\nformed, called itself the refugee artists\u2019 group. And they got a theater and we\nopened a show in June 1939. And for \u2014 as I said, rehearsal pay was 15 dollars a\nweek, and then when we opened, we got 40 dollars a week, which was the\nminimum that actors\u2019 equity paid. And you know, all the other refugees made\nanywhere from 12 dollars, 15 dollars, 20 dollars, but nobody made 40 dollars a\nweek. So I really thought I had it made. This was summer 1939, it was terribly hot.\nThere were all but four theaters opened on Broadway because they were the only\nNovember 6, 1997\nfour that had air conditioning. And the music box, where I was doing my thing, was\none of them. It was just a glorious two month. And interestingly enough, for some\nreason or other, some time before I got in with that group and knew that it was\nreally gonna do something, I had applied for college scholarships. That was another\naddress I had, to be sure and go to the international students\u2019 service, and apply for\na scholarship. Of course, I did really not know what a scholarship was and I really\ndidn\u2019t terribly want to go to college because I had done my Matura and I was not\nthat brilliant a student. So I had applied anyway, and the woman there didn\u2019t speak\nGerman. I \u2014 my English was very broken, so we got along just fine and \u2014 and she\nsaid, well, you might hear from us. And sometime in August I got a beautiful letter\nfrom International Student Service that said, we have scholarship for you at Miami\nUniversity in Oxford, Ohio. And I just had totally forgotten that I had ever applied.\nAnd I was so happy performing on Broadway, I really didn\u2019t want to do it. And\nthere was some friends \u2014 friends of my cousin\u2019s, wonderful woman who lived in\nNew York, who was in radio and the arts, says, you\u2019d be a darn fool if you\nwouldn\u2019t take this. Said, I don\u2019t want to. She said, well, you better. And of course,\nwar clouds over Europe, very, very obvious things were going to \u2014 to be really bra\n\u2014 breaking there very quickly. And this show had very good critiques, but somehow\nNovember 6, 1997\nwe being refugees and foreigners, with the war breaking out, 1t was all a bad\nsituation. We had to be fingerprinted because we were enemy aliens. So \u2014",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 was the troupe primarily a Jewish troupe?",
        "A: No, no. Some \u2014 some were, some were not. And so I reluctantly said to Herbert,\nyou know, I\u2019m going to go to coll \u2014 Herbert was the director \u2014 I was gonna have a\nscholarship. He says oh, I hate to lose you. I said, well, what do you think of the\nshow\u201d? He says well, it may just fold. And it did. And I want off to Miami\nUniversity, Oxford, Ohio. So that was one of those decisions that I did the right\nthing. At the time it was \u2014 it was very difficult, and I had to leave New York where\nmy sister was, and I was suddenly thrown into a totally, totally different\nenvironment. It was a good thing. And I think from then on in, I realized that there\u2019s\nmore to it than just staying in New York and being surrounded by nothing but\nrefugees. And it was a \u2014 it was a good \u2014 it was the best decision I ever made.",
        "Q: How did the other students ac-accept \u2014 accept you?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m gonna write a book about that some time. In fact, at my f\u2014 my 50\"\nreunion at Miami University, I was asked to give a speech, and it was mostly on\nAm-Americanization. And Miami University was a good place to \u2014 to get it. I think\nsome of them thought I was from the moon, and they \u2014 they \u2014 you know, Austria\nand Australia, and Vienna and Venice. I mean, it was all very confusing and what\nNovember 6, 1997\ndid you speak, what language did you speak? And I couldn\u2019t believe it. I got \u2014 I\nwent to the \u2014 the registrar didn\u2019t really know what to do with me, or whoever says\nwhether I\u2019m a freshman or a sophomore. He said, well, we\u2019ll see. I brought my \u2014\nmy report cards, but you know, they were all in German. So I guess I got\nsophomore status right away. And I said, yes, but I just want to dance, I don\u2019t want\nto play basketball. Well, I had to take all these things, cause I was a physical edu \u2014\nphysical education major. And the faculty was just wonderful. I mean, I can\u2019t \u2014 I\ncan\u2019t say enough of the \u2014 the kindness that \u2014 that was extended to me. The students\nwere kind of strange. I think they re \u2014 really didn\u2019t know \u2014 I was dating some, but\nvery little, because my English wasn\u2019t good enough, and I think it was too much\nwork to go out with somebody who didn\u2019t speak the language.",
        "Q: Were there other students in your position?",
        "A: Yes, there was a \u2014 a \u2014 there was an Italian boy, young man from Rose(ph), but\nhe was Italian, for some reason or other. And there was a Hungarian and a German\n\u2014 two German girls, and a whole group of Indonesians. And their English was \u2014 was\nnonexistent, so I don\u2019t know how they got along. But I had \u2014 I just \u2014 the faculty was\njust wonderful, because I\u2019d had to take freshman English, and this woman sat down\nwith me, and you know, corrected, and taught me, pronounced and so forth. I \u2014 I\nimmediately got a part in a play because the word got out that I\u2019d been on\nNovember 6, 1997\nBroadway, you know, that was \u2014 so \u2014 so this \u2014 this marvelous man, who was a\nwell-known Shakespeare scholar of all things, gave me a part in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in\n\u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d and sat down with me and worked on pronunciation. So there\nwere all these wonderful things that happened, and I \u2014 my grades were strange in\nthe first semester, but my English was \u2014 by Christmas my English was a hundred\npercent better, and I graduated with a B.S. in 1942.",
        "Q: What kind of nata \u2014 and your mother, you said, came over when?",
        "A: Okay, let\u2019s see, this was f-fall ni \u2014 fall 1939, I went to \u2014 to Miami and I\nremember there was a minis \u2014 one of the \u2014 I think it was a Presbyterian minister, I\ndon\u2019t know how I got to him. Well I \u2014 I had really wanted to join a church, I needed\nsomething, especially with \u2014 with my father having died, it was just this \u2014 1t was \u2014 I\nwas totally undone. So I got to \u2014 to talk to somebody from one of the churches and\nsaid that I\u2019d like to help my mother come over here. And they were actually ready\nto help, but then Mother got affidavits from the same two men, and the uncle and\naunt got \u2014 there was a distant cousin in Illinois. So they got over here, they came\nover here together in April 1940. And very difficult for them. My mother was 52.\nHer sister was a good bit older, like 59 or something, 60, and Uncle was about in his\nearly 60s, and he was a \u2014 a\u2014 a big man back in Vienna. And even though he had a\nlittle money that he managed to bring out, illegally of course, but still out, he had to\nNovember 6, 1997\ntake some insignificant little position doing something. And they eked out a living\nfor a few years, yeah. Mother came down here with me after a few years and \u2014 and\nspent her last years with \u2014 with me, with her grandchildren.",
        "Q: Did your \u2014 you said you had the need to turn to the church after your father died.\nDid you turn to the church rather than exploring your Jewish roots because of what\nhappened to you because you were Jewish?",

I have the feeling the churches turned to me. | think they \u2014 they\nfelt they wanted to do something for me. I \u2014 I really think it was that way. I just\ndon\u2019t know. It\u2019s a good question, that I will ponder, but I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how\nto \u2014 how to answer that, mm-hm.",

I was \u2014 I was not brought up with, you\nknow, going to temple and doing this every Friday night and the big holidays, so \u2014\nso what good did it do me? It \u2014 1t \u2014 it \u2014 it was terrible, what it did to me. I \u2014 I really\nthink that was my \u2014 that was my attitude.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "Q: You were, I guess in the beginning of your college career when Hitler invaded\nPoland?",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 yes, yeah.",
        "Q: What was your response to that news?",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 you know, I think we all felt well, finally there\u2019s gonna be a war, you\nknow? And of course, we were waiting from \u2014 I think it was a great disappointment\nthat America didn\u2019t do more. In fact, that \u2014 this is something I remember. When we\nwere \u2014 when Hitler marched int \u2014 in March \u201938, what did President Roosevelt say?\nWha \u2014 why doesn\u2019t he? Because we had great respect for the \u2014 for the president.\nHelp is gonna come from there, you know, that was the promised land. And that\nwas a great disappointment. Now, I was old enough to understand that, at the time.\nAnd then you came over here, and there were some strange things. There was a\nFather Coughlin(ph), this isolationists. And by then we were old enough to\nunderstand. And I remember at Miami University there was a lot of this \u2014 this\nisolationists, like they didn\u2019t know what language I spoke, and so forth. You know,\nit was f-from \u2014 from another world. I think this was an eye opener. And I don\u2019t\nknow what my reaction to war was. I think if \u2014 I think we were terribly scared. I\nwas at the time scared that my mother wasn\u2019t going to make it out. And I think it\nwas the last Dutch boat that came \u2014 that left Rotterdam in April. And I also\nNovember 6, 1997\nremember that one of my best friends \u2014 but this already happened in summer \u201939,\nshe came over, I knew she was on the Bremen, and that was one of the ships that \u2014\nI think 1t was the Bremen \u2014 the news was turned around, it was going back. And I\nsaid, oh my word, Charlotte is on it. Well, they turned back again and she \u2014 she\nlanded. But it was \u2014 it was those \u2014 those things. So I think it was f-finally it was\ngonna do something. And \u2014 and also maybe, just maybe Americans were gonna be\npulled in. But of course they weren\u2019t until they had to. Which is a \u2014 which 1s all \u2014\nwhich I can understand. I can understand it now better than I did then.",
        "Q: So you were in college for the next three years?",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I-I graduated in \u2014 in 1942, and during the summers during those\nyears, I had camp jobs. I was a camp \u2014 camp counselor, because my \u2014 my field was,\nwell, as I said, physical education, but I still did the dance as a kind of a major. And\nat one of the \u2014 one of the summer camps, the head counselor was a faculty member\nat Wellesley. And she asked me what I was gonna do when I graduated from\nMiami, and I said well, I guess Pll teach phys ed in some school. She says oh, go\non, go on with it. I'll what I can do for you to get you a scholarship to Wellesley,\nand by golly, she did. And I \u2014 from Miami University, I went to Wellesley on a full\nscholarship and got a Master\u2019s degree there in \u201943. So I had it made by then, cause\nthat \u2014 that opened all the doors.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "Q: So, just to get back to the church; so you said the church was a big help to you a-\nand but did you con \u2014 actually convert?",
        "A: Well n\u2014 yeah, I actually converted, but \u2014 but again I didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t practice and",
        "Q: Wha \u2014 when did you convert?",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to think. I think \u201939, I think it\u2019s before I went to college. No, no, no,\n\u201940. I think it was \u201940 because Miami kind of \u2014 you know, they were nice to me.\nThey \u2014 they \u2014 they cared. So I \u2014 it must have been 1940, somewhere there.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what denomination?",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was Presbyterian because the Presbyterian minister, you know, was \u2014\nwas just very kind, very nice, and his wife invited me to Thanksgiving dinner, that\nsort of thing, you know, it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 I guess you\u2019d call it an opportunist. But then,\nwhoever is nice to you, you know, you \u2014 at the time I was \u2014 I was alone, I had to \u2014\nto \u2014 to fend for myself. So I think that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what happened, I\u2019m not so sure.",
        "Q: So you were at Wellesley for a year?",
        "A: For a year, yes. That was a very tough year. It was 40 \u2014 \u00b042. Fall \u201942 to \u201943, was\nvery cold. They \u2014 because of the fuel shortage, they made a two month vacation. I\nthink we \u2014 we left there early in December, and didn\u2019t come back til February. I\ntook a job somewhere in a public library in New York. My mother was here by\nNovember 6, 1997\nthen, of course. And in \u201943, I graduated and \u2014 \u201943 \u2014 of course, the war was very\nmuch on, and accepted a job. I had \u2014 yeah, I had th \u2014 some choices, but \u2014 and I\nreally wanted to \u2014 to \u2014 my mother, of course, very desperately wanted me to stay in\nNew York, but nothing came through in New York. So I went to Spartanburg,\nSouth Carolina, Converse College, and had three very happy years there as an\nassistant professor. And that took me to 1946.",
        "Q: You obviously followed the path of the war. How difficult was that for you?",
        "A: Well, again, I was very young, and you had these attachments to various people\nwho were on different fronts. I corresponded with one young man in Europe, one in\na \u2014 inya \u2014 Burma theater and another one in the South Pacific. And I did a little\ndating in Spartanburg, it was a \u2014",
        "Q: The-These were all Americans?",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah, uh-huh. This was a \u2014 Spartanburg was very much a camp town,\nCamp Croft. It was an infantry camp. And it was a lovely college that had a very\ninteresting music department. So with \u2014 with my dance thing I \u2014 I really had a \u2014 it\nwas a good \u2014 good place for me. Cooperation with the music department, and I had\nto put on the \u2014 the annual May Day and there were several other chances to dance\nmyself, and it was \u2014 it was a good \u2014 it was a good three years.",
        "Q: Can you describe your thoughts at the time of the end of the war?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: May 1945, I remember it so well and \u2014 and I get a big, you know, young kids\nshake their heads because it \u2014 it was at Converse College, and I guess we heard the\nnews on the radio and everybo \u2014 everybody sa \u2014 it was announced that no classes\nthis morning because there\u2019s gonna be big announcements about armistice. And we\nwere all assembled in the \u2014 in the big assembly hall and listened to a radio saying\nthe war is over. So that was \u2014 that was tremendous. And of course I\u2014 my mother\nwas in New York and my sister was working. And I was, by then, 20 \u2014 25, and I\nwas just wondering what \u2014 what was gonna \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s gonna happen in\nAustria. I didn\u2019t immediately want to come back, because I realized that that\u2019s\nimpossible, and I didn\u2019t have any \u2014 didn\u2019t have \u2014 had very little money. My first\nsalary was 1700 dollars a year for assistant professor. It\u2019s hard to believe, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Q: Were you a citizen?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: When did you become a citizen?",
        "A: You take out first papers when you first come. And I took out my first papers in\nNew York. This was \u2014 it must have been right away in \u201939. And it takes five years,\nso that would have been \u201944. Something happened there, because I was in Ohio\nwhen I was supposed to be doing something else, be sworn in for something, and it\ntook extra long for me. It \u2014 1t took, I think five years and a half for me to be a\nNovember 6, 1997\ncitizen, but \u2014 because there was some paperwork there. So it must have been \u201944,\nmaybe \u2014 maybe early *45, I\u2019m not sure just \u2014 just when, but yes, I definitely\ncouldn\u2019t wait. Your \u2014 your first papers are your \u2014 your sort of your \u2014 your passport\nto everything. But we had \u2014 we had to be fingerprinted. When the war broke out in\nSeptember 1939, all alien \u2014 I was an enemy alien. I had that passport with the\nswastika on it. So I was an enemy alien, and had fingerprinted. But \u2014 and you had a\nlittle card with your fingerprints on it, I think, or something. It was \u2014 was kind of\nobnoxious, but then, why not? It\u2019s just like now, you know, with a \u2014 I \u2014I- the\nimmigration nowadays, you know, I \u2014 I tried to tell everybody I was a legal\nimmigrant. And that was the only way to come to this country, I don\u2019t think there\nwere illegal immigrants then, I don\u2019t know, maybe there were. But this \u2014 this was\nall very legal.",
        "Q: Did you have any negative experiences from other Americans because of where\nyou came from and the way you spoke?",
        "A: I remember one \u2014 one professor in the education department in Miami\nUniversity who gave me a D and I was very undone about it. It was very difficult\nfor me, I mean the expressions were so \u2014 it was so far removed from my\nbackground. And I remember I went to my advisor at the time and I said, I don\u2019t\nknow what I\u2019m gonna do, you know, it was so divis \u2014 and she talked to him, and\nNovember 6, 1997\nshe very frankly said well \u2014 he said \u2014 he said, how 1s she every gonna get along in a\nschool with that \u2014 with a broken English, or something like this. That was \u2014 that\nwas the only time though. Otherwise no, it was \u2014 it was nothing but \u2014 but positive. I\n\u2014 | must say I \u2014",
        "Q: Where did you live after the war?",
        "A: Okay, I was three years in Converse College, and I got \u2014 I was married in *46.\nAnd that\u2019s very interesting story because I corresponded with my husband for a\nyear before I met him. His \u2014 he was in South Pacific, and my best friend, who went\nto Indiana University while I was at Miami, met her husband at Indiana\nUniversity, and they were married there. And when the war broke out, her husband\nwent into the navy and was stationed in the South Pacific. She took a job with the\nDefense Department in Washington. And every time I went from Spartanburg to\nNew York, I stopped over in Washington and visited with her and we had fun, we\ntook pictures. And she sent a photograph of her and me, to her husband in the South\nPacific. And this Lieutenant Pope saw my picture and wanted to know whether I\nwas free and available. So I said, well we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll try a correspondence. And he\nwrote me a letter and I wrote back, and we went back and forth for a year. And it\u2019s\n\u2014 was ver \u2014 it was a very interesting correspondence. And \u2014 and war was over in the\nSouth Pacific in August 95 \u2014 in \u2014 1n August \u201945. And he came back \u2014 well, the \u2014\nNovember 6, 1997\nthe single guys didn\u2019t come back right away, you know, they had to wait. So he\ncame to Spartanburg in January \u00b046, and stayed and stayed. And I said, don\u2019t you\nthink you should see your mother and father? He said yeah, I think I\u2019Il do that, and\nhope to get a car away from my father, and Ill come back. And he did exactly that,\nand he was back within a week and stayed, and we became engaged and married in\nJune \u00b046. And the funny thing is that he kept all my letters, and I kept all his letters.\nAnd when we celebrated our 50\" anniversary a year ago, I put all this together into\ntwo books and gave it to my children. So they have all that correspondence, which\nis kind of a nice story.",
        "Q: How many children do you have?",
        "A: Two. We have two children; a daughter Bonnie, who is \u2014 lives in Des Moines,\nIowa, married for the second time. She is a special education, learning disabilities\nteacher. She is married to a\u2014 to a \u2014 to a physician. Her first husband was \u2014 is an\nacademic, he was \u2014 he\u2019s now vice president of a university in California.

        "A: Okay, our son Bruce is \u2014 he\u2019s a little younger than daughter Bonnie. Lives in\nAtlanta, is an optometrist. He was married for five years, but is divorced.",
        "Q: Did you work after you were married?",
        "A: When we got married in 1946, we first settled in Washington. You could not\nfind an apartment for love or money in Washington in 1946. Somehow we \u2014 we \u2014\nwe got a little place in Adams Morgan, and I immediately found a teaching\nposition which \u2014 which was called Marjorie Webster Junior College. I taught\ndance for two years, until our daughter was born in \u201947. We moved into Fairlington\nApartments, stayed there for four years until we built this house, 1400 Questo(ph)\nDrive. I did what I said I was gonna do when I was 10 years old, I was gonna have a\ndance school, and I did it in Alexandria, Virginia. I opened it in 1947, and it was a\n\u2014 was a really flourishing business. I\u2019m very proud to say that I had as many as 250\nstudents. I taught afternoons, of course, children had to come after school. I did all\nsorts of benefits and \u2014 and performances. I carried on until about 1980. I was\nsomewhat burned out by then, and one of my former students took over briefly,\nonly she didn\u2019t try to \u2014 she \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to work that hard. And it\u2019s finally\nNovember 6, 1997\nclosed, I\u2019m not sure just when, 1985, I think. We had a \u2014 a \u2014 a professional group,\ndance group attached to it, but that \u2014 that really depended on funding and things\nbecame just too difficult. So ?ve been very happily retired since about 1980.",
        "Q: Do you think that you would be a different adult if you hadn\u2019t experienced what\nyou had gone through?",
        "A: Oh yes. And I hate to \u2014 hate to say this but I think my two children are \u2014 are very\ndi \u2014 they\u2019re wonderful children, and they\u2019re making a good living, and they\u2019re \u2014\nthey\u2019re working hard, but they\u2019ve never had the hardships that I had to go through,\nand it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s hard to admit it but I think a little hardship now and then is good for\nyou.",
        "Q: What did it do for you?",
        "A: Well, \u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m more compassionate. I\u2019m more aware of what \u2014 what awful\nthings can happen, and I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not glad that things\nhappened the way they happened, but I \u2014 it has certainly \u2014 certainly widened my\nhorizon, if that\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s an understatement, I think. Yeah, I think things could be\nvery different, very different. I can see it now. We go to Austria often. I have good\nfriends there, I went back to my 50\" high school reunion, and I stayed with a former\nclassmate who was m \u2014 first time married to a pilot in the Luftwaffe. And she\ninvited me. And I think it was almost \u2014 th-the invitation wi \u2014 to me was almost like\nNovember 6, 1997\na peace offering, it was wonderful. She \u2014 she just was as sweet and nice as you can\nbe. And I heard a lot of stories that what happened to people who stayed over there.\nAnd some of the experiences were worse than mine.",
        "Q: Yo-You\u2019re saying austri \u2014 not \u2014 not Jews, but Austrians who stayed?",
        "A: Yeah, Austrians, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Yeah. Was there ever a time when you resisted thinking about what you went\nthrough in those difficult months in Austria, and then losing your father?",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I don\u2019t know how to answer that. Of course, I th \u2014 I think of \u2014 in fact, I\nthink of it all the time and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to \u2014 to \u2014 to not \u2014 not be bitter. Ma\n\u2014 my mother lived with us for 10 years and she naturally, understandably was very\nbitter. And she could \u2014 she could not enjoy the things she should have enjoyed, like\na \u2014 two cute little grandchildren here. And my husband was very good to her. My\nhusband is Gentile. So she was bitter. I\u2014 I am not bitter, and \u2014 and I don\u2019t think I\never will be. I think the \u2014 the \u2014 the museum d-doing the \u2014 the museum work is\nalmost like therapy.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about that now. Can you describe your first encounter with the\nmuseum? This is before you began as a volunteer. How did you learn about the\nmuseum and so forth?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Well, there was an awful lot in the paper about the Holocaust Museum. And\ninitially, maybe when it was first chartered, which I think was in 70 \u2014 1978 under\nJimmy Carter, I said to myself, what do we need a museum right here in\nWashington for? I \u2014 really, this was my reaction. Which 1s strange, but \u2014 but that\nwas it. I said, people are not gonna understand it. Which, you know, I had exp \u2014\nexperience with that, and that\u2019s why I never really \u2014 I never really talked about my\nexperiences to anybody. My children didn\u2019t know about \u2014 about their grandfather\nuntil they were grown, because I had the feeling that was \u2014 was \u2014 I couldn\u2019t do it, I\ndon\u2019t know. It\u2019s strange, but it\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the way it was. So I had the feeling wha-\nwhat\u2019s this \u2014 what\u2019s this museum gonna do here? And then 1-1t was built. Of course,\nyou saw the picture of the \u2014 the railroad car coming into the museum, and all that, it\ngot be kind of exciting. So when it \u2014 when it opened, and there was a little item in\nthe paper about volunteers are \u2014 are being searched for, I \u2014 I applied. And I think\nthe first visit was \u2014 1s quite overwhelming. And I \u2014 I remember my sister and some\nother people said, how can you do that, how can you do that? And I still have a very\ngood friend who was \u2014 was married to a German, and she said, I don\u2019t want to go\nthere, I can\u2019t go there. Different people react differently. I\u2014 1\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say I\nenjoyed it, but 1t was \u2014 to me it was wonderful that this was done.",
        "Q: So you began working when it first opened?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: I\u2014I-\u2014TI think I was in the second group of volunteers. It opened in April 793. I\ndidn\u2019t start working until October/November \u201993. So \u2014",
        "Q: And \u2014 and what kind of work do you do there?",
        "A: Just on the floor. I can\u2019t think of the word right now for \u2014",
        "Q: In the Visitors\u2019 Service?",
        "A: Thank you, Visitors\u2019 Services, yes, uh-huh. The \u2014 the usual, you know,\nanswering questions in the information desk, giving the little spiel at the elevator,\ntearing tickets and just \u2014 just generally. I\u2014 I wish sometimes that the work would be\nmore intelligent, but then, if they need the menial tasks, that\u2019s all right too.",
        "Q: Why is that all right?",
        "A: Well, they need \u2014 somebody needs to do it.",
        "Q: How has working at the museum affected your life, or has it? And has it affected\nyour memories of the Holocaust?",
        "A: Yes, it has definitely affected my memories of the Holocaust. I have a library\nabout the Holocaust. I\u2019ve learned a lot of things about it that I didn\u2019t know. This is \u2014\nthis 1s \u2014 and the bookstore, I think, in that museum, is wonderful. I \u2014 I \u2014 I buy all the\ntime, and I \u2014 I feel as though this 1s a \u2014 this is very important work. Very important.\nI had a chance to \u2014 to do some of the Fanny Mae tours, but I truly felt that the\nchildren who are led in small groups had no idea what this was all about; they were\nNovember 6, 1997\nnot prepared. I think it\u2019s been corrected now, and they only take the little older\nones, and prepare them better. I \u2014 I love to give a little briefing to th-the group\nthere. But I la\u2014I like my duty at the group desk best, because there yo \u2014 I have the\nfeeling I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m dealing with \u2014 with people, and I \u2014 I love these little older\nteenagers, juniors or seniors in high school. And give them the briefing and tell\nthem about no eat or drink and that sort of thing. And then I very briefly mention\nthat when you go on the fourth floor now and you see the takeover for Austria, you\nthink of somebody who\u2019s been there, and their mouth just drop open.",
        "Q: Cause you tell them you yourself are from Austria?",
        "A: That\u2019s a huh, just like that, you know. And I wish I could do more of that. That\u2019s\nthe \u2014 that \u2014 that\u2019s [indecipherable]. I wouldn\u2019t call it a complaint, because that\u2019s\nthe way it is, but one \u2014 I think one could \u2014 could use people like me, who\u2019ve been\nthere, and \u2014",
        "Q: What special insights do you think you bring because of your experience?",
        "A: That it\u2019s really, truly true and somebody who was there is still alive. It\u2019s a\u2014I-I\nth \u2014 that\u2019s what makes it very interesting to me, that I\u2019m old enough now to look\nback at 1t and how \u2014 how \u2014 how wonderful that I could be there and now I\u2019m here\nand I can still talk about it, and it\u2019s all true. I \u2014 I think the museum has la \u2014 done a\nlot to the \u2014 the deniers of the Holocaust anyway, but then if there\u2019s somebody there\nNovember 6, 1997\nwho \u2014 who really \u2014 and this person, you know, I speak English pretty good, and all\nthat kind of stuff. It\u2019s \u2014 I think it makes it very believable to \u2014 to that particular\ngroup, and I can tell, because then they get on the elevator and \u2014 and they say thank\nyou, thank you so much and that sort of thing. It\u2019s \u2014 1t \u2014 I think 1t means something.",
        "Q: If you have friends who are survivors, do you enlist them to be volunteers in the\nmuseum?",
        "A: I haven\u2019t really, no I haven\u2019t \u2014 I haven\u2019t tried. I\u2014 I don\u2019t have any friends here\nwho are survivors. I\u2019ve \u2014 me think, no, I\u2014 I don\u2019t have anybody. My sister came to\nvisit and of course she looked at it, and she was \u2014 she was somewhat blown away\nby it. I think you are when you see it the first time, but then you get used to it.",
        "Q: Can you describe your relationships with the other volunteers who are survivors,\nor who were witnesses to the Holocaust?",
        "A: In my particular group, let me see, let me think. Yeah, my particular group is one\n\u2014 one other lady from Hungary, and we talk about it a little bit, but not very much.\nAnd then there\u2019s another gentleman on Fridays who \u2014 Friday mornings who I talk\nto. I\u2019m not sure what happened to him. We \u2014 we talk about it very little. It\u2019s\ninteresting, but we \u2014 we don\u2019t. I\u2014I don\u2019t feel our \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I want to dwell on it. Pm\nvery happy to talk to you and talk about it there, but \u2014 but to constantly \u2014 it\u2019s a little\nbit like, you know, people, men who have been in a war, and constantly talk about\nNovember 6, 1997\ntheir experiences in the war, and people just sort of yawn and say, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s li \u2014it\u2019s a little bit like that, and I don\u2019t want to be that way.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about your impressions of the me \u2014 museum\u2019s non-survivors\nvolunteers and staff, either Jewish or non-Jewish?",
        "A: ?m-\u2014I\u2019m very impressed with the type of person who is a volunteer. I don\u2019t\nknow whether I\u2019m just \u2014 just lucky with the particular group on Friday afternoons,\nbut they are just a \u2014 just a wonderful group of people, and they \u2014 they \u2014 they listen\nto your experiences and they \u2014 they \u2014 they feel that I have something to offer that\nthey don\u2019t have, and they like to listen and hear about it. I have to say the same\nabout all the nice young people who are employed, and not volunteers. I say that\nespecially because I-I\u2019ve heard people complain about them being not always aware\nand tactful and so forth. I\u2019ve had just the opposite experience. I \u2014 I think they\u2019re\nvery nice young people, and they too want to listen, and when they hear that you\u2019re\na survivor, oh, you know, they \u2014 they get very curious. And one young man wrote a\npaper about me for his \u2014 one of his college courses.",
        "Q: This was an intern, you mean, at the museum?",
        "A: No, he was a regular employee. He wa \u2014 he was a regular Visitor Services, but\npaid, Paid staff.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "Q: What is it like for you when you\u2019re at the museum and you hear people speaking\nGerman, do you say anything?",
        "A: Yes indeed, I say it in German. And then they kind of look around and they\u2019re\nvery happy. I do that in German and I speak enough French too, to do it, and I enjoy\nthat very much. I \u2014 I \u2014 it\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s difficult to admit, but my mother tongue 1s sort of\ngone away. It\u2019s difficult sometimes to \u2014 to express myself. So it\u2019s \u2014 yeah, I \u2014 I like\nthat the \u2014 the \u2014 the foreign language thing 1s \u2014 there should be more of it, I think and\nshould be publicized perhaps that \u2014 but then again, me \u2014 especially Germans, they\nall speak English, so they don\u2019t really need me.",
        "Q: Is there any memorable experience that you\u2019ve had while you\u2019re working at the\nmuseum?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the one small group of Fanny Mae kids I had, and I led them around\nand we came to the \u2014 to the Austrian part and then to the Evian Conference, and the\nidea of \u2014 of people not \u2014 people not being able to go anywhere if they\u2019re thrown out\nof their own country, and this young man, who had no clue to what this whole thing\nwas all about, he says, oh dear, where would I go? That to me was a very poignant\nremark. Otherwise I \u2014 I \u2014 these very much routine, and it\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2019s pleasant work, but\nit\u2019s not \u2014 not terribly challenging, shall we say.",
        "Q: Are there any particular exhibits there that you identify with personally?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Yes. I\u2014I think the \u2014 the one \u2014 the little \u2014 little video on Austria, which is \u2014 1s\nvery wrong in a way, because it doesn\u2019t show the many people that didn\u2019t go out\nthere and yell heil Hitler; there were a lot of them. I mean, on the outside it looked\nas though they were welcoming Hitler, but there were a lot of them who didn\u2019t. The\n\u2014 let\u2019s see, seems to me there was a \u2014 a\u2014 one \u2014 one thing that gives me goose\npimples every time I go up there, there is something called a Horst Wessel Lied,\nhave you ever heard of that? Which became almost like an anthem, and we had to\nlearn the words to it. And that \u2014 that is being played, you know, on the fourth floor.\nAnd every time I go up there and hear it, I just \u2014 just shiver a little bit. It\u2019s\ninteresting. It\u2019s a very kinesthetic experience. And the whole thing on\nKristallnacht is \u2014 is to me is \u2014 1s very \u2014 very shattering. It\u2019s shattering to me, and\nsometimes I stand up there and people go up there and they look and then they walk\nright by. And I feel as though I want to shake them and say hey, read on, you know,\nthat sort of thing. So I think that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s probably \u2014 but that\u2019s impossible to\nimpart on anybody else.

Those were children of the\nolder sister of my \u2014 my father, so they were quite a bit older than I was. And I have\na cousin in England who lost her parents and older sister. She is exactly my age.\nHer father was my \u2014 my father\u2019s brother, and mother. So we lost them. Let me\nthink, on my mother\u2019s side, there was a cousin of my mother\u2019s, and her mother\u2019s\nsister. So the very, very old lady, and her daughter, they were deported to\nTheresienstadt and the old lady was 80 years old, had a broken hip when she was\ndeported.

And I have the feeling if \u2014 if \u2014 what they must have suffered,\nI should suffer a little bit, looking at the names. That\u2019s one way to look at it. I don\u2019t\nknow how \u2014 how else to \u2014 to describe it, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 again, it\u2019s sort of\nlike therapy. It\u2019s guilt, I guess. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Guilt of what?\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Guilt that I\u2019m here and they are not. Cause it was \u2014 it was luck, and these two\ncousins, one of them \u2014 one of them died when she was 80. The other one, kind of an\ninteresting story, the one that \u2014 that was married and divorced and has a son, 1s now\n94 years old and lives in Helsinki. Cause her son, who got his degrees from\nSwarthmore and Harvard, he\u2019s a psychiatrist, married a Finnish girl, and the\nFinnish girl couldn\u2019t stand it in the U.S., so they had to move to Helsinki. And he\nteaches there, and my cousin Annie lives in Helsinki, and writes, and she writes in\nGerman and English and Finnish and French. A real genius. And my sister visited\nher last \u2014 last [indecipherable] so some \u2014 some people, you know, if \u2014 if these two\nwomen wouldn\u2019t have given us the affidavit and the impetus to come, we \u2014 I \u2014 I\nwouldn\u2019t be here.

And was kind of interesting, I have one \u2014 one\ngranddaughter, and okay, my children are \u2014 are half Jewish, so my granddaughter is\n\u2014 has one Jewish grandmother, me. And this was a few years ago, she \u2014 they going\nto Congrational(ph) church, or something like that. And she says, you know, Mom,\nyou know I am Jewish? And you should see her, she\u2019s blonde and \u2014 the most\nbeautiful blonde hair, blue eyed. She looks like a \u2014 like a Scandinavian of some\nNovember 6, 1997\nsort, but you know, it\u2019s that sort of thing, it\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2019s \u2014 makes you laugh. No, I don\u2019t \u2014\nI don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t feel Jewish. And I don\u2019t \u2014 this dwelling on \u2014 on what happened,\nand some awful things happened to these people who \u2014 who speak for the museum,\nyou know. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve \u2014 you\u2019ve interviewed any of the ladies who\n\u2014 who speak about their experiences, and \u2014 and \u2014 and they go around talking about\nit all the time.

And Mother\nwas lonesome and Mother didn\u2019t have anybody her age, and I said, well, Mother,\nI'll take you across there, I know they have women\u2019s gr \u2014 oh, I don\u2019t like that.",
        "Q: So neither your mother or your sister were upset when they heard \u2014",
        "A: No, no, oh no, no. No, they \u2014 I think they encouraged it. Not at all. It seems\nstrange, but \u2014 but I think \u2014 I think European Jews are very different in that respect\nfrom American Jews. Maybe it became that way, I don\u2019t know. I \u2014 I just truly don\u2019t\nknow, I would hate to \u2014 to express my \u2014 an opinion. My \u2014 my cousin, the\nsociologist college professor, he \u2014 they converted when they were in Palestine with\nthe Anglicans. I think they became Anglican. And he, in fact, writes a lot and talks a\nlot about religion. Was on television with Bill Moyers not too long ago, and he\nNovember 6, 1997\nconsiders himself a \u2014 maybe not a Christian, but \u2014 but forgets about it. So this 1s a \u2014\nI think the har \u2014 the \u2014 what has happened has a lot to do with it. He maybe felt\nangry too. Hey, if you don\u2019t want me, I don\u2019t want you kind of a feeling. I don\u2019t\nknow. That\u2019s hard to analyze.",

        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: \u2014 experience, or what happened to their grandfather. And when did you start\ntelling them?",
        "A: I hate to pinpoint it, I \u2014 because I\u2019m not sure \u2014 when I had the feeling they were\nold enough to understand. When they learned things in history, you know, to s \u2014 to\nplace it where \u2014 where it belonged.",
        "Q: And what was their reaction?",
        "A: I\u2014I\u2014Iknow \u2014I know my \u2014 my daughter, let\u2019s see \u2014 I took her to \u2014 we were in\nVienna together, and I took her to my father\u2019s grave, and there was some Hebrew\nletters on it, and I think that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s when it came out. She was a teenager then.",
        "Q: So your father\u2019s body was returned from Dachau?",
        "A: He was cremated, yeah. Because the story goes that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 that he died from\nnatural causes, if you can say that. It\u2019s ridiculous. He \u2014 he became ill with\nNovember 6, 1997\npneumonia. And believe it or not, he \u2014 there was a hospital. He was \u2014 it was at a \u2014\nthe \u2014 at the concentra \u2014 conc-concentration camp hospital, and died there. So his \u2014\nhis ashes and \u2014 and belongings with a little package, you know, came \u2014 came to\nMother. And something happened there, he \u2014 they \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t open the grave\nof his parents, so he\u2019s actually buried with his grandmother. Very, very strange.\nAnd I go there, I mean, when we go to Vienna I always go to \u2014 go to the grave.",
        "Q: What was your daughter\u2019s reaction when you told her then that \u2014 of your\nbackground?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think she \u2014 I don\u2019t think she reacted at all. She says, yeah, I saw \u2014 I saw\nthe Hebrew. Is \u2014 this was not \u2014 this was not anything that was either upsetting her or\neven \u2014 it was just something she \u2014 she took. And then I think she \u2014 she told her\nbrother and \u2014 and he said, oh, you\u2019re kidding. But that would be his reaction, he\u2019s a\ndifferent sort. So it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not that much of a deal, somehow. I hate to\nadmit it, but that\u2019s just about the way it is.",
        "Q: Are there any sights or sounds today that trigger a memory of your time \u2014",
        "A: The Horst Wessel \u2014 the Horst Wessel Lied, yes, and oh, Strauss waltzes, yes,\nmm-hm. But I think that\u2019s my dancing background that does that. I was \u2014 I would\njust come from \u2014 from \u2014 we \u2014 we spent two weeks in Europe in September, and we\nwere \u2014 for one week we were in Austria in a little village way up in the Alps. And\nNovember 6, 1997\nit\u2019s kind of interesting to see these young people, it\u2019s \u2014 Austria is \u2014 is booming, you\nknow, it\u2019s very, very do \u2014 economy is doing very well, and even the people up there\nthat \u2014 what used to be peasants, they\u2019re very \u2014 they speak English rather well, and\nyou \u2014 you wonder what their grandparents did. In fact, that was my real reaction. I \u2014\nthere was a group of German kids at the museum, and it was such a happy\ncoincidence because the \u2014 the museum should somehow be prepared to get foreign\ns-speaking people into the right places. Well, this was wonderful, this was a group\nof exchange students who were on their way back home, I think, they came \u2014 they\nwere in Cleveland. And they were wonderful kids, very well behaved, but I really\nand truly said to myself, I wonder how much they know about this, and I wonder if\nanyone\u2019s grandfather or great-grandparent was one of those SS people who did\nawful things, or what \u2014 what they know about it. Because for a few years now \u2014 I \u2014\nI mean, y \u2014 I think now they\u2019re teaching it again in school, but let\u2019s say in the 50s or\n60s, I don\u2019t think the schools in Germany were taught \u2014 taught about the\nHolocaust. I \u2014 I really don\u2019t think they were. Oh what? Yeah, really, does that\nhappen? No, not here, kind of a thing.",
        "Q: Ha-Have you been to Germany?",
        "A: I \u2014 just through it. Not really, I\u2019ve never \u2014 well, you know, you land in Munich,\nand we took what is called the romantic road. I\u2019d like to go to Berlin because it\u2019s\nNovember 6, 1997\nsupposed to be beautiful. But not really. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on purpose or \u2014 it just\nhasn\u2019t worked out. I\u2019d rather go to Austria.",
        "Q: Do you feel Austrian or American?",
        "A: I feel American, very American. In fact, this hyphenated thing, you know,\nItalian-American and so forth, I \u2014 I just think it\u2019s bad. \u2019'm \u2014 I\u2019m American, very\nmuch so. And I \u2014 in fact, I think as soon as I went away from New York, cause I\nwent back a lot, because my mother was there \u2014 my sister still lives there. But as I\nstarted Miami University and went to college, and entered Wellesley and so, I was\n\u2014 was very bent on \u2014 on Americanization. I was probably going to the other\nextreme. I wanted to not have an accent, I wanted to \u2014 to be Americanized. And, I\ndon\u2019t know, then with American husband, of course, he was in the navy, you know,\nand his parents, Massachusetts, Boston. So I \u2014 I made a real effort the other way,\nmaybe \u2014 maybe to the extreme, I don\u2019t know. But I feel very American. But when I\ngo back to Austria the \u2014 the dialect comes back and I \u2014 I feel very much at home.\nIt\u2019s a wonderful feeling. It\u2019s something that \u2014 that is kinda great when you go to a\nforeign country, but it\u2019s not a foreign country. It\u2019s very nice.",

        "A: My maiden name was Politzer. That\u2019s like the Pulitzer prize, but with an O.\nAnd it was always Hedi Politzer. As I say, the Hedwig was not something that I\nespecially cherished, even as a child.",
        "A: Iwas born March 18\", 1920 in Vienna, the capital of Austria. I have an older\nsister, there are just the two of us. My parents were both born in Vienna, and they\nwere both born in 1887. So we\u2019re really going back to the Victorian age, the Gay\n90s, whatever you want to call it, and my upbringing, I think, was accordingly.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: My sister Ava \u2014 Eva \u2014 Ava, I guess, Ava Politzer, she is not married. She was\nborn in Vienna also in June 1915.",
        "A: Okay. Both my parents came from rather prosperous, middle class, I guess you\nwould call it. Both grandfathers were prominent businessmen in Austria.\nGrandfather Ludwig Politzer was born somewhere in the far reaches of the\nHapsburg empire in what is now Hungary, I guess, and came to Vienna as a very\nyoung man, to learn the language and to absorb a little culture. That was the thing to\ndo for young people with any kind of ambition, to come to the capital at the time. It\nwas, of course, the cultural center, right after Paris and Rome and London. He had\na very interesting gold and silver \u2014 he was a gold and silversmith in a ta \u2014 1n a stre \u2014\non a street that was called Papagenogasse, which is rather \u2014 rather very Viennese,\nyou know, Papa Geno is one of the characters in \u201cThe Magic Flute.\u201d And a very\ninteresting thing about Grandpa Politzer, we never really knew what kind of an\nartist he was, and in \u2014 in eight \u2014 in 1981, when the Metropolitan Museum had a\nbeautiful exp \u2014 exhibit of Hapsburg treasures and \u2014 and costumes, we suddenly\nstood in front of a big, big [indecipherable] I call it, exhibit of jewelry that\nHungarian noblemen wore, and it was made by Ludwig Politzer in circa \u2014 it said\nNovember 6, 1997\ncirca 1872. So my sister and I just \u2014 just \u2014 just couldn\u2019t believe it. I mean, this was\njust an unbelievable thing. We traced it down and it is now the property of the\nImperial Museum in Budapest. And to try to get hold of somebody who knew\nsomething about it was \u2014 this was 1981, I said, was impossible. So I\u2019m still trying to\nfigure out how I could see it one more time. But this was a \u2014 a beautiful thing. Also,\nhe has a \u2014 a very interesting piece exhibited in one of the museums in Vienna. So\nunbeknownst to us when we lived in Vienna, he was apparently quite \u2014 quite an\nartist. The business was later on carried on after his death by one of the brothers of\nmy father\u2019s, but I don\u2019t really know what happened. It doesn\u2019t exist any more. The\nother grandfather also came from somewhere in Hungary, as a very young man,\nabout 15 years old, to learn something besides Hungarian. And he turned out to be a\nvery well-known businessman. He had the most \u2014 best known haberdashery, I guess\nyou would call it, on what would be the Fifth Avenue of Vienna, called Karntner\nStrasse. And once or twice a year he went to London and Paris for buying\nmaterials and \u2014 and \u2014 and for made-to-order suits for men and women. It was called\nthe English fleet, the Englisch-Flotte, it was very well known, and it was, until\nabout 10 years ago, carried on by a much younger child of hi \u2014 much younger than\nmy mother\u2019s child, but that\u2019s a long family story that I don\u2019t think I have time to\nrelate. Well, anyway, they were both very prosperous. My father\u2019s family had \u2014\nNovember 6, 1997\nthere were two sisters and five brothers, seven. And my father, Oscar Politzer was\nthe youngest. My mother\u2019s family, there were two older sisters and one younger\nbrother. My mother\u2019s name was Marie, but she was all \u2014 always Mitzi, little Mitzi\nbecause she was tiny and very, very delicate. And all she really knew how to do was\nplay the piano. That was the thing to do. And both households had a cook and a\nmaid, and in my mother\u2019s family there was a mademoiselle that came several\nafternoons a week because you had to learn another language, absolutely. And my\nfather\u2019s family with the five boys especially, there was a sort of a tutor, another \u2014\nanother teacher who saw that homework was being done by these \u2014 by this big\nfamily. I \u2014 I think this 1s important to \u2014 to realize how very much entrenched this \u2014\nboth families were in Vienna. They were socially and financially very, very much\nViennese.",
        "A: My father was, I guess you\u2019d call it a businessman. He was supposed to \u2014 to,\nwith his brother-in-law, my mother\u2019s brother, take over the business from my\nmaternal grandfather, but things happened. Grandpa Berger was his name, was\nwidowed er \u2014 er \u2014 ma \u2014 at age 60, and remarried a much, much younger woman, to\nthe great distress of the children. And they had another child, and that other child, of\ncourse, was inheriting the business, instead of the son and son-in-law and that was\nNovember 6, 1997\nthat. So my father had \u2014 it\u2019s hard to \u2014 to translate it. He \u2014 he represented foreign\nfirms. He was a businessman, and business was not good. We\u2019re talking \u2014 my\nparents were married in 1914, beginning of the war. And the time between the wars\nwas economically very bad in Europe. So we had everything a child would need.\nAnd besides, you didn\u2019t talk business with your children. I was really not aware of\nwhat my father did. I wouldn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t care, but you just didn\u2019t discuss it with\nyour children.",
        "A: No, Mother did not work, and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s interesting, because she was a very, very\ntalented and very smart woman, but girls of this age in that level of society just\ndidn\u2019t work. There was \u2014 she played the piano very well, and I guess she knew how\nto cook, because she had to learn it. But then we always had a maid or somebody\nelse who cooked, so Mother didn\u2019t \u2014 I mean, she brought up my sister and me, but\nthat was about it.",

And there were always\nNovember 6, 1997\ntwo big pitchers of water standing nearby, because we always had one or two mine\n\u2014 little minor fir-fires. But that \u2014 that was it.",

        "A: You\u2019re asking me a question I really don\u2019t know how to answer, because I don\u2019t\nknow. Even though you hear a lot and read a lot about rising anti-Semitism, I was\nnot aware of it. I had friends \u2014 I had Jewish friends and I had, of course, the state\nreligion, so to speak, in Austria was Catholic. So most people were Catholics, but\nthere were some Protestants. And you just didn\u2019t pay too much attention to where\npeople went on Sundays, or if they went at all.\nNovember 6, 1997",

And after four years of elementary school, you had to\ndecide whether you wanted to go to an eight year gymnasium, which was high\nschool, or just four years of \u2014 which was called Hauptschule. Most of the time, if\nyou just didn\u2019t make very good grades, and couldn\u2019t really do very well, you went\nto Hauptschule. Or if there was no money at all \u2014 cause you did pay a little bit for\ngymnasium. And children went to Hauptschule if they wanted to follow a trade.\nIt\u2019s th-the sy \u2014 the school system 1s very ve \u2014 was very different and still is very\ndifferent from he \u2014 here in the U.S. I went to a eight year gymnasium, which was\nvery strict, very difficult and very, very cut and dry academic, I would say. And I\u2019m\n\u2014 I\u2019m glad I had the good education I had.",
        "A: From age five on, I danced. I was gonna be a dancer, and I was gonna have a\ndance studio, somewhere. And that was that, and the opportunities, of course, in\nVienna were tremendous. Our household was very much infused with music. We\nNovember 6, 1997\nhad a beautiful Bosendorfer. That\u2019s one of the big, big, beautiful pianos we had.\nMother played quite a bit. My sister had piano lessons, seemed forever. And Mother\ntried piano lessons for me, but I just couldn\u2019t sit still long enough. So I \u2014 I had \u2014\nMother was my teacher for about three years and then we both gave up, and I\u2019m\ntruly sorry I did, but I gave up. So I \u2014 I danced two, three afternoons a week. You\nknow, school was from about \u2014 well, em \u2014 elementary school it was from eight to\n12. Then in gymnasium you went to school every day from eight to one, and it c \u2014\nalso on Saturdays, so the \u2014 the dance classes came in the afternoon. And very early\nin life, I did a lot of performing. That was really what I \u2014 what I loved. One of my\nteachers was a-\u2014 one of the soloists at the Staatsoper, and she had a studio on the\nside, and was also often asked to choreograph for the Burgtheater, which was the\ndramatic stage \u2014 this dramatic, state supported stage. And there I had all sorts of\nopportunities. I got paid something, which amounts to nowadays probably for about\n10 cents. But at the time it was \u2014 it was great to have a little \u2014 little money to save,\nand I usually saved it up to go on a skiing trip, because that was the other \u2014 I would\nn\u2014 wouldn\u2019t know whether it was a hobby, but everybody skied, and we also\nskated. I\u2014 we had membership to one of the ice skating rinks. And then every year,\nthat was later on in gymnasium, the whole school, or those who couldn\u2019t ski well,\nthey had to stay home, went somewhere for a week, into one of the youth hostels in\nNovember 6, 1997\nthe Alps, and just looking back on it, this was probably the most beautiful, best\ntimes we ever had.",
        "A: Well, we spoke German, and although people from Berlin don\u2019t always want to\nadmit that Austrians speak German, it is Volksdeutsche. So that was the language\nwe \u2014 I had seven years of French in ha \u2014 in high school, in gymnasium, four years\nof Latin and about two or three years of English. So we \u2014 tha-that was very much \u2014\neverybody had to take languages. And French was really usually the first foreign\nlanguage. Now it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s English, but in those days it was always French was the\nfirst foreign language.",
        "A: No, not at all. At least that\u2019s the way it seemed to me. I have no way of \u2014 of\nknowing, but no, my answer would be no. I \u2014 my \u2014 my mother\u2019s brother George, he\nwas two or three years younger than my mother, was terribly proud of his World\nWar I record. He was in the cavalry, and it was hard to get into the cavalry. I don\u2019t\nknow whether you had to pay somebody to get in, or it was the uniform, that\nbeautiful red pants, red trousers and blue jacket that was expensive, but he was very\nproud to have been in the cavalry. And was wounded in World War I, he had a very\nNovember 6, 1997\nbadly crippled hand from \u2014 from a wound in World War I. And later on, after the\nwar was over, he joined a party called the Ligity-misten(ph). They were \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow whether it was a political party or just like an association, people who wanted\nto have the Habsburg \u2014 the Habsburgs back. And later on, when the Nazis\nmarched in, that was \u2014 was very bad. I\u2019ll come to that later.",
        "A: Not at all, not at all. Religion had \u2014 had absolutely nothing \u2014 no \u2014 no impact on\nme.",
        "A: No, I never did. And I \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, that I knew, but it was just something that was just sort of glossed over,\nI guess you would call it. It\u2019s hard to believe, but that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "A: Well, I think the relationship was close, yes, but close for these years, for \u2014 for\nthe \u2014 for the years in the \u2014 in the 20s. Probably not for now. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very close\nwith my daughter now, much closer than I ever was with my mother.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we fought, like all sisters do, but basically it was a friendship and\nwe're still very good friends.",
        "A: Well, I want to go back few \u2014 few years before that. We talked about the\nSoltsis(ph) and the Nazis. The Soltsis(ph) were the social democrats, and the Nazis\nwere \u2014 you know, the word Nazi comes from Nationalsozialistische Deutsche\nArbeiterpartei. So there was this talk, and of course children pick up things. So\nneither one was particularly good, but the social democrats were the leading party\nafter World War I. And I remember vaguely there was a kind of a \u2014 almost a little\nrevolution. I think it was about \u201927 - 1927. Maybe I\u2019m thinking of 1931, I\u2019m not\nsure. There was a big new building development where a lot of people could get\nvery low rent apartments, and they tried to have a little revolution against the\nsomewhat authoritarian Christian democrat \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 government at the time. So I\u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I was aware that there was something \u2014\nsomething going on. This was in \u201931. 1933, yes, we heard about Hitler, but that was\nNovember 6, 1997\nnext door. That was \u2014 that was far away. It\u2019s hard to believe this nowadays, but you\nknow, we didn\u2019t have television. We had just gotten a radio, and communications\njust weren\u2019t \u2014 and besides, I was 13 years old, I had too many other things I \u2014 I\nwanted to think about and do. So we \u2014 yes, we knew about Hitler, but that was\nabout it. Then things became more serious. In 1934, and I remember that very well,\nthat the Chancellor Dollfuss \u2014 I don\u2019t think one even knows the name here, was\nmurdered. He was the \u2014 the Austrian chancellor. And it was very obvious that the\nNazis from \u2014 the German Nazis were behind that terrible murder. It was in July, and\nI was on vacation at one of my aunt\u2019s villas on the lake. And we were very, very\nworried about what was really happening there. But then that calmed down.\nDollfuss successor was Kurt von Schuschnigg, and he was a very, very different\nkind of chancellor. I remember Chancellor Dollfuss, he was a very short man, he\nwas just five foot tall, and he was the butt of a lot of jokes. But he was a very\npopular man, he had a great deal of rapport with the \u2014 with the people. And the \u2014\nthis new man, von Schuschnigg was a kind of a college professor type. Very\nserious, seemingly not a whole lot of sense of humor, and he was also at the time,\nthe head of the Heimwehr. Heimwehr was sort of a militia type party, 1t was a\ndifferent party. It was somewhere between the Nazis and the Soltsis(ph). And a lot\nof the Heimwehr \u2014 Heimwehr people were aristocrats that at one time of course\nNovember 6, 1997\nwere for the return of the Habsburgs. So he definitely lacked popular appeal. And I\nthink he \u2014 he had absolutely no way of communicating with Hitler, he wasn\u2019t even\ntrying. And he was the wrong type to ever meet up with Hitler. This is \u2014 this was\n1934. The \u2014 1936, of course, was the year of the Olympics, which the museum so\nvery, very beautifully, I thought that was a marvelous decision, whoever made it, to\nhave that year show other Olympics, because I remember that very well. I was very\nmuch into athletics and of course we realized that Hitler used this as a tremendous\npropaganda tool, the \u2014 the Olympic games. And we were so, so taken by this\nbeautiful black man Jesse Owens. He was \u2014 but it was \u2014 it was very, very \u2014 there\nwere several Austrian competitors, one or two of them were Jewish, who were not\nallowed to participate the last moment. So it was a very, very strained. It started \u2014 it\nstarted to be very, very strained.",
        "A: No, this \u2014 this didn\u2019t really \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 I \u2014 it\u2019s funny that I have no \u2014 no\nfeeling, no \u2014 no memories that I said oh dear, you know, what\u2019s gonna happen? Just\nnot at all. This really didn\u2019t happen until after 1938. I had in s \u2014 in school, of course\nthere was a \u2014 we knew that there was an underground. The underground Nazi\nNovember 6, 1997\nmovement started when Schuschnigg came in because he \u2014 he did a lot of \u2014 lot of\nreally very, very awkward things. He tried to outlaw the National Socialist party in\nAustria, and that was the wrong thing to do. They went underground there. So right\n\u2014 right on my right side, we \u2014 we sat in \u2014 in \u2014 1n school, in sort of desks that were\nthree or four. The girl on my right side, I knew wore a little swastika on her lapel,\non the underside of her lapel. The girl on my left, her father was in the military, and\nhe was to be the Austrian attach\u00e9 in Berlin. So you know, I had a little bit of a\npolitical fallout there on \u2014 on either side of \u2014 but we were \u2014 we were friends. I think\nthe girl who wore the swastika on the \u2014 on the side of the lapel knew that I knew\nshe wore it. But that was alright, you know, it \u2014 and we also knew that there were\ncertain \u2014 certain professors, certain teachers who we knew were \u2014 were Nazis, but\nthey \u2014 they didn\u2019t make any \u2014 any difference, they didn\u2019t treat us any different. It\nwas \u2014 it was interesting. When I think back of it, there was very little of this polit \u2014\nit didn\u2019t come down to the youngsters, let\u2019s say, ti \u2014 our age group.",
        "A: Not at all. Not at all that I \u2014 that I can remember. Maybe there was, there\nprobably was, underground. But a teenager just didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. I\n\u2014I went to a very nice dance school. That\u2019s \u2014 when I say that, it\u2019s the social\nNovember 6, 1997\ndancing, the same \u2014 same school that my mother went to, and he\u2019s still there, the\nschool is still there, only not th \u2014 the man is long dead, but there you know, you\nwould have \u2014 would have said you \u2014 you \u2014 perhaps there were any \u2014 any differences\nwho could come into this class or that class. But I just don\u2019t remember that there\nwas any discrimination like this, I just truly don\u2019t.",
        "A: No, my father\u2019s work actually, I think he had some work with German firms, I\ndon\u2019t know what happened there. I \u2014 I really, as I said before, there was very little\nbusiness talk, and children were \u2014 it was just like \u2014 like not in front of the children\nkind of a \u2014 kind of an attitude, which seems strange, but that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the way, at\nleast in my family was the way.",
        "A: Not particularly. I think there were \u2014 there were signs that \u2014 that Hitler \u2014 it\nseems to me that \u2014 that Mr. Dollfuss and Mr. Schuschnigg were good friends with\nMussolini. That was of course on our south, you know, we were in between. And\nMussolini was \u2014 was very friendly to Austria and he \u2014 the way I \u2014 I read some of\nthe stuff now in retrospect, after almost 60 years, he tried to \u2014 to tell Hitler to stay\nNovember 6, 1997\nout of Austria, because I think he \u2014 he want \u2014 he was afraid of Hitler like\neverybody else. So when \u2014 when Hitler made moves to \u2014 which he did, to invite\nSchuschnigg to come to see him, Mussolini told him that he thought that was a\nmistake. And he also told Schuschnigg not to go. But I don\u2019t know what happened\nin 1937, but I know 1938, early 1938, January, February, Schuschnigg finally had\nto go to Berchtesgaden. And I remember that \u2014 that period very well, because I\nwas in my last year of high school. And there was a sort of an unwritten law, at least\nit was \u2014 my parents insisted that I didn\u2019t go to any of the big carnival\n[indecipherable] it was called, until I was a senior in high school. So this was my \u2014\nmy time to go to \u2014 to balls, and \u2014 and the political situation seemed so \u2014 so\nuncertain and so \u2014 it was so, so gray, and so, so unpleasant that I was afraid they\nwere all going to spoil my fun. But I did manage to go do some of the dances. But I\ndo remember the time that Schuschnigg went to Berchtesgaden, I remember that \u2014\nthat very well, because even though we only had radio, it was all given over the\nradio and there was also something called \u2014 here it was called March of Time, I\nthink. You went to the movies for just about 45 minutes, and you had the news\nthere. So we \u2014 we got a lot of that through \u2014 through these films. And there were\nreports of how, for about two hours Hitler just raved and ranted and would not take\n\u2014 accept anything that Schuschnigg suggested. And Schuschnigg at the time had a\nNovember 6, 1997\nminister \u2014 I don\u2019t know minister of what, but his name was Guido Schmidt, who\nwas really a Nazi. But he came with Schuschnigg and kind of egged him on and\nsay oh, come on, give in, make a few little \u2014 little allowances. But it was a totally \u2014\ntotal disaster, that meeting that he had with Hitler. He came home and if I\nremember right, I think 1t was a \u2014 it was a secret to the Austrian population that he\nwas actually there. I don\u2019t think we knew about it until he came back. And it was a\n\u2014 I mean, we were told that it was no good, and Schuschnigg suggested a plebiscite.\nAnd Hitler said absolutely not. But Schuschnigg did it anyway. And that truly was\nthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back because that was just \u2014 Hitler was just\nwaiting for \u2014 for an occasion. So on March 11\", he \u2014 his army crossed the border.\nAnd I remember that extremely well because I was at a dance rehearsal. See, by\nthen I was \u2014 I was 17 going on 18 and I really \u2014 I was very serious about my\ndancing and this was gonna be a production of Faust, second part of Faust, under\nMax Reinhardt, and that \u2014 of course he was the \u2014 the \u2014 the god of the theater at the\ntime. And this was Friday evening and the rehearsal was called off. And of course\nthat whole thing was called off because Reinhardt was one of the first that crossed\nthe border; he was smart, he left, Friday the 11. And then Saturday the Luftwaffe\nflew over Vienna and Sunday the 13\", Hitler came in. And I will never forget that,\nbecause even though we were told not to go da \u2014 out on the street, of course we \u2014\nNovember 6, 1997\nwe young people wanted to see, no matter \u2014 whether we\u2019re for or against, but you \u2014\nyou wanted to see, and this Sunday night, I had tickets to go to the opera. I had a\u2014a\nboyfriend at the time who was in his one year of army duty, military duty, and he\nhad cheap tickets, or free tickets, probably. Well, you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t cross\nthe street in front of the opera, I mean th \u2014 the ring \u2014 there\u2019s the \u2014 there\u2019s a big\navenue that goes around the old town, called the ring. And all along the ring are the\nbeautiful buildings, like the opera, and the \u2014 the parliament, and the university and\nthe Burgtheater and all that. Well, people stood 10 deep to see the parade, so we\nnever made it to the opera. In fact, at the opera, people were hanging out fo \u2014 of the\nwindows, and it was sort of stormed by the \u2014 by the people who wanted to see the\nparade, and of course, Hitler himself, he was standing up in car with his right\nhanded lifted, and so forth. So it was rather \u2014 rather impossible thing to erase out of\nyour head, the noise \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know whether we thought that we \u2014 we had heard that the\nlast few years, Jews really had a hard time in Germany. Their businesses were\neither closed, or they were not allowed to do this and that. But people still \u2014 still had\nNovember 6, 1997\na life in Germany. It wasn\u2019t the \u2014 the horror \u2014 the Holocaust really didn\u2019t start until\nseveral years later. So we figured well, Austria \u2014 because we always \u2014 the\nAustrians always felt oh, it won\u2019t happen here, you know, that\u2019s the Austrian\ntemperament. But I don\u2019t know whether \u2014 whether I \u2014 I was very busy trying to\nfinish high school. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s my feeling now, but I don\u2019t know at the time. I\nthink my parents were \u2014 were terribly undone by it. But they too felt, oh well, yes,\nthe kids should probably leave, but we\u2019ll somehow stick it out. It was that attitude.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I s \u2014 I\u2014 I was told to stay home, and everybody stayed home,\nbecause it was \u2014 by then you really had the feeling \u2014 see we \u2014 we thought that there\nwas gonna be a fight. We thought there was gonna be a war. We had a small\nAustrian army, but I think they were totally overwhelmed by the thought of the \u2014 of\nthe German army and the Luftwaffe, so that they decided well, we better not have a\nbloodbath. I think that was the idea. So one stayed home.",
        "A: From a distance.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t have school for a week. You know how kids are. And it was my\nbirthday. And that was the birthday I don\u2019t remember, because I think everybody\nelse forgot about it. It was very, very \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know. It was a \u2014 it was a in\nlimbo kind of a thing. There was a lot of \u2014 lot of parades, lot of oh, you have to join\nthe Hitler youth. But of course, you know, we wouldn\u2019t. We wouldn\u2019t even think\nabout it. It was a very \u2014",
        "A: Well, because, first of all I\u2014 you \u2014 you had to declare that you had eight Gentile\n\u2014 Aryan it was called \u2014 grandparents. And then I know a lot of people who did not\njoin the Hitler youth. You didn\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t have to. You were told you had to,\nbut if you didn\u2019t join, you had to explain why. So it was a \u2014 I think that was\nprobably the first feeling of oh, we better have \u2014 we have to leave. If you \u2014 if you\nnot part of the Hitler youth, you couldn\u2019t do anything. So I can\u2019t really answer that\nquestion, I don\u2019t know what I felt. As I said, I was busy. End of \u2014 end of high\nschool was a very \u2014 it was very difficult. There was something called Matura\nwhich was oral and written exams, very difficult. It was a sort of a summary of your\n\u2014 your high school years, and we had to study hard. So we still were going to finish\nthis. So that week of vacation, which I guess it was, I don\u2019t know just exactly what I\ndid. I\u2014 I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t tell you.\nNovember 6, 1997\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I did. The \u2014 I \u2014I still saw my friends. I sa-sat next to the girl\nwho now wore the swastika on the outside of her lapel. And school continued. This\nwas March, we were going to have our Matura, that\u2019s those orals and written\nexams in June. We had to work hard. One of our favorite professors was gone. She\nwas the German literature lady. She was Jewish, so she had to go. We had a \u2014",
        "A: Well, you better not react it, because if you expressed yourself to somebody, you\nwere not certain what that other person \u2014 how that other person would react, and\nperhaps tell somebody that Hedi said such and such, and then that could hurt my\nfamily.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Well, we were told that you \u2014 right after March 13\", there were quite a few\npeople who quickly disappeared. We weren\u2019t sure just where to. Some of them\nvoluntarily just left. Some of them left with a passport, some of them without.\nOthers were taken to concentration camps. This was \u2014 this was rather \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014\nyou realized very soon that things have changed and you had to be careful. Careful\nis the word. So you just accepted it. We had somebody else take her place. The\nprincipal was replaced, because he was part \u2014 he was high up in the Heimwehr; that\nwas the patriotic front, or whatever you want to call it. And he was replaced by,\ninteresting enough, one of the regular teachers who everybody knew that he \u2014 she\nwas in the underground Nazi party. So that\u2019s \u2014 those were the changes that took\nplace. Also, as we came in after that one week of vacation, we saw a picture of\nHitler in the classroom, all the classrooms had pictures of Hitler. And every class\nstarted, you know, different teacher comes in and we had to stand up and say heil\nHitler.",
        "A: Yes, of course. And that\u2019s another question I always get, and I feel like oh dear,\nwhat kind of a characterless person? But you know, I wouldn\u2019t be here if I would\nnot have raised my right arm.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, we discussed it. And the \u2014 the idea was to \u2014 oh yes, you children,\nyou just must go, and for me it was a perfect time to leave or do something else. I\nwas possibly gonna go to university, I don\u2019t know what I was gonna do after\nMatura. So we started corresponding with two cousins we had in the U.S.",
        "A: Well, it made you mad. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know what else to say, I \u2014 because if \u2014 if you\nsaid some \u2014 again, I have to repeat, if you \u2014 1f you said something against it, or if\nyou s \u2014I don\u2019t know, people spit on it or some, they were immediately taken away.\nI mean, it was wi \u2014 life was dangerous. And I think our parents probably told us to,\nwhen we go out, be careful. And if somebody comes towards you and \u2014 and a\nperfect stranger says heil Hitler, you\u2019d better say heil Hitler back.",
        "A: No, not at all. I think partially because it was \u2014 I was very blonde and blue eyed.",

        "A: Of what?",
        "A: No, no, not at all. No, we knew of \u2014 of Hitler and Goebbels and Goering and\nHimmler. Eichmann [| \u2014 I \u2014 we \u2014 that name, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know until they were\nlooking for him in Argentina, | think. No.",
        "A: We had \u2014 we had cousins who had come to Newark, or to the une \u2014 the U.S. and\nsettled in Newark. There were two women, there was cousins on my father\u2019s side, a\ngood bit older than we were, very independent ladies. One of them \u2014 this \u2014 I\u2019m\ntalking about the 20s \u2014 got a doctorate at Heidelberg. Now that was very, very\nprogressive. The other one was a x-ray technician. She went to Sweden. She just\nhad had it with Austria, so she up and went to Sweden. And then the \u2014 the one who\n\u2014 th-the one who went to Sweden then went to the U.S. This was about 1936 or\n1937. She was just a very adventurous person. The other one, with a doctorate from\nHeidelberg, got married and had a young child, and followed her sister. She \u2014 this\nwoman with \u2014 then divorced, followed her sister to Newark, New Jersey, and the\nNovember 6, 1997\ntwo of them eked out a living, so to speak, in Newark, New Jersey. And when we\nwrote to them, they said, by all means come.",
        "A: Oh, I imagine was probably June, July, somewhere there. Not really sure just\nwhen. One thing we did right away, and it was a \u2014 it was a network kind of a thing.\nEverybody went to the United States embassy and got a quota number. We had no\nidea what it was, but everybody should have one. In order to \u2014 to emigrate, you had\nto have a quota number; quotas being very different by countries. And the Austrian\nquota was very good, meaning the U.S. didn\u2019t mind Austrians coming in. But the\nItalian quota was not very good, and God forbid if you were born in Hungary, they\nwanted \u2014 like two people a year they accepted. Was a very interesting thing because\nI don\u2019t know whether this is still that way, but you \u2014 you needed a quota number.\nAnd if you wanted to know, you know, how many a month, they didn\u2019t really tell\nyou at the embassy. But I remember at the time they said oh well, your number\nshould come up around the first of the year. So this was, you know, a\u2014 738, so\nmaybe by \u201939 we could \u2014 we could think of it. But I remember very well just stand\nin line at the U.S. embassy in Vienna and get a quota number.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Yes, yes, we saw that, but to the extent of \u2014 not yet. This \u2014 this was to come, but\nnot \u2014 not yet. Quite a few business people, what happened is they perhaps \u2014 if they\nhad an employee who was Aryan that they could trust, kind of put it into his/her\nhands, and that way protected themselves. There were a lot of ways of \u2014 of getting\naround that. Then they needed doctors badly at the time, so the Jewish doctors could\nstay because they were needed. So there was a lot of case by case, it was this \u2014 this\nsort of thing.",
        "A: No, \u2019m\u2014 I\u2019m \u2014I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was probably true, but I was \u2014 I was\nnot aware of that.",
        "A: All right, we g \u2014 w-we graduated and that was kind of interesting. There were so\nmany parades going on, and so many \u2014 so many different things that we did not\nhave to go through the orals. And that\u2019s unbelievable, I mean, if \u2014 if \u2014 if I can say\nthere\u2019s one \u2014 one good thing came out of it, that I didn\u2019t have orals for my Matura.\nNovember 6, 1997\nThat the written exams were in \u2014 in mathematics, and Latin, literature and French, I\nthink. And they were, you know, five hour exams. You \u2014 you got a\u2014 got a \u2014 a title,\na theme, and you had to \u2014 to write a paper on it. So they \u2014 we had to go through\nthat, but the orals \u2014 and then that was such a relief, 1t was wonderful. And we had a\n\u2014 there was a tradition of having a Matura fire. And that meant you went to a\nrestaurant, and met one more time all the \u2014 all the peop \u2014 this was an all girls\u2019\nschool, so there were about 30 of us. And I guess you call it a roast here, but one of\n\u2014 one or two of them wrote a newspaper about it, and said the most awful things\nabout their teachers. But 1t was you \u2014 it was a totally, totally good affair, with \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t have guessed what was going on around \u2014 around us. This was in June\nthen, at the end.",

        "A: I\u2014 my father was a little bit more forward looking than my mother. She, I don\u2019t\nthink, could imagine herself leaving Vienna.

And actually\nthe \u2014 the line of \u2014 of pre \u2014 representations he had with other firms was in the line of\nbathroom fixtures and that sort of thing, plumbing type of thing. So he \u2014 he took \u2014\nhe took courses in that. And of course his \u2014 his business more or less came to a\nstandstill, and I \u2014 I to this day wonder how we could afford the rent, and the food,\nreally.

There was a \u2014 a new\nthing too, the quota and affidavit we had, those were new words in our vocabulary.\nAnd these two ladies did not have enough money to \u2014 didn\u2019t earn enough to \u2014 to\nsay, we'll take care of these.

And they\nimmediately answered, says yes, by all means, we\u2019ll let you have an affidavit.

Which makes sense, I guess.

        "A: I don\u2019t think it really hit me until just \u2014 just before.

I guess it was the family\u2019s house was searched,\nbecause one of his brothers was a member of the heim \u2014 Heimwehr. They were not\n\u2014 they were not Jewish. And he just up and left. And he told my sister, but he tell \u2014\nhe didn\u2019t tell me. So I was very undone. This was in August, I think. And \u2014 so that \u2014\nthat was kind of sad. And then some of my \u2014 my \u2014 the girlf \u2014 my girlfriends left.\nOne of them left for Sweden, and I still correspond with her, and her grandson\ncame to see me about a month ago. So I\u2014 I keep in touch with people, and another\none I went to school with left for England. And she wanted to come to the U.S., but\ndidn\u2019t have her affidavit yet.

        "A: Well, what I \u2014 what I saw before it hit our family, I remember one thing that \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know what I was doing downtown. Right in the center of the city there was a\n\u2014I don\u2019t know he \u2014 whether he was the rabbi, or he was \u2014 he was just somebody\nwith \u2014 threw a robe and a little yarmulke on his head, and two or three guys went\njust after him with \u2014 with a whip, you know.

You \u2014 you \u2014 you felt you should protect the poor\nman, but then again, if you did, then you got the whip. So it was this sort of thing all\nthe time. So that\u2019s what I saw, and then, as I said before, my father took classes. I\ndon\u2019t know whether this was plumbing, or English, or whatever it was he took, and\nhe just didn\u2019t come home on \u2014 on \u2014 we always call it November 10\", because that\nwas when it \u2014 when things were really \u2014 in Vienna were really unleashed. And we\nnever saw him again. And that was \u2014 that was rough. No phone call, no anything.\nSomebody called a few days later saying I bring regards and he\u2019s fine, and hung up.\nWell, 1t was somebody who was let out apparently, for some reason or other. And\nmuch, much later, not too long ago in fact, I read a description of what happened to\npeople. They herded them to one of the military installations in Vienna and they\nmade them stand up for 24 hours, and then \u2014 no \u2014 no water, no food, and then took\nthem to the train stations. It was November, it was very cold. And the next thing\nthey knew, they were in Dachau. And I\u2019ve \u2014 I read a lot about it because my\nmother never \u2014 never really heard, and I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t, that there was quite a bit\nof torture going on, and horrible things. And what puzzles me very much, because\nmy father had been in the war. He was in World War I. He was not a hero or\nanything, but he had served in the military. He was only 52 years old, not quite. He\nNovember 6, 1997\ngot to be 52 in January. And people got out. If you could prove that you \u2014 that you \u2014\nthat you gonna be out of the country within two weeks or something like that. And\nwe \u2014 we moved heaven and earth. We had a nephew of my father\u2019s, a cousin of\nmine, who had been in Israel by the \u2014 at that time. He was a rabid Zionist and he\nhad gone before things happened. And he \u2014 I think we telegrammed, and \u2014 and he\nsomehow found a way, and we, you know, let them know that my father will be out,\nbut nothing happened. And the \u2014 we have \u2014 I can show you that later, we have com-\ncommunications. We have the correspondence of my father. I think after about two\nweeks we had a card saying I\u2019m fine, don\u2019t worry, you know? And we got about\nevery other week, or something like this. I have donated the correspondence to the \u2014\nto the Holocaust Museum, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re gonna do with it. I made\ncopies though, so I have it right here, I can let you have it. And on it, it says you\nhave to have only so and so many lines, and be sure and date it, and I don\u2019t know\nwhat else, I mean you \u2014 you were really \u2014 you \u2014 you basically had to tell your\nfamily that you were fine, that \u2014 that was the thing. So that was it, and this was\nJanuary \u2014 November, December. Our date of departure was 11\" of January, which\nwas my father\u2019s birthday, and we were so hoping that we \u2014 that he could get out and\nwe could see him. And he \u2014 again and again wrote don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t change your plans.\nDon\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t do it, so we wa \u2014 which we didn\u2019t.

Some people rang the bell and said we \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether they\nsaid they want to inspect the apartment or what it is, but they totally, totally\nvandalized, like breaking Dresden figures. Cutting open feather pillows and going\nall over the place, and cutting nice upholstery. I mean, it was just something you \u2014\nyou, in your worst nightmares. So she wanted me to see that. And I mean, things\nlike that. Or so and so\u2019s father was \u2014 didn\u2019t come home, or so and so left, on \u2014 of\ncourse, we had a story to tell too, but you were told to be very careful and \u2014 and not\n\u2014not talk about it, which is hard to do. You were really very dependent on your\nconcierge. You don\u2019t call it concierge in Vienna, you call it housemaster in Vienna.\nNovember 6, 1997\nBut we had a \u2014a family, they \u2014 you know, they live sort of on the \u2014 on the \u2014 as you\ncome in.

And then this \u2014 then they were thrown out\nof there, I\u2019m not sure what happened, but they ended up in Palestine, and were\nprotected by the Anglican church. And my cousin, the young boy who was eight\nyears old, is a very well-known university professor, Boston University. The \u2014 the\nman in sociology. So, you know, s-some \u2014 but I remember we ma \u2014 my mother and\nmy sister and I packed up their stuff after they were gone, you know, they had to \u2014\nto get out in one week. And we \u2014 we packed up their belongings and \u2014 and sent\nthem to I don\u2019t know where, but they \u2014 they never caught up with them, so they \u2014\nthey had nothing.",

And some \u2014 some of them were\nvery unlikely. But very soon \u2014 my \u2014 my sister very soon found a job with a family\nto take care of some children. And I was determined I was gonna dance. And I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t find anything right away. And of course, within a week, we got a\nletter from our s \u2014 our mother that our father had died. Which meant of course,\neverything just \u2014 just kind of fell apart there for a few days, and oh, our cousins\nwere wonderful. But we had to pick ourselves up. As I said before, we he \u2014 we each\nhad 40 dollars. And it\u2019s amazing how far 40 dollars went in 1939. So we \u2014",
        "A: We landed on the 23\" \u2014 or was it 25\"\"? I think it was the 25\" of January. I always\nget mixed up between the landing and my father\u2019s death. I think his \u2014 he died on the\n23\" of January, and I think we landed on the 25\", something like that. So it was \u2014 it\nwas very cold in Newark, New Jersey and we started going into New York, which\nmeant you had a little s \u2014 little streetcar ride that cost 10 cents. Then you did the\nNovember 6, 1997\nHudson tubes, which cost a nickel. And then you had the subway, another nickel.\nSo there went, if 1t\u2019s a round trip, 40 cents went for transportation. And of course, if\nyou were in New York and you were a whole day, you had to have lunch. So at\nNiddick\u2019s(ph) you could get a na \u2014 a frankfurt for four or five cents, and an orange\ndrink for five cents. And if you were still hungry you could get a cream cheese and\nnut bread for five cents. So for, let\u2019s see, 40 cents fare and 15 cents, that\u2019s pretty\ngood. You still didn\u2019t have to pay more than 55 cents for the day. So those 40\ndollars went for \u2014 for quite some time, and everything else, our cousins were\nbeautiful about it, and took care of us. My sister, as I said, then she gave up the \u2014\nthe job of taking care of children, and she at the time, of course, had \u2014 knew\nshorthand and typing and she was fluent in French. Her English was better than\nmine. So she found some secretarial work very quickly. And I got in touch with\nsomebody who had \u2014 who was the pianist for one of my dance teachers. He was in\nNew York and I looked him up. He was also the nephew of somebody we knew, so\nit was almost like a friend. And he says well, he said, it just so happens that I got\ntogether with somebody from one of the cabarets in Vienna and they\u2019re forming a\nnew group, and they found some sponsors, and maybe they can use a dancer. And I\ngot in touch with this person who was \u2014 whose name was Herbert Berghof and he\nwas very well known actor in Vienna, and I did my little twirling around with my\nNovember 6, 1997\ndance dress, and I had a record on the record player. And he says, well, I think\nmaybe we can use you. And they had just started rehearsal \u2014 this was in February \u2014\nand we got rehearsal pay, 15 dollars a week. Now that\u2019s \u2014 that was good. That was\nvery good. So I started rehearsing with this group. It was an interesting group, they\nwere something called fromme a kleine kunst Buhne, which literally translated\nmeans small stage theater. It was a \u2014 sort of a topical review that had been very\nsuccessful in Vienna. And they got out quickly, because it was the kind of a topical\nreview that made fun of politics, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they better \u2014 had to get out. So\nthey met again in vien \u2014 in New York with Herbert Berghof as a director, and they\nhad sponsors, a list of sponsors that you wouldn\u2019t believe. George S. Kaufman and\nhis wife, Irving Berlin, Edna Ferber, down the list. They all \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I have no\nidea how much money they \u2014 they gave, but it was a little corporation that was\nformed, called itself the refugee artists\u2019 group. And they got a theater and we\nopened a show in June 1939. And for \u2014 as I said, rehearsal pay was 15 dollars a\nweek, and then when we opened, we got 40 dollars a week, which was the\nminimum that actors\u2019 equity paid. And you know, all the other refugees made\nanywhere from 12 dollars, 15 dollars, 20 dollars, but nobody made 40 dollars a\nweek. So I really thought I had it made. This was summer 1939, it was terribly hot.\nThere were all but four theaters opened on Broadway because they were the only\nNovember 6, 1997\nfour that had air conditioning. And the music box, where I was doing my thing, was\none of them. It was just a glorious two month. And interestingly enough, for some\nreason or other, some time before I got in with that group and knew that it was\nreally gonna do something, I had applied for college scholarships. That was another\naddress I had, to be sure and go to the international students\u2019 service, and apply for\na scholarship. Of course, I did really not know what a scholarship was and I really\ndidn\u2019t terribly want to go to college because I had done my Matura and I was not\nthat brilliant a student. So I had applied anyway, and the woman there didn\u2019t speak\nGerman. I \u2014 my English was very broken, so we got along just fine and \u2014 and she\nsaid, well, you might hear from us. And sometime in August I got a beautiful letter\nfrom International Student Service that said, we have scholarship for you at Miami\nUniversity in Oxford, Ohio. And I just had totally forgotten that I had ever applied.\nAnd I was so happy performing on Broadway, I really didn\u2019t want to do it. And\nthere was some friends \u2014 friends of my cousin\u2019s, wonderful woman who lived in\nNew York, who was in radio and the arts, says, you\u2019d be a darn fool if you\nwouldn\u2019t take this. Said, I don\u2019t want to. She said, well, you better. And of course,\nwar clouds over Europe, very, very obvious things were going to \u2014 to be really bra\n\u2014 breaking there very quickly. And this show had very good critiques, but somehow\nNovember 6, 1997\nwe being refugees and foreigners, with the war breaking out, 1t was all a bad\nsituation. We had to be fingerprinted because we were enemy aliens. So \u2014",
        "A: No, no. Some \u2014 some were, some were not. And so I reluctantly said to Herbert,\nyou know, I\u2019m going to go to coll \u2014 Herbert was the director \u2014 I was gonna have a\nscholarship. He says oh, I hate to lose you. I said, well, what do you think of the\nshow\u201d? He says well, it may just fold. And it did. And I want off to Miami\nUniversity, Oxford, Ohio. So that was one of those decisions that I did the right\nthing. At the time it was \u2014 it was very difficult, and I had to leave New York where\nmy sister was, and I was suddenly thrown into a totally, totally different\nenvironment. It was a good thing. And I think from then on in, I realized that there\u2019s\nmore to it than just staying in New York and being surrounded by nothing but\nrefugees. And it was a \u2014 it was a good \u2014 it was the best decision I ever made.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m gonna write a book about that some time. In fact, at my f\u2014 my 50\"\nreunion at Miami University, I was asked to give a speech, and it was mostly on\nAm-Americanization. And Miami University was a good place to \u2014 to get it. I think\nsome of them thought I was from the moon, and they \u2014 they \u2014 you know, Austria\nand Australia, and Vienna and Venice. I mean, it was all very confusing and what\nNovember 6, 1997\ndid you speak, what language did you speak? And I couldn\u2019t believe it. I got \u2014 I\nwent to the \u2014 the registrar didn\u2019t really know what to do with me, or whoever says\nwhether I\u2019m a freshman or a sophomore. He said, well, we\u2019ll see. I brought my \u2014\nmy report cards, but you know, they were all in German. So I guess I got\nsophomore status right away. And I said, yes, but I just want to dance, I don\u2019t want\nto play basketball. Well, I had to take all these things, cause I was a physical edu \u2014\nphysical education major. And the faculty was just wonderful. I mean, I can\u2019t \u2014 I\ncan\u2019t say enough of the \u2014 the kindness that \u2014 that was extended to me. The students\nwere kind of strange. I think they re \u2014 really didn\u2019t know \u2014 I was dating some, but\nvery little, because my English wasn\u2019t good enough, and I think it was too much\nwork to go out with somebody who didn\u2019t speak the language.",
        "A: Yes, there was a \u2014 a \u2014 there was an Italian boy, young man from Rose(ph), but\nhe was Italian, for some reason or other. And there was a Hungarian and a German\n\u2014 two German girls, and a whole group of Indonesians. And their English was \u2014 was\nnonexistent, so I don\u2019t know how they got along. But I had \u2014 I just \u2014 the faculty was\njust wonderful, because I\u2019d had to take freshman English, and this woman sat down\nwith me, and you know, corrected, and taught me, pronounced and so forth. I \u2014 I\nimmediately got a part in a play because the word got out that I\u2019d been on\nNovember 6, 1997\nBroadway, you know, that was \u2014 so \u2014 so this \u2014 this marvelous man, who was a\nwell-known Shakespeare scholar of all things, gave me a part in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in\n\u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d and sat down with me and worked on pronunciation. So there\nwere all these wonderful things that happened, and I \u2014 my grades were strange in\nthe first semester, but my English was \u2014 by Christmas my English was a hundred\npercent better, and I graduated with a B.S. in 1942.",
        "A: Okay, let\u2019s see, this was f-fall ni \u2014 fall 1939, I went to \u2014 to Miami and I\nremember there was a minis \u2014 one of the \u2014 I think it was a Presbyterian minister, I\ndon\u2019t know how I got to him. Well I \u2014 I had really wanted to join a church, I needed\nsomething, especially with \u2014 with my father having died, it was just this \u2014 1t was \u2014 I\nwas totally undone. So I got to \u2014 to talk to somebody from one of the churches and\nsaid that I\u2019d like to help my mother come over here. And they were actually ready\nto help, but then Mother got affidavits from the same two men, and the uncle and\naunt got \u2014 there was a distant cousin in Illinois. So they got over here, they came\nover here together in April 1940. And very difficult for them. My mother was 52.\nHer sister was a good bit older, like 59 or something, 60, and Uncle was about in his\nearly 60s, and he was a \u2014 a\u2014 a big man back in Vienna. And even though he had a\nlittle money that he managed to bring out, illegally of course, but still out, he had to\nNovember 6, 1997\ntake some insignificant little position doing something. And they eked out a living\nfor a few years, yeah. Mother came down here with me after a few years and \u2014 and\nspent her last years with \u2014 with me, with her grandchildren.",

I have the feeling the churches turned to me. | think they \u2014 they\nfelt they wanted to do something for me. I \u2014 I really think it was that way. I just\ndon\u2019t know. It\u2019s a good question, that I will ponder, but I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how\nto \u2014 how to answer that, mm-hm.",

I was \u2014 I was not brought up with, you\nknow, going to temple and doing this every Friday night and the big holidays, so \u2014\nso what good did it do me? It \u2014 1t \u2014 it \u2014 it was terrible, what it did to me. I \u2014 I really\nthink that was my \u2014 that was my attitude.\nNovember 6, 1997",

        "A: Well, I \u2014 you know, I think we all felt well, finally there\u2019s gonna be a war, you\nknow? And of course, we were waiting from \u2014 I think it was a great disappointment\nthat America didn\u2019t do more. In fact, that \u2014 this is something I remember. When we\nwere \u2014 when Hitler marched int \u2014 in March \u201938, what did President Roosevelt say?\nWha \u2014 why doesn\u2019t he? Because we had great respect for the \u2014 for the president.\nHelp is gonna come from there, you know, that was the promised land. And that\nwas a great disappointment. Now, I was old enough to understand that, at the time.\nAnd then you came over here, and there were some strange things. There was a\nFather Coughlin(ph), this isolationists. And by then we were old enough to\nunderstand. And I remember at Miami University there was a lot of this \u2014 this\nisolationists, like they didn\u2019t know what language I spoke, and so forth. You know,\nit was f-from \u2014 from another world. I think this was an eye opener. And I don\u2019t\nknow what my reaction to war was. I think if \u2014 I think we were terribly scared. I\nwas at the time scared that my mother wasn\u2019t going to make it out. And I think it\nwas the last Dutch boat that came \u2014 that left Rotterdam in April. And I also\nNovember 6, 1997\nremember that one of my best friends \u2014 but this already happened in summer \u201939,\nshe came over, I knew she was on the Bremen, and that was one of the ships that \u2014\nI think 1t was the Bremen \u2014 the news was turned around, it was going back. And I\nsaid, oh my word, Charlotte is on it. Well, they turned back again and she \u2014 she\nlanded. But it was \u2014 it was those \u2014 those things. So I think it was f-finally it was\ngonna do something. And \u2014 and also maybe, just maybe Americans were gonna be\npulled in. But of course they weren\u2019t until they had to. Which is a \u2014 which 1s all \u2014\nwhich I can understand. I can understand it now better than I did then.",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I-I graduated in \u2014 in 1942, and during the summers during those\nyears, I had camp jobs. I was a camp \u2014 camp counselor, because my \u2014 my field was,\nwell, as I said, physical education, but I still did the dance as a kind of a major. And\nat one of the \u2014 one of the summer camps, the head counselor was a faculty member\nat Wellesley. And she asked me what I was gonna do when I graduated from\nMiami, and I said well, I guess Pll teach phys ed in some school. She says oh, go\non, go on with it. I'll what I can do for you to get you a scholarship to Wellesley,\nand by golly, she did. And I \u2014 from Miami University, I went to Wellesley on a full\nscholarship and got a Master\u2019s degree there in \u201943.

I\ntook a job somewhere in a public library in New York. My mother was here by\nNovember 6, 1997\nthen, of course. And in \u201943, I graduated and \u2014 \u201943 \u2014 of course, the war was very\nmuch on, and accepted a job. I had \u2014 yeah, I had th \u2014 some choices, but \u2014 and I\nreally wanted to \u2014 to \u2014 my mother, of course, very desperately wanted me to stay in\nNew York, but nothing came through in New York.

Somehow we \u2014 we \u2014\nwe got a little place in Adams Morgan, and I immediately found a teaching\nposition which \u2014 which was called Marjorie Webster Junior College. I taught\ndance for two years, until our daughter was born in \u201947. We moved into Fairlington\nApartments, stayed there for four years until we built this house, 1400 Questo(ph)\nDrive. I did what I said I was gonna do when I was 10 years old, I was gonna have a\ndance school, and I did it in Alexandria, Virginia. I opened it in 1947, and it was a\n\u2014 was a really flourishing business. I\u2019m very proud to say that I had as many as 250\nstudents. I taught afternoons, of course, children had to come after school. I did all\nsorts of benefits and \u2014 and performances. I carried on until about 1980. I was\nsomewhat burned out by then, and one of my former students took over briefly,\nonly she didn\u2019t try to \u2014 she \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to work that hard. And it\u2019s finally\nNovember 6, 1997\nclosed, I\u2019m not sure just when, 1985, I think. We had a \u2014 a \u2014 a professional group,\ndance group attached to it, but that \u2014 that really depended on funding and things\nbecame just too difficult. So ?ve been very happily retired since about 1980.",

I\u2019m more aware of what \u2014 what awful\nthings can happen, and I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not glad that things\nhappened the way they happened, but I \u2014 it has certainly \u2014 certainly widened my\nhorizon, if that\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s an understatement, I think. Yeah, I think things could be\nvery different, very different. I can see it now. We go to Austria often. I have good\nfriends there, I went back to my 50\" high school reunion, and I stayed with a former\nclassmate who was m \u2014 first time married to a pilot in the Luftwaffe. And she\ninvited me. And I think it was almost \u2014 th-the invitation wi \u2014 to me was almost like\nNovember 6, 1997\na peace offering, it was wonderful. She \u2014 she just was as sweet and nice as you can\nbe. And I heard a lot of stories that what happened to people who stayed over there.\nAnd some of the experiences were worse than mine.",

Of course, I th \u2014 I think of \u2014 in fact, I\nthink of it all the time and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to \u2014 to \u2014 to not \u2014 not be bitter. Ma\n\u2014 my mother lived with us for 10 years and she naturally, understandably was very\nbitter. And she could \u2014 she could not enjoy the things she should have enjoyed, like\na \u2014 two cute little grandchildren here. And my husband was very good to her. My\nhusband is Gentile. So she was bitter. I\u2014 I am not bitter, and \u2014 and I don\u2019t think I\never will be.

        "A: Well, there was an awful lot in the paper about the Holocaust Museum. And\ninitially, maybe when it was first chartered, which I think was in 70 \u2014 1978 under\nJimmy Carter, I said to myself, what do we need a museum right here in\nWashington for? I \u2014 really, this was my reaction. Which 1s strange, but \u2014 but that\nwas it. I said, people are not gonna understand it. Which, you know, I had exp \u2014\nexperience with that, and that\u2019s why I never really \u2014 I never really talked about my\nexperiences to anybody. My children didn\u2019t know about \u2014 about their grandfather\nuntil they were grown, because I had the feeling that was \u2014 was \u2014 I couldn\u2019t do it, I\ndon\u2019t know. It\u2019s strange, but it\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the way it was. So I had the feeling wha-\nwhat\u2019s this \u2014 what\u2019s this museum gonna do here? And then 1-1t was built. Of course,\nyou saw the picture of the \u2014 the railroad car coming into the museum, and all that, it\ngot be kind of exciting. So when it \u2014 when it opened, and there was a little item in\nthe paper about volunteers are \u2014 are being searched for, I \u2014 I applied. And I think\nthe first visit was \u2014 1s quite overwhelming. And I \u2014 I remember my sister and some\nother people said, how can you do that, how can you do that? And I still have a very\ngood friend who was \u2014 was married to a German, and she said, I don\u2019t want to go\nthere, I can\u2019t go there. Different people react differently. I\u2014 1\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say I\nenjoyed it, but 1t was \u2014 to me it was wonderful that this was done.",
        "A: I\u2014I-\u2014TI think I was in the second group of volunteers. It opened in April 793. I\ndidn\u2019t start working until October/November \u201993. So \u2014",

The \u2014 the usual, you know,\nanswering questions in the information desk, giving the little spiel at the elevator,\ntearing tickets and just \u2014 just generally. I\u2014 I wish sometimes that the work would be\nmore intelligent, but then, if they need the menial tasks, that\u2019s all right too.",

This is \u2014\nthis 1s \u2014 and the bookstore, I think, in that museum, is wonderful. I \u2014 I \u2014 I buy all the\ntime, and I \u2014 I feel as though this 1s a \u2014 this is very important work. Very important.\nI had a chance to \u2014 to do some of the Fanny Mae tours, but I truly felt that the\nchildren who are led in small groups had no idea what this was all about; they were\nNovember 6, 1997\nnot prepared. I think it\u2019s been corrected now, and they only take the little older\nones, and prepare them better. I \u2014 I love to give a little briefing to th-the group\nthere. But I la\u2014I like my duty at the group desk best, because there yo \u2014 I have the\nfeeling I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m dealing with \u2014 with people, and I \u2014 I love these little older\nteenagers, juniors or seniors in high school. And give them the briefing and tell\nthem about no eat or drink and that sort of thing. And then I very briefly mention\nthat when you go on the fourth floor now and you see the takeover for Austria, you\nthink of somebody who\u2019s been there, and their mouth just drop open.",

It\u2019s \u2014 I think it makes it very believable to \u2014 to that particular\ngroup, and I can tell, because then they get on the elevator and \u2014 and they say thank\nyou, thank you so much and that sort of thing.

I have to say the same\nabout all the nice young people who are employed, and not volunteers. I say that\nespecially because I-I\u2019ve heard people complain about them being not always aware\nand tactful and so forth. I\u2019ve had just the opposite experience.

Otherwise I \u2014 I \u2014 these very much routine, and it\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2019s pleasant work, but\nit\u2019s not \u2014 not terribly challenging, shall we say.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: Yes. I\u2014I think the \u2014 the one \u2014 the little \u2014 little video on Austria, which is \u2014 1s\nvery wrong in a way, because it doesn\u2019t show the many people that didn\u2019t go out\nthere and yell heil Hitler; there were a lot of them. I mean, on the outside it looked\nas though they were welcoming Hitler, but there were a lot of them who didn\u2019t. The\n\u2014 let\u2019s see, seems to me there was a \u2014 a\u2014 one \u2014 one thing that gives me goose\npimples every time I go up there, there is something called a Horst Wessel Lied,\nhave you ever heard of that? Which became almost like an anthem, and we had to\nlearn the words to it. And that \u2014 that is being played, you know, on the fourth floor.\nAnd every time I go up there and hear it, I just \u2014 just shiver a little bit. It\u2019s\ninteresting. It\u2019s a very kinesthetic experience. And the whole thing on\nKristallnacht is \u2014 is to me is \u2014 1s very \u2014 very shattering. It\u2019s shattering to me, and\nsometimes I stand up there and people go up there and they look and then they walk\nright by. And I feel as though I want to shake them and say hey, read on, you know,\nthat sort of thing. So I think that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s probably \u2014 but that\u2019s impossible to\nimpart on anybody else.

And\nNovember 6, 1997\nit\u2019s kind of interesting to see these young people, it\u2019s \u2014 Austria is \u2014 is booming, you\nknow, it\u2019s very, very do \u2014 economy is doing very well, and even the people up there\nthat \u2014 what used to be peasants, they\u2019re very \u2014 they speak English rather well, and\nyou \u2014 you wonder what their grandparents did. In fact, that was my real reaction. I \u2014\nthere was a group of German kids at the museum, and it was such a happy\ncoincidence because the \u2014 the museum should somehow be prepared to get foreign\ns-speaking people into the right places. Well, this was wonderful, this was a group\nof exchange students who were on their way back home, I think, they came \u2014 they\nwere in Cleveland. And they were wonderful kids, very well behaved, but I really\nand truly said to myself, I wonder how much they know about this, and I wonder if\nanyone\u2019s grandfather or great-grandparent was one of those SS people who did\nawful things, or what \u2014 what they know about it. Because for a few years now \u2014 I \u2014\nI mean, y \u2014 I think now they\u2019re teaching it again in school, but let\u2019s say in the 50s or\n60s, I don\u2019t think the schools in Germany were taught \u2014 taught about the\nHolocaust. I \u2014 I really don\u2019t think they were. Oh what? Yeah, really, does that\nhappen? No, not here, kind of a thing.",
        "A: I \u2014 just through it. Not really, I\u2019ve never \u2014 well, you know, you land in Munich,\nand we took what is called the romantic road. I\u2019d like to go to Berlin because it\u2019s\nNovember 6, 1997\nsupposed to be beautiful. But not really. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on purpose or \u2014 it just\nhasn\u2019t worked out. I\u2019d rather go to Austria.",
        "A: I feel American, very American. In fact, this hyphenated thing, you know,\nItalian-American and so forth, I \u2014 I just think it\u2019s bad. \u2019'm \u2014 I\u2019m American, very\nmuch so. And I \u2014 in fact, I think as soon as I went away from New York, cause I\nwent back a lot, because my mother was there \u2014 my sister still lives there. But as I\nstarted Miami University and went to college, and entered Wellesley and so, I was\n\u2014 was very bent on \u2014 on Americanization. I was probably going to the other\nextreme. I wanted to not have an accent, I wanted to \u2014 to be Americanized. And, I\ndon\u2019t know, then with American husband, of course, he was in the navy, you know,\nand his parents, Massachusetts, Boston. So I \u2014 I made a real effort the other way,\nmaybe \u2014 maybe to the extreme, I don\u2019t know. But I feel very American. But when I\ngo back to Austria the \u2014 the dialect comes back and I \u2014 I feel very much at home.\nIt\u2019s a wonderful feeling. It\u2019s something that \u2014 that is kinda great when you go to a\nforeign country, but it\u2019s not a foreign country. It\u2019s very nice.\nNovember 6, 1997",
        "A: [indecipherable] I don\u2019t think so. I think you thoroughly milked the subject. I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I have no \u2014 nothing. No, not particularly. I was very happy to\ndo this.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nConclusion of Interview\n"
