They played\nWilliam's Tell overture, and um, they asked me what I'll be\nable to sing, I saw the Germans so I didn't want to sing\nYiddish songs, so I sang, I told them I'll sing Schubert's\nserenade in German. And, from then on, we were like a unit.\nWe were Singing and entertaining, going from one camp to the\nother, and Sunday when everybody rested, was resting, we had\nto walk miles and miles from one camp, to the other, to\nperform.\nSWB: And, um, it was you and these same musicians who did\nthis.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int.

We\ndidn't know what it was, after the war we found out that it\nwas some kind of a atomic research center that they tried to\ncamouflage. And we did all the work, the ravven[?] had to\nwalk up and down the highest mountain, carry stones and\nrocks and cement, very hard work for young girls. For\neverybody.\nSWB: How long did you, what were your days like. And did\nyou have friends there?\nHENNY GURKO: My sister was with me. And of course, we all\nbecame friends because people were brought from all parts of\nthe country.

And\nthen we saw, when, it was when the sun started to come out,\nwe Saw a German pass us by. And he said, /kopf froch die\nfrien kompt/, do you know what that means? [cries] Hold\nyour head up high, freedom is coming. [cries] This is a\nCivilian German.

They hung him, because he was pro\nNazi. He was very cruel to the people in the camp. And,\nfrom all this walking I was so weak, that I was laying on\nthis kind of a cot, and all of a sudden I heard, anda lot,\nI was like passed out from being very tired. And then I\nheard unbelievable screams, and somebody said, American is\ncoming, an American tank came into the camp.
