        "Question: This is an interview with Louise Segaar, conducted by Katie Davis, on November 10\",\n2000, at the Holocaust Museum, at the L\u2019Enfant Plaza. This is tape number one, side A. If we\ncan just begin -- if you can give your full name at birth.",
        "Answer: Louise Julia Von Cammingha.",
        "Q: Can you spell your last name?",
        "A: C-a-m-m-i-n-g-h-a.",
        "Q: And when were you born?",
        "A: November 14, 1920.",
        "Q: Okay, and where?",
        "A: Patavia, in Jaffa, Indonesia. In those days was Dutch East Indies.",
        "Q: Can you tell us the names of your mother and father?",
        "A: My father\u2019s name 1s bar -- Baron Ruurd Von Cammingha, my mother\u2019s name was Jacqueline\nVon Sweetin. Now, she is from a general\u2019s family, and they had plantations in Indonesia.",
        "Q: Can you please spell your father\u2019s name, Ruurd?",
        "A: R-u-u-r-d, and then Carl, so my son is the same name. And his sister had a son, was also\nRuurd Carl, and he got smashed by a Nazi truck when he was 16, on the way from high school to\nhis house.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit more about what your mother and father were doing in Indonesia?",
        "A: We owned plantations, we lived there. My mother was born in Malung, and my father was\nsent by the needelaunser handlesbunk, to have a office in Jaffa. So, they met there, and got\nmarried, and I was born -- my brother was born in Polungbung, and we went back to Holland\nwhen I was four, because he was assigned to another job in the Netherlands, and 15 years later\nwas my sister born.",
        "Q: Can you tell us the names of your brother and sister?",
        "A: My brother\u2019s name is Feetus Valerius Von Cammingha, and my sister is Kristina Maria. I\u2019m\nlaughing, because we don\u2019t call each other that way. Totally different names. But Kristina Maria\nVon Cammingha. We call her Snane. And my brother is Peterbas. Crazy.",
        "Q: These are nicknames?",
        "A: Yeah, because as a child, it was too difficult to figure out the real names, so that was what we\ngave them, and that held on for years.",
        "Q: Right, right. Did you yourself have a nickname when you were young?",
        "A: Yeah, my name is Lukie. And now I have a business on the website, I\u2019m -- I -- I\u2019m now\nBonzo, because that was the name during the war as an underground person. You never said your\nown name, but you had a fake name, just in case, to be on the safe side. So Bonzo 1s that little\ndog, look like a bulldog, you know? Feisty, and very determined, and you don\u2019t get rid of that\ndog very easy.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a bit about daily life when you were four, or five, or six, you\u2019re beginning to\nbecome aware of things, back -- back in the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, we had -- we had servants. Of course, all Indonesian, and they were watching us, and\nthey -- they cleaned the house, they were cooking, and doing the laundry, and the laundry was\ndone in the river, and that was slammed on the -- on the rocks. And then a little bit further was\nsomeone brushing the teeth. That was life in Indonesia. We always had protection, we always\nhad people with a gun, just in case, because it was always kind of difficult times. And well, for\nthe rest, it was -- it was very protective. You could not go out, for instance, to the pussar by\nyourself. The pussar 1s like a department place, where you buy st-stuff from outside, because you\ncould get on the back a knife. So why would you provoke that? There\u2019s off -- obviously we have\na -- an -- an -- a white skin, while the population is brown skinned, so -- but mostly they had\nrespect. After all, we -- we were a colony, and if we had to complain, it was not very, very\ndifficult to put a person in -- 1n jail. And in those days no lawyers to defend. If -- if you got a\ncomplain, no questions asked, there you go. That was the way it happened.",
        "Q: And what was it like when you went back to -- where your parent -- well, where your family\noriginally was from -- from the Netherlands?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, to the Netherlands -- see, my father was born in Amsterdam, so his parents were\nin Holland, and my mother\u2019s parents were still in Indonesia. And well, we just lived in -- in the\nstreet, I can remember that, was a -- a -- a house over -- over the entrance of a garage, so I\nremember it was always cold, because the wind always goes through that -- that entrance. Why\nthey picked that house, I never could understand that. And the school was close by, we could\nwalk. In the Netherlands, you don\u2019t have that system as here, that the school buses, you just go\non the bike, or you pick a school close to your house, that\u2019s how it was there. And it was always\nraining. Holland is always damp-y, and -- you get used to that, too, th-the raincoat was way until\nthe ankles. And you had beautiful skin, because always wet, you know, always pinky. And you\njust take things the way it happens, no complain. You don\u2019t know anything better. But I do\nrealize that my mother was relieved because my mother was not accustomed to the Indonesian\nclimate. See, over there, you have six -- six months that it is pouring rain, and six months is it so\ndry that we had red earth in the ears, and in the nose, and on -- because of the dust. So that was\nwhat we called the dry season. And then the wet season was -- if it was always pouring rain, no,\nif it was raining, if you would stand in -- on the street, and the rain would fall, on this side you\nwere wet, on this side you was dry. I never forget that, and it was always six o\u2019clock.",
        "Q: So you actually have a lot memories of Indonesia?",
        "A: Oh, definitely. I had my own monkey. I had my own parrot, white with a little tuft. And that\nparrot was talking, and the monkey was always hugging me, loving me to pieces. I miss that,\nbecause here you\u2019re not allowed to have a monkey. But it is companionship, and you feel kind of\n-- you know, you have something that belongs, and that you protect. Cause the natives, of course,\nthey protected you, but they had no interest in you as a person. They only had interest in\nthemselves, to stay safe. We played tennis, and we -- we swam a lot. I remember you -- you went\nin your pajamas to the movies, that that\u2019s the custom, you know? Nobody\u2019s looking around like\nshe\u2019s crazy, it is just the way that -- that you lived, that way.",
        "Q: And when you went back, did -- to the house, you s -- can -- you say you remember the street.\nCan you describe the neighborhood a little bit more? This is in the Netherlands.",
        "A: In the Netherlands? Oh yeah, but see that was not changed that much. I was the last time in\n84, and everything was changed. And that\u2019s why after that, I f -- I told my sister, I have no\ninclinations to go back, because it is so changed, I don\u2019t re-remember that is my country. It\u2019s all\nhighway, modern buildings, the roads are ap -- you know here the -- the Beltway? In Holland 1s\nit much worse. Because you have not been prepared. Holland is as -- as small as New Jersey.\nEverything has to be one way, because the streets are so narrow. In those days -- the houses were\nbuilt in 12 -- 1200, and then in 16-1700, was mo-more built. So if you go to Amsterdam, or The\nHague, the streets you can only walk in. A car would not even move, because it is so shuclocked,\nyou couldn\u2019t make a turn, it was blocked. Y-You don\u2019t even need a traffic sign, because it\u2019s not\nnecessary.",
        "Q: So where do people leave their cars?",
        "A: Well, you have parking space, if you can find one, but it could be two blocks away -- as long\nas you have your car parked. And that is why we didn\u2019t have a car, we had bikes. I was always\non the bike, cause that\u2019s the easy. And you -- you kept your bike in the house, because they were\nstealing like heck. Now we had the Germans, for instance, we -- we were, for instance, on one\nend of the street, blocked by trucks, two or three, full of soldiers, and on the other side of the\nstreet the same way, so you could not get out, period. And then they were doing rusias. A rusia\nmeans that this house to house search, for either a radio, a fur coat, a bike, anything that they\ncould use. And if you would listen to the BBC for news, then you would get down on your knees\nin front of your front door, ping, out.",
        "Q: What?",
        "A: Killed. Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, you mean if -- if you were discovered listening to the news?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Now, my father -- my whole family is like r-rebels, you know, we -- we do\nthings that you\u2019re not supposed to, but we do it, because we are not told by any big mouth shot,\nwhat we can and cannot do. So, my father was always listening. So when we had that search,\nwhen the -- I -- I stretch my hand this way on the -- at the door, so they could not pass, and I\nalways had my uniform on, because you have to learn a weakness of a person -- I studied that. So\nI found out the Germans were always scared for illness, for anything that is contagious. So I told\nthem point blank -- I\u2019m a big liar -- with straight poker face, sorry, but I have a diphtheria patient\nin the back. Of course not true. So what? And then my father would yell from upstairs, \u201cWho is\nthere?\u201d I said, \u201cDad, this is rotmoff.\u201d That\u2019s Dutch for rotten Jerry. Oh, my father dashed to the -\n- the radio, turn it off, house quiet. So, the Germans didn\u2019t know what I was saying, but they had\nenough, and get out, they didn\u2019t want to get sick. So that was the way it happened in my house.\nNow, I don\u2019t know, next door neighbors, because you was very cautious that you didn\u2019t say too\nmuch.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit more about -- you said no one in my fam -- your family is full of\nrebels. Talk a little bit more about other things your father did, even before the Germans came,\nthat sort of taught you that, how to -- to really be your own person.",
        "A: Oh yeah, well we are very military. My father graduated in Breedah, say as similar as here,\nWest Point. My younger son graduated from West Point. My older son is from VMI. So we\nalways teased each other. The West Point son said, \u201cYou -- you got to tell sir to me.\u201d Now he\u2019s\nnine years younger than my older son, so my older son, \u201cYou can go to you know where.\u201d They\nalways were joking, but we were brought up very strict, and my father was a banker, so I learned\nfinances quick. In -- in 1929, with the depression, I got a -- an income of a dime on Sundays, and\nI had to write everything down on a little book, the expenses, and the income, and if it was not\nbalanced, I would not get my salary.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: And then on my mother\u2019s side, my mother\u2019s father was a general, who fought 1n the archie\nwar, and he earned a golden urn, and that was put in a home for retired soldiers, that is called\nBrombake. And if you visit them, they know, \u201cOh yeah, General Von Sweetin.\u201d My mother had\na brother who was a captain in the Dutch army. My father was in Hoosar, and that means you\nhave your own horse, and you are in the cavalry. And another brother, who was shot by the\nGermans in the airport, was a captain in the army, and he was not in the underground, he was in\nthe regular army, but he tried to stop a German airplane, and when he was shooting, while the\nairplane was landing, they shot him instead, so --",
        "Q: Who -- what was his name?",
        "A: Edward.",
        "Q: Edward.",
        "A: So my younger son is also Edward.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So would have been Edward -- last name?",
        "A: Same.",
        "Q: Von --",
        "A: My uncle was Edward Von Sweetin, because he was a -- a -- a brother of my mother. Now,\nwe have a museum in Brombake, and we have -- that is the Von Sweetin museum, and we have a\nmuseum in Leeuwarden, that is the Von Cammingha museum. And we had a castle on the island\nof Leeuwarden, but that was burned down, and then we had some other castle. You just flow\naway with castles -- close to Leeuwarden, and I have a booklet there, that 1s now the place of a\nwell known Dutch soccer club -- soccer team. So I got that -- my son went to Holland, and he\nwas very impressed with that, and he was visiting them, and telling them that my mother was\nhere, but I never contacted them, because I was so busy. I still have to do that, though. So they\nhave a team there, on the ground of the -- the castle.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, it is fantastic, and amazing how -- how that, you know, develops, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2019'm wondering if you could think back to when your -- you\u2019re still pretty young, and eating\ndinner perhaps, together, and the -- the discussions at the family meal, or just family discussions\nabout politics, in general --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah?",
        "Q: What kinds of things were your mother and father saying?",
        "A: Well, to be honest, we were not always together. My brother was in -- in what do you call it,\ncollege. And I was, of course, in another city, in Haarlem, as a nurse. A student nurse. And my\nsister was born in \u201935, so she was like five to 10 years old during that period, so she was at\nschool. But we were eating in the -- in the living room, I remember that, no central heat in those\ndays, because it was just not existing. The Germans stole anything, everything what was stolable.\nSo we had an -- a stove that was heated by coal, and it smelled horrible, so we had always the\nwindow open. And we cooked like tulip bulbs, and -- I have a list of -- of items that we -- we had\nin those days, because th-th-the stores were just empty. There was no food. And that was on\npurpose, to let us die out. Simple, you know. You just don\u2019t feed the person, so they have to -- to\ndie. So you saw people walking around as a skeleton, because if you have no family that takes\ncare, and you are by yourself, the only way to get stuff is go to the farm, and exchange like\nlinens, or clothing, and then you got your food, so that\u2019s what we did on the bicycle.",
        "Q: I see. A-And, I\u2019m going back now to before the Germans came. What w -- did Jews live\nmixed into your neighborhood --",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: -- or -- tell -- tell us a little bit about that.",
        "A: Okay, we -- we lived in -- like in the von -- von alka madalan, and there were family that was\nall Girl Scouts. Six girls, all very intelligent, and -- and all playing a musical instrument. I was\ndrawn to that family so -- so much, because they had such a nice attitude, and they were so full\nof faith, like nothing could happen. They were -- they were not afraid at all. But I warned them,\nsince I was already in that time, informed. I started in 1933 to smell something. I mean, you --\nyou didn\u2019t have a TV in those days, but if you went to the movies, there was news before the\nmovie started, and I saw the -- the inclination of lots of legs, and lots of parading, big mouth\nspeeches, you know, so I was already in -- in my heart feeling that\u2019s no good. Now, Holland was\nalways neutral, in World War One was -- we were neutral still. We didn\u2019t expect them to get in --\nagainst our rule that we were neutral, and we stayed that way. We made that very clear. The heck\nwith us, that\u2019s their attitude. So our queen was warned on time, Queen Julianna and her kids\nwent to Canada. I have pictures of those, too. My next door neighbor, Rost Von Tunningham,\nyou will not believe that. One brother was with the queen, was always picked up with a horse\nand buggy, had his uniform with that big type of hat, like an admiral wears in those days. And\nthe other brother was an NSB member. National Sas -- Socialist Bund. So that were two brothers\nin one family clashing. So was very important that you could trust each other. So I had his name\non the list of people that would have been cckk. See, everything in Holland was --",
        "Q: That would have been?",
        "A: Killed. Shot. We went to the dunes, we were in Schevening, so that is all dunes, and sand and\nstuff like that, so in the dunes we had -- the Germans made those shelters. And then you would\nhear, dat da da dat da da da, someone was killed. You didn\u2019t know who, because you never get\ninformation, but if you wanted information, you knew people to get it from. I kept mouth shut.",
        "Q: You said that you started seeing some of the news before the movies. What -- can you tell us\nmore about why it worried you? You said you just had a bad feeling.",
        "A: Too -- yeah, too much propaganda, too much big mouth, and provocation. Why would she do\nthat to a -- a -- a person that is your friend? See, if you start to do that, then I start to think you\nare not my friend. I\u2019m very sensitive person. If -- if I have a person in front of me that talks\nnegative, I have an intuition, watch out. That 1s just me. I was born with that. And I could have\nbeen even psychiatr -- what do you call it, someone that looks 1n the future, because I get always\nin the mail, people in that field. Now, I\u2019m not stupid, if they say I do a free reading, and then at\nthe end you get a form to fill out, 20 dollars, I send that form nicely back without the 20 dollars,\nbecause in the beginning they said it was free. I\u2019m not that -- you -- so that was in those days,\ntoo. I -- I have a very sensitive feeling about things.",
        "Q: Was it something that you expressed to your parents in any way?",
        "A: No. They didn\u2019t even know I was in the underground. We had even a soldier in the house, in\nmy brother\u2019s room, yeah. But the soldier was nice. He was my age, so he almost fell in love with\nme. He asked me for a date. I said, \u201cListen buddy, you have that rotten uniform on. Do you think\nI\u2019m stupid?\u201d But he ale -- always came back from his farm in Hamburg with eggs, with butter,\nwith that -- my father said, \u201cDon\u2019t accept it.\u201d My mother said, \u201cUh-uh. I cook with it.\u201d",
        "Q: So I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how you became politically aware. Some of it 1s instinct, but\nyou mentioned that your family is -- is a family full of very strong characters also. So, let\u2019s go\nback still to the time before the Germans have come. When you start seeing some news about the\nGermans, what are people saying? Whe-When are you starting to get very worried, or -- or how\nis that if you could just sort of explain that progression.",
        "A: Okay. In the first place, I was a Girl Scout, in -- in -- in that time was girl -- Girl\u2019s Guide.\nCourse that\u2019s in Holland different. In 1937, I visited the boy\u2019s jamboree. That was in -- in\nHilversum. I noticed there were no Germans, so I talked with the American. She w -- in those\ndays, in Holland, you get English, you get German, you get French, if you\u2019re 11 years old. So I\nhad contact with the American soldiers -- Boy Scouts, because I was impressed about their\ncamps, their -- their tents, very efficient. Their equipment, like they had the water thing hanging,\nand that\u2019s what they got fresh water from. Their whole attitude appealed to me. And then, I was a\nmember of a hockey club. That is field hockey. That is British inclined. Then, of course, I was\ntold you cannot do anything in the uniform, because that 1s -- that\u2019s poor British. So I alr --\nalready felt there is something fishy going on. Why is this forbidden, why is that forbidden? And\nit was not even war yet. And if you talk to a Dutch, forbidden means resent. You already start to.\nIn Holland you don\u2019t need a lawyer. If you have a handshake because you agree, that is the\npromise that you make, and you stick to that. You can trust a Dutch word. You cannot trust a\nGerman word. It\u2019s full of lies, it\u2019s full of promises because they want to mellow you. And we are\nnot that way. We are very cautious. So when I saw that shelters were built, when I was told you\ncannot have lights -- bulbs, like this bright light, forget it. It had to be covered with blue, so the\nlight would go straight down, it would never go outside your window. Now, everybody was\ntaped -- had taped their windows, because ev -- we were bombed. See, if -- then the windows\nwould not break, or it would just hang on the tape. So there were all kind of insinuations. Try to\nget tires for your bike, because rubber would not be available. It happened. Our bikes were\nhaving wooden wheels instead. The word hoarding, here in America, that\u2019s a bad word. I hoard. I\nhoard strange things, because you never know if you need it to use next time. And that\u2019s one part\nthat they say, you know, in here. But that was happening in those days. You take things in the\nhouse, in case.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Louise Segaar. Interview\u2019s being done on\nNovember 10\", in the year 2000, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. This is tape\none, side B. So you -- y-you were accumulating really, evidence that something was going\nwrong.",
        "A: We not only got very good information with the BBC, because of course, they had spies all\nover, already, in that time. But a -- as certain attitudes, like the next door neighbor with the NSB\norganization, who were against our government, and if you are very much for the queen, and you\nare in the military, and you take the oath of defending your country, you just don\u2019t take that, you\nfight back. Not necessarily with a weapon, but you can fight back with sabotage. We sabotaged\nplenty. So when it was the time for the Germans to go in Holland, they pretended that it was\nnecessary, because they had to in-invade Great Britain. And we just broke the dikes, so the water\nwas -- was all over the bolus. You know, the Netherlands is much lower on the sea level than this\ncountry 1s, So we were used that the water would flow down, and you just cope with the fact that\nyou cannot grow anything any more, and everything run -- drowns. But the point was that the\nGerman heavy equipment could not go through, see? So the Germans were forced to go over in\nthe air. It was wall to wall airplanes. And they came with -- what do you call that in -- in English.\nIn -- in German is -- it\u2019s falsesharem. Parachutes, parachutes. So, 1t was a nice target to -- to --\nfrom the ground up, to kill those parachutes when they were coming down. I always felt sorry,\nbecause those people were their own age, like me. And why would you kill an -- a young boy\nthat is forced to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do? Because, I talked with them. We -- we had\nthe -- you know, that we were on the beach, and I would sneak up on -- on the one guy, he had\nlots of hair, all black hair. And we -- we made a bet -- the girls around me, you don\u2019t dare. So I\nsneak behind, and I did like this over his hair. And then he would go, \u201cOh, what are you doing\nhere?\u201d In German, huh. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just -- you know, I\u2019m having a bet, and I won.\u201d\nNow you can see what a crazy kid I was. So we had talks, and then they -- he said, well, don\u2019t\nfear us, because we are just in the army, and if we don\u2019t do it, what we are supposed to do, we\nget killed in our -- our own country. So I found out a lot from them. Besides, I had a girlfriend --\nthat was after the war, who had a castle in Germany, and she said, \u201cWhen I was on my own\ngrounds, going a certain direction, there was an -- a guard telling me to go back in my castle,\nbecause there was something fa -- fishy 1n that area.\u201d\u201d Where the smell came from? Concentration\ncamp. So they had concentration camps all over, and the German population was not supposed to\nknow about it. So, in -- in a way, I -- I always said, I feel like I hate the Germans. I cannot say\nthat, because in every country -- now here, with the politics, you have Republicans, and you have\nDemocrats, also divided. It\u2019s incredible. So it is in every country that way. But you had to be\ncareful, because how did you know?",
        "Q: Did -- did your father ever consider, as war drew near, getting you out of the country, perhaps\ngoing to the United States, or --",
        "A: No. At that time you had no chance. You was -- see, you need a permit. Everything is done by\nthe government. The government could not be trusted either, was very divided. The queen had to\nleave. Many people of the government had to escape. So, the government that ti -- that time, was\nalready corrupt. You need a passport, you need a visa, you need permission, you need a sponsor.\nThat all hinders you. So we sp -- we were sponsored after the war, because we could prove that\nhe could come. But if I would dow -- put down on my application, Nazi, or member of that, do\nyou think United States was crazy enough to -- to let me in? See? So -- and we had no intentions.\nWe -- we were ready to fight for what we had to fight. You mean -- I -- I would have been a -- a\ncoward if I would have tried to get out. My job was to protect the people, like the Jews, like the\ngays, like -- what do you call those people? Gypsies. The Germans had the particular type of\nperson that they did not like, and they were persecuted. So our job was to -- to get coupons so\nthat we could buy food. To get the -- the word Jew off their chest. The -- the word Jew was\nprinted on a star, and that was -- was sewed on -- on any -- any clothing. So if you went on the\nstreet, you have to wear that. What we did was take it off, give them another piece of cloth, hide\nthem. They were not allowed in the street any more. Now, yesterday was Kristallnacht. I never\nforget that either, because any store that belonged to a Jew was smashed in with rocks, with\nstone that they picked up from the street, because in Holland, every street is done with stones,\nyou don\u2019t see concrete that much. And because my family is pretty religious, my -- my father\u2019s\nsister belonged to the Haranhurtus. Haranhurtus is a sect that 1s very religious, and -- and has a\nstrong faith, and 1s very optimistic, and helps you. A person with a mental problem, for instance,\nwould feel a lot better if you was in connection with the Haranhurta, because that\u2019s -- that was\nthe way they were living. And so we knew a -- a watchmaker, I never forget that either. Now, my\naunt lived in Utrecht, a separate city, and that poor family was stoned, and -- and the window\nwas all busted, and people were helping themselves. All those watches were -- were in -- in the\nstore, or clocks, whatever, they just dragged it out. The man was just robbed death. Just because\nhe was a Jew. So I was very res-resentful, and I tell you, when the war was finished, we let them\npay. We let the Germans pay before they went back to -- to the German, to their own country.\nWe let them walk, we didn\u2019t provide any transportation. Now, that is about a three hour walk.\nAnd we had the girls who had been dating, put on the table, on the street. We threw them with\nrotten eggs, rotten tomatoes, and we shaved their hair off completely, to show everybody that girl\nis a trait -- betrayed -- for a threat. No, we were very mean. But see, you are made that way. You\ncannot swallow all that crap.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit more about Kristallnacht. At -- you mentioned what happened in Utrecht, d-\ndo --",
        "A: All over.",
        "Q: B-But --",
        "A: In Hague.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] you describe what happened -- yeah --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- around where you lived?",
        "A: Yeah. Th-They threw rocks in -- in people\u2019s windows of stores, in private windows. I don\u2019t\nknow what else to say, I mean that -- that was on the ninth of -- of November, so if you say you\ntry to forget, I cannot forget it, it\u2019s like it happened yesterday.",
        "Q: Did you yourself stay in that night, or did you go out and watch?",
        "A: I wanted to see it. I had no fear. I still have no fear. In those days my brother was like Ann\nFrank in my father\u2019s office. My father belonged to the RNVB, that is here, triple A, similar. So\nhe helped motorists 1n trouble, and stuff like that, and my father was a secretary. Now, I\u2019m 80\nnow, but I don\u2019t look 80. My father at that time, if you were 16 until 50 I think it was, you was\nnot allowed on the street, you would be picked up and transported to Westerbork. Westerbork\nwas a city close to the German border. You would get stripped from your clothing, and they\nwould give you another ID, and you was then transported to a factory in Germany. To heck with\nthat. So, we -- we got food every day to my brother. My father went once to his office, and it was\nvery foggy that day, and a German shouted in his ear, \u201c\u201cToomshta shoengain.\u201d So my father woke\nup like, \u201cAre you crazy, I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d So he ran -- we all good runners by the way --\naround the shelter in -- in that fog, and he was shot at. He heard, you know, the soldier shooting\nat him. My father made it at home, and he said, \u201c\u201cGet me under the -- under the floor.\u201d So we did\nthat. Of course, no-nobody came at the door, because they didn\u2019t know, in that fog, where he was\nanyway. But that was the last. We learned our lesson. So I found that out later -- course I was in -\n- in the hospital that -- that time, and in those days you didn\u2019t tell each other those things,\nbecause you would not worry, or make a person worry, because I would not have stayed in the\nhospital, I would have stayed home to protect. So I found that out after the war was finished. So\nwe -- we had lots of things to tell to each other.",
        "Q: Tell us about when your brother -- y-you basically described your brother being in hiding, but\nwhen did your parents put him in hiding?",
        "A: That is what I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: They -- see they don\u2019t -- or maybe they said it, but is one ear in, one ear out. But I do know\nthat when I was on vacation, or I had reason to leave the hospital, that I and my mother went\nwith a pot with food. Now, you cannot keep that warm, huh, but anyway he got his food, and\nthen we exchanged news with him. I think he had a radio. I think my father provided that. And of\ncourse, you had to do it in a way that the other people on -- in that office were not aware,\nbecause you never knew of -- if there was a traitor in that office. But since my father had an high\nposition, they had respect for him.",
        "Q: So where exactly was your brother hiding?",
        "A: In -- in that office --",
        "Q: In the li -- in the office?",
        "A: -- in -- in the center of The Hague, Barkstrout.",
        "Q: Just in the office, or was he under --",
        "A: In no --",
        "Q: -- was he behind a closet, or --",
        "A: Yeah. The office -- just like in Ann Frank, Buchen had a -- an -- a fake door, with the book\nthing, and then you would swivel that around, and then he was hiding. But see, that was normal.\nIn those days, your -- you had to think about something, you know, to -- to protect.",
        "Q: How old was he at that point?",
        "A: Well, he is two years younger than I am. So if in 1940, I was 20, he was 18.",
        "Q: So at one point you went away, you were doing your work, or your education, and you came\nback, and your brother was in hiding.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t ask a lot of questions. You eventually saw him, but -- but that\u2019s just how it\nwas.",
        "A: Yeah. Because he had, of course, only the news what he -- we gave him. But since my father\nwas listening to the BBC, and I was involved with scouting, and other things, I mean, you just --\nyou just had to learn what was going around you, otherwise you could not function. I mean, I\nwas a student nurse, in a way, but in that hospital were plenty people also in the underground.\nNow, for instance, one day I had the TBC patients. They need fresh air, so they were in the yard.\nSo that ward was -- was empty, and I got this guy running to me, \u201cHide me, hide me.\u201d A Dutch\nperson. I says, \u201cGo on, go on in the bed, don\u2019t move.\u201d Then the German comes right behind him.\n\u201cDid you see anyone?\u201d Again, I stood like this. I said, \u201cDo you want to get TBC? I didn\u2019t see\nanyone.\u201d Go eyeball to eyeball. In German. So he understood what he had to deal with. So he --\nhe looked with respect all of a sudden. First he looked like ch, another woman, like most men do\nanyway. But I had no intention to let him in. My intention was put my foot out, and then he\nwould stumble over it, and I would jumped on his back, and he would not be alive out that door.\nThat was my intention. So we were pretare -- prepared. So then he -- he ran to the other end of\nthe hall, because he couldn\u2019t get any -- and this guy said, \u201cIs it okay?\u201d I said, \u201cKeep mouth shut,\nI will tell you.\u201d So I had to find out first if everything was okay, and then we had the cellar, and\nwe put him in that cellar. But the point was, in that time, we did not know the director of that\nhospital, if he could be trusted. So everything was very risky, and you had to be very careful. But\nI thought, well, if he goes in that -- in that basement with other people, then th-the -- the principal\nshould be okay. Because he could find that out, if he was the -- the good type of principal.",
        "Q: Why do you think your parents put your brother in hiding, and -- a-and not you?",
        "A: I was not in danger. I was a girl. I was a tomboy girl, and people say, \u201cOh boy, you have to be\ncareful with her.\u201d Because I could climb on -- on the -- on the rainpipe to reach the roof of your\nhouse, and I beat the -- the boys of my age to pulp. They had to respect. I was a real nasty,\nbecause you get that way. If a boy is telling you you cannot do this, you cannot do that, I proved\nto them I could do it. That was the funny thing. And still, my next door neighbors are what you\ncall skinheads. Th-the -- the boys in the 20\u2019s.",
        "Q: Now\u201d",
        "A: Oh yeah, they live right behind -- beside me. So they were using my yard like so what, you\nknow, it\u2019s j-just an old woman. So they play baseball, and -- and whatever, and I picked up the\nballs and didn\u2019t return it to them. And then they would yell bloody murder, like saying words I\nbetter not repeat -- repeat in there. And one day I had enough of it, and I know karate, I did all --\nall kinds of things in my life, all kinds of courses. So, I wrapped my legs around the guys hip,\nvery tight, couldn\u2019t shake me off, and mur -- you see my nails? That is really like a cat. So five\nnails on this side of his back, five nails on this side of his back. He had no shirt on. The blood\nwas coming out. \u201cOw.\u201d You should have heard him. He could not sleep for five days on his\nback. And that was the time they didn\u2019t play ball either. Was finished. They still are not looking\nat me. They are not looking at me, they are scared to death. Now they are now 25, in the\nmeantime, and whatever age, but no, y-you got to show respect. In -- in -- in Holland, also, I was\nfollowed by a guy in the dunes once, and I knew there was something in his eyes that I did not\nlike. So, I went around that shelter, and I ran, ran, ran, and I outran him. I have third -- third class\nmedal in racing with eight other high schools from The Hague. And I have that someplace, too.\nSo I -- I was good 1n -- in -- in track and field. I was team leader in my hockey team, and they\nwere also all in the underground. But see, you don\u2019t talk about that. In those days, you played\nhockey. And if a guy would ask you for a date, I would not accept, just to be on the safe side. I\ndid date, though. I mean, I was not that -- you know. But it was amazing that the guys I liked\nwere all killed. They -- they went over to Belgium, and France, over the mountains, the Pyrenee\nto France -- to -- to Spain, and they never reached England. And I found that out, too. But, you\nknow, that -- that is the way things happen. I mean, I was careful, I could have been killed sev-\nseveral times. Th-There was a V -- V2 for instance, that is a kind of a small type of missile, two\nstreets from my house. Now, you can imagine that you have that here. Some failed, went back\nwhere they came from. One shell landed in the roof of my house, right through my bedroom, and\nI was hiding under the bed, because I was told the mattress will put -- be your protection. So I\ncrawl out, and there it is, big shell, right through the roof. So we could not repair that at the time,\nbecause there was nobody to do it. We had to move. The rain was just pouring through. Oh, and\nthen the day that -- that we had the invasion, I was on vacation, and five o\u2019clock in the morning -\n- I never forget that either -- a huge plane goes really diving in the street, between the trees, not\neven the tops of the trees, but half of the trees, over the street, and -- and -- and -- and bombing\nthe -- the barracks that were on the end of that street. Now, they had horses. We all came out in\npajamas and stuff. I saw horses heads, legs, tail. Soldiers without a head were still walking, in a\ndaze, of course, and then they dropped. I-It was so terrible to look at it, I can never forget that.\nSo that was five o\u2019clock in the morning, and that was a holiday, like we have here. In -- in -- in --\nin Europe, you called it Poppy day. We all walk with -- what is that, there is a red --",
        "Q: Carnation?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s ared, big flower. Poppies. You had poppy fields in Great Britain, also.",
        "Q: Poppy? It\u2019s a poppy?",
        "A: A poppy, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But there is another word for it, too. To remember the veterans.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So, after the bombing that day, wh-what are some other memories that you have\nfrom the invasion?",
        "A: That was the -- the actually visual experience, because in that time, I had my vacation for\nmaybe four days. And you are not that stupid to go on the street and go back again, because the\nGermans took -- took care of that immediately. There was no chance. But you listened. You\nlistened to neighbors, you listened to -- to the people that you are -- excuse me -- that you are\nplaying hockey with. We had to stop that for awhile, because we were too sad. I mean, you are\njust not in the mood. I-It -- it is too -- it\u2019s too -- too -- too emotional. Yeah. And of course, we\nhad that -- what do you call that here? It\u2019s funny, sometimes I -- I forget the word. I know\nexactly it is -- it is like this. A funinis. What is that in English? Isn\u2019t that stupid? A cell, where\nyou -- you -- you keep prisoners in.",
        "Q: A cell.",
        "A: A cell, yeah, yeah. So that was close by also. And you [indecipherable] 1s at that, because that\nwas still in good hands, so called. But --",
        "Q: Well, when -- after the bombing, di -- we -- did Germans appear on the street? Sort of taking\ncharge on the street?",
        "A: Not -- not -- no, not yet, but it was the NSB, that was the -- the party that was what you call\ncollaborating with the Germans. So they send signals, or they called, or whatever. This\nhappened, that happened, and the Germans were very pleased, you know, that everything went\nthe way that they hoped it would go. But the NSB was not, of course, believing that there was\nanother party to watch them, and so they lost -- they lost casually, their people, too. And that was\nbecause we were very active. We didn\u2019t get no for an answer.",
        "Q: When you say you were on vacation, vacation from?",
        "A: That was a religious holiday, like --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- Easter. In that time was Pingstrund. You don\u2019t have that here. I never found out what it is\nhere.",
        "Q: Okay, and --",
        "A: And then, on the bike, went back to the hospital. There was no bus. There was no train.\nEverything was on halt. So you used the bike. And that\u2019s why I could not have the Germans to\ntake my bike, that was it. And I told him that. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s my -- and of course, you think,\nwell, can\u2019t she just go for two hours without hindrance? Of course I was hindered, but in those\ndays, a nurse was respected. You needed a nurse. I had an old aunt, and she was in -- in ho-house\nfor old people. We went to visit her, to bring food. That is just the way you do it. You don\u2019t let\nyour friends die. You work the hell out of you. I worked day and night.",
        "Q: What was your mom doing at this point?",
        "A: My mom was not strong. Physically, when she came from Indonesia, she was what you call --\nshe di -- didn\u2019t have a particular illness, but I think that she was close to diabetes. She died at 83,\nand my father died when he was 94, but I have my father\u2019s system. And so I don\u2019t fear -- I mean,\nI don\u2019t fear if I die, period, because that is a normal way, to accept the way things go, but I\nalways wanted to be sure I don\u2019t die in an accident, or that I don\u2019t die because someone else\nwants my life. I j-just fight, you know? I\u2019m -- I\u2019m just that way. So maybe that is -- that 1s a kind\nof a vitamin.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is an interview with Louise Segaar, conducted by Katie Davis, on November, 10\", the\nyear 2000, at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. This is tape number two, side A. When the\ninvasion happened, you described the -- the bombing, and the dead animals, and the dead\nsoldiers. How -- what happened next? When -- when was the next time you felt a presence of\nGerman soldiers?",
        "A: Gosh, you -- you meet them --",
        "Q: O-Or -- of the, as you said --",
        "A: Yeah, you meet them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, okay.",
        "A: And as I said, I have no fear. They had the big mouth, but if you show that you have respect\nfor them, then they are decent. I rather would meet German, than I would meet a Jap. A Jap is ne\n-- ne -- nasty. And a Jap is what you call you could not trust. They were more sadistic. A German\nis not sadistic. They do certain things because they feel that\u2019s necessary to do. But they would\nnot -- of course, in -- 1n -- in -- in a cell, they would torture. There\u2019s several ways to do that, but\nthey got that back. So they found that out. If you do that to me, you get the same thing back.",
        "Q: How did you understand at that point what the Germans were trying to do in your country?",
        "A: They were trying to get the country, and get at -- to Germany, an annex, okay. Because of the\nfact that we were so obnoxious, and stubborn and far, far back, it was more difficult for them to\napprehend -- they didn\u2019t expect our resistance. So instead, they stole. That was their big thing.\nSo, we did anything to get their -- not to steal. So we hide it. In the stores, no food. We had food,\nbut they didn\u2019t see it. We had restaurants. On the window, in German, \u201cDeutsch nicht\nschwahan.\u201d That means, German not spoken. So they could go the restaurant, they would not get\ncoffee, they would ge -- not get a lunch. They would drop dead with us looking at them with\npleasure. I saw once, one of those Germans on the floor, kicked down by a bunch of men. Now,\nhe was literally pummeled against his head, on top of his chest. He could not survive. But that is\nthe Dutch way. If you do that to me, you get 10 times worse. So that spreads around. The\nGermans did not do too much, what you call killing, because they got it back 10 times worse.",
        "Q: You\u2019re describing individual, sort of, acts of resistance --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- that people.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Oh.",
        "A: Cause you see it. You have to see it if you -- if you want to eat, you have to go out of your\nhouse and shop. Oh, I tell you. I saw in -- in -- I was once that -- that -- that was another place\nthat I was in the staff of a -- a house for older people, that was close to Arnhem, and of course,\nyou -- you could not use the bike, you had to go with -- with the train. But I was always tempted,\nbut of course, you had to be careful. They were kicking, on the station, little kids, big, big\nGerman guy, six foot, with boots, rifle. They would use their -- the butt of the rifle to kick it\u2019s --\nin -- in those cattle wagons, for the Jews. And oh, I tell you, my hands were itching to get on the\nback of that German, and scratch his eyes out. But, there were too many. So you got to be not\nstupid. Go back in the -- in the -- in the -- 1n the train, and go the way you have to go. But that is\nwhat I, after the war, told the Germans, \u201cYou are bastards. I have no respect for you for what you\ndid. And don\u2019t tell me it didn\u2019t happen, either.\u201d I was here a tour guide. I did a course, I was in\nthe bus with the Germans in the front of the bus, and the Dutch 1n the back of the bus. So in\nDutch, I told the Dutch, I said, \u201cHi, I speak Dutch.\u201d The German said to me, \u201cYou speak\nGerman?\u201d I ignored him. I looked over them. And that\u2019s what I said in Dutch, to the people on\nthe back, and they were clapping. Good luck, Louise, we listen to you. Don\u2019t pay attention. Now\nthat was in the American bus. I shorted them. That is my revenge, in a nice way. But I couldn\u2019t\nhelp myself, I had to do it that way.",
        "Q: Be-Because, before any of this happened, how did you feel about Germans? Way before\nKristallnacht, or --",
        "A: As friends. As friends. I feel you have to be friends in -- in every way. As a Girl Scout, it is\ninternational, so you meet Swedish, you meet -- in those days, were no Russian, either, but I met\nfrom all countries, and I corresponded with every country. I had to correspond it in Korea, in --\nin Thailand, cause I\u2019m interested in how their culture is. I -- I -- I talked with Muslim, in the\nairport where I was working, I met a Muslim on his little carpet, in front of my door, I had to step\nover him. And I told him, how come that you have to pray five times a day, and how can you\nwork? It doesn\u2019t make sense to me, but that\u2019s their religion. So I\u2019m curious, and I\u2019m joking. I\nalways see something funny behind something that is not supposed to be funny. But that is the\nway it happened. I met Lord and Lady Bayton Powell. They were the founders of the girl boy --\nth-the Boy Scouts, and they are British. So that was in Addelboaden, in Switzerland, when I was\nfinished with high school, and my father treated me, he -- he paid for the trip. And I went with\nA-Ake Larous, that is Swiss and French Girl S -- Girl Scout, Girl Guides. Little kids 12 years\nold. Di di di di, di di di di, di di di di, in French, you know. And then you was put in little pup\ntents, like the military, but you could not put your finger against th-the -- the cloth, because the\nrain -- and it was always raining, would make drips, you know, it would drip. So, of course, they\ndid that, to find out it if that was true. And then I was -- I always had a fear for heights, so I went\nalways like a dog, over the mountain -- the Mont Blan, for instance. I went on my fours, and they\nwere always laughing at me. There goes doggie Lukie. But you learn. And the Alps were\nbeautiful. It was nothing -- and it was always fog, because it is high. So you had always clouds\naround, and I al-al-al-always wanted to grab in the cloud, to see if my -- my hand would be wet.\nSo you can tell I had crazy ideas. But we -- we had lots of fun. Oh boy, did we have fun, and the\nfood was delicious. It was Swiss food. But there was no German. They were not allowed. So, in\nthose days, \u201833 - \u201834 - \u201835 - \u201836 - \u201937, you could feel the whole atmosphere, wherever you went.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. A-And situate us in 1940, when the invasion happens. How old were you, and what\nare you doing? You have said a couple times that you are already working in a hospital, but what\nis your status? Are you still being educated?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, just -- if you could situate us.",
        "A: I was a student.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: See, I\u2019m born in 1920, so in 1940, I happen to be 20, and then gradually -- it never happens at\nonce, it goes gradually, so you hardly notice it until you wake up and think, uh-uh, there is\nsomething bad. And you get curious in a way, because that\u2019s what Is -- also told those Germans,\nI -- I always like to know what is the reason you think a certain way? Now, I always wanted to\nbe a student in psychiatrist, or whatever, but I\u2019m -- I\u2019m always intrigued to find out what makes\nyou do the things what you do? And don\u2019t you have any regret? Do you have a conscience?\nWhat do you expect after this, from what you do? I had free talks with them. So I never had been\narrested, or told you go with me. They left me like I had some strange aurea, or angel like thing\naround me, because I was too strong for them. And all -- I always had that.",
        "Q: You said you\u2019d have free conversations. How would those come about, usually?",
        "A: I cannot remember really. The main thing was that they were my age. They were just also\nstudents, in whatever field. Very pleasant, very decent, very polite. I spoke Berlinner German,\nthat is what they told me, I don\u2019t know, but I mean that\u2019s, you know, like perfect. Like Oxford\nEnglish. That\u2019s what I learned, Oxford English, because the teacher came from Oxford. So he\ntalked like that, too. And the French was like Parisian French. So you go to Paris, I have been in\nParis, and they don\u2019t understand you. That\u2019s the funny part. Par-Pardon moi? Pardon moi? They\nsay in French. What do I say funny, is that Russian? So then they turned around like I\u2019m an idiot.\nBut that was the way it goes, and then we talked mostly about things that happen in that time. So\nabout what you eat. In those days, the word sex never came up. That is what I thought later, that\nis funny. In this country it\u2019s nothing but sex. Every day you hear about that, or you see it on TV.\nOver there you had no time to think about that, because there was no way, if the boys are hiding,\nthe men are in offices, where do you get that stuff? And obviously, the Dutch are not lesbian. No\nway. So, I mean, that is how you talked about, mostly.",
        "Q: So, do you remember any of the names of these young men?",
        "A: No, never. We didn\u2019t exchange names.",
        "Q: And where might -- what\u2019s the one example of where you might meet them?",
        "A: Was no sense to do it. No, no, it was not what you call -- what 1s that word?",
        "Q: An appointment?",
        "A: Yeah. It was spontaneous. You meet a person, as a group, group girls, group boys, and that\ncan be on -- on the beach, or it can be in a museum, it can be, I mean, wherever you -- you -- you\nmeet, and wherever a person wants to talk. Because this is not always that you get luck. They --\nthey sometimes just walk away from you, because a German in Holland, after all, was very\nweird. What does a German do in the war time -- that is an enemy. So you don\u2019t speak with\nenemies. But I mean, and you -- you had the -- I-like I said before, you had Germans, and they --\nthey were shot at themselves. So they were eager to talk with us, so that we could feel that they\nwere not enemies, but wi -- they were forced to be an enemy. That -- that was the fascination that\nI always felt. So I always said, \u201cWell, after the war, you\u2019re still my friend.\u201d But see then, an\nNSB-er would not approve that. So you had to be careful in that group, that you was not with an\nNSB-er. As a matter of fact, when -- when we were as Girl Scouts in the woods, and we -- we\nlistened letzer ramaphone in Dutch is it -- where you play --",
        "Q: A record player.",
        "A: A record player, okay. We had the record player, with Irish dances, Scottish dances, and we --\nwe were just doing that as a pleasure, as -- as a meeting on the -- that you -- that you learn\nsomething. But then, one day, there was a group of those NSB girls. Of course, they were\nageressive, and said to us, \u201cYou are not supposed to listen to that.\u201d So we said to them, \u201cWho\ntells you to say that we are not listening? We are if we want to.\u201d So then they started to fight.\nAnd I still remember I had a girl with a hand on her hair, I twisted her hair -- I still have a whole\nbunch of that -- and -- and poked her on the floor, and hit her, and kicked her, and they found out\nthat we were not sissies. So they -- they disappeared in the woods, hollering, yelling. And we\nstill listened to the music, and we still were dancing. Can you believe that you have that here? Oh\nyeah, w-we -- I learned a lot, and I had not even studied karate yet. I did that here, just for the\nheck of it. But our fists -- I learned if you have a lot of rings, you can do more damage than there\n-- no rings, so we had always rings on. Well that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a certain weapon that the Germans\nused, to club you down. They had the -- the metal thing, you know? Cruel, but so what.",
        "Q: When you were speaking with them, do you ever remember -- h-how do you -- how did you\nfeel? Do you ever remember feeling afraid, when -- you know, this guy has a lot of power, he\ncould arrest me if he felt like it.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what I say, I had no fear. And they were not that type. They were s -- just regular\nsoldier boys from farms, or nice families. They were decent. So you -- you -- you -- you could\nsay anything you want, because they would not do it. And that\u2019s what I felt with them. They\nhave no intention, because they rather talk with us, than their own creeps who were so fanatic.\nKall, kill, kill. They were not that way. Otherwise, they would not be on the beach, period. But\nthey had to be away from all the nasty stuff that they got back in their barracks. See?",
        "Q: S-So did meeting some of these boys change your mind at all about the Germans? Make them\nin a way more human?",
        "A: No. No, no. I told them from the beginning, if they ask me for a date -- now, you have to\nunderstand, you have that uniform. If I get caught in that uniform, I know what to expect. So\nplease, don\u2019t pretend I\u2019m stupid. And then they left. They say, \u201cYou are right.\u201d But if I was\nforced, they would not have had me alive, because I am not being forced to do what I don\u2019t want\nto do. See, that boy that we had in the house was forced. We had to.",
        "Q: Tell us aboo -- a bit about him.",
        "A: He -- he was --",
        "Q: How -- when did he come?",
        "A: -- blonde, he was young. I think he was 22. He had a farm close to Hambush, and if he was\nonly -- if he alwa -- always came back with something. Butter, eggs, whatever. And my father\nwas, of course, mad. He didn\u2019t want to accept it. I says to my father, \u201cDon\u2019t be a stupid, that 1s\neating stuff. Who cares where it comes from?\u201d But, he had always girlfriends -- of course, in that\nage, it\u2019s understandable, who wanted to talk with him. So my father would say either he was not\nhome, or my father would not understand the person that called. He ha -- said it is the wrong\nnumber. I had once a girl in front of the house, and I stood opposite her, I said, \u201cDo you like to\nfight with me?\u201d So she understood that I was not a doozie, either. So he didn\u2019t have girls coming\nto the house, we warned him. Don\u2019t even attempt. You are just tolerated. And you will be happy\nthat you still living, because we could have cut your head off, put it under the house. Who was to\nfind that out? You could have been hit on the way to the barracks. There is no proof.",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "A: No. Absolutely not.",
        "Q: S-So how did he show up one day?",
        "A: Well, the army sent him. See, everybody had to have a soldier, because there were not enough\nbarracks. And maybe it was to spy. To see what kind of family he would live with. So, you\nknow, you\u2019re not stupid. If you have an enemy in your house, you are very careful. So I don't\nknow if my father was listening to the BBC. In the meantime he left, because of course, they\nhave to work, they o -- they don\u2019t sit in -- in a small room, six by six like a prison, and do\nnothing. It\u2019s a 22 year old, full of pep, and -- and -- and likes to do all kind of physical stuff. But,\nI mean, you just had to tolerate. And he -- he would come any time of the day, what pleased him,\nand you had to tolerate that. Now, our house w -- most houses in -- in Holland, has a stairway. So\nyou -- you -- you have the living room, and then you go upstairs to the -- to -- to the bedrooms,\nthat\u2019s the way it -- it -- it is all built there. So, we didn\u2019t have to meet him, if he stayed in his\nroom, and we stayed downstairs, there was no way, you know, unless he wanted to talk. But he --\nhe was, of course told by his superiors, don\u2019t ming -- don\u2019t mix. Strictly observe. That -- that\u2019s --",
        "Q: Did he ever eat with you?",
        "A: No. No, he ate in the barracks. The only way that he was with us, was to sleep, yeah. He -- he\nwas showed souvenirs of stuff. I said, I\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t want it. He asked me out, I said no. Just\nlike that. But he understood that. He was a very nice boy. I wish I could have dated him then.\nOh. But you got to resist it. I had to.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So he was an attractive young man?",
        "A: Oh, very. Germans are a very attractive -- no, really. They have the -- the type of jaw. They\nha -- blonde hair. They have that smile full with white teeth. I mean, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not, you know,\nwhat do you call it -- maybe I\u2019m a -- a witch, but I have my emotions, I have my feelings, and\nI\u2019m always in love. I\u2019m in love with everybody.",
        "Q: That\u2019s really interesting.",
        "A: But don\u2019t -- don\u2019t tell me you cannot do this, because then I say, \u201cAha, you watch. I do it.\u201d\nAnd I make it that I do it. And that\u2019s the only reason that I\u2019m still living, probably, because they\nthought she -- she has something about her, you better not fool around with her. I had an -- in my\nkarate school, a guy -- now, at the time I was 65, I was the oldest of that -- in -- in Foster\u2019s High\nSchool. I made a side back kick. He could not come back in two weeks. My teacher told me that.\nI said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know that,\u201d because you\u2019re not supposed to look, you just kick whatever you\ncan kick. And if he was in my way, tough with him. But I didn\u2019t know that. So, you know, you\nuse your elbow. How? You use your hands for taking this thing, so that you have no -- no breath.\nYou learn those things. We had a -- a survival course in the Netherlands, with -- with the Girl\nScouts. And boy, did I work that out beautiful. Because you practiced on each other. Now, if you\n-- if you went too far, you would hear something. The teacher would then say, \u201cOh, you good. Y-\nYou -- you -- you graduate.\u201d If that\u2019s the word. So, I mean, that\u2019s why my grip is still so firm. If\nI have a hand, they say, \u201cGosh, are you 80?\u201d They didn\u2019t believe that. Because that is still in you.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel that any of your talks, or relationships, which sounded pretty specific, but\ndid they ever -- did any of them kind of get out of hand, and you b -- start to like someone too\nmuch? Whether it was a -- a -- a young man, or even someone older, but -- but somebody who\nwas supposed to be the enemy --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but that you perhaps started really liking them too much?",
        "A: No, no. You didn\u2019t go that far.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, no. No, no. You did not make yourself emotional.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: If that person was nice, that was it, the end of the story. It was too dangerous. Can you believe\nhe was involved? Then -- then your -- your mind is different. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s the whole thing.\nYou -- you can be very strong, in a certain way, but you got to keep that path. Because, if you go\nanother way, you are lost.",
        "Q: But how did you know that? I mean, how did you know?",
        "A: Instinct. Survival instinct, I think. Because I have been very sexy looking. And I have been\napproached many, many, many times. In -- in that -- oh, I forgot the train, that was another\nmoment, di -- da -- I was looking 1n, a-and -- out of the window, and this soldier comes with his\nhands beside my cheek, against the window, and tried to kiss me. In those days you had those\nshoes with high heels, like a pin. So I go very slowly down, while he was still trying to get my\ncheek, and I took my shoe, and I whacked him against his you know what, banana. So he went\nbackwards on his back, and was yelling, \u201cOw, ow, ow,\u201d because I hit the right spot. And in the\nmeantime, I went da da da da, dat da, dat da, to the other section of the train where were\npassengers. So he was finished yelling bloody murder, and then he went also in that, to find me.\nBut he has never seen my face. So I sat there between people, looking around like what? Who?\nMe? Don\u2019t know nothing. So he -- he looked at me, but he didn\u2019t know that was me.",
        "Q: And you kept a straight face?",
        "A: Of course. You cannot give yourself away. But I -- when he left, I laughed my head off. I\nlaughed that the next two passenger looked at me like I was [indecipherable]. Then I told that\nperson. He said, \u201cYou dared to do that?\u201d That\u2019s all I heard, \u201cYou dared to do that?\u201d I said, \u201cI\ndare, if I have to.\u201d",
        "Q: Well, a question I have for you is why -- why do you think you dared, or some -- many people\ndared, but many people did not -- didn\u2019t -- why do you thi --",
        "A: Well, not everybody\u2019s strong. See, if you have a strong mind, it is -- it has to do with la --\nreligion, and my family has a strong -- we have P-Presbyterian, and -- and you cannot tell me\nyou want to become a Jew, or you want to be -- that is just not the way. You have to believe first.\nAnd if right is right, and wrong is wrong, that\u2019s just it. You don\u2019t ask questions, you live with\nthat. And that\u2019s why my f -- my father\u2019s family was also very strong, and were with this religion,\nor whatev -- but we stuck to that, and it gives you inner strength. And I have never had fear. I tell\nyou, I have no fear for biting dogs. I had once -- I was nine years old, and my father visited a\nfriend, and he had a dog in a -- 1n a -- in a cage, and in Dutch, beware of dog. So, my father was\nthere, and I looked around, right inside. And the dog was not doing anything. So I was there, my\narms around the dog\u2019s head, and I kissed the dog. I was so -- so happy with that dog. So my\nfather was finished, he look for me, and the owner of the dog got a fit. He said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t you\nread that sign?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I read it. So what?\u201d Your -- I was nine years old, already so -- and\nthe dog did nothing, absolute nothing. So my father said to that man -- maybe it was my father\u2019s\nfriend, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t make such a fuss about it. She 1s good with him. She is -- she is always\ngood with animals.\u201d And I had once a dog that attacked me, and I had my fist -- now, you always\nhave your thumb inside, not outside, but inside, and I put my fist in his mouth. Not, then the teeth\ncannot reach each other, so he was stuck. And then I grabbed him with the back, and I lifted him\nup, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t try it again, buddy.\u201d So I took my hand out. Boy, did he go fast. He was\nscared. Because I did that, nobody else had done it. So that -- that is the way I am. If -- if you --\nif you make me scared, I'll let you know I am not scared, for whatever reason you tried.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Louise Segaar, it\u2019s November 10\", in the year\n2000. We\u2019re at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. I -- I\u2019m -- maybe I\u2019m\nbacktracking a little bit, but I wonder if you can tell me a little bit more about the role faith did\nplay in your family, h -- when you were growing up, when you were younger, how did you learn\nabout it from your mother and father?",
        "A: Attitude. If they -- if they tell us not to do certain bad things, you listen. And their example is\na fact. If -- if you beat a person, you know it\u2019s bad, but there must be a reason for doing that. So\nwhy would you do it in the first place, unless you are provoked, or attacked, or whatever reason.\nBut that\u2019s the only way you are allowed to do that, because the Bible says, love thy neighbor. It\u2019s\nso simple. But people don\u2019t follow that up. And that\u2019s why you get all that mess in the world.\nWhy -- why would I be mad at the Chinese person, because the Chinese government is doing this\nand that and that? That poor Chinese person doesn\u2019t know a thing about the government, and the\ngovernment tells that person, you shall only have one child, you shall only have two childs --\nchildren. For what? Because the government is influencing. And I had the -- the Indonesian\ngovernment, I had the Dutch government, I had the German government. Nobody tells me what I\ncan or cannot do, if they don\u2019t set their own sample. I never go to church, either. I have been to\nchurch. One time I had a lady, her dress was way here so that you could see her things. Big hat\nwith animal skin type of thing. Then my minister, he went around his wife\u2019s back fooling\naround. So when I was working in National airport, he comes one day to my desk. \u201cLouise, do\nyou remember me?\u201d I says, \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d He says, \u201cYou know what happened?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cMy -- my oldest boy got a car accident and died.\u201d So I grabbed his hand, I said, \u201cIs that\npunishment what you did to your wife is now back to your son?\u201d And he looked at me like, \u201cDid\nyou know what I did then?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I know everything,\u201d I said, \u201cbut keep mouth shut.\u201d He\nwas very impressed. Ha-Ha-Had a gorgeous wife, Barbara. So, no -- nobody 1s perfect, but you\ncannot feel superior either, because you don\u2019t have the right to be. But if a person is suppressed,\nI fight for that person. And I don\u2019t have to ask anybody permission. If -- if you get hit on the --\non the street, I help. I go out, and -- and get myself the dirty, with blood, or whatever. You feel\nthat it\u2019s necessary, unless someone else is stabbing you back, and say, \u201cShe killed him.\u201d Then I\nfight. Because that happens a lot in this country.",
        "Q: You said if s -- 1f someone\u2019s sup-suppressed, what was your sense of what was happening to\nJews at that point, once the Germans moved in? I mean, where -- what did you think was\nhappening to them?",
        "A: They were warned. They were already told by the BBC that that would happen. Now, you can\nbelieve it, or you can say baloney. But if things happen, then you don\u2019t think any more that is\nbaloney. It happened. And then you start to be careful, and you take measurements. You don\u2019t sit\nback and wait, you act. And that is why, as a Girl Scout, the motto 1s, be prepared. That helped\nme a lot. As a nurse, you always -- you always protect the lesser -- sick minds, or sick body, or\nwhatever, because you are the one 1s nursing that person. And you cannot turn your back to that.\nIt\u2019s your duty to fight.",
        "Q: Can you remember back to your first contact with the organized Resistance?",
        "A: The organized Resistance was already, the Girl Scouts. Because the leader of my troop was\nconnected with the Red Cross. Now that\u2019s international. So they get information. In those days\nyou had no facts, you had no -- there\u2019s no -- [indecipherable] goes with codes, by telephone. We\n-- we had, for instance, the alphabet in codes. If -- if -- if you sign, I -- you can sign with lights,\nblink, blink, blink. You can sign by sound, dit, dit dit dit, dit dit dit dit dit. We learned that, see?\nWith arm signals. I -- I used to be on a tree, I had the flag, I waved the flag, I would make signals\nto another part of the city.",
        "Q: As a girl -- as a Girl Scout?",
        "A: As a Girl Scout.",
        "Q: But then later as a Resistance person?",
        "A: As a Resistance -- you didn\u2019t need to use that -- tha -- this -- this was playing, you know? To\nlearn.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But there you used other ways.",
        "Q: Oh, I understand, okay. So it introduced you to the idea --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- of --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. But that was all with the Girl Scouts, and I started that when I was 11.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I started the hockey team when I was 11. It is a part of an educational program. You can play\nsoccer, what I did, too. I's -- I told you I was wild. I did everything what a normal girl would not\ndo. But I had that energy. I -- I had to get away with that, because I was bursting from energy.\nAnd if I didn\u2019t beat my brother up, th -- I beat up something else. But th-that was to make -- just\n-- just to relieve yourself, perhaps.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re saying that -- that -- tell -- tell me a little bit more about how the structure of the\nGirls Scouts, and the sports teams was sort of used. Not -- not necessarily exactly the way it was,\nbut how was it used by the people who eventually ended up helping so many people?",
        "A: Well, it -- it was a kind of conscience that you had. A -- a -- an -- a Boy Scout, and a Girl\nScout is prepared. Your conscience says, if something goes wrong, you -- you -- you find a way\nto correct it. So, it is bettering yourself. We -- we had all those mottoes, we -- we were like a few\nminutes in -- in prayer. That is up to you, to the person to do that. You was not forced to do that,\nbut that was just a way of -- of -- of what happened with the -- with the scouting movement. So, I\nmean, it -- 1t was normal, it was not particular odd thing, 1t was just the way it happened.",
        "Q: I\u2019m -- I\u2019m just trying to imagine it though, so you\u2019re organized in the Girl Scouts, or y-you\nkind of inclined to be organized this way. When is the first time where -- or a first time that\nsomeone says to you, I want you to do this, this, and this, and you will be helping because of that\n-- like, how is it explained to you?",
        "A: Okay, it was in a way that you had a choice. It was not like the Nazis did, you had to. You\ncould do it. Lots of things we did to get a badge, for instance. You get a swimming badge, you\nget this badge, you get that badge, oh, my arm was full of badges. So that 1s a kind of giving a\nbone to a dog that does a trick. That\u2019s the way I feel it. But the leader was very good in that,\nbecause she was, as a Red Cross person, aware that not everybody was capable. You -- you have\npeople, they are not strong, you have people they are playing a coward, doesn\u2019t admit it. But\nthat\u2019s the way they are. It\u2019s just their family structure 1s, or whatever experience they had in life.\nAnd you feel well, don\u2019t worry about that person, that is just weak, you go on with a stronger\nperson. And that\u2019s what I think happened. I didn\u2019t have to do it. I could turn my back, and not\neven talk about it, go home and -- and read a book. But then I would sit there with a book like\nthey are doing things that I don\u2019t ha -- do, and I will do it. So, you put your book away, and go\nand say, \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m ready.\u201d Whatever.",

        "Q: Oh you do? What is her name?",
        "A: Yes. We called her Rita. Now the first 1s -- the title is haupfrau, that is for you a strange, but\nthat\u2019s leaders name, and Rita Burgenberra-Fonde -- Fondeyong.",
        "Q: Say it one more time.",
        "A: Burgenberra-Fondeyong. That is typical Dutch. You would not be -- understand. I think I\nhave here pictures with Girl Scouts that I still have her on it. Let me see. This is [indecipherable].\nWhy don\u2019t you look at it? [indecipherable] are trying to open it, so all -- all with the escape to\nCanada. And this is Prince Banhurt, how he looks now. Let me see. Oh, here it is. This is her,\nand this is a Jewish girl, that\u2019s Hedda. And that\u2019s the family that lived opposite us, our -- our\nhouse, Hedda Ricardo. And I asked the Red Cross if she still was living. I have other people that\nI wanted to know, but they have never answered me. I have here all the names of this bunch, this\n-- this the nurses. See, I was here, and that was the children\u2019s -- there was no Jewish person in\nthere, but I wan -- and this -- this is me in Indonesia. Isn\u2019t that cute? And this is my mother with\nme. This is my mother, my grandmother, and my mother-in-law, at the day that I got married.\nSee, I got married by proxy, because my husband was already in Indonesia with the KLM.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And this -- this is then the oldest son with my parents. And he is from a Jewish -- a\nPalestinian soldier. So he looks Jewish. But I have never heard from him, he just denied the fact\nthat we had ever a relationship, so what can you do?",
        "Q: The son?",
        "A: No, the father of my son.",
        "Q: The father, oh.",
        "A: The father of my son. Yeah. And this was my father-in-law. Now, he was in a Jap camp, and\nhe had [indecipherable] with his wrists wrapped with bamboo wrapping, and then the branch of a\ntree, and his legs just above the ground. So he couldn\u2019t touch the ground, and that was done for\nhours. And when he came back to the Netherlands, he was a wreck. He had no -- no nerves any\nmore, everything was like this, and we were constantly told, you are too noisy, too noisy, too\nnoisy. He -- he was absolute ruined.",
        "Q: Did he ever recover more?",
        "A: No, no, he died the same way. You -- th-there is nothing you can do about it. This is my\ndaughter-in-law when -- when she married my son. And we click like sisters.",
        "Q: She\u2019s beautiful.",
        "A: Yeah. And this is the KLM. Yeah. And there\u2019s my hockey team. And here the Brownies. And\nthis is where you get your wooden shoes made. And you see, all nurse\u2019s stuff.",
        "Q: S -- do you remember what the first thing she asked you, or you decided to do?",
        "A: No. I have not the slightest idea, because so many things happened, and -- and that time is\nbetter not to write things down, because you never now who would find it. And my uncle, as I\ntold you, was betrayed because he had said too much, so he was picked up at five in the morning,\nand go to Auschwitz. What -- I didn\u2019t know at that time, I found it out when I was on vacation.\nAnd the Red Cross, after the war, gave my mother the possessions, like a pocketbook, or\nsomething, notebook, that was with his name on it. So everybody was crying, and I didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do. It was just such a shock, you know?",
        "Q: If y -- if y -- if you don\u2019t remember a specific one, if you could just remember generally what\nit would be like, h-how would you -- how -- how would you communicate with your leader?",
        "A: On the meetings.",
        "Q: Okay. So when did you go to the meetings, what did you --",
        "A: Well, any time that you could do it. Officially, see, in -- in the Netherlands, your school is\nalso on Saturday, until about one o\u2019clock, and then you go to -- to this -- to the meeting. And we\nhad off on Wednesday afternoons, so whatever time you had -- of course, as a nurse, I was in\nanother city anyway, but then you would contact people connected with the same scouting\norganization, in that\u2019s -- particular spot. But as a nurse, as I told you, I had two -- two shi-shifts,\nin those days the bombs were ru-running around like crazy, so I had no time.",
        "Q: I-I-In -- 1f you could just give me some examples of kinds of things that you did. I mean,\nyou've been doing that all along --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- but -- through the interview, but if -- if you could --",
        "A: Well, I remember that I had a bunch of Jewish kids, and we -- we spent time to get their star\noff of their costume, and then we told the kids what would happen to them. And we would\ncontact the parents of those kids, and they would approve. And we -- we gave them food, as I\nsaid, we -- we saved the coupons, and we would feed them. We would find homes where they\ncould stay without that someone would be betrayed. So, it is a matter of making connections, and\nstick to those connections that you could trust. And if -- if one -- one child was then already\nunder way to Great Britain, you would get another child instead. So it -- 1t was a matter of -- of\nplanning, and timing, because one had to do this first, in order to do that. And it -- 1t was\ncommunication, and if you would hear something that was different, you would say that. I mean,\nif would be something being fouled up, because something happened unpredictable that -- that\nyou didn\u2019t count on that would happen. That was your duty too, that you would say that,\nimmediately, so that that person could change quick things around, but that -- that child would be\nstill safe, see? So, 1-it was, in a way, working together, absolute like sisters, that you could trust\nany person, without any hesitation. And if I would have found a person -- this -- this 1s for\ninstance, my -- my uncle\u2019s death notice, then you would report that, and that person would get\nsome -- I don\u2019t know what treatment, but they were kicked out. Because that person would be\ndangerous. But see, you had to watch everything. Any -- any suspicious action, word -- action, or\nthought.",
        "Q: So you might be taking a child from where to where?",
        "A: To England. That was the only way. England was the place where they would be, and then the",
        "Q: Where was the child, though, when you got it -- at -- at a --",
        "A: In a house in Great Britain. And underway with a person that would lead them underground.\nThey were usually men, young men. And they spoke French and Spanish, that was a must. So, I\nhave never found out how that happened, because I was not told, see? But I knew that they\nwould reach their goal, because then from the BBC, you would hear that certain families had\narrived safely. And then you would say ahhhhh, like that, you know? You would be so happy,\nbecause you -- you did something, that was accomplished.",
        "Q: S-So you\u2019ve actually been listen -- you were listening to the radio, and you heard the name, a\nfamily name, of someone that you helped?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And then that -- that particular family was still in Holland. So they got their turn\nto go, and meet their kids there. It was very, very -- how shall I put that? It -- 1t was something\nthat you didn\u2019t hesitate to do it. It -- 1t was something like sleeping, and eating, and drinking.\nAnd if you had to work, okay, that was the first thing. I mean, as a nurse, I had to do that, what --\nwhat the hospital told me to do. But in your spare time, you did things like that. You had no time\nto -- to play Monopoly, or whatever. It -- 1t was just to save as many lives as you could do that.\nAnd you didn\u2019t ask any thanks in w -- in -- in return. I cannot remember faces, I cannot\nremember names. I got this little round thing to -- to thank, so what, you know? You have the\ninner satisfaction, that\u2019s all. I can live with it for the rest of my life.",
        "Q: How long did this go on?",
        "A: Until the war was finished. When we were liberated, they were still shooting. I remember I\nwas meeting a tank, I planned to get on it, what I never could do, because it\u2019s 0-overloaded with\npeople. But left or right, th-the Germans were still shooting.",
        "Q: How -- how -- describe 1f you can how you used your job as a nurse, sometimes, apparently --",
        "A: You just did it.",
        "Q: How did you do it?",
        "A: Well, you -- you get assigned certain ward, a certain patient. That -- that was just that the\nhospital works with. And I have my memory with a guy that tried to get his hand under my skirt.\nAnd I had a water pitcher to fill out his -- his glass, instead of the glass, he got it. So he was\nsoaked wet, and I said to him, \u201cYou\u2019d ha -- keep your mouth shut, cause that\u2019s what you\ndeserve.\u201d So he was drenched, and then the -- the -- if I was a night nurse, the morning nurse\nwould have find out naughty, naughty, naughty, but he didn\u2019t have the nerve to tell her that I did\nit.",
        "Q: But you might get assigned a -- someone at the hospital, and would you eventually maybe\nhelp that person hide, or --",
        "A: This -- this -- this is the ward, huh?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So you was assigned to a ward for children, or you was assigned to a ward with men. No, to\nbe honest with you, I was 18, I think I was -- 19. I had never had a man nude. So you are put in a\nward with nothing but nude, embarrassed guys. One had the banana like this, one had like a\npeanut, one had nothing. You know, and they feel bad about me, because I was a 19 year old,\nfresh kid that 1s supposed to touch the guy, and wash it. So, I mean, I learned with a big shock,\nlike oh my God, what did I do now, you know? But you -- you -- you learn to just accept it, and -\n- and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s your job, you know? But is so [indecipherable], but you have to learn fast.",
        "Q: So, bu -- would the children in the hospital ever be Jewish?",
        "A: We had, in 1945, I was assigned to a ward with 50 babies. Those babies were underfed. You\ndon\u2019t ask how, you know it happens. So, if they had no tattoo, it could be a Dutch baby. If they\nhad a tattoo, you was aware that was a baby that was taken from a Jewish home, or from\nAuschwitz. In those days, everything was chaos, unpredictable, you didn\u2019t know if the stories\nwhat went around was rumor or truth. But you had to do what the nurse is supposed to do. We\nhad no coffins any more, for instance. Coffins were out of the question, because there was no\nwood. So we wrapped dead body in a cloth or paper, and -- and then it was -- if you know. Yeah,\nin my ward were many, many who -- who died, and was very emotional, but what can you do,\nyou know, you\u2019re not God.",
        "Q: But when you say yo-yo-you don\u2019t ask, but you know, I mean there\u2019s a good chance that a lot\nof those babies that were being undernourished, were Jewish.",
        "A: That was not the rule, cause everybody in Holland was undernourished. If you was fat, I was\nsupposed to be fat, okay? That has to do with the type of food, you only had soup. Anything\nwhat you ate was soup. And if you know medical structure of a person\u2019s body, it -- it sets in your\n-- in your skin, it sets in your nerves, it sets in your -- in your fat -- you call it edemish. You put a\n-- a thumb on someone\u2019s skin, and it would stay. So that means that is an impression of a person\nthat has too much fluid in the body. And that was the only food you had anyway, so what can\nyou do? I had pea soup, I had this soup, I had that soup, I -- but at least you had soup. You -- you\n-- you went out to the street, and get the leaves from the trees, cook them, that was soup. People\ndon\u2019t understand that here, because you have so -- everything, you know? You have so much\nchoice. When I went in the store after the -- the -- that we came from Holland, I couldn\u2019t believe\nmy eyes. I said to my husband, \u201cGod, we should have had all that stuff during the war.\u201d Because\nthe shelves were with all of those different brands of -- of food, and cans, and oh, what a choice\nyou had. It was amazing. But so what? It was all vitamins, perhaps.",
        "Q: How -- how did you feel, physically during the war?",
        "A: Fantastic. Very s -- very strong. If you were sick, you had no chance. So that again, is in your\nmind, don\u2019t get sick, because then you\u2019re not effective. And, as a nurse, I chose that profession.\nIt sounds -- it sounds -- what is that word? Egoistisha --",
        "Q: E-Egoist?",
        "A: Egoistic. Self preservent. But that\u2019s the only place you got food. And really, I had farmers,\nthey visited their -- their family when they were sick, and they were prepared to give us\npancakes, so I had -- you know, your uniform is with white, huh? I had five pancakes here, and\nthat\u2019s greasy stuff. So the -- just the -- the -- on uniforms, nothing but grease dripping, but\nnobody said anything, everybody was laughing, because you did it. And if someone said, \u201cI hope\nI\u2019m out of this.\u201d Oh, here. No a -- no questions asked. I was once in a place where you have the\nlatrines, had the -- the bedpans. So I come in running, you always ran to, and then s-stapled up\nthree, and -- and -- on each other, that\u2019s always the way you have to be strong. And th-the ward\u2019s\nhead nurse, I hated her, but 1t was so funny. I tell you, I was laughing, and I dropped all those\nbedpans on the floor, because I got a fit from laughing, and that\u2019s me, you know, then -- and she\nstood there, a huge woman, six foot something, and really big. And she had both cheeks like this,\nand I asked her something. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a nasty person, I asked her because I knew she couldn\u2019t\ntalk. So, she opened her mouth with that yellow stuff coming out of her teeth from the egg, and\nshe said, \u201cGet back.\u201d I said, \u201cI want to ask you something.\u201d I stood there, I didn\u2019t go out. I just\nput her on the spot. Oh, did she hated me. So I asked her the question, she could not answer,\nunless all that egg was first out. So I went back to the ward, I\u2019m washing out the\n[indecipherable]. And I had curfew, you could not go out certain time, and you had to bay -- b --\nbe back in a certain time, too. Yeah, you stopping?\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is an interview with Louise Segaar, conducted by Katie Davis, on November 10\", in the\nyear 2000, at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. This is tape number three, side A. You were\ntalking some about the different kinds of things that you might do -- that you might get asked to\ndo. Was there any pattern to it, or -- or how would y -- how would you -- what did you expect in\na given week? That you would have something that you\u2019d have to do?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t expect nothing, because things happened which you didn\u2019t expect. Simple.\nEverything was unpredictable. In -- in a war, you cannot plan anything. If you plan something,\nthen something around you happens, and then you have to change, so you just live what you call\nday by day, minute by minute. And if nothing happens, fine, you was lucky.",
        "Q: W-Would you ever be at the hospital, and -- and have someone come up and sort of get a\nmessage to you that someone needed to talk to you?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. Because they knew that the hospital was my future. I mean, I was a student,\nyou have to learn lots of things. You -- you are a involved with lifes, and medication. I mean,\nyou could not be distracted from what actually the goal of your life was. And I felt that, as a\nnurse, you could use it for later, if the war was finished, for whatever purpose. I still have use for\nit, because it\u2019s the experience you get. I know how to treat it, I know how to treat that. I never\nwalk to a doctor. So, it -- it is very -- you know, it -- it is -- it is a nice occupation, that you can\nuse.",
        "Q: That\u2019s actually interesting to me that you didn\u2019t get bothered when you were at work. So,\nthere were some clear boundaries about what was safe, or okay, or --",
        "A: No, no, because I -- I saw like a girlfriend went on her bike, from one point -- from -- of the\ncity to another, and she got hit by -- by a -- an -- a shell, and what can you do? I mean, I didn\u2019t\neven know she was there, but you hear that later on, you know, sometimes months later. But you\n-- you -- you can cry, but you cannot change it. So, it -- it was shocking. S-Saw some things that\nyou didn\u2019t expect. So I -- I -- I hoped to -- to see her back again, but you never knew.",
        "Q: Wh-Who in your life knew about what you were doing?",
        "A: I would say the leader of this Girl Scout troop, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And what was her name again?",
        "A: Rita Burgenberra-Fondeyong. Let me see, I have something here, cause I didn't know if I\nneeded this. I write everything down. Let me see where you are. There she is. Haupfrau Rita --\nactually name is Maria Katarina Burgenberra-deyong. You can keep this, or -- or copy it. She\nwas born the first of August, and she died 22\" -- on the 12\" of August, in \u201995. Now this is her\nsister, who wrote it to me. Her sister lives on that address, because in \u201995, of course, I was here.\nBut she might have names, and -- and -- and addresses from people fr-from that time. Now this is\nmy uncle, that\u2019s the sit -- the brother of my mother. He died at Auschwitz concentration camp, in\n1941. See, I -- I hope to write a book, if I find a person that can help me out, because I have not\nthe slightest idea how to start, but that\u2019s why I made all those notations, yeah. I was in that -- that\nis -- that is a school of -- home economics 1s that in English. So I did that before I went as a\nnurse. You -- you made cakes from tulip bulbs, spinach from tree leaves. You had no butter, you\nhad no sugar, no chocolate. There were no coffins, bodies were wrapped in paper. Now, that was\nin \u00b042, so it\u2019s -- it started to become nasty. In the beginning you didn\u2019t notice much, but it -- it\nbuilded up, because we were resisting. If we didn\u2019t resist, everything would have been more\npleasant. No heat in the house, which in the bedroom was frozen this thick. Oh yeah, then here I\nwas in the staff of the kitchen, in moylon that 1s that house for old people. And then I was in the\ntrain to The Hague, when German tried to kiss me while I stood at window. Smashed with high\nheeled shoe in his banana. And then I saw a blitzed plane that was shot down, and the pilot was\nstill in his seat, but he was black, ashed, you know? And then you would put your finger against\nthat, and your finger would have the ash, like on Ash Wednesday. That\u2019s -- the Catholics do. But\nhe was still intact, was amazing. Yeah, and -- and the German said, \u201cOkay, you can see it.\u201d",
        "Q: Let me ask you a bit more about her. Where did your Girl Guide leader live?",
        "A: In The Hague. This 1s -- this is all -- see, in The Hague.",
        "Q: Okay, so she lived in The Hague.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How old was she? You were 20.",
        "A: Well, she was born in 1904, and she died 1995. So she was pretty old. Can that be? Yeah, that\ncan be, can be. \u201995, subtract that from there. So in the 90\u2019s, roughly. Thi-This is --",
        "Q: So she was about 10 years older than you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. Now this is the harch sistikting forhoup and roterdumpser escapees, or -- what -- what\nis that here? If -- if you flee. Refugees. And this was the leader who gave me that -- that little\ngadget, that -- Eugene, see, he was French. Sorting out worn clothing to size, at refugees home,\nand s-stuff like that.",
        "Q: So when you still went to a Girl Guide meeting, would you leave the hospital, and put your\nGirl Guide outfit on?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. See, this Girl Guide stuff was before I went as a nurse.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because then I did not live in The Hague. Now, on vacations, if I had time to visit them, I\nwould do that, but Haarlem, that is where -- where the hospital was, is entirely different area. But\nof course, she went on with her Girl Scouts, so we -- we -- we kept 1n touch.",
        "Q: Did she ever talk about -- without being really explicit, but did she ever talk about what she\nwas doing?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, never. I only, because I\u2019m so inquisitive, I find out things. But I did not\nwant to let her feel that I was investigating, 1t was just that I was curious, I wanted to know.",
        "Q: What did you find out about her?",
        "A: In -- in -- in those days, you didn\u2019t do things, if a person didn\u2019t want you to do it, because she\nhad a highly sensitive position. If -- if -- with the Red Cross, that that is international, you have\nto be very careful. So she -- she -- I think she never told anybody that she was a Girl Scout leader\nto begin with, that would have been so stupid. But if you deal with -- with -- with kids, so what,\nwho cares what you do? You know, you play with them, and you keep them happy, and -- and --\nand -- and don\u2019t ask for political things. So, no, I -- I was not that close with her. She was what\nyou call a very strict disciplinarian, what was good, and that\u2019s maybe why she made me the way\nI am, but I had the greatest respect, and you did not backtalk with her. She was that type of\nperson, oh yeah.",
        "Q: What did you call her?",
        "A: Haupfrau.",
        "Q: Haupfrau. Haupfrau --",
        "A: Perhaps you think --",
        "Q: -- what does that mean, Haupfrau?",
        "A: Haupfrau.",
        "Q: Leader?",
        "A: I think that it\u2019s a nickname, and -- and you don\u2019t use that here, because I was here a Girl\nScout, too. It is typical, and how should I say that? If -- if you like a person a lot, that you\nnickname in -- in a nice way, sweet, you know, lovable. So, I think we invented that name.\nMaybe she didn\u2019t like it, but she never said that she didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: So you said that you investigated, even though she was pretty private. H-Ho --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: International. \u201931.",
        "Q: How -- how did you sn -- how did you find out what you did find out about why she did it?",
        "A: Just for asking. I\u2019m not sneaky, I just ask, and if they don\u2019t want to say anything, fine. And if\nthey say, \u201cWhy would you know?\u201d I say, \u201cBecause I\u2019m curious.\u201d Or -- or I\u2019m interested.",
        "Q: Did you ever see her after the war --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- so you could talk to her about it?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, because see, then I moved. I never finished my -- my nursing exam, because it was chaos,\nand as I told you, I was 1n love, the heck with the exam, so I -- I never got my degree. But I feel,\nif you have experience, that should do it. And the hockey stuff also, they -- they kept writing, and\nsending pictures with. It is impossible, because here, not only you immigrate, but you are all of a\nsudden bang, in everything, you know. Because you are new, and you meet people, they want to\nknow everything about you. So I -- I was a celebrity, and as I told you, I did all those courses.\nYou -- you\u2019re just having a job, taking care of your boys, your husband needs to be fed, he\ndoesn\u2019t do a darn thing, he didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t do the -- the yard, or anything, so I kicked him out.\nCan you believe that, he said, \u201cIf we come to the States, you are not allowed to learn how to\ndrive a car.\u201d So, I waited until he went to his job in Washington National Airport, with United\nAirlines, and I looked in the Yellow pages, and I called someone that is offering driving lessons.\nSo there\u2019s a guy, gives me seven lessons for five dollars per hour. I went solo to D.C., came out\nalive, back home. And I said to my husband, \u201cI did it.\u201d Boy, he was exploding. Then, I was not\nallowed to get a job. So, when he went to work, I went with my car, where my new license,\nparked in the parking lot, went inside, with my little ad I found. They needed a person for Mutual\nof Omaha. So I knocked at the door, the guy opens the door, he said, \u201cOh, you want a job, you\nare hired.\u201d And I stayed for 31 years. I still see him, and write Christmas cards, and talk with his\nwife. She is Scottish, he\u2019s -- he is American, they live in Alexandria. But I always asked him, I\nsaid, \u201cWhat did you see in me? Why did you hire me so fast?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause you acted\ncute.\u201d And his wife was laughing. She said, \u201cYeah, I think same way.\u201d And I saw the romance in\nthe airport, because he always went to her counter. I said to him, \u201cUh-uh, that\u2019s not the way to\ngo, that\u2019s the way to go, that\u2019s your office.\u201d",
        "Q: So basically, if someone tells you not to do something, you -- you\u2019re going to go ahead and\ndo it.",
        "A: That seems to be the way it happens. Because I never thought why I would not work to help\nmy kids to go to college, or to get something for the house, or -- I mean, I\u2019m not a slave, but I\nshowed him that I was not a doormat, either, even I was married to him. So he was upset. He\nsaid, \u201cYou don\u2019t obey me.\u201d I said, \u201cFor what? I\u2019m not in Indonesia.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s the way I am.",
        "Q: Well, tha -- this kind of links us, in a way, to orders, you know, when you get orders, when\nyou\u2019re in what -- volved with what you were in, if you got an order, you did have to do it.",
        "A: Yeah, but that\u2019s different.",
        "Q: Okay, how?",
        "A: That is an order that makes sense, that has a purpose. But to say you cannot drive, just for the\nfact that I\u2019m your wife, the hell with you. E-Everybody drives. How can you -- how can you\nwalk from one point to the other? And I hate buses. I hate to be dependent on something. I\u2019m a\nvery in-independent person. And if you say you cannot do this, I say, I do it. That -- that has been\nmy whole life. And my father can tell you that too, if he was still living, because that is just the\nway I am. And maybe it\u2019s because of all the stuff that I have experienced, that it -- that 1t made\nme that -- that way.",
        "Q: How would you get orders from your higher ups, to do certain things?",
        "A: I only listen if you are nice, if you say it in a way, can you please do this, then I do it.",
        "Q: But I mean in -- dur -- during the war, like, ho-ho-how would you even hear that you were\nsupposed to do something?",
        "A: I felt is an honor. An honor that I was asked to do that, and I would do a good job about it. Of\ncourse, you don\u2019t have the schooling, you have no experience. You do the -- the way -- the best\nthat you can do it, but if 1t comes out right, then you get a medal. And you win -- you win TV\u2019s\nand stuff like that, I think. That is it, an -- an accomplishment. But I don\u2019t do anything just\nbecause they ask. It has to have common sense first. Because otherwise, you do something\nagainst your will, and that\u2019s not me.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about any close calls you had? Get into some --",
        "A: Well, if you call that a close call, that -- that -- that soldier in the train, but I never felt it that\nway. No, I -- I feel very religious about it, I feel I have been protected. I never really had a close\ncall. I could have been killed many times, but because of -- of the intuition, or the insight feeling\nthat you get about a certain happening, or a certain person, I think that\u2019s the warning, and then\nyou just be careful.",
        "Q: So do you feel some -- in some way, you were warned sometimes?",
        "A: Maybe -- maybe -- yeah, maybe that twofee, too, that got a shell in the house. You could say\nthat is a close call. But see, I don\u2019t see it that way, because the mattress was between the shell,\nand the shell stuck in -- in the roof, and didn\u2019t go down, didn\u2019t fall all the way, see, so -- and then\n-- and then we -- and that was funny, too. We were -- we were moved -- that -- that\u2019s also\ngovernment ordered, because the house was impossible to fix. So we moved to a family, and\nthey had the pear tree, full of pears, in -- in their yard. Now, in those days, if you had that guy\u2019s\npear, you got shot at. So, his son -- I never forget that, but his son was about my age, too, he was\nalways in the kitchen door with the rifle. I said to him, \u201cHey, you have nothing better to do?\u201d But\n-- but -- but -- but what I do go get you a pear. I wouldn\u2019t even touch it, but I can look at it.\nYeah, you have crazy people. Hot, he was so crazy about his pears, I said, \u201cWhen do you finally\nstart to eat the darn things?\u201d Because the pear has to be ripe and fall out anyway. Oh, oh, oh.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about friendships you made with people who were doing similar\nthings to what you were doing in the Resistance?",
        "A: The only friendships that you could have was in the hospital as a student nurse, and I was\nwith friends in that -- in that hospital for older people, and of course, the sports. Had lots of\nfriends. Girl Scouts, you kept friends for years. But see, you -- you -- you -- either they move, or\nthey get married, so then the -- their name changes. And when I moved, I tried to keep up with\nall those people, but it\u2019s -- you -- you ha -- [indecipherable] work to write. And if they have no\ntime to write back, you just have to give up, or you write a Christmas card with love, your name,\nand that\u2019s it. No, I\u2019m not a person that -- that stays up for 24 hours to keep friends. If the friends\nwa-want to be a friend, I am loyal to that person, and if that person is not loyal, fine, that\u2019s their\nbusiness.",
        "Q: Were you ever trained in any way, to do anything that you did?",
        "A: I think the experience is the training. You do something, and then see what will happen. And\notherwise, the student stuff was experience, and -- and you learn how to be prepared during\nscouting, and you smash someone\u2019s knees when you -- you -- you play hockey. I wound always\nu-up in -- in -- in the back of the goal, because I was so fast, I couldn\u2019t make myself stop. So\nthey couldn\u2019t find me, and I heard them yelling, \u201cLukie, Lukie, where are you?\u201d And then the --\nwas behind the -- the goal, and I was entangled in -- in -- in the goal net, because I couldn\u2019t get\nout of it. But that was the only way, you know. You -- you kept friends with people that you are\nworking with, or laughing with, or experiencing with. Oh boy, I know I had always fun. I always\n-- and that -- that makes you weak, because I get weak from laughing. My grandmother was that\nway, too.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: We always laughed. We had gossip about aunt this, about uncle that, and then all of a sudden,\nyou -- you would have silence, and then you would hear something, like this -- this bottle went\nupside down on the seat, and that was -- I don\u2019t explain it. But I mean, that -- that was our\nfamily. Oh boy, and my mother also, she would have her hands over the stove to keep warm, and\nthen we would gossip again about this, because that\u2019s all that you could do in those days, is\ngossip, because you -- you couldn\u2019t do nothing, nothing else. My mother had no job, and my\nfather would come home with a -- a face like, is the food ready?",
        "Q: Tell us -- you haven\u2019t really -- we\u2019ve mentioned him a couple times, but I wonder if we\nshould tell us the story of your uncle. You know, let\u2019s give his name, and describe a little bit\nabout what he did, and how he ended up --",
        "A: Two -- two uncles. Two uncles.",
        "Q: -- in Auschwitz, okay.",
        "A: Yeah, because I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But let\u2019s tell both.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I only know that --",
        "Q: Just say what you do know.",
        "A: -- he -- he was picked up at five in the morning.",
        "Q: Which one is this?",
        "A: That was the older. That was Alder Young. My mother\u2019s oldest. And I found that out after I\ncame home from -- I think that was the nursing time, and my mother had those items in her\nhands, and she was -- she -- in -- you -- sometimes it was so emotional you couldn\u2019t talk. So I\nhad it -- to find out from my father, who finally talks way after that, but we have never found out\nif he was ill, or that he died in -- in the real gas chambers, what we didn\u2019t know at that time,\neither. Everything was after the war, that you heard about that. And I always thought, how a\nhuman being can invent that. I was absolute perplexed, because a nurse is a nurse. Is healing.\nYou don\u2019t invent all that cruel stuff. You don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t expect that to happen. So, we never\ngot his body. The other uncle, of course, was killed on -- on -- on the tarmac of the airport, so\nthat was a body, but that cousin that was 15 years in a Jap camp, we were told -- again, I don\u2019t\nknow the truth, that he was just killed by -- by not being fed, not getting food, so he was\nmalnutrition.",
        "Q: Th-The one who was killed on the tarmac?",
        "A: That was my youngest uncle.",
        "Q: And what was his name?",
        "A: Edward. That is from this advertisement.",
        "Q: And where was he killed?",
        "A: In Eepenberg, that is close to a place in the ha -- The Hague, a suburb of The Hague.",
        "Q: So they\u2019re both Dutch citizens?",
        "A: Yes, oh yeah. My family.",
        "Q: But no, I know, but I\u2019m --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- just -- the Dutch cit --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So what would have necessitated them being picked up in any way?",
        "A: He was -- they were betrayed. They had -- the uncle that went to Auschwitz was like me,\nunderground, but at that time, I didn\u2019t know that, because we didn\u2019t talk. And the office where he\nworked -- I -- I don\u2019t even know what office that was, was a guy who was member of the n --\nNSB. So, when my uncle talked, he might have been not careful. He was betrayed. Now, at that\ntime, I didn\u2019t know that. I didn\u2019t know about the under -- other uncle, until later, I was told that\nhe was shot. And then in -- years later, my father mailed that to me, that little thing, and I kept it\nat -- all the time, because it is part of history. Now, he was a captain, he was in -- in the -- in the\nDutch army, and he was very brave.",
        "Q: Was your father in the underground?",
        "A: He was -- no, but he was -- he was secretary of -- of that organization like here the Triple A\nis. But, because of his looks -- he looked younger than the age of a person that was sent to work\nin a German factory. He just -- I think he grew his ber -- beard, or whatever he did, in order to go\nto work without the second experience of being picked up. Because he -- he kept going to the\noffice, to do his job, but he was not done being picked up again. Or maybe he got such a shock\nthat he grow older, I don\u2019t know, but that -- that was happening in those days, so you didn\u2019t see\nman between 16, and I think it was either 45, or 55. So you saw only real old men, and men of\nmy age, you -- you saw after the -- the dark fell in, and then you dared to go out, because I still\ndated somehow. And -- and of course, those boys on the hockey field, they dared to go out and\nplay hockey, even they had the chance to go out to the factory in Germany. But, see y-you got\nbolder by the day. Do you think that you -- you -- you -- you thought that the -- the Germans\ncould do all those things, yo-you just thought they were -- they were mentally sick and said those\nthings, but you didn\u2019t obey them, you laughed in their face. Yeah, you can laugh now, but that\u2019s\nhow I lost a lot of boyfriends. I remember I was in love with a -- with a guy, and he always tried\nto bring me home. And then all of a sudden, I went back to play hockey, and he was not there. So\nsomeone said yeah -- what was his name again? I forgot. But he was the guy that went via\nBelgium, and France, and the Pyrenee, and -- and Spain, to England, and then he got caught in --\nin that time, but I have never found out how he got caught. That was just one of those news that\nyou picked up, and you knew that was the guy that you liked so much. So it was -- 1t was very\ntragic. That\u2019s why it was difficult to have your emotions pointed at something, because it never\nlasted. And -- and you had no control about anything. If you tried to, you -- you had to change\nwith a grudge, but so what, it changes, and there is nothing you can do about it. That is just the\nend of that period. So I think I grew faster for my age than any person here in the United States\never will, because of all the pain there, that you endured, and I was too strong to admit it. But I\ngot stronger, I could feel that.",
        "Q: What was it like right when you were doing something, when you -- you had a kid who really\nwas Jewish, and should have had a star, and you were getting the kid to somebody\u2019s house --",
        "A: Oh, that was a challenge, no doubt about that. Yeah, you still have a star? Forget it, off. I just\nripped it. But you see, th-the -- the seam\u2019s still on -- on the thing, so they -- he had to have the\nnew jacket. And we -- we -- we hided all that stuff, we just hided it. Oh no, you had to act fast.\nMaybe you could say I was impulsive, but to me, to -- to wear that, that -- that -- that was plain\nsuicide, and you don\u2019t let that happen, no way. Oh yeah. But see, if you get -- the guy 1s six feet\ntall, with -- with boots, that even a snake don\u2019t -- doesn\u2019t bite through, and you have a -- a -- a --\na rifle that weighs maybe a hundred pounds, or 80 pounds, I think it is, y-you cannot just, you\nknow, do certain things, and -- and get yourself in trouble, because then you out of -- of -- of --\nof a useful life, because you\u2019 ve -- you have to feel useful. It -- it is -- it is a -- a -- I would almost\nsay, even, I\u2019m not a church goer, that you have from the Lord, a test in your life, and it depends\non how -- how you beat that test, that you\u2019re a failure, or that you\u2019re a accomplisher. That\u2019s the\nway I feel. Everything in life is a test.",
        "Q: Were there times that when you were doing things, that you were sort of filled with a -- a\nfeeling that you were under God\u2019s care, or that you were on a mission, or --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, I ca -- I could feel it. I still feel it. I still feel it. And -- and just little things. For\ninstance, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not rich. I have no job, so I depend on Social Security, and a small pension,\nwhat I had to fight for -- was a lawsuit, you know. And a small investment. But I can make it.

        "A: I could use some, but I have a credit that 1s excellent. My bank has me on a senior citizen --\nwhat you call that? Status. So I have, of course, to have a certain amount, so that overdraft is not\ntolerated, but I never have an overdraft, because I calculate my expenses before I even put it in\nthe mailbox. I mean, you have to think. And if there is an expense that 1s before a certain time\nlimit, I call that person, can you extend it a little bit longer? No problem, as long as I keep in\ntouch that I will pay. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- everything is so simple, really. I don\u2019t me -- money is like a\ngame. You get money, and you spend money. But it\u2019s just the -- the -- what 1s that word now?\nThat it\u2019s balanced properly.",
        "Q: Have you ever come across any people who you helped rescue, that have identified\nthemselves to you?",
        "A: No, never. It\u2019s because life goes so fast, and your life changes, your physical changes, your --\nwhat is that -- your interests changes, too. And I found out that lots of people are very absorbed\nin their own family. And if you say something, oh that\u2019s nice, but so what? That\u2019s your business.\nSo, that -- that is with everybody. I -- I noticed that with my next door neighbors. I have a -- a\nbunch of Bolivians, and they speak only Spanish, but there\u2019s one guy that I speak English with.\nThey are very nice, and they\u2019re totally different from the other neighbors. But they have their\nown problems. I noticed that, they have problems, but I keep my big mouths shut. And if they --\nif -- if they know how to solve it. For instance, they -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re not -- new in this\ncountry, so they don\u2019t know laws. So the other day, their dog goes out without the leash. I said to\nthe guy, \u201cYou better watch out that the policeman is not passing, because you get hundred\ndollars fine, and you might have that the dog will be impounded.\u201d And he asked me what is --\nwhat is impounded? So he didn\u2019t know that. But now, the -- the dog is with a leash, and he is in\nthe yard, and he is grateful, but he doesn\u2019t show that. It\u2019s just that I felt obligated to protect that\npoor dog, because I love animals, and if that poor -- that Bolivian is not familiar with laws, I\nhave the duty to tell him, to protect that he get in trouble. So they are nice people, very polite.\nBut we -- we don\u2019t do anything voluntarily t-to -- to get more friendly. Let me put it that way.\nThey are on that side of the fence, and I am on this side. Plenty to do. I never sit still.",

        "Q: Yeah [inaudible]",
        "A: See, if -- 1f you have no job -- after the war, my husband got an assignment in Indonesia. So\nwe went there for a year, and that was because that airline, Kahouda Indonesian Airline, was\nsupposed to be independent from the KLM, that\u2019s the Dutch company airline. But the\ngovernment did not like the idea that we were living, so we had a notice of 14 days to scram, get\nout. And I was just married, so all my wedding presents I could not pack, was too many. You --\nyou only had the opportunity to pack what you could carry, so that was all behind, so they had a\nball, perhaps with that stuff. The house was empty. We were just literally refugees. So then you\ncome to the -- to the Netherlands, and you have no home, so you are supposed to live with your\nin-laws, and that -- I just explained my father-in-law was, with the Japs hanging -- oh, that was\nhell. So we tried as soon as we could manage, to immigrate. But, you stay on -- on -- on a list.\nYou need to find your own sponsor, no help with that. So we kept looking in newspapers for\nimmigration, and we found a sponsor. Then you need money in order to pay for the trip. We had\nthat. I -- I -- I worked underground, too. I was not allowed to work, but I did. And then finally, in\n1953, we got permission, and we left at April the sixth, after we had that big flood, on January\nthe 31\u201c, that all the dikes were flooded over. I don\u2019t know if you member -- remember that -- I\nhave also a book about that. So, the south part of Holland was absolute water. Water, water, all\nover, and 2,000 people had drowned. Cows, horses, everything was floating, because they had\ndrowned. It was mess. So, we came here in April, and my son was six. Had not learned a word of\nEnglish, because he 1s just like me. That stupid language, I don\u2019t want to learn that. Now, that\nwas in Holland, so we come here, and we have a family from the state department, and they have\nBlack people, real southern Virginian type. And I was supposed to sit with that Black woman. So\nwhat? I said to the lady, \u201c\u201cWhat big fuss about it? Who cares? She is nice.\u201d And then the Black\nwoman says, \u201cYou are more educated than my own boss.\u201d I told her that, I said, \u201cI dress better, I\nhave better manners, I\u2019m polite, and I -- I have more respect for Black people than you do.\u201d That\nwoman was flabbergasted. She said, \u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I just, you know,\nhave my ears open.\u201d But when you was at work, I -- I -- I got someone at the door, and I opened\nthe door, \u201cAre you Mrs. Gardner?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m the housekeeper.\u201d \u201cOh, you look much better\nthan she does.\u201d Now, I didn\u2019t know that guy, he just knocked at the door, so I mean, a -- a -- a --\na -- I already found a lot of things out.

        "A: But my son -- April, May, June, July, August, September, learned perfect Virginian slang. So\nhe came in the first grade. Then we had a PTA meeting, and that teacher of that class comes to\nme. \u201cI heard that you was from Holland. How come your son speaks perfect English?\u201d I said,\n\u2018So do I.\u201d She was so impressed, she said, \u201cOh, that is so cute, he speaks so good Virginian.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWell, it\u2019s because he was forced to. In Holland, he refused to learn that.\u201d She said, \u201cI\ncannot believe that.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWell, that\u2019s what he said.\u201d Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. So then -- then he\nwas at school here, and the -- both sons, I said, \u201cIf you are in the door, in the house, it\u2019s only\nDutch spoken. You leave the house, then you can speak all the English you want.\u201d So my\nyoungest became a pilot, he goes to Amsterdam for three days. \u201cAre you American?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d\nsaid my son. \u201cBut you speak Dutch.\u201d \u201cSo what? My mother taught -- told me. She is a\n[inaudible].\u201d Of course, he didn\u2019t dare to say that, but I mean, that -- that was what they thought\nin the -- in Holland, because he spoke fluently Dutch.

        "Q: I should -- I shouldn\u2019t have jumped ahead, I want to go back to the last few months of the\nwar, d -- were you beginning to expect a liberation? Were you beginning to hear that it was\nhappening in other places?",
        "A: We had a map with pins, and listening to the BBC, we changed the pins where they lost. So\nwe knew, looking at the pins, that they lost this part, they lost that part, they lost Poland, they --\nthey lost Danzig. The Russians were killing them in the east of -- of Germany. In Belgium were\ncertain battles lost. The battle of Arnhem, you see the -- you saw maybe in the movies about that.\nSo we -- we didn\u2019t have to notice it, you just looked, or listened, and that is how you got the\nnerve to do some certain things that you didn\u2019t dare to do. And that is why we knew that wi --\nthey were, you know, sent to th-the west coast, that is [indecipherable], and that was the -- the\narea where the underground had the -- settled, and there they had to leave all their fur coats that\nthey were snatching, and -- and radios, and whatever. All -- all the luxury stuff that was stolen,\nthey had to leave it there. And they are -- they were -- I think, but I -- I cannot be sure about it,\nstripped from all their whatever, paraphernalia, on their arms, because of ranks, and stuff. So\nthey walked for two or three hours, to their country, as a private. You didn\u2019t notice if a colonel,\nwhatever. We just got them s -- so far down that they were not looking us in the face any more.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that is why we also snapped those girls that we knew had dated. And we put them on a\ntable, and that\u2019s all facts, it\u2019s not that I invent that -- on the table, with a razor here, and razed off,\nfell on the floor. Other young people of my age threw tomatoes in their faces, rotten eggs. We\nsaved it all up for that purpose. And then, of course, they were also -- I don\u2019t know, I was not\nthere to -- to witness that. Cause what happened after that, I don\u2019t know, if they were molested,\nor -- or raped, or -- I -- I just don\u2019t know that.",
        "Q: Oh, you weren\u2019t there when that happened?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. Because, as I told you, I was still a nurse. I was still in the hospital, and what I\nknow 1s either from newspaper news, or in -- in -- 1n the radio at the time, then you had the nerve\nto listen to your own radio. But see, the radio was still German minded, so it was not the way\nthat you could believe it. But when the radio became Dutch again, that was where you listened\nto, and that was honest.",
        "Q: A couple days later, after that happened to those girls, did you ever see any girls with their\nheads shaven?",
        "A: No, no. Oh, I saw that --",

        "Q: What -- what other kinds of things like that happened to people who had collaborated in a\nsense, with the Germans?",
        "A: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, you got punished. But see, I was co -- not connected with\nthose, so they -- they to me were like rotten apples. You don\u2019t talk to them, you don\u2019t want to see\nthem. You have no interest in what -- what happened to them. But you find it out from either\nnews, but you don\u2019t -- you know, that -- that you just happen to see, and then you are surprised.\n[indecipherable] is that -- is that the Dutch way to do things, with the -- officially it was. Dutch\npeople are not angels, either. They are nasty.",
        "Q: And so, within the period of how many days w-w-was the city empty of Germans?",
        "A: That is hard to tell, because also, that was gradually. See, a Dutch person does not want to\nmake a big deal about some event. It\u2019s all hush-hush, and underground. So, if they were picked\nup, I think their uniforms were stripped off first, and they looked like a normal person again.\nThat 1s what happened. So, if you meet a person, then you have no suspicion that -- that is not a\nDutch person, but he might be a German. Because he doesn\u2019t talk, you don\u2019t know. Because\nGermans and -- and -- and -- and Dutch people look very much the same. You look Dutch too.\nNo, really. I mean, that\u2019s the way it is. They\u2019re all blonde, and they have the same expressions,\nrosy cheeks, and even the way they walk is the same.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: I -- I know the difference between someone -- someone from Asia, or someone from the midst\nof Europe, and I -- I always ser -- say here, if someone complains, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you visit\nKosovo?\u201d Then you get a better opinion. I hate that, you know, people complaining because the\nweather is lousy, or whatever. Don\u2019t complain. Go as a volunteer, and help there. That\u2019s my\nanswer. And w -- that -- that is what I hope that the government finally will change, and do that,\ntoo, because there 1s a -- a need so badly, and -- and there is a need for -- for peace between those\nArabs. I said to an Arab once, because I still talk with all -- all kinds of religions, \u201cWhy is it that\n-- that women are treated so lousy in your country? They -- they have a veil, they cannot be\nseen.\u201d I said, \u201cIf I was in your country, the heck with you. I come the way I am, and if you want\nto arrest me, I don\u2019t even go to your country. So if you want to make friends, be normal, be -- be\nthe time of what we live, 2000. You don\u2019t live in the Bible years. It makes sense.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhat -\n- what rights do you have with your beard, and your funny little thing over here to say those\nthings? Because you happen to be an Arab? I have no respect for that. I have respect if you treat\nyour wife in the way she should be treated, and otherwise, bye.\u201d",
        "Q: Tell us how you were actually liberated.",
        "A: I was having my shift finished, and I hear a lot of commotion, and I hear tanks coming in, and\nI run outside, because I have been told that you could sit on one of those. No dice, they were\nalready full. Oh, it was hysterical funny. But you walked beside them, and you threw whatever\nyou could threw at them, and -- and say in English -- I was an interpreter then, too, \u201cOh, we are\nso happy to see you. You have not the slightest idea.\u201d \u201cOh yeah,\u201d said one soldier, very casual,\n\u201cWhat do you think we\u2019re doing here now?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, I think you call that liberation.\u201d",
        "Q: What kind of soldiers were they?",
        "A: They were Palestinian. But see, in those days, they were on the British thing, so -- yeah, and\nCanadians, that\u2019s why I have that book. Because they ask me to become a member, that was also\none of those big honor things. And I was -- oh, I had every week a different boyfriend. I had a --\na sergeant, I had a lieutenant colonel. But the funny thing is, they all were very much in -- like\nthe -- the sergeant, I could not go to a party, if that party was nothing but lieutenants, because of\nhis rank. So I had once that I made a blunder, and I -- I took him to one of those parties, and he\nwas hiding under the table, because he couldn\u2019t show himself. And then he was so -- so feeling\nbad, he drank, drank, drank, so he was loaded, he -- he -- he couldn\u2019t talk any more, so I\nremember I took him under the armpit, and like a sled, I got him outside the door, in the street,\nand then he woke up because of the cold. And the other boyfriend, the lieutenant, yelled at me,\nwhat are you doing with that bum? I said, \u201cWell, he needs fresh air.\u201d See, I -- I was the type, I\ndidn\u2019t care less if he was a sergeant, or a private, or a lieutenant, because I\u2019m a baroness, I have a\ntitle. So I don\u2019t have to feel like, you know, act like a snob, because I was a snob by birth.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve mentioned it all day.",
        "A: Yeah, but can you help it? When I came here, I had to renounce it in the court. I said to the\njudge, \u201cWhat a waste of time.\u201d And he looked at me like, \u201c\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I said, \u201cIf you are\nborn a baroness, you can tell me to renounce it, and I say you\u2019re a nice judge, but I cannot\nrenounce myself, I am born that way.\u201d So then he w -- he -- he thought, \u201cYeah, she makes a lot\nof sense.\u201d So he laughed. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re funny.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I know I\u2019m funny.\u201d But the\nother person, she was a baroness from -- I think it was Denmark. Yeah. She i -- she is from a\nfamous Danish -- of course, we know all -- all -- like in England, who is duke, and who 1s lord,\nand whatever. My uncle was with the House of Lords, so y-you know you brought up in that, and\nyou don't know any better. So, she was a baroness -- what\u2019s that again, and -- and she poked me.\nShe said, \u201cDo you talk like that all the time?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the way I am.\u201d Because she\nwas brought up very stiff, you know, don\u2019t talk, don\u2019t talk. But her husband was American. And\nso he said, \u201cYeah, I can understand.\u201d What -- whatever happens in the court is not always, you\nknow. Well, they think it 1s, but it doesn\u2019t make sense. What\u2019s the point, you go to court, and\nrenounce your own title? It\u2019s so stupid, because you cannot do anything with it. It doesn\u2019t cost\nany money. It doesn\u2019t hurt anybody. It\u2019s just a name.",
        "Q: How -- how much of this story do your children know?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I don\u2019t even start. They don\u2019t want to hear it. No, they don\u2019t want to hear it. They -- it\u2019s -- it is\njust a generation that feels it is not concerning them. They are not interested, they have their --\ntheir own soccer team, and whatever. They\u2019re very occupied. My -- my son is now a coach for --\nfor a soccer team, and they played with a Dutch soccer team from the embassy. Oh boy, he is so\n-- so that -- that is big deal, and I feel if you are together, it should be happy, and because of that\noc-occasion, and if they want to know, they can ask. But they never do. And I feel well, that\u2019s\ntheir tough luck, they don\u2019t know what they are missing. But maybe it\u2019s good, cause it\u2019s nothing\nbut sad, sad, sad. And they don\u2019t like me to be very -- how shall I put it, with -- with a -- with a\nface like suffering and stuff, because that\u2019s not the way we are. We are all happy. And I keep it\nthat way. And what was happened in the past, it happened in the past. I live with that.",
        "Q: Is there something else you wanted to mention before we [indecipherable]",

        "A: C-a-m-m-i-n-g-h-a.",
        "A: November 14, 1920.",
        "A: Patavia, in Jaffa, Indonesia. In those days was Dutch East Indies.",
        "A: My father\u2019s name 1s bar -- Baron Ruurd Von Cammingha, my mother\u2019s name was Jacqueline\nVon Sweetin. Now, she is from a general\u2019s family, and they had plantations in Indonesia.",
        "A: R-u-u-r-d, and then Carl, so my son is the same name. And his sister had a son, was also\nRuurd Carl, and he got smashed by a Nazi truck when he was 16, on the way from high school to\nhis house.",
        "A: We owned plantations, we lived there. My mother was born in Malung, and my father was\nsent by the needelaunser handlesbunk, to have a office in Jaffa. So, they met there, and got\nmarried, and I was born -- my brother was born in Polungbung, and we went back to Holland\nwhen I was four, because he was assigned to another job in the Netherlands, and 15 years later\nwas my sister born.",
        "A: My brother\u2019s name is Feetus Valerius Von Cammingha, and my sister is Kristina Maria. I\u2019m\nlaughing, because we don\u2019t call each other that way. Totally different names. But Kristina Maria\nVon Cammingha. We call her Snane. And my brother is Peterbas. Crazy.",
        "A: Yeah, because as a child, it was too difficult to figure out the real names, so that was what we\ngave them, and that held on for years.",
        "A: Yeah, my name is Lukie. And now I have a business on the website, I\u2019m -- I -- I\u2019m now\nBonzo, because that was the name during the war as an underground person. You never said your\nown name, but you had a fake name, just in case, to be on the safe side. So Bonzo 1s that little\ndog, look like a bulldog, you know? Feisty, and very determined, and you don\u2019t get rid of that\ndog very easy.",
        "A: Yeah, we had -- we had servants. Of course, all Indonesian, and they were watching us, and\nthey -- they cleaned the house, they were cooking, and doing the laundry, and the laundry was\ndone in the river, and that was slammed on the -- on the rocks. And then a little bit further was\nsomeone brushing the teeth. That was life in Indonesia. We always had protection, we always\nhad people with a gun, just in case, because it was always kind of difficult times. And well, for\nthe rest, it was -- it was very protective. You could not go out, for instance, to the pussar by\nyourself. The pussar 1s like a department place, where you buy st-stuff from outside, because you\ncould get on the back a knife. So why would you provoke that? There\u2019s off -- obviously we have\na -- an -- an -- a white skin, while the population is brown skinned, so -- but mostly they had\nrespect. After all, we -- we were a colony, and if we had to complain, it was not very, very\ndifficult to put a person in -- 1n jail. And in those days no lawyers to defend. If -- if you got a\ncomplain, no questions asked, there you go. That was the way it happened.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, to the Netherlands -- see, my father was born in Amsterdam, so his parents were\nin Holland, and my mother\u2019s parents were still in Indonesia. And well, we just lived in -- in the\nstreet, I can remember that, was a -- a -- a house over -- over the entrance of a garage, so I\nremember it was always cold, because the wind always goes through that -- that entrance. Why\nthey picked that house, I never could understand that. And the school was close by, we could\nwalk. In the Netherlands, you don\u2019t have that system as here, that the school buses, you just go\non the bike, or you pick a school close to your house, that\u2019s how it was there. And it was always\nraining. Holland is always damp-y, and -- you get used to that, too, th-the raincoat was way until\nthe ankles. And you had beautiful skin, because always wet, you know, always pinky. And you\njust take things the way it happens, no complain. You don\u2019t know anything better. But I do\nrealize that my mother was relieved because my mother was not accustomed to the Indonesian\nclimate. See, over there, you have six -- six months that it is pouring rain, and six months is it so\ndry that we had red earth in the ears, and in the nose, and on -- because of the dust. So that was\nwhat we called the dry season. And then the wet season was -- if it was always pouring rain, no,\nif it was raining, if you would stand in -- on the street, and the rain would fall, on this side you\nwere wet, on this side you was dry. I never forget that, and it was always six o\u2019clock.",
        "A: Oh, definitely. I had my own monkey. I had my own parrot, white with a little tuft. And that\nparrot was talking, and the monkey was always hugging me, loving me to pieces. I miss that,\nbecause here you\u2019re not allowed to have a monkey. But it is companionship, and you feel kind of\n-- you know, you have something that belongs, and that you protect. Cause the natives, of course,\nthey protected you, but they had no interest in you as a person. They only had interest in\nthemselves, to stay safe. We played tennis, and we -- we swam a lot. I remember you -- you went\nin your pajamas to the movies, that that\u2019s the custom, you know? Nobody\u2019s looking around like\nshe\u2019s crazy, it is just the way that -- that you lived, that way.",
        "A: In the Netherlands? Oh yeah, but see that was not changed that much. I was the last time in\n84, and everything was changed. And that\u2019s why after that, I f -- I told my sister, I have no\ninclinations to go back, because it is so changed, I don\u2019t re-remember that is my country. It\u2019s all\nhighway, modern buildings, the roads are ap -- you know here the -- the Beltway? In Holland 1s\nit much worse. Because you have not been prepared. Holland is as -- as small as New Jersey.\nEverything has to be one way, because the streets are so narrow. In those days -- the houses were\nbuilt in 12 -- 1200, and then in 16-1700, was mo-more built. So if you go to Amsterdam, or The\nHague, the streets you can only walk in. A car would not even move, because it is so shuclocked,\nyou couldn\u2019t make a turn, it was blocked. Y-You don\u2019t even need a traffic sign, because it\u2019s not\nnecessary.",
        "A: Well, you have parking space, if you can find one, but it could be two blocks away -- as long\nas you have your car parked. And that is why we didn\u2019t have a car, we had bikes. I was always\non the bike, cause that\u2019s the easy. And you -- you kept your bike in the house, because they were\nstealing like heck. Now we had the Germans, for instance, we -- we were, for instance, on one\nend of the street, blocked by trucks, two or three, full of soldiers, and on the other side of the\nstreet the same way, so you could not get out, period. And then they were doing rusias. A rusia\nmeans that this house to house search, for either a radio, a fur coat, a bike, anything that they\ncould use. And if you would listen to the BBC for news, then you would get down on your knees\nin front of your front door, ping, out.",
        "A: Killed. Oh yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Now, my father -- my whole family is like r-rebels, you know, we -- we do\nthings that you\u2019re not supposed to, but we do it, because we are not told by any big mouth shot,\nwhat we can and cannot do. So, my father was always listening. So when we had that search,\nwhen the -- I -- I stretch my hand this way on the -- at the door, so they could not pass, and I\nalways had my uniform on, because you have to learn a weakness of a person -- I studied that. So\nI found out the Germans were always scared for illness, for anything that is contagious. So I told\nthem point blank -- I\u2019m a big liar -- with straight poker face, sorry, but I have a diphtheria patient\nin the back. Of course not true. So what? And then my father would yell from upstairs, \u201cWho is\nthere?\u201d I said, \u201cDad, this is rotmoff.\u201d That\u2019s Dutch for rotten Jerry. Oh, my father dashed to the -\n- the radio, turn it off, house quiet. So, the Germans didn\u2019t know what I was saying, but they had\nenough, and get out, they didn\u2019t want to get sick. So that was the way it happened in my house.\nNow, I don\u2019t know, next door neighbors, because you was very cautious that you didn\u2019t say too\nmuch.",
        "A: Oh yeah, well we are very military. My father graduated in Breedah, say as similar as here,\nWest Point. My younger son graduated from West Point. My older son is from VMI. So we\nalways teased each other. The West Point son said, \u201cYou -- you got to tell sir to me.\u201d Now he\u2019s\nnine years younger than my older son, so my older son, \u201cYou can go to you know where.\u201d They\nalways were joking, but we were brought up very strict, and my father was a banker, so I learned\nfinances quick. In -- in 1929, with the depression, I got a -- an income of a dime on Sundays, and\nI had to write everything down on a little book, the expenses, and the income, and if it was not\nbalanced, I would not get my salary.",
        "A: And then on my mother\u2019s side, my mother\u2019s father was a general, who fought 1n the archie\nwar, and he earned a golden urn, and that was put in a home for retired soldiers, that is called\nBrombake. And if you visit them, they know, \u201cOh yeah, General Von Sweetin.\u201d My mother had\na brother who was a captain in the Dutch army. My father was in Hoosar, and that means you\nhave your own horse, and you are in the cavalry. And another brother, who was shot by the\nGermans in the airport, was a captain in the army, and he was not in the underground, he was in\nthe regular army, but he tried to stop a German airplane, and when he was shooting, while the\nairplane was landing, they shot him instead, so --",
        "A: Edward.",
        "A: So my younger son is also Edward.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Same.",
        "A: My uncle was Edward Von Sweetin, because he was a -- a -- a brother of my mother. Now,\nwe have a museum in Brombake, and we have -- that is the Von Sweetin museum, and we have a\nmuseum in Leeuwarden, that is the Von Cammingha museum. And we had a castle on the island\nof Leeuwarden, but that was burned down, and then we had some other castle. You just flow\naway with castles -- close to Leeuwarden, and I have a booklet there, that 1s now the place of a\nwell known Dutch soccer club -- soccer team. So I got that -- my son went to Holland, and he\nwas very impressed with that, and he was visiting them, and telling them that my mother was\nhere, but I never contacted them, because I was so busy. I still have to do that, though. So they\nhave a team there, on the ground of the -- the castle.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, it is fantastic, and amazing how -- how that, you know, develops, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah?",
        "A: Well, to be honest, we were not always together. My brother was in -- in what do you call it,\ncollege. And I was, of course, in another city, in Haarlem, as a nurse. A student nurse. And my\nsister was born in \u201935, so she was like five to 10 years old during that period, so she was at\nschool. But we were eating in the -- in the living room, I remember that, no central heat in those\ndays, because it was just not existing. The Germans stole anything, everything what was stolable.\nSo we had an -- a stove that was heated by coal, and it smelled horrible, so we had always the\nwindow open. And we cooked like tulip bulbs, and -- I have a list of -- of items that we -- we had\nin those days, because th-th-the stores were just empty. There was no food. And that was on\npurpose, to let us die out. Simple, you know. You just don\u2019t feed the person, so they have to -- to\ndie. So you saw people walking around as a skeleton, because if you have no family that takes\ncare, and you are by yourself, the only way to get stuff is go to the farm, and exchange like\nlinens, or clothing, and then you got your food, so that\u2019s what we did on the bicycle.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Okay, we -- we lived in -- like in the von -- von alka madalan, and there were family that was\nall Girl Scouts. Six girls, all very intelligent, and -- and all playing a musical instrument. I was\ndrawn to that family so -- so much, because they had such a nice attitude, and they were so full\nof faith, like nothing could happen. They were -- they were not afraid at all. But I warned them,\nsince I was already in that time, informed. I started in 1933 to smell something. I mean, you --\nyou didn\u2019t have a TV in those days, but if you went to the movies, there was news before the\nmovie started, and I saw the -- the inclination of lots of legs, and lots of parading, big mouth\nspeeches, you know, so I was already in -- in my heart feeling that\u2019s no good. Now, Holland was\nalways neutral, in World War One was -- we were neutral still. We didn\u2019t expect them to get in --\nagainst our rule that we were neutral, and we stayed that way. We made that very clear. The heck\nwith us, that\u2019s their attitude. So our queen was warned on time, Queen Julianna and her kids\nwent to Canada. I have pictures of those, too. My next door neighbor, Rost Von Tunningham,\nyou will not believe that. One brother was with the queen, was always picked up with a horse\nand buggy, had his uniform with that big type of hat, like an admiral wears in those days. And\nthe other brother was an NSB member. National Sas -- Socialist Bund. So that were two brothers\nin one family clashing. So was very important that you could trust each other. So I had his name\non the list of people that would have been cckk. See, everything in Holland was --",
        "A: Killed. Shot. We went to the dunes, we were in Schevening, so that is all dunes, and sand and\nstuff like that, so in the dunes we had -- the Germans made those shelters. And then you would\nhear, dat da da dat da da da, someone was killed. You didn\u2019t know who, because you never get\ninformation, but if you wanted information, you knew people to get it from. I kept mouth shut.",
        "A: Too -- yeah, too much propaganda, too much big mouth, and provocation. Why would she do\nthat to a -- a -- a person that is your friend? See, if you start to do that, then I start to think you\nare not my friend. I\u2019m very sensitive person. If -- if I have a person in front of me that talks\nnegative, I have an intuition, watch out. That 1s just me. I was born with that. And I could have\nbeen even psychiatr -- what do you call it, someone that looks 1n the future, because I get always\nin the mail, people in that field. Now, I\u2019m not stupid, if they say I do a free reading, and then at\nthe end you get a form to fill out, 20 dollars, I send that form nicely back without the 20 dollars,\nbecause in the beginning they said it was free. I\u2019m not that -- you -- so that was in those days,\ntoo. I -- I have a very sensitive feeling about things.",
        "A: No. They didn\u2019t even know I was in the underground. We had even a soldier in the house, in\nmy brother\u2019s room, yeah. But the soldier was nice. He was my age, so he almost fell in love with\nme. He asked me for a date. I said, \u201cListen buddy, you have that rotten uniform on. Do you think\nI\u2019m stupid?\u201d But he ale -- always came back from his farm in Hamburg with eggs, with butter,\nwith that -- my father said, \u201cDon\u2019t accept it.\u201d My mother said, \u201cUh-uh. I cook with it.\u201d",
        "A: Okay. In the first place, I was a Girl Scout, in -- in -- in that time was girl -- Girl\u2019s Guide.\nCourse that\u2019s in Holland different. In 1937, I visited the boy\u2019s jamboree. That was in -- in\nHilversum. I noticed there were no Germans, so I talked with the American. She w -- in those\ndays, in Holland, you get English, you get German, you get French, if you\u2019re 11 years old. So I\nhad contact with the American soldiers -- Boy Scouts, because I was impressed about their\ncamps, their -- their tents, very efficient. Their equipment, like they had the water thing hanging,\nand that\u2019s what they got fresh water from. Their whole attitude appealed to me. And then, I was a\nmember of a hockey club. That is field hockey. That is British inclined. Then, of course, I was\ntold you cannot do anything in the uniform, because that 1s -- that\u2019s poor British. So I alr --\nalready felt there is something fishy going on. Why is this forbidden, why is that forbidden? And\nit was not even war yet. And if you talk to a Dutch, forbidden means resent. You already start to.\nIn Holland you don\u2019t need a lawyer. If you have a handshake because you agree, that is the\npromise that you make, and you stick to that. You can trust a Dutch word. You cannot trust a\nGerman word. It\u2019s full of lies, it\u2019s full of promises because they want to mellow you. And we are\nnot that way. We are very cautious. So when I saw that shelters were built, when I was told you\ncannot have lights -- bulbs, like this bright light, forget it. It had to be covered with blue, so the\nlight would go straight down, it would never go outside your window. Now, everybody was\ntaped -- had taped their windows, because ev -- we were bombed. See, if -- then the windows\nwould not break, or it would just hang on the tape. So there were all kind of insinuations. Try to\nget tires for your bike, because rubber would not be available. It happened. Our bikes were\nhaving wooden wheels instead. The word hoarding, here in America, that\u2019s a bad word. I hoard. I\nhoard strange things, because you never know if you need it to use next time. And that\u2019s one part\nthat they say, you know, in here. But that was happening in those days. You take things in the\nhouse, in case.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: We not only got very good information with the BBC, because of course, they had spies all\nover, already, in that time. But a -- as certain attitudes, like the next door neighbor with the NSB\norganization, who were against our government, and if you are very much for the queen, and you\nare in the military, and you take the oath of defending your country, you just don\u2019t take that, you\nfight back. Not necessarily with a weapon, but you can fight back with sabotage. We sabotaged\nplenty. So when it was the time for the Germans to go in Holland, they pretended that it was\nnecessary, because they had to in-invade Great Britain. And we just broke the dikes, so the water\nwas -- was all over the bolus. You know, the Netherlands is much lower on the sea level than this\ncountry 1s, So we were used that the water would flow down, and you just cope with the fact that\nyou cannot grow anything any more, and everything run -- drowns. But the point was that the\nGerman heavy equipment could not go through, see? So the Germans were forced to go over in\nthe air. It was wall to wall airplanes. And they came with -- what do you call that in -- in English.\nIn -- in German is -- it\u2019s falsesharem. Parachutes, parachutes. So, 1t was a nice target to -- to --\nfrom the ground up, to kill those parachutes when they were coming down. I always felt sorry,\nbecause those people were their own age, like me. And why would you kill an -- a young boy\nthat is forced to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do? Because, I talked with them. We -- we had\nthe -- you know, that we were on the beach, and I would sneak up on -- on the one guy, he had\nlots of hair, all black hair. And we -- we made a bet -- the girls around me, you don\u2019t dare. So I\nsneak behind, and I did like this over his hair. And then he would go, \u201cOh, what are you doing\nhere?\u201d In German, huh. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just -- you know, I\u2019m having a bet, and I won.\u201d\nNow you can see what a crazy kid I was. So we had talks, and then they -- he said, well, don\u2019t\nfear us, because we are just in the army, and if we don\u2019t do it, what we are supposed to do, we\nget killed in our -- our own country. So I found out a lot from them. Besides, I had a girlfriend --\nthat was after the war, who had a castle in Germany, and she said, \u201cWhen I was on my own\ngrounds, going a certain direction, there was an -- a guard telling me to go back in my castle,\nbecause there was something fa -- fishy 1n that area.\u201d\u201d Where the smell came from? Concentration\ncamp. So they had concentration camps all over, and the German population was not supposed to\nknow about it. So, in -- in a way, I -- I always said, I feel like I hate the Germans. I cannot say\nthat, because in every country -- now here, with the politics, you have Republicans, and you have\nDemocrats, also divided. It\u2019s incredible. So it is in every country that way. But you had to be\ncareful, because how did you know?",
        "A: No. At that time you had no chance. You was -- see, you need a permit. Everything is done by\nthe government. The government could not be trusted either, was very divided. The queen had to\nleave. Many people of the government had to escape. So, the government that ti -- that time, was\nalready corrupt. You need a passport, you need a visa, you need permission, you need a sponsor.\nThat all hinders you. So we sp -- we were sponsored after the war, because we could prove that\nhe could come. But if I would dow -- put down on my application, Nazi, or member of that, do\nyou think United States was crazy enough to -- to let me in? See? So -- and we had no intentions.\nWe -- we were ready to fight for what we had to fight. You mean -- I -- I would have been a -- a\ncoward if I would have tried to get out. My job was to protect the people, like the Jews, like the\ngays, like -- what do you call those people? Gypsies. The Germans had the particular type of\nperson that they did not like, and they were persecuted. So our job was to -- to get coupons so\nthat we could buy food. To get the -- the word Jew off their chest. The -- the word Jew was\nprinted on a star, and that was -- was sewed on -- on any -- any clothing. So if you went on the\nstreet, you have to wear that. What we did was take it off, give them another piece of cloth, hide\nthem. They were not allowed in the street any more. Now, yesterday was Kristallnacht. I never\nforget that either, because any store that belonged to a Jew was smashed in with rocks, with\nstone that they picked up from the street, because in Holland, every street is done with stones,\nyou don\u2019t see concrete that much. And because my family is pretty religious, my -- my father\u2019s\nsister belonged to the Haranhurtus. Haranhurtus is a sect that 1s very religious, and -- and has a\nstrong faith, and 1s very optimistic, and helps you. A person with a mental problem, for instance,\nwould feel a lot better if you was in connection with the Haranhurta, because that\u2019s -- that was\nthe way they were living. And so we knew a -- a watchmaker, I never forget that either. Now, my\naunt lived in Utrecht, a separate city, and that poor family was stoned, and -- and the window\nwas all busted, and people were helping themselves. All those watches were -- were in -- in the\nstore, or clocks, whatever, they just dragged it out. The man was just robbed death. Just because\nhe was a Jew. So I was very res-resentful, and I tell you, when the war was finished, we let them\npay. We let the Germans pay before they went back to -- to the German, to their own country.\nWe let them walk, we didn\u2019t provide any transportation. Now, that is about a three hour walk.\nAnd we had the girls who had been dating, put on the table, on the street. We threw them with\nrotten eggs, rotten tomatoes, and we shaved their hair off completely, to show everybody that girl\nis a trait -- betrayed -- for a threat. No, we were very mean. But see, you are made that way. You\ncannot swallow all that crap.",
        "A: All over.",
        "A: In Hague.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Th-They threw rocks in -- in people\u2019s windows of stores, in private windows. I don\u2019t\nknow what else to say, I mean that -- that was on the ninth of -- of November, so if you say you\ntry to forget, I cannot forget it, it\u2019s like it happened yesterday.",
        "A: I wanted to see it. I had no fear. I still have no fear. In those days my brother was like Ann\nFrank in my father\u2019s office. My father belonged to the RNVB, that is here, triple A, similar. So\nhe helped motorists 1n trouble, and stuff like that, and my father was a secretary. Now, I\u2019m 80\nnow, but I don\u2019t look 80. My father at that time, if you were 16 until 50 I think it was, you was\nnot allowed on the street, you would be picked up and transported to Westerbork. Westerbork\nwas a city close to the German border. You would get stripped from your clothing, and they\nwould give you another ID, and you was then transported to a factory in Germany. To heck with\nthat. So, we -- we got food every day to my brother. My father went once to his office, and it was\nvery foggy that day, and a German shouted in his ear, \u201c\u201cToomshta shoengain.\u201d So my father woke\nup like, \u201cAre you crazy, I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d So he ran -- we all good runners by the way --\naround the shelter in -- in that fog, and he was shot at. He heard, you know, the soldier shooting\nat him. My father made it at home, and he said, \u201c\u201cGet me under the -- under the floor.\u201d So we did\nthat. Of course, no-nobody came at the door, because they didn\u2019t know, in that fog, where he was\nanyway. But that was the last. We learned our lesson. So I found that out later -- course I was in -\n- in the hospital that -- that time, and in those days you didn\u2019t tell each other those things,\nbecause you would not worry, or make a person worry, because I would not have stayed in the\nhospital, I would have stayed home to protect. So I found that out after the war was finished. So\nwe -- we had lots of things to tell to each other.",
        "A: That is what I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: They -- see they don\u2019t -- or maybe they said it, but is one ear in, one ear out. But I do know\nthat when I was on vacation, or I had reason to leave the hospital, that I and my mother went\nwith a pot with food. Now, you cannot keep that warm, huh, but anyway he got his food, and\nthen we exchanged news with him. I think he had a radio. I think my father provided that. And of\ncourse, you had to do it in a way that the other people on -- in that office were not aware,\nbecause you never knew of -- if there was a traitor in that office. But since my father had an high\nposition, they had respect for him.",
        "A: In -- in that office --",
        "A: -- in -- in the center of The Hague, Barkstrout.",
        "A: In no --",
        "A: Yeah. The office -- just like in Ann Frank, Buchen had a -- an -- a fake door, with the book\nthing, and then you would swivel that around, and then he was hiding. But see, that was normal.\nIn those days, your -- you had to think about something, you know, to -- to protect.",
        "A: Well, he is two years younger than I am. So if in 1940, I was 20, he was 18.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah. Because he had, of course, only the news what he -- we gave him. But since my father\nwas listening to the BBC, and I was involved with scouting, and other things, I mean, you just --\nyou just had to learn what was going around you, otherwise you could not function. I mean, I\nwas a student nurse, in a way, but in that hospital were plenty people also in the underground.\nNow, for instance, one day I had the TBC patients. They need fresh air, so they were in the yard.\nSo that ward was -- was empty, and I got this guy running to me, \u201cHide me, hide me.\u201d A Dutch\nperson. I says, \u201cGo on, go on in the bed, don\u2019t move.\u201d Then the German comes right behind him.\n\u201cDid you see anyone?\u201d Again, I stood like this. I said, \u201cDo you want to get TBC? I didn\u2019t see\nanyone.\u201d Go eyeball to eyeball. In German. So he understood what he had to deal with. So he --\nhe looked with respect all of a sudden. First he looked like ch, another woman, like most men do\nanyway. But I had no intention to let him in. My intention was put my foot out, and then he\nwould stumble over it, and I would jumped on his back, and he would not be alive out that door.\nThat was my intention. So we were pretare -- prepared. So then he -- he ran to the other end of\nthe hall, because he couldn\u2019t get any -- and this guy said, \u201cIs it okay?\u201d I said, \u201cKeep mouth shut,\nI will tell you.\u201d So I had to find out first if everything was okay, and then we had the cellar, and\nwe put him in that cellar. But the point was, in that time, we did not know the director of that\nhospital, if he could be trusted. So everything was very risky, and you had to be very careful. But\nI thought, well, if he goes in that -- in that basement with other people, then th-the -- the principal\nshould be okay. Because he could find that out, if he was the -- the good type of principal.",
        "A: I was not in danger. I was a girl. I was a tomboy girl, and people say, \u201cOh boy, you have to be\ncareful with her.\u201d Because I could climb on -- on the -- on the rainpipe to reach the roof of your\nhouse, and I beat the -- the boys of my age to pulp. They had to respect. I was a real nasty,\nbecause you get that way. If a boy is telling you you cannot do this, you cannot do that, I proved\nto them I could do it. That was the funny thing. And still, my next door neighbors are what you\ncall skinheads. Th-the -- the boys in the 20\u2019s.",
        "A: Oh yeah, they live right behind -- beside me. So they were using my yard like so what, you\nknow, it\u2019s j-just an old woman. So they play baseball, and -- and whatever, and I picked up the\nballs and didn\u2019t return it to them. And then they would yell bloody murder, like saying words I\nbetter not repeat -- repeat in there. And one day I had enough of it, and I know karate, I did all --\nall kinds of things in my life, all kinds of courses. So, I wrapped my legs around the guys hip,\nvery tight, couldn\u2019t shake me off, and mur -- you see my nails? That is really like a cat. So five\nnails on this side of his back, five nails on this side of his back. He had no shirt on. The blood\nwas coming out. \u201cOw.\u201d You should have heard him. He could not sleep for five days on his\nback. And that was the time they didn\u2019t play ball either. Was finished. They still are not looking\nat me. They are not looking at me, they are scared to death. Now they are now 25, in the\nmeantime, and whatever age, but no, y-you got to show respect. In -- in -- in Holland, also, I was\nfollowed by a guy in the dunes once, and I knew there was something in his eyes that I did not\nlike. So, I went around that shelter, and I ran, ran, ran, and I outran him. I have third -- third class\nmedal in racing with eight other high schools from The Hague. And I have that someplace, too.\nSo I -- I was good 1n -- in -- in track and field. I was team leader in my hockey team, and they\nwere also all in the underground. But see, you don\u2019t talk about that. In those days, you played\nhockey. And if a guy would ask you for a date, I would not accept, just to be on the safe side. I\ndid date, though. I mean, I was not that -- you know. But it was amazing that the guys I liked\nwere all killed. They -- they went over to Belgium, and France, over the mountains, the Pyrenee\nto France -- to -- to Spain, and they never reached England. And I found that out, too. But, you\nknow, that -- that is the way things happen. I mean, I was careful, I could have been killed sev-\nseveral times. Th-There was a V -- V2 for instance, that is a kind of a small type of missile, two\nstreets from my house. Now, you can imagine that you have that here. Some failed, went back\nwhere they came from. One shell landed in the roof of my house, right through my bedroom, and\nI was hiding under the bed, because I was told the mattress will put -- be your protection. So I\ncrawl out, and there it is, big shell, right through the roof. So we could not repair that at the time,\nbecause there was nobody to do it. We had to move. The rain was just pouring through. Oh, and\nthen the day that -- that we had the invasion, I was on vacation, and five o\u2019clock in the morning -\n- I never forget that either -- a huge plane goes really diving in the street, between the trees, not\neven the tops of the trees, but half of the trees, over the street, and -- and -- and -- and bombing\nthe -- the barracks that were on the end of that street. Now, they had horses. We all came out in\npajamas and stuff. I saw horses heads, legs, tail. Soldiers without a head were still walking, in a\ndaze, of course, and then they dropped. I-It was so terrible to look at it, I can never forget that.\nSo that was five o\u2019clock in the morning, and that was a holiday, like we have here. In -- in -- in --\nin Europe, you called it Poppy day. We all walk with -- what is that, there is a red --",
        "A: No, it\u2019s ared, big flower. Poppies. You had poppy fields in Great Britain, also.",
        "A: A poppy, yeah.",
        "A: But there is another word for it, too. To remember the veterans.",
        "A: That was the -- the actually visual experience, because in that time, I had my vacation for\nmaybe four days. And you are not that stupid to go on the street and go back again, because the\nGermans took -- took care of that immediately. There was no chance. But you listened. You\nlistened to neighbors, you listened to -- to the people that you are -- excuse me -- that you are\nplaying hockey with. We had to stop that for awhile, because we were too sad. I mean, you are\njust not in the mood. I-It -- it is too -- it\u2019s too -- too -- too emotional. Yeah. And of course, we\nhad that -- what do you call that here? It\u2019s funny, sometimes I -- I forget the word. I know\nexactly it is -- it is like this. A funinis. What is that in English? Isn\u2019t that stupid? A cell, where\nyou -- you -- you keep prisoners in.",
        "A: A cell, yeah, yeah. So that was close by also. And you [indecipherable] 1s at that, because that\nwas still in good hands, so called. But --",
        "A: Not -- not -- no, not yet, but it was the NSB, that was the -- the party that was what you call\ncollaborating with the Germans. So they send signals, or they called, or whatever. This\nhappened, that happened, and the Germans were very pleased, you know, that everything went\nthe way that they hoped it would go. But the NSB was not, of course, believing that there was\nanother party to watch them, and so they lost -- they lost casually, their people, too. And that was\nbecause we were very active. We didn\u2019t get no for an answer.",
        "A: That was a religious holiday, like --",
        "A: -- Easter. In that time was Pingstrund. You don\u2019t have that here. I never found out what it is\nhere.",
        "A: And then, on the bike, went back to the hospital. There was no bus. There was no train.\nEverything was on halt. So you used the bike. And that\u2019s why I could not have the Germans to\ntake my bike, that was it. And I told him that. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s my -- and of course, you think,\nwell, can\u2019t she just go for two hours without hindrance? Of course I was hindered, but in those\ndays, a nurse was respected. You needed a nurse. I had an old aunt, and she was in -- in ho-house\nfor old people. We went to visit her, to bring food. That is just the way you do it. You don\u2019t let\nyour friends die. You work the hell out of you. I worked day and night.",
        "A: My mom was not strong. Physically, when she came from Indonesia, she was what you call --\nshe di -- didn\u2019t have a particular illness, but I think that she was close to diabetes. She died at 83,\nand my father died when he was 94, but I have my father\u2019s system. And so I don\u2019t fear -- I mean,\nI don\u2019t fear if I die, period, because that is a normal way, to accept the way things go, but I\nalways wanted to be sure I don\u2019t die in an accident, or that I don\u2019t die because someone else\nwants my life. I j-just fight, you know? I\u2019m -- I\u2019m just that way. So maybe that is -- that 1s a kind\nof a vitamin.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Gosh, you -- you meet them --",
        "A: Yeah, you meet them.",
        "A: And as I said, I have no fear. They had the big mouth, but if you show that you have respect\nfor them, then they are decent. I rather would meet German, than I would meet a Jap. A Jap is ne\n-- ne -- nasty. And a Jap is what you call you could not trust. They were more sadistic. A German\nis not sadistic. They do certain things because they feel that\u2019s necessary to do. But they would\nnot -- of course, in -- 1n -- in -- in a cell, they would torture. There\u2019s several ways to do that, but\nthey got that back. So they found that out. If you do that to me, you get the same thing back.",
        "A: They were trying to get the country, and get at -- to Germany, an annex, okay. Because of the\nfact that we were so obnoxious, and stubborn and far, far back, it was more difficult for them to\napprehend -- they didn\u2019t expect our resistance. So instead, they stole. That was their big thing.\nSo, we did anything to get their -- not to steal. So we hide it. In the stores, no food. We had food,\nbut they didn\u2019t see it. We had restaurants. On the window, in German, \u201cDeutsch nicht\nschwahan.\u201d That means, German not spoken. So they could go the restaurant, they would not get\ncoffee, they would ge -- not get a lunch. They would drop dead with us looking at them with\npleasure. I saw once, one of those Germans on the floor, kicked down by a bunch of men. Now,\nhe was literally pummeled against his head, on top of his chest. He could not survive. But that is\nthe Dutch way. If you do that to me, you get 10 times worse. So that spreads around. The\nGermans did not do too much, what you call killing, because they got it back 10 times worse.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Cause you see it. You have to see it if you -- if you want to eat, you have to go out of your\nhouse and shop. Oh, I tell you. I saw in -- in -- I was once that -- that -- that was another place\nthat I was in the staff of a -- a house for older people, that was close to Arnhem, and of course,\nyou -- you could not use the bike, you had to go with -- with the train. But I was always tempted,\nbut of course, you had to be careful. They were kicking, on the station, little kids, big, big\nGerman guy, six foot, with boots, rifle. They would use their -- the butt of the rifle to kick it\u2019s --\nin -- in those cattle wagons, for the Jews. And oh, I tell you, my hands were itching to get on the\nback of that German, and scratch his eyes out. But, there were too many. So you got to be not\nstupid. Go back in the -- in the -- in the -- 1n the train, and go the way you have to go. But that is\nwhat I, after the war, told the Germans, \u201cYou are bastards. I have no respect for you for what you\ndid. And don\u2019t tell me it didn\u2019t happen, either.\u201d I was here a tour guide. I did a course, I was in\nthe bus with the Germans in the front of the bus, and the Dutch 1n the back of the bus. So in\nDutch, I told the Dutch, I said, \u201cHi, I speak Dutch.\u201d The German said to me, \u201cYou speak\nGerman?\u201d I ignored him. I looked over them. And that\u2019s what I said in Dutch, to the people on\nthe back, and they were clapping. Good luck, Louise, we listen to you. Don\u2019t pay attention. Now\nthat was in the American bus. I shorted them. That is my revenge, in a nice way. But I couldn\u2019t\nhelp myself, I had to do it that way.",
        "A: As friends. As friends. I feel you have to be friends in -- in every way. As a Girl Scout, it is\ninternational, so you meet Swedish, you meet -- in those days, were no Russian, either, but I met\nfrom all countries, and I corresponded with every country. I had to correspond it in Korea, in --\nin Thailand, cause I\u2019m interested in how their culture is. I -- I -- I talked with Muslim, in the\nairport where I was working, I met a Muslim on his little carpet, in front of my door, I had to step\nover him. And I told him, how come that you have to pray five times a day, and how can you\nwork? It doesn\u2019t make sense to me, but that\u2019s their religion. So I\u2019m curious, and I\u2019m joking. I\nalways see something funny behind something that is not supposed to be funny. But that is the\nway it happened. I met Lord and Lady Bayton Powell. They were the founders of the girl boy --\nth-the Boy Scouts, and they are British. So that was in Addelboaden, in Switzerland, when I was\nfinished with high school, and my father treated me, he -- he paid for the trip. And I went with\nA-Ake Larous, that is Swiss and French Girl S -- Girl Scout, Girl Guides. Little kids 12 years\nold. Di di di di, di di di di, di di di di, in French, you know. And then you was put in little pup\ntents, like the military, but you could not put your finger against th-the -- the cloth, because the\nrain -- and it was always raining, would make drips, you know, it would drip. So, of course, they\ndid that, to find out it if that was true. And then I was -- I always had a fear for heights, so I went\nalways like a dog, over the mountain -- the Mont Blan, for instance. I went on my fours, and they\nwere always laughing at me. There goes doggie Lukie. But you learn. And the Alps were\nbeautiful. It was nothing -- and it was always fog, because it is high. So you had always clouds\naround, and I al-al-al-always wanted to grab in the cloud, to see if my -- my hand would be wet.\nSo you can tell I had crazy ideas. But we -- we had lots of fun. Oh boy, did we have fun, and the\nfood was delicious. It was Swiss food. But there was no German. They were not allowed. So, in\nthose days, \u201833 - \u201834 - \u201835 - \u201836 - \u201937, you could feel the whole atmosphere, wherever you went.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was a student.",
        "A: See, I\u2019m born in 1920, so in 1940, I happen to be 20, and then gradually -- it never happens at\nonce, it goes gradually, so you hardly notice it until you wake up and think, uh-uh, there is\nsomething bad. And you get curious in a way, because that\u2019s what Is -- also told those Germans,\nI -- I always like to know what is the reason you think a certain way? Now, I always wanted to\nbe a student in psychiatrist, or whatever, but I\u2019m -- I\u2019m always intrigued to find out what makes\nyou do the things what you do? And don\u2019t you have any regret? Do you have a conscience?\nWhat do you expect after this, from what you do? I had free talks with them. So I never had been\narrested, or told you go with me. They left me like I had some strange aurea, or angel like thing\naround me, because I was too strong for them. And all -- I always had that.",
        "A: I cannot remember really. The main thing was that they were my age. They were just also\nstudents, in whatever field. Very pleasant, very decent, very polite. I spoke Berlinner German,\nthat is what they told me, I don\u2019t know, but I mean that\u2019s, you know, like perfect. Like Oxford\nEnglish. That\u2019s what I learned, Oxford English, because the teacher came from Oxford. So he\ntalked like that, too. And the French was like Parisian French. So you go to Paris, I have been in\nParis, and they don\u2019t understand you. That\u2019s the funny part. Par-Pardon moi? Pardon moi? They\nsay in French. What do I say funny, is that Russian? So then they turned around like I\u2019m an idiot.\nBut that was the way it goes, and then we talked mostly about things that happen in that time. So\nabout what you eat. In those days, the word sex never came up. That is what I thought later, that\nis funny. In this country it\u2019s nothing but sex. Every day you hear about that, or you see it on TV.\nOver there you had no time to think about that, because there was no way, if the boys are hiding,\nthe men are in offices, where do you get that stuff? And obviously, the Dutch are not lesbian. No\nway. So, I mean, that is how you talked about, mostly.",
        "A: No, never. We didn\u2019t exchange names.",
        "A: Was no sense to do it. No, no, it was not what you call -- what 1s that word?",
        "A: Yeah. It was spontaneous. You meet a person, as a group, group girls, group boys, and that\ncan be on -- on the beach, or it can be in a museum, it can be, I mean, wherever you -- you -- you\nmeet, and wherever a person wants to talk. Because this is not always that you get luck. They --\nthey sometimes just walk away from you, because a German in Holland, after all, was very\nweird. What does a German do in the war time -- that is an enemy. So you don\u2019t speak with\nenemies. But I mean, and you -- you had the -- I-like I said before, you had Germans, and they --\nthey were shot at themselves. So they were eager to talk with us, so that we could feel that they\nwere not enemies, but wi -- they were forced to be an enemy. That -- that was the fascination that\nI always felt. So I always said, \u201cWell, after the war, you\u2019re still my friend.\u201d But see then, an\nNSB-er would not approve that. So you had to be careful in that group, that you was not with an\nNSB-er. As a matter of fact, when -- when we were as Girl Scouts in the woods, and we -- we\nlistened letzer ramaphone in Dutch is it -- where you play --",
        "A: A record player, okay. We had the record player, with Irish dances, Scottish dances, and we --\nwe were just doing that as a pleasure, as -- as a meeting on the -- that you -- that you learn\nsomething. But then, one day, there was a group of those NSB girls. Of course, they were\nageressive, and said to us, \u201cYou are not supposed to listen to that.\u201d So we said to them, \u201cWho\ntells you to say that we are not listening? We are if we want to.\u201d So then they started to fight.\nAnd I still remember I had a girl with a hand on her hair, I twisted her hair -- I still have a whole\nbunch of that -- and -- and poked her on the floor, and hit her, and kicked her, and they found out\nthat we were not sissies. So they -- they disappeared in the woods, hollering, yelling. And we\nstill listened to the music, and we still were dancing. Can you believe that you have that here? Oh\nyeah, w-we -- I learned a lot, and I had not even studied karate yet. I did that here, just for the\nheck of it. But our fists -- I learned if you have a lot of rings, you can do more damage than there\n-- no rings, so we had always rings on. Well that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a certain weapon that the Germans\nused, to club you down. They had the -- the metal thing, you know? Cruel, but so what.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what I say, I had no fear. And they were not that type. They were s -- just regular\nsoldier boys from farms, or nice families. They were decent. So you -- you -- you -- you could\nsay anything you want, because they would not do it. And that\u2019s what I felt with them. They\nhave no intention, because they rather talk with us, than their own creeps who were so fanatic.\nKall, kill, kill. They were not that way. Otherwise, they would not be on the beach, period. But\nthey had to be away from all the nasty stuff that they got back in their barracks. See?",
        "A: No. No, no. I told them from the beginning, if they ask me for a date -- now, you have to\nunderstand, you have that uniform. If I get caught in that uniform, I know what to expect. So\nplease, don\u2019t pretend I\u2019m stupid. And then they left. They say, \u201cYou are right.\u201d But if I was\nforced, they would not have had me alive, because I am not being forced to do what I don\u2019t want\nto do. See, that boy that we had in the house was forced. We had to.",
        "A: He -- he was --",
        "A: -- blonde, he was young. I think he was 22. He had a farm close to Hambush, and if he was\nonly -- if he alwa -- always came back with something. Butter, eggs, whatever. And my father\nwas, of course, mad. He didn\u2019t want to accept it. I says to my father, \u201cDon\u2019t be a stupid, that 1s\neating stuff. Who cares where it comes from?\u201d But, he had always girlfriends -- of course, in that\nage, it\u2019s understandable, who wanted to talk with him. So my father would say either he was not\nhome, or my father would not understand the person that called. He ha -- said it is the wrong\nnumber. I had once a girl in front of the house, and I stood opposite her, I said, \u201cDo you like to\nfight with me?\u201d So she understood that I was not a doozie, either. So he didn\u2019t have girls coming\nto the house, we warned him. Don\u2019t even attempt. You are just tolerated. And you will be happy\nthat you still living, because we could have cut your head off, put it under the house. Who was to\nfind that out? You could have been hit on the way to the barracks. There is no proof.",
        "A: No. Absolutely not.",
        "A: Well, the army sent him. See, everybody had to have a soldier, because there were not enough\nbarracks. And maybe it was to spy. To see what kind of family he would live with. So, you\nknow, you\u2019re not stupid. If you have an enemy in your house, you are very careful. So I don't\nknow if my father was listening to the BBC. In the meantime he left, because of course, they\nhave to work, they o -- they don\u2019t sit in -- in a small room, six by six like a prison, and do\nnothing. It\u2019s a 22 year old, full of pep, and -- and -- and likes to do all kind of physical stuff. But,\nI mean, you just had to tolerate. And he -- he would come any time of the day, what pleased him,\nand you had to tolerate that. Now, our house w -- most houses in -- in Holland, has a stairway. So\nyou -- you -- you have the living room, and then you go upstairs to the -- to -- to the bedrooms,\nthat\u2019s the way it -- it -- it is all built there. So, we didn\u2019t have to meet him, if he stayed in his\nroom, and we stayed downstairs, there was no way, you know, unless he wanted to talk. But he --\nhe was, of course told by his superiors, don\u2019t ming -- don\u2019t mix. Strictly observe. That -- that\u2019s --",
        "A: No. No, he ate in the barracks. The only way that he was with us, was to sleep, yeah. He -- he\nwas showed souvenirs of stuff. I said, I\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t want it. He asked me out, I said no. Just\nlike that. But he understood that. He was a very nice boy. I wish I could have dated him then.\nOh. But you got to resist it. I had to.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, very. Germans are a very attractive -- no, really. They have the -- the type of jaw. They\nha -- blonde hair. They have that smile full with white teeth. I mean, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not, you know,\nwhat do you call it -- maybe I\u2019m a -- a witch, but I have my emotions, I have my feelings, and\nI\u2019m always in love. I\u2019m in love with everybody.",
        "A: But don\u2019t -- don\u2019t tell me you cannot do this, because then I say, \u201cAha, you watch. I do it.\u201d\nAnd I make it that I do it. And that\u2019s the only reason that I\u2019m still living, probably, because they\nthought she -- she has something about her, you better not fool around with her. I had an -- in my\nkarate school, a guy -- now, at the time I was 65, I was the oldest of that -- in -- in Foster\u2019s High\nSchool. I made a side back kick. He could not come back in two weeks. My teacher told me that.\nI said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know that,\u201d because you\u2019re not supposed to look, you just kick whatever you\ncan kick. And if he was in my way, tough with him. But I didn\u2019t know that. So, you know, you\nuse your elbow. How? You use your hands for taking this thing, so that you have no -- no breath.\nYou learn those things. We had a -- a survival course in the Netherlands, with -- with the Girl\nScouts. And boy, did I work that out beautiful. Because you practiced on each other. Now, if you\n-- if you went too far, you would hear something. The teacher would then say, \u201cOh, you good. Y-\nYou -- you -- you graduate.\u201d If that\u2019s the word. So, I mean, that\u2019s why my grip is still so firm. If\nI have a hand, they say, \u201cGosh, are you 80?\u201d They didn\u2019t believe that. Because that is still in you.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no. You didn\u2019t go that far.",
        "A: No, no. No, no. You did not make yourself emotional.",
        "A: If that person was nice, that was it, the end of the story. It was too dangerous. Can you believe\nhe was involved? Then -- then your -- your mind is different. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s the whole thing.\nYou -- you can be very strong, in a certain way, but you got to keep that path. Because, if you go\nanother way, you are lost.",
        "A: Instinct. Survival instinct, I think. Because I have been very sexy looking. And I have been\napproached many, many, many times. In -- in that -- oh, I forgot the train, that was another\nmoment, di -- da -- I was looking 1n, a-and -- out of the window, and this soldier comes with his\nhands beside my cheek, against the window, and tried to kiss me. In those days you had those\nshoes with high heels, like a pin. So I go very slowly down, while he was still trying to get my\ncheek, and I took my shoe, and I whacked him against his you know what, banana. So he went\nbackwards on his back, and was yelling, \u201cOw, ow, ow,\u201d because I hit the right spot. And in the\nmeantime, I went da da da da, dat da, dat da, to the other section of the train where were\npassengers. So he was finished yelling bloody murder, and then he went also in that, to find me.\nBut he has never seen my face. So I sat there between people, looking around like what? Who?\nMe? Don\u2019t know nothing. So he -- he looked at me, but he didn\u2019t know that was me.",
        "A: Of course. You cannot give yourself away. But I -- when he left, I laughed my head off. I\nlaughed that the next two passenger looked at me like I was [indecipherable]. Then I told that\nperson. He said, \u201cYou dared to do that?\u201d That\u2019s all I heard, \u201cYou dared to do that?\u201d I said, \u201cI\ndare, if I have to.\u201d",
        "A: Well, not everybody\u2019s strong. See, if you have a strong mind, it is -- it has to do with la --\nreligion, and my family has a strong -- we have P-Presbyterian, and -- and you cannot tell me\nyou want to become a Jew, or you want to be -- that is just not the way. You have to believe first.\nAnd if right is right, and wrong is wrong, that\u2019s just it. You don\u2019t ask questions, you live with\nthat. And that\u2019s why my f -- my father\u2019s family was also very strong, and were with this religion,\nor whatev -- but we stuck to that, and it gives you inner strength. And I have never had fear. I tell\nyou, I have no fear for biting dogs. I had once -- I was nine years old, and my father visited a\nfriend, and he had a dog in a -- 1n a -- in a cage, and in Dutch, beware of dog. So, my father was\nthere, and I looked around, right inside. And the dog was not doing anything. So I was there, my\narms around the dog\u2019s head, and I kissed the dog. I was so -- so happy with that dog. So my\nfather was finished, he look for me, and the owner of the dog got a fit. He said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t you\nread that sign?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I read it. So what?\u201d Your -- I was nine years old, already so -- and\nthe dog did nothing, absolute nothing. So my father said to that man -- maybe it was my father\u2019s\nfriend, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t make such a fuss about it. She 1s good with him. She is -- she is always\ngood with animals.\u201d And I had once a dog that attacked me, and I had my fist -- now, you always\nhave your thumb inside, not outside, but inside, and I put my fist in his mouth. Not, then the teeth\ncannot reach each other, so he was stuck. And then I grabbed him with the back, and I lifted him\nup, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t try it again, buddy.\u201d So I took my hand out. Boy, did he go fast. He was\nscared. Because I did that, nobody else had done it. So that -- that is the way I am.

        "A: Attitude. If they -- if they tell us not to do certain bad things, you listen. And their example is\na fact. If -- if you beat a person, you know it\u2019s bad, but there must be a reason for doing that. So\nwhy would you do it in the first place, unless you are provoked, or attacked, or whatever reason.\nBut that\u2019s the only way you are allowed to do that, because the Bible says, love thy neighbor. It\u2019s\nso simple. But people don\u2019t follow that up. And that\u2019s why you get all that mess in the world.\nWhy -- why would I be mad at the Chinese person, because the Chinese government is doing this\nand that and that? That poor Chinese person doesn\u2019t know a thing about the government, and the\ngovernment tells that person, you shall only have one child, you shall only have two childs --\nchildren. For what? Because the government is influencing. And I had the -- the Indonesian\ngovernment, I had the Dutch government, I had the German government. Nobody tells me what I\ncan or cannot do, if they don\u2019t set their own sample. I never go to church, either. I have been to\nchurch. One time I had a lady, her dress was way here so that you could see her things. Big hat\nwith animal skin type of thing. Then my minister, he went around his wife\u2019s back fooling\naround. So when I was working in National airport, he comes one day to my desk. \u201cLouise, do\nyou remember me?\u201d I says, \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d He says, \u201cYou know what happened?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cMy -- my oldest boy got a car accident and died.\u201d So I grabbed his hand, I said, \u201cIs that\npunishment what you did to your wife is now back to your son?\u201d And he looked at me like, \u201cDid\nyou know what I did then?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I know everything,\u201d I said, \u201cbut keep mouth shut.\u201d He\nwas very impressed. Ha-Ha-Had a gorgeous wife, Barbara. So, no -- nobody 1s perfect, but you\ncannot feel superior either, because you don\u2019t have the right to be. But if a person is suppressed,\nI fight for that person. And I don\u2019t have to ask anybody permission. If -- if you get hit on the --\non the street, I help. I go out, and -- and get myself the dirty, with blood, or whatever. You feel\nthat it\u2019s necessary, unless someone else is stabbing you back, and say, \u201cShe killed him.\u201d Then I\nfight.

But if things happen, then you don\u2019t think any more that is\nbaloney. It happened. And then you start to be careful, and you take measurements. You don\u2019t sit\nback and wait, you act. And that is why, as a Girl Scout, the motto 1s, be prepared. That helped\nme a lot. As a nurse, you always -- you always protect the lesser -- sick minds, or sick body, or\nwhatever, because you are the one 1s nursing that person.

I did everything what a normal girl would not\ndo. But I had that energy.

But th-that was to make -- just\n-- just to relieve yourself, perhaps.",
        "A: Well, it -- it was a kind of conscience that you had. A -- a -- an -- a Boy Scout, and a Girl\nScout is prepared. Your conscience says, if something goes wrong, you -- you -- you find a way\nto correct it. So, it is bettering yourself. We -- we had all those mottoes, we -- we were like a few\nminutes in -- in prayer. That is up to you, to the person to do that. You was not forced to do that,\nbut that was just a way of -- of -- of what happened with the -- with the scouting movement. So, I\nmean, it -- 1t was normal, it was not particular odd thing, 1t was just the way it happened.",
        "A: Okay, it was in a way that you had a choice. It was not like the Nazis did, you had to. You\ncould do it. Lots of things we did to get a badge, for instance. You get a swimming badge, you\nget this badge, you get that badge, oh, my arm was full of badges. So that 1s a kind of giving a\nbone to a dog that does a trick. That\u2019s the way I feel it. But the leader was very good in that,\nbecause she was, as a Red Cross person, aware that not everybody was capable. You -- you have\npeople, they are not strong, you have people they are playing a coward, doesn\u2019t admit it. But\nthat\u2019s the way they are.

And my uncle, as I\ntold you, was betrayed because he had said too much, so he was picked up at five in the morning,\nand go to Auschwitz. What -- I didn\u2019t know at that time, I found it out when I was on vacation.\nAnd the Red Cross, after the war, gave my mother the possessions, like a pocketbook, or\nsomething, notebook, that was with his name on it.

And we\nhad off on Wednesday afternoons, so whatever time you had -- of course, as a nurse, I was in\nanother city anyway, but then you would contact people connected with the same scouting\norganization, in that\u2019s -- particular spot. But as a nurse, as I told you, I had two -- two shi-shifts,\nin those days the bombs were ru-running around like crazy, so I had no time.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Well, I remember that I had a bunch of Jewish kids, and we -- we spent time to get their star\noff of their costume, and then we told the kids what would happen to them. And we would\ncontact the parents of those kids, and they would approve. And we -- we gave them food, as I\nsaid, we -- we saved the coupons, and we would feed them. We would find homes where they\ncould stay without that someone would be betrayed. So, it is a matter of making connections, and\nstick to those connections that you could trust. And if -- if one -- one child was then already\nunder way to Great Britain, you would get another child instead. So it -- 1t was a matter of -- of\nplanning, and timing, because one had to do this first, in order to do that. And it -- 1t was\ncommunication, and if you would hear something that was different, you would say that. I mean,\nif would be something being fouled up, because something happened unpredictable that -- that\nyou didn\u2019t count on that would happen. That was your duty too, that you would say that,\nimmediately, so that that person could change quick things around, but that -- that child would be\nstill safe, see? So, 1-it was, in a way, working together, absolute like sisters, that you could trust\nany person, without any hesitation. And if I would have found a person -- this -- this 1s for\ninstance, my -- my uncle\u2019s death notice, then you would report that, and that person would get\nsome -- I don\u2019t know what treatment, but they were kicked out.

So, I\nhave never found out how that happened, because I was not told, see? But I knew that they\nwould reach their goal, because then from the BBC, you would hear that certain families had\narrived safely. And then you would say ahhhhh, like that, you know? You would be so happy,\nbecause you -- you did something, that was accomplished.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And then that -- that particular family was still in Holland. So they got their turn\nto go, and meet their kids there. It was very, very -- how shall I put that? It -- 1t was something\nthat you didn\u2019t hesitate to do it. It -- 1t was something like sleeping, and eating, and drinking.\nAnd if you had to work, okay, that was the first thing. I mean, as a nurse, I had to do that, what --\nwhat the hospital told me to do. But in your spare time, you did things like that. You had no time\nto -- to play Monopoly, or whatever. It -- 1t was just to save as many lives as you could do that.\nAnd you didn\u2019t ask any thanks in w -- in -- in return. I cannot remember faces, I cannot\nremember names.

So you are put in a\nward with nothing but nude, embarrassed guys. One had the banana like this, one had like a\npeanut, one had nothing. You know, and they feel bad about me, because I was a 19 year old,\nfresh kid that 1s supposed to touch the guy, and wash it. So, I mean, I learned with a big shock,\nlike oh my God, what did I do now, you know? But you -- you -- you learn to just accept it, and -\n- and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s your job, you know?

If they\nhad a tattoo, you was aware that was a baby that was taken from a Jewish home, or from\nAuschwitz. In those days, everything was chaos, unpredictable, you didn\u2019t know if the stories\nwhat went around was rumor or truth. But you had to do what the nurse is supposed to do. We\nhad no coffins any more, for instance. Coffins were out of the question, because there was no\nwood. So we wrapped dead body in a cloth or paper, and -- and then it was -- if you know. Yeah,\nin my ward were many, many who -- who died, and was very emotional, but what can you do,\nyou know, you\u2019re not God.",
        "A: That was not the rule, cause everybody in Holland was undernourished. If you was fat, I was\nsupposed to be fat, okay? That has to do with the type of food, you only had soup. Anything\nwhat you ate was soup. And if you know medical structure of a person\u2019s body, it -- it sets in your\n-- in your skin, it sets in your nerves, it sets in your -- in your fat -- you call it edemish. You put a\n-- a thumb on someone\u2019s skin, and it would stay. So that means that is an impression of a person\nthat has too much fluid in the body. And that was the only food you had anyway, so what can\nyou do? I had pea soup, I had this soup, I had that soup, I -- but at least you had soup. You -- you\n-- you went out to the street, and get the leaves from the trees, cook them, that was soup. People\ndon\u2019t understand that here, because you have so -- everything, you know? You have so much\nchoice. When I went in the store after the -- the -- that we came from Holland, I couldn\u2019t believe\nmy eyes.

It was amazing. But so what? It was all vitamins, perhaps.",
        "A: Fantastic. Very s -- very strong. If you were sick, you had no chance. So that again, is in your\nmind, don\u2019t get sick, because then you\u2019re not effective. And, as a nurse, I chose that profession.\nIt sounds -- it sounds -- what is that word? Egoistisha --",
        "A: Egoistic. Self preservent. But that\u2019s the only place you got food. And really, I had farmers,\nthey visited their -- their family when they were sick, and they were prepared to give us\npancakes, so I had -- you know, your uniform is with white, huh? I had five pancakes here, and\nthat\u2019s greasy stuff. So the -- just the -- the -- on uniforms, nothing but grease dripping, but\nnobody said anything, everybody was laughing, because you did it. And if someone said, \u201cI hope\nI\u2019m out of this.\u201d Oh, here. No a -- no questions asked. I was once in a place where you have the\nlatrines, had the -- the bedpans. So I come in running, you always ran to, and then s-stapled up\nthree, and -- and -- on each other, that\u2019s always the way you have to be strong. And th-the ward\u2019s\nhead nurse, I hated her, but 1t was so funny. I tell you, I was laughing, and I dropped all those\nbedpans on the floor, because I got a fit from laughing, and that\u2019s me, you know, then -- and she\nstood there, a huge woman, six foot something, and really big. And she had both cheeks like this,\nand I asked her something. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a nasty person, I asked her because I knew she couldn\u2019t\ntalk. So, she opened her mouth with that yellow stuff coming out of her teeth from the egg, and\nshe said, \u201cGet back.\u201d I said, \u201cI want to ask you something.\u201d I stood there, I didn\u2019t go out. I just\nput her on the spot. Oh, did she hated me. So I asked her the question, she could not answer,\nunless all that egg was first out. So I went back to the ward, I\u2019m washing out the\n[indecipherable]. And I had curfew, you could not go out certain time, and you had to bay -- b --\nbe back in a certain time, too. Yeah, you stopping?\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: We didn\u2019t expect nothing, because things happened which you didn\u2019t expect. Simple.\nEverything was unpredictable. In -- in a war, you cannot plan anything. If you plan something,\nthen something around you happens, and then you have to change, so you just live what you call\nday by day, minute by minute. And if nothing happens, fine, you was lucky.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. Because they knew that the hospital was my future. I mean, I was a student,\nyou have to learn lots of things. You -- you are a involved with lifes, and medication. I mean,\nyou could not be distracted from what actually the goal of your life was. And I felt that, as a\nnurse, you could use it for later, if the war was finished, for whatever purpose. I still have use for\nit, because it\u2019s the experience you get. I know how to treat it, I know how to treat that. I never\nwalk to a doctor. So, it -- it is very -- you know, it -- it is -- it is a nice occupation, that you can\nuse.",
        "A: No, no, because I -- I saw like a girlfriend went on her bike, from one point -- from -- of the\ncity to another, and she got hit by -- by a -- an -- a shell, and what can you do? I mean, I didn\u2019t\neven know she was there, but you hear that later on, you know, sometimes months later. But you\n-- you -- you can cry, but you cannot change it. So, it -- it was shocking.

Haupfrau Rita --\nactually name is Maria Katarina Burgenberra-deyong. You can keep this, or -- or copy it. She\nwas born the first of August, and she died 22\" -- on the 12\" of August, in \u201995. Now this is her\nsister, who wrote it to me. Her sister lives on that address, because in \u201995, of course, I was here.\nBut she might have names, and -- and -- and addresses from people fr-from that time. Now this is\nmy uncle, that\u2019s the sit -- the brother of my mother. He died at Auschwitz concentration camp, in\n1941. See, I -- I hope to write a book, if I find a person that can help me out, because I have not\nthe slightest idea how to start, but that\u2019s why I made all those notations, yeah. I was in that -- that\nis -- that is a school of -- home economics 1s that in English. So I did that before I went as a\nnurse. You -- you made cakes from tulip bulbs, spinach from tree leaves. You had no butter, you\nhad no sugar, no chocolate. There were no coffins, bodies were wrapped in paper. Now, that was\nin \u00b042, so it\u2019s -- it started to become nasty. In the beginning you didn\u2019t notice much, but it -- it\nbuilded up, because we were resisting. If we didn\u2019t resist, everything would have been more\npleasant. No heat in the house, which in the bedroom was frozen this thick. Oh yeah, then here I\nwas in the staff of the kitchen, in moylon that 1s that house for old people. And then I was in the\ntrain to The Hague, when German tried to kiss me while I stood at window. Smashed with high\nheeled shoe in his banana. And then I saw a blitzed plane that was shot down, and the pilot was\nstill in his seat, but he was black, ashed, you know? And then you would put your finger against\nthat, and your finger would have the ash, like on Ash Wednesday. That\u2019s -- the Catholics do. But\nhe was still intact, was amazing. Yeah, and -- and the German said, \u201cOkay, you can see it.\u201d",

        "A: No, no, no, no, no. See, this Girl Guide stuff was before I went as a nurse.",

        "A: No, no, no, no, no, never. I only, because I\u2019m so inquisitive, I find out things. But I did not\nwant to let her feel that I was investigating, 1t was just that I was curious, I wanted to know.",
        "A: In -- in -- in those days, you didn\u2019t do things, if a person didn\u2019t want you to do it, because she\nhad a highly sensitive position. If -- if -- with the Red Cross, that that is international, you have\nto be very careful. So she -- she -- I think she never told anybody that she was a Girl Scout leader\nto begin with, that would have been so stupid. But if you deal with -- with -- with kids, so what,\nwho cares what you do? You know, you play with them, and you keep them happy, and -- and --\nand -- and don\u2019t ask for political things. So, no, I -- I was not that close with her. She was what\nyou call a very strict disciplinarian, what was good, and that\u2019s maybe why she made me the way\nI am, but I had the greatest respect, and you did not backtalk with her. She was that type of\nperson, oh yeah.",

If -- if you like a person a lot, that you\nnickname in -- in a nice way, sweet, you know, lovable. So, I think we invented that name.\nMaybe she didn\u2019t like it, but she never said that she didn\u2019t like it.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: No, because see, then I moved. I never finished my -- my nursing exam, because it was chaos,\nand as I told you, I was 1n love, the heck with the exam, so I -- I never got my degree. But I feel,\nif you have experience, that should do it. And the hockey stuff also, they -- they kept writing, and\nsending pictures with. It is impossible, because here, not only you immigrate, but you are all of a\nsudden bang, in everything, you know. Because you are new, and you meet people, they want to\nknow everything about you. So I -- I was a celebrity, and as I told you, I did all those courses.\nYou -- you\u2019re just having a job, taking care of your boys, your husband needs to be fed, he\ndoesn\u2019t do a darn thing, he didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t do the -- the yard, or anything, so I kicked him out.\nCan you believe that, he said, \u201cIf we come to the States, you are not allowed to learn how to\ndrive a car.\u201d So, I waited until he went to his job in Washington National Airport, with United\nAirlines, and I looked in the Yellow pages, and I called someone that is offering driving lessons.\nSo there\u2019s a guy, gives me seven lessons for five dollars per hour. I went solo to D.C., came out\nalive, back home. And I said to my husband, \u201cI did it.\u201d Boy, he was exploding. Then, I was not\nallowed to get a job. So, when he went to work, I went with my car, where my new license,\nparked in the parking lot, went inside, with my little ad I found. They needed a person for Mutual\nof Omaha. So I knocked at the door, the guy opens the door, he said, \u201cOh, you want a job, you\nare hired.\u201d And I stayed for 31 years. I still see him, and write Christmas cards, and talk with his\nwife. She is Scottish, he\u2019s -- he is American, they live in Alexandria. But I always asked him, I\nsaid, \u201cWhat did you see in me? Why did you hire me so fast?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause you acted\ncute.\u201d And his wife was laughing. She said, \u201cYeah, I think same way.\u201d And I saw the romance in\nthe airport, because he always went to her counter. I said to him, \u201cUh-uh, that\u2019s not the way to\ngo, that\u2019s the way to go, that\u2019s your office.\u201d",
        "A: That seems to be the way it happens. Because I never thought why I would not work to help\nmy kids to go to college, or to get something for the house, or -- I mean, I\u2019m not a slave, but I\nshowed him that I was not a doormat, either, even I was married to him. So he was upset. He\nsaid, \u201cYou don\u2019t obey me.\u201d I said, \u201cFor what? I\u2019m not in Indonesia.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s the way I am.",
        "A: Yeah, but that\u2019s different.",
        "A: That is an order that makes sense, that has a purpose. But to say you cannot drive, just for the\nfact that I\u2019m your wife, the hell with you. E-Everybody drives. How can you -- how can you\nwalk from one point to the other? And I hate buses. I hate to be dependent on something. I\u2019m a\nvery in-independent person. And if you say you cannot do this, I say, I do it. That -- that has been\nmy whole life. And my father can tell you that too, if he was still living, because that is just the\nway I am. And maybe it\u2019s because of all the stuff that I have experienced, that it -- that 1t made\nme that -- that way.",
        "A: I only listen if you are nice, if you say it in a way, can you please do this, then I do it.",
        "A: I felt is an honor. An honor that I was asked to do that, and I would do a good job about it. Of\ncourse, you don\u2019t have the schooling, you have no experience. You do the -- the way -- the best\nthat you can do it, but if 1t comes out right, then you get a medal. And you win -- you win TV\u2019s\nand stuff like that, I think. That is it, an -- an accomplishment. But I don\u2019t do anything just\nbecause they ask. It has to have common sense first.

I never really had a close\ncall. I could have been killed many times, but because of -- of the intuition, or the insight feeling\nthat you get about a certain happening, or a certain person, I think that\u2019s the warning, and then\nyou just be careful.",
        "A: Maybe -- maybe -- yeah, maybe that twofee, too, that got a shell in the house. You could say\nthat is a close call. But see, I don\u2019t see it that way, because the mattress was between the shell,\nand the shell stuck in -- in the roof, and didn\u2019t go down, didn\u2019t fall all the way, see, so -- and then\n-- and then we -- and that was funny, too. We were -- we were moved -- that -- that\u2019s also\ngovernment ordered, because the house was impossible to fix. So we moved to a family, and\nthey had the pear tree, full of pears, in -- in their yard. Now, in those days, if you had that guy\u2019s\npear, you got shot at. So, his son -- I never forget that, but his son was about my age, too, he was\nalways in the kitchen door with the rifle. I said to him, \u201cHey, you have nothing better to do?\u201d But\n-- but -- but -- but what I do go get you a pear. I wouldn\u2019t even touch it, but I can look at it.\nYeah, you have crazy people.

        "A: I think the experience is the training. You do something, and then see what will happen. And\notherwise, the student stuff was experience, and -- and you learn how to be prepared during\nscouting, and you smash someone\u2019s knees when you -- you -- you play hockey. I wound always\nu-up in -- in -- in the back of the goal, because I was so fast, I couldn\u2019t make myself stop. So\nthey couldn\u2019t find me, and I heard them yelling, \u201cLukie, Lukie, where are you?\u201d And then the --\nwas behind the -- the goal, and I was entangled in -- in -- in the goal net, because I couldn\u2019t get\nout of it. But that was the only way, you know. You -- you kept friends with people that you are\nworking with, or laughing with, or experiencing with. Oh boy, I know I had always fun.

But I mean, that -- that was our\nfamily. Oh boy, and my mother also, she would have her hands over the stove to keep warm, and\nthen we would gossip again about this, because that\u2019s all that you could do in those days, is\ngossip, because you -- you couldn\u2019t do nothing, nothing else.

So I\nhad it -- to find out from my father, who finally talks way after that, but we have never found out\nif he was ill, or that he died in -- in the real gas chambers, what we didn\u2019t know at that time,\neither. Everything was after the war, that you heard about that. And I always thought, how a\nhuman being can invent that. I was absolute perplexed, because a nurse is a nurse. Is healing.\nYou don\u2019t invent all that cruel stuff. You don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t expect that to happen. So, we never\ngot his body. The other uncle, of course, was killed on -- on -- on the tarmac of the airport, so\nthat was a body, but that cousin that was 15 years in a Jap camp, we were told -- again, I don\u2019t\nknow the truth, that he was just killed by -- by not being fed, not getting food, so he was\nmalnutrition.",

He was betrayed. Now, at that\ntime, I didn\u2019t know that. I didn\u2019t know about the under -- other uncle, until later, I was told that\nhe was shot. And then in -- years later, my father mailed that to me, that little thing, and I kept it\nat -- all the time, because it is part of history.

        "A: He was -- no, but he was -- he was secretary of -- of that organization like here the Triple A\nis. But, because of his looks -- he looked younger than the age of a person that was sent to work\nin a German factory. He just -- I think he grew his ber -- beard, or whatever he did, in order to go\nto work without the second experience of being picked up. Because he -- he kept going to the\noffice, to do his job, but he was not done being picked up again. Or maybe he got such a shock\nthat he grow older, I don\u2019t know, but that -- that was happening in those days, so you didn\u2019t see\nman between 16, and I think it was either 45, or 55. So you saw only real old men, and men of\nmy age, you -- you saw after the -- the dark fell in, and then you dared to go out, because I still\ndated somehow. And -- and of course, those boys on the hockey field, they dared to go out and\nplay hockey, even they had the chance to go out to the factory in Germany. But, see y-you got\nbolder by the day. Do you think that you -- you -- you -- you thought that the -- the Germans\ncould do all those things, yo-you just thought they were -- they were mentally sick and said those\nthings, but you didn\u2019t obey them, you laughed in their face. Yeah, you can laugh now, but that\u2019s\nhow I lost a lot of boyfriends. I remember I was in love with a -- with a guy, and he always tried\nto bring me home. And then all of a sudden, I went back to play hockey, and he was not there. So\nsomeone said yeah -- what was his name again? I forgot. But he was the guy that went via\nBelgium, and France, and the Pyrenee, and -- and Spain, to England, and then he got caught in --\nin that time, but I have never found out how he got caught. That was just one of those news that\nyou picked up, and you knew that was the guy that you liked so much. So it was -- 1t was very\ntragic. That\u2019s why it was difficult to have your emotions pointed at something, because it never\nlasted. And -- and you had no control about anything. If you tried to, you -- you had to change\nwith a grudge, but so what, it changes, and there is nothing you can do about it. That is just the\nend of that period. So I think I grew faster for my age than any person here in the United States\never will, because of all the pain there, that you endured, and I was too strong to admit it. But I\ngot stronger, I could feel that.",

For instance, they -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re not -- new in this\ncountry, so they don\u2019t know laws. So the other day, their dog goes out without the leash. I said to\nthe guy, \u201cYou better watch out that the policeman is not passing, because you get hundred\ndollars fine, and you might have that the dog will be impounded.\u201d And he asked me what is --\nwhat is impounded? So he didn\u2019t know that. But now, the -- the dog is with a leash, and he is in\nthe yard, and he is grateful, but he doesn\u2019t show that. It\u2019s just that I felt obligated to protect that\npoor dog, because I love animals, and if that poor -- that Bolivian is not familiar with laws, I\nhave the duty to tell him, to protect that he get in trouble. So they are nice people, very polite.\nBut we -- we don\u2019t do anything voluntarily t-to -- to get more friendly. Let me put it that way.\nThey are on that side of the fence, and I am on this side. Plenty to do. I never sit still.",
        "A: No. Totally out.",
        "A: Nothing. I immigrated.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Well, that was our goal.",
        "A: See, if -- 1f you have no job -- after the war, my husband got an assignment in Indonesia. So\nwe went there for a year, and that was because that airline, Kahouda Indonesian Airline, was\nsupposed to be independent from the KLM, that\u2019s the Dutch company airline. But the\ngovernment did not like the idea that we were living, so we had a notice of 14 days to scram, get\nout. And I was just married, so all my wedding presents I could not pack, was too many. You --\nyou only had the opportunity to pack what you could carry, so that was all behind, so they had a\nball, perhaps with that stuff. The house was empty. We were just literally refugees. So then you\ncome to the -- to the Netherlands, and you have no home, so you are supposed to live with your\nin-laws, and that -- I just explained my father-in-law was, with the Japs hanging -- oh, that was\nhell. So we tried as soon as we could manage, to immigrate. But, you stay on -- on -- on a list.\nYou need to find your own sponsor, no help with that. So we kept looking in newspapers for\nimmigration, and we found a sponsor. Then you need money in order to pay for the trip. We had\nthat. I -- I -- I worked underground, too. I was not allowed to work, but I did. And then finally, in\n1953, we got permission, and we left at April the sixth, after we had that big flood, on January\nthe 31\u201c, that all the dikes were flooded over. I don\u2019t know if you member -- remember that -- I\nhave also a book about that. So, the south part of Holland was absolute water. Water, water, all\nover, and 2,000 people had drowned. Cows, horses, everything was floating, because they had\ndrowned. It was mess. So, we came here in April, and my son was six. Had not learned a word of\nEnglish, because he 1s just like me. That stupid language, I don\u2019t want to learn that. Now, that\nwas in Holland, so we come here, and we have a family from the state department, and they have\nBlack people, real southern Virginian type. And I was supposed to sit with that Black woman. So\nwhat? I said to the lady, \u201c\u201cWhat big fuss about it? Who cares? She is nice.\u201d And then the Black\nwoman says, \u201cYou are more educated than my own boss.\u201d I told her that, I said, \u201cI dress better, I\nhave better manners, I\u2019m polite, and I -- I have more respect for Black people than you do.\u201d That\nwoman was flabbergasted. She said, \u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I just, you know,\nhave my ears open.\u201d But when you was at work, I -- I -- I got someone at the door, and I opened\nthe door, \u201cAre you Mrs. Gardner?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m the housekeeper.\u201d \u201cOh, you look much better\nthan she does.\u201d Now, I didn\u2019t know that guy, he just knocked at the door, so I mean, a -- a -- a --\na -- I already found a lot of things out. And then I found out they were Democrats, so I\u2019m an --\nI\u2019m a Republican.",
        "A: But my son -- April, May, June, July, August, September, learned perfect Virginian slang. So\nhe came in the first grade. Then we had a PTA meeting, and that teacher of that class comes to\nme. \u201cI heard that you was from Holland. How come your son speaks perfect English?\u201d I said,\n\u2018So do I.\u201d She was so impressed, she said, \u201cOh, that is so cute, he speaks so good Virginian.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWell, it\u2019s because he was forced to. In Holland, he refused to learn that.\u201d She said, \u201cI\ncannot believe that.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWell, that\u2019s what he said.\u201d Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. So then -- then he\nwas at school here, and the -- both sons, I said, \u201cIf you are in the door, in the house, it\u2019s only\nDutch spoken. You leave the house, then you can speak all the English you want.\u201d So my\nyoungest became a pilot, he goes to Amsterdam for three days. \u201cAre you American?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d\nsaid my son. \u201cBut you speak Dutch.\u201d \u201cSo what? My mother taught -- told me. She is a\n[inaudible].\u201d Of course, he didn\u2019t dare to say that, but I mean, that -- that was what they thought\nin the -- in Holland, because he spoke fluently Dutch. And it didn\u2019t cost him a penny.",
        "A: And that\u2019s with my oldest son also, if we have a secret language, we speak Dutch.",
        "A: If I get a -- a -- a salesperson over the telephone, I speak Dutch. I had once a guy who spoke\nJapanese, so I spoke Dutch, and I heard him saying something bad in Japanese, but he hang up.",
        "A: We had a map with pins, and listening to the BBC, we changed the pins where they lost. So\nwe knew, looking at the pins, that they lost this part, they lost that part, they lost Poland, they --\nthey lost Danzig. The Russians were killing them in the east of -- of Germany. In Belgium were\ncertain battles lost. The battle of Arnhem, you see the -- you saw maybe in the movies about that.\nSo we -- we didn\u2019t have to notice it, you just looked, or listened, and that is how you got the\nnerve to do some certain things that you didn\u2019t dare to do. And that is why we knew that wi --\nthey were, you know, sent to th-the west coast, that is [indecipherable], and that was the -- the\narea where the underground had the -- settled, and there they had to leave all their fur coats that\nthey were snatching, and -- and radios, and whatever. All -- all the luxury stuff that was stolen,\nthey had to leave it there. And they are -- they were -- I think, but I -- I cannot be sure about it,\nstripped from all their whatever, paraphernalia, on their arms, because of ranks, and stuff. So\nthey walked for two or three hours, to their country, as a private. You didn\u2019t notice if a colonel,\nwhatever. We just got them s -- so far down that they were not looking us in the face any more.",
        "A: And that is why we also snapped those girls that we knew had dated. And we put them on a\ntable, and that\u2019s all facts, it\u2019s not that I invent that -- on the table, with a razor here, and razed off,\nfell on the floor. Other young people of my age threw tomatoes in their faces, rotten eggs. We\nsaved it all up for that purpose. And then, of course, they were also -- I don\u2019t know, I was not\nthere to -- to witness that. Cause what happened after that, I don\u2019t know, if they were molested,\nor -- or raped, or -- I -- I just don\u2019t know that.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. Because, as I told you, I was still a nurse. I was still in the hospital, and what I\nknow 1s either from newspaper news, or in -- in -- 1n the radio at the time, then you had the nerve\nto listen to your own radio. But see, the radio was still German minded, so it was not the way\nthat you could believe it. But when the radio became Dutch again, that was where you listened\nto, and that was honest.",
        "A: No, no. Oh, I saw that --",
        "A: Oh, I saw that on pictures.",
        "A: As I told you, you went to the movies to watch the news, and that is why I thought Hodsen\nlooks funny, but she had no hair, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, you got punished. But see, I was co -- not connected with\nthose, so they -- they to me were like rotten apples. You don\u2019t talk to them, you don\u2019t want to see\nthem. You have no interest in what -- what happened to them. But you find it out from either\nnews, but you don\u2019t -- you know, that -- that you just happen to see, and then you are surprised.\n[indecipherable] is that -- is that the Dutch way to do things, with the -- officially it was. Dutch\npeople are not angels, either. They are nasty.",
        "A: That is hard to tell, because also, that was gradually. See, a Dutch person does not want to\nmake a big deal about some event. It\u2019s all hush-hush, and underground. So, if they were picked\nup, I think their uniforms were stripped off first, and they looked like a normal person again.\nThat 1s what happened. So, if you meet a person, then you have no suspicion that -- that is not a\nDutch person, but he might be a German. Because he doesn\u2019t talk, you don\u2019t know. Because\nGermans and -- and -- and -- and Dutch people look very much the same. You look Dutch too.\nNo, really. I mean, that\u2019s the way it is. They\u2019re all blonde, and they have the same expressions,\nrosy cheeks, and even the way they walk is the same.",
        "A: I -- I know the difference between someone -- someone from Asia, or someone from the midst\nof Europe, and I -- I always ser -- say here, if someone complains, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you visit\nKosovo?\u201d Then you get a better opinion. I hate that, you know, people complaining because the\nweather is lousy, or whatever. Don\u2019t complain. Go as a volunteer, and help there. That\u2019s my\nanswer. And w -- that -- that is what I hope that the government finally will change, and do that,\ntoo, because there 1s a -- a need so badly, and -- and there is a need for -- for peace between those\nArabs. I said to an Arab once, because I still talk with all -- all kinds of religions, \u201cWhy is it that\n-- that women are treated so lousy in your country? They -- they have a veil, they cannot be\nseen.\u201d I said, \u201cIf I was in your country, the heck with you. I come the way I am, and if you want\nto arrest me, I don\u2019t even go to your country. So if you want to make friends, be normal, be -- be\nthe time of what we live, 2000. You don\u2019t live in the Bible years. It makes sense.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhat -\n- what rights do you have with your beard, and your funny little thing over here to say those\nthings? Because you happen to be an Arab? I have no respect for that. I have respect if you treat\nyour wife in the way she should be treated, and otherwise, bye.\u201d",
        "A: I was having my shift finished, and I hear a lot of commotion, and I hear tanks coming in, and\nI run outside, because I have been told that you could sit on one of those. No dice, they were\nalready full. Oh, it was hysterical funny. But you walked beside them, and you threw whatever\nyou could threw at them, and -- and say in English -- I was an interpreter then, too, \u201cOh, we are\nso happy to see you. You have not the slightest idea.\u201d \u201cOh yeah,\u201d said one soldier, very casual,\n\u201cWhat do you think we\u2019re doing here now?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, I think you call that liberation.\u201d",
        "A: They were Palestinian. But see, in those days, they were on the British thing, so -- yeah, and\nCanadians, that\u2019s why I have that book. Because they ask me to become a member, that was also\none of those big honor things. And I was -- oh, I had every week a different boyfriend. I had a --\na sergeant, I had a lieutenant colonel. But the funny thing is, they all were very much in -- like\nthe -- the sergeant, I could not go to a party, if that party was nothing but lieutenants, because of\nhis rank. So I had once that I made a blunder, and I -- I took him to one of those parties, and he\nwas hiding under the table, because he couldn\u2019t show himself. And then he was so -- so feeling\nbad, he drank, drank, drank, so he was loaded, he -- he -- he couldn\u2019t talk any more, so I\nremember I took him under the armpit, and like a sled, I got him outside the door, in the street,\nand then he woke up because of the cold. And the other boyfriend, the lieutenant, yelled at me,\nwhat are you doing with that bum? I said, \u201cWell, he needs fresh air.\u201d See, I -- I was the type, I\ndidn\u2019t care less if he was a sergeant, or a private, or a lieutenant, because I\u2019m a baroness, I have a\ntitle. So I don\u2019t have to feel like, you know, act like a snob, because I was a snob by birth.",
        "A: Yeah, but can you help it? When I came here, I had to renounce it in the court. I said to the\njudge, \u201cWhat a waste of time.\u201d And he looked at me like, \u201c\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I said, \u201cIf you are\nborn a baroness, you can tell me to renounce it, and I say you\u2019re a nice judge, but I cannot\nrenounce myself, I am born that way.\u201d So then he w -- he -- he thought, \u201cYeah, she makes a lot\nof sense.\u201d So he laughed. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re funny.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I know I\u2019m funny.\u201d But the\nother person, she was a baroness from -- I think it was Denmark. Yeah. She i -- she is from a\nfamous Danish -- of course, we know all -- all -- like in England, who is duke, and who 1s lord,\nand whatever. My uncle was with the House of Lords, so y-you know you brought up in that, and\nyou don't know any better. So, she was a baroness -- what\u2019s that again, and -- and she poked me.\nShe said, \u201cDo you talk like that all the time?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the way I am.\u201d Because she\nwas brought up very stiff, you know, don\u2019t talk, don\u2019t talk. But her husband was American. And\nso he said, \u201cYeah, I can understand.\u201d What -- whatever happens in the court is not always, you\nknow. Well, they think it 1s, but it doesn\u2019t make sense. What\u2019s the point, you go to court, and\nrenounce your own title? It\u2019s so stupid, because you cannot do anything with it. It doesn\u2019t cost\nany money. It doesn\u2019t hurt anybody. It\u2019s just a name.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t even start. They don\u2019t want to hear it. No, they don\u2019t want to hear it. They -- it\u2019s -- it is\njust a generation that feels it is not concerning them. They are not interested, they have their --\ntheir own soccer team, and whatever. They\u2019re very occupied. My -- my son is now a coach for --\nfor a soccer team, and they played with a Dutch soccer team from the embassy. Oh boy, he is so\n-- so that -- that is big deal, and I feel if you are together, it should be happy, and because of that\noc-occasion, and if they want to know, they can ask. But they never do. And I feel well, that\u2019s\ntheir tough luck, they don\u2019t know what they are missing. But maybe it\u2019s good, cause it\u2019s nothing\nbut sad, sad, sad. And they don\u2019t like me to be very -- how shall I put it, with -- with a -- with a\nface like suffering and stuff, because that\u2019s not the way we are. We are all happy. And I keep it\nthat way. And what was happened in the past, it happened in the past. I live with that.",
