        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nconducted by Peggy Frankston, with Mrs. Lucie Ragin, on July 23\", 2009, in\nNew York City, for the Rivesaltes Internment Camp Memorial Museum. Good\nmorning Mrs. Ragin.",
        "Answer: Yes, ma \u2014 good morning. My name is Lucie Ragin, I was born Lucie\nLaya(ph) Saltz, and my parents felt that Zalc, z-a-l-c, but Saltz, s-a-I-t-z is also\nhow it\u2019s spelled. And I was born in Antwerp, Belgium, February 27, 1935. And my\nmother and father were very loving parents. My father\u2019s name was David Saltz,\nand my mother\u2019s name was Miriam Clara Saltz. And they already had a son, his\nname is Andre Zalc, Abraham Zalc. And we were a very happy family, and\nAntwerp is a beautiful ci \u2014 city by \u2014 by the ocean. And my aunt and uncle lived in\nthe same town in a ver \u2014 1n a Jewish community there, we lived. And my aunt and\nuncle had a bakery. And that\u2019s the only family we really had. Most of my father\u2019s\nfamily was in Poland, and my mother had some family left in Latvia, Russia, and\n\u2014 which we never met, but we were very close to my family, my mother\u2019s aunt and\nuncle \u2014 ma \u2014 my aunt and uncle, and I always would go there as a little girl and on\nthe holidays and we \u2014 my mother and \u2014 would make wine with her sister, and I \u2014 I\nloved the goodies in the bakery that they owned, so I always liked to go there. And\nJuly 23, 2009\nwe were very happy family and all of a sudden they said it wouldn\u2019t be good for the\nJewish people to stay in Antwerp because the war was broke \u2014 breaking out. So my\nparents and my aunt and uncle, we decided to leave Antwerp, and we packed\nwhatever we could in a \u2014 1n a rush to leave, and \u2014 for France. And I was a little girl,\nI really didn\u2019t understand too much. I saw people taping the window, because they\nwere afraid that their houses would be bombed, and they put tape on the window so\nit wouldn\u2019t shatter. And we took a duffle bag, whatever we could, and we left by\ntrain to go to France. And I remember the Red Cross in the \u2014 in La Gare, in the\nstation, and they would help all the people and give them hot chocolate and things\nlike that. And when they packed in a rush, one of the scissors that they packed was\nsticking up, and I sat on that bag, and I had to be treated by the Red Cross, and\nthat\u2019s why I remember that incident. And the train went on, and we really didn\u2019t\nknow where we were going in France, and we went towards this \u2014 I guess on the \u2014\nthe southern part of France, and my aunt and uncle were with us, we were all 1-in a\nplace called Brens(ph), which was a camp. And from there we went to Recebedou,\nor vice-versa. And then we ended up in Rivesaltes, which was the worst one, I\nthink, of them all. I remember barbed wire, but I don\u2019t remember \u2014 I think I was\nwearing a Jewish star, but I\u2019m not positive. I was a little girl, and my mother was\npregnant, and it was very hard for her because we didn\u2019t have any food, and we\nJuly 23, 2009\ndidn\u2019t have many things. And whatever she had, she would give to her children.\nAnd I rem \u2014 and my father in camp, he\u2019s \u2014 he knew \u2014 he was a plumber there, they\nused him to do plumbing, and he helped people get out of the camp, and they paid\nhim by giving him like an egg, a tomato, a few potatoes and this way he would\nmake his food. But they were aware of what he was doing, so he had to leave the\ncamp and not come back. He had to leave my mother and me there and not come\nback, because there were \u2014 and every day they would come and they would pick up\nmy mother, I don\u2019t know if it was the Vichy. I remember a German Shepherd also,\nand they would take my mother for questioning, because they thought she knew\nwhere he was, but she didn\u2019t. And I \u2014 I used to see my cousin in camp, and my aunt.\nI don\u2019t remember about my uncle and my boy cousin. But we were very hungry,\nvery, very hungry. There was hardly any food. I know my mother always said if you\ngot like a hundred grams of bread and a little bit of turnip soup and if they punished\nyou, they would take it away from you. That\u2019s what she said. And \u2014 and she was\nalways worried about everybody. And I remember in the camp, they put me in the\nlittle children\u2019s nursery, or whatever, and I would \u2014 I was always crying \u2014 they\ncalled me \u2014 I was always crying, I was always sad, I was a very sad little girl\nbecause I always wanted to be with my mother. And I even had the German measles\nthere, and they put me in the infirmary. And I had the window by \u2014 I slept by the\nJuly 23, 2009\nwindow in the infirmary, and there were other children there, and the mothers\nwould come by the window and they wanted to give things for their children, and I\nwould \u2014 I know I wasn\u2019t allowed to take it, but they like more or less forced me to\ndo it. And then they took me away from by the window so I couldn\u2019t see anybody.\nAnd we were there, and also I was in a little nursery where I cried all the time\nbecause I wanted to be with my mother. And one day I escaped when the milkman\ncame, and I ho \u2014 I heard all the loudspeakers talking, you know, listening to my\nname, and \u2014 and somehow I thought I would find my mother, but all the barracks\nlooked alike, and I couldn\u2019t find her. So somebody recognized me and they took me\nto my mother and somehow she must have convinced them \u2014 convinced them to let\nme stay there. And \u2014 but I know everybody was very, very hungry, and there was a\nlot of suffering all around me. My girl cousin was very close to me and I would see\nher once in a while, but she was older and you know, they divided you by age. The\nrabbi in the camp heard that they were going to send everybody to Auschwitz, so he\ntold my mother to try to escape. My brother had \u2014 and my father were no longer\nthere. We didn\u2019t know where they were. You have to remember that in those days\nthere was no radio, no communication from the outside, nothing. So you really\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on. After the war we found out that my brother was\ngiven away to a French family. But the rabbi gave my mother a few francs and told\nJuly 23, 2009\nher to escape. So we had a pass to see my sister, who was born at the maternity\n[indecipherable]. And instead of going to see her, we escaped. And my mother had\nspoken to one of the nurses there and she said not to worry, that she\u2019s gonna try and\nget her out of camp. My mother was unbelievable, very strong lady, very strong,\nthat she could survive all of this. And with a few francs we went \u2014 we didn\u2019t go to\nsee my sister, my mother took me to the La Gare, which 1s the railroad station. And\nshe tried to buy tickets for us, she just had enough money to buy us tickets to go to\nMarseilles. And in Marseilles, she knew my father would be there. There was a\nhotel where all the Jewish people stayed, and she figured somebody there would\nknow where my father was. So \u2014 but at the station, I started to cry and she was\nafraid that the Germans would \u2014 because you had to show a pass wherever you\nwent, so she was afraid that the Germans would notice me crying, so she bought me\nsoda. I wanted soda to keep me quiet. So when she went to buy the ticket, the\nmoney that she used for the soda, she didn\u2019t have enough for the tickets. So she met\na woman there that she\u2019s a French lady, and she sold her \u2014 she had a piece of soap,\nand she sold her the piece of soap and the lady and my mother bought the tickets\nand she took us on the train and spoke for my mother, cause my mother only spoke\nYiddish and very little French, and they used to come on the train to ask for\nidentity. But my mother made believe like she was sleeping, and I was a little girl, I\nJuly 23, 2009\nspoke a little French, so that was all right, and the woman took care of me. But the\nminute we arrived in Marseilles, she \u2014 she told my mother, I can no longer stay\nwith \u2014 with you, because \u2014 she kissed us goodbye and she left us right there. So we\ndidn\u2019t know really where to find my father, but we knew there was a place in\nMarseilles called Hotel Avant(ph). I don\u2019t know exactly how she found that out,\nbut we tried to go there and I was afraid of anybody that wore a uniform, so my\nmother was going to stop, she saw a mailman, and ask him. And I carried on so that\nshe couldn\u2019t even ask him, but somehow she did after a while, and we found a\nplace, Hotel Avant(ph) in Marseilles, where all the Jewish people were assembled.\nBut it wasn\u2019t a very good place to stay, because the Germans would come with big\ntrucks and they would raffle \u2014 they would do a raffle at night and take everybody to\nAuschwitz. So we were in that hotel, it\u2019s like a miracle. My father\u2019s friend was\nthere, and he said he hasn\u2019t seen my father for a while. Sometimes he comes in\nthere, but he hasn\u2019t seen him for a while. But that night we went to sleep and my\nfather cut his finger while he was \u2014 he was a lumberjack during the war, in th \u2014 in\nthe forest, that\u2019s what he said. And he cut his finger, this finger here, the pointer. I\nalways remember, because he had a big scar. And he had to see a doctor because the\nbleeding wouldn\u2019t stop. So he \u2014 he came in to see the doctor and my father\u2019s friend\nsaid, you know, Mr. Zale, your wife and daughter are here. He said, come on, don\u2019t\nJuly 23, 2009\njoke around, it\u2019s impossible. So it just turned out that that\u2019s what happened. So in\nthe morning we saw my father and it was the most exciting time. I\u2019m sorry. And my\nfather went to suture \u2014 oh, my father went to the doctor to suture his wound, and my\nmother like almost collapsed because my brother wasn\u2019t with him. My brother and\nfather, in the beginning they were like homeless people. But then my father saw that\nhe couldn\u2019t take care of my brother, so he gave him away to a French fa-family.\nAnd they took very good care of him. So my mother said she\u2019s not leaving unless\nhe gets my brother, so it took a\u2014 well, we went to this vil \u2014 little village which is\ncalled Aix-en-Provence and from there we went with my father to Tres, which was\nin the southern part of France, where he was living. And the landlady, Madame\nLaville(ph), she was the landlady where my father lived, and she gave us a bigger\nroom, and my broth \u2014 my father got my brother back from the French people, and\nwe all lived in that room: my mother, my father, my brother and me. And my sister\nwas still at Erna(ph). So the French lady was a wonderful, wonderful lady and she\ndidn\u2019t like the Germans because they killed her son during the war, whatever. And\nshe would take me with her all over. She would take me to the cemetery, she would\ntake me to church. So she wanted to really baptize me. And she gave us like food,\nand she gave us \u2014 and she let us live there all through the war without paying rent.\nWe all lived in a big room that looked like a restaurant, all of us. And the Germans,\nJuly 23, 2009\nwhen they came to town, lived upstairs in that hotel. And they didn\u2019t know we were\nJewish, so that\u2019s another miracle. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s incredible. So we had a little car\n\u2014 and then, the Ozay(ph), or the Red Cross, the Swiss Red Cross got my sister out\nof concentration camp \u2014 out of the internment camp and they brought her to us, to\nmy mother. And my mother had to go to meet her in Marseilles, and on the way\nback they didn\u2019t like her pass \u2014 you know, they came to see, this one, to see if\neverything was all right, and they \u2014 they almost didn\u2019t let her get off the bus,\nbecause they didn\u2019t like the papers. It didn\u2019t have some kind of signature, and the\nbus driver said, come on, let\u2019s \u2014 let her go, you know, and then he took off, and she\ncame to Trespeux(ph) Giraud(ph), and we stayed there until liberation, but a lot of\nthings happened in that little village. Sometimes they would come through town, the\nGermans, and they said ammunition was \u2014 a plane came by and dropped\nammunition and whoever has it, they took the whole village, put them in the middle\nof this little park and they said they\u2019re gonna shoot the priest if \u2014 they\u2019re gonna\nshoot the priest if the ammunition is not found. But finally, after I don\u2019t know how\nmany hours, they let us go. But we understood everything they said, because\nYiddish and German is very similar. And also, in the hotel where we lived, this\nGerman soldier was talking to my mother, I don\u2019t know, in German, I guess, and he\nsaid, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to him, he really doesn\u2019t want to be a\nJuly 23, 2009\nsoldier, he might never see his kids again because you know, it\u2019s war. And he\nalways used \u2014 and he gave me a few candies. So I didn\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t let on that\nwe were Jewish or anything like that. And we lived in that little village and we\nreally were hungry too, we didn\u2019t have any food. And we had a little carriage for\nmy sister, and inside there was like an opening where she sat. So we would go into\nthe fields and we would steal like potatoes and fruit. And my sister would sit \u2014 we\nwould put it in that opening and my sister would sit right on top and that\u2019s how we\nwould come back to town. And I would \u2014 I went to school there and my brother too,\nand my little sister stayed with my mother. And we had a very hard time, but all of a\nsudden they said that the town will be \u2014 would be bombed. And so everybody went\ninto the mountains and \u2014 everybody went into the mountains \u2014 what I forgot to\nmention, I\u2019ll go back to the mountains later, is that my \u2014 th-the landlady, Madame\nLaville(ph) wanted to baptize me and my mother said no. Sh \u2014 sh \u2014 I was bor \u2014 my\ndaughter\u2019s born Jewish and she will die Jewish; because they were pretty religious\nbefore the war. So she didn\u2019t do anything. But she was always dressed in black\nbecause of the death of her son, and she had two little gi \u2014 dogs, one white one and\none black one. And she was very good to me, and to my whole family. But when we\nwent up in the mountains, when they said they were gonna bomb the town, that was\nalmost at liberation, but we didn\u2019t know it. We saw planes going by, bombs falling,\nJuly 23, 2009\nall kinds of things, and we stayed up there. And then all of a sudden they came and\nthey told us that the war is over, we can go back. So everybody was so excited, but\nthey didn\u2019t let the children go back because they weren\u2019t sure. So they said, let the\ngrown-ups, some grown-ups go back and see if everything\u2019s all right. And then I\nremember liberation, it was great. All the American tanks came through town, and\neverybody was so happy, everybody was kissing everybody, they were drinking.\nAnd one day I was playing at a fountain right there in the middle of town, and an\nAmerican soldier, who was a Zionist, I guess, he was looking for Jewish people in\nthat town, if there were any Jewish people. So I was playing with my friends and he\ncame over and he said, which one of you little girls speaks Jewish? And I said, I do.\nAnd he says, take me to your mother. So my mother lived right across the street in\nthat hotel. So he \u2014 he went to my mother, and my mother said she had a s-sister in\nthe United States, and he says, on my furlough, I\u2019m gonna try and find out where \u2014\nif you \u2014 if she\u2019s still alive, if she\u2019s interested and so on. So the next time he came\nback to town, he brought my \u2014 he heard from my aunt, he brought us goodies, and\nevery American Jewish soldier that came through town, came to our house and\nbrought us things. And they \u2014 they didn\u2019t know whether they were gonna make it\nbecause our little village was the beginning of liberation, but they still had to go on\nto Paris and France and \u2014 and things like that, so they were a little bit \u2014 some of\nJuly 23, 2009\nthem were even crying to my mother. And from there we left nac \u2014 we left that little\nvillage and we went back to Marseilles, because we wanted to get back to Belgium\nto find out what happened to the rest of our family. So we went to Marseilles, I\nwent to school there with my brother and my sister, and they still had air raids\nwhere you had to go into the shelters in the middle of the day. They still had all\nthese things, and my father worked for the American army, and we saved up enough\nmoney and then we went back to Antwerp, Belgium. In 19 like \u201945, at the end of,\nand my \u2014 and we had to find a little apartment, 1t was very hard, you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t find anything. And we found a little apartment and \u2014 and we lived there\nand every time people would come back on buses to the school that I went to, that\u2019s\nwha \u2014 they had like a country yard, they would come back there and they would \u2014\nmy mother would go to see if her sister, my uncle, my aunt, my \u2014 my cousins were\nalive, and nobody ever came back. And she would never walk in that street ever\nagain, she would go all around. And we \u2014 I forgot to mention that also, when I lived\nin France, I was in children\u2019s homes, I was in Villa Marianne, which is in south\nRaphael, and I was very hungry there too, I used to eat the peels from the garbage\nwhen we went to the beach. I hated it. First of all, I wanted to be with my mother\nand father, and we would go to the beach, and I-I didn\u2019t like it because they made\nyou bathe without a bathing suit. They kept you very badly, and the\nJuly 23, 2009\n[indecipherable] priest who was the one in charge, he made parties, and we didn\u2019t\nhave any food, and some of the boys at night would go to the kitchen, they made\nbelieve like they were sl-sleepwalking, and bring food for everybody. And life is\nstrange, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m just doing this, I\u2019m gonna f \u2014 I\u2019m just doing this \u2014 I always talk\nabout the Holocaust because I don\u2019t want people to forget. And I\u2019m doing it for my\nparents \u2014 for my parents and my cousins, and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Let me change the tape. Yeah, we\u2019re gonna change tapes.",
        "A: I thought it was \u2014\nEnd of Tape One\nJuly 23, 2009\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: When I was in Tres, I went to school. I played with the children. We st \u2014 we\nmade little things, little clothes for the dolls, and I always waited for Christmas\nbecause the children always got a lot of toys to play with, and \u2014 but I said I was so\ngood, why didn\u2019t I get such a big doll, or why didn\u2019t I get these things. So \u2014 because\nI didn\u2019t understand, so my mother always used to say, oh, don\u2019t worry. And one day\nMadame Laville(ph) bought me a lot of toys, so \u2014 cause I waited for Santa Claus\njust like anybody else. And also, I loved going to school, and my mother sewed, so\nshe sometimes would make me clothes and she would knit a whole night sometimes\nto make me a pair of socks. Sh-she \u2014 and I didn\u2019t have the things, the material\nthings like other kids, but I wasn\u2019t really that much aware of it, except when I was\ncold. And my mother gave my brother and me once money for milk. And we had to\nstand on line to get extra milk for some reason that store was giving \u2014 you could\nbuy more milk and we really needed the milk for my sister Joujou(ph), we called\nher Joujou(ph), her name is Josephine. And we were playing on line and we lost\nthe money and we came home and we couldn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t have the milk, and boy\ndid we get it. My mother always screamed, she was very nervous, and my father\nwas very calm. And my sister is just like my mother, and I\u2019m just like my father. I\ntried to be very calm. And I learned French, and I learned the Marseillaise, which I\nJuly 23, 2009\nstill remember til today, I don\u2019t know how, because now I\u2019m living in the United\nStates a long time and I \u2014 sometimes I don\u2019t know all the words to the \u2014 the\nnational anthem all the time, I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I forget sometimes. And I\nalso was in France in the Chateau de Marjolet, which they treated you pretty\ngood. But I was always crying, so I don\u2019t know. I made everybody cry by crying.\nAnd also I know a lot of kids had lice, and they put powder on their head, or if they\nhad something wrong with their stomach, and I was \u2014 I love chocolate, I would give\neverything for chocolate \u2014 so, whatever they gave you, I took it twice, because I got\ntwo pieces of chocolate. But they were pretty strict with you, and it wasn\u2019t that bad\nat the Chateau de Marjolet, but most kids there were orphans, and they cried a lot\ntoo, but I made them cry even more, because \u2014 so they told \u2014 they told my mother to\ncome and get me because \u2014 so we had to leave earlier than anticipated. We were\nthere because after the war you couldn\u2019t find an apartment, and my parents had a\nvery small little room. And it was hard to keep us all, we didn\u2019t have a stove, we\ndidn\u2019t have a refrigerator and they still had air \u2014 air raids for \u2014 and my s \u2014 my\nmother was holding my sister on the way to the shelter and she was missed by a\ngrenade just by a step or two, so 1t was very scary. And there was a man in our\nbuilding who was deaf, and he stayed in his apartment all through the thing and\nnothing happened to him, so I always used to say, why do I have to go to the\nJuly 23, 2009\nshelter? And I used to go to the movies, I loved musicals. And that\u2019s really how I\nlearned how to speak English, by going to the movies. My mother used to give me a\nfew francs and I would go to the movies with my brother or by myself. At that time\nit wasn\u2019t like today. And we had \u2014 where we went back to Belgium we had a lot of\nfriends. Our hearts was open to everybody. When we left to come to the United\nStates, the door didn\u2019t close all night long. That\u2019s how many people came to say\ngood-bye to us, and also, after the war, when we lived in Marseilles, we had a\nyoung boy who was about 20 years old at the time, he would come and my mother\nwould invite him for Passover and everything and then I heard that he died, my\nparents were very upset, because he ate too much. You know, aft-after you don\u2019t eat\nand you start eating after the war, you blow up and you \u2014 something happens to\nyou, and I know he died and my parents were very upset, because he had no\nparents, nobody and he would come to us. So that was bad, too. And while you\u2019re in\ncamp, you do see a lot, you see people that are laying, you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re\nalive or dead. And you see a lot of bad things. And it\u2019s always with you, and there\u2019s\nalways articles today that will remind you of it. And I\u2019m glad they had the\nHolocaust Museum, because I go there sometimes. And I try to go to see if I can\nfind pictures that I know. And I find a lot of information and it\u2019s really \u2014 I once read\nJuly 23, 2009\nthat the people that died have no cemetery, so when you go there it\u2019s the same, you\nknow.",
        "Q: It\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, and I\u2019m very lucky that all my family survived and my father lived til he\nwas 80, and my mother lived with me til she was like 86. And my father was very\nsick, so \u2014 my father had heart problems, Alzheimer, everything. And my mother\nwas sick too, but she knew everything til the last minute of her life. And you must\nalways remember and always do things.",
        "Q: Why did you leave Belgium?",
        "A: I left Belgium in 1950 to come to the United States. May 17\", 1950. And we\nloved it here and we still do, you know.",
        "Q: But why did you leave Belgium, why?",
        "A: Why? My mother didn\u2019t want to live in that country any more. She didn\u2019t \u2014 she\ndidn\u2019t even want to go back to France and I| always wanted \u2014 I still corresponded\nwith the landlady that saved my li \u2014 you know, that saved our lives, and Rabbi\nBloch(ph) is the first person that I should thank, because he gave my mother money\nto escape. And then Madame Laville(ph) is the other one and lama \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nhow they did it with the [indecipherable] to bring my sister \u2014 it\u2019s like a miracle\nreally, that all five of us survived, and \u2014 and are here in the United States, and my\nJuly 23, 2009\nmother and father were very happy here, they loved it.

        "Answer: Yes, ma \u2014 good morning. My name is Lucie Ragin, I was born Lucie\nLaya(ph) Saltz, and my parents felt that Zalc, z-a-l-c, but Saltz, s-a-I-t-z is also\nhow it\u2019s spelled. And I was born in Antwerp, Belgium, February 27, 1935. And my\nmother and father were very loving parents. My father\u2019s name was David Saltz,\nand my mother\u2019s name was Miriam Clara Saltz. And they already had a son, his\nname is Andre Zalc, Abraham Zalc. And we were a very happy family, and\nAntwerp is a beautiful ci \u2014 city by \u2014 by the ocean. And my aunt and uncle lived in\nthe same town in a ver \u2014 1n a Jewish community there, we lived. And my aunt and\nuncle had a bakery. And that\u2019s the only family we really had. Most of my father\u2019s\nfamily was in Poland, and my mother had some family left in Latvia, Russia, and\n\u2014 which we never met, but we were very close to my family, my mother\u2019s aunt and\nuncle \u2014 ma \u2014 my aunt and uncle, and I always would go there as a little girl and on\nthe holidays and we \u2014 my mother and \u2014 would make wine with her sister, and I \u2014 I\nloved the goodies in the bakery that they owned, so I always liked to go there. And\nJuly 23, 2009\nwe were very happy family and all of a sudden they said it wouldn\u2019t be good for the\nJewish people to stay in Antwerp because the war was broke \u2014 breaking out. So my\nparents and my aunt and uncle, we decided to leave Antwerp, and we packed\nwhatever we could in a \u2014 1n a rush to leave, and \u2014 for France. And I was a little girl,\nI really didn\u2019t understand too much. I saw people taping the window, because they\nwere afraid that their houses would be bombed, and they put tape on the window so\nit wouldn\u2019t shatter. And we took a duffle bag, whatever we could, and we left by\ntrain to go to France. And I remember the Red Cross in the \u2014 in La Gare, in the\nstation, and they would help all the people and give them hot chocolate and things\nlike that. And when they packed in a rush, one of the scissors that they packed was\nsticking up, and I sat on that bag, and I had to be treated by the Red Cross, and\nthat\u2019s why I remember that incident. And the train went on, and we really didn\u2019t\nknow where we were going in France, and we went towards this \u2014 I guess on the \u2014\nthe southern part of France, and my aunt and uncle were with us, we were all 1-in a\nplace called Brens(ph), which was a camp. And from there we went to Recebedou,\nor vice-versa. And then we ended up in Rivesaltes, which was the worst one, I\nthink, of them all. I remember barbed wire, but I don\u2019t remember \u2014 I think I was\nwearing a Jewish star, but I\u2019m not positive. I was a little girl, and my mother was\npregnant, and it was very hard for her because we didn\u2019t have any food, and we\nJuly 23, 2009\ndidn\u2019t have many things. And whatever she had, she would give to her children.\nAnd I rem \u2014 and my father in camp, he\u2019s \u2014 he knew \u2014 he was a plumber there, they\nused him to do plumbing, and he helped people get out of the camp, and they paid\nhim by giving him like an egg, a tomato, a few potatoes and this way he would\nmake his food. But they were aware of what he was doing, so he had to leave the\ncamp and not come back. He had to leave my mother and me there and not come\nback, because there were \u2014 and every day they would come and they would pick up\nmy mother, I don\u2019t know if it was the Vichy. I remember a German Shepherd also,\nand they would take my mother for questioning, because they thought she knew\nwhere he was, but she didn\u2019t. And I \u2014 I used to see my cousin in camp, and my aunt.\nI don\u2019t remember about my uncle and my boy cousin. But we were very hungry,\nvery, very hungry. There was hardly any food. I know my mother always said if you\ngot like a hundred grams of bread and a little bit of turnip soup and if they punished\nyou, they would take it away from you. That\u2019s what she said. And \u2014 and she was\nalways worried about everybody. And I remember in the camp, they put me in the\nlittle children\u2019s nursery, or whatever, and I would \u2014 I was always crying \u2014 they\ncalled me \u2014 I was always crying, I was always sad, I was a very sad little girl\nbecause I always wanted to be with my mother. And I even had the German measles\nthere, and they put me in the infirmary. And I had the window by \u2014 I slept by the\nJuly 23, 2009\nwindow in the infirmary, and there were other children there, and the mothers\nwould come by the window and they wanted to give things for their children, and I\nwould \u2014 I know I wasn\u2019t allowed to take it, but they like more or less forced me to\ndo it. And then they took me away from by the window so I couldn\u2019t see anybody.\nAnd we were there, and also I was in a little nursery where I cried all the time\nbecause I wanted to be with my mother. And one day I escaped when the milkman\ncame, and I ho \u2014 I heard all the loudspeakers talking, you know, listening to my\nname, and \u2014 and somehow I thought I would find my mother, but all the barracks\nlooked alike, and I couldn\u2019t find her. So somebody recognized me and they took me\nto my mother and somehow she must have convinced them \u2014 convinced them to let\nme stay there. And \u2014 but I know everybody was very, very hungry, and there was a\nlot of suffering all around me. My girl cousin was very close to me and I would see\nher once in a while, but she was older and you know, they divided you by age. The\nrabbi in the camp heard that they were going to send everybody to Auschwitz, so he\ntold my mother to try to escape. My brother had \u2014 and my father were no longer\nthere. We didn\u2019t know where they were. You have to remember that in those days\nthere was no radio, no communication from the outside, nothing. So you really\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on. After the war we found out that my brother was\ngiven away to a French family. But the rabbi gave my mother a few francs and told\nJuly 23, 2009\nher to escape. So we had a pass to see my sister, who was born at the maternity\n[indecipherable]. And instead of going to see her, we escaped. And my mother had\nspoken to one of the nurses there and she said not to worry, that she\u2019s gonna try and\nget her out of camp. My mother was unbelievable, very strong lady, very strong,\nthat she could survive all of this. And with a few francs we went \u2014 we didn\u2019t go to\nsee my sister, my mother took me to the La Gare, which 1s the railroad station. And\nshe tried to buy tickets for us, she just had enough money to buy us tickets to go to\nMarseilles. And in Marseilles, she knew my father would be there. There was a\nhotel where all the Jewish people stayed, and she figured somebody there would\nknow where my father was. So \u2014 but at the station, I started to cry and she was\nafraid that the Germans would \u2014 because you had to show a pass wherever you\nwent, so she was afraid that the Germans would notice me crying, so she bought me\nsoda. I wanted soda to keep me quiet. So when she went to buy the ticket, the\nmoney that she used for the soda, she didn\u2019t have enough for the tickets. So she met\na woman there that she\u2019s a French lady, and she sold her \u2014 she had a piece of soap,\nand she sold her the piece of soap and the lady and my mother bought the tickets\nand she took us on the train and spoke for my mother, cause my mother only spoke\nYiddish and very little French, and they used to come on the train to ask for\nidentity. But my mother made believe like she was sleeping, and I was a little girl, I\nJuly 23, 2009\nspoke a little French, so that was all right, and the woman took care of me. But the\nminute we arrived in Marseilles, she \u2014 she told my mother, I can no longer stay\nwith \u2014 with you, because \u2014 she kissed us goodbye and she left us right there. So we\ndidn\u2019t know really where to find my father, but we knew there was a place in\nMarseilles called Hotel Avant(ph). I don\u2019t know exactly how she found that out,\nbut we tried to go there and I was afraid of anybody that wore a uniform, so my\nmother was going to stop, she saw a mailman, and ask him. And I carried on so that\nshe couldn\u2019t even ask him, but somehow she did after a while, and we found a\nplace, Hotel Avant(ph) in Marseilles, where all the Jewish people were assembled.\nBut it wasn\u2019t a very good place to stay, because the Germans would come with big\ntrucks and they would raffle \u2014 they would do a raffle at night and take everybody to\nAuschwitz. So we were in that hotel, it\u2019s like a miracle. My father\u2019s friend was\nthere, and he said he hasn\u2019t seen my father for a while. Sometimes he comes in\nthere, but he hasn\u2019t seen him for a while. But that night we went to sleep and my\nfather cut his finger while he was \u2014 he was a lumberjack during the war, in th \u2014 in\nthe forest, that\u2019s what he said. And he cut his finger, this finger here, the pointer. I\nalways remember, because he had a big scar. And he had to see a doctor because the\nbleeding wouldn\u2019t stop. So he \u2014 he came in to see the doctor and my father\u2019s friend\nsaid, you know, Mr. Zale, your wife and daughter are here. He said, come on, don\u2019t\nJuly 23, 2009\njoke around, it\u2019s impossible. So it just turned out that that\u2019s what happened. So in\nthe morning we saw my father and it was the most exciting time. I\u2019m sorry. And my\nfather went to suture \u2014 oh, my father went to the doctor to suture his wound, and my\nmother like almost collapsed because my brother wasn\u2019t with him. My brother and\nfather, in the beginning they were like homeless people. But then my father saw that\nhe couldn\u2019t take care of my brother, so he gave him away to a French fa-family.\nAnd they took very good care of him. So my mother said she\u2019s not leaving unless\nhe gets my brother, so it took a\u2014 well, we went to this vil \u2014 little village which is\ncalled Aix-en-Provence and from there we went with my father to Tres, which was\nin the southern part of France, where he was living. And the landlady, Madame\nLaville(ph), she was the landlady where my father lived, and she gave us a bigger\nroom, and my broth \u2014 my father got my brother back from the French people, and\nwe all lived in that room: my mother, my father, my brother and me. And my sister\nwas still at Erna(ph). So the French lady was a wonderful, wonderful lady and she\ndidn\u2019t like the Germans because they killed her son during the war, whatever. And\nshe would take me with her all over. She would take me to the cemetery, she would\ntake me to church. So she wanted to really baptize me. And she gave us like food,\nand she gave us \u2014 and she let us live there all through the war without paying rent.\nWe all lived in a big room that looked like a restaurant, all of us. And the Germans,\nJuly 23, 2009\nwhen they came to town, lived upstairs in that hotel. And they didn\u2019t know we were\nJewish, so that\u2019s another miracle. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s incredible. So we had a little car\n\u2014 and then, the Ozay(ph), or the Red Cross, the Swiss Red Cross got my sister out\nof concentration camp \u2014 out of the internment camp and they brought her to us, to\nmy mother. And my mother had to go to meet her in Marseilles, and on the way\nback they didn\u2019t like her pass \u2014 you know, they came to see, this one, to see if\neverything was all right, and they \u2014 they almost didn\u2019t let her get off the bus,\nbecause they didn\u2019t like the papers. It didn\u2019t have some kind of signature, and the\nbus driver said, come on, let\u2019s \u2014 let her go, you know, and then he took off, and she\ncame to Trespeux(ph) Giraud(ph), and we stayed there until liberation, but a lot of\nthings happened in that little village. Sometimes they would come through town, the\nGermans, and they said ammunition was \u2014 a plane came by and dropped\nammunition and whoever has it, they took the whole village, put them in the middle\nof this little park and they said they\u2019re gonna shoot the priest if \u2014 they\u2019re gonna\nshoot the priest if the ammunition is not found. But finally, after I don\u2019t know how\nmany hours, they let us go. But we understood everything they said, because\nYiddish and German is very similar. And also, in the hotel where we lived, this\nGerman soldier was talking to my mother, I don\u2019t know, in German, I guess, and he\nsaid, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to him, he really doesn\u2019t want to be a\nJuly 23, 2009\nsoldier, he might never see his kids again because you know, it\u2019s war. And he\nalways used \u2014 and he gave me a few candies. So I didn\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t let on that\nwe were Jewish or anything like that. And we lived in that little village and we\nreally were hungry too, we didn\u2019t have any food. And we had a little carriage for\nmy sister, and inside there was like an opening where she sat. So we would go into\nthe fields and we would steal like potatoes and fruit. And my sister would sit \u2014 we\nwould put it in that opening and my sister would sit right on top and that\u2019s how we\nwould come back to town. And I would \u2014 I went to school there and my brother too,\nand my little sister stayed with my mother. And we had a very hard time, but all of a\nsudden they said that the town will be \u2014 would be bombed. And so everybody went\ninto the mountains and \u2014 everybody went into the mountains \u2014 what I forgot to\nmention, I\u2019ll go back to the mountains later, is that my \u2014 th-the landlady, Madame\nLaville(ph) wanted to baptize me and my mother said no. Sh \u2014 sh \u2014 I was bor \u2014 my\ndaughter\u2019s born Jewish and she will die Jewish; because they were pretty religious\nbefore the war. So she didn\u2019t do anything. But she was always dressed in black\nbecause of the death of her son, and she had two little gi \u2014 dogs, one white one and\none black one. And she was very good to me, and to my whole family. But when we\nwent up in the mountains, when they said they were gonna bomb the town, that was\nalmost at liberation, but we didn\u2019t know it. We saw planes going by, bombs falling,\nJuly 23, 2009\nall kinds of things, and we stayed up there. And then all of a sudden they came and\nthey told us that the war is over, we can go back. So everybody was so excited, but\nthey didn\u2019t let the children go back because they weren\u2019t sure. So they said, let the\ngrown-ups, some grown-ups go back and see if everything\u2019s all right. And then I\nremember liberation, it was great. All the American tanks came through town, and\neverybody was so happy, everybody was kissing everybody, they were drinking.\nAnd one day I was playing at a fountain right there in the middle of town, and an\nAmerican soldier, who was a Zionist, I guess, he was looking for Jewish people in\nthat town, if there were any Jewish people. So I was playing with my friends and he\ncame over and he said, which one of you little girls speaks Jewish? And I said, I do.\nAnd he says, take me to your mother. So my mother lived right across the street in\nthat hotel. So he \u2014 he went to my mother, and my mother said she had a s-sister in\nthe United States, and he says, on my furlough, I\u2019m gonna try and find out where \u2014\nif you \u2014 if she\u2019s still alive, if she\u2019s interested and so on. So the next time he came\nback to town, he brought my \u2014 he heard from my aunt, he brought us goodies, and\nevery American Jewish soldier that came through town, came to our house and\nbrought us things. And they \u2014 they didn\u2019t know whether they were gonna make it\nbecause our little village was the beginning of liberation, but they still had to go on\nto Paris and France and \u2014 and things like that, so they were a little bit \u2014 some of\nJuly 23, 2009\nthem were even crying to my mother. And from there we left nac \u2014 we left that little\nvillage and we went back to Marseilles, because we wanted to get back to Belgium\nto find out what happened to the rest of our family. So we went to Marseilles, I\nwent to school there with my brother and my sister, and they still had air raids\nwhere you had to go into the shelters in the middle of the day. They still had all\nthese things, and my father worked for the American army, and we saved up enough\nmoney and then we went back to Antwerp, Belgium. In 19 like \u201945, at the end of,\nand my \u2014 and we had to find a little apartment, 1t was very hard, you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t find anything. And we found a little apartment and \u2014 and we lived there\nand every time people would come back on buses to the school that I went to, that\u2019s\nwha \u2014 they had like a country yard, they would come back there and they would \u2014\nmy mother would go to see if her sister, my uncle, my aunt, my \u2014 my cousins were\nalive, and nobody ever came back. And she would never walk in that street ever\nagain, she would go all around. And we \u2014 I forgot to mention that also, when I lived\nin France, I was in children\u2019s homes, I was in Villa Marianne, which is in south\nRaphael, and I was very hungry there too, I used to eat the peels from the garbage\nwhen we went to the beach. I hated it. First of all, I wanted to be with my mother\nand father, and we would go to the beach, and I-I didn\u2019t like it because they made\nyou bathe without a bathing suit. They kept you very badly, and the\nJuly 23, 2009\n[indecipherable] priest who was the one in charge, he made parties, and we didn\u2019t\nhave any food, and some of the boys at night would go to the kitchen, they made\nbelieve like they were sl-sleepwalking, and bring food for everybody. And life is\nstrange, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m just doing this, I\u2019m gonna f \u2014 I\u2019m just doing this \u2014 I always talk\nabout the Holocaust because I don\u2019t want people to forget. And I\u2019m doing it for my\nparents \u2014 for my parents and my cousins, and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: I thought it was \u2014\nEnd of Tape One\nJuly 23, 2009\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: When I was in Tres, I went to school. I played with the children. We st \u2014 we\nmade little things, little clothes for the dolls, and I always waited for Christmas\nbecause the children always got a lot of toys to play with, and \u2014 but I said I was so\ngood, why didn\u2019t I get such a big doll, or why didn\u2019t I get these things. So \u2014 because\nI didn\u2019t understand, so my mother always used to say, oh, don\u2019t worry. And one day\nMadame Laville(ph) bought me a lot of toys, so \u2014 cause I waited for Santa Claus\njust like anybody else. And also, I loved going to school, and my mother sewed, so\nshe sometimes would make me clothes and she would knit a whole night sometimes\nto make me a pair of socks. Sh-she \u2014 and I didn\u2019t have the things, the material\nthings like other kids, but I wasn\u2019t really that much aware of it, except when I was\ncold. And my mother gave my brother and me once money for milk. And we had to\nstand on line to get extra milk for some reason that store was giving \u2014 you could\nbuy more milk and we really needed the milk for my sister Joujou(ph), we called\nher Joujou(ph), her name is Josephine. And we were playing on line and we lost\nthe money and we came home and we couldn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t have the milk, and boy\ndid we get it. My mother always screamed, she was very nervous, and my father\nwas very calm. And my sister is just like my mother, and I\u2019m just like my father. I\ntried to be very calm. And I learned French, and I learned the Marseillaise, which I\nJuly 23, 2009\nstill remember til today, I don\u2019t know how, because now I\u2019m living in the United\nStates a long time and I \u2014 sometimes I don\u2019t know all the words to the \u2014 the\nnational anthem all the time, I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I forget sometimes. And I\nalso was in France in the Chateau de Marjolet, which they treated you pretty\ngood. But I was always crying, so I don\u2019t know. I made everybody cry by crying.\nAnd also I know a lot of kids had lice, and they put powder on their head, or if they\nhad something wrong with their stomach, and I was \u2014 I love chocolate, I would give\neverything for chocolate \u2014 so, whatever they gave you, I took it twice, because I got\ntwo pieces of chocolate. But they were pretty strict with you, and it wasn\u2019t that bad\nat the Chateau de Marjolet, but most kids there were orphans, and they cried a lot\ntoo, but I made them cry even more, because \u2014 so they told \u2014 they told my mother to\ncome and get me because \u2014 so we had to leave earlier than anticipated. We were\nthere because after the war you couldn\u2019t find an apartment, and my parents had a\nvery small little room. And it was hard to keep us all, we didn\u2019t have a stove, we\ndidn\u2019t have a refrigerator and they still had air \u2014 air raids for \u2014 and my s \u2014 my\nmother was holding my sister on the way to the shelter and she was missed by a\ngrenade just by a step or two, so 1t was very scary. And there was a man in our\nbuilding who was deaf, and he stayed in his apartment all through the thing and\nnothing happened to him, so I always used to say, why do I have to go to the\nJuly 23, 2009\nshelter? And I used to go to the movies, I loved musicals. And that\u2019s really how I\nlearned how to speak English, by going to the movies. My mother used to give me a\nfew francs and I would go to the movies with my brother or by myself. At that time\nit wasn\u2019t like today. And we had \u2014 where we went back to Belgium we had a lot of\nfriends. Our hearts was open to everybody. When we left to come to the United\nStates, the door didn\u2019t close all night long. That\u2019s how many people came to say\ngood-bye to us, and also, after the war, when we lived in Marseilles, we had a\nyoung boy who was about 20 years old at the time, he would come and my mother\nwould invite him for Passover and everything and then I heard that he died, my\nparents were very upset, because he ate too much. You know, aft-after you don\u2019t eat\nand you start eating after the war, you blow up and you \u2014 something happens to\nyou, and I know he died and my parents were very upset, because he had no\nparents, nobody and he would come to us. So that was bad, too. And while you\u2019re in\ncamp, you do see a lot, you see people that are laying, you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re\nalive or dead. And you see a lot of bad things.
