        "Q: Tell me your name please.",
        "A: My name is Abraham Malach.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: I was born uh on uh May 12th, 1935, in Zwolen, which is in central Poland, uh Zwolen\nbeing a small town of about ten thousand people at the time uh half of which was Jewish and\nthat was about five thousand people. And uh when the war broke out...",
        "Q: Before the war, tell me about the memories you have of your family before the war.",
        "A: Uh my uh from my immediate family uh I have only a few uh memories uh but I know that\nuh there was uh twelve children on my mother's side. Uh there were twelve brothers and\nsisters of which only one survived the war, they having escaped in 1933 to uh what was then\nPalestine, and from my father's side uh where there were eight brother and and sisters, uh\nnone of them survived. But uh in the ghetto of Radom uh where I still saw uh the uh uncles\nand aunts and uh both sets of grandparents until 1941 uh I was able to see them.",
        "Q: What did your father do? What was his business?",
        "A: Uh my father was in the leather business, wholesaling. There were uh the uh town of\nZwolen, which was near Radom in an area where Jews uh uh were the tanners; and uh then\nuh uh the finishers of leather and uh shipping it to Germany and to the uh manufacturers of\nuh shoes. So he was, he was one of those that were wholesaling the uh the leather goods.",
        "Q: You were telling me some stories before the camera started of what you remember from\nwhen you were four years old and before the Nazis came.",
        "A: Well uh, there are there are pictures that remain with you like uh you see in flashbacks in\nmovies sometimes and uh for me it's in real life several uh pictures that are alive to this day,\nand that would be like the first telephone uh that was installed in just before the war broke\nout and the reason that I would remember it is that uh I would watch people walking to uh\ntalking to the wall and uh that uh was such a wonder to me that uh I couldn't explain it and\nit's remained with me to this day. People walking up to this certain spot and talking to the\nwall. But uh the next uh flashback would uh be uh when the war broke out and I was four\nyears old, in 1939 the first German planes coming over our town and uh flying low and uh\ndropping their bombs and everybody running to shelter and uh screaming and just not\nrunning fast enough or uh one obstructing to wait for the other. The panic that uh ensued.\nAnd so on and so forth.",
        "Q: Tell me about those, just keep on going. Tell me about what you did when the war broke out.\nWho was in your family. Sisters and brothers?",
        "A: Uh my uh in my immediate family we uh were four children. And uh it was my uh sister\nwho was five years older, a brother who was uh almost three years older, and then I had a\nS1...a younger sister (cough), excuse me, who was born in 1939. Uh after the war broke out\nand we uh were put into the uh the ghetto, uh sometime uh in 1940 we were uh put into the\nghetto in uh Radom uh where they would take a whole section and uh keep all the Jews,\ncollect all the Jews uh from the neighboring uh towns and villages. Uh we stayed in the uh\nghetto until about 1942...",
        "Q: What was it like?",
        "A: Uh, from the life in uh in the ghetto I have only uh few uh memories. But uh I remember that\nuh my mother had been uh kept at the police headquarters for a while and when she came\nback emaciated and so this picture that comes back to me. Of course I later learned the\nreason that uh she had been uh kept at the police headquarters was that uh my father had uh\nuh a lot of uh being that he was wealthy and uh had connections with the leading uh\nmembers of the community, so even after the ghetto was organized, he was able to uh obtain\nthrough uh uh payment a document from the uh uh mayor of the town in Zwolen and the uh\nGerman commissar, the German uh governor of the town, a special document for uh as a\nmerchant and uh supplier of uh the uh uh shoes to the German army and whatever, so he he\nobtained uh a passport uh so to speak, a uh it was which a document with which he was able\nto travel and uh the idea was that uh after uh the war broke out and the, Poland was divided\nto the German Russian sphere of influence, uh his uh he owned two trucks that were\nconfiscated so uh we couldn't get no means of escape but uh he was still dreaming of the, to\nget us uh out somehow uh with money that he still had and influence. So it was the travel\ndocument uh they plotted a scheme uh that we would uh hire a uh a horse uh uh drawn-\ncarriage and that was to take us to the other side of the river where the Russians were. Of\ncourse uh when we reached the uh bridge uh of that river, the uh German soldiers were there\nand uh two uh German soldiers on motorcycles uh would confront us with the carbines on\nthe backs and shout uh, \"Alle Juden [zuruck (ph)|, which reverberates to this day. And uh\nscreaming and the uh weeping by the women and children and nothing helped. We were uh\ndriven back to the ghetto. Uh eventually we were taken, the ghetto was liquidated and we\nwere taken to uh a uh work camp in Wolanow; and uh there we stayed from 1942 'til 1943.\nBut even there, my father had not given up; and uh he had uh uh bribed uh some people that\nhad influence, the uh head of the camp, to uh close an eye to the fact that we uh we would\nrun away. They would smuggle out at a certain time at the night. And uh it was before uh in\nDecember, just before Christmas time that uh we were uh driven on a sleigh to some village\nto uh uh to be hidden in a farmhouse, except that uh the farmer who was hiding us, he had uh\nvisitors and uh these visitors had heard one of the uh children was coughing or what, so that\nuh the farmer became afraid uh he would be betrayed, uh that he is hiding Jews, and we have\nto be smuggled back into the camp from which we had escaped. That was in 1942, the last\nchance that uh we uh we had still to uh to be free, after which uh on the raid that uh the\nGermans uh sent the SS to uh pick up uh old people and uh children, where my youngest\nsister was four. She was taken on a truck - all the uh screaming and all the yelling - it didn't\nhelp. And uh whether they gassed those people or shot them we don't know. It was the last\ntime we saw her. We stayed uh in Volanof until 1943 and were taken to another labor camp\nin uh called uh Starachowice and uh there we stayed until 1944. Uh...",
        "Q: What did you do in that camp? You told me you were a messenger. What did you do?",
        "A: Uh in Starachowice, I uh I was not uh with the uh work squads that were uh going out, uh\noutside the camp working in factories uh whether it was munitions or whatever for the uh\nGermans. So I uh I cleaned the police barracks the uh and I served as a messenger boy which\nproved to be of uh crucial importance when uh the uh when uh uh making these selections to\nagain uh to pick out uh those unable to work whether it was children or elderly or or those\nthat uh became ill and so on. Uh I was considered uh important or productive and left alone\nso uh that when we arrived in uh Auschwitz I was listed as fourteen years of age and uh\napparently that helped me again uh be considered productive and not taken straight to the\novens.",
        "Q: Can you describe your arrival at Auschwitz?",
        "A: Uh up to uh Auschwitz and the uh ghetto and and the uh first subsequent uh labor camp we\nstill managed to be living as a uh unit, as a family unit uh even though my younger sister at\nthat point was taken away. Uh we were still uh with the uh parents as a family. Before being\ntaken to Auschwitz though, uh they uh loaded the uh men in separate wagons on the train\nand the women on separate wagons and uh when the decision was to be made how to divide\nthe children uh I was placed with uh my mother. They decided, between my parents they\ndecided that I should go with my mother and let my father take only my older brother with\nhim in order to uh have a better chance of escaping from the uh train uh when uh the train\nslows down or comes to a stop. They were hoping to be able to uh run away and uh he felt\nthat I was too weak and too young to uh to join him. And that proved to be uh a blessing that\nuh I went with the uh women's uh into the women's camp because uh the first selection that\nthey had in Auschwitz uh in the men's uh camp, they rounded up uh all the youngsters and\nuh my brother included and uh again he was uh at the time uh about fourteen, maybe going\non fifteen whereas I I was only nine. They took him with the other uh children to the uh the\ngas chambers. And that being on a uh special day, uh the Jewish New Year, the second day\nof Rosh Hashanah, which was uh Mengele's uh way of uh uh making a point of uh making\nselections on uh on uh Jewish events, Jewish holidays. And uh in Auschwitz uh when we\nhad arrived uh was the height of the uh transports and uh they didn't put us straight into the\noven because they couldn't handle that many arrivals in a given day, so that we went two\nweeks uh without a uh number. Eventually they did take us in and uh we became uh the\nslaves of uh Auschwitz, those that could still uh be useful to work. And uh the daily routine\nwas uh for the adults uh working uh in the nearby factories and uh I was uh a messenger and\nso on. (Pause) What uh got me to uh be able to survive the uh Auschwitz uh camp was a uh\nincident uh where a kapo had seen me with uh my uh mother and my sister at one time and\nuh she took a great uh liking to me or pity on me, and she would uh call me to her uh\nbarracks from time to time to feed me. There was one incident in which uh I I thought I\nwould never forgive myself. When I returned to the uh to my barracks with my mother and\nthat day not having been fed by the uh kapo I was asking for my uh portion of food which\nwas two slices of bread uh for supper and uh having no breakfast to look forward to and I\ncame home. I was uh hungry not having eaten and uh to discover that my uh mother uh\ndidn't expect that and shared the uh meal with my sister who told me that she gave it to my\nuh sister. And I carried on at the time, as hungry as I was and made my mother feel guilty\nand my sister feel guilty which uh I was ashamed of later on for a long time. And uh the\nthing was that uh as young as I was uh the drive to uh survive was so strong that uh you had\nto learn fast and uh whether from the kapo or uh by other means - I don't remember - I had\nsomehow managed to get uh ahold of cigarettes and uh when we were separated from uh my\nmother and from my sister, uh I was able to smuggle to them through a uh cousin of mine\ncigarettes that they should be able, in order for them to exchange for uh for food. And uh in\nAuschwitz itself an incident that uh only many years later I could comprehend what was\nhappening to me when uh the same uh kapo had uh brought one day to uh her barracks and\nuh during the daytime when everybody was out to work she had uh commandeered a uh a\nyoung attractive woman to wash me up and uh talking nicely to me that it's important to be\nclean and uh that girl carefully washed me and fondled me and then uh that kapo took me uh\non her bunk and uh tried to arouse me and uh as a nine year old boy uh lying beside her, on\ntop of her and in any kind of position, whatever she tried uh must have have been futile,\nfutile but uh that was the life in the camp for this poor woman. (Pause) They were a\ndegra...degradation that uh they put people to uh to the point that uh living was not worth\nliving. (Pause) And then uh remembering uh Auschwitz, being liberated when the Germans\nretreated ...",
        "Q: Can you tell me, tell me first about the food. You told me about the woman kapo and her\nsalami. Tell me a little more about the kapo. It's OK. It's OK. (Pause) Tell me as much\nabout her as you can. (Pause)",
        "A: I'm sorry. Uh uh one of the things that uh uh I had constantly uh in my mind was uh the\nvision the kapo having a uh round uh table uh sort of like this side table but taller and a uh\nshelf on the bottom. It was covered with a uh uh some kind of table cloth but on the second\nshelf being a piece of salami and bread at your disposal. And the idea that you would, you\ncan uh eat your uh your meal and uh have some left over, have uh extra food for later. It was\nuh the dream, a dream that uh was to be with me for a long time. Uh when we were liberated\nand uh we were being fed uh by the, at the time we were being cared for by the UNRA\nwhich was uh the uh relief organization, a Jewish relief organization active all over Europe\ntaking care of the refugees and survivors. Uh when we were uh being uh served meals it was\nnot uh a sit-down meal but you had to go to the counter and uh your plate was being filled\nwith the uh different foods and to this day I can remember that asking for uh when they filled\nmy plate for an extra spoon, extra spoon even though uh one would, should have uh known\nuh after the first or second time around that uh there's no need to fill up the plate that much\nmore than you can eat because uh some of it won't stay on the plate and you wouldn't be\nable to finish the meal or uh it took a long time to adjust and to know that uh you uh you\ntake what you feel you won't uh you'll eat and if you're not uh satisfied, that you can go back\nand get a second portion - took weeks before the mind (pause)",
        "Q: Take a minute and if you can go back to the camp one more time. You told me about an\nincident with the kapo and a toy. Can you tell us about that?",
        "A: Yeah. (Pause)",
        "Q: Take your time.",
        "A: (Pause - drinking water) Uh, at one point in Auschwitz uh that after I had met this kapo and\nuh as I mentioned uh if not for the food and occasionally a piece of clothing - she had a uh\ncoat commandeered for me uh because uh when people arrived at Auschwitz they were uh,\ntheir clothes with the outer belongings they may have still had with them, was taken away\nand uh we were given that uh pajama type uh prisoner's garb uh striped prisoner's garb.\nExcuse me. She somehow managed to get me a coat one time. Shoes and another time uh\nwanted to give me a toy that I refused and uh I pointed out to her that uh my brother was\ntaken to the uh to the chimney and uh this particular story I didn't uh, I cannot say that I\nrecollect having that conversation and but uh she told it to my mother, that I refused the toy\nand my mother had talked to me about it.",
        "Q: Why did you refuse the toy?",
        "A: I refused the toy uh pointing to the chimney and telling her that uh how can I play when uh\nmy brother was taken to the uh chimney. We could see from our camp that uh tall chimney,\nthe flame uh going up day and night, smoking. And uh the picture of a selection. Having\ngone through that uh once in your lifetime and you will never forget it. Uh the uh infamous\nuh Dr. Mengele, he would stand at the head of the uh column of the procession of uh naked\npeople and uh some way before reaching, uh coming up in front of Mengele, we saw that uh\nthere's left and there's right and uh what he was doing is he would uh people would march up\nin front of him and uh he would look at them and whether they are still able bodied or not,\nable to contribute uh toward the work, to the labor in the factories. So uh when my turn\ncame, and somebody was whispering to me uh to the right, and somehow I uh managed to\nstay in that right lane without being uh motioned back to the left lane. That's what uh made\nthe difference of life and death.",
        "Q: Can you recall children? Did you see other children at Auschwitz?",
        "A: Uh at some point uh in Auschwitz itself I was separated uh from my uh sister and from my\nmother and put in a uh children's uh block. In that children's block there were not only\nJewish children uh but also uh uh Polish and from uh Russian uh war uh prisoners of war,\nsome of them uh even younger than me. Some of them uh uh that uh were still uh babies\n(pause). When uh the Germans retreated and uh they took uh all the inmates on the forced\nmarch, they left uh the uh sick children and those that were uh unable to walk... They have\nbeen children under the age of six. Well, I hide among these and other kids; we managed to\nstay behind until the Russians arrived, and we were liberated in Auschwitz. Because those\nthat were taken on the forced march and those that were unable to uh keep up, they were\nsimply shot uh on the uh on the side of the road. After we were liberated and uh as I\nmentioned before I had uh run away from the camp when the uh first Russian soldiers\narrived and they had nothing on them but uh they were asking us for cigarettes or asking\nfrom us where's the uh supplies, and uh we had managed to find some sugar uh that was not\nburned and we showed them where the uh there was, where the sugar was. We took out with\nus uh a few sacks or whatever to uh and ran away to the city, to Auschwitz, myself and two\nother boys of whom I never heard again. These two boys uh may have uh ended up being uh\nraised by uh some childless family like uh I was supposed to. And as the uh the experiment\nby that couple didn't succeed...",
        "Q: Back up, because we're not following you. Let's start - you're running away. Where did you\nrun to?",
        "A: Uh from the uh camp of Auschwitz we went to the city, to the town of Auschwitz and where\na childless couple uh took me in and uh being that they uh worked both of them they would\nuh uh close me up during the day in their one room shack and uh disappear. Uh that didn't\nlast very long and I ended up in a uh monastery. But about uh whether it was uh two weeks\nor four weeks after liberation, they had organized the mass grave for all those bodies that uh\nwere collected uh of people that uh had been shot on the march and the retreat when the\nGermans took with them the, all the rest of the inmates. And uh all kind of bodies that were\nnot cremated but uh left unattended some of them till they starved and whatnot, so there was\nthis uh mass grave that the uh and ceremony that they had organized in Krak...Auschwitz\nwith the uh bells, all the churches uh ringing away. And that day I met I met up with uh the\nchildren that uh had stayed in the camp and uh now were collected by the UNRRA and uh I\nrejoined them. Uh everything by chance. If not for that uh I would have been in that\nmonastery uh growing up and uh stayed there in Auschwitz. It was the uh it was uh to this\nday I uh I remember the prayers in Polish and the original, the how they were teaching me,\nthe uh Polish nuns. And I would have been a good uh decent Polish uh Catholic to this day.\nAfter having survived alone the camps.",
        "Q: What was UNRRA the camp like?",
        "A: The uh...",
        "Q: No, no. What did you do when UNRRA took you? Where did they take you?",
        "A: Uh, in Auschwitz? (Pause) In Auschwitz uh I was uh not uh employed like the adults and\nuh it seemed that uh they simply didn't uh have uh the capacity to burn uh all the people\nwhen we arrived and uh they kept us there for a while until our turn would come.",
        "Q: No. I'm sorry. When you were rescued, after the war you were talking about UNRRA.",
        "A: Oh yeah. After the war uh when they collected the children in uh in Auschwitz. Well, they\nuh they eventually collected uh all the children and uh not only from Auschwitz but uh from\nthe other uh wherever they found uh refugee children, survivors. They took us to uh Krakow,\nuh Krakow. And uh from Krakow, they took us to uh a resort place to uh feed us and to uh to\nput us back on our feet. Because uh we were skeletons at the time. And uh during that time\nuh when uh my mother and my sister were liberated in uh Ravensbrick in East...what was\nEast Germany under the Russian influence. And uh they went back to uh our hometown\nlooking uh to see who survived. And in those days, uh the UNRRA had uh lists of uh\nsurvivors that they were compiling and sending it to all over Europe and all over the world.\nAnd uh eventually, my mother got hold of uh these lists and uh found out that uh I was\namong those kids that were collected in Krakow. And uh she sent my uh sister, who was uh\nat the time sixteen, to pick me up from uh Zakopane, where we uh were...had been taken uh\nfor recuperation. After we were reunited uh with my mother we found out that uh our father\nwas uh in Germany. It took him uh sometime to recuperate; but uh then uh...he went on uh a\ntrip to Poland to look for uh...he seemed to have found out that uh myself, my sister and uh\nmy mother had survived the war, and uh he got uh travel documents. He obtained travel\ndocuments for us and he went to Poland with the idea of uh taking us to Germany, to the\nAmerican sector. We missed each other; uh because uh while he traveled to Poland, we\ntraveled to Germany to join up with him. It was already after the war, and uh the crossing of\nthe border from uh East Berlin to West Berlin was not uh just uh picking up yourself and uh\ngoing but uh we had to smug...be smuggled through and uh my mother was resourceful in\nthat uh she uh got ahold of the right uh conn...made the right connections, paid off paid off\nthe right people who would uh drove us to the western sector. Eventually we uh reached uh\nthe town of where my father supposedly was, and uh found out that he was looking\nfor us in Poland and had to wait and uh it took us a year before we were reunited, in 1946.\nBy the time uh they organized the uh uh first uh school we were about seven children and uh\nwe were lumped together even though we're not of the same age to uh to learn . From\ndocuments that uh I have uh to this day uh it's interesting to that in 1946 which would have\nbeen uh one year after liberation, I already signed my name with my own handwriting. The\nminute we were liberated it was uh the uh drive to learn and uh uh to write, to read and write.\nThe motivation was so strong that uh even before I attended formal school I uh I knew to\nread and write, to read and some somewhat to write.",
        "Q: How long did you stay there before you moved on?",
        "A: In Hamburg uh I stayed uh for about uh two, for about two years, two or three years; and uh\nthen uh I was sent to a uh bigger town in Stuttgart, where there were more uh Jewish\nsurvivors, more children and uh there was a bigger school. And then uh from there I went on\nto Israel where I finished high school and uh my parents uh had stayed behind. Uh they were\nstill in Germany and uh when I came back I uh stayed with them for another two years and\nthen went on to America.",
        "Q: Why...excuse me...why did you go to Israel and they stayed in Germany?",
        "A: Uh they were tied up uh at the time already uh in uh in business. And uh they had a mind to\ngo to Israel eventually but uh uh they didn't want to keep me uh and uh to go to a German\nschool, so they sent me ahead and uh sent uh myself and my sister, they sent ahead to Israel\nto go to uh a Jewish school. When I finished uh uh when I finished high school I went back\nand was uh attended two years uh of the uh Technische (ph)...1n Stuttgart; and then went on\nto uh I went to New York, to America, and uh finished school in New York, at uh the\nColumbia University.",
        "Q: What was Germany like right after the war for you as a child?",
        "A: On the uh it wasn't too personal level. Uh I had uh not seen in Germans any different uh\nhuman beings, didn't uh didn't see look at them any different than at other people and uh uh\ndid not uh feel uh outright uh anti-Semitism among the people except when you traveled to\nthe small uh towns and villages where they would display uh their relatives who were in\nuniform and you could see and feel the way uh they were uh proud of uh their service to the\nReich and in the songs that they were singing that many of them uh they uh they still lived\nthat uh era that they looked at uh as the great era of uh ruling the world and so on, and uh\nthat there were many of those that uh didn't learn a lesson among the older generation. But I\nmust say that in the uh university, at the university there were uh a lot of young people who\nwere no different than uh other uh young people in other countries that uh they did realize uh\nthat you cannot conquer the world and get away with it. So uh you you had uh among them\nthese uh uh young people that uh would stand up for causes of uh democracy and so on.",
        "Q: OK. Can we go back to Auschwitz for a minute? Were there other children that you came in\ncontact with during those years in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Uh I don't recall much of uh the uh children that I was with uh except those a few a few of\nthose that uh survived with me. And uh we uh uh were not uh in in Auschwitz uh kept much\nuh like a a normal setting where you uh make friend...friendships and so on where you have\nan occasion to play with children and to get to know them much. Whether it was uh on uh\nappells, which meant uh being lined up uh for muster and uh that could take uh hours of\nyour time, or what uh as some other tasks of cleaning, whatever. Uh but no socializing per\nse.",
        "Q: What was living with your mother and your sister in the barrack in the barrack, in the\nwomen's barrack. What, can you describe that barrack? Can you describe what your life was\nlike in that barrack?",
        "A: The uh barracks uh would house uh, well 1t consisted of uh metal corrugated uh structures uh\nthat uh had these uh two-tiered bunks, wooden uh bunks. They're wooden beds. And uh how\nwe managed to uh to sleep without a mattress or whatever, it's beyond me and uh working uh\nto uh outside when uh being taken to work in the winter time in these harsh uh uh winter\ndays in Poland with uh inadequate clothing and not having uh a coat and pneumonia the first\ntime around uh it's beyond me. But uh uh it seems that uh human beings are capable of uh\nsurviving uh great hardships uh and still come out alright. It's amazing. And that's one of the\nthings that uh looking back when you uh when you hear, when you read of how it uh\nGerman uh uh doctors would come and conduct experiments on human beings, to that\neffect.",
        "Q: Did your mother and sister try to protect you ?",
        "A: To the extent uh possible but uh you were uh subject to uh their total control (cough) and\nwasn't uh a matter of being able to intercede on behalf of uh your beloved ones. When my uh\nsmaller sister was taken from uh literally from my mother's arms and uh would have\npreferred to uh die in her place and uh there was no way of her to to stop it. The truck just\ntook off and they uh they beat her down to the ground, my mother and uh could do nothing\nand uh I can imagine uh after the war for all these years to have to live with such memories,\nwhat it means to uh to or to my father for that matter, that he couldn't uh that he couldn't\nprotect my brother and that the uh guilt feeling, uh him feeling that uh he had uh taken my\nbrother with him rather than having sent him with me uh and that in turn may make him feel\nguilty if uh if I was able to survive and uh if he had let my older brother go together with me\nthat he maybe he would have survived too. But that was the decision at that time, that uh he\nthough he would be able to jump the train. (Pause) Up to uh up to a certain point yes, uh my\nparents were able to uh when they still had uh they had money and uh where their\nconnections were able to uh do something for them, but when you reached uh Auschwitz, we\nwere stripped uh of our belongings and uh reduced to uh to objects that they could do with\nuh whatever they wanted. (Pause) You ask yourself uh how is it possible and uh (pause) to\nthis day when I uh after having uh read and trying to understand uh that whole episode of\nhuman history, how is it possible in the 20th century for a thing like this to happen and uh\nthere's contradictory feelings and uh (pause) to try to explain rationally - there's no\nexplanation. To try to say that uh (pause) once the people were told uh that this is the policy\nof the government and uh therefore the lower echelon would accept it and go and follow\nthrough. It's one thing when you're uh when you're told to go along and uh and people uh\nmay have tendencies of uh not to care about other people uh when can be possible but uh\nyou're talking of an entire nation and more than one nation that participated in this, meaning\nuh educated and uh people with uh feelings, poets, writers.",
        "Q: How did you feel as a ten year old child in Auschwitz, given everything you have described\nto me? What did you feel?",
        "A: (Pause) It uh it must have been uh maybe reduced uh a little bit of human life to the life of\nuh of a crude animal uh where survival is the only thing and it makes me wonder uh how do\npeople come out of this uh intact. That all uh all you learn is uh (pause) that uh that there are\nuh it's uh hunters and there are those that are hunted. And uh it's, it must have taken years to\nfor me to uh to understand uh what life is all about but uh (pause) again uh to come back to\nuh the after all this time uh that uh passed and I I uh I read some of the uh some of the books\nwritten about that era, and uh of the people uh that participated 1n it; and it's so hard to\nunderstand uh how uh you can find so many beasts that uh took pleasure in uh executing\nthese orders and and participating in the actual cruelties.

        "A: I was born uh on uh May 12th, 1935, in Zwolen, which is in central Poland, uh Zwolen\nbeing a small town of about ten thousand people at the time uh half of which was Jewish and\nthat was about five thousand people. And uh when the war broke out...",
        "A: Uh my uh from my immediate family uh I have only a few uh memories uh but I know that\nuh there was uh twelve children on my mother's side. Uh there were twelve brothers and\nsisters of which only one survived the war, they having escaped in 1933 to uh what was then\nPalestine, and from my father's side uh where there were eight brother and and sisters, uh\nnone of them survived. But uh in the ghetto of Radom uh where I still saw uh the uh uncles\nand aunts and uh both sets of grandparents until 1941 uh I was able to see them.",
        "A: Uh my father was in the leather business, wholesaling. There were uh the uh town of\nZwolen, which was near Radom in an area where Jews uh uh were the tanners; and uh then\nuh uh the finishers of leather and uh shipping it to Germany and to the uh manufacturers of\nuh shoes. So he was, he was one of those that were wholesaling the uh the leather goods.",
        "A: Well uh, there are there are pictures that remain with you like uh you see in flashbacks in\nmovies sometimes and uh for me it's in real life several uh pictures that are alive to this day,\nand that would be like the first telephone uh that was installed in just before the war broke\nout and the reason that I would remember it is that uh I would watch people walking to uh\ntalking to the wall and uh that uh was such a wonder to me that uh I couldn't explain it and\nit's remained with me to this day. People walking up to this certain spot and talking to the\nwall. But uh the next uh flashback would uh be uh when the war broke out and I was four\nyears old, in 1939 the first German planes coming over our town and uh flying low and uh\ndropping their bombs and everybody running to shelter and uh screaming and just not\nrunning fast enough or uh one obstructing to wait for the other. The panic that uh ensued.\nAnd so on and so forth.",
        "A: Uh my uh in my immediate family we uh were four children. And uh it was my uh sister\nwho was five years older, a brother who was uh almost three years older, and then I had a\nS1...a younger sister (cough), excuse me, who was born in 1939. Uh after the war broke out\nand we uh were put into the uh the ghetto, uh sometime uh in 1940 we were uh put into the\nghetto in uh Radom uh where they would take a whole section and uh keep all the Jews,\ncollect all the Jews uh from the neighboring uh towns and villages. Uh we stayed in the uh\nghetto until about 1942...",
        "A: Uh, from the life in uh in the ghetto I have only uh few uh memories. But uh I remember that\nuh my mother had been uh kept at the police headquarters for a while and when she came\nback emaciated and so this picture that comes back to me. Of course I later learned the\nreason that uh she had been uh kept at the police headquarters was that uh my father had uh\nuh a lot of uh being that he was wealthy and uh had connections with the leading uh\nmembers of the community, so even after the ghetto was organized, he was able to uh obtain\nthrough uh uh payment a document from the uh uh mayor of the town in Zwolen and the uh\nGerman commissar, the German uh governor of the town, a special document for uh as a\nmerchant and uh supplier of uh the uh uh shoes to the German army and whatever, so he he\nobtained uh a passport uh so to speak, a uh it was which a document with which he was able\nto travel and uh the idea was that uh after uh the war broke out and the, Poland was divided\nto the German Russian sphere of influence, uh his uh he owned two trucks that were\nconfiscated so uh we couldn't get no means of escape but uh he was still dreaming of the, to\nget us uh out somehow uh with money that he still had and influence. So it was the travel\ndocument uh they plotted a scheme uh that we would uh hire a uh a horse uh uh drawn-\ncarriage and that was to take us to the other side of the river where the Russians were. Of\ncourse uh when we reached the uh bridge uh of that river, the uh German soldiers were there\nand uh two uh German soldiers on motorcycles uh would confront us with the carbines on\nthe backs and shout uh, \"Alle Juden [zuruck (ph)|, which reverberates to this day. And uh\nscreaming and the uh weeping by the women and children and nothing helped. We were uh\ndriven back to the ghetto. Uh eventually we were taken, the ghetto was liquidated and we\nwere taken to uh a uh work camp in Wolanow; and uh there we stayed from 1942 'til 1943.\nBut even there, my father had not given up; and uh he had uh uh bribed uh some people that\nhad influence, the uh head of the camp, to uh close an eye to the fact that we uh we would\nrun away. They would smuggle out at a certain time at the night. And uh it was before uh in\nDecember, just before Christmas time that uh we were uh driven on a sleigh to some village\nto uh uh to be hidden in a farmhouse, except that uh the farmer who was hiding us, he had uh\nvisitors and uh these visitors had heard one of the uh children was coughing or what, so that\nuh the farmer became afraid uh he would be betrayed, uh that he is hiding Jews, and we have\nto be smuggled back into the camp from which we had escaped. That was in 1942, the last\nchance that uh we uh we had still to uh to be free, after which uh on the raid that uh the\nGermans uh sent the SS to uh pick up uh old people and uh children, where my youngest\nsister was four. She was taken on a truck - all the uh screaming and all the yelling - it didn't\nhelp. And uh whether they gassed those people or shot them we don't know. It was the last\ntime we saw her. We stayed uh in Volanof until 1943 and were taken to another labor camp\nin uh called uh Starachowice and uh there we stayed until 1944. Uh...",
        "A: Uh in Starachowice, I uh I was not uh with the uh work squads that were uh going out, uh\noutside the camp working in factories uh whether it was munitions or whatever for the uh\nGermans. So I uh I cleaned the police barracks the uh and I served as a messenger boy which\nproved to be of uh crucial importance when uh the uh when uh uh making these selections to\nagain uh to pick out uh those unable to work whether it was children or elderly or or those\nthat uh became ill and so on. Uh I was considered uh important or productive and left alone\nso uh that when we arrived in uh Auschwitz I was listed as fourteen years of age and uh\napparently that helped me again uh be considered productive and not taken straight to the\novens.",
        "A: Uh up to uh Auschwitz and the uh ghetto and and the uh first subsequent uh labor camp we\nstill managed to be living as a uh unit, as a family unit uh even though my younger sister at\nthat point was taken away. Uh we were still uh with the uh parents as a family. Before being\ntaken to Auschwitz though, uh they uh loaded the uh men in separate wagons on the train\nand the women on separate wagons and uh when the decision was to be made how to divide\nthe children uh I was placed with uh my mother. They decided, between my parents they\ndecided that I should go with my mother and let my father take only my older brother with\nhim in order to uh have a better chance of escaping from the uh train uh when uh the train\nslows down or comes to a stop. They were hoping to be able to uh run away and uh he felt\nthat I was too weak and too young to uh to join him. And that proved to be uh a blessing that\nuh I went with the uh women's uh into the women's camp because uh the first selection that\nthey had in Auschwitz uh in the men's uh camp, they rounded up uh all the youngsters and\nuh my brother included and uh again he was uh at the time uh about fourteen, maybe going\non fifteen whereas I I was only nine. They took him with the other uh children to the uh the\ngas chambers. And that being on a uh special day, uh the Jewish New Year, the second day\nof Rosh Hashanah, which was uh Mengele's uh way of uh uh making a point of uh making\nselections on uh on uh Jewish events, Jewish holidays. And uh in Auschwitz uh when we\nhad arrived uh was the height of the uh transports and uh they didn't put us straight into the\noven because they couldn't handle that many arrivals in a given day, so that we went two\nweeks uh without a uh number. Eventually they did take us in and uh we became uh the\nslaves of uh Auschwitz, those that could still uh be useful to work. And uh the daily routine\nwas uh for the adults uh working uh in the nearby factories and uh I was uh a messenger and\nso on. (Pause) What uh got me to uh be able to survive the uh Auschwitz uh camp was a uh\nincident uh where a kapo had seen me with uh my uh mother and my sister at one time and\nuh she took a great uh liking to me or pity on me, and she would uh call me to her uh\nbarracks from time to time to feed me. There was one incident in which uh I I thought I\nwould never forgive myself. When I returned to the uh to my barracks with my mother and\nthat day not having been fed by the uh kapo I was asking for my uh portion of food which\nwas two slices of bread uh for supper and uh having no breakfast to look forward to and I\ncame home. I was uh hungry not having eaten and uh to discover that my uh mother uh\ndidn't expect that and shared the uh meal with my sister who told me that she gave it to my\nuh sister. And I carried on at the time, as hungry as I was and made my mother feel guilty\nand my sister feel guilty which uh I was ashamed of later on for a long time. And uh the\nthing was that uh as young as I was uh the drive to uh survive was so strong that uh you had\nto learn fast and uh whether from the kapo or uh by other means - I don't remember - I had\nsomehow managed to get uh ahold of cigarettes and uh when we were separated from uh my\nmother and from my sister, uh I was able to smuggle to them through a uh cousin of mine\ncigarettes that they should be able, in order for them to exchange for uh for food. And uh in\nAuschwitz itself an incident that uh only many years later I could comprehend what was\nhappening to me when uh the same uh kapo had uh brought one day to uh her barracks and\nuh during the daytime when everybody was out to work she had uh commandeered a uh a\nyoung attractive woman to wash me up and uh talking nicely to me that it's important to be\nclean and uh that girl carefully washed me and fondled me and then uh that kapo took me uh\non her bunk and uh tried to arouse me and uh as a nine year old boy uh lying beside her, on\ntop of her and in any kind of position, whatever she tried uh must have have been futile,\nfutile but uh that was the life in the camp for this poor woman. (Pause) They were a\ndegra...degradation that uh they put people to uh to the point that uh living was not worth\nliving. (Pause) And then uh remembering uh Auschwitz, being liberated when the Germans\nretreated ...",
        "A: I'm sorry. Uh uh one of the things that uh uh I had constantly uh in my mind was uh the\nvision the kapo having a uh round uh table uh sort of like this side table but taller and a uh\nshelf on the bottom. It was covered with a uh uh some kind of table cloth but on the second\nshelf being a piece of salami and bread at your disposal. And the idea that you would, you\ncan uh eat your uh your meal and uh have some left over, have uh extra food for later. It was\nuh the dream, a dream that uh was to be with me for a long time. Uh when we were liberated\nand uh we were being fed uh by the, at the time we were being cared for by the UNRA\nwhich was uh the uh relief organization, a Jewish relief organization active all over Europe\ntaking care of the refugees and survivors. Uh when we were uh being uh served meals it was\nnot uh a sit-down meal but you had to go to the counter and uh your plate was being filled\nwith the uh different foods and to this day I can remember that asking for uh when they filled\nmy plate for an extra spoon, extra spoon even though uh one would, should have uh known\nuh after the first or second time around that uh there's no need to fill up the plate that much\nmore than you can eat because uh some of it won't stay on the plate and you wouldn't be\nable to finish the meal or uh it took a long time to adjust and to know that uh you uh you\ntake what you feel you won't uh you'll eat and if you're not uh satisfied, that you can go back\nand get a second portion - took weeks before the mind (pause)",
        "A: Yeah. (Pause)",
        "A: (Pause - drinking water) Uh, at one point in Auschwitz uh that after I had met this kapo and\nuh as I mentioned uh if not for the food and occasionally a piece of clothing - she had a uh\ncoat commandeered for me uh because uh when people arrived at Auschwitz they were uh,\ntheir clothes with the outer belongings they may have still had with them, was taken away\nand uh we were given that uh pajama type uh prisoner's garb uh striped prisoner's garb.\nExcuse me. She somehow managed to get me a coat one time. Shoes and another time uh\nwanted to give me a toy that I refused and uh I pointed out to her that uh my brother was\ntaken to the uh to the chimney and uh this particular story I didn't uh, I cannot say that I\nrecollect having that conversation and but uh she told it to my mother, that I refused the toy\nand my mother had talked to me about it.",
        "A: I refused the toy uh pointing to the chimney and telling her that uh how can I play when uh\nmy brother was taken to the uh chimney. We could see from our camp that uh tall chimney,\nthe flame uh going up day and night, smoking. And uh the picture of a selection. Having\ngone through that uh once in your lifetime and you will never forget it. Uh the uh infamous\nuh Dr. Mengele, he would stand at the head of the uh column of the procession of uh naked\npeople and uh some way before reaching, uh coming up in front of Mengele, we saw that uh\nthere's left and there's right and uh what he was doing is he would uh people would march up\nin front of him and uh he would look at them and whether they are still able bodied or not,\nable to contribute uh toward the work, to the labor in the factories. So uh when my turn\ncame, and somebody was whispering to me uh to the right, and somehow I uh managed to\nstay in that right lane without being uh motioned back to the left lane. That's what uh made\nthe difference of life and death.",
        "A: Uh at some point uh in Auschwitz itself I was separated uh from my uh sister and from my\nmother and put in a uh children's uh block. In that children's block there were not only\nJewish children uh but also uh uh Polish and from uh Russian uh war uh prisoners of war,\nsome of them uh even younger than me. Some of them uh uh that uh were still uh babies\n(pause). When uh the Germans retreated and uh they took uh all the inmates on the forced\nmarch, they left uh the uh sick children and those that were uh unable to walk... They have\nbeen children under the age of six. Well, I hide among these and other kids; we managed to\nstay behind until the Russians arrived, and we were liberated in Auschwitz. Because those\nthat were taken on the forced march and those that were unable to uh keep up, they were\nsimply shot uh on the uh on the side of the road. After we were liberated and uh as I\nmentioned before I had uh run away from the camp when the uh first Russian soldiers\narrived and they had nothing on them but uh they were asking us for cigarettes or asking\nfrom us where's the uh supplies, and uh we had managed to find some sugar uh that was not\nburned and we showed them where the uh there was, where the sugar was. We took out with\nus uh a few sacks or whatever to uh and ran away to the city, to Auschwitz, myself and two\nother boys of whom I never heard again. These two boys uh may have uh ended up being uh\nraised by uh some childless family like uh I was supposed to. And as the uh the experiment\nby that couple didn't succeed...",
        "A: Uh from the uh camp of Auschwitz we went to the city, to the town of Auschwitz and where\na childless couple uh took me in and uh being that they uh worked both of them they would\nuh uh close me up during the day in their one room shack and uh disappear. Uh that didn't\nlast very long and I ended up in a uh monastery. But about uh whether it was uh two weeks\nor four weeks after liberation, they had organized the mass grave for all those bodies that uh\nwere collected uh of people that uh had been shot on the march and the retreat when the\nGermans took with them the, all the rest of the inmates. And uh all kind of bodies that were\nnot cremated but uh left unattended some of them till they starved and whatnot, so there was\nthis uh mass grave that the uh and ceremony that they had organized in Krak...Auschwitz\nwith the uh bells, all the churches uh ringing away. And that day I met I met up with uh the\nchildren that uh had stayed in the camp and uh now were collected by the UNRRA and uh I\nrejoined them. Uh everything by chance. If not for that uh I would have been in that\nmonastery uh growing up and uh stayed there in Auschwitz. It was the uh it was uh to this\nday I uh I remember the prayers in Polish and the original, the how they were teaching me,\nthe uh Polish nuns. And I would have been a good uh decent Polish uh Catholic to this day.\nAfter having survived alone the camps.",
        "A: The uh...",
        "A: Uh, in Auschwitz? (Pause) In Auschwitz uh I was uh not uh employed like the adults and\nuh it seemed that uh they simply didn't uh have uh the capacity to burn uh all the people\nwhen we arrived and uh they kept us there for a while until our turn would come.",
        "A: Oh yeah. After the war uh when they collected the children in uh in Auschwitz. Well, they\nuh they eventually collected uh all the children and uh not only from Auschwitz but uh from\nthe other uh wherever they found uh refugee children, survivors. They took us to uh Krakow,\nuh Krakow. And uh from Krakow, they took us to uh a resort place to uh feed us and to uh to\nput us back on our feet. Because uh we were skeletons at the time. And uh during that time\nuh when uh my mother and my sister were liberated in uh Ravensbrick in East...what was\nEast Germany under the Russian influence. And uh they went back to uh our hometown\nlooking uh to see who survived. And in those days, uh the UNRRA had uh lists of uh\nsurvivors that they were compiling and sending it to all over Europe and all over the world.\nAnd uh eventually, my mother got hold of uh these lists and uh found out that uh I was\namong those kids that were collected in Krakow. And uh she sent my uh sister, who was uh\nat the time sixteen, to pick me up from uh Zakopane, where we uh were...had been taken uh\nfor recuperation. After we were reunited uh with my mother we found out that uh our father\nwas uh in Germany. It took him uh sometime to recuperate; but uh then uh...he went on uh a\ntrip to Poland to look for uh...he seemed to have found out that uh myself, my sister and uh\nmy mother had survived the war, and uh he got uh travel documents. He obtained travel\ndocuments for us and he went to Poland with the idea of uh taking us to Germany, to the\nAmerican sector. We missed each other; uh because uh while he traveled to Poland, we\ntraveled to Germany to join up with him. It was already after the war, and uh the crossing of\nthe border from uh East Berlin to West Berlin was not uh just uh picking up yourself and uh\ngoing but uh we had to smug...be smuggled through and uh my mother was resourceful in\nthat uh she uh got ahold of the right uh conn...made the right connections, paid off paid off\nthe right people who would uh drove us to the western sector. Eventually we uh reached uh\nthe town of where my father supposedly was, and uh found out that he was looking\nfor us in Poland and had to wait and uh it took us a year before we were reunited, in 1946.\nBy the time uh they organized the uh uh first uh school we were about seven children and uh\nwe were lumped together even though we're not of the same age to uh to learn . From\ndocuments that uh I have uh to this day uh it's interesting to that in 1946 which would have\nbeen uh one year after liberation, I already signed my name with my own handwriting. The\nminute we were liberated it was uh the uh drive to learn and uh uh to write, to read and write.\nThe motivation was so strong that uh even before I attended formal school I uh I knew to\nread and write, to read and some somewhat to write.",
        "A: In Hamburg uh I stayed uh for about uh two, for about two years, two or three years; and uh\nthen uh I was sent to a uh bigger town in Stuttgart, where there were more uh Jewish\nsurvivors, more children and uh there was a bigger school. And then uh from there I went on\nto Israel where I finished high school and uh my parents uh had stayed behind. Uh they were\nstill in Germany and uh when I came back I uh stayed with them for another two years and\nthen went on to America.",
        "A: Uh they were tied up uh at the time already uh in uh in business. And uh they had a mind to\ngo to Israel eventually but uh uh they didn't want to keep me uh and uh to go to a German\nschool, so they sent me ahead and uh sent uh myself and my sister, they sent ahead to Israel\nto go to uh a Jewish school. When I finished uh uh when I finished high school I went back\nand was uh attended two years uh of the uh Technische (ph)...1n Stuttgart; and then went on\nto uh I went to New York, to America, and uh finished school in New York, at uh the\nColumbia University.",
        "A: On the uh it wasn't too personal level. Uh I had uh not seen in Germans any different uh\nhuman beings, didn't uh didn't see look at them any different than at other people and uh uh\ndid not uh feel uh outright uh anti-Semitism among the people except when you traveled to\nthe small uh towns and villages where they would display uh their relatives who were in\nuniform and you could see and feel the way uh they were uh proud of uh their service to the\nReich and in the songs that they were singing that many of them uh they uh they still lived\nthat uh era that they looked at uh as the great era of uh ruling the world and so on, and uh\nthat there were many of those that uh didn't learn a lesson among the older generation. But I\nmust say that in the uh university, at the university there were uh a lot of young people who\nwere no different than uh other uh young people in other countries that uh they did realize uh\nthat you cannot conquer the world and get away with it. So uh you you had uh among them\nthese uh uh young people that uh would stand up for causes of uh democracy and so on.",
        "A: Uh I don't recall much of uh the uh children that I was with uh except those a few a few of\nthose that uh survived with me. And uh we uh uh were not uh in in Auschwitz uh kept much\nuh like a a normal setting where you uh make friend...friendships and so on where you have\nan occasion to play with children and to get to know them much. Whether it was uh on uh\nappells, which meant uh being lined up uh for muster and uh that could take uh hours of\nyour time, or what uh as some other tasks of cleaning, whatever. Uh but no socializing per\nse.",
        "A: The uh barracks uh would house uh, well 1t consisted of uh metal corrugated uh structures uh\nthat uh had these uh two-tiered bunks, wooden uh bunks. They're wooden beds. And uh how\nwe managed to uh to sleep without a mattress or whatever, it's beyond me and uh working uh\nto uh outside when uh being taken to work in the winter time in these harsh uh uh winter\ndays in Poland with uh inadequate clothing and not having uh a coat and pneumonia the first\ntime around uh it's beyond me. But uh uh it seems that uh human beings are capable of uh\nsurviving uh great hardships uh and still come out alright. It's amazing. And that's one of the\nthings that uh looking back when you uh when you hear, when you read of how it uh\nGerman uh uh doctors would come and conduct experiments on human beings, to that\neffect.",
        "A: To the extent uh possible but uh you were uh subject to uh their total control (cough) and\nwasn't uh a matter of being able to intercede on behalf of uh your beloved ones. When my uh\nsmaller sister was taken from uh literally from my mother's arms and uh would have\npreferred to uh die in her place and uh there was no way of her to to stop it. The truck just\ntook off and they uh they beat her down to the ground, my mother and uh could do nothing\nand uh I can imagine uh after the war for all these years to have to live with such memories,\nwhat it means to uh to or to my father for that matter, that he couldn't uh that he couldn't\nprotect my brother and that the uh guilt feeling, uh him feeling that uh he had uh taken my\nbrother with him rather than having sent him with me uh and that in turn may make him feel\nguilty if uh if I was able to survive and uh if he had let my older brother go together with me\nthat he maybe he would have survived too. But that was the decision at that time, that uh he\nthough he would be able to jump the train. (Pause) Up to uh up to a certain point yes, uh my\nparents were able to uh when they still had uh they had money and uh where their\nconnections were able to uh do something for them, but when you reached uh Auschwitz, we\nwere stripped uh of our belongings and uh reduced to uh to objects that they could do with\nuh whatever they wanted. (Pause) You ask yourself uh how is it possible and uh (pause) to\nthis day when I uh after having uh read and trying to understand uh that whole episode of\nhuman history, how is it possible in the 20th century for a thing like this to happen and uh\nthere's contradictory feelings and uh (pause) to try to explain rationally - there's no\nexplanation. To try to say that uh (pause) once the people were told uh that this is the policy\nof the government and uh therefore the lower echelon would accept it and go and follow\nthrough. It's one thing when you're uh when you're told to go along and uh and people uh\nmay have tendencies of uh not to care about other people uh when can be possible but uh\nyou're talking of an entire nation and more than one nation that participated in this, meaning\nuh educated and uh people with uh feelings, poets, writers.",
        "A: (Pause) It uh it must have been uh maybe reduced uh a little bit of human life to the life of\nuh of a crude animal uh where survival is the only thing and it makes me wonder uh how do\npeople come out of this uh intact. That all uh all you learn is uh (pause) that uh that there are\nuh it's uh hunters and there are those that are hunted. And uh it's, it must have taken years to\nfor me to uh to understand uh what life is all about but uh (pause) again uh to come back to\nuh the after all this time uh that uh passed and I I uh I read some of the uh some of the books\nwritten about that era, and uh of the people uh that participated 1n it; and it's so hard to\nunderstand uh how uh you can find so many beasts that uh took pleasure in uh executing\nthese orders and and participating in the actual cruelties. I hope when you talk of Eichmann,\nthat people like Eichmann, who...uh Albert Speer I can rationalize, but I can say they were\nuh people that uh were at the beginning of their careers. They were in their early thirties or\nnot even thirty, and getting uh high positions and uh power and uh influence which uh made\ntheir sense their senses so it made them uh drunk with power and they were capable of uh\ndoing anything that uh...",
        "A: Bodily uh it was not only my brother that uh I would missed a beating, a beating that uh\nended up with uh one, one side, his right side having been completely disformed and that's\nwhy uh on the first roundup in uh in Auschwitz on the first selection, uh he may have been\nhe may have been, that may have been one of the reasons contributing to him being taken\naway without consideration . Myself I had uh uh at the end of the war uh I ended up\nwith uh two front teeth had been knocked out, the uh the reason for it not even clear to me.\nWhat I was suspected of I don't remember, but uh I was beaten by uh uh one of the uh guards\nwhat uh for having possessed a potato and being suspected of uh stealing it from the kitchen\nor whatever I don't know. I don't recall. But I was uh at one time uh washing the uh uh in the\nkitchen or helping in the kitchen and ended up being beaten up.",
        "A: Thank you for the uh the patience.",
        "A: It's something. It just uh doesn't come easy and uh this is one of the reasons that uh I uh uh I\nmeant to write 1t down someday rather than verbalizing it. It's uh very difficult.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
