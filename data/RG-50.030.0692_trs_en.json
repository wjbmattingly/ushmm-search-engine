        "A: A little bit of everything. I started out at Kodak working in a stockroom, a\nchemicalstockroom, where we used to fill orders for various chemicals for the\nchemistry departments of various universities. And I worked there up until I\nwent into the service.",
        "Q: Did you enjoy working for Eastman Kodak?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Yeah. Actually, if you lived in Rochester you worked for Kodak.",

And my wife's cousin was a grower of\nflowers and also had a flower shop and I used to work in the greenhouses and my\nwife worked in the store -- on the retail store,selling flowers and corsages and\ndifferent things like that. We went to the same church. Iknew my wife\nthrough my sister, Ithink, primarily, because they were in Girl Scouts\ntogether. |Our church sponsored a Girl Scout troop and a couple of Boy Scout\ntroops. We did go to the same church. She was in Girl Scouts with my sister\nand Iwas in Boy Scouts.",
        "Q: So you actually knew her from avery young age?",

        "Q: And were you attracted to her straightaway?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. She was avery pretty girl, yeah. And I think part of her family --\nmy wife's father was a World War I veteran, and the fact that I was -- ended up\nin the service, he thought I would be a good match for his daughter.",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were you married at that church that you --",
        "A: No, no. Iwas stationed in Tallahassee, Florida --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- and we were married in Tallahassee, Florida. And I went on the base one\nday and never came home.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah. She knew I didn't come home for dinner and I said I'm on my way to\nEngland.",
        "Q: Very good.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: About the war. When you realised, did you -- when you realised that\nAmerica was entering thewar, did you enlist, were you drafted? Tell us about\nhow you entered the service.",
        "A: I did not want to be drafted. Ihad acouple of reasons. One, I had an interest\nin flying and there was the aviation cadet program. And I looked into that and\nwhat attracted me to that, other than the flying aspect, was aviation cadets\nwere paid $75 a month versus 21 as a draftedprivate into the Army. So it was\npartly monetary and partly my interest in flying.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what were the qualifications?",
        "A: The qualifications to get into the cadet program was two years of college or\nthey said the equivalent. I didn't have two years of college but I did pass the\nentrance exam on various subjects that allowed me to join the aviation cadet\nprogram.",
        "Q: And did you study up for that or did you simple take the exam cold?",
        "A: I simply took a test.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: 1-- I don't want to say Iwas fairly intelligent but I had a fairly good\nknowledge ofmany things. I did fairly well in high school and had a good\nknowledge of English and chemistry and physics and most of the subjects I\ntook in highschool were in sciences.",
        "Q: Did you go to arecruiting station?",
        "A: No. There was -- I don't think it was called a-- I don't know, it was probably\nthe city hall where they were giving exams for aviation cadet recruits.",
        "Q: Was that the city hall at Rochester?",
        "A: At Rochester, yes, uh-huh.",
        "Q: When was that precisely, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: That was '43, I believe.",
        "Q: How long after taking the test did you realise that you were accepted?",
        "A: I probably knew almost immediately --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- that I had high enough grades in taking the test.",
        "Q: And were you given shipping orders at that time? Did you know whether\nyou were going to training?",
        "A: No, it was probably five months later that I shipped out to -- or I shipped\ninto aplace for classification.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what was that experience? What was your very first military experience\nwhen you entered?",
        "A: Oh, it was different. When I boarded a train, went down to Nashville,\nTennessee, we wereclassified -- actually we took some basic training down\nthere, we learned how to march and do KP and all the things that usually new\nrecruits do -- and took some tests down there to see -- we were in the Air Corps\nand to see what we would be classified as. And I had a preference of being a\npilot and passed enough of the tests that theyclassified me as apilot recruit.",
        "Q: And how did they establish that preference? Were you merely asked or did\nyou fill out a form? How did you express that you wanted to be a pilot?",
        "A: I think the fact that we joined the Air Corps we wanted to be apilot, period.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. And along the way they would classify you, depending on anumber of\ntests we took we would be a pilot, anavigator, bombardier. So I wanted to be a\npilot and expressed adesire to be asingle engine pilot. And there's aseries of\ntests, I think, that we took that they determined and sent us on for further\ntraining.",
        "Q: When did you -- when were you informed that you had been selected for\nflight school?",
        "A: I think from Nashville, Tennessee, which was sort of basic army training,\nwe went to Mitchell Fields and basically just went to school there. We studied\nmeteorology, navigation, map reading. We learned reading of code. They gave\nus basically a-- almost atwo-year college course in acouple of weeks.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They just crammed us full of knowledge, yeah.",
        "Q: Was it mostly -- what was the environment like? Mostly in the classroom,\nmostly in the cockpit orall classroom?",
        "A: It was all classroom. We hadn't even seen an airplane yet. Yeah, it was\ncertainly all -- and alot of military training, doing what you were told. The\ncadet program was like West Point, it was very, very strict. What we would do,\nwe had to do alot of parade stuff and we were classified as underclassman for a\nwhile and had to do -- we got hazed by the upperclassman. It was basically like\nWest Point, you know.",
        "Q: I see. What was the biggest challenge for you academically? Or was there\nany academic challenges for you?",
        "A: I can't think of any that bothered me. Most all my training came easy. I tried\nto stay out of trouble. One of the fears was if you were caught in a lie or doing\nsomething, they would wash youout. You just never wanted to do anything\nthat was not proper. We were trained to be officers and gentlemen \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and we just tried to keep our nose to the grindstone, because we didn't\nwant to get washedout. Flying pay was good, we all had adesire to be pilots.\nYeah.",
        "Q: Did you have any classmates who you felt were struggling, that you had to\nhelp out?",
        "A: Never got close to any of the classmates.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. At least I didn't. But in the thing they told us to look to your right\nand look to your left, one of you are going to get washed out. The washout rate\nwas fairly high.",
        "Q: Did that prove to be true?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of the cadets were washed out early. They couldn't\nmeet the academic standards or did some infraction or something like that.",
        "Q: Where did they go when they were washed out? Do you know?",
        "A:T have no idea. I think probably went back into service someplace.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So after you completed that part of cadet training, then did you go to flight\nschool?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And where --",
        "A: After I finished that I went down to Avon Park, Florida.",
        "Q: Uh-huh?",
        "A: There was a private airfield with private instructors. They were civilians,\nthey were not military pilot instructors. It was a primary flight school. You\nflew open cockpit bi-planes. It was a Stearman, with the wind flow --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: That was in '43.",
        "Q: '43.",
        "A: Uh-huh",
        "Q: Okay. | What was that experience like? Take me back to the first time you\nclimbed into a cockpit either alone or with another person. What was that\nexperience like?",
        "A: It was sort of scary. I had been up in asmall aircraft a couple of times prior to\nbeing in the service but it wasn't in an open cockpit-type plane. I was a little bit\nsubject to air sickness, and Iremember I used to carry alemon in my pocket and\nsort of squeeze lemon juice into my mouth to keep from being too nauseous.\nBut that went away with -- after some flights with the instructor. And we did\nmore and more crazy manoeuvres. We did loops, we did slow rolls, and I soon\ngrew accustomed to various positions in an aircraft.",
        "Q: Did you enjoy it?",
        "A: Yeah, I did. Ithought it was great. Here Iam, ahot pilot. But one day the\ninstructor jumped out and said, \"Take it up. Try not to kill yourself.\"",
        "Q: And what was that like?",
        "A: It was fine. [had no problems at all. I taxied out, did a circle around, came\nin forlanding. It was very good. Ihad no accidents, no problems at all.",
        "Q: Was the same sort of aircraft, a bi-plane open cockpit --",
        "A: Yeah, I soloed in the PT-13, a Stearman was the aircraft.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was nice. And we still got alot of instructions. We learned aerobatics,\nunusual positions and recovering -- stalls, recoveringfrom stalls. We learned\nall the basic things of flying. And I got through that without being washed\nout, SO...",
        "Q: You finish up at Avon.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Now what happens?",
        "A: Then I went to basic.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: I went to Macon -- no -- yeah, Macon, Georgia. Yeah, I went to Macon,\nGeorgia, for basic air training. Primary training in Florida, then basic\ntraining. And got abigger aircraft. Ithad more things about it. It was a low-\nwing monoplane, aclosed cockpit versus being in an open cockpitaircraft.\nStill had a-- I don't think [hada --Ithink [had an Army Air Force instructor.\nAnd, again, it was a plane that was different. We had, I think, a two-speed\npropeller. There were more controls on it. [think we had flaps. It was alow-\nwing monoplane. A lot more horsepower than the primary trainer. And, again,\nwe went through the same procedures of landings, take-offs, short field\nlandings. Just learning the basics with amore powerful aircraft.",
        "Q: What was that step-up like, to step up from the bi-plane into that\nmonoplane? Was it a huge experience?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. It was more powerful and you were enclosed in the cockpit. You\nhad more controls. It was -- it was nice. You thought you were on your way to\nbeing agreat pilot.",
        "Q: You enjoyed it?",
        "A: Tenjoyed it. Ienjoyed flying very much.",
        "Q: You finish up there, then what?",
        "A: Then I went to advanced training.",
        "Q: Okay. | Where was that?",
        "A: I think I went to (?Molta?), Georgia -- I think one was Macon -- did I say\nMacon\u201d?",
        "Q: Yes, Macon.",
        "A: Macon, and then I went to (?Molta?), Georgia, and we flew AT-6s, which\nwas the Texan -- had anickname, \"the Texan.\" Again, more advanced, more\ncontrols, retractable gear. We had flaps. We had -- each one became a little bit\nmore of achallenge. But it was not like learning everything at once. From\nprimary to basic to advanced, each aircraft was a little bit morecomplex.And\nwe did -- I think it was the first time I did anight flight. Up to that we had\nnever done any night flying. And in all these flying schools we did all kinds of\nmanoeuvres. We learned instrument flying. Put a-- hada hood put over\nour heads so we see nothing but thecontrols in front of us. And the instructor\nwas still with us, he could see what we were doing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. So we learned instrument flying where you've got to rely on your\ninstruments. You can get very disoriented. If you do some manoeuvres, your\near kicks off and you -- sometimes you can't see anything. You don't know if\nyou're right side up, sideways, you don't know if you're losingaltitude or\ngaining altitude. So each step along the way became more complex.",
        "Q: Was it frightening? Flying blind, you know, with that hood over?",
        "A: It -- I didn't find it difficult. We had some time in Link Trainers. Do you\nknow what a Link Trainer is?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: A Link Trainer is a little aircraft that's in a stationary position where I'm in\nthere, you'retelling me what to do, and you have a_ showing me what I'm doing\nin the aircraft. It's away to learn blind flying without being in an aircraft.\nHe'd basically tell you what to do and you'd do it. And you're just looking at --\nyou got to rely on instruments, you can't rely on your ear andstuff like that\nwhen you're learning to fly. You got to believe the altimeter, the artificial\nhorizon, the RPMs that the motor's -- you got to rely on your instruments\nbecause you can't always see the ground.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So throughout this entire process from basic training, to Avon, to going to\nMacon, to going on to the AT-6, blind cockpit training, what haveyou, what\nlength of time are we talking abouthere, this entire time?",
        "A: Two-month intervals.",
        "Q: They're cramming a lot into ashort period of time.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I went from not flying to six months later I'm a pilot.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. All our training was in two-month intervals.",
        "Q: Up to and through the AT-6 training, 1s there any training involving combat\nengagement up tothat point or is it purely flying at that?",
        "A: At advance training we did some aerial gunnery. We had a ship that towed a\nbig target and we shot at that. We had to be fairly proficient because they'd\ncount the holes. Anumber of us would be shooting at -- the AT-6 was the first\naircraftthat we had a gun, and our ammo was painted, the projectile. So if we\nshot at the target, as it went through the screen it left yellow or red, so that\nwhen you dropped the target you could seewhat your proficiency was in aerial\ngunnery.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Yeah. So we did that in advanced training. Advanced training was the first\ntime we flew acombat-type aircraft. Part of our training was _ to go down to\nAvon Field in Florida, and they had P-40s and we flew a P-40. That's the first\naircraft I ever flew with no dual time. Just sat in the aircraft, looked where all\nthe instruments were and took it off.No training whatsoever on -- the P-40 was\nthe old war hawk that was_ used, basically, in China. A very powerful aircraft\nbut sort of obsolete by World War II standards.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But, still, what was that first experience like, getting into that P-40, no real\nexposure to the aircraft before, going up in it, what was the --",
        "A: It was scary. Because when you put the throttle forward, the airplane moved\nand it was very manoeuvrable, but -- I don't know, it was exiting. It got your\nblood going like mad.",
        "Q: At what point during your training did you realise that you had been slotted\nand selected specifically for fighter pilot training?",
        "A: Oh, it was in the very beginning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I knew when I started\nflying that -- well, probably basically at advanced they made up their mind you\nwere capable of being acombat pilot.",
        "Q: Sure. How long did you spend with the P-40?",
        "A: Probably less than 10 hours.",
        "Q: And then on to what?",
        "A: Then Icame home on _ leave.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. At that point I graduated from flight school. Igot my wings. My\nwife came down, pinned my wings on me.I went home for 30 days leave and\nwas asecond lieutenant, single engine pilot.",
        "Q: What month, what year?",
        "A: August '43.",
        "Q: August '43.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: I was in the class of 43H, H being -- A being January, B February, so I was in\nthe class of 43H.",
        "Q: What happens after your leave is expired and you have to report back?\nWhere do you go? What do you do?",
        "A: I went down to Tallahassee, Florida and learned I was going to fly P-47s.",
        "Q: What did you think?",
        "A: Oh, it was great. Imean this was a_ big aircraft. It was -- it had more\nhorses behind that propeller, 2800 horsepower. It was a big aircraft.",
        "Q: Were you thrilled?",
        "A: Oh, it was great. [mean we were just hot pilots --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know.",
        "Q: Do you remember the first flight? Do you remember getting in the first\ntime?",
        "A: Not really. It seemed pretty natural. Because I had flown the P-40, which\nwas the fighter aircraft but sort of obsolete. Went down to Tallahassee -- and,\nagain, it's a single enginefighter, there's no dual time. You sit in the cockpit,\nyou learn where all the instruments are, you know where all the controls are to\npick up the wheels, the flaps and everything you need to know, and just go\nahead and fly it.",
        "Q: How much training did you have with the P-47?",
        "A: None.",
        "Q:None. You just -- that's it, you were in.",
        "A: That's it. Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: From the time that you were first exposed to the P-47 to then deployment to\nEurope, presumably, how long was that?",
        "A: Oh, golly. I was flying the P-47 in November, I went overseas in December.\nSo [had maybe two months training in the P-47 before I went overseas.",
        "Q: How did you get overseas?",
        "A: Ship. Boat.",
        "Q: Where did you arrive in Europe?",
        "A: Well, first of all, after I finished my training in the P-47 -- well, my wife and I\ngot married then. I mean we were married in November. And one night I didn't\ncome home for dinner and she knew I was going out. Inever said good-bye to\nher. My gear was all at the base and they closed down the base. I got a train up\nto Boston and a boat to England and she's sitting in Tallahassee waiting for me\nto come home for dinner. And she knew I was going overseas because all\nmy gear was on the base, so...",
        "Q: Were you trying to spare her the pain of separation?",
        "A: No, she knew I was going to leave.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I mean I think during World War II all the wives knew that their -- in the air\ncorp --were going to leave. They didn't know when, but it's going to happen.",
        "Q: Sure, but why did you choose to do it in that fashion, not come home for\ndinner that night?",
        "A: I felt bad because I couldn't say good-bye to her.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I couldn't make aphone call. They just closed down the base, put us on the\ntrain and we were on our way to England.",
        "Q: So it really wasn't your choice, you were sort of --",
        "A: It was not our choice, no. I didn't know if I was going to go to eastern -- or to\nJapan or to England. I went to England.",
        "Q: How did you explain it to your wife? Did you write her a letter?",
        "A: Eventually I let her know, when I got to England and could write.\nCommunication was bad during World War II. It took along time. She really\nhardly ever got your letter because if youwrote your wife it was photographed,\n16 mm film, went back to the States, and it was printed out on what they call V-\nMail, have you heard of V-Mail?",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: So she gets a little 4x 6 copy of the letter that you wrote, so...",
        "Q: That was so that the sensors could have a look at it.",
        "A: Yeah. Right. They looked at it, it was photographed, blocked out any\nreference to where you were in England, and she'd get a little photocopy of\nyour letters.",
        "Q: How long did it take you to get to England?",
        "A: I think it took probably seven days or so. It was aslow trip. Went over by\nboat. [think it was the EMPRESS OF AUSTRALIA or something likethat. It\nwas pretty nice ride over because as officers we had anice stateroom, we ate ina\nnice dining room, we had a table, we had tablecloths. And it was atroop ship,\nand alot of the troops were down in the hold under terrible conditions, I\nthought. I found that being an officer had alot of privileges. It was amazing,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Where precisely in England did you land?",
        "A: I landed, actually, in Scotland. I think we landed at Liverpool.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. Landed in Liverpool.I went over as areplacement pilot. Idid not\ntrain for the squadron or a group, I went over to England as areplacement pilot\nand didn't know where I wouldbe. So we went into this pool of pilots. And they\nsaid, \"Okay, we need two fighter pilots for Europe, we need four for there,\" and\nyou just sort of picked out where you wanted to go. And I had a buddy that I\ntrained with, and we went over to England together, and we found that the\n353rd Fighter Group only needed two versussomebody else that needed six or\nso. So we figured the guys that needed the least pilots were probably better, so\nwe chose that fighter group to go with. We had a choice.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So where exactly -- which squadron were you with? Where did you end up?",
        "A: I signed up to go to the 353rd Fighter Group and I was in the 350th Fighter\nSquad.",
        "Q: Which air force was that? Was that Ninth Air Force? Which air force?",
        "A: Eighth.",
        "Q: Eighth Air Force?",
        "A: Eighth Air Force. So the one we picked out was the 353rd Fighter Group\nand after getting into that group, then we were assigned to the 350th Fighter\nSquadron. The fighter group had three squadrons to it, it had the 350th, 35 1st\nand352nd, and we were assigned to the 350th Fighter Group. This was the P-\n47.",
        "Q: Right, the Thunderbolt.",
        "A: Thunderbolt Group.",
        "Q: What city? Do you remember what town or village you were stationed out\nof?",
        "A: The first base I went to we didn't stay there very long, but I ended up in a town\ncalled Raydon, R-A-Y-D-O-N. It was in the eastern area of England, in the\nEast Anglia area of Great Britain.",
        "Q: What did you think of England?",
        "A: Didn't see any of it. Imean at that time. We just took atrain, we got off at\nthis town of Raydon and went on to a base.",
        "Q: And did you spend most of your time when you were not in the aircraft on that\nbase or...",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Oh, we did get leave. We did go into London and stuff like that\non a fewoccasions.",
        "Q: What was your sense of how the English people accepted you or your\ninteraction with them?",
        "A: Thad basically no contact with them. On leave -- I only was on leave a\ncouple times andwent into London. And London was strange because it was a\nblacked out city. You were there with alittle tiny flashlight, they had a little\n(?slit?), that you didn't bump into people goingaround the town. Food was\nscarce in England at the time. I did know a family in England through Boy\nScouts. As a Boy Scout we used to sponsor -- or we used to go up to Canada\nand visit -- sort of an exchange with Boy Scouts, and when I went up to Canada\nthis family hada family in England who I contacted and had occasion tovisit\nthem. We used to take them some food items scrounged from our base because\nthey were limited in what they could buy. Food was scarce in England. It was\npretty much rationed.",
        "Q: What was your job as a pilot with the 350th? What were you tasked with\ndoing?",
        "A: Whatever the mission was. First of all, when Ijoined the 350th, that was in\nJanuary, I really didn't get to fly my first mission until almost March because\nthis fighter group wanted to train new recruits on how they did things, how they\nflew formation, how they attacked something and just what they did, so you\nwere comfortable and didn't run into each other in combat. So --",
        "Q: And what was that few months like for you?",
        "A: It was fun. It was good training. We did some dog fighting, we chased each\nother, tried to evade. Just to learn how to do stuff as this group did it. So -- and\nafter that then I flew first mission.",
        "Q: And what -- I want you to tell me all about that. What was the first mission\nlike? When was it, precisely?",
        "A: The first mission, if I recall -- I went overseas in January, first part of\nJanuary, I didn't fly my first mission until, I think, March. The biggest thing I\nremember is I was breathing hard because I had never seen theselittle black\npuffs coming up into the sky, the flack.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And I found that I got pretty low on oxygen, because I must have been\nbreathing very, veryhard. It was scary but exiting. And it was uneventful.\nIt was just sort of a milk run or escorting bombers into Germany.",
        "Q: What sort of bombers were they? Do you recall?",
        "A: Yeah, mostly all the bombers that we escorted were B-17s sometimes B-24s.\nAnd we couldn't stay with them very long.I mean they flew fairly slow\ncompared to us. So they'd be flying along and we'd be just sort of zigzagging\nbecause it was _+ get ahead of them. So we could only stay with them for\nmaybe 15, 20 minutes before anothersquadron would come in to take over and\nescort them alittle bit further. So most all our missions in the beginning were\nescort missions, high altitude, 28 - 30,000 feet, escortingbombers. Some of\nour missions later ran into the area were low-altitude missions where we'd go\nin and dive bomb a bridge, dive bomb atunnel, shoot up atrain, whatever our\nmission was. But most of them -- probably I'd say 60, 70 percent were escort\nmissions and some were just \"let's go in and target of opportunity.\" You see\nsomething moving, try to stop it from moving. Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you recall your first combat engagement?",
        "A: lTonly had one.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The day Iwas shot down. Iactually went through 55... 55 missions,\nsomething like that, and never tangledwith anyone. They were all escorts or\ndive bombing missions with no opposition at all. It wasn't until after D-Day\nthat we started tangling with things.",
        "Q: Tell us about the day you were shot down. Do you remember the day? Do you\nremember what month it was? The year?",
        "A: Yeah. The invasion was on June 6, that's when D-Day was. I flew three\nmissions on D-Day, mostly just trying to shoot up anything that was moving,\ntargets of opportunity. They were landing on the beachhead. I flew early\nmorning -- it was dark -- probably three missions on D-Day. Go over, come\nback, refuel, go over and try to stop convoy coming into the front, this type of\nthing. That was on June 6th. And I flew anumber of missions in between\nthere. And on June 12 is when I was shot down. We were, again, looking for\ntargets of opportunity on the ground and actually saw noenemy aircraft.They\nwere just scarce. So they were just like milk runs. And June 12th, out of the\nblue came probably 30 ME-109s, and out of the 16 aircraft they shot down 12 of\nus. [mean you couldn't turn anywhere without having a 109 onyour tail, you\nknow. Fired at acouple of them, did not bring them down. Got a few bits,\nthat's about it. Scared. I really got hit badly.",
        "Q: And you were going down?",
        "A: Yeah, I bailed out. Aircraft caught fire.",
        "Q: Right. What was that experience like?",
        "A: It was pretty natural. I didn't give a second thought of going over the side. I\nmean if an airplane's not flying and I'm init, I don't want to be in.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: You know. And my squadron leader was shot down and he said, \"I'm going\naway,\" and he died, he crashed on the -- he just hit the deck. And they shot down\nanumber of us. And now I'm in aforeign country, I'min France. I'm not\nquite sure where in France Iam but [knew I was on the ground, you know.",
        "Q: Do you recall what altitude you were -- roughly what altitude you were when\nyou bailed out?",
        "A: I was probably 1,400 feet, 1,600 feet. The chute opened and [hit the deck. I\njust went over the edge and pulled the cord. Iwas inthe air very little\nbefore [hit the ground.",
        "Q: Where were you when you hit the ground? In afield, ina --",
        "A: I landed ina field, in afarm area. Did the best to -- not bury my chute but\nkeep it under some brush, and before too long there was a fair few Germans\nlooking for me, and I just laid lowand hoped I wasn't caught. Had the Germans\nhad any dogs with them I'd of probably been captured then, but they did not find\nme.",
        "Q: Where did you hide?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Where did you hide?",
        "A: I just hid on the ground in some brush area. I could see them looking for me\nbut they didn't get near where I was.",
        "Q: How long did that process take when they were looking for you when you\nwere lying down?",
        "A: Probably acouple of hours Isaw them in the area and they disappeared.",
        "Q: Could you hear them? Could you hear them speaking?",
        "A: No. No, Icould not. No.",
        "Q: But you could hear them moving about?",
        "A: Other than they were looking for me and they didn't find me and I just stayed\nlow and tried to stay under cover.",
        "Q: When did you move from that position?",
        "A: During the night. During the night I left the position. I had a pretty good\nidea of where I was and I just headed towards where I thought thebeachhead\nwas. This was just six days after the landing on D-Day. So I was basically\ngoing west. We had a-- we carried an escape kit with us which had acompass,\nhad some pills for -- I've blanked on that word -- purifying water. We had\nmorphine which we could inject. Had we been wounded badly we could inject\nourselves with morphine. We had some maps, we had some phrase books,\nwe had somemoney of the area that we were flying over. So I just headed\ntowards the beachhead.",
        "Q: With the idea that you were headings towards American forces?",
        "A: Right. Right. Yeah.",
        "Q: What happened next?",
        "A: What happened next, I saw a farmer in the field and went up to him and in my\nbroken French I told him I was an American pilot and if he would help me. And\nhe was scared, but he did. He got me some civilian clothes. He got me some\nfood. He got me some maps of the area. He did not think I had enough money,\nso he finally gave me 500 francs or something, because the cost ofliving in\nFrance was fairly high, and sent me on my way.",
        "Q: Where did you go?",
        "A: I started towards -- [kept going west and approached another farmer that\ntook me into a town and put me in contact with the mayor of this town. He got\nme some papers. In England we carried our photographs in civilian clothes\nbefore. We started flying missions we were photographed in civilian clothes that\nwe could put on any sort of papers that we might need if we were shot down.\nAnd he got me some papers and took me to a farm where I stayed for two\nmonths. I stayed on this farm hoping to get into Switzerland or get into Spain.\nIt was German occupied, German soldiers were all over the place. But I stayed\non this farm and kept avery, very low profile. And I lived with this family for a\ncouple of months.",
        "Q: And they provided food for you and...",
        "A: Food, yeah. And then, as the Germans came close, they moved me into a\nwooded area. There was a little makeshift shelter and I stayed there for a week\nor two. And during the night they brought me food and some wine and\nsome Calvados,which is sort of an apple liqueur. And I stayed there for a\nwhile. And they came one day and_ said they had a passage for me. And I went\nto the side of the road, I was picked up by aFrench couple, take me into Paris,\nand they're the ones that turned me in to the Germans. They were collaborators\nwith the Germans. And went into Paris, had an apartment there, and I\nwas thereabout a day or two and the Gestapo came one night and arrested me,\nthrew me in prison.",
        "Q: Must have been apretty horrifying experience knowing that they were at the\ndoor.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, it was. Because I didn't know what they were going to do with\nme. They interrogated me. I didn't -- I couldn't tell them anything. Ihad\nalready been out of contact with the troops and what was going on inthe war\nbecause it was -- because _+two months, shot down in June and I wasn't\ncaptured until August, so...",
        "Q: When the knock came on that door in that Parisian apartment, did you know\nstraightaway that it was the Gestapo or was it --",
        "A: I didn't know who it was. They just came in and arrested me.",
        "Q: And were they uniformed?",
        "A: They were not in uniforms. They -- like you saw in the movies they were\ndressed basically in black. Maybe that was the Gestapo's uniform.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they had pistols. And they just told me I was under arrest and called\nme into Gestapoheadquarters and interrogated me for most of the night and\nthrew me in prison in the morning.",
        "Q: Did they interrogate you in English then?",
        "A: In very good English, yeah. I think it was amajor, German major, spoke\nvery good English. Knew an awful lot about the United States. Name, rank\nand serial number is the only thing I knew.",
        "Q: How did they treat you during the interrogation process? Were you struck?",
        "A: I was hit acouple of times with like a rubber truncheon on the back of head,\nbut they weren'textremely mean to me at all. They just tried to get me to\ntell them something. But Iwas already out of the war for several months at this\npoint. I didn't know what was going on from June until August when I was\ncaptured.",
        "Q: How long were you under interrogation? How long did that process take?",
        "A: Probably 10 hours or so. Yeah.",
        "Q: At the end of it, what happened?",
        "A: When I was handcuffed -- they picked up a young boy and I was sort of\nhandcuffed to this young boy. I don't know what his relationship was. He\nwas in the apartment that I was captured in. I don't know if it was the son of\nsomebody or -- but I was handcuffed to him all night long. We were thrown in\nsome room.And in the morning I understood he was executed, this boy. And\nI just was interrogated some more and went intoprison, Fresnes prison, which\nis abig old prison in Paris.",
        "Q: Who was there with you in_ prison?",
        "A: I was in there first with four -- three other prisoners who were French\nspeaking and later onI was put into another cell with English -- fourother\nEnglish-speaking prisoners. We didn't talk too much to each other because we\ndidn't know who was aspy and who was a good person. Because they would try\nto be friendly with somebody that maybe they'd get some information out of.\nSo we really didn't really talk too much to each other.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "A: Maybe three weeks. Because the troops were coming close. After the\ninvasion, by August they were getting pretty close to Paris. And one day they\njust evacuated the prison and put us onboxcars and we left Paris.",
        "Q: What was the boxcar experience like? How many men were put in there?",
        "A: A lot. We were inthose _ nights. Eight horses, forty men. They were able to\nsqueeze 100 of usina boxcar.",
        "Q: That was designed to accommodate 40 men?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you all were standing up then?",
        "A: We were all standing up, some laying down. Took turns.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We were pretty crowded in there. We had a couple of pales, one with water and one\nfor used water.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It was very crowded and very unsanitary. They had given us a loaf of bread\nand we were in that boxcar five days.",
        "Q: A single loaf with 100 of you?",
        "A: No, a single loaf for each of us.",
        "Q: For each of you for the five days.",
        "A: For the five days, yeah.",
        "Q: The doors open up, where are you?",
        "A: When they opened up -- well, they opened up acouple of times to let us\nrelieve ourselves on the way. When they finally opened up we were in\nBuchenwald concentration camp.",
        "Q: How do you know?",
        "A: I think some knew where we were. We thought when the doors would open\nwe would be ina POW camp, except I knew POWs didn't have striped\nuniforms, were not emaciated. They were like walking ghosts. And we just\nknew we were in Buchenwald but we didn't know too much aboutBuchenwald.\nI didn't hear about concentration camps when I was growing up. I didn't know\nwhat they were like. And they were bad places. And these prisoners were all --\nwell, they were Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, whatever Germany didn't want\nwent into aconcentration camp. And they stripped us completely naked,\nshaved every hair off ourbody, doused us with disinfectant, gave us a shirt and\na pair of pants -- was probably from somebody who died, they were civilian-\ntype clothes-- we had no shoes, no socks, and we slept outside, just on the\nground for probably five or six days. And this was in October. It was getting\npretty cold. We finally did get into a barrack type thing and we slept on these\nshelves and they had four tiers high and probably five men on a shelf. I lost 68\npounds in the concentration camp. You got aslice of bread in the morning, we\ngot alittle bit of watery soup, and you got coffee,maybe a slice of bread at\nnight. We were pretty much bitten by fleas and lice. It was -- Buchenwald was\nahorrible place. [know you've probably been to the Holy Cross Museum. It --\nit was bad. We were there until November.",
        "Q: You said when you arrived you knew it was not aPOW camp.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you think it was? Where did you think\u2014",
        "A: [had no idea, except all these guys were in sort of grey and black striped\nsuits, they werelike walking ghosts. We didn't know where we were. We did\nvery quickly know that we were in aconcentration camp, but I didn't know what\naconcentration camp was. I wasn't alone, there was 168 of us that were picked\nup in one day in Paris. They just swept through the city. They knew where they\nwere and they just decided to pick us all up. We were Americans, British,\nAustralian, New Zealanders. All airmen, some officers, non-comms. All trying\nto evade capture, and they picked us all up in one day in Paris.",
        "Q: When you identified that you had other allied servicemen with you in the\ncamp, did you do yourbest to stay with them or did you -- what was that like?",
        "A: Well, they kept us together. Yeah. We were together. We were always\ntogether. We didn't talk to each other very much because we reallydidn't\nknow if there was aspy planted in among us. Because we didn't know each\nother. We were only just -- I think some of the airmen knew each other, some of\nthe Brits probably did. And we just stuck together as a group, tried to act as a\nmilitary unit.",
        "Q: Explain that. What do you mean by \"tried to act like amilitary unit\"?",
        "A: We tried to stay together. We tried to stand at attention. We tried to act like\nsoldiers. And just weekly Ithink we had formations. We tried to just act\nlike soldiers should rather thanwander around the camp trying to steal\nsomebody's shoes or something like that. It was a-- we were apretty motley\ncrew atthis point. AsI say, there was 168 of us, so we all spoke English. And\nthat was the other thing, language is aterrible barrier. And there were Poles,\nthere was some Germans or some French,there were some Danish, there were\nall kinds of people, gypsies. All men, there's no women there. They did have\nsome women in parts of the camp, some children in parts of the camp. It was\na horrible experience because we did find out shortly before we were moved to\na POW camp that we were scheduled to get executed. We just missed it by afew\ndays. When we got there they said the only way out was up the chimney _ +.",
        "Q: Did you know that they were murdering people?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: How did they go about doing that? Did you witness?",
        "A: I did not, no. [saw some people that were hung. Isaw some people who\nwere pretty much beaten to death. If they went into a_ we didn't know, we were\njust a separate English-speakinggroup of people. We were in one area.",
        "Q: And why were they being hung? Why were they being beaten to death?\nWere these infractions of the rules or --",
        "A: Infractions. The concentration camp was guarded by prisoners. There were\nsome pretty mean prisoners who got extra rations, they got extra benefits by\nkeeping the prisoners in order, andthey would not hesitate to beat somebody to\ndeath. Concentration camp was just -- saw very few -- saw very few German\nguards or anything, they were all civilian guards. They were called \"kapos.\"\nI guess it's some name, probably is anabbreviation for something, whatever\nthis word \"kapo\" was. But it was just abad place.",
        "Q: You said there were children and women _ there. What were they doing\nthere? Were they the wives and children of some of the administration of the\ncamp? What were they doing there?",
        "A: I think they were prisoners. I think they were prisoners. They were in\nSeparate areas.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So sometimes you'd see them being transported to one part of the camp.\nThe camp was sort of segregated into various groups of people. Some may\nhave been children. There were some women prisoners there. There were\nsome children. The children were treated pretty nicely. I didn't see underfed\nchildren. And notalotof children, you'd just see them on occasion.",
        "Q: Were you made to work?",
        "A: On one occasion. There was an air strike -- Buchenwald was next door to a\nsmall factory andthere was an air strike and the factory was hitand they made\nus pick up fire damage, carry away some of the debris. And I think we maybe\ndid it for something to do. We didn't work very hard. Some of us carried the\nstuff out, some carried it back in, to make it look like we were busy. But they\ndid force us to supposedly work. And that only went on forafew days.\nThe air strike did not hit any of the prisoners. I think there were afew\nGermans killed in the air strike. That's as close as I want to be to an air strike,\nair raid.",
        "Q: It's frightening?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. Bombs make alot of noise when they go off.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: It was alittle bit away from our camp, where we were, So...",
        "Q: Did you ever identify yourself -- knowing that it was not a POW camp, did\nyou ever identifyyourself as an American pilot, as an Americanairman --",
        "A: I think we all did, yes. Ithink they did know. Because we were classified as\nPOWs, I think, in French prison in Paris. But when they evacuated Paris we\nwere just now politicalprisoners. They declared us political prisoners.\nConcentration camp, I don't think they care what we were. We were prisoners,\nperiod. As I say, they did have us scheduled to be executed.",
        "Q: It may sound like an absurd question, but did you make any friends in camp?",
        "A: Any friends?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Not really. Imade afew American friends. Some I stayed in contact with\nfor quite a fewperiod of years. There's not very many of us left any\nmore. Over 168 strong, we're probably down less than 20 now around the\ncountry -- or around, even, you know, Australia, England, because we were all\ntogether. So...",
        "Q: Was there aleader? Was there asingle man or acouple of men who stood out\nas sort of the group leader?",
        "A: There was an English officer who outranked us and he became the leader.\nAnd Ican't remember his name. I did have it written down, but ... but he had no\n-- he tried to keep us asa military unit. But once we got out of the\nconcentration camp into a POW camp, then there were leaders there. When we\ngot into Stalag HI there were some high-ranking officers that took charge.",
        "Q: When you were at Buchenwald did you try to escape?",
        "A: No. No. I don't know if you could. It was pretty much enclosed in electrified\nfences. And where do you go? You're in Germany now.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You don't have any allies like perhaps in France. No, we made no attempt to\nget out. I think that would be adeath sentence if you were caught.",
        "Q: When and how were you transferred to Stalag HI?",
        "A: A German Luftwaffe officer came into camp. And I don't know what he\ncame into camp for, but it was either an inspection team or something. And he\ndeclared that we were airmen and did not belong in the concentration camp, we\nbelonged in the POW camp and shortly after that we got moved out. But it was a\nGerman officer that declared that we were not political prisoners, that we were\nprisoners of war and belonged inaPOW camp.",
        "Q: Why do you suppose he did_ that?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Why do you suppose he did_ that?",
        "A: I think the fact that he was aGerman Luftwaffe officer, we were airmen, he\nwas an airman, and he just knew what was right.",
        "Q: Did you see him?",
        "A: Yes, we saw him because he walked through the camp.",

        "Q: How long after he left the camp were you transferred?",

        "Q: Did they tell you where you were going?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What did you think?",
        "A: Basically we were going to a POW camp. I didn't know which one or where.\nWe went there to Stalag III, came in, were greeted by abunch of prisoners.\nThey declared they never saw such aratty bunch of people, because some of\nus hadshoes, some of us had clogs on, some of us werebare-footed. We had\nraggedy clothes and we were dirty because we got no showers. We went a\ncouple of months without being able to shower. We were pretty smelly. We\nhad -- our clothes were basically rags. After Stalag III -- and they greeted us\nand first thing you know we were washed up, we had shoes, we had socks,\nunderwear, had auniform again. I'm American, but [had an Australian\nuniform.  Butit was anice uniform, it was warm clothes. Had nice warm\nbarracks to sleep in. Everything was pretty good. This was end of October, I\nthink.",
        "Q: Were you at all sick or hurt?",
        "A: No. [had diarrhoea a couple of times but that was about it. [had a short bout\nwith jaundice, but nothing bad. I was never wounded or had no broken bones or\nanything.",
        "Q: How much weight did you say you had lost in Buchenwald?",
        "A: Sixty-eight pounds.",
        "Q: Did you start gaining it back at Stalag Luft III?",

        "Q: Was the food acceptable?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Was the food all right?",
        "A: Food was great compared to what we had. We had Red Cross parcels. Even\nthough -- we were supposed to get a Red Cross parcel every week and we were\non half parcels. And we got foods from the Germans. We used to get potatoes\nand turnips and sometimes ahunk of meat of some sort. We ate very simply\nwell inthe POW camp. We were in aroom, each room held eight prisoners.\nWe put all our Red Cross parcels together. So even if we had four parcels,\nbecause we were on half rations, and we just sort of planned our meals. We had\none cook stove. Each room had so much time on the cook stove. We started in\nthe morning -- each room got one or two brickets. We'd start a fire and we'd\nkeep it going and each room would taketime to prepare some sort of a meal for\nyour room or they would do it through their room. Or sometimes you ate a meal\nearly, sometimes you ate ameal late, but it was just taken you only had one\nkitchen and you took turns using it. We cooked as a group of eight men using\nRed Cross parcels and what the Germans gave us.",
        "Q: And were the Germans running the camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And guarding it?",
        "A: And guarding it.",
        "Q: Did you interact with them?",
        "A: No, I did not. And I don't think we did. Other than to line up for a pill in the\nmorning and be counted and go back about our business.",
        "Q: And were you made to work? What were your days like?",
        "A: We were not made to work at all. Our days were going to school. We tried to\nrun some classes. I tried to run some classes in photography,because my\nbackground was chemistry, photography, I worked for Kodak. Other people\nwould try to teach a language. We had alibrary of many books. Some of the\nprisoners put on plays. This was a -- one of the old-time POW camps. It was\nmostly British, Australians were in there. We as Americans were the minority.\nAnd alot of the prisoners had been there for five years. They were picked up\nin boats when the Battle of Britain went on very early inthe war. And these\nwere old-time Brits that were prisoners after five years and we were the\nnewcomers. And they were just recovering from the execution of all the\nprisoners that tried to escape for The Great Escape when they executed --\nbecause The Great Escape took part -- some of it started in the barracks that I\nwas in. And there were mostly Australian and British airmen in our\nbarracks. We had basically just one room of Americans in this particular\nbarracks that I was in.",
        "Q: Did the long-timers talk about that escape?",
        "A: No. No. They didn't talk about it at all. We didn't talk to them very much.\nThe group of eight Americans that were in my room, we just talked to each\nother, basically. We didn't correspond or talk to the Brits or Australians.",
        "Q: And was that for the same reason, for fear of infiltration or...",
        "A: No, it was just -- it was just the fact that we were Americans, they were Brits,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Did the Germans at that time treat you properly?",
        "A: Yeah, they left us alone. Other than counting us twice a day they did not\nbother us at all.",
        "Q: Did you have any sense of what was going on in the war after being shot\ndown and all the way up to the point you were in Stalag Luft II?",
        "A: We -- you would get anews report almost daily. There was a clandestine\nradio someplace and wordwould be passed along how the war was going, you\nknow. Where this radio was I had no idea. These old-time prisoners were pretty\ninnovative of whatthey did and where they hid the stuff. Because | think it was\ndisassembled every time and put in various parts of the barracks. But we'd get\nanews report, yeah. We pretty much knew what was going on.",
        "Q: When did you know the war was over?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: When did you know the war was over?",
        "A: When I was liberated. We were down in (?Luisburg?), Patton's army came in\nand liberated us.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day, month or year?",
        "A: It was -- I want to say 29 April '44 -- was it '45 I think the war ended? Yeah,\nthe war was over with. Germany was defeated. Patton's army came in to -- we\nhad been -- I was at Stalag III and then we were force marched to another POW\ncamp and then we were force marched to another place. We ended up in\nsouthern Germany and then Patton was coming up from the south and liberated\nUS.",
        "Q: What was the forced march like? Was anybody hurt along the way or killed\nalong the way?",
        "A: I think we -- talking about killed, we did lose one man in Buchenwald\nconcentration camp. We had one lieutenant, L.C. Beck, he got pneumonia, was\nput in the hospital in Buchenwald and he died there. He was the only fatality we\nreally had of prisoners that I knew or prisoners that I waswith. I stayed in\ncorrespondence with his mother for anumber of years. Every time the allies\ngot close they'd force marched us out. And the first one was in the dead of\nwinter. I think we were given two hours to get ready to march in the end of\nJanuary. And it was a blizzard. We were trying to put together every scrap\nof food that we could put our hands on. We tried to take apart our beds to make\na Sleigh to haul, our bedding -- anything that we could carry. And I think it\nwas probably two o'clock in the morning, in ablizzard, they force marched us\nfor 30 kilometers to get out of the area.",
        "Q: What was the purpose of this?",
        "A: The Russians were coming in. They were going to liberate us -- not liberate\nus, but they would have liberated us. They just did not want us to be put back in\nservice. They wanted to keep us as hostages, perhaps, for some negotiations\nlater on. But they did not want the camp to be overtaken and have us liberated.\nSo they just emptied the camp. Gave us an hour or two to pack up and they just\nmarched us -- we ended up marching all the way down to Nuremberg over the\nperiod of amonth or so.",
        "Q: So when did you see Patton's army?",
        "A: Oh, April 29th, something like that. Yeah",
        "Q: What was that experience like?",
        "A: We knew we were liberated but we were still captive within the thing, they\njust did not want100,000 kriegies -- \"kriegies\" is prisoner of war in German --\nthey just didn't want a bunch ofkriegies running around the countryside\nliberating everything they put your hands on. So we were still held captive.\nBut we had alot of food then. We started getting some army D-rations,\nwhatever they called them. So they just -- they kept us enclosed.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "A: It may have been a week or so. And they started moving us out into France,\nto a placecalled Camp Lucky Strike where we wereinterrogated by our forces\nand, you know, what it was like and what we did and who we were. And we got\nsome army uniforms again and started looking like soldiers and made\narrangements to get back home. It took me 30 days to get back to the States.",
        "Q: Where did you go from France? Did you go back to England or --",
        "A: Went back to England. Got a-- scrounged aride on a Liberty Ship that was\nthe going back to Boston. It was unorganised. It was just -- we scrounged a\nbunch of food and we went back on aLiberty Ship and went home. We had had\norders in France to whom we had to report back to -- to fly, I think it was Fort\nDixon in New Jersey that we had to report within 30 days or something like\nthat.",
        "Q: And you said you came back to the United States via Boston?",
        "A: Yes. Uh-huh.",
        "Q: What was that like when you saw-- when you came ashore in the United\nStates again?",
        "A: It seemed good. I don't have a\u2014 because I was already free for some period\nof time and -- it was good to be home. What was strange, they just give us a\ntrain ticket to our home. I came into Rochester and didn't have any money, got\nacab driver to drive me to -- because my wife atthis point had gone back to her\nmother's house. And I just walked in on them. Communication was bad. We\ndidn't have telephones. Long distance was costly. We didn't have any money.\nIt was -- it was astrange situation. But we did have orders to go back into the\nservice for aperiod of time to get mustered out, you. know.",
        "Q: What was that experience like walking in on your wife?",
        "A: Everybody was in tears. They were happy to see me. They were glad\nthat Iwas home. There were alot of parties and, I don't know, it was just a\ngood feeling.",
        "Q: Did she know that you had been in aconcentration camp? Was she\ninformed?",
        "A: My wife did not know what happened to me for -- I went down in June and I\nthink it was late January before she knew I was even alive. I was just MIA all\nthis time. But she did finally get word that I was a prisoner of war, and that\nwas about it. [never -- never heard from anybody for awhole year. Had no\ncommunication. I didn't know if my mum and dad were alive, I didn't know if\nmy wife was alive. There was just no communication at all. There's certainly\nno mail in concentration camp. And, as I say, mail was slow, you know. So I\njust walked in, everybody was happy to see me. I said at the time I have to go\nback to Fort Dixon in 30 days and get mustered out.",
        "Q: How long did that process take? Imean you waited the 30 days, went back to\nFort Dixon, and then how much longer were you in before leaving?",
        "A: My official discharge didn't come into effect until October, but I was not in\nany place. I had built up some leave and I was paid through, I think, October.",
        "Q: Did you return to Rochester at that point?",
        "A: Went back to Kodak, yes.",
        "Q: How long did it take before you -- did you at any point speak to your wife or\nanyone else about your experiences at Buchenwald or Stalag Luft III.",
        "A: I think I-- oh, yeah, yeah, I think I talked to a lot of people at the time. I did\nsome talks for the Red Cross. I did some talks for some civic organisations\nback in Rochester at the time. Got some newspaper publicity. Even today I talk\nto school kids if there's any occasion that they would want to know about World\nWar II. [had one of the girls at the schools ask me, she said, \"When you\nwere shot down, did you call your wife and tell her where you were?\" All these\nkids have cell phones today.",

        "A: Almost immediately. It was acouple of weeks.",
        "Q: Was it a difficult adjustment returning home or to work?",
        "A: No. I was looking forward to it. Because I had 30 days leave and I did a lot of\nstuff, got alot of things in order. It was way past due on my income tax. That\nwas what killed me, that I had to pay income tax for all the stuff I was paid when\nI was in the service and was a prisoner. They didn't give me a free rein on\npaying taxes.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: There's a lot of legal stuff to go through and get back into civilian life. The\ntime I came home, then my discharge official was in October.",
        "Q: Did you ever fly again?",
        "A: I flew once or twice -- [had acustomer that had an aircraft, he and I went\nup a couple oftimes. Flying a_ is not like flying an airplane. I was used to a\nhigh-performance aircraft. SoInever flew any more. I had it out of my\nsystem.",
        "Q: This interview is going to become part of the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum's permanent collection. It will be used by historians as well\nas students of the Holocaust for many years. Is there anything you'd like to\nsay in closing?",
        "A: Nothing I can think of other than the fact I'm extremely proud that I had an\nopportunity to serve and I think I did some good during World War II. I have no\nill feelings towards my -- the peoplethat captured me and treated me -- my\nnature 1s not to be ever angry at anybody, I'm avery happy person.I have no ill\nfeeling towards Germany. One thing I have to say, Idid get some good\ncompensation from Germany after the war. One was for forced labour. As a\nPOW you were not supposed to work. I got that from the German government\nand I got asettlement from the German factories for labour I had put in and\nvariousaspects of being a prisoner. Both were around $50,000 each. As I say, I\nhave no ill feelings for -- war is not healthy. It's something we do. You have to\ndo for patriotic -- that's all I have to say. I'm proud I served. It was an\nexperience, so... That's about it.",

        "Answer: Richard L. Bedford, April 17, 1922.",
        "A: Iwas born in Rochester, New York.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: I grew up most of my years in Rochester, yes.",
        "A: It was pretty much, I guess, like anybody's childhood. [lived in arural area.\nIwas mostly surrounded by farms, and that's about it.",
        "A: My mother was a homemaker, my father was an oil mechanic, and I think\nthat's the only job he ever had, actually.",
        "A: I went to school in Rochester. I started kindergarten in the City of Rochester\nand later in life I moved to one of the suburbs and went to high school in a town\ncalled Webster, New York.",
        "A: Webster High School --",
        "A: -- in Webster, New York. I graduated from there in 1940.",
        "A: No. I'm not avery good sports person. I did play alittle baseball, and that's\nabout it.",
        "A: I did not go to college or university. I did go to night school, taking courses\none ata time or two ata time. Kodak paid for any -- I worked for Eastman\nKodak, by the way, and they would pay your tuition if you took some course\nrelated to your job. But I didn't actually get enough credits to get a college\ndegree.",
        "A: Immediately out of high school I went to Kodak and was hired.",
        "A: A little bit of everything. I started out at Kodak working in a stockroom, a\nchemicalstockroom, where we used to fill orders for various chemicals for the\nchemistry departments of various universities. And I worked there up until I\nwent into the service.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Yeah. Actually, if you lived in Rochester you worked for Kodak.",
        "A: Almost everybody worked there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I met my wife in high school.",
        "A: My wife went to a Rochester high school. She was in aclass after me. I went\ntoahigh school inadifferent town. And my wife's cousin was a grower of\nflowers and also had a flower shop and I used to work in the greenhouses and my\nwife worked in the store -- on the retail store,selling flowers and corsages and\ndifferent things like that. We went to the same church. Iknew my wife\nthrough my sister, Ithink, primarily, because they were in Girl Scouts\ntogether. |Our church sponsored a Girl Scout troop and a couple of Boy Scout\ntroops. We did go to the same church. She was in Girl Scouts with my sister\nand Iwas in Boy Scouts.",
        "A: [knew her from -- oh, golly. She was probably 16 or 17.",
        "A: When I first started taking notice of girls.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. She was avery pretty girl, yeah. And I think part of her family --\nmy wife's father was a World War I veteran, and the fact that I was -- ended up\nin the service, he thought I would be a good match for his daughter.",
        "A: Doris.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Her first name?",
        "A: Her full name was Doris Petroff, P-E-T-R-O-F-F.",
        "A: Married in 1943.",
        "A: Right after I got out of flight school.",
        "A: No. No. We were married in November of '43 and was married about five\nweeks and I wentoverseas.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no. Iwas stationed in Tallahassee, Florida --",
        "A: -- and we were married in Tallahassee, Florida. And I went on the base one\nday and never came home.",
        "A: Yeah. She knew I didn't come home for dinner and I said I'm on my way to\nEngland.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I did not want to be drafted. Ihad acouple of reasons. One, I had an interest\nin flying and there was the aviation cadet program. And I looked into that and\nwhat attracted me to that, other than the flying aspect, was aviation cadets\nwere paid $75 a month versus 21 as a draftedprivate into the Army. So it was\npartly monetary and partly my interest in flying.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The qualifications to get into the cadet program was two years of college or\nthey said the equivalent. I didn't have two years of college but I did pass the\nentrance exam on various subjects that allowed me to join the aviation cadet\nprogram.",
        "A: I simply took a test.",
        "A: 1-- I don't want to say Iwas fairly intelligent but I had a fairly good\nknowledge ofmany things. I did fairly well in high school and had a good\nknowledge of English and chemistry and physics and most of the subjects I\ntook in highschool were in sciences.",
        "A: No. There was -- I don't think it was called a-- I don't know, it was probably\nthe city hall where they were giving exams for aviation cadet recruits.",
        "A: At Rochester, yes, uh-huh.",
        "A: That was '43, I believe.",
        "A: I probably knew almost immediately --",
        "A: -- that I had high enough grades in taking the test.",
        "A: No, it was probably five months later that I shipped out to -- or I shipped\ninto aplace for classification.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, it was different. When I boarded a train, went down to Nashville,\nTennessee, we wereclassified -- actually we took some basic training down\nthere, we learned how to march and do KP and all the things that usually new\nrecruits do -- and took some tests down there to see -- we were in the Air Corps\nand to see what we would be classified as. And I had a preference of being a\npilot and passed enough of the tests that theyclassified me as apilot recruit.",
        "A: I think the fact that we joined the Air Corps we wanted to be apilot, period.",
        "A: Yeah. And along the way they would classify you, depending on anumber of\ntests we took we would be a pilot, anavigator, bombardier. So I wanted to be a\npilot and expressed adesire to be asingle engine pilot. And there's aseries of\ntests, I think, that we took that they determined and sent us on for further\ntraining.",
        "A: I think from Nashville, Tennessee, which was sort of basic army training,\nwe went to Mitchell Fields and basically just went to school there. We studied\nmeteorology, navigation, map reading. We learned reading of code. They gave\nus basically a-- almost atwo-year college course in acouple of weeks.",
        "A: They just crammed us full of knowledge, yeah.",
        "A: It was all classroom. We hadn't even seen an airplane yet. Yeah, it was\ncertainly all -- and alot of military training, doing what you were told. The\ncadet program was like West Point, it was very, very strict. What we would do,\nwe had to do alot of parade stuff and we were classified as underclassman for a\nwhile and had to do -- we got hazed by the upperclassman. It was basically like\nWest Point, you know.",
        "A: I can't think of any that bothered me. Most all my training came easy. I tried\nto stay out of trouble. One of the fears was if you were caught in a lie or doing\nsomething, they would wash youout. You just never wanted to do anything\nthat was not proper. We were trained to be officers and gentlemen \u2014",
        "A: -- and we just tried to keep our nose to the grindstone, because we didn't\nwant to get washedout. Flying pay was good, we all had adesire to be pilots.\nYeah.",
        "A: Never got close to any of the classmates.",
        "A: Yeah. At least I didn't. But in the thing they told us to look to your right\nand look to your left, one of you are going to get washed out. The washout rate\nwas fairly high.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of the cadets were washed out early. They couldn't\nmeet the academic standards or did some infraction or something like that.",
        "A:T have no idea. I think probably went back into service someplace.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: After I finished that I went down to Avon Park, Florida.",
        "A: There was a private airfield with private instructors. They were civilians,\nthey were not military pilot instructors. It was a primary flight school. You\nflew open cockpit bi-planes. It was a Stearman, with the wind flow --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That was in '43.",
        "A: Uh-huh",
        "A: It was sort of scary. I had been up in asmall aircraft a couple of times prior to\nbeing in the service but it wasn't in an open cockpit-type plane. I was a little bit\nsubject to air sickness, and Iremember I used to carry alemon in my pocket and\nsort of squeeze lemon juice into my mouth to keep from being too nauseous.\nBut that went away with -- after some flights with the instructor. And we did\nmore and more crazy manoeuvres. We did loops, we did slow rolls, and I soon\ngrew accustomed to various positions in an aircraft.",
        "A: Yeah, I did. Ithought it was great. Here Iam, ahot pilot. But one day the\ninstructor jumped out and said, \"Take it up. Try not to kill yourself.\"",
        "A: It was fine. [had no problems at all. I taxied out, did a circle around, came\nin forlanding. It was very good. Ihad no accidents, no problems at all.",
        "A: Yeah, I soloed in the PT-13, a Stearman was the aircraft.",
        "A: It was nice. And we still got alot of instructions. We learned aerobatics,\nunusual positions and recovering -- stalls, recoveringfrom stalls. We learned\nall the basic things of flying. And I got through that without being washed\nout, SO...",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Then I went to basic.",
        "A: I went to Macon -- no -- yeah, Macon, Georgia. Yeah, I went to Macon,\nGeorgia, for basic air training. Primary training in Florida, then basic\ntraining. And got abigger aircraft. Ithad more things about it. It was a low-\nwing monoplane, aclosed cockpit versus being in an open cockpitaircraft.\nStill had a-- I don't think [hada --Ithink [had an Army Air Force instructor.\nAnd, again, it was a plane that was different. We had, I think, a two-speed\npropeller. There were more controls on it. [think we had flaps. It was alow-\nwing monoplane. A lot more horsepower than the primary trainer. And, again,\nwe went through the same procedures of landings, take-offs, short field\nlandings. Just learning the basics with amore powerful aircraft.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. It was more powerful and you were enclosed in the cockpit. You\nhad more controls. It was -- it was nice. You thought you were on your way to\nbeing agreat pilot.",
        "A: Tenjoyed it. Ienjoyed flying very much.",
        "A: Then I went to advanced training.",
        "A: I think I went to (?Molta?), Georgia -- I think one was Macon -- did I say\nMacon\u201d?",
        "A: Macon, and then I went to (?Molta?), Georgia, and we flew AT-6s, which\nwas the Texan -- had anickname, \"the Texan.\" Again, more advanced, more\ncontrols, retractable gear. We had flaps. We had -- each one became a little bit\nmore of achallenge. But it was not like learning everything at once. From\nprimary to basic to advanced, each aircraft was a little bit morecomplex.And\nwe did -- I think it was the first time I did anight flight. Up to that we had\nnever done any night flying. And in all these flying schools we did all kinds of\nmanoeuvres. We learned instrument flying. Put a-- hada hood put over\nour heads so we see nothing but thecontrols in front of us. And the instructor\nwas still with us, he could see what we were doing.",
        "A: Yeah. So we learned instrument flying where you've got to rely on your\ninstruments. You can get very disoriented. If you do some manoeuvres, your\near kicks off and you -- sometimes you can't see anything. You don't know if\nyou're right side up, sideways, you don't know if you're losingaltitude or\ngaining altitude. So each step along the way became more complex.",
        "A: It -- I didn't find it difficult. We had some time in Link Trainers. Do you\nknow what a Link Trainer is?",
        "A: A Link Trainer is a little aircraft that's in a stationary position where I'm in\nthere, you'retelling me what to do, and you have a_ showing me what I'm doing\nin the aircraft. It's away to learn blind flying without being in an aircraft.\nHe'd basically tell you what to do and you'd do it. And you're just looking at --\nyou got to rely on instruments, you can't rely on your ear andstuff like that\nwhen you're learning to fly. You got to believe the altimeter, the artificial\nhorizon, the RPMs that the motor's -- you got to rely on your instruments\nbecause you can't always see the ground.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Two-month intervals.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I went from not flying to six months later I'm a pilot.",
        "A: Yeah. All our training was in two-month intervals.",
        "A: At advance training we did some aerial gunnery. We had a ship that towed a\nbig target and we shot at that. We had to be fairly proficient because they'd\ncount the holes. Anumber of us would be shooting at -- the AT-6 was the first\naircraftthat we had a gun, and our ammo was painted, the projectile. So if we\nshot at the target, as it went through the screen it left yellow or red, so that\nwhen you dropped the target you could seewhat your proficiency was in aerial\ngunnery.",
        "A: Yeah. So we did that in advanced training. Advanced training was the first\ntime we flew acombat-type aircraft. Part of our training was _ to go down to\nAvon Field in Florida, and they had P-40s and we flew a P-40. That's the first\naircraft I ever flew with no dual time. Just sat in the aircraft, looked where all\nthe instruments were and took it off.No training whatsoever on -- the P-40 was\nthe old war hawk that was_ used, basically, in China. A very powerful aircraft\nbut sort of obsolete by World War II standards.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: It was scary. Because when you put the throttle forward, the airplane moved\nand it was very manoeuvrable, but -- I don't know, it was exiting. It got your\nblood going like mad.",
        "A: Oh, it was in the very beginning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I knew when I started\nflying that -- well, probably basically at advanced they made up their mind you\nwere capable of being acombat pilot.",
        "A: Probably less than 10 hours.",
        "A: Then Icame home on _ leave.",
        "A: Yeah. At that point I graduated from flight school. Igot my wings. My\nwife came down, pinned my wings on me.I went home for 30 days leave and\nwas asecond lieutenant, single engine pilot.",
        "A: August '43.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was in the class of 43H, H being -- A being January, B February, so I was in\nthe class of 43H.",
        "A: I went down to Tallahassee, Florida and learned I was going to fly P-47s.",
        "A: Oh, it was great. Imean this was a_ big aircraft. It was -- it had more\nhorses behind that propeller, 2800 horsepower. It was a big aircraft.",
        "A: Oh, it was great. [mean we were just hot pilots --",
        "A: -- you know.",
        "A: Not really. It seemed pretty natural. Because I had flown the P-40, which\nwas the fighter aircraft but sort of obsolete. Went down to Tallahassee -- and,\nagain, it's a single enginefighter, there's no dual time. You sit in the cockpit,\nyou learn where all the instruments are, you know where all the controls are to\npick up the wheels, the flaps and everything you need to know, and just go\nahead and fly it.",
        "A: None.",
        "A: That's it. Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, golly. I was flying the P-47 in November, I went overseas in December.\nSo [had maybe two months training in the P-47 before I went overseas.",
        "A: Ship. Boat.",
        "A: Well, first of all, after I finished my training in the P-47 -- well, my wife and I\ngot married then. I mean we were married in November. And one night I didn't\ncome home for dinner and she knew I was going out. Inever said good-bye to\nher. My gear was all at the base and they closed down the base. I got a train up\nto Boston and a boat to England and she's sitting in Tallahassee waiting for me\nto come home for dinner. And she knew I was going overseas because all\nmy gear was on the base, so...",
        "A: No, she knew I was going to leave.",
        "A: I mean I think during World War II all the wives knew that their -- in the air\ncorp --were going to leave. They didn't know when, but it's going to happen.",
        "A: I felt bad because I couldn't say good-bye to her.",
        "A: I couldn't make aphone call. They just closed down the base, put us on the\ntrain and we were on our way to England.",
        "A: It was not our choice, no. I didn't know if I was going to go to eastern -- or to\nJapan or to England. I went to England.",
        "A: Eventually I let her know, when I got to England and could write.\nCommunication was bad during World War II. It took along time. She really\nhardly ever got your letter because if youwrote your wife it was photographed,\n16 mm film, went back to the States, and it was printed out on what they call V-\nMail, have you heard of V-Mail?",
        "A: So she gets a little 4x 6 copy of the letter that you wrote, so...",
        "A: Yeah. Right. They looked at it, it was photographed, blocked out any\nreference to where you were in England, and she'd get a little photocopy of\nyour letters.",
        "A: I think it took probably seven days or so. It was aslow trip. Went over by\nboat. [think it was the EMPRESS OF AUSTRALIA or something likethat. It\nwas pretty nice ride over because as officers we had anice stateroom, we ate ina\nnice dining room, we had a table, we had tablecloths. And it was atroop ship,\nand alot of the troops were down in the hold under terrible conditions, I\nthought. I found that being an officer had alot of privileges. It was amazing,\nyou know.",
        "A: I landed, actually, in Scotland. I think we landed at Liverpool.",
        "A: Yeah. Landed in Liverpool.I went over as areplacement pilot. Idid not\ntrain for the squadron or a group, I went over to England as areplacement pilot\nand didn't know where I wouldbe. So we went into this pool of pilots. And they\nsaid, \"Okay, we need two fighter pilots for Europe, we need four for there,\" and\nyou just sort of picked out where you wanted to go. And I had a buddy that I\ntrained with, and we went over to England together, and we found that the\n353rd Fighter Group only needed two versussomebody else that needed six or\nso. So we figured the guys that needed the least pilots were probably better, so\nwe chose that fighter group to go with. We had a choice.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I signed up to go to the 353rd Fighter Group and I was in the 350th Fighter\nSquad.",
        "A: Eighth.",
        "A: Eighth Air Force. So the one we picked out was the 353rd Fighter Group\nand after getting into that group, then we were assigned to the 350th Fighter\nSquadron. The fighter group had three squadrons to it, it had the 350th, 35 1st\nand352nd, and we were assigned to the 350th Fighter Group. This was the P-\n47.",
        "A: Thunderbolt Group.",
        "A: The first base I went to we didn't stay there very long, but I ended up in a town\ncalled Raydon, R-A-Y-D-O-N. It was in the eastern area of England, in the\nEast Anglia area of Great Britain.",
        "A: Didn't see any of it. Imean at that time. We just took atrain, we got off at\nthis town of Raydon and went on to a base.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Oh, we did get leave. We did go into London and stuff like that\non a fewoccasions.",
        "A: Thad basically no contact with them. On leave -- I only was on leave a\ncouple times andwent into London. And London was strange because it was a\nblacked out city. You were there with alittle tiny flashlight, they had a little\n(?slit?), that you didn't bump into people goingaround the town. Food was\nscarce in England at the time. I did know a family in England through Boy\nScouts. As a Boy Scout we used to sponsor -- or we used to go up to Canada\nand visit -- sort of an exchange with Boy Scouts, and when I went up to Canada\nthis family hada family in England who I contacted and had occasion tovisit\nthem. We used to take them some food items scrounged from our base because\nthey were limited in what they could buy. Food was scarce in England. It was\npretty much rationed.",
        "A: Whatever the mission was. First of all, when Ijoined the 350th, that was in\nJanuary, I really didn't get to fly my first mission until almost March because\nthis fighter group wanted to train new recruits on how they did things, how they\nflew formation, how they attacked something and just what they did, so you\nwere comfortable and didn't run into each other in combat. So --",
        "A: It was fun. It was good training. We did some dog fighting, we chased each\nother, tried to evade. Just to learn how to do stuff as this group did it. So -- and\nafter that then I flew first mission.",
        "A: The first mission, if I recall -- I went overseas in January, first part of\nJanuary, I didn't fly my first mission until, I think, March. The biggest thing I\nremember is I was breathing hard because I had never seen theselittle black\npuffs coming up into the sky, the flack.",
        "A: And I found that I got pretty low on oxygen, because I must have been\nbreathing very, veryhard. It was scary but exiting. And it was uneventful.\nIt was just sort of a milk run or escorting bombers into Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, mostly all the bombers that we escorted were B-17s sometimes B-24s.\nAnd we couldn't stay with them very long.I mean they flew fairly slow\ncompared to us. So they'd be flying along and we'd be just sort of zigzagging\nbecause it was _+ get ahead of them. So we could only stay with them for\nmaybe 15, 20 minutes before anothersquadron would come in to take over and\nescort them alittle bit further. So most all our missions in the beginning were\nescort missions, high altitude, 28 - 30,000 feet, escortingbombers. Some of\nour missions later ran into the area were low-altitude missions where we'd go\nin and dive bomb a bridge, dive bomb atunnel, shoot up atrain, whatever our\nmission was. But most of them -- probably I'd say 60, 70 percent were escort\nmissions and some were just \"let's go in and target of opportunity.\" You see\nsomething moving, try to stop it from moving. Yeah.",
        "A: lTonly had one.",
        "A: The day Iwas shot down. Iactually went through 55... 55 missions,\nsomething like that, and never tangledwith anyone. They were all escorts or\ndive bombing missions with no opposition at all. It wasn't until after D-Day\nthat we started tangling with things.",
        "A: Yeah. The invasion was on June 6, that's when D-Day was. I flew three\nmissions on D-Day, mostly just trying to shoot up anything that was moving,\ntargets of opportunity. They were landing on the beachhead. I flew early\nmorning -- it was dark -- probably three missions on D-Day. Go over, come\nback, refuel, go over and try to stop convoy coming into the front, this type of\nthing. That was on June 6th. And I flew anumber of missions in between\nthere. And on June 12 is when I was shot down. We were, again, looking for\ntargets of opportunity on the ground and actually saw noenemy aircraft.They\nwere just scarce. So they were just like milk runs. And June 12th, out of the\nblue came probably 30 ME-109s, and out of the 16 aircraft they shot down 12 of\nus. [mean you couldn't turn anywhere without having a 109 onyour tail, you\nknow. Fired at acouple of them, did not bring them down. Got a few bits,\nthat's about it. Scared. I really got hit badly.",
        "A: Yeah, I bailed out. Aircraft caught fire.",
        "A: It was pretty natural. I didn't give a second thought of going over the side. I\nmean if an airplane's not flying and I'm init, I don't want to be in.",
        "A: You know. And my squadron leader was shot down and he said, \"I'm going\naway,\" and he died, he crashed on the -- he just hit the deck. And they shot down\nanumber of us. And now I'm in aforeign country, I'min France. I'm not\nquite sure where in France Iam but [knew I was on the ground, you know.",
        "A: I was probably 1,400 feet, 1,600 feet. The chute opened and [hit the deck. I\njust went over the edge and pulled the cord. Iwas inthe air very little\nbefore [hit the ground.",
        "A: I landed ina field, in afarm area. Did the best to -- not bury my chute but\nkeep it under some brush, and before too long there was a fair few Germans\nlooking for me, and I just laid lowand hoped I wasn't caught. Had the Germans\nhad any dogs with them I'd of probably been captured then, but they did not find\nme.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: I just hid on the ground in some brush area. I could see them looking for me\nbut they didn't get near where I was.",
        "A: Probably acouple of hours Isaw them in the area and they disappeared.",
        "A: No. No, Icould not. No.",
        "A: Other than they were looking for me and they didn't find me and I just stayed\nlow and tried to stay under cover.",
        "A: During the night. During the night I left the position. I had a pretty good\nidea of where I was and I just headed towards where I thought thebeachhead\nwas. This was just six days after the landing on D-Day. So I was basically\ngoing west. We had a-- we carried an escape kit with us which had acompass,\nhad some pills for -- I've blanked on that word -- purifying water. We had\nmorphine which we could inject. Had we been wounded badly we could inject\nourselves with morphine. We had some maps, we had some phrase books,\nwe had somemoney of the area that we were flying over. So I just headed\ntowards the beachhead.",
        "A: Right. Right. Yeah.",
        "A: What happened next, I saw a farmer in the field and went up to him and in my\nbroken French I told him I was an American pilot and if he would help me. And\nhe was scared, but he did. He got me some civilian clothes. He got me some\nfood. He got me some maps of the area. He did not think I had enough money,\nso he finally gave me 500 francs or something, because the cost ofliving in\nFrance was fairly high, and sent me on my way.",
        "A: I started towards -- [kept going west and approached another farmer that\ntook me into a town and put me in contact with the mayor of this town. He got\nme some papers. In England we carried our photographs in civilian clothes\nbefore. We started flying missions we were photographed in civilian clothes that\nwe could put on any sort of papers that we might need if we were shot down.\nAnd he got me some papers and took me to a farm where I stayed for two\nmonths. I stayed on this farm hoping to get into Switzerland or get into Spain.\nIt was German occupied, German soldiers were all over the place. But I stayed\non this farm and kept avery, very low profile. And I lived with this family for a\ncouple of months.",
        "A: Food, yeah. And then, as the Germans came close, they moved me into a\nwooded area. There was a little makeshift shelter and I stayed there for a week\nor two. And during the night they brought me food and some wine and\nsome Calvados,which is sort of an apple liqueur. And I stayed there for a\nwhile. And they came one day and_ said they had a passage for me. And I went\nto the side of the road, I was picked up by aFrench couple, take me into Paris,\nand they're the ones that turned me in to the Germans. They were collaborators\nwith the Germans. And went into Paris, had an apartment there, and I\nwas thereabout a day or two and the Gestapo came one night and arrested me,\nthrew me in prison.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, it was. Because I didn't know what they were going to do with\nme. They interrogated me. I didn't -- I couldn't tell them anything. Ihad\nalready been out of contact with the troops and what was going on inthe war\nbecause it was -- because _+two months, shot down in June and I wasn't\ncaptured until August, so...",
        "A: I didn't know who it was. They just came in and arrested me.",
        "A: They were not in uniforms. They -- like you saw in the movies they were\ndressed basically in black. Maybe that was the Gestapo's uniform.",
        "A: And they had pistols. And they just told me I was under arrest and called\nme into Gestapoheadquarters and interrogated me for most of the night and\nthrew me in prison in the morning.",
        "A: In very good English, yeah. I think it was amajor, German major, spoke\nvery good English. Knew an awful lot about the United States. Name, rank\nand serial number is the only thing I knew.",
        "A: I was hit acouple of times with like a rubber truncheon on the back of head,\nbut they weren'textremely mean to me at all. They just tried to get me to\ntell them something. But Iwas already out of the war for several months at this\npoint. I didn't know what was going on from June until August when I was\ncaptured.",
        "A: Probably 10 hours or so. Yeah.",
        "A: When I was handcuffed -- they picked up a young boy and I was sort of\nhandcuffed to this young boy. I don't know what his relationship was. He\nwas in the apartment that I was captured in. I don't know if it was the son of\nsomebody or -- but I was handcuffed to him all night long. We were thrown in\nsome room.And in the morning I understood he was executed, this boy. And\nI just was interrogated some more and went intoprison, Fresnes prison, which\nis abig old prison in Paris.",
        "A: I was in there first with four -- three other prisoners who were French\nspeaking and later onI was put into another cell with English -- fourother\nEnglish-speaking prisoners. We didn't talk too much to each other because we\ndidn't know who was aspy and who was a good person. Because they would try\nto be friendly with somebody that maybe they'd get some information out of.\nSo we really didn't really talk too much to each other.",
        "A: Maybe three weeks. Because the troops were coming close. After the\ninvasion, by August they were getting pretty close to Paris. And one day they\njust evacuated the prison and put us onboxcars and we left Paris.",
        "A: A lot. We were inthose _ nights. Eight horses, forty men. They were able to\nsqueeze 100 of usina boxcar.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We were all standing up, some laying down. Took turns.",
        "A: We were pretty crowded in there. We had a couple of pales, one with water and one\nfor used water.",
        "A: It was very crowded and very unsanitary. They had given us a loaf of bread\nand we were in that boxcar five days.",
        "A: No, a single loaf for each of us.",
        "A: For the five days, yeah.",
        "A: When they opened up -- well, they opened up acouple of times to let us\nrelieve ourselves on the way. When they finally opened up we were in\nBuchenwald concentration camp.",
        "A: I think some knew where we were. We thought when the doors would open\nwe would be ina POW camp, except I knew POWs didn't have striped\nuniforms, were not emaciated. They were like walking ghosts. And we just\nknew we were in Buchenwald but we didn't know too much aboutBuchenwald.\nI didn't hear about concentration camps when I was growing up. I didn't know\nwhat they were like. And they were bad places. And these prisoners were all --\nwell, they were Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, whatever Germany didn't want\nwent into aconcentration camp. And they stripped us completely naked,\nshaved every hair off ourbody, doused us with disinfectant, gave us a shirt and\na pair of pants -- was probably from somebody who died, they were civilian-\ntype clothes-- we had no shoes, no socks, and we slept outside, just on the\nground for probably five or six days. And this was in October. It was getting\npretty cold. We finally did get into a barrack type thing and we slept on these\nshelves and they had four tiers high and probably five men on a shelf. I lost 68\npounds in the concentration camp. You got aslice of bread in the morning, we\ngot alittle bit of watery soup, and you got coffee,maybe a slice of bread at\nnight. We were pretty much bitten by fleas and lice. It was -- Buchenwald was\nahorrible place. [know you've probably been to the Holy Cross Museum. It --\nit was bad. We were there until November.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: [had no idea, except all these guys were in sort of grey and black striped\nsuits, they werelike walking ghosts. We didn't know where we were. We did\nvery quickly know that we were in aconcentration camp, but I didn't know what\naconcentration camp was. I wasn't alone, there was 168 of us that were picked\nup in one day in Paris. They just swept through the city. They knew where they\nwere and they just decided to pick us all up. We were Americans, British,\nAustralian, New Zealanders. All airmen, some officers, non-comms. All trying\nto evade capture, and they picked us all up in one day in Paris.",
        "A: Well, they kept us together. Yeah. We were together. We were always\ntogether. We didn't talk to each other very much because we reallydidn't\nknow if there was aspy planted in among us. Because we didn't know each\nother. We were only just -- I think some of the airmen knew each other, some of\nthe Brits probably did. And we just stuck together as a group, tried to act as a\nmilitary unit.",
        "A: We tried to stay together. We tried to stand at attention. We tried to act like\nsoldiers. And just weekly Ithink we had formations. We tried to just act\nlike soldiers should rather thanwander around the camp trying to steal\nsomebody's shoes or something like that. It was a-- we were apretty motley\ncrew atthis point. AsI say, there was 168 of us, so we all spoke English. And\nthat was the other thing, language is aterrible barrier. And there were Poles,\nthere was some Germans or some French,there were some Danish, there were\nall kinds of people, gypsies. All men, there's no women there. They did have\nsome women in parts of the camp, some children in parts of the camp. It was\na horrible experience because we did find out shortly before we were moved to\na POW camp that we were scheduled to get executed. We just missed it by afew\ndays. When we got there they said the only way out was up the chimney _ +.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: I did not, no. [saw some people that were hung. Isaw some people who\nwere pretty much beaten to death. If they went into a_ we didn't know, we were\njust a separate English-speakinggroup of people. We were in one area.",
        "A: Infractions. The concentration camp was guarded by prisoners. There were\nsome pretty mean prisoners who got extra rations, they got extra benefits by\nkeeping the prisoners in order, andthey would not hesitate to beat somebody to\ndeath. Concentration camp was just -- saw very few -- saw very few German\nguards or anything, they were all civilian guards. They were called \"kapos.\"\nI guess it's some name, probably is anabbreviation for something, whatever\nthis word \"kapo\" was. But it was just abad place.",
        "A: I think they were prisoners. I think they were prisoners. They were in\nSeparate areas.",
        "A: So sometimes you'd see them being transported to one part of the camp.\nThe camp was sort of segregated into various groups of people. Some may\nhave been children. There were some women prisoners there. There were\nsome children. The children were treated pretty nicely. I didn't see underfed\nchildren. And notalotof children, you'd just see them on occasion.",
        "A: On one occasion. There was an air strike -- Buchenwald was next door to a\nsmall factory andthere was an air strike and the factory was hitand they made\nus pick up fire damage, carry away some of the debris. And I think we maybe\ndid it for something to do. We didn't work very hard. Some of us carried the\nstuff out, some carried it back in, to make it look like we were busy. But they\ndid force us to supposedly work. And that only went on forafew days.\nThe air strike did not hit any of the prisoners. I think there were afew\nGermans killed in the air strike. That's as close as I want to be to an air strike,\nair raid.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. Bombs make alot of noise when they go off.",
        "A: It was alittle bit away from our camp, where we were, So...",
        "A: I think we all did, yes. Ithink they did know. Because we were classified as\nPOWs, I think, in French prison in Paris. But when they evacuated Paris we\nwere just now politicalprisoners. They declared us political prisoners.\nConcentration camp, I don't think they care what we were. We were prisoners,\nperiod. As I say, they did have us scheduled to be executed.",
        "A: Any friends?",
        "A: Not really. Imade afew American friends. Some I stayed in contact with\nfor quite a fewperiod of years. There's not very many of us left any\nmore. Over 168 strong, we're probably down less than 20 now around the\ncountry -- or around, even, you know, Australia, England, because we were all\ntogether. So...",
        "A: There was an English officer who outranked us and he became the leader.\nAnd Ican't remember his name. I did have it written down, but ... but he had no\n-- he tried to keep us asa military unit. But once we got out of the\nconcentration camp into a POW camp, then there were leaders there. When we\ngot into Stalag HI there were some high-ranking officers that took charge.",
        "A: No. No. I don't know if you could. It was pretty much enclosed in electrified\nfences. And where do you go? You're in Germany now.",
        "A: You don't have any allies like perhaps in France. No, we made no attempt to\nget out. I think that would be adeath sentence if you were caught.",
        "A: A German Luftwaffe officer came into camp. And I don't know what he\ncame into camp for, but it was either an inspection team or something. And he\ndeclared that we were airmen and did not belong in the concentration camp, we\nbelonged in the POW camp and shortly after that we got moved out. But it was a\nGerman officer that declared that we were not political prisoners, that we were\nprisoners of war and belonged inaPOW camp.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: I think the fact that he was aGerman Luftwaffe officer, we were airmen, he\nwas an airman, and he just knew what was right.",
        "A: Yes, we saw him because he walked through the camp.",
        "A: No, Idid not. Our leader may have. I don't know.",
        "A: Probably less than a week. Less than a week they put us on the train, we\nended up in Stalag III.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Basically we were going to a POW camp. I didn't know which one or where.\nWe went there to Stalag III, came in, were greeted by abunch of prisoners.\nThey declared they never saw such aratty bunch of people, because some of\nus hadshoes, some of us had clogs on, some of us werebare-footed. We had\nraggedy clothes and we were dirty because we got no showers. We went a\ncouple of months without being able to shower. We were pretty smelly. We\nhad -- our clothes were basically rags. After Stalag III -- and they greeted us\nand first thing you know we were washed up, we had shoes, we had socks,\nunderwear, had auniform again. I'm American, but [had an Australian\nuniform.  Butit was anice uniform, it was warm clothes. Had nice warm\nbarracks to sleep in. Everything was pretty good. This was end of October, I\nthink.",
        "A: No. [had diarrhoea a couple of times but that was about it. [had a short bout\nwith jaundice, but nothing bad. I was never wounded or had no broken bones or\nanything.",
        "A: Sixty-eight pounds.",
        "A: Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I got back a good share of that weight. Yeah. It was\ngood.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Food was great compared to what we had. We had Red Cross parcels. Even\nthough -- we were supposed to get a Red Cross parcel every week and we were\non half parcels. And we got foods from the Germans. We used to get potatoes\nand turnips and sometimes ahunk of meat of some sort. We ate very simply\nwell inthe POW camp. We were in aroom, each room held eight prisoners.\nWe put all our Red Cross parcels together. So even if we had four parcels,\nbecause we were on half rations, and we just sort of planned our meals. We had\none cook stove. Each room had so much time on the cook stove. We started in\nthe morning -- each room got one or two brickets. We'd start a fire and we'd\nkeep it going and each room would taketime to prepare some sort of a meal for\nyour room or they would do it through their room. Or sometimes you ate a meal\nearly, sometimes you ate ameal late, but it was just taken you only had one\nkitchen and you took turns using it. We cooked as a group of eight men using\nRed Cross parcels and what the Germans gave us.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And guarding it.",
        "A: No, I did not. And I don't think we did. Other than to line up for a pill in the\nmorning and be counted and go back about our business.",
        "A: We were not made to work at all. Our days were going to school. We tried to\nrun some classes. I tried to run some classes in photography,because my\nbackground was chemistry, photography, I worked for Kodak. Other people\nwould try to teach a language. We had alibrary of many books. Some of the\nprisoners put on plays. This was a -- one of the old-time POW camps. It was\nmostly British, Australians were in there. We as Americans were the minority.\nAnd alot of the prisoners had been there for five years. They were picked up\nin boats when the Battle of Britain went on very early inthe war. And these\nwere old-time Brits that were prisoners after five years and we were the\nnewcomers. And they were just recovering from the execution of all the\nprisoners that tried to escape for The Great Escape when they executed --\nbecause The Great Escape took part -- some of it started in the barracks that I\nwas in. And there were mostly Australian and British airmen in our\nbarracks. We had basically just one room of Americans in this particular\nbarracks that I was in.",
        "A: No. No. They didn't talk about it at all. We didn't talk to them very much.\nThe group of eight Americans that were in my room, we just talked to each\nother, basically. We didn't correspond or talk to the Brits or Australians.",
        "A: No, it was just -- it was just the fact that we were Americans, they were Brits,\nyou know.",
        "A: Yeah, they left us alone. Other than counting us twice a day they did not\nbother us at all.",
        "A: We -- you would get anews report almost daily. There was a clandestine\nradio someplace and wordwould be passed along how the war was going, you\nknow. Where this radio was I had no idea. These old-time prisoners were pretty\ninnovative of whatthey did and where they hid the stuff. Because | think it was\ndisassembled every time and put in various parts of the barracks. But we'd get\nanews report, yeah. We pretty much knew what was going on.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: When I was liberated. We were down in (?Luisburg?), Patton's army came in\nand liberated us.",
        "A: It was -- I want to say 29 April '44 -- was it '45 I think the war ended? Yeah,\nthe war was over with. Germany was defeated. Patton's army came in to -- we\nhad been -- I was at Stalag III and then we were force marched to another POW\ncamp and then we were force marched to another place. We ended up in\nsouthern Germany and then Patton was coming up from the south and liberated\nUS.",
        "A: I think we -- talking about killed, we did lose one man in Buchenwald\nconcentration camp. We had one lieutenant, L.C. Beck, he got pneumonia, was\nput in the hospital in Buchenwald and he died there. He was the only fatality we\nreally had of prisoners that I knew or prisoners that I waswith. I stayed in\ncorrespondence with his mother for anumber of years. Every time the allies\ngot close they'd force marched us out. And the first one was in the dead of\nwinter. I think we were given two hours to get ready to march in the end of\nJanuary. And it was a blizzard. We were trying to put together every scrap\nof food that we could put our hands on. We tried to take apart our beds to make\na Sleigh to haul, our bedding -- anything that we could carry. And I think it\nwas probably two o'clock in the morning, in ablizzard, they force marched us\nfor 30 kilometers to get out of the area.",
        "A: The Russians were coming in. They were going to liberate us -- not liberate\nus, but they would have liberated us. They just did not want us to be put back in\nservice. They wanted to keep us as hostages, perhaps, for some negotiations\nlater on. But they did not want the camp to be overtaken and have us liberated.\nSo they just emptied the camp. Gave us an hour or two to pack up and they just\nmarched us -- we ended up marching all the way down to Nuremberg over the\nperiod of amonth or so.",
        "A: Oh, April 29th, something like that. Yeah",
        "A: We knew we were liberated but we were still captive within the thing, they\njust did not want100,000 kriegies -- \"kriegies\" is prisoner of war in German --\nthey just didn't want a bunch ofkriegies running around the countryside\nliberating everything they put your hands on. So we were still held captive.\nBut we had alot of food then. We started getting some army D-rations,\nwhatever they called them. So they just -- they kept us enclosed.",
        "A: It may have been a week or so. And they started moving us out into France,\nto a placecalled Camp Lucky Strike where we wereinterrogated by our forces\nand, you know, what it was like and what we did and who we were. And we got\nsome army uniforms again and started looking like soldiers and made\narrangements to get back home. It took me 30 days to get back to the States.",
        "A: Went back to England. Got a-- scrounged aride on a Liberty Ship that was\nthe going back to Boston. It was unorganised. It was just -- we scrounged a\nbunch of food and we went back on aLiberty Ship and went home. We had had\norders in France to whom we had to report back to -- to fly, I think it was Fort\nDixon in New Jersey that we had to report within 30 days or something like\nthat.",
        "A: Yes. Uh-huh.",
        "A: It seemed good. I don't have a\u2014 because I was already free for some period\nof time and -- it was good to be home. What was strange, they just give us a\ntrain ticket to our home. I came into Rochester and didn't have any money, got\nacab driver to drive me to -- because my wife atthis point had gone back to her\nmother's house. And I just walked in on them. Communication was bad. We\ndidn't have telephones. Long distance was costly. We didn't have any money.\nIt was -- it was astrange situation. But we did have orders to go back into the\nservice for aperiod of time to get mustered out, you. know.",
        "A: Everybody was in tears. They were happy to see me. They were glad\nthat Iwas home. There were alot of parties and, I don't know, it was just a\ngood feeling.",
        "A: My wife did not know what happened to me for -- I went down in June and I\nthink it was late January before she knew I was even alive. I was just MIA all\nthis time. But she did finally get word that I was a prisoner of war, and that\nwas about it. [never -- never heard from anybody for awhole year. Had no\ncommunication. I didn't know if my mum and dad were alive, I didn't know if\nmy wife was alive. There was just no communication at all. There's certainly\nno mail in concentration camp. And, as I say, mail was slow, you know. So I\njust walked in, everybody was happy to see me. I said at the time I have to go\nback to Fort Dixon in 30 days and get mustered out.",
        "A: My official discharge didn't come into effect until October, but I was not in\nany place. I had built up some leave and I was paid through, I think, October.",
        "A: Went back to Kodak, yes.",
        "A: I think I-- oh, yeah, yeah, I think I talked to a lot of people at the time. I did\nsome talks for the Red Cross. I did some talks for some civic organisations\nback in Rochester at the time. Got some newspaper publicity. Even today I talk\nto school kids if there's any occasion that they would want to know about World\nWar II. [had one of the girls at the schools ask me, she said, \"When you\nwere shot down, did you call your wife and tell her where you were?\" All these\nkids have cell phones today.",
        "A: Here Iam 91, I don't even have acell phone.",
        "A: Almost immediately. It was acouple of weeks.",
        "A: No. I was looking forward to it. Because I had 30 days leave and I did a lot of\nstuff, got alot of things in order. It was way past due on my income tax. That\nwas what killed me, that I had to pay income tax for all the stuff I was paid when\nI was in the service and was a prisoner. They didn't give me a free rein on\npaying taxes.",
        "A: There's a lot of legal stuff to go through and get back into civilian life. The\ntime I came home, then my discharge official was in October.",
        "A: I flew once or twice -- [had acustomer that had an aircraft, he and I went\nup a couple oftimes. Flying a_ is not like flying an airplane. I was used to a\nhigh-performance aircraft. SoInever flew any more. I had it out of my\nsystem.",
        "A: Nothing I can think of other than the fact I'm extremely proud that I had an\nopportunity to serve and I think I did some good during World War II. I have no\nill feelings towards my -- the peoplethat captured me and treated me -- my\nnature 1s not to be ever angry at anybody, I'm avery happy person.I have no ill\nfeeling towards Germany. One thing I have to say, Idid get some good\ncompensation from Germany after the war. One was for forced labour. As a\nPOW you were not supposed to work. I got that from the German government\nand I got asettlement from the German factories for labour I had put in and\nvariousaspects of being a prisoner. Both were around $50,000 each. As I say, I\nhave no ill feelings for -- war is not healthy. It's something we do. You have to\ndo for patriotic -- that's all I have to say. I'm proud I served. It was an\nexperience, so... That's about it.",
