        "Q: It was okay.",
        "A: \u2014 it was easier than in Vilnius.",
        "Q: What happened to her?",
        "A: She was killed by the Germans. I received a letter from a Jewish doctor\nMelamed(ph) from Iwje, and he wrote, kill the Germans, kill the Germans. Your\nmother, together with other intelligentsia went to someplace \u2014 I don\u2019t remember\nwhat is the name of the place \u2014 and was executed.",
        "Q: Where were you when you got this letter? Where were you when you got this\nletter?",
        "A: In the army.",
        "Q: I know, but what ci \u2014 what place? What place? Were you in Leningrad?",
        "A: In Leningrad all the time.",

        "A: Yeah, all the time. All the time of the blockade.",
        "Q: So were \u2014 this was \u2014 you got the letter before the blockade?",
        "A: It was already the blockade, because when the Reds came to Iwje, they came to\neastern Poland. And when they came to eastern Poland, the western part of Soviet\nRussia became \u2014\nNovember 24, 2009",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: As you were growing up, in your childhood, in your \u2014 in your teenage years, did\nyou have any political interests at all? Were you interested in politics? Did you\nidentify yourself to any particular group?",
        "A: My beloved organization was Hashomer Hatzair. From Hashomer Hatzair,\nmost of the Shomerim took part in every fight against Hitler. And how you see on\nmany of the photographs, I am with the Hashomer. This is my political\norganization.",
        "Q: Tell us \u2014 tell us a little bit more about these organizations, so that people who are\nlistening to this in the future would understand what they were.",
        "A: Hashomer Hatzair was beloved by my father because he was a Zionist, and this\nwas the most developed youth organization for Zionists. So he loved Hashomer\nHatzair. And he told my mother that it is a good place for your son to be a Shomer.\nNovember 24, 2009\nFirst she said, ah, I don\u2019t know what kind of youth 1s there, that is different youth,\ngood and bad and all that. But when he told her, she took it \u2014",
        "Q: Seriously.",
        "A: Yes. And I was very close to Hashomer Hatzair because my father was the\nhead of the Zionist organization.",
        "Q: Did you have any other close relatives as you were growing up, with you? To\nme, I get the impression that it was only your mother and yourself, as a team.\nYou\u2019re the geographer, she\u2019s the dentist. Were there any other people who were\nclose to you at those years?",
        "A: I will tell you, there is, in my biography a lot of details. But I will repeat the\nmost important. My mother\u2019s sister, Mina(ph) was a massage-ist in the\nDruskininkai. That\u2019s why almost every year I am coming to the Druskininkai for\ntwo weeks, and I see some of the forest there, and for me is a great, tragic pleasure\nto see it. So, I went to the cemetery of people who were killed in Druskininkai.\nMost of the people were Russians, and there was written their military \u2014",
        "Q: Rank.",
        "A: Yes. And they saw that some other man is going on the same cemetery and is \u2014\nhe reads the inscriptions on the monuments. Well, I began to speak with him and he\nNovember 24, 2009\nsaid that yes, | am from Druskininkai. I was a partisan against Hitler. All the Jews\nfrom Druskininkai were taken to Grodno and executed.",
        "Q: That would mean your aunt as well.",
        "A: And among them was my mother\u2019s sister, the massage-ist, Mina(ph). In Nesvizh\nmy mother had a brother, Zahar(ph). Zahar(ph) was killed in Nesvizh very fast,\nbecause the Germans had the impression that his son has sympathies for leftist. So\nhe was executed almost immediately, maybe the second or third day in Nesvizh. He\nwas a composer, and I have probably here some notes that he composed. And some\nof his songs, I know from my memory, and I would want to \u2014 to \u2014 to make some \u2014\nsome use of that.",
        "Q: Could you sing something? Would you mind singing one of those songs? Do you\nmind singing one of them right now?",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Atango(ph). [sings]",
        "Q: Thank you, thank you, I know it\u2019s not easy. But we care very much about the\nmusic that people created. And when \u2014 this is the music of the boy who was killed,\nthen, almost immediately.",
        "A: It was the [indecipherable] killed. His name is Salomone(ph) Zarhe(ph).",
        "Q: Salomone(ph) Zarhe(ph).",
        "A: Yes, Salomone(ph) Zarhe(ph). Salomone(ph), we called him Moniek(ph).",
        "Q: Moniek(ph).",
        "A: Moniek(ph) Zarhe(ph). Everybody knew him, because in Nesvizh he was the\ndirector of a dancing and singing ensemble.",
        "Q: When did you \u2014 when you found \u2014 do you remember when you found out about\nthese different things? Was it when you were in Leningrad, or after the war? What\nhappened to your Aunt Mina(ph), what happened to Moniek(ph), what happened to\nNovember 24, 2009\nyour mother. I mean, your mother is, you got the letter, but the other people who\nwere close to you and dear to you, when did you find out about their fate?",
        "A: Something I found from letters, like Dr. Melamud\u2019s(ph) son from\n[indecipherable]. Somebody I found in Druskininkai already lately \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm, recently.",
        "A: Yes, that they saw that all the Jews were executed in Grodno. From many\npeople, I know who survived Nesvizh. For instance, I write to Israel, to a very old\nfriend. The old friend fought with me under Leningrad, against Hitler, but I didn\u2019t\nknow about it, because under Leningrad you had a half million soldiers, wh-wh-\nwho knows? And this was the photograph of the Radziwells. His father was\nphotographing everything what happens in the palace of the Radziwells.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And the Radziwells was not simple youks, but they had people in the royal\nfamily of Poland.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So it was a very special family. For instance, around Nesvizh they had over a\nmillion hectares of ground, except the palace, with the park, with everything. Now,\nfrom Nesvizh \u2014 so, I receive letters until now from the friend from Israel. He was\nvery hard \u2014\nNovember 24, 2009",
        "Q: Wounded, or something?",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Wounded, was he wounded, did he have injuries?",
        "A: He \u2014 he \u2014 he couldn\u2019t walk, al-al-al-almost \u2014 almost he couldn\u2019t. His wife died a\nshort time ago, she was a survivor from Romania. So, from him I know a lot. A lot\nI know from the book, from Dr. Shalom Cholawsky. Dr. Shalom Cholawsky\nwrote about Jewish partisans who fought against Hitler. And he was one of the\nheads of the Jewish partisans. And he\u2019s \u2014 here is his photograph with his rifle. Dr.\nShalom Cholawsky. So, from such \u2014",
        "Q: Sources.",
        "A: \u2014 sources, I know something.",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s go back now to Leningrad.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And tell us \u2014 tell me about what was your experience there. What was it like to\nbe in the siege of Leningrad\u2019? What kind of fighting happened?",
        "A: You have to take [indecipherable] something, that\u2019s my mother finished a\nRussian high school, and a Russian university in Kharkov, in Ukraine. And\nRussian, she said to everybody that Russia is my homeland. So I had some\nsentiments to Russian culture, to Tolstoy, to \u2014 to Chekhov.\nNovember 24, 2009",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: It is under-understandable. So, when I came to the Russian army, I found people\nwho speak almost so well, how I am speaking Russian. And born in Nikopol\u2019, so it\nis Russia. So, to en \u2014 together I am theirs, you know. So I have very strong\nsentiments to Russian culture, to the Russian people, but not to the Russian\n[indecipherable].",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Because politics are very different, with a lot of facts, subjective facts. The\nPolish look different today, different they looked 15 years ago, so I try to be very\nneutral, and my politics is the politics of America.",
        "Q: But in Leningrad in 1941, that\u2019s the story I want to capture. Of a young man\nwho\u2019s 20 years old, or 19 years old, who\u2019s in the Soviet army, and li\u2014 and you\nknow, it\u2019s hard time. I want to learn about what that was like.",
        "A: Yes. In the gymnasium of Slovatski(ph) in Vilnius was a legya(ph), legya(ph), a\nlegion of young people who had a military training. But not all the Jews were there.\nSome, if they were [indecipherable] but if they were young [indecipherable].\nWhen they came to the Red Army, it was a training shooting. And I shot three times\nand I make 29 points.",
        "Q: Is that good or bad? I have no idea.\nNovember 24, 2009",
        "A: It is a very high result.",
        "Q: So that means you\u2019re a good marksman.",
        "A: Yes. A man who speaks Russian, and who shoots 29 from 30 possible\ntheoretically \u2014",
        "Q: Points.",
        "A: Oh, okay. It was another training, who will put his gasmask faster than any\nother. So many made it in five seconds, in seven seconds. I made in one second and\nfour. Ay. So they gave me on a good artillery position, thanks which I don\u2019t hear\nyou too well.",
        "Q: If you had gotten 20, and not 30 - 29, maybe you\u2019d hear me better, is that what\nyou\u2019re saying?",
        "A: Probably, probably. Or not \u2014",
        "Q: Or not.",
        "A: \u2014 or not.",
        "Q: You never, never know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So, you were in the artillery, so that means front line, yes?\nNovember 24, 2009",
        "A: So, it was artillery against German bombers. And sometimes we shoot well, and\nsometimes we shoot very badly. The first day, we shoot in \u2014 in \u2014 in a Russian plane\nby mistake.",
        "Q: It happens.",
        "A: It is different, you know. And when the Russians, at whom we shoot, found\nthemselves a piece of a forest and were hiding, so we gave a commander to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nshot better. And they came to the [indecipherable] to our battery, and they said, no\nmore planes.",
        "Q: Good that they survived. At least that much.",
        "A: So, was th-the \u2014 the begin of our great training. But, because we shot bombers,\nthe head of our unit said, we anti-aviation artillery-ists, we are living a long time, so\nhe said. Because, you know, they bombard a factory, and they don\u2019t look on the\nbattery of artilleries, they don\u2019t need a battery of artilleries, they need a \u2014 to destroy\nthe factory, or to destroy the civilian population in this city, on the market or\nsomething. So, the \u2014 the head of the unit told the truth. I think that he 1s still alive.",
        "Q: Did you eat well during the siege?",
        "A: This was the most terrible thing. At home I weighted 66 kilograms. In the army,\nI weighted 39 - 37. I looked more like a dead man. The hunger was terrible. It is\nterrible. It is weeks and weeks and months and months, almost nothing eating. I\nNovember 24, 2009\nhave an excellent book, he has the book, where the author wrote the true face of the\nblockade of [indecipherable]. It is the one book where there is no subjective to \u2014 to\nmuch moments. He wrote how it was, everything. It is \u2014 it 1s terrible. You are\nwalking through the streets and you are seeing dozens of dying people. This author\nsaid that in the hunger in Leningrad died one million population. One million; not\nmilitary, civil population. And he said that the history doesn\u2019t know a second such\ncase that 900 days you don\u2019t give up, and Hitler can\u2019t take Leningrad. The\nmarshals of Hitler came close the gates of the city, and they brought even stones to\nbuild a monument for Hitler, for their fuehrer. And we did, 20 years old guys, we\nsaid no. No. Ended. No was true.",
        "Q: No stones for \u2014 yes. So what was it that you did eat? What was it that you did\neat?",
        "Q: This author wrote exactly, I will tell you for an example. 15 grams sugar, it is not\na full teaspoon. Around 20 pounds fat, but who knows what kind of fat it is? From a\ndog, or from a \u2014 from a cow? Who \u2014 who \u2014 who knows what it is? No bread, but\ninstead of bread, sukardi(ph). It\u2019s made \u2014 it means pieces of bread baked on \u2014 on \u2014\non fire, you know. So people said that the material for the \u2014 for the bread is the rest\nfrom food for horses, for cavalry. But the horses died from hunger a long time ago,\nand they make \u2014 made bread for the population. What is there more?\nNovember 24, 2009",
        "Q: I\u2019m tal \u2014 but you, is there something you remember eating? This is the same\nthing \u2014",
        "A: This is \u2014 this was my \u2014 my eating, but it came a better time, as they send my unit\nto the lake of Ladoga.",
        "Q: Where is that?",
        "A: Ladoga is the largest lake in Europe. It is between Finland and between Russia.\nThe Finnish said that all Ladoga has to belong to them, and the Russians say that\nall Ladoga has to belong to the Russians. On the Ladoga were points where trucks\nwinter were going through the snow and the ice, through the Ladoga, through the \u2014\nwith some food. And we didn\u2019t have a lot work to fight to the Germans, so we had\nenough time to help the civil population. So, we could \u2014",
        "Q: Get some food.",
        "A: \u2014 something what fell on the \u2014 on the ground, or something to \u2014 but to take\nsomething from a truck, dead. Everybody knew, don\u2019t touch it. The Ladoga has 42\nkilometers, such trees were from a \u2014 one side were the Finns, and on the other side\nthe Russians.",
        "Q: And were you shooting at each other at that time, the Finns and the Russians, or\nnot?",
        "A: What?\nNovember 24, 2009",
        "Q: At that time, when you were in Ladoga, were the Finns shooting at the Russians\nor not, and the Russians shooting at the Finns?",
        "A: I would say that the Finns wanted to look more gentlemen than the Germans. I\nfeel so, that they threw less shells on the Russian territora \u2014 territory than the\nGermans. I have a such feeling, because in Leningrad was inscriptions on the\nwalls, where is safer to \u2014 to walk. So, if you look what is written, it 1s written so,\nlike most of the shells would come from the dort \u2014 from the Finns. Less from the\nFinns and more from the south.",
        "Q: From the Germans.",
        "A: From the Germans. I have a such impression. And the author of the book writes\nthat the dictator of Finland was a administered by the tsar in Russia. So, he even\ntold \u2014 maybe it is a fantasy, but he told the Finnish army that he was the dictator,\nbut don\u2019t touch [indecipherable].",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: So, it was some easier situation.",
        "Q: How long were you there, at Lake Ladoga?",
        "A: A winter of minus 40 Celsius, minus 47.",
        "Q: Oh yay, oh yay.\nNovember 24, 2009",
        "A: That\u2019s why I pray from \u2014 for Roosevelt. He gave us warm shoes. It was more\nimportant than anything else. Churchill didn\u2019t do it, but Roosevelt. So, with the\ngood shoes, we ate a little more, and someday I was taken, together with 15 \u2014 16\nother Polish Jews, and sent back to the city to \u2014 sent to the city of Leningrad back.\nI came back, it was after a winter of Ladoga, I came back to a reserve unit, and the\nreserve unit, some people who didn\u2019t like too much amho \u2014 too much Jewish\npeople. Ah, they are all Polish, send them to Poland back. We\u2019re organizing a\nPolish army, a leftist army. So, in the reserve unit I was taken to, after a winter of\nLadoga, and I came to the Polish army, and in the Polish army I fought in many\nplaces.",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: In such places like \u2014 I didn\u2019t sleep too much. Schneidemwuhl.",
        "Q: Was that already east Russia?",
        "A: Schneidemunhl, it is in western Pomerania. It is the western part of today\u2019s\nPoland.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: On the Baltic Sea. So, the Germans, when we was closer to Berlin, being\nstronger and stronger, and they took already all the people to the army an-and \u2014 and\ntoo young, and too old, and too \u2014 everybody understood that the end will come.\nNovember 24, 2009\nNow, and with the Polish army, I took part in the fight for Warsaw, until \u201945, May\ntwo, I fought in Berlin.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What are your memories from there?",
        "A: Mm?",
        "Q: What can you tell us about your experience there?",
        "A: The Germans had a very strong discipline in the army. Very strong discipline.\nAnd the Hitler youth organization elevated them, the young people was tigers.\nYoung girls 14 years old, were standing in the windows and shooting into the\nSoviet tanks. But Zhukov had this time more force, more planes, more artillery. I\nwas an inspector over in the \u2014 1n the army, so I was sent to different units, and\namong the units were such shells and artillery, that when you s \u2014 closing to the \u2014 to\nthe gun, it was a hundred thun-thunders, not one thunder, a hundred thunders.\nThat\u2019s why my hearing 1s a such one, but when I was still young, 1t was okay. When\nI became very old, is not okay.",
        "Q: Tell me, the Soviet army \u2014 you were in the Polish army, not the Soviet army. But\nthe Soviet army did not have the best reputation as it went westwards, dif \u2014 firing\non the retreating Germans. And the bad reputation was generally borne by the\nNovember 24, 2009\nfemale civilian population. The Soviet army had a reputation of raping its way\nwestwards to Berlin. Do you know, did you see any of that?",
        "A: I saw many such cases. In comparison with what Hitler did in one White\nRussia, can you forget about everything else? Because they didn\u2019t leave White\nRussia at all. No one house was in \u2014 1n a normal shape. Nothing was. It \u2014 it was\nSahara. So, to \u2014 to compare if a young Russian tried something, yes, it is very bad,\nsure, sure. And Zhukov gave very hard penalties for such things, very hard\npenalties. The head of our unit and Soviet chemical specialist had something to do\nin Warsaw. In Poland the \u2014 they behaved a lot better than in other places. So he\ngot three months in a \u2014 1-1-1n a special \u2014",
        "Q: Prison?",
        "A: In a special unit.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Where the unit was all the times sent on the front, you know. And he came \u2014\ncame alive. It 1\u2014 it 1s \u2014 it is a\u2014 a very big problem, but every war brings true\ncrimes. Every war.",
        "Q: Did you, as you were \u2014 before you went into the Polish army, or as you were\ngoing westwards, did you go through Belarus, did you see Nesvizh? Did you see\nanything of your former life while you were still in the army\u201d?\nNovember 24, 2009",
        "A: When I was in the army, I didn\u2019t see exactly the places where I was before,\nbecause w-we went around Warsaw and from Warsaw in Pomerania, close to the\nBaltic Sea, I was never there before. So, I can tell only like about this author of the\nbook, and about Russian people, who told me what there was. In \u2014 in White\nRussia, if a Jewish partisan was caught, they killed all the village, burned all the\nvillage, and their pro-pro-pro-pro-pro acquaintance were killed. It 1s impossible to d\n\u2014 to describe. One word, and you perished, you know. And I saw in White Russia\n[indecipherable] I didn\u2019t leave any, but [indecipherable] didn\u2019t exist. Didn\u2019t exist\nabsolutely.",
        "Q: Yeah, I know.",
        "A: And, when after the discipline, the German discipline finished, oh, we like every\n[indecipherable] I wa \u2014 I was one moment the commander of the first Polish army,\nsend me to find Greek prisoners. Where to look for them? Nobody knows. Okay,\nbu-bu-but \u2014",
        "Q: Where were you \u2014 where were you? Were you in Warsaw then, or in \u2014",
        "A: It finished the war, maybe a week after finishing the war.",
        "Q: And you were in Berlin? The week after you finished the war, where were you\nlocated?",
        "A: I forgot the name. A small town maybe 20 kilometers from Berlin.\nNovember 24, 2009",
        "Q: Okay, you were in Germany.",
        "A: So I want to \u2014 to turn back and to tell you about all the picture.",
        "Q: Oh, let\u2019s \u2014 oh, but \u2014 but if you were in the \u2014 you \u2014 let\u2019s do it the Greek prisoners.\nI was just trying to get a sense of where they were. You were se-sent to find Greek\nprisoners, around this small town in \u2014 near Berlin, yes?",
        "A: Na -\u2014 here 1s Berlin.",
        "Q: Yeah, yes, I know. I don\u2019t have Berlin. So, did you find them?",
        "A: Yes. The commander gave me an excellent new Austrian car with fashion. And,\nlook for the Greeks. I look on this route, on this route, 20 kilometers farther, 60\nkilometers farther, no Greeks. In one place I see a German lady, an old lady. I\nthought, maybe you know something about the Greek prisoners. I don\u2019t know, but I\nsaw prisoners in strange \u2014",
        "Q: Uniforms.",
        "A: \u2014 uniforms. Maybe they are the Greeks. Where are they? La \u2014 three kilometers\nfrom here. I took her to my car, and we brought to the place that she \u2014 around there\nwere Greeks. So I begin to tell them that I am from a classic gymnasium and that I\nknow ancient Greek. Ohh, excellent, excellent. And they began in Latin [speaks\nLatin here]. This is Latin. That \u2014 that is taken from Greek, okay.

He says, General Mitalas. He\nwas the former Greek Minister of Defense. How he came to the Germans? The\nItalians, who couldn\u2019t take Greece, took him. Was a prisoner. And when they,\nunder the pressure of the Americans, they had to go out from \u2014 from Italy, they left\nMitalas there. Okay. So I told in Greek to Mitalas a big part of \u201cThe Iliad\u201d and I\nasked him, do you understood what I said? He said, no. How 1s it possible? A\nformer minister doesn\u2019t know Greek? Homer?

        "A: In general, not. But I was close to Ponary, and Ponary is a station close to\nLandwarow.",

        "A: Ponary is from Vilnius nine kilometers, and Landwarow, 18. How they say in\nrail line.

I go [indecipherable] but what 1s \u2014 what kind of ornament 1s it? On the street\nMickiewicza is \u2014 on the wall of the court before the war in \u2014 in Vilnius, the Polish\ncourt, are names of young people who were killed. By whom they were killed, what\nis it? And the Jewish guy explained me, that the Lithuanians said that the Jews were\ncriminals. That they killed the Lithuanians because the Lithuanians were Soviet\nspies. But I imagine that when the Polish Jewish Jews in Vilnius came back to their\nhouses, and they knew from the population, from \u2014 from many other sources, who\nwas the real spies for Hitler, they came to the Soviets, and the Soviets do what with\nthe young, what they could do with somebody else. Or they could do with \u2014 with\nRussians, who were under such suspicion, you know. So, in Vilnius in\n[indecipherable] city on the street Mickiewicza is a such monument.

        "Q: When did you find out \u2014 you see, when you were talking to me before about how\nBelarus was no more, that it was a Sahara, that could be \u2014 that \u2014 that shows\nGerman brutality, Nazi brutality, collaborator brutality in wartime. When did you\nlearn that there was something particular? When did you learn of the Holocaust?\nWhen did you first see the results that this was against the Jews, that this was a\ngenocide?",
        "A: Okay, I am very glad that you are asking about that. I\u2019m very glad. The\nHolocaust was in several acts. Sometimes very late, and sometimes immediate. The\nimmediate are Ponary, the Jerusalem of Lithuania. The immediate was Nesvizh,\nbecause in Nesvizh was a very hard Jewish community. An intelligent Jewish\ncommunity in Nesvizh. And in Nesvizh they collected all the population on the\nmarket, maybe two weeks after [indecipherable] Nesvizh, and they killed\neverybody. There is maybe \u2014 maybe 10 people were \u2014",

        "Q: Oh my, oh my.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But my question is again, a personal question. When did you personally, where\nwere you when you realized that this was a genocide against the Jews? When did\nyou find out, when did you realize this was not just war, and horrible war, but this\nwas also a genocide?",
        "A: First I have small signals. In the Soviet press, in the military Soviet press, a little\nabout. And I slept with a Jewish guy, Schlitzer(ph) was his name. And Schlitzer\nshed \u2014 said, do you know that the Germans are killing all the Jews? I was very\ncareful. All the Jews? Yes, all the Jews. Yes, I believe. I believe that they could it\ndo, because I am from a classical gymnasium, and I know that the Latin poets said,\nhorror Germanicus(ph). That the main feelings in Germany is horror\nGermanicus(ph). The Belgians are very nice people, but the Germans are a horror.\nTwo thousand years write a Latin words that the main characteristic of Germans is\nhorror.\nNovember 24, 2009",
        "Q: Why were you careful around him, or why were you careful when he said that?",
        "A: I told you yes, it is possible. It is possible. And it was finished, the dispute. If he\nwas a schmekel, so he told somebody else about speaking with me. He was not a\nschmekel, so I told him the truth. It was the first klagator(ph).",
        "Q: Yeah, the first notes.",
        "A: But when I heard more and more about that, and people are \u2014 are writing full\npages and all that? Hey. So it is absolutely true. And when I ber \u2014 began to get news\nfrom Dr. Cholawsky, and news from the guy whose wife saves him, his life, and all\nthat. So naturally it 1s absolutely true, and the news were brighter and brighter and\nbrighter. And I came to Druskininkai, and from Nesvizh people told me that 6,000\nJews in Nesvizh were killed. It means hundred percent.",
        "Q: Again, you learned that recently, you say, and I\u2019m interested in after the war.\nDid you, in Katowice, when you met your future wife, did you already have an idea\nthat this \u2014 that this was complete, that this was a full genocide?",
        "A: In time of war?",
        "Q: Right after the war, yeah.",
        "A: Or \u2014 immediately after the war?",
        "Q: Yeah.\nNovember 24, 2009",

One million; not\nmilitary, civil population. And he said that the history doesn\u2019t know a second such\ncase that 900 days you don\u2019t give up, and Hitler can\u2019t take Leningrad.

        "A: I would say that the Finns wanted to look more gentlemen than the Germans. I\nfeel so, that they threw less shells on the Russian territora \u2014 territory than the\nGermans. I have a such feeling, because in Leningrad was inscriptions on the\nwalls, where is safer to \u2014 to walk. So, if you look what is written, it 1s written so,\nlike most of the shells would come from the dort \u2014 from the Finns. Less from the\nFinns and more from the south.",

No one house was in \u2014 1n a normal shape. Nothing was. It \u2014 it was\nSahara. So, to \u2014 to compare if a young Russian tried something, yes, it is very bad,\nsure, sure. And Zhukov gave very hard penalties for such things, very hard\npenalties. The head of our unit and Soviet chemical specialist had something to do\nin Warsaw.

From\n[indecipherable] east Asia. It is true. We have to take. [speaks foreign language\nhere] we know what it is. It became a slavery. A slavery.

And I never lived so\nexcellent like in the United States. And I have such sentiments to America, if I\nwould be a young man for [indecipherable], I would go to the be \u2014 America with\narms in hand, because I understand something in \u2014 in \u2014 1n [indecipherable] you\nknow.
